Brown III (born August 15, 1954) is an aerospace executive, test pilot instructor, and former United States Air Force officer. , he is the vice president, chief operating officer, and test pilot instructor at the National Test Pilot School located in Mojave, California. Previously, Brown was the chief of flight operations for the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works in Palmdale, California. Before that, he was the chief test pilot for the F-22 Raptor program stationed at Edwards Air Force Base in California where he performed activities including avionics testing, flight envelope expansion, and the creation of procedural flight manuals for the Air Force. Before that, he was the chief test pilot for the F-117 Nighthawk. Brown is a Fellow and past president of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) and is a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Early life James Brown III was born in Bluefield, West Virginia on August 15, 1954, and grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. His interest in flying developed with help from his father, who was an amateur pilot. The young man dreamed of one day becoming an astronaut. He attended the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington, Virginia and graduated in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering. Brown's first solo flight occurred in February 1976. Military career After graduating from VMI, Brown was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force. He entered the Undergraduate Pilot Training program in 1977 and earned his pilot wings the following year. Brown's first operational tour began in 1979 with the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the 52d Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base in West Germany where he flew the F-4 Phantom II. On his next tour, Brown flew the F-5E Tiger II with the 527th Aggressor Squadron at Royal Air Force station Alconbury in England. In 1985, he was selected to attend the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (TPS) at Edwards Air Force Base in California and graduated with Class 86A. His fellow students presented Brown with the Onizuka Prop Wash Award as the student who contributed most to class spirit and morale. The Prop Wash Award is dedicated to the memory of TPS graduate Colonel Ellison Onizuka who died as a member of the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986. Following graduation, Brown tested the A-7 Corsair II, all models of the F-15 Eagle, and performed flight trials on a number of classified prototype aircraft. In 1992, after sixteen years of service, Brown separated from the Air Force. Civilian career Brown interviewed with Lockheed for a test pilot position but, because of reduced military spending after the end of the Cold War, no openings were available. He joined United Airlines in 1992 and flew the Boeing 737 over North and Central America. Pursuing his boyhood dream, Brown applied to the NASA astronaut-training program but was rejected because of an abnormal electrocardiogram. F-117 Nighthawk JB Brown prepares for an F-117 test mission In 1994, he was hired by the Lockheed Skunk Works as a test pilot for the F-117 Nighthawk, where he helped develop and test improvements to the weapons system that proved valuable in Operation Allied Force and Operation Iraqi Freedom. One such improvement was the Integrated Real-time Information into the Cockpit/Real-time Information Out of the Cockpit for Combat Aircraft (IRRCA) project. In 1998 as IRRCA lead test pilot, Brown flew a simulated combat mission to demonstrate the ability to receive real-time mission updates from a satellite and automatically alter the F-117's planned route. The flight also demonstrated reception of text and imagery of the alternate target. Brown encouraged young engineers by presenting lectures such as Braking the F-117 Stealth Fighter given to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics student chapter at the University of California, San Diego. He continued his education and earned a Master of Science degree in Management from Troy State University in Alabama and completed graduate study in mechanical engineering at California State University, Fresno. F-22 Raptor Flying Raptor 4007, JB Brown launches an AIM-9 missile In 2002, after eight years with F-117 program, Brown transferred to the F-22 Raptor. In this new role, he evaluated updated versions of the avionics software and improved the pilot-vehicle interface. On November 22, 2002, Brown flew the mission that completed all Pentagon-mandated flight test goals needed to start the next phase of the program. On this mission, Brown fired an AIM-9M Sidewinder missile at a supersonic QF-4 unmanned drone flying several miles directly ahead of the F-22. The unarmed missile passed close enough to the target to be assessed a lethal hit, satisfying the criteria needed to start the Dedicated Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (DIOTE) phase the following year. Brown has successfully dealt with many F-22 emergencies, including a fuel leak at 30,000 feet while traveling at nearly the speed of sound. On another flight, a mechanical problem affected one of the two jet engines shortly after take off. Aware of a similar situation that resulted in the loss of an F-117, Brown idled the ailing engine rather than shut it down. The second engine began losing power during the landing approach. Brown's unconventional technique to handling the initial problem allowed him to narrowly avoid a much more serious situation. In 2006, Brown was the lead test pilot for the F-22 Raptor program at Edwards Air Force Base. By 2008, Brown had logged over 7,600 flight hours in 124 different types of aircraft. In July 2011, Brown was promoted to Chief Test Pilot of the F-22 Raptor program for Lockheed Martin. In 2012, he became the first test pilot to reach 1,000 flight hours in the F-22. Including his hours in the F-117, Brown had more flight time in stealth jets than any other pilot in the world. Skunk Works and NTPS In 2013, Brown accepted the position of Chief of Flight Operations for the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works providing flight test oversight for evaluations of new technologies. Brown retired from Lockheed in January 2016 and joined the National Test Pilot School (NTPS) as chief operations officer and test pilot instructor. In 2019, he was promoted to NTPS vice president and chief operating officer. Leadership in the aviation community JB Brown (right) receives thanks for his presentation at Columbus AFB Brown has worked extensively in the aviation community to share his expertise and encourage young aviators and engineers. In 2003, he appeared on the Discovery Channel's television show, Secrets of Future Air Power, and described the stealth, weapons, and thrust vectoring capabilities of the F-22. In 2004, he chaired a panel discussion on the early history of the F-16 Falcon. Convened to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the F-16, the panel consisted of United Airline's captain Joe Sobczak, Lockheed F-22 test pilot, John Fergione, retired USAF Colonel James Rider, and \\"father of the F-16\\", Harry Hillaker. During 2004-2005, he served as president of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. At the 2005 Phoenix Leadership Conference, he described aviation's Cockpit Resource Management approach and its relationship to the teamwork effort for businesses. In 2006, he described the unique capabilities of the F-22 to students at Embry‚ÄìRiddle Aeronautical University. In 2008, Brown presented the status of the F-22 test program to the instructor and student pilots at Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi. Honors Brown is a Fellow of both the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and the Royal Aeronautical Society. In 2003, Brown was elected President on the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. He served as President-Elect in 2003, and President for the one- year term in 2004.

Those in the front line are singing \\"The March of the Women\\". \\"The March of the Women\\" is a song composed by Ethel Smyth in 1910, to words by Cicely Hamilton. It became the official anthem of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and more widely the anthem of the women's suffrage movement throughout the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Activists sang it not only at rallies but also in prison while they were on hunger strike. Smyth produced a number of different arrangements of the work.  Composition  Ethel Smyth composed the song in 1910, as a unison song with optional piano accompaniment, with words by Cicely Hamilton.Bennett (1987), p. 378 Smyth based the melody on a traditional tune she had heard in Abruzzo, Italy.St John (1959), p. 151 She dedicated the song to the WSPU. In January 1911, the WSPU's newspaper, Votes for Women, described the song as \\"at once a hymn and a call to battle\\".Crawford (2001), pp. 641‚Äì642  Performances  \\"The March of the Women\\" was first performed on 21 January 1911, by the Suffrage Choir, at a ceremony held on Pall Mall, London, to celebrate a release of activists from prison. Emmeline Pankhurst introduced the song as the WSPU's official anthem, replacing \\"The Women's Marseillaise\\".Purvis (2002), p. 157 The latter song was a setting of words by WSPU activist Florence Macaulay to the tune of La Marseillaise.Crawford (2001), p. 645 On 23 March 1911 the song was performed at a rally in the Royal Albert Hall. Smyth was ceremonially presented with a baton by Emmeline Pankhurst, and proceeded to conduct the whole gathering in singing it. Smyth was active in promoting the performance of the song throughout the WSPU's membership.Purvis (2002), pp. 159‚Äì160 It became the anthem of the women's suffrage movement throughout the United Kingdom.Collis (1984), p.104 A famous rendering of it took place in 1912, at Holloway Prison, after many women activists were imprisoned as a result of a window-smashing campaign. Smyth's part in this had been to break the window of Lewis Harcourt, the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Norris in The Daily Telegraph, 31 July 2008 The conductor Thomas Beecham visited Smyth in prison and reported that he found the activists in the courtyard \\"...marching round it and singing lustily their war-chant while the composer, beaming approbation from an overlooking upper window, beat time in almost Bacchic frenzy with a toothbrush.\\" While imprisoned in April 1913, Emmeline Pankhurst undertook a hunger strike which she did not expect to survive. She told Smyth that at night she would feebly sing \\"The March of the Women\\" and another of Smyth's compositions, \\"Laggard Dawn\\".Purvis (2002), p. 217  Arrangements  Emmeline Pankhurst's statue, now the Pankhurst Memorial, unveiled in 1930 as Smyth conducted \\"The March of the Women\\" Smyth arranged the work several times. A version for choir and optional orchestra was included in Songs of Sunrise, a collection of three songs premiered on 1 April 1911 at the Queen's Hall, London. The other two songs in the collection were \\"Laggard Dawn\\" and \\"1910\\". An arrangement of \\"The March of the Women\\" for solo piano appeared in 1914 in King Albert's Book, a fund-raising publication for Belgian relief. On 6 March 1930, Smyth conducted a version of the march for military band, on the occasion of the unveiling of a statue to memorialize Emmeline Pankhurst in Victoria Tower Gardens. The ceremony was presided over by Stanley Baldwin, and the performance was by the band of the Metropolitan Police.Purvis (2002), p. 357 The tune of \\"The March of the Women\\" also appears in the overture of Smyth's opera The Boatswain's Mate.Fuller (1994), p. 294  See also  *List of compositions by Ethel Smyth  References  Sources    *  External links  *\\"The March of the Women\\" lyrics Category:1910 songs Category:Compositions by Ethel Smyth Category:Emmeline Pankhurst Category:Progressive Era in the United States Category:Songs with feminist themes Category:Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom ","title":"The March of the Women"},{"id":"26631556","text":"Joseph Robert Wilson (born 16 January 1965) was an English cricketer.

It also goes under the names of Bohnen, Birnen und Speck and, locally, the Low German names of Gr√∂√∂ner Hein and Gr√∂nen Heini. The ingredients required mean that the dish is mainly eaten in the months of August and September. The dish is a type of stew, in which‚Äîas the name indicates‚Äîthe main ingredients are pears, beans and bacon. In North German country kitchens, potatoes would also be added, even though they are not specifically mentioned.  Ingredients  Generally cut French beans (Brechbohnen) are used. In Hamburg on the markets occasionally \\"Turkish peas\\" may be found, despite its name a Vierlande bean variety that used to be frequently used for this dish. During preparation several sprigs of savory are added to the beans. The pears used for this dish are cooking pears which would otherwise be inedible eaten as fruit in their own right. They are small, green, rock-hard and do not have the sweetness and juiciness of the popular eating varieties. These pears are mainly found at markets and in small vegetable shops. In the Hamburg area, other varieties are used: the Vierl√§nder and the rather sweeter Finkenwerder cooking pears. The Vierl√§nder sort have a slightly firmer consistency after cooking which is preferred by many. These cooking pears are only available from July to September, subject to the weather. As a last resort for those who have missed the right season, B√ºrgermeisterbirne pears may be used. They are not as sweet when raw and are clearly sweeter. The bacon used is streaky, smoky bacon. Here, too, it is important if the dish is to taste its best not to use 'any old bacon'. The origin‚Äîwhether from the Vierlande, the Black Forest or Tyrol‚Äîis immaterial; all of them are suitable and offer a variety of interesting flavours. The deciding factor is the storage of the bacon. Only streaky bacon that has been air-dried and stored produces when cooked that pleasant taste of seasoned fat that melts in the mouth. Bacon, which‚Äîas is common today‚Äîhas been stored hygienically in its vacuum wrapper, only produces a sort of fibrous stringiness after being cooked. The Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein preference is to add potatoes to their Bohnen, Birnen und Speck that are still firm when cooked‚Äîsuch as the Cilena or Linda varieties. In Land Hadeln beef or lamb can also be cooked along with the bacon.  Preparation  According to taste, the bacon is placed either in complete strips or cut up into water which is then brought to the boil. Meanwhile, the beans are cleaned, washed and cut into sections. After 25 minutes of cooking, the beans are added together with the savory to the bacon and cooking continues. The flowers are removed from the pears, but the stalks are left on. The pears are left with their skins on throughout. They are then laid on the beans and everything is cooked together. The peeled potatoes are boiled separately in salted water. Towards the end of the overall cooking time of about 50 minutes, some flour is mixed with water, poured into the pot and briefly boiled up. Typical quantities for four people are: *750 g beans *500 g pears *400 g bacon *500 g potatoes *1 sprig of savory *2 tablespoons of flour Each person is served one or two pears, a good portion of bacon, beans and potatoes and broth according to preference. A fresh beer goes well with the dish. There are variations that do away with the savory, but add freshly chopped parsley towards the end, which use broth instead of water for cooking (ready-made or home-made) or which use pepper.

Racing career=Early career Imperial Commander's first race was at Summerhill point-to-point in Ireland on 24 April 2005, a race he won by 8 lengths. His next racecourse appearance and first under rules was a National Hunt flat race at Cheltenham on 25 October 2006. This too he won, and already he was being described as a 'future chaser on looks' by the Racing Post. He garnered one victory over hurdles, a ¬£2000 race at Newcastle in January 2007, but failed to win at Graded level, including attempts at the 2007 Cheltenham and Aintree festivals (although he was placed at the latter). As a steeplechaser As predicted by the Racing Post, it was as a chaser that his career really took off. He was victorious in his first two chases, both at Cheltenham in late 2007, and he won again in the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham in November 2008, when he was ridden by Paddy Brennan for the first time. Returning to the Cheltenham Festival in 2009, he won the Ryanair Chase by 2 lengths from Voy Por Ustedes at odds of 6/1. The following season he met former Cheltenham Gold Cup champion, Kauto Star, in the 2009 Betfair Chase at Haydock, and was beaten by a mere nose. He was less successful in that season's King George where he was below par, trailing in a 64 length 5th to the same horse, after nearly unseating Brennan at the second fence. At Cheltenham the following March, he got his revenge. Again ridden by Paddy Brennan, Imperial Commander won the 2010 Cheltenham Gold Cup, beating favourites and previous champions Kauto Star and Denman. Defending his title in 2011, he hit the fourth-last fence and was soon pulled up. He was found to be lame, and was not seen again on a racecourse for nearly two years. A comeback second in the 2013 Argento Chase at Cheltenham showed he was 'set to remain competitive in top company' and a tilt at the Grand National was mooted. Thus, as a 12-year-old, Imperial Commander ran in the 2013 Grand National as the top weight, ridden by his trainer's son, Sam Twiston-Davies. He went well for a circuit but dropped away quickly soon after and was pulled up.

She was laid down in July 1884 and launched in October 1888; work proceeded so slowly that she was not finished until February 1893. She was armed with a main battery of four guns and had a top speed of , though this high speed came at the cost of armor protection. Re Umberto carried out various duties during her service career, including large-scale fleet maneuvers and diplomatic missions in Europe. She saw limited action during the Italo-Turkish War in 1911‚Äì1912, escorting convoys and bombarding Ottoman troops in North Africa. By the end of the year she was withdrawn from front-line service. Decommissioned before World War I, she was used during the war as a depot ship and then as a floating battery. In 1918 her armament was exchanged for a number of guns and trench mortars as part of her role as the lead ship in the planned Italian assault on the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola. The war ended before the Italians could carry out the attack and she was stricken again in 1920. Design Line-drawing of the Re Umberto class Re Umberto was long overall; she had a beam of and an average draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical compound steam engines, each driving a single screw propeller, with steam supplied by eighteen coal-fired, cylindrical fire-tube boilers. Her engines produced a top speed of at . Specific figures for her cruising radius have not survived, but the ships of her class could steam for at a speed of . She had a crew of 733 officers and men.Gardiner, p. 342 Re Umberto was armed with a main battery of four 30-caliber guns, mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one on either end of the ship. She carried a secondary battery of eight 40-cal. guns placed singly in shielded mounts atop the upper deck, with four on each broadside. Close- range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of sixteen guns in casemates in the upper deck, eight on each broadside. These were supported by sixteen 43-cal. guns and ten guns. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she carried five torpedo tubes in above-water launchers. The ship was lightly armored for her size. She was protected by belt armor that was thick, an armored deck that was thick, and her conning tower was armored with of steel plate. The turrets had 4 in thick faces and the supporting barbettes had thick steel. Service history Re Umberto in dry dock c. 1897 Re Umberto was named after the Italian King Umberto I of Italy. Re Umberto was built by the Castellammare Naval Shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia, Naples. Her keel was laid down on 10 July 1884. After over four years of construction, she was launched on 17 October 1888. Following sea trials, the battleship was formally commissioned into the Regia Marina on 16 February 1893. At the time Re Umberto was commissioned into the Regia Marina, the navy maintained two battleship squadrons; the Active Squadron and the Reserve Squadron. The ships alternated between the two in February of each year; in 1895, Re Umberto was assigned to the Reserve Squadron, along with the older battleships , , and .Brassey (1896), p. 65 In June 1895, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in Germany was completed; to celebrate, dozens of warships from 14 different countries gathered in Kiel for a celebration hosted by Kaiser Wilhelm II.Brassey (1896), p. 132 Re Umberto was one of four battleships in the flotilla that represented Italy.Brassey (1896), p. 134 All three ships of the class participated in the 1896 Naval Maneuvers in the Tyrrhenian Sea.Brassey (1897), p. 175 In February 1897, Re Unberto deployed to Crete to serve in the International Squadron, a multinational force made up of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Regia Marina, Imperial Russian Navy, and British Royal Navy that intervened in the 1897‚Äì1898 Greek uprising on Crete against rule by the Ottoman Empire. She arrived as part of an Italian division that also included her sister ship Sicilia (flagship of the division's commander, Vice Admiral Felice Napoleone Canevaro), the protected cruiser , and the torpedo cruiser .Robinson, p. 187 For 1903, the Active Squadron was on active service for seven months, with the rest of the year spent with reduced crews.Brassey (1903), p. 60 In 1904‚Äì1905, Re Umberto and her sisters were in service with the Active Squadron, which was kept in service for nine months of the year, with three months in reduced commission.\\"Naval Notes ‚Äì Italy\\", p. 1429 The following year, the ships were transferred to the Reserve Squadron, along with the three s and the ironclad , three cruisers, and sixteen torpedo boats. This squadron only entered active service for two months of the year for training maneuvers, and the rest of the year was spent with reduced crews.Brassey (1905), p. 45 Re Umberto was still in the Reserve Squadron in 1908, along with her two sisters and the two s. By this time, the Reserve Squadron was kept in service for seven months of the year.Brassey (1908), p. 52 Italo-Turkish War Map showing the bombardment of Tripoli On 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya.Beehler, p. 6 At the time, Re Umberto and her two sisters were assigned to the Training Division, along with the old armored cruiser , under the command of Rear Admiral Raffaele Borea Ricci D'Olmo.Beehler, p. 10 On 3‚Äì4 October, Re Umberto and her sisters were tasked with bombarding Fort Sultanje, which was protecting the western approach to Tripoli. The ships used their 6-inch guns to attack the fort to preserve their stock of 13.5-inch shells. By the morning of the 4th, the ships' gunfire had silenced the guns in the fort, allowing landing forces to go ashore and capture the city.Beehler, pp. 19‚Äì20 The ships of the Training Division thereafter alternated between Tripoli and Khoms to support the Italian garrisons in the two cities.Beehler, pp. 34, 37 In November, Re Umberto, Sicilia, the torpedo cruiser , the destroyer , and the torpedo boat bombarded the oasis at Taguira, though no Turkish forces were present. The Italians then sent a garrison to protect the oasis.Beehler, p. 48 By December, the three ships were stationed in Tripoli, where they were replaced by the old ironclads Italia and Lepanto. Re Umberto and her sisters arrived back in La Spezia, where they had their ammunition and supplies replenished.Beehler, p. 47 In May 1912, the Training Division patrolled the coast, but saw no action.Beehler, p. 77 The following month, Re Umberto and her sisters, along with six torpedo boats, escorted a convoy carrying an infantry brigade to Buscheifa, one of the last ports in Libya still under Ottoman control. The Italian force arrived off the town on 14 June and made a landing; after taking the city, the Italian forces then moved on to Misrata. Re Umberto and the rest of the ships continued supporting the advance until the Italians had secured the city on 20 July.Beehler, p. 81 The Training Division then returned to Italy, where they joined the escort for another convoy on 3 August, this time to Zuara, the last port in Ottoman hands. The ships covered the landing two miles east of Zuara two days later, which was joined by supporting attacks from the west and south. With the capture of the city, Italy now controlled the entire Libyan coast.Beehler, pp. 90‚Äì91 On 14 October the Ottomans agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war.Beehler, p. 95 Later career Re Umberto was laid up in Genoa in 1912 and became a depot ship. Towed to La Spezia in June 1915, after having been stricken from the Navy List on 10 May 1914, she became a depot ship for the dreadnought . She was reinstated on 9 December 1915 and became a floating battery at Brindisi and, later, Valona, Albania. In 1918, Re Umberto was tasked to lead the planned assault on the primary Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola and modified for the role by the removal of her armament and the addition of eight 3-inch guns with gun shields as well as a number of trench mortars. A special saw and cutters were also installed to deal with the harbor boom and net defenses. The war ended before the Italians could carry out the attack and she was again stricken on 4 July 1920.

It is native to much of the Northern Hemisphere from Eurasia to Alaska to Greenland and south into mountainous central North America. It has stiff, glossy green, erect fronds and grows in moist, shady, rocky mountain habitats. Description nature print of Polystichum lonchitis This tufted fern produces several erect, linear fronds up to long. The fronds are glossy and stiff, pinnate, with many lance-shaped to oblong pinnae (leaflets) up to long, the longest ones occurring near the midpoint of the frond, the basal ones being smaller and triangular in shape. The pinnae overlap each other slightly and are toothed with outward-pointing spiny margins. The sori are rounded, with a white covering, and are arranged in two rows on the underside of the pinnae. This is a slow-growing, long- lived plant. Distribution and habitat Holly fern is an arctic-alpine species with a circumpolar boreal and montane distribution in the Northern Hemisphere. It grows best in calcareous soil in cool, damp locations at the base of cliffs, on rock ledges, among boulders and in deep cavities in limestone pavements. In the British Isles it occurs in Scotland and the western fringes of England, Wales and Ireland, and at scattered locations elsewhere. It occurs at a single location in Northern Ireland, at Lough Navar Forest Park in County Fermanagh, and because of its rarity there, it is listed as a Northern Ireland Priority Species.

New York: Facts on File (U.S. ed.)/Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Andromeda Oxford Ltd. (U.K.) Biography Born in Tabriz into the Afshar tribe, one of the Turkish tribal groups that engendered the Safavid rise to power, Sadiqi was a soldier by family tradition. In 1568, however, he asked his pupil and nephew Muzaftar Ali, reputedly an incomparable figure painter, to teach him the art of the well-known earlier artist Bihzad.Basil Gray, Chapter 16(b) in The Cambridge History of Iran (in Seven Volumes), vol. 6, Peter Jackson and Laurence Lockhart, ed., p. 889-900. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986, Sadiqi's native language was Chaghatai, and he wrote biographical sketches of some of the era's leading poets, artists and connoisseurs in that language. He also wrote the famous Qanun as-Suwar (Canons of Painting) between 1576 and 1602, a treatise on painting techniques in Persian verse. His writings are one of the major sources on the history of Persian miniature painting. He reportedly \\"painted thousands of marvellous portraits\\". Sadiqi was head of the royal library in Qazwin from 1587 to 1598, under Shah Abbas I, whom he had impressed years earlier. He had previously served under Shah Isma'il II, who ruled from 1576 to 1577, after which he withdrew to Hamadan and later to Lahijan and to Yazd. Examples of Sadiqi's work are in a number of museums. A 3-inch by 6-inch (7.62 cm by 15.24 cm) gouache miniature on gold paper, Portrait d'une jeune femme assise sur un rocher, attributed to Sadiqi from 1590, sold at auction in Paris in 1996 for 80,000 French francs (15,792 U.S. dollars; 12,604 euros; or 10,301 British pounds).Artinfo.com Some scholars, such as B. W. Robinson, attribute the 107 miniatures in a 1593 version of Anwar i-Suhayli (a book of fables) to Sadiqi, although others, such as Basil Gray, think that they appear to be by several artists, not all of the same quality. The manuscript, in the collection of the Marquess of Bute, is inscribed to \\"Sadiqi Beg, the rarity of the age, the second Mani, the Bihzad of the time\\". Overbearing and outspoken, he fell from office in 1598, although he retained his title and salary. His last royal work was on an edition of the Shahnameh (Book of Kings), part of which is at the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin.

General characteristics RRAT J1819-1458 exhibits sporadic pulses of radio emission. It has a rotation period of 4.26 seconds and a slow-down rate which implies it has a dipole magnetic field strength higher than all other RRATs. In fact its magnetic field is stronger than the quantum critical limit. Its pulses are the brightest of all the RRATs and of the original 11 sources it has the highest burst rate. The pulsar has three emission phases in one period, and most intense pulses are from the middle phase. Many pulses are observed 'double- peaked' which are mostly in the middle emission phase. The pulse intensity distribution is reported similar to some normal pulsars and 'giant pulse' pulsars suggesting similar emission mechanisms. X-ray extended emission around RRAT J1819‚àí1458 is found, which can be interpreted with a nebula somehow powered by the pulsar. There is a possible candidate counterpart for RRAT J1819‚àí1458. It has been observed at X-ray wavelengths in observations using the Chandra and XMM Newton X-ray telescopes where an X-ray spectrum typical of thermal emission from a cooling neutron was observed. Modulation of the X-ray light at the 4.26 second rotation period is also observed indicating that there are hot spots on the surface of the star, i.e. the temperature distribution is not uniform.

Recorded on 15 and 16 November 1989 in Wyastone Leys near Monmouth, Wales, the album features a sarangi performance of the solemn night raga Shankara and a ragamala (\\"garland of ragas\\") based on the introspective early morning raga Jogiya (or Jogia). On both tracks, Narayan performs a long non-metrical introduction to unfold the raga, during which he adds a pulse, until he is joined by the tabla (percussion) player to perform a composition. Origin The album consists of performances of the ragas Shankara and Jogiya (also called Jogia); Jogiya is performed in raga mala form. Shankara is considered a solemn and dignified raga that is difficult to master. It has been described by Vamanrao Deshpande as representing the \\"heroic mood\\". Luiz Martinez Jos√© argued that the raga was named for a gentle and guarding incarnation of the Hindu deity Shiva. Shankara is performed in the late night and distinguished by an emphasis on the third (Ga) and seventh (Ni) notes, the upper tetrachord, and several characteristic phrases and slow glides in descend. It has similarities to the South Indian raga Hansadhvani. Jogiya is considered an introspective raga named for the yogi practice, and is often performed in devotional music and the light classical genre thumri.Bor 1999, p. 92 Peter Manuel described it as the most important raga of the Bhairav that (raga class based on the Bhairav scale type). Jogiya is performed at daybreak and emphasizes the tonic (Sa) and the fifth (Pa). It has several characteristic phrases and, like Shankara, is suited for the upper tetrachord. Joep Bor argued that the raga appears to be related to raga Asavari. Jogiya is one of Narayan's favorite ragas. A raga mala (\\"garland of ragas\\") allows for the introduction of other ragas, which can be from any time of the day.Bor 1999, p. 181 The change from Jogiya into another raga and back must be smooth as there is no break in the music, making a raga mala difficult to perform. Recording and artwork Rag Shankara, Rag Mala in Jogia was recorded on 15 and 16 November 1989 in Wyastone Leys near Monmouth, Wales. Narayan begins the performances by playing a long alap (non-metrical introduction) and jor (performance with pulse). The tabla player then joins Narayan in performing a composition, repeating the rhythmic cycle on which the composition is based and playing occasional improvisations. The album cover features a painting made ca. 1760 in Murshidabad in the provincial Mughal style of Bengal. It depicts a young woman sitting next to a lake, playing on a rudra veena to a parakeet, which symbolizes her absent lover. A picture of Narayan with his sarangi, taken by Joseph Stieger, is on the back of the album. Reception Allmusic critic Ken Hunt described Narayan's performance of \\"Rag Shankara\\" as \\"ideal for the night hours\\" and R. S. Murthi of the New Straits Times argued that the album showcased the \\"delicate tone\\" of the sarangi and its capacity for \\"seductive lyricism\\".

After being re-elected in 1996, he served as Parliamentary Undersecretary for Works, EPC, and the Water Authority, before being appointed to Cabinet as Minister of Justice Between 1998 and 2001, he served as Minister of Agriculture. Since 2006 he has been a backbench MP. In December 2008 he became a founding member of the Tautua Samoa Party. As a result, in May 2009 he was one of nine Tautua MPs declared to have resigned their seats under an anti-party hopping law. He was subsequently reinstated after the Supreme Court of Samoa overturned the law and declared the formation of new parties legal. In January 2010 new anti-party-hopping laws came into force, barring MPs from declaring their support for political parties or organizations with political aims other than the party they were elected for. In March 2010, he joined Lealailepule Rimoni Aiafi and Palusalue Fa‚Äôapo II in formally declaring his membership of the party and so was deemed to have resigned his seat. However, the HRPP was unable to find a candidate for the resulting by-election, and on 2 May 2010 he was declared elected unopposed, becoming the first non-HRPP MP to win a by-election. Vailupe won his seat in the 2011 election, but the result was overturned by an electoral petition, which found him guilty of bribery and treating.

The 55-minute film was first broadcast on August 6, 1996 on the PBS television series POV. Synopsis Taken for a Ride begins with interviews on the inefficiencies and congestion on Los Angeles' highways. Next, the film displays a variety of archival footage on streetcar systems around the United States, asserting that streetcars were a widespread and efficient means of transportation. The film continues into a description of the General Motors streetcar conspiracy, starting with a history of National City Lines and Pacific City Lines and General Motors' investment in both companies. The film builds the argument that streetcar systems purchased by these companies were deliberately sabotaged through service reductions and fare increases, then replaced with profitable, less convenient, bus systems. Next, the film makes a connection between this conspiracy and the construction of the Interstate Highway System and the suburbanization of America in the face of the Highway revolts in the 1960s and 1970s. The film ends with footage of the reduction of Philadelphia's trolleybus system at the time of filming. Analysis Taken for a Ride was described by Caryn James as \\"an uneven documentary\\" whose \\"nostalgia for the streetcar system as a glorious, clean model of efficiency seems addled rather than convincing\\".

DJ lighting is generally used by mobile disco DJs and in most modern nightclubs and many late-night bars. There are many different types of DJ lighting such as scanners which use a mirror to reflect beams of light that move around, twister-style effects that project multiple beams of light that rotate in a twisting style and also strobe lighting that flash intensely. DJ lighting can be controlled by an internal sound activation, where the unit has a built-in sound to light function. Other control options are master-slave (daisy chain) and DMX control.  Types of DJ lighting  It is generally considered that there are four types of DJ lighting.  Party lights  In the DJ equipment industry, any party disco light that is designed and sold for home use is considered a party DJ light or a party disco light.  Retro lights  In the early days of disco, the main types of disco light were colorful rotating balls. They looked very much like a mirrorball with multi- coloured par 16 lamps in them.  Projectors  With the technology of halogen lamps improving, the 80s and early 90s saw a new breed of DJ light starting to evolve. This was a projection-style DJ light that used a halogen lamp and a mirror to reflect the light. A halogen lamp shines onto a mirror via a filter gel sheet to create the color and sometimes via a gobo wheel to create shapes. In some DJ lighting effects a coloured mirror is used to avoid using color/filter gel. Most modern projector DJ lights now use LEDs instead of halogen lamps.  Lasers  Lasers are a relatively new type of DJ light. They use a laser diode and an array of mirrors to project multiple colours and beams of light.

He married the elder daughter of Marcus Fabius Ambustus. An anecdote frequently told said that his wife's sister, the younger daughter of Fabius, who was married to the plebeian Gaius Licinius Stolo, urged on her husband to procure the consulship for plebeians through the Lex Licinia Sextia, as she was jealous of the honors of her sister's husband. As early as the turn of the 19th century, the German historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr pointed out the historical untrustworthiness and contradictions in this tale.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita vi. 32‚Äî34, 36, 38Barthold Georg Niebuhr, History of Rome vol. iii. pp. 2, 3 References Category:4th-century BC Romans Praetextatus, Servius Sulpicius Category:Roman consular tribunes ","title":"Servius Sulpicius Praetextatus"},{"id":"26632083","text":"Donald Croom Beatty (April 11, 1900 - July 12, 1980) was an American aviator, explorer, and inventor. Beatty was the son of Isaac Beatty, Jr and Hughie Duffee Beatty of Birmingham, Alabama (United States). He began his flying career as a teenager by soloing a small plane he constructed himself with a motorcycle engine at his grandfather's farm near Tarrant on June 16, 1916. The flight ended with a crash landing. Not long afterward he designed and constructed a hand-powered submarine which he sank in Homewood's Edgewood Lake. After a year at Marion Military Institute, Beatty got permission from his father to enlist in the United States Navy at age 17. He was sent to the Navy Radio School set up at Harvard University. In 1919 the United Fruit Company hired him to construct and install wireless (radio) telegraphy equipment along its steamer routes in Asia. He reportedly constructed the first voice radio station in mainland China during that engagement. Alabama radio and aviation After returning to Alabama, Beatty joined James Meissner and a few fellow aviators to form the \\"Birmingham Flying Club\\" in 1919 at their own \\"Roberts Field\\". The unit was recognized as the 135th Observation Squadron, the state's first Air National Guard unit, on January 21, 1922. Beatty qualified as a military pilot at Maxwell Field in Montgomery and, in 1924, was commissioned as a 1st Lieutenant in the United States Army Air Corps. In 1921 Beatty constructed Alabama's first experimental voice radio station, then called WIAG on the second floor of the Matthews Electric building. He used the station to broadcast weather reports to the few receiver-equipped pilots in range and had his flying student and girlfriend Mary Alice Gatling play the piano in the broadcast booth (presumably the first live broadcast of music in Alabama). An improved radio circuit Beatty developed for the station was the subject of his first U. S. patent, awarded in 1922. South American expedition In 1929, Beatty recruited investors from Birmingham and New Orleans, Louisiana to back a trade delegation by air to South America. He would serve as director and pilot with Robb C. Oertel as co-pilot, Leslie Walker as navigator, and Martel Brett, a Birmingham Age- Herald reporter, as historian. Hopes for the flight, which were widely publicized, were dashed by the Wall Street Crash of 1929. In 1931 Beatty re- launched his ambitions for an expedition to South America, adding the enticement of exploration of the interior of the continent to his plans. He secured the cooperation of Major Leslie Barbrook of the National Geographic Society and William Stirling, chief ethnologist for the Smithsonian Institution, and approached J. P. Morgan for financing. With a $25,000 check in hand he and his wife attended the christening of the \\"Simon Bolivar\\" amphibious airplane at Roosevelt Field in New York on October 18 of that year. Months of privation in the jungle were punctuated by careful movements across tribal boundaries into Ecuador. The group made the first photographs and motion-picture recordings of the native Jivaro (Shuar) people, known then primarily as head-hunters. A miscommunication about the team's desire to record the shrinking of a Howler monkey head resulted, to their horror, in them witnessing the process performed on the head of their former packbearer, Sunga. Beatty occasionally used his radio equipment and Stirling used a kit of chemical substances to awe and frighten the natives. Eventually the expedition boarded rafts for the long journey down the Amazon River. In addition to their photographs, the expedition collected numerous artifacts and live animal specimens. A \\"tiger cub\\" (jaguar) sent by Beatty to his 6-year-old daughter was soon turned over to the Birmingham Zoo at Avondale Park, where it was found to be particularly uncooperative with the public. The success of the expedition led to Beatty's induction as a \\"fellow\\" to both The Explorers Club of New York and the Royal Geographical Society. Panagra Pan American-Grace Airways (Panagra) recruited Beatty to lead the search for a downed plane in the Andes. He piloted a Fairchild 71 monoplane wearing an early pressurized flight suit for his hundreds of search flights over the mountains. The site was buried in snow throughout Beatty's search and finally found by prospecting natives after an unusually warm summer. Nevertheless, his experience and the geographical and detailed flight information he recorded allowed Beatty to develop air routes and safety practices for commercial flights across the mountains. He implemented the first system for air-to-ground voice communications and his recommendation for pilots to report their grid-square location at 5-minute intervals was widely adopted and is credited with saving many lives. Another recommendation to vary routes seasonally to avoid dangerous climate conditions was also instrumental in making commercial flights viable in mountainous regions. In 1933, while Beatty was piloting a Panagra passenger flight from Los Cerillos airfield in Santiago, Chile through the Uspallata Pass, a sudden strong wind (Clear-air turbulence) carried the craft above 26,000 feet, setting an altitude record for a passenger flight in an unpressurized cabin. The passengers and crew used breathing tubes connected to oxygen tanks, but when the incident prolonged the flight, the oxygen was reserved for the crew only, causing the passengers to lose consciousness. The pass is sometimes called \\"Beatty Pass\\" in recognition of his development of the route. In 1935 Beatty, piloting a Sikorsky S-43, set a speed record for a flight between the continental United States and the Panama Canal Zone. In 1938 Beatty was forced to land a Panagra amphibious flight in the Pacific Ocean after his equipment was damaged by a lightning strike. He landed successfully and dropped anchor. After receiving fuel and supplies from another seaplane, he successfully took off in the rough seas and completed the flight. CAA and Consairway In 1939 Beatty returned to the United States as the appointed Senior Air Safety Investigator for the Civil Aeronautics Authority. He reported for duty in Santa Monica, California on July 1, 1939 and made reports on all non-military aviation incidents in the western states. Before World War II, Beatty accepted an offer from Consolidated Aircraft of San Diego, California to direct its flight testing and delivery operations worldwide. The program he set up in 1941 between California and Australia was designated \\"Consairway\\" and, using precautionary protocols Beatty initiated, the civilian-manned program suffered no losses in its hundreds of flights across enemy-controlled seaways. Consairway rapidly expanded into a major ferrying operation which delivered flight crews and material to combat zones. Beatty invented the use of barometric readings to adjust flight paths en route over the Pacific, now a standard fuel conservation practice. His training of pilots from experience in mountainous terrain proved especially critical in the Pacific theater as air routes over the Himalayas were the only means of getting freight into China. Meanwhile, Beatty himself relocated to Elizabeth City, North Carolina to oversee Consolidated's modification of aircraft for leasing to European powers. In order to overcome a bottleneck in outfitting the Royal Air Force he established a Convair flight crew training facility in Bermuda. In 1944 Beatty left to work for the Platt-LePage Aircraft Company in Eddystone, Pennsylvania. He contributed to the top-secret development of the XR-1 dual-rotor helicopter, the first helicopter used by the United States Air Force. 1940s inventions As his involvement at Platt-LePage waned, Beatty pursued numerous patents for new inventions, primarily relating to electronic circuits for communications. The first invention to go to market, however, was a type of highway signage that would indicate progress along the route and the expected travel time to the next destination city. His \\"Minute Maps\\", as they were called, were put into service on several routes in Alabama and the mid- Atlantic. Beatty was awarded the first patent for a circuit to allow telephone callers to leave messages when calls were unanswered. Utilizing a wire recorder, the device was marketed as the \\"Tele-Mat\\" telecorder by the Pentron Corporation and sold for $250; located in the Atwell Building (designed by Alfred S. Alschuler) at 221 E. Cullerton St., Chicago, Illinois, the Pentron Corp. was one of the largest producers of audio tape recorders carried under the brand names of such firms as Montgomery Ward, Sears, Emerson Radio, Westinghouse, and Motorola. Beatty's other telephone-related innovations included the first automated dialer and a hands-free telephone set. Hayes and GAALT Beatty signed on as the first employee of Birmingham's Hayes Aircraft Corporation in 1951 and was made head of the company's research and development in electronic equipment in 1958. While there he patented the \\"Gain-Adjusting Audio Level Terminator\\" (GAALT), a solid-state amplifier used to improve the Signal-to-noise ratio in electronic communications. The device was widely adopted, even appearing on the Kennedy Presidential Train. It was used by NASA for the Echo 1 communications satellite launched on August 12, 1960 and has found its way into a wide range of orbiting and terrestrial signaling devices ever since. The Alabama Power Company even adapted the technology to allow for sending company signals through its power lines, eliminating the need for separate telephone communications (a parallel to its earlier adoption of Beatty's radio station.) Later life Beatty retired to his home in Mountain Brook, where he was surrounded by his Amazonian artifacts and other mementos of aviation and exploring. The OX-5 Aviation Pioneers named him their \\"Man of the Year\\" in 1973. Architect Fritz Woehle was given Beatty's permission to reconstruct the decor of his living room as part of an exhibit at the Birmingham Festival of Arts' 1975 Salute to Brazil. In 1978 he and his wife agreed to donate their nearly 300 Jivano artifacts to the Smithsonian Institution, which previously had only a small collection of Stirling's souvenirs from the 1930s expedition. The donation led to the couple being awarded the James Smithson Medal, the Smithsonian's highest honor. Beatty suffered a stroke on his 80th birthday and died in Birmingham three months later. He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery. Beatty was inducted into the Alabama Aviation Hall of Fame at the Southern Museum of Flight in 1982 and the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame in 1992.

The Security Council noted positive developments around Sarajevo as a first step towards restoring peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There was an agreement between Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bosnian Serbs and the Secretary-General's Special Representative on a ceasefire and heavy weapons which was welcomed, given the measures taken in resolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993). It was crucial that citizens and humanitarian relief could move freely and that normal life could be resumed. The United Kingdom and the United States therefore sent a joint mission to Sarajevo to assess the restoration process. The Council stated the city of Sarajevo was important as the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina and as a multicultural, multiethnic, and religious centre. Furthermore, the resolution welcomed the rotation of the United Nations Protection Force's staff in Srebrenica and the reopening of Tuzla International Airport. There was concern also for the deteriorating situation in Maglaj, Mostar and Vitez. The Council also stressed the importance of the observance of international humanitarian law. All parties were called to co-operate with UNPROFOR with regards to the ceasefire around Sarajevo and to work to help with restore normal life in the city. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was asked to appoint a senior civilian official to draw up an action plan for the restoration of public services in the Sarajevo area, excluding Pale. He was also requested to establish a voluntary trust fund for which countries could contribute to. Within a week he was required to report on ways to achieve the aforementioned objectives and the costs involved, and to report in 10 days on developments relating to the protection of Maglaj, Mostar and Vitez.

Management career=The Football Association As Commercial Director, and latterly Director of Marketing and Communications, for The Football Association (The FA), Paul Barber created \\"FA Partners\\", The FA's sponsorship programme for 2002‚Äì2006 which secured multi million-pound agreements with McDonald's, Pepsi, Carlsberg, Nationwide Building Society, British Airways, Giorgio Armani, Sainsbury's, and Umbro, while shielding The FA's prime assets - The FA Cup and England teams - from title sponsors. Barber secured The FA Council's agreement to rename The Charity Shield as The FA Community Shield to better connect a top sponsor to both the grass roots football community and the highest levels of the game, a sponsorship concept Barber later sold to McDonald's. FA Partners included sponsorship of women's football, courtesy of Nationwide Building Society, for the first time, as well as significant support for grass roots football, an area of the game Barber is believed to be passionate about. Barber led negotiations for The FA's various long term broadcast media agreements with BSkyB, BBC and ITV ensuring a terrestrial broadcast platform for The FA's major properties and innovative sports coverage from BSkyB together with rights fees worth several hundred million pounds. Following in the footsteps of close friend and former FA chief executive, David Davies, Barber often acted as The FA's public face during a high profile and at times highly controversial period for the organisation which included the last match at the old Wembley Stadium, the appointment of Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson as England coach, Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand's missed drugs test, a threatened England players strike ahead of the crucial European Championship 2014 qualifier in Turkey, and the resignation of chief executive Adam Crozier. Following The FA's decision to re-build Wembley Stadium, Barber was tasked with finding alternative venues for England's matches, for The FA Cup Final and for The FA Community Shield. Barber's answer was the commercially successful and highly popular 'England on the Road' programme which saw England's senior team and under 21 internationals taken to different English stadiums, including Old Trafford, Anfield, White Hart Lane, Stadium of Light, St James's Park, St Mary's Stadium, Pride Park, and Villa Park during the new Wembley Stadium's construction. The FA Cup Final and The FA Community Shield was moved to Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. During the same period Barber led the development of England fans, the FA's official supporters' scheme. Barber's international football experience extends to him being a senior member of England's official travelling party to major tournaments including UEFA's European Championships in 2000 (in the Netherlands and Belgium) under Kevin Keegan's management, and to the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and Korea when England were led by Sven Goran Eriksson. From 1997 Barber acted as a part-time adviser for The FA's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to stage the World Cup in England in 2006 and, latterly, he provided part-time support from his base in Vancouver for The FA's similarly unsuccessful and controversial 2018 bid campaign. Tottenham Hotspur FC As Executive Director at Tottenham Hotspur of the Premier League Barber was responsible for running the club's day-to-day operations, including all commercial areas, sponsorship, marketing, ticketing, hospitality and the club's international development. He joined the club's board early in 2005 and was tasked with re-shaping and improving the club's commercial structure and building closer relationships with supporter groups. During his time at Tottenham Hotspur, Barber secured the North London club's then-largest ever shirt sponsorship deal ‚Äì worth over ¬£34 million over four years ‚Äì with Gibraltar-based online betting firm, Mansion.com, and agreed international club partnerships with MLS side San Jose Earthquakes and Hong Kong-based South China FC. Barber created One Hotspur ‚Äì the club's supporter membership and season ticket holder programme ‚Äì and was credited by many Tottenham fans for the direct link he provided between supporters and the club's board making himself approachable, responsive and accountable to supporters' queries and questions. Barber worked closely with Daniel Levy to bring manager Harry Redknapp to the club in the late 2008 after a poor start to the 2008‚Äì9 Premier League season under Spanish coach Juande Ramos. Barber resigned from his position as executive director and a member of the board at Tottenham Hotspur early in 2010 to take up an opportunity to become chief executive officer of Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Barber become the first British- born sports executive to lead in a franchise to Major League Soccer, football's top tier in North America. He remained on the board at Tottenham Hotspur as a non-executive director until the mid-2011. Vancouver Whitecaps FC During his tenure at Vancouver Whitecaps FC, one of the oldest and largest professional soccer clubs in North America, Barber inked a number of major sponsorships with telecommunications giant Bell Canada, EA Sports, Budweiser, Kia Motors, BMO Bank of Montreal, Rogers Sportsnet TV, and TEAM 1040 Radio. In all, it was reported in the Canadian media that the club signed a total of 25 new commercial agreements in a 24-month period while Barber was chief executive officer. The Vancouver Whitecaps also became the first MLS club to have all its League and Cup matches broadcast live on TV, radio, mobile and online, while also securing more than 15,000 season ticket holders for its first MLS season, one of the highest in the league. While in Vancouver, Barber oversaw two complex stadium moves in less than 12 months between November 2010 and October 2011. The Whitecaps completed its 2010 season in the 5,000-seat Swangard Stadium in Burnaby, British Columbia, before moving to the temporary but historic Empire Field site in Vancouver (capacity 27,000) in March 2011, and then on to the newly refurbished 2010 Winter Olympic Games venue, BC Place with a 55,000 capacity, a spectacular retractable roof, and the largest centrally hung video board in North America, in October 2011. However, the club was unable to replicate its commercial success on the field of play and struggled throughout its first MLS season, leading to the early dismissal of coach Teitur Thordarson and the subsequent appointments of Tommy Soehn, as interim head coach, and Martin Rennie (who subsequently parted company with the Whitecaps at the end of the 2013 season after two seasons in charge). Brighton & Hove Albion FC Following Vancouver Whitecaps' announcement of his decision to return to the UK in the early 2012, the Barber was linked to various new roles in English football at Premier League clubs, including a return to Tottenham Hotspur, before surprising some industry observers by accepting the opportunity to join Brighton & Hove Albion in the Football League Championship. His move to become their chief executive was announced on 28 May 2012 and was effective 18 June 2012. Barber's role at Brighton has seen him gain first hand experience of The Football League's Championship level for the first time in his career, as well as working at Falmer Stadium, opened in mid-2011, and overseeing the stadium's expansion to a capacity of just over 30,000 in his first full year with the club. In Barber's first season (2012/13), Brighton recorded their highest league finish for more than 30 years and reached the Championship play-offs with some attendances topping 30,000 for the first time since the 1980s. However, a highly successful season was soured by the acrimonious departure of Uruguayan Manager, Gus Poyet, dismissed by the club for gross misconduct. During the same season, Barber announced Brighton & Hove Albion's most valuable ever sponsorship deal when he confirmed at a press conference on 13 March 2013 that American Express had signed a multi-year agreement to be the Club's shirt sponsor for its men's, women's and youth teams. The deal, believed to be worth several millions of pounds to the Championship club, extended American Express's relationship with Albion which started with the US financial services giant's stadium naming rights agreement in 2010. On 19 July 2013, Brighton confirmed the appointment of former Barcelona star, Oscar Garcia Junyent, as head coach for the 2013/14 season. For the second successive year Brighton & Hove Albion secured a Sky Bet Championship play off spot with a 2‚Äì1 victory at Nottingham Forest courtesy of a thrilling last- minute goal in the final game of the season from Argentinian striker, Leonardo Ulloa. Towards the end of 2013, Paul Barber was named overall CEO of the Year at the annual Football Business Awards (on 7 November 2013). Barber also received the award for Football League Championship CEO of the Year at the same event at Chelsea FC's Stamford Bridge stadium in London. Oscar Garcia resigned for personal reasons at the end of the 2013/14 season and working closely with Tony Bloom, Brighton's dynamic young chairman, Barber started another hunt for a manager to lead Brighton to the Premier League. The initial excitement surrounding the June 2014 appointment of former Liverpool captain and Bayer Leverkusen coach, Sami Hyypia, turned sour when Hyypia failed to get the results needed to sustain Brighton's challenge at the top of the Championship. Hyypia resigned after just 6 months and was replaced by the more experienced Chris Hughton on 31 December 2014. Hughton, who had worked with Barber at Tottenham Hotspur, went on to steer Brighton clear of a surprise relegation fight to retain the club's Championship for a fifth successive season. In the mid-2014, Brighton & Hove Albion confirmed its status by opening one of the United Kingdom's best new training and academy facilities completed at a cost of over ¬£30 million. Named as the American Express Elite Football Performance Centre - the club's third long term and lucrative sponsorship agreement with global financial services giant, American Express - the facility houses the club's 1st team, academy and women's football operations. On the back of its surprisingly poor 2014/15 season, Brighton surprised pundits and Championship rivals alike by setting a new club record with an unbeaten run which, to the end of November 2015, extended to 18 league matches and saw the Seagulls top the Sky Bet Championship. In the same month, Brighton enjoyed more success at the 2015 Football Business Awards where the south coast club were named \\"Overall Best Football Club to Work For\\" and \\"Best Community Scheme (non Premier League)\\". The club also received wide acclaimfor its highly successful staging of two Rugby World Cup 2015 fixtures including the historic Japanese victory over South Africa. Brighton & Hove Albion went on to miss out on promotion to the Premier League on goal difference at the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season when they drew 1‚Äì1 at Middlesbrough on the final day, and then failed to get past Sheffield Wednesday in the two-legged Championship play-offs. However, after four EFL Championship play-offs failures in five seasons, the club finally secured automatic promotion to the Premier League in the 2016‚Äì17 season ‚Äì its sixth season at Falmer Stadium ‚Äì but missed out on collecting the Championship title (to Newcastle United) when they drew 1‚Äì1 at Aston Villa on the final day of the season. Brighton & Hove Albion's first Premier League season in 2017‚Äì18 saw them finish 15th reaching the magical 40 point total with a 1‚Äì0 home win over Manchester United and games to spare with the Friday night game broadcast live on Sky Sports. On 19 November 2018, and in addition to his responsibilities as the club's chief executive, Barber was promoted to deputy chairman. Wider business career Recognised as one of English football's most experienced executives Barber has now spent close to 25 years in football administration at all levels of the game including time working for The FA at the 2000 European Championships and the 2002 World Cup, Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League and UEFA Cup, Vancouver Whitecaps FC in Major League Soccer, and Brighton & Hove Albion in England's Football League Championship and in the Premier League. On 22 June 2015, The Football League in England announced that Barber had been elected to its board of directors as one of three Championship representatives. Barber served two years alongside the League's other directors, who included former Rugby World Cup 2015 CEO, Debbie Jevans, and former National Express and Strategic Rail Authority boss, Richard Bowker, before Brighton secured promotion to the Premier League. During this period, Barber was one of the EFL's FA Council members, a member of the Professional Game Board, and one of The FA's international ambassadors. On 7 June 2018, Barber returned to The FA Council as a Premier League representative. In November 2018, Barber was also re-elected to the Professional Game Board, also as a Premier League representative. He also continues to serve as one of The FA's panel of international ambassadors. Prior to his career working in professional football, Barber held a variety of senior executive positions in several large British companies including Barclays Bank, Inchcape, Abbey National, Royal & Sun Alliance, as well as the US advertising and communications group Ogilvy & Mather, where he was Chief Executive Officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Barber served as a Non-Executive Director for Rose Bowl plc, parent company of Hampshire County Cricket Club, for Tottenham Hotspur FC, following his departure for Vancouver Whitecaps FC, and for Nolan Partners Ltd, a UK-based Sports Executive Search & Recruitment firm, established by The FA's former Human Resources Director, Paul Nolan. Barber has spoken at major sports industry and business conferences all over the world, including events in the United States, Canada, Australia, China, Middle East and across Europe. Barber has also delivered lectures and key-note presentations at numerous universities and business schools, including Cambridge University's Judge Business School, and Wharton Business School in the United States, and various other universities and colleges in the UK, Europe and the US.

He is most known for his Game Concerts series, initiated in 2003 as Symphonic Game Music Concerts, historical for being the longest running and the first of their kind outside Japan. He produced the first live performance of video game music by the London Symphony Orchestra, and was presented with the national Cultural and Creative Pilots Award by the German Federal Government, which recognises outstanding entrepreneurs within Germany‚Äôs cultural and creative industries. Early life Thomas B√∂cker spent his childhood growing up in the small mountain town of Lauenstein. Coming from a family of teachers, he developed an appreciation for Classical music from a young age and regularly attended symphonic concerts. Like many others in Europe, he grew up playing the Commodore 64 and Commodore Amiga computers. Soon enough, he developed a passion for video game music and became especially fond of Chris Huelsbeck‚Äôs works on the Turrican series. B√∂cker‚Äôs love for both video game music and Classical artists would soon come together, as he realised the potential for scores and concerts to feature orchestral game music. Concert productions In 2003, Thomas B√∂cker produced the opening ceremony of the Leipzig Games Convention with the First Symphonic Game Music Concert. The event at the sold- out Gewandhaus concert hall was the first of its kind outside Japan and received ten minutes of standing ovations. His annual follow-up concerts gained even more popular and critical appraise with their numerous innovations, expansive programs, refined performances, and special guest appearances. In conjunction with this work, he brought orchestral game music around the world with leading roles on the highly successful concert tours PLAY! A Video Game Symphony and Distant Worlds: Music From Final Fantasy. He also inspired the use of game music for educational purposes, through creating the series of school concerts Heroes of our Imagination in 2006, with Super Mario Galaxy ‚Äì A Musical Adventure being its latest instalment in 2010. Thomas B√∂cker has since developed a long-standing relationship with the London Symphony Orchestra, Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and WDR Radio Orchestra in Cologne. This culminated in the best-selling concert performances Symphonic Fantasies ‚Äì music from Square Enix (2009, 2012, 2016), LEGENDS - music from Nintendo (2011) and the Final Symphony concerts (2013-). As a world's first, B√∂cker‚Äôs productions have been broadcast live to radio listeners worldwide by the WDR and have even been enjoyed internationally through live video streams. In 2012, the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra performed two Symphonic Fantasies concerts at the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan concert hall in Tokyo, Japan, produced by Thomas B√∂cker, with more than 4,600 people in attendance. In May 2012, Thomas B√∂cker announced his tenth major concert production entitled Final Symphony, featuring music from Final Fantasy VI, VII and X. The world premiere of the performance took place on May 11, 2013 and was presented by the Sinfonieorchester Wuppertal. Another performance of the concert took place on May 30, 2013: The first live performance of video game music by the London Symphony Orchestra. Final Symphony had follow-up performances in Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, the USA, New Zealand, China, Austria and Australia. Final Symphony Tokyo was the first video game music concert ever to be greeted with standing ovations in Japan. In March 2015, Final Symphony II saw its first announcement. Featuring music from Final Fantasy V, VIII, IX and XIII, the world premiere took place on August 29, 2015, presented by the Beethoven Orchester Bonn, followed by four performances in September and October 2015 by the London Symphony Orchestra in London, Osaka and twice in Yokohama. The performances in Japan marked the first time a foreign orchestra ever performed a video game concert in Japan. Next to concerts in Germany, the UK and Japan, Final Symphony II also got presented in Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands. Final Symphony and Final Symphony II mark Thomas B√∂cker's most successful concert productions to date. Orchestra recordings Beyond game music concerts, Thomas B√∂cker is the creative mind behind the Merregnon project, a series of albums that tell a fantasy story through music. With their legendary composers, rich performances, and elaborate presentation, these albums have proved influential in East and West alike. B√∂cker has also accepted executive roles on numerous other album productions, including the Amiga‚Äôs Immortal series, Masashi Hamauzu‚Äôs Vielen Dank, Yoko Shimomura‚Äôs drammatica as well as Chris Huelsbeck's two live orchestra albums featuring music from the Turrican series.

There are three schools in the system: Dayton Christian School, located on its Dayton campus in Miamisburg, Ohio Xenia Christian School, located on its Xenia campus in Xenia, Ohio. Dayton Christian Homeschool and LightShine Academy, the preschool program of Dayton Christian School, are located on the Dayton campus. Since 1963, the Dayton Christian School System has graduated over 5,000 students. 1,200 currently attend one of their schools.  History  In 1963, Claude \\"Bud\\" Schindler, an NCR Corporation executive, started a 14-student kindergarten class at Patterson Park Grace Brethren Church. Dayton Christian High School opened in 1967. Dayton Christian Middle School opened in 1979, and in 1984 Sugar Grove Elementary was added. In 1991, Brookville Elementary was added. Two years later in 1993, Xenia Christian Elementary and Xenia Christian High School were added. In 2002, the Sugar Grove Elementary and Brookville Elementary combined to form Northwest Christian School. Northwest Christian School later closed in 2008. In 1979, the schools ended employment of Linda Hoskinson, a married elementary teacher, because she was pregnant and the school felt she should not work outside the home while her kids were young. Her sex discrimination lawsuit went to the U.S. Supreme Court in Ohio Civil Rights Commission v. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc. The schools subsequently changed their employment practices. In 2005, the schools purchased the former NCR training center on Washington Church Road and converted the adult education space into its Miami Township campus. The state of Ohio provided a $379,516 grant to demolish the other structures on the property.

Genetics The epithelial component in EMECL's typically strongly express cytokeratins, but are negative for actin and S-100 protein, while the myoepithelial component stains strongly for actin and S-100 protein, and only focally weakly for cytokeratins. Diagnosis Microscopically, EMECL features bi-layered glandular or ductular structures consisting of inner cuboidal cells and outer multipolar cells. The histologic appearance of these tumors varied, but all shared the common feature of a biphasic proliferation of epithelial (strong cytokeratin-positive; actin and S-100-negative) and myoepithelial (strong actin and S-100 and focal weak cytokeratin-positive) cells with formation of bilayered ductlike structures. The focal resemblance to other salivary gland-type tumors may cause diagnostic difficulties, particularly in small endobronchial biopsies. Although little is known about their biologic potential due to limited follow-up data, these tumors when in the lung clearly have the capacity to infiltrate and metastasize and therefore should be designated as epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma. At present, it appears that treatment by complete surgical resection with negative margins alone is appropriate and adequate. Classification Lung cancer is an extremely heterogeneous family of malignant neoplasms, with well over 50 different histological variants recognized under the 4th revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) typing system (\\"WHO-2004\\"), currently the most widely used lung cancer classification scheme. Because these variants have differing genetic, biological, and clinical properties, including response to treatment, correct classification of lung cancer cases are necessary to assure that lung cancer patients receive optimum management. The WHO-2004 scheme groups lung carcinomas into 8 major types: *Squamous cell carcinoma *Small cell carcinoma *Adenocarcinoma *Large cell carcinoma *Adenosquamous carcinoma *Sarcomatoid carcinoma *Carcinoid tumor *Salivary gland-like carcinoma EMECL is considered a subtype of salivary gland-like carcinoma, tumors so named because their histological appearance and characteristics closely resemble malignant neoplasms arising in the major and minor salivary glands. Staging EMECL is staged in the same manner as other non-small cell lung carcinomas, based on the TNM (Tumor-Node-Metastasis) staging system. Treatment Complete radical surgical resection is the treatment of choice for EMECL, and in most cases, results in long-term survival or cure. Prognosis  The prognosis of EMECL is relatively good, and considerably better than most other forms of NSCLC. The skull and dura are possible sites for metastasis from pulmonary EMC. The MIB-1 index is a predictive marker of malignant potential. Incidence EMECL is extremely rare, with only a handful of cases reported in the literature. In the lung, two salivary gland-like carcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma, while extremely uncommon, occur far more often than does EMECL.

The small island is divided between the U.S. states of Michigan and Ohio, with the abandoned lighthouse structure located within Ohio. When Turtle Island fell back to federal ownership, the newly established Port of Toledo received $5,000 of federal funding from the United States Congress to build the lighthouse in 1831. At the time, the island's area was approximately , and the island included the lighthouse, the lighthouse keeper's residence, and a small farm. Unlike most islands in Lake Erie, Turtle Island consists primarily of clay and gravel deposits and was subjected to constant erosion, which is why some believed it to not be a real island. By 1839, lake storms and waves reduced the island by approximately 77% down to an area of only . Congress spent tens of thousands of dollars to no avail to prevent the erosion of the island. In 1866, an updated lighthouse costing $12,000 was constructed. It was described as one of the finest lighthouses on the Great Lakes, and its light could be seen up to away. However, the erosion of the island continued to threaten the lighthouse to the point where a tall concrete wall was constructed in 1883 around the lighthouse to prevent crashing waves and erosion from damaging the structure. Constant lake storms bombarded the tiny island. When the nearby Toledo Harbor Light was completed in 1904, the Turtle Island Lighthouse was no longer needed and was decommissioned. During those 72 years, there were no shipwrecks within the vicinity of Turtle Island. There were two keepers of the lighthouse: Ann Edson (1869‚Äì1870) and William Haynes (1875‚Äì1904).

It is loosely based on the comic book series The Extraordinary Adventures of Ad√®le Blanc-Sec by Jacques Tardi and, as in the comic, follows the eponymous writer and a number of recurring side characters in a succession of far-fetched incidents in 1910s Paris and beyond, in this episode revolving around parapsychology and ultra-advanced Ancient Egyptian technology, which both pastiche and subvert adventure and speculative fiction of the period. The primarily live-action film, shot in Super 35, incorporates much use of computer animation to portray its fanciful elements and contemporary action film special and visual effects within the form of the older-style adventure films they have largely superseded. Plot The film incorporates characters and events from several of the ', in particular the first, \\"Ad√®le and the Beast\\", first published in 1976, and the fourth, 1978's \\"Mummies on Parade,\\" within an overall plot of 's construction and takes place primarily in Paris, . While experimenting with the telepathic techniques he has been researching, Professor Esp√©randieu hatches a 136 million year-old pterosaur egg within the Galerie de pal√©ontologie et d'anatomie compar√©e, resulting in the death of a former prefect (scandalously sharing a taxicab with a ' showgirl) which though witnessed only by the then-drunk sparks an epidemic of claimed sightings of the creature. The President of France orders the case be considered of utmost urgency by the National Police, only for it to be handed down to the bumbling Inspector Albert Caponi. Ad√®le Blanc-Sec, a journalist and travel writer of some fame, finds herself involved after returning from Egypt, where she was searching for Ramesses II's mummified doctor/physician Patmosis. She wants to revive the mummy with the help of Esp√©randieu so the doctor can save her sister Agathe, who is comatose following an unfortunate tennis incident involving a hatpin. After a brief struggle with her nemesis, the mysterious Professor Dieuleveult, she retrieves the mummy and returns home. Her mission is complicated further by Esp√©randieu being on death row, having been blamed for the pterosaur's attacks, in lieu of Inspector Caponi and celebrity big game hunter Justin de Saint-Hubert having any success in taking down the beast itself. Andrej Zborowski, a researcher at the Jardin des Plantes who is enamored with Ad√®le, is able to lure the pterosaur into hiding. Ad√®le, riding the pterosaur, rescues Esp√©randieu moments before his execution. Saint-Hubert fatally shoots the pterosaur along with Esp√©randieu, but not before Esp√©randieu is able to revive the mummy. The mummy reveals itself to be the Pharaoh's physicist (\\"I'm a nuclear physicist. I deal in figures, signs and equations.\\") and is unable to help her sister medically. He does, however, accompany Ad√®le to the Louvre, where they revive the rest of the Pharaoh's mummified court on display there, including the Pharaoh himself. The Pharaoh's doctor uses their advanced medical techniques to revive Agathe. The Pharaoh then decides he wants to see Paris, so the entire court wanders out into the night, scaring the ever-hapless Choupard yet again. Ad√®le decides she needs a vacation to relax. The final scene shows her boarding a ship, and the camera pans out to reveal the name of the ship, the RMS Titanic. is then shown, maliciously smiling. In a mid-credits scene, M√©nard pursues Saint-Hubert with a rifle, still outraged that Saint-Hubert shot the pterosaur. M√©nard is arrested by Caponi as two gorillas stare menacingly at Saint-Hubert.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 84% based on reviews from 25 critics. Variety magazine called the film a \\"polished comicbook adaptation\\" and praised the performance of Louise Bourgoin's as the titular heroine.

It is located at the summit of St. Paul's Hill and is today part of the Malacca Museum Complex comprising the A Famosa ruins, the Stadthuys and other historical buildings.  History of the church  The original structure was a simple chapel built in 1521 dedicated to the Virgin Mary and known as the Nossa Senhora da Annunciada (Our Lady of the Annunciation). The chapel was built by a Portuguese fidalgo or nobleman, Duarte Coelho, as an act of gratitude following his escape from a storm in the South China Sea. The chapel was deeded to the Society of Jesus in 1548 by the Bishop of Goa, Jo√£o Afonso de Albuquerque, with the title deeds received by St. Francis Xavier. The chapel was then further enlarged in 1556 with the addition of a second floor, and a belfry tower was added in 1590. The chapel was then renamed the Igreja de Madre de Deus (Church of the Mother of God). A burial vault was opened in 1592 and many people of distinction were buried there, including Pedro Martins, the second Bishop of Funay, Japan.  Association with St. Francis Xavier  In 1548, St. Francis Xavier with the help of fellow Jesuits, Fr. Francisco Peres and Brother Roque de Oliveira, established a school in the premises of the chapel known as St. Paul's College. This was perhaps the first school in the modern sense to be established on the Malay peninsula. Xavier used the church as his base for his missionary journeys to China and Japan. In one of those journeys, Xavier fell sick and in 1552 in Shangchuan Island, China he would die. In 1553, the body of Xavier was disinterred from Shangchuan Island and temporarily buried at the church before it was finally shipped to Goa. An open grave in the church still exists today marking the place of Xavier's burial.  Reconsecration and abandonment  With the conquest of Malacca by the Dutch in 1641, the church was reconsecrated for Dutch Reformed use as St. Paul's Church also known as the Bovenkerk or High Church. The church remained in use as the main church of the Dutch community until the new Bovenkerk (better known today as Christ Church Malacca) was completed in 1753. The old church was then subsequently deconsecrated and the structure modified and strengthened as part of the fortifications of Malacca. The nave of the church was then used as a churchyard. When the British occupied Malacca in 1824, the church was used as a powder magazine and was allowed to deteriorate further.  Excavations and later additions  Efforts to preserve records of monuments from the past such as the tombstones found in St. Paul's Church were photographed by the Resident Councillor of Malacca, Robert Norman Bland and published in his 1905 work, Historical Tombstones of Malacca.Nunn, Bernard. \\"Some Account of Our Governors and Civil Service.\\" One Hundred Years of Singapore, Being Some Account of the Capital of the Straits Settlements from Its Foundation by Sir Stamford Raffles on 6 February 1819 to 6 February 1919.

In 1924, the old Portuguese burial vault in the chancel of the church was partially uncovered. Further excavation was done in 1930 by the president of the newly formed Malacca Historical Society, Major C. E. Bone. It was in this period that the tombstones that were scattered around in the vicinity of the church were affixed to the walls. In 1952, a statue of St. Francis Xavier was erected in front of the ruins of the church in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of his sojourn in Malacca. A day after the statue was consecrated, a large casuarina tree fell on it, breaking off its right arm. Incidentally, the right forearm of Xavier was detached in 1614 as a relic.

It remembers October 17, 1945, when a massive labour demonstration at Plaza de Mayo demanded the liberation of Juan Domingo Per√≥n, who was jailed in Mart√≠n Garc√≠a island. It is considered the foundation day of Peronism. Antecedents On June 4, 1943, nationalist military led by General Arturo Rawson removed through a coup President Ram√≥n Castillo, the last president of the Infamous Decade, a line of corrupt governments that had imposed the so-called patriotic fraud since the military coup of 1930. The labor movement was against the coup, initially perplexed and undecided about the position should be adopted. It was divided into the four main groups (CGT N ¬∫ 1, CGT No. 2, USA and FORA). One of the first actions was to dissolve the government CGT No. 2 (led by the socialist Francisco P√©rez Leir√≥s), the Employees' Union of trade unions of Borlenghi and the communist-led unions (construction workers, meatpackers, etc.). It led to a number of unions that formed it to return to the CGT N ¬∫ 1 (general secretary Jos√© Domenech). Shortly after the government passed a law on trade unions, who met some expectations but union, while allowing them to intervene by the State. Then the military government applied this law to the powerful rail unions involved and the heart of the CGT, the Union Railway and the Brotherhood. In October a series of strikes were answered with the arrest of dozens of labor leaders. It soon became apparent that the military government was composed of influential anti-union sectors. Under these conditions some union socialists, trade unionists and some communist revolutionaries led by √Ångel Borlenghi (a socialist and secretary general of the powerful General Confederation of Employees of Commerce in the dissolved socialist CGT No. 2), Francisco Pablo Capozzi (PFI), Juan Bramuglia (Railway Union), among others, agreed, albeit with reservations and distrust, to undertake a series of alliances with certain sectors of the military government which shared the union demands. Among young military colonels were Juan D. Per√≥n and Domingo Mercante. The union proposed the military create a Ministry of Labor, strengthen the CGT and enact a series of labor laws that accepted the historical claims of the Argentine labor movement. Soon after, the alliance between trade unionists and military government appointed Peron as Director of the Department of Labor, a position apparently worthless. A month later, the status of the organism raised to a Secretary of State (December 2, 1943). From the Department of Labor, Per√≥n, with the support of the unions began to develop much of the historic union agenda: it created employment tribunals; 33.302/43 Decree was passed extending the severance pay to all workers, more than two million people were beneficiaries of the retirement was enacted the Statute of farm workers and the status of the journalist, it created the Polyclinic Hospital for railway workers, prohibiting private placement agencies, the Technical Schools aimed at workers; 123 more decrees were signed. In 1944 collective agreements reached more than 1,400,000 workers and employees, and in 1945 another 347 covered 2,186,868 workers. Additionally Peron succeeded to repeal the decree-law regulating unions sanctioned in the first days of military rule. Within this framework, the unions began a period of high growth, and what was even more important, they began to recruit large numbers to the \\"new\\" workers, who were migrating en masse to the city from the countryside, called \\"morochos \\"\\" fat \\"and\\" black heads \\"with the middle and upper classes and the workers themselves\\" old \\"descendants of European immigration. Soon after, some unions that had remained aloof, the CGT N ¬∫ 1, the USA and the autonomous unions, are beginning to unite around the Secretary of Labor. But to the contrary, in September 1945, 4 major unions split from the CGT: Fraternity, the Textile Workers Union, the Confederation of Commercial Employees and the Union of Footwear. The alliance between unions and the group of young military officers led by Per√≥n immediately generated strong opposition from conservative political, economic and military, with support from the U.S. Embassy (Ambassador Braden) that generates a high polarization for 1945. The events unfolded rapidly. On 12 July 1945, the trade unions led by Borlenghi perform a massive act of downtown Buenos Aires (on Diagonal Norte and Florida). When finished, the crowd of workers begin to chant the name of Peron and proclaim it as a candidate for president. The workers' demonstration was answered on September 19 by the middle and upper classes with the \\"March of the Constitution and Freedom,\\" which brought the extraordinary sum of 200,000 people marching in the upscale Recoleta ward, where supporters of the Former President Arturo Rawson gathered at the balcony of his house. October Days General Eduardo √Åvalos demanded Per√≥n's resignation, organizing a military show of force in support of this on October 8; the military government, to avoid conflict, accepted, and Per√≥n resigned the next day. On October 10, upon Per√≥n's leaving office as Vice President, the CGT held a rally in his support in the corner of Peru and Alsina Streets, downtown. He directed himself to the rally, and gave a famous speech in which he detailed an ambitious program to redress labor grievances. On October 11 Avalos took over as Minister of War, and that night a meeting was held at the Military Club (Paz Palace) with nearly 300 officers, among whom were about 20 of the Navy, to discuss the course to be followed, including as to whether to retain Farrell as President. The assembly decided to send a delegation to meet with Avalos and, indeed, the only points that had agreed was to request the immediate convocation of elections, the appointment of civilian ministers, lifting the siege and the arrest and prosecution of Per√≥n. Concurrently, a senior Senator from the Socialist Party of Argentina, Alfredo Palacios, obtained a Supreme Court ruling against the regime, and when the Paz Palace meeting ended at midnight, a presidential decree calling for elections was announced on the airwaves. A meeting of opposition leaders gathered around a Democratic Coordinating Board on October 11. Emboldened by the course of events, the Army decided to demand that power be handed over to the Supreme Court. Historian F√©lix Luna wrote on the lack of realism that made this decision such a tactical mistake: On October 12, after receiving the military delegation, Farrell called for the resignation of all ministers except Avalos; Lima Vernengo was appointed as Minister of the Navy. At the same time, a demonstration was held around the Paz Palace by the most conservative students, who shouted anti-military slogans and seized the building. They demanded the Supreme Court's intervention against Per√≥n and any government decision on his behalf, a position which further unified the latter's base of support. When in the afternoon a delegation of civilians took this position to √Åvalos, the War Minister considered unacceptable, tried to reassure them and informed them that she will be arrested. The delegation returned to inform the protesters, who were still in place, causing visible irritation. On several occasions there had been clashes between elements Alliance and students, about nine o'clock that night without any clear explanation of its origin had a violent shootout between police and a group of protesters who threw the one person dead and more than fifty wounded. Eva Per√≥n drove on the morning of Thursday the 11th with \\"Rudi\\" Freude, son of a friend, and Juan Duarte (brother of Eva Per√≥n) to San Nicol√°s island first and then to the Delta, leaving Mercante with instructions to cooperate with police, rather than hide\\". On October 12 President Farrell ordered the arrest of Per√≥n. The police came to fetch him from his apartment on Calle Posadas, in the Retiro ward of Buenos Aires, and Mercante told the sheriff where he was and the next day. Per√≥n was taken into custody at the gunboat ARA Independencia, which in turn moved to Mart√≠n Garc√≠a Island. Following the arrest, the newspaper Cr√≠tica (then the most widely circulated newsdaily in Argentina), announced on the front page that: Per√≥n is no longer a threat to the country. On Saturday, October 13, Farrell met with the Attorney General, Dr. Juan √Ålvarez, and proposed to √Åvalos that he form a new cabinet with the latter as a sort of Prime Minister, thus following a suggestion made to him by former C√≥rdoba Province Governor Amadeo Sabattini. It was a compromise in which no transfer power to the Court was entrusted to a renowned civil conduction process leading to elections. √Ålvarez took his time: one day to consult before accepting the job and four days of consultations for candidates, presenting his list for these on October 17. On the night of Tuesday the 16th, a Confederal Committee meeting of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) decided to call a strike for the 18th. The reason for the strike was expressed in a number of issues including freedom of political prisoners, calling for elections, maintaining the gains of workers, etc.. but, significantly, did not mention Per√≥n. The explanation is that many leaders were not convinced to support Per√≥n, so the favorable sector due to unemployment in the text to make concessions to reach a majority A significant section of the CGT, enlisted in the Communist and Socialist parties Per√≥n identified with Nazism and demanded his dismissal, coinciding with the U.S. Embassy. While the CGT hosted the mobilization to be held the next day, the strike served as a driver for several unions and workers in general, were on alert after days earlier, felt backed for actions to take. Per√≥n, citing health problems, managed to move him to a military hospital in the Belgrano district of Buenos Aires, where they arrive on the morning of 17. October 17 The mobilization of workers began at dawn in the southern Buenos Aires neighborhoods of La Boca, Barracas, Parque Patricios, as well as in working class suburbs further south, such as Avellaneda, Berazategui, Lan√∫s and Quilmes, as well as other, surrounding industrial areas. Among the first to mobilize en masse were abattoir workers led by Cipriano Reyes in La Plata then home to numerous meat packing establishments, such as the important Swift-Armour plant. The march swelled with those who left factories and shops, and refrained from directly entering workplaces themselves. Initially the police lifted the bridges over the Riachuelo that led into the capital, and some protesters crossed by swimming or on rafts until bridges were later lowered; some members of the police force exchanged expressions of sympathy with the demonstrators. The marchers' many banners included slogans that had nothing to do with the claims of the CGT; but expressed their support for Per√≥n and demanded his release. President Edelmiro Farrell had a laissez-faire attitude. The new Minister of War General Eduardo √Åvalos watched the protesters and refused to mobilize the troops of the Campo de Mayo, which could have reached the federal capital in a few hours, as claimed by some officers of the army and the Minister of Marine. √Åvalos was confident the demonstration would dissolve by itself; but instead found that they became increasingly numerous, and ultimately agreed to hold talks with Per√≥n in the Military Hospital. They had a short meeting to agree on the conditions: Per√≥n would speak to reassure the protesters, without making reference to his arrest, and persuade them to disperse; in return, the entire cabinet would resign, as would √Åvalos. At 10:30 pm that day, Dr. Juan √Ålvarez had attended Government House to deliver a letter with the names proposed for ministers together with the curriculum of them and their acceptance to the charges. He was received with bewilderment in the midst of the disorder that existed at the time on site, and fired him with courtesy. The list was, according to Luna, a scorn for the country, it included people with a highly questionable history as far their democratic credentials. These included, Jorge Figueroa Alcorta, proposed for Minister Justice and Public Instruction, who had been involved in a 1942 plot with military cadets; Alberto Hueyo for the Treasury, who had been director of the CHADE electric utility when it fraudulently obtained an extension of its concession; Tom√°s Amadeo for Agriculture, was a close friend of U.S. Ambassador Spruille Braden; Antonio Vaquer for Public Works, who had been an official in President Roberto Marcelino Ortiz's Coordination of Transportation, a unit established at the behest of British tram businesses, to the detriment of local businesses collectives. At 11:10 pm, and before a crowd estimated at 300,000 people, Per√≥n appeared at the main balcony of the Casa Rosada, the nation's executive government offices. He thanked those present, recalling his work in government, reported on his request for retirement, pledged to continue defending the interests of workers and, finally, asked those present to disperse in peace, urging instead that they maintain the general strike the following day. Immediate effects Per√≥n's resignation on 8 October 1945 was the result of loss of support in the army commanders. Based on the letter sent to Eva Duarte from Mart√≠n Garc√≠a Island, it can be considered at the time Per√≥n was determined to retire from politics. The mobilization of 17 October had two immediate effects: it forced Per√≥n to return to the political struggle, and persuaded the Army to turning in his favor before those among the military leadership opposed to him could organize their colleagues against him. After a short period of rest, he and Eva Duarte were married on October 22, following which Per√≥n began his political campaign. Former Governor Sabattini and others within the UCR formed the Junta Renovadora (\\"Renewal Board\\"), which joined independents in endorsing the Labor Party. The influential FORJA (\\"Wrought\\") faction of the UCR, led by Arturo Jauretche, disbanded to join the Peronist movement; Jauretche was later appointed Director of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires. Domingo Mercante was appointed to head the Department of Labor. A colonel tied to the principal rail workers' union, he helped rally organized labor in support for the Per√≥n campaign. The opposition parties formed the Democratic Union, an alliance centered on the presidential ticket nominated by the Radical Civic Union. The Per√≥n-Quijano ticket won the February 24, 1946, election with 54% of the vote.

Now mainly residential, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The former Southern New England Telephone Company Building is located on the south side of downtown Hartford, at the northwest corner of Jewell and Trumbull Streets, overlooking Bushnell Park. It is twelve stories in height, faced with granite and limestone, and has Art Deco styling. The main facade faces Jewell Street, and is fifteen bays wide, organized in a 1-3-2-3-2-3-1 pattern articulated by piers that have Art Deco relief carvings at the base of the second story. The present main entrance is in the second grouping from the left, framed by a decorated rectangular surround. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Roy Foote, and its first six stories were completed in 1931. It was provisioned for enlargement at that time, and another six stories were added in 1952, designed by Westcott and Mapes to seamlessly integrated with the existing structure. The Southern New England Telephone Company, for many years Connecticut's major telephone service provider, housed offices and switching equipment in the building. The company was the first to introduce dial service, which began operation in Hartford in 1922. The company began moving out of the premises in the 1970s, and fully vacated it in the late 1990s.

Though it is usually associated with congenital heart diseases with decreased pulmonary blood flow like tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary atresia it may be seen sometimes in isolation i.e. not associated with any congenital heart disease in that case it is termed as isolated aortopulmonary collateral artery.http://ijmrhs.com/isolated-major-aortopulmonary-collateral-artery- causing-ccf-in-a-newborn-a-case-report/ In these cases it may be one of the cause of congestive cardiac failure in neonates.Dr Mohammed Ashfaque, dr pallavi p saple, dr arpita et al http://ijmrhs.com/isolated-major- aortopulmonary-collateral-artery-causing-ccf-in-a-newborn-a-case-report/ Pulmonary arteries come from the right side of the heart, and usually carry deoxygenated blood from the body. These collateral arteries carry blood which has already been oxygenated by the lungs, so are of little use in helping the body to get oxygen. Associated conditions Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (or Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia) will result in the development of systemic collaterals. Implications of a systemic collateral supply Major aortopulmonary collateral arteries come from the systemic circulation, because of this they will often have higher pressure than normal found in the lungs leading to pulmonary hypertension. These vessels are not programmed to exist beyond early fetal life, and eventually became narrowed and stenotic. Treatment The aim of treatment of the MAPCAs is to group them together and convert their supply to deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart.

Instances of the manA RNA motif were detected in bacteria in the genus Photobacterium and phages that infect certain kinds of cyanobacteria. However, most predicted manA RNA sequences are derived from DNA collected from uncultivated marine bacteria. Almost all manA RNAs are positioned such that they might be in the 5' untranslated regions of protein-coding genes, and therefore it was hypothesized that manA RNAs function as cis-regulatory elements. Given the relative complexity of their secondary structure, and their hypothesized cis-regulatory role, they might be riboswitches. The genes thought to be regulated by manA RNAs are most typically those involved in the metabolism of the sugars fructose and mannose, synthesis of nucleotides, bacterial photosynthesis and a class of protein chaperones known as ibpA. manA RNAs are also often adjacent to transfer RNAs, and are likely transcribed with them. Although these genes are not thought of as typical of phages, it has previously been observed that phages infecting cyanobacteria commonly incorporate such genes.

The king was not able to produce any heir to the throne through his three wives. The king was depressed and spent large amount of time by himself in the forest. A priest in the forest saw the king's misery and gave him mangoes of bearing. The priest instructed the king to feed the fruits to his wives and then they would conceive children. The king gave his three wives the fruits as instructed by the priest. Two elder queens did not produce any children, as they ate it with disbelief. However, the younger queen gave birth to octuplets: seven boys and one girl, when the king was on a voyage. The elder queens became jealous and buried the babies in the garden before the younger queen gained consciousness from pregnancy. The babies magically blossom into seven champak flowers and a trumpet flower. The last baby, the girl, was born some time after first seven babies in a time when the elder queens left the room with seven babies and this enabled the maid to hide the baby from the elder queens and named the child Parul.

It is thought to be the first naturalistic rendering of the night sky in Renaissance art. At Elsheimer's death in Rome in 1610, this picture was hanging in his bedroom. Like many other artists before and after him, Elsheimer has depicted the biblical Flight into Egypt, in which Joseph, Mary, and Jesus seek refuge from possible persecution by Herod. For its innovative fusing of religious and landscape elements, and its detailed juxtaposition of light and darkness, The Flight into Egypt is one of Elsheimer's most well- known and lauded works. It is also likely his last painting, for he died a year later. Elsheimer's treatment is unique in placing the Holy Family in a nocturnal setting, true to the biblical description. The darkness creates opposing feelings of intimacy and fear of the unknown. The painting channels the mysteries of night, pondered by humans for centuries, into this moment of the Holy Family seeking refuge. There are four sources of light in the painting: the Moon is accurately depicted and reflects off the calm water. There is a fire near the shepherds at left, where the family is headed. At the centre of the composition, Joseph holds a torch that illuminates Mary and the infant, who are riding an ass. The heavily treed landscape behind them is almost black, its outline forming a diagonal across the sky and completely containing the foreground figures. The diagonal is echoed in the night sky by the intricate band of the Milky Way, and detailed configurations of stars are seen, including Ursa Major at far left. Elsheimer is thought to be the first painter to accurately depict constellations.Madlyn Millner Kahr (1993). Dutch painting in the seventeenth century. 2nd edition. Westview Press; pp. 94‚Äì95. Another readily identifiable constellation is Leo, above the Holy Family, with its brightest star, Regulus, in the centre of the picture. It has been proposed that Elsheimer reworked the painting in 1610, after the publication of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius, which showed the Milky Way as composed of individual stars and showed the Moon's surface in unprecedented detail. This hypothesis has been contested by Elsheimer scholar Keith Andrews. In addition to disclosing Elsheimer's interest in scientific topics, the appearance of the Milky Way has a spiritual connotation‚Äîit symbolized the path to heaven beginning in the Middle Ages.Parks, J. (2007). \\"Adam Elsheimer: Rich and Magical Storytelling.\\" American Artist, 71, 36‚Äì45. Elsheimer's sky, wrote art historian R.H. Wilenski, \\"is no longer a blackcloth but a symbol for boundless space\\".Quoted in Linda Ben-Zvi, Angela B. Moorjani (2008). Beckett at 100: revolving it all. Oxford University Press US; p. 131.  Influence  Hendrick Goudt, The Flight into Egypt (1613), engraving, Courtauld Institute Elsheimer's inventory shows the painting to have been located in his bedroom. The importance of Elsheimer's painting can be judged from a letter dated 14 January 1611 from Rubens to the doctor, botanist and art collector Johann Faber in which he discusses the extraordinary price of 300 scudi demanded by the widow. The painting eventually passed to Hendrick Goudt, who took it to Utrecht. Elsheimer's works, including The Flight into Egypt, influenced important near-contemporaries Claude Lorrain and Peter Paul Rubens.Anne Hollander (1989). Moving pictures. Alfred A. Knopf; p. 106. Rembrandt's version of The Flight into Egypt (1627), with its unique illumination, may have been inspired by Elsheimer's. Rembrandt would have been familiar with Elsheimer's work through high-quality engravings made by his friend Hendrick Goudt. The influence of Goudt's prints on the work of other engravers, especially that of Jan van de Velde, was immediate. Elsheimer also inspired later artists, such as the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich. The fire's illumination in Friedrich's Evening on the Baltic Sea (1831) recalls The Flight into Egypt.Siegel, Linda (1978). Caspar David Friedrich and the age of German Romanticism.

Hodel resigned two years later out of a dispute with Robertson over the direction and principles represented by the organization, and Tate left later the same year.

Vaughan began with Reed in 1989 as a volunteer, stuffing envelopes and hammering in yard signs. In 1991, he joined the field department, becoming deputy national field director in 1993. He joined Hodel's staff in 1997 as special assistant to the president and was promoted to director of administration in 1998. Currently serving as Chief of Staff for Focus on the Family, Vaughan has been at the forefront of the Christian Right for over two decades, and alongside its most notable leaders: (in chronological order) Robertson, Reed, Hodel, Dr. James Dobson, and Focus on the Family President James Daly. Vaughan's book is not only a history of the Christian Coalition but is the definitive book on the Religious Right in American politics. In classroom use at the university level at Georgetown University and elsewhere, The Rise and Fall of the Christian Coalition gives students an inside look, the only inside look, at this phenomenal organization and its controversial leadership. Reviews Republican strategist and pollster Kelleyanne Conway praised Vaughan's work: \\"Joel Vaughan relies on neither gossip nor guesswork in this compelling book. His is an insider's account; ten years at the Christian Coalition and an easy writing style provide the reader with a ringside seat to one of the most controversial‚Äîand consequential‚Äîperiods in modern American political history.\\"Book jacket 2009 Non-profit watchdog Rusty Leonard added: \\"In a thorough and entertaining manner, Vaughan's The Rise and Fall of the Christian Coalition captures the essence of the Coalition, its leaders, and the political environment in which the group rose to prominence, as well as how it ultimately dwindled into insignificance. All students of political history and social movements will benefit from Vaughan's fair-minded recounting of this unique period of our history, when Christians were able to mold the political landscape in a manner few would have ever believed possible. And those who witnessed this remarkable organization's dramatic evolution will find Vaughan's 'behind the scenes' insights to be both illuminating and engaging.\\"Book jacket 2009 Former Christian Coalition press secretary and Virginia pro-life organizer Chris Freund gave a strong endorsement: \\"As someone who knows Joel Vaughan from our days working together at the Christian Coalition, I highly recommend his book. If you want to know the truth of what happened, this book is a must read.\\" Norfolk's Virginian-Pilot writes that Vaughan's book \\"is no dewy-eyed paean to the Robertson enterprise. For those interested in a detailed and unvarnished inside view of the coalition's meteoric rise and subsequent implosion, it is a worthwhile read.\\" References Category:2009 books Category:New Right (United States) Category:2009 in Christianity Category:2009 in politics ","title":"The Rise and Fall of the Christian Coalition"},{"id":"26633501","text":"The Episcopal Church of All Saints serves the Old Northside Historic District near downtown Indianapolis.

(1997), The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis, p. 550 Construction of All Saints Cathedral began on the site of Grace Church in 1910. The building was dedicated on All Saints Day in 1911. The 1912 diocesan convention designated the cathedral as \\"a House of Prayer, where all persons, of whatever race or nation, may have opportunity to worship God\\".http://www.allsaintsindy.org/worship/history.html All Saints Church began a period of turmoil marked by its losing its cathedral status in 1954 as well as the change in neighborhood demographics following the end of World War II. This upheaval culminated in an outreach to the burgeoning African-American inner-city population, including the creation of a treble choir for children affiliated with the Royal School of Church Music. This program flourished throughout the 1960s, and it was during this time that the congregation affixed a sign, still present, above the west doors reading \\"Everyone Is Welcome\\". On January 1, 1977, The Rev. Jacqueline Means became the first woman to be regularly ordained as a priest in the Episcopal Church. The ordination was controversial within the congregation, with only 75 people attending her first celebration of communion the following morning, compared to regular Sunday attendance at the time of 90‚Äì120.\\"Woman Episcopal Priest Celebrates Communion\\", New York Times, January 3, 1977 The Rev. Tanya Vonnegut Beck, who served as All Saints' priest-in-charge from 2010 to 2012, was the second woman regularly ordained in the Episcopal Church.Bodenhamer, D. and Barrows, R. (1997), The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis, p. 551 All Saints Church also built bridges to the homeless community of downtown Indianapolis throughout the 1970s and 1980s. This activity culminated in the founding of the Dayspring Center in 1989, an institution sponsored by the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis and that operates in a building adjacent to the church.Dayspring Center In the 1990s, the congregation recognized the profound cultural impact of the AIDS epidemic by honoring many victims of the epidemic in memorial services. This outreach is memorialized by a crystal chalice inlaid with jewels for use at the Eucharist as a memorial to those who died of AIDS. In recent times, the parish community has evolved to reflect the changing demographic of the neighborhood. The congregation sponsors community meetings, a concert series known as Arts at All Saints, and many other programs focused on spiritual growth and fellowship.  Architecture  The building constructed in 1910 as the Cathedral of All Saints is a brick American Gothic Revival church. The plans as designed by Alfred Grindle followed the English collegiate style layout with a chancel nearly as long as the nave. Due to funding restrictions, only the nave and crossing were constructed according to the plans. A wooden structure served as the chancel, significantly limiting the architectural impact of the building. By the late 1950s this clapboard annex was structurally unsound, and a new brick apse and sacristy designed by the firm Evans Woollen and Associates replaced the old chancel. The curved wall of the new apse contrasts greatly with the rectilinear rigidity of the Gothic nave. This dissonance is viewed by many as a stylistic strength of the building in its blending of hard and soft architectural forms. Acoustically, the curved apse wall promotes dissemination and reverberation of sound, creating a space much noted for its use in musical performance. The two transepts are used as chapels. The north transept is a traditional Lady Chapel complete with altar, statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary and devotional accouterments. The south transept is dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel and is used weekly for midweek mass services. The only stained glass windows in the church are located in the south transept Michael Chapel. A large triptych in lancet windows depicts Michael expelling Lucifer from Paradise. A lower triptych of quasi-clerestory windows depicts traditional themes in contemporary contexts: a Nativity with the Virgin depicted as an inner-city African-American mother, a Crucifixion in an urban scene of racism, and a manifestation of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost symbolized by the universality of satellites orbiting the earth. The windows were designed, fabricated and installed by Margaret A.

His specialties included landscape ecology and plant community ecology, and he received several awards during his lifetime. Biography Bouchard was born in 1946 in Montreal and grew up in C√¥te-des-Neiges, although his family came from Saint-Anicet, and maintained a secondary residence there. His father, Louis G. Bouchard, was a successful leather goods supplier. He studied first at Coll√®ge Jean-De-Br√©beuf before graduating with a degree in biological sciences from Universit√© de Montr√©al. He went to McGill and Cornell University for his postgraduate studies, which he completed in the 1970s.His dissertation is dated from 1975, the same year he became curator at the Botanical Garden. In 1975 he began teaching at his alma mater Universit√© de Montr√©al, while simultaneously becoming curator at the Botanical Garden. He would remain at the University until his death, and at the garden for 21 years. As curator, his primary duty was directing research at the garden. His own research discussed the flora of Newfoundland (Gros Morne National Park was the topic of his doctorate dissertation) and of southwestern Quebec. His creative use of notarized acts to study the evolution of Quebec forest since New France led to significant discoveries regarding the evolution of beech-maple forests. Beyond scientific work, he rapidly became known for his involvement in various environmental issues, notably the fight to save the Bois de Saraguay, an old-growth forest on the northern side of Montreal Island that was threatened by developers. Over the years, he invested himself in numerous other debates, such as those over the Bois√© du Tremblay in Longueuil, the Muir Forest in Hichinbrooke (now the Bois√©-des-Muir Ecological Reserve) and, closer to home, the Little and Large Tea Field, two peat bogs in his native town of Saint-Anicet. He was also a member of the 2004 Commission Coulombe whose report was to define provincial forest exploitation policy. Although he was well aware that he and his fellow commissioner would catch flak from the industry for the recommendations (which included a 20% reductions of wood cuts), he pushed forward with the belief that these were the right decisions to make. Having been a close collaborator of Pierre Bourque, he was named director of the Botanical Garden in 1994 when Bourque had to leave the position following his election as mayor. It was a short stay, both because he had notified the administration he considered it an interim position, and because he was not comfortable with the complicated administrative apparatus connected to the position. In 2002, he became the first director of the newly founded Institut de Recherche en Biology V√©g√©tale (IRBV), a position he occupied until 2006. All these years he continued to teach at the Universit√©, and directed over 45 master's and doctorate students. He also sat on the Montreal Heritage Council from 2006 to 2008, on the Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine board of directors, and received awards from the Quebec Association of Biologists (prix Georges-Pr√©fontaine, 2005) and the Acfas (prix Michel-Jurdant for environmentalism, 1990). In addition to his environmental and scientific work, he had a keen interest in history, both local and scientific. In 1998 he published a short historical account of the botanical garden, and in 2007 a compendium of correspondence from Marie-Victorin. At the time of his death, he was working on books about southern Quebec wetlands and a biography of Marie-Victorin. A great admirer of the man, he had retraced Marie-Victorin's expeditions in Cuba and organized an exposition on the topic. A founding member of the local history society of Saint-Anicet, he wrote several accounts of prominent locals such as Jules and Paul-√âmile L√©ger, whose families had local ties. He had also been heavily involved on two book projects on the local church and the municipality itself. Bouchard died unexpectedly from heart attack on March 4, 2010, in Montreal's Central Station, a few months from his planned retirement. Bourque presented his condolences, and flags at the Botanical Garden were flown half-staff for several days. He was married with three children. In June of that year, he was a granted a posthumous honoris causa doctorate from Universit√© Laval. Selected publications * Bouchard, Andr√©, and Paul F. Maycock.

Early life  Stein was born on January 9, 1857, in Rengersdorf, Silesia. He moved to the United States in 1875, and began his studies intent on going into the clergy. He graduated from Georgetown University with an MD in 1866, but appears never to have practised medicine afterward. In 1892, he and his brother Richard bought land in Maryland, including Harmony Hall. This spawned a small settlement in Prince George's County, Maryland, also called \\"Silesia\\", with a population today of around 40 people.  Arctic interest  Stein worked as clerk and stenographer for the United States Geological Survey from 1885 until 1905, occasionally translating scientific literature into English on a freelance basis. He also became an active member of the newly formed National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C., translating articles for its magazine and presenting papers at its meetings. During this time he developed an \\"all-absorbing fascination for Arctic exploration\\". He participated in several Arctic expeditions, and was an interpreter of Eskimo languages for Admiral Robert Edwin Peary. He wrote a proposal for an expedition in 1894 to explore Ellesmere Island and rescue the lost Bj√∂rling‚ÄìKallstenius Expedition. While it is unclear if his proposed expedition ever took place, he did manage to finance another expedition after mortgaging his house and farm. Stein landed near Cape Sabine and commenced a two-year study of the linguistics, songs, and drum dances of the Cape York Eskimo from 1899 to 1901, overwintering at Fort Magnesia on Pim Island. Ultimately the expedition was eclipsed by the better funded and equipped expedition led by Otto Sverdrup. Historian William Barr rates Stein's expedition \\"among one of the least effectual which had ever crossed the Arctic Circle.\\"  Later life and death  Stein would later propose a claim to reduce pre-war tensions through a vast exchange of colonies and hinterlands, notably involving ceding Greenland to Canada. Depressed by the First World War and pessimistic about future world peace, Stein hanged himself on April 21, 1917. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered on the family's land in Maryland.

His collection of personal essays about Japan, Michibata de Dietta Nippon (2002) (A Sidewalker‚Äôs Japan), was a finalist for the Koizumi Yakumo Cultural Prize. He initiated and continues to oversee the development of a digital archive of tables of contents of American literature anthologies Covers, Titles, and Tables: The Formations of American Literary Canons (www.uta.edu/english/roemer/ctt). Background=Family Kenneth Roemer's father Arthur K. Roemer (1912‚Äì2005), was an engineer and co-inventor of the stabilizer for the klystron tube that produced narrow band microwave messages that were difficult for the Japanese to intercept during WW II. His mother, Mildred Allison Roemer (1906‚Äì2003), was an artist and writer, who was known as the (non-Native) \\"Long Island Indian Lady\\". Roemer married Claire \\"Micki\\" O‚ÄôKeefe Roemer (1946 ‚Äì ), a former President of the Board of the National Association of Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA) and former General Manager, School Services and Training Channel, Financial Aid, US Department of Education.

The archive includes selected covers, tables of contents from histories and encyclopedias of American literature dating back to 1829, indices since 1963 from American Literary Scholarship (ALS), and selected \\"Extra\\" essays published at the height of the canon wars in the journal American Literature. But the primary evidence provided is the American literature anthology table of contents, especially examples beginning in the early 1900s. The archive provides more than 1000 pages of these tables of contents arranged in chronological drop boxes. Since 1999 thousands of instructors and students in North American and Europe have used Covers, Titles, and Tables. The archive is the first site discussed in the Introduction to Martha L. Brogan's A Kaleidoscope of Digital American Literature. During the 2016‚Äì2017 academic year, the site will undergo major changes that will expand the archive and increase searchability options.

Originally built in 1904 as the Salt Lake City Public Library, the building was renovated in 1965 to become the Hansen Planetarium. After the planetarium closed and was replaced by the Clark Planetarium in 2003, the building was remodeled into the O.C. Tanner Company Flagship jewelry store, which opened in 2009. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Salt Lake City Public Library The first public library in Salt Lake City opened in 1898 and was located in the top floor of the Salt Lake City and County Building. After the library quickly outgrew the venue, the city began looking for a location to build a new library. A group of women called the Ladies Literary Society helped out by persuading the mining millionaire John Quackenbos Packard to donate land and money for the new building, which cost $100,000 at the time. The new library opened in 1905 with librarian Joanna Sprague, for whom the Sprague branch of the Salt Lake City Public Library system, also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is now named. The building would continue to serve as the main branch library until October 1964, when a new library building was constructed at 209 East 500 South. When the building was constructed, it was described as a \\"combination of the Doric and Ionian styles of architecture\\", and would later be classified in the Beaux Arts style. It was designed by Heins & LaFarge of New York City, and the local supervising architect was Frederick A. Hale. The library was three stories tall with a two-story entrance pavilion constructed of oolite limestone and of floor space. The roof was slightly flared, and the roofline was broken by a large carved stone gable with a center arched window and four decorated pilasters. The entrance pavilion's sides were curved around the spiral staircases at both ends of the entrance foyer. The pavilion was divided into three sections by four columns; each bay contained oak double doors leading to the foyer. After going through the foyer, the main reading room is revealed. In the center of the room stood a librarian's desk made of steel and topped by golden oak, the same finish of the interior of the entrance foyer. On the upper floor, the main auditorium contained seating for 350 people. Hansen Planetarium After the new library was constructed in 1964, Gail Plummer, professor of speech and drama at the University of Utah and chairman of the Salt Lake City Library board, expressed interest in converting the old library into a planetarium. Plummer had several conversations with Mrs. Beatrice M. Hansen, wife of the late George T. Hansen, in which Mrs. Hansen decided to fund the project. In 1965 she donated $400,000 to the city to build the planetarium in memory of her deceased husband. After Mrs. Hansen's death the building was renamed the Mr. and Mrs. George T. Hansen Planetarium, Space Science Library and Museum in honor of the couple. During its operation, the planetarium attracted 20% of the population of the city and had the highest per capita attendance of any planetarium in the nation. The Hansen Planetarium continued operation until April 2003, when it outgrew the building and was replaced by the Clark Planetarium in The Gateway. When the Hansen Planetarium occupied the building, the center doors of the entrance pavilion were replaced by a large sheet of glass, and the center part of the steps was replaced with a fountain. A mezzanine was added above the second floor in the entrance pavilion for exhibit in the planetarium. The same firm that did the original millwork for the 1904 building worked on these new additions. The local architect for the additions was Wesley Budd. A large dome was also added onto the rear wall of the building to give the planetarium extra space for its exhibits. O. C. Tanner Company After four years of lying vacant, the O. C. Tanner Company bought the building in 2007 for $1.2 million. Before Tanner came along, two referendums to fund the empty building were rejected, but the jeweling company's clear plan got the votes it needed. The company spent two years and $24 million renovating the building, which opened in September 2009. The company itself supplied a majority of the funds ($13‚Äì15 million), and the remainder came from the community. Upon the company's purchase of the building, O.C. Tanner's staff decided to try to mimic the original architecture as closely as possible. Because of this, the dome at the rear of the building was removed. Instead of simply demolishing the dome, however, it was systematically dismantled and donated to the Zion's Gateway to the Stars planetarium in Orderville, Utah. Also, the front staircase was restored to its original condition by removing the fountain in the center, which, coincidentally, was donated by O. C. Tanner himself. Only three of the four walls‚Äîthe sides and front‚Äîwere preserved in Tanner's restoration. Since the back had already been altered by the Hansen Planetarium and there were no original images of that wall from the 1905 building, Curtis Bennett, vice president of the company's retail operations, was allowed a little freedom with that design. The rear wall now consists of glass and stone, both etched with images of the building's history. The rear wall contains the largest laser stone-carving project in the world with 18 panels covering and weighing in all. The bottom of the rear wall contains repeated images from the library in 1905, the top contains images of a galaxy (signifying the Hansen Planetarium), and the middle contains an image of the founder of the company, O.C. Tanner. The image on the glass is a dot-matrix image, but the stone imaging required a new process developed specifically for this building. Inside the building, a new limestone spiral staircase was built with a Flora Cascade chandelier hanging in the center of the spiral. The chandelier was designed by Sharon Marston and includes about 4,000 strands of fiber optics, more than 14,000 interwoven shapes made of white polymer and steel, and about 3,000 golden and amber glass leaves. Weighing and extending from the ceiling, the chandelier stretches nearly the entire height of the building. ReferencesExternal links * O. C.

Within Order Primates, it is the most common social group type, with group sizes ranging from 10 to 100 individuals. Large groups of primates are called \\"troops\\". Examples of species that can be categorized under this type of social organization include many diurnal lemurs, langurs, and most members of the family Cebidae. Definition Multi- male groups, also known as multi-male/multi-female, are a type of social organization in which a group consists of more than one adult male, more than one adult female, and offspring. Within Order Primates, it is the most common social group type, with group sizes ranging from 10 to 100 individuals composed of several males, and numerous females and offspring. Large groups of primates are called \\"troops\\", which are characterized by complex intratroop politics and competition. Species Multi-male groups are most common among semi-terrestrial primates such as savanna baboons and macaques, but is also seen in some colobus and New World monkeys. Social lemurs sometimes often live in multi-male groups, and other primate species like chimpanzees live in fission-fusion multi-male groups. Female reproductive behavior In multi- male groups, there is typically no single male that has full control over the reproductive share of females. Instead, the top ranking males in the groups have an approximately equal share of siring all offspring born to females within the group. Females in multi-male groups will mate multiple times with different top ranking males as well as lower ranking males and occasionally bachelor \\"lone wolf\\" males outside of the group. Most female primates do not have a particular breeding season but can be receptive all year around, however they will most likely not mate if they are already caring for an infant. Parental care A traditional view of multi-male primate groups is held that males provide relatively little direct care to infants, possibly as a result of the low confidence of paternity that is associated with this relatively promiscuous breeding system. In the last five years this view has changed however, as a result of a careful documentation of intimate male- infant affiliations in certain species, especially the savanna-dwelling baboons (Papio spp.). Recent field studies of baboons suggest that male-infant relationships are mediated through affiliations between the males and the infants' mothers, but the degree to which these male-female affiliations are based on prior mating experience (hence, paternity) has not been established. Comparative studies of male-infant relations in primates have given little attention to the variation in the intensity and form of male care patterns within the set of species that have a multi-male social organization. Among multi-male species, male care of young is reported most often in baboons and barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) and least often in other macaques, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus). This interspecific variation may result both from differences in the importance of male care to infant survival and from differences in male confidence of paternity, which in turn may relate to seasonal breeding patterns and, in particular, to the presence or absence of conspicuous signs of ovulation in females. Infanticide In some multi-male groups, the costs for infanticidal males seem likely to be high, since other resident males might defend the victim, and the benefits seem likely to be low because of the generally lower paternal probability in multi-male groups. However, in other primate species living in multi-male groups, males have been observed to kill infants. The aggressors are typically extra-group males, recent immigrants, have recently been introduced or are conceived outside the group, mainly due to the fact that they could not possibly be related to the infants they kill. A male's age and rank influence the occurrence of infanticide. The youngest and highest- ranking immigrant males are more likely to commit infanticide than their older and lower-ranking counterparts if putative fathers fail to protect infants. Costs/benefits (trade-offs) A benefit of living in multi-male groups is the collective protection that the group as a whole receives from outsiders as well as sufficient protection of infants against infanticide from other outside roaming males. Another benefit is the low costs of finding a mate and reproducing since the males and females are always together. Also, participants in multi-male groups have better access to resources such as food and living quarters. However, a major cost to living in a multi-male group is the constant competition for mates, mainly among males but also among females. Interactions between overlapping multi-male groups Most non-human primate communities are more or less closed to contact with members of other communities. Most often, they are tied to a particular locale and rarely migrate outside of their home range. This aloofness from other troops prevents high concentrations of individuals, which could result in rapid depletion of local resources. Communities usually avoid each other and are aggressive towards outsiders. As a result, social interactions between members of different troops are usually very rare, especially for females. Chimpanzees are a notable exception. When chimpanzees from different troops come together, there is often an exciting, friendly encounter lasting several hours, following which, some of the adult females switch groups. Apparently, they are seeking new mates. Occasionally, however, contact between communities of the comparatively unpredictable chimpanzees will develop into genocidal violence. Interactions within non-human primate communities are usually unlimited. Subgroups are rarely closed from group interaction. All members of a community have daily face-to-face, casual interaction. The most common type of subgroup consists of a mother and her young offspring.

Family background √ì Maoil Eoin (now anglicised as Malone), denotes descent from a grandson of a person baptised in honour of Saint John. This assumption was introduced long after Maol Eoin had lived. It was contrived to demonstrate a long-standing association with the Church. As such \\"maol\\" is often described as meaning bald and then quickly followed by the idea of a monks shaved head. While \\"maol\\" does mean bald it also can mean thin. However, in both cases it is used in reference with the landscape; bald might mean lacking in trees, and thin might mean a peninsula or island. It defines a feature of the landscape that is associated with the family. The use of maol, in a family name, is found recorded some 200 years before Maol Eoin was born. Maolrunaigh (Mulrooney)was a past family name that was passed down, mostly in part, through the generations. This was a common way to include the name of the bride's father, as a mark of respect. If Maol Eoin means devotee of St John, then it would stand to reason that Maolrunaigh must be a devotee of St. Rooney. However, a St. Rooney does nor exist. The √ì Maoil Eoin were wrongly accorded kinship with the U√≠ Bri√∫in, based on the statement that \\"Maoliosa {son of Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair}, Bishop of Roscommon, who had a son named Maol Eoin ... a quo O'Maoil Eoin, anglicised Malone.\\" However, the family were already in existence before Tairrdelbach was born, so the kinship is mistaken, or possibly a forgery, though at least one very old family traditionP√°draig Malone holds the name was intended to signify a friendship or political alliance at the time of baptism. They seemed to have been an ecclesiastical or Erenagh family native to the area, with no links to any great royal houses. Abbot Gilla Cr√≠st Gilla Cr√≠st is the earliest known member of the family associated with Clonmacnoise, and perhaps the ancestor of all subsequent √ì Maoil Eoin's associated with it. He was associated with Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, as attested in an entry in Chronicon Scotorum sub anno 1124 - \\"The great bell-tower of Clua√≠n moccu N√≥is was completed by Gilla Cr√≠st ua Ma√≠leoin and Tairdelbach ua Conchobuir.\\" Two years later the same text records that \\"Gilla Cr√≠st ua Ma√≠leoin, abbot of Clua√≠n moccu N√≥is, the fount of wisdom and charity, the head of wealth and riches of Ireland, rested.\\" Chronicon Scotorum Chronicon Scotorum is an account of Irish affairs that ends in an unfinished manner in the entry dated 1150. Gilla Crist has been associated with the text as its compiler,Stokes, George Thomas: Ireland and the Anglo- Norman Church. A History of Ireland and Irish Christianity from the Anglo- Norman Conquest to the Dawn of the Protestant Reformation (1889), p 360: \\"...The Chronicon Scotorum was originally compiled about the year 1150 by Christian Malone, Abbot of Clonmacnis,...\\" but if so, it was continued at some point after his death. His actual role in relation to the Chronicon is uncertain. Later √ì M√°el E√≥in's and Malone's Subsequent abbots included * √Åed Ua M√°el E√≥in (died 1153) * Tigernach Ua M√°el E√≥in (died 1172).

A requirement was first identified in June 2008. Requirements= Air superiority fighter with multi-role capabilities  In April 2012, the Navy issued a formal request for information for the F/A-XX. It calls for an air superiority fighter with multi-role capabilities to initially complement and eventually supersede the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler aircraft in the 2030s, while complementing the F-35C Lightning II and UCLASS unmanned aircraft, that can operate in anti-access/area-denial environments. Primary missions include air combat, air to air, ground attack, surface warfare, and close air support. Platform requirements include super cruise capabilities as well as advanced next generation stealth features, sensors and radars with networking adaptability. Additional missions and capabilities include air-to-air refueling, reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA), and electronic warfare electronic attack and countermeasures thereof. Manned, unmanned, and optionally-manned operations for a highly adaptive platform will be part of the new system.Majumdar, Dave. \\"US Navy issues F/A-XX RfI.\\" Flight Global. April 17, 2012. The F/A-XX is being pursued as F/A-18 Super Hornets will reach the end of their 9,000 hours of service life by the early 2030s. Aside from the option of buying more F-35Cs, the F/A-XX is seeking to create a new aircraft to replace the Super Hornet's capability and mission set. Just as the F-35C will replace aging F/A-18 Hornets and complement Super Hornets, the F/A-XX will replace aging Super Hornets in the 2030s and complement the F-35C..  Maximum connectivity and sensors  Although the F/A-XX platform will be a sixth-generation fighter aircraft, the Navy is reluctant to talk about a new aircraft because the project is still in the very early stages of development. A range of next-generation technologies may be explored including maximum sensor connectivity, and electronically configured \\"smart skins.\\" Maximum connectivity refers to massively increased communications and sensor technology, such as having the ability to connect with satellites, other aircraft, and anything providing real-time battlefield information. Smart skins would have sensors and electronics integrated into the fuselage of the aircraft itself to increase sensor performance while reducing drag and increasing speed and maneuverability..  Open architecture  An open architecture design is desired, so different sensors, payloads, and weapons can be plugged in for a specific mission, and be able to be moved around for multiple different missions on different days or different sorties. The resulting open architecture design is likely to take shape depending on which style of new propulsion system is presented by the aircraft industry.  Propulsion  The Navy is working with the U.S. Air Force on a next- generation tactical fighter with super cruise ability, and there is significant disagreement over the Air Force's claims that adaptive-cycle jet engine technology, where the ratios of bypass and compression airflow can be made variable to improve efficiency, can be scaled to benefit a carrier-based fighter...  New spectrum of weapons  Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert speculated in February 2015 that the F/A-XX would not rely primarily on speed or stealth as much as previous generation jet fighters due to better signature detection and proliferating high-speed anti-aircraft weapons. Instead, in addition to its protective features provided by its stealth features, technologies, maneuverability and speed, the fighter is to carry a wide array of new spectrum of advanced weaponry to overwhelm or suppress enemy air defenses and ensure survivabilty and superiority. One approach could create a minimum cost F/A-XX that uses high cost, high performance weapons to defeat threats; according to the Navy's Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) battle network concept, an individual platform would not need to have a full suite of sensors and rely on off-board data-linked information from other platforms to provide targeting information and guide weapons launched from the platform. The F/A-XX platforms will be made to carry missiles, have power and cooling systems for directed-energy weapons, and have sensors that can target small radar cross-section targets; cyber warfare platforms at a tactical level as part of a family of systems are being explored.  Increased payload  The total payload capacity as well as the range and variety of weaponry and equipment of the F/A-XX will at least match or likely rather exceed the current platform i.e. Super Hornet's payload capacity and capabilities..  Unmanned  In May 2015, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus stated that the F/A-XX should be a platform with the capability of optional unmanned autonomous operation.. The effort may produce a family of systems to replace the capabilities of the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G rather than a single airframe, and the Navy is now conducting an analysis of alternatives for their next-generation aircraft in partnership with the Air Force.. Greenert favors an optionally manned aircraft for a modular section that can either hold a pilot or more sensors.  Aircraft carrier compatible  The aircraft must be capable of operating from Navy Nimitz-class and Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. Entries The Boeing F/A-XX concept design as of 2013 In July 2009, Boeing first publicly unveiled a sixth-generation fighter concept for the F/A-XX program requirement officially revealing its project development. Its renderings and concepts showed a stealth two-seat, twin-engined tailless jet with a blended wing fuselage. Featuring a tandem cockpit, Boeing disclosed that it is intended to be manned or unmanned depending on the mission. The fighter concept is in the weight class. The Northrop Grumman X-47B that was chosen for the UCAS-D program has also been proposed for the F/A-XX effort. Boeing unveiled an updated F/A-XX sixth- generation fighter concept in April 2013. The concept is a tailless twin- engine stealth fighter available in manned and unmanned configurations. It has canards, which usually compromises the frontal radar cross-section, but the lack of a tail shows an emphasis on all-aspect stealth. It also has diverterless supersonic inlets similar to the F-35. The manned version seems to have restricted rearward visibility without the aid of a sensor.Boeing unveils updated F/A-XX sixth-gen fighter concept - Flightglobal.com, 8 April 2013  Program timeline  As of 2011, the Department of Defense (DOD) planned to replace older F/A-18C/D Hornets with 220 F-35s. In March of that year, a Navy analysis of alternatives showed that it might buy more F-35C aircraft, develop a new platform, or do both for its NGAD fighter program. In a 31 May 2011 report to Congress, DOD revealed that it was considering buying more F-35C fighters to replace 556 Super Hornets.Lockheed F-35C emerges as candidate for future US Navy contract, Flight global, 2 June 2011 On 9 September 2014, the Navy announced that an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) for the F/A-XX aircraft would begin in 2015. Meetings with industry would be held focusing on building new aircraft to meet the requirement, developing a \\"family of systems\\" approach, and discussing mission systems, avionics, and new next-generation weapons systems. On 4 April 2019, RADM Scott D. Conn, director of Air Warfare in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, stated that the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the F/A-XX was to be completed in the spring of 2019, with a final report due in the summer of 2019. The Analysis of Alternatives for the F/A-XX program was completed in June 2019, and soon after the Navy began the concept development phase of the development process. However, concerns were raised about funding, with Bryan Clark of the Hudson Institute predicting that the program would evolve into a modification of the F-35 or F/A-18 Super Hornet. The USAF announced in September 2020 that a prototype next generation air dominance aircraft had been built and test flown.

Wheeler (1839-1906) was a prominent Illinois lawyer of the nineteenth century. Biography Samuel P. Wheeler was born in Binghamton, New York on January 12, 1839, the son of physician Dr. Alvan Wheeler. After high school, he moved to Illinois, initially finding work as a teacher. He was admitted to the bar of Illinois at age 20 and then established a law practice at Mound City, Illinois. He later moved his practice to Cairo, Illinois, where he was associated with William J. Allen. Wheeler practiced law in Cairo until 1887, although he did move to Mount Carmel, Illinois at one point to serve as a director of the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad. In 1887, Wheeler's longtime law partner William Joshua Allen was appointed as a United States federal judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois by President of the United States Grover Cleveland. At this point, Wheeler moved to Springfield, Illinois, joining the firm of Brown, Wheeler, Brown & Hay (the firm is still in existence, and has been known as Brown, Hay & Stephens since 1921). His colleagues there included Christopher C. Brown, John T. Stuart, and Benjamin S. Edwards. During his time at Springfield, Wheeler acted as receiver for the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad, the Jacksonville, Louisville and St. Louis Railway, and the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad. Wheeler was active in the Illinois State Bar Association, and took a special interest in advocating on behalf of the act that created the Illinois Appellate Court. When the constitutionality of this act was challenged, Wheeler, along with Anthony Thornton and Harvey B. Hurd argued successfully in favor of the act's constitutionality. Wheeler was elected president of the Illinois State Bar Association in 1893, succeeding Lyman Trumbull. Wheeler was active in the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Southern Illinois Normal School for twenty five years.

Offspring of both sexes are evicted from the group upon reaching puberty. It can be seen in many species of primates, including the gelada baboon, the patas monkey, savanna baboon, sun-tailed monkey, golden snub-nosed monkey, and the hamadryas baboon. There are costs and benefits for individuals living in one-male groups. As well, individuals within one-male groups can interact with each other just like individuals can interact with those from different one-male groups.  Origin  A study of savanna baboons (hamadryas ursinus) indicates that the one-male groups in this species are formed by fissioning. For example, a 100-month old male entered a multi male - multi female (mm) group then formed a one-male group with eight of the adult females in the MM group. Juveniles of the species, suspected to be young of the eight adult females, also joined the new one-male group. However, when a new male successfully enters a one-male group, the social hierarchy will be changed depending on the previously determined rankings of the newly entered male. The previous resident male of the one-male group may be out-ranked and therefore placed lower on the hierarchy of males.  Costs = Infanticide  One of the costs of living in one-male groups is the killing of unweaned young by conspecific adult males. This is known as infanticide, and mostly occurs when adult males or coalitions of males takeover the group and kill the resident male. This is done to increase the reproductive success of the intervening males because the females are more likely to mate with them now that they need to produce new offspring. While the infanticide is an obvious cost to females, it is beneficial to the infanticidal males. Infanticide in one-male groups has been studied in the Virungas population of mountain gorillas.  Inbreeding  Another cost of living in one-male social groups is that there is a high occurrence of inbreeding. This means that closely related individuals can mate and produce offspring. This results in decreasing genetic diversity with subsequent generations of the species. For example, inbreeding has been studied in one-male groups of sun-tailed monkeys (Cercopithecus solatus). In this study, the time between two births for females increased when an inbred offspring was born. This suggests that there could be increased maternal costs with giving birth to and rearing an inbred offspring, compared to a noninbred offspring. Inbreeding depression resulted from the decreased genetic diversity within this population, meaning that the population as a whole experienced a decrease in fitness (i.e. reproductive success). Unlike infanticide, the high occurrence of inbreeding in one-male groups is a disadvantageous to both the females and males in the group.  Benefits = Feeding advantages  Experiments involving the hamadryas baboon species (hamadryas hamadryas) provide evidence of feeding advantages for male and female members of one-male groups. However, the findings of feeding advantages were only evident when these one-male groups formed clans. It has been shown that males from single one-male groups did not approach males that were part of clans to compete for food sources. Additionally, it was found that males from smaller clans did not approach males from bigger clans (i.e. with more one-male groups) to compete for food. Ultimately, these feeding advantages of decreased competition were seen between one-male groups, not for males within the same groups or clans. In addition, it can be said that males and females in a clan have feeding advantages compared to males and females in single one-male groups because it has been shown that the males and females in clans gain access to clumped food sources earlier than those in single one-male groups and that they spend more time with clumped food sources than the single groups.  Within-group interactions = Female-female interactions  Studies of social interactions among golden snub‚Äênosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) reveal that adult females tend to interact with each other, but they do not form strong social bonds with other females in the same one-male group.  Female-male interactions  It has been shown that adult female golden snub-nosed monkeys do not form strong social relationships with the resident male in the one-male group. However, the adult females tended to interact more with other adult females instead of the resident male when they were looking for social interaction.  Patterns of social relationships  While researchers have found that individuals in one- male groups of hamadryas baboons exhibit a pattern of social relationships called a star-shaped relationship, it has been found that gelada baboon (Theropithecus gelada) individuals in one-male groups exhibit a net-shaped relationship pattern. Individuals in the snub-nosed monkey species exhibit a different pattern of social relationships than the two other baboon species.  Between-group interactions = Allomaternal nursing  In a study of social relationships among a clan (i.e. multiple one-male groups) of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti), it was determined that the adult females of one-male groups sometimes care for the young of other one-male groups. For example, when a mother and her young offspring were accidentally separated, a mother belonging to a different one-male group cared for the young. The separated young was nursed by the adoptive mother (who also nursed her own offspring) and tolerated by the resident male of the one-male group that the offspring was now temporarily apart of.  Affiliative interactions  Affiliative interactions between individuals of one-male groups include sitting near, grooming in front of, and handling the infants of other one-male groups. The most prevalent type of affiliative interaction seen in a study involving Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) is infant handling. This infant handling can form gatherings of multiple one-male units that forage together. This type of social structure is called a band.

Wonders of the Solar System was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on 7 March 2010. The series comprises five episodes, each of which focuses on an aspect of the Solar System and features a 'wonder' relevant to the theme. The series was described as one of the most successful to appear on BBC Two in recent years. An accompanying book with the same name was also published. On 31 March 2011, the series won the prestigious George Foster Peabody Award for excellence in documentary film-making.70th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2011. Episodes=1. \\"Empire of the Sun\\" The first episode illustrates how the formation and behaviour of the Sun affects each planet in the Solar System. During this episode, Cox visits India to view and explain the workings of a total solar eclipse and the partial eclipses that occur on other planets. He travels to the Iguazu Falls to relate the causality between river levels, and sunspot fluctuations. An explanation of the Earth's exposure to the power of the Sun occurs in Death Valley, California, US, with an experiment inspired by John Herschel's actinometer. He also travels to Norway to observe and explain the defensive role of the Earth's magnetosphere against the Sun's solar wind and its role in forming the Aurora Borealis. Cox then relates the Voyager missions and their continuing exploration of the massive reach of the Sun's gravitational forces on objects in the farthest regions of the Solar System. Finally, in the clear skies of the Atacama Desert, at the Paranal Observatory he is able to observe, with the naked eye, the myriad of stars on the Milky Way and relates the meaning of their diverse colours as mapped on the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram. 2. \\"Order Out of Chaos\\" Cox starts this episode in Al-Qayrawan, Tunisia to analyse the orbit of the planets around our Sun, with details on how the 23 degree tilt of the Earth creates the seasonal weather patterns. He also visits the Atlas Mountains, and relates how in clear night skies the ancients observed the rotation of the stars and the retrograde and prograde motion of Mars and the other wandering planets. In Oklahoma, US, he discusses the universal reach of the Coriolis effect and the importance of the conservation of angular momentum. Next, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory he examines how the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens space-probe's imagery provides an insight on the highly complex structure of the ice rings of Saturn, and its diverse array of moons, and how they can reveal insights into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. He also explains how Enceladus, as the most reflective object in the known universe, has been of interest due to its continental divide-like canyons and geysers (as also observed in parts of Iceland). In the Sahara Desert the formative effect of winds on sand-dune morphology is paralleled to that of the gravitational effect of Saturn's 61 known moons on the matter that composite the rings - a phenomenon called orbital resonance. 3. \\"The Thin Blue Line\\" The third episode looks at the atmosphere of the planets and moons of the Solar System, with Earth, Mars, and Venus being the main focus. The episode starts with Cox travelling to South Africa and taking a journey in an English Electric Lightning up to an altitude of 18 kilometres where the \\"thinness and fragility\\" of the atmosphere could be observed in the middle of the day. This is then contrasted with the planet-wide consequences of Mercury's depleted, and Venus' broiling greenhouse atmospheres. Later, the dunal morphology of the Namib Desert is compared to what is known of the surface and depleted atmosphere of Mars, and is used to give an explanation of how the Earth maintains its temperature. Cox then explains how the damaging effect of the Sun's solar wind is deflected by the Earth's magnetosphere. Next, he discusses the transformative effect of weather on a planet's surface, such as the global dust-storms on Mars or the electrical-storms of Jupiter. The episode continues with an in-depth comparison of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, using data gained from the Huygens probe's January 2005 descent down to the frigid methane surface of the moon. It ends with Cox comparing Earth's hydrological cycle with Titan's methanological one. 4. \\"Dead or Alive\\" The fourth episode begins at the Grand Canyon, Arizona, US, where Cox draws comparisons of the canyon to Mars and the massive Valles Marineris. A trip to Kƒ´lauea on Hawaii shows the constant geological activity of Earth, and again a comparison to Mars and the massive Olympus Mons is seen. Both comparisons are insightful in the sense that Earth's systems are still dynamic and active whereas Mars' have gradually slowed into inactivity. Cox then switches view closer to the Sun and the scorched greenhouse planet Venus, a planet often referred to as \\"Earth's twin\\", and compares it to the vulcan geology of the Deccan Plateau. An example of Earth's interconnectivity with the Solar System reveals that Jupiter's gravitational effect could potentially send an asteroid through the Asteroid Belt on a collision course with Earth, as evidenced by Meteor Crater. The same gravitational force is also shown to give the Jovian moon Io geological life (given the absence of meteor impact evidence there) as paralleled by the volcanism of Erta Ale in Ethiopia. All in all, with the universal laws of physics at play throughout the solar system, its interconnectedness can also be seen. 5. \\"Aliens\\" The final installment covers life surviving in extreme environments, and how the search for life on other worlds follows the search for water. Cox begins by travelling to the deep ocean to draw comparisons between life in the hostile conditions of the deep seabed (on the submersible DSV Alvin) and the parallel potential of non-Earth life. The absence of life-sustaining water in the Atacama Desert in South America is also viewed, which is cited to explain the lack of even basic microbial life there. A trip to the Scablands in North-West America is also made, with an explanation of the Missoula Floods that once occurred there, and how the tell- tale signature of water shaped the landscape geologically. The exploration of Mars has revealed possible evidence of its subterranean hydrology, and a visit to the Cueva de Villa Luz in Mexico shows how simple life-forms (such as archaea and snottites) survive in hostile conditions beneath the Earth. Conversely, the hostile frozen topography of Jupiter's moon Europa also reveals the presence and effects of sub-surface water, and Cox visits a cave in Vatnaj√∂kull to find microbial signs of life beneath the ice. Cox concludes by stating that Europa represents the \\"most fascinating and important alien world we know. A true wonder of the Solar System because it's our best hope of finding extraterrestrial life.\\" Merchandise An accompanying hardcover book was released on 30 September 2010: The region 1 DVD and Blu-ray discs were released on 7 September 2010.

After graduating from the United States Naval Academy, Milne served many posts in the Navy, including heading the Department of Modern Languages at the Naval Academy. He was a veteran of a large numbers of conflicts, including the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, the United States occupation of Veracruz, and both World War I and World War II. Milne commanded a number of ships, but his last one was the battleship '. After the ship struck a private fishing vessel and killed two civilians, Milne was court-martialed and stripped of three grades which determined his eligibility for promotion. As governor, Milne pushed for the modernization of American Samoa, and sought increased federal aid for the islands; his efforts to obtain additional funding for the island largely ended in failure. He died in 1959 at the Naval Hospital Oakland, and was buried in Sparkill, Rockland County, New York. Early life Milne was born on August 19, 1882, in Gauley Bridge, West Virginia. He married Natalie Elise Blauvelt on June 2, 1917. He lived most of his ashore life in Newport, Rhode Island. Because of his difficult to spell and overly-long given name, Milne always signed official letters \\"M. Milne\\". Naval service Milne aboard the USS Arizona. Milne graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1903, and served as a naval officer in multiple different wars, including the Philippine-American War, the United States occupation of Veracruz, and both World War I and World War II. He served a post at the United States Naval Academy. While there, he joined a panel of three other officers in researching the scholarship of student athletes at the Academy over a period of thirty years. The panel found that these athletes were likely to stay in the United States Navy for long periods of time, and were often career minded. At the Academy, Milne also served as head of the modern languages department. In 1932, Milne was one of few American military officers chosen to travel to Italy to inspect a number of war veterans alongside Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Mussolini had invited officers from numerous countries in an effort to improve relations. Milne then commanded the USS Arizona when, in 1934, the battleship collided with the private fishing vessel Umatilla off the coast of Neah Bay, Washington, on July 26, 1934. The collision split the Umatilla in half, and two of its crew drowned. Milne underwent a court martial, where the blame for the crash was placed upon him. The court stripped him of three grades of seniority within his rank, making it very difficult for him to be promoted. Milne had been ranked 149th in the Navy register, but retired with the rank he had at this time, that of Captain. Officials stated that the real punishment came from the \\"black mark\\" the court martial left upon Milne's record. His position on the Arizona ended soon after his conviction. Governorship Milne became the Governor of American Samoa on January 20, 1936, relieving Thomas Benjamin Fitzpatrick from command. He took steps in modernizing American Samoa; his wife appealed directly to First Lady of the United States Eleanor Roosevelt to help improve the state of the islands' indoor plumbing and sanitation systems. Among his projects, Milne tried to have a library built for use by the Samoans. Despite these efforts, neither of the two were able to acquire federal aid for the improvement of infrastructure. During his term, the inhabitants of American Samoa became increasingly Americanized.

Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India gave accreditation to the academy in 2004 and promoted it as 'centre of excellence' in 2008. Membership of the academy is open to anyone who has an interest in the academy's activities particularly on history of medicine and history of science. Being a charitable organization, donations to the Academy are also exempted from Income Tax under section 80G of the Income Tax Act 1961. The founder president is Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman. Ibn Sina Academy is a part of signatories related to various health issues in the world. History Mosaic of Iranian tiles calligraphically inscribed ‚ÄòIbn Sina Academy ...‚Äô (now destroyed during renovation; once installed at the main entrance) Foundation stone at the entrance gate of academy Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences is an extension of Majlis Ibn Sina, which was formed in 1965 under the aegis of Tibbi Academy. Majlis Ibn Sina was a sort of monthly discussion group. For instance, the first meeting of that Majlis was held to discuss typhoid.Al-Hikmat, Issue of July 1965, Ed. Syed Zillur Rahman Nadvi, Tibbi Academy, Delhi, Tibbi Academy was itself formed in 1963 at Bhopal. In a note on page 4, of the first book of Tibbi Academy, on Modern Times and Unani Medicine the author Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman announced the establishment of Tibbi Academy with its clear objective: \\"to publicise the theoretical principles and practical ideas of Unani medicine, to publish the text of standard works of Unani medicine and also their translations‚Ä¶ further, a learned and research oriented monthly journal\\". From 1965 to 1970, a monthly journal with the title Al-Hikmat (in Urdu) from Delhi was published under the auspices of Tibbi Academy under the editorship of Syed Zillur Rahman Nadvi. The editor stated in the introduction of the first issue (May 1965, page 2) that the journal is being issued. Further, besides the above-mentioned objectives, the editor listed a couple of additional objectives, e.g., \\"the search of manuscripts of the Unani medicine, their edition and publication, ‚Ä¶ to excite the feeling of the pressing need of Unani medicine literature, and to publish a standard book every year\\". He lamented that despite the publication of 30-40 Tibbi magazines in India, no learned journal of Unani medicine is being published. He stressed that Al-Hikmat would be a purely scholarly journal not confined to Unani medicine: It would include some articles on basic sciences, that is, zoology, botany, chemistry, physics, astronomy and philosophy. In 1970, Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman renamed the Tibbi Academy as Shifaul Mulk Memorial Committee after his teacher, Shifaul Mulk Hakim Abdul Latif (29 April 1900 ‚Äì 14 November 1970), former professor and principal of Ajmal Khan Tibbiya College, Aligarh Muslim University. The purpose of this memorial committee was the same as Tibbi Academy formed in 1963, except the widened scope of publications. All these past establishments ‚Äî Tibbi Academy (1963), Majlis Ibn Sina (1965) and Shifaul Mulk Memorial Committee (1970) ‚Äî merged and came under one trustee organisation, i.e., Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences in 2000.

After leaving the club he joined Williamstown and through good performances was recruited back to the league by Collingwood. He made six appearances in the 1941 season but then did not play football for a period due to the war. As the conflict neared the end he was back playing at Williamstown and starred from full-back in their 1945 premiership team. North Melbourne gave him another chance in 1946 and over the next five seasons he got regular games and took part in their 1949 finals series. Most notably, however, he was a centre half back in the 1950 VFL Grand Final loss to Essendon, their first ever premiership decider.

The diagrams that follow show these checkmates with White checkmating Black. Anastasia's mate In Anastasia's mate, a knight and rook team up to trap the opposing king between the side of the board on one side and a friendly piece on the other. Often, the queen is first sacrificed along the a-file or h-file to achieve the position. This checkmate got its name from the novel Anastasia und das Schachspiel by Johann Jakob Wilhelm Heinse.The original \\"Anastasia's mate\\" appeared in: Wilhelm Heinse, Anastasia und das Schachspiel: Briefe aus Italien vom Verfasser des Ardinghello [Anastasia and Chess: Letters from Italy by the author of Ardinghello] (Frankfurt am Main, (Germany): Tarrentrapp und Wenner, 1803), volume 2, pages 211‚Äì213. The original \\"Anastasia's mate\\" is reproduced in modern notion with illustrations, in: Wilhelm Heinse, Anastasia und das Schachspiel ‚Ä¶ (Hamburg, Germany: Jens-Erik Rudolph Verlag, 2010), page 162, example 2. Note: Nowadays, \\"Anastasia's mate\\" refers to a mate in which the checkmated king is on an edge of the board or in a corner of the board, whereas in the original mate, the king was near the center of the board.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 83. Anderssen's mate In Anderssen's mate (named for Adolf Anderssen), the rook or queen is supported by a diagonally attacking piece such as a pawn or bishop as it checkmates the opposing king along the eighth rank. Sometimes a distinction is drawn between Anderssen's mate, where the rook is supported by a pawn (which itself is supported by another piece, as in the diagram), and Mayet's mate, where the rook is supported by a distant bishop. Arabian mate In the Arabian mate, the knight and the rook team up to trap the opposing king on a corner of the board. The rook sits on a square adjacent to the king both to prevent escape along the diagonal and to deliver checkmate while the knight sits two squares away diagonally from the king to prevent escape on the square next to the king and to protect the rook.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 182. In addition to being among the most common mating patterns, the Arabian mate is also an important topic in the context of history of chess for two reasons: 1) it is mentioned in ancient Arabic manuscripts, and 2) it is derived from the older, Persian form of chess where the knight and the rook were the two most powerful pieces in the game, before chess had migrated to Europe and the queen given its current powers of movement. Back-rank mate The back-rank mate occurs when a rook or queen checkmates a king that is blocked in by its own pieces (usually pawns) on the first or eighth rank. Bishop and knight mate One of the four basic checkmates alongside the Queen mate, the Rook mate, and the king and two bishops mate, the bishop and knight mate occurs when the king works together with a bishop and knight to force the opponent king to the corner of the board. The bishop and knight endgame can be difficult to master: some positions may require up to 34 moves of perfect play before checkmate can be delivered. Blackburne's mate Blackburne's mate is named for Joseph Henry Blackburne and is a rare method of checkmating. The checkmate utilizes enemy pieces (typically a rook) and/or the edge of the board, together with a friendly knight, to confine the enemy king's sideways escape, while a friendly bishop pair takes the remaining two diagonals off from the enemy king.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 94. Threatening Blackburne's mate, which sometimes goes in conjunction with a queen sacrifice, can be used to weaken Black's position. Blind swine mate { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\" } The name of this pattern is attributed to Polish master Dawid Janowski who referred to on a player's 7th rank as \\"swine\\".MacEnulty, David, The Chess Kid's Book of Checkmate, chap. 21 ‚Äì The Blind Swine Checkmate, pp. 29‚Äì30, Random House Puzzles & Games, 2004, , 9780812935943 In the first diagram and assuming there are no interferences, White can force checkmate as follows: :1. Rxg7+ Kh8 :2. Rxh7+ Kg8 :3. Rbg7# For this type of mate, the rooks on White's 7th rank can start on any two files from a to e, and although black pawns are commonly present as shown, they are not necessary to deliver the mate. The second diagram shows the final position after checkmate. (In the book My System, Nimzowitsch refers to this type of mate as: \\"The seventh rank, absolute.\\") Boden's mate In Boden's mate two attacking bishops on criss-crossing diagonals deliver mate to a king obstructed by friendly pieces, usually a rook and a pawn.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 89.R. Schulder vs. Samuel Boden (London, 1853). Box mate (Rook mate) The Box mate is one of the four basic checkmates along with the Queen mate, the king and two bishops checkmate, and the bishop and knight checkmate. It occurs when the side with the king and rook box in the bare king to the corner or edge of the board. The mate is delivered by the rook along the edge rank or file, and escape towards the centre of the board is blocked by the king. Corner mate The Corner mate is a common method of checkmating. It works by confining the king to the corner using a rook or queen with a pawn blocking the final escape square and using a minor piece to engage the checkmate. Cozio's mate { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + An archetypal Cozio's mate } Cozio's mate is a common method of checkmating. It was named after a study by Carlo Cozio, published in 1766. Another name for this mate is Dovetail mate. It involves trapping the black king in the pattern shown. It does not matter how the queen is supported and it does not matter which type Black's other two pieces are so long as neither is an unpinned knight. See also Swallow's tail mate. Damiano's bishop mate Damiano's bishop mate is a classic method of checkmating. The checkmate utilizes a queen and bishop, where the bishop is used to support the queen and the queen is used to engage the checkmate. The checkmate is named after Pedro Damiano. Damiano's mate Damiano's mate is a classic method of checkmating and one of the oldest. It works by confining the king with a pawn and using a queen to initiate the final blow. Damiano's mate is often arrived at by first sacrificing a rook on the h-file, then checking the king with the queen on the a-file or h-file, and then moving in for the mate. The checkmate was first published by Pedro Damiano in 1512.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 136. In Damiano's publication he failed to place the white king on the board which resulted in it not being entered into many chess databases due to their rejection of illegal positions. David and Goliath mate The David and Goliath mate is a common method of checkmating. Although the David and Goliath mate can take many forms, it is characterized generally as a mate in which a pawn is the final attacking piece and where enemy pawns are nearby. Its name is taken from the biblical account of David and Goliath. Double bishop mate The Double bishop mate is a classic method of checkmating. It is similar to Boden's mate, but a bit simpler. The checkmate involves attacking the king using two bishops, resulting in the king being trapped behind a pawn that has not been moved. Dovetail mate See Cozio's mate. Epaulette mate Epaulette or Epaulet mate is, in its broadest definition, a checkmate where two parallel retreat squares for a checked king are occupied by its own pieces, preventing its escape.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 46. The most common Epaulette mate involves the king on its back rank, trapped between two rooks.\\" Checkmates with Names\\", Mark Weeks, About.com: Chess The perceived visual similarity between the rooks and epaulettes, ornamental shoulder pieces worn on military uniforms, gives the checkmate its name. ;Example game *Carlsen‚ÄìErnst, Wijk aan Zee 2004; a thirteen-year-old Magnus Carlsen achieves an unusual \\"sideways\\" Epaulette mate against Sipke Ernst on his way to winning the C Group at the Corus chess tournament in 2004.\\"The Mozart of Chess\\", Mathias Berntsen, Chessbase.com, January 27, 2004 Fool‚Äôs mate Fool‚Äôs mate is an opening mate characterised by the sequence of moves 1. f3 e5 2. g4 Qh4#. It is the quickest checkmate in chess. Greco's mate Greco's mate is a common method of checkmating. The checkmate is named after the famous Italian checkmate cataloguer Gioachino Greco. It works by using the bishop to contain the black king by use of the black g-pawn and subsequently using the queen or a rook to checkmate the king by moving it to the edge of the board.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 75. Hook mate The Hook mate involves the use of a rook, knight, and pawn along with one enemy pawn to limit the enemy king's escape. The rook is protected by the knight, and the knight is protected by the pawn, while the pawn also attacks one of the enemy king's escape squares. Kill Box mate The Kill Box mate is a box-shaped checkmate. The checkmate is delivered by a rook with the queen's assistance. The rook is adjacent to the king, while the queen supports the rook, being separated from it by one empty square on the same diagonal as the rook. This forms a 3 by 3 box shape, inside which the enemy king is trapped. The king could be anywhere on the board, but must have no escape squares available to him due either to being on the edge of the board or to being blocked off by friendly or enemy pieces. King and two bishops mate The king and two bishops checkmate is one of the four basic checkmates along with the Queen mate, the Rook mate, and the bishop and knight checkmate. It occurs when the king with two bishops force the bare king to the corner of the board to force a possible mate. King and two knights mate In a two knights endgame, the side with the king and two knights cannot checkmate a bare king by force. This endgame should be a draw if the bare king plays correctly. A mate only occurs if the player with the bare king blunders. In some circumstances, if the side with the king also has a pawn, it is possible to set up this type of checkmate. Ladder checkmate { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\" } In the ladder checkmate, also known as the Lawnmower Mate, two major pieces (which can be two queens, two rooks or one rook and one queen) work together to push the enemy king to one side of the board. L√©gal mate { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\" } In the L√©gal mate, two knights and a bishop coordinate to administer checkmate. Alternatively, the mate may be delivered by a bishop on g5. Lolli's mate Lolli's mate is a common method of checkmating. The checkmate involves infiltrating Black's fianchetto position using both a pawn and queen. The queen often gets to the h6-square by means of sacrifices on the h-file. It is named after Giambattista Lolli. Max Lange's mate Max Lange's mate is a less common method of checkmating. The checkmate is named after Max Lange. It works by using the bishop and queen to checkmate the king. Mayet's mate Mayet's mate involves the use of a rook attacking the black king supported by a bishop. It often comes about after the black king castles on its kingside in a fianchetto position. White usually arrives at this position after a series of sacrifices on the a-file h-file. It is a type of Anderssen's mate and closely resembles the Opera mate. The \\"h-file\\" mate is an apt description, but the pattern is properly called \\"Mayet's mate\\" after the German player C/Karl Mayet (born Aug-11-1810, died May-18-1868, 57 years old). See variation description in Anderssen's mate given above. Reference Chapter 10, p. 107 of \\"The Art of the Checkmate\\" by Georges Renaud and Victor Kahn (Champions of France, 1923 and 1934). . Morphy's mate { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\" } Morphy's mate is a common method of checkmating. It was named after Paul Morphy. It works by using the bishop to attack the black king and a rook and Black's own pawn to confine it.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 142.This mate derives from the game Louis Paulsen vs. Paul Morphy (November 8, 1857 in New York City, New York (First American Chess Congress)). Morphy didn't use this mating pattern to defeat Paulsen; instead, Morphy sacrificed his queen to remove the pawn in front of White's castled king, exposing the king to series of checks by Black's rook and bishop. (Morphy then added more pieces to the attack against White's king, rendering White's position hopeless; so White resigned.) In many respects it is very similar to the Corner mate. Opera mate The Opera mate is a common method of checkmating. It works by attacking an uncastled king on the back rank with a rook using a bishop to protect it. An enemy pawn or a piece other than a knight is used to restrict the enemy king's movement. It is a type of Anderssen's mate and closely resembles Mayet's mate. The checkmate was named after its implementation by Paul Morphy in 1858 at a game at the Paris opera against Duke Karl of Brunswick and Count Isouard; see Opera game. Pillsbury's mate { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\" } Pillsbury's mate Teach Yourself Visually Chess By Jon Edwards is a common method of checkmating and is named for Harry Nelson Pillsbury. It works by attacking the king with the rook while the bishop is cutting off the king.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 128. Queen mate Queen mate is one of the four major checkmates along with Box mate, king and two bishops checkmate, and bishop and knight checkmate. It occurs when the side with the king and queen force the bare king to the edge or corner of the board. The queen checkmates the bare king with the support of the allied king. R√©ti's mate R√©ti's mate is a famous method of checkmating. The checkmate is named after Richard R√©ti, who delivered it in an 11-move game against Savielly Tartakower in 1910 in Vienna. It works by trapping the enemy king with four of its own pieces that are situated on flight squares and then attacking it with a bishop that is protected by a rook or queen. Smothered mate Smothered mate is a common method of checkmating. It occurs when a knight checkmates a king that is smothered (surrounded) by his friendly pieces and he has nowhere to move nor is there any way to capture the knight.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 35. It is also known as Philidor's Legacy after Fran√ßois-Andr√© Danican Philidor, though its documentation predates Philidor by several hundred years. Suffocation mate The Suffocation mate is a common method of checkmating. It works by using the knight to attack the enemy king and the bishop to confine the king's escape routes. Swallow's tail mate Swallow's tail mate also known as the Gu√©ridon mate is a common method of checkmating. It works by attacking the enemy king with a queen that is protected by a rook or other piece. The enemy king's own pieces (in this example, rooks) block its means of escape.Renaud and Kahn (1962), p. 44. It resembles the Epaulette mate.

Models have always been made in France, but the company has gone through several ownership changes. Today, though now focusing on model trucks, Eligor is one of the few diecast modelers still making its vehicles in Europe. Origins Eligor was established about 1976, in Martignat, France (about 30 miles west of Geneva), by Jacques Greilsamer, who had previously written the Catalogue of Model Cars of the World (Greilsamer and Azema 1967; Eligor Vintage 2003). The location is interesting as Martignat is just south of Oyonnax, the home of plastic model maker Minialuxe and origin of Norev. Greilsamer used older molds previously used by Norev in making plastic models (Rixon 2005, p. 73; Miniature Car 2004). Eligor's models, however, were diecast metal. In an interesting parallel development in Germany, the Danhausen Catalog would eventually give birth to the Minichamps brand in Germany. In occult circles, Eligor is a powerful demon, but here the name simply reflected Greilsamer's 1976 combination of the names of two garages of his father - \\"ELITE\\" and \\"VIGOR\\" (Eligor website). The company was later purchased by Louis Surber, who had reproduced earlier Quiralu model cars and trucks (Rixon 2005, p. 73). For a time the company was headquartered in Paris. Early catalogs stated in French that Eligor's purpose was \\"Model Production\\". Further boxes and catalogs stated that the company made \\"the Miniature Automobile of the Connoisseur\\". Later Eligor was acquired by HobbyCar S.A. in Lausanne, Switzerland. In this period, when stating the name of \\"Hobbycar S.A.\\" packaging and catalogs proposed the idea of \\"Creation ‚Äì Diffusion\\", which sounds more like Christian Evangelicalism instead of model car production (Eligor catalog). In 1996 Eligor was bought by Paul and Anne Marie Vullierme, the founder of Vulli and the son of Joseph Vullierme who created Jouets MontBlanc that had made miniature cars in the early 1960s. In 1998, they relocated the company to Izernore, France just to the east of the old home of Martignat (Eligor Vintage 2003). Their son John Vullierme operated the U.S. office of the company in Earlysville, Virginia. Diecast approach Eligor began making diecast vehicles in much the same vein as Italian Brumm, Portuguese Vitesse or Italian RIO. Models were designed not for children, but with the adult hobbyist in mind. French vehicles from the 1930s to the 1960s were common in the Eligor line, such as Bugattis and Delages from the 1930s all the way up to Citroens, Peugeots, and some unique Panhards from the 1960s. Similar to Brumm and RIO models Eligors were frequently offered in 'top-up' and 'top-down' versions, but collecting promoter David Sinclair noted that early on some models like the 1928 Rolls-Royce and the 1930 Talbot apparently shared the same basic casting dies (Sinclair's 1980; Levine 2009). This was very unlike the realism of RIO and Brumm, but Eligor greatly improved in quality and precision through the 1980s. The brand lineup was not excessively ethnocentrically French like Solido became, however, and has offered German BMWs and Opels, British Triumphs, Ford Cortinas, Jaguars, the Mini, and a Rolls Royce and Bentley. Italian Lancias and an American Chrysler, Chevrolet Corvair and a Ford Model A were also offered. As with Brumm and Vitesse, many different liveries make a model go a long way, and this has been no different for Eligor. Military offerings like the French F.F.I. Citroen Traction Avant appeared. The Ford Model A around 1990 was offered in at least 29 different variations, including tow truck, ambulance, milk truck, several fire variations, a pickup, and van. The model selection is not as early 19th century as RIO or Brumm, but the feeling is similar. With the occasional American car like the 1958 Chrysler Newport convertible in the same line with a 1925 Citroen, perhaps Eligor is most like Vitesse or the shorter lived Rextoys in its offerings and 'feel'. Case study The 1963 Triumph TR-5 Monte Carlo ragtop is a good model to analyze for comparative detail. The model's exterior is superior. It is exceptionally well proportioned, with yellow lenses for front 'fog' lamps and nicely painted rear taillights. Monte Carlo decals are simply stuck on, but are tasteful. Quite rare for the time period and unlike Brumm, however, all features open and the ragtop is removable. In this area, the Triumph is a much better deal cost-wise, though Brumm cars carry more accuracy in their specific racing heritages. The Triumph interior is well apportioned. Wheels are plastic but with an impressive and authentic wire design capped by spinners. Another notable feature of the Triumph is that all opening parts, hood trunk, and doors, have their interior sides painted black ‚Äì where other manufacturers either simply paint these areas in body color or leave them unpainted with sloppy paint over-spray. Less authentic looking is the engine compartment which appears as a cheap diecast base with various 'bumps' sprayed silver. Packaging and logo The typical Eligor box was not very handsome ‚Äì in fact rather cartoonish. Standard cardboard box colors were heavily saturated blue and green without much of a busy appearance. Cars came inside a normal plastic display case within the cardboard carton. The logo and script was not particularly attractive, but it was unique. Letters in the word 'Eligor' were in a fat \\"Pac-Man\\"-style font in green and outlined with white. To the right extending away from the logo, a simple drawn hand grasped a small car. Circa 2010 the logo lettering has changed a bit to more handsome serif letters, but the hand grasping the car remained. Eligor today Many of the cars offered 20 years ago are still offered today, but new models have also been released, including classic Bugattis and racing Mercedes-Benzes. The focus, however, is still on French Peugeots, Citroens, Renaults and older French makes including the likes of Panhard and Talbot. Eligor offers several variations on the Dacia Logan, which is a Renault made in Romania. New and old models continue to be offered in a variety of detailed liveries. As time has passed Eligor resembles revered (but less sophisticated) Solido and Vitesse less and less and Brumm and Rio Models more and more. This Kamaz rally truck shows the company's later emphasis ‚Äì car models are no longer produced. Into the new millennium, Eligor now offers a complete set of trucks and buses, mostly in 1:64 scale ‚Äì about 30 different models are available in several hundred different liveries (Eligor Vintage 2003). One emphasis is on racing trucks and racing liveries (Kamaz and Renault) while standard articulated tractor trailer rigs seem a backbone. Mercedes, Freightliner, and Renault vans are also offered. DAF, MAN, Freightliner, Mercedes, Volvo, Kamaz, Renault, historic Sinpar and Hotchkiss, Iveco, and Scania are all represented. The change from 1930s vehicles to trucks is interesting, but not unprecedented. Model car companies Tekno (from Denmark), and Lion Toys (the Netherlands) also made the transition from car models to exclusively offering trucks. In this area, the company has built up its promotional offerings, especially with silk screening on the sides of the trucks ‚Äì sort of becoming the French Winross. The Eligor website runs through more than 25 different liveries that have been produced for different (mostly European) companies. References *Eligor catalog. Ca. 1990.

Mussolini experienced a number of personal troubles; he had difficulty in finding employment and became an alcoholic. Political activism and views Mussolini entered politics in 1873 at the age of nineteen as a revolutionary socialist militant. In 1874, Mussolini took part in political disturbances in Predappio, Italy. Mussolini became a member of local government and was known by authorities for controversy and political violence against opponents. Mussolini was ill-tempered towards his opponents and in 1878, police warned Mussolini to cease threatening his opponents with the destruction of their property.Roberts, Jeremy. Benito Mussolini. A & E; Twenty-First Century Books, 2006. Pp. 11. He was arrested in 1878 on the suspicion of taking part in revolutionary activities and remained under house arrest until authorities released him in 1882 so that he could attend his marriage to Rosa Maltoni. Mussolini believed that the government should control the mode of production, that working conditions needed to be improved, and supported the creation of a society run by the working-class. Mussolini held Italian nationalist sentiments and idolized Italian nationalist figures with socialist or humanist tendencies such as Carlo Pisacane, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Giuseppe Garibaldi. Alessandro Mussolini's political outlook combined the views of anarchist figures like Carlo Cafiero and Mikhail Bakunin, the military authoritarianism of Garibaldi, and the nationalism of Mazzini.Gregor, Anthony James.

She died on 19 December 739.The Annals of Ulster, edited by Se√°n Mac Airt and Gear√≥id Mac Niocaill, 2 volumes. (Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1983‚Äì84). (Annals of Ulster at CELT) Manuscript Tradition The only extant Life of St Samthann survives in three manuscripts, with the most complete form being in an early fourteenth-century manuscript, in Oxford, at the Bodleian Library, Rawlinson B. 485 ff.150-3, as part of the Codex Insulensis.Kenney, J. F. The Sources for the Early History of Ireland: Ecclesiastical, (1929), (Reprinted New York: Octagon Books, 1966) ¬ß465 p. 253. Charles Plummer used all three manuscripts in his edition of the text, and notes that the other two forms of the Life are dependent on the Bodleian one. In addition to Plummer's Latin edition, the Life has also been translated into English by Dorothy Africa. There is only a small degree of variation between the three manuscripts, and no important omissions or additions, supporting the belief that this was a fairly faithful copy of the posited original that had undergone no drastic ecclesiastical editing.Kenney, Sources, pp. 306‚Äì7; Plummer, VSH I, pp. ix‚Äìxxiii; Plummer, Charles, ‚ÄúOn Two Collections of Latin Lives of Irish Saints in the Bodleian Library, Rawlinson B 484 and B 505,‚Äù Zeitschrift f√ºr Celtische Philologie, 5 (1905), pp. 429‚Äì54. The author's Latin is somewhat stilted, and prone to the occasional clich√©d metaphorical phrase, but falls short of the overly convoluted style favoured in Late Latin writing. With one exception, the chronology of the Life follows a straightforward pattern beginning with the saint's marriage and ending with her death. The exception is a miracle regarding the saint's staff, occurring at chapter seventeen, which, whilst not specifically stated as such, would logically appear to belong after the saint's death.Vita Samthanne, ¬ß17. The only other apparent error is in the final chapter, where Lasrianus, the founder of Devenish in Lough Erne, who died nearly two centuries earlier is represented as still being alive at the time of Samthann's death.Vita Samthanne, ¬ß26. Plummer ascribes this error to the writer's ignorance of the name of the then abbot of Devenish (he is unnamed when previously mentioned in ¬ß10), believing that he inserted the only abbot he did know, whose Life he may well have had access to.Plummmer, VSH I, p. lxxxviii. Overall the consistency of style and language in addition to the cohesive chronology all point to a single author or redactor.Dorothy Ann Bray, ‚ÄúMotival Derivation in the Life of St Samthann,‚Äù Studia Celtica, 20‚Äì21 (1985‚Äì1986), p. 78. There is nothing in the Life itself to give a clear indication as to its date of composition and the date of the posited original has been given as anywhere between the late eighthAfrica, ‚ÄúLife of the Holy Virgin Samthann,‚Äù p. 101. to the late thirteenth century.Bray, ‚ÄúMotival Derivation,‚Äù p. 78-9. Associated evidence, however, such as the relatively short period of prominence for the monastery at Clonbroney (the convent, which may have been founded as early as the fifth century, fades from the records after the death of Abbess Caillechdomhnaill in 1163),Africa, ‚ÄúLife of the Holy Virgin Samthann,‚Äù pp. 97‚Äì8. the use of individual names (in particular Niall, son of Fergal, king of Cen√©l √âogain, and U√≠ N√©ill overlord from 763‚Äì770 and Flann son of Connla),Vita Samthanne, ¬ß¬ß17, 13. and the association of the monastery in the mid- to late eighth century with the royal family of Tethba, in Cairpre Gabra, all support the notion that this Life was initially composed within a few generations of the saint's death, and is a well-preserved late eighth to early ninth century Life. Biography Of the four female early Irish saints with extant Latin Lives (Saints Brigit, √çte, Monenna and Samthann), chronologically Samthann is the latest, with the Annals of Ulster listing her death in 739. This is also the earliest annals mention of her monastery at Clonbroney (Ir. Cl√∫an-br√≥aig) near modern Ballinalee, County Longford.Africa, \\"Life of the Holy Virgin Samthann,‚Äù p. 97. References to the monastery continue sporadically throughout the mid eighth through to the early ninth centuries, and then very rarely thereafter.Africa, \\"Life of the Holy Virgin Samthann,‚Äù p. 98. Unlike the three sixth century female monastic saints, Samthann was not the founder of her monastery, but rather inherited after the existing abbess and founder Fuinnech had a fiery prophetic vision of Samthann's grandeur.Vita Samthanne, ¬ß5. On the strength of this Samthann moved from her initial monastery at Urney in Tyrone where she served as a stewardess,Vita Samthanne, ¬ß4. south to Clonbroney, which was located just east of the modern town of Longford. The Tripartite Life of Patrick asserts that Clonbroney was founded by Patrick for two sisters both named Emer, whose brother Guasacht he made bishop of Granard. All three were the children of Milch√∫, whom Patrick served as slave in Ulster in his youth. While the story is literally implausible, there does seem to be an association between Samthann and Granard since in the Life she travelled there. Samthann also has an Ulster origin and the genealogies tie her family closely to Patrick in the Tripartite Life. The Giant Eel According to the Life, on one occasion a lascivious monk visited the saint's monastery and attempted to seduce one of the virgins living there. When he left the monastery and crossed the river to meet the girl a giant eel rose out of the water, bit him on the genitals and wrapped itself around his waist. The eel remained in this position until the monk returned to the monastery and begged for and received forgiveness from St Samthann.Vita Samthanne, ¬ß11. Other sources Samthann has also been associated with the C√©li D√© reform movement both through some of the sections of her Life as well as through both the document known as the Monastery of Tallaght which records her dealing with the chief reformer St. Maelrain and the Martyrology of Tallaght which includes a hymn to her in the marginalia which reflects the teachings of her Life regarding peregrinatio.Bray, \\"Motival Derivations,‚Äù pp.79, 83. Poet The Annals of Tigernach record the following verses, written about the 737 battle of Uchbad: Madh con-r√≠set in da Aedh bidh mor-saeth a n-ergairi, madadh codhal dam-sa is saeth Aed la h-Aedh mac Fergaili.

(9 March 1629 ‚Äì 30 January 1710) was a Catholic priest and a member of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri. He is called the Apostle of Turin for his long years of service to the people of that city, where he served as the provost of the local Oratory for many years. Life Valfr√® was born in Verduno, then in the Duchy of Savoy, now in the Province of Cuneo in the Piedmont region of Italy. He was born to a poor family but through struggle and effort he managed to attend various universities in the region, until he graduated from the University of Turin. Valfr√® joined the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri in Turin on 26 May 1651, the feast day of their founder, St. Philip Neri, and was ordained a priest on the following 24 February. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Theology in 1656. In his ministry to the people of Turin, Valfr√® gained a reputation for caring for the sick and as a confessor with deep insight. He became the confessor for Duke Victor Amadeus II of the House of Savoy and many of the members of the royal court. He had a strong concern too, though, for the poor and needy of the kingdom, finding help for the widows and orphans and providing comfort to prisoners, whom he would visit. He eventually was offered the office of Archbishop of Turin, but declined the appointment. Fr. Valfre is known for his service to the poor during the famine of 1678-80 and the 17-week siege of Turin during the war between Piemonte and Louis XIV. He is still invoked as patron of military chaplains for his ministry to soldiers during the war.\\"Blessed Sebastian Valfre, C.O.\\", The New Brunswick Oratory of St. Philip Neri Valfr√® had a great devotion to the Shroud of Turin, and he can be seen in an illustration from the period supervising some repair work done on it in 1694. He also had a concern for the religious education of the people, personally instructing many in the teachings of the Catholic faith as found in the Catechism of the Council of Trent. Additionally, out his devotion to the Blessed Mother, he inspired the duke to erect the Basilica of Superga. Valfr√®'s interests and influence were not limited to the duchy. He helped to found the Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles in Rome in 1701, which was established to train diplomats for the Papal States. Under its current name of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, it still fulfills that function for the Vatican City State. Valfr√® died in Turin on January 30, 1710, and his remains are now preserved in a silver urn in the Oratory Church of Turin. He was beatified by Pope Gregory XVI on 15 July 1834, with his feast day celebrated by the Congregation of the Oratory on 30 January.

He served as Bishop of Santa Rosa (1962‚Äì69) and Bishop of San Diego (1969-90). Early life and education Leo Maher was born in Mount Union, Iowa, the fifth of nine children of Thomas Joseph Maher (1862-1941) and Mary Agnes Teberg (1886-1946). His father was a native of Shankill, County Kilkenny, Ireland. As a child, he moved to California where he lived with his uncle, Rev. Edward J. Maher (1879-1960), pastor of St. Patrick Church in Oakland. His uncle spoke of his seminary life 1900-1906 at St. Patrick Seminary in Thurles, Ireland. Leo Maher attended from 1927-1929 St. Patrick Elementary School in Oakland. In 1929 Leo began his studies for the priesthood at St. Joseph High School and St. Joseph's College, both in Mountain View, California. Edward J. Maher was appointed a Domestic Prelate on July 2, 1939 by Pope Pius XII. His nephew attended his uncle's investiture as Right Reverend Monsignor at St. Patrick's Church in San Jose by Archbishop John Joseph Mitty. Leo started the major seminary in 1938 and completed his theological studies in 1943 at Saint Patrick Seminary, Menlo Park. Priesthood Leo Thomas Maher was ordained a priest by Archbishop Mitty on December 18, 1943, at St. Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco. His first assignment was as a curate at Holy Name of Jesus Church in San Francisco, where he remained for one year before serving at the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption (1944‚Äì47). He organized the prayer service for the 1945 meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco. From 1947‚Äì61, he served as secretary to Archbishop Mitty. He was named a domestic prelate by Pope Pius XII on November 4, 1954. He served as chancellor of the Archdiocese of San Francisco from 1956‚Äì62. Episcopacy=Santa Rosa On January 27, 1962, Leo Maher was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Santa Rosa by Pope John XXIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 5 from Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi, with Bishops Hugh Aloysius Donohoe and Merlin Joseph Guilfoyle serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption. During his seven-year tenure, he led a program to build new parishes and schools to serve the increasing Catholic population in the diocese, culminating in the establishment of seven parishes, one mission, three high schools, four elementary schools, and several rectories and convents. He also elevated three missions to parish status and oversaw major renovations of four existing parish churches. He attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council between 1962‚Äì65. San Diego Following the promotion of Bishop Francis James Furey to the Archdiocese of San Antonio, Maher was named the third Bishop of San Diego on August 22, 1969. At the time of his arrival, the Diocese of San Diego was about $15 million in debt, which Maher fully retired by 1980. He presided over the second diocesan synod from 1973 to 1976, revising the statutes and guidelines of the diocese to implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. In 1976 he created the first Diocesan Pastoral Council. He ended the official relationship between the diocese and the University of San Diego, establishing the school as a separate corporation. Maher was a strong supporter of the ecumenical movement, co- founding the San Diego County Ecumenical Conference and issuing joint statements on morality with non-Catholic religious leaders. He also supported workers' rights to organize into unions, but pledged an official neutrality in a farm labor dispute in 1971. That same year, he suspended Father Victor Salandini, a San Diego priest and ally of C√©sar Ch√°vez, for wearing a serape with the black eagle of the United Farm Workers instead of proper vestments and for using corn tortillas instead of sacramental bread during his Masses. In 1975, he prohibited Catholics who are members of pro-choice organizations from receiving communion or serving as lectors, specifically citing the National Organization for Women for its \\"shameless agitation.\\" In 1980, Maher issued a public condemnation of the Ku Klux Klan, saying that knowingly voting for a racist or a Klan member may constitute a sin. He prohibited priests from celebrating Mass for Dignity, a pro-LGBT Catholic organization, but once celebrated a Mass himself for AIDS patients at St. Joseph's Cathedral. In November 1989, during a special election for the State Senate in a San Diego- based district, Maher received national attention after prohibiting State Assemblywoman Lucy Killea, a Catholic Democrat, from receiving communion because of her support for abortion. According to Maher, her position placed her in \\"complete contradiction to the moral teachings of the Catholic Church.\\" Killea, who refused to change her position, was the first political candidate to receive this censure. She eventually won the election, acknowledging (along with her opponent) that Maher's action helped her win by creating voter sympathy and publicizing her candidacy. Later life and death Maher resigned as Bishop of San Diego on July 10, 1990, after governing the diocese for 21 years and reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. That same year, he underwent two operations for a malignant brain tumor. He later died at his residence in Mission Hills, San Diego, at age 75.

He is currently a Boeing 767 captain flying international routes for Delta Air Lines. Flerlage is a member of the Air Line Pilots Association, International, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Chamber of Commerce. Early life, education and career Flerlage was born in Boston on January 29, 1958. His father, Stuart Q. Flerlage, Jr., was born in Cincinnati, OH. He moved to Cambridge, MA to attend Harvard College. He later attended Harvard Medical School and the Episcopal Divinity School. He practiced psychiatry for over 30 years in Brookline and Waltham, MA, until 1989 when he died.

The CD-MPR is one of two transmembrane proteins that bind mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) tags on acid hydrolase precursors in the Golgi apparatus that are destined for transport to the lysosome. Homologues of CD-MPR are found in all eukaryotes. Structure The CD-MPR is a type I transmembrane protein (that is, it has a single transmembrane domain with its C-termini on the cytoplasmic side of lipid membranes) with a relatively short cytoplasmic tail. The extracytoplasmic/lumenal M6P binding-domain consists of 157 amino acid residues. The CD-MPR is approximately 46 kDa in size and it both exists and functions as a dimer. The cell surface receptor for insulin-like growth factor 2 also functions as a cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. It consists of fifteen repeats homologous to the 157-residue CD-M6PR domain, two of which are responsible for binding to M6P. Function Both CD-MPRs and CI- MPRs are lectins that bind their M6P-tagged cargo in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. The CD-MPR shows greatly enhanced binding to M6P in the presence of divalent cations, such as manganese. The MPRs (bound to their cargo) are recognized by the GGA family of clathrin adaptor proteins and accumulate in forming clathrin-coated vesicles. They are trafficked to the early endosome where, in the relatively low pH environment of the endosome, the MPRs release their cargo. The MPRs are recycled back to the Golgi, again by way of interaction with GGAs and vesicles. The cargo proteins are then trafficked to the lysosome via the late endosome independently of the MPRs.

Career and contributions Selvamurthy Joined Amity in 2013 as President (Honorary) for Amity Science, Technology and Innovation foundation before that W. Selvamurthy rendered his services in DRDO in 1973 and during the 40 years of service in DRDO he has had a meritorious career and became Director of two DRDO institutes i.e. Defence Institute of Physiology & Allied Sciences (DIPAS) and Defence Institute of Psychological Research (DIPR)Defence Institute of Psychological Research in 1992 and held this position for over 10 years. He has personally made significant research contributions for the benefit of the soldiers in the fields related to: * Physiological acclimatisation at high altitude * Application of yoga for the Armed forces * Discovered a drug to save war casualties subjected to severe hemorrhage * Psychological stress and its management * Life support systems for soldiers in extreme operational environments Professional accomplishments * Research and development contributions of Selvamurthy in biomedical sciences have led to development of various technologies which have eventually culminated in enhancing the fighting efficiency of the armed forces in the extreme conditions like High Altitude, Under Water, Desert and Aerospace, Low Intensity Conflict and also Nuclear Biological and Chemical environment. Besides spearheading the 10 life sciences laboratories of DRDO gave as HR chief, he newer dimensions to the Human Resource Developmental activities of DRDO for better human resource management and the future HR challenge in the light of market driven economy. He has given a new direction to International Cooperation in DRDO. * He has successfully developed various life support technologies for enhancing the fighting efficiency of armed forces in the extreme conditions of high altitude, underwater, desert and aerospace, low intensity conflict and also Nuclear Biological Chemical environment. * Formulated acclimatization schedules, tenure of posting, nutritional requirements, enhancement of human performance through Yoga and composite Indian herbal preparation for troops at high altitude which are in vogue today. * Evaluated Physiological effects of Yogic practice through well-controlled studies on young and middle-aged soldiers both at plains and high altitudes. Beneficial effects of Yoga has been demonstrated and accepted and Yoga has been introduced by Army and Navy. * Developed new therapeutic modalities for treatment of High Altitude Pulmonary Odema (HAPO) using nitric oxide (15ppm) and oxygen (50%), and frostbite using Aloe vera cream thereby significantly reducing the mortality and morbidity of troops deployed at high altitude. More than 100 lives of the troops who succumb to HAPO in extreme high altitude areas have been saved. * Demonstrated the therapeutic potential of Aloe Vera for the treatment of frostbite. This therapeutic modality has significantly reduced the incidence of frostbite in the Northern part of Siachin glaciers. Technology transfer for commercial production of Aloe Vera to Pharmaceutical industry has been done. * Developed world class Computerized Pilot Aptitude Battery test (PABT) for selection of Pilots. This is commissioned in the Indian Air Force. * Military Psychology is another area where he has made seminal research contributions. These areas include personality assessment during the recruitment of armed forces personnel, man-machine interface, psychological responses of men in extreme environments, and motivation. He presented his study on alienation of local population in J&K; to the Government and most of the recommendations were accepted for implementation. Studies on increase in incidences of suicide and fratricide among troops have objectively been evaluated under his leadership; the recommendations are being implemented by armed forces for better management of the problem. This work has been applauded not only by Armed forces but also by other paramilitary and police forces of the country. * A new Thermo-electric cooling suit has been developed with the help of M/s MECON, Ranchi, which can remove about 250 w of heat and thereby enhancing performance of people working in heat (Encl 5). This Unit is being integrated in the Main Battle Tank (MBT) in improving the performance of tank crew. * Identified specific ergogenic fluids for effective rehydration to sustain optimal performance in desert. * Developed new prophylactic method using Carbogen (5% CO2 and 95% O2) for protection against noise induced hearing loss among crews in ships and tanks. The navy has accepted it for induction in engine rooms of ships. Most of the recommendations based on his study have been implemented and practiced by the Armed Forces. * Studied psychophysiology of stress and its management and various aspects of Military Psychology including incidences of suicides and fratricide among troops. Recommendations are being implemented by the Armed forces. Police and other paramilitary forces. * The R&D; contributions spearheaded by Selvamurthy have not only benefited the three wings of the Armed Forces but also have provided immense spin-off benefits to the Society at large. An antigen based Typhoid detection kit, 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose as radiosensitizer for cancer therapy, Diagnobact for infection imaging, attracticide for mosquito control and Leh-Berry Juice as antioxidant illustrate some of the critical spin-offs. * As Chief Controller R&D; (Life Sciences) spearheaded and facilitated development of pharmaceutical products like 2-DG for cancer therapy, Diagnobact for Infection imaging, Attracticide for mosquito control, Typhigen kit for typhoid diagnosis, Food technologies for meals ready to eat, horticultural development at high altitude etc. * As Chairman, Society for Biomedical Technology, successfully supervised development of various spin-off technologies for benefits of the society like critical care ventilator, titanium dental implants and FRO for Polio patients etc. * As Chairman of Human Engineering Panel of Aeronautical Research and Development Board have provided valuable input for LCA programme particularly to the human factors aspects of the programme. * As Chairman of Programme Management Board of Society for Bio-medical Technology, have facilitated indigenous development of some useful bio-medical products including critical care ventilator, titanium dental implant, Light Weight foldable Stretcher, FRO for polio patient and orbit implant. * Taken newer initiatives in talent management of DRDO to reduce manpower turnover. * One of among 13 experts selected at the global level by World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), a UNO body (1983‚Äì85) to formulate policies related to Climate and Human Health. Was leader of First Indo-Soviet Expedition to Arctic for understanding the human acclimatization in the polar environment of the tropical people. Served as Representative of International Society of Biometeorology in World Health Organisation (South East Asian Region) (1990‚Äì95). * Represented India in organization of prevention of chemical weapons conference of state parties held at the Hague in 2006. * In the field of Disaster Management, Selvamurthy's R&D; contributions have served the victims affected by earthquake, cyclone, tsunami and floods, as well as for NBC eventualities. * Provided new impetus for technology developments in critical NBC defence technologies, which have been already delivered, to the Armed Forces in large quantity. A compendium on NBC defence technologies and products developed by DRDO under his initiative has been published which is a useful document to source for the procurement of such equipments and devices. The Para-Military forces and civilian sectors are also considering the introduction of the relevant items developed by DRDO in this field under his leadership. * Formulated SOP for handling any eventuality of NBC attack on the nation. MHA has appreciated the valuable inputs from DRDO in its endeavors of SOP formulation and its implementation. Played a pivotal role in formulating SOP for DRDO in crisis management. Represented India in the conference of State Parties at the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) at The Hague (Netherlands). * PMO through MHA constituted an Inter Ministerial Expert Group under the Chairmanship of W. Selvamurthy to give inputs to MHA in the field of bio defence and in formulation of national approach for bio- defence. The Report has recently been submitted to MHA. In 2007 organized a national workshop on bio-defence, which will lead to the formulation of a major R&D; programme in this field as a national initiative. Led a team of DRDO scientists and doctors during the natural disasters such as earthquake at Latur and Bhuj, super cyclone in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. The team has effectively used DRDO technologies such as SATCOM terminals for maintaining the communication for relief operations, the water potability detection kit, water purification system for providing potable water, the meals ready-to-eat for meeting food requirement, DRDO developed diagnostic kits for infectious diseases and doctors with essential medicines to provide health care to the victims. The defence psychologists of DRDO have also helped in the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) management of the affected individuals.

He studied chemistry at Hokkaido University (Hokudai) and after receiving his PhD while he worked there as assistant professor. He initially wanted to major in mathematics, his favorite subject in childhood was arithmetic.„ÄéÊúùÊó•Â∞èÂ≠¶ÁîüÊñ∞ËÅû„Äè2010Âπ¥10Êúà8Êó• It was an encounter with two books became an opportunity to advance to the path of organic synthesis, one is Textbook of Organic Chemistry written by Louis Fieser of Harvard University, and another is Hydroboration written by Herbert C. Brown of Purdue University. Career From 1963 until 1965, Suzuki worked as a postdoctoral student with Herbert C. Brown at Purdue University and after returning to the Hokudai he became a full professor there. The postdoctoral experience was utilized in the study of the coupling reaction with his assistant Norio Miyaura and led to the discovery of Suzuki reaction announced in 1979. Its organic boronic acids with aryl and vinyl group are stable to water and air, easy to handle, and because the conditions required for use are also relatively mild, even among the several cross-coupling techniques, it is said to be easy to use. ‰∏ñÁïå„ÅÆÂåñÂ≠¶ËÄÖ„Éá„Éº„Çø„Éô„Éº„Çπ„ÄåÈà¥Êú®Á´†„Äç Its full mechanism is shown in the image below.

In addition, he was an invited professor at Purdue University (2001), Academic Sinica and the National Taiwan University (2002). In 2010, Suzuki was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry together with Richard F. Heck and Ei-ichi Negishi.

Painted in 1882, it currently hangs in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. Background The painting was inspired by a five-month trip Sargent made through Spain and North Africa in 1879, which also yielded a smaller oil painting, The Spanish Dance (Hispanic Society of America).The Spanish Dance, Hispanic Society of America Chronologically and thematically, the painting is related to a series of works Sargent painted during a subsequent stay in Venice; these, too, include dramatic light effects, exotic models, and restrained coloring.Kilmurray, Ormond, p. 26 Impressed by the costumes and theatrical manner of Gypsy dance, the artist returned to Paris and began work on a large canvas whose scale suggested a performing stage.Chong, et al, p. 159 The name El Jaleo refers to both the broad meaning of jaleo, a ruckus, as well as the specific dance known as jaleo de jerez.Prettejohn, p. 18 Spanish Dancer, 1879-1882. A preparatory oil study for the main figure in El Jaleo. Private collection. Sargent planned the composition of El Jaleo for at least a year. The painting was preceded by a series of preliminary studies, focusing particularly on the dancer's stylized posture. The result of thorough preparation, El Jaleo is characterized by an assured and rapid handling, and may have been completed in no more than a few days. Description Sargent's painting Capri (1878) depicts Rosina Ferrara dancing the tarantella, and anticipates the flamenco of El Jaleo.Kilmurray, Ormond, p.68 Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Almost wide, El Jaleo is broadly painted in a nearly monochromatic palette, but for spots of red at the right and an orange at left, which is reminiscent of the lemons √âdouard Manet inserted into several of his large paintings.Prettejohn, p. 17 At odds with the academic practice of carefully modulated tones, Sargent dramatized the contrast between rich blacks and the shining white skirt of the dancer, caught in the strong footlights and painted briskly so as to suggest movement.Prettejohn, p. 17-18 The lighting also creates long and eerie shadows on the rear wall that comprises nearly half the painting. The female dancer, leaning asymmetrically, is placed to imply forward motion, from left to right across the canvas. She is wearing a large, embroidered shawl wrapped around her shoulders, illustrating common flamenco costuming. The dancer's pose, with the outstretched left arm, is a depiction of standard flamenco dance technique and style. El Jaleo is the most theatrical of Sargent's early major works.Kilmurray, Ormond, p. 25 The lack of a barrier between the viewer and dancer helps create the illusion that we are present at the actual event; the manipulation of space and lighting communicates the energetic rhythms of the dance, its sound and movement. El Jaleo is an example of Hispanism, the phenomenon of widespread fascination with Spanish culture throughout Europe and America in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The painting has been called both an example of John Singer Sargent's Impressionism and also his early affinity with the Realist movement.Fairbrother, Trevor. John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist. 1st ed. p. 102.: Yale UP, 2000. Print. Provenance Sargent exhibited El Jaleo at the 1882 Paris Salon, where the painting was purchased by a Boston patron, Thomas Jefferson Coolidge. It was the last subject picture that Sargent exhibited at the Salon, and his greatest success there. In 1888 the painting was publicly exhibited in Boston, at which time museum patron Isabella Stewart Gardner, the heiress wife of a Coolidge cousin, expressed her interest in it. In 1914 she borrowed El Jaleo to exhibit in her museum, and constructed the Spanish Cloister gallery especially for El Jaleo, which is framed by a Moorish archChong, et al, p. 151 and reflected the painting in a large mirror running perpendicular to its left edge. Coolidge then gave the painting to Gardner, and Sargent presented her with an album of pencil drawings he had made as preparatory sketches for the work. El Jaleo was on exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. for a short time in 1992, on loan from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum for the first time since 1914. At that time, the painting had been recently cleaned and restored by Alain Goldrach. Critical reception After the initial exhibition of El Jaleo in 1882 at the French Salon, John Singer Sargent became, as one writer put it, \\"the most talked-about painter in Paris.\\"\\"The Salon. From an Englishman's Point of View.\\" Art Journal (London) 44. no. 7 (July 1882): 218Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 68: YALE UP, 1997. Print. Some critics in 1882 said that the painting caused Sargent to join the ranks of the French Impressionists.Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 51: YALE UP, 1997. Print. A critic for the Le Figaro called the painting \\"one of the most original and strongest works of the present Salon.\\"Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 53: YALE UP, 1997. Print. Some writers hailed the painting as clever, while others dismissed it as a vagary of the artist.Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 58-59: YALE UP, 1997. Print. Today El Jaleo is considered to be one of John Singer Sargent's most memorable works.

Plot synopsis While the Guardians of the Galaxy watch over the newly resurrectedGuardians of the Galaxy vol 2 #24 (April 2010) and imprisoned Thanos and Nova pursues the false Quasar, the Magus and the Universal Church of Truth tear open the Fault (opened at the end of the War of KingsWar of Kings #6 and previously sealed by Adam Warlock).Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 #18The Thanos Imperative: Ignition (July 2010) Monstrous creatures emerge from the Fault and are confronted by the Kree and Shi'ar armadas, Galactus, the Celestials, and other cosmic beings. Among the invaders is their leader, Lord Mar-Vell, who is an alternate version of Captain Marvel. Mar-Vell kills the Magus for failing to locate Thanos.The Thanos Imperative #1-3 (Aug ‚Äì Oct 2010) Mar-Vell, himself, is the de facto leader of the extradimensional Cancerverse‚Äîa metaphysically unbalanced dimension where Death itself has been completely banished and Life runs rampant, like a cancer‚Äîand seeks to spread his dimension's plague of \\"undeath\\" to all other universes. Mar-Vell is the avatar of Life, and Thanos is the avatar of Death. Because of this, the battle will only be over when one of them destroys the other. While Star-Lord leads the Guardians and Thanos into the Fault hoping to locate Lord Mar-Vell, Lord Mar-Vell scours the Marvel Universe for Thanos. Nova leads Quasar, Beta Ray Bill, Gladiator, the Silver Surfer and Ronan the Accuser in an attack on Mar- Vell, but loses badly. When Thanos kills Drax The Destroyer, his death as the avatar of life alerts Mar-Vell to his presence and he returns to the Cancerverse.The Thanos Imperative #3-4 (Oct, Nov 2010) When Mar-Vell confronts Thanos and the Guardians, everyone is surprised when Thanos immediately surrenders.The Thanos Imperative #5 (Dec 2010) As he willingly prepares to be sacrificed by Mar-Vell, he muses about how the Captain Marvel he knew never considered the consequences of his actions, either. Mar-Vell realizes he has been tricked just as Death, summoned by Thanos's death, arrives to claim him. This causes a chain reaction that kills Mar-Vell's followers and triggers the collapse of the alternate universe and the Fault. Thanos, expecting Death to embrace him for his actions, becomes enraged when she once again spurns him. Teleporting the rest of their comrades to safety, Star Lord and Nova remain behind to contain Thanos, who blames the heroes for Death's manipulation of him and vows to make the entire universe suffer, by keeping him within the Cancerverse until its imminent destruction.The Thanos Imperative #6 (Jan 2011) A memorial service is held for those lost in the conflicts. Quasar informs Rocket Raccoon that, without Nova, Worldmind has shut down and the Nova Force disappeared. Still reeling from the struggle, the Kree Empire on Hala is assailed by the forces of Blastaar in a bid for easy conquest. During the battle, Ronan is aided by the other surviving members of Nova's strike force. Under Cosmo's guidance, they set up base in Knowhere. The newly christened \\"Annihilators\\" are proposing they be a loose-knit force to be implemented only as the \\"last resort.\\" Abruptly, Ikon of the Spaceknights materializes in their midst, proclaiming urgency in her errand and asking where to find \\"this team [she is] supposed to lead\\".The Thanos Imperative: Devastation (Feb 2011) Collected editions The series has been solicited for release in a collected edition individual volume: * The Thanos Imperative (collects The Thanos Imperative 1‚Äì6, The Thanos Imperative: Ignition, The Thanos Imperative: Devastation, and the Thanos Sourcebook, 208 pages, hardcover, February 2011, softcover, September 2011, ) ReferencesExternal links  * * Category:Comics by Andy Lanning Category:Comics by Dan Abnett Category:Space opera comics ","title":"The Thanos Imperative"},{"id":"26635970","text":"Karim Adel Abdel Fatah () is an Egyptian footballer.

From 1919 until 1929, Vasilishki (Wasiliszki) was part of Lida County and from 1929 until 1939 of Szczuczyn County of the Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic. Before World War II, more than 80% of the 2,500 inhabitants of the town were Jews. In September 1939, Vasilishki was occupied by the Red Army and, on 14 November 1939, incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. Vasilishki was occupied by Nazi Germany from June 1941 until 12 July 1944 and administered as a part of Generalbezirk Wei√üruthenien of Reichskommissariat Ostland. In December 1941, a ghetto was established where Jews from the neighboring villages of Zaboloc and Sobakintse were also kept imprisoned. Jews were forced to perform hard labor. On May 10, 1942, the Germans, assisted by the Lithuanian police, made a selection of the Jews in the central square. Between 1,800 and 2,200 Jews were shot in the Jewish cemetery over the course of 2 days, where pits had been dug in advance. The rest of the Jews, around 200 people, were transferred to different ghettos, among them the Lida ghetto.

The Center for National Response is a two-lane vehicular tunnel opened November 8, 1954 as part of the West Virginia Turnpike. Originally known as Memorial Tunnel, the tunnel formerly carried West Virginia Turnpike through/under Paint Creek Mountain in Standard, West Virginia in Kanawha County. Its construction required the movement of of earth, and was the first tunnel in the nation to have closed-circuit television monitoring. at a final cost of $5 million. The facility is administered by the West Virginia National Guard. During the 1980s, an upgrade of the Turnpike included a 1.72 miles (2.77 km) extension that was constructed to serve as a bypass for both the tunnel and the adjacent Stanley Bender Bridge across Paint Creek. [2] Costing $35 million to complete, 10,000,000 cubic yards (7,600,000 m3) of earth were removed in addition to 300,000 tons of coal being removed from the mountain.[2] The final vehicle would pass through the tunnel on July 7, 1987, and it would subsequently close for use for pass through, vehicular traffic.[3] Closed to interstate traffic since 1987, since being bypassed, the tunnel has become an unusual testing and training facility. The former Turnpike tunnel was first used by state agencies and later converted to serve as a location for first responders local fire and rescue departments, law enforcement organizations, and various federal agencies including military to train for various situations that may arise in such a location without alarming the general public. Between 1992 and 1995, the Department of Transportation entered a deal with the state to utilize the abandoned tunnel for smoke, fire and ventilation experiments. These experiments were carried out to design better developed ventilation systems for the tunnels being constructed as part of the Big Dig in Boston (the results of the tests were also incorporated into the design of the Channel Tunnel). These experiments also resulted in the Federal Highway Administration allowing jet fans for ventilation in tunnel construction, which was a significant change to their original ventilation designs. The lasting legacy of the Memorial Tunnel Fire Test Program is in both changes in ceilings materials used in tunnel construction as well in the approved use of jet fans for ventilation during construction. right By 2000, the tunnel had been selected as the location where the Center for National Response would conduct anti-terrorism training exercises. The current facilities offered in the center include: * A rubble area to simulate collapsed buildings * An emergency egress trainer * A subway station, complete with of track and two subway cars from Boston's Green Line * A drug enforcement section * A highway tunnel section, complete with a New York City Transit Authority bus, firetrucks, a tractor-trailer and other vehicles The tunnel's bypass is not unlike the Pennsylvania Turnpike bypassing the Laurel Hill Tunnel in 1964, followed by the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels in 1968.

Glendenning. Both individuals were born into non-Mormon or inactive Mormon families, but both confided in their parents while young boys that they had begun to hear 'heavenly' music or voices while wide awake. Partly because such claims were similar to those of Mormonism's founder Joseph Smith, Jr., both individuals later became associated with Mormonism in their adult years. For example, a news brief in the July 6, 1944 edition of the Hayward Review newspaper reported \\"A painting by Archie Inger will be presented by him to the Hayward ward of the Latter Day Saints church during a special program to be held at the Masonic hall on Sunday evening at 7 pm, Bishop W.T. Webb has announced...\\" While Inger produced a number of writings and paintings in his career, he is best known as author of Revealed Translation of John's Revelation Given by the Lord Jesus Christ to Archie J. Inger, published in Oakland, California in 1908 when he was 25 years old, which claims to be an explanation of The Apocalypse of John provided by Christ himself. The book in its entirety was intentionally not restrictively copyrighted, and online and published editions have gradually become widely available. Google Books and other websites offer full downloadable texts of the Translation of John's Revelation as well as a smaller companion text entitled Historical Fulfillment of John's Revelation. A lengthy description of Inger is in the 1912 book The Strenuous Life Spiritual and The Submissive Life.The Strenuous Life Spiritual and The Submissive Life Author Albert Van der Naillen of the California Academy of Sciences wrote: ::\\"Rev. Mr. Castro was one of the first and most deeply interested in Mr. Inger, and made a careful study of the young man's life and works. Later, the Rev. Mr. Castro was one of a formal committee of clergymen and teachers who examined Inger for days, and pronounced his work not only sincere, but wonderful...The San Francisco Examiner prints the following: Archie J. Inger, a boy in years, but a man in ordinary intellect, a youth of humble origin, has produced an interpretation of the revelation of the New Testament book of St. John that is astounding to doctors of divinity and trained theologians. This amazing document running upwards of 100,000 words, is strikingly phrased and bears the stamp of thought far beyond the normal action of this youthful mind...\\" The March 13, 1910 edition of the Los Angeles Times published a report about Inger headlined \\"BOY PROPHET IS ODD STUDY. Says Divine Revelations Are Made Through Him; Declares Christ Is Here, But Is Not Recognized; Predicts Great European War Over Ottoman Empire.\\" On March 13, 2010, the Times republished the entire article online. The Wednesday November 3, 1909 edition of the Los Angeles Herald contained this mention of Archie Inger: :\\"Young Man Who Claims to Be Spiritually Guided Will Lecture at Blanchard Hall\\" :Archie J. Inger, a young man 26 years old, who claims to be the prophet of God, will speak at Blanchard hall Saturday night on the coming of the Fifth Universal Empire and the Prophecies of Daniel. :Inger's case is interesting in that he attracted widespread attention six years ago in Oakland, when he claimed he heard voices directing him to \\"come over to Jesus Christ\\" and later wrote a 300-page book entitled, 'Revealed Translation of John's Revelation' having at the time practically little education and no understanding of the scriptures. He was interviewed by a score of clergymen and professional men, who confessed themselves puzzled at his seeming understanding and mysterious force. :Inger had worked at various trades before receiving the \\"command,\\" and had received but little education to fit him for his work. He has a mother and two brothers living in Oakland. The young man charges no admission to his lectures and claims to be backed by prominent men in the north, who pay his expenses. It is said he is gradually building up a following, although he disclaims any intention of forming a sect. :Inger says the spirit voice is with him at his talks to the people and that before he goes on the platform to speak he has not the slightest idea of what he is going to say excepting that he is going to speak on a stated subject. \\"the words flow from me,\\" he says, \\"with no effort on my part. It is Christ speaking through me.\\" :Inger, although 26 years old, scarcely looks 20. He is of slight build, with an almost spiritual face and appears sincere in his convictions. On Tuesday November 9, 1909, the same Los Angeles Herald reported on page 5: :\\"Archie J. Inger, a prophet of god, will speak at Symphony hall Tuesday evening. An admission of twenty-five cents will be charged to defray expenses.\\" In the twelfth chapter of Inger's Revealed Translation..., there is a sudden overt mention of another Christian spiritualist, Levi McKeen Arnold, a businessman in Poughkeepsie, New York who claimed to begin receiving revelations from Jesus Christ on April 5, 1851. This paragraph in Inger's work endorses the History of Origin of All Things as being a credible body of revelation similar to his own work: ::\\"...But what has transpired beforehand which pertains to the prophesy of John's revelation of the woman and the child? My prophet (Archie J. Inger) wishes to write it because it has been made known to him, but I have caused him to erase it in consequence of his own wish, as he should have had no wish in the matter. Therefore I will not write through his wish; but will refer you to the book entitled: History of The Origin of All Things\\" which was written by Me, the Lord Jesus Christ, through an humble medium, even as this is written through an humble medium, even as this is written through this medium, and therefore bears witness through this book to the absolute truth through this medium, and therefore bears witness through this book to the absolute truth of \\"The History of The Origin of All Things,\\" even as I bear witness in that book to this one, and to this Prophet, were it able to be seen, which it is to those who earnestly seek after righteousness unabashed by prejudice and superstition.

On 14‚Äì15 July, rigged, extraordinary, single-party parliamentary elections were held, in which voters were presented with a single list of pro-Communist candidates.

In response, the Estonian SSR was formally incorporated into the Soviet Union on 9 August 1940, and nominally became the 16th constituent republic of the USSR. (On 16 July 1956, the Karelo-Finnish SSR was demoted to the Karelian ASSR; from then on until 1991, the Estonian SSR was considered the 15th constituent republic.)  Soviet occupation of Estonia  Soviet- organized rally in Tallinn, 1940 Karl S√§re with other Estonian Communist Party officials in Tallinn, July 1940 On July 23, 1940, the Estonian SSR nationalized all land, banks and major industrial enterprises in Estonia. Peasants were allotted small plots of land during the land reforms. Small businesses were also later nationalized. The occupation brought colonisation with it.The White Book: Losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes, pp. 143‚Äì144. According to some Western scholars, relations between the Soviet Union and Estonian SSR were those of internal colonialism.Mettam, Collin W. and Stephen Wyn Williams (2001).

All banks and accounts were essentially nationalized; a lot of industrial machinery was disassembled and relocated to other Soviet territories.Valge raamat, page 129; The White Book: Losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes, p. 145 Before retreating in 1941, Red Army, following the scorched earth policies, burnt most industrial constructions, destroying power plants, vehicles and cattle.

The Estonian Soviet Republic was proclaimed in Narva on 29 November 1918 but fell to counter-revolutionaries and the White Armies in 1919. In June 1940 Soviet power was restored in Estonia as workers overthrew the fascist dictatorship in the country.

The poster says: \\"The spirit of the great Lenin and his victorious banner encourage us now to the Patriotic War.\\" According to Soviet sources, pressure from the working people of Estonia forced its government to accept the 1939 proposal for a mutual assistance treaty by the Soviet Union. On 28 September 1939 the Pact of Mutual Assistance was signed 1939 USSR-Estonia Mutual Aid Pact (full text) which allowed the USSR to station a limited number of Soviet Army units in Estonia. Economic difficulties, dissatisfaction with the Estonian government's policies \\"sabotaging fulfillment of the Pact and the Estonian government\\", and political orientation towards Nazi Germany lead to a revolutionary situation in June 1940. A note from the Soviet government to the Estonian Government suggested that they stuck strictly to the Pact of Mutual Assistance. To guarantee the fulfillment of the Pact, additional military units entered Estonia, welcomed by the Estonian workers who demanded the resignation of the Estonian government. On 21 June under the leadership of the Estonian Communist Party political demonstrations by workers were held in Tallinn, Tartu, Narva and other cities. On the same day the fascist government was overthrown, and the People's government led by Johannes Vares was formed. On 14‚Äì15 July 1940 elections for the Estonian Parliament, the State Assembly (Riigikogu) were held.

The request was approved by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 6 August 1940. On 23 July the State Assembly proclaimed all land to be people's property while banks and heavy industry were nationalised. On 25 August the State Assembly adopted the Constitution of the Estonian SSR, renamed itself the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR and approved the Council of People's Commissars of the Estonian SSR.  Hitler era: Nazi occupation 1941‚Äì1944  After Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the Wehrmacht reached Estonia in July 1941. The Germans were perceived as liberators from the USSR and Communism in general. Thousands of Estonian men fought directly alongside the German army throughout the war.Thomas, Nigel (2012). Germany's Eastern Front Allies (2): Baltic Forces. Osprey Publishing. p. 15. An anti-communist guerrilla group called the Forest Brothers also assisted the Wehrmacht.Buttar, Prit (2013). Between Giants, the Battle for the Baltics in World War II. Osprey Publishing. . Estonia was incorporated into the German province of Ostland.  Stalin era continues  The Soviet Union retook Estonia in 1944, thereafter occupying it for nearly another half century. This began when the Red Army re-occupied Estonian Ingria, Narva, and eastern Vaivara Parish in the Battle of Narva, Southeast Estonia in the Tartu Offensive and the rest of the country in the Baltic Offensive. Faced with the country being re-occupied by the Soviet Army, 80,000 people fled from Estonia by sea to Finland and Sweden in 1944. 25,000 Estonians reached Sweden and a further 42,000 Germany. During the war about 8,000 Estonian Swedes and their family members had emigrated to Sweden. After the retreat of the Germans, about 30,000 partisans remained in hiding in the Estonian forests, waging a guerrilla war until the early 1950s. After re- occupation, the Soviet nationalization policy of 1940 was reimposed, as well as the collectivization of farms. Over 900,000 hectares were expropriated in the few years following reoccupation, while much of that land was given to new settlers from Russia or other locations in the Soviet Union. Rapid collectivization began in 1946, followed in 1947 by a crackdown against kulak farmers. The kulak repression started as oppressive taxation, but eventually led to mass deportations. Those who resisted collectivization were killed or deported. More than 95% of farms were collectivized by 1951. The 1949 mass deportation of about 21,000 people broke the back of the partisan movement. 6,600 partisans gave themselves up in November 1949. Later on, the failure of the Hungarian uprising broke the morale of 700 men still remaining under cover. According to Soviet data, up until 1953 20,351 partisans were defeated. Of these, 1,510 perished in the battles. During that period, 1,728 members of the Red Army, NKVD and the Estonian Police were killed by the \\"forest brothers\\". August Sabbe, the last surviving \\"brother\\" in Estonia, committed suicide when the KGB tracked him down and attempted to arrest him in 1978. He drowned in a lake, when the KGB agent, disguised as a fisherman, was after him.Laar, Mart. War in the Woods: Estonia's Struggle for Survival, 1944‚Äì1956. Republic of Estonia 90 Estonian Institute 2008 Soviet prison doors on display in the Museum of Occupations, Tallinn, Estonia During the first post-war decade of Soviet rule, Estonia was governed by Moscow via Russian-born ethnic Estonian functionaries. Born into the families of native Estonians in Russia, the latter had obtained their education in the Soviet Union during the Stalin era. Many of them had fought in the Red Army (in the Estonian Rifle Corps), few of them had mastered the Estonian language.Biographical Research in Eastern Europe: Altered Lives and Broken Biographies. Humphrey, Miller, Zdravomyslova For the latter reason they were known under a derogatory term \\"Yestonians\\", alluding to their Russian accent. Although the United States and the United Kingdom, the allies of the USSR against Nazi Germany during World War II, recognized the occupation of the Republic of Estonia by USSR at Yalta Conference in 1945 de facto, the governments of the rest of the western democracies did not recognize it de jure according to the Sumner Welles' declaration of July 23, 1940The Baltic States and their Region: New Europe or Old? by David J. Smith on Page 48 Post-Cold War Identity Politics: Northern and Baltic Experiences by Marko Lehti on Page 272: Soviet occupation in Baltic countries ‚Äì a position supported by the fact that an overwhelming majority of states never recognized the 1940 incorporation de jure. Some of these countries recognized Estonian diplomats who still functioned in many countries in the name of their former governments. These consuls persisted in this anomalous situation until the ultimate restoration of Estonia's independence in 1991. A special care was taken to change the ethnic structure of population, Estonian Museum of Occupations: Majandus: Teise maailmas√µja ja N√µukogude okupatsiooni aastad (1940‚Äì1991) especially in Ida-Viru County. For example, a policy of prioritising immigrants before returning war refugees in assigning dwelling quarters was adopted.\\"Narvskij rabochij\\" April 25, 1950, quoted in Valge raamat, page 132 and The White Book: Losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes, pp. 149‚Äì150. = Destruction of graveyards and war memorials = Estonian graveyards and monuments from the period of 1918‚Äì1944 were dismantled. Among others, in the Tallinn Military Cemetery the majority of gravestones from 1918 to 1944 were destroyed by the Soviet authorities. This graveyard was then re-used by the Red Army after World War II.Linda Soomre Memorial Plaque at britishembassy.gov.uk Other cemeteries destroyed by the authorities during the Soviet era in Estonia include Baltic German cemeteries, Kopli cemetery (established in 1774), M√µigu cemetery and the oldest cemetery in Tallinn, the Kalamaja cemetery (from the 16th century). After the re-occupation of Estonia in 1944, the dismantling of monuments from the Republic of Estonia, which had survived or had been restored during the German occupation, continued. On April 15, 1945, in P√§rnu, a monument by Amandus Adamson, erected to 87 persons who had fallen in the Estonian War of Independence, was demolished. The dismantling of war memorials continued for several years and occurred across all districts of the country. A comprehensive file concerning the monuments of the Estonian War of Independence, compiled by the Military Department of the EC(b)P Central Committee in April 1945, has been preserved in the Estonian State Archives. Monuments are listed by counties in this file and it specifies the amount of explosive and an evaluation concerning the transportation that were needed.

After Joseph Stalin's death, Party membership vastly expanded its social base to include more ethnic Estonians. By the mid-1960s, the percentage of ethnic Estonian membership stabilized near 50%. Another positive aspect of the post-Stalin era in Estonia was the regranting of permission in the late 1950s for citizens to make contact with foreign countries. Ties were reactivated with Finland, and in the 1965, a ferry connection operating SS Tallinn was opened from Tallinn to Helsinki. President of Finland Urho Kekkonen had visited Tallinn in the previous year and the ferry line is widely credited to Kekkonen. Some Estonians began watching Finnish television as the Helsinki television tower broadcast from just 50 miles (80 km) and the signal was strong enough in Tallinn and elsewhere on the North coast. This electronic \\"window on the West\\" afforded Estonians more information on current affairs and more access to Western culture and thought than any other group in the Soviet Union. This heightened media environment was important in preparing Estonians for their vanguard role in extending perestroika during the Gorbachev era.  Late 20th century  In the late 1970s, Estonian society grew increasingly concerned about the threat of cultural Russification to the Estonian language and national identity. In 1980, Tallinn hosted the sailing events of the 1980 Summer Olympics. By 1981, Russian was taught in the first grade of Estonian- language schools and was also introduced into Estonian pre-school teaching. Soviet authorities began to lure in Finnish tourists and the much needed foreign exchange they could bring. The Soviet travel agency Inturist contracted Finnish construction company Repo to build Hotel Viru in downtown Tallinn. Estonians saw very different construction equipment, methods and work morale. An improved ferry MS Georg Ots between Tallinn and Helsinki came into operation. Estonia gained Western currency, but on the other hand Western thoughts and customs began to infiltrate Soviet Estonia. By the beginning of the Gorbachev era, concern over the cultural survival of the Estonian people had reached a critical point. The ECP remained stable in the early perestroika years but waned in the late 1980s. Other political movements, groupings and parties moved to fill the power vacuum. The first and most important was the Estonian Popular Front, established in April 1988 with its own platform, leadership and broad constituency. The Greens and the dissident-led Estonian National Independence Party soon followed. By 1989 the political spectrum had widened, and new parties were formed and re-formed almost daily. The republic's Supreme Soviet transformed into an authentic regional lawmaking body. This relatively conservative legislature passed an early declaration of sovereignty (November 16, 1988); a law on economic independence (May 1989) confirmed by the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet that November; a language law making Estonian the official language (January 1989); and local and republic election laws stipulating residency requirements for voting and candidacy (August, November 1989). Although the majority of Estonia's large Russian-speaking diaspora of Soviet-era immigrants did not support full independence, they were divided in their goals for the republic. In March 1990 some 18% of Russian speakers supported the idea of a fully independent Estonia, up from 7% the previous autumn, and by early 1990 only a small minority of ethnic Estonians were opposed to full independence.  Restoration of the Republic  The first freely elected parliament during the Soviet era in Estonia had passed Estonian Sovereignty Declaration on November 16, 1988, independence resolutions on May 8, 1990, and renamed the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic the Republic of Estonia. On August 20, 1991 the Estonian parliament issued a Declaration of Independence from the Soviet Union. On September 6, 1991, Supreme Soviet of the USSR recognized the independence of Estonia,The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union: 1917‚Äì1991 (Sources in History) Richard Sakwa Page 248, immediately followed by the international recognitions of the Republic of Estonia. On February 23, 1989 the flag of the Estonian SSR was lowered on Pikk Hermann, and replaced with the blue-black-white flag of Estonia on February 24, 1989. In 1992, Heinrich Mark, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia in Exile,Heinrich Mark at president.ee presented his credentials to the newly elected President of Estonia Lennart Meri. The last Russian troops withdrew from Estonia in August 1994.Baltic Military District globalsecurity.org The Russian Federation officially ended its military presence in Estonia after it relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in Paldiski in September 1995. Estonia joined the European Union and NATO in 2004.  Geography = Territorial changes  Border changes of Estonia after World War II In the aftermath of the Estonian War of Independence, Estonia established control also over Ivangorod, in January 1919, a move which was recognized by Soviet Russia in the 1920 Treaty of Tartu. In January 1945, the Narva River was defined as the border between the Estonian SSR and Russian SFSR, and as a result administration of Ivangorod was transferred from Narva to the Leningrad Oblast which having grown in population received the official status of town in 1954. In 1945 the Petseri County was annexed and ceded to the Russian SFSR where it became one the districts of Pskov Oblast. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Estonia raised the question of a return to the borders under the Treaty of Tartu. Estonia dropped this claim in November 1995.A Political and Economic Dictionary of Eastern Europe, p. 443 Estonia and Russia signed and ratified the Estonian-Russian Border Treaty, and it went into effect May 18, 2005: the preamble noted that the international border had partly changed, in accordance with Article 122 of the Estonian Constitution. After the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991, there have been some disputes about the Estonian-Russian border in the Narva area, as the new constitution of Estonia (adopted in 1992) recognizes the 1920 Treaty of Tartu border to be currently legal. The Russian Federation, however, considers Estonia to be a successor of the Estonian SSR and recognizes the 1945 border between two former national republics. Officially, Estonia has no territorial claims in the area, which is also reflected in the new Estonian-Russian border treaty, according to which Ivangorod remains part of Russia. Although the treaty was signed in 2005 by the foreign ministers of Estonia and Russia, Russia took its signature back, after Estonian parliament added a reference to Tartu Peace Treaty in the preamble of the law ratifying the border treaty. A new treaty was signed by the foreign ministers in 2014.  Politics = Government  Johannes K√§bin, leader of the Communist Party of Estonia from 1950 to 1978 The legislative body of the Estonian SSR was the Supreme Soviet that represented the highest body of state power accordance with the Constitution. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was the permanent body of the Supreme Council. It consisted of a Chairman of the Presidium, two Vice-Chairmen, Secretary and 9 members. Was elected to the Presidium of the 25th for the first time August 1940th The Presidium of the law and the decisions adopted. Between sessions of the Supreme Council met in some of its functions: changes to the legislation of the Estonian SSR, Soviet ministries and state committees and to the abolition of the SSR Council of Ministers and the persons appointment and removal of the Supreme Council for approval by relevant laws.  Military  The Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic did not have armed forces of its own. Because of the strategic geographical location, Estonia was considered as a strategic zone for the Soviet Armed Forces. The territory was therefore heavily militarized and added to the Soviet Baltic Military District which included a strong presence of the Soviet Air Defence, Navy and also the Strategic Rocket Forces. The Baltic Military District included the following units: *Ground units: **144th Guards Motor Rifle Division, (Tallinn) **182nd Guard Motorized Rifle Regiment (Klooga) **188th Guard Motorized Rifle Regiment (Klooga) **254th Guard Motorized Rifle Regiment (Tallinn) **148th Independent Recon-Battalion (Klooga) **295th Independent Engineer-Battalion (Klooga) **228th Tank Regiment (Keila) **450th Artillery Regiment (Klooga) *Air units: **170th Naval Shturmovik Aviation Regiment (√Ñmari) **321st Naval Shturmovik Aviation Regiment (√Ñmari) **366th Interceptor Aviation Regiment (P√§rnu) **384th Interceptor Aircraft Regiment **(Tallinn) **425th Interceptor Aviation Regiment (Haapsalu) **655th Interceptor Aviation Regiment (P√§rnu) **656th Interceptor Aviation Regiment (Tapa) **66th Soviet Attack Air Regiment (Kunda) **192nd Military Transport Aviation Regiment (Tartu) **196th Military Transport Aviation Regiment (Tartu) **132nd Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment (Tartu) **2nd Air-Defence Army *Naval units: **Baltic Fleet (Tallinn-Paldiski) Military training was provided by the Tallinn Higher Military-Political Construction School.  Economy  In the Soviet system, all local proceeds were initially appropriated into the federal budget at Moscow, and some of them were then invested back in the local economies. The figures for those investments were made available to the public, thus promoting a positive impression of the Soviet Federal Centre's contributions to the periphery, the Baltic states included. Investment figures alone, however, do not represent actual income; rather, they resemble the spending side of the national budget.Izvestija, \\"–û–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã —Ä–∞—Å—á–µ—Ç—ã –°–°–°–† —Å –ø—Ä–∏–±–∞–ª—Ç–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ —Ä–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞–º–∏\\" 9 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2012, 14:56 In Estonian SSR by 1947, the private sector had entirely disappeared, accompanied by a rapid industrialization that occurred soon after Soviet reoccupation. Soviet planners expanded oil shale mining and processing in the late 1940s, taking over that industry in northeast section of Estonia. In the 1970s, the Soviet economy experienced stagnation, exacerbated by the growth of a shadow economy. National income per capita was higher in Estonia than elsewhere in the USSR (44% above the Soviet average in 1968), however, the income levels exceeded those of the USSR in independent Estonia as well.Measurement Before and After Colin Clark Australian Economic History Review; Angus Maddison. 2004, page 33 Official Estonian sources maintain that Soviet rule had significantly slowed Estonia's economic growth, resulting in a wide wealth gap in comparison with its neighboring countries (e.g., Finland, Sweden).Valge raamat, pages 125, 148 For example, Estonian economy and standard of living were similar to that in Finland prior to World War II.[ ESTONIA AND FINLAND ‚Äì A RETROSPECTIVE SOCIOECONOMIC COMPARISON.

Estonia's 1990 per capita GDP was $10,733 compared to $26,100 for Finland. Estonian sources estimate the economic damage directly attributable to the second Soviet occupation (from 1945 to 1991) to lie in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars.Valge raamat, page 20 Similarly, the damage to Estonian ecology were estimated at around US$4 billion.  Resources  On May 21, 1947, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) authorized collectivization of Estonian agriculture. Initially it was implemented with great difficulties in the Baltic republics but it was facilitated by mass deportations of dissident farmers, termed 'kulaks'. As a result, by the end of April 1949, half of the remaining individual farmers in Estonia had joined kolkhozes.Eesti n√µukogude ents√ºklopeedia (Estonian Soviet Encyclopedia). Tallinn: Valgus, 1972. P. 221. 99.3% of farms had been collectivised by 1957The White Book: Losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes, P. 155.  Industry and environment  A number of large-volume capital investments were undertaken by the Soviet central power to exploit resources on Estonian territory of Oil shale, lumber and, later, uranium ore, as part of the postwar reconstruction program.Valge raamat, page 130; The White Book: Losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes, pp. 146‚Äì147. The first Five Year Plan, called the fourth Five Year Plan, prescribed a total of 3.5 billion roubles of investments for enterprises in Estonia. One of the important goals in this reformation of Estonia's economy was providing economic support to Leningrad. To this end, 40% of the total capital investments of the fourth Five Year Plan to be spent in Estonia were intended for investments in oil shale mining infrastructure. Gas-rich oil shale was delivered to Leningrad via a specially built pipeline starting from 1948; gas from this very same source did not reach Tallinn until 1953. In 1961, 62.5% of the gas produced was still delivered to Leningrad. By the end of 1954, 227,000 apartments in Leningrad were supplied with gas using the output of Kohtla-J√§rve; only about three percent of that, or 6,041 apartments, had been supplied in Tallinn.Valge raamat, page 132; The White Book: Losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes, p. 149.  Demographics = Soviet deportations and repressions  Mass deportations of ethnic Estonians during the Soviet era together with migration into Estonia from other parts of the Soviet Union resulted in the proportion of ethnic Estonians in the country decreasing from 88% in 1934 to 62% in 1989.Background Note: Estonia AT U.S Department of State While the Baltic republics had the highest living standard in the Soviet Union and high rates of industrialisation, the ethnic Estonians in Estonian SSR (similarly to Latvians in Latvian SSR, but unlike Lithuanians in Lithuanian SSR) suffered a sharp decline of their proportion in the total population due to the large-scale immigration, mostly of Russians. While in 1934 the Estonians comprised 88 percent of the total population of Estonia, by 1959 and 1970 their number had decreased to 75 and 68 percent, respectively (and to 61.5% by 1989).The White Book: Losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes, P. 21. This decline in percentage was especially severe among the urban and young populations. Within 11 years between 1959 and 1970 the proportion of Estonians in Tallinn declined by as much as 4%, from 60% to 56% of the total population. Population growth throughout the existence of the Estonian SSR was mainly due to immigration from other regions of the Soviet Union.The White Book: Losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes, P. 21, 147, 150. Although the percentage of Estonians in the total population of the Estonian SSR declined due to Soviet migration policies, the total number of ethnic Estonians increased over the Soviet period as a whole. This was due to a positive natural growth rate of some 1 or 2 thousand per year. As an example, in 1970, the number of live births of Estonians was 14,429 and the number of deaths was 12,356, giving natural increase of 2,073 ethnic Estonians. In 1940‚Äì1941 and 1944‚Äì1951 during the Soviet deportations from Estonia tens of thousands of Estonian citizens were forcibly resettled to Siberia. During the first year of occupation, 1940‚Äì1941, alone, an estimated 43,900 lives were irrecoverably lost, not counting refugees.Valge raamat, page 42 The following three-year Nazi occupation brought with it a loss of 32,740 lives, again not counting refugees. Another 16,000 deaths were caused through Soviet repressions in the years following 1944. During the first year of Soviet occupation (1940‚Äì1941) over 8,000 people, including most of the country's leading politicians and military officers, were arrested. About 2,200 of the arrested were executed in Estonia, while most others were moved to prison camps in Russia, from where very few were later able to return. On July 19, 1940, the Commander-in-chief of the Estonian Army Johan Laidoner was captured by the NKVD and deported together with his wife to Penza, RSFSR. Laidoner died in the Vladimir Prison Camp, Russia on March 13, 1953.General Johan Laidoner at The Estonian War Museum The President of Estonia, Konstantin P√§ts was arrested and deported to Ufa on July 30. He died in a psychiatric hospital in Kalinin (currently Tver) in Russia in 1956. 800 Estonian officers, about half of the total, were executed, arrested or starved to death in prison camps. A total of 59,732 people is estimated to have been deported from Estonia during the period between July 1940 and June 1941.Dunsdorfs, Edgars. The Baltic Dilemma.

For postwar reconstruction, hundreds of thousands of Russophones were relocated into Estonia, mainly the cities. During the years 1945‚Äì1950, the total urban population count grew from 267,000 to 516,000; over 90% of the increase being fresh immigrants.Valge raamat, page 129; The White Book: Losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes, p. 147  Society  In the year 1950, the major problems meriting medical research were declared to be tuberculosis, traumatism, occupational diseases and dysentery. In comparison to the war years, birth rate had increased, mortality (including infant mortality) decreased, and the birth rate again exceeded the death rate.Valge raamat, page 48 Despite the immense needs for research, the Faculty of Medicine at the Tartu State University (now University of Tartu) suffered from major purges, culminating after March 1950. Altogether, 56 staff of the university were purged; in the Faculty of Medicine, 12 professors of 17 were removed from their positions. They were replaced with less skilled but politically reliable staff.  Culture  Estonian Song Festival in Tallinn in 1980  Sports  Tallinn was selected as host of the sailing events of the 1980 Olympics which led to controversy since Western countries had not de jure recognized ESSR as part of USSR. During preparations to the Olympics, sports buildings were built in Tallinn, along with other general infrastructure and broadcasting facilities. This wave of investment included Tallinn TV Tower, Pirita Yachting Centre, Linnahall, hotel \\"Ol√ºmpia\\" and the new Main Post Office building.  Controversies  Plaque on Stenbock House, the seat of the Government of Estonia, commemorating government members killed by Soviet forces While views diverge on history of Estonia, the core of the controversy lies in the varying interpretation of historical events and agreements during and after World War II. During the time of glasnost and the reassessment of Soviet history in the USSR, the USSR condemned the 1939 secret protocol between Nazi Germany and itself that had led to the invasion and occupation of the three Baltic countries.The Forty-Third Session of the UN Sub-Commission at Google Scholar The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the restoration of the Republic of Estonia's sovereignty.

The franchise focuses on the fictional non-governmental organization of the same name which monitors and regulates paranormal and alien activity on Earth while preventing civilians from finding out about it. The most notable agents within the organization are Zed, Jay, and Kay. The franchise has been adapted into other media including a series of four films, an animated television series, and video games. Publication The original The Men in Black comic books were published in 1990 and 1991. The Men in Black are a secret organization that monitors and suppresses paranormal activity on Earth (including aliens, demons, monsters, zombies and mutants), while keeping the populace ignorant of its happenings. Film series The series was adapted into a film in 1997, titled Men in Black, starring Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K and Will Smith as Agent J, with Barry Sonnenfeld as director. The film went on to become a commercial success, grossing US$587 million worldwide on a $90 million budget and earning a 91% rating from review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. A sequel, Men in Black II, was released in 2002 which saw both Jones and Smith reprising their roles. The film was a box office success, earning $441 million worldwide. Despite its success, the film was less critically acclaimed than its predecessor and received average reviews from critics with a score of 39% on Rotten Tomatoes. A third installment, Men in Black 3, was released ten years after the second film on May 25, 2012. It was also the first film in the series to be released in 3D. The film saw Smith and Jones reprise their roles, with Josh Brolin and Jemaine Clement joining the cast. It scored a 70% on Rotten Tomatoes. Although Men in Black 3 has concluded the series, talks have been made about the future of the series. Sonnenfeld claimed that Men in Black 3 is the conclusion of the MIB series, though leaving it open for the idea of a rebooted film series. Barry Sonnenfeld, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have expressed interest in a possible Men in Black 4. A crossover with the Jump Street franchise has also been discussed by Sony but without Jones and Smith; however, despite talks with James Bobin to direct, the idea was dropped in May 2016. On September 29, 2017, Sony announced a spin-off of the film with a script by Art Marcum and Matt Holloway for release in 2019. The movie features Chris Hemsworth as Agent H, Tessa Thompson as Agent M, Liam Neeson as High T, and Emma Thompson as Agent O.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2283336/ The movie was written by Matt Holloway and Art Marcum, directed by F. Gary Gray, and counts Steven Spielberg and Barry Sonnenfeld as executive producers.https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/men-in-black/267891/men-in- black-4-title-release-date-cast Television series An animated television series, Men in Black: The Series, aired from 1997 to 2001. The show was based on the films, taking place after the events of the first film. There are a few changes, such as Agent K apparently not having his memory erased. Video games The first Men in Black video game, Men in Black: The Game, was released for Windows 95 in 1997, followed by a release for the PlayStation. The game, developed by Gigawatt Studios and published by SouthPeak Interactive, is loosely based on the 1997 film. Another game, titled Men in Black: The Series, was released for the Game Boy Color in 1999, and is based on the animated television series. It was followed by a sequel in 2000, titled Men in Black 2: The Series and also for the Game Boy Color. In 2001, a version of Men in Black: The Series was released for the Game Boy Advance. Men in Black: The Series ‚Äì Crashdown was released later in 2001, for the PlayStation. In 2002, a video game partially based on the second film was released, titled Men in Black II: Alien Escape. A video game published by Activision entitled MIB: Alien Crisis was released in May 2012, around the time when the third movie was released. The Men in Black organization The Men in Black as shown in the movies is a secret organization devoted to policing and monitoring extraterrestrial activity on Earth. The Men in Black, founded in the U.S. in the mid-1950s, began as a small and poorly funded government organization devoted to making contact with extraterrestrial life known as the Baltians. They were initially seen as a joke, but did make contact on March 2, 1961, outside New York City. It was decided to make Earth an apolitical zone for aliens without a planet, and the organization broke its government ties to become the Men in Black, which became the force to conceal and police the aliens that came to Earth, no longer answerable to the government and therefore not obligated to answer any questions or respond to outside demands. The founding members were the seven agents present at the landing, plus an amateur astronomer and a teenager who got lost going to see his girlfriend. This last became Agent K, who later came to be regarded as the agency's best agent, and one of the agents became his partner D. The MIB has continued since then, with Zed as its chief, to protect the normal citizens of Earth from alien threats and police extraterrestrial immigrants. Other notable members include Agents B, J, and L. MIB agents sever all ties with their former lives and have all traces of their previous identities erased. They dress in black suits specifically chosen to avoid creating any lasting impression on civilians who see them. Their fingerprints and any other unique identifying features are erased, and they are issued neuralyzers to use in erasing the memories of civilian witnesses and Ray-Ban sunglasses to protect themselves against the device's effects. They have access to a wide array of alien weaponry and other technologies for use during missions. Retiring agents are neuralyzed to wipe their memories of working for MIB and may have their previous identities restored. The agency possesses a \\"deneuralyzer\\" that can restore retired agents' memories in emergency situations. No longer receiving federal funding from the government, the MIB are supported by the patents they hold on various confiscated alien innovations, including liposuction, the microwave oven, and velcro. Their standard operating day is based on Centaurian time, which lasts 37 hours, 16 of which an agent must spend on duty. Their main base is located at 504 Battery Drive in New York City. The Men in Black have bases in other locations, including one in the western United States (Zone 16), one mobile undersea base, and a Los Angeles division (dubbed \\"The Agency\\"). The three other founding members became Agent T, H and Q. In the animated series, an agent known as Alpha was said to be the first chief of the MIB; after he went rogue, Zed became the chief. With the release of the films Men in Black II and Men in Black 3, most if not all elements of the Men in Black animated series have been verified as non canon. Other Will Smith, who played Agent J in the films, released two rap singles based on the films: \\"Men in Black\\" (from Men in Black) and \\"Black Suits Comin' (Nod Ya Head)\\" (from Men in Black II). Men in Black: The Roleplaying Game was published by West End Games in 1997. The theme park ride Men in Black: Alien Attack at the Universal Studios Florida theme park is based on the film Men in Black, as is the parody film Men in White. In August 2015, Air New Zealand released a Men in Black themed safety video featuring members of the All Blacks, Rip Torn (reprising his role as Zed), and Frank the Pug.

He finished high school Don Bosco Technical Institute in Mandaluyong in 1972, and in 1975 he graduated cum laude with an A.B. Mathematics degree from De La Salle University in Manila. He studied and obtained an MBA with a concentration on Finance from Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in the United States in 1979.  Professional career  After college, Camacho worked at Banco Filipino, before he left to pursue graduate studies in the United States.

Government service  Camacho was appointed Energy Secretary by Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo when she took office in 2001. During his tenure, much needed reforms in the country's power sector were passed into law. On his third month as Energy Secretary, he was reassigned by Macapagal- Arroyo as Secretary of Finance, a post he held until November 2003 when he returned to the private sector. Upon his resignation as Secretary, news of the President's inaction on Camacho's recommendations for the Government Service Insurance System was perceived to have prompted it. His resignation brought anxieties and uncertainties in the government and caused the peso to plummet against the dollar to a record low. Camacho was recognized for his significant contributions in managing and stabilizing the country's fiscal deficit, and was even acknowledged by several groups of businessmen and investors as one of the best Finance secretaries the Philippines has ever had. The country's Anti- Money Laundering Law (R.A. 9160) was also passed under his tenure.

The organisers had arranged Vinoba's stay at Pochampally, a large village with about 700 families, of whom two-thirds were landless. Pochampally villagers gave Vinoba a warm welcome. By early afternoon villagers began to gather around Vinoba at Vinoba's cottage. The Villagers asked for eighty acres of land, forty wet, forty dry for forty families that would be enough. Then Vinoba asked,\\" If it is not possible to get land from the government, is there not something villagers themselves could do ?\\" To everyone's surprise,Pochampally's Zamindhar got up & said in a rather excited voice: \\"I will give you 1000 acres for these people\\" Indriyal Gopal Rao got up & repeated his promise to offer 1000 acres of land to the villagers. This incident neither planned nor imagined was the very genesis of the Bhoodan movement & it made Vinoba think that there in lay the potentiality of solving the land problem of India. This movement later on developed into a village gift or Gramdan movement. As the huge, massive and magnificent movement called Bhoodan Movement was born at this village Pochampally, the village renamed to Bhoodan Pochampally.

It was developed to give Ontario post-secondary students an opportunity to participate in equestrian sports while continuing their education. The OCEA welcomes riders of all skill levels, offering hunter seat equitation classes from beginner to advanced riders. The OCEA is team-focused, but allows for personal growth and learning. It allows any post-secondary student to participate in horse shows regardless of the rider's beginning skill level, financial status, or past riding experience. Both men and women are eligible to compete. There are 18 participating universities. Two colleges, Cambrian College and Georgian College, joined for the 2016‚Äì2017 season. The league was modelled after the American IHSA. Competition Riders compete in Hunter Seat Equitation. There are 4 different levels of competition: Entry, Novice, Intermediate, and Open. All riders compete both on the flat and over fences. Unlike the majority of equestrian competitions, it is a \\"catch ride\\" where riders generally have not ridden their horse before entering the ring. Horses are donated by the show hosts and assigned randomly by a draw. Competitors watch as their horses are schooled by experienced volunteers and then mount their horse for competition. Each member school is responsible for hosting one horse show per year. https://www.facebook.com/ontariocea/ Schools Currently, 17 universities and two colleges in Ontario as well as one Quebec university have participating teams. They are divided into three zones according to geographic proximity. East Zone: * Carleton University, Ottawa * McGill University, Montreal * Queen's University, Kingston * Trent University, Peterborough * University of Ottawa, Ottawa * University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa Central Zone: * Lakehead University, Thunder Bay * Ryerson University, Toronto * York University, Toronto * University of Guelph, Guelph * University of Toronto, Toronto * Georgian College, Barrie * Laurentian University and Cambrian College, Sudbury West Zone: * Brock University, St. Catharines * McMaster University, Hamilton * University of Waterloo, Waterloo * University of Western Ontario, London * Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo * University of Windsor, Windsor Divisions There are four divisions, each with an over fences and under saddle class. Riders in the Open division compete over a course of jumps set at 3', while Intermediate competes at 2'6\\", Novice 2'3\\" and Entry 18\\". Divisions are based upon ability and experience to allow riders compete against people of similar skill levels. Generally, the division qualifications are as follows: http://ontariocea.com/about.html Open: winning three first place ribbons in an equitation over fences at a height of 3'3\\", or placing six times in an equitation, hunter over fences, or jumper class at a height of 3'6\\". Intermediate: winning three first place ribbons in an equitation over fences at a height of 2'9\\", or placing six times in an equitation, hunter over fences, or jumper class at a height of 3'. Novice: winning three first place ribbons in an equitation over fences at a height of 2'6\\", or placing six times in an equitation, hunter over fences, or jumper class at a height of 2'9\\". Entry: being part of a lesson program, where the rider has been jumping a height of 2' or higher for at least four months. Judging Riders are judged on their equitation, meaning that each rider is individually judged on his or her effectiveness as a rider, ability to look aesthically pleasing (i.e. posture and positioning on the horse), and ability to make riding a horse seem easy and effortless. Individual ribbons correspond to points, which combine for a team score. Teams receive points from their highest place rider in a given class. Riders who win three first place ribbons over fences in a season must move up a division the following season. Points are awarded as follows: :* 1st place: 8 points :* 2nd place: 7 points :* 3rd place: 6 points :* 4th place: 5 points :* 5th place: 4 points :* 6th place: 3 point :* 7th place: 2 point :* 8th place: 1 point Each show names a high point rider, high point school, and division grand and reserve champions for each division. Spirit awards and sportsmanship awards are awarded at the discretion of the host school. Finals and Banquet The season ends with Finals, where riders from all three zones compete against each other. The top 6 or 7 riders from each zone qualify separately in the over fences and under saddle classes to compete at Finals. At Finals, four riders ride one of five horses in the over fences portion. The rider on each horse with the highest score is called back for a short workoff, where all five callback riders ride the same new horse. The top five riders in the under saddle classes also perform a short workoff test on the flat. Points awarded at Finals are counted towards zone year-end awards, which are presented at the Awards Banquet the day following Finals. The top 8 riders in each division from each zone are awarded, as well as the Zone high-point and reserve high-point rider. Teams are awarded Zone high-point or reserve high-point and the team with the most points across all three zones is awarded the provincial championship. Name change In 2017, the organization announced its official change of name to become the Ontario Collegiate Equestrian Association (OCEA). This change was intended to reflect the association's diversified school involvement with both universities and colleges.

It ended the Russo-Swedish War (1554‚Äì1557), a series of skirmishes in the Viborg and Oreshek areas resulting from Swedish attempts to keep Livonia, where the Teutonic Order's rule had collapsed, out of the Russian sphere of influence. Negotiations and ratification Eric XIV of Sweden Since 1554, Gustav I of Sweden had attempted to draw the Livonian gentry into an alliance with Sweden, Denmark-Norway and Poland-Lithuania. After his failure, Gustav I started negotiations for a Russo-Swedish peace with Novgorod's governor, Prince Mikhail Vasil'evich Glinsky. Novgorod was the traditional Russo-Swedish contact point, and Russian tsar Ivan IV \\"the Terrible\\" refused to negotiate with Sweden directly since he regarded the elected Gustav I to be of lower status than a hereditary tsar as himself. Gustav I, on the other hand, did not recognise the Russian tsar as an emperor. He also questioned whether the \\"Duchy of Muscovy\\" could represent Russia. Therefore, he wanted to send the Swedish commander of Viborg Castle as negotiator. In the end, Ivan IV claimed that he made an exception and allowed a Swedish delegation, led by Sten Eriksson Leijonhufvud, Gustav I's brother-in-law and Laurentius Petri, Archbishop of Uppsala, to leave Novgorod for an audience in Moscow, where they met him in person.De Madariaga (2006), p. 125 The Swedish delegation had 100 men. The delegates had entered Russia after √Öbo clergyman Knut Johanneson had acquired the necessary permit in Moscow in 1556. The delegates had arrived in Moscow on 24 February 1557, but the conclusion of the treaty was delayed until the end of March by the fasting period.Heininen&Heikkil;√§ (2002), p. 70 The treaty was then signed between Novgorod and Sweden and introduced a Russo- Swedish truce, which was set to expire in forty years. Sweden agreed to not support Livonia or Poland-Lithuania in a war between thwm and Russia. In addition, Swedish envoys were again barred from ever meeting the Russian tsar and referred to Novgorod for further contacts.De Madariaga (2006), p. 126 On 2 April, in Novgorod, the treaty was put into effect by kissing the cross, following Russian tradition, as demanded by Ivan IV. Michael Agricola, who translated the New Testament into Finnish and is regarded \\"father of the Finnish written language\\", was also part of the delegation. He died of illness on their way back in Uusikirkko (now Polyane). Consequences Ivan IV of Russia Half-a-year later, a Polish-Lithuanian-Livonian alliance was established by the Treaty of Pozvol. Russia reacted promptly and invaded Livonia, starting the Livonian War between Denmark, Livonia, Poland-Lithuania, Russia and Sweden (1558‚Äì1583).De Madariaga (2006), p. 127 The Grand Master of the Teutonic Order State in Livonia, Gotthard von Kettler, subordinated the order's territory and himself to Poland-Lithuania in the Treaties of Vilna (1559 and 1561), but those measures did not prevent Russian occupation of most of Livonia.De Madariaga (2006), pp. 129‚Äì130 Eric XIV, Swedish king since 1560,De Madariaga (2006), p. 189 coveted the Livonian port of Reval (Tallinn), and the Russo-Swedish truce was re-negotiated and set to last twenty years in August 1561 with Reval subordinating itself to Swedish rule.De Madariaga (2006), p. 191 In the Treaty of Dorpat (Tartu, May 1564), Ivan IV of Russia accepted the subordinance of Reval and some Livonian castles to Erik XIV, and in turn Erik XIV accepted the subordinance of the rest of Livonia to Ivan IV.De Madariaga (2006), p. 192 Russian-Swedish relations deteriorated when prince and later king John III of Sweden married Catherine Jagellon who before had rejected Ivan IV.De Madariaga (2006), pp. 191‚Äì192 In early 1565, another truce was signed with Sweden, this time set to last seven years.De Madariaga (2006), p. 195 In 1566, Russia and Poland-Lithuania held talks about an expulsion of the Swedes from Livonia and a partition of Livonia among themselves.De Madariaga (2006), pp. 195-196 In 1570, Magnus of Livonia was made king of Livonia in Moscow as a vassal of Ivan IV, and pursued to siege Reval supplied with 20,000 Russian soldiers and 15,000 rubels granted to him by the tsar.De Madariaga (2006), pp. 245-255 Magnus soon defected and Russia was defeated by Sweden and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the Livonian War that ended with the treaty of Plussa. After renewed hostilities however, the conflict would not be concluded until the Treaty of Teusina in 1595 whereby the borders according to the peace of N√∂teborg between Sweden and Novgorod from 1323 were finally agreed between Sweden and Russia. Russia had to resign all claims to Estonia.

Based on the idea of progress in which advancements in science, technology, economic development and social organization are vital to the improvement of the human condition, progressivism became highly significant during the Age of Enlightenment in Europe, out of the belief that Europe was demonstrating that societies could progress in civility from uncivilized conditions to civilization through strengthening the basis of empirical knowledge as the foundation of society.Harold Mah. Enlightenment Phantasies: Cultural Identity in France and Germany, 1750‚Äì1914. Cornell University. (2003). p. 157. Figures of the Enlightenment believed that progress had universal application to all societies and that these ideas would spread across the world from Europe. The contemporary common political conception of progressivism emerged from the vast social changes brought about by industrialization in the Western world in the late-19th century. Progressives take the view that progress is being stifled by vast economic inequality between the rich and the poor; minimally regulated laissez-faire capitalism with monopolistic corporations; and the intense and often violent conflict between capitalists and workers, arguing that measures were needed to address these problems. The meanings of progressivism have varied over time and from different perspectives. Early-20th century progressivism was tied to eugenics and the temperance movement, both of which were promoted in the name of public health and as initiatives toward that goal.James H. Timberlake, Prohibition and the Progressive Movement, 1900‚Äì1920 (1970) Contemporary progressives promote public policies that they believe will lead to positive social change. In the 21st century, a movement that identifies as progressive is \\"a social or political movement that aims to represent the interests of ordinary people through political change and the support of government actions\\".\\"Progressivism\\". The Cambridge English Dictionary. 24 June 2020. Retrieved 3 May 2020.  History = From the Enlightenment to the Industrial Revolution  Immanuel Kant Immanuel Kant identified progress as being a movement away from barbarism towards civilization. 18th-century philosopher and political scientist Marquis de Condorcet predicted that political progress would involve the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of sex inequality, prison reforms which at the time were harsh and the decline of poverty.Nisbet, Robert (1980). History of the Idea of Progress. New York: Basic Books. ch 5 Modernity or modernization was a key form of the idea of progress as promoted by classical liberals in the 19th and 20th centuries who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to free markets and free movements of people. John Stuart Mill In the late 19th century, a political view rose in popularity in the Western world that progress was being stifled by vast economic inequality between the rich and the poor, minimally regulated laissez-faire capitalism with out-of-control monopolistic corporations, intense and often violent conflict between capitalists and workers, with a need for measures to address these problems. Progressivism has influenced various political movements. Social liberalism was influenced by British liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill's conception of people being \\"progressive beings\\".Alan Ryan. The Making of Modern Liberalism. p. 25. British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli developed progressive conservatism under one-nation Toryism.Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. pp. 107‚Äì08.Robert Blake. Disraeli. Second Edition. London, England, UK: Eyre & Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd, 1967. p. 524. In France, the space between social revolution and the socially- conservative laissez-faire centre-right was filled with the emergence of radicalism which thought that social progress required anti-clericalism, humanism and republicanism. Especially anti-clericalism was the dominant influence on the centre-left in many French- and Romance-speaking countries until the mid 20th-century. In Imperial Germany, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck enacted various progressive social welfare measures out of paternalistic conservative motivations to distance workers from the socialist movement of the time and as humane ways to assist in maintaining the Industrial Revolution.Union Contributions to Labor Welfare Policy and Practice: Past, Present, and Future. Routledge, 16, 2013. p. 172. In 1891, the Roman Catholic Church encyclical Rerum novarum issued by Pope Leo XIII condemned the exploitation of labour and urged support for labour unions and government regulation of businesses in the interests of social justice while upholding the right to property and criticizing socialism.Faith Jaycox. The Progressive Era. New York, New York: Infobase Publishing, 2005. p. 85. A Protestant progressive outlook called the Social Gospel emerged in North America that focused on challenging economic exploitation and poverty and by the mid-1890s was common in many Protestant theological seminaries in the United States.Charles Howard Hopkins, The Rise of the Social Gospel in American Protestantism, 1865‚Äì1915 (1940).  Contemporary mainstream political conception  Theodore Roosevelt In the United States, progressivism began as a social movement in the 1890s and grew into a political movement in what was known as the Progressive Era. While the term American progressives represent a range of diverse political pressure groups (not always united), some American progressives rejected social Darwinism, believing that the problems society faced such as class warfare, greed, poverty, racism and violence could best be addressed by providing good education, a safe environment and an efficient workplace. Progressives lived mainly in the cities, were college educated and believed that government could be a tool for change.he Progressive Era (1890‚Äì1920), The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project (retrieved 31 September 2014). President Theodore Roosevelt of the Republican Party and later the Progressive Party declared that he \\"always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand\\".Jonathan Lurie. William Howard Taft: The Travails of a Progressive Conservative. New York, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. 196. Woodrow Wilson President Woodrow Wilson was also a member of the American progressive movement within the Democratic Party. Progressive stances have evolved over time. Imperialism was a controversial issue within progressivism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the United States, where some progressives supported American imperialism while others opposed it. In response to World War I, President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points established the concept of national self-determination and criticized imperialist competition and colonial injustices. These views were supported by anti-imperialists in areas of the world that were resisting imperial rule.Reconsidering Woodrow Wilson: Progressivism, Internationalism, War, and Peace. p. 309. During the period of acceptance of economic Keynesianism (1930s‚Äì1970s), there was widespread acceptance in many nations of a large role for state intervention in the economy. With the rise of neoliberalism and challenges to state interventionist policies in the 1970s and 1980s, centre-left progressive movements responded by adopting the Third Way that emphasized a major role for the market economy.Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?. Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 3‚Äì4, 16. There have been social democrats who have called for the social-democratic movement to move past Third Way.After the Third Way: The Future of Social Democracy in Europe. I. B. Taurus, 2012. p. 47. Prominent progressive conservative elements in the British Conservative Party have criticized neoliberalism.Hugh Bochel. The Conservative Party and Social Policy. The Policy Press, 2011. p. 108. In the 21st century, progressives continue to favour public policy that reduces or ameliorates the harmful effects of economic inequality as well as systemic discrimination such as institutional racism; to advocate for environmentally conscious policies as well as for social safety nets and workers' rights; and to oppose the negative externalities inflicted on the environment and society by monopolies or corporate influence on the democratic process. The unifying theme is to call attention to the negative impacts of current institutions or ways of doing things and to advocate for social progress, i.e. for positive change as defined by any of several standards such as expansion of democracy, increased egalitarianism in the form of economic and social equality as well as improved well being of a population. Proponents of social democracy have identified themselves as promoting the progressive cause.Henning Meyer, Jonathan Rutherford. The Future of European Social Democracy: Building the Good Society.

A process seeking his canonization is underway. Biography Ghebreamlak was born on 23 June 1895 in the village of Guifa in Eritrea, then an Italian colony, to parents who were Ethiopian-rite Catholics and who raised him in that faith. At the age of 12, he entered the Minor Seminary at Cheren (now Keren). He was ordained to the priesthood as part of the secular clergy on 22 September 1918. Ghebreamlak then worked to bring the Monophysite and Orthodox Christians back into union with the Roman Catholic Church. Since Ethiopians respect monastic life, he sought to continue his work in Ethiopia as a monk. When, in 1925, he was sent to the Ethiopian College in Rome to serve there as confessor for the seminarians, he took the opportunity to learn more about Benedictine life. He studied monastic theology and sought advice from the Abbot of St. Paul outside the Walls, Ildefonso Schuster. Casamari Abbey, a Cistercian monastery, accepted his project of establishing a monastery in his homeland, and Ghebreamlak entered there as a candidate on 7 December 1930. As he entered the monastic enclosure he is said to have kissed the threshold and exclaimed: \\"These are the gates of paradise.\\"Sorana beatificationis (1970), p. 9 He was joined in 1931 by a group of twelve fellow Ethiopian candidates. Ghebreamlak was diagnosed as suffering from incurable tuberculosis in 1933. With death imminent, he was permitted to make his solemn monastic profession on 4 April 1934, eight months ahead of time. While hospitalized in Sora, he died on 8 June 1934, the Feast of the Sacred Heart that year, and was buried in the monastic cemetery at Casamari Abbey.Cistercian Order \\"Venerabile P. Felice Haylemariam Ghebreamlak\\" His last words are said to have been: \\"Jesus, I love you and want to love you always\\". Soon other Ethiopians entered Casamari with the goal of founding Cistercian monasteries in Ethiopia. Today there are five Cistercian monasteries in his native country. Veneration to him started in early, especially among the Ethiopian and Eritrean clergy, who prayed at his grave. The cause for Ghebreamlak's canonization was started in 1955, with formal investigations of his life being carried out from 1956-1960, being officially accepted by the Holy See in 1969. From 1980, further investigations were carried by the Diocese of Sora and the Ge'ez Rite Archeparchy of Asmara. On 24 March 1992, Ghebreamlak's virtues were officially declared to be heroic by Pope John Paul II.Cistercian Order Literature * Columbano De Cristofaro: Il servo di Dio D.

He also wrote under the name of Richard Telfair. Biography Mr. Jessup spent his early years in and out of a local orphanage before running away to sea as a merchant seaman. In an interview in 1970, he said that he had read himself around the world, ferreting out English-language bookshops at each port of call and reading a book a day while at sea. During this time, he copied War and Peace on a typewriter while afloat, corrected all the errors, then threw the work over the side.p.358 Twentieth-Century Western Writers Second Edition St. James Press In 1948, he left the sea behind and began a career as a full-time writer, averaging 10 hours a day at the typewriter. He designed and built a home in Connecticut, where he lived until moving to Florida a few years ago. Several of his novels drew upon his experiences at sea; one of them, Sailor, about a youth who signs on as a merchant seaman and sails around the world, was described in The New York Times as a seafaring novel written with salt spray and affection. Mr. Jessup wrote more than 60 books, most of them paperback originals about crime (A Rage to Die), detectives (Cry Passion), Indians (Comanche Vengeance) and adventure (The Deadly Duo, about an American reporter who tries to foil a murder on the Riviera). He wrote under several pseudonyms, including Richard Telfair, and he also wrote radio shows and television scripts. Book Becomes a Movie. His best-known work, The Cincinnati Kid, published in 1964 in hardcover and later made into a motion picture with Steve McQueen, Edward G. Robinson, Ann Margaret and Tuesday Weld, was highly praised in The Times. Mr. Jessup has brilliantly enlarged the microcosm of the gambling table, to make it a genuine setting for a novel, said the reviewer. Within its circle, men act out, again and again, their commitment against the gratuitousness and terror of fate. Some turn into machines that bleed inside. And others come to know finally that they are human beings. Mr. Jessup attributed much of his outlook to a chance meeting with Albert Camus in Marsailles in 1945, during which they drank together for hours and the philosopher impressed upon the 20-year-old seaman his existential philosophy. Mr. Jessup wrote the book and the screenplay for Chuka, about the lone survivor of a massacre by Arapahoe Indians in the 1870s. The movie starred Rod Taylor, Ernest Borgnine and John Mills. Mr. Jessup also wrote Foxway, a novel published in 1971 about a psychologically distraught young combat veteran of Vietnam. His last novel, Threat, published 1981, also dealt with a Vietnam veteran, this one who was working his way through Columbia University by robbing bookies in an effort to raise ransom money for his twin brother, a prisoner of the North Vietnamese.

In the same year, Jessup wrote a teleplay for Tom Corbett, Space Cadet. The novel was filmed as The Young Don't Cry in 1957 with Jessup writing the screenplay for the film with Sal Mineo as the lead. He began writing Westerns in 1957 with Cheyenne Saturday and finishing with Chuka where he wrote the screenplay for the film of the same name for actor and producer Rod Taylor. Jessup wrote a series of three Westerns featuring Wyoming Jones under the name Richard Telfair. With his Western series ending, in the same year he wrote again as Telfair for a series of spy novels featuring Montgomery Nash. He used the name Telfair for an original novel based on the TV series Danger Man (the half-hour precursor to \\"Secret Agent\\", as it was known in the US) called Target for Tonight in 1962. Inspired by The Hustler, Jessup wrote a novel of poker playing called The Cincinnati Kid that was filmed with Steve McQueen. In 1962, another of his novels, The Deadly Duo, was also filmed. In 1969, he wrote Sailor based on his experiences as a merchant seaman. Otto Preminger bought the rights to his novel Foxway for filming, but the movie was never made.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat;=19710222&id;=lTwgAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=SWYEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7439,2206158 His final work was Threat published in 1981.

The term does not exclusively apply to battles, and can be used more generally regarding entire campaigns or theaters of war. Mountains, for example, can block off certain areas, making it unnecessary to station troops within the inaccessible area. This deployment strategy can be applied with other formidable environmental features as well, such as forests and mountains. In the former instance, dense vegetation can provide concealment for tactical movements such as setting up an ambush. In the latter, the elevation can provide an advantage to soldiers using projectile weapons, such as arrows or artillery pieces. Elevation itself is perhaps the most well-known example of terrain advantage, with gravity working to the advantage of the more elevated party. While securing a terrain advantage is an important consideration for modern commanders, particularly those engaged in unconventional tactics such as guerrilla warfare, it was likely of even greater concern for pre-industrial forces, as lack of mobility and first-generation warfare left soldiers very vulnerable to its effects. The ancient military strategist Sun-Tzu, for example, dedicated an entire chapter in his treatise The Art of War to terrain and situational positioning. Examples Many ancient fortifications made use of terrain, such as this Surami fortress. * The Battle of Agincourt- The nearby trees created a choke point where the French were hit by English long bowmen. The main environmental factor in English victory was the extremely muddy area. The field had recently been plowed, and it had been raining recently. * The Alps have long been used to protect northern Italy. Few people have tried crossing the Alps in a military invasion, with some notable exceptions (Hannibal Barca and Napoleon Bonaparte). * The battles of Morgarten (Swiss confederation, 1315), Lake Trasimene (Roman empire, 217 BC) and the Battle of Teutoburg Forest (Roman empire, 7 AD) signified battles where the attacker was forced to fight at a narrow place between a lake (or a swamp) and hills. * During the American Revolutionary War, Peninsular War, Vietnam War, etc., militants relied on the terrain to combat forces that were superior, either in numbers, or in quality.

Treaty An ongoing Danish mediation of this conflict became void with the intervention of Sigismund II Augustus, king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania and by the terms of Cracow protector of Wilhelm's brother, Albert.

Wilhelm was restored to his former position as archbishop, with his liberty and all former rights confirmed. Livonia restored its relation to Lithuania, and both realms concluded a defense-offense pact. The new grand master, Wilhelm von F√ºrstenberg, signed the alliance for the order and also ratified the other two treaties on 14 September along with other members of the order. Consequences The alliance was directed against the Tsardom of Russia, then striving for hegemony in the area and regarding the treaty as a casus belli. Tsar Ivan IV \\"the Terrible\\", who in March had ended the Russo- Swedish War with the Treaty of Novgorod and since focussed on Livonia, claiming the subordination of Dorpat (Tartu) for a start. The tsar reacted to Pozvol by invading Livonia before the alliance would result in an actual mobilization of forces, starting the Livonian War (1558‚Äì1583). As a result, Reval (Tallinn) turned to Sweden for protection, √ñsel (Saaremaa) was occupied by Denmark-Norway, and the order's grand master Gotthard von Kettler secularized what was left of the Russian-occupied order state, formally subordinated it to Sigismund II Augustus, and established himself as duke of Courland.

History Before it became a buddhist retreat centre, the land was known as L'Engayresque, which means 'the place of springs' in the ancient Occitan language.Dalai Lama, Mind in Comfort and Ease Boston:Wisdom, 2007 p.xvii The site was chosen by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche in 1990, and was then blessed by Dodrupchen Rinpoche in 1991. It has hosted Rigpa's annual summer retreats since 1992. Since then it has been visited by many of the highest ranking lamas of all Tibetan Buddhist schools, including the Dalai Lama who visited both in 2000 and 2008, and Sakya Trizin in 2007. From 2006 until 2009 a traditional three-year retreat took place with over 300 participants. Temple The three-storey temple at Lerab Ling with its distinctive copper roofs is based on traditional Tibetan architecture. Its centrepiece is a statue of Buddha Shakyamuni crafted in Burma. It also includes 1000 bronze buddha statues representing the 1000 buddhas of this kalpa (aeon). There is a statue of Padmasambhava in the lake to the north-east of the main temple.

The term is the direct analogue of the Latin term militia, which applied to all categories of state officials already under the late Roman Empire. The most common usage of the term in middle Byzantine times was in the military sphere: the holder of a strateia, or stratiotes (œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ), was obliged either to provide military service himself, or to provide money for the upkeep of a soldier, either as an individual or as a group/community (syndotai, \\"co- givers\\"). By the 10th century, the strateia had evolved from being a personal, hereditary duty of the stratiotes and his family, to a duty attached to the military lands (stratiotika ktemata) that were then allocated to the individual stratiotai. The stratiotika ktemata probably originated in the military crisis of the 7th century, when the state was forced to offer land in lieu of cash payment in exchange for the strateia, but they are not actually attested until the 10th century. By that time, various categories of strateiai existed, based on the income of the lands attached to them: alongside strateiai for the upkeep of sailors, infantrymen and cavalrymen, these included strateiai for the upkeep of demosios dromos (public post) and of a heavy cavalryman (cataphract), the latter a new service instituted under Nikephoros II Phokas in the 960s. The strateiai of sailors fell in two categories: the sailors of the maritime themes, who had to equip and fight themselves and saw more action, received lands worth four pounds of gold, while the sailors of the smaller regional fleets, as well as the central Imperial Fleet in Constantinople held property of two pounds of gold (the Imperial Fleet received cash salaries in addition). In Byzantine law, the stratiotai were distinguished from the general agricultural population (georgoi); the stratiotai were even prohibited from engaging in commerce or agriculture themselves, and exempted from all the other fiscal obligations save the aerikon and kanon taxes. They also received pay (roga) and state- sponsored supplies (opsonion) for taking part in military expeditions and performing labour in public works. Successive 10th-century emperors also took care to maintain the system by placing restrictions on the sale of the stratiotika ktemata: Constantine VII set minimum inalienable values of four pounds of gold for cavalrymen and two pounds for sailors, which Nikephoros II Phokas raised it to 12 pounds to ensure that the cataphract strateiai would be maintained. Abandoned properties were automatically restored to the original owner without compensation, having a retroactive force of 40 years, and rights of pre-emption (protimesis) on any available military land was granted to relatives or members of the same community as the original holder's. The exact nature of the stratiotai during the heyday of the theme system in the 7th‚Äì11th centuries has been the subject of debate, with views ranging from their identification as \\"soldier-farmers\\" by George Ostrogorsky to the view of Paul Lemerle that 10th-century stratiotai did not actually campaign themselves, but provided only material support. Evidence from contemporary documents seems to support the former view, however. By the 11th century, the strateia had become a purely fiscal obligation, and lo longer entailed any requirement for rendering personal military service. Consequently, instead of native Byzantine soldiers, mercenaries were increasingly hired by the proceeds from the strateia, a process accelerated after the late 11th century with the loss of the recruiting grounds of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks. Like all other fiscal exactions, exemptions from it could be secured. Even after the fiscalization of the strateia, the term \\"stratiotes\\" remained in usage as a fiscal term for a class of landowners until at least the 14th century. The strateia is not to be confused with pronoia, a similar but distinct term employed from the 12th century on. The strateioumenoi farmed their own land, while pronoiarioi merely received the proceeds from their grants to maintain themselves.

It was raised in 1915 as part of the First Australian Imperial Force for service during World War I and formed part of the 6th Brigade, attached to the 2nd Division. It fought during the Gallipoli campaign and on the Western Front before being disbanded in late 1918. The battalion was the first Australian battalion to commence active operations on the Western Front and also had the distinction of being the last to pull back when the Australian Corps was withdrawn from the line. In 1921, the battalion was re-raised as a part-time unit of the Citizens Force but was later amalgamated with the 23rd Battalion in 1929 to form the 23rd/21st Battalion. History=World War I The 21st Battalion was raised at Broadmeadows, Victoria, in February 1915 as part of the formation of the 6th Brigade, 2nd Division. A unit of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), it was raised from volunteers for overseas service that were drawn from all over Australia. After training at Broadmeadows and Seymour Camps in Victoria, the battalion left for Egypt. Arriving there in June 1915, it undertook further training before being dispatched as reinforcements to Gallipoli in late August. En route the battalion's transport, HMT Southland, was torpedoed by German submarine UB-14 near Lemnos and the passengers and crew were forced to abandon ship. Nevertheless, the 21st Battalion eventually arrived at ANZAC Cove on 7 September. Following this they undertook mainly defensive duties along the Australian line until December 1915, when they were evacuated from Gallipoli after the decision was made to withdraw Allied forces from the peninsula. One 21st Battalion soldier who was killed during the Gallipoli campaign, Private James Martin, who was only 14 years and nine months old, is believed to have been the youngest Australian soldier killed during the war.Hill 2001, p. 135. Members of the 21st Battalion receiving inoculations prior to deployment to Gallipoli Returning to Egypt via Lemnos,Hill 2001, p. 139. the battalion undertook Canal Zone defensive duties and further training. During this time the AIF underwent a period of reorganisation while its future employment on operations was decided.Grey 2008, p. 99. A number of units from the 1st Division were split up and used to provide cadre staff for newly formed battalions, however, the 21st Battalion, like the rest of those from the 2nd Division remained intact.Bean 1941, p. 42.Grey 2008, pp. 99‚Äì100. In mid-1916, the decision was made to transfer part of the AIF to Europe to take part in the fighting along the Western Front,Grey 2008, p. 100. and in March 1916 the battalion arrived in France. In April, they became the first Australian battalion to \\"commence active operations on the Western Front\\". In July 1916, during the Battle of Pozi√®res, the battalion was committed to the battle, but was mainly used to carry out portage tasks. Later, in August, during the fighting around Mouquet Farm, the 21st Battalion suffered its most significant losses of the war. Throughout 1917, the battalion took part in two major battles after the Germans shortened their lines and withdrew towards the prepared defences of the Hindenburg Line. The first battle came in May, when the 21st Battalion fought in the Second Battle of Bullecourt. Later, they were moved to Belgium, where in October, during the fighting around Broodseinde they advanced over before being withdrawn from the line for rest. The 21st Battalion attacks Mont St Quentin, 1 September 1918 After a period in reserve for rest and reinforcement the battalion was called upon to help to defend against the German Spring Offensive of April 1918. After this was defeated, the Allies launched their own offensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive and subsequently the 21st Battalion went on to participate in the battles of Hamel, Amiens and Mont St. Quentin. During the fight for Mont St Quentin, Sergeant Albert Lowerson was awarded the Victoria Cross. He had led seven men, attacking the flanks of a post, rushed the strongpoint and captured it, together with 12 machine-guns and 30 prisoners. He was severely wounded in the right thigh, but refused to leave the front line until the position had been consolidated. As a result of the heavy losses that the battalion suffered during this time, coupled with the limited reinforcements arriving from Australia following the defeat of the conscription referendum, the 21st Battalion's strength fell to the point where it was able to field little more than a company of men fit for active service. As a result, it was ordered to disband and provide reinforcements to other battalions. On 25 September 1918, however, the battalion's personnel mutinied in protest against the order to disband and subsequently the order was rescinded. Thus, the 21st Battalion took part in the final Australian operation of the war, joining the attack at Montbrehain on 5 October. The following day, however, upon a request made by Prime Minister Billy Hughes, the Australian Corps was withdrawn from the line.Grey 2008, p. 109. The 21st Battalion had the distinction of being the last Australian battalion to be withdrawn. Following this, the battalion was formally disbanded on 13 October 1918 and its personnel dispersed to other units as reinforcements. Throughout its service during the war, it suffered 872 men killed and 2,434 wounded (including those that were gassed). Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, five Distinguished Service Orders with one Bar, one Officer of the Order of the British Empire, 22 Military Crosses with seven Bars, 29 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 117 Military Medals with seven Bars, seven Meritorious Service Medals, 24 Mentions in Despatches, and eight foreign awards. Inter-war years In May 1921, following the decision to reorganise Australia's part-time military force to reflect the formations of the AIF,Grey 2008, p. 125. the battalion was re-raised as a Citizens Force unit drawing personnel drawn from currently serving Citizen Forces soldiers and ex-AIF members. Headquartered around Warrnambool, Victoria, the battalion was assigned to the 6th Brigade once again, but that brigade was allocated to 4th Division, within the 3rd Military District.Palazzo 2001, p. 102. Upon formation, the newly raised unit drew personnel from parts of the 21st and 23rd Infantry Regiments, and the 19th Light Horse. Through these links, it perpetuated the battle honours and traditions of its predecessor units, including an honour for service in South Africa. In 1927, when territorial designations were adopted, the battalion assumed the title of \\"The Victorian Rangers\\"; its motto ‚Äì Pro Deo Et Patria ‚Äì was also approved that year.Festberg 1972, p. 82. Initially, the battalion was brought up to strength with personnel serving under the compulsory training scheme, but in 1929, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was abolished and this, coupled with the economic privations of the Great Depression reduced the number of recruits available.Grey 2008, p. 138. As a result, the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units.Keogh 1965, p. 44. The 21st Battalion was one of those chosen and it was linked with the 23rd Battalion to become the 23rd/21st Battalion, which was headquartered around Geelong. This battalion undertook garrison duties in the Northern Territory during World War II, before being disbanded in August 1943 without having served overseas. Commanding officers The following officers served as commanding officer of the 21st Battalion during World War I: *Lieutenant Colonel John Francis Hutchinson; *Lieutenant Colonel Frederick William Dempster Forbes; *Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Oscar Charles Duggan.

It generally consists of a stew made from swede, carrots and potatoes in varying proportions and diverse, usually smoked or pickled, types of meat or sausage. Occasionally special cooking pears used as well. The stew may be seasoned and refined with salt, pepper, mustard, horseradish, celery, leeks or parsley, etc., according to taste.  Regional variations  On many farms this dish was prepared almost daily, alongside roast potatoes. Often it alternated with a second, daily-changing meal. For this reason, especially in the region of Stade, it is still called Tokokers (= Zugekochtes). If the meat is smoked, the dish is also called R√∂kert (= Ger√§uchertes or \\"smoked\\"). In Schleswig-Holstein the stew is made with pre-cooked sausage (Kochwurst) and Kassler and is known as R√ºbenmalheur. For the variant known as L√ºbecker National, pork (blade, belly) is preferred. This recipe can also contain onions. In Hamburg the corresponding dish is called Hamburger National. In Land Hadeln the potatoes are generally replaced by white flour dumplings (Kl√ºten), which is why it goes under the name of Speck und Kl√ºten (\\"bacon and dumplings\\"). Up to the middle of the 20th century as particularly substantial version of this stew was a popular fare for dinner on Christmas Eve (Fullbuksobend = 'Vollbauchabend or \\"full belly evening\\").

The EP, coming as it did before most other generally recognized landmarks of hardcore punk, is, along with Black Flag's Nervous Breakdown EP, sometimes considered the first record in the genre.

Land Hadeln is a historic landscape and former administrative district in Northern Germany with its seat in Otterndorf on the Lower Elbe, the lower reaches of the River Elbe, in the Elbe-Weser Triangle between the estuaries of the Elbe and Weser. The name goes back to a place (Latin: locus) named Haduloha in the Royal Frankish Annals,ANNALES REGNI FRANCORUM online (in Latin)] which must have been in the north of Hohe Lieth moraine range, west of presentday Cuxhaven. Enthusiastic historians of late 19th and early 20th century postulated an Old Saxon Gau (district) of that name, but there is no evidence for this theory.Hans-Ulrich Hucker: Das Problem von Herrschaft und Freiheit in den Landesgemeinden des Mittelalters im Unterweserraum (Thesis, M√ºnster 1978), available in Staatsarchiv Bremen (n¬∞. 538 U) und in the Library of M√§nner vom Morgenstern historical society in Bremerhaven In the Middle Ages, the Land Hadeln was a fairly, but not perfectly, autonomous rural community, applying Saxon Law. Nominally, it belonged to the Dukes of Saxe- Lauenburg, whom the notables of the country almost had chosen, because they were too weak to rule strictly. The Land Hadeln has to be consequently distinguished from the Land Wursten west of it that was a perfectly autonomous rural republic, for some centuries. It was the easternmost of the Frisian republics and applied Frisian Law. Geography  Today the name 'Land Hadeln' is mainly restricted to the dyked marshes in the lowland bay south of the Elbe estuary. It was surrounding by sandy meltwater depositions and moraines of the Saale glaciation (Pleistocene), such as the geest ridges of the Hohe Lieth to the west, the Westerberg (56 m above NN), and the Wingst (74 m above NN) to the east. To the south, between the islands of geest, sprawl extensive areas of fen and raised bog, that have been cultivated however, apart from a small terrain remnant in Ahlenmoor. The marshland itself, forming part of the Elbe Marshes, is divided in turn into the fertile sea marsh, the so-called Hochland (\\"highland\\", ca. 1‚Äì2 m above NN; comprising much of today's collective municipality of Hadeln), and the Sietland on the edge of the bogs. Drainage is difficult and is handled mainly by the pumping station (Sch√∂pfwerk Otterndorf) in Otterndorf as well as by the small lock near Altenbruch. At Otterndorf the waters of the Medem and its many tributaries, and the water of the Hadeln Canal, and Elbe-Weser Shipping Channel, is pumped into the Elbe. Hitherto the area, particularly the lower-lying Sietland which lies about 0.8 m below NN, had been chronically endangered by flooding. The Land Hadeln lies in the Lower Elbe region. Its proximity to the Elbe estuary and the North Sea brings with it the danger that, in the event of a dyke breach during a storm surge the area, which lies just above sea level, will suffer major flooding. Traditionally the land was used for agriculture, with pastureland and cattle farming on the geest and in the Sietland, and arable and fruit farming in the Hochland. Following the closure of the cement works in Hemmoor, the relatively small number of industrial workers decreased further. Many workers now commute to the ports of Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven and Stade. The economic importance of tourism, especially in the beach resorts of Otterndorf and the bogside lakes near Bad Bederkesa, is steadily increasing.  History = Middle Ages  The first written record of Hadeln is found at the end of the 10th century in the Saxon tribal chronicle (Stammessage) by Widukind of Corvey. In other medieval chronicles the area \\"where the ocean rinses Saxony\\" (\\"wo der Ozean Sachsen besp√ºlt\\") is called Haduloha or Hatheleria. In 797 AD, Charlemagne is supposed to have advanced to Hadeln during a campaign against the Saxons and Frisians. During the Viking invasions of the 9th to 11th centuries, Hadeln was part of the County of Lesum. In the 10th century, the Udonids established the County of Heilangau, better known under its later name the County of Stade. In 1063, the Udones sold their imperial immediacy to the Archbishopric of Bremen, but remained, as their vassals, still the direct rulers of the county. Around 1100, the development of the marshland in accordance with Holler rights (Hollerrecht) began. With the increase in cultural land and population, Hadeln was separated from the County of Stade as a county in its own right, and became an object of contention, following the death of Count Rudolph II, between Archbishop Hartwig I of Bremen and Henry the Lion, who initially prevailed. After the disagreement of the Welf duke with Frederick Barbarossa and his deposition by the Emperor, the Emperor granted the ducal rights for eastern Saxony to the Ascanians. In Henry's time, the Archbishop of Bremen was allied to Hartwig II. After the death of Henry the Lion's son, Henry V, the County of Stade returned to the Archbishopric. The self-government of Hadeln, under Schulthei√üen and Sch√∂ffen, had become stronger and accepted the Ascanian, Duke Bernard III as ruler in 1210/11. After that, the state of Hadeln formed a largely independent farmers' republic under the loose overlordship of the dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg. With each change of ruler, the people of Hadeln had their liberties and privileges reaffirmed at the Warningsacker (a legal meeting place) between Otterndorf and Altenbruch. By contrast with the neighbouring state of Wursten, the abbey of Neuenwalde and local aristocratic families were also able to own land within the state, without gaining any major political influence over it. After Schloss Ritzeb√ºttel had changed hands from the Lappe family to Hamburg in 1393, the influence of the Hanseatic city began to take hold with the foundation of the district of Amt Ritzeb√ºttel. (today Cuxhaven) in 1394 in the land of Hadeln. In Otterndorf, which had been granted its town charter in 1400 and where a Latin school was established early on, the citizens of Hamburg helped rebuild the castle, which had previously been destroyed by the Archbishop of Bremen, and from 1407 to 1481 the land was even a fief of Hamburg. However, when the Hamburgers tried to monopolise wheat exports, a rebellion broke out in 1456. After the conflict ended in a stalemate, a lasting compromise was finally reached between the powers of the lordly Amtmann or count in Otterndorf and the otherwise independent authorities of the Hadler estates (Hadler St√§nde).

The cemetery is the largest war cemetery in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and one of the largest in Germany.Volksbund.de  History  The Golm is the highest lying land on the island of Usedom (69 m) and was a popular tourist destination prior to World War II. The cemetery was created in 1944, initially for soldiers of the nearby garrisons of Swinem√ºnde (≈öwinouj≈õcie) and the Garz air base. About 250 members of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, the crew of a sunken U-boat and at least 1,000 Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe soldiers are buried here.Youth Meeting Center Golm Youth Meeting Center Golm  Air Raid  In early 1945, Swinem√ºnde was the destination port for refugees from East Prussia under Operation Hannibal. On the eastern shore of the Swine river (≈öwina) refugees from Farther Pomerania waited for a chance to ferry across the watercourse as they fled the advancing Red Army.the467tharchive.org At around noon on 12 March 1945, 671 bombers of the US Eighth Air Force carrying 1,456 tons of bombs raided the town. Due to uncertainty concerning the number of refugees within the town the exact number of casualties is unknown. As the capacity of air raid shelters was limited to the regular populace, many refugees were killed at the spa gardens. The motor vessel Andros (2,995 GRT), carrying about 2,000 refugees, had just arrived at the harbour and was sunk with the loss of about 570 people. Das geplante Inferno Der Spiegel 1 April 2003 The motor vessels Cordillera (12,055 GRT), Tolina (2,000 GRT), Heiligenhafen (1,923 GRT), Ravensberg (1,069 GRT) Hilde (491 GRT) and Jasmund (276 GRT) were also sunk. About 500 victims of the raid were identified and buried close to the entrance of the cemetery and the remaining dead were buried in mass graves. The estimated number of victims varies from about 5,000 to 23,000. Recent research places the number at around 10,000.The 2011 Golm Book (Der Golm und die Trag√∂die von Swinem√ºnde)  Postwar  View from Mt. Golm towards Swinem√ºnde Golm lay directly on the newly created Oder-Neisse line that marked the new border between Germany and Poland. Following the war, most refugees continued to move to the west and the local German populace was expelled. The cemetery attracted only slight attention and the area had almost turned into a forest again. In the 1950s the Pomeranian Evangelical Church began caring for the site. However a large wooden cross placed there in 1954 was immediately destroyed and East German authorities forbade the erection of Robert Leptien‚Äôs sculpture \\"Freezing Woman\\" (1952) because it did not match the artistic perceptions of the communist party line. In the late 1960s the local administration rearranged the cemetery and removed any Christian symbols and individual headstones. An official memorial site was established in 1975, the main memorial bears the inscription That never again a mother mourns her son., a line from the East German national anthem Auferstanden aus Ruinen by Johannes R. Becher. While Leptien had moved to West Berlin his sculpture remained at his former garden and was finally erected at the cemetery without an official permission in 1984. After the Reunification of Germany the German War Graves Commission took over the care of the cemetery and opened an International Youth Meeting Center in 2005 with the purpose of strengthening and cultivating democracy in Europe.International Youth Meeting Center File:2009-08-06-golm-by-RalfR-11.jpg File:2009-08-06-golm-by-RalfR-26.jpg File:2009-08-06-golm-by-RalfR-05.jpg File:Usedom 09 (RaBoe).jpg  References External links Category:German War Graves Commission Category:Protected areas of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Category:Cemeteries in Germany Category:World War II cemeteries in Germany Category:Tourist attractions in Mecklenburg- Vorpommern Category:Nature reserves in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ","title":"Golm War Cemetery"},{"id":"26636878","text":"Shine is the fourth studio album by hard rock band Shaman's Harvest.

History There are several important archaeological sites on the common, including Bronze Age tumuli. In 793 AD land at Stanmore was given by the King of Mercia to St Albans Abbey, which held it until the Norman Conquest. Following an Enclosure Act in 1813 much of the land was lost to private ownership, but about 120 acres of Stanmore Common remained common land, held by Harrow Urban District Council. Ecology The common is woodland and heathland, with two artificially created ponds. Most of the woodland is secondary as the ancient woods were long ago cleared for grazing, apart from a seven hectare area of older woodland at The Grove. The Common has many rare plant species, including the only heath spotted-orchids in London. Birds include the declining spotted flycatcher and bullfinch. There are also rare insects, and mammals include muntjac deer, woodmice, bank and field voles and shrews. Access There is a car park on Warren Lane, and access also from The Common.

Section 1986.1 of the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) supplements these principal shield law provisions by providing additional safeguards to a reporter whose records are being subpoenaed.  Provisions  The statutory and constitutional provisions provide virtually identical protections against contempt citations for journalists who refuse to disclose the identity of their sources or unpublished information acquired or prepared in the scope of their employment.Cal. Const. art. 1, ¬ß 2(b). Journalists covered by the shield law include not only newspaper reporters, but also those who work in other forms of press media including magazines, television, and radio. Cal. Const. art. 1, ¬ß 2(b). Unpublished information is defined as \\"information not disseminated to the public by the person from whom disclosure is sought, whether or not related information has been disseminated and includes, but is not limited to, all notes, outtakes, photographs, tapes or other data of whatever sort not itself disseminated to the public through a medium of communication, whether or not published information based upon or related to such material has been disseminated.\\" Cal. Const. art. 1, ¬ß 2(b). Section 1986.1 adds to the existing shield law framework by explaining that a journalist who testifies or provides other evidence in a civil or criminal proceeding does not waive the rights guaranteed by Article 1, section 2(b) of the California Constitution. The law also mandates the following requirements on the part of the party issuing the subpoena: * Provide at least five days‚Äô notice to a journalist who is being subpoenaed in any civil or criminal proceeding. * Provide notice to the journalist and the journalist's employer of a subpoena issued to a third party who is in possession of the journalist's confidential information at least five days prior to issuing the subpoena. Id.  Legislative History  California passed its first shield law in 1935, where it was codified in section 1881(6) of the CCP. In its original iteration, the shield law protections only applied to newspaper publishers, editors, and reporters who refused to reveal their sources. Id. The law's scope was extended in 1961 with an amendment to include radio, television station, press associations, and wire services employees. Id. In 1965, the shield law provisions were moved to section 1070 of the Evidence Code. Id. Section 1070 has been amended three times in 1971, 1972, and 1974. Id. at 179. One of the more consequential amendments was in 1974, when the statute was revised to also cover the disclosure of unpublished information in addition to sources. Id. at 179-80.  Proposition 5  On June 3, 1980, California voters approved the passage of Proposition 5, which incorporated the language of the existing shield law provision into the state constitution. The impetus for this constitutional amendment stemmed from concerns about how the shield law was being applied in practice, particularly in light of court opinions concluding that the provisions were incompatible under both the state and federal Constitution. Id.  AB 1860  Section 1986.1 of the CCP was introduced by Assembly member Carole Migden as AB 1860 during the 1999-2000 legislative session. According to Assembly member Migden, the intent of the bill was to clarify the existing statutory and constitutional safeguards guaranteed to journalists under the shield law. The bill was enrolled on August 29, 2000 and approved by the Governor on September 8, 2000.  SB 558  During the 2013-2014 legislative session, state senator Ted Lieu introduced SB 558 to amend section 1986.1 of the CCP. Among the amendments made include the addition of subsection b(2), which mandated that in the case of a third party subpoena notice must be given to the journalist and the publisher at least five days prior to issuing the subpoena. According to senator Lieu, his intent was to ensure that parties could not take advantage of gaps or loopholes in the existing law to undermine journalists' rights. He also noted as a cautionary tale the 2013 scandal involving the United States Department of Justice secretly obtaining the records of the Associated Press without the organization's knowledge. Id. SB 558 was enrolled on September 10, 2013 and was approved by the Governor on October 3, 2013.  Notable Cases =Delaney v. Superior Court The California Supreme Court held that the shield law's protection of unpublished information included reporters‚Äô unpublished, nonconfidential eyewitness observations in a public place. Delaney v. Superior Court, 50 Cal.3d 785, 805 (1990). However, the court went on to explain that the shield law immunity cannot be sustained if refusal to disclose information that is likely to be helpful to a criminal defendant would unduly infringe on that defendant's federal constitutional right to a fair trial. Id. at 814. Apple v. Does (O‚ÄôGrady v. Superior Court) Apple issued civil subpoenas to the publishers of online news sites that had published leaked information concerning Apple's secret plans for its new product. O'Grady v. Superior Court, 139 Cal.App.4th 1423, 1431 (6th Dist. 2006). Here, the court concluded that the shield law protections did not differentiate between newsgathering for print or online media, thereby holding that the online publishers could not be held in contempt for refusing to divulge the identity of the sources who provided them with confidential information.

It is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. Description It grows as an erect shrub to 4 m (13 ft) in height, with hairy branches and long, narrow leaves up to 80 mm length and about 5 mm wide. The flowers, which appear between August and November, consist of a tubular perianth about 25 mm long, and a style about 40 mm long. The perianth is yellow with an orange throat that becomes brown following pollination. Taxonomy The type specimen of A. detmoldii was collected from the vicinity of the Blackwood River around 1870, and sent to Ferdinand von Mueller who published the species in Volume 8 of his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae in 1874. The original type specimen cites \\"Blackwood-River; J. Forrest\\", and this has sometimes been interpreted as referring to John Forrest, but John Forrest's brother James is known to have \\"achieved some repute by making botanical collections of the flora of the Blackwood district for Baron von Mueller\\", and an isotype lodged at the Botanical Garden in Berlin has been labelled by Ludwig Diels \\"Blackwood River leg. Jas. Forrest\\". Mueller assigned the species to A. sect. Eurylaema, defined as containing those species with perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle. The specific epithet detmoldii was said to be in honour of his friend William Detmold. A. detmoldii was retained in A. sect. Eurylaema in Ernest Charles Nelson's 1978 revision of Adenanthos, and again in his 1995 treatment of the genus for the Flora of Australia series. The placement of A. cuneatus in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema :::A. detmoldii :::A. barbiger :::A. obovatus :::A. √ó pamela ::A. sect. Adenanthos (29 species, 8 subspecies) This species frequently hybridises with Adenanthos obovatus; the resulting hybrids are known as Adenanthos √ó pamela. Distribution and habitat A. detmoldii is restricted to the vicinity of the Scott and Blackwood Rivers east of Augusta, Western Australia. Unusually for Adenanthos species, it favours damp winter-wet, sandy flats, where it co-occurs with Banksia ser. Dryandra species, Grevillea species, grasses and sedges. It is often the most abundant shrub where it occurs. Conservation It is classified as Priority Four - Rare on the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation's Declared Rare and Priority Flora List. That is, it is a taxon which, though rare, does not appear to be threatened. It is said to be now largely confined to road verges because most of its range has been cleared for agriculture, though in 1978 Nelson still held out some hope that \\"[i]t may be common in wet swamp areas that are not accessible and have not been drained.\\" It is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. Cultivation The species prefers well-drained, light soils in full sun to part shade, though, as its natural occurrence in winter-wet areas would suggest, it is hardier to poor drainage than most Adenanthos species. Naturally a dry-summer plant, it performs unexpectedly well in areas with wet or humid summers, though it is vulnerable to grey mould in such climates. Propagation is by cuttings of semi-mature growth.

It appeared in the British Railways Working Timetable very briefly in the Autumn changes in 1993 being withdrawn from them at the following change (Spring 1994). The plan was to build a small station at the point where the Sheffield Victoria to Worksop line passed beneath the Swallownest to Beighton road (Chesterfield Road) on the south side to the villages, approximately one mile west of the site of the old Waleswood Station which closed in 1955. As part of the plan to increase rail usage in the area and with the expansion of Swallownest towards the line this was considered the best location for a station which could then be incorporated into the timetable. On the original maps provided with the transport plan the station was situated east of the road bridge to enable a chord line to be built from the Midland Railway \\"old road\\", south of Treeton to the Great Central line, diverting trains via Brightside Junction and the Sheffield District Railway to reach this point before using the chord to return to the Great Central. This plan also involved the reopening of West Tinsley as Meadowhall (Tivoli Gardens), the name coming from the Leisure park planned for the adjacent site, never built. This would also involve the closure of Darnall and Woodhouse. Because of South Yorkshire PTE's policy of developing railways and not closing stations this was revised and it was decided to retain the line and service as it was, the Sheffield District line from Brightside Junction being closed and eventually lifted as far as Shepcote Lane Junction at the north end of Tinsley Yard. Although the station appeared in the working timetable it never appeared in the public timetable or on other station timetables in the area. This showed all trains, in both directions, stopping. However, as the station was not built, it was withdrawn from the timetable at the following Spring changes.

The Protestant church of Jistrum or Saint Peter's churchAlle middeleeuwse kerken: van Harlingen tot Wilhelmshaven, P Karstkarel, p. 163 is a medieval religious building in Jistrum, Friesland, Netherlands. It is a well preserved and complete 13th century Romanesque church built of red brick, located in the center of the village on Schoolstraat 2. The church is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 35645. History The Romanesque church was built in the 13th century, the tower is a little older and dates from c. 1230. The church was once a Roman Catholic church dedicated to Saint Peter but was stripped of the Saints statues and painted/decorated walls in one week in 1581 during the Protestant Reformation and became a Protestant church. Interior and exterior The nave and the semicircular choir date from the 13th century, while the tower dates from around 1230. The church has a gabled roof. On the corners of the nave is a buttress in brickwork, the outer walls are on the upper side decorated with so called keper friezen. The north wall has two Romanesque windows located in the higher zone of the wall, and the lower zone has two closed entrances with brick. The southern wall shows a similar layout but has two large lancet windows build in it, with one small Romanesque window at the tower side. The choir has five regular placed Romanesque windows and the nave is covered with a Romanesque-Gothic domevault. In each bay eight ribs come together in a ring. In the west bay the ribs are squire shaped. During a renovation two hagioscopes were discovered and restored. These windows are also known as leprozenruitjes (windows for people with leprosy). The wooden pulpit from the third quarter of the 17th century is located against the north wall where the choir and bay meet. Most of the Frisian churches have a golden rooster as weather vane, but on the 20.5 meters high tower of the church a horse is seen. The golden rooster is a symbol of Jesus Christ who breaks the power of the darkness, forgives sins and calls for a new day. The tower had also a rooster in the past, but it was blown of by the wind and could not be repaired. It was then replaced by a horse because it was cheaper. Apparently the price was more important than the symbolic value. The original bell in the tower from 1759 was stolen by the Germans during World War II, the current bell dateing from 1949. In 2007, the renovation of the church started and the monumental Pipe organ from the other church in town was installed.

This enables the studies of dynamical changes that occur in for example enzymes during their catalysis. The time dimension is incorporated by triggering the reaction of interest in the crystal prior to X-ray exposure, and then collecting the diffraction patterns at different time delays. In order to study these dynamical properties of macromolecules three criteria must be met; * The macromolecule must be biologically active in the crystalline state * It must be possible to trigger the reaction in the crystal * The intermediate of interest must be detectable, i.e. it must have a reasonable amount of concentration in the crystal (preferably over 25%). This has led to the development of several techniques that can be divided into two groups, the pump-probe method and diffusion-trapping methods.  Pump-probe In the pump- probe method the reaction is first triggered (pump) by photolysis (most often laser light) and then a diffraction pattern is collected by an X-ray pulse (probe) at a specific time delay. This makes it possible to obtain many images at different time delays after reaction triggering, and thereby building up a chronological series of images describing the events during reaction. To obtain a reasonable signal to noise ratio this pump-probe cycle has to be performed many times for each spatial rotation of the crystal, and many times for the same time delay. Therefore, the reaction that one wishes to study with pump-probe must be able to relax back to its original conformation after triggering, enabling many measurements on the same sample. The time resolution of the observed phenomena is dictated by the time width of the probing pulse (full width at half maximum). All processes that happen on a faster time scale than that are going to be averaged out by the convolution of the probe pulse intensity in time with the intensity of the actual x-ray reflectivity of the sample.  Diffusion-trapping Diffusion-trapping methods utilizes diffusion techniques to get the substrates into the crystal and thereafter different trapping techniques are applied to get the intermediate of interest to accumulate in the crystal prior to collection of the diffraction pattern. These trapping methods could involve changes in pH, use of inhibitor or lowering the temperature in order to slow down the turnover rate or maybe even stop the reaction completely at a specific step. Just starting the reaction and then flash-freeze it, thereby quenching it at a specific time step, is also a possible method. One drawback with diffusion-trapping methods is that they can only be used to study intermediates that can be trapped, thereby limiting the time resolution one can obtain through the methods as compared to the pump-probe method.

It was founded in the 11th century and was in the possession of Lewes Priory by 1090. The present structure dates from the mid-13th century but was extended in the 14th century and heavily altered and restored during the Victorian period, with much interior work by Charles Eamer Kempe and stained glass by both Kempe and the Clayton and Bell firm. The church's spire was replaced in 1981 following a fire. Former chapels of ease in outlying hamlets have closed, and the church now serves a large rural area in the centre of Sussex. It is protected as a Grade I listed building. History From his base at the episcopal see of Selsey, which he founded, the 7th-century bishop Wilfrid converted many of the pagan inhabitants of the Kingdom of the South Saxons (present-day Sussex) to Christianity. Primitive wooden or wattle and daub churches were built throughout the kingdom, especially in forest clearings. The village of Cuckfield is thought to have been founded at one such clearing in the dense forest of Andredesweald, which covered much of the north of Sussex; so a church may have existed in the village from about the 8th century, when Wilfrid's mission penetrated that part of the kingdom. A church was not recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. The first documented evidence for a settlement and church at Cuckfield came c.1090, when the church was in the possession of Lewes Priory, England's first Cluniac house. The reported date of this record varies, but William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey is consistently recording as holding the church. He died in 1088, so dates of 1090, 1091 or 1092 reported in some sources may not be correct. The influence of de Warenne and his wife Gundred on the Cuckfield area extended beyond passive ownership: having founded Lewes Priory, they built and lived in Lewes Castle and established a hunting lodge on land at Cuckfield. They may also have built the church itself, rather than merely taking possession of it on behalf of their priory. (Cuckfield is about northwest of Lewes, and was in the Rape of Lewes: one of the six pre-Norman subdivisions of Sussex.) The exact date of the church's founding is not known: although it was not recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, details of churches were only recorded haphazardly in that survey, and many pre-1086 churches in Sussex are missing from it. In 1091, de Warenne's son William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey reaffirmed the grant of the church, the buildings in the village and all its tithes to the priory. A copy of this charter is held in the British Museum in London. Records of further confirmation of this arrangement survive from the 1120s (from Ralph de Luffa, Bishop of Chichester ) and the end of the 12th century (by Hamelin de Warenne, Earl of Surrey). The Norman-era building, which had existed in the late 11th century, was probably a simple two-cell structure with nave and chancel. It was rebuilt in about 1250, when the Bishop of Chichester Richard de la Wych (later canonised) made an agreement with Lewes Priory to endow a vicarage and improve the church. At that stage, the priory controlled 39 churches in Sussex. He appointed his chaplain Walter de Warnecamp as the church's first parish priest, and put him in charge of the enlargement. The south wall of the Norman chapel was demolished and a three-bay aisle was built in its place, reached through three archways with round columns. The tower at the west end was also started, although it may have reached its full height only in the mid-14th century. The chancel may have been reconfigured as well. The heavily buttressed tower and broach spire The church had acquired its much of its present structural form by about 1340 after a decade of rebuilding and enlargement. Another bay was added at the east end of the nave; arcaded chapels were added to the north and south of the chancel and aligned with the walls of the nave aisles; the height of the nave was increased by the addition of a clerestory below the roofline; and the tower was extended to its present height with a belfry. The south aisle of the nave was extended to four bays to match the newly enlarged nave, and another was added on the north side for balance. This was supported on hexagonal piers. Several windows with flat headers and ogee-arched lights also date from this era, and the slim, tall spire is believed to be contemporary as well. It is slightly recessed within the castellated parapet of the tower, and is of the broach spire type. The external roofline was changed in the late 15th century: the walls of the aisles were built up, and the roof was brought down in a single sweep from the ridge to the eaves. This work, which had the effect of blocking the quatrefoil windows in the clerestory, was done in conjunction with the installation of a wagon vault ceiling with tie-beams and spandrels. This substantial oak roof has carved bosses and elaborate moulding on its beams. Further enlargement came in the following century, reflecting Cuckfield's steadily increasing prosperity: a chapel was added at the northeast corner for the use of the locally important Sergison family. The English Reformation of the 16th century, through which Protestantism became established and Catholic-style worship and practices were banished, affected Holy Trinity Church in the same ways as other churches: statues, icons and paintings were removed or destroyed, the internal layout was simplified, Holy Communion rituals were altered, English was used instead of Latin, and objects ranging from hymn-books to the altar had to be stripped out and destroyed in public‚Äîoften by being burnt. Inventories had to be provided to prove this had been done, and a surviving document produced by Cuckfield's churchwarden in 1620 shows that hardly any objects were then used during services. More disruption came during the English Civil War starting in 1641: Rev. Dr James Marsh, appointed vicar of Cuckfield in 1638, had Royalist sympathies and became one of the thousands of clergymen who were removed from their parishes and had their possessions sequestered. He was sent to prison three times during the war. Although central Sussex escaped the worst of the fighting, Parliamentarians are known to have damaged the church: soldiers broke the stoups, and a large crack in the 13th-century font was reputedly caused by a kick from one of their horses stabled inside the church. The Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 ended this turbulent period, and more structural work was soon carried out on the church: the spire was shingled and a clock was installed in the tower in 1667. Some minor work had also been carried out in the 1630s: altar rails were installed in 1637, the building was painted, a gallery was added inside and the vicar hung the church's first ring of bells. The weight of the roof necessitated external buttressing of the south aisle at this time as well. The church's present eight bells were cast by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1815. St Mark's Church, Staplefield‚Äîformerly part of Holy Trinity's parish St Wilfrid's Church, Haywards Heath‚Äîformerly part of Holy Trinity's parish In the 19th century, Cuckfield parish was split, with two new parishes created: in 1848, a year after Benjamin Ferrey built St Mark's Church at Staplefield (paid for by the vicar and parishioners of Holy Trinity Church), it was given its own parish to serve the village, and in 1865 Haywards Heath was given its own ecclesiastical parish based at George Frederick Bodley's St Wilfrid's Church, completed that year. The rapidly growing town only came into existence after Cuckfield villagers and the church authorities refused to allow the London to Brighton railway line to be built through the village: its planned alignment took it past the east side of the churchyard, but the London and Brighton Railway company moved it to the east across the unpopulated heathland after which residents gave their approval. The most wide-ranging structural changes in the building's history took place in the mid-19th century. These were planned by Rev. Thomas Astley Maberly, incumbent for 36 years from 1841, and his curate (and successor as vicar) James Cooper, who joined the parish in 1855. Cooper was a former member of the Ecclesiastical and Architectural Society. In 1839, an unnamed parishioner donated a barrel organ to the church, but its range of music was deemed inadequate. The same parishioner presented a new organ in 1842, which was well received by all and immediately changed the character of worship at the church, which had previously relied on a choir for musical accompaniment. The old font was also restored and repositioned in the church, apparently after being discovered in pieces in the belfry by the vicar. In 1846, a baptistery was formed in one end of the south aisle, some of the windows were reglazed (some with stained glass), a tiled floor was laid and new oak pews were installed. In 1855, Rev. Maberly commissioned George Frederick Bodley to renovate the church. The comprehensive reconfiguration and rebuilding carried out by him and his pupil Charles Eamer Kempe has given the building a largely Victorian appearance. Changes were made in all parts of the church: Bodley installed marble steps and railings in the chancel, raised the floor height in the chancel, installed a new reredos of alabaster (no longer in place), changed the 17th-century triple-deck timber pulpit for a new, smaller version of stone and wood, put in new choir stalls, removed the galleries, opened out one of the arcades in the south aisle which had been partitioned previously, renewed all the floors, lowered the floor in the tower to bring it in line with the rest of the church, re-roofed the south aisle and installed three new windows and removed a chandelier, which was donated to a church in Oxford. More work took place in 1862‚Äì63: the vestry was removed from the east end of the south aisle and a Lady chapel took its place; in 1888 the former Sergison chapel was converted into a new vestry. The large east window, designed in 1330 in the Perpendicular style, was replaced by a shorter replica. Charles Eamer Kempe's association with the church began in 1865, when Bodley commissioned him to paint the wagon vault ceiling, which was still in its unadorned 15th-century state. His work, mostly floral designs in pale colours, is considered to be excellent and well-suited to the shape of the roof. He also designed and installed several stained glass windows between 1875 and 1887, for example in the north aisle and west wall, and rebuilt the south porch in 1883 using most of the original stonework. Five years earlier, one had been added on the north side by Richard Herbert Carpenter. In the 1870s, the belfry was repanelled and given a new ceiling, the 25,000 shingles on the spire were replaced, a new staircase was built into the belfry and a new clock was installed. The clock of 1667 was saved and installed on the inside wall of the tower. A war memorial was built in the churchyard and dedicated in 1921. During this work, a 13th-century coin was found in the ground; it was minted at the time the church was being built, and may have been dropped then. A memorial tablet of white marble, listing the names of all Cuckfield residents killed in the First World War, was installed inside the church in 1922. In the same year, repairs were found to be needed to several parts of the building and its fixtures; the Diocese of Chichester provided funds to supplement the offertory, and work started immediately. Repairs to the roof led to the uncovering of the blocked clerestory windows and two others in the chancel, although they were bricked up again in 1933. The tower was being undermined by ivy growth, and its stonework was repaired in 1925. Problems afflicted the spire and tower throughout the 20th century. A fire at Easter 1917 was quickly dealt with, but another caused by a lightning strike in July 1945 caused major damage, especially to the bells and the woodwork inside. Six of the eight bells were disabled for 14 months. In 1972, the shingles on the spire were found to need replacement again, and a death watch beetle infestation was found. The weather vane was also found to be dangerous and had to be removed temporarily. Repairs were carried out, but on 1 May 1980 another fire broke out; it was so severe that the spire toppled from the tower after just 15 minutes. A replica was made in two parts at Littlehampton and reassembled on top of the tower in February 1981; the only change, insisted on by the church's insurers, was the insertion of larger louvres to provide easier access from the top of the tower to the spire. Architecture Holy Trinity Church is Gothic in style, combining elements of the Early English and Decorated styles. The plan consists of a chancel with chapels to the north and south, a four-bay nave with aisles to the north and south and porches on each side (approximately level with the second bay from the west end), a west tower with a staircase on the south side, and a vestry (the former Sergison chapel) attached to the north chapel. It is built entirely of Sussex sandstone, some of which may have been quarried in Cuckfield itself. The roofs are covered with slabs of Horsham stone. The former Sergison chapel has external chamfering and ashlar dressings to its walls. Most of the windows have stained glass, by either Charles Eamer Kempe or the Clayton and Bell firm. The latter was active throughout Sussex in the late 19th century, and its work features in many churches. A Kempe window, featuring Michael the Archangel, was installed in the west wall of the tower in 1875; he added a Jesse window in the north aisle in 1887 and another, known as ‚ÄòThe Redemption‚Äô next to it in 1889. At least four windows in the church have been attributed to him. Clayton and Bell's work, dated 1869 and 1879, is in the south aisle as well as similar dated Clayton and Bell windows in the north aisle. Churchyard Southward view across the churchyard The churchyard has far-reaching southward views to the South Downs. There are many 17th- and 18th-century gravestones, 22 of which are individually protected with Grade II listing. Elsewhere, a rare 19th-century wooden grave marker has been restored to its original condition. An extremely tall, old tree is a dominant feature. The churchyard is entered through two lychgates, both of which are also Grade II listed. One was designed by Charles Eamer Kempe in either 1887 or 1893; the structure is entirely of timber, supporting a \\"pagoda-shaped\\" of Horsham stone tiles topped with an iron cross. There are two arches of unequal width, the wider of which is gated. The gate is dedicated to a parishioner, Caroline Emily Maberley. The other was added in 1911 and stands on a base of sandstone. The roof is laid with Horsham stone tiles. The walls alongside the gate, of sandstone ashlar, are included in the listing. The gate also bears a dedication to a parishioner, Laura Maria Bevan, the wife of Richard Alexander Bevan (\\"the father of Cuckfield\\"). The existence of a pair of lychgates at a churchyard is rare. Enlargement took place in 1855 to accommodate burials from the growing railway town of Haywards Heath, which at that time was still in Holy Trinity's parish. By this time, the churchyard had become a cemetery and was no longer run by the church authorities. More land was acquired for expansion in the 20th century. Vicarage The former vicarage The old vicarage, which had been rebuilt in Georgian style in the 1780s, was found to be in poor condition in 1926. Several surrounding farm buildings and a tithe barn were demolished and the vicarage itself was sold in 1937. The vicar lived in a Victorian house near the church until 1945, when another house was bought nearby. This in turn fell into disrepair by 1961, but money was raised for repairs. The old vicarage is now a Grade II listed building. Originally built in the early 17th century, it was comprehensively redesigned and rebuilt between October 1780 and September 1781. Alterations were made in the 19th century. The stuccoed fa√ßade has five bays, each with an evenly spaced sash window topped by an architrave with decorative moulding. The door is set below a pediment and fanlight which is obscured by a hood-moulded porch projecting forwards over the steps. The southeast-facing side has a tall 19th-century bow window. Another wing was added to the north in the mid-19th century at the request of Rev. Maberley. The church today St John's Chapel at Ansty All Saints at Brook Street Holy Trinity Church was designated a Grade I listed building on 10 September 1951. The church, standing on the south edge of Cuckfield off the High Street and with long views across the Weald, is \\"the focal point of the village\\", despite the site being the lowest land in the area ( above sea level). The parish covers a mostly rural area in Mid Sussex. The only settlements are Cuckfield itself and the nearby hamlets of Ansty and Brook Street. Both formerly had chapels of ease of their own. The chapel at Brook Street was dedicated to All Saints and was served by Holy Trinity's curates and their assistants. It was opened in 1879 by the vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Rev. Francis Mount. Services continued to be held there until November 1968, by which time the structure had become unsafe and congregations were declining. The building now houses a picture-framing shop. At Ansty, also in 1879, Rev. Mount opened a tin tabernacle. This was enlarged with a proper chancel in 1883, and on 10 December 1909 it reopened in a new, brick-built form as St John's Chapel after being rebuilt and rededicated as a memorial to a local resident. Thoughts of closing the church first arose in 1998, when finding enough clergy and laypeople to run it effectively started to become very difficult, and in January 1999 the proposal was put to worshipers and local residents. Combining its spiritual functions with those of a community centre were considered, but the outcome was the closure and sale of the chapel. The last service took place at Christmas 2000, and the building was converted into a house. Holy Trinity continues to provide a wide range of services.

With the treaty, the non-Danish and non-Swedish part of Livonia, with the exception of the Free imperial city of Riga, subjected itself to Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sigismund II Augustus with the Pacta subiectionis (Provisio ducalis). In turn, Sigismund granted protection from the Tsardom of Russia and confirmed the Livonian estates' traditional privileges, laid out in the Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti. The secularization of the Livonian Order was the \\"final act\\"Frost (2000), p. 5 in Livonia's transition from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern era. The territories were re-organized in the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and the Duchy of Livonia, the latter competing with the Kingdom of Livonia during the war. After its reconquest, Sigismund's successor Stephen B√°thory (Batory) ignored the privileges of 1561, granted a new constitution and initiated counter- reformation. These measures were reversed after the Swedish conquest. When after a further series of wars Livonia capitulated to Russia in 1710, the Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti was confirmed by Peter the Great. Background In 1513, the Grand Master of the Livonian Order bought his order out of the union with the Teutonic Knights.Roberts (1986), p. 157 Thus, the secularization of the Teutonic Order State, which led to the establishment of the Protestant Duchy of Prussia under the Polish king in 1525, did not affect Livonia, where the Recess of Wolmar (Valmiera) forbade any future secularization in 1546. The Protestant Reformation had started in Riga in 1517, and afterward it had spread to all of Livonia; religious freedom was declared in 1554.Grudulis (1998), pp. 128-129 Livonian Confederation As the Livonian Confederation was in decline due to internal struggles, a faction of the order favored rapprochement with Poland-Lithuania, while another faction violently opposed it. After a civil war starting in 1556, the pro-Polish faction gained the upper hand. With the Treaty of Pozvol, concluded in 1557, the Livonian Confederation had turned to Poland-Lithuania for protection, triggering Ivan IV of Russia's intervention in what was to become the Livonian War.De Madariaga (2006), p. 127 In 1558, Ivan IV had conquered the Dorpat (Tartu) area, annihilating the Bishopric of Dorpat.Steinke (2009), p. 119 With the Treaty of Vilnius of 31 August 1559, Gotthard von Kettler, Grand Master of the Livonian Order, had put the order's lands under protection of Polish king and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sigismund II Augustus. The order ceded about one seventh of its territory, allowed Sigismund to garrison its most important castles, and agreed to share with him any conquests made from Ivan IV.Roberts (1986), p. 162 The alliance was intended to neutralize the imminent threat of annexation of the order's lands by Russia, yet despite earning military support from Polish-Lithuanian chancellor Miko≈Çaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Kettler was defeated in Ergeme (Ermes, 1560) and unable to prevent the occupation of most of Livonia by Russian forces. After the treaty, the disintegrating order agreed to secularization if necessary, and since Sigismund was reluctant to support it militarily, continued its search for a protector at the courts of Denmark-Norway and the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1560, Johann von M√ºnchhausen sold his bishoprics of √ñsel-Wiek and Courland to Magnus, brother of Danish king Frederick II. In June 1561, part of Estonia subordinated itself to Sweden. Riga had turned to the Holy Roman Empire and became a Free imperial city.Rabe (1989), p. 308 Hard-pressed by Ivan IV of Russia, the remnant of the Livonian Confederation concluded a treaty with Poland-Lithuania on 28 November 1561, subordinating themselves to the Sigismund II Augustus.De Madariaga (2006), pp. 129-130; Sahanowitsch (2001), pp. 93-94 Treaty The treaty comprised the Pacta subiectionis by which the Livonian estates accepted Polish-Lithuanian superiority.Tuchtenhagen (2005), p. 36 This document is also known as Provisio ducalis.Dyba≈õ (2006), p. 109 Also included was the Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti by which Sigismund II Augustus guaranteed the Livonian estates several privileges, including religious freedom with respect to the Augsburg Confession, the Indigenat (), and continuation of the traditional German jurisdiction and administration. The terms regarding religious freedom forbade any regulation of the traditional Protestant order by religious or secular authorities, and ruled that cases of disagreements be judged only by Protestant scholars.Kahle (1984), p. 17 The Livonian regions south of the Daugava River (D√ºna, Dvina), comprising Courland (Kurland) and Semigallia (Semgallen, Zemgale, ≈Ωiemgala), were established as the secular Duchy of Courland and Semigallia with Gotthard von Kettler as its duke.B√ºlow (2003), p. 75 Shaped after the Prussian model, Courland and Semigallia was thus made a hereditary fief of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, later of the Polish Crown. In contrast, Livonia north of the Daugava was subordinated directly to Sigismund II Augustus as Duchy of Livonia, also referred to as Livonia transdunensis, with Kettler installed as Sigismund's \\"Royal administrator\\". These territories however excluded Riga, then a Free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire, part of Estonia with Reval (Tallinn), which was under Swedish protection, and the westernmost part of Estonia with √òsel (√ñsel, Saaremaa), which was Danish. Consequences In the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a stable political system was established on the basis of the 1561 treaty, and only in 1617 this was modified by the Formula regiminis and Statuta Curlandi√¶, which granted the indigenous nobles additional rights at the duke's expense.Dyba≈õ (2006), p. 110 The situation north of the Daugava was quite different. On 25 December 1566, the Union of Grodno established a real union between the Duchy of Livonia the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Livonia's administrative division was re-organized with its castellans becoming members of the Lithuanian senate. The union however did not impact Livonian jurisdiction, which was to be carried out according to the traditional customs.Steinke (2009), p. 121 When in 1569 the Union of Lublin transformed the Polish-Lithuanian personal union into a real union, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Livonia became a Polish-Lithuanian condominium. Ivan IV of Russia subdued nearly all of Livonia transdunanesis between 1572 and 1577. Magnus, in addition to his Livonian possessions, bought the succession in the Bishopric of Reval and established the Kingdom of Livonia under Ivan IV's patronage. After the Polish-Swedish victory in the Battle of Wenden (1578), Russian forces were subsequently expelled from Livonia, and the Livonian War ended with the treaties of Jam Zapolski and Narva-Plyussa. Only then, Sigismund's successor Stephen B√°thory (Batory) was able to re-assume control over the Duchy of Livonia. Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth superimposed on modern borders, Duchy of Livonia shown in dark grey, Duchy of Courland and Semigallia in light grey, Grand Duchy of Lithuania in purple, Swedish Estonia and Danish √òsel in green. B√°thory however regarded the re-conquered territories as his war booty, refused to confirm the Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti, and in 1582 replaced it with the Constitutiones Livoniae, which tolerated Indigenat and Augsburg Confession, but revoked their status as elementary right and else did not contain any privileges. The traditional German administration and jurisdiction was gradually impaired by the establishment of voivodeships, the appointment of Royal officials, and the replacement of German with Polish as administrative language. Riga was added to Polish-Lithuanian Livonia by the Treaty of Drohiczyn of 14 January 1581, including a Corpus Privilegiorum Stephanorum similarly reducing its freedoms.Tuchtenhagen (2005), p. 37 Under Stephen B√°thory, the Duchy of Livonia was subjected to counter-reformation led by bishop Otto von Schenking, who had converted to Catholicism, and the Jesuits of Riga and Dorpat (Tartu). The respective Jesuit colleges and the Catholic bishopric with its see in Wenden (Cƒìsis) were founded in 1566. Counter- reformation focussed on the Latvian and Estonian population, since they were not explicitly mentioned in the Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti - a disputed interpretation since the German Livonian estates traditionally spoke for all Livonians. Lutherans were forbidden to preach in Estonian, Latvian and Russian language, while at the same time Catholic documents were published in these languages. Stephen Batory participated in counter-reformation by granting revenues and estates confiscated from Protestants to the Catholic Church and by initiating a (largely unsuccessful) recruitment campaign for Catholic colonists.Tuchtenhagen (2005), p. 38 These measures however proved to have only limited impact on the Estonian and Latvian population, while alienating the German gentry to a degree that they supported the Swedish take-over of Livonia (without Latgalia, Courland and Semigallia), formalized in the treaties of Altmark (1629) and Stuhmsdorf (1635). The Polish‚ÄìSwedish wars had begun in 1600, when Catholic Sigismund III Vasa tried to incorporate Protestant Swedish Estonia into the Polish-Lithuanian Duchy of Livonia, whereupon the local nobles turned to the duke of S√∂dermanland and later Swedish king, Charles IX for protection.Steinke (2009), p. 120 Charles IX expelled the Polish forces from Estonia, and his campaigns in the Duchy of Livonia were concluded in 1621 by his successor Gustavus Adolphus, who established the dominion of Swedish Livonia from the bulk of the Duchy of Livonia. Swedish rule ended the counter-reformation, and the privileges of the Livonian nobles resembled those outlined in the Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti.Kahle (1984), p. 18 When in 1710 Estonia and Livonia capitulated to Russia during the Great Northern War, the capitulations explicitly referred to the Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti, with the respective references being confirmed in the Treaty of Nystad (1721).

The church is situated in an isolated position, surrounded by open farmland on the eastern coast of the island, between Groudle Glen and Baldrine.Terry Marsh, The Isle of Man: a walker's guide (2004), at page 120 The eastern (and oldest) part of the church has been restored, but it is otherwise in a ruinous, though well- tended, condition. St Adamnan was the Abbot of Iona between 679 and 704. Early history Celtic Cross within the churchyard The site on which the church stands is of ancient religious significance. The church yard contains Celtic crosses, the oldest of which dates backs to the 5th century AD - evidence of an early keeill. In about 1190, King Reginald of the Isle of Man gave a grant of the land of Escadala, in the Isle of Man to St Bees Priory, in Cumbria. It is likely that the site of the church was included in the grant, to which fact its subsequent reconstruction and selection as the parish church (despite its remoteness) are attributable.The Antiquary, volume 34 (London, Elliot Stock, 1898), at page 16 Supersession On 25 June 1733, an Act of Tynwald was passed for the building of a new parish church at Boilley Veen, in a more convenient part of the parish,William Harrison, An account of the diocese of Sodor and Man and St. German's cathedral (The Manx Society, Douglas, 1879), at page 106 but the new church was not in fact completed until a hundred years later. This 19th century church closed in October 2014 owing to lack of funds for maintenance, leaving Lonan without a parish church. Later history St Adamnan's fell into disrepair, but was restored by the Reverend John Quine, who became vicar of Lonan in 1895.D.S.Dugdale, Manx Church Origins (Llanerch Publishers, 1998), at page 198 The Friends of St Adamnan's were formed in 1968 to keep the old church in good repair and ensure it remained as a working church and historical site.Isle of Man Guide: Kirk Lonan (accessed on 21 March 2010) It is one of Registered Buildings of the Isle of Man.

Its parish includes the hamlet of Little Britain and part of Ardens Grafton, the greater part of which is in the neighbouring civil parish of Temple Grafton. The 2011 Census recorded Exhall parish's population as 203. Exhall is on Hay Brook, a tributary of the River Arrow. The civil parish neighbours those of Alcester and Wixford, with which it shares both an ecclesiastical parish and a cricket club.Exhall and Wixford Cricket Club History Exhall is known as one of the \\"Shakespeare villages\\". William Shakespeare is said to have joined a party of Stratford folk which set itself to outdrink a drinking club at Bidford-on- Avon, and as a result of his labours in that regard to have fallen asleep under the crab tree of which a descendant is still called Shakespeare's tree. When morning dawned his friends wished to renew the encounter but he wisely said \\"No I have drunk with Piping Pebworth, Dancing Marston, Haunted Hillboro‚Äô, Hungry Grafton, Dodging Exhall, Papist Wixford, Beggarly Broom and Drunken Bidford' and so, presumably, I will drink no more.\\" The story is said to date from the 17th century but of its truth or of any connection of the story or the verse to Shakespeare there is no evidence. The nickname \\"Dodging Exhall\\" may have arisen from the fact that the village was not, at any rate in the 18th century, directly approachable either from Alcester or Stratford. Exhall is first mentioned in the grant by Ceolred of Mercia to Evesham Abbey in AD 710. It also appears in the list of manors acquired by Abbot Ethelwig and the estates for which William I directed Bishop Wulfstan to give the abbot protection, but it was among the manors seized by Bishop Odo of Bayeux after Ethelwig's death in 1077, being then assessed at 2 hides. By 1086, it is recorded in the Domesday Book as part of the lands of William son of Courbucion; who was appointed Sheriff of Warwick soon after 1086; where it reads, \\"In Ferncombe Hundred, Thorkell holds 1 1/2 hides in Ecleshelle (Exhall). Land for 1 plough. 2 smallholders. Meadow, 10 acres. The value was 10s now 5s. Swein held it freely before 1066.\\" Governance Exhall is part of the Bardon ward of Stratford-on-Avon District Council, represented by Councillor Valerie Hobbs, Conservative. Nationally it is part of Stratford-on- Avon (UK Parliament constituency). In the European Union it is part of the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament. Parish church The parish church for Exhall and Wixford, located in Exhall and dedicated to St. Giles, is a small building with a nave dating from the 12th century, a 13th-century chancel, a south porch and a bell-turett. The Norman origin of the nave is proved by the built up doorway on the North side, with scalloped capitals and a one-step arch. The church was much restored and in part rebuilt in 1862, mainly at the cost of the then rector. However, the Worcester Diocesian Architectural Society protested in 1861 against the plans of the builder, Soloman Hunt, to remove the Norman doorway, the old windows and the original bell turret and so the Church Building Society refused to make a grant. The font has a tapering round bowl on an octagonal stem; it is possibly an ancient bowl reworked but shows no signs of former staples for the lid. In the chancel floor are small brass standing effigies of John Walsingham, died 20 January 1566, and Eleanor (Ashfield) his wife. He is shown in Elizabethan armour and is incised on an irregularly rectangular plate, only silhouetted on his left side below the shoulder, possibly a palimpsest. She is in silhouette and wears a close cap, brocaded dress with padded sleeves, and a long cloak. Above the figures are two shields set upside down. The dexter charged with a trefoil between three molets (Ashfield); the sinister charged quarterly the first, destroyed, the second and third, a checky cross between sixteen roundels, and the fourth, a paly of six a fesse (Walsingham).

The actors, Mike Lucock, Dendy Subangil, and Ruli Lubis who starred this film, reprise their appearance in Rumah Dara with different character, such as, actor Ruli Lubis who in this film acts as victim, but in Rumah Dara he acts as villain. Plot The film begins at restaurant which is owned by a beautiful and perfect woman named Dara. That night, Dara invites a man named Adjie to dine with her on the next night in her house. Then, after black fades, Adjie is shown again, bounded by chains in a blood-splattered room. He tries to break free, but Dara, comes to the room and test the quality of Adjie, as her test, she bites Adjie's stomach. Attempting to kill Adjie, Dara starts to slash him off with her chainsaw. Suddenly, a bell rings and, Dara, with her chainsaw broken, leaves the room and opens the door. It was a bald-headed man named Eko, wanting to meet Dara. Eko is welcomed to the dinner table to eat, while Dara leaves him for a second, goes to a room and dumps Eko's flower bouquet onto a bed in there. She crosses Eko's name in the next day's date, and writes Adjie's name on the current date. From this activity, we know that Dara is a cannibal who invites men secretly and kills them when they are in her house. And Dara schedules her victims each night, for one reason: to have fresh meat everyday. And the men who come to her house now, will be slashed like Dara's past victims. At dinner, after Dara shuts Adjie's mouth and turns on classical music loudly, Dara is visited by a quiet, fat man named Rama who joins Dara and Eko for dinner. The conversation in there is dominated by Eko who tells Rama about exercising for a sixpack. While they are at the dinner table, Adjie manages to break the chain and set himself free from the room. Realizing that Adjie is loose, Dara takes her crossbow (placed secretly under the dinner table) and shoots Eko's chest, then slits his throat with a machete. Then, she slashes Rama's shoulder and when Rama crawls to the front door, he is decapitated by Dara with the same machete as a slash on his shoulder. Adjie returns to the gory room and hides there from Dara. Dara, who finds Adjie, gets stabbed in the hand by Adjie. Then Adjie quickly runs to front door, opens it, and goes into his car. When he wants to close his car door, Dara with her chainsaw turned on breaks it and slaughters Adjie with it, leaving no survivor that night. The scene changes to Dara's restaurant, where she takes some meat from her refrigerator, and it is revealed that the meat used for her meals, are human meat. Then the camera pans through the restaurant as everybody looks appreciatively at the food cooked by Dara herself. Dara who still won over the men' fights yet, smiles and makes a grimace to camera.

Often it is more than the skins that are used, and include the dried berries (or \\"cherries\\") of the coffee plant that remain after the coffee beans have been collected from within. It is also known as cascara, from the Spanish c√°scara, meaning \\"husk\\". It is different from c√°scara sagrada tea, a powerful plant-based laxative derived from Rhamnus purshiana, which is native to the Pacific Northwest. Coffee cherry tea is a common drink in some coffee-growing nations, notably Bolivia, and, as the variant qishr, in Yemen. Outside of these traditional uses, the coffee fruit is usually considered a wasted byproduct of the coffee-production process. However, increasing demand for c√°scara from large U.S.-based coffee chains has, in some cases, led to the dried husks fetching higher prices than the coffee beans. It is commonly consumed in Bolivia, where it is referred to as sultana, and is made of sun- dried and lightly toasted coffee cherries. It may also be mixed with sticks of cinnamon. It is also called \\"the poor man's coffee\\", and \\"the coffee of the Army\\". It is believed that c√°scara tea was consumed in Yemen even before the form of coffee we know today. Coffee cherries contain caffeine, as does the tea, though while the tea is popularly understood to have a high level of caffeine, it actually only has about a quarter the caffeine levels of coffee. Cascara is known to be high in antioxidants. The taste of coffee cherry tea is different from coffee, and has been described as somewhat sweet and cherry flavored, surprisingly pleasant.  Brewing  Brewing guidelines are not standardized, but 20 grams per liter of water, or approximately 5 grams per cup (8 oz, 240 ml) is suggested. When the coffee cherry tea is ground and classified to loose tea industry standard size, one teaspoon per 6 ounces of water, steeped for 5 minutes are the standard brewing instructions. Proper brewing yields a dark red tea; brew time guidelines range from 4 minutes to 7 or 8 minutes.  Availability  As of 2017, cascara is regularly sold in a small number of cities in the United States, including Washington D.C., New York City, Boston, Raleigh, Los Angeles, and Seattle. After the coffee beans are collected, the remaining fruit is sundried and brewed into coffee cherry tea. Starbucks Coffee and Blue Bottle Coffee have both featured cascara-based drinks on their seasonal menus, including a \\"cascara latte\\" and a \\"cascara fizz\\", respectively. In September 2019, Shake Shack introduced a cascara shake. In October 2019, Dashfire Bitters of Minnesota released a ready-to- drink Manhattan cocktail using fig and cascara.

Often billed as \\"The Voice of Inexperience\\", Wakefield is best known for his idiosyncratic satirical monologues. Wakefield was educated in South Africa, then travelled to England, where he began acting with a Shakespearean repertory company. He then attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts for further study, where he developed his distinctive style of humorous monologue. Wakefield created the stage persona of a nervous upper class young man, customarily dressed in full dinner suit and habitually carrying a cigarette. He developed a distinctive stuttering mode of speech featuring tortuous syntax, malapropisms, spoonerisms, dropped words and unfinished sentences which he used to disguise his satirical observations, wry sarcasm and clever double entendres. In his early career he was clean-shaven but later grew a handlebar moustache. He quickly established himself in nightclubs and music hall and became the first Resident Comedian on the BBC, as well as making pioneering appearances in the early days of British TV. He also became established in the United States and appeared in the variety movie short On the Air and Off (1933) (USA short, filmed at Biograph Studios, Bronx, New York City) (Universal Pictures)IMDb on the Air and Off:https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175004/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_14 and made one of his first American stage appearances in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1934, which also featured Eve Arden. Wakefield appeared in several British Path√© newsreels in the late 1930s. In 1937 he starred in the 20th Century Fox film There Was Young Man, followed by featured roles in several British films between 1938 and 1942 including The Peterville Diamond (1942), playing a gentleman jewel thief (whose partner-in-crime was played by future Doctor Who star William Hartnell). He made regular appearances at the Savoy Theatre, the Berkeley, the Ritz, Cafe de Paris, Churchill's and other leading London venues. He was booked to open at the Rainbow Room in New York City three weeks after the outbreak of World War II, but chose to remain in England, where he served in the R.A.F. Piccadixie (featuring Oliver Wakefield) at the Finsbury Park Empire, London, 28 July 1941 After the war, Wakefield returned to show business. He toured Australia, performing for a year in Melbourne and Sydney, followed by a 52-week radio series for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Moving to the United States in 1952, he performed at the Blue Angel in New York, followed by engagements at Number One Fifth Avenue, Ruban Bleu and Bon Soir and TV appearances on All Star Revue, the Kate Smith show, The Steve Allen Show and many others. His last Broadway appearance was in the Broadway revue, Two's Company at the Alvin Theatre in New York in 1952, which starred Bette Davis. In Canada he appeared frequently on the Canadian Broadcasting Service on the Frigidair TV Show, played a fourteen-week engagement at Montreal club Ruby Foos and hosted his own TV panel Show Make a Match.

The Mogamma was the result of a series of master plans for the Qasr el Nil area (now Tahrir Square), which used to be occupied by the British barracks. In 1945 when King Farouk ordered the demolition of the barracks upon the departure of British troops from the area, a series of urban planning proposals ensued. The idea for a centralised, all-in-one administrative building emerged from the 1945 plans. Construction began in 1946, and ended in 1949. The building's style reflects typical 1940s modernism, and government buildings in the same style can be found in Buffalo, New York (Buffalo City Hall), and Paris. Contrary to popular belief, there is no Soviet association or inspiration, and the building was not constructed by the government of Egypt's second President, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Indeed, Nasser did not become the leader of Egypt until November 1954, several years after the building was completed. The Mogamma is located in downtown Cairo to the south of Tahrir Square, which was, at the time, the newly designed \\"Liberation Square\\".Williams, Sasha. \\"The Mogamma: Architectural Gem or Bureaucratic Oddity?\\" Daily News Egypt. 10 July 2009. Function The Mogamma is an administrative governmental building, where all paper work is done by government agencies. For example, one can go there to process documents, get a driver's license, or issue a visa. The governmental agencies that are located in the building include the Tax Evasion Investigations Offices, the Fire Fighting Organization, and the Passport Offices.

Structure and architecture The building was designed by Egyptian architect Mohamed Kamal Ismail, who also designed the High Court of Egypt's building, and planned the expansion of the Great Mosque of Mecca and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Saudi Arabia. The building was built in Modern Architectural Style, with little attention to the facade's 'beauty', and more focus on its practicality, as the building was planned to - at the time - have around four thousand employees.https://mantiqti.cairolive.com/ÿ≠Ÿàÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™-ÿµÿ≠ŸÅŸäÿ©/ŸÖŸÜÿ∑ŸÇÿ™Ÿä-Ÿäÿ≠ÿßŸàÿ±-ŸÖÿØŸäÿ±-ŸÖÿ¨ŸÖÿπ- ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ÿ±Ÿäÿ±-ŸÑÿß-ÿ™Ÿà The Mogamma in cinema The Mogamma has appeared in several Egyptian movies, the most famous one being Al-irhab wal Kebab (Terrorism and Kebab), a comedy in which the building's bureaucracy frustrates an Egyptian citizen to the point that he mistakenly grabs a guard's gun, proceeds to take the building hostage, and is labeled a terrorist.Sardar, Ziauddin. \\"What Egyptian Cinema Can Teach Us.\\" New Statesman. 2 April 2007. .

Red tape Mecca on its way out, Reading Eagle (from The Washington Post), Retrieved December 13, 2010 In 2016, the government announced its plan to reduce congestion in the Downtown Cairo area, a plan that focuses primarily on the Mogamma, which is believed to have created and contributed to the enormous amount of congestion in Tahrir Square. The administrative offices inside the building are to be emptied and transferred elsewhere outside the downtown area, but while the government set the date for the evacuation of the building to be in mid-2017, the deadline has not yet been met. Steps towards the eventual move from the building were finally taken in mid-2019, when the Passports, Immigration and Nationality Administration, which occupied 215 offices in the first and second floors, and used to attract more than %75 of citizens going to the Mogamma, was moved to its new grounds at Al Abbassia.

Pottinger, who arrived in Hong Kong on 22 August while on his way to the expedition, kept Johnston as acting administrator.Endacott 2005, p. 56The Chinese Repository. Volume 10. Canton. 1841. pp. 351‚Äì352. Acting on Elliot's policy of encouraging a growing settlement, Johnston disposed land lots for development, which he classified into marine, town, and suburban. In November 1841, he sent Pottinger an account of the settlement's progress, such as the development of Queen's Road, the Magistracy, the Record Office, and a prison. Barracks were built in Stanley and a bridle path was laid towards Aberdeen. He reported that houses were being built and that many people were making applications for land. However, Pottinger criticised Johnston for granting land without elaboration of Hong Kong's future from the British government.Endacott 2005, pp. 57‚Äì58 He returned to Hong Kong on 1 February 1842.The Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 674 Historian Frank Welsh wrote, \\"He got few thanks for it, then or later, but it is largely due to Johnston's initiative that Hong Kong was allowed to develop\\".Welsh, Frank (1997). A History of Hong Kong (2nd ed.). HarperCollins. p. 142. . When Pottinger left Hong Kong on 13 June to rejoin the expedition, Johnston was again left in charge and was told not to grant land except for barracks and the troops' families who began to arrive from Britain.The Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 676 In October 1842, he informed Pottinger of the crime and disorder in the colony. Piracy was frequent and isolated houses were attacked, often by gangs who landed from boats. The jail was full, but Johnston said he lacked the authority to impose sentences on the inmates awaiting trial. Such conditions helped the Colonial Office be aware of the importance of establishing full control of law and order, and the danger of allowing the Chinese to share this responsibility. On 2 December, Pottinger returned from the north, and Johnston remained Deputy Superintendent of Trade, which was changed in 1843 to the Assistant and Registrar to the Superintendent of Trade.The Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 685 After Pottinger became the first Governor of Hong Kong on 26 June 1843, he appointed Johnston as a member of the Executive and Legislative Councils on 21 August.The Chinese Repository.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 June 1845 for his contributions to the natural history of China. He returned to Hong Kong in September 1845 as Secretary and Registrar to the Superintendent of Trade. In June 1846, Johnston was made a member of the Executive Council in place of Colonial Secretary Frederick Wright-Bruce who went on leave before being appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Newfoundland.Endacott 2005, p. 59 After the abolition of the office of Secretary and Registrar on 25 September 1852, he obtained a compensation allowance, and retired to England in March 1853.

They had eight sons and two daughters, including Conway Campbell-Johnston (1859‚Äì1915), who died with his wife in the sinking of the Lusitania, and Malcolm Campbell-Johnston, who was Conservative Member of Parliament for East Ham South. Johnston resided in Suffolk, where he was a justice of the peace, and in London. In 1883, Johnston and his wife travelled to the United States, where they visited the small town of Garvanza, California.

The train services are operated by Deutsche Bahn and WestfalenBahn. The station is also served by the Hanover S-Bahn. History Original fortifications around station The station was opened in 1848 as the terminus of the trunk line of the Cologne‚ÄìMinden Railway Company (CME), connecting with the Royal Hanoverian State Railways‚Äô Hannover‚ÄìMinden line. South of Minden the Cologne‚ÄìMinden line passes through the gap created at Porta Westfalica by the Weser river between the Weser and Wiehen Hills. The geography made it difficult to build the railway on the western side of the river through the gap to a station near Minden and then cross the river to continue to the east. Instead it was decided to cross the river at Rehme (near Bad Oeynhausen), continuing north on the eastern bank through the gap, which was widened with explosives and then along a levee to a station built on the eastern bank of the river. Both lines were completed on 15 October 1847. As it was a border station on one of the major routes for east-west traffic, it was originally highly fortified. In 1866 the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia, allowing the railway to operate continuously from Berlin to Cologne without frontiers. The fortifications around the station were abandoned in 1873. At the beginning of the 20th century further railway connections were added in the form of the Minden District Railway and the Bad Eilsen Light Railway. In 1921 the Verden‚ÄìRotenburg railway was built, providing a connection to the north towards Bremen. A freight station was later added and Minden station was connected to a railway to the river port. In 1950 the Bundesbahn Central Office, which was responsible for technological development and the procurement of rail vehicles and infrastructure was relocated to Minden, although some of these activities were also carried out in Munich. Station building The station and connecting railway lines The Cologne- Minden Railway Company‚Äôs station and reception building was built to the design of the royal building inspector Schelle and was completed in 1848 after the start of railway operations on 15 October 1847. It was built in the romantic style, with features based on medieval towers and battlements, a style which was used at this time for many stations in Westphalia. The Minden station is one of the few remaining stations in this style. The station was designed as a transfer station between the Cologne-Minden and the Royal Hanoverian State railways. This function was no longer required after the absorption of Hanover by Prussia, so the station always showed plenty of space and could accommodate new, larger traffic flows smoothly and without further modification. The facade of Minden station has three parts. The building is divided into two identical-looking end buildings, which are connected by a single-storey central section with a ticket office and baggage-handling facilities. Originally, there were customs facilities and first, second, third and fourth class waiting rooms. In addition, it houses a restaurant and bar. The Cologne-Minden Railway built its lines and its maintenance facilities on the southern and western side of the station while the Royal Hanoverian State Railways built its lines and its maintenance facilities on the eastern side, turning the station into an \\"island\\" station. The station was opened in 1847 is located on the Rheine to L√∂hne railway and the Hamm to Minden railway. The train services are operated by Deutsche Bahn.

In the preamble of the resolution, the Security Council reaffirmed that the primary cause of the crisis in Angola was due to the failure of UNITA, under the leadership of Jonas Savimbi, to comply with its obligations under the Accordos de Paz, Lusaka Protocol and relevant Security Council resolutions. There was concern about the impact on the population and the provision of military assistance, including mercenaries, to UNITA. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan had made recommendations regarding the improvement of sanctions against UNITA. The resolution highlighted that peace and national reconciliation in Angola could only be achieved through a political settlement of the conflict and in this regard welcomed planned visits by the Chairman of the Committee established in Resolution 864 to the country to discuss to improve measures against UNITA. It condemned continued UNITA attacks against civilians in Huambo, Kuito and Malanje. Expert panels were then established for a period of six months to collect information relating to violations of measures against UNITA in connection with weapons, oil, diamonds and financial resources. The panels also had to identify parties violating the sanctions and recommend ways to end such violations. The panels were responsible for the Fowler Report, that later gave rise to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (United Nations General Assembly Resolution 55/56). All countries were called to co-operate with the panel and provide access to information, witnesses, places in addition to guaranteeing its safety and granting immunity under the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. Furthermore, the Council was concerned at the delays in investigating the downing of two United Nations aircraft over UNITA-controlled territory on 26 December 1998 and 2 January 1999, as well as the crash of a plane carrying the Special Representative of the Secretary- General in C√¥te d'Ivoire on 26 June 1998. Finally, all countries were urged to co-operate towards humanitarian activities in Angola.

It is written with the common nebti-crest, but not with any personal title that could identify whether the person was a member of Egyptian royalty or that it was even a name.

Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jean-Pierre P√§tznik instead read the name as djeseret-ankh-nebti (‚Äòthe noble one who lives for the two ladies‚Äô) and see it as the name of a wife of king Sekhemkhet.

There is nothing beyond it, except for two senseless item songs, one each for Irani and Mirza to stretch their legs.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, and stated, \\"Despite juvenile jokes like peeing on open electric wires, Fruit & Nut is mercifully not the sort of vulgar comedy we‚Äôve got used to seeing at the cinemas these days.\\" Box office Fruit and Nut failed to perform well at the box office, partly due to high-budget film like Blue and All The Best: Fun Begins, which had released the previous week.

The strip consisted of a 7,130 foot paved runway, with a total graded length of 9,130 feet, consisting of single north/south runway, which was built on top of a dirt road which led north from US Highway 40. The paved runway surface had apparently been extended at some point after the runway's initial construction, as the length of the runway pavement is 9,300 feet in aerial imagery of the site. There is also what appears to be a small square paved ramp area along the west side of the northern end of the runway; however there are no buildings at the site. It was used by the United States Air Force as an auxiliary field for the Hill AFB range until about 1965. It is not known whether the Low Flight Strip was ever reused as a civilian airfield. Today the airfield is abandoned, its hard surface deteriorating in the harsh, arid environment. References * Shaw, Frederick J.

The Commission, headed by former Supreme Court Justice Moshe Landau, found that the GSS (General Security Service/Shabak/Shin Bet) interrogators routinely used physical force during the interrogation of prisoners and then committed perjury at subsequent trials. In its conclusion, approved by Cabinet in November 1987, it lay down guidelines for the use of a \\"moderate measure of physical pressure\\".

In 1986 the head of the GSS, Avraham Shalom resigned after being accused of attempting to frame a senior IDF general for the murder of two Palestinian prisoners killed after the hijacking. With his resignation he was given a Presidential pardon. On 6 August 1986 the Supreme Court rejected an appeal against the pardon, but Attorney General Yosef Harish promised there would be an investigation.Middle East International issue 281, page 6,8 August 1986.

Over the summer of 1986 the Israeli public were also facing the unfolding Pollard spy scandal in the United States as well as the publication of a very critical report into the banking system. It is possible that concerns about the GSS would have been forgotten. But a fresh scandal arouse the following year, April 1987. A change in the law had created an opening for verdicts of Military Courts to be challenged in the Supreme Court. In 1980 Azat Naffso, an IDF Lieutenant and member of Israel's 2,000-strong Circassian community from Kfar Kanna, had been convicted by a secret court martial of transmitting information and explosives to \\"hostile parties\\" and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Naffso, lodged an appeal against his sentence on the grounds of fabricated evidence and false testimony.Middle East International, issue 299, page 12 . 1 May 1987. Peretz Kidron. At the end of May 1987 he was released after being cleared of most of the charges. Attorney General Harish had offered no opposition to the appeal. The court was very critical about GSS behavior, in particular by GSS claims that Naffso's confessions, on which the case was based, were given freely and without undue pressure. The court ordered that Naffso should be financially compensated and his IDF rank restored. Once again GSS activities were being discussed in public. Israeli state television quoted \\"Senior Shabak (GSS) figures\\" as saying that Naffso was subject to procedures identical to those \\"in hundreds of other cases.\\" Middle East International, issue 301, page 9. 29 May 1987. Peretz Kidron Under immense pressure from the judiciary the Government set up a secret three man Commission of inquiry headed by the President of the Supreme Court Moshe Landau. The Commission The \\"Commission of Inquiry into the Methods of Investigation of the General Security Service Regarding Hostile Terrorist Activity\\" was established on 31 May 1987. Its remit was to look into \\"the investigation methods and procedures of the GSS on Hostile Terrorist Activity, and the giving of testimony in Court regarding these investigations.\\"Amnesty International, July 1991. AI Index:MDE 15/34/91. \\"Document - Israel and the Occupied Territories: The military justice system in the Occupied Territories: detention, interrogation and trial procedures.\\" Page 42. quoting paragraph 1.6 of the Report. The final report was published on 30 October 1987 and endorsed by the cabinet 8 November 1987. The FindingsPerjury= In the previous two decades some 50% of GSS interrogations led to trials, and \\"the overwhelming majority of those tried were convicted on the basis of their confession in court.\\"AI, page 43, Landau para 2.20. The Commission found that interrogators were permitted \\"from time to time to employ means of pressure, including physical pressure.\\" They found this measure \\"unavoidable\\" and \\"an interrogation tool of utmost importance.\\"AI, page 43, quoting Landau paras 2.21, 2.37. but that a \\"dilemma\\" arouse about revealing the methods of interrogation since it would \\"appear to the court as violating the principle of a person's free will, and thus causing the rejection of the confession.\\"AI page 43, Landau para 2.26. They found that the GSS \\"simply lied, thus committing the criminal offence of perjury\\" and that \\"false testimony in court soon became the unchallenged norm which was to be the rule for 16 years.\\"AI page 43, Landau paras 2.27, 2.30. In 1982 a written \\"guideline as to the nature of the lie to be told\\" with regard to \\"method of physical pressure\\" was issued by the highest GSS authorities.AI page 43, Landau para 2.31. The Commission was satisfied that the practice of committing perjury had \\"completely discontinued\\" after the head of GSS issued a directive on 10 June 1987.AI page 43, Landau para 2.33. Middle East International, issue 313, 21 November 1987. Peretz Kidron. It also found that the judges, prosecutors, police and medical personnel were unaware of systematic perjury by GSS interrogators. \\"Even though no judges were called to appear before us and we heard no explicit denial, we find this allegation to be baseless, and wholly unacceptable.\\"AI page 47, Landau paras 2.43 - 2.46. =Habeas Corpus= With regard to Habeas Corpus the Commission found that the keeping of prisoners \\"without judicial supervision for a period of 18 days not acceptable.\\" Hence \\"We support the proposal to shorten this period and recommend that the question of prolonging the detention be brought before a judge no later than the eighth day after the day of his arrest.\\"AI pages 22, 36. Landau para 4.17. =Interrogation techniques= The Commission found that the use of violence against prisoners was an acceptable method of interrogation. They argued, in the light of what they called \\"the concept of the lesser evil\\", that \\"actual torture . . . would be perhaps be justified in order to uncover a bomb about to explode in a building full of people . . . whether the charge is certain to be detonated in five minutes or in five days.\\" \\"To put it bluntly, the alternative is: are we to accept the offence of assault entailed in slapping a suspect's face, or threatening him, in order to induce him to talk and reveal a cache of explosive materials meant for use in carrying an act of mass terror against a civilian population, and there by prevent the greater evil which is about to occur? The answer is self evident.\\"AI pages 44, 46. Landau para 3.15. Elsewhere they state: \\"The effective interrogation of terrorist suspects is impossible without the use of means of pressure, in order to overcome an obdurate will not to disclose information and to overcome the fear of the person under interrogation that harm will befall him from his own organization, if he does reveal information.\\"AI page 45. Landau para 4.6. And: \\"The means of pressure should principally take the form of non-violent psychological pressure through a vigorous and extensive interrogation, with the use of statagems, including acts of deception. However, when these do not attain their purpose, the exertion of a moderate measure of physical pressure cannot be avoided.\\"AI page 45. Landau para 4.7. But they identified a danger: \\"a security service . . . is always in danger of sliding towards methods practised in regimes which we abhore.\\"AI page 47, Landau para 4.2. And \\"It is true that strict care must be taken, lest a breach of the structure of prohibitions of the criminal law bring about a loosening of the reins, with each interrogator taking matters into his own hands through the unbridled, arbitrary use of coercion against a suspect. In this way the image of the State as a law-abiding polity which preserves the rights of the citizen, is liable to be irreparably perverted, with it coming to resemble those regimes which grant their security organs unbridled power.\\" It recommended: \\"First, disproportionate exertion of pressure on the suspect is inadmissible; the pressure must never reach the level of physical torture or maltreatment of the suspect or grievous harm to his honour which deprives him of his human dignity. Second, the possible use of less serious measures must be weighed against the degree of anticipated danger, according to the information in the possession of the interrogator. Third, the physical and psychological means of pressure permitted for use by an interrogator must be defined and limited in advance, by issuing binding directives. Fourth, there must be strict supervision of the implementation in practice of the directives given to GSS interrogators. Fifth, the interrogator's superiors must react firmly and without hesitation to every deviation from the permissible, imposing disciplinary punishment, and in serious cases by causing criminal proceedings to be instituted against the offending interrogator.\\"AI page 44, Landau para 3.16. The guidelines for means of pressure permitted were contained in the second part of the report, which \\"for understandable reasons\\" were kept secret. The Commission stated that the code was less severe than techniques used by the British army in Northern Ireland and followed the standards set down by the European Court of Human Rights in 1978. They recommended that the code should be reviewed annually by a small Ministerial Committee \\"reporting to the Services Subcommittee of the Knesset's Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee.\\"AI page 45, Landau para 4.8. Physical PressureBefore the Commission= In 1968 the International Committee for the Red Cross issued a report on Nablus Prison, one of the IDF's detention centers in the recently captured West Bank. It found: #\\"Suspension of the detainee by the hands and simultaneous traction of his other members for hours at a time until he loses consciousness. #Burns with cigarette stubs. #Blows by rods on the genitals. #Tying up and blindfolding for days. #Bites by dogs. #Electric shocks at the temples, the mouth, the chest and testicles.\\"National Lawyers Guild. 1977 Middle East Delegation. \\"Treatment of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza: report of the National Lawyers Guild 1977 Middle East Delegation.\\" . 1978.

In 1972 the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights, founded by Israel Shahak, issued a report on conditions in the Gaza Strip. They found that prisoners were stripped naked for long periods including during interrogation, and that prisoners had no contact with the outside for a least a month sometimes two or three. It list methods used as: a) Falaka (beating of the soles of feet). b) suspension by hands for long periods. c) holding a chair or arms above head for long periods. d) beating hands and fingers. e) leaving prisoners soaked in cold water. f) beating. g) slapping face.ILHR report issued 17 October 1972.

In 1984 International Commission of Jurists published a report by Law in the Service of Man called \\"Torture and Intimidation in the West Bank - The case of al-Fara'a Prison.\\" They had found that detainees were handcuffed and hooded for long periods, routinely beaten, kept in tiny cells \\"awash with filthy water\\", forced to masturbate, deprived of sleep and food, given cold showers and being forced to stand naked outside in rain at night.In 1984The International Commission of Jurists and Law in the Service of Man, \\"Torture and Intimidation in the West Bank.

Virtually all our sample were subject to: verbal abuse, humiliation and threats of injury; sleep and food deprivation; hooding for prolonged periods; enforced standing for long periods, sometimes in an enclosed space, hands bound behind back and legs tied (\\"al-Shabah\\"); being bound in other painful ways (such as the \\"banana\\" position); prolonged periods of painful confinement in small specially constructed cells (the \\"closet\\" or \\"refrigerator\\") and severe and prolonged beatings on all parts of the body, resulting in injuries requiring medical treatment.\\"Page 106 of the report, quoted in the Middle East Watch Report: \\"Prison Conditions in Israel and the Occupied Territories\\".

A 1995 official report by Miriam Ben-Porat, made public in 2000, showed that Shin Bet \\"routinely\\" went beyond the \\"moderate physical pressure\\" authorised by the Landau Commission. In the report, Israel admitted for the first time that Palestinian detainees were tortured during the First Intifada, between 1988 and 1992.Israel admits torture 9 February 2000, BBC A 2009 report by B'Tselem into the Shin Bet interrogation facility at Petah Tikva, based on testimony from 121 Palestinians, stated that: \\"In the interrogation room, detainees are forced to sit bound to a rigid chair unable to move, for hours and even days, causing intense pain in some cases. The hygienic conditions are appalling: detainees are sometimes denied showers and not given a change of clothes and toilet paper. At least some cells reek and have mould. The food is of poor quality and quantity, and detainees lose weight. During interrogation, detainees are exposed to threats, including threats against family members, and sometimes to violence. Other severe means include exposing the detainees to extreme heat and cold and depriving them of sleep.\\"http://www.btselem.org/english/publications/summaries/201010_kept_in_the_dark.asp: Page 60.

Chin was born in Guangzhou, China, on February 13, 1933. The daughter of a grocery store owner, she worked at her father's store as a cashier, cleaner, stocking clerk and bicycle delivery person. Chin married her husband, Tony, as a teenager and moved to Hong Kong for a few years. In 1956, she immigrated to the United States with her husband and settled in Minnesota. Chin worked first as a seamstress at several Minneapolis clothing stores after taking classes to learn how to mend clothes and create wedding dresses. Chin began selling clothes out of her home in South Minneapolis while she and her husband raised their five children. Her interest in food and restaurants began while she was still running her clothing business from her home. Chin cooked free meals and hosted dinner parties for her customers as a way of thanking them for their business. Soon, customers requested that Chin host cooking classes and cater events, according to her daughter, Laura Chin. Chin opened her eponymous first restaurant, Leeann Chin, at the Bonaventure Mall in Minnetonka, Minnesota in 1980. The restaurant, which was one of the first to offer Cantonese and Szechuan cuisine in the Twin Cities area, initially offered more than 100 menu items, most of which were created and developed by Chin. The first Minnetonka location featured a sit-down dining room and menus embellished with calligraphy. The restaurant proved an immediate success, with some food, which took days to make, selling out quickly. Chin soon converted it into an 80-seat buffet-style eatery to keep up with customer demand. Chin opened her second location in the Saint Paul Union Depot in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1984, while a third Leeann Chin restaurant opened at the International Design Center in Minneapolis that same year. Another location, which also opened in 1984 in downtown Minneapolis served more than 1,000 customers on an average business day. In 1985, Chin, who had run the day-to- day operations, sold the rights to her name and her restaurants to General Mills. Chin regained the ownership of her business in 1988. By the time Chin left the business in the late 1990s, the Leeann Chin chain had become a Chinese fast food operation. Smaller take-out locations were set up inside Byerly's grocery stores. Chin retired in 1999. The Leeann Chin chain now had more than 40 locations, mostly in the Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul area, as of 2010. Chin continued to teach cooking during her life. She hosted a cooking show on PBS and authored three cookbooks on Chinese cuisine. Chin moved to the state of Washington and resided on Bainbridge Island. Leeann Chin died from complications of liver cancer on March 10, 2010, in Seattle, Washington, aged 77. She was survived by her five children - Linda, Bill, Laura, Jean and Katie - and 11 grandchildren - Siu Ping, Dai Wai, Wai Lee, Rutledge, Logan, Katie, Griffin, Jack, Kyla, Dylan and Becca. Her husband, Tony, died in 1994.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Solway, the archdeaconry of West Cumberland and the diocese of Carlisle. A former fortified church, it is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The church dates mainly from the late 14th century, and it is built on a plinth from an earlier church. The church was built to resist fire and assault. The rectory was also fortified and includes a pele tower. Architecture=Exterior The authors of the Buildings of England series (led by Nikolaus Pevsner) describe the church as \\"one of the architectural sensations of Cumbria\\". Pevsner originally described the building as one of the architectural sensations of Cumberland, a description which has been updated to reflect local government reorganisation. Externally it is Perpendicular in style, while internally it is more Scottish with French influences. The church is built in limestone; the roof of the nave has sandstone slates, while that of the chancel is in green slate. Its plan consists of a two-bay nave with north and south porches and chapels forming north and south transepts, and a three-bay chancel with a north vestry. The porches and transepts have a structural function, as they support the thrust of the massive stone roof of the nave. At the west, but set back from the west front, is a twin bellcote. (The bellcote was moved to its present position in 1812). A plain parapet runs round the walls of the nave and a cross finial stands on the east gable. At the northeast junction of the nave and chancel is a hexagonal stair turret that leads to a walkway around the parapet; the turret is surmounted by a slate-covered spire. In the south wall of the chancel is an arched priest's doorway. Interior Interior showing the stone-vaulted roof with corbels of unknown function The chancel has an open timber roof. The nave has a stone barrel-vaulted roof. This indicates that this was a fortified building, and it is said to be the only stone barrel- vaulted church in England. Corbels at the west end support the bellcote and the parapet walk. The corbels elsewhere in the nave have an uncertain function; they possibly supported the centring over which the vault was built. As well as a piscina on the south side of the chancel, there are piscinae in both transepts (indicating that they would originally have had altars); the piscina in the south transept has an ogee arch and recesses for aumbries. The font has a 14th-century appearance, but may be older. Around the walls are plaques dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. In the windows is stained glass dated 1864 and 1884 designed by R. B. Edmundson. On the west wall are boards dating from the 19th century that carry the Creed and Lord's Prayer. Organ The church had an undated organ built by the Casson Positive Organ Company. This has been replaced with a 19th-century organ by Wilkinson and Sons of Kendal. The instrument had previously been housed in St Oswald's Church, Grasmere and Lancaster Baptist Church before being moved to Boltongate in 2000.

It is owned and operated by the Omak City Council and serves Omak, although it is situated in nearby town Riverside's city limits rather. The airport was built by the United States Army Air Forces around 1942 and was approved for public use the following year. After World War II ended, it was closed and turned over for local government use by the War Assets Administration (WAA). Throughout its history, a number of improvements and expansions have occurred with its terminal, runways and taxiways, specifically in June 1979, when improvements made around that month were celebrated with an air show presentation. Numerous airlines have previously served the airport, including Omak Airlines which had its headquarters and hub based at the terminal around 1980. Historically, it has also suffered from financial difficulties, specifically due to budget restrictions having been leased numerous times. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released demographics relating to the airport, including historical aircraft movements, based aircraft and passenger boarding statistics. According to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), the highest number of aircraft movements it has handled annually is 142,000 and lowest is 4,254, while the most based aircraft at the Omak Airport was 658. It has seen no major accidents or incidents throughout its history. The Omak Airport, which covers an area of of city-owned property and overall at an elevation of , has a runway aligned 17‚Äì35, making it the third largest runway in Central Washington. Military aircraft are permitted for the airport. The terminal maintains a pilot lounge, as well as a medical facility, accommodation areas and administrative buildings; food and snacks are also offered. Its weather station is used to determine the local and upcoming weather of Omak and Riverside, as well as historical climate recordings. This data differs significantly from central Omak's recordings. The airport does not support commercial flights or charge non-commercial payments, but does provide three daily charter flights or general aviation services to other destinations from Monday to Friday which are commonly used for commuter purposes. These offerings are provided by a number of charter airlines, including Ameriflight and Empire Airlines. Cargo flights are also offered to fellow airports using packages from FedEx and the United Parcel Service (UPS) by a number of airlines. For the 12-month period ending on May 30, 2012, it garnered 23,750 aircraft movements and maintained three based aircraft. The Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center, based in Auburn, manages the traffic at the airport, in addition to all other airports in Washington.  History = Origin  The United States Army Air Forces built the airport around 1942, when it was known as the Okanogan Flight Strip and Omak Flight Strip.Shaw (2005) The initial construction, which was completed in 1943, consisted of a long, wide paved runway running north and south, with graded sides and overrun areas which were wide. It was constructed around the Donald Dodge and Grace Bell ranches, and served as a long hard-surfaced emergency landing airfield strip primarily used by military aircraft on training flights, for which purpose it was approved by the United States Armed Forces. By December 1943, bomber aircraft commonly used the flight strip. It was closed after World War II and turned over for local government use by the War Assets Administration (WAA) in 1954. ‚Äì via Google News Archive In 1956, the airport's ownership was transferred to the Omak City Council under the condition that it be maintained properly. ‚Äì via Google News Archive According to the city council, it has been expanded since then with assistance from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT).  Improvements  After being considered for upgrading in December 1956, the Omak City Council thought that the boundary lighting of what would become known as Omak Airport required improvements, and estimated that the cost would be around $16,000. ‚Äì via Google News Archive By March 1957, the improvements were seen as a high priority, but all of the bids from the seven companies interested in carrying out the work exceeded the estimate. The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) was notified, with the city council suggesting that the contract should be awarded to Wenatchee's Regan Electric, who bid $17,672. In addition to the lighting, of electric cables were to be installed, and the work was to be completed within 120 days of signing the contract. ‚Äì via Google News Archive A tour sponsored by the Wenatchee Chamber of Commerce was provided to enable aviators to see the improvements being made. ‚Äì via Google News Archive The work, which included an aerodrome beacon, was not completed until 1958, and a dedication program was planned for May 1958, jointly organised by two flying clubs and the city council. All of these improvements ultimately cost $18,000. ‚Äì via Google News Archive The city council approved an ordinance which made an extra $1,000 available towards their share of the cost, which amounted to 48.28 percent of the total; the remaining 52 percent was paid for by the CAA. With the state given $994,938 in 1960 for airport improvements across Washington, the Omak City Council was granted $12,172 for their Omak Airport. ‚Äì via Google News Archive ‚Äì via Google News Archive A radio navigation aid was proposed for the Omak Airport around 1961 by affiliated city council members because it would increase aircraft traffic according to supporters, although the FAA suggested that nearby city Brewster gain an aid for their local airport: Anderson Field. The former now maintains a navigation aid, while the latter does not. In June 1979, a terminal, air traffic controller and fuel tanks containing of jet fuel, 100 octanes of general aviation fuel and 6,000 octanes of fuel for older aircraft costing approximately $237,000 at the Omak Airport began to construct, having completed in August 1979; its newly paved runway was at that time. The terminal was dedicated to Arno Hopfer, a former city councilman who positively spoke for the airport when others considered it to be a stale project; the then-new Okanogan Valley Pilots Association, which is no longer existent, gave it an aircraft presentation on September 30, 1979. Numerous aircraft took off after an air show celebration at the terminal, which contained a breakfast service for aircraft pilots and a dinner service later that day. Precision aircraft takeoffs and landings were also provided at the presentation, which flew around the Okanogan County, in addition to flour bombing runs which involved flour dropping onto selected targets on the ground. These services were initially announced by Bruce Burk, the then-new spokesman for the Okanogan Valley Pilots Association. Members of this organization parked their aircraft at the Omak Airport, at their permanent high-downs. According to The Spokesman-Review, these services were provided in the hopes that Omak Airport may become a commercial airport in the future. ‚Äì via Google News Archive There were plans later that month by a member of the no longer existent flight school Omak Aviation which operated at the airport, to create an airline between Omak, Portland, Seattle, Spokane and Wenatchee. ‚Äì via Google News Archive It served as the largest airport in the Okanogan County that supported Boeing B-17, Boeing B-26, Cessna,Johnson (1994), p. 19 Douglas DC-3, ‚Äì via Google News Archive and helicopter landings since historical dates; some of these aircraft were operated around the local community during World War II. ‚Äì via Google News Archive The Omak Airport's taxiway and runway lighting was expanded in 1993, and 1997 with approximately $662,400 in funds the latter year. ‚Äì via Google News Archive The Omak Flying Club and Norcewa Flying Club, both pilot training clubs, formerly operated at the Omak Airport around the 1960s. ‚Äì via Google News Archive Around the early 2000s, the Omak Airport was the subject of significant improvement with over $750,000 worth of funds. Its runway and taxiway was reconstructed as a priority around 2002 with about $100,000 of the funds; the runway's main width was reduced to . While an FAA survey was also conducted in the early 2000s due to consideration for upgrades, a transponder landing system was requested for the airport in 2003, as per a city request with a contract agreement of $2,000,000 recorded by the United States Congress.United States Congress (2006), p. 3455United States Congress (2003), p. 1251 That same year, a Spokane government person proposed navigational equipment being added to the Omak Airport. In 2007, the Omak City Council was granted $142,500 to improve the airfield's taxiway and parking area, some of which was provided by the FAA. This would improve its infrastructure that would ensure aircraft safety. The following year, a crack sealing concern was addressed.  Airlines and difficulties  Throughout its history, a number of airlines have served the airport. Flights have been provided since historical dates to Omak for access to the Omak Stampede using charter airlines. ‚Äì via Google News Archive 30 private aircraft came to the airport from locations in Eastern Washington in 1949, for an air show presentation around the Okanogan County. ‚Äì via Google News Archive Commercial airlines have also previously served the airport. West Coast Airlines offered their services at this airport from 1954 to 1960 as a trial. In July 1960, the airline provided 149 flights to other destinations. According to the then- airport manager Jim Davenport, if five more flights were provided that month, then it would have been about five flights given to other airports daily. However, as this was a trial, West Coast Airlines stated that five was the minimal amount for their services to continue. ‚Äì via Google News Archive In September that year, Taquan Air also began testing their services at the Omak Airport to Wenatchee and Seattle for a period of three to six months; ‚Äì via Google News Archive this did not continue after because of a consensus against it. Omak Airlines operated its services and maintained its hub and headquarters at the airport, having provided flights to destinations such as the Spokane International Airport and there was consideration then to offer flights to other airports around Washington, while its runway was also improved in 1980. ‚Äì via Google News Archive Operations to Seattle or Spokane and Wenatchee were considered around 2005 by the Omak City Council in response to offered information to Harbor Air, but no further action was taken. Aside from airline flights, Ivan Farrar built an aircraft himself around 1970 and tested it at the Omak Airport in the 1970s. ‚Äì via Google News Archive No major accidents or incidents have occurred throughout its history among all aircraft operations. In October 1953, the airfield was leased to a firm for four-years under conditions as a public airport; the Omak Chamber of Commerce was told about the situation. The Omak Airport has historically suffered from financial difficulties, specifically in November 1959\\\\. In attempt to resolve the issue, city and county members met in a government conference. The flight strip gained $40,000 and $60,000 for improvements and maintenance. Despite this, it was suggested that this money depends largely upon commercial airline service among the Okanogan County and the \\"job is too big\\" for the Omak City Council. At that time, there were also budget restrictions which prevented large help for the airport. One proposal was to develop a port or airport district to operate the airfield, although snow removal in the winter by a plow machine would be a difficult task to perform. City council members of nearby city Okanogan stated that their airport, Okanogan Legion Airport, also required assistance with its snow by a plow machine. ‚Äì via Google News Archive The city proposed leasing the airfield in 1965, ‚Äì via Google News Archive but an action was not noted.  Demographics  Historical demographics for the Omak Airport have been released by the FAA. In 1980, there were 10,010 aircraft movements, 7,000 of which were used for itinerant general aviation purposes, while the count for local general aviation aircraft was 3,000 and operations for military purposes were 10. A 114.3 percent increase, approximately 21,450 aircraft operations were garnered in 1985; a total of 3,500 aircraft used its air taxi service, 15,000 were used for itinerant general aviation purposes, while 15,000 operations were provided for local general aviation purposes. In 1990, about 18,875 aircraft movements occurred, a 12 percent drop, with 3,300 aircraft movements used for air taxi purposes and 12,000 itinerant general aviation operations, in addition to 3,500 aircraft movements serving for local general aviation services and 75 serving for military use. Approximately 17,875 aircraft movements were also garnered in 1995, 2000 and 2001, showing no sign of improvement over the previous statistics from 1990; it gained the same amount of operations under the same categories until 2005. At this time, there was a significant decrease in aircraft movements representing a drop by 57.4 percent and dropped to 8,000 in terms of actual aircraft operations. Of these, 75 were used for both itinerant and local military purposes, totaling to 150, while there were 3,600 aircraft movements for commercial use air taxi services; a total of 3,081 movements were provided for itinerant general aviation needs and 1,169 were used for local general aviation services. No aircraft used the airport in 2006 and 2007 although the following year, 15,396 did. Of these aircraft movements, 75 were used for local military purposes, 2,887 for commercial air taxi purposes, 9,626 for itinerant general aviation use and 2,808 for local general aviation service. A total of 15,396 also used the airfield the following year, having gained the same number of movements under the same categories. In 2010, when a 72.4 percent decrease was represented, a total of 4,254 aircraft used the Omak Airport. 80 aircraft were used for local military purposes and there were 2,714 commercial air taxi movements, while the count for both itinerant and local general aviation was 730, totaling to 1,460. Statistics for based aircraft and passengers have also been recorded. In 1980, there were 32 based aircraft, 28 of which were single- engined and four were multi-engined, while in 1985, 29 aircraft were based, with the total of singled-engined planes being 27 and multi-engined being two. Meanwhile, the airport had 64 enplanement passenger boardings in 2000, 57 in 2001, 24 in 2002, 20 in 2003, 31 in 2004, 56 in 2005, 69 in 2006, 14 in 2007, 25 in 2008, 48 in 2009, and 23 in 2010. While the FAA has not released statistics, it was estimated that approximately 2,000 passengers were served in 2005. Overall, the highest number of movements it has gained yearly is 142,000 and lowest is 4,254 according to the WSDOT; the most based aircraft at the Omak Airport was 658 at one point.  Facilities = Geography and climate  The Omak Airport, a non-towered airport that covers an area of of city-owned property and overall at an elevation of , is located on 202 Omak Airport Road in Riverside, north of Omak's city centre, which is the municipality it primarily serves, situated off Washington State Route 20 and Washington State Route 97 on a mountainous and forested terrain. However, some people have stated it is based in Omak city limits regardless. It is located south of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border and opposite the Duck Lake, Fry Lake and Proctor Lake attractions, which are lakes based in the area; to the east of the airfield are mountain peaks. The nearest commercial airport is the Penticton Regional Airport, north in the Canadian city of Penticton. It is part of the Okanogan County minimum requirement district, and North Omak Business Park. Due to its location, the airport serves the Okanogan County as a whole, ‚Äì via Google News Archive and nearby communities outside of that county. This is one of three aviation services serving the Omak area, the others being Mid-Valley Hospital EMS Heliport, south,. Federal Aviation Administration. Retrieved February 5, 2013 and Wings for Christ Airport, southeast,. Federal Aviation Administration. Retrieved February 5, 2013 which are available for private use. Paid parking, taxis and car rentals are available, but there is no bus service. There are 34 tie-in parking spaces offered that are enlarged. The local and upcoming weather of Omak and Riverside is observed at its weather station, which provides real-time climatologically data, such as wind directions and speed using an automated surface observation system. The station determined that the Omak Airport itself experiences a semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk). With little precipitation, hot summers, and moderate winters, it annually handles of precipitation, an average high of , a daily mean of , an average low of and of snow. These statistics differ significantly from central Omak.  Runways and terminals  Food and snacks are available at this airport's terminal, as well as a medical facility, accommodation areas, administrative offices and hangar buildings maintained by the Omak City Council; some of these serve as pilot lounges, while three office spaces exist. There are also off-site buildings relating to the airport, several of which are used for storage purposes. The based aircraft obtain their fuel from Chevron Corporation, which is located on site and serves as an aviation dealer. This site is home to a self-service automated fuel pump system by the company which serves 100LL avgas, just outside the terminal, and credit card purchasing system. Per year, about of fuel are sold. There is also a FedEx Express drop- off box available for public use. when a performance survey was conducted for improvement, the airfield has a paved,Young (2011), p. 305 asphalt runway aligned 17‚Äì35 that is equipped with automated lights and maintains a published global positioning system non-precision approach approved by the FAA, making it the largest in the Okanogan County and third largest in Central Washington, that large aircraft and bomb tankers may land on. Military transportation rights have been secured for the airport. ‚Äì via Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File The runway, which is home to a non-directional beacon, is inspected occasionally by land development and transportation service organization WHPacific, is home to a full-length taxiway which was developed in 1997 and finished by 1999 in addition to a taxilane between hangar buildings in \\"fair to poor condition\\" according to the WSDOT. There is guidance provided on the runway for use by pilots who use it. Its orientation is determined by the direction of winds. Its freight volume includes of deplaned cargo and an enplane of . The airfield contains three apron areas, all of which are situated on the east side. The fueling apron is the southernmost apron in the airport, with a region with concrete anchors, while the central one is an asphalt tie-down. With a dimension of , the northernmost apron is covered by asphalt and is a tie-down. Funds for airport improvement in the future consists of $48,675.  Services  A private business instructor offers flying lessons at the airfield, while Omak Aircraft Services is based on site and offers airframe and powerplant repairs. Since August 2008 when a large fire occurred around Omak and surrounding communities, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) have been permitted to land large tanker aircraft and helicopters at it for firefighting purposes; this service frequents in the summer months. The critical aircraft, which refers to what the airfield was initially designed for and has landed at it at least 500 times, serves as the Cessna 208 Caravan according to WSDOT database records. The Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center, based in Auburn about away, manages traffic at the airport, in addition to all other airports in Washington and some selected airfields in other nearby states. There is a radio navigation aid provided at the Omak Airport which are used by pilots on aircraft coming from other nearby airports to determine their location. The navigation system is owned by the Omak City Council, operates 24 hours daily, and serves a number of surrounding airports that do not contain these aids. Other navigational purpose aids include a communication system, full-instrument landing approach system, lighted wind sock and segmented circle. A water system is situated at the Omak Airport as well, and there are proposals to improve it. While telephone service is provided by US West, power to the E-class airfield in Omak, is offered by the Okanogan County Public Utilities District. There have been proposals from the FAA to amend its E-class status by extending upward to an elevation of and removing its non-active navigation aid since January 2013. The FAA noted that the size and shape of the Omak Airport would still stay the same by using its airport reference point. According to them, the regulation would only involve technical facilities. Owned and operated by the Omak City Council, the airport contains a number of employees including manager Ken Mears. Having been surveyed by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey and part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it serves as a member of the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) for 2011‚Äì15, which categorized it as a general aviation airport, along with two other Okanogan airports: Anderson Field and Dorothy Scott Airport. The NPIAS has commercial airports, reliever and selected general aviation airports part of their system. The Omak Airport's revenue resources include fuel sales, landing fees and rental fees set by the Omak City Council. While aircraft fuel charges are $0.50 per gallon, landing fees are charged to commercial contact carriers who do not purchase at least of fuel for their respective airplane, typically $40 per month. Tanker aircraft are also charged for this reasoning unless they buy gas at a rate of $0.20 per of maximum depending on aircraft weight usually. In addition, there are hangar lease fees; all hangars are owned and operated by the Omak City Council with a $0.09 per square foot rate annually. In January 2012, there were plans for an airport technical maintainer to be obtained. After expressing this interest in improving their airport, the Omak City Council requested access to letters of interests from qualified consultants who would like to provide design and construction of it for a period of five years in April 2012\\\\. The Washington State Office of Minority & Women's Business stated that management offerings may also be included in what the consultant chosen must perform.  Airlines and destinations  Although this airport does not support direct commercial flights, it does provide three daily charter flights and general aviation services from Monday to Friday to other selected destinations, including the Pangborn Memorial Airport, by charter airlines such as Ameriflight and Empire Airlines.Thomas (1999), p. 300 For the 12-month period ending on May 30, 2012, the airport garnered 23,750 aircraft movements, 1,000 of which were for cargo use with an average of 63 per day for all of the movements,.

Federal Aviation Administration. Retrieved February 2, 2013. Of these aircraft movements, 3,600 of them were used for air taxi purposes, while 5,500 aircraft used it for local general aviation services; the aircraft operation count for itinerant general aviation was 14,500. Meanwhile, there were 150 military aircraft operations, meaning that based on all of these statistics, the following data was calculated: 61 percent used it for itinerant general aviation, while 23 percent used it for local general aviation; 15 percent used it for air taxi services and 1 percent for military purposes. There were also three based aircraft, all of which were single engined, and two enplanement passenger boardings as of 2011. Updated statistics for the Omak Airport are scheduled to be released in July 2013. Although statistics have not been released by the FAA, it has been thought that a number of services are provided for commuter passenger service by the Omak City Council. Packages can be delivered to other airports by FedEx and the United Parcel Service (UPS) using Cessna 208 Caravans and Beechcraft Model 18s from Empire Airlines, FedEx Express and Pierce Aviation; the second has a fuel contract with the Omak City Council. Lifeline Aviation also commonly uses the airport. There is no non-commercial landing fee.

It is situated between two canals. The name refers to the Mundair, one of the castes in Hinduism. The word Syedan, used in the local variant of the official name, refers to the Syed respectable family name in Islam. This was because the Syeds migrated here and purchased the land from Hindus and Sikhs. Today the majority of the population of the village is made up by Syeds. The two other neighbouring villages are named Mundair Khurd and Mundair Kothey . History The Kashmir hills to the north-east are dominant features in the area. The village was known as Mundair Kalan - Large Mundair). When Salim Ali Shah and his son Abdullah Shah Hazoori emigrated there, he purchased land for agricultural purposes. He also built residential houses in the area. The village contains shrines to the Sufi mystic Ahmad Hussain Gilani (1899‚Äì1961), and his sons and grandson, Muhammad Afzaal Ahmad Hussain Gilani (1926‚Äì1998), Iftikhar Ahamd Hussain Gilani (1936‚Äì2000) and Shah Hussnain Gilani (1989-1996). There are two government primary schools (one for boys and other for girls), three private factories and a couple of tuition centers and madƒÅris. The link road, connected to main Wazirabad Road, is called Mundair Syedan Road.

Thomson served as the First Lady of New Hampshire from 1973 until 1979 during the tenure of former Governor Meldrim Thomson, Jr. Early and personal life Thomson was born Anne Gale Kelly in Brooklyn, New York, in 1919. She was the oldest child of parents William and Anne Kelly. She graduated from high school two years early and took a position with the Edward Thompson Law Book Company, a law publishing company in Brooklyn. Kelly met her future husband, Meldrim Thomson, Jr., while she was working as a secretary at the Edward Thompson Law Book Company. The couple married in 1938 and had six children during their marriage - Peter, David, Thomas, Marion, Janet, and Robb. The family initially resided in Brooklyn and Stony Brook, New York. In 1954, Thomson and her husband decided not to raise their family in New York City. They moved with their six children to the Mt. Cube Farm, a 19th-century farmhouse in Orford, New Hampshire, in the fall of 1954, where Thomson and her husband lived for the rest of her life. As Mel Thomson's book editing company, Equity Publishing, grew, Gale Thomson largely ran the day-to-day operations of the farm and family. Political and business career Thomson became the First Lady of New Hampshire in 1973 when her husband took office. She was known to entertain guests with pancakes served with maple syrup collected at her Mt. Cube Farm in Orford. Gale Thomson (and her husband) used the breakfasts as a way to network and lobby legislators and businesspeople on behalf of her husband's political goals. She notably lobbied Greek magnate Aristotle Onassis, who had announced plans to construct an oil refinery in New Hampshire, reportedly winning him over with a bottle of Blue Nun, an inexpensive wine. Thomson remained First Lady until they moved out of Bridges House at the end of his tenure in 1979 after three consecutive terms. Gale Thomson remained a vocal supporter of Mel Thomson's policies, especially after his death in 2001. She was strong proponent of the former governor's tax policies, including \\"The Pledge,\\" in which he had promised to veto any state income tax or sales tax. Thomson also defended her late husband against charges of racism, including in a 2001 profile published in The \\"New Hampshire Century: \\"Concord Monitor\\" Profiles of One Hundred People Who Shaped It.\\" The former Governor had visited South Africa under apartheid rule, after leaving office and had come under fire for referring to the late Martin Luther King Jr. as a person \\"of immoral character\\" and a \\"leading agent of Communism.\\" Gale Thomson dismissed the accusations of racism against her husband, noting that he had appointed Ivory Cobb, the first African American judge in New Hampshire state history. The former First Lady published op-eds and other opinion pieces in the New Hampshire Union Leader. In 2000, Thomson, a prominent state political figure and activist, expressed concern that New Hampshire residents were beginning to ignore their responsibilities as the first state to hold a presidential primary. She told the Hartford Courant, \\"People are apathetic.... The working people here, for the most part, don't get too involved in the primary -- they're a little bored with it.... I was born the year that women were first given the chance to vote. It's not to be squandered.\\" In 2005, Gale Thomson, her son, Tom Thomson, and other homeowners drew international attention when their homes were levied with a so-called local \\"view tax\\" in Orford, New Hampshire. Gale Thomson's home, where she had lived at Mt. Cube Farm since 1954, was appraised with a new $100,000 tax assessment based on the panoramic view from the house. Gale Thomson joined with other property owners, including David Bischoff, to form the \\"Axe the View Tax\\" campaign to challenge the proposed \\"view factor\\" tax. Thomson told a British newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, \\"My husband would have been furious. He'd have supported these boys all the way.\\" Thomson ran a maple syrup business based out of her Mt. Cube Farm in Orford. Public and private sector philanthropy She served as a trustee of the Youth Development Center, the Robert Frost Farm in Derry, and the Vermont-New Hampshire Visiting Nurse Alliance. She was also an appointed member of the Governor's Lilac and Wildflower Commission, which was established by Governor John H. Sununu in 1984. 2008 presidential campaign In December 2007, Thomson endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney for U.S. President during the 2008 Republican presidential primaries. Romney and his campaign touted Gale Thomson's endorsement saying, \\"I am honored to have the endorsement of Gale Thomson, one of New Hampshire's most respected leaders. She and her husband faithfully served the people of the Granite State and worked to bring fiscally responsible policies to the State Capitol. I look forward to working with her to bring conservative change to Washington.\\" Romney had previously traveled to Thomson's home to meet with her on February 1, 2007, to seek her endorsement. Death and honors Gale Thomson died of congestive heart failure at her home at the Mt. Cube family farm in Orford, New Hampshire, on March 8, 2010, at the age of 90. March 8 - on what would have been her husband's 98th birthday. She was survived by her six children, eighteen grandchildren and twenty-eight great-grandchildren. New Hampshire Governor John Lynch ordered all state flags lowered to half-staff in her honor. Her funeral was held at the Baker River Bible Church in Wentworth, New Hampshire, on March 13, 2010.

It was used for the training of bombardiers, aerial gunners, anti-aircraft gunners, and others during World War II and the Korean War. The abandoned Sahuarita Flight Strip () is located in the southwestern corner of the range, and was used as an emergency flight strip until 1978. Before deactivation, the airspace over the range was protected by its own restricted area, R-310. History The range was completed by April 1942, shortly after the United States joined in the war, and was called the Sahuarita Bombing & Gunnery Range. It was located approximately twenty miles southeast of Tucson and about two miles east of Sahuarita. The range itself spanned 27,045-acres and consisted of multiple large round targets made of stone. Most of the range was located east of the town, although some areas that are now part of Sahuarita's northern end were also used. The Sahuarita Flight Strip wasn't opened until 1943. Before that time, the air crewmen who used the facility were flying out of Davis-Monthan Army Airfield. The Sahuarita airfield had twelve buildings and other structures, observation towers, a 5,540-foot paved runway, utility lines, and a range for radio-controlled aircraft operations. After World War II ended, the range was closed, but in 1950 it was reopened again and renamed the Sahuarita Air Force Range. Most of those who used the range at this time were bomber crews flying out of Carswell Air Force Base in Texas. After the Korean War, the Strategic Air Command kept the airfield in service as an emergency flight strip, even though it was \\"dangerously close\\" to the targets used for training. In 1978, the range was finally closed when the federal government released the lands to the public. The land is now owned by the State of Arizona, which has leased most of it to a cattle rancher. It was noted that in 1978, 2,550 acres of the range were cleared of explosive ordnance. Today, the site of the airfield id occupied by Walden Grove High School and the adjacent Sahuarita Park, although most of the flight strip remains intact. There have been \\"only a few\\" bombs found on the range over the years, as well as other objects that resemble bombs, but most of the bombs dropped by the military were actually \\"dummies,\\" which were filled with sand. However, officials from the Army Corps of Engineers say that there is still a chance that unexploded ordnance remains buried in the ground. Lloyd Godard, a project manager with the Corps of Engineers' Los Angeles regional office, said: \\"On any bombing range, there's always a chance that things could have gone under the surface... High explosives were used on one of the Sahuarita range target areas.\\" Gallery File:Sahuarita Air Force Range artifacts Arizona World War II Korean War.jpgArtifacts found at the former Sahuarita Air Force Range, including a 20 mm anti-aircraft gun casing and belt link, M2 bullets and casings, M1919 bullets, casings, and a machine gun belt link, M1 Garand bullets, casings, and a stripper clip, M1 Carbine bullets and casings, M1911 bullets and casings, a .22 bullet and casing, some unidentified casings, and an Mk 2 grenade pin.

Microsoft has developed a different JavaScript engine based on the JScript, for the newer Microsoft Edge browser (also called Chakra). The Chakra JavaScript engine has been open-sourced under the MIT license.  Features  A distinctive feature of the engine is that it JIT compiles scripts on a separate CPU core, parallel to the web browser. Though Microsoft has in the past pointed out that other elements, such as rendering and marshalling, are just as important for a browser's overall performance, their improvements to the engine were in response to evolving competing browsers, compared to which IE8 was lagging behind in terms of client-side script processing speed.  History  SunSpider tests performed on November 18, 2009 showed the PDC version of IE9 executing scripts much faster than IE8, but slower than Firefox 3.6, Chrome 4, and WebKit Nightly. The same test performed on March 15, 2010 showed the first IE9 Platform Preview (using the then-current version of Chakra) to be faster than Firefox (with SpiderMonkey), but slower than Safari (with SquirrelFish Extreme), Chrome (with V8), and Opera (with Carakan). On March 8, 2011, Microsoft published results showing the 32-bit Internet Explorer 9 to be faster than Safari, Firefox (with TraceMonkey), Chrome, and Opera.

Design and construction It had a horizontally mounted engine under the floor between the two axles allowing an entrance ahead of the front axle and a flat floor for its entire length and thus suitable for \\"one-man\\" operation., p. 7 The chassis then had a body mounted upon it by a bodybuilder, either a bus body , pp. 59, 64, 76, 88, 95, 96, 111, 123, 130, 131, 164, 193, 224, 231 bus bodywork on chassis with leaf springs or a coach body., p. 96, 100, 147 coach bodywork on chassis with leaf springs The MW replaced the earlier LS (Light Saloon) which was designed to be built into an integral bus or coach only by sister company Eastern Coachworks Ltd (ECW) based in Lowestoft. This prevented the sale of the mechanical underframe to other bodybuilders when a change in control of the company allowed this to happen. A few chassis were sent to Alexander at Falkirk to receive bodies to the specification of companies within the Scottish Bus Group. Unlike the earlier LS, which experimentally housed AEC , p. 53 LS with Rootes TS3 engine and Rootes TS3 , p. 53, 129 LS with AEC engine engines and the later RE experimentally using a horizontal and turbocharged version of Bristol's own BVW engine, all MW chassis were fitted with Gardner 5HLW (5-cylinder) or 6HLW (6-cylinder) engines. The chassis type designation was either MW5G or MW6G. These engines were deep in their horizontal form causing the floor height of the finished vehicle to be high, resulting in steep steps at the entrance. The transmission was by way of a manual 5-forward speed gearbox made by the company. It incorporated synchromesh cones, but these did not wear well and gear changing still required drivers to adjust engine to road speed. The rear axle was available in three ratios 5:1, 5.5:1 and 6:1. 5.5:1 was by far the most popular and 6:1 was the standard for bus versions built for Bristol Omnibus Company Ltd. The vehicle was built to the contemporaneous legal maximum limits of size, namely and . When regulations allowed longer () and wider (8 ft in or 2.5 m) vehicles, BCV did not extend this chassis and moved to a new concept with a rear engine. Despite this, as late as 1962, an option was designed to incorporate major modifications to the chassis to fit air springs instead of the traditional multi-leaf springs. The air sprung version was popular for chassis intended for coach bodywork,, p. 94, coach bodywork on chassis with air springs just before the 36 ft model for fitment to the RE chassis. Few customers specified air springs for bus versions. Bristol Omnibus Company was the main one and it was on the basis that the better suspension caused less stress and damage to the chassis and bodywork and reduced lifetime costs of operating the vehicles would outweigh higher initial purchase price. Their chief engineer at the time, Mr E Hardy, was sorely displeased when the option was withdrawn for the last year of production. MW with typical ECW coach bodywork There were some options for this chassis introduced later in production to improve fuel consumption and vehicle heating. This included the replacement of the underfloor radiator and its constantly engine driven fan by a front-mounted radiator with \\"Varivane\\" wax capsule operated radiator shutters backed up with a thermostatically controlled electric fan. The provision of an \\"exhaust-boiler\\" was also available. This had a temperature controlled valve which could divert the exhaust gas from the exhaust pipe through a heat exchanger incorporated into the engine cooling system, thus allowing quicker heating up to engine operating temperature and assisting passenger comfort in colder weather when the engine was not providing enough waste heat in the normal way. Some chassis were fitted with an exhaust brake for some time, though many so-fitted had the equipment removed later. In overall, a total of 1,965 Bristol MW chassis were built. Those with bodywork fitted by ECW were driven by road by a weather-swept crew of drivers. Rail transport was used for those going to Alexander. Sanctions Production of chassis was authorised by the Board of Directors of BCV in tranches by type, known as \\"sanctions\\". Each vehicle received a cast number plate which was bolted to the chassis in the form \\"135.001\\" being the first vehicle of the 135 sanction. This number was not always the same as the \\"build number\\" allocated by production control and not used after the chassis left the factory. The sanctions for MW chassis are summarised below. The details are taken from lists compiled from Bristol Commercial Vehicles records showing the customer, fleet number, registration mark for every chassis made and dates constructed and cross checked with individual fleet operators fleet lists. *135 ‚Äì 150 vehicles built December 1956 ‚Äì April 1958 *139 ‚Äì 300 vehicles built April 1958 ‚Äì April 1959 *152 ‚Äì 200 vehicles built April 1959 ‚Äì January 1960 *164 ‚Äì 200 vehicles built January 1960 ‚Äì December 1960 *184 ‚Äì 250 vehicles built December 1960 ‚Äì January 1962 *195 ‚Äì 200 vehicles built January 1962 ‚Äì November 1962 *204 ‚Äì 100 vehicles built November 1962 ‚Äì February 1963 (Air spring option fitted to chassis numbers 028-074, 079‚Äì083, 089‚Äì100) *213 ‚Äì 250 vehicles built February 1963 ‚ÄìOctober 1964 (Air spring option fitted to chassis numbers 001, 013‚Äì031, 039‚Äì041, 048‚Äì053, 066‚Äì070, 111‚Äì118, 123‚Äì134, 141‚Äì142, 151‚Äì158, 163‚Äì166, 173‚Äì188, 193‚Äì196, 201‚Äì205, 208‚Äì210, 214‚Äì215, 222‚Äì229, 234‚Äì239, 241‚Äì243, 246‚Äì248) *225 ‚Äì 150 vehicles built October 1964 ‚Äì January? 1965 (At least chassis numbers 001-075 were built with leaf springs) *233 ‚Äì 165 vehicles built 1966 to December 1966 See also * List of buses References=Bibliography * * MW Category:Bus chassis ","title":"Bristol MW"},{"id":"26638544","text":"LumoPro is a brand of lighting and studio equipment for amateur and professional photographers.

The formal ceremony at which the awards are presented is one of the most prominent award ceremonies and the highlights for the film industry in Malaysia and is televised live on local television, annually. It is considered to be Malaysia's own equivalent to the Academy Awards and it is one of the major annual awards presented in Malaysia, alongside the Anugerah Bintang Popular for the entire entertainment industry, and Anugerah Industri Muzik for the music industry. The events used to be hosted by the Persatuan-Persatuan Kebudayaan mainly in Singapore to recognise excellence in the film industry especially Malay films. Upon the establishment of the Entertainment Journalists Association of Malaysia, FFM was appropriately schemed and outlined in a way to help and oversee the progress of Malaysia's own Malay films, in which their production and direction by the Malaysian people itself would be able to compete with those of international films brought into the nation. The first Malaysia Film Festival (or FFM1) ceremony was held on 11‚Äì13 April 1980, at the Nirwana Ballroom, Hilton Hotels in Kuala Lumpur to honour outstanding film achievements during the period. The most recent ceremony, honouring films made in 2014 were held at Plenary Hall, KLCC, Kuala Lumpur on 5 September 2015. History The first awards were presented on 13 April 1980, at the Nirwana Ballroom, Hilton Hotels as a closing ceremony for the first festival ever in which the opening ceremony on 11 April, was being opened officially by the then Minister of Information, Tan Sri Mohammad Rahmat at the Federal Cinema of Kuala Lumpur. During this first awards and festival ceremony, only sixteen films were competing and awards were divided into three categories which are Heavy Drama (HD), Light Drama (LD) and Comedy (K). At the time of the hosting of the third ceremony, FFM was no longer being organised by Entertainment Journalists Association of Malaysia, but instead taken over by Malaysia National Film Development (FINAS) after the second organisation of the awards ceremony. FINAS stood alone in organising the next three ceremonies notably starting from 1982 up to 1984. In the beginning of the FFM6, the ceremony was once again taken over by a different organiser, this time by the Federation of Film Artistes‚Äô Association of Malaysia (GAFIM) after its establishment with the collaboration of FINAS. The FFM 7, which was held on 6 December 1987, was the first to be held outside of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. The event was held in Malacca. The first Best Actor category was won by Jins Shamsuddin for his performance in Tiada Esok Bagimu; while Azean Irdawaty took home the Best Actress trophy for her performance in Esok Masih Ada.  Trophy statuette = Design  The FFM main trophy's physical design consists of four pillars that merge to open the lock together at the top of the circle globe. Part of the base is engraved with each category winner. The pillars are made of gold coated pewter and are designed to resemble film rolls, symbolising the rapid growth of the local film industry. These four pillars also represent the four main stages of film production namely pre-production, production, post-production and promotion. The trophy is made of black acrylic, gold plated pewter and white acrylic. It stands at a height of 13 inches and a width of 4 inches. Awards contested Among the contested awards in the festival: Prime awards There are 13 contested awards: * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Film * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Director * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Actor * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Actress * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Screenplay * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Original Story * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Cinematography * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Editing * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Original Music Score * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Documentary * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Short Film * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Digital Film * Malaysia Film Festival for Best Animated Feature Film Creative awards There are 12 contested awards: * Best Supporting Actor * Best Supporting Actress * Best Art Direction * Best Sound Direction * Best Child Actor * Best New Actor * Best New Actress * Best Original Theme Song * Best Costume Designer * Best Poster * Best Comedy Film * Best Digital Film * Best Animated Feature Film * Best Fight Controversy=Backlash for Best Film and Best Non-Bahasa Film categories On 3 August 2016, the nominees list for the 28th Malaysian Film festival was revealed to the public. It came to attention that Jagat and Ola Bola, both of which were critically acclaimed and the latter being one of the highest grossing domestic films of all time, were disqualified from the Best Film category of FFM28 to be put instead in the Best Non-Bahasa Malaysia Film category. The reasoning given was that the films had not followed the criteria amount of the Bahasa Malaysia used, which is around 70 percent. The move was deemed to be undeserving and thus received intense backlash from both filmmakers and netizens alike, particularly from the Screenwriters Association of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor (PENULIS) whose president Alfie Palermo had lambasted it as \\"racist\\". Although the criticism for the categories is not recent (the 'Best Picture, non-Bahasa Malaysia' category had been established in 2011 where as the 'Best Screenplay' and 'Best Director' awards with the same subcategory were created in this award), this year's awards was the first time that the criticism for the categories had become so widespread. Further suspicions of favouritism and conflict of interest also aroused from the fact that the nominees were put forward by the head of the Malaysian Film Producers Society (PFM), Yusof Haslam, who also owns SKOP Productions where two entries for the Best Film Category, Mat Moto and Munafik happened to be produced. Yusof however denied such allegations, stating that it was FINAS's authority to elect juries for the awards. He had also offered to resign from the post next year should the problem persist. In expressing dissatisfaction for the list, director Afdlin Shauki had announced in his Facebook page on 4 August that he will boycott the festival. The move was lauded by CIMB Group chairman Nazir Razak and Air Asia CEO Tony Fernandes. The protest was also joined by cinematographer Mohd Nor Kassim, who was nominated for his work in Bravo 5, stating that the nominations' segregation by language \\"gave the impression that Malays were afraid of competing with non-Malays\\". Nor Kassim later returned his previously won awards, wrapped in a black plastic bag, to FINAS director Kamil Othman during the Tanya FINAS 2.0 forum in Kuala Lumpur. The assistant-general secretary of the Film Directors' Association of Malaysia (FDAM), Hafiz Ibrahim had also resigned in protest. On 6 August, Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Said Keruak stated to the press that he will meet up with FINAS officials over the increasingly volatile issue. On 11 August, Salleh Said had announced in a press statement to BERNAMA that the Best Film Category shall be open to all entries regardless of language. FINAS also decided to cancel all \\"Non-Bahasa Malaysia\\" subcategories for the Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture awards and create a new Best Picture in the National Language category in their place. This counterreaction however upset the Film Directors' Association of Malaysia (FDAM), where its secretary Datuk Rahim Awang announced that the guild will not take part in the ceremonies as the allowing of Bahasa and non-Bahasa films to compete in equal terms \\"was akin to insulting the Federal Constitution and showing disrespect to the Rukunegara\\". One of its excos and special project bureau head, Jeffrey Chiang submitted his letter of resignation to avoid association with the guild despite not agreeing himself with FDAM's stance. In 2017, FINAS's director-general Fauzi Ayob had announced that a new encompassing category called \\"Best Film\\" will replace the two aforementioned Best Film categories in upcoming future awards, stating in a press conference that \\"this move will allow all nominees to compete on equal grounds\\".

Observations The Council recalled that the arms embargo on Somalia does not apply to weapons or military equipment destined for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) or for assistance provided to develop security sector institutions in the absence of a negative decision by the Committee established in Resolution 751 (1992). The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Djibouti, Eritirea and Somalia was reaffirmed, as was the Djibouti Peace Agreement as a basis for a solution to the conflict. Concern was expressed at acts of intimidation against the Monitoring Group in interference in its work, and flows of weapons and ammunition supplies to and through Somalia and Eritrea in violations of the arms embargoes imposed in resolutions 733 and 1907 respectively were condemned as potential threats to international peace and security. All Member States were urged to refrain from any action in violation of the resolutions and that violators would be held accountable. The Council determined that the situation in Somalia, Eritrea's actions undermining peace and reconciliation in Somalia, as well as the dispute between Djibouti and Eritrea, continue to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region. Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council stressed that all countries should comply with the provisions of the arms embargoes against Eritrea and Somalia, reiterating its intention to consider further measures to improve the implementation and ensure compliance with the provisions. The importance of humanitarian aid operations was underscored, while the politicisation, misuse, and misappropriation of humanitarian assistance by armed groups was condemned, requesting states and United Nations agencies to put an end to such practices. The Council then decided to ease some restrictions and obligations under the international sanctions regime to enable the delivery of supplies and technical assistance by international, regional and subregional organisations and to ensure the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance, reviewing the effects of the provision every 120 days. In this regard, the United Nations Humanitarian Aid Coordinator for Somalia was requested to report every 120 days on the implementation of this provision. The mandate of the Monitoring Group was then expanded as follows: :(a) to continue tasks set out in previous resolutions; :(b) to investigate activities that provided revenues used to violate the arms embargoes against Eritrea and Somalia; :(c) to investigate the use of transport, routes, seaports, airports and other facilities in connection with violations of the arms embargoes; :(d) to continue collecting information relating to individuals and entities engaged in the above acts and present to the Committee for further possible measures by the Council; :(e) to make recommendations based on its investigations; :(f) to co-operate closely with the Committee on specific recommendations for additional measures to ensure compliance with the arms embargoes; :(g) to identify areas where the capacities of states in the region could be strengthened to improve facilitation of the implementation of the arms embargoes; :(h) to provide a midterm briefing to the Council via the Committee and report monthly on progress; :(i) to submit a final report 15 days before the termination of the mandate of the Monitoring Group. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was requested to secure financial arrangements to support the Monitoring Group. The Committee was required to make recommendations based on the reports of the Monitoring Group to ensure improved compliance with the arms embargoes and resolutions imposed by the Security Council on Somalia and Eritrea. All states in the region, including Eritrea and the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia were urged to co-operate with the Monitoring Group, allowing unimpeded access in order to complete its mandate.

The Values Voter Summit is hosted by the Family Research Council. There are numerous conservative organizations sponsoring or otherwise participating in the conference. In the most recent summit, 38 organizations and an audience of 2,000 people participated. The summit is usually held in September or October of each year. History The first summit was held in 2006. Among the key issues for values voters defined by the organizers are opposition to abortion and to same-sex marriage, and a strong national defense. The Los Angeles Times describes the conference as combination rally, revival meeting, political convention and bazaar.\\" The conference typically includes appearances from Republican potential presidential candidates vying for the support of the crucial social conservative base of the party.Vying for 'Values Voters' Featured guests at the summit have included right-wing commentators Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, in addition to numerous elected officials and other conservative figures. Co-sponsors of the event included other Christian political action groups, such as AFA Action (part of the American Family Association), the Heritage Foundation, Liberty University, Liberty Counsel and Gary Bauer's organization American Values. Starting with the second annual conference in 2007, the summit began holding its own presidential straw poll, similarly to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and other conferences. The winner of the first presidential straw poll, of about 5,776 votes, was former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who would later go on to be the runner-up of the 2008 primaries before winning the nomination in 2012. After a \\"civil war\\" over the inclusion of the gay Republican group GOProud led many conservative organizations and activists to boycott the 2011 CPAC, Politico reported that a group of conservative figures were beginning to organize to turn the Values Voter Summit into \\"a full-fledged rival to CPAC\\" by expanding its focus to include economic and national security issues. Several of the organizations that have been boycotting the CPAC are now sponsors or participants in the Values Voter Summit. The 2011 conference was held on October 7‚Äì8, 2011. All of the major 2012 Republican presidential candidates spoke except Jon Huntsman, Jr. All eight of them were subsequently included in the presidential straw poll, where Texas congressman Ron Paul won. However, his win was discounted by the Family Research Council. Businessman Herman Cain finished second, followed by former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum. The 2013 and 2014 conferences both saw the same two candidates in the top two slots for the presidential straw poll for the first time ever, with Texas senator Ted Cruz and former neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson in first and second, respectively. In 2013, Cruz had 42% to Carson's 13%, and in 2014, the gap shortened with Cruz taking only 25% to Carson's 20%. In addition, the 2014 poll marked the first time in the history of the summit that a vice presidential poll was held in addition to the presidential contest. Carson won that poll with 22%, followed by Cruz's 14% and Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal's 11%. With these two polls, Cruz set two records for the summit presidential polls; the first person to win more than one poll, and the highest percentage ever won in any poll since it started in 2007 (with his margin of 42% in 2013). The 2015 conference (the last one to be held before the 2016 Republican primaries began) was held from September 25 to September 27. This notably coincided with the announcement of the resignation of Speaker of the House John Boehner on the 25th. When Florida Senator Marco Rubio made the announcement, the entire audience erupted into applause at the news. Subsequently, the results of the presidential straw poll saw the same exact top three candidates for the second year in a row: Cruz once again came in first, with Carson in second, and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee in third. Businessman Donald Trump, then the frontrunner for the nomination in all major national polls, came in fifth place with only 5% of the vote. In October 2017, addressing the annual gathering for the third time, President Donald Trump became the first sitting president to do so and spoke for about thirty minutes.  Conflict with the Southern Poverty Law Center  In 2010 the Family Research Council, an important sponsor of the Summit, was included on the Southern Poverty Law Center's list of organizations designated by as anti-LGBT hate groups.

Its origins can be traced back to an experimental farm established at Moor Plantation, Ibadan on January 1, 1923 by the Nigerian Department of Agriculture. The School of Agriculture was established in 1955, and the two establishments were combined as the Eastern Nigeria Agricultural Research and Training Station (ARTS) in 1956, with headquarters at Enugu. In 1972, the institution assumed federal status as the Federal Agricultural Research and Training Station (FARTS). In 1976 it was renamed the National Root Crops Research Institute, coming under the Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria. In 1995, the training wing was split off as the Federal College of Agriculture, Ishiagu. The institute conducts research into genetic improvement of economically important root and tuber crops such as cassava, yam, cocoyam, sweet potato, Irish potato, ginger, rizga, Hausa potato, sugar beets and Turmeric. It also researches subjects such as crop cultivation techniques, storage, processing and utilization of the crops, concentrating on requirements of farmers in the south-east zone of Nigeria. The institute provides training of middle level agricultural workers, awarding National Diplomas and Higher National Diplomas and providing specialized vocational training to farmers. The institute has received funding from the Generation Challenge Program and the National Agricultural Research Systems to establish a modern laboratory for research into improvements to cassava genetics using molecular markers. The institute collaborates with other regional research centers through the Southern Africa Root Crops Research Network, funded by USAID.

The first reference to Jews living there was in 1245. The Jewish community was founded in the 14th century, because Besan√ßon was in this time a free imperial city, and it remained one of the only territories of France where the Jews were tolerated, after the expulsion of Jews from the Kingdom of France in 1394. However, they were expelled from Besan√ßon and a big part of Franche-Comt√© in the middle of the 15th century. The Jews came back to the city in the 18th century, but their situation stabilized only after the French Revolution. The apogee of the community was during the Industrial Revolution, in the 19th century, when the Lipmann family based Lip in the city. The Jewish community of Besan√ßon grew without interruption from that time, reaching 2,500 people at the eve of World War II. The importance of the community was recognized in 1881, when a decree authorizing the creation of a Central Consistory in Besan√ßon was signed. During the Second World War, the community of Besan√ßon, like other Jewish communities of France, was persecuted by the Nazi antisemitic policies. The Besan√ßon community was largely dispersed or destroyed over the course of the occupation of France. During the 1950s-60s, the arrival of Jews from North Africa brought vitality to the community. The Synagogue of Besan√ßon, the Jewish cemetery of Besan√ßon and the Castle of the Jews are evidence of the Jewish presence and contributions to Besan√ßon.

She is also known as Periyachi Amman (amman meaning \\"Mother\\") and sometimes called as Periyachi Kali amman and she is associated with another powerful goddess Kali. Periyachi is the protector of children and is associated with childbirth and pregnancy.Sinha p.303 Periyachi is usually associated with Hinduism in Singapore and Malaysia. Legend There was once a Pandya king named Vallalarajan Rajah who evilly tormented his subjects. It was said that if his child touched the earth then this act would bring an end to the king. When the queen went into labour, the king could not find a mid- wife. He had to choose a woman named Periyachi. This stern woman successfully completed the delivery of the child and held it up so that it did not touch the earth. The king wanted to kill the newborn, in the intent to preserve his own life. The king did not know that Periyachi was devi Parvati, so he was surprised when she took on her true form. Using her multiple arms she trampled the King underfoot. Then, she killed the king using her weapons . At the same time, the queen also wanted to kill the baby as she considered the innocent baby evil but periyachi amman killed the queen,ripped out her intestines and saved the baby hence periyachi amman is known as the protector of babies and expectant mothers. Iconography Periyachi is recognized by her eight arms and fearsome appearance. She is usually shown holding weapons and a child. She may hold a Trishula (trident), a noose, a damaru drum with a snake, a sword and a vessel filled with blood. She is often depicted as standing or seated with her feet on a disembowelled king. In the above illustration she is shown with her two front hands ripping open the abdomen and womb of a queen, who lies on her lap, and is chewing the queen's intestines as blood trickles from her mouth. Two of her hands hold the intestines and the king's evil child is held aloft in another hand. Her fierce appearance is said to ward off evil spirits. Roles Periyachi is considered a \\"kaval deivam\\" or guardian spirit. Other male kaval deivams like Muneeswaran and Madhurai Veeran are considered her guardians.Sinha p. 105 Periyachi, along with Jada-Muneeswaran, an aspect of Muneeswaran, are said to come on earth as a jodi (pair) to ward off evil spirits and guard the earth. Periyachi is said to punish women who do and say things to hurt others, and also punishes men who exploit women, by trampling them under her feet. She is also regarded as a protector of children. Worship Periyachi worshipped in Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore. During the third month of pregnancy - among the Tamil Hindu diaspora, the ceremony of Punsavana (\\"foetus protection\\") is performed, along with prayers to Periyachi to guard the mother and child against the evil eye. After that during the seventh month, the Simantonnyana (\\"bangle ceremony\\") is performed along with prayers to the goddess to ease labour pains and protect the mother and child during delivery. On the 30th day after childbirth, in a ceremony at home, a black sari, non-vegetarian dishes and auspicious things are offered to the goddess. Women pray to her to avoid misfortune to a newborn baby and mothers are expected to pray to the goddess after a safe child birth.Sinha p. 303 Then, on the first temple visit after childbirth, the parents dedicate their one-month-old babies to the goddess, placing the baby in front of the goddess on the ground or at her feet. The child's head has to be shaved and covered by yellow cloth. Everyone, except siblings of the baby, back off acknowledging the goddess's protection of the baby in the womb and for the first few months of its life. Then the priest performs usual rites to worship Periyachi. Worshipping the goddess for 12 Sundays by couples is said to grant them progeny. Tuesdays and Fridays are considered to be special auspicious days to worship Periyachi and Muneeswaran.Sinha p. 122 A festival called Periyachi Puja is held in the Tamil month of Aadi (Aati) to honour the goddess.Sinha p. 87 She is also worshipped in the Tamil month Thai. As part of her worship, an padaiyal offering, consisting of meat of the sacrificed animal as well as vegetarian dishes are presented to her and then given to devotees as prasad. Eating this prasad is believed to bring good luck and good health. During the period of the festival Thimithi, scenes from epic Mahabharata are enacted by the devotees and drama troupes. A week before the fire walking, they perform prayers to Periyachi. The prayer session is held to request her blessings upon the devotees and that no unpleasant incidents should happen during the festival.\\"Mahabharathathil Uruvaana thiruvizha,\\" by Radha Kasiramu. Tamil Murasu, October 2005, p. 3. Periyachi is also worshiped as a household or family deity by devotees.Sinha p.140 She is also said to possess some of her devotees.Sinha p. 126 Periyachi's shrines are found in the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore and Sri Maha Mariamman Temple,Kepong.

Although they were both full-time members of Little River Band, they released an album and three singles as a duo.  Background  Birtles and Goble had worked together since 1972, first in the band Mississippi and then in Little River Band (LRB). LRB had an abundance of songwriters, with Birtles, Goble, Glenn Shorrock and David Briggs all contributing hit songs. Birtles and Goble were prolific songwriters so, despite contributing to four LRB albums by 1978 (Little River Band, After Hours, Diamantina Cocktail and Sleeper Catcher), they had a wealth of material left over. Birtles noted that \\"we had so many good songs left over which the guys thought were unsuitable for Little River Band, that we decided to approach Glenn Wheatley with the idea of recording a duo album using our unwanted songs\\". The Last Romance was recorded with numerous musicians including current and future members of Little River Band. Birtles and Goble each wrote three of the songs, three songs were co-compositions and one track (\\"He Gives Us All His Love\\") was written by Randy Newman. The first single \\"I'm Coming Home\\" was a top ten hit in Australia and also sold over 100 000 copies in The Philippines. Birtles & Goble performed the song live on television programs such as The Don Lane Show and The Paul Hogan Show. The song earned Birtles and Goble a nomination for Best Recorded Songwriters at the 1979 Australian Pop Music Awards. Goble believes that the duo suffered from a lack of promotion: \\"If The Last Romance album had been successful, I expect that Beeb and I would have left Little River Band and recorded as a duo, e.g. 'Hall & Oates'. Our record company (Capitol) were concerned about this possibility and so our album received little support. It was a great experience to record The Last Romance and it remains one of my favorite recordings.\\" Birtles and Goble did not record again as a duo. Songs from The Last Romance were recorded subsequently by other artists: Mark Holden had an Australian top ten hit with the song \\"Last Romance\\", and The Imperials recorded \\"Into My Life\\". The third single from The Last Romance, Birtles' paean to his country of birth (\\"The Netherlands\\"), subsequently appeared in demo form as a bonus track on the 1997 re-release of the Little River Band album No Reins, showing just how close the song came to being released initially by LRB.

The word kafi, is of Arabic origin, used in the sense of \\"final\\" or \\"enough\\" in the expression ‚ÄúAllah Kafi‚Äù, which means, ‚ÄúGod Almighty is Supreme‚Äù. Thus the kafi is a devotional form of music composed in a particular form derived from a mixture of classical, semi- classical, and light music forms (specifically, the khayal, tappa, thumri, and geet). The mystic poetry of the Sufi saints is usually sung in this mode. There is a Punjabi variant of kafi singing. Like Sindhi kafi, the mood and the theme of Punjabi Kafi may also be termed as secular and humanistic. In their Kafis, Shah Hussain (16th century) and Bulleh Shah (18th century) have adopted a strategy to communicate their thoughts, serving the humanity in a powerful and effective way. The satirical tone of these kafis, sometimes, depicts true picture of political situations and social conditions of their own days. The Sindhi kafi is short, simple, and lucid in composition and tone. Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, a renowned Sufi saint and mystic poet of Sindh (d. 1752), contributed considerably to the development of the Sindhi kafi, writing many verses and composing tunes which he named ‚ÄúThe Sur of Shah Latif‚Äù. His tunes are still popular. The late Zahida Parveen was a master of kafi singing. Her daughter, Shahida Parveen, possesses her mother's command of the form and her devotional urge. Yet today's trends, and perhaps necessity, have led her away from kafis and towards the geet, the ghazal, semi-classical and folk forms. Abida Parveen is another renowned kafi singer of Sindh, but she, too, sings in many other genres.

Following a Court ruling, racing resumed in New York State but by then the financial problems arising from the law's effects resulted in the Gravsend track having gone out of business.

It was moved from its original location on SW 14th and Main to its current location in Goose Hollow in 1950 to make room for Lincoln High School's campus. It was purchased by preservationist Eric Ladd for $1,000 at auction and moved to its present location, along with two other houses Ladd was interested in preserving, at SW 20th and Jefferson, which was called \\"the colony.\\" Design and construction The house, completed in 1871, was designed for Jacob Kamm by architect Justus F. Krumbein, who was also involved in the design of the Oregon State Capitol. The construction was overseen by L. Therkelsen, and cost $80,000. While the French Second Empire style building suggests a stone or stucco exterior, it is actually built with flush horizontal siding and wooden quoins. The wooden shingles on the Mansard roof are scalloped to appear like slate. The building is approximately in three stories plus a basement, and contains six bathrooms. It was sited on Kamm's Goose Hollow 14th and Main property. The original address to the house was 488 Main Street; the city's streets were renamed in the early 1930s and the location became Southwest 14th and Main. Notable early features were central heating, using steam from a ship's boiler, and a rudimentary system of air conditioning, using cool air from the basement directed through the house through air pipes and cast iron vents. The air conditioning system was intact, but nonfunctional, as recently as 1974. In the 1970s, the house was remembered by Eric Ladd as being \\"well back from 14th Avenue\\", with a large magnolia, a flowering cherry tree, fruit trees, and a \\"century old black walnut\\". Adventure House/Junior Museum In 1946, a few years before the house was moved, The Oregonian said it \\"sits aloofly and well back from the fenced off streets\\", and said it had been continuously occupied, even though Kamm died in 1912 and his wife died in 1932. The Portland Children's Museum began in the house in 1946, then called the \\"Adventure House\\", and run by the Portland Parks & Recreation. By 1950, the museum was known as the \\"Junior Museum\\", and moved to a location in Lair Hill. The site was loaned to the Parks and Recreation Department from the Portland Public Schools, who already had plans for moving onto the site. By that time, the formerly rural area was \\"a community thickly populated, with houses and apartments closely spaced.\\" An article in 1950 stated the Junior Museum was \\"filled with boys and girls who have never climbed a tree before\\", and that weekly attendance was 400-600. 1950 move Quoin and horizontal siding detail In 1950, the house was moved to make room for Lincoln High School, which was moving from its South Park Blocks location, called Old Main. This was the third location for the school, which was the first high school in Portland and only the second in the West. The house was moved a short distance to Salmon and 18th in July 1950 for excavation of the high school and while Eric Ladd secured a final moving site. It was then moved to its 20th Avenue location around December 16, 1950, on wooden rollers, rather than wheels, since it was too heavy. The home was moved partway one day, and then was left standing on the road during a large storm. Since utility works was needed to disconnect and reconnect electrical lines crossing roads, the rest of the journey had to wait while utility crews repaired storm damage elsewhere in the city. The house was described as \\"barren and austere\\" by The Oregonian, which also noted its gas and electric chandeliers, decorative plaster wainscoting on the stairway flights, and inlaid hardwoods, though some rooms had been recovered in asphalt floor tiling. The move was coordinated by Allstate Construction. Two days before demolition on the house was to begin in 1950, Eric Ladd purchased the Kamm house for $1000 to move it to a colony of significant homes, later called the \\"Old Portland Colony\\", having three historic homes by 1965. The mansion was moved approximately to 1425 SW 20th Avenue on a lot. Ladd intended to make it into three apartments, but ran a restaurant known as the Kamm House Restaurant out of it for four years beginning in 1955. A 1955 society page spread in a June 1955 The Oregonian discussed how guests arrived at the home dressed in clothing reminiscent of \\"the [1880s] when Portland social life saw one of its gayest periods\\", including arriving by horse and buggy. The restaurant had opened for an Oregon Historical Society benefit and reception for patrons of the society, with dinner being $100 per plate and 80 patrons in attendance. The restaurant could not get a liquor license for the first year. After the first two years, Eric Ladd simplified operations, did all of the baking for the restaurant himself, but still had to close the restaurant after another two years. Eric Ladd (1921-2000) was called \\"the idiosyncratic Portlander who was in the forefront of historic preservation\\" by The Oregonian at his death in 2000. He received an award from the Portland Beautification Association, inscribed \\"The Tenacious Preservationist\\". The Old Portland Colony also contained a replica of Abraham Lincoln's Springfield, Kentucky home, built for the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. The Lincoln home was opened as a museum and a sandwich shop in about 1956, but had a large fire some time later. By 1958, Eric Ladd was distracted by the Pittock Mansion, where he had moved. 1960s decline Called an \\"ailing home\\" in 1965, the home was \\"just the skeleton of the home Jacob Kamm built\\". It contained furnishings from other Portland landmarks. Notably, the \\"carved oak lobby pilasters\\", paneling, leaded glass, bottle window, \\"turkey red and black carpets\\", bold red drapes, and \\"ornamental ironwork from the courtyard\\" came from the Portland Hotel. It also contained \\"burled ash panelling from the great hall of the Knapp house\\", a large Stick-Eastlake style home in Portland's Nob Hill, erected in 1882 and demolished in the 1950s. In 1965, mayor Terry Schrunk and the city council inspected the homes, as Eric Ladd was trying to preserve the homes and raise funds in a manner similar to the fundraiser organized for the Pittock Mansion in 1962. Eric Ladd lived in the home from 1963 until at least 1965. In 1967, the home contained furnishings from John Henry Belter. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 5, 1974. A report from 1971 discussed > Upon entering the house, cold chilling air greets you. The sound of dripping > water draws attention to the gigantic parlor living room area. The water > streams profusely from the ceiling on to the expensive red carpeting. No one > has been able to find the leak, so it is left to continue soaking the > carpet. There is no container to catch the water. The Portland Historical Landmarks Commission voted unanimously in June 1982 to recommend to the City Council that the house be made a landmark. Peter Hoffman, owner of the house since 1979, announced the property was for sale at a meeting to make the house a landmark on September 9, 1982. The announcement caught the Landmarks Commission off guard. The home was \\"still for sale\\" by October 1982, and was on commercial land, meaning it was not being used for apartments. On November 3, 1982, the Portland City Council voted on whether to make the house a landmark. The owner of the property, Peter Hoffman, originally supported landmark status, but requested it not be made a landmark, as he felt it would impede his efforts to sell the house. The council voted against designating it a landmark, with Frank Ivancie and commissioner Mildred Schwab being the only votes to accept it as a landmark. By October 2009, the home had received Portland Historic Landmark status. Current upright The home was sold to the Kamm House Partnership (William J. Hawkins III, Ron Emmerson) by 1984. It contained both apartments and offices at that time, including a national office for the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Project. It is currently home to the Alliance fran√ßaise de Portland, who hosts the annual Bastille Day festival at Director Park. Legacy In their survey of classic Portland homes, Hawkins and Willingham stated the home was > Portland's singular remaining great mansion from the decade of the 1870s ... > the most proper design in the style.. [it] is handsomely proportioned, > clearly imitating stone construction in wood. It has no tower, but the > mansard roof is a distinct attribute, probably the closest in design to > those in France. Bart King's An Architectural Guidebook to Portland states > \\"A somewhat daunting structure, the Jacob Kamm House may qualify as the > city's first real mansion. It has dramatic quoined corners, arched and > elongated windows with keystones, and expressive baroque dormers in the > mansard roof. Alone on a dead-end street, it seems to look reproachfully at > an area developed in a hodge-podge manner.

Built under the guidance of Dr. N. S. Vyas, it is a nanosatellite which will be used to provide data for agriculture and disaster monitoring. It is a spacecraft, which measures in length by in height and width. Its development programme cost around 25 million rupee. It has a design life of one year. Jugnu was launched on 12 October 2011 into low Earth orbit by a PSLV-CA C18. Subsystems=Imaging This Subsystem captures near IR images of targeted surface on earth which helps in identification of the utilization of the place. The subsystem consists of a \\"Near IR camera\\", an external storage and an On-Board Computer(OBC) which acts as an interface between the two, apart carrying out the image compression/processing. The camera captures a 640X480 px image which is then transferred to an external memory by the OBC. The image is then processed (if required) and transmitted to the ground station. An overall resolution of about 161 X 161 m2 per pixel is expected on earth's surface. The total area of view, on earth's surface is expected to be around 103 X 77 km2. GPS The GPS payload in Jugnu helps in synchronizing the time of OBC from the time data retrieved from the GPS module. The Orbital Parameters from the GPS is fed into the ADCS system which assists in satellite positioning from time to time. ADCS The Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) orients the satellite in a manner such that maximum solar energy is incident on its solar panels. During imaging the satellite must point at a fixed location on earth in order to capture high-quality images, which is accomplished by the ADCS. Control by the ADCS is necessary to ensure that the antennas, which have narrow beams, are pointed correctly towards the earth. Gravitational forces from the sun, moon, and planets; solar pressure acting on the antennas and satellite body; and magnetic fields create rotational disturbances. Since the satellite moves around the earth's center in its orbit, the forces described above vary cyclically. This tends to set up nutation of the satellite which is damped using ADCS. Thermal The Thermal Control Subsystem(TCS) maintains the temperature within the specified limit of 298K to 323K. It ensures that no large thermal gradients and no excessive thermal stress across the structures occur. The Thermal control subsystem of JUGNU is essentially passive with MLI sheets, OSR and surface coatings as key components. It also has IC and thermocouple based sensors to provide for the feedback and maintain the health of sensitive IC's and Camera. The heat that is produced at the chip level is rapidly distributed to the system to prevent it from getting damaged. Other Subsytems Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) system is used to measure vibrations in the satellite and angular rate of the satellite which is used to test the performance of the MEMS based sensors and to provide position and orientation data to OBC. Ejection Subsystem is the interface between the satellite and the rocket. It is a box like structure that is bolted on the deck of the rocket nose top with the satellite placed inside that box. It separates from the rocket with small initial velocity imparted by a spring sitting at the base of the ejection system. It is an indigenous ejection system which can be used for future launches. Mission Goals and Objectives The main goal of the mission was to make a Nano Satellite at IIT Kanpur that can be used as Micro Imaging Systems, GPS receiver for locating the position of satellite in the orbit and MEMS based Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU). The Primary Objectives of the mission were: # To initiate research activities towards development of MEMS based Nano-satellite. # To test new cheap solutions for the future cost effective space missions. # To set the path for future up gradations and study such validation concepts for possible up gradations. Its long term objectives were: # To develop competence in design, fabrication and usage of micro satellites. # Complement the development efforts of India's satellite application requirements through technology development and validation at the micro satellite level. # Development and training of human resources. # Strengthen activities in MEMS sensor based technology applications.
