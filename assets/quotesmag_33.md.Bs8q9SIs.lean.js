While their music covers a range of styles and genres, they are generally referred to as an indie rock group. The band has had a rotating cast over the years, but the primary members are currently Brad Postlethwaite (vocals, guitar/piano), Nahshon Benford (horns, flute), Jeff Hulett (drums), Tim Regan (vocals, guitar/piano), Brandon Robertson (bass), and Luke White (vocals, guitar). Biography Snowglobe was formed in Athens, GA in 1999 and was heavily influenced at that time by their interactions with the Elephant 6 collective. Brandon Robertson and Jeremy Freeze (the original guitarist) remained in Athens for several years, living with members of the Olivia Tremor Control and Elf Power. The rest of the band, however, migrated shortly back to their hometown of Memphis TN. Upon arriving in Memphis, Brad Postlethwaite moved in with Jeff Hulett and Jay Reatard. Hulett played drums for a local band called Palindrome. Reatard was working with Alicja Trout in the \\"Lost Sounds\\" at that time. Though they never played with Snowglobe, Reatard and Trout influenced some elements of the band's sound and production as Snowglobe began integrating synth and keyboards into their music. Sometime around the end of 2000 and beginning of 2001, Snowglobe's line up changed. Jeff Hulett replaced Brian Winterrowd on drums, and Tim Regan (in Liftoff at the time) joined as a co- songwriter.http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/snowglobe/artist.jhtml In addition, the original bassist (Brandon Robertson) moved back to Memphis and Nahshon Benford started playing horns for the band. With this lineup they wrote some new material, reworked old Snowglobe and Liftoff songs, and compiled a list of 25-30 songs to record. Through process of elimination, the list got trimmed down to a 16 track long album, which became the band's first official release on Bardot records in 2002. The album, titled \\"Our Land Brains\\", was critically acclaimed in the indie press, and charted in the CMJ top 40.http://prod1.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=34322 Over the next few years, Snowglobe continued to tour the United States. Initially, their touring lineup was somewhat stripped down, described in 2002 by the Washington Post as \\"standard pop-rock issue--4 guys with guitars and drums...(and) lovely harmonies throughout.\\"Meyer, Marianne, The Washington Post, June 27, 2002, accessed November 6, 2010. Over the years, Snowglobe's live show began incorporating horns, samples, and many of the other nuances present on their recordings. Snowglobe wrote and recorded their second record Doing the Distance which came out in 2004.http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/snowglobe-doing.shtml In late 2006 and early 2007, Brad Postlethwaite started Medical School and Tim Regan moved to Austin, TX and began touring with Oh No Oh My. Luke White, of \\"the Coach and Four\\" and \\"Colour Revolt\\", also joined the band at this time. Snowglobe's next record, Oxytocin, did not feature any of Regan's songs. He soon returned to Memphis, however, to begin work on the band's new EP and full length before returning to Austin TX. 2009 was a busy year for Snowglobe. They were featured in MTV's $5 Coverhttp://www.mtv.com/fivedollarcover/memphis/index.jhtml Memphis series, directed by Craig Brewer (Hustle and Flow), and they released an EP titled \\"No Need to Light a Night Light on a Night Like Tonight.\\" In May 2010 Snowglobe released their latest full length \\"Little More Lived In\\". In a review of this latest album Pitchfork exclaimed Snowglobe's style of emotionally straightforward, heavily arranged music has become one of the defining sounds of indie rock.

It was the first maritime boundary treaty in the Central America/Caribbean region to be based on the rules of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. The treaty was signed in Paris on 7 September 1987. The text of the treaty sets out two boundaries. The first boundary separates Dominica from Guadeloupe to its north. The boundary is long and is a simplified equidistant line that runs through the Dominica Passage in roughly an east‚Äìwest direction. It consists of seven straight-line maritime segments defined by eight individual coordinate points. The more southern boundary separates Dominica from Martinique to its south. The boundary is long and is a simplified equidistant line that runs through the Martinique Passage in roughly an east‚Äìwest direction and roughly parallel to the first boundary. It consists of five straight-line segments defined by six individual coordinate points. The treaty came into force on 23 December 1988 after it had been ratified by both states. The full name of the treaty is Agreement on Maritime Delimitation between the Government of French Republic and the Government of Dominica.

It has high thermal conductivity (180‚Äì200 W/m K), and its thermal expansion can be adjusted to match other materials, e.g. silicon and gallium arsenide chips and various ceramics. It is chiefly used in microelectronics as substrate for power semiconductor devices and high density multi-chip modules, where it aids with removal of waste heat. Several variants exist: *AlSiC-9, containing 37 vol.% of A 356.2 aluminium alloy and 63 vol.% silicon carbide. Its thermal conductivity is 190‚Äì200 W/m K. Its thermal expansion roughly matches gallium arsenide, silicon, indium phosphide, alumina, aluminium nitride, silicon nitride, and Direct Bonded Copper aluminium nitride. It is also compatible with some low temperature co-fired ceramics, e.g. Ferro A6M and A6S, Heraeus CT 2000, and Kyocera GL560. Its density at 25 ¬∞C is 3.01 g/cm3. *AlSiC-10, containing 45 vol.% of A 356.2 aluminium alloy and 55 vol.% silicon carbide. Its thermal conductivity is 190‚Äì200 W/m K. Its thermal expansion roughly matches e.g. printed circuit boards, FR-4, and Duroid. Its density at 25 ¬∞C is 2.96 g/cm3. *AlSiC-12, containing 63 vol.% of A 356.2 aluminium alloy and 37 vol.% silicon carbide. Its thermal conductivity is 170‚Äì180 W/m K. It is compatible with generally the same materials as AlSiC-10. Its density at 25 ¬∞C is 2.89 g/cm3. AlSiC composites are suitable replacements for copper- molybdenum (CuMo) and copper-tungsten (CuW) alloys; they have about 1/3 the weight of copper, 1/5 of CuMo, and 1/6 of CuW, making them suitable for weight-sensitive applications; they are also stronger and stiffer than copper. They can be used as heatsinks, substrates for power electronics (e.g. IGBTs and high-power LEDs), heat spreaders, housings for electronics, and lids for chips, e.g. microprocessors and ASICs. Metal and ceramic inserts and channels for a coolant can be integrated into the parts during manufacture. AlSiC composites can be produced relatively inexpensively (USD 2-4/lb in large series); the dedicated tooling however causes large up-front expenses, making AlSiC more suitable for mature designs. Heat pipes can be embedded into AlSiC, raising effective heat conductivity to 500‚Äì800 W/m K. AlSiC parts are typically manufactured by near net shape approach, by creating a SiC preform by metal injection molding of an SiC-binder slurry, firing to remove the binder, then infiltration under pressure with molten aluminium. Parts can be made with sufficient tolerance to not require further machining. The material is fully dense, without voids, and is hermetic. Its high stiffness and low density suits larger parts with thin walls such as fins for heat dissipation. AlSiC can be plated with nickel and nickel-gold, or by other metals by thermal spraying. Ceramic and metal insets can be inserted into the preform before aluminium infiltration, resulting in a hermetic seal.Mark Occhionero, Richard Adams, Kevin Fennessy, and Robert A. Hay, Aluminum Silicon Carbide (AlSiC) for Advanced Microelectronic Packages , IMAPS May 1998 Boston Meeting AlSiC can be also prepared by mechanical alloying. When lower degree of SiC content is used, parts can be stamped from AlSiC sheets. The aluminium matrix contains high amount of dislocations, responsible for the strength of the material. The dislocations are introduced during cooling by the SiC particles, due to their different thermal expansion coefficient. A similar material is Dymalloy, with copper-silver alloy instead of aluminium and diamond instead of silicon carbide. Other materials are copper reinforced with carbon fiber, diamond- reinforced aluminium, reinforced carbon-carbon, and pyrolytic graphite.

It was founded as a non-profit financial service cooperative dedicated to helping its members get ahead financially. After Tyco International acquired Raychem in 1999, it changed its name and expanded its field of membership to include all Tyco International employees. In 2007 Tyco Electronics and Tyco Healthcare were divested from Tyco International. This modified Reach CU's field of membership to include the three separate organizations Tyco International, Tyco Electronics (now TE Connectivity), and Tyco Healthcare (now Covidien). By 2013, due to divestitures, mergers and acquisitions by its corporate sponsors, the credit union's field of membership now includes ADT, Atkore, Covidien, Elo Touch Solutions, Mallinckrodt, Pentair, TE Connectivity and Tyco International employees and their families.

It was released in Japan on November 12, 2009 and in North America on May 25, 2010. Gameplay The player progresses by traveling through Fields, fighting enemies in random encounters along the way. For every battle won the player earns Force Points (FP), which can be used for various purposes including upgrading Ragnafacts (sacred weapons), creating Forcefacts (sacred armor) and restoring the party mid-dungeon. Items and equipment too require FP to create, and cannot be bought in a shop. Some items can be created by fusing them with the right material items, which are harvested from Harvest Points found within a Field. The Harvest Points will regenerate after the player has fought roughly 3-5 battles, spawning items ranging from common to rare. Hidden treasures and secret events can be unveiled by interacting with non-playable characters, other items can be unlocked by progressing through the story. Hexyz Force employs a dual protagonist system, which enables the game's world and story to be portrayed through both characters' perspectives. Plot Long ago, Norvia, the Goddess of Creation, descended from the heavens. Using the Holy Vessel, a divine chalice charged with all Force (the spiritual energy in the universe), she created life and the Divinities, shepherds of existence. After some time, Delgaia, the God of Destruction, brought about a great calamity known as the Gods' Remorse. He intended to return all Force to the Holy Vessel, returning Berge to the void. The Divinities sacrificed themselves to defeat Delgaia, delivering Berge from doom and sealing the God of Destruction away deep within the earth. As Berge lay in ruin, a result of its bitter war, Norvia made a covenant. She would restore Berge to its former beauty on one condition. An Hour of Judgment would eventually come to pass, then the world would have to decide its ultimate path: creation or destruction. The game revolves around two main protagonists: Cecilia, a young cleric from the Holy Temple of Palfina, and Levant, a Member of the elite Cerulean Knight of Rosenbaum Kingdom. Cecilia's mission is to find all the Monoliths scattered all around Berge, while Levant's mission is to find the culprit behind the war between Halbmenschen (half-Humans) and Humans. Both travel their separate ways though they cross paths on their journeys. Characters *Levant von Schweitzer: age 19. A Cerulean Knight who is asked by his king to help bring an end to the warring of the different races (Humans and non-Humans). Sometime during the peace treaties, an assassination occurred that throws the Rosenbaum Kingdom in disarray. During the fire in the Spirit Forest, he helps some of the elves to escape. He ends up imprisoned and forced to rely on a group of human-hating rebels called Argent. From there, he tracks down the culprit on the assassination. He wields the Ragnafact of Argent (Holy Krauvando), the divine Pillar of the Crimson Lotus. Levant is voiced by Keith Silverstein in English. *Cecillia Armaclite: age 17. A lazy cleric from the Holy Temple of Palfina. Though she serves the respected Great Temple of Palfina, she often puts off her duties. She's been known to lounge around eating and sleeping instead. Everything changes though, when she instinctively summons a legendary staff to defend herself from invading monsters. According to her superior, this deems her a Hexyz (known as the Maiden of the Staff) and as such she is charged with protecting the Monoliths. These Monoliths, if destroyed, will free the God of Destruction from his prison. She wields the Ragnafact of Palfina (Holy Riafalt), the divine Pillar of the Pearl Light. *Axel Faulken von Rosenbaum: age 28. The Emperor of Rosenbaum who became evil due to the assassination of his fianc√©e Natulle. He dreamt of uniting all the Halbs(non-Humans) and Humans by marrying Natulle of the elves. When the assassination occurred, he blames the Halbs and declares war against them. At some point in the game, Cecilia and Levant defeat him and he realizes his mistakes. He wields the Ragnafact of Illnada (Holy Bluebeide), the divine Pillar of the Cerulean Flame. *Irene von Rosenbaum: age 18. Princess of the Empire of Rosenbaum and Levant's childhood friend. Though she is the sister of Axel, she cannot ascend to the throne. This is because she is an illegitimate child; a daughter of the former Emperor and a commoner. Cecilia and Ralu love making comments about her, especially her funny hair. She wields the Ragnafact of Verse (Shinecrail), divinity of Pearl Light. *Griek: age 34. a Lygar warrior and Captain of the Argent Resistance. He's very strong and loves battle and a drink called Iygarwasser. Though very bashful, he has his soft side. He can also read ancient scripts. He wields the Ragnafact of Grepes (Runeslave), divinity of the Crimson Lotus. *Rafael Gemini: age 15. Luffina's twin brother whom he cares for deeply. He's known to be very passionate, and he sometimes acts as Cecilia's conscience during her travels. He seems to have an interest with Cecilia. He wields the Ragnafact of Dualis (Grantein), divinity of the Crimson Lotus. *Luffina Gemini: age 15. She is a seer and is able to see through the future. She gets kidnapped by Faust, who turns her into a zombie. Cecilia and Rafael, with the help of Gardner, release her from Faust's control by using Necrozauwar. She wields the Ragnafact of Aliete (Algenteria), divinity of the Pearl Light. *Ignus: a 1600-year-old Drake who travels the world. He becomes the leader of the tribe after defeating Virtus. His hobby is enjoying folktales, and he can listen for hours (a proof of this is listening to Philia for 10 years). At some point in the game, he becomes a dragon and defeats Virtus for good. He wields the Ragnafact of Skolg (Vandild), divinity of the Crimson Lotus. *Ciel: age 18. A shy elf who served as the guardian of the Altar of Argent. She joins Argent to avenge her sister Natulle. She wields the Ragnafact of Ellge (Luftshetelune), divinity of the Pearl Light. *Faust: A scientist and powerful Hexyz who seeks the Necrozauwar, a powerful magic book. Since Gardner hid the book from him, Faust constantly attacks Gardner and those he loves. He later reveals that obtaining the book is part of a plan to overthrow the gods. To Faust, the gods keep humans on a short leash, demanding that they never can rival them in power or knowledge. He believes that deep down, the other Hexyz sympathize with this ideology. *Azul the Off-Worlder: A being who resembles a child, but is said to be the sole reason humans overstepped their bounds. He is responsible for introducing teachings to the people that rival the gods. He is also the mastermind behind the actions of Virtus and Faust in their quest for god-like power and knowledge. Sadistic and sarcastic, he constantly belittles the heroes and confesses to enjoying causing their loved ones pain. He had a hand in Cecillia's mother's death. Living in Azul's dark magic is Galiza. Galiza is a being that Azul partnered with whiled sealed away by Delgaia. Galiza sympathizes with Azul's hatred towards the gods and also believes that the gods simply want mankind to stay under their thumb and never progress beyond them. Azul and Galiza only show compassion to Philia who kept them company while they were sealed away. Even though both are extremely intelligent (having out-smarted Norvia and Delgaia once) they act very childishly when under stress. *Virtus: A Drake who claims to want to free his kin from a life of hiding in the shadows of society, but actually is obsessed with gaining power. He wants power because he believes it will bring him closer to his god, the Black Dragon. He mainly has a rivalry with Ignus, dating back to their days to competing for the seat of tribal leader. But now he works with Faust and Azul to gain power over his people in order to use them as pawns. *Philia: Daughter of both the Goddess of Creation and God of Destruction, whom she refers to as \\"Mom\\" and \\"Dad\\". She manages to both help and tease the other Hexyz while remaining a mystery. When asked why she doesn't fully explain herself, a lot of times she replies \\"a woman is more interesting when she's mysterious\\". As an ally she provides them with knowledge no one else knows. She even seems to know the extent of Azul's power when Cecillia asks her about him. Her task though, is to simply continue the cycle of making sure reborn Hexyz gather together and reach the time of judgement, for better or worst. She even says that regardless of which they choose, Creation or Destruction, she'll be satisfied. She often refers to all the heroes by the name of the Force they inherited. She used to care for Azul and kept him company while he was sealed away for angering the gods. But now that he's resurfaced as a sadistic madman, she's broken ties with him. *Natulle: An Elven Hexyz like Cemnal and Ciel (her younger sister). She was to wed Axel, but was assassinated instead. Faust revives her with the Forbidden Arts and brainwashes her into a sadistic dominatrix. She assumes the name Velvet and works as Faust's minion. She also breaks the monoliths and controls some of the Rosenbaum army. The brainwashing is tied to a mask she wears. Though even when removed, the spell isn't completely broken. Cecillia becomes greatly annoyed with her due to her scantily clad dressing style and sociopathic nature. *Cemnal: The Elven leader living in Dark Berge. He leads the heroes to different sites where they learn more about Dark Berge and the villains manipulating the people. He even tells them how war broke out between the Humans and the other races (Elven, lygars, etc.). He attempts to oppose Azul after pretending to be on the Off-Worlder's side. *Elda: The mace wielding leader of the cleric in Lustrous Berge. She was good friends with Cecillia's mother and entrusted with Cecillia's life after her mother's death. Widely respected for her knowledge on history and the religious teaching of the Goddess, Elda is a trusted ally of the heroes. Reception Hexyz Force received average reviews. Michael David of GameZone praised the game's sound effects saying that \\"the thundering magic that looks so good, also sounds pretty good.\\" Some reviewers, however, have criticized the game's lack of challenge saying that the game can be finished within a day or two.

The original 12th- century castle was built by Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland, upon a river islet known as the King's Inch. This was replaced in the 13th century with a new castle by the road to the Clyde ferry, which became a royal castle under King Robert II. In the 15th century, the King's Inch site was rebuilt as Inch Castle by Sir John Ross. Both castles were demolished in the 18th century and nothing remains above ground at either site. History=12th century castle The King's Inch was formerly an island in the River Clyde, and was among the lands granted to Walter fitz Alan by King David I in the mid-12th century, when Walter was also made first hereditary Steward of Scotland. The castle was constructed from wood with stone foundations, and may have been a motte. The strategic location of this castle was designed to prevent the eastward expansion of Somerled's lordship in Argyll and the Isles. Renfrew Castle In the 13th century the Stewart family, descendants of Walter fitz Alan, constructed a new residence at the north end of the old High Street of Renfrew. This castle has been attributed to James, 5th High Steward (died 1309). It was captured by the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, and King Edward I of England granted Renfrew to Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, in 1301. In 1310 King Edward II of England ordered that the castle and burgh be sacked after he spent one night at the castle. Renfrew was then given in a charter by Edward Balliol to David de Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl, in 1332. The Stewarts with the help of Sir Colin Campbell of Lochow later recaptured Renfrew Castle. Robert, 7th High Steward, is traditionally said to have been born at Renfrew Castle. On his accession as King Robert II in 1371, the castle became a royal residence. The castle was visited by monarchs including James IV, who stayed there when visiting Paisley Abbey. In the 18th century, the castle was dismantled and the stone used to build soap works. This was replaced by Castlehill House, which was itself demolished, and the ground now forms a playground surrounded by modern buildings. The name Castlehill Gardens and a low mound can still be seen, though excavations in 1997 discovered no evidence of the castle other than pottery sherds dated to the 12th-14th centuries. Inch Castle In the later 15th century the King's Inch was granted to Sir John Ross, who built a new castle over the ruins of Walter's motte. Known as Inch Castle, this building was occupied by the Ross family until 1732, and in 1760 was sold to Andrew Spiers of Elderslie. Spiers demolished the castle and constructed Elderslie House in 1777, which was in turn demolished in 1924. The rebuilt castle had four stories and was topped by crow-stepped gables. There was a central stair- tower, corbelled out above the first floor.Coventry, Martin (2001). The Castles of Scotland. Musselburgh: Goblinshead. p. 209 The King's Inch is no longer an island, being on the south bank of the Clyde, and Braehead Power Station was built over the area in the 20th century. This too has since been demolished and the exact location of Inch Castle is now uncertain, though it lies somewhere in the Braehead development area. Investigations in 2005 identified the foundations of Elderslie House at grid reference , as well as features on the same site that could represent the 15th-century castle.

It grows in the southern part of the Amazon basin in the central area of Bolivia, but has recently been planted on a commercial scale in Burdekin, Australia. The fruit took third place in the 2012 Fruit Logistica Innovation Awards held in Berlin. Appearance The achacha has an appealing colour and form and is very decorative. It is egg-shaped, up to 6 cm long by 4 cm in diameter. It takes on a reddish-orange shade when mature. There is usually one significant coffee- coloured seed, but larger fruit may have more than one seed. Eating the fruit The taste is described as both bitter and sweet and is somewhat reminiscent of lemonade. The rather tough, bitter rind can be split open with a knife or with the teeth, and the edible part of the fruit sucked off the seed. The Queensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has found that the fruit keeps well for four to six weeks as long as it stays out of the fridge. It recommends storing the fruit at 15 to 20 degrees Celsius with a high relative humidity. If these conditions are not met, the fruit will shrivel. The glossy orange rinds of the achacha may be put in a blender with water. Once pureed and then strained to remove all of the solids, this liquid may be diluted and sweetened to one's taste, then chilled for a refreshing summer drink. Season The achacha is in season from December to mid-March in Australia.

(2003). Both treaties were signed in London on 27 June 1996. The two treaties entered into force on 30 January 1997 after they had been ratified by both states. First treaty The first treaty delimits the boundary in the Anguilla Channel between the British territory of Anguilla and the French territories of Saint Martin and Saint Barth√©lemy. The boundary is a simplified equidistant maritime line that runs in roughly an east‚Äìwest direction. It consists of seven straight-line segments defined by eight individual coordinate points. The western end of the border forms a tripoint with the Netherlands Antilles and the easternmost end of the border forms the tripoint with Antigua and Barbuda. The full name of the treaty is Agreement on maritime delimitation between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning Saint Martin and Saint Barth√©lemy, on one hand, and Anguilla on the other. When the treaty was signed, Saint Martin and Saint Barth√©lemy were both part of the Guadeloupe overseas department of France. In 2007, Saint Martin and Saint Barth√©lemy became two separate overseas collectivities of France. As a result, the first treaty now defines only the Anguilla ‚Äì Saint Martin maritime boundary. There is no maritime boundary between Anguilla and the separate collectivity of Saint Barth√©lemy. Second treaty The second treaty delimits the boundary between the British territory of Montserrat and the French territory of Guadeloupe. The boundary is a simplified equidistant line that runs through the Guadeloupe Passage in roughly an east‚Äìwest direction. It consists of four straight-line segments defined by five individual coordinate points. The western end of the border forms the tripoint with Venezuela and the easternmost end of the border forms a tripoint with Antigua and Barbuda.

The model asks for 17 items of information about the patient, the state of the heart and the proposed operation, and uses logistic regression to calculate the risk of death. It is free to use online. First published in 1999, the model has been adopted worldwide, becoming the most widely used risk index for cardiac surgery, and its use is believed to have contributed substantially to the improvement in the results of heart surgery seen at the beginning of the millennium. The original models are now aging, and a new model - EuroSCORE II - was announced at the EACTS meeting in Lisbon on Monday 3 October 2011 and published in the European Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery in April 2012. The updated calculator is available online at the official EuroSCORE website. Early reports on the use of EuroSCORE II are encouraging, with evidence showing that it has substantially improved the calibration of the older models and at least maintained and perhaps further improved on the discriminatory power of the previous models. Risk models are used for two main reasons. The first is that a risk model such as EuroSCORE allows the calculation of the risk of death before undertaking a heart operation. This is important as it serves to guide the clinician and the patient about the advisability of an operation by helping to weigh the risk against the benefits. The second is as a method of quality control. By calculating the expected risk of death for a population of patients having heart operations, this can be compared with the number of actual deaths. This comparison can be used as a measure of the quality of the performance of the hospital, unit or surgeon in question. Statistics The statistical basis for EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II is the well-established logistic regression. The available EuroSCORE papers supply logistic regression coefficients but without any measure of uncertainty and the raw data from which the calculations have been made are not available to the public.

Family Cornificia Faustina was the daughter of Marcus Aurelius‚Äô sister, Annia Cornificia Faustina and a Roman Senator, Gaius Annianus Verus.Ronald Syme proposes her husband was one of the suffect consuls in 146, recorded as Gaius Annianus Verus, but whom he claims had the full name of Gaius Ummidius Quadratus Annianus Verus. \\"The Ummidii\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 17 (1968), pp. 98f Cornificia Faustina had descended from one of the leading families in Rome. She was born and raised in Rome. Through her mother, she was a member and a relative to the ruling Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty of the Roman Empire. Her brother Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus served as one of the consuls in 167. Apart from her and her mother, Cornificia Faustina had another relative, who had the name Cornificia, her maternal cousin Annia Cornificia Faustina Minor. Life Cornificia Faustina's mother had died sometime in 152-158. When her mother had died, Cornificia Faustina and her brother divided their mother‚Äôs property that they inherited. Through the inheritances of their parents, Cornificia Faustina and her brother had become very wealthy. From her mother, Cornificia Faustina had inherited a great estate located in Pisidia. This estate was one of a number of estates in Pisidia called the Cyllanian Estates. These estates were around from the time of the Roman Dictator of the Roman Republic, Lucius Cornelius Sulla (c. 138 BC-78 BC). The Cyllanian Estate properties were very large properties and her property inheritance was considered to be very large for the rank of Cornificia Faustina. Little is mentioned in the Roman historical sources about Cornificia Faustina. What is known about her is mainly from the inscriptions, she has left behind in her Pisidian Estate. By 160, Cornificia Faustina had left Rome and had gone to live her estate in Pisidia. At that time, Cornificia Faustina had married an unknown Roman Senator by whom she had a daughter called Annia Faustina, who was born and raised there. When Marcus Aurelius had died in 180, her maternal cousin Commodus succeeded Marcus Aurelius as Roman Emperor. Commodus‚Äô sister, Lucilla was not happy living as a quiet, private citizen in Rome and became jealous of her brother and her sister-in-law because of all the attention that they received. Also she became very concerned due to the unstable behavior of her brother. In 182, Lucilla, her daughter Plautia, her nephew-in-marriage and with the help of Quadratus Annianus, his adopted son and Cornificia Faustina had planned to assassinate Commodus and replace him with Lucilla and her second husband, the consul Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus Quintianus, as the new rulers of Rome. Cornificia Faustina, her brother Quadratus Annianus and his adopted son were involved in Lucilla‚Äôs plot because the three may have had a dynastic dispute with Commodus. Lucilla‚Äôs plot to kill Commodus failed. When the conspiracy was revealed, the emperor ordered the deaths of Quadratus Annianus, his adopted son and Quintianus. Commodus may have confiscated her brother‚Äôs property and fortune. Lucilla, her daughter and Cornificia Faustina were banished to the Italian island of Capri. Later that year, the emperor sent a centurion to Capri to execute the three women. Shortly before her death, Cornificia Faustina had an inscription engraved at the estate. Annia Faustina inherited her mother‚Äôs estate and fortune. Before 200, Annia Faustina had a posthumous honorific inscription dedicated to her late mother at the estate.

The duo achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, helping to popularize Southern hip hop[ allmusic Biography] while experimenting with diverse genres such as funk, psychedelia, jazz, and techno. Benjamin and Patton formed the group as high school students in 1992. Outkast released their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik in 1994, which gained popularity after the single \\"Player's Ball\\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. With successive releases including ATLiens (1996) and Aquemini (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. In 2000, Outkast released the critically acclaimed Stankonia, which included the singles \\"Ms. Jackson\\" and \\"B.O.B.\\" In September 2003, the duo released the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which featured the number one singles \\"Hey Ya!\\" and \\"The Way You Move.\\" The album won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America. Outkast next released the soundtrack for the 2006 musical film Idlewild, which they also starred in. In 2007, the duo went on hiatus and both members have since pursued solo careers. In 2014, Outkast reunited to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide, beginning at the Coachella Festival in April.Coachella 2014 Lineup. Stereogum (January 8, 2014). Retrieved on 2014-05-28. The duo is one of the most successful hip hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards. Rolling Stone ranked them No. 7 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time. Between six studio albums and a greatest hits release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records. Meanwhile, they have garnered widespread critical acclaim, with publications such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork Media listing albums such as Aquemini and Stankonia among the best of their era. History=1992‚Äì95: Formation and debut Andr√© 3000 and Big Boi met as teenagers at Atlanta's Lenox Square shopping center (pictured). Benjamin and Patton met in 1992 at the Lenox Square shopping mall when they were both sixteen years old. The two lived in the East Point section of Atlanta and attended Tri-Cities High School. During school, Benjamin and Patton participated in rap battles in the cafeteria. Benjamin's parents were divorced and he was living with his father. Meanwhile, Patton had to move with his four brothers and six sisters from Savannah to Atlanta. Benjamin and Patton eventually teamed up and were pursued by Organized Noize, a group of local producers who would later make hits for the R&B; girl group TLC. The duo initially wanted to be called \\"2 Shades Deep\\" or \\"The Misfits\\", but because those names were already taken they later decided to use \\"OutKast\\" based on finding \\"outcast\\" as a synonym for \\"misfit\\" in a dictionary. OutKast, Organized Noize, and schoolmates Goodie Mob formed the nucleus of the Dungeon Family organization. OutKast signed to L.A. And Babyface imprint prior to graduation which would later become LaFace Records in 1992, becoming the label's first hip hop act and making their first appearance on the remix of labelmate TLC's \\"What About Your Friends\\". During the holiday season of 1993, they released their first single, \\"Player's Ball\\". The song's funky style, much of it accomplished with live instrumentation, was a hit with audiences. \\"Player's Ball\\" hit number-one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. 'Player's Ball' also topped the R&B; charts for six weeks. Their debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, was issued on April 26, 1994. This initial effort is credited with laying the foundation for southern hip hop and is considered a classic by many. Every track on Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was produced by Organized Noize and featured other members of the Dungeon Family. Follow-up singles included the title track and \\"Git Up Git Out\\", a politically charged collaboration with Goodie Mob that was later sampled by Macy Gray for her 1999 hit \\"Do Something.\\" On this early material, both Andr√© and Big Boi contrast lyrical content reflecting the lifestyles of pimps and gangsters with politically conscious material commenting on the status of African Americans in the South. OutKast won Best New Rap Group at the Source Awards in 1995. Within the mess that was the East Coast - West Coast feud, Andr√© came up on stage followed by boos from the crowd and said, \\"But it's like this though, I'm tired of them closed-minded folks, it's like we gotta demo tape but don't nobody want to hear it. But it's like this: the South got something to say, that's all I got to say.\\" As eloquently stated by rapper T.I., \\"Outkast, period. Outkast. That's when it changed. That was the first time when people began to take Southern rap seriously.\\" In the same year, the group contributed \\"Benz or a Beamer\\" to the popular New Jersey Drive soundtrack. 1995‚Äì99: Breakthrough with ATLiens and Aquemini After Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was certified platinum, LaFace Records gave OutKast more creative control and advanced money for their follow-up album, which they recorded from 1995 to 1996. The duo took the opportunity to recreate their image. On a trip to Jamaica with producer Mr. DJ, the two decided to abandon their cornrow hairstyles in favor of a more natural aesthetic, vowing to stop combing their hair.Westhoff, 2011. p. 135 Dungeon Family member Big Rube observed an increase in the duo's confidence after returning from their first tour, remarking, \\"They started understanding the power they had in their music. They started showing a swagger that certain artists have‚Äîthe ones that are stars.\\"Sarig, 2007. p. 139 The two also became more accustomed to playing live, particularly Big Boi, and Andr√© 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana.Nickson (2004), p. 46. The members also underwent changes in their personal lives; in 1995, Big Boi's girlfriend gave birth to their first child and Andr√© 3000 and Total's Keisha Spivey ended their two-year relationship.Sarig, 2007. p. 140 The double platinum album, ATLiens, was released on August 27, 1996. The album exhibited a notably more laid-back, spacey production sound, taking influence from dub and reggae. On ATLiens, Andr√© 3000 and Big Boi abandoned the \\"hard-partying playa characters\\" of their debut album in favor of more spacey, futuristic personas, and produced many of the songs on their own for the first time. Their tracks have an outer-space feeling to them- a feeling that, ironically, has warmed the community right up to them. Critics praised the group's maturing musical style on the record, which debuted at number two on the U.S. The album would climb to number three on Billboard's top R&B;/Hip Hop chart. Billboard 200 chart and sold nearly 350,000 copies in its first two weeks of release. The single \\"Elevators (Me & You)\\" reached number 12 and spent 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. ATLiens further solidified OutKast as the flagship representatives of the 1st generation Dungeon Family and the Southern hip hop movement. The album helped the group earn more recognition among East Coast hip hop fans in the East and West coasts. For this album, OutKast joined with partner David \\"Mr. DJ\\" Sheats to form the Earthtone III production company, which allowed the group to produce some of their own tracks. \\"ATLiens\\" was the group's second Top 40 single (following \\"Player's Ball\\" from their first album), and reflected the beginning of Andr√©'s increasingly sober lifestyle:(September 18, 2005). Polly Vernon talks to Andre 3000. Retrieved April 12, 2008. \\"No drugs or alcohol/so I can get the signal clear,\\" he rhymes about himself in the single \\"ATLiens\\". OutKast's third album Aquemini was released on September 29, 1998. It was also certified double platinum and reached the number-two position on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States; its title was a combination of the zodiac signs of Big Boi (an Aquarius) and Andr√© (a Gemini). Producing more material themselves, both Big Boi and Andr√© explored more eclectic subject matter, delving into sounds inspired by soul, trip hop, and electro music. The album featured production by Organized Noize and collaborations with Raekwon, Slick Rick, funk pioneer and musical forebear George Clinton, and Goodie Mob. Outkast forged the connections between Hip Hop and the black freedom struggle with their controversial song \\"Rosa Parks\\" featured on the album. 2000‚Äì01: Stankonia and Greatest Hits Originally titled 'Sandbox', the pair's fourth album, Stankonia was released in October 2000 to positive reviews. The album was seen as a change in the group's musical style, as it had a more commercial and mainstream appeal, compared to their previous three albums which were darker and deeper. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., and would eventually be certified quadruple-platinum. Stankonia's first single was \\"B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)\\", a high-tempo-influenced record. The second single, \\"Ms. Jackson\\", combined a pop hook with lyrics about divorce and relationship breakups, particularly Andr√©'s breakup with singer Erykah Badu; the titular \\"Ms. Jackson\\" character being a doppelg√§nger for Badu's mother. It was at this time that Andr√© changed his stage name to the current \\"Andr√© 3000,\\" mostly to avoid being mixed up with Dr. Dre. The single became their first pop hit, landing the number-one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the number-two position on the UK Singles Chart. The album's final single was the Organized Noize-produced \\"So Fresh, So Clean\\", featuring a credited guest appearance from regular guest vocalist and Organized Noize-member Sleepy Brown and garnered a remix featuring Snoop Dogg. All three singles' videos had heavy MTV2 airplay, and OutKast won two 2001 Grammy Awards, one for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \\"Ms. Jackson\\", and another for Stankonia as Best Rap Album.Cowie, Del F..

One of these new tracks was the single \\"The Whole World\\", which won a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Killer Mike also was featured on the song, gaining some exposure among areas outside of his native Atlanta. The other two new songs were called \\"Funkin' Around\\" and \\"Movin' Cool (The After Party)\\". 2002‚Äì04: Speakerboxxx/The Love Below OutKast spent 2 years working on their 5th effort, before releasing a double album, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, on September 23, 2003. It is essentially two solo albums, one by each member, packaged as a single release under the OutKast banner; the two members also appear and co produce on each other's discs for a few songs apiece. Big Boi's Speakerboxxx is largely a funk and Dirty South blended party record; Andr√© 3000's The Love Below features only brief instances of hip hop, presenting instead elements found in funk, jazz, rock, electronic music, and R&B.; The album is also OutKast's biggest commercial success yet, having debuted on the Billboard 200 albums chart at number-one and stayed there for several weeks. The album eventually sold over five million copies, and, as double-album sales count double for Recording Industry Association of America certification, the album was certified diamond for 10 million units shipped in December 2004. Its latest certification, in May 2006, reaches 11 million copies in shipping. The first two singles from the album(s), which were released nearly simultaneously, were Big Boi's \\"The Way You Move\\" and Andre 3000's \\"Hey Ya!\\" The video's storyline has \\"The Love Below\\"‚Äîa fictional band with all members, through the use of special effects, played by Andr√©‚Äîperforming in London. \\"Hey Ya!\\" was the number one song on the very final weekend of American Top 40 with Casey Kasem. It was also number one a week later on the very first weekend of American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest. The singles spent ten weeks at number one on the Hot 100 singles chart, with \\"Hey Ya!\\" spending nine weeks and \\"The Way You Move\\" taking over for one week in February 2004. These singles were seen as a breakthrough for the hip-hop industry, being among the first hip-hop songs to be widely played on adult contemporary radio stations. OutKast's next official single was not released until the summer of 2004. \\"Roses\\", a track featuring both members from The Love Below half of the album, did not meet the level of success as either of its predecessors, but it became a modest-sized hit on urban radio and the American music video networks. The video for \\"Roses\\" is loosely based on the musicals West Side Story and Grease. It featured sparring 1950s' style gangs, one representing Speakerboxxx, and one representing The Love Below, parodying the widespread arguing among critics and fans as to which half of the album was better. It deviates from these musicals in its final act, however, by featuring Andre 3000 defecating in a bouquet of roses before entering a Ramping Shop and presenting them to the receptionist. This closing scene was nominated as a finalist for the BET \\"Realest Music Video of All Time\\" award. The final singles were Andr√© 3000's \\"Prototype\\", which was paired with a science fiction-themed video about alien visitors, and Speakerboxxx's \\"Ghettomusick\\", which featured both members of OutKast and a sample from a song by Patti LaBelle, who also makes an appearance in the video. Speakerboxxx/The Love Below won the Grammy Award for the 2004. OutKast was one of the headlining acts at the show, and gave two performances: Big Boi performed \\"The Way You Move\\" with the Outkast backing band during a medley with Earth Wind & Fire, George Clinton and Robert Randolph, while Andr√© 3000 performed \\"Hey Ya!\\" as the show closer after they had been presented with the Album Of The Year Award.

The first single of the album, \\"Mighty 'O'\\", features both Andr√© 3000 and Big Boi; the song takes its lyrical hook from the Cab Calloway song \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" (\\"Mighty-ighty-ighty O\\") and seems to be an example of the album's mix of hip hop and more traditional American jazz and blues. Next, similar to previous OutKast albums such as Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, two singles‚Äîone solely by Big Boi, the other solely by Andr√© 3000‚Äîwere released simultaneously. The second single, almost exclusively featuring Big Boi, is the marching band‚Äìinfluenced \\"Morris Brown\\", featuring guest artists Sleepy Brown and Scar, both artists on Big Boi's Purple Ribbon label. The song's title is a reference to Atlanta's Morris Brown College, with the school's marching band providing the instrumentation. The third single, Andr√© 3000's \\"Idlewild Blue (Don'tchu Worry 'Bout Me)\\" delves into the blues genre, complete with a blues-style acoustic guitar riff and a harmonica element reminiscent of Aquemini single \\"Rosa Parks\\". In tune with the film, Idlewild reflects OutKast's original style tempered by 1930s influences. The fourth single, \\"Hollywood Divorce\\" was released in November 2006, and features verses from Lil' Wayne and Snoop Dogg and is produced by Andr√© 3000. 2007‚Äì13: Hiatus and solo work In 2007 after the sixth album under the OutKast name, Idlewild, Big Boi announced plans to release a full-fledged solo album.

The digital reissue will see the album expanded with previously-unreleased remixes. The vinyl reissue will feature a new black and white galaxy gatefold double LP, as distributed by Vinyl Me Please. Musical style and influences Outkast's musical style and lyrical content have evolved throughout the group's career. Rolling Stone described their music as \\"idiosyncratic\\" and \\"inspired by the Afrocentric psychedelics of George Clinton and Sly Stone.\\" The band's debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik incorporates analog elements such as Southern-styled guitar licks, languid soul melodies, and mellow 1970s funk grooves. It also features digital hip hop production elements such as programmed snare beats, booty bass elements, ATLiens and Aquemini feature outer space-influenced production with echo and reverb effects. With Stankonia, OutKast became the first hip-hop act to openly acknowledge rave culture as an influence.Reynolds, 2007. p. 333 Stankonia and Speakerboxxx/The Love Below would draw on sources such as psychedelia, gospel, funk, techno, soul, electro, and rock music. During the late 1990s, rappers tended to embrace slow, laid-back beats in their productions. On several tracks on Stankonia, the group employed faster, more chaotic tempos to reflect rave culture and the introduction of new drugs such as ecstasy into the hip- hop scene. One central motif of OutKast's songwriting is the duality of the two members and their differing personalities, with Big Boi as \\"the player\\" and Andre 3000 as \\"the poet\\". Big Boi generally covers the more conventional hip-hop topics such as his childhood in the South, sex, and partying, while Andre 3000 discusses more unorthodox themes. In contrast to much of hip hop music in the late 1990s, OutKast did not tone down its Southern regional qualities, like the harmonica break on \\"Rosa Parks\\" and distinctive Atlanta slang and diction throughout. The duo experimented with several delivery styles on the record, using \\"relaxed, hyper, distorted, speedy and conversational presentations.\\" OutKast often discusses the status of women in the South, and contrasts with the misogynistic attitudes common in hip-hop music. In Slate, Alex Abramovich praised the duo for \\"[tending] to shy away from the misogyny and violence rap is so often (and not always unjustly) condemned for.\\" In his book Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide, Oliver Wang writes that songs such as \\"Slum Beautiful\\" and \\"Toilet Tisha\\" \\"reimagine 'round the way girls, not only as just more than one-dimensional accessories, but as objects of affection with lives and concerns that are worth exploring.\\"Wang, 2003. p. 133 Collaborations and other work During the recording of Stankonia OutKast and Mr. DJ began producing tracks for the artists on their Aquemini Records imprint through Columbia, including Slimm Cutta Calhoun and Killer Mike, who made his debut on Stankonia's \\"Snappin' & Trappin.\\" In 2002, OutKast participated in the only Dungeon Family group album, Even in Darkness, along with Goodie Mob, Killer Mike, Sleepy Brown, Witchdoctor, and Backbone among others, and featuring Bubba Sparxxx, Shuga Luv and Mello.

Lawsuit  In April 1999, OutKast and LaFace Records were sued by Rosa Parks over Aquemini's most successful radio single, which bears Parks' name as its title. The lawsuit alleged that the song misappropriates Parks' name, and it objected to the song's obscenities. The song's lyrics are virtually unrelated to Parks, except for a reference in the chorus: \\"Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus\\". The song, which OutKast maintained was intended partly as homage, refers to Parks metaphorically: the purpose of the song's chorus is to imply that OutKast is overturning hip hop's old order, and that people should make way for a new style and sound. In the initial suit, the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan at Ann Arbor granted summary judgment for OutKast. Later on appeal, the issue of whether OutKast violated the Lanham Act for false advertising was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. This was based on the Court's determination that the title \\"Rosa Parks\\" had little artistic relevance, whether symbolic or metaphorical, to Rosa Parks the person. Parks' representation hired lawyer Johnnie Cochran to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied. The judge ruled that while there was linkage between the song and Rosa Parks, the song was an \\"expressive work\\" and was therefore protected by the First Amendment. In 2003, the Supreme Court turned down an appeal to overrule the lower court's decision. In December 2003, Andr√© told UK journalist Angus Batey that, following a Detroit concert in the midst of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case had less to do with Parks than with the lawyers.[Title/date?]. The Sunday Times. Timesonline.co.uk. Retrieved on May 12, 2013. In April 2005, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyers were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest. The case was settled on 14 April 2005, with Outkast and the co- defendants, Sony BMG and its subsidiaries Arista Records and LaFace Records, admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to develop and fund educational programs concerning Rosa Parks.\\"Rap Group Settles Rosa Parks Lawsuit\\".

It was at the royal court when Frances attracted the attention of visiting Irish chieftain Shane O'Neill, who was searching for a \\"proper English wife\\"Kathy Lynn Emerson, A Who's Who of Tudor Women, retrieved on 21 January 2010 and made her a proposal of matrimony, which she refused to consider. She later married Sir Thomas Mildmay, by whom she had two sons.  Family  Lady Frances was born on an unknown date, the youngest daughter of Henry Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Sussex by his second wife, Anne Calthorpe, a lady-in-waiting to Queen consort Catherine Parr. Frances had a brother Egremont, a sister, Maud who died at a young age. She had also two half.brothers Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex and Henry Radclyffe, 4th Earl of Sussex, by her father's first marriage to Elizabeth Howard. Frances's childhood was unsettled. When she was an infant, her father had thrown her mother out of the house for allegedly having entered into a bigamous marriage with Sir Edmund Knyvet.Emerson In September 1552, her mother was sent to the Tower of London for practising sorcery, and upon the accession of Queen Mary I, Anne, who was a Protestant fled to the Continent to avoid the Marian persecutions. It was during Anne's absence that Frances's father divorced her mother and attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to have Parliament bastardise both her and Egremont. There is the possibility that Sir Edmund Knyvet was indeed Frances's natural father.Emerson  Shane O'Neill  Early in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, Frances went to court where she served the new queen as one of her Maids of Honour. It was in this capacity that she attracted the attention of Shane O'Neill, the chief of the Irish clan of O'Neill, who arrived in London in January 1562 to negotiate with the Queen for his late father's title of Earl of Tyrone. O'Neill was a violent and ambitious man, having murdered many of his rivals. He was twice-divorced and kept his former father-in-law's wife as a mistress. He asked the Queen to procure for him a \\"proper English wife\\", and according to Violet Wilson's Queen Elizabeth's Maids of Honor and Ladies of the Privy Chamber, he specifically wished to marry Lady Frances.Emerson. His proposal of matrimony was refused. Shortly afterwards, when Frances visited her half-brother Thomas, Earl of Sussex in Ireland, where he served as lord lieutenant, O'Neill unsuccessfully renewed his courtship of her.Emerson His pursuit of Frances only served to increase the Earl's enmity towards O'Neill, and had tried to assassinate him by the means of poison.

It was moved by the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana (HLFI) half a mile south to save it from being demolished in 1997 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.\\"Landmark Fixer Upper\\", Mary Francis, The Indianapolis Star, July 5, 1998 The house is an example of the Gothic Revival style of American architecture typified by Alexander Jackson Davis and Andrew Jackson Downing in the mid-19th century. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs  Style  Andrew Jackson Downing advocated \\"truth in architecture\\" while celebrating the picturesque and asymmetrical, and the use of tracery and carving as ornamentation. The Nicholson‚ÄìRand House is an American version of Gothic Revival as developed by Downing, built with native materials.\\"Up for A Revival\\", Ruth Mullen, The Indianapolis Star, April 26, 1997 Downing's illustrations of country houses are reflected in this house's asymmetry, picturesque windows, projecting eaves with decorated rafter tails and brackets, board-and-batten siding beneath the gables, lacy bargeboard, the many dormers, the entrance porch with its chamfered posts and scrollwork brackets, and the shape of the chimneys. Still relatively rural today, in 1876 the house was two to three hours from downtown Indianapolis by horseback or wagon over of winding dirt roads. The nearest railroad depot was at Valley Mills, an hour's walk away. Downing's principles anticipated several elements of Craftsman houses, and even the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, as noted by architectural historian Vincent J. Scully Jr. It is likely that the builder of the house, contractor and stonemason David Nicholson, was familiar with the popular books of Downing. His book Cottage Residences first appeared in 1842 and subsequent editions appeared regularly over the next three decades. Downing's The Architecture of Country Houses was published in 1850, shortly before Nicholson arrived in America. Nicholson likely gathered ideas from several other pattern books that proliferated in the 1860s and 1870s. The popular works of architect and engineer George E. Woodward, for example, whose designs to a great degree follow the lead of Davis and Downing may have influenced Nicholson. Woodward's two volume Architecture and Rural Art and his Country Homes and Woodward's National Architect were all published in the 1860s and reprinted numerous times. Elements of Nicholson's house are present in several patterns in each of Woodward's books, but the general influence still appears to derive from Downing. Some of the materials incorporated in the Nicholson‚ÄìRand House appear to be identical to those being used in the Marion County Courthouse which Nicholson helped build. Nicholson was a prominent stonemason and partner in the business of Scott and Nicholson, which constructed the stonework of the massive new courthouse designed by Isaac Hodgson. Its cornerstone was laid in 1872. Whether Nicholson purchased extra materials or was given overruns‚Äîor whether he saw them being installed in the courthouse and decided he would like the same for the house he was building for himself‚Äîis unknown. But local lore for over fifty years after spoke of wagonloads of material carted from the courthouse building site. The colored tile of the floors in three rooms of the house is the same as was in the courthouse, and the interior woodwork is similar.Materials Left from Courthouse Used to Build Home 63 Years Ago, Eddie Throm, The Indianapolis News, undated  Builder and later owners  David Nicholson (1823‚Äì1899) was a stonemason born in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He came to Indianapolis in 1852, and became the partner of fellow Scot, Adam Scott, who had also learned his trade in his homeland. Their stone yard, originally on Delaware Street between Washington and Maryland (which, had it remained there, would have been very convenient for their work on the courthouse), was located from at least 1860 on Kentucky Avenue near the old Greenlawn Cemetery, just southwest of downtown.\\"Built Courthouse; David Nicholson, Prominent Contractor, Is Dead.\\" Indianapolis Daily Sentinel, 9 August 1899 Nicholson and Scott both lived in houses near their business, at least into the 1870s. Nicholson's wife Marion died in 1870, and it appears he soon married again, which may have provided the motivation to build a fine new house in the country near the villages of West Newton and Valley Mills. The house was completed in 1876 - the same year as the courthouse, which was formally dedicated in 1877 - but the marriage apparently ended in divorce.\\"David Nicholson Dead.\\" Indianapolis News, 9 August 1899. After working for years to complete the house, Nicholson sold the property to Allison C. Remy (1837‚Äì1918) in 1879. Remy was a Marion County Commissioner who had just that year completed his three-year term. A few years earlier, in 1875, he had built the Remy Hotel on the southwest quadrant of the Circle in downtown Indianapolis. The sale may effectively have been a trade; in any case, Nicholson ultimately became the proprietor of the hotel, which became the Brunswick Hotel, and Remy the owner of the house and land in Decatur Township. Remy owned several other parcels in the near vicinity on the opposite side of Spring Valley Road (today, Mann Road), totaling about . He was a prominent horseman and raised champion trotters.\\"Allison C. Remy, 71, Is Dead of Pneumonia.\\" Indianapolis Star, 4 August 1918. It is uncertain whether Remy lived in Nicholson's recently built dwelling, although one reference in Sulgrove's 1884 History of Indianapolis suggests that he may have for a time. But apparently Remy rented it out to a succession of tenants during part of the 1880s. Ownership of the house over the next decade is unclear, although at one point William H. H. Miller, United States Attorney General under President Benjamin Harrison and his former law partner, is said to have lived in the house, although only family history supports this contention. On March 28, 1903 John Lindsay Rand and his wife acquired the house and property, leaving Friendship, Indiana. Ironically, their property in Friendship is also listed with the National Register of Historic Places, the John Linsey Rand House. The Frank Copeland family was renting the house at the time, and continued to live there for another year, while they were having another house built for themselves. The Rands moved to the area in order to be closer to their only surviving child, daughter Florence, who was married to prominent Indianapolis attorney Wymond Joe Beckett. Beckett himself owned considerable farm acreage in the vicinity, but he and his wife lived in Indianapolis. The Rands lived in the house for the remainder of their lives, then Florence Beckett inherited the property in 1926.Distler, A. David. \\"The Rand Home.\\" Unpublished genealogical research paper, 1996. The combined Beckett farm encompassed about six hundred acres. The house was then rented to the manager of the farm's dairy operation, and later in the 1930s, to other tenants. The son of Wymond and Florence, Joe Rand Beckett, an attorney like his father, moved into the house about 1940Jor Rand Beckett Moves into Old Family Home on 600 Acre Farm, The Indianapolis News, July 19, 1940 and lived there with his wife Mary Ann until his retirement in the late 1950s, at which point the Becketts donated the farm to Depauw University. They continued to live in the house for a time, alternating with a home in Florida.Beckett, Mrs. Joe Rand. Letter to Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission, 1 August 1977. Beckett died in Florida in 1977,Social Security Death Index, electronic, ancestry.com whereupon his wife returned to Indiana, living out her days in Greenwood until her death in 1996. Ultimately the university had sold the house and it ended up with an out-of-state owner who wanted the property for residential and commercial development. In 1997 HLFI stepped in to save the house, and when the owner could not be persuaded to alter his plans, the organization found an available parcel about a half mile down Mann Road and moved the house to its present site.

Designed by Mikhail M. Pashinin, the I-21 was built to incorporate lessons learned from the combat experiences of Soviet pilots during the Spanish Civil War and the Nomonhan Incident with the Empire of Japan. Despite showing promising performance, the I-21 did not get past the prototype stage, as it was felt the type did not offer a significant enough increase in capability over competitors already in production, such as the Yakovlev Yak-1 or Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-3. Development Mikhail Pashinin began development of his monoplane fighter in early 1939. A former employee of N. N. Polikarpov, Pashinin envisioned the I-21 as a replacement for the increasingly obsolescent I-16 in Soviet service. The resulting I-21 featured a low set wing with retractable undercarriage, a Klimov M-107 engine, and a framed canopy with good visibility. The I-21 was of mixed construction, as typical of many contemporary designs, and had a monocoque rear fuselage made of wood, whereas the forward fuselage was built from welded steel tubing for increased rigidity. Wings were of metal with plywood covering. The cockpit was placed well aft, behind the wing, and the pilot was seated under a swinging canopy. The I-21's armament consisted of an engine mounted 20 millimeter ShVAK automatic cannon and two 7.62 millimeter ShKAS machine guns, one in each wing. This armament was typical of other Soviet fighters of the period such as the Yak-1. The 20mm ShVAK was later replaced by a harder-hitting 23mm BT-23 cannon. (This gun developed by Jacob Taubin (–Ø–∫–æ–≤ –¢–∞—É–±–∏–Ω) and M. Baburin (–ú.–ù. –ë–∞–±—É—Ä–∏–Ω) and is also known under the designation MP-6.) The prototypes were ultimately powered by Klimov M-105P engines, since the M-107 had run into development troubles of its own, and production of the engine was delayed. Flight testing with the 1,050-hp M-105 began with the first flight on 18 May 1940. Official testing by Soviet authorities was conducted from 6 June, in test pilots discovered that the I-21 had stability problems. As a result, Pashinin made modifications to the second prototype, consisting of new outer wing panels with tapered leading and trailing edges to improve stability. Although an improvement, the I-21 still was not performing as expected, despite some promising speeds of over 480 km/h (300-mph) at sea level. The third prototype featured more extensive remodeling of the wings, with clipped wingtips (reducing wingspan by 1.57-m) and sweeping back the leading edges. In addition, the tailplane was also improved. This last prototype also was fitted with a ventral oil cooler The third prototype displayed improved performance and handling, but officials complained of the I-21's need for an unacceptably long runway and its tricky character on landing. In the event, a planned pre- series run for five aircraft was canceled by Soviet officials, who likely felt the I-21 simply did not offer much more than types already in established production.

Katz and Mair argue that \\"parties in Western Europe have adapted themselves to declining levels of participation and involvement in party activities by not only turning to resources provided by the state but by doing so in a collusive manner\\".K Detterbeck, Cartel Parties in Western Europe?, Party Politics, Vol. 11, No. 2, p173-191 (2005) The concept of the cartel party was first proposed in 1992 as a means of drawing attention to the patterns of inter-party collusion or cooperation rather than competition; and as a way of emphasising the influence of the state on party development. In definitional terms, the cartel party is a type of party that emerges in advanced democratic polities and that is characterised by the interpenetration of party and state and by a pattern of inter-party collusion. With the development of the cartel party, the goals of politics become self- referential, professional and technocratic, and what little inter-party competition remains becomes focused on the efficient and effective management of the polity. The election campaigns that are conducted by cartel parties are capital-intensive, professionalized and centralized, and are organized on the basis of a strong reliance on the state for financial subventions and for other benefits and privileges. Within the party, the distinction between party members and non-members becomes blurred, in that through primaries, electronic polling, and so on, the parties invite all of their supporters, members or not, to participate in party activities and decision-making. Above all, with the emergence of cartel parties, politics becomes increasingly depoliticised.Richard S Katz and Peter Mair, Changing Models of Party Organization and Party Democracy: the emergence of the cartel party, Party Politics, Vol. 1, No. 1, p 5-31 (1995).

According to different estimates, between 4,500 and 20,000 people, mostly Poles from Pozna≈Ñ and the surrounding region, died while imprisoned at the camp. Camp establishment The decades-old Fort VII (also known as Fort Colomb from 1902‚Äì1918) was one of the ring of defensive forts built around the perimeter of Pozna≈Ñ by the Prussian authorities in the late 19th century, in the second stage of their Festung Posen plan. It was built in 1876‚Äì1880 (with improvements in 1887‚Äì1888). At present, it stands in the western part of the city, on today's ul. Polska in the Ogrody neighbourhood, part of Je≈ºyce district. In the interwar period it was used for storage purposes. Experimental gas chamber at Bunker No. 17 Following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, Fort VII was chosen as the site of the first concentration camp in occupied Poland, called Konzentrationslager Posen. It was probably created by decision of the Reichsstatthalter of the Pozna≈Ñ region, Arthur Greiser. It began functioning at some time around October 1939. The prisoners were mostly Poles from the Wielkopolska region. Many were representatives of the region's intelligentsia, often people who had been engaged in social and political life, as well as known Polish patriots and veterans of the Wielkopolska Uprising (1918‚Äì1919) and Silesian Uprisings. In the early stages of the camp's existence prisoners were generally executed within a week of arrival. In October 1939 an early experiment in execution by gas chamber was carried out by an SS chemist, Dr. August Becker,[p. 175] whereby around 400 patients and staff from psychiatric hospitals in Pozna≈Ñ were gassed at Bunker No. 17. The extermination of mentally ill was conducted by SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Herbert Lange, chief of the Gestapo in occupied Pozna≈Ñ. Lange served with Einsatzgruppe VI during Operation Tannenberg. He and his men were responsible also for the murder of 2,750 patients at Ko≈õcian, about 1,100 patients at Owi≈Ñska, as well as 1,558 patients and 300 civilian Poles at Dzia≈Çdowo; the experience gained allowed Lange to become the first commandant of Che≈Çmno extermination camp (until April 1942). In mid November 1939 the camp was renamed as a Gestapo prison and a transit camp (Geheime Staatspolizei Staatspolizeileitstelle Posen. √úbergangslager ‚Äì Fort VII). In this period prisoners usually remained in the camp for about six months, before being sentenced to death, a long prison term or transfer to a larger concentration camp, such as Dachau and Auschwitz, or in rare cases being released. Prisoners in this period included political and military activists in the Polish Underground State. Following Himmler's decree of 28 May 1941 the camp was renamed as a police prison and corrective labour camp (Polizeigef√§ngnis der Sicherheitspolizei und Arbeitserziehungslager). In this period some prisoners (called niedzielnicy in Polish, from the word niedziela, \\"Sunday\\") would be held in the camp temporarily between ending work on Saturday and beginning work on Monday. Prisoner numbers and deaths View of the main entrance About 2,000 to 2,500 prisoners were held at the camp at any one time, guarded by approximately 400 members of the SS. There were 27 cells for men and three for women. According to conservative estimates of the Fort VII State Museum, a total of 18,000 prisoners passed through the camp, of whom 4,500 died. Other estimates put the total number of prisoners as high as 45,000, and the number of deaths at around 20,000. Deaths were the result of either to execution: including shooting, hanging or gassing; mistreatment, torture, and contagious disease. On the 20 October 1939 the first Jewish victims from Posen (Pozna≈Ñ), Benno Rindfleisch and Julius Tychauer, were shot at Fort VII. Several more Jews were shot in the same month in Pozna≈Ñ and in nearby Buk and Kornik. But the majority of the Jewish population of Posen was transported to the Lublin district, most likely ultimately perishing at Belzec or Sobibor. The prison's documentation was destroyed near the end of the war. According to reports submitted by the prison to the register of deaths, the official number of prisoners who died at Fort VII was 479. Prisoners included citizens of other countries as well as Polish nationals, from the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, France, the United Kingdom, as well as some Germans. Conditions The \\"stairway of death\\" Fort VII was known among prisoners as a particularly harsh camp, partly because of the high ratio of guards to prisoners (about one to five). Prisoners lived in cramped, dark, damp and cold conditions. Sometimes 200‚Äì300 prisoners were held in a cell measuring 20 by 5 metres. The women's cells, located below ground level, sometimes remained flooded up to knee height. Until mid-1942 prisoners slept on the floor or on rotting straw. There was little or no access to washing facilities, and parasites and disease spread easily. Prisoners were subjected to torture and humiliation by the guards. On the \\"stairway of death\\" prisoners would be made to run up carrying a heavy stone, and possibly kicked down from the top by a guard. Food rations were minimal, as officially the prisoners were not working. However, some of them were made to work in unofficial workshops. Only one prisoner is known to have escaped ‚Äì Marian Szlegel, thanks to his work, was able to identify a time when the camp was less well guarded, and took the opportunity to abscond. Witness accounts speak of 7 to 9 executions by shooting a day, as well as mass hangings, and shootings of larger groups away from the fort itself. There were two typhus epidemics, each of which killed about 80% of the prisoners held at that time. Many prisoners also died after being taken to other concentration camps. Closure of the camp From March 1943 the process of gradually liquidating the camp began, so that the site could be used for industrial purposes. Prisoners were made to work on the construction of a new camp south of Pozna≈Ñ, in ≈ªabikowo (called Poggenburg by the Germans), and were then transferred there, the last ones being moved on 25 April 1944. Fort VII became a Telefunken factory producing radio equipment for submarines and aircraft. After the war the building was used as a storage facility by the Polish army. Plans were made in 1976 to turn the site into a museum in memory of the victims of the camp. The museum opened on 13 August 1979, and is called Muzeum Martyrologii Wielkopolan Fort VII (\\"Fort VII Museum of the Wielkopolska Martyrs\\").

He is thought to have been a younger son, yet because of the death of his elder brother, William Dubh succeeded his father, Iain Borb, in the year 1442. William Dubh was an old man when he was killed, leading his clan, at the Battle of Bloody Bay in 1480. He was the last MacLeod chief to be buried on the island of Iona. He was succeeded by his son, Alasdair Crotach. Life=Succession According to early 20th-century clan historian R.C. MacLeod, William Dubh was born in about the year 1415. He was the son of the MacLeod chief Iain Borb. The Bannatyne manuscript records that Iain Borb married a granddaughter of the Earl of Douglas--several 20th-century clan historians gave her name as Margaret. The couple had two sons, named William and Norman (Tormod), as well as two daughters. The manuscript maintains that Norman was the elder of the brothers, but that he died young and left a son who was too young to succeed to the chiefship. In fact, William was the son that succeeded Iain Borb as chief; MacLeods states that this happened in the year 1442. In MacLeod's opinion, the fact that the clan accepted William Dubh as chief, and not guardian, was evidence that William was in fact the elder brother. Later in the 20th century, A. Morrison stated that Norman was probably an illegitimate son of Iain Borb and that he was considerably older than William, since Norman led the clan in battle in 1428. According to 20th-century clan historians Morrison and D. Mackinnon, William Dubh was known as \\"Long Sword\\". Clan conflicts William Dubh and his kinsman, Roderick MacLeod of Lewis, are recorded as witnesses to a charter granted by John MacDonald, Earl of Ross, Lord of the Isles, to his brother Hugh MacDonald of Sleat, dated on 28 June 1449. According to MacVurich, the Sleat shenachie, William Dubh ('William MacLeod of Harris') accompanied Hugh and other \\"young gentlemen of the Isles\\" on a raiding expedition to Orkney. The tradition runs that the Western Islesmen were victorious in their conflict with the Northern Islesmen and that the Earl of Orkney was also slain. Hugh is then said to have ravaged Orkney, and carried off much loot. According to early 20th-century clan historians A. Macdonald and A. Macdonald, this expedition took place around the year 1460. In the late 15th century, Angus Og MacDonald, bastard son of John MacDonald, Earl of Ross, Lord of the Isles, attempted to depose his father. Angus was supported by all the branches of Clan Donald, as well as the MacLeods of Lewis. However, other island clans, such as the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, the MacLeans and the MacNeils, supported John. The Bannatyne manuscript states that the opposing clans fought skirmishes throughout the Hebrides. One such skirmish took place on Skye between the MacDonalds and MacLeods when a large force of MacDonalds, led by \\"Evan MacKail\\", son of the chief of Clanranald, landed at Aird Bay with the intention of laying waste to MacLeod territory. At this time William Dubh was away and his only son, Alasdair, rallied the clan's forces and marched them towards the MacDonalds, who were encamped near their galleys. The opposing forces clashed with each other and Alasdair was wounded in the back by Evan MacKail, who swung with a battle axe. As Alasdair fell to the ground he grabbed Evan MacKail and killed him with a dirk and cut off the dead man's head as a trophy. The battle ended with the defeat of the MacDonalds, who lost most of their men, and ten galleys. The manuscript dates from about the 1830s and states that there were heaps of bones and skulls which could still be seen where the battle of was said to have taken place. These skirmishes led to the final encounter at the Battle of Bloody Bay in 1480. In this conflict, The Bannatyne manuscript states that William Dubh was killed early on, and at the fall of their chief, the MacLeods began to give way. However, a priest named Callum Clerich made the keeper of the Fairy Flag unfurl his banner. The manuscript states that when the MacLeod's kinsmen, the MacLeods of Lewis, switched sides upon seeing the sacred flag unfurled and joined the forces supporting John. However, the fate of the battle was already decided and the forces of Angus won the day. A large number of the clan was killed during the conflict, including the bearer of the flag, Murcha Beach, as well as the twelve men who were tasked with the flag's protection. William Dubh's body was taken to the island of Iona to be buried with those of his predecessors. The body of Murcha Breac was placed in the same tomb his--the Bannatyne manuscript states that this was the highest honour which could be disposed upon his remains. William Dubh was the last MacLeod chief to be buried on Iona. Resting place choir of Iona Abbey. The stone said to represent a MacLeod is visible on the floor in the middle. The effigy on the left (north) is of a Mackinnon, the one on the right is a Mackenzie. The Bannatyne manuscript states that the first seven chiefs of Clan MacLeod were buried at Iona. The choir of Iona Abbey, for the most part, dates from the early 16th century. Within the centre of the choir there is a large stone which once contained a monumental brass, traditionally said to have been a MacLeod.

MacLeod speculated that perhaps the clan's founder, Leod, and five of his successors were buried beneath--however, in his opinion the fourth chief, Iain Ciar, was buried elsewhere. Family The 20th-century clan historians Morrison and MacKinnon stated that William Dubh's first wife was a cousin of his, a daughter of John Maclaine, third chief of Clan Maclaine of Lochbuie. The late 19th-century clan historian A.M. Sinclair, stated that she was the daughter of Murdoch Maclaine, 2nd chief of Clan Maclaine of Lochbuie. Following the death of his first wife, William Dubh then married Anne, daughter of Ranald Ban MacDonald of Moydart and Clanranald. After William Dubh's death, Anne married her cousin, Hector Roy Mackenzie, 1st of Gairloch. William Dubh had one son, Alasdair Crotach, who succeeded him on his death. Morrison and MacKinnon stated that his son was a product of his first marriage and that William Dubh also had two daughters--one from each of his two wives. The 19th-century historian A. Mackenzie only gave one daughter to William Dubh and stated she married Lachlan MacLean of Duart.

The insertion of the gene, along with other genetic elements such as promoters, terminators and an antibiotic resistance marker gene into the brinjal plant is accomplished using Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. The Bt brinjal has been developed to give resistance against lepidopteron insects, in particular the Brinjal Fruit and Shoot Borer (Leucinodes orbonalis)(FSB). Mahyco, an Indian seed company based in Jalna, Maharashtra, has developed the Bt brinjal. The genetically modified brinjal event is termed Event EE 1, and Mahyco have also applied for approval of two brinjal hybrids. The Event EE 1 was introgressed by plant breeding into various local varieties by University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore. Some of the cultivars of brinjal include: Malpur local, Manjari gota, Kudachi local, Udupi local, 112 GO, and Pabkavi local. It was approved for commercialization in India in 2009, but - after an apparent public outcry and rounds of debates in which representatives from Mahyco, the scientific community, and NGO's spoke on the topic - the then Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, facilitated a moratorium on its release until further, unspecified, tests were conducted. Bt brinjal was approved for commercial release in Bangladesh in 2013. Development Mahyco licensed and used the cry1Ac gene obtained from Monsanto and two supporting genes (nptII and aad). The cry1Ac gene is under the transcriptional control of an enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter, which ensures the gene is expressed in all the brinjal's tissue throughout its complete life cycle. NptII and aad are selectable marker genes, nptII is used to identify transgenic plants from non-transgenic, and aad is used to identify the transformed bacteria used during the development of the construct. Aad contains a bacterial promoter and is not expressed in the Bt brinjal. The completed construct was inserted into young cotyledons from the brinjal plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated technique. Agrobacterium naturally inserts DNA into plants from its Ti plasmid, and scientists use this to insert genes of interest into various plants. The transformed plants were regenerated and analyzed for the presence of the gene through Southern blotting. The plants' progeny were also analyzed to identify lines segregating in a Mendelian fashion. Effective against pests When fruit and shoot borer larvae feed on Bt brinjal plants, they ingest the Bt protein Cry1Ac along with plant tissue. In the insect gut, which is alkaline with a pH >9.5, the protein is solubilized and activated by gut proteases. The Bt protein binds to specific receptor proteins present in the insect membrane, resulting in pore formation in the membranes. This leads to disruption of digestive processes, paralysis, and subsequent death of the fruit and shoot borer larvae.http://moef.nic.in/downloads/public.../Bt%20Brinjal%20Primer.pdf Attempted commercialization in India The first agreement to develop Bt Brinjal was signed in 2005Down To Earth: Whose germplasm is it? between India's leading seed company, Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company, better known as Mahyco, and two agricultural universities - University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad (UAS) and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) in Coimbatore. An expert committee (EC-I) was set up in 2006 to examine the biosafety data presented by Mahyco. They concluded that while the current data demonstrated that Bt brinjal was safe and equivalent to its non-Bt counterpart, more studies were required to re-affirm the findings and further trials were needed to ascertain the benefits from Bt brinjal with respect to existing methods for pest management and pesticide reduction. They recommended that large scale trials be allowed to go ahead. In 2009, a second expert committee (EC-II) examined the data from these trials. They concluded that adequate safety tests had been performed, stating that \\"the benefits of Bt brinjal event EE-I developed by M/s Mahyco far outweigh the perceived and projected risks\\", and advised the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) to recommend commercialization of the Bt brinjal. The GEAC cleared Bt brinjal for commercialization on 14 October 2009. Following concerns raised by some scientists, farmers and anti-GMO activists, the government of India officially announced on 9 February 2010 that it needed more time before releasing Bt brinjal, with Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh saying that there is no overriding urgency to introduce Bt brinjal in India. On 17 February 2010, Jairam Ramesh reiterated that the centre had only imposed a moratorium on the release of transgenic brinjal hybrid, and not a permanent ban, saying that \\"until we arrive at a political, scientific and societal consensus, this moratorium will remain\\". Companies with any seeds of Bt brinjal will have to register the details with the government, and the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) was made responsible for storage of all the Bt brinjal seeds in India. Independent testing labs are currently being set up. An irregularityDown To Earth: Bt Brinjal was also brought to the notice of the Karnataka Biodiversity Board by Environment Support Group, a charitable trust in Bengaluru, in February 2010. It found that agencies accessed at least 10 brinjal varieties from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu without seeking prior consent of the National Biodiversity Authority and state biodiversity boards. Mahyco became India's first commercial entity to be accused of bio-piracy, or misappropriation, of local germplasm. In October 2013, the Indian High Court was pursuing criminal proceedings against senior officials of Mahyco-Monsanto. In June 2019 1,500 farmers gathered in India to protest and illegally plant GMO Brinjal seeds. Commercial Cultivation in Bangladesh On 30 October 2013 with approvals from the ministries of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and Agriculture (MoA), the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) received permission to release four varieties of Bt brinjal in time for the 2013‚Äì2014 growing season: Bt Uttara, Bt Kajla, Bt Nayantara, and Bt ISD006.Choudhary B et al 2014. The Status of Commercialized Bt Brinjal in Bangladesh. ISAAA Brief No. 47. Ithaca NY The Bt varieties underwent seven years of field and greenhouse trials in various environmental and geographic locations in Bangladesh Saplings were distributed to 20 farmers in January 2014 The Guardian spoke to 19 of 20 farmers growing the Bt brinjal crop in 2014 and established that it has so far had mixed results. In September 2016 the Indian Business Standard quoted a Director of the Bangladesh Department of Environment who said that production results had been very good from the 200-300 farmers who had grown the bt brinjal since 2013 but it was too early to judge whether there had been any contamination of wild brinjal. In 2017 6,512 farmers grew BT Brinjal and 27,012 in 2018. A 2019 report found that as a result of growing BT Brinjal there was a 39% reduction in the use of pesticides and the yield of BT Brinjal was also 43% higher. With reduced costs of pesticides and increased yield, profit of farmers increased by nearly $400 per hectare. A 2020 report found that farmers have achieved significantly higher yields and revenues by growing BT brinjal. The four Bt brinjal varieties yielded on average 19.6 percent more than non-Bt varieties and earned growers 21.7 percent higher revenue. 83.1% of Bt brinjal growers were satisfied with the yields obtained and 80.6% were satisfied with the quality of fruit, compared to just 58.7% of non-Bt brinjal growers who were pleased with their yields. At the 2020 AAAS it was announced that over 31,000 farmers in Bangladesh are now growing BT Brinjal. Philippines Scientists from the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os-Institute of Plant Breeding (UPLB-IPB) are currently developing a version of GM Brinjal. Controversy Many cultivars of eggplants displayed by protesters on the steps during the Feb. 2010 listening tour by India's environmental minister relating to BT Brinjal, in Bangalore, India Many controversies surround the development and release of genetically modified foods, ranging from human safety and environmental impacts to ethical concerns such as corporate control of the food supply and intellectual property rights. The brinjal is an important food crop for India, and the potential commercialization of a genetically modified variety has drawn support and criticism. Although it is a major food crop in India, brinjal production is relatively low with fruit and shoot borer infestation a major constraint to yield. Proponents of the technology believe the Bt brinjal will have positive effects for the Indian economy and the health of the farmers. Field trials conducted on research-managed farms carried out by Mahyco and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research suggested a 42% pesticide reduction and a doubling of the yield was possible. The economic gain for consumers, developers and farmers was estimated to potentially be US$108 million per year with an additional $3‚Äì4 million saved due to health benefits associated with decreased pesticide use.Kumar, Sant Prasanna, P.A. Lakshmi and Wankhade, Shwetal (19 July 2011) Potential Benefits of Bt Brinjal in India ‚Äî An Economic Assessment Agricultural Economics Research Review; Vol. 24 January‚ÄìJune 2011 pp 83-90, Retrieved 25 November 2012 A French scientist notable for his anti-GM perspective,Staff (20 October 2012) Six French academies dismiss study linking GM corn to cancer Agence France-Presse, \\"Seralini is a well-known opponent of GM crops, and his research was funded in part by an alliance comprising anti-GM campaigners and supermarket chains that have invested heavily in organic food.\\" (The same article was also published in several other places such as France24, Phys.Org and The Australian.) Retrieved 23 October 2012 Gilles-Eric Seralini, raised concerns about some of the differences between feeding trials using the genetically modified and unmodified brinjal, and criticized some of the testing protocols. The EC-II responded to the concerns raised by Seralini and other scientists in their report, New Zealand epidemiologist Lou Gallagher also criticised the feeding trials saying that the raw data indicated toxic effects were associated with the rats fed Bt Brinjal. Concerns have also been raised about a possible conflict of interest, with some of the scientists appointed to the GEAC being involved in developing their own GM products, that the decision by the EC-II was not unanimous, and about the reliability of safety data originating from Mahcyo run trials. The imposed moratorium has been criticized by some scientists as not being based on any compelling scientific evidence and potentially setting Indian biotechnology back decades. Others feel the critical issue is not the safety of the GM technology, but its corporatization and there are claims that India's crop protection industry was a major player in preventing the commercialization of the Bt brinjal. India's National Biodiversity Authority is probing the crop scientists involved in developing the Bt brinjal for allegedly violating India's Biological Diversity Act, 2002 by using local cultivars and foreign technology without their permission. The Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture on 9 August 2012 asked the Government to stop all field trials and sought a ban on GM food crops like Bt brinjal. It also sought a \\"thorough probe\\" as to how permission was given to commercialise Bt brinjal seed when all evaluation tests were not carried out. The report of the committee was tabled a day after Maharashtra government cancelled Mahyco's licence to sell its Bt cotton seeds.

J. Bernstein, P. Birkner, M. Joye, T. Lange, C. Peters, Twisted Edwards Curves. The curve set is named after mathematician Harold M. Edwards. Elliptic curves are important in public key cryptography and twisted Edwards curves are at the heart of an electronic signature scheme called EdDSA that offers high performance while avoiding security problems that have surfaced in other digital signature schemes. Definition Each twisted Edwards curve is a twist of an Edwards curve. A twisted Edwards curve E_{E_{a,d}} over a field \\\\mathbb{K} which have \\\\mathrm{char}(\\\\mathbb{K}) eq 2 is an affine plane curve defined by the equation: : E_{E_{a,d}}: a x^2+y^2= 1+dx^2y^2 where a, d are distinct non-zero elements of \\\\mathbb{K}. The special case a = 1 is untwisted, because the curve reduces to an ordinary Edwards curve. Every twisted Edwards curve is birationally equivalent to an elliptic curve in Montgomery form and vice versa. Group law As for all elliptic curves, also for the twisted Edwards curve, it is possible to do some operations between its points, such as adding two of them or doubling (or tripling) one. The results of these operations are always points that belong to the curve itself. In the following sections some formulas are given to obtain the coordinates of a point resulted from an addition between two other points (addition), or the coordinates of point resulted from a doubling of a single point on a curve. Addition on twisted Edwards curves Let \\\\mathbb{K} be a field with characteristic different from 2. Let (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) be points on the twisted Edwards curve. The equation of twisted Edwards curve is written as; : EE,a,d: ax^2+y^2=1+dx^2y^2. The sum of these points (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2) on EE,a,d is: : (x_1,y_1) + (x_2,y_2) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{x_1y_2+y_1x_2}{1+dx_1x_2y_1y_2} , \\\\frac{y_1y_2-ax_1x_2}{1-dx_1x_2y_1y_2}\\\\right) The neutral element is (0,1) and the negative of (x_1,y_1) is (-x_1,y_1) These formulas also work for doubling. If a is a square in \\\\mathbb{K} and d is a non-square in \\\\mathbb{K}, these formulas are complete: this means that they can be used for all pairs of points without exceptions; so they work for doubling as well, and neutral elements and negatives are accepted as inputs.Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange, Faster addition and doubling on elliptic curves Example of addition Given the following twisted Edwards curve with a = 3 and d = 2: ; 3x^2 + y^2 = 1 + 2x^2y^2 it is possible to add the points P_1=(1,\\\\sqrt{2}) and P_2=(1,-\\\\sqrt{2}) using the formula given above. The result is a point P3 that has coordinates: : x_3 = \\\\frac{x_1y_2+y_1x_2}{1+dx_1x_2y_1y_2} = 0, : y_3 = \\\\frac{y_1y_2-ax_1x_2}{1-dx_1x_2y_1y_2} = -1. Doubling on twisted Edwards curves Doubling can be performed with exactly the same formula as addition. Doubling of a point (x1,y1) on the curve EE,a,d is: [2](x1,y1) = (x3,y3) where : \\\\begin{align} x_3 & = \\\\frac{x_1y_1+y_1x_1}{1+dx_1x_1y_1y_1}=\\\\frac{2x_1y_1}{ax_1^2+y_1^2} [6pt] y_3 & = \\\\frac{y_1y_1-ax_1x_1}{1-dx_1x_1y_1y_1}=\\\\frac{y_1^2-ax_1^2}{2-ax_1^2-y_1^2}. \\\\end{align} Example of doubling Considering the same twisted Edwards curve given in the previous example, with a=3 and d=2, it is possible to double the point P_1=(1,\\\\sqrt{2}). The point 2P1 obtained using the formula above has the following coordinates: : x_3 = \\\\frac{x_1y_1+y_1x_1}{1+dx_1x_1y_1y_1} = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{2}}{5}, : y_3 = \\\\frac{y_1y_1-ax_1x_1}{1-dx_1x_1y_1y_1} = \\\\frac{1}{3}. It is easy to see, with some little computations, that the point P_3=\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{2}}{5}, \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\right) belongs to the curve 3x^2 + y^2 = 1 + 2x^2y^2. Extended coordinates There is another kind of coordinate system with which a point in the twisted Edwards curves can be represented. A point (x,y,z) on ax^2+y^2= 1+dx^2y^2 is represented as X, Y, Z, T satisfying the following equations x = X/Z, y = Y/Z, xy = T/Z. The coordinates of the point (X:Y:Z:T) are called the extended twisted Edwards coordinates. The identity element is represented by (0:1:1:0). The negative of a point is (‚àíX:Y:Z:‚àíT). Inverted twisted Edwards coordinates The coordinates of the point (X_1:Y_1:Z_1) are called the inverted twisted Edwards coordinates on the curve (X^2+aY^2)Z^2= X^2Y^2+dZ^4with X_1Y_1Z_1 e 0; this point to the affine one (Z_1/X_1, Z_1/Y_1) on EE,a,d. Bernstein and Lange introduced these inverted coordinates, for the case a=1 and observed that the coordinates save time in addition. Projective twisted Edwards coordinates The equation for the projective twisted Edwards curve is given as: (aX^2+Y^2)Z^2= Z^4+dX^2Y^2 For Z1 ‚â† 0 the point (X1:Y1:Z1) represents the affine point (x1 = X1/Z1, y1 = Y1/Z1) on EE,a,d. Expressing an elliptic curve in twisted Edwards form saves time in arithmetic, even when the same curve can be expressed in the Edwards form. Addition in projective twisted curves The addition on a projective twisted Edwards curve is given by :(X3:Y3:Z3) = (X1:Y1:Z1) + (X2:Y2:Z2) and costs 10Multiplications + 1Squaring + 2D + 7 additions, where the 2D are one multiplication by a and one by d. ;Algorithm :A = Z1 * Z2, :B = A2 :C = X1 * X2 :D = Y1 * Y2 :E = dC * D :F = B ‚àí E :G = B + E :X3 = A * F((X1 \\\\+ Y1) * (X2 \\\\+ Y2) ‚àí C ‚àí D) :Y3 = A * G * (D ‚àí aC) :Z3 = F * G Doubling on projective twisted curves Doubling on the projective twisted curve is given by :(X3:Y3:Z3) = 2(X1:Y1:Z1).

About 53 were built for civil and military training purposes. Development In 1948, Slingsby Sailplanes developed the 1932 Grunau Baby, which it had built under licence before World War II, into the Slingsby T.30 Prefect, an intermediate-level semi-aerobatic glider suitable for civil or military use. In the same year, Elliotts of Newbury introduced its version of the Grunau Baby, the Baby Eon; all three types were visually very similar, but differed slightly in dimensions, undercarriage, airbrakes, equipment and performance. The Prefect, like the Grunau Baby, was a single-seat fabric-covered wooden glider. It had high-mounted semi-cantilever straight-tapered wings, with a single wing bracing strut on each side, from the base of the fuselage to the wing spar. The span was 150 mm (6 in) greater than that of the Grunau Baby, and the tips enclosed the outer ends of the ailerons. Mid-chord airbrakes were fitted just outboard of the wing strut ends, extending above and below the wing. The fuselage was flat sided, and tapered from the trailing edge of the wing to a very small fin bearing a large, aerodynamically-balanced and slightly reshaped rudder that extended down to the keel. The straight-tipped tailplane, mounted on the top of the fuselage and braced from below, had a strongly swept leading edge and was placed with its trailing edge at the fin's leading edge, so that the elevators lacked the large cut out for rudder movement seen on the earlier glider. The open cockpit was better enclosed at the sides and had a small windscreen; for access, the cockpit sides and windscreen were removed as a single piece.Cockpit access detail Slingsby also added a single-wheel undercarriage in addition to the earlier nose skid, placed below mid-chord. In June 1948, the Prefect made its first flight. It was about 20 kg heavier than its predecessor, but despite a higher wing loading had a significantly better lift to drag ratio, 21 compared with 17. Operational history The Prefect was sold both on the civil market, including the Royal Air Force Gliding & Soaring Association (RAFGSA), and to the Air Training Corps (ATC) as the Prefect TX.Mk.1. 46 Prefects were built by Slingsby, with sales in Belgium, the Netherlands, Egypt, Israel and New Zealand. The Royal Netherlands Aero Club had 9 of them.Flight 13 August 1951 p.54 The ATC had 15 Prefects. In addition, Bedek Aircraft Ltd built about seven aircraft under licence in Israel.List of Prefects Some surviving ATC aircraft, originally bearing RAF serials, transferred to civil registry. Survivors Prefect cable launch Prefect landing, airbrakes deployed At least fourteen Prefects still fly In 2019. These include the prototype in the UK and four other T30As in the Netherlands.

History The estate belonged to the lordship of Real de Manzanares, owned by the Casa de Mendoza. In the 16th century it passed into the hands of Emperor Charles I. In 1693 Soto de Vi√±uelas was acquired by Cristobal Alvarado Bracamonte, who rebuilt the manor house, now known as Castle Vi√±uelas, to facilitate the stay of Philip V. In 1751, the Spanish Crown took over the land, at the request of Ferdinand VI, who added it to the Royal Site of El Pardo. In the 19th century, after the fall of Isabella II of Spain, the site was auctioned off. In the 20th century, during the Spanish Civil War, the castle served as headquarters of the Republican Army. After the war, the mansion was chosen by Francisco Franco as his official residence, He named it the \\"Royal Palace of El Pardo\\". The farm has gone through various private hands, Banco Santander and the family of Urquijo Colomer.

Early life  Born to Greek parents, Kampiles grew up in Hegewisch, on the far south side of Chicago. Kampiles' family was poor and lived in a small rental apartment. His father died in 1964, when Kampiles was nine. He attended college with a state grant from his father's social security benefit, by working at the college cafeteria, and his mother's salary from working at the south side Ford factory in the cafeteria.  Career  Kampiles was not performing his job well and was disappointed with his low pay and low-ranking status as a CIA clerk, and he decided to steal a top-secret KH-11 spy satellite manual from CIA headquarters in 1977 for monetary gain. In November 1977, Kampiles was fired from his job from CIA in Langley, Virginia.Zimmer, Robert Lee (November 13, 1978)  Espionage and prison  In January of 1978, Kampiles surprised his friends by flying unexpectedly to Athens, Greece, in the middle of winter which was highly uncommon (instead of summer as most Greek Americans did). He walked into the Russian Embassy there, asking to speak to an agent to sell the top secret KH-11 manual. He was given $3,000., by a Russian KGB agent named Michael, given a camera, and instructions to gather bring back more secrets. When Kampiles returned home, to hide where the money came from, he took his mother Nikoletta and his brother Mychael to the neighborhood bank where the three opened a new savings account, depositing the money. Kampiles told his mother he had received the money from a woman there for sexual services. Afterwards, Kampiles contacted a Greek American CIA agent about his contact with a Russian agent, in the hope of being rewarded with a position as a CIA spy. The Greek American asked him to send a letter writing his version of the encounter on paper and mail it to him. Bill felt his version would get him reinstated to the CIA after he had already lost his clerical job there. Instead, the case was passed off to another Greek American, experienced senior research analyst Vivian E. Psachos, who realized the story Kampiles gave was not true. He was asked to fly to Washington where inside a hotel room with a double mirror he confessed the truth. He was told his version was not possible, and they coerced him by informing him he had made his mother and brother accomplices when he adding their names to the savings account to avoid suspicion. Kampiles was allowed to return to Indiana. He had moved there after losing his job at the CIA, asking a police officer, the son of one of his mother's best longtime friends, if he could be his roommate. One day the FBI showed up to search the apartment. Kampiles explained to the police officer it was a background check for a better job in Washington, D.C. When the officer observed the FBI carefully looking inside the sheath of a real Japanese sword used as decoration on the apartment wall, he realized it was not a background check. When Kampiles understood he was being followed, he moved into his mother's Chicago apartment. He told his mother he had bought tickets for the two of them to go to Greece. According to Greek laws, extradition is not allowed if he took Greek citenship. He boasted to friends he planned to buy a restaurant/bar in the elite Kolonaki district of central, Athens. FBI agents waited for Kampiles to cross the border to arrest him in Indiana on August 18. At the trial, his defense team unsuccessfully argued that the manual was not a highly guarded secret, and that Kampiles never stole it. They flew in an older sister of his mother to testify she saw no manual when he unpacked at her home that January. They said he convinced the KGB agent with lies he fabricated to win his trust to use that as leverage with the CIA to be made an instant double agent. On November 17, 1978, a jury found Kampiles guilty of 6 counts of espionage, 40 years each,totaling 240 years. On December 22, one day after his birthday, Kampiles was sentenced to a total of 40 years imprisonment, and later sent to a federal prison in Wisconsin. It was there that he met Jimmy Baker who was serving his federal sentence, and another inmate, a judge from New York who befriended him and referred his case to a Loyola University Law professor who helped reduce his prison sentence to 18 years. Kampiles was released on December 16, 1996, after serving 18 years.

Life The elder brother of Sir Bartholomew Shower, he was born at Exeter, and baptised on 18 May 1657. His father, William, a wealthy merchant, died about 1661, leaving a widow (Dorcas, daughter of John Anthony) and four sons. Shower was educated in turn at Exeter, and at Taunton under Matthew Warren. His mother moved with him to London, and he was taught by Edward Veal and at the Newington Green academy by Charles Morton. In 1677, before he was twenty, he began to preach, on the advice of Morton and Thomas Manton Next year, in the period of the Popish Plot, a merchant's lecture was begun in the large room of a coffee-house in Exchange Alley. Four young preachers were chosen as evening lecturers, among them being Shower (with Theophilus Dorrington, Thomas Goodwin the younger and James Lambert).Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, article on Dorrington. Shower was ordained on 24 December 1679 by five ejected ministers, headed by Richard Adams. He at once became (still retaining his lectureship) assistant to Vincent Alsop in Tothill Street, Westminster, and held this post till 1683, when Sir Samuel Barnardiston sent him abroad with two other young ministers as companions of his nephew, Samuel Barnardiston. They made the Grand Tour, visiting France, Switzerland, Italy, and the Rhine. At Amsterdam, in July 1684, they parted. Shower remained in Holland till 1686. Returning to London, he resumed his lecture at Exchange Alley, but the pressure to which nonconformists were then subjected led him to return to Holland in the same year. He joined John Howe at Utrecht. At the end of 1687 he became evening lecturer in the English presbyterian church at Rotterdam, of which Joseph Hill was one of the pastors. He returned to London on receiving a call (19 January 1691) to succeed Daniel Williams as assistant to Howe at Silver Street. Here he was popular, and soon received a call to the pastorate of the presbyterian congregation at Curriers' Hall, London Wall, which he accepted on 8 May 1691. In this charge he remained till death, having been ‚Äòmarried‚Äô to his flock by Matthew Mead, as Edmund Calamy puts it. Twice he moved the congregation to larger meeting-houses, in Jewin Street (1692) and Old Jewry (1701), having successively as assistants Timothy Rogers (1658‚Äì1728) and Joseph Bennet. Shower was a member of a club of ministers which, for some years from 1692, held weekly meetings at the house of Dr. Upton in Warwick Lane, Calamy being the leading spirit. He succeeded (1697) Samuel Annesley as one of the Tuesday lecturers at Salters' Hall. A fever, in May 1706, left his health permanently impaired. John Fox, who visited him in 1712, was impressed by his ‚Äòstate and pride.‚Äô On 14 September 1713 he had a paralytic stroke at Epping. He was able to preach again, but retired from active duty on 27 March 1715. He died at Stoke Newington on 28 June 1715, and was buried at Highgate. His funeral sermon was preached on 10 July by William Tong. Works He published twenty-one single sermons, including funeral sermons for Anne Barnardiston (1682), Richard Walter (1692), Queen Mary (1695), Nathaniel Oldfield (1696), Jane Papillon (1698), Nathaniel Taylor (1702), Nehemiah Grew, and an exhortation at the ordination of Thomas Bradbury; also * ‚ÄòPractical Reflections on the late Earthquakes in Jamaica,‚Äô 1693. * ‚ÄòThe Day of Grace ‚Ä¶ Four Sermons,‚Äô 1694. * ‚ÄòFamily Religion, in Three Letters,‚Äô 1694. * ‚ÄòSome Account of the ‚Ä¶ Life ‚Ä¶ of Mr. Henry Gearing,‚Äô 1694. * ‚ÄòThe Mourner's Companion,‚Äô 1699 (2 parts). * ‚ÄòGod's Thoughts and Ways,‚Äô 1699. * ‚ÄòHeaven and Hell,‚Äô 1700. * ‚ÄòSacramental Discourses,‚Äô 1702 (2 parts). * ‚ÄòSerious Reflections on Time and Eternity,‚Äô 5th ed. 1707.

(2003). ; Charney, Jonathan I. et al. (1993). International Maritime Boundaries, Vol. 1, p. 905; Charney, (1998). The treaty was signed in Melbourne on 4 January 1982. The treaty sets out two separate maritime boundaries. The first is the boundary between Australia and New Caledonia in the Coral Sea (including the boundary between Australia's Norfolk Island and New Caledonia). It consists of 21 straight-line segments defined by 22 individual coordinate points forming a modified equidistant line between the two territories. For purposes of drawing the treaty's equidistant lines, it was assumed that France has sovereignty over Matthew and Hunter Islands, a territory that is also claimed by Vanuatu. The northernmost point in the boundary is a tripoint with the Solomon Islands. The boundary runs in a roughly north‚Äìsouth direction and then turns and runs west‚Äìeast until it almost reaches the 170th meridian east. The second boundary established by the treaty is that between Heard and McDonald Islands (Australia) and Kerguelen Island (France) in the southern Indian Ocean. This boundary is also roughly equidistant and consists of seven straight-line segments defined by eight individual coordinate points. The treaty came into force on 10 January 1983 after it was ratified by both states. The full name of the treaty is Agreement on Marine Delimitation between the Government of Australia and the Government of the French Republic. NotesReferences * Anderson, Ewan W. (2003).

Biography  Born in Leningrad to a typical intelligentsia family, Abeshaus was educated as an electrical engineer but soon abandoned this career and enrolled in the Mukhina School for Applied Art. By the time of his graduation from the famous ‚ÄúMukha‚Äù (Fly in Russian), he had already developed a critical stance towards the official Soviet art dominated by the Communist ideology and began exhibiting at semi-underground exhibitions. This was culminated by his taking part in a famous 1975 exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture. Abeshaus was fired from his job and censured by the official press ‚Äì which however admitted his \\"artistic taste, a good sense of color and form\\".  Career  Soon afterwards, Abeshaus set up, together with several Jewish artists, the Alef Group and became its leader. The group's first exhibition in November 1975 was held at Abeshauses‚Äô small apartment. According to the Alef Manifesto written by Alec Rappoport, ‚ÄúWe are trying to conquer the influence of small-town Jewish art and find sources for our work in deeper, wiser, and more spiritual European culture, and from it build a bridge to today and tomorrow\\". In May 1976, some of Abeshaus's works, clandestinely sneaked out of the country, were exhibited at the Berkeley Art Museum to much critical acclaim. Later in the same year, following some political bargain between Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Abeshaus and his family were finally permitted to leave the USSR for Israel. Since then Abeshaus lived and worked in Ein Hod, a picturesque artists‚Äô village near Haifa founded by Marcel Janco. His works were exhibited at numerous exhibitions, including dozens one- artist shows, in Israel, USA, Europe and, after the collapse of the USSR, in Russia. His ultimate acceptance and recognition there was culminated in a sensational memorial one-artist exhibition staged in 2009 at the famous Russian Museum in St.Petersburg - an exceptional honor for a modern artist.

It closed in 2019. Its aim was to provide consultancy services, training and education and research into records management across the world. Its work emphasised the importance of managing records as a basis for protecting civil and human rights, reducing poverty, controlling corruption, strengthening democracy, promoting economic and social reform, improving services to citizens, and demonstrating accountability and transparency. The Charity Commission The IRMT was based in London and governed by a board of trustees. Its work was supported by a team of over 60 practicing professionals drawn from the public and private sectors and from academic institutions worldwide.  Research  The IRMT's research and deve lopment programme focused on the transition to managing records and information in the electronic working environment. The research findings are available internationally through the IRMT website and are used as the basis for developing education and training programmes. The Trust also worked in applying them practically. The most recent research addressed is 'Fostering Trust and Transparency in Governance: Investigating and Addressing the Requirements for Building Integrity in Public Sector Information Systems in the ICT Environment.'  Consultancy Services  The IRMT worked with local policy makers, stakeholders and records professionals to develop and implement and sustainable legal and regulatory records and information management frameworks, policies, systems, procedures and facilities, in the paper or the electronic environments, either at the central or local level or in relation to particular functions. It focused particularly on records projects that affect citizens' rights, entitlements and welfare, for instance projects that contribute to accountability and anti-corruption measures, by strengthening records relating to the management of land, finance, human resources, or the judicial process. Projects have been delivered successfully in over 30 countries, including, for instance, Bangladesh, Sierra Leone and Belize.  Training and Education  The two major IRMT initiatives in this area are The Management of Public Sector Records Study (MPSR) programme and the Training in Electronic Records Management (TERM) programme. These were prepared with the aim of supporting countries where professional educational tools in the field of records and information management are hard to obtain. All such material is made available internationally, free of charge in hard copy and through the IRMT website.  Fundraising and Partnerships The Trust was funded mainly through national and international development agencies, including the U.S., Canadian and U.K., the World Bank The World Bank's records management resources and the UNDP.

Their most famous product is Highland Toffee. McCowan's Highland Toffee statue The former McCowan's factory in Tryst Road Stenhousemuir.  History  McCowan's originally began life as an aerated water business run by Andrew McCowan, His wife attempted to make some extra money on the side by selling toffee from the window of their house in Stenhousemuir. The Toffee proved more successful than the Lemonade and soon became the primary family income. Within 15 years, McCowan was producing a variety of confections including Tablet and later Rock, Snowballs, Lollypops and Macaroon were added to the company's products. But it was in the 1920s that McCowan began to produce the small toffee chews that would become the company's flagship confection - McCowan‚Äôs Highland Toffee had arrived. In the early years, Andrew worked from a shop in Church Street but in 1924 he opened a factory in its current location of Tryst Road. In 1951 Andrew died, and the company passed into the hands of his son Robert McCowan. In 1959 Robert accepted an offer from the Nestl√© company, yet still operated under its own brandMcIntosh, F: Larbert and Stenhousemuir, page 44. Falkirk District Council, 1990. During the 1980s the company introduced the Wham Bar. Further development and an agreement with A.G. Barr also led to production of the Irn-Bru Bar. In 1987 Nestl√© merged with Rowntree's leading to a short term re-branding of McCowan's under the Nestl√©-Rowntree name. In 1989 a Management Buyout occurred and the company once again became independent. In 1996 Dutch confectioner Phideas purchased the company, before the company became independent once more in 2003. In 2005 the company was purchased by Graham Wallace and Andy Allan who later that year bought John Millar & Sons as a result McCowans ceased to exist as an independent company and merged with John Millar & Sons to become Millar McCowan After this time the McCowans brand (separate from the McCowans company) transferred to firstly to The New McCowans Ltd then in October 2011 to Tangerine Confectionery.

Heinrich Kanner attended high school and studied at the University in Vienna. Initially, he was a correspondent for the \\"Frankfurter Zeitung\\" in Vienna. In 1894, Kanner founded together with the economist Isidore Singer, and the writer Hermann Bahr, the weekly newspaper \\"Die Zeit\\". What \\"Die Zeit\\" differed from all that time in Austria-Hungary, published liberal newspapers, was the deviation from the foreign policy of the German-Austrian alliance. Employees of \\"Die Zeit\\" were people like Bertha von Suttner, Theodor Herzl, Thomas G. Masaryk, Felix Salten and Anton Wildgans. Hermann Bahr was the head of the cultural arts pages, script manager was Grethe Schmahl-Wolf. In 1904, \\"Die Zeit\\" turned to a daily newspaper, which appeared until 1918, and in the time of World War I was subject to strict censorship measures. Even during the Great War Heinrich Kanner started his research for the question of the war guilt. For this purpose during the war, he interviewed a number of prominent representatives of public life, including Leon von Bilinski, who was shared Finance Minister of the monarchy from 1912 to 1915, and has participated in key meetings and discussions on foreign policy during this period. Bilinski testified in talks with Kanner that Emperor Franz Joseph was determined since the spring of 1913 to authorize necessary action in the Balkans without consultations to the risk of a clash with Russia. After the Great War Kanner worked as a political journalist on to the political questions of the First World War, he visited several times the National Archives in Vienna, to study the preserved original records.

Waza-ari in judo  A waza-ari is the second highest score a fighter can achieve in judo, the others being a yuko (advantage) or, formerly, a koka. An ippon would be the highest score, that once awarded, ends the match in favor of the athlete who scored it. The referee raises his arm laterally parallel to the ground to award waza-ari. Its value is higher than any other sum or combination of lower scores. No matter how many yuko or koka, when time runs out, a waza-ari still counts more. In judo, a waza-ari is awarded after an action in which the opponent is thrown with control and accuracy, but not to the extent of an ippon, or held on the back for between 15 and 20 seconds on the mat. To achieve an ippon, four elements are required: landing the opponent with a judo technique on the mat flat on the back, with force, speed, and control. If one out of the four elements is not expressed or is expressed poorly, the referee can still award the waza-ari. With the old rules (until 2013) it could also be awarded as a penalty, formerly named keikoku. A penalty can be given for infractions such as non-combativity, improper hold, false attacks, etc.. In judo, penalties are always awarded in a progressive way, e.g. first infraction ‚Äì first penalty (shido), second infraction - second penalty (chiui), third infraction ‚Äì third penalty (keikoku), fourth infraction - disqualification (hansoku make; see ippon). Until 2017, waza-ari is the only cumulative score in judo, so that if an athlete scored two waza-ari during a bout, they each count for half an ippon, thus giving victory to the athlete. To signal this, the referee raised his arm laterally parallel to the ground to award the second waza-ari and then continued rising the arm vertically as if to mark an ippon, saying \\"Waza-ari, awasete ippon\\", before ending the match (\\"Sore made\\"). briefly (for about one year) with some new rules introduced in 2017, waza-ari no longer accumulated towards ippon, however, if no ippon was scored, waza-ari determined the winner. Then, in 2018, the rule that two waza- ari combine to make ippon was reinstated. Scores lower than waza-ari are no longer awarded. Waza-ari in karate In many styles of karate competition or shiai, a score of waza-ari is awarded to a competitor that successfully strikes an opponent within the rules of the competition, but in a way that is not considered to overpower the opponent sufficiently to end the match. In the shobu ippon kumite practiced by the Japan Karate Association and its offshoots, waza-ari is awarded when a strike makes contact with the opponent but without fulfilling all of the criteria for a decisive strike, either due to the target area, distance, focus or other judging criteria. In knockdown kumite as practiced by offshoots of the kyokushinkaikan organizations, waza- ari is awarded for a blow that temporarily stuns the opponent but does not render them unable to continue for longer than three seconds.

This range is very like the Matopos of Zimbabwe in appearance. It stretches for about 140 km (60 mi) from Garies in the south to Springbok in the north and forms a plateau between the Sandveld of the Cape West Coast and Bushmanland in the east, with the Hardveld of the mountainous central Kamiesberg escarpment in the midst. History 'Ellenboogfontein' near present-day Kamieskroon - Kamiesberge in background The region was formerly occupied by Khoikhoi who were nomadic pastoralists.Karoo ecoregion The buildings of Kamieskroon were moved from a previous location known as Bowesdorp, named after the village doctor. Steep granite hills and a shortage of water hindered development, so that it was relocated. The foundations of the original village may still be seen in a rocky ravine some 8 km north of Kamieskroon. The Leliefontein mission station, known for the Leliefontein massacre in 1902, is located at an elevation of 1 500 m (5 000 ft) on a plateau near the top of the mountains, which attains a height of over 1 700 m (5 600 ft). Ecology The range has a mild climate made moderate by the cold Benguela Current. It is an outlier of the Cape Floristic Region. Its vegetation is largely Succulent Karoo with a large number of endemic species. Quiver trees and Camelthorn trees are common with large numbers of Euphorbia shrubs . Also occurring are Ceraria namaquensis, Euclea tomentosa, Rhus undulata, Ozoroa dispar and Tylecodon paniculatus. The Kamiesberg is unusual among desert areas in that rainfall is relatively predictable, with frost being rare. Rain is usually accompanied by heavy dewfall and fog. Bergwinds during winter can result in temperatures of 40 ¬∞C. After a winter of adequate rainfall, springtime brings widespread and spectacular flowering of Asteraceae and Brassicaceae species that were dormant, Aizoaceae and numerous Scrophulariaceae, Poaceae, Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae. The region is considered one of 25 global plant biodiversity hotspots and portions were declared protected in 1999 in order to preserve the abundant wildlife and colourful wild flowers. The Goegab Nature Reserve near Springbok is a good place to appreciate the floral wonders of the mountains.Flora and Vegetation of Southern Africa:Namaqualand See also * List of mountain ranges of South Africa * Kamieskroon ReferencesBibliography *Anderson, P. and Hoffman, M.T. 2005.

In this battle a large Ottoman force under Ahmed Pasha attempted to capture the village of Cetate in Wallachia, controlled by the troops of Colonel Alexander Baumgarten, but were unsuccessful. Background The battle took place during the Danube campaign of the Crimean War. In the build-up to war, Russia had occupied the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, positioning troops on the left (northern) bank of the Danube, which formed the border with Ottoman territory. The Ottoman Empire had responded by moving troops to the right bank to face them. In the west, on the border with Austria and Serbia, Russian troops in Cetate were faced by Ottoman forces in the fortress of Vidin. Following the Ottoman ultimatum on 4 October 1853 to withdraw within 2 weeks, Ottoman forces under Ahmed Pasha crossed the river and occupied the town of Calafat, which they fortified as a bridgehead. Battle On 31 December 1853 Ahmed Pasha and a force of several thousand cavalry, supported by infantry, advanced to attack Cetate, which was held by a Russian detachment, under Colonel Alexander K. Baumgarten. This attack was repulsed, after which both sides called up reinforcements. On 6 January 1854 (Christmas Day in the Russian Orthodox calendar) Ahmed renewed his assault with a force of 18,000 men. The Russians repelled several attacks but were running out of shells and losing a significant number of the troops. However, Russian reinforcements arrived during the day, and Ahmed, fearing an assault on his base and being cut off himself, abandoned the town and retreated to Calafat. Aftermath The battle at Cetate was ultimately indecisive. After heavy casualties on both sides, both armies were back at their start positions. The Ottoman forces were still in a strong position and barring contact between the Russians and the Serbs, to whom they looked for support, but were themselves no nearer driving the Russians from the Principalities, their stated aim.

Life Born 23 June 1620, he was the third son of Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston and Jane (n√©e Soame) Barnardiston. He joined the London apprentices in 1640 in the rioting that took place at Westminster on the appointment of Colonel Thomas Lunsford as constable of the Tower of London. According to an anecdote of Paul de Rapin, Barnardiston's prominence in the crowd of apprentices with distinctive haircuts on this occasion gave rise to the political use of the word Roundhead, when Queen Henrietta Maria called out \\"See what a handsome young Roundhead is there!\\" Barnardiston became a Levant merchant, and in 1649 and 1650 he was residing at Smyrna as agent for the Levant Company, in whose service he became rich. He took no active part in the civil wars, but passed time during the Protectorate in Suffolk. At Brightwell, near Ipswich, he purchased a large estate, and built a large house known as Brightwell Hall. Barnardiston's household had a Puritan chaplain; in 1663 he engaged Robert Franklyn. He opposed the high-church party in his neighbourhood, and in June 1667 reported to the council that Captain Nathaniel Daryll, commanding a regiment stationed at Ipswich, was a suspected papist. In 1660 Barnardiston welcomed the Restoration and was rewarded by a knighthood, and in 1663 by a baronetcy. He was appointed High Sheriff of Suffolk for 1666‚Äì67. In 1661 he was on the committee of the East India Company; from 1668 to 1670 he was deputy-governor, and came prominently before the public in Skinner's Case. Thomas Skinner, an independent English merchant, had had his ships confiscated by the company's agents for infringing its trading monopolies in India. Skinner appealed for redress to the House of Lords, which had awarded him ¬£5,000 damages against the company. Sir Samuel, on behalf of the East India corporation, then presented a petition to the House of Commons against the action of the lords, and the lower house voted (2 May 1668) Skinner's complaint and the proceedings of the lords illegal. On 8 May Barnardiston was summoned to the bar of the upper house and invited to admit himself guilty of a scandalous libel against the house. He declined, was ordered upon his knees, and sentenced to a fine of ¬£300, and to be imprisoned till the money was paid. Parliament was adjourned the same day. He refused to comply and was committed to the custody of the usher of the black rod, in whose hands he remained until 10 August following, when he was suddenly released without any explanation of the step being given. On 19 October 1669, at the first meeting of a new session of parliament, Barnardiston was called to the bar of the House of Commons, and there invited to describe the indignities which the lords had put upon him. The Commons voted the proceedings against him subversive of their rights and privileges. The Lords refused at first to vacate their action in the matter, and the quarrel between the Houses continued till December; but finally both houses yielded to the suggestion of the king to expunge from their journals the entries relating to the incident. Political career In 1672 the death of Sir Henry North, 1st Baronet created a vacancy in the representation of Suffolk, and Barnardiston was the candidate chosen by the Whigs. The election was viewed as a trial of strength; Dissenters and the commercial classes supported Sir Samuel, and he gained seventy-eight votes more than his opponent, Lord Huntingtower. But Sir William Soame, the sheriff of Suffolk, was well-disposed to the losing candidate, and on the ground that Sir Samuel's supporters comprised many about whose right to vote he was in doubt, he sent up to the Commons a double return announcing the names of the two candidates, and leaving the House to decide their rights to the seat. Each candidate petitioned the house to amend the return in his interest; and after both petitions had been referred to a committee, Sir Samuel was declared duly elected, and took his seat. But these proceedings did not satisfy Barnardiston. He brought an action in the King's Bench against the sheriff, Soame, to recover damages for malicious behaviour towards him, and Soame was placed under arrest. The case was heard before Lord Chief Justice Matthew Hale on 13 November 1674, and judgment, with ¬£800 damages, was given in favour of the plaintiff. By a writ of error the proceedings were afterwards transferred to the Exchequer Chamber, and there, by the verdict of six judges out of eight, the result of the first trial was reversed. In 1689 Sir Samuel, after renewing his complaint in the Commons, carried the action to the House of Lords. In the interval Soame had died, and his widow was now made the defendant. The lords heard the arguments of both parties in the middle of June, but they finally resolved to affirm the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber. The final judgment gave the House of Commons an exclusive right to determine the legality of the returns to their chamber, and of the conduct of returning officers. The two most elaborate judgments delivered in the case‚Äîthat of Sir Robert Atkyns, one of the two judges who supported Sir Samuel in the Exchequer Chamber, and that of Lord North on the other side in the House of Lords, who, as attorney-general Sir Francis North, had been counsel for the defendant in the lower court‚Äîwere published in 1689, and were frequently reprinted. The case was popularly viewed at the time as a political trial, and is given partisan commentary by Roger North, the Tory historian, in his Examen. North declares that Barnardiston throughout the proceedings sought the support of \\"the rabble\\", and pursued Soame with vindictiveness, in the first instance by making him bankrupt after the trial in the King's Bench, and in the second by sending the case to the House of Lords after his death. The proceedings made Sir Samuel's seat in parliament secure for many years. He was again returned for Suffolk to the parliaments of 1678, 1679, and 1680, and to William III's parliaments of 1690, 1695, 1698, and 1701. Throughout his career he steadily supported the Whigs. In 1681 he was foreman of the grand jury of Middlesex which threw out the bill of high treason against the Earl of Shaftesbury. In 1683 he openly expressed his dissatisfaction with the proceedings that had followed the discovery of the Rye House Plot; but on 28 February 1684 he was summoned to take his trial for libel as 'being of a factious, seditious, and disaffected temper,' and having 'caused several letters to be written and published' reflecting on the king and officers of state. Two of the four letters which formed the basis of the charge were privately addressed to a Suffolk friend, Sir Philip Skippon, and the others to a linendraper of Ipswich and to a gentleman of Brightwell, with both of whom Sir Samuel was intimate. They contained sentences favouring William Russell, Lord Russell and Algernon Sydney, and stating that 'the papists and high tories are quite down in the mouth,' and that 'Sir George [Jeffreys] is grown very humble;' and on these words the accusation was founded. George Jeffreys, who had a personal concern in the matter, tried the case, and directed the jury to return a verdict of guilty on the ground that the act of sending the letters was itself seditious, and that there was no occasion to adduce evidence to prove a seditious intent. An arrest of judgment was moved for, and it was not till 19 April 1684 that Jeffreys pronounced sentence. A fine of ¬£10,000 was imposed. Barnardiston resisted payment, and was imprisoned until June 1688, when he paid ¬£6,000, and was released on giving a bond for the residue. The whole case was debated in the House of Lords, 16 May 1689, and Jeffreys's judgment reversed. An account of the trial was published in 1684. Barnardiston took little in parliament as a speaker, but his financial ability was recognised. In 1690 he was nominated a member of the commission appointed to audit and control the public accounts, which discovered many frauds and embezzlements, and first effectively supervised the expenditure of the public money. In 1691 a quarrel with Sir Josiah Child, governor of the East India Company, caused him to retire from the management, and afterwards to withdraw the money he had invested in its stocks. The dispute was over party politics, Child being an adherent of the Tories, who were at the time in a majority on the board of directors. In 1697 Sir Samuel narrowly escaped imprisonment for a third time on disobeying the instructions of the House of Commons when deputed by them to attend a conference with the House of Lords for the purpose of regulating the importation of East India silk. He retired from parliament in 1702, at the age of 82, and died, 8 November 1707, at his house in Bloomsbury Square, London. Family He was twice married, (1) to Thomasine, daughter of Joseph Brand of Edwardstone, Suffolk, and (2) to Mary, daughter of Sir Abraham Reynardson, lord mayor of London. He had no children, and his nephew, Samuel, son of his eldest brother Nathaniel, succeeded to his title and estate, and died on 3 January 1710. Another nephew, Pelatiah, brother of the second baronet, was third baronet for little more than two years, dying on 4 May 1712. On the death a few months later (21 September 1712) of the fourth baronet, Nathaniel, son of Pelatiah Barnardiston, the first baronet's youngest brother, the baronetcy became extinct. Sir Samuel's house, Brightwell Hall, was pulled down in 1753.

In 1484 James Blount became disaffected from Richard, and a supporter of Henry of Richmond, the future King Henry VII.Gill, p. 100. This became apparent to King Richard when, later that year, he ordered the return to England of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, who had been held prisoner at Hammes for nearly a decade. Thomas Montgomery, who was deputizing for Mountjoy, also went over to Henry's side. James Blount had taken Oxford to Henry's court, and in December an attack was mounted on Hammes by John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham, captain of Calais. In January 1485 Oxford, with Thomas Brandon, successfully evacuated the force from Hammes, including Blount's wife, and his brother, James Blount, and they joined Henry.Gill, p. 120. Richard, seeing the affinity of William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings (died 1483) falling away, negotiated inconsistently, with offers of pardons mixed with confiscations, and John of Gloucester was brought in over Dynham. James Blount and others were with Henry when he invaded England and became King after defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth.Gill, p. 130. Mountjoy made his will on 6 October 1485, bequeathing to his second son, Rowland Blount, a chain of gold with a gold lion set with diamonds, and to his daughter, Constance, ¬£100 for her marriage portion. He instructed his two sons to ‚Äòlive rightwisely and never to take the state of baron upon them if they may leave it from them, nor to desire to be great about princes for it is dangerous‚Äô. He died on 12 October. In 1488 the wardship of his eldest son and heir, William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy, was granted to his brother, James (d. 1492), third son of Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy. Marriage and issue Mountjoy married, about 1477, Lora Berkeley (d. 1501), the daughter of Edward Berkeley (d. March 1506) of Beverston Castle, Gloucestershire, son of Sir Maurice de Berkeley by his wife Lora FitzHugh, and Christian Holt (d. 1468), second daughter and coheir of Richard Holt, esquire, by whom he had two sons and two daughters: *William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy. *Rowland Blount, who died in 1509 without issue. *Lora Blount (d. 1480) *Constance Blount, who married Sir Thomas Tyrrell of Heron in East Horndon, Essex, son of Sir Thomas Tyrrell of Heron (d. 1512), by whom she was the mother of John Tyrrell (d. 1540), esquire, Sir Henry Tyrrell (d. 20 May 1588), Sir William Tyrrell, Thomas Tyrrell, Charles Tyrrell and George Tyrrell. After Mountjoy's death, his widow, Lora (n√©e Berkeley), married secondly, in 1485, Sir Thomas Montgomery (d. 2 January 1495) of Faulkbourne, Essex, by whom she had no issue, and thirdly Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond, by whom she had a daughter, Elizabeth Butler. Lora (n√©e Berkeley) was buried in New Abbey, London, with her second husband.

The film is co-directed by Brendan Fletcher and features Indigenous Australian women including Purcell, actress Deborah Mailman and politician Kathryn Hay. Following the book and film, Purcell wrote a fictionalised dramatisation under the same title. Book Purcell got the idea for a book featuring interviews of Indigenous Australian women following the success of her semi-autobiographical play Box the Pony. After seeing the play someone suggested that Purcell find other indigenous women to tell their stories. Purcell sought out nine other indigenous women who personally inspired her, some professional, some not. The interviewees comprised politician and former Miss Australia Kathryn Hay, actress Deborah Mailman, netball player Sharon Finnan, United Nations youth delegate Tammy Williams, Rosanna Angus, Cilla Malone, Frances Rings, Lisa Fraser-Gooda and Rachel Perkins. To initiate discussion, Purcell asked each woman the question \\"Out of the five senses, which one do you relate to and what is your first pleasurable memory of that sense?\\" Her partner Bain Stewart gave her the idea of filming the interviews and using them as the basis for a documentary. Further interviews were conducted over the telephone, particularly when participants felt uncomfortable opening up on-camera. The interviews explored the topics of identity, family and culture in relation to Indigenous Australian women. Film Purcell used the documentary footage of the interviews as the basis for the film. Only five of the women from the book are featured in the film ‚Äî Hay, Mailman, Williams, Angus and Malone. In addition to the solo interviews conducted for the book, Purcell filmed the women talking over dinner at a restaurant in Sydney. The documentary was finished before the book was published. Release and reception The film premiered at the inaugural Tribeca Film Festival and was shown at the Melbourne and Sydney film festivals. It was screened on the Australian network SBS on 30 August 2002. It won the Inside Film Award for Best Documentary. The book was published in June 2002 by Hodder Headline Australia. Realist artist Robert Hannaford painted portraits of each of the ten womenBlack chicks , www.roberthannaford.com.au which, along with stills from the documentary, made up a travelling art exhibition.

She has been widely recognized for her contributions to the civil rights movements, poverty elimination efforts, and the emergence of the youth development field in the United States. Among the numerous awards she has received, Stoneman was awarded a MacArthur \\"genius\\" Fellowship (1996), and the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship (2007).  Early life and education  Stoneman was born and raised in Belmont, Massachusetts. She graduated from Belmont High School in 1959. She received her B.A. in history and science from Harvard University in 1963. The following year she moved to New York City and joined the civil rights movement through the Harlem Action Group. Stoneman lived and worked in Harlem for the next 24 years, receiving her M.A. in early childhood education from Bank Street College of Education in 1972. She received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Bank Street College of Education in 1994.  Early career  Stoneman began her work in Harlem in 1964 by organizing summer preschool programs for children who were entering first grade with no early education. She began her teaching career at PS 92 in Harlem, as a second-grade teacher. In 1965, Stoneman became a Head Start teacher at the East Harlem Block Schools and, in 1969, was promoted by parents who made up the board of directors, to executive director.  YouthBuild  In 1978, Stoneman founded the Youth Action Program, under the aegis of the East Harlem Block Schools, when she organized groups of local teenagers to undertake a variety of community improvement projects of their own design. One of these was a project to rebuild an abandoned building in East Harlem; this became the model for YouthBuild. Stoneman created the Youth Action Program to \\"mobilize teenagers to become a positive force for change.\\" In 1984, she led the city-wide expansion of the housing construction program, and in 1988 she began a national replication of the program model that had by then been named YouthBuild. In 1990, she established YouthBuild USA as an independent nonprofit to continue to spread the YouthBuild program nationwide. By 1992, Stoneman was overseeing 20 YouthBuild programs across 11 states. Stoneman worked with then-Massachusetts Senator John Kerry to develop legislation which would authorize YouthBuild as a federal program. The bill was passed in 1992, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, and funded within the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. As a result of its ongoing success under Stoneman's leadership, the federalYouthBuild program has received bipartisan support through five administrations, resulting in over 250 YouthBuild programs in the United States, the distribution to local nonprofit and public sponsoring organizations of over $1.4 billion of federal funds and the production of over 28,000 units of affordable housing by over 130,000 YouthBuild students. In 2001, Stoneman oversaw the beginning of YouthBuild's international expansion in South Africa, which spread to 21 counties by 2016. YouthBuild programs enable young low-income people to ‚Äúrebuild their communities and their lives, breaking the cycle of poverty with a commitment to work, education, family and community.\\" The YouthBuild program has five core components: Construction, education, personal counseling, leadership development and graduate opportunity. Students spend every other week on a job site, learning the construction trade by building affordable homes for their own communities, while working toward earning a GED or high school diploma. 93 percent of students have left high school without a diploma prior to YouthBuild, and about one-third have been court-involved. The program, provides both housing for low-income residents and gives students the opportunity to gain experience utilizing marketable job skills, while completing their high school education and preparing for college. It addresses in one intervention the key issues facing low-income communities: Education, employment, violence, leadership development, and affordable housing. YouthBuild programs are now funded by the US Department of Labor, which provides funding directly to local community-based organizations through an annual competitive process. YouthBuild USA provides training and technical assistance to these federal grantees under contract with the US Department of Labor, and also leads a national affiliated network of YouthBuild programs that choose to contribute to the YouthBuild movement whether or not they are funded by the federal government in any particular year. In 2012, Stoneman orchestrated the founding and development of the National Council of Young Leaders, which in 2015 launched a national grassroots movement of low-income young adults called Opportunity Youth United. When Stoneman retired from her role as CEO of YouthBuild USA in 2017 she was she was succeeded by John Valverde. Stoneman now directs her full-time attention to her role as senior advisor to Opportunity Youth United.

It was completed in New York, on October 21, 1927. The composition commemorates the one hundredth anniversary of the death of Franz Schubert. Typical of Godowsky's composition style, the piece contains dense contrapuntal, polyphonic, and chromatic writing.  Historical background  Godowsky remarked in the work's preface: > \\"This composition, written on the eve of the hundredth anniversary of Franz > Schubert's death, is my heartfelt tribute to this precious and prolific > genius, who, despite his short and uneventful life, succeeded so admirably > in translating our innermost emotions into music. With the exception of > Chopin, I know of no other composer whose lyricism have touched the heart of > so many; whose melodies have become so thoroughly the treasured property of > all civilized nations; whose tone-imageries have so sensitized and refined > our poetic susceptibilities. I will feel fully rewarded, should this > contribution to the approaching commemoration prove to be worthy of the > occasion.\\" Description of form The opening bars of the passacaglia The work is a passacaglia based on the first 8 measures of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony. The Passacaglia is made of forty-four variations, a cadenza and four-part fugue. Reactions The Passacaglia gained notoriety after pianist Vladimir Horowitz reportedly gave up on the piece, claiming that six hands, not two, were required to play it. Abram Chasins, who heard Godowsky perform this piece in one of his gatherings, remarked, \\"This was sheer enchantment, both the work itself and Godowsky's pianism. It had the cool, colorful clarity of a stained- glass window. Although I was greatly moved and impressed by what I heard, Godowsky's effortless mastery made me unaware of the vastness of his pianistic feat that night.\\" (Rimm, The Composer-Pianists) Publication The Passacaglia is currently copyrighted by Carl Fischer, Inc. and is published within The Godowsky Collection, Vol. 1: Original Compositions for Piano Solo.

Also known as the Deer Island House of Industry and later, House of Correction, it held people convicted of drunkenness, illegal possession of drugs, disorderly conduct, larceny, and other crimes subject to relatively short-term sentencing. When it closed in 1991, some 1,500 inmates were being held at Deer Island. History=House of Industry Originally, Deer Island's House of Industry (est. 1853) was an almshouse. It was one of several efforts on the island to accommodate poor children and adults. However, by around 1880 \\"without any change in the legal appellation 'House of Industry,' that term has come to be understood as designating its penal character.\\" An article in the national Frank Leslie's Sunday Magazine (1884) described the prisoners on Deer Island in the 1880s: \\"they in the main are from the lowest stratum of the cosmopolitan society of New England's metropolis, embracing representatives of almost every nationality under the sun, and from the shortness of the sentences, many being confined for 10 days only, for nonpayment of one dollar and costs for drunkenness, and none for more than a year.\\" House of Correction Prior to 1896, the Suffolk County \\"House of Correction was located in South Boston. ... By Chapter 536 sec. 15 of the Acts of 1896 ... all the prisoners sentenced there were transferred to the former House of Industry on Deer Island. ... The last inmates were transferred from the South Boston facility by October 1902.\\" In the 20th century, the prison was administered by the Penal Institutions Department (c. 1941) and the Penal Commissioner of Boston (c. 1990). In 1991 about 880 inmates were transferred permanently to the Suffolk County House of Correction in South Boston. The Deer Island prison buildings were razed in 1992 to prepare for the construction of the Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant, an outcome of the Clean Water Act.Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, Mass.), December 29, 1991; p.A10.

In 2001, a carving expert and her geologist father found the AVM Runestone, told the press that it was proof of early Viking or Norse settlement in Minnesota, and began an investigation to prove its authenticity. The creators came forward with their story that it was purely a hoax and not an artifact of Viking explorers. Discovery and investigation In the spring of 2001, stone carving expert Janey Westin, of Minneapolis, and her father, Robert G. Johnson, an adjunct professor in the geology department of the University of Minnesota, were making a systematic survey of stones in the vicinity of the Kensington Runestone Park, for the Research Team set up to further understanding of the Kensington Runestone. Investigating a small island in a lake on the farm of Arlen and Ruby Sabolik, about 400 metres (1/4 mile) from the 1898 find site, on May 13, Westin found the carved letters \\"AVM\\" on a lichen-covered, pinkish- brown granite gneiss boulderHenrik Williams The \\"AVM\\" Stone from Minnesota (Kensington II) in Nytt om runer 17 (2002, publ. 2004) (about 110 cm or 43 inches long, weighing perhaps a tonne\\"Second runestone examined\\" in The American Edge (Fall 2001) , American Petrographic Services) which they had inspected previously in different light conditions. They took photographs and reported their find. Two weeks later, they returned to the site with Minneapolis geologist Scott Wolter and removed lichen to reveal more inscribed characters: the date 1363 in the same pentadic numerals as seen on the Kensington Runestone and a second line of three runes, possibly \\"ASU\\", \\"XSU\\" or \\"XSV\\". Although the symbols of the top line were similar to those on the stone found in 1898, those in the second line were not. In June, the Runestone Museum in Alexandria established a Special Committee to investigate the discovery and contacted archaeologists. On June 9, the site was carefully mapped and documented; on July 11, the stone was removed. Three archaeologists from Minnesota institutions conducted a preliminary dig of nine test-holes at and around the site, on July 25, finding no evidence of Norse presence. They found a few Native American artifacts, including two quartz flakes, probably waste from arrowhead production. The discovery was announced in the Minneapolis Star Tribune on August 11, 2001,Peg Meier, \\"Second mystery stone unearthed in Kensington\\", in the Minneapolis Star Tribune (Aug 11, 2001) with Westin pre-empting accusations by making it very clear that she had not carved the stone. The team suggested that the stone might have been made as a grave marker for some of the Norse explorers. After a public display and press conference at Kensington, the stone was taken to Wolter's St. Paul laboratory for detailed photography and analysis of the weathering of stone and carving. The state archaeologist, Mark Dudzik, was skeptical, maintaining the position that it was \\"just not logical\\" to believe that Scandinavian explorers ‚Äî who, he argued, specialized in exploiting resources along coastlines ‚Äî had penetrated to Minnesota in the 1360s. Russell Fridley, a former director of the Minnesota Historical Society, expressed a similar view with the observation that \\"It's a great testimony to Scandinavian humor on the frontier.\\" Immediately after the announcement, local Norse enthusiast Bob Berg came forward to report that he had found the stone while undertaking a similar survey in late 1994Tim Post, \\"Proof or Hoax?\\" Minnesota Public Radio (Aug 14, 2001) and reported on it in April 1995 to the Viking research group of which he was a member. Their firm conclusion had been that it was a hoax, not worth further effort. Confession and explanation On September 5, 2001, Kari Ellen Gade, then chair of the Department of Germanic Studies at Indiana University, and Jana K. Schulman, associate professor in English at Southeastern Louisiana University, wrote a letter to the Minnesota Historical Society. They explained that in June 1985, while students at the University of Minnesota, they and three friends (who chose to remain anonymous) had carved the AVM stone with a hammer and chisel as a test of willingness to believe in mystery artifacts (and \\"for fun\\").Eric A. Powell, \\"Runestone Fakery,\\" Archaeology, vol. 55 no. 1 (Jan/Feb 2002) Archaeological Institute of America. Illustrated. They also revealed that the odd runes on the second line were supposed to read \\"ALU\\" (a pagan magical invocation) in an older style of runes, but the chisel had slipped. Breaking the news on November 5 on behalf of the Special Committee, Scott Wolter ‚Äî who had found \\"specific points that bothered me\\" during his scientific investigation ‚Äî accepted the confession, saying \\"I give them credit for coming forward and admitting it.\\" Westin was less forgiving: She had paid for transportation of the stone to its initial safe storage and had devoted time and energy that could have gone \\"into my work, where it belonged.\\" Gade stated that the confession was made specifically because \\"We saw that people were being asked to make financial contributions to have the rock tested ... we didn't feel it would be right to carry this further.\\" She also said \\"I'm sorry that people spent their time and money on the stone, but it was clearly a fake.\\" Local researcher Barry Hanson, in a book he was then writing about the original Kensington Runestone, explained the main concerns that had emerged before the confession. The scientific testing had quickly shown that the carved surfaces had too much iron pyrite, which ought long ago to have oxidized to ferrous sulfate if the carving was genuinely ancient. Also, the site, though an island in 2001, ought to have been under water in 1363.Quotations from Barry Hanson writings in Jim Richardson and Allen Richardson, Gonzo Science: Skeptics of the Kensington Runestone: The ‚ÄúBerg-AVM Runestone‚Äù Fiasco See also *Elbow Lake Runestone, another hoax planted in Minnesota Sources Category:Minnesota culture Category:Pseudoarchaeology Category:Hoaxes in the United States Category:Archaeological forgeries Category:American folklore Category:North American runestone hoaxes Category:2001 hoaxes Category:1985 hoaxes ","title":"AVM Runestone"},{"id":"25891142","text":"Danny Patrick (born 25 April 1972) is a film director and screenwriter.

He is the Gardiner Chair of Music at the University of Glasgow and is music director of the Dunedin Consort with whom he has made award-winning recordings in historically informed performance. Many of them feature reconstructions of a specific historical performance, such as Bach's first Christmas services on Christmas Day in Leipzig. Education and career Butt was educated at Solihull School on a music scholarship. In 1979 he began his undergraduate education at University of Cambridge, where he held the position of organ scholar at King's College from 1979 to 1982. His organ teachers at Cambridge included Peter Hurford and Gillian Weir. He received his PhD at Cambridge in 1987. After graduation, he lectured at the University of Aberdeen and was a Fellow of Magdalene College at the University of Cambridge. In 1989, he became university organist and assistant professor of music at the University of California, Berkeley; in 1992, he was promoted to associate professor, as well as director of the University Chamber Chorus. He prepared that choir for Gustav Leonhardt to conduct in Bach's Magnificat and the related cantata Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, BWV 10, at the 1992 Berkeley Festival and Exhibition; Butt later said that he had come to know Leonhardt \\"fairly well\\" and that \\"I learned a lot when preparing choirs for him back in my California days.\\" In 1997, he gave what one critic calls \\"memorable readings\\" of Handel's organ concertos. as guest organ soloist with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. In autumn of 1997, Butt returned to the University of Cambridge as University Lecturer, Director of Studies for Music at King's College, and Fellow of King's College. He also became the founding director of King's Voices mixed chorus. Musicians that he inspired during this time include the organist Robert Quinney and harpsichordist and director Julian Perkins. Since October 2001, Butt has been the Gardiner Chair of Music at the University of Glasgow; he also served as Head of the Music Department from 2001 to 2005. Since 2003 he has conducted the Dunedin Consort, a professional ensemble in Edinburgh for performances in historically informed performance. At the end of the 2013/14 academic session, Butt was also appointed Interim Director of Music of the Glasgow University Chapel Choir, after James Grossmith left that post to become chorus master of the Royal Swedish Opera. As a guest conductor, Butt has appeared with Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, the English Concert, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the Irish Baroque Orchestra, the Royal Scottish Academy of Music Chamber Orchestra and Chorus, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the Aurora Orchestra, the Portland Baroque Orchestra, the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra, the Halle, and orchestras at the Berkeley Early Music Festival and G√∂ttingen International Handel Festival. Publications Butt has published numerous articles for scholarly publications and for general-audience publications. Books have included * Bach Interpretation: Articulation Marks in Primary Sources of J.S.Bach (Cambridge University Press, 1990; the book is based on Butt's doctoral thesis, and is described as the \\"first comprehensive assessment of J. S. Bach's use of articulation marks (i.e. slurs and dots) in the large body of primary sources.\\" In 1992, the book won the first William H.

He co-edited the Cambridge Companion to Bach (1997) ‚Äì for which he contributed two articles on Bach's metaphysics ‚Äì was consultant editor for the Oxford Companion to Bach, and joint editor (together with Tim Carter) of the Cambridge History of Seventeenth Century Music (2005). Discography As a solo harpsichordist, organist, or clavichordist, Butt made eleven recordings for the Harmonia mundi label, of music by Johann Sebastian Bach, Johann Kuhnau, Johann Pachelbel, Georg Philipp Telemann, Henry Purcell, John Blow, Matthew Locke, Juan Bautista Cabanilles, Girolamo Frescobaldi, and Sir Edward Elgar. In 2004, he recorded Bach's Pastorella for organ, BWV 590, for the Delphian label in Glasgow. In July 2013, using a harpsichord modeled on an original built by Michael Mietke, Butt recorded Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier for the Linn label; it was released in November 2014.Gramophone (magazine), \\"Butt alone for Bach,\\" Gramophone (magazine), May 2014, p.39 As a continuo player, Butt has recorded with many ensembles, including the English Chamber Orchestra and American Bach Soloists. In 1991‚Äì92, for Harmonia mundi, he and Baroque violinist Elizabeth Blumenstock recorded the Bach sonatas for violin and harpsichord, BWV 1014‚Äì19, 1021 and 1023. In 2014, he recorded BWV 1014‚Äì19 again, this time with violinist Lucy Russell for the Linn label; it was released in 2015. Butt's first recording as a conductor, made in 1994 for the Centaur label, featured music of Orlando Gibbons sung by the U.C. Berkeley Chamber Choir with viol accompaniment; for the disc, he also recorded keyboard works of Gibbons on the organ. Since 2005, Butt has conducted recordings of the Dunedin Consort and Players for the Linn label, many featuring reconstructions of a specific historical performance. These include: * 2006: Handel's Messiah. This was the first recording of a reconstruction of the work in its first performance, which took place in Dublin in 1742. The release won the 2007 Gramophone Award for Best Baroque Vocal Album and the 2008 MIDEM Baroque Award at the Cannes Classical Awards. * March 2008: Bach's St Matthew Passion. This was the first recording of the version from Bach's final performance, which also took place in 1742. * November 2008: Handel‚Äôs Acis and Galatea in the original performing version of 1718. This release was nominated for a Gramophone Award. * 2010: Bach's Mass in B minor. This is the first recording to use the new critical edition by Joshua Rifkin, which follows Bach's final version of the score from 1748‚Äì50 exclusively from beginning to end. (Other editions have included elements from a 1733 version of the Kyrie and Gloria, and some posthumous changes by Bach's son, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach). * 2012: Handel's Esther in the first reconstructable version of the work, from 1720; Butt reconstructed the performing edition from Handel's autograph and three other historical sources. * 2013: Bach's St. John Passion, in a liturgical reconstruction based on Good Friday Vespers services in Leipzig. In March 2013 the disc was named \\"Record of the Month\\" by Gramophone and \\"Recording of the Month\\" by BBC Music Magazine. * September 2013: Bach's Brandenburg Concertos with the Dunedin Consort. It was a Gramophone \\"Choice\\" in October 2013. and was a finalist in the Baroque Instrumental category for the 2014 Gramophone Awards; it was also nominated for the International Classical Music Awards in the Baroque Instrumental category. In this recording, the ensemble used the pitch standard of A=392 or \\"tief-Cammerton,\\" a whole tone below the modern standard pitch and associated with the French royal court at the time; Butt notes that many German-speaking courts, including the one at C√∂then where Bach wrote these concertos, \\"attempted to emulate French practice.\\" He also mentions instruments from the time and place pitched to this standard. Still, he notes that \\"While C√∂then court pitch was likely to have been somewhere near this, it is unlikely that pitch was ever standardized as precisely as we might often assume or wish.\\"John Butt, liner notes to the Dunedin Consort recording of the Brandenburg Concertos, Linn Records CDK 430 * March 2014: Mozart's Requiem with the Dunedin Consort. This is the first recording of David Black's new critical edition, published in 2012, of the Franz Xaver S√ºssmayr completion of the Requiem. The recording seeks to re-create the forces used at the first complete performance in January, 1793; it also includes a performance of Black's reconstruction of a December 1791 performance of the Introit and Kyrie sections.

Personal life John Butt and his wife Sally have five childrenJohn Butt, Bach‚Äôs Dialogue with Modernity: Perspectives on the Passions, Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. x, He is the nephew of a professional musician, and son of the distinguished biochemist Wilfred Butt ‚Äì who was, Butt says, \\"a keen amateur\\" musician and was at one time a member of the chorus of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. When an interviewer for the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment asked John Butt about his preferences, he expressed enthusiasm for the practice of tai chi, the films of Alfred Hitchcock, the symphonies of Anton Bruckner (adding, \\"I can‚Äôt understand why so many people find Bruckner boring\\"), and the In Search of Lost Time novels of Marcel Proust (the central character, he said, is \\"a bit of a weed in many respects, but what a complex, detailed and wonderfully ironic weed! No-one else captures so strikingly the paradoxes of consciousness and the little inconsistencies and delusions that we all try to hide from the world\\"). He also told the interviewer, \\"I feel that most of the things at which I am successful are only a matter of momentary luck!\\" On 17 September 2014 he published a letter in The Herald supporting the \\"No\\" position in 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and arguing that independence would damage classical music. He argued that \\"Classical and contemporary music surely flourish best in a multi-cultural, international, environment, one that is extraordinarily well provided within the UK (and which would be even better if more Scots were to reclaim some of their ownership of it),\\" decried the \\"insidious synecdochal reductionism of the independence cause,\\" and concluded, \\"Such a simplistic attitude suggests that the risks of looking inwards and losing the dynamism of Scotland's own cultures are very real once we begin to live behind the Tartan Curtain.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Professor John Butt Glasgow University Category:Organists Category:Alumni of King's College, Cambridge Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:People educated at Solihull School Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Bach musicians Category:Bach scholars Category:Fellows of the British Academy Category:Winners of the Royal Academy of Music/ Kohn Foundation Bach Prize Category:Recipients of the Medal of the Royal College of Organists Category:Bach conductors Category:21st-century conductors (music) Category:21st-century organists ","title":"John Butt (musician)"},{"id":"25891161","title":"Manuherikia (New Zealand electorate)"},{"id":"25891163","text":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 412, adopted unanimously on July 7, 1977, after examining the application of the Republic of Djibouti for membership in the United Nations, the Council recommended to the General Assembly that Djibouti be admitted.

Boyd investigates visual pollution in Australian aesthetic, in relation to architecture and the suburbs. In the text he coins the doctrine \\"featurism\\" to describe the state of Australian architectural design. Whilst not entirely a tragedy for the Australian community, Boyd proposes that education in design, landscaping and architecture can be a means to resolve the ugliness he observed. Summary The book can be seen as an \\"attack\\", or criticism, on Australia's built landscape. Boyd's three main criticisms stem from three ideas: the Australian obsession with \\"featurism\\"-a fixation on parts rather than the whole, the use of building materials and styles that are unsympathetic to the country's landscape/climate, and the culling of trees in order to \\"divert\\" drains, prevent leaf clogging and other immaterial issues. Boyd's belief that trees are not a feature, or a byproduct of design, but rather a fundamental landscaping necessity, something unrecognised by Australian homeowners and city planners who opt for low maintenance. It also channeled the \\"cultural cringe\\", as well as drawing comparisons to the man- made post modernist landscapes of North America and to a lesser extent Europe.ABC Lateline: Robin Boyd's The Australian Ugliness 50 years on, 31 March 2010 Boyd's belief was that because Australia was in its infancy at the time of his critique, it had not developed a strong historic character like Europe, and thus its architectural landscape was a bombardment of confused style and mixed ideas. Reception and influence The Australian Ugliness was first published by F. W. Cheshire, Melbourne. That firm's publishing director, Andrew Fabinyi, approved the book for publication in defiance of the \\"lugubrious advice of sundry experts\\" who claimed the book \\"had an impossible title and would not have public anyway\\".John Hetherington, \\"Publishing Venture Born Out of 1939 Upheaval\\", The Age, 23 February 1963, p. 18. The book sold over 10,000 copies by early 1963. After the book's first publication, Boyd was criticised for being \\"unpatriotic\\" by the Australian mainstream press. The book‚Äôs Afterword acknowledges that it reads as a ‚Äòrage‚Äô and ‚Äòdiatribe‚Äô, and a 'satirical portrait'. As the years passed, the book became somewhat of a legacy and is now regarded as an important book regarding Australian design, culture and architecture. The book opened up debate about design, architecture and urban planning in the country. It has received various reprints and adjustments over the years. In the following years, Boyd's book inspired derivative and reactionary works, ranging from Donald Gazzard's more visual Australian Outrage (1966) and Look Here! Considering the Australian Environment (1968).

It has branches in Watford, Berkshire, Essex, Somerset and Cornwall, and caters for a variety of animals, both pets and wildlife. They operate a number of premises, including Trindledown Farm, the UK's only retirement home for elderly pets. Formerly known as the Animal Welfare Trust (AWT), it originated from the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection in the 1950s. Origin The NAWT was founded in 1971 as a charity, and was originally known as the Animal Welfare Trust (National was added in 1996 to celebrate the charity's 25th anniversary). The origin of the organisation can be traced to 1958 when the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) established BUAV Dog Rescue. The ideals of this new rescue organisation was to prevent dogs or puppies being bought at markets, in order to prevent them from going to laboratories for vivisection. In 1965 the name was changed to BUAV Animal Aid, in recognition that the work was not limited to only dogs. In 1971 BUAV members established a separate charity named the Animal Welfare Trust as they felt the work of BUAV Animal Aid was departing from its original aims. From 1979, the AWT began to work with the Dr Hadwen Trust for Humane Research from its Hendon & Aldenham Boarding Kennels, in Watford, sharing facilities and staff. The Dr Hadwen Trust is now separate from the NAWT, although they work together as appropriate. The boarding kennels in Watford were purchased in 1981, and were established as the first AWT Rescue and Re-homing centre. The centre was expanded in 1986 with expanded facilities for larger animals and more exercise paddocks. The second centre at Heaven's Gate Farm in Somerset was acquired in the early 1990s, and the third centre at Trindledown Farm, Berkshire in the late 1990s. The centre in Cornwall was acquired on the request of Molly Wyatt in 1997 who had previously run it as an independent animal re-homing centre, with the site rebuilt in 2008. The Thurrock centre is currently run out of rented boarding kennels. Trindledown Farm Trindledown Farm is the UK's only sanctuary for elderly pets. It is set in of fields, near Great Shefford, Berkshire. Formerly used as an equestrian centre and livery yard, it has the capacity to home 25 dogs and 10 cats at a time. Other animals accommodated include alpacas, horses, pigs, sheep, cows and birds. Each cat or dog has a private area equipped with central heating, armchairs, sofas, beds and televisions. The idea is to make each private area similar to the set-up of \\"an old person's sitting room\\", which was developed by executive director Patricia Fraser. The centre was opened in June, 2001, by DJ Bruno Brookes.

He is remembered as the author of the drama Kegyencz (\\"The Favourite\\", 1841).Emil Reich, Hungarian Literature: an historical and critical survey (London: Jarrold and Sons, 1898), p. 215 In older books in English he is given the name \\"Ladislas Teleky\\". Teleki was born in Pest to L√°szl√≥ Teleki III and Johanna M√©sz√°ros. On his father's death in 1821 he was raised by his elder half-brother J√≥zsef Teleki (1790‚Äì1855). Throughout the 1830s he travelled through Europe. On returning to Hungary he became a politician, first in Transylvania (where his brother became governor) and then in the National Assembly, with a particular concern for the equitable representation of different nationalities within the Empire. In 1848 came news of the revolution in Paris, and he travelled to Paris as envoy. The failure of the Hungarian revolution led to his banishment, and in 1851 he was sentenced to death in absentia. During the 1850s he lived in Switzerland and did what he could to assist Lajos Kossuth, despite their disagreements. In November 1860 he travelled to Dresden under an assumed name in order to see the widow Auguszta Lipthay. He was arrested on 16 December by the Saxon police, and four days later was taken across the border into Austria where he was imprisoned until New Year's Day. After negotiation with the authorities, mediated by Emperor Franz Joseph, he was pardoned and permitted to return to Hungary on the condition that he gave up revolutionary politics and foreign travel. On his return he received a hero's welcome, and immediately resumed his political activities, directing the activities of the Resolution Party (Hat√°rozati), and insisting that the proposed reforms of 1848 be carried out without compromise. He committed suicide on 7 May, the night before a significant public debate with Ferenc De√°k on the constitutional status of the Emperor, for reasons that are unclear. The tragic news, coming only a year after the death of Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi, demoralized and bewildered the public.Alice Freifeld. Nationalism and the crowd in liberal Hungary, 1848-1914.

When the project was officially launched in January 2010 it contained 2,500 data sets and developers had already built a site that showed the location of schools according to the rating assigned to them by education watchdog Ofsted.  Data available  The Expenditure Map app, created by Ian Shortman using data from the Office for National Statistics. The interactive map visualises public expenditure data by UK region. data.gov.uk contains over 30,000 data sets from various UK Government departments. All data are non-personal and provided in a format that allows it to be reused. data.gov.uk intends to increase the use of Linked Data standards, to allow people to provide data to data.gov.uk in a way that allows for flexible and easy reuse. As of April 2010 the following UK Government departments and agencies have provided data sets to data.gov.uk: BusinessLink, the Cabinet Office, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for International Development, the Department for Transport, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Department of Health, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Home Office, Her Majesty's Treasury, Lichfield District Council, Runnymede Borough Council, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice, the Northern Ireland Office, the Ordnance Survey, and the Society of Information Technology Management.  Ordnance Survey data  When data.gov.uk was officially launched in January 2010 Ordnance Survey data was one of the key data sets that Berners-Lee and Professor Shadbolt wanted to see opened up as part of the project. Ordnance Survey data was included in data.gov.uk on 1 April 2010 and provides information on geographical locations. According to Professor Shadbolt \\"will make a real difference to the way that people make sense of the information\\".  Combined Online Information System (COINS) data  On the 3 June 2010 the Treasury released the COINS data for the financial years 2008/09 and 2009/10. The Combined Online Information System, known as COINS, operates as the UK Government's central accounting system. COINS data details the spent of all government department and their major spending programmes. The 4.3GB of COIN data included 3.2 million items for the financial year 2009/10 and was released using BitTorrent. At the time the UK government stated that data for the current financial year (2010/11) will be released in June 2011. On the 15 of June the UK Government published the COINS data for the financial years 2008/09, 2007/08, 2006/07 and 2005/06 on data.gov.uk. Within 24 hours of the release the data was also made available through the (now defunct) RA.Pid Gateway webportal run by Rosslyn Analytics. In the past the HM Treasury had refused requests to release COIN data on the grounds that it contained FOI- exempt data on future defence and security services spending. HM Treasury also cited \\"the impenetrability of the information to a lay user\\" and \\"the potential significant cost and difficulty of rebutting misunderstandings\\" as reasons for not releasing the data.  Data to be added  data.gov.uk is working with UK Government departments, agencies and local authorities to release more data. Professor Shadbolt also wants local government data included in data.gov.uk.  Data use and licensing  data.gov.uk offers a wide range of public sector data, ranging from traffic statistics to crime figures. The data can be used for private or commercial purposes.

Government project  Authorized by the UK Cabinet Office and aims for the release of public data to become \\"business as usual\\" across public bodies, as set out in Putting the Frontline First: Smarter Government, which established the UK Government's approach to public data and the release of that data. data.gov.uk amongst others delivers on the commitment made in Putting the Frontline First to integrate data from the Publications Hub for National Statistics and to release more data relating to health.  Current technology infrastructure  The site uses the CKAN platform for data publishing. There is high variability in the format and presentation of the data; some data files are available as structured raw data in a machine- readable format such as CSV, while others are only available as analysed data in a human-friendly format such as a PDF file containing a pivot table. Data.gov.uk functions as a searchable data catalog with links to data that is hosted by the individual UK Government departments, and does not host data itself. In addition to the data searchable through the data.gov.uk site, since 2016 a very small number of datasets have been made available as \\"registers\\" through the Registers Service. Registers are structured raw datasets that are intended to be a canonical, reliable, and always up-to-date source of data. Registers share a common API, and can be read by both humans and machines. They are offered as JSON, CSV, and RDF files, the latter allowing to link multiple registers together. As of January 2019, the Registers Service is in its alpha phase, with 39 registers published and actively maintained.  Similar projects in the UK  On the 29 January 2010 Boris Johnson, mayor of London, opened an online data warehouse containing more than 200 data sets from London city authorities.  Similar projects in other countries  There is a growing trend amongst governments toward more data transparency. In the US the Obama administration launched data.gov, which opens up data from various departments, including the United States Department of Defense and NASA. The European Public Sector Information (PSI) Platform maintains a list of PSI data catalogues provided by governments and providing direct access to data. The European Commission has created two portals for the European Union: the EU Open Data Portal which gives access to open data from the EU institutions, agencies and other bodies and the PublicData portal that provides datasets from local, regional and national public bodies across Europe. In the Netherlands the DataverseNL Network hosts data deposited by Dutch Universities and Institutes.

From the Scalae Caci on Palatinum, Rome The name comes from the Ancient Greek \\"œÉœÖŒΩŒ±œÖŒªŒØŒ±\\" (), which in ancient Rome referred to a group of instruments consisting mainly of wind instruments. The group was founded and at first sponsored by the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden, Netherlands in 1995 by Italian paleorganologist Walter Maioli and choreographer and anthropologist Natalie Van Ravenstein.Walter Maioli In the beginning the Synaulia‚Äôs main task was mainly educational: the reconstruction of ancient musical instruments for the Dutch archeological center, Archeon.Archeon Later the scope was widened to include a more profound study into Italy‚Äôs music and dance focusing primarily on ancient Rome. The fruits of Synaulia‚Äôs intensive study were used as material for films, serials and documentaries about ancient Rome (among them Gladiator by Ridley Scott and the television series Rome), the use of the instruments for scholastic purposes, as well as in the publication of numerous articles on the subject.Gladiator  The archeological-musical research work  aul√≤s or double flute (5th century BC, Rome, National Roman Museum) In the absence of a system of musical notation for the period in question, the reconstruction and study of ancient musical expression was based on comparative studies of iconography, textual analysis, social studies and customs, also drawing from paleorganology, ethnomusicology, archeology and historiography. The richness of the iconographic documentation, the abundance of tested theories and numerous literary connections facilitated the study and reproduction of a wide range of antique musical instruments, helping to determine, among other points of interest, their melodic and harmonic possibilities and acoustic quality. Boscoreale, around 40‚Äì30 AD. Armed with this historical information, the group‚Äôs research was then subdivided into several main research branches. The first branch was dedicated to wind instruments. The research led to the reconstruction of instruments such as syrinx, fistulae, tibiae, cornu, tuba, bucina, iynx, and rhombus. The second branch dealt with string instruments: among others the lyra, cithara, sambuca, cordae and pandura were reconstructed.Roman Musical Instruments The Greeks and Romans did not invent string instruments, but rather improved and created variations on the existing ones. The first mentions of antique string instruments such as zithers, lyres and harps were documented in the area from the Nile to Mesopotamia around 3000 BC. The lyre in particular had an essential role in Greek-Roman life. The Greek lyre was a strongly symbolic instrument made of tortoise shell (representing the intermediate life between Sky and Earth), a piece of stretched leather (a symbol of sacrifice) and two horns to which the cords were affixed (representing the celestial Bull). This instrument represented a symbolic altar, uniting Sky with Earth. In many representations other instruments often accompany the string instruments. The most common duo is the lyrae et citarae drawn together by the Pan flute. Other frequently represented combinations are stringed instruments and tibiae, double instruments with reed and double flutes with the tympanum and other percussion instruments. The third branch was dedicated to percussion, and work was undertaken to reconstruct the tympanum, cymbal, scabillum, sistrum, rasum and other celebrated instruments from the late imperial period, the so-called ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù (aurea aetas).Golden Age  Scientific collaborations  Other collaborators as consultants and collaborators of the project are Nathalie van Ravenstein, Luce Maioli, Ivan Gibellini, Anna Maria Liberati (Museo della Civilt√† Romana, Maurizio Pellegrini (Museo Nazionale Etrusco di Villa Giulia, Rome) Romolo Staccioli e Maria Grazia Iodice (Universit√† La Sapienza, Rome), Paola Elisabetta Simeoni (Museo Nazionale delle Arti e Tradizioni Popolari), Maria Grazia Siliato, Marcus Junkelmann Ratzennhofen (Germany), Carlo Merlo (Clesis, Rome), Magdi Kenawy (Accademia d‚ÄôEgitto, Rome), Werner Hilgers (Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn, Germany), il H.P.

The abuse is alleged to have occurred in the 1970s.Ealing Gazette In October 2017, Andrew Soper (known as Father Laurence), former abbot of Ealing Abbey, was found guilty on 19 sexual offences against pupils of St Benedict's school in the 1970s and 1980s. Buckfast Abbey Father Paul Couch was jailed for ten years in 2007, on two counts of serious sexual assault and 11 of indecent assault. He had committed the offences against six boys between 1972 and 1993 during two periods at Buckfast Abbey Preparatory School in Devon; he was a Royal Navy chaplain from 1978 until 1983 and again from 1992. Father William Manahan pleaded guilty in 2007 at Exeter Crown Court to eight charges of sexually assaulting pupils at the same school between 1971 and 1978, and was jailed for 15 months. The school closed in 1994. Ampleforth College In 1995 Fr Bernard Green, then a housemaster at Ampleforth College, was arrested after indecently assaulting a sleeping boy in one of the school's dormitories.

He had previous convictions for paedophilic offences, committed elsewhere in the 1970s.http://www.independent.co.uk ‚Ä∫ News ‚Ä∫ UK 6 August 1992 David Lowe, a paedophile and serial sexual abuser, had sexually abused young boys, firstly, at Westminster Cathedral Choir School, London, and, secondly at the Roman Catholic Benedictine Ampleforth College in Yorkshire. Subsequent to and despite his history, he moved to Douai Abbey. A married man and a father, Lowe was appointed Deputy Headmaster at the school in the 1990s, and there is no suggestion that he sexually abused at Douai. Lowe was jailed for 10 years in 2015 for indecent assaults. Father Terence Charles Fitzpatrick, Roman Catholic priest/monk of Douai School, whilst he was Roman Catholic parish priest at St Osburg's Roman Catholic church in Coventry, sexually abused a woman, Pamela Brown, between 1989 and 1991. She had psychological issues and approached him for guidance. Fitzpatrick duped her into performing sexual activity \\"games\\" under the pretense that they were part of the help she required from him, and stating that the sexual activity was carried out in the name of God. Brown was awarded damages at Birmingham County Court. Fitzpatrick returned to Douai Abbey and continued to serve four Roman Catholic parishes in Berkshire. The Douai Abbey school closed in 1999. Downside School In 2004, a Benedictine monk was jailed for 18 months after taking indecent images of schoolboys and possessing child pornography when he was a teacher at Downside School. In January 2012, Father Richard White, a monk who formerly taught at the school, was jailed for five years for gross indecency and indecent assault against a pupil in the late 1980s. White, 66, who was known to pupils as Father Nick, had been allowed to continue teaching after he was first caught abusing a child in 1987 and was able to go on to groom and assault another pupil in the junior school. He was placed on a restricted ministry after the second incident, but was not arrested until 2010. Two other Downside monks, also former teachers, received police cautions during an 18-month criminal trial. In November 2017, the national Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) started to examine evidence of children being targeted for abuse at the school, along with another major Catholic school Ampleforth Abbey, as part of its investigation into the prevalence of paedophilia in the English Benedictine Congregation and its failures in protecting young people over many decades. IICSA heard that children at the two schools could still be \\"at risk\\". The enquiry heard evidence that in 2012, the then headmaster, Father Leo Maidlow Davis, who was the senior monk at Downside Abbey from 2014 until 2018, made trips with a loaded wheelbarrow to a distant part of its grounds, where he made a bonfire, destroying staff files dating back to the early 1980s that might have contained evidence of child abuse at the school. Father Charles Fitzgerald-Lombard, abbot of Downside from 1990 to 1998, was among three Downside abbots accused by Father Aidan Bellenger, in a private letter, of tolerating child abuse. Father Aidan, abbot from 2006 to 2014, said his predecessors \\"protected and encouraged\\" paedophile monks. Wrongdoers at the school were quietly moved between Benedictine monasteries and parishes. Reference was made to instructions from Rome to destroy documents that were damaging to priests. Father Leo insisted that his decision to make a bonfire of Downside‚Äôs staff files was prompted by a desire to \\"get rid of unnecessary old material\\". He accepted that the files should, under safeguarding requirements, have been kept for 70 years, conceding that he may have unintentionally destroyed information about child abuse. As recommended by the IICSA report, a new charitable company was set up for the school in 2019 to separate it from the monastery. In 2020 it was reported that the abbey had sold paintings at auction for over ¬£400,000 to defray legal costs. Worth Abbey Worth Abbey and Worth School were initially created as the preparatory school for Downside. In 1995, Father Andrew Brenninkmeyer was suspended following complaints that he had sexually abused other monks, including Father Jonathan Monckton, who left the monastery in 1987 after no action was taken against Father Brenninkmeyer. Father Moncton was not the only complainant. In 2001, Father John Bolton was suspended for hugging a boy inappropriately. Father John died on 26 June 2013. The headmaster at the time was Father Christopher Jamison, who is currently Abbot President of the English Benedictine Congregation. On 5 June 2018, the IICSA determined that its case study of the English Benedictine Congregation would not include Worth School and Abbey because the evidence in regard of Downside and Ampleforth is sufficient to address the English Benedictine Congregation.

It was created as a hospital in 1576 by the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg, Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn.  History  The hospital was founded by Julius Echter, Bishop of W√ºrzburg, in 1576 on the ground of a Jewish cemetery with the endowment of the abandoned monastery of Heiligenthal. It originally also accepted pilgrims, people suffering from epilepsy, and orphans.  Regional influence  The end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648 left part of the village of Th√ºngen in the hands of the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg, administered by the Juliusspital. In Gr√§fendorf the Barons of Th√ºngen and the Juliusspital in W√ºrzburg shared the lordship. The latter‚Äôs rights passed under the German Mediatisation in 1803 to Bavaria, and in 1805 to the Grand Duchy of Aschaffenburg. Also in the course of this secularization in 1803, the rights of the Prince-Bishopric of W√ºrzburg in Karsbach, and those held by the Juliusspital, passed to Bavaria, which under the terms of the Peace of Pressburg it ceded to the newly formed Grand Duchy of W√ºrzburg.http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000054/18780302/002/0011 In 1898, in an article in The Examiner comparing the status of medical education in England and overseas, reported that \\"In Germany, the faculties are more equal. In University of W√ºrzburg, owing to the large and rich Julius- Spital, the medical faculty is the most numerous.\\"  Notable staff and students  In 1776 Karl Kaspar von Siebold was appointed as head physician (Oberwundarzt) of the Juliusspital. Under his leadership, new surgical techniques were introduced, a regimen of hygiene was established, and renovation of the Theatrum Anatomicum took place. In 1805 the Juliusspital reportedly had the first modern operating theater in the world. Georg Anton Sch√§ffer studied medicine at Juliusspital's College of Medicine. He joined the Imperial Russian service as a surgeon, serving in Moscow before 1812. In 1816, Cajetan von Textor was appointed professor of surgery and Oberwundarzt in the Juliusspital. His students included Bernhard Heine (1800‚Äì1846), inventor of the osteotome. In 1863, Franz von Rinecker became director of psychiatry at the Juliusspital, and in 1872 took on additional responsibilities as director of dermatology. In 1870, Friedrich Jolly was his assistant. Buildings and architecture Juliusspital is a Baroque hospital with a courtyard and a church originally established in 1576. However, the 160 m long northern wing was added by in 1700-4. Beneath it lies the similarly-sized wine cellar. The Rococo pharmacy survived the bombing of 1945 largely undamaged. North of the Spital is a park used by the patients, fronted to the right by the Alte Anatomie (by Joseph Greising, built in 1705-14. This was renovated in 1788 and used by the medical faculty such as Albert von K√∂lliker, von Siebold or Rudolf Virchow to instruct up to 48 students in surgery and anatomy. The park also features a water basin by Jacob van der Auvera with stone dolphins and allegorical figures for the Franconian rivers Main, Tauber, Saale and Sinn. It sports the coat-of-arms of Johann Philipp von Greifenclau zu Vollraths. The buildings are maintained to a high standard - they had a new pipe organ built by Orgelbau Vleugels in 2005.http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=569G-XS61-DY2J-J3MK&csi;=8176&oc;=00240&perma;=true Today Juliusspital continues to function as a hospital and retirement home but is particularly notable for being, at 177 hectares in the Franconian wine region, the second largest winery in Germany and the biggest individual German wine grower.

Overview KiK Headquarters in B√∂nen KiK in Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki, Poland KiK was founded in 1994 by Stefan Heinig and the holding company Tengelmann Group. KiK is an acronym for (). KiK is the largest textile discounter chain in Germany and operates about 3,500 stores in Germany, Austria (since 1998), Slovenia and Czech Republic (since 2007), Hungary and Slovakia (since 2008), Croatia (since 2011), Poland (since March 2012), and Netherlands (2013). In 2017, KiK opened the first stores in Italy, and in 2018, in Romania. KiK-CEO Patrick Zahn has announced to enter the US market beginning in 2019. The first stores will be opened in the Midwest. The company employs 25,000 employees, of which the bulk share works in Germany. In 2016, the company had net revenues of ‚Ç¨1.95 billion, making it the sixth largest textile manufacturer in Germany. Starting in 2013, the company has undertaken a large modernization offensive in all its stores. By the end of 2017, all stores in Germany as well as in the foreign markets will be based on a new interior concept, making them look brighter and more pleasant. The dominant color red will be largely substituted by silver. The company sells a range of women's, men's and children's clothing, baby wear and underwear, as well as toys, accessories and home textiles. Customers can buy a complete outfit for less than 30 Euros. The focus is on basic styles with only occasional changes in its assortment. This makes the company independent of trends and seasons. The orders can be produced with long lead times form nine to 12 month without time pressure. KiK buys its products from around 500 suppliers in Bangladesh, China, Pakistan and Turkey, with Bangladesh the biggest contributor, accounting for over 40% of the orders. The products are imported to Germany on the basis of sea freight and hence distributed to the nine foreign markets KiK is operating in. KiK has been a member of the German Partnership for Sustainable Textiles since June 2015. This initiative by the German Ministry for Development and Cooperation, which is funded by commercial enterprises, non-governmental organizations, federal organizations and trade unions, is based on the belief that an improvement to manufacturing conditions in countries like Bangladesh or Pakistan cannot be brought about by individual companies alone. Online Shop Since 2013 KiK operates an Online Shop. Marketing KiK has, in the past, sponsored a number of football teams, namely Arminia Bielefeld, Werder Bremen, Hansa Rostock and VfL Bochum. They currently sponsor referees of the Austrian Football Bundesliga and in January 2009 also sponsored the German national team at the 2009 World Men's Handball Championship. Verona Pooth has been the face of KiK's television advertising campaign. The cooperation ended in 2015.  Sustainability  The company has published four sustainability reports. In October 2015, KiK banned plastic sacs from all its shops in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Hungary. Through this measure, the company saves about 33 million plastic sacs per year. KiK is a member of the German government's Partnership for Sustainable Textiles, a multi-stakeholder initiative to bring about social, ecological and economic improvements along the textile supply chain. KiK is among more than 150 members including Otto Group, Adidas, Hugo Boss and Puma and is engaged in all the initiative's working groups. It was among the first members of the Partnership to publish its catalogue of measures designed to provide greater transparency to consumers for products sold in Germany. The retailer is the first company in Germany with a contract in place which holds auditing companies legally liable for findings in the reports.  Criticism = Building collapse at Savar  On 24 April 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza commercial building collapsed in Savar, a sub-district near Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. At least 1,127 people died and over 2,438 were injured. The factory housed a number of separate garment factories employing around 5,000 people, and manufactured apparel for brands including the Benetton Group, Joe Fresh, The Children's Place, Primark, Monsoon, and DressBarn. Of the 29 brands identified as having sourced products from the Rana Plaza factories, only 9 attended meetings held in November 2013 to agree a proposal on compensation to the victims. KiK was the second German company to contribute to the compensation fund. Several companies refused to sign including Walmart, Carrefour, Bonmarch√©, Mango, Auchan. The agreement was also signed by Primark, Loblaws, Bonmarch√© and El Corte Ingl√©s. The retailer was one of the first German signatories of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh set up in May 2013 to inspect and remediate factories for fire, electrical and building safety, and was also among a group of global union federations and brands that have prepared the continuation of the work of the Accord in Bangladesh once its five-year remit comes to an end in 2018. Swastika- styled clothing racks KiK's swastika-styled clothing racks In 2009, a man from the German state Schleswig-Holstein pressed charges against KiK under Strafgesetzbuch ¬ß 86a, which outlaws the \\"use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations\\", for the chain using swastika-styled clothing racks in their shops. KiK describes the allegations as incomprehensible. Wages for factory workers KiK have been criticised by the Clean Clothes Campaign for their bad practices in countries such as Bangladesh, where factory workers are paid low wages. In 2006, KiK has published a Code of Conduct, which imposes an obligation to suppliers to pay a compensation to workers that covers at least the legal or the industrial minimum wage level, whichever is higher. KiK CEO Zahn has appealed on the government of Bangladesh to raise the minimum wage by ten percent.  Secret credit ratings of staff  While running almost 50,000 secret credit ratings of staff, overtime is often not paid. With the introduction of the legal minimum wage in Germany, KiK pays its staff minimum wage or higher.

He later played professional football as a backup linebacker and special teams player in the National Football League (NFL) for the Miami Dolphins from 2000 to 2003 and the Jacksonville Jaguars during the 2004 season. Early years Hendricks was born in Houston, Texas, in 1978. He attended Scarborough High School and Eisenhower High School, both in Houston. He became known as one of the best high school defensive backs in the country while playing for Eisenhower. University of Michigan Hendricks' father, Thomas Hendricks, Jr., played college football as a halfback at the University of Michigan from 1953 to 1955. Hendricks committed to Michigan in February 1996. He enrolled in the fall of 1996 and played college football as a defensive back for head coach Lloyd Carr's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1996 to 1999. As a sophomore, Hendricks started all 12 games at free safety for the undefeated 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team that outscored opponents 322‚Äì144, won the Big Ten Conference championship, defeated Washington State in the 1998 Rose Bowl, and was ranked #1 in the final AP Poll. Hendricks also started all 13 games at free safety for Michigan during the 1998 season, and completed a 37-game streak by starting all 12 games at strong safety for the 1999 Michigan team. He was selected by the conference coaches as a first-team defensive back on the 1999 All-Big Ten Conference football team. In four years at Michigan, Hendricks started 37 games and registered 222 tackles, 12 pass breakups and three interceptions.(to retrieve Hendricks' statistics, enter \\"hendricks\\" in the box for the player's last name) Professional football Hendricks was undrafted in the 2000 NFL Draft. He signed as a free agent with the Miami Dolphins where he was converted to a linebacker but cut before the start of the 2000 season. One month after being cut, Miami linebacker Zach Thomas was injured, and Hendricks was re-signed. He was released again a week after being re-signed, joined the Dolphins' developmental squad, and was eventually promoted to the 53-man roster later in 2000. He appeared in eight games in 2000, mostly on special teams. In his second season with the Dolphins, Hendricks switched from weakside linebacker to middle linebacker. He appeared in all 16 games and got his first start at linebacker following another injury to Zach Thomas. He remained with the Dolphins through the 2003 season, appearing in 56 games, three of them as a starter. He was the team's top backup linebacker and a special teams player. He led the team in special teams tackles in 2001 with 30, 2002 with 26 and 2003. He also served as the team's special teams captain for three seasons from 2001 to 2003. Hendricks played for the Jacksonville Jaguars during the 2004 season, appearing in 15 games. He started one game at linebacker for the Jaguars.

A 1948 Model WC. The Model WC was a tractor made by Allis-Chalmers from 1933 to 1948. The WC was designed from its start as a nimble, low-cost, but well-powered row-crop tractor that would make the best use of pneumatic rubber tires, which Allis-Chalmers had just introduced to agriculture in 1932.., pp. 37‚Äì39. A successful model at the historical height of row-crop tractor demand, the WC was the best-selling tractor model that Allis-Chalmers ever built. The WC was the Model W variant tailored to cultivating, thus the W + C (for \\"cultivating\\") name. Other W variants, such as the WD and WF, followed later (in lower numbers). The WC was popular in the Great Depression for its good value, affordable price, and frugal design elements. Two factors that lowered its cost of manufacture, and thus its sales price, were that it was made partially from off-the-shelf components, and that its steel channel iron frame eliminated the need for large, heavy castings for the transmission and rear end (as were often used in tractors of the era). Its power was ample for the time and class, allowing it to pull a two-bottom plow. Production and pricing With its minimalist design and low price, about 178,000 WCs were made from 1934 to 1948. The WC was assembled at the West Allis, Wisconsin, plant, near Milwaukee. In 1934, the WC was listed at USD $825 on rubber (standard), $675 on steel (optional). By 1936, the prices were $960 and $785, respectively.. The tractor could also be ordered as \\"air front\\", meaning rubber tires in front and steel wheels in back. Features and configurations=Engine The WC had a 201-cubic-inch, inline-four engine. Like most tractors of the era, the WC offered multifuel capability, running on gasoline, kerosene, or alcohol, and featured a small auxiliary fuel tank in addition to the larger main fuel tank, so that the tractor could be started on gasoline when cold and, once warmed up, switched to kerosene or alcohol. The engine's 4\\" bore and 4\\" stroke made it one of the first tractor engines (to Buescher's knowledge, the first.) to be square or oversquare, that is, to have an equal or shorter stroke than bore. The WC engine tested at 22 horsepower at the drawbar and 30 at the belt. Its \\"snappy governor [‚Ä¶] seemed to sense a heavy load, even before the load arrived.\\" Ignition was by magneto. Rubber tires The WC was the first farm tractor to have rubber tires as standard equipment, and the first tractor tested on rubber in the Nebraska tractor tests. The pneumatic-rubber-tire-on-steel-wheel combination was more expensive to make than a steel wheel with cleats. To make rubber tires standard equipment while also keeping the cost of the tractor low, the WC's designers, C.E. Frudden and Walter Strehlow, gave the WC drop gearing at the rear (bull- gear-with-pinion final drives), which allowed row-crop ground clearance while having smaller-diameter drive wheels. Drop gearing had appeared many times before on earlier tractors, but never yet for this new reason‚Äîto minimize the amount of rubber needed for the tires. Front axle options Like other row-crop tractors from various makers, the WC could be ordered in both tricycle (narrow tread) and wide tread (that is, wide front track) versions, with the tricycle configuration by far the most popular. The tractor could be ordered as \\"air front\\", meaning rubber tires in front and steel wheels in back. Electric starter and lights In 1939 Harry Merritt, an Allis- Chalmers executive, decided that, with over 90 percent of WCs selling with the optional electric starter and lights, these features would henceforth be standard equipment. Thus the WC became one of the earliest farm tractors (to Buescher's knowledge, the first.) to have starter and lights as standard equipment. Other options A belt pulley was standard equipment on the WC, while a power take-off (PTO) and a mechanical power lift for the cultivator were optional. In 1936 the PTO option's list price was USD $50, the power lift option's, $35. The PTO was necessary if the buyer was planning to use the WC to pull the Allis-Chalmers All-Crop Harvester, a pull-type combine. The combination of a WC tractor pulling an All-Crop Harvester combine was a huge commercial success for Allis from the mid-1930s through mid-1940s. Design changes Various design changes occurred over the model's lifespan: * The prototypes were built with Waukesha engines. Mass production began with the WC's own in-house 4\\"x4\\" engine design. * As in the rest of the farm tractor industry, the mid through late 1930s was the time when Allis-Chalmers's tractors went from \\"unstyled\\" to \\"styled\\". The major manufacturers hired industrial designers (in Allis's case, Brooks Stevens) to style their tractors with streamlined sheet metal (and in some cases revised operator controls with better usability). In 1938, the WC was styled and was given a larger radiator and tires. * In 1939, electric starter and lights went from optional to standard. Drawbacks The WC, with many good features and various first-to- market attributes, had at least a few drawbacks. Its clutch was not particularly well designed,. and, like other tractors of the 1920s through mid-1930s, it lacked usability in the design of its brake controls, with a hand lever on each side of the tractor, which meant that applying the brakes took the operator's hands away from other controls. Other tractors had foot pedals on both sides, but that meant that the clutch and left brake could not be operated simultaneously. The solution came in the late 30s, when various brands moved both brake pedals to the right foot.

Early life and family Oxspring was born in Hampstead, London on 22 May 1919. His father, also named Robert, had served in No. 54 Squadron RFC, and was a founder member and commander of No. 66 Squadron RFC during the First World War, in which he was credited with several aerial victories, and was twice awarded the Military Cross before being wounded in action during a mid-air collision on 30 April 1917. Military career Oxspring in May 1942 standing in front of his personal aircraft when with 91 Squadron at RAF Hawkinge Oxspring was granted a short service commission as an acting pilot officer on 7 May 1938, being described at the time as \\"a tallish, good-looking, fair- headed bloke\\", and served in No. 66 Squadron RAF. He was regraded to pilot officer on 7 March 1939. Flying throughout the Battle of Britain, Oxspring was promoted to flying officer on 3 September 1940, and on 25 October was shot down in Spitfire X4170 near Capel, Kent. Known as one of the battle's great aces, he was one of the fraction of The Few selected by Fighter Command to have a portrait drawn by Cuthbert Orde, sitting for it on 9 December 1940. On 8 November 1940 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). The citation read: Promoted to flight lieutenant (war substantive) on 3 September 1941, he became flight commander in No. 41 Squadron RAF, and went on to command No. 91 Squadron RAF at RAF Hawkinge, No. 222 Squadron RAF and No. 24 Wing. He was awarded a Bar to his DFC on 18 September 1942, with the citation: Moving to Mediterranean combat, it is thought probable that Oxspring was the pilot who shot down renowned German ace Anton Hafner of JG 51 on 2 January 1943. Having led his squadron to be the highest scoring in the North African theatre, and survived his second shooting down of the war, Oxspring was awarded a second Bar to his DFC in February 1943, with the citation reading: On 1 January 1944 he was promoted to temporary squadron leader, and was promoted to squadron leader (war substantive) on 15 June 1944. the rank he held when the conflict ceased in 1945. During the war he had registered 13 solo kills with 2 shared, 2 probable kills and 4 solo V-1 flying bombs destroyed and 1 shared. After the war, on 10 January 1947, he was one of the British officers given royal recognition of the award of the Dutch Airman's Cross. He was also awarded the 1939‚Äì1945 Star with Battle of Britain clasp, the Air Crew Europe Star with France and Germany clasp, the Italy Star, and the War Medal 1939‚Äì1945. He stayed on in the RAF, receiving a permanent commission as a flight lieutenant on 1 September 1945, and being promoted to substantive squadron leader on 1 August 1947. He was awarded the Air Force Cross on 1 January 1949, after leading No. 54 Squadron RAF Vampires to Canada and the US, the first jet aircraft to cross the Atlantic. On 22 September 1949 he led a flight of five Vampire Mk.3 aircraft from 73 Squadron RAF on a tour of Italy to promote the aircraft to the Italian Air force. Flying VF345 Oxspring with a broken radio was unable to find the airfield at Malpensa. Almost out of fuel he chose to land in a field with the other four Vampires also out of fuel following him.

The word Wesleyan in the title differentiated it from the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists (who were a majority of the Methodists in Wales) and from the Primitive Methodist movement, which separated from the Wesleyans in 1807.Molland, E. (1959) Christendom. London: A. R. Mowbray; pp. 267-70 The Wesleyan Methodist Church followed the Wesleys in holding to an Arminian theology, in contrast to the Calvinism held by George Whitefield, by Selina Hastings (founder of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion) and by Howell Harris and Daniel Rowland, the pioneers of Welsh Methodism. Its Conference was also the legal successor to John Wesley as holder of the property of the original Methodist societies.Davies, R. E. (1985) Methodism, 2nd ed. Peterborough: Epworth Press. ; p. 109. History The denomination was originally called the \\"Wesleyan Methodist Connexion\\". The 1891 conference endorsed the use of the term Church rather than Connexion, although it retained a Connexional polity. The name \\"Wesleyan Methodist Church\\" remained in use until the Methodist Union of 1932, when the church re-united with the Primitive Methodist Church and the United Methodist Church to form the current Methodist Church of Great Britain. Westminster Central Hall In 1898, Robert Perks, MP for Louth, proposed the creation of the Wesleyan Methodist Twentieth Century Fund (also known as the 'One Million Guinea Fund') which aimed to raise one million guineas (¬£1.1s. or ¬£1.05) from one million Methodists to build a Central London church to build a world centre of Wesleyan Methodism and to expand the mission of the Wesleyan Church at home and overseas.History - Methodist Central Hall, accessed 6 November 2016 On 8 November, 1898, the fund was officially launched at Wesley's Chapel in City Road, London. The fund had raised ¬£1,073,682 by the time it closed in 1909, part of which was used to purchase the former Royal Aquarium site for the construction of the Methodist Central Hall, Westminster and to support construction and extension of other Wesleyan Methodist churches and Sunday schools around the UK and overseas.The Wesleyan Methodist Twentieth Century Fund, from The Barwicker No. 74, June 2004, accessed 6 November 2016 Schools and education John Wesley was convinced of the importance of education and, following the advice of his friend Dr. Philip Doddridge, opened schools at The Foundery in London, and at Newcastle and Kingswood. Following the upsurge in interest in education which accompanied the extension of franchise in 1832, the Methodist Conference commissioned William Atherton, Richard Treffry and Samuel Jackson to report on Methodist schools, coming to the conclusion that if the Church were to prosper the system of Sunday schools (3,339 in number at that time, with 59,277 teachers and 341,442 pupils) should be augmented by day-schools with teachers educated to high school level. The Rev. John Scott John Scott (1792‚Äì1868) was grandfather of John Scott Lidgett proposed in 1843 that 700 new Methodist day-schools be established within seven years. Though a steady increase was achieved, that ambitious target could not be reached, in part limited by the number of suitably qualified teachers, mostly coming from the institution founded in Glasgow by David Stow. The outcome of the Wesleyan Education Report for 1844 was that planning began for permanent Wesleyan teacher-training college, resulting in the foundation of Westminster Training College in Horseferry Road, Westminster in 1851, with the Rev. Scott as its first Principal.F. C.

Several variants have been developed to power unmanned air vehicles such as missiles and target drones. Developed in the 1970s for the Harpoon anti-ship missile, the J402 was the first jet engine to be designed as a \\"wooden round\\", meaning that the engine had to be able to sit for long periods without maintenance or inspection and work right away.Leyes and Fleming, pg. 106-7 Development and design The J402 engine was designed for the Harpoon missile from the beginning. Its size and weight were dictated by the already-planned missile (just over 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter, about 100 lb (45 kg) in weight). The engine also had to be designed to be inexpensive; the military wanted to produce and store large quantities of the missile. To meet these requirements, Teledyne aerodynamically scaled their J69-T-406 turbojet to just 32% air capacity. This brought thrust and size down to the desired levels.Leyes and Fleming, pg. 107 The J402-CA-400, the original Harpoon variant, was qualified in 1974 and proved to be extremely reliable, failing only twice in 131 flights through mid 1980. The J402-powered Harpoon had an excellent service record, including sinking two Libyan warships during the 1986 Gulf of Sidra incident. Through 1988, the oldest J402 engine fired in a Harpoon was over eleven years old, exceeding the original five year \\"wooden round\\" requirement. The J402-CA-400 was a single-shaft engine, with one axial compressor stage and one centrifugal compressor stage. The compressed air was combusted in an annular combustor, and then passed through a single high-pressure turbine stage before being exhausted. Because the engine was designed for a one-time use missile, its service life was only one hour. The primary challenge of the \\"wooden round\\" requirement was to design the engine to be as reliable as possible. To that end, significant efforts were made to reduce the number of individual parts throughout the engine. For example, the rotor system of the J402 had 16 parts, while the J69 (the parent engine) had 149 parts for the same system. Another simplifying measure was to eliminate the standard gearbox. All the engine accessories, like the fuel pump and electrical alternator, ran directly off the rotor shaft. Engine starting was another reliability-critical function of the engine, and to accomplish that requirement, the J402 utilizes pyrotechnic cartridges to start the engine. Finally, the engine was among the first to feature a fully electronic analog fuel controller.Leyes and Flemming, pg. 108-10 Soon after development of the -400 variant for the Harpoon began, Teledyne began work on a new variant, the J402-CA-700 for the new MQM-107 Streaker aerial target drone. These target drones were not \\"one-time-use\\" vehicles like the Harpoon missiles were, so the lifetime of the engine had to be extended from one hour to 15 hours. To accomplish this, the turbine temperature was reduced, as well as the rotational speeds. A new starter system was included to give the engine the ability to restart. The result was an engine that was slightly less powerful, at 640 lbf (2.8 kN) versus the -400's 660 lbf (2.9 kN), but had the required service life.Leyes and Fleming, pg. 111-2 An additional variant, the J402-CA-702, was developed internally by the company. This variant added an additional axial compressor stage (bringing the total to two axial stages), which increased the engine length by only 4 in (10 cm), yet increased the thrust to 970 lbf (4.3 kN). The engine was later selected to power the MQM-107D, an improved version of the target drone.Leyes and Fleming, pg. 112 The addition of additional compressor stage increased the pressure ratio and overall airflow through the engine, and necessitated the development of a new turbine section. Teledyne designed and tested the new two stage axial compressor early in the J402's life (mid 1970s), but did not work on the new turbine (and subsequently the -702 variant of the engine) until nearly a decade later in the mid-1980s. The resulting engine was 45% more power than the -400/-700 variants, yet also had a 24% lower thrust specific fuel consumption (SFC).Razinsky, E. (1998). The J402-CA-702 - A Modern 1000 Lb.

AIAA-88-3248 The most recent variant of the J402 is the J402-CA-100, developed for the AGM-158 JASSM cruise missile. This derivative, like the -700, is based on the original -400 variant. The primary changes are an aerodynamically refined axial compressor and turbine section, resulting in a more fuel efficient engine at the same thrust levels as the -400.Teledyne JASSM win revives Tomahawk hopes.

Hutto, who introduced them to his student Dave Weld. Together with Dave Weld, (rhythm guitar and vocals) formed the first version of the Blues Imperials. Since 1989, the band's lineup has been Williams (lead guitar and vocals), Michael Garrett (rhythm guitar and vocals), James Young (bass) and Kelly Littleton (drums).

Producer and label owner Bruce Iglauer encouraged them to record additional material, and they cut a full album's worth of material at that session, released as Roughhousin' (1986). They then appeared at music festivals and toured widely. Their second album, Chicken, Gravy & Biscuits, was released in 1989, and their third, What You See Is What You Get, in 1992. At this point the group disbanded. Williams issued two solo albums, Keep On Walking, on which he was joined by Dave Weld, a former member of the Blues Imperials, and Who's Been Talking (1998), pairing Williams with Willie Kent. In 1999 the release of Get Wild marked the group's reunion. It was followed by Heads Up (2002), Rattleshake (2006), Full Tilt (2008) and Jump Start (2012). Lil' Ed and the Blues Imperials have appeared multiple times at the Chicago Blues Festival and festivals and clubs around the world.

As a Rotex Scholar in Arvada West, Colorado, he was trained by David Helm in drama and by Rex Nelson in music. Upon his return to Manila, he was hired by advertising company Dentsu to join its copy department and within three months, he was promoted to copy chief at the age of eighteen. After two years he moved to working in theatre. He was mentored in voice by his uncle, the baritone Aurelio Santos Estanislao, who at that time headed the Voice Department at the College of Music, University of the Philippines. Santos joined Repertory PhilippinesValle, Jet (1996) \\"The Audacious Freddie Santos\\", Manila Standard, March 2, 1996, p. 31B, retrieved 2011-06-27 as well as Teatro Pilipino, Musical Theater Philippines, and SRO Philippines. At 20, he was awarded Most Outstanding Youth in Theatre. He was professionally involved, either as actor, coach, assistant director or director in more than a hundred stage plays and musicales. After five years with Repertory Philippines where he was also active in the research and publicity committees, he eventually moved to SRO Philippines where the focus was on dinner theater and where he found the freedom to further develop his other skills. Here, Santos wrote an original play adapted from the book Paper Moon and headlined by a very young Lea Salonga during its premiere run. He also nurtured his skill in stage lighting, make-up and choreography. A major highlight of his theater career came in the early 80's where he toured the musical Walang Sugat (No Wound) through 10 cities in America as Technical Director, honing his craft as he worked the technical controls of places like the San Francisco Opera House, the Chicago Civic Opera House, and Avery Fisher Hall at the Lincoln Center, among others.

It was then he was asked to direct a lounge show by jazz queen Jacqui Magno and its impact on his life encouraged him to abandon his performing career to fast become one of the country's top concert directors with a distinctive crossover directorial style that combines theater with pop and cutting-edge technology. To date, he has written, designed and/or directed more than 400 pop, rock and roll, and classical concerts totaling over 1,500 performances, working with artists such as Lea Salonga, Monique Wilson, Regine Velasquez, Joey Albert, Gary Valenciano, Jamie Rivera,\\"Jamie Sings\\", Manila Standard, June 15, 1989, p. 27, retrieved 2011-06-27 Janno Gibbs, Ogie Alcasid, The Dawn, NeoColours, Introvoys, Raymond Lauchengco, Rico J.

He has directed over two dozen reunion homecomings of the country's most prestigious schools like La Salle, St. Scholastica's, Assumption, and St. Therese's College, Manila. He has done quite a number of spoken word recordings, several of which serve as vocal guide for the permanent exhibits of the Ayala Museum in Makati, and the Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite. His recordings were aired as well in several countries on European Radio. Several of his sessions were aired on national television in two high-rating weekly musical shows and in a well-received podcast‚Äîone of the first Filipinos to air one. He was regularly viewed on GMA-7 as one of the judges in the high-rating Starstruck and Celebrity Duets. In television, Santos directed 'Yan Ang Bata (Ch7, Catholic Mass Media Awards Winner), Musikatbp.

His latest achievement in video is the 10-part documentary on the life and works of International Spanish artist, Philippine Presidential Order of Merit Recipient, and Cross of Isabella Awardee -- Juvenal Sanso. Since the 1990s, he has also been a board member of House of Refuge, a shelter devoted to looking after abused and abandoned streetchildren. In exploring new techniques and formats, Santos wrote Sabel:Love and Passion which combined poetry/ballet/pop singing/telenovela into a 1 ¬Ω-hour spectacle. Inspired by the Sabel paintings of National Artist Ben Cabrera, and given impetus by BBC broadcaster Rico Hizon, the show, with music composed by Louie Ocampo, won a Stage Crossover Award for its leading lady, Iza Calzado, from Broadway World Philippines, and a nomination for Best New Concept from the Aliw Awards. Because he is a Hall of Famer, Santos himself can no longer be nominated at future Aliw Awards. But for several straight years, he served as director of the annual anniversary staging of the Aliw Awards, headlining its Hall of Famers. Over the decades, unsurprisingly, Santos was part of the formation of several crucial coalitions, among them, the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-Aawit (Organization of Philippine Singers), Philstage (composed of various professional theater and dance companies), and Trumpets, Asia's first fully-professional gospel theatre group. In 2018, he shifted once more in his career path and joined Manila Hotel, one of Asia's oldest and most prestigious hotels, to become its Events Consultant primarily handling entertainment. In line with this, he took charge of Manila Hotel's CSR campaign involving the clean-up of Manila Bay, and for which Santos directed nearly 3 dozen short videos in 2019 featuring local art and showbiz personalities. With National Artist Ryan Cayabyab writing the music, Santos penned the lyrics of the theme song of the campaign: Manila Bay, Atin 'to! (This is ours!). In the same year, Santos wrote three dozen poems which he produced into a video book with the help of Strong Media Corporation of Enar and Sisa Karlsson. Entitled Random:Unsung, the poems were done in spoken word by Santos, Isabella Gonzales, and Jamie Wilson. In the mid-2010s, he was granted his own star in the Eastwood Walk of Fame, and in 2020, he was unanimously voted to be given the Natatanging Buhay (Distinguished Life) Award by Philstage.

When a potentially interesting book in the book scout's market is published, he or she will make his or her clients in the other market aware of this literary property. There is no conflict of interest for the book scout in representing multiple publishers, so long as there is no overlap in the type of book being scouted. For instance, a book scout cannot represent two or more romance novel publishers, but is free to represent a business publisher and a science publisher for the same particular market.

Both species have a long, horizontal, underground rhizome with a single leaf on the flowering stem and a single resupinate flower with its dorsal sepal forming a hood over the labellum and column. Description Orchids in the genus Adenochilus are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with a long, thin, horizontal underground rhizome and a single leaf either on a long stalk or attached to the flowering stem. When present, there is a single resupinate flower on the end of the flowering stem. The dorsal sepal is free and forms a hood over the labellum and column. The lateral sepals and petals are free from each other, longer and narrower than the dorsal sepal, and spread widely apart. The labellum is also free, attached at the base of the column by a short stalk or \\"claw\\". The labellum is curved and has a narrow central band of yellow calli. Taxonomy and naming The genus Adenochilus was first formally described in 1853 by Joseph Dalton Hooker and the description was published in Flora Novae-Zelandiae. Hooker described A. gracilis in the same publication, making it the type species. The name Adenochilus is derived from the Ancient Greek words aden meaning \\"gland\\" and cheilos meaning \\"lip\\", referring to the labellum calli of these two species. Distribution and habitat Adenochilus gracilis Hook.f. is widespread in New Zealand where it often grows in deep leaf litter under beech trees and sometimes near wetlands. It is found on both the North and South Islands and on Stewart and Chatham Islands. Adenochilus nortonii Fitzg. has a restricted distribution in New South Wales, growing at altitudes of in the Blue Mountains, Barrington Tops and Point Lookout areas, often growing under Antarctic beech trees.

The flowers are pollinated by male thynnid wasps which attempt to mate with the flower and are held in place by hooks while the pollinium is transferred between insect and flower. Description Orchids in the genus Arthrochilus are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs usually with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and a single oval-shaped tuber lacking a protective fibrous sheath. (A. huntianus lacks a true tuber.) Some species form colonies, reproducing asexually from daughter tubers formed on the end of root-like stolons. The stem is short, erect and unbranched with thin, leaf-like cataphylls at each node. There are up to six leaves at or near the base of the plant, sometimes forming a rosette around the stem.Labelled image The inflorescence is a raceme with a few to many non-resupinate, dull- coloured flowers on a wiry stalk. The dorsal sepal is similar to or larger than the lateral sepals and its sides curve inwards. The lateral sepals and petals are attached the base of the column, the petals similar to, but smaller than the sepals. The highly modified labellum is dominated by the callus and is hinged to the column by a flexible \\"claw\\". The callus is ornamented with feathery cilia and club-shaped structures which gives the labellum the form of a wingless, female wasp. The column has two pairs of wings, two which surround the sexual parts of the flower and two larger hook-like wings either side of the column. Elbow orchids mainly flower in summer and the fruit that follows flowering is a glabrous dehiscent capsule containing a large number of winged seeds. Taxonomy and naming The genus Arthrochilus was first formally described in 1858 by Ferdinand von Mueller and the description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. Mueller described Arthrochilus irritabilis at the same time and it is regarded as the type species. The scientific name of the genus is derived from the Ancient Greek words arthron meaning \\"joint\\" and cheilos meaning \\"lip\\" referring to the jointed labellum. Distribution and habitat Elbow orchids are found in all states of Australia except Western Australia and in southern Papua New Guinea and on the Torres Strait Islands. The majority of elbow orchid species occur in tropical regions but A. huntianus grows in eastern Australia with the subspecies nothofagicola occurring in Tasmania. The tropical species grow and flower in the summer wet season, usually growing in sand in forest or woodland. Ecology The labellum of elbow orchids mimics wingless female thynnid wasps of the Superfamily Vespoidea, Family Thynnidae. In its attempt to fly off with the dummy female, the insect is thrust head-first against the column where the hooked wings hold the insect in place long enough for the pollinia to stick to its back. If it is carrying pollinia from another flower, the pollinia are crushed against the stigma. For three species of elbow orchid, a single species of wasp from the genus Arthrothynnus has been identified. In the case of some tropical species, the wasps struggle so violently with the labellum that the organ is often torn off.

Beard orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single leaf at the base of the plant, or no leaves. Their most striking feature is a densely hairy labellum, giving rise to their common name. Beard orchids, unlike some other Australian orchids, do not reproduce using daughter tubers, but self-pollinate when cross-pollination has not occurred. Most species occur in Australia but some are found in New Zealand, New Guinea and New Caledonia.  Description  Orchids in the genus Calochilus are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and a pair of egg-shaped tubers lacking a protective fibrous sheath. The tubers produce replacement tubers on the end of a short, root-like stolons. There is either a single, linear, fleshy, convolute leaf, usually channelled, sometimes triangular in cross section, or there is no leaf.labelled image The inflorescence is a raceme with from one to many resupinate flowers. The flowering stem usually has sheathing bracts, which often appear leaf-like. The dorsal sepal is broad, erect, dished and often forms a horizontal hood over the column. The lateral sepals are similar to, but usually narrower than the dorsal sepal. The petals are shorter and narrower than the sepals and often have a hook-like tip. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum. The labellum is longer than all the other parts of the flower, oblong near its base, triangular near the tip and densely covered with purple or metallic-coloured hairs, short near the base of the labellum increasing in length towards its tip. The sexual parts of the flower are fused to the column, which is short and broad with broad wings on its sides. The base of the column forms two rounded collars around the stigma, each often with an eye-like spot. Flowering time depends on the climatic region where the species is found and the fruit that follows flowering is a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing up to 500 seeds. Taxonomy and naming The genus Calochilus was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1810 and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. Brown described two species, C. campestris and C. paludosus, but did not nominate a type species. The name Calochilus is said to be derived from the Latin words calos meaning 'beautiful' and chilus meaning 'lip' referring to the bearded labellum. In classical Latin, pulcher and labium are the words for 'beautiful' and 'lip'.Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. Oxford: Clarendon Press. In ancient Greek, kalos (Œ∫Œ±ŒªœåœÇ) and cheilos (œáŒµ·øñŒªŒøœÇ) are used for 'beautiful' and 'lip'.Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press. Distribution and habitat There are about thirty species of beard orchid. One species is endemic to New Caledonia with the remainder occurring in Australia, although three also occur in New Zealand and one also in New Guinea. Beard orchids are found in all Australian states. In temperate Australia and in New Zealand they grow on slopes and ridges in forest, woodland, shrubland, heath and wet swamps; in tropical Australia and New Guinea in wet, grassy areas. The New Caledonian species, Calochilus neocalidonium grows in maquis shrubland on rocky soils. Ecology In tropical regions, Calochilus species complete their life cycle before the start of the dry season but in more temperate areas they grow in autumn and winter and when the leaves are fully developed they flower in spring and early summer. There have been few studies on the pollination of beard orchids but male Campsomeris wasps have been observed collecting pollinia from some flowers while attempting to copulate with the labellum. In all species, the anther is directly above the stigma, so that if the flower is not cross pollinated, the pollinia fall or crumple onto it.

Abraham also established new congregations in Challakudlur, Ravihal, Lingaladinne and Chickbellary. He seemed to have a good influence among Village Elders and Christians in many villages. E. Herbert Lewis, then Missionary supervised Abraham in his work. In 1945, Abraham was transferred from Hacholli to Adoni to a Kannada-speaking congregation. Two years later, the Church of South India was formed on 27 September 1947. After serving three years in Adoni, Abraham was transferred to Bellary where he served till 1962. In 1953, he proposed to start a Jathara at Chickbellary during holy Easter week for three days under the mangroves of the River Tungabhadra. It was in April 1954 that the Jathara was held. In 1956, Abraham was sent to the Selly Oak Colleges, Birmingham to lecture on Pastoria and Church Ethics for overseas missionaries. He was then assigned a teaching and administrative roles at the Union Kanarese Seminary in Tumkur before being transferred back to Bellary.

Plants in this genus are terrestrial herbs with a caterpillar- like rhizome and a loose rosette of leaves. Small, white, hairy flowers develop as the leaves wither. They are found in tropical Africa, southern Asia, Southeast Asia, Malesia, New Guinea and Australia. Description Orchids in the genus Cheirostylis are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with a creeping, caterpillar-like, above-ground rhizome anchored to the ground by fine white root hairs. The leaves are thinly textured and arranged in a loose rosette with a short petiole but are usually withered by flowering time. The flowers are resupinate and usually small, white and hairy with the dorsal sepal and lateral sepals fused for about half their length. The petals are free from each other but are narrower than the sepals. The tip of the labellum has two lobes and a narrow base forming a shallow depression containing two calli. Taxonomy and naming The genus Cheirostylis was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume and the description was published in Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi√´. The first species of Cheirostylis described by Blume was C. montana, making it the type species. Distribution Cheirostylis orchids occur in tropical Africa through tropical Asia from Japan to New Guinea and some Pacific Islands. Seventeen species, eight of which are endemic occur in China and two species are endemic to Australia.

Mexican Catholics have their own images of the Child Jesus, which is honored and celebrated during the Christmas season, especially on Christmas Eve and on Candlemas (2 February). One tradition unique to Mexico is to dress the image in new clothing each year for presentation at Mass on Candlemas. This dress can vary from representations of the saints, Aztec dress, football/soccer players and more. Also, there are Ni√±o Dios images which are locally famous and honored year-round. History View of the nativity scene in front of the parish church of Santiago Zapotitlan in the Tl√°huac borough of Mexico City. Veneration of the Child Jesus is a European tradition with the best-known examples being the Infant Jesus of Prague and the Santo Ni√±o de Atocha. This tradition was brought by the Spanish to Mexico after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire; In Mexico this veneration has taken on indigenous elements, and is considered to be one of the most deeply rooted Catholic traditions in Mexico. Part of the reason for this was that native Mexicans already had traditions of representing deities in painting or sculpture with rites dedicated to that incarnation, including dramatizations. One of the oldest traditions related to the Child Jesus in Mexico is the ‚Äúpastorela,‚Äù a dramatization based on the birth of Jesus. The ‚ÄúAdoraci√≥n de los Reyes Magos‚Äù (The Adoration of the Magi) was probably the first ‚Äúpastorela‚Äù in Mexico which was organized by Friar Andr√©s de Olmos. It was written in Nahuatl and there were adaptations to indigenous culture in the script as well. The tradition of reenacting scenes from the birth of Christ was recognized by Juan de Zum√°rraga, the first bishop of New Spain who ordered that this practice be widespread for evangelization. Very early on, these reenactments began to vary by local custom and region and were most frequently done by the lower classes. The main theme of these works is the journey of the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem, but demons try to get in their way. In most versions, the demons are vanquished by the Archangel Michael or another angel and the Wise Men arrive to their destination. Characters most often include shepherds, demons, angels and the Wise Men. Other characters sometimes appear such as Mary and Joseph, Indians, ranchers and monks. At the end of the play, all kiss the image of the infant Jesus. Christmas Eve city of Chihuahua. Veneration of the Christ child is strongest during the Christmas season, which officially begins a week or so before Christmas Eve (with posadas) and ends on Candlemas, 2 February. On Christmas Eve, the figure of the Christ child is laid into the Nativity scene in a celebration which is done in the home. This event is called ‚Äúput the child to bed.‚Äù The figure is carried by one or more of the young women while the rest of the family sings lullabies or other children‚Äôs and/or Christmas songs. Each member of the family kisses the image as they sing. The figure is laid in the manger, where it stays until the second of February. This ceremony varies by family and by community. For example, in the community of Dzitnup, in the municipality of Valladolid, the Maya people here have their own variation. In addition to the laying the child in the manger, there is a dance called ‚ÄúAbraham and Isaac.‚Äù This dance includes people who play the two main characters as well as devils. The dance is accompanies by a pre-Hispanic wind instrument called a ‚Äútunkul,‚Äù which is similar to the ‚Äúteponatli‚Äù used in other states such as Guerrero and Puebla. Another Christmas Eve tradition is for children to write letters to the Christ child, typically to ask for things like toys and clothes. Candelaria Ni√±o Dios figure in more traditional christening garb Candlemas (in Spanish, Candelaria), 2 February, marks the end of the Christmas season and nativity scenes generally remain intact in the home until this date. Preparation for Candelaria can begin on 6 January, known as \\"Three Kings Day\\". On this day, a ring-shaped sweet bread called a Rosca de Reyes is shared. Inside the Rosca, is one or more miniature figures of an infant are hidden. Those who find these figures have obligations to meet on Candelaria. These obligations always include being responsible for buying tamales and drinks for this day, but it can also signal a more serious commitment. It can mean that the person selected must purchase an outfit for the family‚Äôs Ni√±o Dios for one, two or three years. The person may also need to buy an outfit for the found miniature infant. Each year, the Ni√±o Dios of the household is brought to Mass on 2 February to be blessed. After the mass, the family returns home to celebrate, typically with tamales, bu√±uelos, atole and hot chocolate. The tradition recalls that forty days after Jesus‚Äôs birth, Mary and Joseph took the child to the Temple to present to the priests. To present the Ni√±o Dios at Mass, tradition states that the image must be dressed in a new outfit. These outfits can vary widely but a number are most popular. For those who observe the three year commitment, the image is dressed in white for the first year, symbolizing purity. This is also the case if the image being presented is new. Other common and traditional outfits include Santo Ni√±o de Atocha with crosier and seated on a chair, ‚ÄúNi√±o de las palomas‚Äù (Child of the doves) in a white robe with a dove between the hands, as San Francisco with sandals and brown robe, holding an animal, or ‚ÄúNi√±o de las azucenas‚Äù (Child of the lilies) with a white tunic and holding a bunch of lilies. The need to buy a new outfit each year has given rise to a market in outfits for the images. Purchase of the outfits generally begins as early as December and continues until 2 February. Outfits range from the very simple made with inexpensive fabrics to elaborate creations in silk. The most common outfits are made with silk, satin, cotton and brocades decorated with silver or gold. Stationery stores generally sell the most traditional of outfits and the more expensive ones. However, these outfits are most commonly bought in traditional open markets called ‚Äútianguis.‚Äù Here, more original ones can be found and can include various saints, pre-Hispanic dress, mariachis, soccer players and ethnic dress of various nationalities. Custom orders are also taken. Some priests frown upon the non-traditional outfits and only want white. Many of the outfits are original and some cause scandal, such as the Ni√±o Dios dressed as a drug trafficker. At the Casa de Cultura Griselda Alvarez in Mexico City, there was an exhibit of twenty four Ni√±os Dios dressed in various ways: as a fisherman, as the Pope, as the Archangel Gabriel, as the Sacred Heart and as the Atocha. The collection is from the La Casa de los Ni√±os Dios Uribe. The images vary and size from very small to very large and in material, mostly being of ceramic or wood. Particular Ni√±o Dios images The Ni√±opa held by a girl during a procession in Xochimilco In addition to the veneration of household Ni√±os Dios during the Christmas season, there are a number of Child Jesus images that have year-round devotion. These Ni√±os Dios often have a special place in the worship by Mexican Catholics, but sometimes they have been the objects of ‚Äúkidnapping‚Äù and disputes. Most of the best- known images are in Mexico City and central Mexico. Offerings to these images are usually toys or candy, a tradition related to offerings made to the dead for the afterlife in pre-Hispanic times. Ni√±o Dios image dressed in Aztec costume One of the earliest of the Ni√±o Dios images in Mexico is the Ni√±o Cautivo which is in the Metropolitan Cathedral. It was sculpted in the 16th century by Juan Martinez Monta√±ez in Spain and purchased by the cathedral. However, on its way to Veracruz, pirates attacked the ship it was on and sacked it. To get the image back, a large ransom was paid. Today, the image is in the Chapel of San Pedro or De las Reliquias. Traditionally, the image has been petitioned by those seeking release from restrictions or traps, especially financial problems or drug addiction or alcoholism. The cult to the Ni√±o Cautivo is considered to be ‚Äúinactive‚Äù by INAH. However, this particular image has made a comeback since 2000 as one to petition when a family member is abducted and held for ransom. Another famous Ni√±o Dios is the Ni√±opa (also written Ni√±o-Paor Ni√±opan) of Xochimilco, which is also from the 16th century. This image originally belonged to an indigenous chief called El Viejo. The name ‚ÄúNi√±o Pa‚Äù is a hybrid of the Spanish word for ‚Äúchild‚Äù (ni√±o) and the Nahuatl word for ‚Äúplace‚Äù (pan) meaning ‚Äúchild of the place.‚Äù It is said that this image goes about at night to visit people in their dreams and to check the crops of the community. Some claim to have found mud on the image‚Äôs shoes in the morning. This image has been housed in one family‚Äôs home or another for over 430 years. The host family who become its ‚Äúgodparents‚Äù or mayodomos for the year. To be a ‚Äúgodparent‚Äù for this image is a great honor in Xochimilco, with the list extending until 2035 with families waiting fifty years. The family prepares a special bedroom in their home to house the child for the year. Those families who have housed the image in past years have replicas of the Ni√±o Pa. Ni√±o de los Milagros or Ni√±o Futbolista in the uniform of the Mexico national team for World Cup 2010 It is claimed that this image made itself invisible when government soldiers came to claim it during the Cristero War. It was presumed that the image was made of orange tree wood because of the writings about it by Mart√≠n Ser√≥n y Alvarado. However, this was proven false in the 1970s, when the image was dropped and a finger broke off. It is made the wood from a tree called ‚Äúchocol√≠n‚Äù in the workshops of Bernardino of Siena in the 16th or 17th century. Ni√±o de las Suertes The Ni√±o de las Suertes has a strong following due to its association with Santa Muerte. While the image was created in the 19th century, its popular veneration is a recent phenomenon. The image was found by two evangelists in the rubble of the Hacienda of San Juan de Dios in Tlalpan. It was handed over to Archbishop Francisco Lizana y Beaumont. As a number of monasteries wanted to claim it, the archbishop decided to make the decision by lottery. It is said that this image favored the Convent of San Bernardo due to the vow of poverty by its nuns. This was confirmed by doing the drawing three times. In the 19th century, due to tensions between the Mexican government and the Church, the image was moved to Tacubaya when the convent was secularized. This image has a skull by the infant's head. This originally symbolized the future Passion, but recently it has made this image associated with Santa Muerte, whose devotees visit. In Tacuba, there is on image called the Ni√±o Futbolista (Child Football/Soccer player) although its real name is \\"Santo Ni√±o de los Milagros.\\" It is considered to be generous in granting miracles and is in a glass case surrounded by toys given by the faithful to favors received. Every four years, when the FIFA World Cup is played, this image is dressed in the uniform of the Mexico national football team, in the hopes that Mexico wins the cup. The Santo Ni√±o Doctor de los Enfermos is at a side altar in the parish of San Francisco de As√≠s en Tepeaca, Puebla. The image is old but devotion to it is relatively recent. The image used to belong to a nun of the Concepci√≥n B√©istegui Hospital in Mexico City. When the nun was transferred to Tepeaca, she brought the image with her and had it with her as she treated the sick. This image has had its own feast day at this church since 1961 on the 30 of April. Other locally famous Ni√±os Dios in Mexico City include the Ni√±o Limosnerito in Colonia Santa Maria la Ribera, the Santo Ni√±o del Verbo Encarnado in Colonia Alfonso XIII, and the Santo Ni√±o Muevo Corazones in Colonia Santa Tom√°s. This last image is credited with the conversion of many people to Catholicism. Outside of Mexico City, there are the Ni√±o Jes√∫s de la Salud in Morelia, the Ni√±o Milagroso de Tlaxcala, the Ni√±o Cieguito (Blind Child) in Puebla (so called because it lacks eyes) and the Santo Ni√±o de Atocha in Fresnillo, the lasat a local version of a Spanish depiction.

Tongue orchids are terrestrial herbs with one to a few stalked leaves at the base of the flowering stem, or leafless. One to a few dull coloured flowers are borne on an erect flowering stem. The most conspicuous part of the flower is the labellum, compared to the much reduced sepals and petals. At least some species are pollinated by wasps when they attempt to mate with the flower. There are about twenty five species found in South Asia, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. Description Orchids in the genus Cryptostylis are terrestrial, perennial herbs with a thick, branching underground rhizome with vertical shoots forming at nodes. The plant has thick, fleshy roots but lacks a tuber. There are one to a few erect leaves, each with a distinct petiole and often purple on the lower surface, although C. hunteriana is saprophytic and leafless. New leaves are produced each year after flowering but each leaf has a life of several years. The inflorescence is a raceme with from one to a few non-resupinate flowers. The sepals and petals (apart from the labellum) are narrow, free from and similar to each other. The most conspicuous part of the flower is the labellum which is attached to the base of the column and closely surrounds it. The fruit is a thin-walled capsule containing a large number of light coloured seeds. Taxonomy and naming Cryptostylis was first formally described in 1810 by the prolific Scottish botanist, Robert Brown and the description was published in his book, Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. Brown described three species in the same publication (C. longifolia, C. ovata and C. erecta) but did not nominate a type species. (Cryptostylis longifolia is an illegitimate name and the species is now known as C. subulata.) The name Cryptostylis is derived from the Ancient Greek words kryptos meaning \\"hidden\\" and stylos meaning \\"pillar\\" or \\"column\\", referring to the column of these orchids which is partly hidden by the labellum. Molecular study of the DNA of tongue orchids shows the genus lies within the tribe Diurideae within the orchid family, having previously been considered part of the Cranichideae. The genera Cryptostylis and Coilochilus (endemic to New Caledonia) make up the subtribe Cryptostylidinae. Distribution and habitat The genus comprises around twenty five species of terrestrial orchid distributed from India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Malaysia through Indonesia to Australia and New Zealand, as well as Samoa, New Caledonia and Vanuatu. Five species are found in Australia, of which three are endemic. Tongue orchids occur from temperate to tropical regions and in well-drained to swampy sites. Cryptostylis arachnites has the widest distribution and grows in rainforest, often in mountainous areas. Ecology All Australian species are pollinated by the ichneumon wasp known as the orchid dupe wasp (Lissopimpla excelsa). The male wasp mistakes the flower parts for a female wasp and attempts to copulate with it. Although the different species can occur together, they appear to inhibit cross-fertilisation and no hybrids are found in nature. This discovery was made by Australian naturalist Edith Coleman in 1928, and the term coined was \\"pseudocopulation\\". The mimicking of flowers to resemble female wasp parts has since been recorded in other orchid genera but only in Cryptostylis has the insect been observed ejecting seminal fluid containing sperm cells. Coleman suggested that the males are more strongly attracted to the orchid flowers than to female wasps of the same species. The flowers of Cryptostylis orchids and female wasp body parts are very similar in colour when viewed under a hymenopteran visual system, despite looking different to human eyes. Although the colours that ichneumon wasps see are unknown, bees and wasps have similar perception with green, blue and ultraviolet wavelengths. The Cryptostylis orchids are unusual in that several species are pollinated by the same wasp species; other orchids which mimic insects are often species- specific. The flowers have no smell detectable to humans, but have been shown to have an odour which attracts the orchid dupe wasp. Furthermore, gas chromatography and electrophysiology show that the single active compound for pollinator attraction is found in different species of Cryptostylis.

The company was established on privatisation of elements of the coal industry of the Czech Republic which started in 1994; in 2004 46% of the business was bought up by Karbon Invest which itself was acquired by RPG Group (owned by Mr Zdenek Bakala, a Czech billionaire), shortly thereafter. In 2005 the coal and coke businesses of that company were restructured as New World Resources B.V. and were the subject of an initial public offering as New World Resources N.V. in 2008. In 2013 NWR sold its coke subsidiary, OKK Koksovny, a.s. In September 2018, Bakala filed a lawsuit in federal court in Beaufort, South Carolina in which he claims that a controversional Slovak businessman Pavol Kr√∫pa has initiated frivolous lawsuits, promoted death threats on Facebook and instigated criminal investigations targeting him. The lawsuit also says that Krupa threatened to send soccer hooligans to protest in front of Bakala‚Äôs home in Switzerland and ultimately demanded a payment of 500 million Czech koruna (USD $23 million) in 2017, as a compensation for losses suffered by buying the New World Resources stock, to stop. According to the complaint, when Bakala rejected that offer, Krupa hired Beverly Hills, California-based Crowds on Demand ‚Äúto bring his campaign of defamation, extortion, and harassment to the U.S.‚Äù Operations The company's main operations comprised OKD (a coal mining business) and NWR KARBONIA (a Polish coal and coke business). It mined in the Silesian part of the Czech Republic in Karvin√° basin and has two development projects in Poland.

Background The Dubai Health Authority (DHA) was formed in 2007 under the directives of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. The program was launched in March 2008. Before the DHA was established, the body overseeing healthcare in the emirate was known as the Department of Health and Medical Services, which was established in 1973. Beyond general oversight of Dubai‚Äôs healthcare sector the DHA provides healthcare services through hospitals and other facilities that fall under its direct jurisdiction. These include Latifa Hospital, Dubai Hospital, Rashid Hospital and Hatta Hospital, in addition to other specialty centres and DHA primary health centres throughout Dubai. Other aspects of the DHA‚Äôs services are: *Creating and ensuring the execution of policies and strategies for healthcare in Dubai‚Äôs public and private healthcare sectors. *Enabling partnerships between healthcare providers. *Licensing and regulating medical professionals and facilities.  Dubai Healthcare Reform  In November 2013, the Dubai Health Authority announced a new law that aimed to make sure that every person in Dubai had their own health insurance. Beyond ensuring that both locals and expats in Dubai would have access to affordable and quality medical care when needed, the law would also attract foreign investment to Dubai‚Äôs healthcare sector and reduce much of the burden that healthcare costs put on the public at large. The law, known as the Insurance System for Advancing Healthcare in Dubai (ISAHD), is to be rolled out in several steps in order to help individuals and businesses adjust and adapt. These phases are as follows: Phase 1 - October 31, 2014: By this date companies with 1,000 or more employees must provide health insurance for all of their employees. Phase 2 ‚Äì July 31, 2015: By this date companies with 100 or more employees must provide health insurance for all of their employees. Phase 3 ‚Äì June 30, 2016: By this date companies with any number of employees must provide health insurance for all of their employees. Additionally, employed individuals will have to have made arrangements to insure any of their dependents, and families will have to arrange to insure any domestic workers in their employ by this date. Under the reform, employers are required to arrange for and bear the cost of their employees‚Äô health insurance, and are not able to merely provide an allowance for the insurance that their employees would then use to find insurance on their own. According to Dr. Al Yousuf, Director of Health Funding at the DHA, companies that fail to adhere to the new law can face penalties including a monthly fine for each employee not covered, or even the non-renewal of trade licenses. While UAE nationals who are Dubai residents will be the responsibility of the Dubai government under the reform, foreign nationals coming to Dubai are required to have arranged for their own health insurance coverage prior to their arrival in the Emirate, and health insurance will be a pre-requisite for obtaining residency or a visit visa. In order to operate selling health insurance in Dubai following the reform, insurers, TPAs, brokers and healthcare providers will all be required to obtain a permit from the DHA on an annual basis. In order to control costs under the reform, the DHA has also established a price list for medical services that healthcare providers must adhere to. As far as the requirements of health insurance products themselves, the DHA has mandated a minimum coverage that must be adhered to by all policies in the Emirate, although coverage that goes above and beyond the minimum is also allowed. Varying minimums have been set forth for UAE nationals, expatriate residents, and visitors. Specific medical services and treatments that are required under all basic health plans include: In-Patient *Tests *Diagnosis *Treatment *Surgery *Emergency treatment Maternity *Out-patient ante-natal *In-patient maternity *Newborn cover Out- Patient *Examination *Diagnostics and treatment by general practitioners *Specialists and consultants *Laboratory testing *Radiology diagnostic services *Physiotherapy *Medicines *Vaccines and immunizations *Diabetes screening *Diagnostics and treatment for dental and gum treatment *Hearing and vision aids *Corrective laser and surgical treatment for vision As a result of the reform, insurers in Dubai will no longer be allowed to deny coverage to individuals due to pre-existing and chronic condition exclusions after the first 6 months of coverage. The maximum annual benefit limit for Basic Health Plans under the reform is AED150,000, excluding co-insurance and deductible payments. Furthermore, co-insurance payments on the part of the insured can be as high as 20%, and a General Practitioner will need to be seen, and a referral given, before the insured may consult with specialists.  Dubai Medical Tourism Club  Chaired by His Excellency Engineer Essa Al Maidoor, Director General of the Dubai Health Authority, the Dubai medical tourism club is an initiative which was established by the DHA to find ways to promote develop and sustain medical tourism in Dubai. Al Maidoor stated ‚ÄúThe idea behind the medical tourism club is to brainstorm and to receive feedback and suggestions from key industry experts so that the Authority and the private sector can work together to ensure we utilize all our resources to promote medical tourism in Dubai.\\" Furthermore, the goals of the medical tourism club include: * Facilitating the Dubai medical tourism program * Promoting medical tourism services in Dubai * To collectively contribute to the Dubai medical tourism strategy by identifying new markets and services Dr Layla Al Marzouqi, director of the DHA health regulation department and director of the Dubai medical tourism initiative, stated the standards to be a member of the Club, saying: ‚ÄúThere is an eligibility criterion for membership. While facility, physician and clinical requirements are essential to ensure quality and capability of health facilities; key hospitality requirements are needed to ensure medical tourists and their family members are comfortable.‚Äù There of the 24 registered members, 15 are from hospitals, two are from day-care surgery centers and seven belong to multi-specialty clinics.

Established in 2000, it was known as Regional Transportation Authority until 2005.http://www.rba-nwi.org/about.html The agency is responsible for improving public transit options in Northwestern Indiana by consolidating and modifying existing services and introducing new ones to fill the gaps. Under the current consolidation plan, RBA will eventually assume responsibility for running all existing bus services in Lake and Porter counties. The details of the plan are still under development as of January 2010. RBA is funded by Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority until December 2011. If it does not come up with an alternative funding source, the agency and the services it operates will be shut down.http://www.post-trib.com/news/lake/2989098,new- transit1206.article All fixed-route services operated by the RBA were shut down on June 30, 2012. Paratransit service was discontinued at the end of July 2012.http://www.rba- nwi.org/paratransit.cfmhttp://posttrib.suntimes.com/news/lake/13496957-418/paratransit- bus-service-available-through-july.html Services operated by RBA In 2008, RBA partnered up with Gary Public Transportation Corporation to operate three express inter-city routes - Route 12:Tri City Connection, Route 17: South Broadway Express and Route 20: U.S. 30/Lincoln Highway Circular. RBA increased service frequency from an hour to half an hour. Route 12 connects Gary to Hammond Transit System's Dan Rabin Transit Center, allowing commuters to transfer to HTS and PACE buses. Route 17 connects Gary to Merrillville's Century Mall. Route 20 acts as a feeder service four Route 17, connecting riders to shopping destinations throughout Merrillville. As of January 2010, RBA assumed responsibility for running Hammond Transit System, which serves the cities of Hammond and Whitting. Originally, the system routes, prices and service frequency remained the same. The only visible indicator of the new ownership were the \\"EasyGo\\" stickers applied over all \\"Hammond Transit System\\" labels on the buses (the bus stop signage still retains the old name). On August 2, 2010, the RBA revamped the system as EasyGo Lake Transit service, expanding its reach to several Lake County suburbs and adding a new express route that links between Munster and the Lake county government offices at Crown Point. On February 1, 2010, RBA introduced a new rush hour express bus service between Dyer and downtown Chicago in a manner similar to Valparaiso's ChicaGo Dash. Known as EasyGo Chicago, it makes two trips from Dyer fire station to the Loop in the mornings and two return trips to Dyer in the evenings. The tickets cost $7.50 each way. So far, the ridership has been modest (an average of 17 riders per day).http://www.nwitimes.com/business/local/article_c6bd5de2-7fed-55d9-83c7-3de1fa8b2513.html It is funded using RBA funds and a stimulus grant for the first two years. It is unclear how it will be funded once the stimulus funds expire.\\"RBA to launch Lake County express bus to Chicago\\" by Keith Benman RBA is currently considering taking over GPTC transit system and potentially tweaking the routes to make them more compatible with Hammond Transit System routes it already controls.

The genus was first formally described in 1963 by the Australian botanist Alex George who published his description in Western Australian Naturalist. Orchids in the genus Elythranthera had previously been included in Glossodia section Elythranthera. Two species were recognised: *Elythranthera brunonis (Endl.)

M.A.Clem In 2015, as a result of studies of molecular phylogenetics, Mark Clements transferred the two Elythranthera species to Caladenia.

He is President of the Herzl Institute in Jerusalem, and serves as the Chairman of the Edmund Burke Foundation. Hazony founded The Shalem Center in Jerusalem in 1994, and was president and then provost until 2012. He designed the curriculum for Shalem College, Israel's first liberal arts college, established in 2013. Hazony's book The Virtue of Nationalism (Basic Books, 2018) was selected as the Conservative Book of the Year for 2019. His Philosophy of Hebrew Scripture (Cambridge, 2012) received the second-place PROSE Award for best book in Theology and Religion from the American Association of Publishers. Early life and education Hazony received his B.A. from Princeton University in East Asian Studies in 1986, and his Ph.D. from Rutgers University in Political Philosophy in 1993. While a junior at Princeton he founded the Princeton Tory, a magazine for moderate and conservative thought. He is the brother of David Hazony and Daniel Hazony. Career Hazony has served as Director of the John Templeton Foundation's project in Jewish Philosophical Theology, and as a member of the Israel Council for Higher Education committee examining general studies programs in Israel's universities and colleges. He is author of a regular weblog on philosophy, politics, Judaism, Israel and higher education called Jerusalem Letters. Hazony has published in outlets including The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and American Affairs. Hazony is an outspoken nationalist and has written that nationalism uniquely provides \\"the collective right of a free people to rule themselves.\\" However, several critics of Hazony's book The Virtue of Nationalism (2018) maintain it is both theoretically inconsistent or incoherent and that it bears little relation to the historical body of nationalist thought.  Religious views  Hazony is a Modern Orthodox Jew and related his views on Open Orthodoxy in an article published in 2014. Hazony stated that he feared that Open Orthodoxy was acting as an ideological echo chamber in which any unapproved views were ridiculed and quashed without debate. Hazony described his concern that elements of Open Orthodoxy had seemingly decided to accept all conclusions of academic Bible critics as indisputable fact, without even going through the motions of investigating whether these conclusions were true.

It has a single leaf and a single flower with three white sepals and two similar petals.  Description  Caladenia saccharata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with a roughly spherical, white, fleshy tuber surrounded in its upper half by a fibrous sheath. Each year a replacement tuber is formed on the end of a short, root-like stolon. There is a single, narrow linear-shaped leaf rising from the base of the plant. The leaf is pale yellowish green on both sides, hairy, long, wide and usually has irregular reddish-purple blotched near the base. There a single resupinate flower on the end of a hairy, wiry stem high. The flower is long and wide on a stalk less than long and has a strong, musky cinnamon scent but does not have any nectar. The two lateral sepals are about the same size and shape as the two petals and are white, long, wide and curve slightly forwards. The dorsal sepal is slightly narrower than the lateral ones and the sides of the top half are curved inwards or \\"pinched\\". The sepals and petals have dark- coloured glandular hairs on their back surface. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum. The labellum is glabrous, divided into three parts, roughly circular when flattened, with the lateral lobes erect cream-coloured with obvious parallel purple lines and irregular purple blotches. The central part has smooth yellow calli in two rows. The sexual parts of the flower are fused to the column which is narrow, curved forwards and has two translucent wings. Flowering occurs from August to September and the fruit which follows is a non-fleshy, glabrous, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia saccharata was first formally described in 1871 by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach and the description was published in Beitrage zur Systematischen Pflanzenkunde. In 2004, Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown described the genus Ericksonella and included this species in the new genus but the change has not been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. The name \\"Ericksonella\\" honours Rica Erickson, botanist, author and artist. The specific epithet (saccharata) is derived from the Latin word saccharum meaning \\"sugar\\". Distribution and habitat Caladenia saccharata grows in a range of soils and habitats including sand and clay loam, in shrubland near salt lakes, woodland and sheoak thickets around granite outcrops. It occurs from near Paynes Find to Israelite Bay and inland as far as Coolgardie and Norseman in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Conservation Sugar orchid (as Ericksonella saccharata) is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Against denominationalism and schism  Yet Luther, at least as late as 1519, argued against denominationalism and schism, and the Augsburg Confession of 1530 can be interpreted (e.g. by McGrath 1998) as conciliatory (others, e.g. Rasmussen and Thomassen 2007, marshalling evidence, argue that Augsburg was not conciliatory but clearly impossible for the Roman Catholic Church to accept ). \\"Luther's early views on the nature of the church reflect his emphasis on the Word of God: the Word of God goes forth conquering, and wherever it conquers and gains true obedience to God is the church\\":  Ecclesia sancta catholica  \\"Now, anywhere you hear or see such a word preached, believed, confessed, and acted upon, do not doubt that the true ecclesia sancta catholica, a 'holy Christian people' must be there....\\" \\"Luther's understanding of the church is thus functional, rather than historical: what legitimates a church or its office-bearers is not historical continuity with the apostolic church, but theological continuity.\\"  Systematic ecclesiology  John Calvin is among those working, primarily after Martin Luther, in the second generation of Reformers, to develop a more systematic doctrine of the church (i.e. ecclesiology) in the face of the emerging reality of a split with the Catholic church, with the failure of the ecumenical Colloquy of Regensburg in 1541, and the Council of Trent's condemnation in 1545 of \\"the leading ideas of Protestantism\\". Thus, Calvin's ecclesiology is progressively more systematic.  Emphasis on predication  The second edition of Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1539 holds that \\"the marks of the true church [are] that the Word of God should be preached, and that the sacraments be rightly administered\\". Later, Calvin developed the theory of the fourfold office of pastor, doctor (or teacher), elder, and deacon, possibly owing to the colleagueship with Martin Bucer and his own experience of leadership in church communities.  Visible and invisible church  Calvin also discusses the visible church and the invisible church; the visible church is the community of Christian believers; the invisible church is the fellowship of saints and the company of the elect; both must be honoured; \\"there is only one church, a single entity with Jesus Christ as its head\\" (McGrath); the visible church will include the good and the evil, a teaching found in the patristic tradition of Augustine and rooted in the divine teaching, recorded in the Gospel according to Matthew, of the Parable of the Tares(Mt 13:24-31); thus, Calvin held that it is \\"not the quality of its members, but the presence of the authorised means of grace, [that] constitutes a true church\\" (McGrath).  Concerns about fragmentation  Calvin was concerned to avoid further fragmentation, i.e. splits among the Evangelical churches: \\"I am saying that we should not desert a church on account of some minor disagreement, if it upholds sound doctrine over the essentials of piety, and maintains the use of the sacraments established by the Lord.\\"Calvin, John. Institutes, IV.i.9-10. In, Joannis Calvini: Opera Selecta. Vol. 5. Ed., P. Barth and W. Niesel. Munich: Kaiser Verlag, 1936. 13.24-16.31. Citation and information from McGrath. op.cit., pp. 205-7.  Radical Reformation ecclesiology  There is no single \\"Radical Reformation Ecclesiology\\". A variety of views is expressed among the various \\"Radical Reformation\\" participants. A key \\"Radical Reformer\\" was Menno Simons, known as an \\"Anabaptist\\". He wrote: This was in direct contrast to the hierarchical, sacramental ecclesiology that characterized the incumbent Roman Catholic tradition as well as the new Lutheran and other prominent Protestant movements of the Reformation. Some other Radical Reformation ecclesiology holds that \\"the true church [is] in heaven, and no institution of any kind on earth merit[s] the name 'church of God.'\\" A more conservative analysis of ecclesiology was given in the mid-20th century by the Methodist Robert Newton Flew.

In India in the 1860s he witnessed the severe consequences of the disease and vowed to make caring for those with leprosy his life work.An Inn Called Welcome, A Donald Miller, The Mission to Lepers, 1965 p9-10 The Mission he established all those years ago is still active today. Early life Wellesley Bailey was born in Ireland in 1846.An Inn Called Welcome, A D Miller, The Mission to Lepers, 1965, p9 He grew up in Abbeyleix, Queens County where his father was an estate manager for the Cosby family. The Baileys earned enough to send Wellesley and his three brothers to boarding school at Kilkenny College.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p19 Ireland in the 1840s and '50s was a tough environment to grow up in ‚Äì the country was immersed in the Great Famine. Over one million people emigrated from Ireland during the late 1840s. North America and the colonies were the favoured destinations of those who could afford to leave. It is not surprising then that Wellesley himself dreamed of finding a new, more promising life, in distant lands.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p20 In 1866 he set out to find his fortune in the goldfields of Australia. Three years later he returned to Dublin, his ambitions unfulfilled. But it wasn't long before he was setting sail again. One of his brothers was serving in the police force in India and invited Wellesley to join him. Always on the look out for a challenge, Wellesley departed for Faizabad, North East India, in 1869. Wellesley Bailey's Christian faith Although Wellesley Bailey had gone to a Church of Ireland church as a child, he'd never particularly taken the Christian faith seriously. That was until he found himself at the start of a voyage that was to take him a long way from home. In Gravesend, fog delayed the departure of his ship bound for Australia. Remembering his childhood girlfriend's request to him before he left to attend church whenever he could, he stopped by one Sunday at Gravesend Parish church. There, he says he had a sense of God's presence in a way he'd never known before and he committed his life to Christ. First visit to India When Wellesley reached India in 1869, his brother had been moved to the north west of the country and he found himself alone in a strange land.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p21 He put aside his original intention to join the police and instead focused his energies on learning Hindi. He lodged with an old German Lutheran missionary who was able to teach him the local language. At this time he began to feel that God was calling him to missionary work. So he applied to work with the American Presbyterian Mission. They accepted him and sent him as a teacher to one of their schools in Ambala in the Punjab in north India. The leader of the American Mission in Ambala was Dr JH Morrison. Wellesley began to hear from his colleagues about how Dr Morrison looked after some 'beggars who were lepers'. Wellesley had no idea what this meant.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p22 He had only heard about leprosy and 'lepers' from Bible stories. One day Dr Morrison invited him to visit the beggars' huts with him. Wellesley was quite shocked by what he saw. Many of them had clawed hands, some were blind, some had disfigured faces. Afterwards, Bailey wrote: 'I almost shuddered, yet I was at the same time fascinated, and I felt that if there was ever a Christlike work in the world it was to go amongst these poor sufferers and bring them the consolation of the gospel.'Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p22-23 All the while Bailey had been in India, he had been corresponding with the childhood girlfriend, Alice Grahame, who'd encouraged him to go to church. Wellesley proposed in one letter and they became engaged.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p24-25 In 1870 Alice sailed to India and that year they were married in Bombay Cathedral.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p25 The dry heat of the Punjab had a bad effect on Alice's health. Two years after she arrived it was clear that she would be not be able to maintain a good quality of life in India, and so Wellesley resigned from the American Mission and together they returned to Ireland.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p26 The 'Mission to Lepers' is born Having to return to Ireland was a deep disappointment for Wellesley.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 26 But it provided him with plenty of opportunities to talk to people about the problems faced by those with leprosy in India. In 1874 friends of Wellesley and Alice, the Pim sisters, invited them to stay with them in Dublin.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 26 The sisters then invited some of their friends over and asked Wellesley to describe his work with leprosy-affected people. The stories that Wellesley told captured the imagination; very little had ever been communicated before to people in the West about leprosy. A larger venue than the Pims' sisters living room was found and Wellesley talked about his work to a wider audience.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 26-27 He explained to people about some of the financial needs: 'For as little as ¬£5 an adult leper can be cared for in an asylum, and a child for much less than that.' Wellesley's talks were also produced in booklet form, entitled Lepers in India.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 27 It soon sold out and had to be reprinted. The Pim sisters hesitantly agreed to try and raise ¬£30 a year for leprosy work in India.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 27 Alice's health had significantly improved and they were able to return to India in 1875.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p31 Wellesley had been appointed a lay- missionary with the Church of Scotland.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 31 Initially, he was preaching and then in his spare time doing whatever he could for leprosy sufferers, using some of the funds sent over to India by the Pim sisters to build shelters. His divided loyalties caused tension between Bailey and the Scottish Mission who wanted him to focus more on his teaching and preaching work.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 34 In 1878 he was given permission to take a month's leave and he returned to Ireland. Once Wellesley was back in his home country The Mission to Lepers became properly formalised.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 35 Bailey reported that they were caring for about 100 leprosy-affected people, mostly in north India.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 35 Charlotte Pim informed the new committee that they were raising about ¬£900 a year. Wellesley Bailey was appointed the first secretary and treasurer to work from India. The Baileys and their three children went back to India in 1879.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p35 At this stage, Wellesley was still trying to combine his work for the Church of Scotland Mission with his unpaid work as secretary for the Mission to Lepers. Alice's health again became fragile. In 1882, the Scottish Mission board ordered them home and took Wellesley off their missionary lists. Later that year the Baileys moved to Edinburgh where Wellesley took up position as secretary of a charity that worked with women in India. Still he continued his work with the Mission to Lepers. As the income continued to increase, it became possible to extend the work further. In 1886, Wellesley Bailey gave up his post with the Scottish charity and was appointed full-time secretary of The Mission to Lepers in India.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 36 That same year, Wellesley and Alice set off for a tour of India to see for themselves the vast needs of those with leprosy throughout the whole country.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p 36 They did not return until the spring of 1887. The growth of the Mission Wellesley's tour of India had highlighted to him how great the need for The Mission to Lepers work was.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p40 He had witnessed other missionaries' attempts to care for those with leprosy, often without the support of their Mission organisation. When he visited projects, Bailey was seen as the expert and also a source of financial support. Where possible, he provided the funds necessary to keep the asylums or shelters going. Steadily, income to the Mission to Lepers grew. Three 'auxiliaries', or fundraising bases, sprung up in England ‚Äì in Brighton, Cheltenham and Bolton.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p42 Wellesley and Alice returned to Scotland in 1887 and Wellesley began to concentrate on growing the Mission. Letters were arriving from different centres in India asking for support for leprosy work.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p43 Up until this point, Wellesley had focused solely on India. But then came a letter from Mandalay in Burma asking for help. The Mission to Lepers responded by providing funds for the building of a home for those with leprosy. By 1891, China was added to the list of countries that The Mission to Lepers was working in.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p44 In the last decade of the century the Baileys were travelling East and West.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p46 In 1892 Wellesley toured the USA and Canada speaking about his work with leprosy sufferers.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p47 Wellesley Bailey was becoming a key figure in Mission circles, and his knowledge and experience of leprosy work was sought after. In 1893 he was invited to Chicago to speak at the World Congress of Missions. In 1906 Wellesley Bailey set off again for a tour of the East.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p48 Then in 1913 Wellesley embarked on what was to be his last voyage to visit the work that The Mission to Lepers had started.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p54 Wellesely and Alice Bailey journeyed through China, then on to New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, Korea, back to China and then on to Malaysia, Singapore and India. During this tour he gave over 150 addresses, met with many government officials and visited leprosy homes everywhere. The situation they returned to in Scotland, and Europe, was difficult to bear. The workload for the Mission increased significantly. They lost a couple of key members of staff within a short space of time.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p56 Then war broke out in 1914 and one of Bailey's sons, Dermot, was killed in the fighting. Retirement In 1917, at the age of 71, Wellesley Bailey made the decision to retire from his work with the Mission.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p58 He had spent the best part of 50 years dedicated to serving those with leprosy. By the time of his retirement, The Mission to Lepers was working with over 14,000 leprosy-affected people in 12 countries.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p59 His granddaughter later wrote about him: 'He was not a saint, nor even a clever man... But I do not ever remember hearing from him an ungenerous remark, or seeing him angry apart from minor irritations. His great gift was single-mindedness, and a simplicity that perhaps could not see the difficulties which a more sophisticated mind might see.' Wellesley Bailey died in 1937, aged 91.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p69 Wellesley Bailey's impact on leprosy work Before the birth of the Mission to Lepers, support for leprosy work was not very high on people's agendas. Wellesley Bailey saw a huge need when he first visited the leprosy huts in Ambala and set about raising awareness of the plight of those with leprosy, which subsequently raised financial support allowing the work to grow and continue.Caring Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987 The Leprosy Mission exists to this day. In one of his last speeches before his retirement, Wellesley said: 'The Mission has been born and cradled in prayer. It has been brought up on prayer; it has been nourished on prayer; and prayer has been at the bottom of its success since the first moments of its life.'Comes First: The Leprosy Mission Story, Cyril Davey, Marshall Pickering, 1987, p58 ReferencesExternal links * The Leprosy Mission International Category:1937 deaths Category:1846 births Category:Irish Christian missionaries Category:People educated at Kilkenny College Category:Anglican missionaries in India Category:Christian medical missionaries Category:Irish expatriates in India ","title":"Wellesley Bailey"},{"id":"25892664","text":"Tarja Filatov (born August 9, 1963 in H√§meenlinna) is a Finnish member of Parliament representing the H√§me constituency since 1995, and a former government minister.

He emigrated and after his return devoted seven years to polishing his interrupted studies, beginning his public career modestly in 1802 as secretary to the commission that was charged with working out the Napoleonic Code rural. As an auditeur to the Council of State, 1806, he was sent to the D√©partement du Rhin, which was being reorganized as a department integral to France. Refusing to desert his post with the Austrian advances of 1809 he was taken prisoner (11 June) and transported to Hungary; after two months he was released and presented at Sch√∂nbrunn to Napoleon, who charged him with presenting a dossier on the Habsburg strengths. On the basis of the swiftly accomplished report he was made Prefect of Rome (6 September). In the absence of the Pope, the Papal States had been incorporated as an integral part of France. By a decree of the Emperor, 1811, one million francs were provided to finance excavation and conservation works at Rome, of which Tournon-Simiane was in charge. Conservation works in the Roman forums from the Campidoglio to the Colosseum, were published in his Etudes Statistiques, 1831, in which he provided an account of the aims and scope of excavations undertaken during his administration, contrasting it with the wholesale pillaging that had taken place in 1798, under the terms of the Treaty of Tolentino.Frank Salmon, \\"'Storming the Campo Vaccino': British Architects and the Antique Buildings of Rome after Waterloo\\" Architectural History 38 (1995:146-175) p150. The most spectacular changes removed 4 metres of silt from the Forum Romanum, taking the profile down to the level of the Via Sacra. Medieval houses that encroached on the forum site were purchased and demolished. So was the convent of Santa Francesca Romana, and structures were detached from the Arch of Titus. The Temple of Castor and Pollux was cleared to the top of its podium, and 60,000 cubic metres of earth was removed from the Basilica of Maxentius, known as the \\"Temple of Peace\\", exposing its ancient pavement and portico. A volume of fully 10 metres depth of earth was removed from the three columns of Vespasian's Temple of Juppiter Tonans.Salmon 1995:151f. Broadly speaking, the Forum recognized in Piranesi's etchings was transformed to the forum we know today.

Garter stall plate of Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy, KG, St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy, KG (1 August 1474) was an English politician. Early life and family Walter Blount was born about 1416, the eldest son of Sir Thomas Blount (1378‚Äì1456) and Margery Gresley and grandson of Sir Walter Blount. Career He was made Steward of the High Peak in Derbyshire and became a bitter rival of the local Vernon and Longford families, replacing the Vernons in parliament as the near permanent Knight of the Shire (1447, Feb. 1449, 1450‚Äì51, 1453‚Äì54, 1455‚Äì56, 1460‚Äì61) for Derbyshire. He succeeded his father, Sir Thomas Blount, as Treasurer of Calais in 1460, becoming governor a year later as a reward for service rendered to King Edward IV at the Battle of Towton. Edward conferred on him in 1467 rich estates in Devon forfeited by the Earl of Devon; and in 1465 Blount was made lord high treasurer and created Baron Mountjoy. This creation is noteworthy as one of the earliest examples of a baronial title not being of a territorial character; nor the title of a dignity already existing. Blount's great- grandfather had married Isolda, daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas de Mountjoy, and the title was probably chosen to commemorate this alliance. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1472. On his death on 1 August 1474 in Greyfriars, London his grandson Edward Blount, 2nd Baron Mountjoy inherited his title.

Life He was born at Brechin on 10 September 1822, son of David Mitchell, convener of local guilds, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of James Ferrier of Broadmyre. After being educated at Brechin grammar school, he proceeded in 1837 to St. Mary's College, St. Andrews, winning an entrance bursary in classics. He graduated M.A. in 1841, and in 1844 was licensed to preach. After acting as assistant to the ministers at Meigle and Dundee, he was in 1847 ordained by Meigle presbytery to the charge of Dunnichen. Adhering to the established church during the secession movement, he became in 1848 a member of the general assembly. In the same year, when only 26, he was appointed professor of Hebrew in St. Mary's College, where he innovated in teaching methods. As convener from 1856 to 1875 of the committee of the mission to the Jews, Mitchell did much to develop missions in the Levant, which he visited himself in 1857. His main interests lay, however, in Scottish ecclesiastical history, and in 1868 he succeeded John Cook as professor of divinity and ecclesiastical history in St. Mary's College. Mitchell held his chair for 26 years, and during that period published a number of works on Scottish ecclesiastical history. He was an active member of the Scottish Historical and Text Societies, and took a prominent part in the general councils of the Presbyterian Alliance, attending the meeting at Philadelphia in 1880. In 1885 he was elected moderator of the church of Scotland, and the address he delivered at the close of the session was separately published (Edinburgh and London, 1885). In 1894 he retired from his professorship. He was made D.D. of St. Andrews in 1862, and honorary LL.D. of Glasgow in 1892. He divided his later years between his house at Gowan Park, near Brechin, and 56 South Street, St Andrews. He died at St. Andrews on 22 March 1899, and was buried in Brechin Cathedral churchyard. Family In 1852 he married Margaret Tweedie Johnstone, the eldest daughter of Michael Johnstone of Archbank, near Moffat, and was survived by three sons and four daughters, including Robert Haldane Mitchell.

Midge orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single leaf at the base of the plant. They are similar to orchids in the genus Prasophyllum in that plants without flowers have a hollow, onion-like leaf. The flowers are small but often scented and attractive to their insect pollinators. There is disagreement about which species belong to this genus and some taxonomists suggest that most belong in the genus Corunastylis. Description Orchids in the genus Genoplesium are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs, usually with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and a pair of more or less spherical tubers. The tubers are partly covered by a protective fibrous sheath which extends to the soil surface. Replacement tubers form at the end of short root-like stolons. Orchids in this genus do not reproduce using \\"daughter\\" tubers, but rely on their flowers for reproduction. A single long, cylindrical, glabrous leaf develops near the base of the plant and is fused to the flowering stem. The leaf of flowering plants is solid but those of sterile plants are hollow. The inflorescence is a spike or raceme with a few to many non-resupinate flowers which are often have reddish brown or purple parts and often smell fruity. The dorsal sepal is usually shorter and wider than two lateral sepals, dished on the lower surface and often forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are often joined near their bases and the lateral petals are shorter and narrower than the sepals. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum, much different from the other petals and sepals. The labellum is above the column and joined to it by a flexible attachment, so that the labellum vibrates in a breeze. The edge of the labellum sometimes has fine teeth, glands or hairs. The labellum has a callus which consists often covers its surface and which consists of a raised, fleshy plate. The sexual parts of the flower are fused to the column which is short and has narrow wings, often with an extension at the front. Midge orchids usually flower in summer, autumn or winter, depending on species, and the fruit that follows flowering is a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing up to 500 seeds. Taxonomy and naming The genus Genoplesium was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1810 and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. The type species is G. baueri. The name Genoplesium is derived from the Ancient Greek words genos meaning \\"race\\", \\"stock\\" or \\"kind\\" and plesios meaning \\"near\\" referring to the similarity of these orchids to those in the genus Prasophyllum. David Jones and Mark Clements proposed moving all but one species of Genoplesium to Corunastylis. The change has been accepted by the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria who list eleven species of Corunastylis but not the Index Kewensis. Distribution and habitat Midge orchids mainly occur in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. There is one species (G. calopterum) in New Caledonia and two (G. nudum and G. pumilum) in New Zealand. Most Genoplesium species occur in near-coastal regions but also grow in montane and sub-alpine areas. In Australia they are most common in moss beds over rock, in forest, woodland, heath and mallee. Genoplesium species in New Zealand grow in grassy places as well as in swamps and the New Caledonian species grows in stunted maquis. Ecology Some of the characteristics of the flowers of midge orchids, such as small size, dull colours and hairy parts waving in a breeze, suggest pollination by small flies. Some studies have suggested that the flowers are pollinated exclusively by flies of the Superfamily Chloropoidea (now in the Family Milichiidae). A few species, such as the New Zealand G. nudum appear to exclusively self- pollinate.

They are deciduous, terrestrial herbs with underground pseudobulbs, broad, pleated leaves and small to medium-sized, tube-shaped or bell-shaped flowers on a flowering stem with a drooping end. Species in this genus are found in southern Japan, tropical Asia, Australia and islands of the southwest Pacific Ocean. Description Orchids in the genus Geodorum are deciduous, terrestrial herbs with pseudobulbs underground but close to the surface. There are several pleated leaves emerging from the pseudobulb, the largest at the top. Each leaf has a stalk which wraps around those below it. The flower stalk also emerges from the pseudobulb and bears a few to many bell-shaped or tubular flowers. The sepals and petals are similar in size and shape and do not spread widely apart from each other, so that the flowers do not open widely. The portion of the flowering stem carrying flowers droops, so that although the flowers are non-resupinate, the labellum is the lowest part of the flower. The labellum has three lobes but lacks the spur or pouch of orchids in the similar genus Eulophia. Taxonomy and naming The first formal description of Geodorum appeared in The Botanist's Repository for New, and Rare Plants edited by Henry Cranke Andrews. There is a description and an illustration of Geodorum citrinum, now known as Geodorum terrestre. The illustration was the work of Andrews but although not recognised in the book, the description is believed to be the work of George Jackson. The name Geodorum is derived from the Ancient Greek words ge meaning \\"earth\\" and doron meaning \\"leaf\\", apparently referring to the terrestrial habit of orchids in this genus. Species Species accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as of October 2018 are: * Geodorum attenuatum Griff. \\\\- Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Hainan, Yunnan * Geodorum densiflorum (Lam.)

Garay \\\\- Bangladesh, Thailand, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia, Australia Distribution Orchids in this genus are found in India, Southeast Asia including Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. There are two species endemic to China and others occur in New Guinea and New Caledonia. One species (Geodorum terrestre) occurs in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales.

The museum was located at the corner of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Drive and Walnut Street from its founding until 2015.

The ceremony included a march from the old Tubman Museum to the new building where the ribbon cutting took place. \\"http://macon.13wmaz.com/news/news/294792-tubman-museum- hosts-farewell-party\\"  Mission  The museum's mission is to educate people on African American culture and history. The museum also offers an array of exhibitions, programs, and publications for the general public and student groups from kindergarten through college. There are classes offered in dancing, drama, drumming, photography, and visual art that are focused on African American culture. The Museum's Beginnings Picture of an art exhibit at the Tubman Museum in Macon GA The Tubman Museum had been a longtime dream of the Rev. Richard Keil, formed over more than two decades of working in predominantly black churches primarily in the South. When Keil, a Catholic priest, was assigned to St. Peter Claver Church in Macon, he thought the city would be the perfect place for the museum, given its central location and access to interstates. In 1981, after consulting with various African American community leaders, he found a building on Walnut Street, made the down payment and personally signed for a loan, confident that others would contribute. In his 2015 book, ‚ÄúLessons along the Way,‚Äù Keil explained his motivation for starting the museum: He credited many with offering ideas for the museum and helping to get it up and running: high school principal Gloria Washington; Mercer University professor Bobby Jones; contractor and county commissioner Albert Billingslea, as well as his wife Margaret; Pearlie and John T Oliver, a bank vice president and state government official, respectively; and Maureen Walker, then director of the Ruth Hartley Mosley Center, who encouraged him to go for it. The museum moved to its new location, on Cherry Street, across from the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, in 2015. Its directors say it is the largest museum in the Southeast devoted to African-American art, history and culture.  Art = Galleries & Exhibitions  The Tubman museum offers an array of galleries and exhibitions, including From Africa to America a mural by contemporary Macon artist Wilfred Stroud. The mural portrays events from Africa to America which started in 1619. It also offers galleries such as I Dream a World: Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America and Sankofa: A Century of African American Expression in the Decorative Arts. The museum offers many different art collections such as The Mural, Inventors Gallery, Local History, Folk Art and Black Artist of Georgia.

A force of three to four thousand Ikhwan, led by Faisal Al-Dawish, attacked the Red Fort at Al-Jahra, defended by fifteen hundred men. The fort was besieged and the Kuwaiti position precarious; had the fort fallen, Kuwait would likely have been incorporated into Ibn Saud's empire.

The Ikhwan attack repulsed for the while, negotiations began between Salim and Al-Dawish; the latter threatened another attack if the Kuwaiti forces did not surrender.

About forty five species of Vrydagzynea have been formally described. They are native to India, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Malesia, Melanesia and Polynesia. A single species in Australia is possibly extinct. They have thinly textured, stalked leaves and small, dull-coloured resupinate flowers with the dorsal sepal and petals overlapping to form a hood over the column. Description Orchids in the genus Vrydagzynea are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with a fleshy, creeping, above-ground rhizome anchored by wiry roots. The leaves are thinly textured and stalked, arranged in a rosette at the base of the flowering stem or scattered along it. Small, resupinate dull-coloured flowers are crowded along the short flowering stem which usually has protruding bracts. The dorsal sepal and petals overlap, forming a hood over the column. The labellum has a downward pointing spur and two stalked glands that resemble tonsils or testicles. Orchids in this genus are distinguished from those in other similar genera by the labellum glands, labellum spur and by having petals which are shorter than the sepals. Taxonomy and naming The genus Vrydagzynea was first formally described in 1858 by Carl Ludwig Blume and the description was published in his book Collection des Orchid√©es les plus remarquables de l'archipel Indien et du Japon. The name Vrydagzynea honours the Dutch pharmacologist Theodore Daniel Vrydag Zynen, a contemporary of Blume.

Native to streams and rivers in India, the only surviving wild population is in the Cauvery River, leading to its IUCN rating as vulnerable. It is widely aquafarmed and introduced populations exist outside its native range. It reaches a maximum length of . This species and Cirrhinus mrigala are considered distinct. Aquaculture Mrigal is popular as a food fish and an important aquacultured freshwater species throughout South Asia.Development of freshwater fish farming and poverty alleviation - A case study from Bangladesh It is widely farmed as a component of a polyculture system of three Indian major carps, along with roho labeo and the catla. The introduction to aquaculture across India started in the early 1940s and in the 1950s and in the 1960s to other Asian countries. The mrigal carp fails to breed naturally in ponds, thus induced breeding is done. The Indian carps are considered as a delicacy compared to other exotic carp species also cultured in Asia, and sell for higher prices. Reported annual aquafarming production numbers of mrigal carp since the early 1990s have varied between 250,000 and 550,000 tonnes, with no clear trend. India and Bangladesh are the largest producers. In Pakistan, this fish is known by the name of \\"Morakhi\\" or \\"Moree\\". Habitat and ecology Mrigal is the benthopelagic and potamodromous plankton feeder. It inhabits fast flowing streams and rivers, but can tolerate high levels of salinity. Spawning occurs in marginal areas of the water bodies with a depth of over a sand or clay substrate. A female can lay a million eggs. This fish has a rapid growth rate; by the age of two individuals can reach a length of and can weigh as much as .
