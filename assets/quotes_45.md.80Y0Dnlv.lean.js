James Fieser states the altruist dictum as: \\"An action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone except the agent.\\" Auguste Comte's version of altruism calls for living for the sake of others. One who holds to either of these ethics is known as an \\"altruist.\\" The word \\"altruism\\" (French, altruisme, from autrui: \\"other people\\", derived from Latin alter: \\"other\\") was coined by Auguste Comte, the French founder of positivism, in order to describe the ethical doctrine he supported. He believed that individuals had a moral obligation to renounce self-interest and live for others. Comte says, in his Cat√©chisme Positiviste,Comte, August. Cat√©chisme positiviste (1852) or Catechism of Positivism, trans. R. Congreve, (London: Kegan Paul, 1891) that: > [The] social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights, for such > notion rests on individualism. We are born under a load of obligations of > every kind, to our predecessors, to our successors, to our contemporaries. > After our birth these obligations increase or accumulate, for it is some > time before we can return any service.... This [\\"to live for others\\"], the > definitive formula of human morality, gives a direct sanction exclusively to > our instincts of benevolence, the common source of happiness and duty. [Man > must serve] Humanity, whose we are entirely.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia says that for Comte's altruism, \\"The first principle of morality...is the regulative supremacy of social sympathy over the self- regarding instincts.\\" Author Gabriel Moran, (professor in the department of Humanities and the Social Sciences, New York University) says \\"The law and duty of life in altruism [for Comte] was summed up in the phrase : Live for others.\\"Gabriel Moran Christian Religion and National Interests Various philosophers define the doctrine in various ways, but all definitions generally revolve around a moral obligation to benefit others or the pronouncement of moral value in serving others rather than oneself. Philosopher C. D. Broad defines altruism as \\"the doctrine that each of us has a special obligation to benefit others.\\"Cheney, D. R. (Editor), Broad's critical essays in moral philosophy (pp. 283‚Äì301). London: Allen & Unwin. Philosopher W. G. Maclagan defines it as \\"a duty to relieve the distress and promote the happiness of our fellows...Altruism is to...maintain quite simply that a man may and should discount altogether his own pleasure or happiness as such when he is deciding what course of action to pursue.\\"Self and Others: A Defense of Altruism Philosophical Quarterly 4 (1954): pp 109‚Äì110. As consequentialist ethics Altruism is often seen as a form of consequentialism, as it indicates that an action is ethically right if it brings good consequences to others. Altruism may be seen as similar to utilitarianism, however an essential difference is that the latter prescribes acts that maximize good consequences for all of society, while altruism prescribes maximizing good consequences for everyone except the actor. Spencer argued that since the rest of society will almost always outnumber the utilitarian, a genuine utilitarian will inevitably end up practicing altruism or a form of altruism.Principles of Ethics ¬ß85ff Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that maintains that the consequences of our actions - for ourselves and others - are important, and seeks to maximise the overall quality of these consequences. Criticisms David Kelley, discussing Ayn Rand's views, says that \\"there is no rational ground for asserting that sacrificing yourself in order to serve others is morally superior to pursuing your own (long-term, rational) self-interest. Altruism ultimately depends on non-rational 'rationales,' on mysticism in some form...\\" Furthermore, he holds that there is a danger of the state enforcing that moral ideal: \\"If self- sacrifice is an ideal - if service to others is the highest, most honorable course of action - why not force people to act accordingly?\\" He believes this can ultimately result in the state forcing everyone into a collectivist political system.Kelley, David. https://atlassociety.org/commentary/commentary-blog/3666-epistemology-and- politics-ayn-rand-s-cultural-commentary Norwegian eco-philosopher Arne N√¶ss argues that environmental action based upon altruism ‚Äî or service of the other ‚Äî stems from a shrunken \\"egoic\\" concept of the self. Self-actualization will result, he argues, in the recovery of an \\"ecological self\\", in which actions formerly seen as altruistic are in reality a form of enlightened self- interest.Seed, John, Macy, Joanna, Naess, Arne, & Fleming, Pat (1988). \\"Thinking Like a Mountain: Towards a Council of All Beings\\" (New Society Press) German philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes two different ways in which the strong can help the weak, one which is an expression of love, \\"motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one‚Äôs own life and existence\\" and another which is merely \\"one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people‚Äôs business.\\" At its worst, Scheler says, \\"love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse.\\" See also * Agape * Egalitarianism * Ethical egoism * MettƒÅ * Ubuntu ReferencesExternal links * Ayn Rand's quotes on Altruism Category:Altruism Category:Consequentialism ","title":"Altruism (ethics)"},{"id":"3792267","text":"Hedrick is a small unincorporated community in Jordan Township, Warren County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.  History  The town of Hedrick began on 31 July 1881 with its platting by locals Parmenas G. Smith and G. W. Compton. The first house was built by John Hendricks and the first store opened by Zarse & Ahrens. The town also gained a drug store operated by Frank Hartman and a school house erected in the early 1880s. A post office was established in Hedrick on 14 January 1880 and closed on 31 January 1959. A tornado nearly destroyed Hedrick on 17 April 1922. The storm cut a path through the town an eighth of a mile wide, killing four residents, destroying six homes and ten businesses, and leaving only three buildings intact. Following the storm, newspapers estimated from ten to fifty thousand people flocked to the area to view the destruction, prompting the governor to deploy part of the state militia to control the crowds and prevent looting.  Geography  Hedrick is located on flat, open farmland on the southern edge of Jordan Township, at the intersection of County Roads 900 West and 100 South. It is about east of the Illinois border, west of the county seat of Williamsport, and north of State Road 28. Its elevation is 709 feet. Prior to the founding of the town, a wooded site called Hedrick's Grove stood to the east of nearby Redwood Creek.

The Nevilles had their family seat at the manor of Raby (turned into Raby Castle in the 14th century) in County Durham, and so were called barons \\"Neville of Raby\\". The title was first held as a barony by tenure (the Nevilles being feudal barons of Raby), and was afterwards created twice (in 1295 and 1459) by writ of summons to parliament. The Neville barony of Raby came to existence in the 13th century, by the marriage of Robert fitz Meldred, lord of Raby, to Isabel de Neville, the heiress of a family of Norman origin. Their son, Geoffrey fitz Robert, adopted his mother's surname 'Neville' and inherited from his father the feudal barony of Raby, becoming the first \\"Baron Neville of Raby\\". The barony by writ was created when Geoffrey de Neville's great-grandson, Ranulph, the third baron, was summoned to parliament on 24 June 1295, whereby he is held to have become 'Lord Neville' (of Raby). It was created once again, on 20 November 1459, for John Neville, a younger scion of the family (he did not own Raby castle and so was simply called \\"Lord Neville\\"). His son Ralph later inherited the earldom of Westmorland together with the two previous creations of the barony.

The community of Destrehan was named for his family. Destr√©han was born in colonial New Orleans to Jean Baptiste d'Estrehan and Jeanne Catherine de Gauvret (1729-1773) and was educated in France. His father was the colonial treasurer for France, and his brother-in-law was Etienne de Bor√©, who perfected the sugar granulation process and served as New Orleans' first mayor. Destr√©han married Marie Claudine El√©onore Robin de Logny in 1786 and bought Destr√©han Plantation in 1792. After the Louisiana Purchase, he served as Speaker of the territorial House of Representatives from 1804 to 1806 before receiving an appointment from President Thomas Jefferson to serve on the Orleans Territorial Council. Destr√©han served in this position during 1806 as president of the council. President James Madison appointed him to a second legislative council for Orleans Territory in 1811, where he served again as president.Congressional biography The Orleans Territorial Council crafted a legal system based on French and Spanish civil codes and established Louisiana's parish system of governance. Destr√©han ran for Governor in the first gubernatorial election since statehood, but he placed a distant third behind William C. C. Claiborne and Jacques Viller√©. He was selected to serve in the United States Senate instead, but he resigned within a month. He served in the Louisiana State Senate from 1812 to 1817. He again ran for Governor in the 1820 election but placed fourth. During the 1814-15 Battle of New Orleans threat, Jean N. Destrehan served on the Committee of Defense and three of his sons served in a cavalry unit. He continued planting, dying at his plantation on October 4, 1823. Destr√©han was buried at the St. Charles Borromeo Church cemetery in Destrehan, Louisiana. Jean No√´l Destr√©han and sugar plantation slavery Destr√©han pioneered the Creole system of slave labor on his sugar plantations. A blend between the harsher gang system and the more lenient task system, the Creole approach was to use head slaves called drivers to allot tasks and inspect work, as opposed to relying on a hired overseer. During the planting and grinding seasons, plantation owners required slaves to work long hours; but during the off-season when the sugar cane fields needed little maintenance, slaves were allowed a considerable amount of time off to grow food, work for themselves, and trade. Several of Destr√©han's slaves participated in the 1811 German Coast Uprising, said to have been the largest slave rebellion in American history. Destr√©han himself served on a local six- member tribunal at the conclusion of the revolt. Destrehan Plantation was the location of the St. Charles Parish slave trials. Three of Destr√©han's slaves were among the eighteen conspirators who were summarily executed.

He turned to the American Hockey Association who gave him rights to an expansion team in Chicago. The league had renamed itself the American Hockey League and declared itself a major league, to the anger of NHL president Frank Calder, who branded the league an outlaw league. In 1931-32 season, their second, the Shamrocks won the league championship. Convinced they should be given a chance to play for the Stanley Cup, they petitioned the Cup trustees for that opportunity. However the trustees would have to convince the NHL to accept that challenge and the NHL would not. Perhaps frustrated by this, Norris once again looked to join the NHL. In May 1932, the Detroit Falcons of the NHL declared bankruptcy, and Norris used that opportunity to convince the NHL he could take over the team. The NHL agreed on the condition that he disband the Shamrocks who were a thorn in the side for the Chicago Blackhawks. So he disbanded the Shamrocks and took three of the best players with him to Detroit. He renamed the Detroit team to the Red Wings.

From the early 1970s until November 1973, the station was known as \\"The Alternative at 102.9\\", following a music format that at the time was called \\"progressive\\" or \\"underground\\"; in effect, playing music that was not widely known and/or not readily available on the more popular AM radio stations. Typical playlists would include artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Cream and lesser-known rock and roll performers.

Y-103 broadcast from Pine Hollow Boulevard studios in Sharon PA until November 1998, when the studios were moved to the \\"Radio Center\\" in Youngstown, OH. The transmitter and antenna remained at the Pennsylvania location transmitting from, what was at the time of its construction the tallest self-support tower east of the Mississippi (500'), until 2001. The Sharon tower has since been demolished. WYFM is also the affiliate of the Cleveland Browns.

Originally chartered to build a railroad from Denver, Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico, the charter was later changed instead connect southward to the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway which was building northwest from Fort Worth, Texas. After the \\"completion of the Denver and New Orleans Railroad in July, 1882\\" from Denver to Pueblo, Colorado‚Äîthe Denver, Texas and Fort Worth Railroad was organized to build south from the D&NO; at Pueblo, Colorado. In 1888 it linked with the FW&DC;, and in central Colorado it had a branch to Franceville, Colorado, for coal from the Franceville Mine, and the branch into Colorado Springs from Jimmy Camp station in September 1882 \\"was renamed Manitou Junction [a site now] near where US24 and Colorado 94 meet\\" north of Peterson Air Force Base.http://www.westsidepioneer.com/Articles/092409/CobwebCorners.html The three railroads came under control of General Grenville Dodge and the Union Pacific Railroad. The southern lines were merged into the Colorado Central Railroad and the Cheyenne and Northern Railway to form the Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf Railway. Following the UPRR bankruptcy in 1893, the system was separated from UPRR and merged into the Denver, Leadville and Gunnison Railway by Frank Trumbull to form the Colorado and Southern Railway in 1899. The original D&NO; line between South Denver and Manitou Junction/Colorado Springs remained active after 1899, as this became a secondary route-- with most C&S; traffic now using the more direct Santa Fe mainline to the west. The tracks south of Manitou Junction were unused-- save a short stretch from Overton oil refinery to Pueblo after 1899. By 1913, the northernmost portion of the 123 miles route was downgraded multiple times. Service was cut south of Falcon in 1917, and a 1935 flood washed the tracks away south of Elizabeth at Mile post 39. The railroad rebuilt to Elbert, Mile post 52, only to abandon the bulk of the route a year later. Salvagers removed the rails from Sullivan (mile post 10) to Elbert that year. Another mile came up in 1938, with an 8.5 mile Connors spur serving local industry until 1981. The last piece of actual D&NO; line to close was the Erie Street \\"Wann Spur\\" in Pueblo, during 1999. All abandonment of the railroad occurred under Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and Burlington Northern, BNSF control.

The WRQK-FM studios are located in North Canton, while the station transmitter resides in Canton. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WRQK-FM broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio.

Both stations were purchased in 1965 by Don Keyes, who had made his mark as a national programmer for legendary station owner Gordon McLendon. In 1971, he sold the FM station to Susquehanna Radio Corporation, the owners of WHLO in Akron, whereupon WNYN-FM became WHLQ. Susquehanna sold the station in 1978 to the owners of WINW, who applied to change the FM call letters to WHOF (for the \\"Hall of Fame\\" city of Canton) but were rebuffed by the owners of WTOF, another local FM station. (Coincidentally, WRQK-FM now has a new Clear Channel sister station using the WHOF call letters.) 106.9 adopted an automated Top 40 format and became WOOS-FM on June 1, 1979. WOOS-FM changed its call sign to WRQK on August 3, 1985, taking on an album oriented rock music format. For a while, the station called itself Goodrock 107, an apparent play on the name of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in nearby Akron. It formally changed from WRQK to WRQK-FM on February 14, 1989, when AM station WINW changed its call sign to WRQK. The AM station changed back to WINW six months later, but the FM call sign has remained WRQK-FM. In 1995, the station was sold by Jim Embrescia's Canton/Akron Radio, Inc. to Sabre Communications. Then In 1997, SabreComm sold to Connoisseur. Connoisseur sold their entire radio group to Cumulus. Then, on August 8, 2006, it was announced that WRQK-FM would be sold to Clear Channel Communications, pairing WRQK-FM with former partner WHLO, as well as WARF, WKDD, and WHOF. Clear Channel took over operations of WRQK-FM on January 15, 2007, pending FCC approval of its purchase of the station from Cumulus. In March 2007, WRQK-FM changed its branding from \\"Rock 107\\" to \\"Rock 106.9\\"; and also changed slogans from \\"Canton's Rock Station\\" to \\"It Just Rocks!\\", in an effort to also serve the Akron market, in early 2017 the station changed the slogan back to \\"Canton's Rock Station\\" Current programming WRQK-FM personality and former Maxwell Show sidekick Dan Stansbury hosts the morning drive program.Stansbury on WRQK - WRQK.com Local personality \\"Captain\\" Tony McGinty is heard in afternoon drive,Captain Tony on WRQK - WRQK.com and other music programming is provided via the Premium Choice network.

He is best known for his painting The Recall of Columbus and among coin collectors for writing A Treatise on Coinage of the United States Branch Mints, which introduced numismatists to mint marks. Biography=Personal life Augustus Goodyear Heaton was born Augustus George HeatonThe Encyclopedia Americana: a library of universal knowledge (1919), p.54 in Philadelphia on April 28, 1844, to Augustus and Rosabella (n√©e Crean) Heaton. Heaton married Adelaide Griswold in New York City on December 24, 1874, and had three children; Augustus (1875), Henry (1877) and Perry (1884) before divorcing in 1898. Heaton lived in various locations: New York City in the late 1870s; Paris, France in the early 1880s; Philadelphia (1884); Washington, D.C. (1885); and then West Palm Beach, Florida. In 1890, 1892 and 1930, he was in New Orleans where he gave art lectures and painted portraits of numerous prominent citizens. Art Heaton was a student at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts with Peter F. Rothermel, and was the first American student at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris with Alexandre Cabenel and Leon Bonnat. Heaton was also a teacher in Philadelphia at the Art Students League of New York. The Recall of Columbus Most of Heaton's paintings are portraits, including Varina Davis, second wife of President Jefferson Davis, known as First Lady of the Confederate States of America (1892), Sculptor Chauncey Ives (1883), Opera singer Emma Nevada and Bishop Thomas Bowman of Cornell College, Iowa. (1883).Rossiter Johnson, John Howard Brown (1904). The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans, p.216. The Biographical Society, Boston, Massachusetts His most famous painting, however, and the one of which he was most proud, was The Recall of Columbus, painted in 1882 and copyrighted in 1891 as the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' landing approached. It was begun in his Paris studio and finished in Rome in the studio of American sculptor Chauncey Ives. The painting was sent to the U.S. Capitol in 1884 to be reviewed by the Joint Committee on the Library, purchased later that year for $3,000 and remains part of the United States Senate Art and History Collection. In 1892, the painting was exhibited at the Columbian Historical Exposition in Madrid in 1892 and again in 1893 at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Also in 1893, to mark the Chicago Exposition, was the release of the Columbian Issue, a set of 16 commemorative stamps issued by the United States. The 50 cent stamp featured The Recall of Columbus bringing the painting to the attention of the general public. Heaton was one of the founding members of the New Rochelle Art Association, organized in 1912, and part of the well known Art Colony that had developed in New Rochelle in the early 1900s.NRAA - Fouder's Exhibit; A. G. Heaton Other works of note are The First Mission of Washington (1862), Columbia's Night Watch (1866), Bathing Hour at Trouville (1880) and The Promoters of the New Congressional Library (1888), which is a life sized group portrait composed of eighteen prominent statesmen. His Hardships of Emigration was also placed on a stamp for the Omaha Fair in 1898. Numismatics A. G. Heaton was the third president of the American Numismatic Association, governing from 1894 to 1899 . In 1893, he published his famous Treatise on Coinage of the United States Branch Mints, which revolutionized numismatics. Until its publication, collectors generally only collected by date. Heaton's Treatise, commonly referred to as just Mint Marks, showed that the coinage of the branch mints was often significantly more scarce and hence worth far more. In 1900, Heaton updated Mint Marks in the article, Late Coinage of the United States Mint, published in The Numismatist. Heaton was a frequent contributor to The Numismatist, submitting both articles and poetry, including The Numismatist and the Burglar, published by The Numismatist in 1894 and later appeared in Heaton's book, Fancies and Thoughts in Verse.Augustus Goodyear Heaton (1904).

It has since entered the folk tradition and been recorded under variations of the title‚Äî\\"But the Cat Came Back\\", \\"And the Cat Came Back\\", etc. It is also a popular children's song.  Theme  The song is humorous in nature, telling a silly tale about \\"ole Mister Johnson\\" who had an \\"ole yaller cat\\" that he did not want, and which kept coming back when he tried to get rid of it: > But the cat came back, he couldn't stay no long-er, Yes the cat came back de > very next day, the cat came back‚Äîthought she were a goner, But the cat came > back for it wouldn't stay away. In Miller's original, the cat finally died when an organ grinder came around one day and: > De cat look'd around awhile an' kinder raised her head When he played Ta- > rah-dah-boom-da-rah, an' de cat dropped dead. Even then the cat's ghost came back. The first commercial recording of the song was ca. 1894 for the Columbia Phonograph Company, Washington D.C., performed by Charles Marsh.copy in private hands in Los Angeles, CA \\"The Cat Came Back\\" was later recorded by Fiddlin' John Carson (OKeh catalog #40119) in April 1924. Other early recordings include one by Dock Philipine \\"Fiddlin' Doc\\" Roberts (\\"And The Cat Came Back The Very Next Day\\", Gennett 3235), on November 13, 1925. The original sheet music described the song as \\"A Comic Negro Absurdity\\" on the back page and provided an additional eight verses as well as a final chorus.http://levysheetmusic.mse.jhu.edu/catalog/levy:054.022 A 1900 London edition of the sheet music described it as \\"A Nigger Absurdity\\" on the cover sheet.Sheet music, W. Paxton, London, copyright 1900 Timing of the song The song is often used to teach children the concepts of rhythm and tempo. It is an excellent example in this regard, especially the minor key versions of the song, because of the strong and consistent beat pattern, combined with amusing and humorous lyrics. Like many children's songs, the song has a strong well-defined beat pattern. It consists of one weak beat, one strong beat, so it is often sung in time. Thus it can be (and often is) sung while walking, with, for example, strong beats when the left foot hits the ground and weak beats when the right foot hits the ground. Versions of the song There are many versions of the song. In one, the cat is yellow. One version goes something like: ;first verse: > Now _old_ Mr. _John_ son had some _trou_ bles of his _own_ , > He _had_ a scarlet _cat_ that just _woul_ dn't leave his _home_ , > He _tried_ and he _tried_ to _give_ the cat a _way_ , > He _gave_ it to a _man_ going _far_ far a _way_. ;chorus: > But the _cat_ came _back_ the _very_ next _day_ , > The _cat_ came _back_ , we _thought_ he was a _goner_ , > The _cat_ came _back_ , he __just_ wouldn't _stay_ a _way_. ;alternative chorus: > But the _cat_ came _back_ he wouldn't stay away, > He was _sitt_ ing on the _porch_ the very next day. Every second beat is emphasized (emphasized beats are shown underlined in bold). Each line of text in the above has eight beats, and usually the chords fall (piano) or begin (organ) on the capitalized words. The chord progression repeats every 8 beats, so one might think of the song as being in either 2/ time or 8/ time (whichever denominator is used for reference time, i.e. 2/4 or 8/4 time if the beat is a quarter note, etc.). The pattern of 2/ and 8/ is similar to the beat pattern in \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\", but phase- shifted by 180 degrees (since the song starts on a weak beat rather than the strong beat beginning of \\"Twinkle Twinkle\\"). A later version of the song emerged during the Cold War, in which the final verse made references to the \\"atom bomb\\" and \\"H-bomb\\", and the subsequent destruction of the human race. Zero padding or improv/instrumental of the chorus As with many simple children's songs, it is often desirable to have the number of beats be a power of two, so that the first verse and chorus take up, for example, 64 beats instead of 56. The end of the chorus can be \\"padded\\" with eight beats of instrumental or improvised music to do this; alternatively an 8-beat rest (\\"zero padding\\") may be inserted. Key Many versions are in a major key, but there are some versions in a minor key. The chord progression for many of the minor-key versions is Em, D, C, B. Variations in the melody of the additional verses The additional verses often have a notable variation in melody but with the same chords. For example, the second verse often shoots up an octave to emphasize the words \\"dynamite\\" and \\"found\\" (each sung an octave above the first note of the song, which is \\"E\\" if the song is sung in the key of A-minor), even though the first verse does not shoot up that way The third verse often contains a descending scale that does not appear in the first or second verses. Microtonal and chirp-based versions of the chorus Also, the second line of the chorus \\"thought he was a goner\\" is often sung either off- key (deliberately), or just spoken (not sung), or includes chirps or quarter tones (notes that fall between semitones). In some versions the chirps can be approximated by a chromatic glissando. Bass line=Harmonic minor variations The chord progression lends itself exceptionally well to a bass line that's natural minor descending, and harmonic minor ascending, i.e. in the key of A-minor, the 8 beats (in 8/ time) would play out as A, A, G, G, F, F, E, G#. This is practically the lament bass used in many chaconnes, e.g. Pachelbel's Chaconne in F minor. Melodic minor variations Additionally, the bass line may be played as melodic minor (i.e. including both an F# and a G# on the way up). This second variation is effective in teaching children the concept of a melodic minor scale, since melodic minor otherwise occurs so seldom in simple children's songs. Cordell Barker's animated film Although the Barker animation does not involve many spoken lyrics, relying more on its animation to show the action, both spoken verses, as shown here, are different than other versions: Now, old Mr. Johnson had troubles of his own. He had a yellow cat that wouldn't leave his home! A special plan with deception as the key. One little cat--how hard could it be? and Well, old Mr. Johnson had troubles of his own. Still the yellow cat wouldn't leave his home! Steps were needed to remove the little curse. The old man knew it couldn't get any worse.

The decision is viewed by some groups as a landmark for women's rights as it is said to protect women with little job experience from becoming destitute when they get a divorce. Background A Polish couple, Andrzej and Zofia Moge, were separated in 1973 and eventually divorced. Zofia had been a house-wife for the duration of the marriage and experienced many difficulties in finding work once separated. She worked at a hotel as a maid but eventually lost her job. Andrzej paid child and spousal support at the time, but once Zofia lost her job, she applied to have an increase in spousal support. When Zofia found another job, Andrzej submitted an application to have the support cut-off. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the court could grant a cancellation of support on the grounds that she had not been able to reach a level of self-sufficiency. Ruling Justice L'Heureux-Dub√©, writing for the majority, held that the grounds for cancellation was insufficient. Though the Divorce Act has \\"self-sufficiency\\" as one of its objectives it does not subject the spouse to a \\"sink or swim\\" philosophy. L'Heureux-Dub√© instead proposed that cases be considered on the merits of the recipient's economic status that are a result of the marriage breakdown.

The Union victory over Confederate forces in northeast Mississippi ensured the safety of Sherman's supply lines during the Atlanta Campaign.  Background  The spring and summer of 1864 found the attention of the people of Mississippi focused on fighting in Virginia and Georgia. Interwoven with, and having important repercussions on, the fighting in northwestern Georgia were military operations in northeast Mississippi designed to prevent the Confederates under Lieutenant-General Stephen D. Lee and Major-General Nathan B. Forrest from striking into middle Tennessee and destroying the single-track railroad over which Sherman's army drew its supplies. The battles of Brice's Crossroads and Tupelo were fought to protect the Union's military railroad.  Prelude  The Right Wing, 16th Army Corps, commanded by Major-General Andrew J. Smith, advanced into north Mississippi from La Grange, Tennessee, on July 5 without much opposition in two columns until Pontotoc, was closely approached, when his advance was checked by Confederate Brigadier-General James R. Chalmers, Forrest meanwhile making preparations for battle near Okolona. Lee was also with the Confederate forces, and assumed general command. Three attempts to advance were checked by Forrest's men, on various roads, and on July 12 both columns turned off toward Tupelo. Lee then moved with the divisions of Chalmers and Brigadier-General A. Buford to attack Smith's flank, while Forrest with Mabry's Brigade, the escort, and his old regiment, assailed to the rear. A running fight was kept up for ten miles, but without any considerable advantage to either side except a dash made upon the Federal wagon train by Chalmers, with Rucker's Brigade, near Bartram's Shop. He had possession of the wagon train for a time and killed all the mules, so that the Union forces were compelled to abandon and burn seven wagons, a caisson and two ambulances, but superior numbers soon compelled him to retire.

William Campbell  Battle  Battlefield monument On the morning of the 14th, Smith took a strong position at Harrisburg and entrenched. Lee reacted by forming lines with Roddey's Brigade on the right, Mabry's Brigade on the left, and Crossland's Brigade in the middle. Bell's Brigade was put in the front line on Mabry's right. The troops were all dismounted. Both Chalmers' and Buford's divisions were held in reserve. The plan of attack seemed to be swing the right, but Lyon's Brigade became engaged first and was forced to fall back with heavy losses. Chalmers' Division, dismounted, was ordered forward and, after Mabry and Bell had been repulsed, Rucker's Brigade made an equally futile assault. The men were swept away by the fire of a superior and entrenched force, and many fell from exhaustion in the great heat of a July sun. A little after noon the Confederates fell back and entrenched, but were not molested by Union forces, who contented themselves with tearing up the railroad in the vicinity of Tupelo and burning the town of Harrisburg. On the 15th, it appearing Smith would not attack, Buford made a demonstration on his left flank. Soon afterward Smith began his retreat, and a vigorous pursuit was at once begun. At Old Town Creek Buford came up with the Union in line of battle and was driven back in confusion. McCulloch's Brigade was ordered to attack, but being sent in by regiments was speedily repulsed. Here General Forrest and Colonel McCulloch were both severely wounded, and the command of the forces in front devolved upon Chalmers. Though the pursuit was continued, there was but slight skirmishing after this engagement.  Aftermath  Monument to Confederate dead Sherman, who was closing in on Atlanta, was irritated Smith had not pressed Forrest at Tupelo, believing he should not have been allowed to escape. If Forrest had been allowed to raid into middle Tennessee prior to the capture of Atlanta, it could have had disastrous consequences for the Union. Although Smith failed to destroy Forrest's Cavalry at Tupelo, he did break its combat effectiveness. Forrest would rally his cavalrymen for more daring raids, but never again would they be able to fight and defeat infantry. Battlefield preservation The growth of Tupelo and the surrounding area has obscured many of the sites associated with the battle. The battlefield has been partially preserved and is home to the Tupelo National Battlefield, established on February 21, 1929.

An impossible world, w, is the same sort of thing as a possible world (whatever that may be), except that it is in some sense \\"impossible.\\" Depending on the context, this may mean that some contradictions are true at w, that the normal laws of logic or of metaphysics fail to hold at w, or both. Applications=Non-normal modal logics Non-normal worlds were introduced by Saul Kripke in 1965 as a purely technical device to provide semantics for modal logics weaker than the system K ‚Äî in particular, modal logics that reject the rule of necessitation: : \\\\vdash A \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ \\\\vdash \\\\Box A. Such logics are typically referred to as \\"non- normal.\\" Under the standard interpretation of modal vocabulary in Kripke semantics, we have \\\\vdash A if and only if in each model, A holds in all worlds. To construct a model in which A holds in all worlds but \\\\Box A does not, we need either to interpret \\\\Box in a non-standard manner (that is, we do not just consider the truth of A in every accessible world), or we reinterpret the condition for being valid. This latter choice is what Kripke does. We single out a class of worlds as normal, and we take validity to be truth in every normal world in a model. in this way we may construct a model in which A is true in every normal world, but in which \\\\Box A is not. We need only ensure that this world (at which \\\\Box A fails) have an accessible world which is not normal. Here, A can fail, and hence, at our original world, \\\\Box A fails to be necessary, despite being a truth of the logic. These non-normal worlds are impossible in the sense that they are not constrained by what is true according to the logic. From the fact that \\\\vdash A, it does not follow that A holds in a non-normal world. For more discussion of the interpretation of the language of modal logic in models with worlds, see the entries on modal logic and on Kripke semantics. Avoiding Curry's paradox Curry's paradox is a serious problem for logicians who are interested in developing formal languages that are \\"semantically closed\\" (i.e. that can express their own semantics). The paradox relies on the seemingly obvious principle of contraction: :(A \\\\rightarrow (A \\\\rightarrow B)) \\\\rightarrow (A \\\\rightarrow B). There are ways of using non-normal worlds in a semantical system that invalidate contraction. Moreover, these methods can be given a reasonable philosophical justification by construing non-normal worlds as worlds at which \\"the laws of logic fail.\\" Counternecessary statements A counternecessary statement is a counterfactual conditional whose antecedent is not merely false, but necessarily so (or whose consequent is necessarily true). For the sake of argument, assume that either (or both) of the following are the case: :1. Intuitionism is false. :2. The law of excluded middle is true. Presumably each of these statements is such that if it is true (false), then it is necessarily true (false). Thus one (or both) of the following is being assumed: :1‚Ä≤. Intuitionism is false at every possible world. :2‚Ä≤. The law of excluded middle is true at every possible world. Now consider the following: :3. If intuitionism is true, then the law of excluded middle holds. This is intuitively false, as one of the fundamental tenets of intuitionism is precisely that the LEM does not hold. Suppose this statement is cashed out as: :3‚Ä≤. Every possible world at which intuitionism is true is a possible world at which the law of excluded middle holds true. This holds vacuously, given either (1‚Ä≤) or (2‚Ä≤). Now suppose impossible worlds are considered in addition to possible ones. It is compatible with (1‚Ä≤) that there are impossible worlds at which intuitionism is true, and with (2‚Ä≤) that there are impossible worlds at which the LEM is false. This yields the interpretation: : 3*. Every (possible or impossible) world at which intuitionism is true is a (possible or impossible) world at which the law of excluded middle holds. This does not seem to be the case, for intuitively there are impossible worlds at which intuitionism is true and the law of excluded middle does not hold. References * Kripke, Saul. 1965.

He is best known as quarterback of the Toronto Argonauts. The touchdown he engineered in the 1952 Grey Cup turned out to be the last offensive touchdown by the Argonauts in a Grey Cup for 30 years. Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, he excelled in athletics and became the first athlete at Crane Technical High School to letter in 3 sports (football, basketball, and baseball) since George Halas accomplished the feat at the turn of the century. Wirkowski played for two exceptional football coaches while attending Miami University. He started under Sid Gillman, whose ideas revolutionized the passing game in American football, and when Gillman left, Woody Hayes replaced him. Wirkowski led Miami to a 13-12 victory over Texas Tech in the 1948 Sun Bowl and then 3 years later put on a spectacular performance in the Salad Bowl. In that game Nobby completed 18 of 21 pass attempts, leading Miami past Arizona State. While at Miami, Wirkowski became a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. After college, he joined the Toronto Argonauts and took over the quarterbacking spot for Toronto, leading the Argonauts to a 7-5 record in the 1951 season. In 1952, Wirkowski led Toronto to a Grey Cup championship over the Edmonton Eskimos. From 1952 to 1957, Wirkowski coached the senior football team at De La Salle College (Toronto) which won consecutive league championships in 1955, 1956 and 1957. He was traded to Hamilton in 1955 where he played for two years and was then traded to Calgary. At the end of the 1959 season he returned to Toronto as back-up quarterback and assistant coach. The following year Nobby saw his final action as a professional player when he injured his knee in a preseason exhibition game with the NFL St. Louis Cardinals. In 1963, Argonauts General Manager Lew Hayman promoted Wirkowski to the head coaching position after Lou Agase was fired. He served as the Argonauts head coach through the 1964 season, after which he was promoted to Director of Player Personnel. He served in that role through the 1967 season. After the 1967 season Wirkowski was approached by York University. York was looking at starting a football program and needed a coach who could build a team 'from scratch.' He accepted the offer from York and was named Athletic Director and Head football coach and joined the Faculty of Physical Education as a professor. He coached York from 1968‚Äì1975 and from 1988‚Äì89, and was an associate coach for the 1984 and 1987 seasons. He is a member of the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame and the Mississauga Hall of Fame. On October 15, 2014, Wirkowski died with his family at his side at the age of 88.

Sultan (born 1951) is an American painter, sculptor, and printmaker, particularly well-known for large-scale still life paintings and the use of industrial materials such as tar, enamel, spackle and vinyl tiles. He has been exhibiting internationally in prominent museums and galleries, and his works are included in important museum collections all over the globe. Sultan is the recipient of numerous honors and awards for his artistic achievements.  Early life and education  Donald Sultan was born in Asheville, North Carolina in 1951. Both of his parents were interested in the arts. His father was a tire company owner who painted abstract paintings as a hobby, and his mother, Phyllis actively pursued theatre. It was through his mother that Sultan developed an early interest in theatre. \\"I was acting and then I learned how to make theatrical sets and paint them,\\" he recalled, \\"I did apprenticeships in different professional theaters.\\" With his father's encouragement, however, Sultan chose to pursue art professionally, and he earned a BFA degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1973 and an MFA from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1975. While still in school, Sultan grew dissatisfied with traditional methods of painting and began experimenting in technique, surface, and media, which eventually led him to use industrial tools and materials. Work Air Strike April 22, 1987 by Donald Sultan, 1987, Honolulu Museum of Art After receiving an MFA degree from the Art Institute of Chicago, Donald Sultan moved to New York in 1975 to begin his career as an artist. At first he was supporting himself by helping other artists construct lofts during the day and painting at night. He soon got a full-time position as a handyman in an art gallery, a job that lasted until the gallery closed in 1978. In 1979, Sultan won a $2,500 Creative Artists Public Service Grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, and that money enabled him to work full-time on his art. \\"By then I had started to show at a couple of places and to sell enough work to keep going,\\" he said. Donald Sultan rose to prominence in the electrified atmosphere of New York's downtown renaissance in the late 1970s as part of the ‚ÄúNew Image‚Äù movement. His first solo exhibition was mounted in 1977 at Artists Space in New York, followed by group shows at Mary Boone Gallery in 1978 and Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1979. As Sultan's work started to attract media attention and receive critical acclaim, prominent galleries and museums around the world such as the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1981, and the Houston Museum of Contemporary Art also in 1981, began to include his paintings in their exhibitions. In 1987 alone, impressive solo exhibitions were mounted at the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Blum Helman Gallery in New York. Reviewing these exhibitions for The New York Times, art critic Roberta Smith wrote, \\"Mr. Sultan is nothing if not a master of physical density, of the well-built image and the well-carpentered painting. He seems particularly to love the way an implacable slab of material can be made to flip-flop into a classically perfect, illusionistic form...\\" As Studio 54's co-founder Steve Rubell famously observed in 1985, \\"artists [were] becoming the stars of the 1980s, like the rock stars of the 1960s or the fashion designers of the 1970s,\\" and this astute observation fully applied to Sultan. \\"In the late 1980s\\", writes Geraldine Fabricant in The New York Times, \\"Donald Sultan was riding high. He was represented by a prestigious gallery, some of his paintings were selling for more than $100,000 each.\\" These paintings, explains the British art historian and author Ian Dunlop, \\"fall into two groups: the first group consists of bold, brightly colored pictures with well-defined shapes and crisp outlines forming a clear silhouette; the second group consists of dark, hard to read pictures full of menace and often inspired by disastrous industrial events such as warehouse fires, airplane crashes, and freight train derailments. In both cases the pictures make a strong, immediate visual statement.\\" Sultan was one of the first to employ a wide range of industrial tools and materials, particularly tar, in lieu of traditional brushes and paints. \\"Out of industrial materials such as vinyl tile, butyl robber, and spackling plaster Sultan builds pictures that release pleasing vibrations in the mind and the eye,\\" notes Calvin Tomkins in The New Yorker. Sultan's frequent use of tar was influenced by his father's tire business, and his interest in the industrial world came from his formative years at the Art Institute of Chicago. \\"Donald Sultan continues to stretch the technical possibilities of his medium,\\" observes Michael Brenson in The New York Times. \\"His images are fresh and direct in part because he approaches industrial materials as if they were tubes of paint, feeling free to use anything as long as he uses it directly, in the form in which he finds it.\\" In that regard, Sultan said that he \\"felt more comfortable working with the materials.\\" ‚ÄúMy father was a physical person\\", he explained, \\"I just felt most comfortable making things and moving things. Part of the whole American experience I came out of was the empire building mentality ‚Äî physical labor. My grandfather was on the assembly lines of Detroit in the Depression. It was the way it was.‚Äù Sultan's imagery was simultaneously abstract and representational, and as he was exploring the boundary between the abstract and the everyday, he moved from the industrial subjects to the natural world, creating paintings and drawings of fruits and flowers ‚Äì lemons and tulips, pomegranates and poppies. Of these works, art critic Vivien Raynor wrote in The New York Times, \\"Beneath these curmudgeonly surfaces there beats a romantic sensibility that is profoundly stirred by nature.\\" Although Sultan's subject matter varies, his still lifes share formal similarities of volume, texture and richness. He is best known for his lemons and fruit, and states that his subjects develop from previous work. The oval of his lemons has led to a series of oval-blossomed tulips. Dots from dice have become oranges. What does not change is the statement Sultan's images make. His work incorporates basic geometric and organic forms with a visual purity that is both subtle and monumental. His images are weighty, with equal emphasis on both negative and positive areas. Sultan's still lifes are studies in contrast. \\"Most of my ideas were to put imagery back into abstract painting,‚Äù explains Sultan of his artistic inspiration. ‚ÄúSome of the ones that look the most abstract are actually the most realistic.\\" His sensual, fleshy object representations are rendered through a labor-intensive and unique method. Instead of canvas, Sultan works on Masonite covered with 12-inch vinyl floor tiles. \\"He glues linoleum vinyl floor tile to plywood,\\" explains art critic Michael Brenson in The New York Times, \\"then he covers the tile with tar. When it dries, he draws on it. In some places he scrapes the tar away and allows the tile to show through. Elsewhere, he cuts the tar away and fills in sections with plaster. The plaster and tile may or may not be painted. The color often retains the gloss and unnatural lushness of the Polaroid photographs Sultan takes after he decides the still-life arrangement. The results are surprising and hip. The still lifes may not literally contain apples and oranges, but they do mix together very different, seemingly incompatible elements... Positive and negative, charred and pristine, ripeness and decay all nestle together...\\" Sultan's use of industrial materials in this way is striking and innovative, and Vivien Raynor has made this point in The New York Times stating that \\"Donald Sultan is descended from the Process artists of the late 1960s in that he makes art out of materials that are very much a part of contemporary life. Yet even as his coeval, Julian Schnabel, has cornered plates as a medium, Sultan seems to have been the first to work in tar, combining it with spackle and latex on a ground consisting of vinyl tiles attached to Masonite.\\" It is through the use of these industrial materials, as well as through the deconstruction of his subjects into basic forms, that Sultan's paintings are enriching and elevating the still-life tradition. He is exploring the medium further through techniques of gouging, sanding, and buffing to create flatness, depth, gloss, and texture. The paintings are made of the same materials as the building in which the viewer stands; the architecture participates in the paintings. Weighty and structured, they are minimal and expressionist at the same time, while his images contradict their common association with fragility. \\"Sultan pushes the boundaries of painting as he virtually sculpts the painting into pictures that are minimal but opulently rich,\\" notes columnist R. Couri Hay, a former editor of Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine in his 2011 profile of Sultan for the Hamptons Magazine. The process of making these painting, suggests The New York Times, is technically so complex and, consequently, so painstakingly slow, that finishing \\"a single painting can take up to a month, so that Mr. Sultan's annual output is 12 to 18 paintings.\\" The format of Sultan's paintings is almost always dictated by the tiles: one-foot squares, eight-foot squares, or most recently, four and eight-foot squares. Michael Brenson has referred to the smallest ones as \\"cunning little still lifes\\" and suggested that \\"the immediate effect is that of a detail in a Spanish Old Master painting isolated and blown up, or a detail in a fresco that has just been cleaned.\\" The larger compositions, huge pieces of fruit, flowers, dominoes, buttons and other objects, set against the stark, unsettling tar black, eight foot square background, have a different effect and dominate the viewer. Sultan describes these works as \\"heavy structure, holding fragile meaning with the ability to turn you off and turn you on at the same time.\\" Air Strike April 22, 1987 is one of the artist's \\"Disaster Pictures\\" that uses Latex and tar on Vinyl composition tile to convey the horrors of the Sri Lankan Civil War.Honolulu Museum of Art, wall label, Air Strike April 22, 1987 by Donald Sultan, 1987, accession 2017-31-12 In addition to his paintings, Sultan has had success as a draftsman, printmaker and sculptor. As a printmaker, his scope of work includes lithography, serigraphy, wood cut, linocut, and etching. His large size aquatint etchings are particularly complex technically, and many have been exhibited in museums all over the globe, including in May, 2014, at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris. On his graphic work, Sultan was among a small group of influential American artists who frequently collaborated with Picasso's master-printer Aldo Crommelynck.From Picasso to Jasper Johns. Biblioth√®que nationale de France official web site \\"[Sultan's etchings] emulate soft-edge charcoal drawings,' observed Suzanne Muchnic in the Los Angeles Times. \\"To do them, Sultan worked out a method of blowing and brushing resin powder on a printing plate before heating it. For the outsized lemons, he blew through long tubes and blurred edges of shapes with delicate Japanese brushes. The results are wonders of printmaking that retain the surface interest of drawings.\\" As a draftsman, Sultan remains devoted to his imagery of nature. His silhouetted charcoal drawings on paper, as well as his compositions in color conte crayon and flock, often explore the forms of fruits and flowers, resulting in largely monochromatic and prominent images. His flowers float and cluster together, pushing the edges of the paper and creating images that are bold and at times appear erotic and surreal. ‚ÄúI have been using flower imagery for 40 years,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúonly because in the 1970s, I started to see the urban environment as a source for new growth. At the time, no one in my generation was painting flowers; now, of course, everyone is.‚Äù Just like in his paintings, Sultan continues to combine industrial materials in many of his sculptures. His love of nature is manifested in his sculptures in an unexpected way ‚Äì the heavy, multi-ton lead Rain Pots installed in an open space contain rain water and appear fragile, serene and ephemeral. Other materials used by Sultan in his sculptural work include iron, wood, and painted aluminum. Sultan has also produced limited edition artist's books. In 1989, he collaborated with David Mamet on his book Warm and Cold and in 1999, on Bar Mitzvah, a limited edition book for which he created a series of drawings. In 1997, Sultan collaborated with author and artist Michael McKenzie and poet Robert Creeley on the landmark book \\"Dark Poetics\\", a hand silkscreened oversized volume featuring dozens of his paintings. He has subsequently done a book of prints with the Israel-based print publishers Har- el, and done prints in collaboration with the Benefit Print Project supporting such cultural institutions as the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, New York, the Atlantic Center for the Arts in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, and the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts.

Power in Latium At its height, the Albans and the city of Alba Longa exerted great power and influence over Latium. In particular, literary sources such as Pliny the Elder‚Äôs Historia Naturalis state that Alba Longa headed a league of city-states in Latium, possibly called Prisci Latini.Bostock, John, Henry Thomas Riley, ed. The Natural History of Pliny. Vol 3. London, H. G. Bohn: 1855. Most of these sources tend to vary regarding the political structure of the alliance as well as Alba Longa‚Äôs hegemonic role. Many historians say it is uncertain if the Albans exerted any sort of dominance since most of the surviving sources are biased.Ashby, Thomas. \\"Alba Longa.\\" Journal of Philology 27.53 (1899): 37-44. The Prisci Latini are the colonists sent out by the Alban king, Latinus Silvius, who would be made to submit to Roman authority following the destruction of Alba Longa in the mid-7th century BC.Barthold Niebuhr The History of Rome, Volume 1 1871 p.198-199, Dionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities III.34, Livy Ab urbe condita I.3 Those colonists would be a part of 30 villages that would form the populi Albenses which may have been related to the 30 Latin villages of the same time in ancient Latium. Religious customs However, Pliny and others generally agree that the communities of Latium gathered at Alba Longa for sacrificial rites. Every year in the spring, the tribes would congregate on Mons Albanus (Monte Cavo) to worship Iuppiter Latiaris. The festival was known as Feriae Latinae.Walbank, F. W., ed. The Cambridge Ancient History. Vol. 7. Cambridge, Great Britain: Cambridge University Press, 1989 The major custom in this ceremony was a great banquet, which required all attending cities to bring food, especially meat. These offerings were then divided among the attendants and owning some of the food signified membership within the league.Walbank, F. W., ed. The Cambridge Ancient History. Vol. 7. Cambridge, Great Britain: Cambridge University Press, 1989 Pliny lists 30 tribes participating in the Feriae Latinae. This festival continued as an annual event through the imperial age of Rome. There is also evidence that leaders from the surrounding tribes of Latium met at a spring in Alba Longa known as Aqua Ferentia.\\"Alba Longa.\\" A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography. 1873 ed. This supports the theory that the Albans were central figures in Latium. Alba Longa was also known for its wine and good stone quarries. Downfall The prosperity of the Alban people declined in the seventh century BC. Tullus Hostilius waged war against Alba Longa and ultimately devastated the city, sparing only the temples. Historians attribute our lack of archaeological evidence to Tullus Hostilius‚Äô campaign. Indeed, portions of the city wall‚Äôs foundation are all that remain. After this victory, Rome assumed the command that had long been held by the Albans. Many from Alba Longa immigrated to Rome following the war and some of Rome‚Äôs most elite patrician families (including the Julii) trace their heritage back to Alba Longa, which illustrates its importance in the history of Rome.

At the time, the league consisted of six teams known as the Original Six. Topps included all four American teams in this popular 60-card set - Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Red Wings, and New York Rangers. As noted on most packaging, the Topps cards were made and printed in U.S.A. Cards were sold in 5-cent packs and 1-cent packs. As written on select packaging, the series was also made and distributed by O-Pee-Chee Co., Ltd. London, Ontario, Canada under license with Topps Chewing Gum Inc., Brooklyn, N.Y. History Each card in this set measures approximately 2 in. x 3 in., and features a player photo (in a blue and red line background), team logo, team name, position, and a facsimile autograph. As is typical of most trading cards, the back of the card features biographical information, statistics from the 1953‚Äì54 season, and a few notes featuring hockey facts. After this season Topps did not produce a hockey set again for another 2 years until the 1957 set because the NHL went after Topps for not getting their permission to use the team logos in the card photos. Card trading While the set is printed in the United States, a large portion of the actual print run found its way to Canada, as baseball was America's national pastime. As far as the hobby of trading cards is concerned, this set features only three Rookie Cards, including #18 Doug Mohns, #32 Camille Henry, and #35 Don McKenney. The inclusion of a very early Gordie Howe card is one of the main draws of this set, and the card can be seen trading in the $2000 range when in Near Mint condition. A PSA 9 1954 Topps Gordie Howe card sold for $10,000.00 in the early 2000s. Cards #1 and #60 are considered to be condition sensitive for two reasons. The first is their placement on the sheet during printing, and the second reason is due to the \\"rubber band\\" factor. The \\"rubber band\\" factor occurs when a tight rubber band is used to hold a stack of trading cards together, thus damaging the first and last cards in the stack. And in the case of complete sets, this would be cards #1 and #60. A PSA 8 Milt Schmidt #60 sold on eBay in 2005 for $6,000.00. Another condition sensitive challenge in this set are gum stains. Topps included a stick of bubble gum in every pack a collector would purchase. Two kinds of packs were distributed: Penny packs and nickel packs. Penny packs included only one card increasing the chance greatly of an unsightly gum stain tainting that card.

Its Preamble states \\"The World Conference on Human Rights, Considering that the promotion and protection of human rights is a matter of priority for the international community, and that the Conference affords a unique opportunity to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the international human rights system and of the machinery for the protection of human rights, in order to enhance and thus promote a fuller observance of those rights, in a just and balanced manner.\\" The Preamble also states: \\"Invoking the spirit of our age and the realities of our time which call upon the peoples of the world and all States Members of the United Nations to rededicate themselves to the global task of promoting and protecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms so as to secure full and universal enjoyment of these rights ...\\" Looking back The VDPA reflects the fact that the World Conference on Human Rights marked a turning point for human rights, as the Cold War had ended. The VDPA looks back, with the Preamble stating: Human rights as relevant universal standard The VDPA seeks to reaffirm human rights as universal and relevant standard. The Preamble states: \\"Emphasizing that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which constitutes a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, is the source of inspiration and has been the basis for the United Nations in making advances in standard setting as contained in the existing international human rights instruments, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\\" The VDPA urges Governments, United Nations, and other international organizations to increase the resources allocated to programmes to strengthen human rights awareness through training, teaching and education, popular participation and civil society (para. 34). Human rights as indivisible, interdependent and interrelated The VDPA emphasizes that all human rights are of equal importance, seeking to end the qualitative division between civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, which was pronounced during the Cold War era. Part I, para 5 states that \\"All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis. While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\" This phrase is also cited by the Declaration of MontrealDeclaration of Montreal Section 2, \\"Global Issue\\" as well as The Yogyakarta PrinciplesThe Yogyakarta Principles Principle 1, (a) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Preamble, (c) To this end, Part II, para 75 also encourages the Commission on Human Rights, in accordance with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to continue the examination of Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on equal basis of the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Democracy, development and human rights against terrorism The VDPA also draws a direct connection between respect for human rights, democracy and international development, stating in Part I, para 8: \\"8. Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives. In the context of the above, the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels should be universal and conducted without conditions attached. The international community should support the strengthening and promoting of democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the entire world.\\" In Part I, para 17: \\"The act, methods and practices of terrorism in all its form\\" as well as drug trafficking \\"are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedom and democracy\\" and that \\"the international community should take necessary steps to enhance cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism\\". Poverty and social exclusion The VDPA makes a direct link between poverty and the realisation of human rights. Part I, para 14 states: \\"The existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective enjoyment of human rights; its immediate alleviation and eventual elimination must remain a high priority for the international community.\\" The VDPA stops short of declaring poverty a human rights violation in itself, but states in Part I, para 25 that: \\"25. The World Conference on Human Rights affirms that extreme poverty and social exclusion constitute a violation of human dignity and that urgent steps are necessary to achieve better knowledge of extreme poverty and its causes, including those related to the problem of development, in order to promote the human rights of the poorest, and to put an end to extreme poverty and social exclusion and to promote the enjoyment of the fruits of social progress. It is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the decision making process by the community in which they live, the promotion of human rights and efforts to combat extreme poverty.\\" Right to development The VDPA reaffirms the right to development, which is regarded as controversial by some human rights scholars and UN member states. Part I, para 9 reaffirms that least developed countries committed to the process of democratization and economic reforms, many of which are in Africa, should be supported by the international community in order to succeed in their transition to democracy and economic development. And Part I, para 10 states: \\"The World Conference on Human Rights reaffirms the right to development, as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development, as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights. As stated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, the human person is the central subject of development. While development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights. States should cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development. The international community should promote an effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development. Lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level.\\" Part I, para 11 goes on to state: \\"The right to development should be fulfilled so as to meet equitably the developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations. The World Conference on Human Rights recognizes that illicit dumping of toxic and dangerous substances and waste potentially constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life and health of everyone. Consequently, the World Conference on Human Rights calls on all States to adopt and vigorously implement existing conventions relating to the dumping of toxic and dangerous products and waste and to cooperate in the prevention of illicit dumping. Everyone has the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications. The World Conference on Human Rights notes that certain advances, notably in the biomedical and life sciences as well as in information technology, may have potentially adverse consequences for the integrity, dignity and human rights of the individual, and calls for international cooperation to ensure that human rights and dignity are fully respected in this area of universal concern.\\" Right to seek asylum and humanitarian aid In Part I, para 23, the VDPA reaffirms that everyone, without distinction of any kind, is entitled to the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution, as well as the right to return to one's own country. In this respect it stresses the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, its 1967 Protocol and regional instruments. It expresses its appreciation to States that continue to admit and host large numbers of refugees in their territories, and to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for its dedication to its task. It also expresses its appreciation to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The VDPA recognises that, in view of the complexities of the global refugee crisis and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, relevant international instruments and international solidarity and in the spirit of burden-sharing, a comprehensive approach by the international community is needed in coordination and cooperation with the countries concerned and relevant organisations, bearing in mind the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. This should include the development of strategies to address the root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons, the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms, the provision of effective protection and assistance, bearing in mind the special needs of women and children, as well as the achievement of durable solutions, primarily through the preferred solution of dignified and safe voluntary repatriations, including solutions such as those adopted by the international refugee conferences. And underlines the responsibilities of States, particularly as they relate to the countries of origin. Regarding disasters, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of humanitarian law, VDPA emphasizes the importance of and the need for humanitarian aid to victims of all natural disaster and man-made disaster. Against racism, xenophobia and intolerance In Part II, para 20, the VDPA urges all governments to take immediate measure and to develop strong policies to prevent and combat all forms and manifestations of racism, xenophobia or related intolerance, where necessary by enactment of appropriate legislation, including penal measure. And also appeals to all States parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination to consider making the declaration under article 14 of the convention. Persons belonging to minority groups In Part II, para 25, the VDPA calls on the Commission on Human Rights to examine ways and means to promote and protect effectively the rights of persons belonging to minorities as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. In this context, VDPA calls upon the Centre for Human Rights to provide, at the request of Governments concerned and as part of its programme of advisory services and technical assistance, qualified expertise on minority issues and human rights, as well as on the prevention and resolution of disputes, to assist in existing or potential situations involving minorities. At para 26, the VDPA urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities in accordance with the Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. Further at para 95, VDPA underlines the importance of preserving and strengthening the system of special procedures, rapporteurs, representatives, experts and working groups of the Commission on Human Rights and the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, in order to enable them to carry out their mandates in all countries throughout the world, providing them with the necessary human and financial resources. The procedures and mechanisms should be enabled to harmonize and rationalize their work through periodic meeting. All States are asked to cooperate fully with these procedures and mechanisms. Indigenous peoples In Part II, para 29, the VDPA recommends that the Commission on Human Rights consider the renewal and updating of the mandate of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations upon complement of the drafting of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Further at para 32, it recommends that the General Assembly proclaim an international decade of the world's indigenous people, to begin from January 1994, including action oriented programmes, to be decided upon in partnership with indigenous people. An appropriate voluntary trust fund should be set up for this purpose. In the framework of such a decade, the establishment of a permanent forum for indigenous peoples in the United Nations system should be considered. Rights of migrant workers In Part II, para 34, the VDPA invites States to consider the possibility of signing and ratifying on the earliest possible time, the United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Women's rights and domestic violence The VDPA draws attention to the importance of women's rights and the rights of the \\"girl-child\\", Part I, para 18 stating: \\"The human rights of women and of the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. The full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life, at the national, regional and international levels, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community.\\" The VDPA also explicitly recognises gender-based violence, sexual harassment and exploitation, with Part I, para 18 going on to state: \\"Gender- based violence and all forms of sexual harassment and exploitation, including those resulting from cultural prejudice and international trafficking, are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person, and must be eliminated. This can be achieved by legal measures and through national action and international cooperation in such fields as economic and social development, education, safe maternity and health care, and social support.\\" The VDPA concludes by proclaiming women's rights and gender-based exploitation as legitimate issues for the international community. Part I, para 19 concluding that: \\"The human rights of women should form an integral part of the United Nations human rights activities, including the promotion of all human rights instruments relating to women. The World Conference on Human Rights urges Governments, institutions, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts for the protection and promotion of human rights of women and the girl-child.\\" The VDPA, at Part II, para 38, also calls upon the General Assembly to adopt the draft Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women and urges States to combat violence against women in accordance with its provisions, and that \\"violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law. All violations of this kind, including in particular murder, systematic rape, sexual slavery, and forced pregnancy, require a particular effective response.\\" Rights of the child In Part II, para 45, the VDPA reiterates the principle of \\"First Call for Children\\" and, in this respect, underlines the importance of major national and international efforts, especially those of the United Nations Children's Fund, for promoting respect for the rights of the child to survival, protection, development and participation. At para 46, VDPA affirms that measures should be taken to achieve universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by 1995 and the universal signing of the \\"World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and Plan of Action\\" adopted by the World Summit for Children. At para 47, the VDPA urges all nations to undertake measures to the maximum extent of their available resources, with the support of international cooperation, to achieve the goals in the World Summit Plan of Action, and calls on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into their national action plans. By means of those national action plans and through international efforts, particular priority should be places on reducing infant mortality and maternal mortality rates, reducing malnutrition and illiteracy rates and providing access to safe drinking water and to basic education. Whenever so called for, national plans of action should be devised to combat devastating emergencies resulting from natural disasters and armed conflicts and the equally grave problem of children in extreme poverty. At para 48, the VDPA urges all States, to address the acute program of children under difficult circumstance. Exploitation and abuse of children should be actively combated, including by addressing their root causes. Effective measure are required against female infanticide, harmful child labour, sale of children and organ, child prostitution, child pornography, as well as other forms of sexual abuse. At para 50, the VDPA strongly supports the proposal that the Secretary General initiate a study into means of improving the protection of children in armed conflicts, and that humanitarian norms should be implemented and measures taken in order to protect and facilitate assistance to children in war zone. Measures should include protection for children against indiscriminate use of all weapon of war, especially anti-personnel mines. The need for aftercare and rehabilitation of children traumatized by war must be addressed urgently. Freedom from torture In Part II, para 54, the VDAP welcomes the ratification by many Member States of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and at para 61, also reaffirm that effort to eradicate torture should, first and foremost, be concentrated on prevention and, therefore, calls for early adoption of an Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, which is intended to establish a preventive system of regular visits to places of detention. Enforced disappearances In Part II, para 62, the VDAP welcoming the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, calls upon all States to take effective legislative, administrative, judicial on other measure to prevent, terminate and punish acts of enforced disappearance. This is the origin of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Rights of the disabled person In Part II, para 63, the VDAP reaffirms that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal and thus unreservedly include persons with disabilities. Every person is born equal and has the same rights to life and welfare, education and work, living independently and active participation in all aspects of society. Any direct discrimination or other negative discriminatory treatment of a disabled person is therefore a violation of his or her rights. At para 64, the VDAP affirms that the place of disabled person is everywhere. Persons with disabilities should be guaranteed equal opportunity through the elimination of all socially determined barriers, be they physical, financial, social or psychological, which exclude or restrict full participation in society. Human rights, the responsibility of the State Part I, para 1 of the VDPA starts: \\"The World Conference on Human Rights reaffirms the solemn commitment of all States to fulfill their obligations to promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other instruments relating to human rights, and international law. The universal nature of these rights and freedoms is beyond question.\\" The VDPA acknowledges that international cooperation to realise human rights is vital, Part I, para 1 going on to state: \\"In this framework, enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of the United Nations.\\" However, the VDPA firmly places the ultimate responsibility for realizing human rights with the State, or the respective governments, Part I, para 1 concluding that: \\"Human rights and fundamental freedoms are the birthright of all human beings; their protection and promotion is the first responsibility of Governments.\\" Recognising the rising importance of NGOs, the VDPA states in Part I, para 13: \\"There is a need for States and international organizations, in cooperation with non-governmental organizations, to create favourable conditions at the national, regional and international levels to ensure the full and effective enjoyment of human rights. States should eliminate all violations of human rights and their causes, as well as obstacles to the enjoyment of these rights.\\" On ratification of international treaties on human rights, the VDPA states in Part I, para 26 that it \\"welcomes the progress made in the codification of human rights instruments, which is a dynamic and evolving process, and urges the universal ratification of human rights treaties. All States are encouraged to accede to these international instruments; all States are encouraged to avoid, as far as possible, the resort to reservations.\\" On remedy and redress of human rights violation, VDPA states in Part I, para 27 that \\"Every State should provide an effective framework of remedies and redress human rights grievances or violations. The administration of justice, including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and, especially, an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments, are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to the processes of democracy and sustainable development.\\" Human rights education In Part II, para 78, the VDPA considers human rights education, training and public information essential for the promotion and achievement of stable and harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding, tolerance and peace. At para 79 it states that States should strive to eradicate illiteracy and should direct education towards the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The VDPA calls on all States and institutions to include international human rights law, international humanitarian law, democracy and rule of law as subjects in the curricula of all learning institutions in formal and non-formal settings, and, at para 80, that human rights education should include peace, democracy, development and social justice, as set forth in international and regional human rights instruments, in order to achieve common understanding and awareness with a view to strengthening universal commitment to human rights. Further at para 81, the VDPA states that taking into account the World Plan of Action on Education for Human Rights and Democracy, adopted in March 1993 by the International Congress on Education for Human Rights and Democracy of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and other human rights instruments, the VDPA recommends that States develop specific programs and strategies for ensuring the widest human rights education and the dissemination of public information, taking particular account of the human rights needs of women. Implementation and monitoring methods In Part II, para 83, the VDPA urges Governments to incorporate standard as contained in international human rights instruments in domestic legislation and to strengthen national structures, institutions and organs of society which play a role in protecting and safeguarding human rights. Para 84 recommends the strengthening of United Nations activities and programmes to meet requests for assistance by States which want to establish or strengthen their own national human rights institutions for promotion and protection of human rights. At Part II, para 92, the VDPA recommends that the Commission on Human Rights examine the possibility for better implementation of existing human rights instruments at the international and regional levels and encourages the International Law Commission to continue its work on an International Criminal Court. Para 93 appeals to states which have not yet done so that accede to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Protocols thereto, and to take all appropriate national measures, including legislative ones, for their full implementation. Para 96 recommends that the United Nations assume a more active role in the promotion and protection of human rights in ensuring full respect for international humanitarian law in all situations of armed conflict, in accordance with the purposes and principles of Charter of the United Nations. At para 97, the VDPA, recognizing the important role of human rights components in specific arrangements concerning some Peacekeeping Operations by United Nations, recommends that the Secretary-General take into account the reporting, experience and capabilities of the Centre for Human Rights and human rights mechanisms, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.  Follow-up  Part II, para 99 The World Conference on Human Rights on Human Rights recommends that the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and other organs and agencies of the United Nations system related to human rights consider ways and means for the full implementation, without delay, of the recommendations contained in the present Declaration, including the possibility of proclaiming a United Nations decade for human rights. The World Conference on Human Rights further recommends that the Commission on Human Rights annually review the progress towards this end. Para 100:The World Conference on Human Rights requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to invite on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights all States, all organs and agencies of the United Nations system related to human rights, to report to him on the progress made in the implementation of the present Declaration and to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, through the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council. Likewise, regional and, as appropriate, national human rights institutions, as well as non-governmental may present their views to the Secretary-General on the progress made in the implementation of the present Declaration. Special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations system. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights The VDPA considered the adaptation and strengthening of the United Nations machinery for human rights, including the question of the establishment of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Part II, para 17 states that \\"The World Conference on Human Rights recognizes the necessity for a continuing adaptation of the United Nations human rights machinery to the current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights, as reflected in the present Declaration... In particular, the United Nations human rights organs should improve their coordination, efficiency and effectiveness.\\" Following this the VDPA states, Part II, para 18, that \\"The World Conference on Human Rights recommends to the General Assembly that when examining the report of the Conference at its forty-eighth session, it begin, as a matter of priority, consideration of the question of the establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights for the promotion and protection of all human rights.\\" The United Nations General Assembly subsequently created the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 20 December 1993 (resolution 48/141).  Country Action Plans  The World Conference on Human Rights recommended that each State consider the desirability of drawing up a national action plan identifying steps whereby that State would improve the promotion and protection of human rights. VDPA, Part II, paragraph 71. To such ends, the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights has included field offices and technical expertise to its mission. Further, the United Nations Development Programme has identified promotion of national institutions as one of its primary concerns. United Nations Human Rights Council The United Nations Human Rights Council holds regular debates (under its agenda item 8) on follow-up to the VDPA. While the scope of issues that can be addressed under this heading was initially disputed, recent sessions of the Human Rights Council have shown increasing debate on systematic follow-up to the VDPA, with States and non-governmental organizations raising a broad range of issues, reflecting the universal scope of the VDPA. This included themes like gender equality, sexual orientation and gender identity and institutional issues such as the independence of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).http://www.ishr.ch/document-stuff/browse- documents/doc_download/1046-joint-ngo-statement-on-follow-up-and- implementation-of-the-vienna-declaration-under-item-8 In September 2012, the Human Rights Council decided to hold a panel debate, in March 2013, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the VDPA.

Recorded in New York City in December 1994 during studio sessions with Tim Foljahn and Steve Shelley (which also produced the material on her second album, Myra Lee, released one year later), the album displays Marshall's sparse guitar playing and early lo-fi influence. The album had originally been conceived as an EP, and features covers of songs by Tom Waits and This Kind of Punishment. The album was reissued by Plain Recordings in 2001 on CD and vinyl, with an alternate recording of the song \\"Great Expectations\\" as the eighth track. Recording and production Marshall recorded Dear Sir in December 1994 in a small basement studio near Mott Street in New York City at the same time she recorded Myra Lee (1996), which was released nearly two years later, with guitarist Tim Foljahn and Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley; Marshall and Shelley had initially met after she played a show opening for Liz Phair in 1993. A total of 20 songs were recorded in a single day by the trio, all of which were split into two records, making up Dear Sir and Myra Lee. According to Foljahn, the recording session was \\"mellow\\" and \\"quick,\\" and he referred to their recording space‚Äî purportedly a moist basement lined with musical equipment and empty beer cans‚Äî as \\"literally the third subbasement. It was so New York.\\" Contrarily, Marshall described the recording session as \\"anxiety-ridden.\\" \\"Most of the time Steve and Tim ended up looking at each other like, \\"What do we do\\"?\\" said Marshall. \\"I wasn't sure what to tell them since I had never really written songs with a band in mind.\\" Although Dear Sir is considered Marshall's debut album, she said in a 1996 interview that she considered it an EP. Artwork The cover artwork for the album features a man's torso with apparent stream of consciousness prose superimposed over it. The text reads: > dear CAT POWER sir i have heaviness with a dr. molkner sir it's rabbit stew > with you it's you it's you sir we've got the rabbit stew this time ‚Äì and i'm > in you i'm in you sir with a heavy line a very fine line indeed mr. wolfe > it's heavy ‚Äì stew it's heavy stroot like it it's god i would like you to > meet and marry and have many smaller ones with my cousin pete you're a lot > alike believe it about mr. warner tell him to change the stuff fuck this > shit i'm hit that's bobby clayton for ya that's bobby please come to dinner > some nite with molkner we're having rabbit stew call pete say hello and eat > him then put him into a rabbit with bobby molkner and eat him raw with dr. > molkner dr. molkner's no joke ‚Äì he's heavy like me we've got heaviness with > a doctor it's doctortorial molk's no joke love you sissy ass candy person > CAT POWER sir -- According to Marshall, the text came from a letter given to her friend by a mentally ill elderly man who lived in the same hotel as she did: > \\"My friend Jennifer used to live in the hotel and there was this old man and > I guess he was crazy and nobody wanted to say hello to him and she would > always say hello to him and you know, kind of took a liking to him. One day, > she saw him being taken away by the proverbial white coat, as one might say. > He was really sad and reached into his pocket and gave her the note before > they took him away. It was three rectangular pieces of paper taped together > that were very dated, and the paper was very dated, disintegrating...\\" Marshall said that she added in her band name, Cat Power, but the rest of the text was lifted entirely from the letter. \\"It said everything that was there. It may have been in Savannah, actually. It's sort of in memory of him. Like, where is he now? If that was written to him, then does that mean that he was gay?\\" Release Dear Sir was released in October 1995 on Runt Records, an independent Italian label. This release featured a total of only eight tracks. On July 3, 2001, Plain Recordings reissued the album with the additional track \\"Great Expectations\\", giving the album a total of nine tracks (note that another version of the song \\"Great Expectations\\" is also featured on Cat Power's second album, Myra Lee). Both versions of Dear Sir end with the song \\"Headlights\\", which is a re-recording of an early song by Marshall's first backing band, and had previously been released as a 7\\" single in 1993. As of 1999, the album has sold around 10,000 copies. Reception Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone awarded the album three out of five stars. Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote that the album \\"spotlights Chan Marshall's demanding but rewarding songwriting. Her distinctive blend of blues, country, folk and punk creates songs like the dark, noisy \\"Itchyhead\\" and \\"Rockets,\\" which mixes tension and hope, and tops it with Marshall's earnest, expressive vocals.\\" Writing for Treble magazine, Jeff Terich described the album as having a \\"a bluesy, melancholy approach that comes wrapped up in a lot of soul and a lot of tears. Aesthetically, though, Dear Sir is mostly a low-key, lo-fi indie rock album that displays Chan Marshall‚Äôs songwriting at its rawest.\\" Track listingPersonnel *Chan Marshall ‚Äì vocals, guitar *Tim Foljahn ‚Äì guitar *Steve Shelley ‚Äì drums, percussion *Ed Douglas ‚Äì recording, mixing ReferencesSources * External links *Matador Records Interview of Cat Power Category:1995 debut albums Category:Cat Power albums ","title":"Dear Sir"},{"id":"3792803","text":"Lucka is a town in the Thuringian landkreis of Altenburger Land.

According to Australian music journalist Ed Nimmervoll, Camilleri was sacked for sounding too much like Mick Jagger and upstaging other band members. After Adderley Smith, Camilleri was a member of various bands, including The Pelaco Brothers during 1974‚Äì1975. Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons: 1975‚Äì1983, 2001‚Äì2003, 2011‚Äìpresent Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons formed in 1975 and Camilleri gained national prominence as the group's lead singer, co-songwriter and saxophonist. Other members (from 1976 on) included Jeff Burstin (guitar, vocals), John Power (bass guitar, vocals), Gary Young (drums), Tony Faehse (guitar, vocals) and Wilbur Wilde on sax. Incorporating influences from blues, R&B;, soul, punk rock, new wave and reggae, the group achieved considerable commercial and critical success in Australia. Hit singles for Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons included \\"Shape I'm In\\" and \\"Puppet on a String\\"; their highest charting single was \\"Hit & Run\\" from June 1979 which peaked at No. 12. In 1981, most of The Falcons left the group, and the act's name was shortened to Jo Jo Zep. \\"Taxi Mary\\", credited to Jo Jo Zep, peaked at No. 11 in September 1982. The Jo Jo Zep ensemble became unwieldy with, at its peak, a roster of 11 members and disbanded in 1983. The classic 1976‚Äì1981 group reformed in 2001 for a one-off gig, but stayed together to release an album of new material, Ricochet, in 2003. As a member of Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons, Camilleri was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2007. The group continues to tour and play live dates. The Black Sorrows: 1984‚Äìcurrent After the demise of Jo Jo Zep & the Falcons in 1983, Camilleri achieved his greatest success with another long-running group The Black Sorrows, which began in 1984 as an informal semi-acoustic band playing blues, R&B; and zydeco. The Black Sorrows had a shifting line-up and at various points included three ex-Falcons: Jeff Burstin, Wayne Burt, and Gary Young. Later additions to the band included sisters Vika and Linda Bull on vocals, and backing vocalist and lyricist Nick Smith. Camilleri himself has been the only constant member of the group. The Black Sorrows developed a strong fan following and garnered wide critical acclaim for their recordings and superb live performances. After starting life as an acoustic cover band, they evolved into a full electric ensemble that wrote their own material, releasing a string of commercially successful and critically acclaimed albums in the 1980s and 1990s. These albums included A Place in the World, Dear Children (an Australian Top 20 album in 1987), Hold On to Me (peaked at No. 7, 1988), Harley & Rose (peaked at No. 3, 1990), Better Times (peaked at No. 13, 1992) and compilation The Chosen Ones ‚Äì Greatest Hits (peaked at No. 4, 1993). Top 30 hit singles by the band were \\"Chained to the Wheel\\" (which peaked at No. 9 in 1989), \\"Harley + Rose\\" (1990) \\"Never Let Me Go\\" (1990), and \\"Snake Skin Shoes\\" (1994). For the first several years the band was in existence, Camilleri performed under the pseudonym \\"Joey Vincent\\" (a name he had previously used for a solo single), although he wrote and produced material for the group using his real name. The \\"Joey Vincent\\" persona was finally dropped in time for the release of 1990's Harley & Rose. With a number of different line-ups, the band has continued to release material through the 1990s and 2000s. Their most recent releases include the ARIA Nominated Endless Sleep Chapter 46 and 47 in 2015 and Faithful Satellite in 2016. Other projectsThe Revelators= While with The Black Sorrows, Camilleri also performed with The Revelators. The Revelators returned to the Black Sorrows roots of playing mostly covers of country/R&B; style music, and had virtually the same line-up as The Black Sorrows. They released their first album in 1991 called Amazing Stories and followed it up with two others, The Adventures of The Amazing Revelators (2000) and The Revelators (2002). The Revelators were active as a live group from circa 1989 through about 2004. =Bakelite Radio= Bakelite Radio was another side project from the early 2000s. This particular group focussed on more acoustically- oriented music, though still in a country/R&B; mould. The repertoire consisted mostly (but not exclusively) of cover songs, and the line-up‚Äîas is characteristic of Camilleri's bands‚Äîwas fairly fluid. The group released four albums between 2003 and 2009: in order of release, they were Bakelite Radio Volume II (2003), Bakelite Radio Volume III (2004) Bakelite Radio Volume IV (2007), and Bakelite Radio Volume I (2009). As a live act, Bakelite Radio was active from 2001 to 2007. After a long hiatus, the group (with a largely modified line-up, save Camilleri) returned in 2020, issuing their fifth album Rosary of Tears as a combined vinyl and CD package. =Camilleri/Bomba= Limestone, released in 2005, was a collaboration between Camilleri and Bomba's Nicky Bomba. =The Voodoo Sheiks= The Voodoo Sheiks are a ten-piece ensemble led by Camilleri and John McAll that celebrates the musical heritage of New Orleans. The band features a large brass section, and a repertoire of cover songs. They started playing gigs circa 2011, and for a time supplanted Camilleri's previous side projects The Revelators and Bakelite Radio. The Voodoo Sheiks have yet to record under their own name, although one track on The Black Sorrows' 2014 album Certified Blue is called \\"The Return Of The Voodoo Sheiks\\" and was played by the then-current Voodoo Sheiks line-up. The Voodoo Sheiks horns include Julien Wilson, Tim Wilson, Greg Clarkson on saxophone, James Mustafa and Travis Woods on trumpet and Ben Gillespie on trombone. =Here Comes The Night= Here Comes The Night is a Van Morrison tribute project, spearheaded by Camilleri in association with Vince Jones and Vika Bull. Beginning in 2013, the group has performed several live shows throughout Australia.http://www.broadwayworld.com/australia- melbourne/article/Joe-Camilleri-Vince-Jones-and-Vika-Bull-to-Bring-HERE-COMES- THE-NIGHT-to-the-Palais-Nov-29-20130804 Solo releases Camilleri has only infrequently released material with solo billing. A 1980 single credited to \\"Joey Vincent\\" was his first solo project; two additional singles from the 1980s and a 1995 Maxi single called \\"All Saint's Hotel\\" are his only other solo releases of original material. (Note that a few CD 'best-of' releases, which compile material by Jo Jo Zep, The Black Sorrows and Joe's other bands, are credited to Joe Camilleri.)

He can also be heard as a session musician and/or vocalist on recordings by dozens of Australian recording acts, including Skyhooks, Tim Finn, Icehouse and Mondo Rock.

The movie details the exploits and personal battles of United States Marine Corps aviators during World War II. Marines have long had the nickname \\"leatherneck\\", hence the title. Plot Major Dan Kirby (John Wayne) arrives at VMF-247 (\\"Wildcats\\") as the new commander when everybody in the unit was expecting Captain Carl \\"Grif\\" Griffin (Robert Ryan) to take over. Kirby is strict and makes this understood from day one. Assigned to the Cactus Air Force during the Guadalcanal campaign, Kirby has few planes available and a lot to accomplish with a field attacked daily by the Japanese. His pilots are young and behave like \\"kids\\", sometimes disobeying orders and foolishly losing precious pilots and precious planes. Kirby is requiring maximum effort, and Captain Griffin is not as tough as Kirby wants. Griffin stays closer to his young pilots, one of them his own brother-in-law, Vern \\"Cowboy\\" Blithe (Don Taylor). Kirby for his part hates the decisions he has to make, knowing that he is sending pilots to their death, but the success of his missions is the most important thing to him. He keeps this secret from the rest of his squadron. The hard conditions of the war force Kirby to get even stricter with his exhausted pilots. He even refuses sick leave to men with malaria or to allow planes with problems to return to base. Tension between Griffin and Kirby soon peaks. Griffin recognizes the hardships Kirby faces, but he is often more driven by his sentimental side. Kirby is a fan of low-level ground attacks to support the Marine units, but HQ does not approve of his tactics until Marines are dangerously imperiled by the Japanese. Kirby then adjusts squadron tactics, despite losing a number of pilots while trying to prove his point. In his most successful operation, he leads his squadron in an attack on a huge Japanese convoy ‚Äì a scene likely based on the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Promoted to Lt. Colonel, Kirby is given the chance to organize low-level attack tactics in the US. Kirby then returns to the front, to the same unit and aircrew, now equipped with F4U Corsair fighters. Kirby leads his men against Japanese troops and Kamikaze attacks during the Battle of Okinawa. During a crucial moment in the battle, to avoid splitting his formation, Griffin denies assistance to his brother-in-law Blithe, and as a result Blithe is killed. Kirby is shot down and injured but is picked up by a Navy launch. Since he is now to leave the squadron, he has to appoint a successor. He appoints Griffin CO of VMF-247, as he understands that Griffin now can place the lives of his pilots second. They split with a friendly promise to meet again. Kirby admits that every moment in which he is required to make a decision is a nightmare, but that comes with the territory of being a leader under these circumstances. Throughout the film, MSgt. Clancy (Jay C. Flippen), an old Marine veteran and comrade-in-arms of Kirby, provides comic relief. To the consternation of other units on the island, Clancy uses unorthodox creative methods to obtain provisions for his unit. His improvising helps the poorly equipped VMF-247, but at the end of the film, Clancy loses some stripes. Cast As listed in imdb:\\"Flying Leathernecks (1951) ‚Äì full credits.\\" IMDb.

Production Director Nicholas Ray chose Robert Ryan to play opposite John Wayne because Ryan had been a boxer in college and was the only actor Ray could think of who could \\"kick Wayne's ass\\". The role of the more \\"human\\" Captain Griffin is a fictional one and contrasts with the more austere Major Kirby. Tim Holt was originally announced as part of the cast. As indicated in the opening scene of the film, Howard Hughes, himself a pilot with interests in aviation, bankrolled the production. Hughes made the decision to film in Technicolor, making use of color wartime combat footage.. Principal photography began in November 1950 at Camp Pendelton and El Toro Marine Corps bases and then moved to RKO-Path√© Studios in February 1951 for sound stage sequences.\\"Original Print Information: Flying Leathernecks.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: June 8, 2013.Carlson 2012, p. 183. The fighter aircraft appearing in the first part of the film are not the historically accurate Grumman F4F Wildcats but Grumman F6F Hellcats, provided from the training units based at the nearby Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. The Wildcats did not continue in U.S. service after the war, while an appreciable number of Hellcats were available in 1951, the year the film was produced. Hellcats painted white were used as Zero fighters. The Vought F4U Corsair was also featured prominently in the last half of the film.Orriss 1984, p. 159. During filming, a near disaster occurred when \\"Air Boss\\" Paul Mantz and his photo crew, while filming a low- altitude attack, were caught in a premature dynamite detonation. The B-25 camera platform was badly damaged, but Mantz managed to successfully carry out an emergency landing. Historic references The role of Major Kirby portrayed in this film was inspired by real World War II flying ace Maj. John L. Smith for his missions over Guadalcanal in 1942. His actions in the war were renowned by the time the film was made. John L. Smith was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1943 and later promoted to Lt. Colonel, as was Kirby in the film. A distinct similarity in appearance between Smith and actor John Wayne was noted. Reception Flying Leathernecks was critically received as another example of wartime aerial heroics. Howard Thompson in The New York Times commented that \\"As long as it stays in the air, Flying Leathernecks is an exciting thing to watch.\\"Orriss 1984, p. 160. Variety had a similar review, noting: \\"Actual color footage of battle action in the Pacific has been smartly blended with studio shots to strike a note of realism.\\"\\"Review: 'Flying Leathernecks'.\\" Variety, December 31, 1950.

He went to the desert of Scetes and became a monk in the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great. He devoted himself to worship and spiritual struggle. He instructed himself by reading the Holy Scriptures, their interpretation and by contemplating on its meaning. He grew in virtues and was ordained a priest.

They assembled in the church with the elders of Scetes. They remained there for many days, searching and scouting for who would be best for this position. Finally they unanimously agreed to choose this father for what was known of his good character and excellent attributes. They took him and bound him against his will, and he cried out and begged them with excuses to release him saying, \\"I am not fit to be raised to the dignity of the Papacy.\\" They brought him bound to the city of Alexandria and ordained him Patriarch. The deed of his appointment was read in The Church of the Holy Virgin in the Greek, Coptic, and Arabic languages. During his papacy, he added to his worship and piety. He taught and preached the people daily. He gave alms and did works of mercy to the poor and needy. During his papacy he never asked for any of the Church's money, but rather, he used to give a large portion of the contributions which he received to be spent on different righteous deeds.

The club currently plays in the 3. Liga, the third highest level in the German football league system. For many years, Halle had been in East Germany's highest league, the DDR-Oberliga, up-until the German reunification. However, like many other teams from the former East, it then suffered the effects of economic and demographic decline in the region in the 1990s and fell down to amateur leagues. Since 2000, Hallescher FC has ended its downward trend and in the 2011‚Äì2012 season, they finally returned to a professional football league after 20 years of absence. History Logo of Wacker Halle The origins of the club can be traced back to Hallescher Fussball-Club Wacker 1900, founded in 1900 and generally referred to as Wacker Halle, which won the Saale district ‚Äì named after the river Saale ‚Äì of the Central German championship twelve times between 1910 and its last edition 1933. These are all to be considered championships of one of numerous German first divisions. Main rivals here were Hallescher FC and to a lesser extent Borussia Halle, Sportfreunde Halle and SV Halle 98. Those title qualified for participation in the Central German Championships which Wacker won 1921 and 1928. In the ensuing play-off matches for the German Championship Wacker reached the semi- finals in 1921, there losing at home in front of a crowd of 12,000 1‚Äì5 to the later winners 1. FC N√ºrnberg. In 1928 10,000 saw a 0‚Äì3 quarterfinal exit versus FC Bayern Munich. In 1933‚Äì34 Wacker became first champions of the newly incepted central German division of the Gauliga. In the qualification group for the semi-finals of the national championship Wacker came with one win and five defeats last behind 1. FC N√ºrnberg, Dresdner SC and Borussia Fulda. In the next seasons Wacker finished second and seventh before being relegated as ninth. In 1941 the club managed to return and achieved third places in the first two seasons and eighth in 1944. Historical chart of Hallescher FC league performance after WWII After World War II Wacker Halle was dissolved, like all German clubs, an in 1946 SG Halle-Glaucha (SG stands for \\"sports community\\", Glaucha is an inner neighbourhood) was formed. In 1948 the new club was renamed into SG Freiimfelde Halle, Freiimfelde being an inner eastern district. In April 1949 the footballers of Freiimfelde, after having won the championship of Saxony-Anhalt, joined ZSG Union Halle, the Central Sports Community of the People-Owned Enterprises of Halle. The team from Halle reached the final of the Soviet zone, winning the 1949 Championship of the Eastern Zone with a 4‚Äì1 victory over SG Fortuna Erfurt in front of 50,000 in the Ostragehege stadium of Dresden. The championship plate of 1952 Still in the same year ZSG Union became one of the founding members of the Oberliga, the first division of the German Democratic Republic, the state founded on 7 October 1949 on the territory of the Soviet zone. The team finished the first two seasons on fifth, respectively sixth spot. After the first season the team played as BSG Turbine Halle. Attendance average in 1950‚Äì51 was just under 10.000. In the season 1951‚Äì52 the average rose to 22,170 per match and Turbine won the championship of East Germany, ahead of SG Volkspolizei Dresden and defenders BSG Chemie Leipzig. The form could not be retained and Turbine finished in 1953 on the 13th spot. Worse, after this season some of the most important players like Otto Knefler and coach Alfred \\"Fred\\" Schulz, who led the team to both championships, made off to West Germany in the context of the uprising of 1953 in East Germany. Nevertheless, in the 1953‚Äì54 DDR-Oberliga Turbine could improve to 8th position. The East German authorities were motivated by the West German World Cup win 1954 in Switzerland to make improvements to football in their country. BSGs were transformed to \\"Sport Clubs,\\" often part of major bodies of industry. In Halle this led to the foundation of SC Chemie Halle-Leuna on 18 September 1954 and a large part of the football department of Turbine was transferred to this new entity. Chemie Halle-Leuna were given the Oberliga spot of Turbine, which was kept alive but forthwith played in lower leagues. Chemie Halle-Leuna these days exists as Hallescher FC. Both clubs, Turbine Halle and Hallescher FC, claim the era between 1945 and 1954 as part of their history. The club would be renamed several times in the following years: to SC Chemie Halle-Leuna in 1957, SC Chemie Halle in 1958 and Hallescher FC Chemie in 1966. Oberliga-season 1983. The last name change reflects the separation of football departments from their parent sports clubs all across East Germany, forming football clubs, as sports bureaucrats strove to build a powerful national football team. As BSG Turbine Halle the side won its first East German Cup in 1956, and a second one in 1962, this time as SC Chemie Halle. The club played in the premier DDR- Oberliga as a middling side, with the occasional lapse that would drop them to the second tier DDR-Liga. Their best result in this period was third place Oberliga finish in 1970‚Äì71 that earned them a first-round UEFA Cup appearance. After holding Dutch team PSV Eindhoven to a 0‚Äì0 draw at home, the team were caught in the Hotel 't Silveren Seepaerd fire ahead of the return leg, resulting in the death of midfielder Wolfgang Hoffmann and serious injury to several others. Halle withdrew from the competition immediately. In 1991, after the last season of the DDR-Oberliga, they were placed 10th in the All- time DDR-Oberliga table. The club had also formed a significant number of players for the East Germany national football team, such as Dariusz Wosz and Bernd Bransch. With German reunification in 1990, and the merger of the country's eastern and western leagues, the club entered the 2.Bundesliga as Hallescher FC, the second highest all-German league. However, a lot of important former players had already left the club for Western German or other European clubs and therefore in the 1991‚Äì1992 season, they finished second to last. Following this, they were relegated to the NOFV-Oberliga. However, this was only the beginning of a steady decline that followed and the club descended down to the Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt (fifth level league) by the 1995‚Äì96 season. The 1999‚Äì2000 season was a turning point for Halle, they finally returned to the NOFV-Oberliga where they stayed until 2008. In 2007, Sven K√∂hler became the team's manager and managed to secure a first place in the NOFV-Oberliga S√ºd 2007‚Äì2008. Hallscher FC was promoted to the Regionalliga Nord. They surprisingly finished their first Regionalliga season as a runner- up and only narrowly missed their second promotion within only two seasons. Finally, in the 2011‚Äì12 season, Hallescher FC managed to succeed in a neck- and-neck race with Holstein Kiel and RB Leipzig and was able to secure the first place.

It was built by William Pile, Hay and Co. for transporting passengers and goods between Britain and Australia. Between 1864 and 1887, the ship made 23 annual return voyages from London and Plymouth to Adelaide, South Australia and played an important part in the immigration of Australia. On the return voyages she carried passengers, wool, and copper from Adelaide and Port Augusta to London. From 1869 to 1885 she was part of Harrold Brothers' \\"Adelaide Line\\" of clippers. After 1887, the ship carried coal around the British coast, and timber across the Atlantic. In 1893, she became a floating hospital in Southampton, and in 1923 was purchased by the Royal Navy. The ship was commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS Carrick (to avoid confusion with the newly commissioned ), and based in Scotland as a training ship. In 1948, she was decommissioned and donated to the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Club, and towed into central Glasgow for use as the club's headquarters and remained on the River Clyde until 1989 when she was damaged by flooding. In order to safeguard the vessel, she was protected as a listed building, but in 1991 she sank at her mooring. Carrick was recovered by the Scottish Maritime Museum the following year, and moved to a private slipway adjacent to the museum's site in Irvine. Restoration work began, but funding ceased in 1999, and from 2000 the future of the ship was in doubt. After being served with an eviction notice by the owners of the slipway, the Scottish Maritime Museum was forced to seek the deconstruction of the ship on more than one occasion, while rescue proposals were developed by groups based in Sunderland and South Australia. At a conference convened by the Duke of Edinburgh in 2001, the decision was made to revert the ship's name to City of Adelaide. In 2010, the Scottish Government decided that the ship would be moved to Adelaide, to be preserved as a museum ship, and the duke formally renamed her at a ceremony in 2013. In September 2013, the ship was moved by barge from Scotland to the Netherlands to prepare for transport to Australia. In late November 2013, loaded on the deck of a cargo ship, City of Adelaide departed Europe bound for Port Adelaide, where she arrived on 3 February 2014. Significance City of Adelaide is the world's oldest surviving clipper ship, of only two that survive ‚Äî the other is Cutty Sark (built 1869; a tea- clipper and now a museum ship and tourist attraction in Greenwich, Southeast London). With Cutty Sark and (built 1878; a sloop-of-war in Chatham), City of Adelaide is one of only three surviving ocean-going ships of composite construction to survive. City of Adelaide is one of three surviving sailing ships, and of these the only passenger ship, to have taken emigrants from the British Isles (the other two are Edwin Fox and Star of India). City of Adelaide is the only surviving purpose-built passenger sailing ship. Adding to her significance as an emigrant ship, City of Adelaide is the last survivor of the timber trade between North America and the United Kingdom. As this trade peaked at the same time as conflicts in Europe, a great mass of refugees sought cheap passage on the timber-trade ships, that would otherwise be returning empty, creating an unprecedented influx of new immigrants in North America. Having been built in the years prior to Lloyd's Register publishing their rules for composite ships, City of Adelaide is an important example in the development of naval architecture. The UK's Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships describes the significance of City of Adelaide in these terms: > She highlights the early fast passenger-carrying and general cargo trade to > the Antipodes. Her composite construction illustrates technical development > in 19th shipbuilding techniques and scientific progress in metallurgy and > her self-reefing top sails demonstrate the beginnings of modern labour > saving technologies. Her service on the London to Adelaide route between > 1864 and 1888 gives her an unrivalled associate status as one of the ships > contributing to the growth of the Australian nation. In recognition of her significance, until departing the United Kingdom in 2013, City of Adelaide was an A-listed structure in Scotland, part of the National Historic Fleet of the United Kingdom, and listed in the Core Collection of the United Kingdom. Construction Midship section of a composite ship, by Henri Paasch, 1885 City of Adelaide was designed to carry both passengers and cargo between England and Australia. Cabins could accommodate first-class and second-class passengers, and the hold could be fitted out for carrying steerage-class emigrants when needed. City of Adelaide is of composite construction with timber planking on a wrought-iron frame. This method of construction provides the structural strength of an iron ship combined with the insulation of a timber hull. Unlike iron ships, where copper would cause corrosion in contact with the iron, the timber bottoms of composite ships could be sheathed with copper to prevent fouling. The iron frames meant that composite ships could carry large amounts of canvas sail. Composite ships were therefore some of the fastest ships afloat.Lubbock, Basil The Colonial Clippers. Kessinger Books, New York 1991 pp.144-45; Lubbock, B. (1921) The Colonial Clippers 34 MB PDF Composite ships were built in the relatively short period from c. 1860 to 1880. City of Adelaide was built in 1864 before Lloyd's Register recognised and endorsed composite ships in 1867. Before this, all composite ships were labelled by Lloyds as being \\"Experimental\\". Being a developmental technology in 1864 meant that many of the structural features on City of Adelaide are now regarded as being 'over- engineered', particularly when compared to other later composite ships like Cutty Sark (1869). For example, the frame spacing on City of Adelaide is much closer together than seen on other composite ships. This extra strength from 'over-engineering', together with the good fate to have benefited from human habitation and/or husbandry through to the late 1990s, has likely been a major factor why City of Adelaide has survived, even after being grounded on Kirkcaldy Beach in South Australia for a week in 1874 (see below). Captain David Bruce, first master and quarter-owner Service history=Conception After having gained much experience on the London to Adelaide run with his ship Irene, Captain David Bruce had City of Adelaide built expressly for the South Australia trade. The order for the ship was given to William Pile, Hay and Company of Sunderland and she was launched on 7 May 1864. Captain Bruce took a quarter-share ownership. City of Adelaide is frequently referred to as being owned by the British shipping firm Devitt and Moore, but they were only the managing agents in London. Partner Joseph Moore snr. was a syndicate member, holding a quarter-share in the ship. The remaining two quarter-shares were taken up by South Australian interests ‚Äì Harrold Brothers who were the agents in Adelaide, and Henry Martin, the working proprietor of the Yudnamutana and Blinman copper mines in the Flinders Ranges. City of Adelaide stranded on Kirkcaldy Beach in South Australia, in August 1874. City of Adelaide at Port Augusta, South Australia c1881-83, after conversion to a barque. Historic copper smelters of Yudnamutana (1910). South Australian trade ‚Äî 1864‚Äì87 The ship spent 23 years making annual runs to and from South Australia, playing an important role in the development of the colony. Researchers have estimated that a quarter of a million South Australians can trace their origins to passengers on City of Adelaide. At least six diaries kept by passengers describing voyages have survived from the 23 return voyages between London and Adelaide. City of Adelaide was among the fastest clippers on the London‚ÄîAdelaide run, sharing the record of 65 days with Yatala, which was later broken only by Torrens. On 24 August 1874, the ship was stranded on Kirkcaldy Beach near Grange, six miles south of Semaphore near Adelaide. On board at the time were over 320 people, including one of the diarists, a Scot named James McLauchlan. An outbreak of scarlet fever had occurred during the voyage and seven people died. Two babies were born on board during the voyage ‚Äì one was \\"born dead\\". Upon reaching South Australian waters at the end of this voyage, severe gales were encountered resulting in the stranding of City of Adelaide. The storms also caused accidents and losses of other vessels along the South Australian coast. The schooner Mayflower, on her way from Port Broughton to Port Adelaide, lost her mate Richard Burton, 32, overboard and he drowned: he was on his way to Port Adelaide to meet his wife, Isabella, 29, who was one of the immigrants on board City of Adelaide. Amongst the cargo on this voyage were two Scottish Deerhounds, bred by the Marquis of Lorne, John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll, and being imported by Sir Thomas Elder. A day after the stranding the passengers were removed by steam tugs. City of Adelaide was refloated on 4 September after much of the cargo had been discharged and much of the rigging temporarily removed. The ship was virtually undamaged. By the 1880s, City of Adelaide was also calling at Port Augusta, South Australia on return voyages. At Port Augusta, copper from Henry Martin's Blinman and Yudnamutana copper mines in the Flinders Ranges and wool from outback sheep stations was loaded before racing to the wool sales in London. During this time, in 1881, the ship was rerigged as a barque. =Route of 1874 voyage= This map traces the route of the 1874 voyage from the latitudes and longitudes provided in the diary of James McLauchlan. =Notable passengers= Nurses' Quarters in former First Class cabins of City of Adelaide, c1894 * Sir Frederick Aloysius Weld GCMG ‚Äì sixth Premier of New Zealand, and later served as Governor of Western Australia, Governor of Tasmania, and Governor of the Straits Settlements. * Cyril Maude ‚Äì English stage and film actor. * Alfred Sandover MBE ‚Äì donor of the Sandover Medal. * Matilda Methuen ‚Äì wife of Peter Waite a South Australian pastoralist, businessman, company director and public benefactor. * Frances Goyder ‚Äì wife of George Goyder a surveyor in South Australia who established Goyder's line of rainfall. * Frederick Bullock ‚Äì mayor of Adelaide from 1891 to 1892.

Coal trade ‚Äî 1887‚Äì88 In 1887, City of Adelaide was sold to Dover coal merchant, Charles Havelock Mowll, for use in the collier trade carrying coal from the Tyne to Dover. Timber trade ‚Äî 1888‚Äì93 Butting square timber, Quebec City, Quebec, 1872. In 1888, City of Adelaide was sold to Belfast-based timber merchants Daniel and Thomas Stewart Dixon, and was used to carry timber in the North Atlantic trade. By the start of the 18th century, Britain had exhausted its supplies of the great oaks that had built the Royal Navy. The lack of large trees was problematic as they were a necessity for masts for both war and merchant shipping. A thriving timber import business developed between Britain and the Baltic region but was unpopular for economic and strategic reasons.Tim Ball, \\"Timber!\\", Beaver, April 987, Vol. 67#2 pp 45-56 The Napoleonic Wars and a Continental blockade had a large impact on the Baltic trade and so Britain looked to the North American colonies that were still loyal. The North Atlantic timber trade became a massive business and timber was British North America's most important commodity. In one summer, 1,200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone. As timber is a very bulky cargo, it required many ships to carry it from North America to Britain, but there was little demand for carrying goods on the return voyages. However, there was a market for carrying migrants, so many of the timber ships turned to the migrant trade to fill their unused capacity. Since timber exports tended to peak at the same time as conflicts in Europe, a great mass of refugees sought cheap passage across the Atlantic. This created an unprecedented influx of new immigrants in North America. The timber trade not only brought immigrants to British North America but also played a very important role in keeping them there. While many of those disembarking from the timber-trade ships headed south to the United States, many stayed in British North America. At the peak of the trade in the 1840s, 15,000 Irish loggers were employed in the Gatineau region alone at a time when the population of Montreal was only 10,000. City of Adelaide was home-ported in Belfast and from there frequented several British North American ports, most frequently Miramichi, New Brunswick. Of the thousands of sailing ships involved in the timber trade between North America and the United Kingdom, City of Adelaide is the last survivor. Hospital ship 1893‚Äì1922 City of Adelaide as an isolation hospital off Millbrook, c1894 A hospital ward on City of Adelaide when being used as a hospital ship off Millbrook, c1894 City of Adelaide ended her sailing career in 1893, when purchased by Southampton Corporation for ¬£1750 to serve as a floating isolation hospital. During one year of operation, 23 cases of scarlet fever were cared for. In 2009, the National Health Service named a new hospital at Millbrook, Southampton, in honour of the ship ‚Äì the Adelaide Health Centre. Royal Navy and Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve ‚Äî 1922‚Äì48 In 1923, City of Adelaide was purchased by the Admiralty and towed to Irvine, Scotland, where she was placed on the same slipway that she was to return to in 1992. After conversion to a training ship, she was towed to Greenock and commissioned as a Naval Drill Ship for the newly constituted Clyde Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). As the new cruiser had been commissioned only the previous year, to avoid confusion of two British Empire ships named Adelaide the clipper was renamed HMS Carrick. R.N.V.R. Club (Scotland) ‚Äî 1948‚Äì90 After the war the ship was scheduled for breaking up, but through the work of Commodore James Graham, Duke of Montrose, Vice-Admiral Cedric S. Holland and Admiral Sir Charles Morgan, she was presented by the Admiralty to the R.N.V.R. Club (Scotland), an organisation founded by Lieutenant commander J. Alastair Montgomerie in the autumn of 1947. The towing of HMS Carrick upriver from Greenock to Harland and Wolff's shipyard at Scotstoun on 26 April 1948, was known as 'Operation Ararat'. A grant of 5,000 pounds was received from the King George's Fund for Sailors and 500 pounds was donated from the City of Glasgow War Fund. After fitting out, Carrick was towed further up-river to a berth at Custom House Quay, just above Jamaica Bridge. A plaque on board commemorates the opening ceremony of the Club, which was carried out by Admiral of the Fleet Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope. The ship stayed there until January 1954 when the Clyde Navigation Trust decided to move her to the opposite side of the river at Carlton Place. City of Adelaide sank in Princes Dock, Glasgow, in 1991 under mysterious circumstances. By the mid-1980s the Club realised that it could not afford to maintain its floating clubrooms. It commenced seeking ways of securing the ship's future and passing on ownership, and contacted various bodies with potential interest including the then recently established Scottish Maritime Museum. Museum ship ‚Äî 1990 to presentClyde Ship Trust= In 1989 there proved to be some need for haste, when the ship was flooded when the deck edge was trapped beneath the wharf on a very low tide. The Club in some desperation took the option on its insurance of having the vessel declared a total loss. To facilitate the preservation of the ship, Glasgow District Council applied for Listed Building status. Historic Scotland agreed to take the unusual step of listing a historic vessel as Category A ‚Äì normally only applied to historic buildings. Listing was viewed as a boost to the preservation project. By 1990 a new body, the Clyde Ship Trust, had been formed and, in March of that year, had purchased the vessel for ¬£1. Under the control of the new Trust the vessel was dismasted and prepared for removal and in August 1990, was towed downstream to Princes Dock. Early in 1991, for reasons that have not been clearly identified, the vessel sank at her moorings. The Clyde Ship Trust was placed in a position of embarrassment, for, being already in debt, it was unable to put forward the funds required for a major salvage operation. It became necessary for other organisations to step in to attempt to prevent the total loss of the ship. City of Adelaide being raised at Govan in 1992 City of Adelaide was salvaged by the Scottish Maritime Museum in 1992 and towed to Irvine. =Scottish Maritime Museum= In 1992, with the encouragement of Historic Scotland and Scottish Enterprise, who provided the bulk of the ¬£500,000 required to fund the rescue, the ship was salvaged by the Scottish Maritime Museum and moved to Irvine, North Ayrshire, with the expectation to preserve and eventually restore the vessel. The ship was identified as part of the UK National Historic Ships Core Collection. In September 1993 City of Adelaide was slipped on the same slipway near the Scottish Maritime Museum on which she had been converted in 1923. From then a programme of work was planned and operated on two fronts: preservation and restoration; and to allow public access and good quality interpretation. Work continued until 1999 when Scotland regained its own parliament, UK funding sources for the Scottish Maritime Museum dried up. The museum was subsequently evicted from the slipway site, placing the museum under great pressure to remove City of Adelaide and the museum began to seek alternative options for the clipper. =Clipper Ship City of Adelaide Ltd. (CSCOAL)= The ownership of the vessel transferred from the Scottish Maritime Museum to Clipper Ship City of Adelaide Ltd. (CSCOAL) on 6 September 2013. Rescue and transport to Australia=Background From 1992, City of Adelaide was owned by the Scottish Maritime Museum. After slipping the clipper in 1993, the museum began a programme of work to preserve and restore the historic ship. In May 1999 Scotland regained its own parliament. A side effect of this was that previous UK funding sources for the Scottish Maritime Museum dried up. This then had a snowball effect on the Scottish Maritime Museum. An application for funding for the Museum's other major project, under the UK Heritage Lottery Fund, was rejected. Due to the eroded revenue position, the local municipality reduced its funding, and other grant-aiding organisations adopted a similar position. Following the restructuring of local government in Scotland the Scottish Maritime Museum, as an independent charitable trust, appealed to the Scottish Executive for support. The Executive commissioned a report through the Scottish Museums Council that recommended the sale of City of Adelaide. The Museum began to receive government support but it was conditional on no government funds being spent on the vessel. In 1999 all work on City of Adelaide stopped and the shipwrights were moved to other projects. The Scottish Maritime Museum had agreed a contract with the owner of the slipway on which City of Adelaide was stored, specifying a peppercorn rent of ¬£1 a year. However the contract included a penalty clause requiring payment of ¬£50,000 per year should the owner require the museum to vacate the slipway. SMM were given notice to quit in April 1999, and rental began to accrue. Faced with these potential demands, and unable to find a buyer for the vessel, in May 2000 the trustees of the Scottish Maritime Museum applied to North Ayrshire Council for listed building consent to deconstruct City of Adelaide. The Council received over 100 objections, including representations from nine significant maritime heritage organisations around the world. Members of the UK and Scottish Parliaments objected, as well as the Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Australian ex-Senator and diplomat Robert Hill. The Council refused demolition in February 2001. South Australian and Sunderland delegates on board City of Adelaide during the conference convened by the Duke of Edinburgh =Duke of Edinburgh Conference= As a result of an initiative from The Duke of Edinburgh a conference was convened in Glasgow in September 2001 to discuss the future of the vessel. The conference was chaired by Admiral of the Fleet Sir Julian Oswald, and in addition to the Duke of Edinburgh was attended by representatives of the High Commission of Australia in London, Save the City of Adelaide 1864 Group, City of Sunderland Council, Cutty Sark Trust, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic Scotland, North Ayrshire Council, National Historic Ships Committee, Scottish Executive, Scottish Maritime Museum, Government of South Australia, and Sunderland Maritime Heritage. The conference concluded that City of Adelaide is one of the most important historic vessels in the UK, but that resources available in Scotland were insufficient to ensure her survival. The Duke of Edinburgh proposed that The Maritime Trust and the SMM should work in partnership to fund a first phase of work. This phase would see the vessel removed from the slipway, on which the initial work had been completed, and placed on a barge or similar vessel and transhipped to another location. The Maritime Trust would take the lead in raising the funding support for the first phase. Sunderland Maritime Heritage and the Adelaide- based Save the City of Adelaide 1864 Action Group both presented the conference with proposals for the vessel. The conference agreed that both organisations should now look to securing funding support for their proposals and an active dialogue would be maintained by all concerned. The aim of the Maritime Trust and the Scottish Maritime Museum would be that final transfer to either the Sunderland Maritime Trust or the Save the City of Adelaide 1864 Group would take place as quickly as possible. The final decision of the conference was that as the significance of the vessel lay in her activities under her original name, she should in future be known simply as City of Adelaide. =Edwards proposal= City of Adelaide in April 2005 In 2003 businessman Mike Edwards donated funds for preservation and a feasibility study for the ship's restoration as a tourist adventure sailing ship for Travelsphere Limited. In February 2006 the results of the feasibility studies identified that the cost to comply with current maritime passenger safety regulations for seagoing vessels would be more expensive than building a replica. The studies concluded that it would be more cost-effective to turn City of Adelaide into a static exhibit. Edwards decided not to take up his original option of acquiring City of Adelaide but his charitable efforts had provided another three years of reprieve and a protective cover to shield the clipper from the elements. After three years the Scottish Maritime Museum was back in its original predicament, but the situation was worsened as the volunteer organisations that had previously been campaigning to acquire City of Adelaide had now been on hiatus since 2003. The situation was further exacerbated as over the previous decade and a half, the Irvine River near the slipway had become heavily silted. Environmental regulations were now also more stringent, and the cost of dredging the river near sensitive bird breeding grounds and wetlands was thought to be unaffordable. City of Adelaide was therefore regarded as unrecoverable from the slipway. In May 2006 the Scottish Maritime Museum applied again to North Ayrshire Council for consent to deconstruct the ship, at an estimated cost of ¬£650,000. After the proposal was gazetted by the council 132 letters of objection were received, including representations from preservation groups in Sunderland and Australia, and from several Australian institutions. On 18 April 2007 North Ayrshire Council approved the application to deconstruct of the clipper, subject to the approval of Historic Scotland. Just a few weeks later a major fire broke out on Cutty Sark, prompting a rethink on the future of the only other substantially surviving clipper ship. Rescue proposals e-Petition to the British Prime Minister The North Ayrshire Council decision prompted the South Australian organization Save the City of Adelaide 1864 Action Group to reform after being in hiatus since the 2003 Edwards proposal. Upon the subsequent news of Cutty Sark fire, the Group's Peter Roberts and Peter Christopher highlighted that the fire made it critical to save City of Adelaide. A group from Sunderland subsequently renewed calls to save the ship. The Sunderland City of Adelaide Recovery Foundation (SCARF) proposed to remove the vessel and store her on private land whilst working on plans to develop a maritime museum around the restored City of Adelaide. The Scottish Maritime Museum stated that SCARF were welcome to take the ship should they have the money to save her. The Save the City of Adelaide 1864 Action Group became formally constituted as Clipper Ship \\"City of Adelaide\\" Ltd (CSCOAL). The CSCOAL plan was to transport City of Adelaide to Port Adelaide in South Australia in time for the state's 175th Jubilee in 2011. In March 2009 CSCOAL launched an e-petition on the 10 Downing Street website, calling on the British Prime Minister to intervene to save City of Adelaide and gift the ship \\"to the people of South Australia\\". Federal and state e-petitions were also launched in Australia. The former was later featured in an exhibition of \\"Living Democracy\\" at the Museum of Australian Democracy, Canberra. In November 2009 an open letter, signed by 66 eminent Australians, was sent to the British Prime Minister and the First Minister of Scotland, urging them to prevent the demolition of City of Adelaide. Led by the Governor of South Australia, Rear Admiral Kevin Scarce, other notable signatories included the current and four former Lord Mayors of Adelaide; former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, national and state politicians including Senator Simon Birmingham (who was to figure prominently in the clipper's rescue later), Alexander Downer, Robert Hill, and John Bannon; senior Australian Navy officers; academics; business figures and Australian Living Treasures Dr Basil Hetzel, Jack Mundey and Julian Burnside. City of Adelaide in May 2009 Meanwhile, SCARF member and Sunderland councillor Peter Maddison sought to raise awareness through a four-day 'occupation' of the vessel in October. The Scottish Maritime Museum called for tenders for the demolition or deconstruction of City of Adelaide, which closed on 23 November 2009. Deconstruction of the vessel would involve scientific recording and potential preservation of sections of the ship. CSCOAL submitted a tender, though unlike the other tenders its proposal involved removing the ship as a whole rather than in pieces. The Scottish Maritime Museum found itself in a Catch-22 position: the punitive charges arising from their failure to vacate the slipway were now sufficient to bankrupt the museum, but they did not have sufficient funds to scientifically deconstruct the vessel. Had the museum gone into administration its nationally significant collection would have been dispersed. The alternative for the Scottish Government was to fund either the deconstruction of City of Adelaide, or her removal from Scotland. A conference was held in December 2009 at which the main stakeholders discussed the possible options for saving the ship. Review of options In March 2010, in response to questions in the Scottish Parliament from Irene Oldfather, MSP for Cunninghame South which includes Irvine, the Scottish Minister for Culture and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop said the Scottish Government was working closely with a number of stakeholders to explore realistic options for securing the future of City of Adelaide and that Historic Scotland had commenced an assessment of these options. Hyslop said she had met a delegation from CSCOAL and had subsequently spoken to the South Australian Minister for Transport Patrick Conlon. Historic Scotland's assessment looked at four options: deconstruction; removal elsewhere in Scotland; removal to Sunderland by SCARF; or removal to Australia by CSCOAL. The options appraisal was carried out by DTZ with advice from Sir Neil Cossons, former Director of the National Maritime Museum and a former Chair of English Heritage, with extensive experience in maritime heritage. James McLauchlan, author of the 1874 diary, with his family (c.1889) In May 2010 Minister Hyslop accepted from Irene Oldfather a copy of a diary kept by James Anderson McLauchlan, a 21-year-old Scot who migrated to South Australia on City of Adelaide in 1874. The diary begins with his departure from Dundee, and his subsequent 80-day voyage to South Australia. The presentation was intended to highlight the importance of City of Adelaide from the human perspective, and the experiences \\"shared by thousands of other people who made the journey across the globe for a new life\\". In July 2010 The Duke of Edinburgh gave a rare radio interview reflecting on the 40th anniversary of the rescue of the , and commented on the hideous trap that City of Adelaide was in. Hyslop announced on 28 August 2010 that City of Adelaide would not be deconstructed, and that CSCOAL had been identified as the preferred bidder. The DTZ report identified the CSCOAL as the only feasible option which would not involve destruction of the ship. The CSCOAL bid was considered to meet the assessment criteria, despite some funding uncertainties. The rival bid from SCARF was not considered to be technically feasible, with significant risks identified in relation to funding and the expertise available to the SCARF team. Costs associated with transport to Australia were estimated at A$5 million. Sunderland-based SCARF congratulated the Australian group but stated that their campaign to keep the ship in the United Kingdom would continue. Project preliminaries City of Adelaide being moved onto a barge after over 20 years on land City of Adelaide on the transportation barge ready to leave Irvine, Scotland A detailed bathymetric / hydrographic survey of the River Irvine had been previously undertaken to develop the strategies for recovering City of Adelaide from the riverbank. This was necessary as the river had silted up over the twenty years since the clipper was slipped. In advance of the vessel's removal, the Scottish Maritime Museum commissioned Headland Archaeology to undertake a detailed 3D laser survey of City of Adelaide. This serves as a detailed record of the ship, and enabled the transportation cradle to be designed and built with great precision in South Australia. Virtual tours of the inside and outside of the clipper were also created during the laser survey. An early stage in the preparatory work involved cleaning and treatment of the timbers. This was completed by the Scottish Maritime Museum in December 2010. Preparation for transport to Australia In 2011, donor companies from across South Australia completed fabrication of CSCOAL's 100-tonne, A$1.2-million, steel cradle to be placed under the ship to move her. The first cradle components arrived at the Scottish Maritime Museum in January 2012 for assembly on site. The load lifting capacity of the cradle was certified on 23 March 2012 in readiness for assembly under the ship. In late February 2012 protestors from Sunderland-based SCARF again occupied the ship in an attempt to prevent her removal to Australia. Unrelated to the SCARF protest, a delay to the project of nearly a year occurred as the Scottish Maritime Museum went through protracted negotiations with the slipway owners for access to their land to enable the removal of the clipper. Meanwhile, CSCOAL utilised the delay by shipping the clipper's timber rudder to South Australia as the 'pathfinder' to explore and test Customs and Quarantine-related issues with respect to exporting from the UK, and importing into Australia. The rudder arrived in Adelaide in December 2012. The rudder had been built at Fletchers Slip in South Australia after the original was lost in a storm in South Australian waters in 1877. Sunderland-based SCARF threatened legal action towards CSCOAL, and built a wooden replica rudder as a protest. The access agreement between the Scottish Maritime Museum and the slipway owners was resolved in March 2013. Immediately CSCOAL sent a project manager, Richard Smith, to Scotland to manage the activity that commenced a couple of weeks later of disassembling the cradle, and reassembling it beneath and around the clipper. The actual transport of City of Adelaide from Scotland to South Australia started in September 2013, when the clipper on her cradle was transferred using self-propelled modular transporters to a barge for transport to Chatham, Kent. On 20 September 2013 City of Adelaide left the Irvine River aboard the barge towed by the tug Dutch Pioneer, and entered open water, commencing her journey south. City of Adelaide arrived at Chatham Docks on 25 September 2013.City of Adelaide arrives at Chatham - 25 September 2013 CSCOAL press release. Retrieved 3 October 2013. Meanwhile, the South Australian media reported that the departure to Australia could not be confirmed. A federal election on 7 September had led to a change in government, and in the meantime the funding to cover the journey to Australia had not been approved. CSCOAL were briefly left \\"in limbo\\". CSCOAL arranged for the vessel to be towed upstream to Greenwich, and moored near Cutty Sark, a few days ahead of a ceremony on 18 October at which the Duke of Edinburgh formally renamed Carrick as City of Adelaide. On the day prior the ceremony, the Australian Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment Simon Birmingham, announced the Australian Government had approved the grant of A$850,000 enabling transport arrangements to be made to move the ship from the UK to Australia. Representatives of SCARF staged a protest on the day of the ceremony, and stated that they were seeking an export ban which would prevent removal of the ship from the UK. On 24 October City of Adelaide arrived at Dordrecht in the Netherlands, to undergo the necessary treatment to satisfy Australian quarantine requirements. Following fumigation, the clipper was lifted aboard the heavy-lift ship MV Palanpur on 22 November 2013 for transport from the Netherlands bound for South Australia. Final voyage City of Adelaide clipper aboard MV Palanpur, making her way up the Port River, adjacent to Torrens Island Bradley barge, seen on the northern side of Dock 1 at Port Adelaide One hundred and forty-nine years after her first journey to Adelaide, City of Adelaide embarked on her last trip to the South Australian coast following a course reminiscent of the vessel's service in both the North Atlantic timber trade and the South Australian service. The old ship's journey commenced at 13:15 Central European Time on 26 November 2013, departing Rotterdam, Netherlands on the deck of MV Palanpur. Effectively representing her old timber trade voyages, City of Adelaide crossed the Atlantic arriving in the United States' port of Norfolk, Virginia on 9 December. On 13 December, Palanpur continued southward to rejoin the historic clipper route between the UK and Australia off the coast of Brazil. On 5 January 2014,. the passage briefly departed from the historic route for Palanpur to take on fuel in Cape Town, South Africa, a port frequented by City of Adelaide on northbound voyages and last visited in 1890. Steaming from Cape Town, the voyage strayed from the historic clipper route a final time, calling on Port Hedland, Western Australia (between 23 and 26 January) where Palanpur offloaded six locomotives from Virginia.. Following the voyage's Western Australia stop, the final leg of City of Adelaide's last passage concluded with arrival at the Outer Harbor of its home port, Port Adelaide, at 6:30 am on 3 February 2014.. Temporary location in Port Adelaide After arriving at Berth 18 in the Port River on 3 February, City of Adelaide was craned from Palanpur onto the 800 tonne barge Bradley. This was a lengthy operation due to the need to \\"skid\\" the 450 tonne vessel and her 100 tonne cradle across the deck of Palanpur between the ship's cranes before she could be off-loaded... On the evening of 6 February she was then moved upstream to Dock 1 in Port Adelaide's inner harbour, where she will remain for 6‚Äì12 months until a final location is selected and prepared. Fletcher's Slip was for many the preferred site, but other sites such as Cruickshanks Corner and the Queens Wharf near Hart's Mill were considered.

Part of War of the Austrian Succession, a French army force of 80,000 under Marshal Saxe faced a Pragmatic army of 60,000, led by the Duke of Cumberland. Under Saxe, arguably the most talented general of his generation, the French had conquered much of the Austrian Netherlands between 1744 to 1746. In the spring of 1747, Cumberland intended to retake Antwerp, but Saxe threatened to cut him off from his key supply base at Maastricht, forcing him to defend it. Saxe exploited a series of mistakes by Cumberland, and only counterattacks by the Allied cavalry enabled the bulk of his army to withdraw in good order. Defeat ended Allied hopes of regaining lost ground, and the French captured Bergen op Zoom in September, then Maastricht in May 1748. However, the cost of the war meant France's financial system was on the verge of collapse, while the British naval blockade caused severe food shortages. Their position worsened in October 1747, when the British naval victory of Second Cape Finisterre left them unable to defend their merchant shipping or trade routes. Both sides now wanted peace, leading to the October 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Background When the War of the Austrian Succession began in 1740, Britain was focused on the 1739‚Äì1748 War of Jenkins' Ear with Spain, fought mostly in the Caribbean. British and Dutch troops in Flanders initially did so as part of the army of Hanover; France only declared war on Britain in March 1744, the Dutch Republic remained neutral until 1747. By the end of 1746, most of the participants wanted peace. Having defeated Spanish attacks in Northern Italy, Maria Theresa wanted to focus on rebuilding the Austrian army, and regain Silesia from Prussia. The Austrian Netherlands was acquired in 1713, only because neither the British or Dutch would allow the other to control it; retaining it was not a strategic priority. French victory at Rocoux in October 1746 confirmed their control of the Austrian Netherlands, but failed to force Britain to end the war. France began the war to reduce the post-1713 expansion in British commercial strength, but by 1747, British trade was expanding once again, while the French economy was being strangled by the naval blockade. Declaring war on the Dutch made the situation worse for both countries, since as neutrals, they had been the main carriers of French imports and exports. Although the cost of the war also impacted the British, they were far better equipped to finance it. Only British subsidies kept their Allies fighting; in the January 1747 Hague Convention, Britain agreed to fund Austrian and Sardinian forces in Italy and an Allied army of 140,000 in Flanders, increasing to 192,000 in 1748. Although Franco-British negotiations began at Breda in August 1746, the British envoy, Lord Sandwich, was told to delay. The Duke of Newcastle hoped to recover the Netherlands, and the death of Philip V in July 1746 would break the Bourbon alliance; both proved incorrect. Battle Fort Liefkenshoek, near Antwerp (background); its capture by the French in April forced the Allies to abandon plans to retake the port By taking troops from other areas, Saxe was able to assemble a field army of 120,000 men for the 1747 campaign. The defeat of the Jacobite Rising allowed Cumberland to transfer troops back to Flanders, and prepare an offensive. He hoped to capture Antwerp in February, but bad weather, lack of transport, and war weariness meant the Allies were not ready to take the field until early May. During this delay, Contades captured Fort Liefkenhock, making Antwerp too strong to attack. Simultaneously, L√∂wendahl seized Sas van Gent, IJzenijke and Eekels, threatening Cumberland's supply lines with Maastricht. The latter inspired an Orangist Coup in Zeeland, which eventually led to William IV being appointed first hereditary Stadtholder of all seven Dutch provinces. To protect Maastricht, Cumberland sent von Daun to secure Tongeren, then held by Clermont-Tonnerre. The Allied cavalry under Ligonier were ordered to occupy the Tongeren-Maastricht road, which ran along a ridge parallel to the River Meuse. Finding the French already in possession, they halted for the night, with the infantry billeted in the villages of Vlytingen and Lauffeld. As at Rocoux, the Austrians were on the right, holding the villages of Grote and Kleine Spouwen, which are now part of the Belgian town of Bilzen. A steep ravine immediately in front protected them from a direct assault. Earl Ligonier (1680‚Äì1770); his cavalry charges allowed the Allies to make an orderly retreat, although he was taken prisoner The next day was overcast, and heavy rain made movement slow and difficult. An exchange of artillery fire began at 6:00 am, which continued until 8:30. The British and German infantry left the villages where they had spent the night, having first set them on fire to prevent their use by the French, and formed up on open ground. Based on his experience at Fontenoy, Ligonier urged they be used as fortified positions; after some hesitation, Cumberland agreed. Saxe assumed the Allies were retreating across the Meuse, and around 10:30 sent troops into what he assumed were now empty villages. While true of Vlytingen, Lauffeld had been re-occupied by troops under Frederick of Hesse-Kassel, and the next four hours developed into a fierce struggle. The French finally captured Lauffeld around 12:30 pm, after taking heavy casualties in a series of frontal assaults. Cumberland ordered a counter-attack but as the infantry formed up, a Dutch cavalry unit to their front was routed by the French and fled, throwing those behind them into disorder and exposing the Allied centre. Meanwhile, 150 squadrons of French cavalry had assembled around Wilre, preparing to attack Cumberland's flank; unaware the Allies were falling back on Maastricht, Ligonier and 60 squadrons charged, taking them by surprise. One of the best known cavalry charges in British military history, Saxe later claimed only this prevented him destroying the Allied army. The French Irish Brigade suffered more than 1,400 casualties; at one point, the short-sighted Cumberland mistook the red-coated Irish for his own troops, and barely escaped being taken prisoner. To cover the retreating infantry, Ligonier obtained permission for another charge, this time with only three regiments. He was taken prisoner, while the Scots Greys, one of the units involved, lost nearly 40% of their strength. This action allowed time for Karl Josef Batthy√°ny and his Austrians to cover the Allied withdrawal. Aftermath Lauffeld was another French tactical victory that failed to achieve a decisive result, despite the capture of Bergen-op-Zoom in September and Maastricht in May 1748. The British naval blockade caused a collapse in French customs receipts, and cut them off from the Newfoundland cod fisheries, a key food supply for the poor. Finance Minister Machault repeatedly warned Louis XV of the impending collapse of their financial system. French troops enter Bergen op Zoom September 1747 Despite success in Flanders, the French strategic position became critical after the Royal Navy attacked a large convoy at Cape Finisterre in October 1747. Most of the merchantmen escaped, but at the cost of sacrificing their escort; combined with other losses, the French navy could no longer protect their colonies, or trade routes. In November, Britain and Russia signed a convention for the supply of additional troops and in February 1748, a Russian corps of 37,000 arrived in the Rhineland. By now, Britain was also ready to agree terms, although it has been argued Newcastle failed to appreciate the impact of the naval blockade. The terms of the Treaty of Aix- la-Chapelle were first agreed by Britain and France at Breda, then presented to their allies. These confirmed Prussian possession of Silesia and minor territorial adjustments in Italy, but essentially returned the situation to 1740, with France withdrawing from the Low Countries. Returning the territorial gains which had cost so much, in exchange for so little, led to the phrase \\"as stupid as the Peace\\". In the longer term, the war confirmed the decline of the Dutch Republic as a major power; Newcastle berated himself for his \\"ignorance, obstinacy, and credulity\\", in believing otherwise. British acceptance of the Prussian conquest of Silesia caused the breakdown of the Anglo-Austrian Alliance, and led to Austria's alignment with its traditional enemy France, known as the Diplomatic Revolution. Lauffeld exposed Cumberland's weaknesses as a general, also factors in the May 1745 defeat at Fontenoy. They included inadequate reconnaissance, lack of strategic awareness, and poor co-ordination with his senior commanders; he failed to inform Ligonier that he had withdrawn the infantry. His career ended following the 1757 Convention of Klosterzeven, when France occupied Hanover; his father, George II, never forgave him.

They were succeeded by a second Mamluk dynasty, the Burji dynasty (1382-1517 AD). Their name \\"Bahriyya\\" means 'of the river', referring to the location of their original settlement on Al-Rodah Island in the Nile (Nahr al-Nil) in Medieval CairoThere is another theory about the origin of the name which states that they were called 'Bahariyya' because they came by sea or from over sea.

She became the Sultana of Egypt on May 2, 1250 (648 AH), marking the end of the Ayyubid reign and the start of the Mamluk era. Her reign was short, lasting under three months.

Izz al-Din Aybak (ÿπÿ≤ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ÿ£Ÿäÿ®ŸÉ) was the first of the Mamluk sultans of Egypt in the Turkic Bahri line, if the reign of Shajar al-Durr is discounted. 1257-November 1259 AD: Mamluk Sultan Al-Malik Al-Man·π£≈´r N≈´r ad-dƒ´n  æAlƒ´ ibn Aybak (1257-1259 AD, 655-657 AH, Dethroned) (ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿµŸàÿ± ŸÜŸàÿ± ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ£Ÿäÿ®ŸÉ). Al-Mansur Ali (ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿµŸàÿ± ÿπŸÑŸâ) (b. c. 1244, Cairo) was the second of the Mamluk Sultans of Egypt in the Turkic, or Bahri, line. Some historians, however, consider Shajar al-Durr as the first of the Mamluk Sultans; thus, Al-Mansur Ali was the third Mamluk Sultan He ruled from 1257 to 1259 after the assassination of his father Aybak during a turbulent period that witnessed the Mongols invasion of the Islamic world. November 1259-24 October 1260 AD: The Reign of Mamluk Sultan al-Malik al-Muzafar Seif al-Din Qutuz (1259-1260 AD, Assassinated) (ŸÑŸÖŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ∏ŸÅÿ± ÿ≥ŸäŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ŸÇÿ∑ÿ≤). (Arabic: ÿ≥ŸäŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ŸÇÿ∑ÿ≤; d. 24 October 1260). Under his leadership, the Mamluks defeated the Mongols in the key Battle of Ain Jalut (3 September 1260). Qutuz was assassinated by a fellow Mamluk leader, Baibars, on his triumphant return journey to Cairo. 24 October 1260 - 1 July 1277 AD: The Reign of Mamluk Sultan al-Zahir Rukn al-Din Baibars (Baybars) I al-Bunduqdari (1260-1277 AD, 658-665 AH, died in office)(ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑÿ∏ÿßŸáÿ± ÿ±ŸÉŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ÿ®Ÿäÿ®ÿ±ÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÜÿØŸÇÿØÿßÿ±Ÿä) nicknamed Abu al- Futuh and Abu l-Futuhat (ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ™Ÿàÿ≠; \\"Father of Conquest\\", referring to his victories) ‚Äî He was one of the commanders of the Muslim forces that defeated King Louis IX of France to end the Seventh Crusade (1248 to 1254). Louis IX was defeated by the Ayyubid Sultan Al-Muazzam Turanshah, supported by Faris ad-Din Aktai's Bahariyya Mamluks, Baibars al-Bunduqdari, Qutuz, Aybak, and Al- Mansur Qalawun. Louis was taken prisoner, and approximately 800,000 bezants were paid in ransom for his release. Baibars also led the vanguard of the army at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, which marked the first substantial defeat of the Mongol army and is considered a turning point in history. The reign of Baibars marked the start of the age of Mamluk dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean and solidified the durability of their military system. He managed to pave the way for the end of the Crusader presence in the Levant and reinforced the union of Egypt and Syria as the region's pre-eminent Muslim state, able to fend off threats from both Crusaders and Mongols, and even managed to subdue the kingdom of Makuria (in the Sudan), which was famous for being unconquerable by previous Muslim empire invasion attempts. This marks the start of the spread of Islam south of Egypt.  Brief Biography  After the repose of Pope Cyril III of Alexandria (Cyril III ibn Laqlaq)) 75th Pope of Alexandria & Patriarch of the See of St. Mark, on 10 March 1243 AD, the Episcopal See of St Mark remained vacant for seven and a half years. The Copts were obliged to pay a fee of 3000 dinars every time they ordain a new Pope, which was a prohibitive sum. However, when Sultan Ezzeddin Aybak ((ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿ≤ ÿπÿ≤ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ÿ£Ÿäÿ®ŸÉ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ±ŸÉŸÖÿßŸÜŸä ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿßÿ¥ŸÜŸÉŸäÿ±)) became the de facto ruler in 1250 AD, the Copts offered him a gift of 500 dinars for the purpose of this ordination, and he accepted it. Moreover, it seems that this was the last time that such a fee was imposed, as there is no record in history that the Copts had to pay this fee again. The person selected for the Patriarchate was a priest and a monk from the Monastery of St Anthony in the Eastern Desert. His name was Paul ibn Kalil al-Masri (ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ≥ ÿ®ŸàŸÑÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßŸáÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿ∑ŸàŸÜŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿ±ŸàŸÅ ÿ®ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ŸÉŸÑŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµÿ±Ÿä). He was a deacon and the son of a priest and then he became a monk and priest under the name Paul (ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ≥ ÿ®ŸàŸÑÿ≥ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÉŸÑŸäŸÑ) and was nicknamed \\"the son of Rev. Makarim ben Kalil\\"(ŸàŸÑÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ≥ ŸÖŸÉÿßÿ±ŸÖ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÉŸÑŸäŸÑ). He was selected over a priest and monk named Gabriel, who was a relative of Bishop Abba Peter of Tanbadi (ÿ®ÿ∑ÿ±ÿ≥ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ÿ∑ŸÜÿ®ÿØŸä), who was hoping for the position, supported by the children of Al-Assal (ÿ£ŸàŸÑÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ≥ÿßŸÑ), but the people rejected Gabriel the monk. Bishop Abba Yousab of Fouh and Upper Menouf the author of a useful work on Church History (ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ŸäŸàÿ≥ÿßÿ® ÿµÿßÿ≠ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ŸÅŸàŸá ŸàŸÖŸÜŸàŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸäÿß) played an important role in establishing the ordination of the priest Paul ibn Kalil the monk, and finally all agreed on his ordination. When he was chosen for the patriarchate, he was promoted to the rank of Hegumen ( ÿØÿ±ÿ¨ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ•Ÿäÿ∫ŸàŸÖÿßŸÜŸàÿ≥Ÿäÿ©) of the Hanging Church (ÿßŸÑŸÉŸÜŸäÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπŸÑŸÇÿ©) in Cairo on Sunday 2 October 1250 AD (5 Baba 967 AM) with great glory and celebration. After being promoted to the rank of Hegumen in Cairo, he traveled with the bishops, the senior clergy, and the Coptic leaders to Alexandria to complete his ordination as Patriarch, as was the custom. There, he was consecrated Patriarch in the Church of Sotir (the Church of the Savior) in Alexandria (ŸÉŸÜŸäÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ™Ÿàÿ™Ÿäÿ±- ŸÉŸÜŸäÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿÆŸÑÿµ) a week later on Sunday 9 October 1250 AD. At the time of the ordination of Pope Athanasius III, the Vizier Sharafuddin Abi Said the son of Sa'id al-Nayizi (ÿßŸÑŸàÿ≤Ÿäÿ± ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ÿ£ÿ®Ÿä ÿ≥ÿπŸäÿØ Ÿáÿ®ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ®ŸÜ ÿµÿßÿπÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßŸäÿ≤Ÿä) was present in Alexandria. The Pope met with him, and the Vizier received him for a long reception. Before leaving Alexandria, the new pope consecrated several churches and ordained a number of priests. He then headed to monasteries of Nitria (Wadi al-Natroun, ŸàÿßÿØŸä ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ∑ÿ±ŸàŸÜ), as was the custom of the new patriarchs when they were ordained. In the year 1257 AD (973 AM), Pope Athanasius III consecrated the Holy Oil of Chrismation (the Myron, ÿßŸÑŸÖŸäÿ±ŸàŸÜ) in the monastery of St Macarius (Abi Makar, ÿØŸäÿ± ÿ£ÿ®Ÿä ŸÖŸÇÿßÿ±). The consecration was attended by several bishops. They included Bishop Abba Yoannis of Samannoud (ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ŸäŸàÿ£ŸÜÿ≥ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ÿ≥ŸÖŸÜŸàÿØ), Bishop Abba Gregorius of Mahalla (ÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ÿ∫ÿ±Ÿäÿ∫Ÿàÿ±ŸäŸàÿ≥ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ŸÑÿ©), Bishop Mikhail of El-Baramon (ÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ŸÖŸäÿÆÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÑ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ŸÖŸàŸÜ), Bishop Abba Yousab of Fouh and Upper Menouf the author of a useful work on Church History ((ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ŸäŸàÿ≥ÿßÿ® ÿµÿßÿ≠ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ŸÅŸàŸá ŸàŸÖŸÜŸàŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸäÿß), Bishop Abba Abraam of Nestroh (ÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ÿßÿ®ÿ±ÿ¢ŸÖ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ŸÜÿ≥ÿ™ÿ±Ÿàÿ©), Bishop Abba Boutros of Sinjar (ÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ÿ®ÿ∑ÿ±ÿ≥ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ÿ≥ŸÜÿ¨ÿßÿ±), Bishop Abba Youanes of Laqana (ÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß Ÿäÿ§ÿßŸÜÿ≥ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ŸÑŸÇÿßŸÜÿ©), Bishop Abba Mark of Dafri (ÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ŸÖÿ±ŸÇÿ≥ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ÿØŸÅÿ±Ÿä), Bishop Abba Yoannis ibn Al-Khazen of Abu Tig (ÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ŸäŸàÿ£ŸÜÿ≥ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿÆÿßÿ≤ŸÜ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ÿ™Ÿäÿ¨), Bishop Abba Yusab of Akhmim (ÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ŸäŸàÿ≥ÿßÿ® ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ÿ£ÿÆŸÖŸäŸÖ), Bishop Abba Boutros (Peter) of Fayoum (ÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ÿ®ÿ∑ÿ±ÿ≥ ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ÿßŸÑŸÅŸäŸàŸÖ), and (12) Bishop Abba Youannis (John) of Al-Bahnasa (Oxyrhynchus) (ÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿß ŸäŸàÿßŸÜÿ≥ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßŸáÿ®ÿ© ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸáŸÜÿ≥ÿß). He struggled during his episcopate for peace within the Church and struggled against the ill effects of Simony (acquisition of the priesthood with money). When he became patriarch, he attempted everything within his power to heal the church and repair the damage caused by his predecessor, Cyril III (ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿ®ÿß ŸÉŸäÿ±ŸÑÿ≥ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÑŸÇŸÑŸÇ). He pressed hard on the bishops who ascended to the episcopate by the Simeonite way, the manner in which Pope Cyril III sold the various positions of the episcopate. Because of this, Many Coptic bishops left the Orthodox faith. In his days, a governor official named Assaad Sharaf al-Din Hibatullah bin Sa'ad al-Nayzi (ÿßŸÑŸàÿ≤Ÿäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ≥ÿπÿØ ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ Ÿáÿ®ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ®ŸÜ ÿµÿßÿπÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßŸäÿ≤Ÿä), who used to be a Coptic Christian (ŸÇÿ®ÿ∑Ÿä ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿµŸÑ), charged the Christians double the allocated taxation. In his days also, the Muslims rioted in Damascus and destroyed the Church of the Virgin Mary after burning and looting what was in it (Al-Maqrizi, part 4, p. 402). Also in the year 1259 AD (976 AM), a group of Christians were killed in Damascus and their homes were looted just before the Battle of Ain Jalut. Following the Battle of Ain Jalut and the defeat of the Mongols, the Mamluk Sultan al-Malik al-Muzafar Seif al- Din Qutuz entered Damascus, and ordered the Christians to pay 150,000 Dirhams, which collected from them and carried to him by the Embassy of the Persian Prince Farisuddin Aktay (ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÖŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥Ÿä ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ÿ£ŸÇÿ∑ÿßŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ÿπÿ±ÿ® ÿ£ÿ™ÿßÿ®ŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿ≥ŸÉÿ±). There was a large Coptic presence in Damascus in these days, and they had many Coptic Churches in Damascus.

Philosophical discussion of questions relating to technology (or its Greek ancestor techne) dates back to the very dawn of Western philosophy. The phrase \\"philosophy of technology\\" was first used in the late 19th century by German-born philosopher and geographer Ernst Kapp, who published a book titled \\"Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik\\". Section 2, paragraph 10. Published in vol. 13 of the Encyclopedia of Applied Physics (entry \\"Technology, Philosophy of\\"), pp. 417‚Äì29. VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany, 1995.  History = Greek philosophy  The western term 'technology' comes from the Greek term techne (œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑) (art, or craft knowledge) and philosophical views on technology can be traced to the very roots of Western philosophy. A common theme in the Greek view of techne is that it arises as an imitation of nature (for example, weaving developed out of watching spiders). Greek philosophers such as Heraclitus and Democritus endorsed this view. In his Physics, Aristotle agreed that this imitation was often the case, but also argued that techne can go beyond nature and complete \\"what nature cannot bring to a finish.\\"Aristotle, Physics II.8, 199a15 Aristotle also argued that nature (physis) and techne are ontologically distinct because natural things have an inner principle of generation and motion, as well as an inner teleological final cause. While techne is shaped by an outside cause and an outside telos (goal or end) which shapes it.Aristotle, Physics II Natural things strive for some end and reproduce themselves, while techne does not. In Plato's Timaeus, the world is depicted as being the work of a divine craftsman (Demiurge) who created the world in accordance with eternal forms as an artisan makes things using blueprints. Moreover, Plato argues in the Laws, that what a craftsman does is imitate this divine craftsman.  Middle ages to 19th century  Sir Francis Bacon During the period of the Roman empire and late antiquity authors produced practical works such as Vitruvius' De Architectura (1st century BC) and Agricola's De Re Metallica (1556). Medieval Scholastic philosophy generally upheld the traditional view of technology as imitation of nature. During the Renaissance, Francis Bacon became one of the first modern authors to reflect on the impact of technology on society. In his utopian work New Atlantis (1627), Bacon put forth an optimistic worldview in which a fictional institution (Salomon's House) uses natural philosophy and technology to extend man's power over nature - for the betterment of society, through works which improve living conditions. The goal of this fictional foundation is \\"...the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible\\".  19th century  The native German philosopher and geographer Ernst Kapp, who was based in Texas, published the fundamental book \\"Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik\\" in 1877.* Ernst Kapp: Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik. Zur Entstehungsgeschichte der Cultur aus neuen Gesichtspunkten (Braunschweig/Brunswick 1877, Reprint D√ºsseldorf 1978, Engl. Translation Chicago 1978). Kapp was deeply inspired by the philosophy of Hegel and regarded technique as a projection of human organs. In the European context, Kapp is referred to as the founder of the philosophy of technology. Another, more materialistic position on technology which became very influential in the 20th-century philosophy of technology was centered on the ideas of Benjamin Franklin and Karl Marx.  20th century to present  Five early prominent 20th-century philosophers to directly address the effects of modern technology on humanity were John Dewey, Martin Heidegger, Herbert Marcuse, G√ºnther Anders and Hannah Arendt. They all saw technology as central to modern life, although Heidegger, Anders,# The Outdatedness of Human Beings 1. On the Soul in the Era of the Second Industrial Revolution. 1956 # The Outdatedness of Human Beings 2. On the Destruction of Life in the Era of the Third Industrial Revolution. ArendtHannah Arendt, The Human Condition, 1958. and Marcuse were more ambivalent and critical than Dewey. The problem for Heidegger was the hidden nature of technology's essence, Gestell or Enframing which posed for humans what he called its greatest danger and thus its greatest possibility. Heidegger's major work on technology is found in The Question Concerning Technology. Contemporary philosophers with an interest in technology include Jean Baudrillard, Albert Borgmann, Andrew Feenberg, Langdon Winner, Donna Haraway, Avital Ronell, Brian Holmes, Don Ihde, Bruno Latour, Paul Levinson, Ernesto Mayz Vallenilla, Carl Mitcham, Leo Marx, Gilbert Simondon, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Bernard Stiegler, Paul Virilio, G√ºnter Ropohl, Nicole C. Karafyllis, Richard Sennett, √Ålvaro Vieira Pinto and George Grant. While a number of important individual works were published in the second half of the twentieth century, Paul Durbin has identified two books published at the turn of the century as marking the development of the philosophy of technology as an academic subdiscipline with canonical texts.Techn√© Vol 7 No 1 Those were Technology and the Good Life (2000), edited by Eric Higgs, Andrew Light, and David Strong and American Philosophy of Technology (2001) by Hans Achterhuis. Several collected volumes with topics in philosophy of technology have come out over the past decade and the journals Techne: Research in Philosophy and Technology (the journal of the Society for Philosophy and Technology, published by the Philosophy Documentation Center) and Philosophy & Technology (Springer) publish exclusively works in philosophy of technology. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, some philosophers - such as Alexander Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark in their book Excommunication - argue that advances in and the pervasiveness of digital technologies transform the philosophy of technology into a new 'first philosophy'. Citing examples such as the analysis of writing and speech in Plato's dialogue The Phaedrus, Galloway et al. suggest that instead of considering technology as a secondary to ontology, technology be understood as prior to the very possibility of philosophy: \\"Does everything that exists, exist to me presented and represented, to be mediated and remediated, to be communicated and translated? There are mediative situations in which heresy, exile, or banishment carry the day, not repetition, communion, or integration. There are certain kinds of messages that state 'there will be no more messages'. Hence for every communication there is a correlative excommunication.\\"Excommunication: Three Inquiries in Media and Mediation, Alexander R. Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark (University of Chicago Press, 2013), p. 10. Philosophers of technology reflect broadly and work in the area and include interest on diverse topics of geoengineering, internet data and privacy, our understandings of internet cats, technological function and epistemology of technology, computer ethics, biotechnology and its implications, transcendence in space, and technological ethics more broadly.  Technology and neutrality  Technological determinism is the idea that \\"features of technology [determine] its use and the role of a progressive society was to adapt to [and benefit from] technological change.\\" The alternative perspective would be social determinism which looks upon society being at fault for the \\"development and deployment\\" of technologies. Lelia Green used recent gun massacres such as the Port Arthur Massacre and the Dunblane Massacre to selectively show technological determinism and social determinism. According to Green, a technology can be thought of as a neutral entity only when the sociocultural context and issues circulating the specific technology are removed. It will be then visible to us that there lies a relationship of social groups and power provided through the possession of technologies.

Lithograph of Cremorne Gardens in 1862 Cremorne Gardens was a pleasure garden (now referred to as amusement parks) established in 1853 on the banks of the Yarra River at Richmond in Melbourne, Australia. The gardens were established by James Ellis who had earlier managed and leased similar gardens of the same name on the banks of the River Thames at Chelsea in London. He had been declared bankrupt and emigrated to Australia to take advantage of the business opportunities made possible by the Victorian gold rush and its accompanying population explosion. His first venture in the entertainment world in Melbourne was Astley's Amphitheatre, but his experiences in catering in London inclined him to a profit making business with a wider basis. Because of previous experience he had established contacts in the theatrical world of London. He took advantage of them to create a venue with viable entertainments to divert the population of the rapidly expanding capital of the new Australian state where entertainment was demanded by a predominantly male society. The wowser element in Melbourne did not approve of the pleasure gardens. Ellis had invested much money in them and they were very popular, but criticism of the availability of liquor and the use of the venue by prostitutes went against him. Ellis had tried to gain social favour by donating percentages of profits to charity but that did not help him. The disapproval was an attitude which had frequently been taken against the large pleasure gardens in London on which Ellis had based his colonial duplicate. It would not, however, have been beneath Ellis to take advantage of the needs of diggers holidaying in Melbourne and on the hunt for a bit of fun. His detractors forced his sale of Cremorne Gardens but they survived in the hands of someone who had the skill and experience to administer and develop them. Ellis went on to own a hotel in Fitzroy. The gardens were acquired by the popular theatrical entrepreneur and local identity George Coppin who expanded them significantly using even better contacts in the world of English theatre than Ellis enjoyed. Cremorne was Coppin's indulgence and hobby and he poured money into them without applying business acumen. For a time he lived on site. The residence had been built by the Colonial Architect, Henry Ginn, who had originally established the gardens as part of his up-river retreat in the mid-1840s. Entertainment provided included a Cyclorama, bowling alley, menagerie, dancers and nightly fireworks. Coppin continued the presentation of the annual panoramas introduced by Ellis. Patrons arrived by riverboat or by train at the purpose built railway station. The gardens were notable as being the location of the first balloon flight in Australia when in 1858 Englishman William Dean floated seven miles (11 km) north to Brunswick. In 1859 Coppin imported six camels from Aden as exhibits for the Cremorne Gardens menagerie and in 1860 he sold them to the Exploration Committee of the Royal Society of Victoria who used them on the Burke and Wills expedition. George Coppin went bankrupt in 1863 and the gardens were closed. The land was sold and became an asylum which itself closed in the 1880s. The land was then subdivided for housing by Thomas Bent. With the turn of the century much of the housing gave way to small and large industrial establishments but much of the small working class housing remains today and has been progressively gentrified. A small park is at the southern end of the area previously occupied by the gardens and a plaque marks their location and the place from which the hot air balloons were launched. The site of the gardens no longer fronts the river because of the construction of the South Eastern Freeway in 1961. The area of Richmond in which the gardens were located was formally renamed Cremorne in 1999 and is used by locals as much out of historical respect as to avoid the old working class implications of the name Richmond. A view of Cremorne from South Yarra can be found in the works of S. T. Gill and the site is described in Louisa Ann Meredith's description of her stay in Melbourne with her husband and son in Over the straits: a visit to Victoria.

He adopted the pseudonym Trist√£o de Ata√≠de in 1919. In 1928 he converted to Catholicism and eventually became head of Catholic Action in Brazil. Although he initially had some sympathy for certain aims of Brazilian integralism he became a strong opponent of authoritarianism in general and Fascism in particular. That came in part through the influence of Jacques Maritain. He was a staunch advocate for press freedom during the period of military dictatorship. Biography Born into a middle-class family in Rio, Alceu Amoroso Lima was \\"atheist and Jacobin\\" studying at college Pedro II, obtaining a law degree in 1913. Influenced by positivism, he traveled to Paris, but the shock of the First World War led him to get away from it, under the influence of Jackson de Figueiredo, G. K. Chesterton and Jacques Maritain. After a dispute with the converted Jackson de Figueiredo, in favor of a \\"intransigent Catholicism\\" (with modernism), Lima converted to Catholicism in 1928, that event recounted in Adeus √† disponibilidade e outros adeuses (1968). The same year he became leader of Dom Vital Center, founded by Figueiredo and broadcast anti-communist and anti-liberal anti-modernist ideas. He made his literary criticism under the pseudonym of Trist√£o de Ata√≠de, he was also manager of the company Cometa, inherited from his father. He married Maria Teresa de Faria, the daughter of the writer Alberto Faria. He was secretary of the Catholic Electoral League, created by the Cardinal Archbishop of Rio Sebasti√£o Leme da Silveira Cintra to act in the political sphere (without a party) with the approach of elections in 1933.. Lima also chaired the National Junta of Catholic Action, founded in 1935, until 1945, and founded the Catholic Institute of Advanced Studies in 1932 and the Universidade Santa √örsula (private) in Rio in 1937. He went in 1935 to the Academia Brasileira de Letras, obtained in 1964 the Juca Pato Prize and Jabuti Literature Prize in 1979. In 1930 Amoroso Lima was close to Brazilian Integralism, the fascist movement of Pl√≠nio Salgado; he parted under the influence of Jacques Maritain, with whom he corresponded. He, then, made statements tinted with Antisemitism. sq. Alceu Lima was one of the founders of the Christian Democrat Organization of America (ODCA) in 1947, alongside, among others, the future Chilean President Eduardo Frei Montalva. One of the representatives of Brazil at the Second Vatican Council, with the Archbishop H√©lder C√¢mara, he was one of the founders of the Brazilian Christian Democracy. From 1967 to 1972 he was a member of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. He was professor of Sociology at the Normal school of Rio, of Political economy at the Faculty of Law and Brazilian literature at the University of Brazil and the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, then rector of the University of the Federal District and president of the Center Dom Vital between 1928 and 1968. He was also a member of the Conselho Nacional de Educa√ß√£o. Lima lived in France, lectured on \\"Brazilian civilization\\" to the Sorbonne (building), and in the United States in the early 1950s. Under the Brazilian military government (1964‚Äì85), he strongly criticized censorship.

LNT) is a device that is used to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NO and NO2) emissions from a lean burn internal combustion engine by means of adsorption. Purpose and function of a adsorber A adsorber is designed to reduce oxides of nitrogen emitted in the exhaust gas of a lean burn internal combustion engine. Lean burn engines, particularly diesels, present a special challenge to emission control system designers because of the relatively high levels of O2 (atmospheric oxygen) in the exhaust gas. The 3-way catalytic converter that has been successfully used since the 1980s on stoichiometric engines (such as fueled by petrol, LPG, CNG, or ethanol) will not function at O2 levels in excess of 1.0%, and does not function well at levels above 0.5%. Because of the increasing need to limit emissions from diesel engines, technologies such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) have been used, however EGR is of limited effectiveness and SCR requires a continuous supply of reductant to the exhaust. The adsorber was designed to avoid the problems that EGR and SCR experienced. An adsorbant such as zeolite traps the NO and NO2 molecules ‚Äî acting as a molecular sponge. Once the trap is full (like a sponge full of water) no more can be absorbed. Various schemes have been designed to \\"purge\\" or \\"regenerate\\" the trap. One of possible reactants used to this aim is diesel fuel. Injection of diesel fuel before the adsorber can purge it ‚Äî the is made to desorb and react with hydrocarbons under rich conditions to produce water and nitrogen. Also hydrogen is a good reductant, but is dangerous and difficult to store. Some experimental systems have used fuel reformers for on- board hydrogen generation. Market use A trap is used on the Volkswagen Jetta TDI and the Volkswagen Tiguan concepts. Both are projected to be introduced into the American market by 2008. They were to be marketed as part of the BlueTec program from Audi, Daimler-Chrysler, and Volkswagen. In 2015 an ADAC study (ordered by ICCT) of 32 Euro6 cars showed that few complied with on-road emission limits, and LNT cars had the highest emissions.NOx control technologies for Euro 6 diesel passenger cars Technical details The adsorber is based on a monolithic catalyst support that has been coated with a adsorbing washcoat such as one containing zeolites. Alkali/alkaline oxide (carbonate) can also be used as the adsorbant. Traps are gradually poisoned by SOx which adsorbs more strongly than . It necessitates a periodic high temperature regeneration that tends to reduce the adsorber's operating life.

Los Angeles Times 04 July 1969: c13. The film tells the story of a young man's struggle to reclaim his life after fighting in the Vietnam War. It tells a surreal, allegorical tale, similarly to The Swimmer starring Burt Lancaster. Written by actor Stuart Margolin, the film is notable as being one of the first films to deal with the subject matter of Vietnam veterans \\"coming home\\".Jeremy M. Devine, Vietnam at 24 Frames a Second: A Critical and Thematic Analysis of Over 400 Films about the Vietnam War (University of Texas Press, 1999), , p. 57. Excerpts available at Google Books. It is also noted for its unusual casting, which placed a number of noted musical artists in key acting roles. Plot summary Lee Majors, in his first lead acting role, stars as Andy Crocker, a soldier who is wounded in a firefight in Vietnam and awarded the Purple Heart. After leaving his best friend David (Marvin Gaye), he meets a young hippie girl (Jill Haworth) who invites him to a party. The men at the party (Peter Haskell, Stuart Margolin) do not want him present; Crocker leaves and returns their hospitality by stealing one of their motorcycles that he rides home to Dallas, Texas where he reunites with his parents (played by Pat Hingle and Claudia Bryar). Crocker says that all that kept him going during the trials of Vietnam was his dreams of running a motorcycle racing track and repair shop and marrying his sweetheart, Lisa (Joey Heatherton). Crocker, however, soon discovers that his friends and loved ones have moved on while he was in Vietnam. Lisa has married another man (her \\"Dear John\\" letter to Andy apparently never received), and a friend entrusted to take care of the unsuccessful motorcycle track business and repair shop (Mack, played by Jimmy Dean) has made arrangements to sell it out from under Andy. An attempt at rekindling his relationship with Lisa ends in disaster. Ultimately, Andy finds himself running afoul of Lisa's family (particularly her rich mother, played by Agnes Moorehead, who offers Andy a loan to help save the racetrack as long as he leaves town), and the law after he punches Mack for betraying him. Fleeing from the Dallas area, Andy eventually finds himself in San Francisco where he briefly reunites with his old army friend David. Afterwards, realizing he has nowhere else to go, he sits down in front of a U.S. Army Recruiting Office and waits for the doors to open. Also appearing in the film is Bobby Hatfield of The Righteous Brothers as a restaurant owner. The title of the film refers to a song (co-written by Margolin) that recurs throughout the film as \\"Greek chorus\\" to the events unfolding. Singer/songwriter Murray MacLeod sang the title song and wrote the music.

The Tree of Porphyry is a classic device for illustrating what is also called a \\"scale of being\\". It was suggested‚Äîif not first, then most famously in the European philosophical tradition‚Äîby the 3rd century CE Greek neoplatonist philosopher and logician Porphyry.James Franklin, \\"Aristotle on Species Variation\\", Philosophy, 61:236 (April 1986), pp. 245-252. It is also known as scala praedicamentalis. Porphyry suggests the Porphyrian tree in his introduction (in Greek, \\"Isagoge\\") to Aristotle's Categories. Porphyry presented Aristotle's classification of categories in a way that was later adopted into tree-like diagrams of two-way divisions, which indicate that a species is defined by a genus and a differentia and that this logical process continues until the lowest species is reached, which can no longer be so defined. No illustrations or diagrams occur in editions of Porphyry's original work. But, diagrams were eventually made, and became associated with the scheme that Porphyry describes, following Aristotle. Porphyry's Isagoge was originally written in Greek, but was translated into Latin in the early 6th century CE by Boethius. Boethius's translation became the standard philosophical logic textbook in the Middle Ages.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Medieval Theories of the Categories Until the late 19th century, theories of categories based on Porphyry's work were still being taught to students of logic. The following very helpful passage by philosopher James Franklin gives some hint as to the history of the Porphyrian tree: :In medieval education, the standard introduction to Aristotle's works was via Porphyry's Isagoge, and division entered the educated consciousness in the form of 'Porphyry's Tree'. It is not clear that Porphyry himself, in the relevant passage,Franklin's note: \\"Porphyry, Isagoge, trans. E. W. Warren (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1975), 34.\\" went any further than Aristotle in recommending division. But his brief comment was developed into the Tree by medieval logicians. It appears in William of Sherwood's Introduction to Logic and is given the name arbor Porphyrii in the most popular medieval logic, Peter of Spain's Summulae Logicales.Franklin's note: \\"N. Kretzmann, William of Sherwood's Introduction to Logic (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1966), 54; Peter of Spain, Summulae Logicales, I. M. Boche≈Ñski (ed.) (Turin: Marietti, 1947), 17-18.\\" Linnaeus's system of static and discrete species was simply the result of filling in the abstract Tree with the names of actual species.James Franklin, \\"Aristotle on Species Variation\\", Philosophy, 61:236 (April 1986), pp. 245-252. The passage quoted here is from pp. 251-252. Thus, the notion of the Porphyrian tree as an actual diagram comes later than Porphyry himself. Still, scholars do speak of Porphyry's tree as in the Isagoge and they mean by this only that the idea of dividing genera into species via differentiae is found in the Isagoge. But, of course, Porphyry was only following what was already in Aristotle, and Aristotle was following what was already in his teacher, Plato.A number of Plato's dialogs contain the idea of division in them: see Sophist, Philebus, Statesman, Republic (book VII), and Parmenides for starters.  Example  The following Porphyrian tree consists of three columns of words; the middlemost (in boldface) contains the series of genera and species, and we can take as analogous to the trunk of a tree. The extremes (the terms that jut out to the left and right), containing the differentiae, we can take as analogous to the branches of a tree: This image is an illustration of the notion of a Porphyrian Tree as it comes down to us today through the European philosophical and logical tradition. The diagram shows the highest genus to be substance. (Whether substance is a highest genus, really, is not in question here: right now we are only going to discuss what the diagram shows, not whether what it shows is true or false.) The technical term for a highest substance is summum genus. So, substance is the summum genus as far as this diagram goes. The diagram shows that the genus substance have two differentia, namely, \\"thinking\\" and \\"extended\\". This indicates that there are two species of the genus substance, thinking substance and extended substance. The diagram does not give a term for the species of thinking substance (this would be \\"mind\\"), but it does give the term for the species of extended substance, namely, body. That is, body is a species of the genus substance; body is that species of the genus substance that is extended. Now that we have seen body as a species of substance, we treat body as a genus itself. As a genus, it has two differentia of its own, inanimate and animate. So, there are two species of body, inanimate body and animate body. The diagram does not tell us what the term for inanimate body is, but it indicates a term for animate body, namely, animal. Animal is an animate species of the genus body. And, again, now that we have looked at animal as a species of the genus body, we look at animal now as a genus and consider its differentia, which are shown on the diagram to be irrational and rational. Thus, according to the diagram there are two species of the genus animal, irrational animal and rational animal. We are not told by the diagram what a term for irrational animal is, but the diagram indicates that a rational animal is a human. Thus, human is a rational species of the genus animal. Beneath human, however, there are no further species. \\"This\\" and \\"that\\" if they are considered differentiae, are of a special kind that map the species human not onto a new species but onto particular humans.,For a discussion of \\"this\\" and \\"that\\" as universals/differentia, see G. W. F. Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, \\"A. Consciousness\\", \\"I. Sense-Certainty: or the 'this' and 'meaning' [Meinen]\\", translated by A. V. Miller, Oxford University Press, pp. 58-66. The particular human Plato is named in the diagram. Plato is not a species (that is why his name is not in bold, unlike the species above). So, human is the lowest species in this diagram. The technical name for the lowest species in such a scheme is the infima species. So, for this diagram, human is the infima species.

It is one of eight radio stations in the Youngstown market owned by Cumulus Media with studios in \\"The Radio Center\\" in Youngstown. History The station was founded in 1947 as WFMJ-FM by William F. Maag, Jr. from whose initials the call letters were derived. Maag was also publisher of The Youngstown Vindicator, and owned WFMJ(AM), and WFMJ-TV. WFMJ- FM was issued a construction permit in 1947, but the station did not go on the air until January 1950. Only a few years later, WFMJ Broadcasting Company requested that the FCC cancel the WFMJ-FM license, which they agreed to do on January 5, 1954. WSOM-FM, a new station in Salem, OH signed on the air on November 25, 1958. WSOM-FM was owned by Salem Broadcasting Company. WSOM-FM's call was changed to WQXK in January 1980, which was done shortly after Rust Communications Group purchased the station and sister station WSOM(AM) on December 13, 1979. This was the first of many ownership changes that occurred over the next several years. WQXK has been nominated numerous times for CMA Small Market Radio Station of the Year. WQXK took home the prestigious award in November 2004. Grandfathered status The station broadcasts 88,000 watts, which exceeds the FCC's current maximum power output, but it is grandfathered from the power limitation by virtue of its being in operation before the limit was introduced. The transmitter is located between Salem and Leetonia, OH on St. Rt. 344, just outside the Salem city limits. The most powerful station in the region, it covers not only Youngstown but also the Akron/Canton, Cleveland, Erie, Pittsburgh, and Wheeling/Steubenville markets. Because of the station's strong signal, WQXK is the highest-rated station in the Youngstown market, often attracting out-of-market listeners. K105's signal can be picked up clearly in over 20 counties in 3 states (Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia). It is not out of the question for it to be picked up in eastern suburbs of Columbus, when weather conditions are in favor. The station primarily competes with the Froggy stations for country music listeners. Those Froggy stations include WGYY 100.3 Meadville, PA & WOGI 104.3 East Liverpool, OH/Beaver Falls, PA. To a lesser extent, the station also competes with out- of-market stations such as WDSY-FM owing to WQXK's strong signal. Also, other stations in competition range are WQMX 94.9 Akron, OH, WYLE 95.1 New Castle, PA, WTUZ 99.9 New Philadelphia, OH, WOVK 98.7 Wheeling, WV, W259BW 99.7 Canton, WGAR 99.5 Cleveland, OH and WBBG 106.1 Niles, OH. K105 won the CMA Small Market Radio Station of the year award in 2004. K105 is also a participant in the Country Cares for Kids St. Jude Radiothon.

She was the daughter of Ollie Lee and Mae (n√©e Goddard) Hudson. While in Oklahoma, she studied dancing, drama, piano, and voice. She began her acting career as a teenager, and completed her high school education at a high school on the Fox studios lot. Career Hudson signed a contract with RKO Pictures on November 22, 1930, when she was 14 years old. She may be best remembered today for costarring in Wild Boys of the Road (1933), playing Cosette in Les Mis√©rables (1935), playing Mary Blair, the older sister of Shirley Temple's character in Curly Top, and for playing Natalie Wood's mother in Rebel Without a Cause (1955). During her peak years in the 1930s, notable roles for Hudson included Richard Cromwell's love interest in the Will Rogers showcase Life Begins at 40 (1935), the daughter of carnival barker W.C. Fields in Poppy (1936), and Claudette Colbert's adult daughter in Imitation of Life (1934). She played Sally Glynn, the fallen ingenue to whom Mae West imparts the immortal wisdom \\"When women go wrong, men go right after them!\\" in the 1933 Paramount film, She Done Him Wrong.

Personal life Rochelle Hudson in Argentina magazine Hudson was married four times. Her first marriage was to Harold Thompson, in 1939. He was the head of the Storyline Department at Disney Studios. After their divorce in 1947, (but the trade publication Billboard reported that they divorced on September 4, 1945) she married a second time the following year to Los Angeles Times sportswriter Dick Irving Hyland. The marriage lasted two years before the couple divorced. She married her third husband, Charles K. Brust, in Jackson, Missouri on September 28, 1956. Little is known of the marriage other than they were divorced by June 1962 (he remarried). Her final marriage was to Robert Mindell, a hotel executive. The two remained together for eight years before they divorced in 1971. She actually was born in 1916, but the studio reportedly made her two years older for her to play a wider variety of roles, including romantic roles.

The airframe is constructed of titanium and high-strength aluminium alloys. The engine intake ramps and nacelles are fitted with trouser fairings to provide a continuous streamlined profile between the nacelles and the tail beams. The fins and horizontal tail consoles are attached to tail beams. The central beam section between the engine nacelles consists of the equipment compartment, fuel tank and the brake parachute container. The fuselage head is of semi-monocoque construction and includes the cockpit, radar compartments and the avionics bay. Su-30MKI aerodynamic configuration is a longitudinal triplane with relaxed stability. The canard increases the aircraft lift ability and deflects automatically to allow high angle of attack (AoA) flights allowing it to perform Pugachev's Cobra. The integral aerodynamic configuration combined with thrust vectoring results in extremely capable manoeuvrability, taking off and landing characteristics. This high agility allows rapid deployment of weapons in any direction as desired by the crew. The canard notably assists in controlling the aircraft at large angles-of- attack and bringing it to a level flight condition. The aircraft has a fly-by- wire (FBW) with quadruple redundancy. Dependent on flight conditions, signals from the control stick position transmitter or the FCS may be coupled to remote control amplifiers and combined with feedback signals from acceleration sensors and rate gyros. The resultant control signals are coupled to the high- speed electro-hydraulic actuators of the elevators, rudders and the canard. The output signals are compared and, if the difference is significant, the faulty channel is disconnected. FBW is based on a stall warning and barrier mechanism which prevents stalls through dramatic increases of control stick pressure, allowing a pilot to effectively control the aircraft without exceeding the angle of attack and acceleration limitations. Although the maximum angle of attack is limited by the canards, the FBW acts as an additional safety mechanism. The Su-30MKI has a range of 3,000 km with internal fuel which ensures a 3.75 hour combat mission. Also, it has an in- flight refueling (IFR) probe that retracts beside the cockpit during normal operation. The air refueling system increases the flight duration up to 10 hours with a range of 8,000 km at a cruise height of 11 to 13 km. Su-30MKIs can also use the Cobham 754 buddy refueling pods.\\"Su-30–ú–ö ‚Äì Aircraft performance.\\" Sukhoi.org.

The Su-30MKI's radar cross-section (RCS) is reportedly from 4 to 20 square metres. Cockpit The displays include a customised version of the Israeli Elbit Su 967 head-up display (HUD) consisting of bi-cubic phase conjugated holographic displays and seven multifunction liquid-crystal displays, six 127 mm √ó 127 mm and one 152 mm √ó 152 mm. Flight information is displayed on four LCD displays which include one for piloting and navigation, a tactical situation indicator, and two for display systems information including operating modes and overall status. Variants of this HUD have also been chosen for the IAF's Mikoyan MiG-27 and SEPECAT Jaguar upgrades for standardisation. The rear cockpit has a larger monochrome display for air-to-surface missile guidance. The Su-30MKI on-board health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) monitors almost every aircraft system and sub-system, and can also act as an engineering data recorder. From 2010, indigenously designed and built HUDs and Multi-Function Displays (MFD) were produced by the Delhi-based Samtel Group Display Systems.\\"IAF order worth Rs 250 cr to Indian industry.\\" Business-standard.com, 21 October 2010.

N011M has a 400 km search range and a maximum 200 km tracking range, and 60 km in the rear hemisphere.Jane's Radar And Electronic Walfare Systems, p. 2089. The radar can track 15 air targets and engage 4 simultaneously. These targets can even include cruise missiles and motionless helicopters. The Su-30MKI can function as a mini-AWACS as a director or command post for other aircraft. The target co-ordinates can be transferred automatically to at least four other aircraft. The radar can detect ground targets such as tanks at 40‚Äì50 km. The Bars radar will be replaced by Zhuk-AESA in all Su-30MKI aircraft.Kopp, Dr, Carlo. \\"Phazotron Zhuk AE: Assessing Russia's First AESA.\\" ausairpower.net, April 2012.

Phase 3 of further development of the MKI, will integrate avionic systems being developed for the Indo-Russian Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft programme.\\"India, Russia certify latest Sukhoi fighter configuration: Jane's.\\" Outlookindia.com. Retrieved: 16 December 2010. Sukhoi Su-30MKI has electronic counter-measure systems. The RWR system is of Indian design, developed by India's DRDO, called Tarang, (Wave in English). It has direction finding capability and is known to have a programmable threat library. The RWR is derived from work done on an earlier system for India's MiG-23BNs known as the Tranquil, which is now superseded by the more advanced Tarang series. Elta EL/M-8222 a self-protection jammer developed by Israel Aircraft Industries is the MKI's standard EW pod, which the Israeli Air Force uses on its F-15s. The ELTA El/M-8222 Self Protection Pod is a power-managed jammer, air-cooled system with an ESM receiver integrated into the pod. The pod contains an antenna on the forward and aft ends, which receive the hostile RF signal and after processing deliver the appropriate response. Propulsion The Su-30MKI is powered by two Lyulka-Saturn AL-31FP turbofans, each rated at 12,500 kgf (27,550 lbf) of full after-burning thrust, which enable speeds of up to Mach 2 in horizontal flight and a rate of climb of 230 m/s. The mean time between overhaul is reportedly 1,000 hours with a full-life span of 3,000 hours; the titanium nozzle has a mean time between overhaul of 500 hours. In early 2015, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar stated before Parliament that the AL-31FP had suffered numerous failures, between the end of 2012 and early 2015, a total of 69 Su-30MKI engine-related failures had occurred; commons causes were bearing failures due to metal fatigue and low oil pressure, in response several engine modifications were made to improve lubrication, as well as the use of higher quality oil and adjustments to the fitting of bearings.Bedi, Rahul. \\"India defence minister admits Su-30 serviceability issues.\\" IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, 18 March 2015. The Su-30MKI's AL-31FP powerplant built on the earlier AL-31FU, adding two-plane thrust vectoring nozzles are mounted 32 degrees outward to longitudinal engine axis (i.e. in the horizontal plane) and can be deflected ¬±15 degrees in one plane. The canting allows the aircraft to produce both roll and yaw by vectoring each engine nozzle differently; this allows the aircraft to create thrust vectoring moments about all three rotational axes, pitch, yaw and roll. Engine thrust is adjusted via a conventional engine throttle lever as opposed to a strain-gauge engine control stick. The aircraft is controlled by a standard control stick. The pilot can activate a switch for performing difficult maneuvers; while this is enabled, the computer automatically determines the deflection angles of the swiveling nozzles and aerodynamic surfaces.Gal-Or, Benjamin (2011). \\"Future Jet Technologies\\".

According to the legend, in 1917, at the age of 15, after a fire in New York City started by candles suspended in a tree, Sadacca adapted the novelty lighting that his parents sold for use in Christmas trees. A similar story is told about Ralph E. Morris, who created an electric light set using a telephone switchboard in 1908. Earlier electric Christmas tree lights had been used in 1885 in Grover Cleveland's White House, and in 1882 at the home of Edward H. Johnson, a vice- president of the Edison Electric Light Company. Other sources indicate that Albert and his brothers, Henri and Leon, founded their business in 1914 (three years before the fire, when Albert would presumably have been only 12 years old). Nevertheless, in 1925, Sadacca's company, enjoying success in the new Christmas light business, proposed that several companies then competing for the market join together as a trade organization. The name of the organization was The National Outfit Manufacturer's Association. The association merged into a single company the following year, and began several decades of dominance in the rapidly growing Christmas lighting market as the NOMA Electric Company.

They were a part of PS Company until 2014. The band had King Records as its record label until 2010, when they joined Tokuma Japan. Then, in 2013, the band joined Universal Music Group's Nayutawave Records. They shortened their name to A9 in 2015, but switched back to Alice Nine in 2019. Alice Nine has released six full-length records, some of which were distributed in Europe by CLJ Records, along with several EPs, singles, and DVDs. History=2004‚Äì2006: Conception and early work In August 2004, Alice Nine formed after the disbandment of the band Givuss, and the band's vocalist, Shou, and guitarist Tora continued on to search for members to form a new band. Saga, the bassist for the band Delta Ark, and Nao, drummer for the bands Fatima and RusH, were also seeking bandmates as well, and the four members eventually joined together. Hiroto was the last member to join after Shou, Tora, Saga, and Nao spotted him at a performance with his band at the time, Baquepia. Shou explains that the \\"Alice\\" in the band's name was something that they believed sounded \\"very visual kei\\" to them, while the \\"Nine\\" is written in kanji and represents their origins as a Japanese band. Their first concert was held at the Ikebukuro Cyber on May 11, 2004 and soon after they released their first single, Namae wa, Mada Nai in July, and they soon toured with fellow PS Company band BIS. In November, their first EP, Gion Shouja no Kane ga Naru, was released, and later that month, they did a nationwide tour with the band Karen from Under Code Productions. In 2005, the pace of CD releases increased; the band released the singles \\"Gin no Tsuki Kuroi Hoshi,\\" \\"Yami ni Chiru Sakura,\\" and \\"Yuri wa Aoku Saite\\" consecutively for three months. These singles were eventually compiled onto their first major EP, Kasou Musou Shi, through a joint deal with PS Company and King Records. Alice Nine also went on tour with several bands throughout the year, including Ayabie, Kra, and Kagrra. Following these events, the band had its first solo tour, Alice in Wonder Tour, in August that year. They released their first album Zekkeishoku in April 2006. 2007: Alpha and mainstream success The band's vocalist, Show (Shou). A turning point for the band came when the single \\"Jewels\\" was released in March 2007. The single allowed the band to land their first magazine cover and feature article with volume 171 of Shoxx Magazine. Later that month on April 28, the band released Dive into the Sun, a photobook that included an exclusive CD containing the song \\"Gekkou Yoku.\\" Another landmark was Alice Nine's first performance outside Japan at the JRock Revolution festival in Los Angeles, California on May 25, 2007. They joined with several other Japanese bands and became the closing performance of the Friday that weekend. The release of the \\"White Prayer\\" single in June marked another milestone for the band's development; vocalist Show explained in an interview with Shoxx Magazine that the song defined the style that the band was aiming for and hoped to maintain in the future. The process of the song's creation also came about more naturally than usual, as many songs until then were made through trial and error. Later that year, on October 24, the group's single \\"Tsubasa\\" was released and peaked at number six on the Oricon charts, making it one of their successful singles to date and landing the band a guest appearance on the Fuji Television variety show Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ for the first time. On November 28, 2007, their second full-length album, Alpha, was released. The title for the album originated as a means to describe the band's return to their roots and beginning anew. The uppercase first letter of the Greek alphabet, Œë, was chosen to symbolize this idea. Aside from the singles to be compiled onto the album, recording for songs began in September and lasted for approximately one month. The album reached the ninth position on the Oricon weekly chart, selling over 17,000 copies in its first week. 2008: Vandalize Alice Nine started off the year with another tour, alice nine. 2008 standing tour \\"A to U\\". However, complications arose when guitarist Tora was diagnosed with a spinal disc hernia, which had worsened over time to the point of numbness throughout the left side of his body. Finally seeking medical help, the tour had to be postponed until Tora recovered enough for the band to resume activities in Tokyo. The band released a new single, titled \\"Mirror Ball\\" on March 26, 2008. The title song of the single was used in the live-action movie adaptation of the manga Aquarian Age. Two compilations of the band's music videos, \\"Alice in Pictures I\\" and \\"Alice in Pictures II\\", were released on July 2, 2008. The DVDs contain approximately 8 music videos in chronological order of their original release, with \\"Alice in Pictures I\\" including the videos from \\"Gin no Tsuki Kuroi Hoshi\\" to \\"Number Six\\". \\"Alice in Pictures II\\" contains videos from \\"Jewels\\" to \\"Eraser -Memoire d'une fleur-\\", and also includes a new music video for \\"Gekkou Yoku\\", a song which was exclusively included with the \\"Dive into the Sun\\" photobook. On August 6, the band released their latest single, \\"Rainbows.\\" The single reached a peak mark of No. 3 on the Japanese Oricon daily charts which is currently the band's current top position on mainstream Japanese charts. The band also started their tour called \\"Discotheque play like 'A' Rainbows\\" which coincided with the new single. The tour lasted the entire month, and the concert footage was released on their live DVD, Discotheque play like \\"A\\" Rainbows -enter&exit-;, on October 29, 2008. The band's fourteenth maxi-single, \\"Cross Game,\\" was released on December 10, 2008. The title song was used as the ending theme song for the second season of the anime Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D'S and was released in two versions. On December 19, 2008, the band's tour at the time culminated in the grand final, named \\"Crossing the Supernova\\", at NHK Hall. A blog entry by vocalist Show announced that the band was in recording sessions for a third album named Vandalize, which was released on January 14, 2009. \\"Cross Game\\" is the third single to be featured on the album, along with \\"Mirror Ball\\" and \\"Rainbows\\" for a total of 11 tracks.

POVMs are a generalisation of projection-valued measures (PVM) and, correspondingly, quantum measurements described by POVMs are a generalisation of quantum measurement described by PVMs (called projective measurements). In rough analogy, a POVM is to a PVM what a mixed state is to a pure state. Mixed states are needed to specify the state of a subsystem of a larger system (see purification of quantum state); analogously, POVMs are necessary to describe the effect on a subsystem of a projective measurement performed on a larger system. POVMs are the most general kind of measurement in quantum mechanics, and can also be used in quantum field theory. They are extensively used in the field of quantum information.  Definition  In the simplest case, of a POVM with a finite number of elements acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, a POVM is a set of positive semi-definite matrices {F_i} on a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H} that sum to the identity matrix,M. Nielsen and I. Chuang, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, Cambridge University Press, (2000) :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n F_i = \\\\operatorname{I}. In quantum mechanics, the POVM element F_i is associated with the measurement outcome i, such that the probability of obtaining it when making a measurement on the quantum state \\\\rho is given by :\\\\text{Prob}(i) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\rho F_i) , where \\\\operatorname{tr} is the trace operator. When the quantum state being measured is a pure state \\\\psi\\\\rangle this formula reduces to :\\\\text{Prob}(i) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi F_i) = \\\\langle\\\\psiF_i\\\\psi\\\\rangle. The simplest case of a POVM generalises the simplest case of a PVM, which is a set of orthogonal projectors {\\\\Pi_i} that sum to the identity matrix: :\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\Pi_i = \\\\operatorname{I}, \\\\quad \\\\Pi_i \\\\Pi_j = \\\\delta_{i j} \\\\Pi_i. The probability formulas for a PVM are the same as for the POVM. An important difference is that the elements of a POVM are not necessarily orthogonal. As a consequence, the number of elements n of the POVM can be larger than the dimension of the Hilbert space they act in. On the other hand, the number of elements N of the PVM is at most the dimension of the Hilbert space. In general, POVMs can also be defined in situations where the number of elements and the dimension of the Hilbert space is not finite: Definition. Let (X, M) be measurable space; that is M is a œÉ-algebra of subsets of X. A POVM is a function F defined on M whose values are bounded non-negative self- adjoint operators on a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H} such that F(X) = \\\\operatorname{I}_{\\\\mathcal{H}} and for every \\\\psi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}, : E \\\\mapsto \\\\langle F(E) \\\\psi \\\\mid \\\\psi \\\\rangle \\\\ (\\\\text{for every } E \\\\in M) is a non-negative countably additive measure on the œÉ-algebra M. Its key property is that it determines a probability measure on the outcome space, so that \\\\langle F(E) \\\\psi \\\\mid \\\\psi \\\\rangle can be interpreted as the probability (density) of outcome E when making a measurement on the quantum state  \\\\psi \\\\rangle. This definition should be contrasted with that of the projection- valued measure, which is similar, except that for projection-valued measures, the values of F are required to be projection operators.  Naimark's dilation theorem  :Note: An alternate spelling of this is \\"Neumark's Theorem\\" Naimark's dilation theoremI. M. Gelfand and M. A. Neumark, On the embedding of normed rings into the ring of operators in Hilbert space, Rec. Math. [Mat. Sbornik] N.S. 12(54) (1943), 197‚Äì213. shows how POVMs can be obtained from PVMs acting on a larger space. This result is of critical importance in quantum mechanics, as it gives a way to physically realize POVM measurements.A. Peres. Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1993. In the simplest case, of a POVM with a finite number of elements acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, Naimark's theorem says that if {F_i}_{i=1}^n is a POVM acting on a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H}_A of dimension d_A, then there exists a PVM {\\\\Pi_i}_{i=1}^n acting on a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H}_{A'} of dimension d_{A'} and an isometry V : \\\\mathcal{H}_A \\\\to \\\\mathcal{H}_{A'} such that for all i : F_i = V^\\\\dagger \\\\Pi_i V One way to construct such a PVM and isometryJ. Preskill, Lecture Notes for Physics: Quantum Information and Computation, Chapter 3, http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/preskill/ph229/#lectureJ. Watrous, Lecture Notes for Theory of Quantum Information, Lecture 5, https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/LectureNotes.html is to let \\\\mathcal{H}_{A'} = \\\\mathcal{H}_{A}\\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{H}_{B}, \\\\Pi_i = \\\\operatorname{I}_A \\\\otimes i\\\\rangle\\\\langle i_B, and : V = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sqrt{F_i}_A \\\\otimes {i\\\\rangle}_B Note that in this construction the dimension of the larger Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H}_{A'} is given by d_{A'} = nd_A. This is not the minimum possible, as a more complicated construction gives d_{A'} = n (assuming that n \\\\ge d_A. This construction can be turned into a recipe for a physical realisation of the POVM by extending the isometry V into a unitary U, that is, finding U such that : V = U(\\\\operatorname{I}_A \\\\otimes 0\\\\rangle_B). This can always be done. The recipe for realizing the POVM measurement described by {F_i}_{i=1}^n on a quantum state \\\\rho is then to prepare an ancilla in the state 0\\\\rangle_B, evolve it together with \\\\rho through the unitary U, and make the projective measurement on the ancilla described by the PVM {i\\\\rangle\\\\langle i_B}_{i=1}^n. It is then easy to see that the probability of obtaining outcome i with this method is the same as the probability of obtaining it with the original POVM. That is, : \\\\text{Prob}(i) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\rho F_i) = \\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\left( \\\\operatorname{I}_A \\\\otimes i\\\\rangle\\\\langle i_B \\\\left[U \\\\rho_A \\\\otimes 0\\\\rangle\\\\langle 0_B U^\\\\dagger\\\\right]\\\\right).  Post-measurement state  The post-measurement state is not determined by the POVM itself, but rather by the PVM that physically realizes it. Since there are infinitely many different PVMs that realize the same POVM, the operators {F_i}_{i=1}^n alone do not determine what the post-measurement state will be. To see that, note that for any unitary W the operators :M_i = W\\\\sqrt{F_i} will also have the property that M_i^\\\\dagger M_i = F_i , so that using the isometry : V_W = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n {M_i}_A \\\\otimes {i\\\\rangle}_B in the above construction will also implement the same POVM. In the case where the state being measure is in a pure state \\\\psi\\\\rangle_A, the resulting unitary U_W takes it together with the ancilla to state : U_W(\\\\psi\\\\rangle_A 0\\\\rangle_B) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n M_i \\\\psi\\\\rangle_A i\\\\rangle_B, and the projective measurement on the ancilla will collapse \\\\psi\\\\rangle_A to the state : \\\\psi'\\\\rangle_A = \\\\frac{M_{i_0} \\\\psi\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\langle \\\\psi M_{i_0}^\\\\dagger M_{i_0}  \\\\psi \\\\rangle}} on obtaining result i_0. When the state being measure is described by a density matrix \\\\rho_A, the corresponding post-measurement state is given by :\\\\rho'_A = {M_{i_0} \\\\rho M_{i_0}^\\\\dagger \\\\over {\\\\rm tr}(M_{i_0} \\\\rho M_{i_0}^\\\\dagger)}. We see therefore that the post-measurement state depends explicitly on the unitary W. Another difference from the projective measurements is that a POVM measurement is in general not repeatable. If on the first measurement result i_0 was obtained, the probability of obtaining a different result i_1 on a second measurement is :\\\\text{Prob}(i_1i_0) = {\\\\operatorname{tr}(M_{i_1}M_{i_0} \\\\rho M_{i_0}^\\\\dagger M_{i_1}^\\\\dagger) \\\\over {\\\\rm tr}(M_{i_0} \\\\rho M_{i_0}^\\\\dagger)}, which can be nonzero if M_{i_0} and M_{i_1} are not orthogonal. In a projective measurement these operators are always orthogonal and therefore the measurement is always repeatable.  An example: unambiguous quantum state discrimination  1\\\\rangle)/\\\\sqrt2. Note that on the Bloch sphere orthogonal states are antiparallel. Suppose you have a quantum system of dimension 2 that you know is in either the state \\\\psi\\\\rangle or the state \\\\varphi\\\\rangle, and you want to determine which one it is. If \\\\psi\\\\rangle and \\\\varphi\\\\rangle are orthogonal, this task is easy: the set {\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi,\\\\varphi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\varphi} will form a PVM, and a projective measurement in this basis will determine the state with certainty. If, however, \\\\psi\\\\rangle and \\\\varphi\\\\rangle are not orthogonal, this task is impossible, in the sense that there is no measurement, either PVM or POVM, that will distinguish them with certainty. The impossibility of perfectly discriminating between non-orthogonal states is the basis for quantum information protocols such as quantum cryptography, quantum coin flipping, and quantum money. The task of unambiguous quantum state discrimination (UQSD) is the next best thing: to never make a mistake about whether the state is \\\\psi\\\\rangle or \\\\varphi\\\\rangle, at the cost of sometimes having an inconclusive result. This task cannot be done by a projective measurement, because we need to have three outcomes, \\\\psi, \\\\varphi, and inconclusive, and projective measurements in dimension 2 can have at most 2 outcomes. The POVM that gives the highest probability of a conclusive outcome in this task is given by :F_{\\\\psi}=\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang}\\\\varphi^\\\\perp\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\varphi^\\\\perp :F_{\\\\varphi}=\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang}\\\\psi^\\\\perp\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi^\\\\perp :F_?= \\\\operatorname{I}-F_{\\\\psi}-F_{\\\\varphi}, where \\\\varphi^\\\\perp\\\\rangle is the quantum state orthogonal to \\\\varphi\\\\rangle, and \\\\psi^\\\\perp\\\\rangle is the one orthogonal to \\\\psi\\\\rangle. Note that \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\varphi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\varphiF_{\\\\psi}) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psiF_{\\\\varphi}) = 0, so when outcome \\\\psi is obtained we are certain that the quantum state is \\\\psi\\\\rangle, and when outcome \\\\varphi is obtained we are certain that the quantum state is \\\\varphi\\\\rangle. Assuming that the quantum system can be in state \\\\psi\\\\rangle or \\\\varphi\\\\rangle with the same probability, the probability of having a conclusive outcome is given by :\\\\frac12\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psiF_{\\\\psi}) +\\\\frac12\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\varphi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\varphiF_{\\\\varphi}) = 1-\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang. This result is known as the Ivanovic-Dieks-Peres limit, named after the authors who pioneered UQSD research. Using the above construction we can obtain a projective measurement that physically realises this POVM. The square roots of the POVM elements are given by :\\\\sqrt{F_{\\\\psi}}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang}}\\\\varphi^\\\\perp\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\varphi^\\\\perp :\\\\sqrt{F_{\\\\varphi}}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang}}\\\\psi^\\\\perp\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi^\\\\perp :\\\\sqrt{F_?}= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang}{1+\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang}} \\\\gamma\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\gamma, where :\\\\gamma\\\\rangle = \\\\frac1{\\\\sqrt{2(1+\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang)}}(\\\\psi\\\\rangle+e^{i\\\\arg(\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang)}\\\\varphi\\\\rangle). Labelling the three possible states of the ancilla as \\\\text{result ?}\\\\rangle, \\\\text{result œà}\\\\rangle, \\\\text{result œÜ}\\\\rangle, and initializing it on the state \\\\text{result ?}\\\\rangle, we see that the resulting unitary U_\\\\text{UQSD} takes the state \\\\psi\\\\rangle together with the ancilla to :U_\\\\text{UQSD}(\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\text{result ?}\\\\rangle) = \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang}\\\\varphi^\\\\perp\\\\rangle\\\\text{result œà}\\\\rangle + \\\\sqrt{\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang} \\\\gamma\\\\rangle\\\\text{result ?}\\\\rangle, and similarly it takes the state \\\\varphi\\\\rangle together with the ancilla to :U_\\\\text{UQSD}(\\\\varphi\\\\rangle\\\\text{result ?}\\\\rangle) = \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang}\\\\psi^\\\\perp\\\\rangle\\\\text{result œÜ}\\\\rangle + e^{-i\\\\arg(\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\lang\\\\varphi\\\\psi\\\\rang}\\\\gamma\\\\rangle\\\\text{result ?}\\\\rangle. A measurement on the ancilla then gives the desired results with the same probabilities as the POVM. This POVM has been used to experimentally distinguish non-orthogonal polarisation states of a photon, using the path degree of freedom as an ancilla. The realisation of the POVM with a projective measurement was slightly different from the one described here.

As a critic of Brazilian literature, he is regarded as having been one of the foremost scholars on the subject by Brazilian universities. He was the co-winner of the Pr√™mio Jabuti for essays in 1965 and was awarded the Pr√™mio Machado de Assis in 1993, the Cam√µes Prize in 1998 and the Alfonso Reyes International Prize in 2005. Candido was professor-emeritus at the University of S√£o Paulo and S√£o Paulo State University and doctor honoris causa by the University of Campinas. Biography Son of Aristides Candido de Mello e Souza, M.D., and Clarisse Tolentino de Mello e Souza, most of Antonio Candido's childhood was spent in the Brazilian countryside, in the states of Minas Gerais and S√£o Paulo. During this period, he did not attend school, being taught at home by his mother. In 1937 he and his family settled down in S√£o Paulo, where he received formal education. In 1939, Candido began studying Law at the University of S√£o Paulo School of Law, a course he would eventually abandon in order to study philosophy at the same university. His first critical works were published in 1941, in the magazine Clima, co-founded by himself, and, in the following year, he began teaching at the University of S√£o Paulo, first in the department of sociology and later, a position he would hold, although with a brief interval from 1958 to 1960, for thirty-six years. Candido also taught Brazilian Literature at the University of Paris from 1964 to 1966, and became visiting scholar at Yale University two years later. His major work of literary criticism was published in 1959, entitled Forma√ß√£o da Literatura Brasileira (literally, \\"Formation of Brazilian Literature), a highly polemic and influential study of the foundations of his country's literary arts. Candido was also active in politics during many periods of his life: he was a militant against Get√∫lio Vargas's Estado Novo and helped to found the Worker's Party in 1980. Candido married Gilda de Melo e Sousa in 1943, a Brazilian essayist and fellow professor at the University of S√£o Paulo, with whom he has three daughters. Candido was hospitalized at Albert Einstein Hospital in S√£o Paulo days before his death on May 12, 2017, due to a hiatus hernia. He was 98.

The game follows the adventures of Jaster Rogue, a young agricultural worker living on an isolated planet, who becomes involved in a galactic conflict, and learns the fate of the entire galaxy lies in his hands. At the time of its release, Rogue Galaxy was the largest game Level-5 had ever developed, both in terms of the number of staff working on it and the length of production (over three years). Both Level-5 and Sony had strong expectations for the game, hoping it would challenge the RPG market dominance of the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest franchises. Rogue Galaxy received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the graphics, range of side quests and scope of the game. Some, however, were critical of the plot and character development. Although the game went on to win several gaming awards, it did not sell as well as had been hoped, failing to meet Sony's expectations of selling one million units. Gameplay Rogue Galaxy is an action role- playing game played from a third-person perspective in which the player moves through a continuous environment, with no load time between overworld exploration and combat. Battles occur as random encounters, a la traditional role-playing video games such as Square's Final Fantasy X or Level-5's own Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King. However, unlike such games, which feature turn-based combat, Rogue Galaxy uses a real-time hack and slash combat system in which the player fights with a party of three characters. The player has direct control over only one character, although which character this is can be changed at any time. The two NPCs fight independently of the player character, based on the strategy selected prior to the battle. Available strategies include fighting very aggressively, targeting a specific enemy, or not fighting at all. The strategy can also be changed at any time during the battle. Additionally, the player can issue specific orders to the NPCs during combat, such as having them use an item or activate one of their special abilities. NPC allies will also offer advice to the player character, such as suggesting they perform a special move or use a particular item. The player is given a choice of either ignoring the advice, or picking one of the available options. NPCs will not perform any special moves or use items unless the player tells them to, or has selected a particular strategy prior to the battle. hit points, ability points and action gauge. The status of the player character's primary and second weapon are indicated on the top left of the screen. The party's battle strategy is shown just to the right of this. During combat, each character has an \\"Action Gauge,\\" which decrease with each action taken. When it is empty, the player can no longer attack, and must wait for the gauge to automatically refill, or instantly refill by successfully blocking an enemy attack. Each character's secondary weapon has its own individual gauge, which depletes with each use, and must be automatically refilled before the weapon can be used again. This gauge is independent of the attack gauge, and during combat it can only be refilled a certain number of times before the secondary weapon is no longer available for use. As well as fighting independently of one another, and performing their own unique abilities, players can also perform team abilities, although the correct characters must be active in the battle for a particular team ability to be available for use. The player also has a special attack, the \\"Burning Strike\\". In the original Japanese release, the Burning Strike occurred at random irrespective of the player's actions. However, this was altered for the North American and European versions to allow the player to choose when to use the attack. Once enough \\"Burning Chips\\" have been collected from slain enemies, the player can activate the Burning Strike whenever they wish. The player must then follow a series of button prompts to string together combo attacks, which deal more damage the more attacks are successfully chained. When the game begins, the storyline follows a linear path, but at a certain point, the game world opens up, and the player is free to move from planet to planet using the pirate ship, Dorgenark. In the overworld, the player can move around by walking, but can also transport from any activated save point on the map to any other activated point on that planet, although they cannot transport to a save point on another planet. Revelation Flow Deego's Revelation Flow chart. He has just gained the ability \\"Flash Bomb, Level 3\\" after filling in a group with the requisite items. Character abilities and power-ups are handled via a feature called the \\"Revelation Flow\\". Similar to the \\"Sphere Grid\\" in Final Fantasy X and the \\"License Board\\" in Final Fantasy XII, the Revelation Flow is not based on a traditional experience point/leveling up system. Instead of characters gaining pre-determined statistical bonuses as they increase in level, they gain abilities and stat increases by placing items in the Revelation Flow. Once all of the prerequisite items have been placed, the particular ability/stat increase becomes available. Each character has their own unique Revelation Flow, with a different layout, different abilities and different item requirements. Weapons The game features a \\"Weapon Synthesis\\" system similar to Dark Cloud and Dark Chronicle, which allows the player to combine weapons. For every victory in battle, each weapon carried by active characters gains experience points. When a weapon has gained a certain amount of experience, it becomes \\"Maxed.\\" After a weapon is maxed, it continues to gain additional experience in specific elemental categories - fire, ice, lightning, wind, and holy. When the experience and the elemental damage are both at maximum, a weapon is \\"Mastered\\" and cannot be improved any further. However, once a weapon is maxed, it becomes available for synthesis with another maxed weapon of the same type. When two maxed weapons are synthesized, a stronger weapon is created, and must be maxed again to become available for subsequent synthesis. Synthesis is carried out by a character within the game called \\"Toady\\", a frog who can swallow two weapons and then regurgitate a new weapon. Toady can also analyze maxed weapons and make suggestions for synthesis combinations. These suggestions are recorded in the \\"Frog Log\\". Toady will also warn the player if an attempted combination is going to result in a decrease in stats, or with a weapon for which the player's level is not yet high enough. Side-quests The game features numerous optional gameplay elements beyond the main storyline. For example, early in the game, the player can begin to compete in the \\"Insectron Tournament\\". Similar to Dark Chronicles fishing mini-game, the player must capture and breed Insectrons (bugs), which can then be entered into a tournament where they fight other Insectrons, in a manner similar to a game of chess. Once an Insectron has been captured, the player can increase its stats by feeding it certain food or breeding it with another Insectron of the opposite sex. The Insectron Tournament awards prizes as the player moves through the various ranks. Another side-quest is the \\"Factory\\". At a later point in the game, the player gains access to a reconfigurable factory. By talking to specific characters in the overworld, the player can acquire blueprints, which can be used to assemble specific equipment and raw materials so as to make new items, which then become available for purchase in the various shops throughout the game. A further side-quest are \\"Challenge battles,\\" which occur randomly throughout the game. In these battles, specific conditions must be met, such as finishing the battle without taking damage, finishing within a certain time limit, using only one character, or not using any items or abilities. If the player wins the battle and fulfills the condition, they receive a \\"Hunter Coin\\". These coins can be used to purchase different levels of \\"Hunter Licenses\\", which are required in some shops to purchase certain items. Additionally, the higher the player's license, the lower the prices for general items. The game also includes a \\"Hunter Ranking\\" system whereby the player is awarded \\"Hunter Points\\" for killing a specific number of particular enemies. As the player's rank increases, prizes are awarded. Tied into the hunter system are \\"Quarries\\" - mini-bosses which award a great deal of hunter points. However, unlike standard monsters, quarries must be purchased before they become available. Once the player has purchased the quarry, they must locate it on the map, and then use a specific item to initiate the battle. The game also features a completion chart, which records the player's progress through various aspects of gameplay; \\"Hunter Ranking\\" (the goal is to top the league of hunters), \\"Rare Items\\" (collect all nine rare items in the game), \\"Quarries\\" (successfully defeat all available quarries), \\"Hunting Record\\" (attain maximum hunter points by killing all of the specified enemies), \\"Insectron\\" (win the highest tournament rank), \\"Revelation Flow\\" (complete every character's Revelation Flow), \\"Frog Log\\" (have Toady analyze at least one-hundred weapons, and produce at least fifty), and \\"Factory\\" (produce all forty items available in the factory). When any single aspect is completed to 100%, an award is given, usually in the form of a new costume for one of the characters. Story=Characters * Jaster Rogue The game's protagonist and the main playable character. Jaster is seventeen years old, and has a distinctive birthmark on his cheek. He lives on the planet of Rosa with his adoptive father, Raul (Peter Renaday), where he works in the agricultural sector. Resentful of the presence on the planet of the Longardian army, he yearns to leave and explore space. He is given just such an opportunity when he encounters the crew of the intergalactic pirate ship Dorgenark. * Kisala The adopted daughter of Dorgengoa (Fred Tatasciore), captain of the Dorgenark. * Zegram Ghart A former bounty hunter who joined the Dorgenarks crew several years prior to the beginning of the game. * Simon Wicard A member of the Dorgenarks crew. Cheerful and optimistic, he wears a mask and speaks in a heavy Scottish accent. * Steve An android created by Dr. Pocacchio (Marc Graue), he is the navigator of the Dorgenark. * Lilika Rhyza A warrior from the planet Juraika, Lilika joins the Dorgenarks crew shortly after Jaster. * Deego Aegis A former elite soldier for the Longardian army, he has a robotic arm, and yearns for peace in the galaxy. * Jupis Tooki McGanel A lizard-like alien known as a Granshee. Regarded as the greatest hacker in the galaxy, he is a former scientist who devoted his life's work to the spaceship manufacturing megacorporation Daytron. * Desert Claw The galaxy's most famous bounty hunter. When the game begins, the crew of the Dorgenark are looking to hire him. Plot The game begins with Jaster foraging in the desert outside his home town of Salgin on the planet Rosa. Meanwhile, Simon and Steve arrive in Salgin looking for Desert Claw. As Jaster returns, he complains to his adopted father, Raul, about the presence of the Longardian Federation on the planet, who are ostensibly there to protect it from the Draxian Empire. As they talk, a beast attacks the town. Jaster rushes outside and is attacked by a group of smaller beasts. With the help of a stranger, he fights them off, and they head to face the main beast. However, upon seeing Steve and Simon, the stranger leaves Jaster, giving him his sword. Steve recognizes the sword as Desert Claw's sword, \\"Desert Seeker - one of the Seven Sacred Galactic Swords,\\" and concludes that Jaster is Desert Claw. As such, they join him in fighting the beast. They defeat it, and Steve tells Jaster their boss wants to hire him. When Jaster learns they are space pirates working for the legendary Dorgengoa, he decides to join, maintaining the ruse that he is Desert Claw. On board, he meets Kisala, Zegram and the chief mate, Monsha (Quinton Flynn). While passing the Rose Nebula on their way to Zerard, the Dorgenark is attacked by beasts and crashes on the jungle planet Juraika, where they meet Lilika, a member of the local Burkaqua tribe, who joins the crew. They resume their journey to Zerard, where they renew the ship's galactic travel visa from the Galaxy Corporation, after a stint in Rosencaster Prison, and the inadvertent recruitment of Jupis to the ship's crew. Meanwhile, Dorgengoa sees Jaster for the first time, immediately recognizing he is not Desert Claw. He orders Jaster be thrown overboard, but Kisala refuses to allow it. Dorgengoa decides to test Jaster's ability. First, he reveals he is seeking the lost planet of Eden, which is said to have disappeared 10,000 years ago. The key to finding Eden are the \\"Great Tablets\\", which are also lost, and for which Dorgengoa is searching. A tablet is believed to have been recently excavated on the planet Vedan. The crew head to the Vedanian mining town of Myna. There they meet Deego and his girlfriend Angela (Heather Halley). Deego helps the group get into the mines, but not in time to save the tablet from Daytron, who take it to Rosa. Deego decides to join the crew of the Dorgenark, and Angela promises to wait for him to return. The party arrives on Rosa and heads to the ruins in the Sylvazard Desert. The Tablet arrives and three pedestals are revealed, on which must be set three \\"Key Pieces\\". Meanwhile, Daytron president Valkog Drazer (David Lodge) and his assistant, Norma Kissleigh (Michelle Ruff), arrive with Seed (Jason Spisak), a masked servant, who engages the crew in battle. They are unable to defeat him, but are rescued by Desert Claw, who promptly leaves again. On the Dorgenark, they tell Dorgengoa about the pedestals and Deego guesses the Key Pieces are probably located within the three Ruins of the Ancient Kings. The party manage to acquire the three Key Pieces, and Jaster places them on the pedestals, transforming the Tablet into a massive three dimensional puzzle structure. Seed begins an incantation and sets about manipulating the structure. However, he proves unable to solve the puzzle and transforms into a massive beast. He attacks the party, but Jaster unleashes a ferocious power, defeating him. Jaster then uses his power to solve the puzzle, opening the gates to a labyrinth. Deego speculates Jaster may be a descendant of the Star King, an ancient king who ruled the entire galaxy 50,000 years ago. After opening the labyrinth, a confused Jaster returns to normal, and the crew enter. Inside, they encounter Ragnar (Chris Edgerly), a robot who explains Kisala is actually Princess Irieth of Mariglenn, the planet also known as Eden. He gives her the key to open the Gates of Eden. Meanwhile, the Daytron flagship, the Emperor attacks Salgin. Valkog demands the key from Jaster who is about to acquiesce, when Raul fires an electromagnetic pulse at the Emperor, partially disabling it. However, the ship fires on Raul's church before retreating. Raul dies in Jaster's arms after giving him an artifact which points to the apparently deserted Kuje Desert. In the middle of Kuje, the party find a village, Joannasburg. There, they meet the spirit of the long dead Joanna (C. C. Seymour). She explains she is a descendant of the Star King, as is her son; Jaster. Desert Claw arrives, telling Jaster he is his father. He gave Jaster to Raul while he prepared for the day when Jaster would awaken the power of the Star King and open the Gates of Eden. Jaster uses the key and a space portal appears above Rosa. After passing through, the crew Mariglenn, where they are greeted by Queen Freidias (Wendee Lee), who tells Kisala she is her mother. Freidias then tells the story of Mariglenn; tens of thousands of years ago, the planet was attacked by an evil energy known as Rune, which possesses the power to turn living beings into beasts. Mother, the essence of Rune, took control of the planet, and the people realized once Mariglenn was destroyed, Mother would move onto another planet, eventually destroying the entire galaxy. As such, Freidias sealed Mariglenn into a \\"space-time cleft.\\" Only one person can defeat Mother ‚Äì the Star King. The crew travel to Ti'atha Forest where they encounter the spirit of Kisala's father, King Albioth (Fred Tatasciore). Albioth had faced Mother, but lost and had turned into a beast. He tells them the only way she can be defeated is by neutralizing the power of her Rune, using Drigellum energy; which can only be found in the hearts of good people. Each of the party's hearts generates Drigellum, which is forged into a sword. The party enter Mother's lair and fight her. Jaster again releases the power of the Star King. He reveals Mother as being a sorceress named Ilzarbella (Wendee Lee) who served the Star King until she was seduced by the power of Rune. Using the Drigellum sword, the Star King/Jaster kills her. However, as soon as the battle ends, the Emperor arrives with the intention of collecting the Rune energy to create beasts so as to continue the war. However, Rune takes over the ship, killing Valkog and Norma, and integrating them into an organic vessel which it uses to attack Jaster and his group. The group split up, with each member attacking a separate part of the ship, eventually defeating it. Mariglenn returns to its former self, and Kisala says goodbye to Freidias. When they return to their own galaxy, the group find Mariglenn has reappeared. They visit and the Mariglenndians appoint Kisala as their new queen, much to the disappointment of Dorgengoa and Jaster. As Jaster and Monsha discuss the newly established galactic peace, Kisala is inaugurated as the new queen. Meanwhile, Simon returns to his family, Lilika returns to Bukaqua, Deego reunites with Angela, Steve returns to work with Dr. Pocacchio, Jupis resumes his scientific research, and Zegram remains on the Dorgenark. Later, Dorgenoa tells Jaster they are returning to Mariglenn to get back Kisala. The game ends with a narration saying the crew made off with their \\"ultimate treasure\\" in what was their very last heist. Development A cutscene showing Jaster speaking with Kisala. This image demonstrates the \\"tonal rendering\\" graphical style used by Level-5 in the game; cel-shaded 3D graphics for the foreground characters, set against detailed, realistic backgrounds. Rogue Galaxy was first hinted at on August 1, 2003, when Level-5 revamped its website, and included a single image for a \\"New RPG\\". No further information was provided, although, at the time, some thought the game might be the rumored Dark Cloud 3. Nothing more was heard until February 2005, when Level-5 president Akihiro Hino revealed that \\"New RPG\\" was going to be released for the PlayStation 2, quelling rumors the game was being developed for the PlayStation Portable. The name was announced on July 19, when it was also revealed that the game would feature cel-shaded graphics in the style of previous Level-5 games, such as Dark Chronicle and Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King. Level-5 refer to the technique as \\"tonal rendering\\"; a mixture of cel-shaded 3D graphics for the main characters, set against detailed, realistic backgrounds. It was also announced that Hino was directing the project. The game was officially unveiled at the July 2005 PlayStation Meeting in Tokyo, where Hino said it had been in development for the past two and a half years, with its development time overlapping that of Dragon Quest VIII. He also revealed the game was the biggest project Level-5 had ever worked on, both in terms of production length and the number of staff working on the project. In an August interview with Famitsu, Hino explained the gameplay would involve the player travelling the galaxy and visiting various planets, each of which has its own unique visual theme. He claimed the total volume of areas to explore in the game would surpass any RPG to date. Originally, he had planned to feature a \\"virtually uncountable number of planets,\\" which would be procedurally generated as the player explored them. However, this concept was later modified to a smaller number of planets, each with multiple locations. He revealed a major selling point of the game would be no loading times between exploration and combat, or when moving from one location to another, something which had never before been accomplished on a disc-based RPG, and something which had been a long-time personal goal of his. He also went into detail about the backgrounds of Jaster, Kisala, Zegram and Lilika, and he explained the basic combat system (a hack and slash system using three party members, with the player able to issue commands to the two NPCs), the Revelation Flow system, and some basic information about the Factory system. A trailer for the game was released on August 5, as was basic plot information. Also on August 5, the game's website went live. A playable demo of the game was made available at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show in September. IGN's Anoop Gantayat was impressed with the \\"seamless\\" gameplay, and the absence of load times, although he did note the frame rate was lower than Dragon Quest VIII. He was also impressed with the graphics; \\"the game doesn't hide the vastness of its world, with plenty of distant views as you explore the complicated landscapes. One may actually get the feeling of existing in the expansive world of a massively multiplayer online RPG rather than the limited world of standard RPG.\\" The game was released in Japan on December 8, with no date set for North American or European releases. Both IGN and GameSpot played an import copy of the game, and both were impressed. IGN's Gantayat again praised the absence of loading times, arguing \\"the technical feats this game pulls off with the grey and limping PS2 hardware are impressive.\\" He praised the pre-rendered CG cutscenes, and the smooth transition from these scenes to the gameplay itself. GameSpot's Bethany Massimilla wrote \\"The visual style of the game is strongly inspired by cel- shading techniques, but the characters here aren't the flat and cartoony sort that you might ordinarily associate with the cel-shaded style. They exist and move in full 3D with lots of attention to detail in their attire and their movement, and they look great.\\" Music The game's music was composed, arranged, and produced by Tomohito Nishiura. The two-disc, sixty-one track Rogue Galaxy Original Soundtrack, was released in Japan on January 25, 2006 by King Records. The title's ending vocal track, \\"Dreaming My Way Home\\", is composed by Nishiura, and arranged and performed by Barbara Kessler. GameSpot wrote of the score \\"Rogue Galaxys soundtrack is a robust and varied assortment of tunes that fit its epic scale.\\" On the same day, the single-disk, ten-track Rogue Galaxy Premium Arrange was published in Japan by TEAM Entertainment. Consisting of remixes of some of the tracks from the game, the album featured contributions from some of the Japanese video game industry's top composers, including Yasunori Mitsuda, Shinji Hosoe, Kenji Ito, Yoko Shimomura, Nobuyoshi Sano, Yoshitaka Hirota and Noriyuki Iwadare. Localization improvements In April 2006, Sony Computer Entertainment announced a North American release date for October. At the 2006 E3 event in May, Level-5 revealed the English language version of the game would be much more than a direct translation of the original Japanese version, but would instead include multiple new features. Primary amongst these would be a new planet with its own storyline, characters and items, as well as gameplay tweaks, such as Burning Strikes no longer happening randomly. Over one-hundred new items and weapons were also to be added to the game, and numerous character animations would be improved. In August, Sony announced the North American release date had been pushed back to January 2007 to facilitate further refinement. At the 2006 Tokyo Game Show, the producer of the English localization, Nao Higo, called the new version of the game the \\"perfect version\\". He explained the team had taken on board criticisms regarding the difficulty of the original game, which was felt to be too easy in some places and too hard in others, and had created a more balanced difficulty level. He also explained the new world, the water world Alistia, would be optional, but would be fully realized, with its own map, storylines, characters, missions and items. Improvements were also made to the graphics of the existing planets. He explained the Insectron minigame would now include a multiplayer mode, whereby the player's team of insectrons would generate a code, which could be given to another player. When the second player enters the code in \\"Battle mode\\" at the Insectron tournament, they can use their team to fight the first player's team. Other improvements include: * The game is now housed on a double-layer 8.5GB DVD instead of the original 4.7GB DVD, which allows smoother graphics and additional data. * Toady's weapon analysis is easier to use. * The \\"Burning Strike\\" system has been altered. Players now collect Burning Chips during battle, which allows them to store power, and execute their Burning Strike when they wish. In the original game, the Burning Strikes happened randomly. The input section of the ability has also been changed, with full animations for each character as they perform each attack, and different animations for each character's five-hit, seven- hit, and nine-hit attacks. * The layout and visual design of several dungeons and planets has been altered and improved; specifically Salgin, Rosencaster Prison, the Daytron factory, the Ruins on Rosa and the Gladius Towers. * Two new species of Insectron have been added; the \\"Bomber Snail\\" and the \\"Spidan\\", each with eight types of Insectron per species. * Each character has four additional costumes, except for Kisala and Simon, who have five each. * Over 2000 lines of additional voiced dialogue has been added. * Each character has three new abilities on their Revelation Flow, except for Lilika, who has four. Two new Combination abilities have also been added that team up Kisala with Lilika and Steve with Jupis. PlayStation 4 re-release In November 2015, Sony announced the PlayStation 4 would be getting PlayStation 2 emulation. On December 3, the Sony Twitter feed posted, and then quickly removed, an announcement trailer for Dark Cloud running on the PlayStation 4, demonstrating 1080p graphics via up-rendering, trophy support, and both Remote Play and Share Play compatibility. On December 4, via the PlayStation Blog, Sony confirmed Rogue Galaxy would be included in the first batch of up- rendered PlayStation 2 games released for the PlayStation 4. Available only via the PlayStation Store, the game would feature everything shown in the leaked announcement trailer plus second screen support for the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation App. The game was demonstrated in full at the PlayStation Experience, and released on December 5. Reception Rogue Galaxy received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Although Eurogamer's Simon Parkin praised the graphics and range of mini-games and side-quests, he felt the game's release after Final Fantasy XII placed an unrealizable burden of expectation upon it: \\"Many players will be expecting that game's new lessons in design to have been absorbed and even evolved here.\\" He concluded, when \\"viewed objectively and set against the newest highpoints of the genre, aside from its gorgeous aesthetics and removal of load times, Rogue Galaxy just isn't the marvel it's been set up to be.\\" Game Revolution's Tim Tackett was critical of the plot, writing, \\"the characters lack backstories, and the emotional pitch never leaves the realm of Saturday morning cartoons.\\" However, he praised the range of side-quests, the battle system, the graphics and the Revelation Flow, which he found superior to the License Board of Final Fantasy XII. He concluded, \\"the plot is a little dry and chewy, but the surrounding game is juicy and sweet. With a fairly lengthy, if substandard, main storyline crammed with lots of action and neat extra tidbits, Rogue Galaxy is a taste of the holidays, with none of the hassle.\\" GameTrailers was also critical of the plot, saying, \\"What you have here is an unending parade of threadbare anime tropes predictably matched by bland characters. You've seen every one of these stereotypes before, acting out the same quests and forcing out the same emotions they do in just about every other RPG.\\" However, they praised the gameplay and variety of side-quests, and concluded \\"while it has plenty of problems, anyone who can get beyond the banal storytelling and stale level design will find something addictive and worthwhile in Rogue Galaxy. Grinding out levels and looking for items is rarely this rewarding, and it's obvious that Level 5 knows the depths of the role-player's mind all too well.\\" GameSpot's Greg Kasavin had mixed feelings about the combat system, arguing, \\"The combat gets to be repetitive after a while. Since you only have direct control over one character, who'll mostly depend on the same basic attacks regardless of which weapons you've equipped, the battles don't feel particularly varied from one to the next.\\" He concluded, \\"the PlayStation 2 has delivered an almost countless number of high-quality Japanese role-playing games, so all the past competition is really the main reason why Rogue Galaxy doesn't come off as a stunning accomplishment. On the other hand, though, this is a game that does enough differently or better than most of its PS2 predecessors that it's still well deserving of your consideration.\\" IGN's Jeremy Dunham praised the graphics (\\"It's easily one of the top 20 best looking PS2 titles ever made\\") and the battle system, although he was somewhat critical of teammate AI. He also praised the range of side quests and mini- games. He concluded, \\"Rogue Galaxy definitely brings the noise to longtime RPG fans. Though its storyline isn't on the same level as other great PS2 games in the genre, its mixture of strong combat mechanics, addictive sidequests, and absolutely stunning visual style more than makes up for what it doesn't do.\\" GameSpy's Patrick Joynt's main criticism concerned the lack of character development: \\"Rogue Galaxy looks great and is technically stunning. It's packed utterly full of the standbys of the genre - combat, exploration, personalization, and sub-games that are too huge to be called \\"mini-games\\" - which are all executed well, but [...] the characters themselves seem entirely secondary to the matter at hand [...] they're as engaging as cardboard cutouts, largely because they're so predictable.\\" However, he praised the range of mini-games and side-quests, and the overall size of the game. He concluded, \\"Rogue Galaxys greatest triumph, the brightest gleam in its eye, is that at sixty hours of play I've got another sixty I could easily pour in.\\" Sales and awards Prior to the release of the game, Sony Computer Entertainment corporate executive Masatsuka Saeki had hoped it would sell a million units. Although it was the top-selling video game in Japan during the week ending December 11, 2005, selling 237,631 units, by the end of 2006, the game had sold only 356,192 units. In 2007, Rogue Galaxy: Director's Cut sold a further 29,457 units. The game won a \\"Future Award\\" at the CESA Game Awards (2005) and an \\"Excellence in Digital Content\\" award at the Digital Contents Grandprix (2006). At the Famitsu Awards in 2006, it won both \\"Best RPG\\" and a \\"Special Rookie Award.\\" It was named \\"Game of the Month\\" for January 2007 and given an \\"Editor's Choice\\" award by IGN, who, in 2010, placed it at #53 in their \\"Top 100 PlayStation 2 Games\\". It was also given an \\"Editor's Choice\\" award by GameSpy. The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences named Rogue Galaxy as one of the nominees for 2007 \\"Roleplaying Game of the Year\\"; however, it eventually lost to Mass Effect.

Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court reviewed the concept of judicial standing and affirmed that if the plaintiffs lacked standing, they could not maintain a case against the defendants.  Background  The plaintiffs brought action against the town of Penfield, New York, a suburb of Rochester, and against members of the Zoning, Planning, and Town Boards of Penfield, alleging that Penfield's zoning ordinances intentionally and wrongly excluded persons of low and moderate income from living there. The not-for-profit housing organization Metro-Act of Rochester joined with several Rochester taxpayers as well as low and moderate- income individuals of various racial and ethnic backgrounds were considered jointly as party-plaintiffs to this action. However, the United States District Court dismissed the case, citing that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue. The United States Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal. The court was tasked to determine if the American rules of standing should be considered part of the 'case or controversy' clause of Article Three of the United States Constitution or, apart from that, if the court can hear cases on \\"generalized grievances\\" or in the interest of third parties where none of the complainants have standing.  Opinion of the Court  The Court found that as none of the plaintiffs could demonstrate any injury actually done to them by the defendants, the plaintiffs were third parties to the issue and had no standing to sue. The plaintiff's descriptions of their own meager financial situations and subsequent inability to live in Penfield were found by the Court to be the consequence of the economics and housing market of the area rather than any wrongdoing by the defendants.

Background Gosse was born on Long Island, New York. Gosse attended SUNY Purchase where he would meet and collaborate with artists such as Hal Hartley, Nick Gomez, Parker Posey, Wesley Snipes and Edie Falco. After graduating with a BFA degree from the film program at SUNY Purchase in 1986, Gosse joined the independent film scene in New York City, creating short films and features. He was married to Robin Tunney but divorced in 2006. In 2010, he joined the faculty of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, School of Filmmaking in Producing. New York operations Gosse founded independent film company The Shooting Gallery with Larry Meistrich in 1991. His collaborators included Hal Hartley, Ted Hope, Nick Gomez and Michael Almereyda. The company's first feature was Gomez' Laws of Gravity (1992). Gosse also directed The Last Home Run, filmed in 1996 and released in 1998. Gosse pushed the boundaries of \\"lo-fi\\" filmmaking when he produced Almereyda's PixelVision feature, Another Girl Another Planet (1992). It was cited by the National Society of Film Critics in 1992 \\"for expanding the possibilities of experimental filmmaking.\\" At The Shooting Gallery, Gosse supported other first-time filmmakers including Morgan J. Freeman, Danny Leiner and Billy Bob Thornton. In 1995, Gosse co-produced the Nick Gomez-directed film, New Jersey Drive, released that April. He also directed the first screenplay by playwright Matthew Weiss. The result, Niagara, Niagara, premiered to acclaim. Lead actress Robin Tunney took home the prestigious Volpi Cup at the 1997 Venice International Film Festival for her portrayal of a woman with Tourette syndrome. In its American premiere, the film was panned by some critics. Gosse's follow-up was an adaptation of journalist Alec Wilkinson's nonfiction book A Violent Act. By late 1999, Gosse was at work on another adaptation, a play by theater scribe Wendy Hammond. The stage play, Julie Johnson, was shot as a feature film beginning in 2000 and it starred Lili Taylor, Courtney Love, Mischa Barton and Spalding Gray. It was released in 2005 by Regent Entertainment. Los Angeles operations The Shooting Gallery went out of business in 2001, having failed to produce any hit films except Sling Blade, and Gosse moved west to Los Angeles to produce TV pilots and films. These would include Tim McCann's Runaway (2005) and Almereyda's Tonight At Noon (2006), the latter starring Connie Nielsen, Ethan Hawke, Rutger Hauer, and Lauren Ambrose. Gosse lives in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and collaborating on a new screenplay about a Las Vegas filmmaker during the 1960s. He spent time working for the 2008 Democratic Party nomination of Barack Obama. Gosse directed Tucker Max's film, I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell. Personal life In the early 1990s, Gosse lived with actress Parker Posey, whom he met when they were both students at SUNY Purchase. On October 5, 1997, Gosse married actress Robin Tunney in New York City; they had met while working together on Niagara, Niagara. They separated in late 2002, and divorced in 2006 but remain close friends.

Gabriel had a brother, Claudius (Iqludah), who was a priest and monk of the monastery of al-Muharraq, of which Gabriel was the abbot. He also had a married sister and a nephew, Rizqallah, who was a deacon. Gabriel was known as a great scholar and righteous ascetic. Claudius was also known for his learning; in 1388 he ordered a copy of the Philokalia. He was consecrated on Epiphany Sunday, 11 Tuba 1086 AM (corresponding to 6 January 1370) in the church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus in Alexandria. His consecration at Alexanria rather than Cairo was unusual for the time., at 174‚Äì75. Although next to nothing is known of Gabriel's pastoral duties, he does not seem to have been unduly encumbered by the authorities. As patriarch, he visited the monasteries of the Wadi al-Natrun. He imported olive oil from Syria and spiny broom from Beirut. He sent the priest Ibn al-Qudsi to Damascus to obtain a copper vessel. In 1371, Gabriel consecrated Timothy as bishop of Qasr Ibrim in Nobadia. In 1374, Gabriel was staying at the monastery of Saint Macarius the Great during a famine. In order to prolong his stay without harming the monks, he supplied his and his bishops' own provisions. That same year he took part in the consecration of the holy chrism (myron) and had Athanasius of Qus compose an account of the rite. With the new myron, Gabriel reconsecrated six portable altars that had been profaned, although we are not told how. He went on a circuit of several monasteries, distributing the myron: the monastery of John the Little, inhabited by Ethiopians and Armenians; the Monastery of Saint Pishoy, inhabited by Syrians, Ethiopians and Armenians; the monastery of Old Baramus; the monastery of Our Lady Baramus; and the monastery of John Kama. Afterwards he returned to Saint Macarius. Gabriel IV was contemporary of Al-Ashraf Nasir-ad-Din Shaban II and Al-Mansur Alah-ad-Din Ali, the Bahri sultans. He reigned for 8 years, 3 months and 22 days. He died on 3 Pashons 1094 AM (28 April 1378), and was buried next to Simon the Tanner.

Important finds include the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, the Chieftain's Cup, the Boxer Vase, and the Harvester Vase. Geography Linear A inscription on a clay tablet from Hagia Triada Hagia Triada is in south central Crete, 30‚Äì40 meters above sea level. It lies four kilometers west of Phaistos, which is situated at the western end of the Mesara Plain. The site was not a Minoan palace but an upscale town and possibly a royal villa. After the catastrophe of 1450 BC, when the Mycenaeans attacked Crete and destroyed many Minoan settlements, the town was rebuilt and remained inhabited until the 2nd century BC. Later, a Roman villa was built at the site. Nearby are two chapels: Hagia Triada in the deserted village and Hagios Georgios, built during the Venetian period. Archaeology The famous Hagia Triada sarcophagus Hagia Triada, as was nearby Phaistos, was excavated from 1900 to 1908 by a group from Italian Scuola Archeologica Italiana di Atene, directed by Federico Halbherr and Luigi Pernier. The site includes a town and a miniature \\"palace\\", an ancient drainage system servicing both, and Early Minoan tholos tombs. The settlement was in use, in various forms, from Early Minoan I until the fires of Late Minoan IB. Archaeologists unearthed a sarcophagus painted with illuminating scenes from Cretan life.Crete: The Archaeological Site of Agia Triada It is the only limestone sarcophagus of its era discovered to date and the only sarcophagus with a series of narrative scenes of Minoan funerary ritual. However, it is possible that the Minoan religious beliefs were mixed with the beliefs of the Myceneans, who captured the island in the 14th century BC. It was originally used for the burial of a prince. In the center of one of the long sides of the sarcophagus is the scene of a bull sacrifice. On the left of the second long side, a woman who is wearing a crown is carrying two vessels. By her side, a man dressed in a long robe is playing a seven-stringed lyre. This is the earliest known picture of the classical-Greek lyre. Agia Triada ( 1500-1400 BC).

Rhadamanthys was the judge of the Elysion, and this idea probably predates some later Orphic beliefs. It seems that, in Crete, some festivals corresponded to later Greek festivals.Walter Burkert (1985), Greek religion, p. 42 An agrarian procession is depicted on the \\"Harvesters' Vase\\", or \\"Vase of the Winnowers\\", which was found in Hagia Triada.

Variant spelling c≈ìlum. Fƒ´at j≈´stitia ruat c√¶lum is a Latin legal phrase, meaning \\"Let justice be done though the heavens fall.\\" The maxim signifies the belief that justice must be realized regardless of consequences. According to the 19th-century abolitionist politician Charles Sumner, it does not come from any classical source.\\"The Position and Duties of the Merchant: Address Before the Mercantile Library Association of Boston, Nov. 13, 1854.\\" in The Works of Charles Sumner, Volume III, Boston: Lee and Shephard, 1875, p. 507. It has also been ascribed to Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, see \\"Piso's justice\\". It was used in Somerset v Stewart.(1772) 98 ER 499  Classical forms = The ancient metaphor of the falling sky  The falling sky clause occurs in a passage of Heauton Timorumenos, by Terence, suggesting that it was a common saying in his time. In the scene, Syrus suggests a scheme through which Clinia might deceive another into taking actions that would further his love interests. Syrus lays out his plan, while Clinia, who must act it out, finds faults with it, finally asking, \\"Is that sufficient? If his father should come to know of it, pray, what then?\\" To which the Syrus replies, \\"Quid si redeo ad illos qui aiunt, 'Quid si nunc c≈ìlum ruat?‚Äî\\"What if I have recourse to those who say, 'What now if the sky were to fall?, the suggestion being that Clinia has no other options available, so to worry that the plan will, obviously, fail if the father finds out makes no more sense than worrying about the fact that it will also fail if the world were to suddenly end. This concern recalls a passage in Arrian's Campaigns of Alexander, Book I, 4, where ambassadors of the Celtae from the Adriatic sea, tall men of haughty demeanor, upon being asked by Alexander what in the world they feared most, answered that their worst fear was that the sky might fall on their heads. Alexander, who hoped to hear himself named, was disappointed by an answer that implied that nothing within human power could hurt them, short of a total destruction of nature. In a similar vein, Theognis of Megara urges \\"May the great broad sky of bronze fall on my head / (That fear of earth-born men) if I am not / A friend to those who love me, and a pain / And irritation to my enemies.\\"(Elegies 869-872, translated by Dorothea Wender.) Whereas Aristotle asserts in his Physics, B. IV, that it was the early notion of ignorant nations that the sky was supported on the shoulders of Atlas, and that when he let go of it, it would fall. On the other hand, Horace opens one of his odes with a depiction of a Stoic hero who will submit to the ruin of the universe around him: \\"Si fractus illabatur orbis, / impavidum ferient ruinae\\"‚Äî\\"Should the whole frame of Nature round him break, / In ruin and confusion hurled, / He, unconcerned, would hear the mighty crack, / And stand secure amidst a falling world.\\" (Odes 3.3.7‚Äì8, translated by Joseph Addison.)  Seneca: \\"Piso's justice\\"  In De Ira (On Anger), Book I, Chapter XVIII, Seneca tells of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, a Roman governor and lawmaker, when he was angry, ordering the execution of a soldier who had returned from a leave of absence without his comrade, on the grounds that if the man did not produce his companion, he had presumably killed the latter. As the condemned man was presenting his neck to the executioner's sword, there suddenly appeared the very comrade who was supposedly murdered. The centurion overseeing the execution halted the proceedings and led the condemned man back to Piso, expecting a reprieve. But Piso mounted the tribunal in a rage, and ordered the three soldiers to be executed. He ordered the death of the man who was to have been executed, because the sentence had already been passed; he also ordered the death of the centurion who was in charge of the original execution, for failing to perform his duty; and finally, he ordered the death of the man who had been supposed to have been murdered, because he had been the cause of the death of two innocent men. In subsequent versions of this legend, this principle became known as \\"Piso's justice\\", a term that characterizes sentences that are carried out or passed from retaliation‚Äîwhose intentions are technically correct, but morally wrong‚Äîand this could be construed as a negative interpretation of the meaning of Fiat justitia ruat caelum. The phrase fiat justitia does not appear in De Ira. though Brewer's attributes the story to Seneca. The phrase is sometimes attributed to a different Piso, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, possibly a confusion with this case.  Modern origins  The exact phrase as used for approval of justice at all cost‚Äîusually seen in a positive sense‚Äîappears to originate in modern jurisprudence. In English law, William Watson in \\"Ten Quodlibetical Quotations Concerning Religion and State\\" (1601) \\"You go against that general maxim in the laws, which is 'Fiat justitia et ruant coeli. This is its first known appearance in English literature. The maxim was used by William Prynne in \\"Fresh Discovery of Prodigious Wandering New-Blazing Stars\\" (1646), by Nathaniel Ward in \\"Simple Cobbler of Agawam\\" (1647), and frequently thereafter, but it was given its widest celebrity by William Murray, 1st Baron Mansfield's decision on 8 June 1768, on the case concerning the outlawry of John Wilkes (and not, as is commonly believed, in Somersett's Case, the 1772 case concerning the legality of slavery in England).R v. Wilkes, (1768) 4 Burr 2527, 2562, 98 E.R. 327 (347); Somersett v. Stewart (1772) Lofft. 1; 98 ER 499 (509) Another famous eighteenth-century usage appears in David Hume's 1748 essay \\"Of Passive Obedience\\", although Hume argued that justice must occasionally be sacrificed to the public interest.David Hume, \\"Of Passive Obedience\\", 1748. In 1860 this maxim was placed on the flag of the Alamo City Guards Texas Militia which continued its use when Texas Seceded and became part of the Confederacy. The maxim is given in various forms: * Fiat justitia, ruat c≈ìlum/coelum/c√¶lum/caelum (spellings) * Fiat justitia et ruant coeli (Watson) * Fiat justitia et coelum ruat (John Manningham, Diary, 11 April 1603) * Fiat justitia, ruat coelum (Lord Mansfield)  Famous modern uses  In British India, this phrase was used by Sir S. Subramania Iyer during a case (\\"Tirupati (or Tirupathi) Mahant case\\") in Madras High Court. It was a case regarding religious faith versus the law, where a Hindu Temple administrator (called as the 'mahant') was accused by the high priest of misappropriation of donations, replacing a vessel full of gold with base metals, like copper and placing it beneath the flagstaff of the temple. The barrister representing the high priest used this phrase in his speech to justify digging up the flagstaff to check the vessel. More recently, Judge James Edwin Horton referred to the maxim when he recalled his decision to overturn the conviction of Haywood Patterson in the infamous Scottsboro Boys trial. In 1933, Judge Horton set aside the death sentence of Patterson, one of nine black men who were wrongfully convicted of raping two white women in Alabama. Horton quoted the phrase when explaining why he made his decision, even though he knew it would mean the end of his judicial career.Profile of Judge James Horton. Jr., Scottsboro Judge This is referenced with the title of a film based on the case, Heavens Fall (where the line is quoted). Similarly, Lord Mansfield, in reversing the outlawry of John Wilkes in 1768, used the phrase to reflect upon the duty of the court. The phrase is engraved on the wall behind the bench in the Supreme Court of Georgia and over the lintel of the Bridewell Garda station in Dublin. The Tennessee Supreme Court uses the phrase as its motto; it appears in the seal of the Court and is inlaid into the floor of the lobby of the court's building in Nashville. During World War II, the 447th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force used the phrase as its motto, which appeared on the group's official unit markings. Ohio's Old Perry County Courthouse features an English translation of the phrase over its main entrance, which has gained extensive attention due to its mangled wording: \\"Let Justice be done. If the Heavens should fall.\\" The University of Saskatchewan College of Law uses the first half of the phrase as their motto, simply: \\"Fiat Justitia\\". The entire phrase is the motto of the Peter A. Allard School of Law at the University of British Columbia. In the Oliver Stone 1991 film JFK, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) uses a variation, \\"Let justice be done, though the heavens fall\\", in reference to his investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy. In the 2006 Vin Diesel comedy Find Me Guilty, the phrase (mis-spelt as \\"Fiat Justica et Ruat Caelum\\") is inscribed on the front of a federal judge's bench, and is translated by a defense attorney as part of his opening statement. Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella Heart of Darkness contains a possible reference to the maxim at the very end of the text. Protagonist Marlow says, \\"It seemed to me that the house would collapse before I could escape, that the heavens would fall upon my head. But nothing happened. The heavens do not fall for such a trifle.\\" George Eliot has Mr. Brooke mangle and misattribute this phrase in Middlemarch, where he says, \\"You should read history - look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of thing. They always happen to the best men, you know. But what is that in Horace?‚Äîfiat justitia, ruat ... something or other.\\" The anime series Aldnoah.Zero features the phrase as a tagline alongside the show's logo. It is also speculated that the ending of the series' first half is a retelling of \\"Piso's Justice\\", concerning the fate of the three men. In an episode of Hawaii Five-O, Steve McGarrett has to deal with an extralegal Star Chamber court that addresses cases of accused who got away with their crimes because of some technicality or procedural error. The leader would end their deliberations with the quote, then proceed to the verdict, usually death. McGarrett reads the quote in one scene, then translates it. In the Better Call Saul episode \\"Chicanery\\", the character Charles McGill utters the phrase \\"Let justice be done though the heavens fall!\\" making an argument to appear in open court in a trial against his brother Jimmy. In the Designated Survivor episode \\"Target\\", the character Seth Wright utters the phrase \\"Let justice be done though the heavens may fall!\\" referring to President Kirkman's intention to \\"do what is right\\" in the face of former President Moss's announcement of his candidacy for the next presidential election in order to undermine Kirkman's administration. During President Clinton's Impeachment Hearings, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, \\"Let justice be done though the heavens fall\\".

Collins is best known for creating Westside Preparatory School, a private elementary school in the impoverished Garfield Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois which opened in 1975. Early life Collins was born in Monroeville, Alabama, to father, Henry Knight, a businessman who owned a funeral home and worked with cattle, and to mother, Bessie Knight (n√©e Nettles). She grew up in Atmore, Alabama, a small town near Mobile, Alabama, during the time of segregation in the American South. When she was young, Collins went to a strict elementary school in a one-room schoolhouse in Atmore, Alabama, an experience which influenced her later in life. She graduated from Clark College (now known as Clark Atlanta University) in Atlanta, Georgia.  Career  Collins taught school for two years in Alabama, then moved to Chicago in 1959, where she taught as a full‚Äìtime substitute teacher in inner‚Äìcity Chicago Public Schools system for fourteen years.  COREY Preparatory School  Dismayed at the low levels of learning that she felt some students were experiencing in particular areas, Collins took $5,000 (a large sum of money at that time) from her own teacher's retirement fund and started a private school in the top floors of the brownstone in the West Garfield Park neighborhood where she lived in 1975. The school she started was called Westside Preparatory School. Westside Prep became an educational and commercial success. Collins created her low-cost private school specifically for the purpose of teaching low income black children whom Collins felt that the Chicago Public School System had labeled as being learning disabled. Collins said she had the data to prove that students were teachable and were able to overcome obstacles of learning via her teaching methods, which she said eliminated behavioral issues and allowed students to flourish. The one- room schoolhouse of her education influenced her methods. At home her father gave her assignments she believed built her confidence and gave her a sense of responsibility. She felt time spent with students was more valuable than distance-creating audio visual information. Collins and her daughter ran the school for more than 30 years until it closed in 2008 due to lack of sufficient enrollment and funding. Media coverage Collins became well- known due to the 1981 TV movie based on her life's work entitled The Marva Collins Story, starring Cicely Tyson and Morgan Freeman. She also appeared on a featured news article on CBS's 60 Minutes. Cicely Tyson, who played Collins in the TV movie, said she spent time with Collins to research for the role. The 60 Minutes feature was inspired by a 1970s article written by Chicago Sun- Times reporter Zay N. Smith about Collins and Westside Prep.  Kevin Ross  In 1982, Kevin Ross, a 23‚Äìyear-old Creighton University basketball player, got to his senior year of college without being able to read. With the assistance of a Creighton booster, Ross enrolled in second grade at Westside Prep. With private tutoring by Collins, Ross learned how to read and graduated in May 1983. Ross had difficulties continuing his education, but when he had serious troubles, Collins was instrumental in helping him. Career highlights Due to the success of her teaching methods, it was reported that President Ronald Reagan wanted to nominate Collins to the position of Secretary of Education, but Collins took herself out of the running for the position. In 1983, Reagan cited Collins during an unveiling of a national program to combat adult illiteracy. She was also asked by president George H. W. Bush to become Secretary of Education, but she declined in favor of teaching one student at a time. In 1994, Prince featured Collins in his music video for \\"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.\\" He also donated $500,000 to the Westside Preparatory School Teacher Training Institute, which was created to teach Collins' teaching methodology. In 1996, Collins was hired to supervise three Chicago public schools that had been placed on probation. In 2004, Collins received a National Humanities Medal, among many awards for her teaching and efforts at school reform. During the 2006‚Äì07 school year, Collins' school charged $5,500 for tuition, and parents said the school did a much better job than the Chicago public school system, which budgeted $11,300 per student. The authorities complained that this was not enough. Teaching methods and critics Collins was known for applying classical education, in particular the Socratic method, modified for use in primary schools, successfully with impoverished students. Collins criticized the teaching of the students, not the students themselves. She wrote a number of manuals, books and motivational tracts describing her history and methods. In 1982 and in subsequent articles, Collins has been criticized by George N. Schmidt from Substance News, who claims that Collins' work was fraudulent. Collins denied any fraud. At the time, Collins had both supporters and detractors.  Personal life and death Collins married to Clarence Collins from September 1960 until his death in 1995. Together, they had three children; Patrick, Eric and Cynthia. Collins died on June 24, 2015 in Beaufort County, South Carolina, aged 78, while in hospice care.

He was contemporary to Al-Ashraf Sayf-ad-Din Barsbay, Al- Aziz Jamal-ad-Din Yusuf, Az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Jaqmaq, and Al-Mansur Fakhr-ad- Din Uthman, the Burji sultans of Egypt. During his Papacy, the Copts encountered many hardships that the kings of Ethiopia threatened the Burji Mamluks to cut the flow of the Nile because of their persecution of the Christians. John XI was forbidden to communicate with the kings of Ethiopia and Nubia without the permission and knowledge of the sultans. John XI was enthroned on 16 Pashons, 1143 A.M. (May 11, 1427 A.D.). He occupied the Throne of Saint Mark for 24 years, 11 month, and 23 days. He departed on 9 Pashons, 1168 A.M. (May 4, 1452). He was buried in the tomb of the Monastery of El- Khandak.

A frequent collaborator with Nuel Belnap, Anderson was instrumental in the development of relevance logic and deontic logic. Anderson died of cancer in 1973.  Relevance logic  Anderson believed that the conclusion of a valid inference ought to have something to do with (i.e. be relevant to) the premises. Formally, he captured this \\"relevance condition\\" with the principle that : A entails B only if A and B share at least one non-logical constant. As simple as this idea appears, implementing it in a formal system requires a radical departure from the semantics of classical logic. Anderson and Belnap (with contributions from J. Michael Dunn, Kit Fine, Alasdair Urquhart, Robert K. Meyer, Anil Gupta, and others) explored the formal consequences of the relevance condition in great detail in their influential Entailment books (see references below), which are the most frequently cited works in the field of relevance logic. Anderson and Belnap were quick to observe that the concept of relevance had been central to logic since Aristotle, but had been unduly neglected since Gottlob Frege and George Boole laid the foundations for what would come to be known, somewhat ironically, as \\"classical\\" logic. (For an example of classical logic's failure to satisfy the relevance condition, see the article on the principle of explosion.) Deontic logic  Anderson advocated the view that sentences of the form \\"It ought to be (the case) that A\\" should be interpreted logically as: * Not-A entails v, where v means something like a norm has been violated. He developed systems of deontic relevance logic containing a special constant v (notation varies) for this purpose. Such systems have sometimes been characterized as \\"reductions\\" of deontic logic to alethic modal logic. This is misleading at best, however, since alethic modal logics generally do not contain anything like Anderson's special v constant.  Philosophy of logic  Anderson was known for being a Platonist (or realist, or monist) about logic; he believed in \\"The One True Logic,\\" and he believed that it was a relevance logic.

(St. Paul, MN: West, 1991) Aggravated assault, for example, is usually differentiated from simple assault by the offender's intent (e.g., to murder or to rape), the extent of injury to the victim, or the use of a deadly weapon. An aggravating circumstance is a kind of attendant circumstance and the opposite of an extenuating or mitigating circumstance, which decreases guilt. In the UK, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 requires a court to consider (a) relevant previous convictions, (b) racial or religious aggravation, and (c) hostility towards the victim or to persons generally based on sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) or disability (or presumed disability) when determining sentence for a conviction.Criminal Justice Act 2003, sections 143, 145 and 146 The antonym of aggravation is mitigation.

He is the author of the famous romances A Escrava Isaura and O Seminarista. He also introduced to Brazilian poetry the verso bestial√≥gico (, roughly silly verse), also referred to as pantagru√©lico (in a reference to Rabelais's character Pantagruel) ‚Äî poems whose verses are very nonsensical, although very metrical. Under the verso bestial√≥gico, he wrote polemical erotic verses, such as \\"O Elixir do Paj√©\\" (The Witchdoctor's Elixir) and \\"A Origem do M√™nstruo\\" (The Origin of Menstruation). A non-erotic poem written in verso bestial√≥gico is \\"Eu Vi dos Polos o Gigante Alado\\" (From the Poles I Saw the Winged Giant). He is patron of the fifth chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Biography Bernardo Joaquim da Silva Guimar√£es was born in the city of Ouro Preto, in Minas Gerais, to Jo√£o Joaquim da Silva Guimar√£es (a poet) and Constan√ßa Beatriz de Oliveira Guimar√£es. He graduated himself at the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de S√£o Paulo in 1847, where he befriended the poets √Ålvares de Azevedo and Aureliano Lessa. With those and others, he founded the \\"Sociedade Epicureia\\" (\\"Epicurean Society\\") in the same year, and also planned with them an unsuccessful collection of poetry called As Tr√™s Liras (in ). In 1852, he became a judge in the city of Catal√£o, Goi√°s, a post he held until 1854. He moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1858, and, in the following year, worked as a literary critic in the newspaper Atualidade. He returned to his duty of judge of Catal√£o in 1861, but returns once again to Rio de Janeiro in 1864. In 1866, he became teacher of Rhetoric and Poetics in Ouro Preto. He got married in 1867. In 1873, he became teacher of Latin and French in the city of Queluz (now known as Conselheiro Lafaiete), in Minas Gerais. He is honored by the Brazilian monarch Pedro II in 1881.

History The Quincy Junior High School served as the senior high until 1957 The first school dedicated to high school students in Quincy, Illinois opened in 1891 at the corner of 12th and Maine. This \\"Pride of the Gem City\\" served students until 1933 when the \\"new\\" Quincy Senior High (10‚Äì12) opened at 14th and Maine in 1933. The building sits along Historic Maine Street in Quincy and is five stories tall, with mosaic details enscripted on the walls. In 1937, eighth and ninth graders were added to the building to relieve crowding at elementary schools. At this time Webster School and the former high school at 12th and Maine also housed students. As years went on, it was apparent that the 8‚Äì12 setup was not working and a change was needed. The school board decided to build a state of the art high school at 30th and Maine (the site of Baldwin Park) and to convert the current building into a 7‚Äì9 junior high school. The third Quincy Senior High opened at 30th and Maine in 1957. Enrollment again started to climb in the Quincy Schools and another building would be needed. It was decided to construct a second high school to the east of the current high school (the site of the former Gem City Drive In). The new school was named Quincy Senior High II and would house students in grades 11 and 12. The current high school would then house grades 9 & 10 and be renamed Senior High I, and the junior high would include just seventh and eighth graders. All of these changes happened in 1973. In the 1980s, the district experienced several finance problems and an enrollment decline. Because of this, the entire district was reorganized. Senior High I closed in 1982. Tenth grade was moved to Senior High II and ninth grade was moved back to Quincy Junior High. Senior High I was converted into Baldwin Intermediate School for grades 4‚Äì6 . As of early 2014, the Quincy School District is once again considering reorganizing its schools. As of the 2016‚Äì2017 school year, the new additions to Quincy Senior High, including a new building, are complete. The school now houses four grades. Quincy Junior High School, which used to house freshmen, is now a typical American middle school, housing grades 6‚Äì8. Five new elementary schools will be built in Quincy, including one on the site of Baldwin Intermediate School. However, some parts of the old Baldwin School, including Blue Devil Gymnasium, will remain. Sports programs Quincy Senior High School participates in the Illinois High School Association and is a member of the Western Big 6 Conference. Basketball History Quincy, in a 2010 statistical report, was the fourth-winningest high school basketball program in the country, with 1,873 wins since its first game on December 23, 1907. Quincy holds some Illinois state records, including state tournament appearances (32), regional titles (59), sectional titles (32), state tournament games won (52), tournament games lost (33), tournament games played (89), and state trophies won (14). The Blue Devils have claimed two Illinois state championships in their history. The first was in 1934, capping off a 31‚Äì2 season with a 39‚Äì27 victory over Thornton High School in the championship. The second championship came in 1981. The Blue Devils were led by future Iowa standout Michael Payne and Illinois legend Bruce Douglas. The Devils compiled an astounding 33‚Äì0 record, winning their final four state tournament games by a staggering average of 28.25 points. The Blue Devils were also named the National Champions of high school basketball by USA Today that year. The Blue Devils didn't lose again until the state semifinal game in 1982, compiling a 64-game winning streak, which was a record at the time. Tradition On Friday and Saturday nights during basketball season, thousands of Gem City Citizens flock to Blue Devil Gymnasium in Baldwin School to watch the games. Quincy's pregame ritual makes it one of the better places to play in the state of Illinois. Before the national anthem, all the lights in the gym are turned off. The visiting team's lineup is announced with a single light illuminating their team. After the fifth starter is announced, that light is extinguished, and the pep band begins to play an ominous medley of the theme from The Phantom of the Opera and Maynard Ferguson's \\"Conquistador.\\" Then, a student clad in blue shorts, a blue cape, and blue devil horns, emerges from the locker room carrying a flaming trident. He scampers around the perimeter of the court, inciting loud cheers from the crowd. The devil stands at mid- court while the starting lineup is announced as the instrumental \\"Sirius\\" by The Alan Parsons Project plays. As he goes back to the locker room, the lights are turned back on, and the players are ready for the opening tip-off. Quincy Herald-Whig sportswriter Matt Schuckman authored a book entitled Stand Up and Cheer: A Century of Blue Devil Basketball, chronicling the history of the program. Newspaper The school's student newspaper is a monthly publication known as The Q-Review. The Q-Review is completely student-run, with the help of a faculty advisor. Fine arts=Art The many artists of QHS showcase their displays many times during the year. Various works of art can be seen throughout the lobby of A Building, in front of the auditorium. Theatre The QHS Theatre Department presents 2 plays each year in the winter and spring. The Theatre Department combines with the Music Department to present a Fall Musical, Winter Play, Spring Play, and a Spring Variety Show entitled New Faces which has been presented since 1955. Quincy Senior High offers drama classes to all QHS students.

It is part of the Illinois Community College System. Spoon River College's district comprises parts of Schuyler County, McDonough County, Mason County, and Knox County in West-Central Illinois. History Spoon River College was founded on October 17, 1959 as Canton Community College, after the Canton Union School District passed a referendum to establish a junior college,History , Spoon River College website, accessed December 1, 2009 to allow students from the local high school district the opportunity to receive post-secondary education similar to university curriculum. It held its first classes in 1960, using space in the Canton Senior High School building. Authorized by the Illinois General Assembly and signed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner Jr. in 1961, legislation was later enacted that created the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE). The IBHE was tasked by statute with formulating a master plan for higher education in the state of Illinois. In July 1964 the higher education master plan was published by the IBHE, which led to the Junior College Act of 1965. Under the Junior College Act, Canton was classified as a Class II Junior College. In the mid-1960s, the college moved its operations out of the high school building and into leased space in Canton. In 1968 the formation of Junior College District 534 completed the college's separation from the Canton public school district, and the institution was officially renamed Spoon River College and reclassified as a Class I institution. Campus Spoon River College currently has its main campus in on of land four miles from the city of Canton, Illinois. In 1984, a large second location, known as the Macomb Campus, was opened in Macomb, Illinois, and occupied the old Macomb High School building. The building required extensive renovation which took ten-years and $2.6 million to complete. In addition to these two large campuses, the college holds for- credit classes at learning centers in Havana, Illinois and Rushville, Illinois. Spoon River College also holds non-credit and career development classes at two Community Outreach Centers in Macomb and Canton, Illinois. High demand for both credit and non-classes and training at the Macomb Campus has led to the building of an expansion center. The $2.2 million phase one portion of the project was completed in August 2009. A large $10 million expansion is planned for the extension center in the near future. Spoon River College currently operates a satellite campus at the local Illinois River Correctional Center under contract with the Illinois Department of Corrections. SRC holds vocational and rehabilitative classes at the IDOC facility, closed to the public. Spoon River College Macomb, Illinois. Academics and demographics Spoon River College is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) to offer certificates, diplomas, and associate degrees. It received the maximum ten-year accreditation approval by the Higher Learning Commission of the NCA during its last review in 2002. Spoon River College has transfer agreements with four-year colleges and universities such as Western Illinois University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and University of Illinois at Springfield, as a part of the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI), a statewide transfer agreement which ensures general education credits are transferable among more than 100 participating college or universities in Illinois. SRC has a specific dual-enrollment compact with Western Illinois University that began in 1998. The agreement between the schools permits students at SRC to transition into WIU through a pre-defined curriculum and automatic transfer protocol between institutions. In addition to the IAI, SRC offers students a bachelor's degree completion program that allows students to enroll in one of nine participating institutions and take classes at local SRC campuses or online. There are two primary educational tracks at SRC: Transfer Programs, and Career Educational Programs. The two educational tracks offer a total of 35 associate degree programs, and 36 certificate programs. Enrollment As of April 28, 2011, Spring enrollment at SRC was 1,906, of which 943 were enrolled full-time, and 936 were enrolled part-time. In addition, 94 non-credit enrollees were reported by SRC for the same period. In addition, dual credit enrollees obtaining college credit while attending high school stood at 312. Library Spoon River College provides a library within its Learning Resources Center at its main Canton, Illinois Campus. It has facilities for study, research, leisure reading, class preparation, and Internet access for students. Student life=Student housing Although the Illinois Public Community College Act prevents community colleges from building student housing, SRC offers campus housing for its students through a special arrangement with Western Illinois University (WIU). Under a November 1994 agreement between SRC and WIU, SRC students have the opportunity to live in WIU campus housing. The agreement allows a smoother transition for SRC students seeking to transfer to WIU, while allowing the university to utilize unused housing space. Spoon River College students who live on the WIU campus also can access WIU's Beu Health Center.ANNUAL REPORT 2008, Division of Student Services, Western Illinois University Academic clubs and cultural activities SRC hosts several registered student clubs involved in academic, competitive, and cultural based activities. In addition, the campus has an active chapter of Phi Theta Kappa (Œ¶ŒòŒö), the international honor society for two-year colleges and academic programs. SRC also publishes the journal Kaleidoscope, which is a journal of student produced artwork. It is published each spring and offered to the residents of the college district.

Examples include the Renninger negative-result experiment, the Elitzur‚ÄìVaidman bomb-testing problem, and certain double-cavity optical systems, such as Hardy's paradox. In Quantum Computation such measurements are referred to as Counterfactual Quantum Computation, an idea introduced by physicists Graeme Mitchinson and Richard Jozsa. Examples include Keith Bowden's Counterfactual Mirror ArrayBowden, Keith G, \\"Classical Computation can be Counterfactual\\", in Aspects I, Proc ANPA19, Cambridge 1997 (published May 1999), describing a digital computer that could be counterfactually interrogated to calculate whether a light beam would fail to pass through a maze.

Location and features The Thomson River rises below Newlands at the north western end of the Baw Baw Plateau of the Great Dividing Range, where it shares a watershed with the Yarra and Tanjil rivers. From its source, the river flows generally north, then east, then south southeast through its impoundment, then southeast, then east, and finally east by south, joined by seventeen tributaries including the Jordan, Aberfeldy, and Macalister rivers, before reaching its confluence with the Latrobe River near Sale. The river descends over its course. The Thomson Valley was intensively mined for gold during the latter half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Prospector \\"Ned\\" Stringer discovered significant quantities of alluvial gold at the junction of what is now known as Stringers Creek. A short distance up that creek the gold mining township of Walhalla was established. The first person to walk the entire length of the river was Ronald Le Sage, father of David Le Sage, who explored its viability for a cattle droving route in 1959. The river is impounded not far below its source by the Thomson Dam, creating Thomson Reservoir. The reservoir provides around 70% of Melbourne's water storage and supplies about 30% of Melbourne's water needs. This takes about 50% of the river's natural flow, which places a great environmental stress downstream. It particularly affects the Gippsland Lakes, which include Lake Wellington, Lake Victoria and Lake King. This area has international significance as a Ramsar listed wetland site.Environment Victoria - Thomson River Diversion tunnel The Victorian heritage-listed diversion tunnel is located on the river near its junction with Coopers Creek (and the locality of Platina), approximately south-west of . Tunnelling commenced in August 1911 and was completed around October 1912; making the diversion tunnel one of thirteen river diversions surviving from the Victorian gold rush. Etymology In the Australian Aboriginal Brataualung language the river is given two names, , with no defined meaning; and or , meaning \\"brackish water\\". The river was given its English name in 1840 by Angus McMillan in honour of Sir Edward Thomson, the Chief Secretary of the Colony of New South Wales, based in Sydney.

In the 1990s, it began an aggressive move into New York City market with the acquisition of Eastchester Financial Corporation in Eastchester, New York, in 1991; Bayside Federal Savings in Bayside, New York, in 1994; the Bank of Great Neck in Great Neck, New York, in 1995; 10 locations of First Nationwide in 1996; North Side Savings in 1996; Branford Savings Bank (in Branford, Connecticut) in 1997; Home Federal Savings in 1998; Amivest Corporation in 1998; New York Bancorp in 1998;. Reliance Federal Savings & Jamaica Savings Bank FSB in 1999; the domestic deposits of Commercial Bank of New York in 2001 (marking an expansion of its two branches in Manhattan); the Trust Company of New Jersey in 2004, and GreenPoint Financial also in 2004. North Fork Logo Pre-2005 Capital One acquired it and its Melville, New York, headquarters for $14.6 billion U.S. dollars. It was only the second bank bought by Capital One, and was the larger of two acquisitions comprising Capital One's 2005-06 expansion into retail banking. On March 10, 2008, all North Fork Banks began using the Capital One branding. At the time of its acquisition, the bank served the New York City metropolitan area with over 350 branches and around $60 billion in assets. The bank specialized in commercial banking. North Fork Bank CEO John Kanas incorporated the bank in 1980, joined Capital One with the 2006 acquisition, and in 2007, stepped down from his position as Capital One's head of banking. The bank's reporting of unusual transactions of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer led to the criminal investigation that led to the Governor stepping down in March 2008. GreenPoint Mortgage In 2005, North Fork Bank acquired Greenpoint Finance Corp, one of the first innovators of Alt-A mortgages. Capital One later acquired North Fork and thus Greenpoint along with it. In August 2007, as a result of the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, Capital One announced that it was eliminating its GreenPoint Mortgage unit, citing an inability to sell its mortgages on the secondary market. As of November 8, 2017, Capital One no longer offers mortgages. The bank has naming rights to the North Fork Theatre at Westbury (formerly the Westbury Music Fair). It is located in the Westbury postal-zone section of Jericho, New York.

Gillogly (born 5 March 1946) is an American computer scientist and cryptographer. Biography=Early life His interest in cryptography stems from his boyhood, as did his interest in mathematics. By junior high he was inventing his own ciphers and challenging his father, entomologist Lorin Gillogly, to solve them. Gillogly wrote a chess-playing program in the Fortran programming language in 1970, and in 1977 he ported the code for \\"Colossal Cave\\" from Fortran to C. Education He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 1978, receiving a Ph.D. in computer science. His dissertation was on \\"Performance Analysis of the Technology Chess Program\\". Career Gillogly worked as a computer scientist at RAND, specializing in system design and development, and computer security. He has written several articles about technology and cryptography, is currently the editor of the \\"Cipher Exchange\\" column for The Cryptogram, and was president of the American Cryptogram Association. Gillogly was one of the earliest authors of personal computer software, writing utility programs, games and a computerized cookbook published by the Software Toolworks beginning in 1980. Cryptanalysis He is best known for his work solving or debunking some of the world's most famous unsolved codes. In 1980 he wrote a paper on unusual strings in the Beale Ciphers, and he received international media attention for being the first person to publicly solve parts 1-3 on the CIA's Kryptos sculpture in 1999. He also coordinates a large mailing list about the ciphers in the Voynich Manuscript. On the PBS website, they report that he has been called \\"arguably the best non-government cryptanalyst in the U.S.\\" in the field of classical (historical) cryptosystems. In 1995 he deciphered a text enciphered by Robert H. Thouless who had hoped the message could prove that the dead could communicate with the living. Gillogly wrote his own software to decipher the text, which was in a variant of the playfair cipher.

Cowdray Park is a country house at the centre of the Cowdray Estate in Midhurst, West Sussex. Overview The park lies in the South Downs National Park. The estate belongs to Viscount Cowdray, whose family have owned it since 1908. It has a golf course, and it offers clay pigeon shooting and corporate activity days, as well as the more traditional activities of agriculture, forestry and property lets. Cowdray Park Polo Club The estate is home to the Cowdray Park Polo Club, one of the leading polo clubs in the United Kingdom. ...The Queen is greeted by Lord and Lady Cowdray when she arrives at Cowdray Park, Sussex, to watch the Duke of Edinburgh play in a polo match. She wore a pale mauve dress with a triple-row pearl necklace... The sport has been played here for over 100 years. Over 450 polo matches are held at the park each season. The highlight of the polo season is the annual British Open Polo Championship, for the Gold Cup, sponsored for many years by Veuve Clicquot, and now by Jaeger-LeCoultre. The Gold Cup tournament starts at the end of June and runs until the Final late in July. The 2017 Final is on Sunday 23 July 2017.In 2020, the King Power Gold Cup, which is the culmination of the tournament for the British Open Polo is the premier polo tournament in the world at 22 goal (high goal) level. Semifinals and final match will be played between July 15th and 19th. Cowdray House The estate also features the Cowdray House - the former home of the Montague family, built in 1542 and largely destroyed by fire in 1793.

In May 2009 it was announced that Lord Cowdray was seeking a business partner to turn the house into a country house hotel, but the project was abandoned when Cowdray failed to find a partner. It was also announced that Cowdray will be moving to another family property at Fernhurst.Midhurst and Petworth Observer, May 21, 2009 The following year, in September 2010, it was announced that Cowdray House was put on the market for ¬£25 million. Michael Pearson, the fourth Viscount Cowdray, claimed that he did not want his son to inherit the burden of maintaining the house. However, as of September 2011, Lord Cowdray has not found a buyer for the house, which would not include the wider estate, including the Polo Club. The collection housed within Cowdray Park was auctioned in situ by Christie's over three days, between September 13 and 15 2011. Among the objects sold were furniture, silver, paintings, tapestries and porcelain, with a portrait previously identified as Queen Elizabeth I (but now considered more likely to be Catherine Howard, n√©e Carey, Countess of Nottingham) achieving the highest auction price of ¬£325,250. In total, the auction raised ¬£7.9 million.

The federation became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1947. History Scouting was introduced in Lebanon by two teachers, Abdul Satar and Mohammad Abdul Jabbar Khairy who received support from Toufik El Hibri. They came to Lebanon from England in 1912 and established the first Scout troop in the school owned by El Hibri, where they worked. This troop had many activities, later including a trip to Istanbul, Ottoman Empire, where they met with Sultan Mehmed V. Members of this troop played an important role in spreading the Scouting and Guiding movement in Lebanon and other countries. After Lebanon gained its independence in 1943, Scouting further spread rapidly to cover every part of the country. During the Lebanese civil war, Scouts from all associations played an important role in helping civilians, distributing food, medicine, and other forms of aid to refugees. Some Scouting associations formed first aid groups that helped the wounded. Scouts also participated in peace campaigns to help put an end to that war. During the war, Scouts from all sides of the conflict remained brothers and remained in contact with each other, manifesting a good example of unity for all Lebanese. All this added to the reputation of Scouting in Lebanon, with Lebanese people tending to respect Scouts and many parents encouraging their children to join the movement. Today, years after the end of the civil war, Scouting in Lebanon still faces great tasks, with Lebanon being involved in large reconstruction plans aimed to erase effects of the war and to enable it to regain its advanced role in the region and the world. The role of the Scouts include promoting peace and unity through campaigns and summer camps for youth and children. In 1973, Muhammad El Hibri was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. Other recipients include Dr. Farid Karam in 1977 and Rashid Shoucair in 1981. The Arab Regional Jamboree was planned to be held in Lebanon in August 2006. However, without a stable and peaceful environment, the leaders of the Arab Scout Region decided to defer the date of the event to be in Beirut during 2007.

There is strong Guide/Scout cooperation in planning training courses, youth program, seminars and hosting international activities. Jamborees, leader training courses, seminars and conferences are held throughout the year on the sub-provincial, national and international levels. The organization has adopted relevant programs in the fields of conservation, Scouting with the handicapped, child health and desert Scouting.

The membership badge of the Public Scout and Girl Guide Movement incorporates a palm tree and other agricultural produce. The Public Scout and Girl Guide Movement escaped the ban on almost any form of independent organisation, when Muammar Gaddafi was ruler of Libya, because of its non-political stance and because Gaddafi was briefly a Scout while growing up in the southern town of Sabha. However, in the Libyan Civil War Scouts acted as front-line support troops for the anti-Gaddafi forces.

Gabriel VIII was originally from Meer, Egypt and his lay name was Shenouda. He became a monk in the Monastery of Saint Pishoy in Scetes and was ordained on Sunday, 16 Paoni, 1303 A.M. (June 20, 1587 AD). Avva Zacharias, Bishop of Jerusalem, and Avva Kyrellos El-Khiami led Gabriel's consecration in the Church of Saint Mercurius in Old Cairo. At the time of his ordination the Copts were divided, and they chose for themselves four different patriarchs. Gabriel's papacy was later accepted by the Coptic community. He was contemporary of the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I. During his papacy, Gabriel VIII decreed that the Fast of the Apostles must start on 21 Paoni and end on 5 Epip, and that Advent must start on the first of Koiak. He also suppressed the Fast of Jonah, and allowed the Fast of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary to be optional.

They were the last steam locomotives ordered by the railroad. They were ordered to improve service on the Lackawanna's express passenger trains west of Scranton, Pennsylvania, towards Buffalo, New York. Apart from a six-mile helper district just west of Scranton and Dansville Hill between Groveland and Perkinsville, New York, this was flat, high-speed running. The railroad's existing 4-8-2 \\"Mountain\\" types were proving increasingly inadequate for this service as train lengths increased and because of the drag of air-conditioning equipment. However, the railroad's existing 4-8-4 \\"Pocono\\" types, used east of Scranton, were bigger and more powerful than this service required and such use would be wasteful. Therefore, the DL&W; ordered five powerful Hudsons dedicated for this service. Being the only DL&W; locomotives dedicated to flat-land service, they had the largest driving wheels used on the system at . Unusually for a Hudson, they were not equipped with booster engines, relying on their fairly high starting tractive effort of . This was not quite equal to the Mountain types they replaced, but their available power at speed was far greater. Although built alongside the New York Central Railroad's J-3a Hudsons at ALCO's Schenectady, New York plant, they represented a quite different locomotive philosophy, being significantly heavier and more powerful. To keep all the Lackawanna's six-drivered passenger power together in the 11xx number series, the new locomotives were numbered 1151‚Äì1155, taking the place of several Pacifics that had been recently converted into 0-8-0 switchers. The five locomotives only lasted ten years in their original intended assignments, since the Lackawanna dieselized its express passenger trains in 1947. The Hudsons were relegated to lesser assignments such as commuter trains, and began to be seen on the eastern end of the railroad. One assignment was the early morning Merchants Express (Train 26) from Scranton to Hoboken, New Jersey, returning in the late afternoon hauling the Scrantonian (Train 11). Another was the Interstate Express (Train 1301), received from the Reading Railroad/Jersey Central at Taylor Junction, near Scranton, and hauled to Binghamton, New York. They also saw service between Binghamton and Syracuse on the Syracuse Branch. Even in this service, they did not last long. All five were withdrawn from service in 1951‚Äì1953 and subsequently scrapped; none of the railroad's later steam locomotives survived the cutter's torch.

The technique was invented at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment at Malvern by a team of scientists including Tom Elliott.Editor worked with Tom Elliot at RRE Malvern The detector allows the build up of detected infrared signal in a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) photoconductor strip, on a sapphire substrate, by applying a bias current through the strip. The detector is used in a scanned thermal imager and the bias voltage is adjusted to force electrons produced by the detected energy at one end of the strip to drift to the far end of the strip in time with the rate of the scanning such that energy from the same response is built up along the full length of the strip. This allows a much simpler way of integrating responses than linking separate detector cells. This type of detector was used in a series of thermal imagers known as TICM (thermal imaging common modules). These modules were the mainstay of UK forces thermal imagers from the 1980s until their replacement by fully staring, two- dimensional-arrays detectors.

Common connection technologies include unlicensed wireless (Wi-Fi, wireless mesh networks), licensed wireless (such as WiMAX), and fiber optic cable. Although many cities previously deployed Wi-Fi based solutions, municipal fiber-to-the-home networks are becoming more prominent because of increased demand for modern audio and video applications, which are increasing bandwidth requirements by 40% per year. Wireless public networks Wireless public municipal broadband networks avoid sometimes unreliable hub and spoke distribution models and use mesh networking instead. This method involves relaying radio signals throughout the whole city via a series of access points or radio transmitters, each of which is connected to at least two other transmitters. Mesh networks provide reliable user connections and are also faster to build and less expensive to run than the hub and spoke configurations. Internet connections can also be secured through the addition of a wireless router to an existing wired connection ‚Äì a convenient method for Internet access provision in small centralized areas. Although wireless routers are generally reliable, their occasional failure means no Internet availability in that centralized area. This is why companies now use mesh networking in preference to hub and spoke configurations. Three basic models for the operation and funding of Wi-Fi networks have emerged: * Networks designed solely for use by municipal services (fire, police, planners, engineers, libraries, etc.). Municipal funds are used to establish and run the network; * Quasi-public networks for use by both municipal services and private users owned by the municipality but operated for profit by private companies (\\"private hot spots\\"). Such networks are funded by specially earmarked tax revenues then operated and maintained on a chargeable basis by private service providers; * Private service providers using public property and rights of way for a fee. These allow for in-kind provision of private access to public rights of way to build-out and maintain private networks with a 'lease payment' or percentage of profits paid to the municipality.  Backhaul and wired infrastructure  In Stockholm, the city- owned Stokab provides network infrastructure through dark fiber to several hundred service providers who provide various alternative services to end users. Reggefiber in the Netherlands performs a similar role. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency provides service at one network layer higher through a fiber network. This system's capacity is wholesaled to fifteen service providers who in turn provide retail services to the market. A final model is a provision of all layers of service, such as in Chaska, Minnesota, where the city has built and operated a Wi-Fi Internet network that provides email and web hosting applications. These different models involve different public-private partnership arrangements, and varying levels of opportunity for private sector competition.  Advantages  Municipal broadband offers a number of advantages to consumers and to the economy. Such networks often provide high speed Internet access more cheaply than other current broadband service providers, if not for free. Different cities adopt different models according to their needs. Municipal broadband not only provides high speed Internet access for free it also lowers prices, creates competition, and boosts economic development. These advantages help keep prices down and networks functioning efficiently. Municipal broadband companies are faced with a constantly changing and highly competitive market with many operators. This keeps prices down and makes broadband affordable in rural and low-income communities. In a 2004 White House report, the President called for \\"universal, affordable access for broadband technology by the year 2007\\" and \\"plenty of technology choices when it comes to purchasing broadband\\". Worker productivity can also increase as a result of municipal broadband by giving city officials such as police officers and firefighters remote access to information. Intelligent transport systems rely on fiber- optic infrastructure to network and manage thousands of traffic signals in large metropolitan areas every day. Building inspectors can issue reports and access networked data while conducting inspections. Public buildings in remote areas can be connected through Wi-Fi without the expense of fiber or private telecommunications contracts. Police officers can access security cameras, blueprints, criminal records and other necessary information. Networks can allow officers to show witnesses mug shots or \\"virtual lineups\\" at the scene of a crime, instead of at a police station. The Department of Homeland Security provides funding for cities that use municipal networks for these applications.Wilson. Not only does municipal broadband help public servants with their jobs, it also helps close the digital divide. Such services help bridge the gap by providing people with public access to the Internet. This allows low income families, travelers, and city officials to access important information without budgetary considerations in mind. The importance of free Internet access is based on information availability, for example students with no home based access are able to log on to the Internet using municipal broadband. Commentators hope that municipal broadband networks will make cities more attractive to businesses, especially high-tech and research companies, which are dependent on communication. Communication also enables small and home-based businesses to participate in international and regional commerce. Municipal broadband also allows companies to recruit new employees who can telecommute without physically relocating.Ellison. In 2000, the Federal Communications Commission endorsed municipal broadband as a \\"best practice\\" for bringing broadband to under served communities. The FCC also addressed the question of whether a municipality was an \\"entity\\" under the Telecommunications Act which mandates that \\"No State or local statute or regulation, or other State or local legal requirement, may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.\\" 47 USC 253(a). The legal question revolved around whether a state could prevent a municipality, as its subordinate government body, from entering the telecommunication market. In the case of Missouri Municipal League v. Nixon, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that a municipality was not an entity under the Telecommunications Act and that a state could determine what authority its own subordinate jurisdictions had. Some cable companies have additionally viewed municipal broadband as an opportunity to expand their market. The Free Press, the Media Access Project, and the ACLU have all come out in favor of municipal broadband. Governments have the advantage of being able to take a long term view and write off investments in municipal broadband over longer time periods. Private companies on the other hand, especially publicly traded ones, have to show profitability in a very short period. This indicates that governments are the best entities to create a broadband network‚Äîas infrastructure‚Äîthen allow private companies to run it and deliver services such as IPTV, telephony and Internet access. In this way, governments are able to create a competitive environment where the network owner does not determine which services consumers can receive. \\"Structurally separation\\" or \\"functional separation\\" are terms often used to describe broadband as infrastructure that is open to all service providers. Governments may also be driven by their desire to lay down critical broadband infrastructure that serves a larger constituency made up of individuals, small businesses, schools, government entities and service providers. Building open-access local broadband networks can help with the infrastructure of a town and provide benefits to the townspeople that compensate for the costs involved. Having a publicly owned infrastructure provides a positive outcome in economic development as it attracts more locally owned businesses who can rely on high speed Internet connections to help their businesses. Such networks also deliver ubiquitous coverage in areas where private companies cannot own and operate public broadband networks. Enhanced services are included whereby townspeople can benefit from a greater diversity of value-added products. Security is a further issue with the need for a reliable integrated high-speed communications infrastructure at both a national, and a local level necessary for hospitals, schools, businesses etc. to provide a quick and large-scale responses to emergencies. The city of Philadelphia had the nonprofit Wireless Philadelphia accept bid from Earthlink to set up a network in 2004. \\"Philadelphia‚Äôs expectations were high; the city was eager, optimistic and, by the end of the decade, altogether too quick to chalk Wireless Philadelphia up as a failure. Still, the project was critical in laying the groundwork for future endeavors. Some of the hardware is still in use for an emergency communications network.\\" Harvard Law School professor Susan P. Crawford, argued in a New York Times opinion piece that lowering the barriers to the creation of \\"open municipal-level fiber networks\\" would help ensure the sort of Internet access that proponents of net neutrality rules argue for, even in the absence of those rules.  Opposition  The increasing prominence of municipal broadband has led to opposition. Critics argue that the construction and implementation of broadband service is an inappropriate use of public funds that can be invested elsewhere, and that on some occasions (such as EPB and iProvo), the high cost of maintaining the network is passed onto residents via either taxes or exorbitant rates, for services that may not necessarily meet the quality or reliability of a commercial ISP. In an op-ed, Larry Irving stated that \\"private sector ownership generally is more effective and efficient, promotes innovation, and helps assure freedom of speech and open networks\\". Trump administration FCC commissioner Michael O'Rielly argued that governments were infringing on their residents' First Amendment rights via prohibitions on \\"hateful\\" or \\"threatening\\" speech in the acceptable usage policies for their broadband networks‚Äîeven though these restrictions are general, boilerplate terms also used by commercial ISPs. Incumbents typically lobby in favor of state-level legislation ‚Äî often based on a model act drafted by the industry and distributed by the conservative lobbying group American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) ‚Äî that seek to frustrate the deployment or expansion of municipal broadband networks. These can include requiring that cities hold a referendum to seek approval, instituting regulatory burdens on the approval process or their operations (including requiring competing bids from private entities), restricting municipal broadband providers from expanding outside of their jurisdiction, restricting them to only being a wholesale provider for private entrants, prohibiting municipal broadband in cities above a certain population, and restricting access to utility poles (thus requiring underground digging, which can be costlier), among others. In April 2019, Broadband Now reported that 26 states had such laws. The successful campaign to hold a referendum on municipal broadband in Fort Collins, Colorado was opposed by the Colorado Cable Telecommunications Association (which included incumbent Comcast), who spent nearly $1 million on lobbying efforts. Groups backed by the Koch brothers, including the Internet Freedom Coalition, and the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, have also been involved in lobbying efforts against municipal broadband projects. In 2015, the FCC acted to preempt state laws that restrict municipal broadband providers from extending their service beyond their current boundaries. The FCC grounded its ruling in Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which grants the FCC the authority to encourage the expansion of broadband by using \\"measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market, or other regulating methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment.\\" A challenge to this was won by the states of Tennessee and North Carolina on August 10, 2016 in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ruled that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not give the FCC the right to prevent states from prohibiting municipal broadband, on the grounds that the FCC could not reallocate power between a state and its subdivisions. The FCC declined to appeal. Finance In an effort to support U.S. federal government agencies attempting to deploy broadband services more widely, in a 2009 report the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation detailed cost estimates of providing \\"fiber optic connectivity to anchor institutions\\" in the United States. The institutions considered in the report were public schools, public libraries, hospitals and community colleges, with an estimated total cost of USD 5‚Äì10 billion.Preliminary Cost Estimates on Connecting Anchor Institutions to Fiber September 25, 2009 On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act became law in an effort to build the economy, assist in job creation and retention, and improve U.S. infrastructure. It allocated $4.7 billion to establish a Broadband Technology Opportunities Program as part of the National Telecommunications and Information Agency State Broadband Data and Development Grant Program. A portion of funding awards were allocated to extend and develop broadband services to reach rural and \\"underserved areas\\" as well as to improve broadband access for public safety agencies.{{cite news url=http://connectedplanetonline.com/news/Broadband-Stimulus-post-game- recap-1005/ title=Broadband Stimulus Post-Game Recap date=5 October 2010 In 2010, the NTIA awarded a $126.3 million grant to the state of West Virginia to improve the state's broadband infrastructure, particularly for public facilities such as hospitals, libraries, and schools. However, a report from West Virginia's legislative auditor suggested that the state had misused the stimulus money, including having wasted an estimated $7.9‚Äì15 million on purchasing high-capacity Cisco routers that, in many cases, were also being installed in smaller facilities which did not require such extensive network capacity. Governor Earl Ray Tomblin established a task force to investigate the overspending. In January 2014, the NTIA rejected a proposal by the state to use the remaining $2.5 million (plus other funding, including credits from Cisco for having returned the oversized routers from earlier) to fund a middle mile network, for not reaching \\"programmatic requirements\\" and missing a deadline for its use.  United States policy  Examples from outside the United States  The Dutch capital, Amsterdam has its own municipal broadband project called: ‚ÄúCitynet Amsterdam.‚Äù This project is a partnership between the city and private investors that provides fiber cables to 40,000 buildings in the city. The European Commission has made broadband internet access a priority as part of its \\"Europe 2020 Strategy\\" Different system models are more popular than others depending on the needs of the region. One example is \\"publicly run municipal network model\\" In this system, the local government installs and runs the broadband system. These systems are particularly common in Nordic countries.

Its first version, ImageJ 1.x, is developed in the public domain, while ImageJ2 and the related projects SciJava, ImgLib2, and SCIFIO are licensed with a permissive BSD-2 license. ImageJ was designed with an open architecture that provides extensibility via Java plugins and recordable macros. Custom acquisition, analysis and processing plugins can be developed using ImageJ's built-in editor and a Java compiler. User-written plugins make it possible to solve many image processing and analysis problems, from three-dimensional live-cell imaging to radiological image processing, multiple imaging system data comparisons to automated hematology systems. ImageJ's plugin architecture and built-in development environment has made it a popular platform for teaching image processing. ImageJ can be run as an online applet, a downloadable application, or on any computer with a Java 5 or later virtual machine. Downloadable distributions are available for Microsoft Windows, the classic Mac OS, macOS, Linux, and the Sharp Zaurus PDA. The source code for ImageJ is freely available from GitHub. The project developer, Wayne Rasband, retired from the Research Services Branch of the National Institute of Health in 2010, but continues to develop the software. Features ImageJ can display, edit, analyze, process, save, and print 8-bit color and grayscale, 16-bit integer, and 32-bit floating point images. It can read many image file formats, including TIFF, PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM, and FITS, as well as raw formats. ImageJ supports image stacks, a series of images that share a single window, and it is multithreaded, so time-consuming operations can be performed in parallel on multi-CPU hardware. ImageJ can calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined selections and intensity-thresholded objects. It can measure distances and angles. It can create density histograms and line profile plots. It supports standard image processing functions such as logical and arithmetical operations between images, contrast manipulation, convolution, Fourier analysis, sharpening, smoothing, edge detection, and median filtering. It does geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation, and flips. The program supports any number of images simultaneously, limited only by available memory. History Before the release of ImageJ in 1997, a similar freeware image analysis program known as NIH Image had been developed in Object Pascal for Macintosh computers running pre-OS X operating systems. Further development of this code continues in the form of Image SXM, a variant tailored for physical research of scanning microscope images. A Windows version ‚Äì ported by Scion Corporation (now defunct), so-called Scion Image for Windows ‚Äì was also developed. Both versions are still available but ‚Äì in contrast to NIH Image ‚Äì closed-source.

Bruce Jones, president of U.S. Submarines, Inc. Tuesday, 11 September 2018 Location The proposed location was Katafanga Island in Fiji. With a design concept in mind, Jones needed to find an appropriate location. To help find it, Jones offered a $10,000 reward for anybody that came up with the perfect location for the venture. After taking the suggestion of a business associate, who recommended a reef off Eleuthera, an island in the Bahamas, negotiations began with the island's American owners. The negotiations did not go well, and after a year of failed back-and-forth offers the location was scrapped and sights were set off Fiji. Features The resort was to feature twenty-four guest rooms, an underwater restaurant and bar, a library, conference room, wedding chapel, spa and a luxury suite. Reservations at the resort were to be priced at $30,000 per couple per week.

It is also a reparation for the profanation of Sunday and the Holy Days of Obligation. Description On March 16, 1844, Jesus reportedly told Sr. Marie: \\"Oh if you only knew what great merit you acquire by saying even once, Admirable is the Name of God, in a spirit of reparation for blasphemy.\\" Sister Mary stated that Jesus told her that the two sins which offend Him the most grievously are blasphemy and the profanation of Sunday.

A typical Italian charm bracelet comprises eighteen Italian charm links. Each link features an Italian charm face (design or image) soldered onto the actual Italian charm link. History Designed in Italy, the Italian charm craze caught on and even soccer players wore these bracelets featuring their country's flag. In the 1990s, American tourists noticed the style and brought it back to the United States where the fashion caught on. Modular design How they work A starter Italian charm bracelet consists of eighteen blank links. In order to create a personalized Italian charm bracelet, these blank links are replaced with individually designed Italian charms. Italian charms are flat, modular links that hook together. While traditional charms dangle, Italian charms feature individual pieces soldered flat onto the surface of the link. Italian charms are compatible across brands due to standardized sizing. The modular design means that the charms on an Italian charm bracelet are interchangeable. An individual Italian charm can be switched out for a new look or to better suit the mood or changing interests of an individual. Styles Laser engraved charms An Italian charm bracelet can be assembled in many styles. Italian charms can be grouped to follow a theme such as family, a specific color, career or hobby. Also, since there are many types of Italian charms, an Italian charm bracelet can feature a combination of styles. This may include laser Italian charms, photo Italian charms, hand-painted Italian charms, authentic licensed Italian charms, deluxe-link Italian charms and dangle Italian charms among others. Materials Italian charms are most often crafted using stainless steel backing and a gold-plated or 18-karat gold charm face. The face of the charm (which features the design) is soldered or glued to the stainless steel link.

Large parts of the Netherlands today are below sea level and have in the past been covered by the sea or flooded at regular intervals. The modern Netherlands formed as a result of the interplay of the four main rivers (Rhine, Meuse, Schelde and IJssel) and the influence of the North Sea. The Netherlands is mostly composed of deltaic, coastal and eolian derived sediments during the Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods. Fairly all of the west Netherlands is composed of the Rhine-Meuse river estuary, but human intervention greatly modified the natural processes at work. Most of the western Netherlands is below sea level due to the human process of turning standing bodies of water into usable land, a polder. In the east of the Netherlands, remains are found of the last ice age, which ended approximately ten thousand years ago. As the continental ice sheet moved in from the north, it pushed moraine forward. The ice sheet halted as it covered the eastern half of the Netherlands. After the ice age ended, the moraine remained in the form a long hill-line. The cities of Arnhem and Nijmegen are built upon these hills. Sedimentary succession Map of the Netherlands Paleozoic Era Rocks from the Carboniferous period (360 - 299 mya) outcrop in the southeastern province of Limburg, e.g. in the Heimans quarry. Younger sediments (Permian in age) are not exposed at surface. The subsurface of the Netherlands (including the Dutch sectors of the North Sea) is geologically far more significant especially with respect to the occurrence of oil and gas resources. The Slochteren reservoir rock in Groningen is an eolian sandstone from the Rotliegend (lower Permian). This reservoir has excellent porosity and permeability characteristics and supplies the vast majority of the Dutch natural gas reserves. The lateral equivalent of this reservoir comes at surface near the German town of Bad Bentheim. The latest Permian deposits in the area of northwestern Europe was characterised by the laying down of thick successions of rocksalt and anhydrite. This Zechstein stage also comprises dolomites and limestones. The salt is mined in the east of the Netherlands (in villages as Boekelo) and forms an excellent seal over the deeper North Sea reservoirs. Mesozoic Era Mesozoic rocks are exposed in the Netherlands in the quarry near Winterswijk (Triassic Muschelkalk limestones). The Jurassic Posidonia Shale is well developed but is buried deep in the West and under the North Sea. It acts as source rock for oil fields in the West Netherlands Basin. During late Jurassic times the Zuidwal volcano was active in a now submerged part of the Netherlands known as the Wadden Sea. During Cretaceous times, most of the Netherlands was covered by a warm shallow (inland) sea in which thick successions of chalk were deposited. This is in places chert- bearing; chalk is mined near the southern city of Maastricht and the Maastrichtian stage was named after this locality. Here a number of mosasaur- fossils have been excavated as well. The Schoonebeek oil-bearing sandstones are Early Cretaceous in age and underlain by hydrocarbon-rich Lower Cretaceous lacustrine Coevorden Formation which forms the source rock for the east Netherlands oil. Cenozoic Era The Cenozoic is characterised by a further shallowing and erosion of earlier sediments. In places a reasonable thickness of Paleocene and Eocene sediments is reached, but most of the subsurface of the Netherlands lack deposits of this age. The recent Netherlands is formed by Pleistocene and Holocene age sediments as result of (glacio)-fluvial, eolian and marine sedimentation. Eolian dunes characterise the North Sea coast, a horseshoe-shaped moraine forms the Utrecht Hill Ridge (Dutch: Utrechtse Heuvelrug) and the river influence is still visible all over the Netherlands. Tectonics and orogeny Although the Netherlands seems to be a tectonically quiet area, a number of fault activities have been shown in the past. The latest strong earthquake, the 1992 Roermond earthquake (5.4 on Richter scale), had its epicenter close to the Limburg city of Roermond. The south of the Netherlands is topographically higher and is linked to the geology of the Ardennes and the London-Brabant Massif. The Lower Rhine Graben, part of the European Cenozoic Rift System, which has been tectonically active since the Oligocene, affects the southwestern part of the Netherlands.

Nyingma scholar Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche states that the Ch√∂d tradition developed by Machig Labdr√∂n is \\"a radical synthesis of the Prajnaparamitra tradition and tantra guru yoga that 'cuts' through the ego.\\"Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, Illuminating the Path, pg 189. Padmasambhava Buddhist Center, 2008. Historical texts portray Machig Labdr√∂n as the originator of the Ch√∂d lineage which she developed in Tibet. This was confirmed in her own lifetime by Indian Brahmins and others, and Machig Labdron's creation of the Chod lineage is not doubted by its modern practitioners. The influences of other practices on Ch√∂d are debated. Some posit Machig Labdron may have come from a B√∂n family, a position which contradicts historical records. According to Namkhai Norbu, Ch√∂d might be interpreted through combining native shamanism with the Dzogchen teachings. Other Buddhist teachers and scholars offer differing interpretations of the origins of Ch√∂d, and not all of them agree that Ch√∂d has B√∂n or shamanistic roots. Iconography Iconographically, Machig Labdr√∂n is depicted holding a large drum (Skt. damaru), a specific ritual item in the practice of Chod, in her right hand and a bell (Skt. gha·πá·π≠a) () in her left. Her right leg is often lifted and the standing left leg is bent in motion, in a dancing posture. Machig Labdron is depicted as white in color with three eyes and a pleasing countenance. She wears the Six Bone Ornaments of the charnel grounds, and stands on a lotus. Above Machig Labdron is Buddha Shakyamuni and mahasiddhas and the Chod lineage masters, while specific teachers and lineage holders are on either side. Below her is a tantric deity holding a Chod bone trumpet and swinging skins, while Gesar and a wrathful tantric dakini are on either side. Biography=Names Apart from the name Machig Labdr√∂n used here, the following spellings and transliterations are also found, all referring to the same person: * Machik Lapkyi Dr√∂nma (Wylie: ma gcig lab kyi sgron ma), * Machig Lapdr√∂nme (Wylie: ma gcig lab sgron ma), * Machik Labdron (Wylie: ma gcig lab sgron), * Maji Lab Dran (Wylie: ma gcig lab sgron), and * Machig Laphyi (Wylie: ma-gcig la-phyi sgron-ma) referring to her place of birth, La-phyi, in the region of √ú-Tsang.The Yoniverse * Machik Labdronma, the often used name by Tibetans One of Machig Labdr√∂n's teachers, S√∂nam Lama, gave her the tantric name of Dorje Wangchuma (), which means \\"Diamond Independent Goddess.\\"Nuns of the unique Joyul (gcod-yul)Sect of Tibetan Buddhism see \\"2. Yogini Macik Labdron (ma- ciglab-sgron) and the Formation of Joyul Sect\\" Predictions of her birth In the Life of Yeshe Tsogyel, Padmasambhava predicted that Yeshe Tsogyal would be reborn as Machig Labdr√∂n, and her consort, Atsara Sale,some information on Atsara Sahle from Nepal The Website of the Darma Fellowship of His Holiness the Gyalwa Karmapa would become Topa Bhadra, Machig Labdron's consort. Her assistant and Padmasambhava's secondary consort, Tashi Khyidren, would be reborn as Machig Labdron's daughter, and so on. All of the important figures in Yeshe Tsogyel's life were to be reborn in the life of Machig Labdron, including Padmasambhava himself, who would become Phadampa Sangye.Women of Wisdom, Extract: MACHIG LAPDRON by Ts√ºltrim Allione Tibetan Buddhists believe Machig Labdron was the Mind Stream emanation (tulku) of Yeshe Tsogyal, as well as \\"an emanation of the 'Great Mother of Wisdom,' Yum Chenmo,(prajnaparamita) and of Arya Tara, who transmitted to her teachings and initiations.\\" Buddhists believe this pattern of reincarnations and emanations continued into the life just before her birth as Machig Labdr√∂n and that in the lifetime before, she was the Indian yogi, M√∂nlam Drub. After his death, the body of the twenty- year-old M√∂nlam Drub is said to have remained \\"alive\\" in the cave of Potari in South India. According to tradition, it was M√∂nlam Drub's mindstream which entered the womb of Bum Cham \\"Great Noble Woman\\", who lived in the area of Labchi Eli Gangwar in Tibet, which caused the birth of Machig Labdron. According to one version of Machig Labdron's biography, Machig Labdron's mother experienced auspicious dreams of dakinis shortly after conception, dreams which contained the vase and the conch of the Ashtamangala: Dreams continued for her mother until the birth and Machig Labdron's sister also had prophetic dreams. Directly before the birth, Machig Labdron instructed her mother on preparations for her swaddling, and Bum Chan also felt the sounds of the reciting syllables \\"ah\\" and \\"ha ri ni sa\\". Birth and early childhood Machig Labdron's birth in 1055, on the 15th day of the third Tibetan lunar month, was accompanied by auspicious music, rainbow lights, reciting syllables, and with an open third eye. She sat upright immediately, and asked if her mother was well. Her first food was butter.Sara Harding, Machik's Complete Explanation Clarifying the Meaning of Chod, pg 58-91. 2013, Shambala [online version], https://issuu.com/tdongjhapa/docs/harding__sarah_- _machik_s_complete_explanation_cla She was born in a fortressed village called Tsomer in Tamsho, in the Labshi region. Her father was Choyki Dawa, and her mother was Lungmo Bumcam. She had three siblings, and the 16 year old sister Bumey was present at the birth. The mother decided to guard Machig Labdron from the father, but the father decided to guard her as a family secret. Her elder brother was Shakya Gyaltsen, and another brother was born later. Machig Labdron began reciting mantra at three years of age, reading at five years, and at eight years of age could quickly recite the Prajnaparamita text \\"The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Verses\\". Machig Labdron was called \\"Ahdron\\" (the Light of Ah) and \\"Drontse\\" by the community, and referred to herself as \\"Rinchen Dronme\\". The local king gave her the name of Lapdron. At thirteen years of age, she began studying buddhism with Geshe Aton alongside her sister, previously ordained as the nun Tontso Rinchen Bum. Her ability in the expositions of Prajanaparamita texts surpassed those of the Geshes and monks. After three years with Geshe Aton, he suggested Machig Labdron move to continue studies of buddhism with Drapa Ngongshechen in Yoru Dratang, at the Dopthrang monastery, where she moved with her sister and lived as a renunciate after receiving lay practitioner vows and bodhisattva vows. She became Lama Drapa's official reader, and at sixteen years of age participated as a recitation chaplin while reciting the Prajnaparamita Sutras, or 'The Perfection of Wisdom', a Mahayana sutra, for lay people in their homes on behalf of her teacher. Young adulthood The namtar entitled Secret Biography of Machig Labdron relates the struggles that Machig Labdron underwent in order to avoid traditional marriage and eventually leave home to practice Buddhism as her life's calling. Machig Labdron's early teacher, Drapa Ngongshechen, gave her the reading transmissions for the Many Sutras, the Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Verses, in Twenty-Five Thousand Verses and in Eight Thousand Verses. She assimilated the sutras and commentaries, and realization arose. He asked her to stay for four years, after which he advised her to continue studies with Kyoton Sonam Lama.Tsem Tulku Rinpoche, Great Lamas and Masters, Machik Labdron, https://www.tsemrinpoche.com/tsem-tulku-rinpoche/great-lamas-masters/machik- labdron.html With her realizations, Machig Labdron began to cut attachments to places and started to travel and live spontaneously as a yogini, while eating what she found, sleeping wherever, and wearing clothes of a beggar. When she was twenty years of age, Sonam Lama conferred a series of empowerments on Machig Labdron at a temple in Ei Gangwa, during which her famous ultimate empowerments into the nature of reality from the sambogakaya occurred. Later, Sonam Lama also conferred tantra, the Five Deities of Varahi, Secret Yoga Mantra, and transmissions which empower explanation, composition, and debate. Sonam Lama gave Machig Labdron the name of Queen of Vajra Space (rdo rje dbyings phyug ma) to match her level of accomplishment. During the famous empowerment, Arya Tara foretold of a meeting with Indian pandita Topa Bhadra, or Topa Draya (), an emanation of the Buddha Kapala. But before, Machig Labdron met and received teachings from well-known Indian yogi Padampa Sanggye, also known as Dampa Sangye, a reincarnation of Padmasambhava, as foretold. Using esoteric sutra and tantra precepts of the paramitra, he conferred direct mind instructions, the Path of Guru Yoga, blessing empowerments, profound vajrayana Dzogchen practices, and numerous specific and profound empowerments and transmissions. Her realizations increased. Padampa Sanggye revealed both Buddha Shakyamuni and Manjushri predicted Machig Labdron's reincarnation and realizations. The Buddha referred to her by the name \\"Dronma\\", and Manjushri wrote, \\"...She will wander through towns, villages, and valleys, Charnel grounds and hermitages, And her teachings will spread\\". Machig Labdron spent three years in central Tibet. While preparing for travels as a recitation chaplin in Echung, she had three prophetic dreams about Topa Bhadra before they met. On her journey, she received a teaching on Interdependent Origination from Red Manjushri. Machig Labdron and Topa Bhadra met during her recitations and became spiritual consorts, while the prophesies that the union would lead to great benefit for beings were actualized. She was 23 years of age. He was also a Buddhist practitioner that later supported Machig Labdron in her practices. She then lived with him, and received some criticism for disregarding ordinary societal norms that contradicted the radical nature of Chod. Together, they had two sons and one daughter (or two sons and two daughters, or three sons and two daughters by some accounts). As a tantra practitioner while developing the Ch√∂d tradition, Machig Labdron practiced with Dampa Sangye as her guru and reincarnation of Padmasambhava, which led to further profound realizations. Machig Labdron also practiced with her spiritual consort Topa Bhadra with whom she raised a family, living on the \\"red and white essence,\\" according to a prediction given to Machig Labdron by Arya Tara.Short Biography Machig Labdron's teachers are also listed as Lama Shamarpa, Lama Beton (possibly the same as Aton), Lama Yartingpa, and Phamtingpa, from which she received vajrayana teachings, Great Completion Dzogchen empowerments and transmissions, and Mahamudra empowerments and transmissions. Motherhood Early in her life, Machig Labdron spent time living primarily in monasteries before cutting attachments to certain places. She was a vajrayana practitioner and realized when she met Topa Bhadra. After their initial union, she and her consort had children which became students and Chod lineage holders. The exact number of children might be debated. In some sources, her three sons were Nyingpo Drubpa, Drubchung, and Yangdrub. Her two daughters were Kongcham and Lacham. In Sara Harding's translations, an elder son was named Drubpa, and another was named Kongpo Kyab or Drupse, while the youngest child and daughter was Drub Chungma. Machig Labdron's son Drupse became the monk Tonyon Samdrup (thod-smyon bsam-grub), one of her main successors and a propagator of the Chod lineage. He took monk's vows at the age of 15 from Dampa Sangye after moving to Red House where Machig Labdron's seat was located. Tonyon Samdrup was known as the \\"Snowman of Shampogang\\" and began the tradition of black hat-wearing Chod practitioners named \\"Gangpa\\". One of her sons started out as a thief. Machig Labdron was eventually able to bring him to the Dharma and became his teacher: \\"You may think that Gods are the one's who give you benefits, and Demons cause damage; but it may be the other way round. Those who cause pain teach you to be patient, and those who give you presents may keep you from practising the Dharma. So it depends on their effect on you if they are Gods or Demons,\\" she said. At the age of 35, prophesies continued to actualize. Machig Labdron showed signs of weariness of cyclic existence, and traveled to see Sonam Lama, Lama Drupa, and Padampa Sanggye. During those visits, she received teachings and empowerments, and prophesies about a move to the Copper Mountain in central Tibet. She also restrengthened her commitments by taking, or re-taking, lay vows and bodisattva vows. Machig Labdr√∂n's life as a spiritual master Machig Labdron then returned to living as a renunciate at the age of 37, shaved her head and moved to a cave at Zangri Kangmar in the Copper Mountain. Her students gathered there and a community formed around her seat at the Red House. Machig Labdron's numerous followers came from Tibet and Nepal, and included lamas, geshes, monks, nuns, kings, queens, ministers, chiefs, and lay people including lepers and beggars. \\"The reputation of her merit and teachings became known even in India.\\"University of Virginia, ITS Collaboration, Biography of Machik Labdron, https://collab.its.virginia.edu/wiki/renaissanceold/Biography%20Of%20Machik%20Labdr√∂n.html At the age of 42, Topa Bhadra brought her younger son, Drupse, and her daughter, Drup Chungma, to the Red House before leaving for India. Both were already practicing and accomplishing sadhanas. Machig Labdron cured Drupse from an illness before he became the monk named Tonyon Samdrup, and the main lineage holder of Chod. During Machig Labdr√∂n's lifetime, Buddhist teachings which came from India to Tibet were considered authentic, and it was believed there were no teachings that originated in Tibet for Indian buddhist practitioners. As one of Machig Labdron's biographies states: As a result, there was so much controversy over Machig Labdr√∂n's teachings, by the time she was 52 years old, that a delegation of acaryas was sent from Bodh Gaya, India to Tibet to assess Machig Labdron's qualifications and teachings, similar to an Inquisition. Her normal crowd of 5,000 students and followers swelled to 500,573 people gathered at Zangri Khangmar, Machig Labdron's seat in Tibet from the age of 37 until her death at the age of 99.Zangri Kangmar: Machig's Main seat (photo) As she taught and debated with the acaryas questioning her and her lineage's authenticity, the words were translated into Tibetan, Hindi, and Nepali. In addition, a delegation was sent to South India to find the body of her previous incarnation as M√∂nlam Drub, and to witness the making of ≈õarƒ´ra relics as Machig Labdron instructed. Her predictions actualized, thus adding further validity to her status as a master and lineage holder. As a result of these and other events, it was determined that Machig Labdron's Chod teachings were indeed authentic, and established that her Ch√∂d teachings were the first Buddhist teachings to emerge in Tibet. One source says, \\"Word of the widespread practice of MahƒÅmudra Ch√∂ in Tibet and Nepal was first viewed in India with great scepticism. A delegation of ƒÅcƒÅryas was sent from Bodh GayƒÅ to Tibet to test Machig Labr√∂n and her teaching resulted in the acceptance of MahƒÅmudrƒÅ Ch√∂ as a valid and authentic MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition. Thereafter, its practice spread even to India.\\" Students Along with her daughter(s) and son(s), prominent among Machig Labdron's students were four main female students which were called Machig Labdr√∂n's Gyen or \\"Ornaments\\", and called the \\"Four Daughters\\". Their names are Gyaltsen Ne, Sonam Gyaltsen, Palden Gyen, and Bumso Rinchen Gyen. They propagated a distinct Gyen lineage of Chod, developed from the oral lineage of Chod and the tantric lineage of vajrayana Chod. Many of Machig Labdr√∂n's teachings were given in direct response to the questions of her students. In addition to her son Tonyon Samdrup, another student named Gyelwa Drubche, or Gyelwa Dondrub, was her heart student and another main lineage holder. Sources state it's unlikely he was her biological son named Drubpa, and state Drubpa married into local royalty and did not practice buddhism. Kugom Choyki Sengge was also a student and lineage holder that propagated the Chod teachings. Parinirvana=Emanations Machig Labdr√∂n stated she accomplished the state of a non-returner, and would emanate instead of reincarnate. She has emanated in Tibet, Bhutan and in the West. * Jomo Menmo In Tibet, it is said that Machig Labdr√∂n emanated as Jomo Menmo (1248‚Äì1283). According to the information given by the website of the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje, Jomo Menmo was born as a \\"karmic emanation\\" of Yeshe Tsogyal. Ch√∂kyi Dr√∂nma * Chokyi Dorje The first Samding Dorje Phagmo, Ch√∂kyi Dr√∂nma (1422‚Äì1455), a female tulku lineage of VajravƒÅrƒÅhƒ´, was understood to be an emanation of Machig Labdr√∂n. * Shukseb Jetsun Choying Zangmo In more recent history, in Tibet, the great yogini Shukseb Jetsun Choying Zangmo (1852‚Äì1953)SHUKSEP LOCHEN CH√ñNYI ZANGMO 1835-1953‚Äîalso called Ani Lochen, Lochen Ch√∂nyi Zangmo, and Shukseb Jetsun Rinpoche‚Äîwas a recognized emanation of Machig Labdron. Shuksheb Jetsun reinvigorated the Shuksep gompa () of the Kagy√º thirty miles from Lhasa on the slopes of Mount Gangri Th√∂kar. * Khandro Sonam Peldron In the 12th century, Khandro Sonam Peldron of Wang Dharlung, Bhutan is said to be a main emanation of Machik Labdron. Khandro Sonam was the wife of Phajo Drugom Zhipo of Tibet, who were crucial in the establishment of the Drukpa Lineage of Kagy√º in Bhutan. Phajo Drugom Zhigpo was sent to Bhutan by Tsangpa Gyarey Yeshey Dorji of Druk Ralung, Tibet, to establish the Drukpa Lineage in Bhutan. Phajo and Khandro had four sons and a daughter together. The bridge where Phajo and Khandro met in Thimphu still exists today, known as Lungtenzampa. Khandro Sonam Peldron is known to have achieved the supreme enlightenment called Zha lue Phochen and is known to have flown to the heavenly Dali I abode from near Tango monastery in Thimphu. * Lama Tsultrim Allione Lama Tsultrim Allione (1947- ), an American Buddhist teacher, was recognized in 2007 as an emanation of Machig Labdr√∂n at Zangri Khangmar, Tibet, the place where Machig Labdr√∂n lived from ages 37 to 99, a from where she passed into the state of non- returner. She was recognized by the resident Rinpoche, Karma Nyit√∂n Kunkhyab Ch√∂kyi Dorje, himself a reincarnation of the brother of the 8th Karmapa. Karma Nyit√∂n Kunkhyab Ch√∂kyi Dorje asked Lama Tsultrim to sit on the throne, and offered Lama Tsultrim a self-arisen golden crystal kƒ´la or ceremonial dagger, the only remaining tsa tsa (icon) made from the ashes of Machig's body (a mixture of clay and ash imprinted with an image of Machig dancing), texts of Machig's teachings, a hat with symbolic meaning designed by Machig, and various other treasures. Afterwards, Lama Tsultrim Allione was also recognized in Nepal as an emanation of Machig Labdr√∂n by Lama Tshering Wangdu Rinpoche, holder of the lineage of Dampa Sangye.Tara Mandala, Lama Tsultrim Allione Recognition Story, https://www.taramandala.org/introduction/lama-tsultrim- allione/recognition-story/ Machig Labdr√∂n's Ch√∂d Machig Labdr√∂n's Ch√∂d, also known as Mahamudra Ch√∂d, has been widespread in Tibet since Machig's lifetime. It is also called \\"The Beggars' Offering\\" or \\"The Cutting-Off- Ritual.\\" Ch√∂d is a visionary Buddhist practice of cutting attachment to one's corporeal form (in terms of the dualistic proclivity to relate to one's corporeal form as a reference-point that proves one's existence). This means that a practitioner offers the mandala of their own body in a ganachakra rite. The practitioner works entirely with their own mind, visualizing the offering, and‚Äîby practicing in lonely and dreaded places, like cemeteries‚Äîworks to overcome all fear. This is also why Ch√∂d was often used to overcome sickness in order to heal oneself and others. In some lineages of the Ch√∂d practice, chodpas and chodmas (practitioners of Ch√∂d) use a ritual bell, a specialized drum called a Ch√∂d damaru, and a human thigh-bone trumpet (often obtained from the charnel ground of sky burials). Machig Labdron's Texts The 10 texts on the profound Dharma of Chod: * Great Collection of Precepts on Chod * The Further Collection * The Quintessential Collection * The Appendices * The Steps of the Crucial Points * Refutation of Detractors * The Secret Symbol Dharma * The Three Cycles of Recitation * Taking the Ground as the Path * The Special Esoteric Instructions \\"Demons\\" in Machig Labdron's Ch√∂d One of the distinct features of Machig Labdr√∂n's Ch√∂d is the focus on what are sometimes called either demons ('dre) or devils (bdud). It is clear from Machig Labdr√∂n's writings and teachings that the entities being dealt with in Ch√∂d practices are formulations of the human mind, rather than supernatural beings. One of Machig Labdr√∂n's unique contributions to Ch√∂d is her understanding of demons. As Machig Labdr√∂n explained in answer to the questions of one of her students, Gangpa Muksang, In another teaching, Machig Labdr√∂n said: According to Anila Rinchen at Kagyu Ling in Burgundy, France, the Tibetan term for \\"demon\\" could be translated as \\"neurosis\\". Pilgrimage sites associated with Machig Labdron and Ch√∂d There are many pilgrimage sites in Tibet associated with Machig Labdr√∂n. Among these are the Tselha Namsum meditation caves near Gyamda in Tibet.

In 1962, for the American market, Crown International Pictures released a heavily re-edited adaptation of Varan the Unbelievable, starring Myron Healey, as a double feature with the re-edited, shortened, and retitled version of the East German/Polish science fiction film First Spaceship on Venus. In the plot of the Americanized version of the film, United States Navy Commander Jim Bradley (Myron Healy) is sent to Japan to test a new chemical that will desalinate water. However, the indigenous population are against the experiments in their salt lake. They fear that the chemical will re-awaken their ancient god, Obaki, who they say lives in the lake. Despite their objections, the villagers are evacuated and the experiment goes on as scheduled. As they feared, the chemical reawakens their god, a giant prehistoric monster. The creature destroys the local village and then heads to the city of Oneida. Plot A rare species of butterfly, native only to Japan's Kitakami River area, is discovered by two Japanese students while vacationing. In response, an expedition is dispatched to the Northwest Region (The Japanese Tibet) to study the butterflies in their native habitat. While driving to the location, two researchers come across a village. They ask the lake's location but receive no answer. The two eventually come upon the lake and find the butterflies, but are mysteriously crushed by something that police describe as \\"powerful\\".

Further inland, the expedition stumbles upon a village offering a ritualistic prayer to their mountain god. The local priest warns the travelers that their presence will make the god-monster angry. The warning falls of deaf ears. Kenji and Horiguchi later return to the village to rally the locals, telling them their beliefs are little more than superstition. Without their priest, the villagers agree, just as their god-monster Varan rises from the lake. The terrified villagers flee back to their homes, as the god-monster kills the priest at the village entrance, then proceeds to tear apart its huts. Following the destruction, Varan retreats to his underwater lair. Reports of the monster's existence reaches Tokyo, and the National Defense Force is mobilized. The villagers are evacuated, as tanks and ground artillery units move into position. Shortly thereafter, the military begins releasing toxins into the lake to drive out the monster. The plan is successful, and Varan emerges from the water, as tanks and artillery began to unleash their destructive fury. The conventional weapons have no effect on the monster and the military is forced to retreat. During the confusion, Yuriko gets trapped under a falling tree, placing her in Varan's path. Kenji narrowly manages to save his colleague and the two seek safety in a nearby cave. Varan pursues the two, reaching into the cavern with its large claws. The military intervenes, firing flares over the monster's head. Varan, attracted by their light, climbs a nearby mountain for a closer look. Once at its peak, the monster reveals hidden membranes of skin under its arms and leaps from the mountain top and glides towards the sea. Varan's reign of terror continues, as he capsizes a fishing boat not far from Tokyo. The National Defense Force remobilizes, sending a squadron of jets to intercept. The monster manages to destroy one of them that flies too close. Varan submerges and continues underwater towards Tokyo. The military counterattacks by deploying naval destroyers in surrounding waters, but the ship's artillery has no effect against the monster. Another attack is launched to stop Varan, this time using mine sweepers to seal off Tokyo Bay, which ultimately fails. Out of options, the National Defense Force again mobilizes its forces around Tokyo bay. It lines the water with landing-ships carrying rocket artillery vehicles, while dispatching a battalion of tanks to nearby Haneda Airport. A large amount of Special Gun Powder, which is hoped will destroy the monster, is also readied. Tokyo is evacuated while the military awaits Varan's appearance. The monster emerges from the water and is immediately shelled by the surrounding forces, but the assault does not stop Varan. Kenji drives a truck filled with Special Gun Powder to the runway of Haneda airport. The monster advances on the vehicle and Kenji escapes to a safe distance. With Varan now directly over the loaded truck, its detonation trigger is activated, causing the monster to be knocked flat. The military celebrates, prematurely, as Varan rises seemingly unfazed and begins another assault. Flares are once again used to attract the monster, but this time the National Defense Force witnesses Varan consuming one of the flares. Using dropped bombs filled with the Special Gun Powder, the monster swallows two of them. Shortly thereafter, the first one detonates, causing Varan to retreat back to the sea. The second ingested bomb detonates while the monster is underwater. A short while later the National Defense Force declares Varan finally destroyed.

When American financing did not happen, the film resumed being shot in TohoScope. It was the only film shot in \\"Toho Pan Scan\\", a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. During filming, monster suit actor Haruo Nakajima was injured by an explosives mishap and had to be replaced for the remainder of the shoot.Lees, J.D. and Cerasini, Marc. (1998). The Official Godzilla Compendium Random House, p. 28. Release Daikaij≈´ Baran was distributed theatrically in Japan by Toho on October 14, 1958 An English-dubbed version was also produced by Toho, but does not appear to have been released in North America. The American theatrical release on December 12, 1962, under the title Varan the Unbelievable, has a 70-minute running time. The film's storyline is substantially changed, omitting much of the original dramatic footage, retaining the special effects, and adding new footage. It bears little resemblance to the Toho original. Varan the Unbelievable was directed by Jerry A Baerwitz, written by Sid Harris, and stars an American cast, including Myron Healey, Tsuruko Kobayashi, Clifford Kawada, and Derick Shimazu. The original Japanese version of the film Daikaij≈´ Baran was released in 2005 to the United States home video market by Tokyo Shock. Reception In a contemporary review, Variety referred to the film as an \\"uninspired monster meller for saturation supporting niches\\" after Godzilla, Gorgo, and Dinosaurus! The review was of the American version of the film, where they stated that \\"Neither Harris' scenario nor Baewritz's direction of it can sustain interest\\".

It was known as a Philippine pay television network mainly offering multi-genre programming from the United States from 2005 until 2020. History The network was formed as part a split of the former Solar USA into two differing networks. Scripted and reality programming moved to Jack TV, with the rest of the network's programming moving to C/S (now Solar TV). Jack TV eventually took back some of C/S's programming as it adjusted its schedule. On October 20, 2012, Solar Entertainment launched its secondary channel Jack CITY on BEAM TV, replacing CHASE. The channel was later re-branded as CT, which later left the air in 2017. On April 10, 2017, Jack TV was dropped by Sky Cable & Destiny Cable, along with Basketball TV, CT, Solar Sports & NBA Premium TV (now defunct) allegedly due to Sky Cable's unpaid carriage fees. It was restored to those systems on April 1, 2019. Closure on pay TV and the transition to digital media Solar Entertainment announced in late March 2020 that Jack TV would be discontinued due to lack of advertising and redundant programming. Much of its former programming moved to ETC and Solar Sports. The Jack TV website then was maintained as a limited web portal with automated entertainment news to maintain existing trademarks.

The commercial featured a grizzly bear wandering through a forest, accompanied by narration suggesting that the bear could be dangerous and that it would be wise to be prepared for that possibility. In the final scene, a man appears and the bear takes a step back. The ad ends with a picture of Reagan and the tagline: \\"President Reagan: Prepared for Peace.\\" Without directly mentioning opponent Walter Mondale, defense spending, or the Soviet Union (traditionally symbolized by a bear), the ad suggested that Reagan was better prepared to recognize and deal with threats to global stability. Before the ad, the public seemed more comfortable with Walter Mondale's description of how he would negotiate with the Soviet Union than they did with Reagan's peace through strength platform. Research by award-winning pollster Richard Wirthlin detected the nation's overriding concern about the Soviet Union and how to communicate the solution through subtlety. Details and full text of the narration \\"There is a bear in the woods. For some people, the bear is easy to see. Others don't see it at all. Some people say the bear is tame. Others say it's vicious and dangerous. Since no one can really be sure who's right, isn't it smart to be as strong as the bear? If there is a bear.\\" The ad was written and narrated by ad man Hal Riney, who also wrote and narrated Reagan's resonant \\"Morning in America\\" ad (titled \\"Prouder, Stronger, Better\\") as well as his \\"America's Back\\" ad. To many, his rich, avuncular voice represented wholesomeness and authenticity. Reagan outlawing Russia Reception Initial focus group screenings of the advertisement demonstrated that the audience found its message ambiguous, with some interpreting it as an indictment of environmentalism, others as a criticism of gun control, but the underlying metaphor of \\"peace through strength\\" remained strong. Medvic, Stephen K. (2001). Political Consultants in U.S. Congressional Elections. Ohio: Ohio State University Press. 48-49. The advertisement itself had a very high recall rate amongst viewers, even those who were uncertain of its meaning.Just, Marion R. (1991). Should Campaign Commercials Be Regulated? No. In Rose, Gary L. (ed) Controversial Issues in Presidential Selection. New York: State University of New York Press. 145. The ad won praise from the political and advertising world. Republican strategist Dan Schnur said of Riney's work: \\"Most political advertising hits viewers over the head, while his work makes just as strong a point but in a less confrontational and a more soothing manner.\\"\\"Creating Reagan's image\\" - the story of how Hal Riney developed the ad campaign. \\"There is a bear in the woods\\" continues to be a popular phrase to invoke when a potential problem looms on the horizon, especially in political circles. The ad was copied in the 2004 presidential campaign of Republican George W. Bush in an ad called \\"Wolves,\\" which sought to draw parallels between terrorists and timber wolves. However, that ad explicitly mentioned terrorism, opponent John Kerry, liberalism, intelligence spending, and \\"America's defenses.\\" In September 2015, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz created an ad titled \\"Scorpion\\" with an opening line, \\"There's a Scorpion in the desert\\". In the ad Cruz used the image of a scorpion to show the threat Islamic terrorism posed to the United States. This ad was instantly recognized as a copy or an homage to Reagan's.http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ted- cruz-scorpion-ad-copies-reagans-famous-bear- commercial/https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/15/ted-cruz- ad-uses-scorpion-to-depict-threat-of-islamic-terror/ Currently, the Washington Post's PowerPost email newsletter to subscribers, The Daily 202, often uses the phrase, \\"There still a bear in the woods,\\" to introduce political topics. https://s2.washingtonpost.com/camp- rw/?e=YWxsaXNvbi5hbm5lLmhhcnRAZ21haWwuY29t&s;=5d4ae677fe1ff6190298506f&linknum;=0&linktot;=108 Wirthlin's work on the first Reagan campaign, and particularly this ad, earned him the title \\"Adman of the Year\\" by Advertising Age and the Washington Post called Wirthlin the \\"Prince of Pollsters\\".

The pairing has been called \\"one of the greatest examples of the action-adventure and fantasy romance of soaps during [the early 1980s].\\" For most of the last two decades of the show, Tom was played by Scott Holmes and Margo was played by Ellen Dolan. On internet message boards, the couple is often referred by the portmanteau \\"Tomargo\\" (for Tom and Margo). Storyline Tom and Margo first became involved during the couple's investigation of Mr. Big, who eventually held them captive in his mansion for several weeks. At the time, Tom was involved with Margo's aunt Maggie, but he eventually broke up with her to be with Margo. Tom and Margo got married in 1983, and unlike many other couples on soap operas, their marriage has survived for over 25 years despite adultery on both sides. While married, Margo had an affair with Hal Munson, resulting in her getting pregnant with a son she named Adam, who was, for a time, presumed to be Tom's biological son. Years later, Tom had an affair with Emily Stewart which left Emily pregnant with Tom's child, Daniel. Tom and Margo have one son together, Casey. Tom also discovered that he had fathered a child while in Vietnam, whom he had never known about. His daughter, Lien, tracked Tom down as an adult and eventually built a relationship with him. Lien, like her father, is an attorney. The 1990s were full of trauma for Tom and Margo as Margo faced murder charges for the assisted suicide of her stepfather, Casey Peretti. Margo was later raped, and after learning that her rapist was HIV positive, she spent months worrying about her own status before test results proved that she did not have the virus. In 2005, Tom and Margo discovered that their son Casey had had a baby with Gwen Norbeck who died a short while after he was born. Though initially furious at Casey for his immaturity and lack of judgment, they later forgave him. Tom Hughes Tom is the son of Dr. Bob Hughes and Bob's first wife Lisa Miller, and was born soon after the two eloped as teenagers. He had a difficult childhood, as his parents split up soon after he was born and often fought bitterly. He was SORASed during the late 1960s and was sent to Vietnam, returning a few months later with a self- inflicted injury and a drug habit. He had a number of brushes with the law, including stealing drugs, and later a murder conviction. (He had confessed to the murder of his stepfather, Dr. Michael Shea, to cover for his mother, Lisa, who he mistakenly assumed had committed the murder). After being cleared of the charges when the real murderer was discovered, Tom went to law school, and became an attorney. He was married twice (Carol Hughes and Natalie Bannon), before eventually marrying Margo Montgomery in 1983. The two split up in 1999 over Tom's affair with Emily Stewart, and Margo's subsequent fling with Alec Wallace, but reconciled in early 2000. Actors Tom has been played by 13 different actors since the character's birth in 1961. *James Madden (1963) *Jerry Schaffer (1963) *Frankie Michaels (1964-1966) *Richard Thomas (1966-1967) *Paul O'Keefe (1967-1968) *Peter Link (1969) *Peter Galman (1969-1974) *C.

Margo had three siblings: Cricket Montgomery, Craig Montgomery, and Katie Peretti. She initially became a nurse, as her mother had been, but later switched professions to become a police officer. When Margo's son, Adam, was born in 1988, it was assumed that he was Tom's son, but it later came out that he was the result of a fling between Margo and Detective Hal Munson. Tom and Margo later had another son, Casey. In 1999, devastated over Tom's affair with Emily, Margo began a friendship with Alec Wallace, a criminal she was investigating, which eventually led to a romance. When Wallace was found murdered and Margo was in his bed, unaware of how she got there (she could not remember the previous night's activities), she was charged with his murder, but was later cleared, when the real murderer was discovered. She and Tom then reconciled, and remained more or less happily married through ATWT's final episode in 2010.

It identifies its purpose as providing national advocacy for self-regulation of academic quality through accreditation in order to certify the quality of higher education accrediting organizations, including regional, faith-based, private, career, and programmatic accrediting organizations. The organization has approximately 3,000 academic institutions as members, and currently recognizes approximately 60 accrediting organizations.CHEA website. Retrieved January 31, 2010. CHEA is based in Washington, DC. CHEA is a member of International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies (INQAAHE).International Affairs Office, U.S. Department of Education 12/2007 page 2 \\"INTERNATIONAL ACCREDITATION\\" https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/accred- postsec.docINQAAHE Website http://www.inqaahe.org/council-higher-education- accreditation History Established in 1996, CHEA is the successor to several earlier national nongovernmental associations formed to coordinate the U.S. accreditation process for higher education. In 1974, the Federation of Regional Accrediting Commissions of Higher Education (FRACHE; an association of regional accreditors) and the National Commission on Accrediting (an association of specialized and national accreditation agencies) had merged to form the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation (COPA), which had the purpose of ensuring the quality of accreditation. In 1993, COPA was dissolved because of tensions among the different types of accreditation agencies that formed its membership‚Äîultimately the result of the increasing problems for higher education in the 1980s and 1990s. Problems with tuition increases, scandals, and doubts about the value of postsecondary higher education plagued all parts of the higher education sector. In particular, Congressional investigations of soaring student loan defaults and student aid abuses were highly critical of the laxity of accreditation and accreditation processes.Bloland, Harland G. (2001). Creating the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. page 182. Consequently, the 1992 amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 included Program Integrity provisions designed to strengthen the gatekeeping triad for student loan guarantees and financial aid (i.e., state licensing bodies, accreditation associations, and Federal government). The higher education community viewed with alarm the establishment of State Postsecondary Review Entities (SPREs), which were given accrediting powers under special conditions. \\"When campus lobbyists heard about the legislation and realized that non-governmental accreditation was being replaced by a federal-state agency evaluation of institutions, including assessments of academic quality never before carried out by government, they 'went apoplectic', as one observer put it.\\"Constance Ewing Cook, Lobbying for Higher Education: How Colleges and Universities Influence Federal Policy (1998), The Story of the State Postsecondary Review Entities, pages 44-51. The quotation here is from page 47. Early in 1993, the regional accreditors voted to leave COPA, indicating their dissatisfaction with COPA's political representation in the U.S. Congress, which representation was widely viewed as ineffective, particularly in regard to the new legislation establishing the SPREs. In April 1993, COPA voted to disband itself by the end of the year.Bloland, Harland G. (2001), Creating the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, Chapter 3, and page 39. Work by the National Policy Board on Higher Education Institutional Accreditation (NPB), and other groups laid the groundwork for a national successor to COPA. Among their concerns were establishing a more grassroots membership, billing and fees, and advisory role of the accrediting associations, and improving the public image of accrediting and improving the ability to lobby the Federal government.Harland G. Bloland, Creating the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (2001)Jane Wellman: Recognition of Accreditation Organizations: A Comparison of Policy & Practice of Voluntary Accreditation and The United States Department of Education CHEA January 1998 CHEA's immediate predecessor was the Council for Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation (CORPA), which was formed following the dissolution of COPA. CHEA grandfathered in those accrediting associations recognized by COPA, provided that more than half the institutions that they accredited granted degrees.Bloland, Harland G. (2001), Creating the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, page 183. Information resources Each accreditor recognized by CHEA is independent, which means that accreditation requirements vary from group to group. CHEA maintains a website that contains a searchable database to check the accreditation status of recognized accreditation agencies, accredited schools, or schools currently in the process of getting accreditation (i.e., \\"candidates\\" for accreditation). (You must accept the license agreement to see the source text.) CHEA's \\"user agreement for publications of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation\\" states that it does not guarantee that all accredited schools are listed in the database. In 2012 CHEA launched the Chea International Quality Group (CIQG) to advance understanding of international quality assurance and to promote high-quality higher education through international accreditation bodies worldwide. The Chea International Quality Group (CIQG) provides a database of recognized accreditation agencies globally. It is a non-profit, non-governmental association focused on U.S. and non-U.S. accreditation and higher education quality assurance worldwide. Board of directors CHEA is led by a board of directors that consists of 20 members, including presidents of colleges and universities, other institutional representatives, and members of the public.

Relationship to government CHEA recognition of accreditors differs from the recognition by the U.S. Secretary of Education, required for Title IV (HEA) student financial aid eligibility and loan guarantees. For the purpose of state government oversight of higher education, the state of Oregon authorizes accreditation organizations recognized by both the U.S. Department of Education and CHEA to operate in the state. However, organizations that are recognized by CHEA and not also by the Department of Education may operate only with oversight from the Oregon Student Assistance Commission.

In 1928 the league was restructured with Ely placed in Division One A. They finished bottom of the division in 1928‚Äì29 and were relegated to Division One B. Further league restructuring in 1931 saw Ely promoted to the new Premier Division. They were relegated after finishing second-from-bottom in 1936‚Äì37, returning to the Premier Division in 1946. The club won both Cambridgeshire Senior Cups in 1948 and were Premier Division runners-up in 1949‚Äì50. In 1951 they left the Cambridgeshire League to join the Premier Division of the Peterborough & District League.Peterborough & District League 1949‚Äì1959 Non- League Matters They were league champions in 1955‚Äì56, and in 1956‚Äì57 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup after winning five qualifying rounds. Drawn at home to Torquay United, they lost 6‚Äì2 in front of a crowd of 4,223. The season also saw them finish as runners-up in the league, a feat they repeated the following season. In 1958 Ely joined Division One South of the Central Alliance, where they played for two years before being elected to the Eastern Counties League. In 1967 former Northern Irish international Hugh Barr was appointed player-manager, leading the club to runners-up position in the league in 1968‚Äì69. They won the Cambridgeshire Invitation Cup in 1969‚Äì70 and the Eastern Counties League Cup in 1979‚Äì80, beating Lowestoft Town 4‚Äì2 on aggregate.

Though rare, it is the most common thallium-bearing mineral. Lorandite occurs in low-temperature hydrothermal associations and in gold and mercury ore deposits. Associated minerals include stibnite, realgar, orpiment, cinnabar, vrbaite, greigite, marcasite, pyrite, tetrahedrite, antimonian sphalerite, arsenic and barite. The mineral is being used for detection of solar neutrino via a certain nuclear reaction involving thallium. It has a monoclinic crystal structure consisting of spiral chains of AsS3 tetrahedra interconnected by thallium atoms, and can be synthesized in the laboratory. History Lor√°ndite was first discovered at the Allchar deposit, near Kavadarci, Macedonia in 1894 and named after Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s, a prominent Hungarian physicist. Distribution Apart from the Allchar deposit in Macedonia, lorandite is also found at the Dzhizhikrut Sb‚ÄìHg deposit in Tajikistan and at the Beshtau uranium deposit, near Pyatigorsk, northern Caucasus Mountains, Russia. As an ore mineral, it is encountered at the Lanmuchang Hg‚ÄìTl deposit, Guizhou Province, China; at the Zarshuran gold deposit in northeastern Iran; and at the Lengenbach Quarry in Switzerland. In the US, it is present at the New Rambler Cu‚ÄìNi mine in Wyoming; at the Jerritt Canyon mines, Independence Mountains district and Carlin Gold mine in Nevada; and at the Mercur gold deposit in Utah. Laboratory synthesis Single crystals of lorandite can be grown from a mixture of thallium nitrate (TlNO3), elemental arsenic and sulfur in concentrated aqueous solution of ammonia. The mixture is placed in an autoclave and is kept at elevated temperature (~250 ¬∞C) for several days. This procedure yields deep-red prismatic crystals elongated along the [001] crystal axis, which are similar to the mineral in appearance and crystallographic structure details. Crystal structure Crystal structure of lorandite. Violet atoms are arsenic, yellow are sulfur and brown are thallium. The crystal structure of lorandite is monoclinic, space group P21/a, Z = 4, with the lattice constants a = 1.228 nm, b = 1.130 nm, c = 0.6101 nm and Œ≤ = 104.5 ¬∞. It consists of spiral chains of AsS3 tetrahedra oriented to the [010] crystal axis. The chains are covalently interlinked by irregularly coordinated Tl atoms (chain interconnections not shown in the picture), and breaking of these links is responsible for crystal cleavage. Geological occurrence The tectonic setting of Allchar deposit, Macedonia where lorandite was originally discovered, is an anticline structure originating from sediments of the upper Cretaceous Period. During the mineralization processes, the presence of andesite rocks caused movements of hydrothermal solutions along the dolomite and andesite contacts enabling the formation of lorandite deposits. Applications In 1976, it was proposed to use a thallium-rich mineral, lor√°ndite, for detection of solar neutrino. The method relies on the 205Tl(ŒΩe,e‚àí)205Pb reaction which has a relatively low threshold energy of 52 keV and thus relatively high efficiency. This reaction yields 205Pb isotope which has a long lifetime of 15.4 million years; it is induced not only by neutrinos, but also by other cosmic particles. They all have different penetration depth in the Earth crust, and thus analysis of the 205Pb content in a thallium-containing ore taken from different depths brings information on the neutrinos of the past millennia. Thus, the LORandite EXperiment (LOREX), is running between 2008 and 2010 and is based in one of the largest source of lorandite, the Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia.

He was the country's first head of government following the declaration of self-rule in 1961. From 1952 until 1977, he was leader of the United Party. He was also a member of the House of Representatives from 1960 to 1972, and de facto Leader of the Opposition for a period, opposite Dawda Jawara.  Early life and government employment  N'Jie was born in the Gambia in 1909 to a Wolof Muslim family. His father was a trader who was the nephew of one of the last kings of Saloum, Semu Joof. Thus, through his father, he had Serer blood from the Joof family of Saloum. N'Jie attended Saint Augustine's School in Bathurst and taught there before entering government employment in January 1929. He entered the Judicial Department as an assistant clerk of the courts in 1931, remaining there until July 1943 when he retired on a pension on medical grounds. In February 1943, he had been arrested and prosecuted on the charge of forging the signature of a plaintiff in a civil case. After the short trial, N'Jie was acquitted by the local magistrates due to a lack of evidence but was not given his old job back. The government later refused to pay him any health or reputational compensation, which he greatly resented.  Studies in England and legal career  Having failed to secure alternative employment in the Gambia, he left for the United Kingdom to study medicine at King's College London. However, he said \\"I only stayed there a short time. I was to be a doctor, but I don't like blood.\\" In September 1943, he began legal training at Lincoln's Inn, one of the Inns of Court. In 1948, he became the first Wolof to be called to the bar. He returned to the Gambia in 1949 to set up his own firm in Bathurst. His main success was in conveyancing land between Africans and Lebanese. In September 1958, the deputy judge of the Supreme Court of the Gambia, Myles John Abbott, disbarred N'Jie from the legal profession for one of these deals. This decision was set aside by the West African Court of Appeal in June 1959, on the grounds that a deputy judge had no jurisdiction in the matter. In May 1961, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled that the deputy judge's initial decision should be upheld in a case known as The Attorney-General of the Gambia vs Pierre Sarr N'Jie.  Political career  N'Jie first stood for election in the Legislative Council in 1951 but was not elected. He stood again in 1954, supported by his recently-established United Party. He had greater financial resources at his disposal than his opponent and had the advantage of not being associated with the unpopular incumbent Governor of the Gambia, Percy Wyn-Harris. He also enjoyed support from female voters who were organised by his sister, Yadicone N'Jie. N'Jie won the election and was also appointed to the Executive Council as Minister for Education and Social Welfare. However, in October 1955, following a clash between United Party supporters and Gambia Muslim Congress supporters in Bathurst, N'Jie accused the Chief Superintendent of Police of not taking enough action to prevent the violence and suppressing possible prosecutions. A subsequent commission of inquiry failed to support his accusation and strongly criticised his conduct. Wyn-Harris instructed N'Jie to resign from the Executive Council, and when he refused, he was dismissed in January 1956. In the first election to the House of Representatives in 1960, N'Jie was elected as the member for New Town East. However, it was the People's Progressive Party (PPP) that won the largest number of seats. Governor Edward Windley offered N'Jie a Minister without Portfolio position on the Executive Council, which he immediately rejected, putting the United Party into opposition. Therefore, it was a surprise when Windley appointed N'jie as the first Chief Minister of the Gambia in March 1961. He believed that the United Party was actually gaining popular support over the PPP, and also that he would have influence over M. E. Jallow, the leader of the Gambia Workers' Union. During his term as Chief Minister, N'Jie was involved in early negotiations with the Senegalese government over the Gambia's long-term future. He remained as Chief Minister until the 1962 election, when the PPP won a clear victory, although N'Jie retained his New Town East seat. N'Jie became the Leader of the Opposition, while Dawda Jawara became the first Prime Minister of the Gambia. The United Party challenged the election results in the courts, alleging that the register of voters had been invalid. The claim was upheld by the West African Court of Appeal in April 1963, but N'Jie dedicated much of his time until Gambian independence trying to persuade the British government to call a new election. In his absence, the United Party went into decline, with a number of its members joining the PPP. Returning to work in the Gambia in January 1965, N'Jie successfully organised the 'no' vote in the 1965 republic referendum but failed to repeat this success in the 1966 election. Although he won his own seat of Bathurst North, he did not prevent a PPP victory. N'Jie's popularity waned into the late 1960s, and shortly after the 1970 republic referendum, a result he refused to success, on 8 May he was dismissed as the leader by his party's executive committee. He was replaced by his brother, E. D. N'Jie, but after his death on 19 October, the United Party was obliged to reinstate N'Jie. He failed to provide inspiring leadership, and despite winning his own seat again in 1972, only two other United Party members were elected besides him. He was expelled from the House of Representatives in 1972 for nonattendance of two consecutive meetings. Despite remaining party leader, he took little more part in political life, and by 1977 seldom ventured out of his home. He died at the age of 84 on 11 December 1993.  Personal life  N'Jie converted to Catholicism in 1939.

Also known as \\"Cutting Through the Ego,\\", the practices are based on the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ or \\"Perfection of Wisdom\\" sutras, which expound the \\"emptiness\\" concept of Buddhist philosophy. According to Mahayana Buddhists, emptiness is the ultimate wisdom of understanding that all things lack inherent existence. Ch√∂d combines praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ philosophy with specific meditation methods and tantric ritual. The chod practitioner seeks to tap the power of fear through activities such as rituals set in graveyards, and visualisation of offering their bodies in a tantric feast in order to put their understanding of emptiness to the ultimate test. Nomenclature, orthography and etymology and Sanskrit chedasƒÅdhanƒÅ both literally mean \\"cutting practice\\". In Standard Tibetan (the prestige dialect associated with Buddhism that is based on the speech of Lhasa), the pronunciation of gcod is IPA //. Key elements of the practice Ch√∂d practitioners at Boudhanath stupa Ch√∂d literally means \\"cutting through\\". It cuts through hindrances and obscurations, sometimes called 'demons' or 'gods'. Examples of demons are ignorance, anger and, in particular, the dualism of perceiving the self as inherently meaningful, contrary to the Buddhist doctrine of anatta (non-self). This is done in a powerful meditative ritual which includes \\"a stunning array of visualizations, song, music, and prayer, it engages every aspect of one‚Äôs being and effects a powerful transformation of the interior landscape.\\" According to Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl, Ch√∂d involves \\"accepting willingly what is undesirable, throwing oneself defiantly into unpleasant circumstances, realising that gods and demons are one‚Äôs own mind, and ruthlessly severing self-centered arrogance through an understanding of the sameness of self and others.\\"Powers, John, Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, Revised Edition, 2007, p. 426. According to Machig Labdr√∂n, the main goal of Ch√∂d is cutting through ego clinging: Dzogchen forms of Ch√∂d enable the practitioner to maintain rigpa, primordial awareness free from fear.

The Longchen Nyingthig Ch√∂d Practice: \\"The Loud Laugh of the Dakini\\". (accessed: September 28, 2008) Ch√∂d usually commences with phowa, in which the practitioner visualises their mindstream as the Five Pure Lights leaving the body through the aperture of the sahasrara at the top of the head. This is said to ensure psychic integrity of, and compassion for the sƒÅdhaka or practitioner. In most versions of the sƒÅdhanƒÅ, the mindstream precipitates into a tulpa simulacrum of Vajrayoginƒ´. In sa·πÉbhogakƒÅya attained through visualization, the sƒÅdhaka offers a ga·πáachakra of their own physical body to the \\"four\\" guests: the Three Jewels, dakinis, dharmapalas and beings of the bhavachakra, the ever-present lokapala and the pretas. The rite may be protracted with separate offerings to each ma·πá·∏çala of guests, or significantly abridged. Many versions of the chod sƒÅdhana still exist.Tantric Glossary:Ch√∂d (September 29, 2008) Vajrayogini, an important deity in Ch√∂d, with a kartari flaying knife and a kapala \\"skull cup\\" Ch√∂d, like all tantric systems, has outer, inner and secret aspects. They are described in an evocation sung to Nyama Paldabum by Milarepa: Ch√∂d is now a staple of the advanced sƒÅdhana of Tibetan Buddhism. It is practiced worldwide following dissemination by the Tibetan diaspora. Vajrayogini is a key figure in the advanced practice of Ch√∂d, where she appears in her KƒÅlikƒÅ () or VajravƒÅrƒÅhƒ´ () forms. The practices of Tr√∂ma Nagmo \\"Extremely Wrathful Black Mother\\" associated with the Dakini Tr√∂ma Nagmo (the black form of Vajrayogini) were also propagated by Machig Labdr√∂n. \\"The particular transmission which His Holiness will give descends from Dudjom Lingpa, who received it in a direct vision of the Indian Mahasiddha, Saraha. This practice emphasizes cutting through grasping at the dualistic mind to realize complete selfless compassion. One of the forms of this style of Ch√∂d can be found in the Dudjom Tersar lineage. Indian antecedents \\"Ch√∂d was never a unique, monolithic tradition. One should really speak of Ch√∂d traditions and lineages since Ch√∂d has never constituted a school.\\" A form of Ch√∂d was practiced in India by Buddhist mahƒÅsiddhas prior to the 10th century. The two practices of Ch√∂d in Buddhism and in B√∂n are distinct lineages. There are two main Ch√∂d traditions within Buddhism, the \\"Mother\\" and \\"Father\\" lineages. Dampa Sangye is known as the \\"Father of Ch√∂d\\" and Machig Labdr√∂n, founder of the Mahamudra Ch√∂d lineages, as the \\"Mother of Ch√∂d\\". B√∂n traces the origin of Ch√∂d to the Secret Mother Tantra, the seventh of the Nine Vehicles of B√∂n practice. There are four distinct styles of Ch√∂d practice. Ch√∂d developed outside the monastic system. It was subsequently adopted by the monastic lineages. As an internalization of an outer ritual, Ch√∂d involves a form of self-sacrifice: the practitioner visualizes their own body as the offering at a ganachakra. The purpose of the practice is to engender a sense of victory and fearlessness. These two qualities are represented iconographically by the victory banner and the ritual knife. The banner symbolizes overcoming obstacles and the knife symbolizes cutting through the ego. The practitioner may cultivate imaginary fearful or painful situations since they help the practitioner's work of cutting through attachment to the self. Machig Labdr√∂n said, \\"To consider adversity as a friend is the instruction of Ch√∂d\\". Ch√∂dpa as 'mad saints' Sarat Chandra Das, writing at the turn of the 20th Century, equated the Ch√∂d practitioner () with the Indian avadh≈´ta, or \\"mad saint\\".Sarat Chandra Das, Graham Sandberg & Augustus William Heyde (1902). Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms. Calcutta, India: Bengal Secretariat Book Depot, p.20. Source: (accessed: Tuesday February 9, 2010) Avadh≈´tas - called ny√∂npa in Tibetan Buddhism - are renowned for expressing their spiritual understanding through \\"crazy wisdom\\" inexplicable to ordinary people. Ch√∂d practitioners are a type of Mad Saint particularly respected, feared or held in awe due to their roles as denizens of the charnel ground. According to tibetologist J√©r√¥me √âdou, Chod practitioners were often associated with the role of shaman and exorcist: Iconography A damaru, a ritual drum A kangling, a trumphet made out of a human femur In Ch√∂d, the adept symbolically offers the flesh of their body in a form of ga·πáacakra or tantric feast. Iconographically, the skin of the practitioner's body may represent surface reality or maya. It is cut from bones that represent the true reality of the mindstream. Commentators have pointed out the similarities between the Ch√∂d ritual and the prototypical initiation of a shaman, although one writer identifies an essential difference between the two in that the shaman's initiation is involuntary whilst a Chodpa chooses to undertake the ritual death of a Chod ceremony. Traditionally, Ch√∂d is regarded as challenging, potentially dangerous and inappropriate for some practitioners.Eliade, Mircea (1989), \\"Histoire des croyances et des id√©es religieuses\\" Tome 3, ¬ß 316, Ed. Payot.  Ritual objects  Practitioners of the Ch√∂d ritual, Ch√∂dpa, use a kangling or human thighbone trumpet, and a Ch√∂d drum, a hand drum similar to but larger than the ·∏çamaru commonly used in Tibetan ritual. In a version of the Ch√∂d sƒÅdhanƒÅ of Jigme Lingpa from the Longchen Nyingthig, five ritual knives are employed to demarcate the ma·πá·∏çala of the offering and to affix the five wisdoms.Jigme Lingpa (revealed; undated); Liljenberg, Karen (translator; 2006)The Longchen Nyingthig Ch√∂d Practice \\"The Loud Laugh of the Dakini\\" Key to the iconography of Ch√∂d is the (), a half-moon blade knife for skinning an animal and for scraping hides. The practitioner symbolically uses a kartika to separate the bodymind from the mindstream in ritual. Kartika imagery in Ch√∂d rituals provides the practitioner with an opportunity to realize Buddhist doctrine: Origins of the practice Machig Labdr√∂n Dampa Sangye Some sources have described Machig Labdr√∂n as the founder of the practice of Ch√∂d.Beyer, Stephen (1973). The Cult of Tara. University of California Press. p.47 This is accurate in that she is the founder of the Tibetan Buddhist MahamudrƒÅ Ch√∂d lineages. Machig Labdr√∂n is credited with providing the name \\"Ch√∂d\\" and developing unique approaches to the practice.Thrangu, Khenchen & Klonk, Christoph (translator) & Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006). Chod ‚Äì The Introduction & A Few Practices. (accessed: November 2, 2007) Biographies suggest it was transmitted to her via sources of the mahƒÅsiddha and tantric traditions. She did not found the Dzogchen lineages, although they do recognize her, and she does not appear at all in the B√∂n Ch√∂d lineages. Among the formative influences on MahamudrƒÅ Ch√∂d was Dampa Sangye's Pacification of Suffering (). The transmission of Ch√∂d to Tibet There are several hagiographic accounts of how Ch√∂d came to Tibet. One namtar (spiritual biography) asserts that shortly after Kamala≈õƒ´la won his famous debate with Moheyan as to whether Tibet should adopt the \\"sudden\\" route to enlightenment or his \\"gradual\\" route, Kamala≈õƒ´la used the technique of phowa to transfer his mindstream to animate a corpse polluted with contagion in order to safely move the hazard it presented. As the mindstream of Kamala≈õƒ´la was otherwise engaged, a mahasiddha by the name of Dampa Sangye came across the vacant \\"physical basis\\"kuten of Kamala≈õƒ´la. Padampa Sangye, was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamala≈õƒ´la, which he assumed to be a newly dead fresh corpse, used phowa to transfer his own mindstream into Kamala≈õƒ´la's body. Padampa Sangye's mindstream in Kamala≈õƒ´la's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted the Pacification of Suffering teachings and the Indian form of Ch√∂d which contributed to the Mahamudra Ch√∂d of Machig Labdr√∂n. The mindstream of Kamala≈õƒ´la was unable to return to his own body and so was forced to enter the vacant body of Padampa Sangye. Third Karmapa: systematizer of Ch√∂d Ch√∂d was a marginal and peripheral practice, and the Ch√∂dpas who engaged in it were from outside traditional Tibetan Buddhist and Indian monastic institutions, with a contraindication against all but the most advanced practitioners to go to the charnel grounds to practice. Texts concerning Ch√∂d were both exclusive and rare in the early tradition school. Indeed, due to the itinerant and nomadic lifestyles of practitioners, they could carry few texts. Hence they were also known as kusulu or kusulupa, that is, studying texts rarely whilst focusing on meditation and praxis: \\"The nonconventional attitude of living on the fringe of society kept the Ch√∂dpas aloof from the wealthy monastic institutions and printing houses. As a result, the original Ch√∂d texts and commentaries, often copied by hand, never enjoyed any wide circulation, and many have been lost forever.\\" Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama, (1284‚Äì1339) was an important systematizer of Ch√∂d teachings and significantly assisted in their promulgation within the literary and practice lineages of the Kagyu, Nyingma, and particularly Dzogchen. It is in this transition from the charnel grounds to the monastic institutions of Tibetan Buddhism that the rite of Ch√∂d became an inner practice; the charnel ground became an internal imaginal environment. Schaeffer1995: p.15 conveys that the Third Karmapa was a systematizer of the Ch√∂d developed by Machig Labdr√∂n and lists a number of his works in Tibetan on Ch√∂d. Amongst others, the works include redactions, outlines and commentaries. Western reports on Ch√∂d practices Ch√∂d was mostly practised outside the Tibetan monastery system by ch√∂dpas, who were yogis, yogi·πáƒ´s and ngagpas rather than bhik·π£us and bhik·π£u·πáƒ´s. Because of this, material on Ch√∂d has been less widely available to Western readers than some other tantric Buddhist practices. The first Western reports of Ch√∂d came from a French adventurer who lived in Tibet, Alexandra David-N√©el in her travelogue Magic and Mystery in Tibet, published in 1932. Walter Evans-Wentz published the first translation of a Ch√∂d liturgy in his 1935 book Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines. Anila Rinchen Palmo translated several essays about Ch√∂d in the 1987 collection Cutting Through Ego-Clinging: Commentary on the practice of Tchod. Since then, Ch√∂d has emerged more into the mainstream of both western scholarly and academic writings.

He was a prince from the Pagaruyung Kingdom in the island of Sumatra, now situated within Indonesia. History The Minangkabau people were the first migrant community to settle in the northern part of the Johor Sultanate which eventually formed the Negri Sembilan in the 14th century. The population began to control local politics. By 1760, Johor, which was having trouble from the Dutch, allowed the state to appoint a raja, or sultan, from Minangkabau in Sumatra. Between 1760 and 1770, a council of leaders known as the datuk-datuk penghulu luak (the predecessor of the datuk-datuk undang today) left for Pagar Ruyung in Minangkabau in search of a leader. The Raja of Pagar Ruyong, who was believed to be a descendant of Alexander the Great, gave them a leader in the form of his son, Raja Mahmud. Raja Mahmud later became known as Raja Melewar in Negri Sembilan.History behind Negri's unique selection of ruler , The New Straits Times, 29 December 2008. Before Raja Melewar left for the Malay Peninsula, a royalty named Raja Khatib was sent to Negri Sembilan to oversee Raja Melewar's coronation preparations. However, upon his arrival to Negeri Sembilan, Raja Khatib lied to the locals and claimed to be the prince sent from Pagar Ruyung. The locals believed him, and Raja Khatib was deemed the new king. As for Raja Melewar, he first sailed to Johor to ask for the Sultan of Johor's consent to rule over Negri Sembilan. The sultan did not object and conferred upon Raja Melewar the authority to reign over Negri Sembilan. Raja Melewar's expedition marched to Negri Sembilan through Naning. At Naning, Raja Melewar's forces met Bugis warchief Daeng Kemboja. War ensued, but the Bugis forces were defeated. Upon his arrival to Negri Sembilan in 1773, Raja Melewar was deemed king and proclaimed as Yamtuan Besar in Kampung Penajis in Rembau. Raja Melewar learned of Raja Khatib's scheme and, becoming the undisputed ruler of the state, declared war against Raja Khatib. Raja Melewar later relocated his palace to Seri Menanti, which remains the royal town of Negri Sembilan today. Following Raja Melewar's death in 1795, rather than selecting his son as their new leader, the datuk-datuk penghulu luak once again journeyed to their ancestral land. The Raja of Pagar Ruyong gave another son, Raja Hitam, to serve as their new Yam Tuan. Raja Hitam married Raja Melewar's daughter, Tengku Aishah, but they did not have children.History behind Negri's unique selection of ruler , The New Straits Times, 29 December 2008. Selecting a ruler of Negri Sembilan by a council of ruling chiefs in the state, or the datuk-datuk undang, became an implemented system.

Testimonies of the disaster In a few hours, approximately at 10:00 am of November 9, the city disappeared under the sea, and more than 3,000 of its inhabitants drowned or were crushed by flying debris carried by winds in excess of 135 mph (215 km/h). Why a select number of survivors escaped the storm, and why the town was not evacuated prior to landfall, persist as questions. The hurricane was rumored to be destined for landfall far east of Santa Cruz, and when notification arrived about the town's peril, landfall was imminent. The last departing trains for evacuation failed to depart due to the storm surge. Fishermen of Santa Cruz were said to have predicted the event, apparently suspecting that \\"something wrong was brewing in the atmosphere.\\" Survivors provided horrifying testimonies in the wake of a storm that literally drowned people in their homes. Hurricane Paloma also made landfall there 76 years later on the same night in 2008 with 100 mph (160 km/h) winds. Demographics In 2004, the municipality of Santa Cruz del Sur had a population of 51,335. With a total area of , it has a population density of In 2007 the town of Santa Cruz del Sur had 16,600 residents.

They finished bottom of the division in 2004‚Äì05, but were not relegated as the league was understrength in terms of numbers. In 2011‚Äì12 the club won Division One on goal difference to earn promotion to the Premier Division, and also won the Division One Knock-out Cup, defeating Whitton United 1‚Äì0 in the final.

It controlled two banks, Advanta Bank Corp and Advanta National Bank. (It is not associated with Advanta Energy Corp., a California energy consultancy.) Growth Advanta began in 1951 as a provider of personal loans to schoolteachers. In 1971, when the current CEO, Dennis Alter, took over the company from his father, it had 30 employees. It served mostly teachers and was licensed only in Pennsylvania, Florida and Delaware. It only provided fixed-payment loans; it did not own any banks nor was it involved in the mortgage or financing business. In the early 1990s, when its assets were at an all-time high of $25 billion, the firm had the sixth-largest consumer credit card business in the United States, with seven million credit card holders. In 1999, the company sold this part of its business, including and related assets, focusing instead on the small business market. Advanta's earnings for 2003 were $28.2 million, and it was the third-largest credit card company for small businesses in the United States. In 2004, it employed 1,000 people, primarily in the Philadelphia region, but also in Salt Lake City. In early 2006, Advanta had $4.9 billion in managed assets, with annual income of just under $400 million. Its credit cards were primarily marketed to entrepreneurs, homegrown businesses and small-scale organizations with fewer than ten employees and less than $3 million in revenue. Difficulties In December 2008, developer Liberty Property Trust announced that it had stopped its plans to build a $55 million, headquarters for Advanta in Upper Dublin Township, Pennsylvania. In February 2009, Advanta said it had lost $43.8 million in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, primarily because of credit losses. The company said it would cut its dividends and expenses, and lay off 300 of its 900 employees. It also notified its credit card holders that their interest rates would be raised, from as low as 6 percent, to more than 30 percent, regardless of the holder's credit score. In mid-March 2009, the stock was selling at 24 cents per share, down from its mid-2007 high of almost $30 per share. On May 11, 2009, the company announced that it would close its credit cards to new charges as of June 10, 2009, and that the investment vehicles it employed to fund the credit card balances had gone into early amortization, effectively terminating the company's access to funds with which to accept new charges. It also announced an effort to buy back its senior investment notes at between 65 and 75 percent of face value. In late May 2009, the company announced it was moving up the closing of all 1 million of its small business credit card accounts to June 1, and exiting the credit card business as of June 1. In early June, regulators refused to allow Advanta to improve its balance sheet by buying back $1.4 billion of its senior debt notes at a discount. Advanta had planned to pay between 65 percent and 75 percent of the face value of the notes. At the beginning of July 2009, Advanta was directed by the FDIC to stop accepting insured deposits and to repay $35 million to consumers who were improperly denied cash back bonuses or whose accounts had been improperly repriced. In mid-July 2009, the company announced it would lay off half its remaining workforce, going from approximately 400 employees to fewer than 200. On July 20, 2009, the company revealed that the default rate on its credit cards had reached a previously unheard-of 56.95%. In late July 2009, the company was cited as offering dubious investment notes to the public via newspaper ads, but the same article noted that the portion of its website through which the company had been offering the notes was no longer functional. On August 10, 2009, Advanta announced that the way forward for them was to find ‚Äúa plan for new business opportunities‚Äù after posting a second-quarter loss of $330 million. On August 20, 2009, Advanta announced that its chargeoffs had returned to 24.02% following June's peak, June having been so high because of the change from charging off at 180 days of delinquency to charging off at 120 days, however the percentage of cards 30 days late had risen to 9.98% from 8.28%, portending a rise in future chargeoffs. On September 21, 2009, Advanta announced that its chargeoffs had declined to 22.19%; however, 30-day lates had risen to 11.57%. On October 14, 2009, media outlets carried a story that a class action against the company was being readied on behalf of investors. In May 2010, many business card holders were filing the Federal Trade Commission, Better Business Bureau, and AG complaints with regulatory authorities in Utah. Bankruptcy On November 8, 2009, Advanta filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On March 19, 2010, Utah state regulators seized Advanta Bank Corp. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was made the bank's receiver. The FDIC estimates the cost of the failure to its Deposit Insurance Fund to be approximately $635.6 million.https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2010/pr10058.html fdic press release Reorganization The FDIC has arranged with Zions National Bank to accept Government ACH deposits for Advanta Bank Corp. depositors.http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/advanta-ut_q_and_a.html The credit card accounts that still had balances are now being serviced by Cardworks Servicing, LLC of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Some customers reported \\"phantom payments\\" they never made being applied to their account in effort to revalidate the debt and restart the statute of limitations on their several- year-old defaults. On November 2, 2010, Advanta Corp. and its affiliated debtors developed a financial plan. On February, 2011, pursuant to and in accordance with the Joint Plan of Advanta Corp., AC Trust, ASSC Trust and Advanta Finance Trust has made the initial distribution: Advanta National Bank has $100 million in cash and equivalents on hand, also about $138 million of senior retail investment notes and the many offices in the United States, to continues with the banking operations. Advanta Bank Corp. had $2.7 billion portfolio of managed receivables from 360,000 credit cards and other loan customers.

Sutherland (c. 1817 - February 2, 1859) was an American lawyer and pioneer settler of Wisconsin and California. He was the first Village President of Madison, Wisconsin, was United States Attorney for Wisconsin for several years in the 1840s, was a member of the first Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin, and was the last Alcalde (Mayor) of San Diego, California, prior to statehood. He was the eldest son of Joel Barlow Sutherland of Philadelphia, who had been a militia officer in the War of 1812 and served as a Member of Congress when Thomas was a child. Early life and career Thomas W. Sutherland was born c. 1817 in Pennsylvania (he is listed as 33 in the 1850 San Diego Census). In 1835, he traveled to Indiana as a clerk for Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, who had just become commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office and had been tasked by the U.S. government to travel there to make a treaty with an indian tribe. Ellsworth returned east from here, but Sutherland, at age 18, traveled west, meeting a cousin near St. Louis. They traveled together, exploring parts of what is now Iowa and Minnesota. He followed a river route from the Saint Anthony Falls to the location that would later become Madison, Wisconsin, which at the time was still inhabited only by the Ho-Chunk. He spent some time living with the indians on the shore of Lake Monona, and determined that this would become his future home. He returned briefly to Philadelphia to make preparations, then returned to Madison to purchase his lot as soon as land became available under the newly organized Wisconsin Territory. Wisconsin He was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar Association in 1839 and formed a legal partnership in Wisconsin with David Brigham with the endorsement of his father and several other notable politicians. In 1840, at the first session of court in Dane County, Sutherland was one of the first lawyers admitted to practice law in the territory, along with Edward V. Whiton (later Chief Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court), John Hubbard Tweedy, and Morgan Lewis Martin (later congressional delegates for the territory). In 1841 he married Joanna Hudson (born c.1822), the daughter of Philadelphia Doctor Edward Hudson. That same year, he was appointed United States Attorney for the Wisconsin Territory by President John Tyler and remained in that role until the inauguration of James K. Polk in 1845. In 1846, Madison was formally incorporated as a Village and Sutherland became the first President of the Village of Madison. That same year, he became one of the founders of the Wisconsin Historical Society and served as the first Secretary of the organization under President A. Hyatt Smith. In 1848, after Wisconsin became the 30th state, Sutherland was again named United States Attorney to fill the vacancy created by William Pitt Lynde, who had resigned after he was elected to Wisconsin's first congressional delegation. In that consequential year, the new state legislature formalized the state University and established the first Board of Regents. Sutherland was appointed to the Board of Regents by Governor Nelson Dewey, along with other early Wisconsin luminaries such as Edward V. Whiton, Alexander L. Collins, John H. Rountree, and Rufus King. California In the spring of 1849, Sutherland left Wisconsin for California, which had just been annexed by the United States in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Sutherland settled in San Diego, where, in 1850, he served as the final Alcalde (Mayor) of San Diego prior to California becoming a state. That year, on May 5, he and his wife welcomed a son, Thomas, who is claimed to be the first \\"white\\" child born in the territory. He then became District Attorney for San Diego County in 1851. They moved to San Francisco in 1852, where Sutherland continued his law practice. He died on February 2, 1859, in Sacramento, California, and was buried at Lone Mountain Cemetery in San Francisco.

It serves as a College-preparatory school with students from the northwest suburbs of Chicago. Part of the Archdiocese of Chicago, the school is run by The Clerics of Saint Viator. History The Archdiocese of Chicago reallocated some land it had already owned ‚Äî tentatively designated for a future cemetery ‚Äî for educational purposes, and assigned the Clerics of St. Viator to build and run a boys' secondary school. It opened in 1961 to a small class of freshmen and a few sophomores, graduating its first class in 1965. Enrollments waxed and waned over the next few decades. Faced with declining numbers in 1987, the choice was made to merge with Sacred Heart of Mary High School of Rolling Meadows, with which Saint Viator already had a sister school relationship.http://www.illinoisloop.org/cath_closed_school_84_04.pdf The merger occurred in the summer of 1987; Saint Viator absorbed the faculty, staff, and student body of Sacred Heart beginning with the 1987-88 school year, and admitted a co-educational freshman class (the class of 1991). The physical plant remained largely unchanged from its original 1961 footprint. A co-educational student population required the construction of a girls' locker room. This kicked off a string of renovations to occur throughout the 1990s, including a renovation of the boys' locker room, the chapel, and science labs. After a major capital campaign, the school constructed a multipurpose athletic addition, and the Boler Center was dedicated in summer of 2005. In 2014, the Marie Gallagher Academic Commons was dedicated and in 2015 Fr. Louis Querbes Hall and the new fine arts facilities were dedicated. Controversy Since 2007, Saint Viator High School has used hair samples to test each of its 1,000 students for drugs in the fall and then conduct random screens during the rest of the school year. Starting in 2013, the school will also test for alcohol. Private schools have broader legal authority to test students for illegal substances than their public counterparts. And while a few area public high schools do conduct drug testing, the practice is limited to teens in sports or other extracurricular activities. Yet even among private schools, testing students' hair for alcohol use appears to be particularly rare. The testing company, Massachusetts-based Psychemedics Corp., said Saint Viator is among a handful nationwide using the company's new hair test for alcohol. At St. Viator, students are notified of their mandatory testing appointments on the morning of the test. At lunchtime, a school official snips off a sample of about 60 hairs from the crown of each chosen student's head. The alcohol test measures ethyl glucuronide, (EtG), to indicate alcohol consumption in the previous three months. The tests take about a week to process and are capable of indicating a minimum average consumption of two to three drinks per week. Students who test positive must attend a meeting with their parents, counselor and the school president. After 90 days the student will be retested, a second positive will result in more serious disciplinary consequences and possible consideration for dismissal from school. Private schools can in general mandate drug and alcohol tests at their own discretion.Alcohol Testing-Chicago TribuneAlcohol Testing-CBSSaint Viator Parent-Student Handbook Academics Saint Viator follows a Christian Catholic Environment.

Again in 2014, the school was recognized as a blue ribbon school.http://www2.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2014/index.html This time around it was only one of six private high schools in the nation and the only high school in the Archdiocese of Chicago to be recognized.

It does not refer to a specific, recognized treatment method, but rather several controversial and/or unproven interviewing techniques, such as hypnosis and guided imagery, and the use of sedative-hypnotic drugs, which are presently rarely used in the responsible treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and other dissociative disorders. Proponents of recovered memory therapy claim that traumatic memories can be buried in the subconscious and affect current behavior, and that these can be recovered. RMT is not listed in DSM-IV nor is it recommended by mainstream ethical and professional mental health associations. Florence Rush is often seen to be the founder of the recovered memory movement.  Terminology  The term false-memory syndrome was coined between 1992 and 1993 by psychologists and sociologists associated with the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, an organization which advocates on behalf of individuals who claim to have been falsely accused of perpetrating child sexual abuse. These researchers argue that RMT can result in patients recalling instances of sexual abuse from their childhood which had not actually occurred. While not a therapeutic technique in and of itself, RMT generally is applied to such methods as hypnosis, age regression, drug- assisted interviewing (using substances such as sodium amytal), and guided visualization. While practiced by some individual therapists, these techniques were never recognized by the psychiatric or psychological community, and are generally not practiced in mainstream treatment modalities. A 1994 survey of 1000 therapists by Michael D. Yapko found that 19% of the therapists knew of a case in which a client's memory had been suggested by therapy but was in fact false. According to Charles L. Whitfield, while advocates of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation lump all therapies that deal with recovery of trauma memories into one category, regardless of past efficacy, they only attack a few of them. An inquiry by the Australian government into the practice found little support for or use of memory recovery therapies among health professionals, and warned that professionals had to be trained to avoid the creation of false memories. In October 2007, Scientific American published an article critical of recovered memory therapy and dissociative identity disorder diagnoses, especially in relation to the Satanic ritual abuse moral panic. The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation responded by criticizing the article for using the terminology \\"recovered memory therapy\\", which they claim is a straw man for a non-existent modality, and for its skeptical view of dissociative disorder diagnosis. Despite the lack of such a coherent method or training, the term sometimes crops up not only in the popular press but also in government inquiries, court proceedings, and position statements from psychologists' professional associations.ACA Newsletter Spring 2004 Draft position statement on RMT page 109 A 2018 survey found that although 5% of a U.S. public sample reported recovering memories of abuse during therapy (abuse they reported having no previous memory of), none of them used the terminology \\"recovered memory therapy\\"‚Äîinstead those recovering memories reported using a variety of other therapy types (e.g., attachment therapy, Emotional Freedom Techniques, etc).  Research  A range of studies have concluded that at least 10% of physical and sexual abuse victims forget the abuse. The rate of delayed recall of many forms of traumatic experiences (including natural disasters, kidnapping, torture and more) averages among studies at approximately 15%, with the highest rates resulting from child sexual abuse, military combat, and witnessing a family member murdered. The rate of recall of previously forgotten traumatic events was shown by Elliot and Briere (1996) to be unaffected by whether or not the victim had a history of being in psychotherapy. Linda Meyer Williams found that among women with confirmed histories of sexual abuse, approximately 38% did not recall the abuse 17 years later, especially when it was perpetrated by someone familiar to them. Hopper cites several studies of corroborated abuse in which some abuse victims will have intervals of complete or partial amnesia for their abuse. A 1996 interview survey of 711 women reported that forgetting and later remembering childhood sexual abuse is not uncommon; more than a quarter of the respondents who reported abuse also reported forgetting the abuse for some period of time and then recalling it on their own. Of those who reported abuse, less than 2% reported that the recall of the abuse was assisted by a therapist or other professional. Williams demonstrated that a minority of adults failed to disclose documented childhood emergency room visits related to sexual abuse. As well as demonstrating that some people may forget abuse, the data trend indicates that as the amount of force used in the abuse increases, recall also increases. A review article on potentially harmful therapies listed RMT as a treatment that will probably produce harm in some who receive it. Richard Ofshe, a member of the advisory board to the FMSF, describes the practice of \\"recovering\\" memories as fraudulent and dangerous. Studies by Elizabeth Loftus and others have concluded that it is possible to produce false memories of childhood incidents. The experiments involved manipulating subjects into believing that they had some fictitious experience in childhood, such as being lost in a shopping mall at age 6. This involved using a suggestive technique called \\"familial informant false narrative procedure,\\" in which the experimenter claims the validity of the false event is supported by a family member of the subject. The study has been used to support the theory that false memories of traumatic sexual abuse can be implanted in a patient by therapists. Critics of these studies argue that the techniques do not resemble any approved or mainstream treatment modality, and there are criticisms that the implanted events used are not emotionally comparable to sexual abuse. Critics contend that Loftus's conclusions overreach the evidence. Loftus has rebutted these criticisms. Some patients later retract memories they had previously believed to be recovered. While false or contrived memories are possible reasons for such retractions, other explanations suggested for the retraction of allegations of abuse made by children and adults include guilt, a feeling of obligation to protect their family and a reaction to familial stress rather than a genuine belief that their memories are false. The number of retractions is reported to be small compared to the actual number of child sexual abuse allegations made based on recovered memories. A study at the Dissociative Disorders and Trauma Program of the McLean Hospital concluded that recovered memories are mostly unconnected to psychotherapeutic treatment and that memories are often corroborated by independent evidence, often appearing while home or with family and friends, with suggestion being generally denied as a factor in recovering memories. Very few participants were in therapy during their first memory recovery and a majority of participants in this study found strong corroboration of their recovered memories. A 2018 US study is the largest study known that surveys the general public about memory recovery in therapy. The study was presented to participants aged 50 years or older as a \\"Life Experience\\" survey and found that 8% of the 2,326 adults had reported seeing therapists, mostly starting in the 1990s, that discussed the possibility of repressed memories of abuse. 4% of adults had reported recovering memories of abuse in therapy for which they had no previous memory. Recovered memories of abuse were associated with most therapy types.  Professional guidelines  There are several individuals and groups that have published guidelines, criticisms or cautions about recovered memory therapy and techniques to stimulate recall: * In the Brandon Report, a set of training, practice, research and professional development recommendations, the United Kingdom's Royal College of Psychiatrists advised psychiatrists to avoid use of RMT or any \\"memory recovery techniques\\", citing a lack of evidence to support the accuracy of memories recovered in this way. * In 2004, the government of the Health Council of the Netherlands issued a report in response to inquiries from professionals regarding RMT and memories of traumatic child sexual abuse. The Health Council stated that while traumatic childhood experiences were major risk factors for psychological problems in adulthood, the fact that most traumatic memories are well-remembered but can be forgotten or become inaccessible though the influence of specific circumstances precludes a simple description of the relationship between memory and trauma. The report also notes that memories can be confabulated, re-interpreted and even apparently vivid or dramatic memories can be false, a risk that is increased when therapists use suggestive techniques, attempt to link symptoms to past trauma, with certain patients and through the use of methods to stimulate memories. * The Australian Hypnotherapists Association (AHA) issued a similar statement, for contexts where false memories of child sexual abuse may arise. The AHA acknowledges that child sexual abuse is serious, damaging and at least some memories are genuine, while cautioning that some questioning techniques and interventions may lead to illusory memories leading to false beliefs about abuse. * The Canadian Psychological Association has issued guidelines for psychologists addressing recovered memories. Psychologists are urged to be aware of their limitations in knowledge and training regarding memory, trauma and development and \\"that there is no constellation of symptoms which is diagnostic of child sexual abuse\\". The guidelines also urge caution and awareness of the benefits and limitations of \\"relaxation, hypnosis, guided imagery, free associations, inner child exercises, age regression, body memory interpretation, body massage, dream interpretation, and the use of projective techniques\\" and special caution regarding any legal involvement of memories, abuse and therapy.  Legal issues  In Ramona v. Isabella, Gary Ramona sued his daughter's therapist for implanting false memories of his abuse of her. In the first case putting recovered memory therapy, itself, on trial, he eventually was awarded $500,000 in 1994. Discussing RMT in the New South Wales Parliament in 1995, the state Minister for Health, Andrew Refshauge ‚Äì a medical practitioner ‚Äì stated that the general issue of admissibility of evidence based on recovered memories was one for the Attorney General. In 2004 Australian Counselling Association issued a draft position statement regarding recovered memories in which it informed its membership of possible legal difficulties if they affirm accusations as true based solely upon discussion of a patient's recovered memories, without adequate corroborating evidence. A degree of controversy does remain within legal circles, with some holding the view that therapists and courts should consider repressed memories the same as they consider regular memories. Three relevant studies state that repressed memories are \\"no more and no less accurate than continuous memories.\\" Recovered memory therapy was an issue in the criminal trials of some Catholic priests accused of fondling or sexually assaulting juvenile-turned-adult parishioners. In a 2017 criminal case in Canada, a Nova Scotian clergyman, the Reverend Brent Hawkes, was acquitted in a case involving recovered memories of alleged historical sexual abuse when Justice Alan Tufts described in his ruling that the complainant's method of re-constructing his memory of alleged events after joining a men's group and hearing similar accounts from other \\"survivors\\" his evidence could not be reliable. Several court cases awarded multimillion-dollar verdicts against Minnesota psychiatrist Diane Bay Humenansky, who used hypnosis and other suggestive techniques associated with RMT, resulting in accusations by several patients against family members that were later found to be false.Gustafson, Paul.

St. Paul Pioneer Press, Jan. 25, 1996, 4B. In 1999 the Netherlands Board of Prosecutors General formed The National Expert Group on Special Sexual Matters, in Dutch - Landelijke Expertisegroep Bijzondere Zedenzaken (LEBZ). LEBZ consists of a multidisciplinary group of experts of whom investigating police officers and prosecutors are mandated to consult before considering arresting or prosecuting a person accused of sexual crimes involving repressed memories or recovered memory therapy. The LEBZ released a report for the period of 2003 - 2007 stating that 90% of the cases they consulted on were stopped due to their recommendations that the allegations were not based on reliable evidence.

Aiblinger was born in Wasserburg am Inn, Bavaria. In his eleventh year he commenced his studies at Tegernsee Abbey, where he was instructed in piano and organ- playing. Four years later he entered the gymnasium at Munich, where he studied under Professor Schlett, his countryman. In 1800 he began his studies at the University of Landshut. Inwardly drawn to the Catholic Church, he completed his philosophy and began theology, but the secularization of many religious orders in Bavaria prevented his entrance into a cloister. He now devoted himself solely to music. Led by the then prevailing idea that without a visit to Italy no musical education is complete, he turned his footsteps southward. After a stay of eight years at Vicenza, where he fell under the influence of his countryman Johann Simon Mayr, Aiblinger (1811) went to Venice and there met Meyerbeer, who procured for him an appointment at the Conservatory. His failure to establish a school for classical music led him to Milan to assume the direction of the local ballet. On his return to Bavaria, King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria invited him to Munich to direct the Italian opera. King Ludwig I of Bavaria appointed him director of the royal orchestra, and sent him to Italy to collect old Italian masterpieces. On his return be became the organist at the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche, the church of All Saints, for which he wrote many valuable compositions. In the 1820s he wrote two unsuccessful operas, before turning his energies to a crusade against the influence of Italian opera which eventually led to a revival of Christoph Willibald Gluck's Iphigenia in Tauris, re-orchestrated by Aiblinger. Utto Kornm√ºller Lexicon der kirchlichen Tonkunst Then he then turned to church music, studying the old masters and procuring performances of their works. His numerous church compositions comprise masses and requiems, offertories and graduals, psalms, litanies, and German hymns, many of which have been published at Augsburg, Munich, Regensburg, and Mainz. In 1864 he resigned from All Saints, on account of advancing years. He died in Munich.

The most sacred of the Pancha Ishwarams of Sri Lanka, it was built significantly during the reign of the early Cholas and the Five Dravidians of the Early Pandyan Kingdom atop Konesar Malai, a promontory overlooking Trincomalee District, Gokarna bay and the Indian Ocean. Its Pallava, Chola, Pandyan and Jaffna design reflect a continual Tamil Saivite influence in the Vannimai region from the classical period. The monument contains its main shrine to Shiva in the form Kona-Eiswara, shortened to Konesar and is a major place for Hindu pilgrimage, at its height of fame labelled the \\"Rome of the Gentiles/Pagans of the Orient\\". Connected at the mouth of the Mahavilli Ganga River to the footprint of Shiva at Sivan Oli Padam Malai at the river's source, the temple symbolically crowns the flow of the Ganges River from Shiva's head of Mount Kailash to his feet. Developed from 205 BC, the original kovil combined key features to form its basic Dravidian temple plan, such as its thousand pillared hall ‚Äì \\"Aayiram Kaal Mandapam\\" ‚Äì and the Jagati expanded by King Elara Manu Needhi Cholan. Regarded as the greatest building of its age for its architecture, elaborate sculptural bas-relief ornamentation adorned a black granite megalith while its multiple gold plated gopuram towers were expanded in the medieval period. One of three major Hindu shrines on the promontory with a colossal gopuram tower, it stood distinctly on the cape's highest eminence. The journey for pilgrims in the town begins at the opening of Konesar Road and follows a path through courtyard shrines of the compound to the deities Bhadrakali, Ganesh, Vishnu Thirumal, Surya, Raavana, Ambal-Shakti, Murukan and Shiva who presides at the promontory's height. The annual Koneswaram Temple Ther Thiruvilah festival involves the Bhadrakali temple of Trincomalee, the Pavanasam Theertham at the preserved Papanasuchunai holy well and the proximal Back Bay Sea (Theertham Karatkarai) surrounding Konesar Malai. The complex was destroyed in colonial religious attacks between 1622 and 1624 and a fort was built at the site from its debris. A 1632 built temple located away from the city houses some of its original idols. Worldwide interest was renewed following the discovery of its underwater and land ruins, sculptures and Chola bronzes by archaeologists and Arthur C. Clarke. It has been preserved through restorations, most recently in the 1950s. Granted ownership of villages in its floruit to form the Trincomalee District, Trincomalee village is located on the cape isthmus within the compounds. The modern temple has been a source of conflict between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils due to its position in a geostrategically important area. Revenue from the temple provides services and food to local residents. Koneswaram has many strong historical associations. The shrine is described in the Vayu Purana, the Konesar Kalvettu and Tevaram hymns by Sambandhar and Sundarar as a Paadal Petra Sthalam along with its west coast Ishwaram counterpart Ketheeswaram temple, Mannar, it is the birthplace of Patanjali, the compiler of the Yoga Sutras and was praised for its tradition by Arunagirinathar upon his visit. The Dakshina Kailasa Puranam and Manmiam works note it as Dakshina/Then Kailasam (Mount Kailash of the South) for its longitudinal position and pre-eminence, it lies directly east of Kudiramalai west coast Hindu port town, while it is the easternmost shrine of the five ancient Ishwarams of Shiva on the island. Mentioned as a widely popular bay temple of the island in the Mahabharata, Ramayana and Yalpana Vaipava Malai, the Mattakallappu Manmiam confirms its sacred status for all Hindus. Kachiyappa Sivachariar‚Äôs Kanda Puranam compares the temple to Thillai Chidambaram Temple and Mount Kailash in Saivite esteem. Konesar Malai may have been the site where Yoga originated; some scholars have suggested that the worship of the almighty god Eiswara on the promontory is the most ancient form of worship existing.Eleven years in Ceylon: Comprising sketches of the field sports and natural history of that colony, and an account of its history and antiquities, Volume 2.

Etymology=Kona, Eiswara and Trincomalee In the Tamil language, temples are known as kovils,; thus the temple complex is known locally as Konecharam Kovil (), the abode of Kona‚ÄîEiswara (the Chief Lord or God). The presiding Shiva deity's names are Konesar () (pronounced Konechar or Konasir ‚Äì a compound of Kona and Eiswara), Koneswaran, Kona‚ÄîNatha and the goddess consort is called Mathumai Amman (another name for Mother goddess Amman).Hugh Chisholm (1911). The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 27. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. pp. 284 It later earned the title Thiru Koneswaram Kovil. The origin of the term Ko or Kone lies in the Old Tamil word for the terms \\"Lord\\", \\"King\\" or \\"Chief\\", which allude to the deity that presides here; this term appears in several Damili inscriptions of the sixth century B.C. ‚Äì second century A.D. Trincomalee, the coastal peninsula town where Koneswaram is located is an Anglicized form of the old Tamil word \\"Thiru-kona-malai\\" (), meaning \\"Lord of the Sacred Hill\\", its earliest reference in this form found in the Tevaram of the seventh century by Sampandar. Thiru is a word generally used to denote a \\"sacred\\" temple site while Malai means mountain or hill; Middle Tamil manuscripts and inscriptions mention the monumental compound shrine as the Thirukonamalai Konesar Kovil. Kona () has other meanings in Old Tamil such as peak, while another origin for the term Koneswaram could come from the Tamil term Kuna (East). Therefore, other translators suggest definitions of Trincomalee such as \\"sacred angular/peaked hill\\", \\"sacred eastern hill\\" or \\"three peaked hill\\". Greek writer Strabo, quoting Eratosthenes and Onesicritus notes the island's proximity to the southernmost regions of India, next to the country of the \\"Koniakoi people,\\" found south up to a coastal promontory on an eastern limit, and describes the island as extending towards Ethiopia and being home to elephants.Eratosthenes, Duane W. Roller (2010). Eratosthenes' \\"Geography\\". pp. 180. \\"Taprobane\\" (one of several names of the island known to Greeks and Romans) is perhaps Sanskrit \\"Tambraparni\\", encountered by Greeks through Tamil \\"Tampirapanni\\": See Lionel Casson, (1989). The Periplus Maris Erythraei. Princeton. pp. 230‚Äì232John Watson McCrindle (1971). Ancient India as described in classical literature. pp. 18‚Äì20 The temple was constructed atop Swami Rock, also called Swami Malai or Kona-ma-malai, a cliff on the peninsula that drops 400 feet (120 metres) directly into the sea. Gokarna bay and Bhadrakali Koneswaram temple, Trincomalee The Trincomalee Harbour, a circular natural harbour which the temple crowns towards the north, is referred to as Ko-Kannam or \\"Lord's Cheek\\", alluding to the cheek shape of Shiva's bull Nandi. The Sanskrit equivalent of the port town's harbour bay is Go-Karna, meaning \\"Cow's Ear\\" or Gokarna Pattana and the deity's name Gokarneswara or Go‚ÄîNatha in Sanskrit. Pathmanathan offers the etymological link Thiru-Gokarna-Malai or Thiru-Gona-Malai based on this connection.S. Pathmanathan, The Kingdom of Jaffna, Colombo, 1978. pages 135‚Äì144 The ethnographer Megasthenes writing in his Indica from 350‚Äî290 B.C., describes the island as being divided by a long river, productive of a large number of gold and pearls in one half and that the inhabitants of this country are called Paleogoni, meaning Old Goni in Tamil and Greek, who Pliny adds worshipped Hercules and Dionysus (Bacchus) like the Pandyans of Tamilakam.McCrindle 1877: pp. 62‚Äì63 The Vayu Purana, written in 300 A.D. specifically mentions the tallest mountain peak of the great gold and silver rich mountain range Malaya on the island, and that \\"to the east of this island at the shore of the sea lies a great Siva temple in a holy place called Gokarna.\\"H.N. Apte, Vayupurana, Chapter 48 verses 20‚Äì30, Poona, 1929 Gokarna is also a place name in Karnartaka, India, Kalinga, Tamil Nadu and Nepal all associated with ancient Shiva temples and some with Ravana of the Ramayana, the former temple in Karnartaka ‚Äì the Mahabaleshwar Temple ‚Äì also earning praise in the Tevaram. A major shrine to the deity Bhadrakali exists within the Mahabaleshwar Temple complex, and similarly the Bhadrakali Amman Temple of Trincomalee, dedicated to the same deity and significantly expanded by Rajendra Chola I, stands on Konesar Road before the entrance to Swami Rock.An inscription of the Cola king, Rajendra I (1012‚Äì1044 A.D.) was found recently at the goddess Kali's Temple in Trincomalee, detailing his expansion of the shrine.

Kailash of the South The mountain of Adam's Peak is revered in Hindu literature as Sivan Oli Patha Malai, where a petrosomatoglyph of Shiva's footprint is found near Agastya's ashram. From this peak of the Trikuta Malaya mountain range of ancient Ceylon rises the Mahavili Ganga River ‚Äì the island's largest river ‚Äì whose estuary is immediately south of Koneswaram at Gokarna Bay, Indian Ocean. The temple symbolically crowns the flow of the Ganges River from Shiva's head of Mount Kailash to his feet Heralded as \\"Dakshina Kailasam\\"/\\"Then Kailasam\\" (Kailash of the South) because it lies on exactly the same longitude as the Tibetan mountain Mount Kailash (the primary abode of Shiva), Koneswaram's early black granite rock-cut architectural style shared similarities to Kailasanathar Temples of the subcontinent. Its traditional history and legends were compiled into the Sanskrit treatises Dakshina Kailasa Puranam ‚Äì Sthala Puranam of Koneswaram, written in 1380 by Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan, and the Dakshina Kailasa Manmiam ‚Äì three chapters of the Skanda Puranam of unknown antiquity ‚Äì manuscripts of which have been discovered and dated from the 5th ‚Äì 7th century.S.

The compiler of the Yoga Sutras, Pata√±jali's place of birth at the temple corroborates Tirumular's Tirumandhiram, which describes him as hailing from Then Kailasam and his self description as a \\"Gonardiya\\" from Gonarda, \\"a country in the southern and eastern division\\" of the Indian continent.Romesh Chunder Dutt (2001).

Patanjali famously visited the Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram, where he wrote the Charana Shrungarahita Stotram on Nataraja.Manohar Laxman Varadpande (1987). History of Indian Theatre, Volume 1, pp. 80‚Äì81 Matsya (Vishnu-Thirumal) and Shakti Koneswaram temples, Trincomalee In Kanda Puranam, the epic authored by Kachiyappa Sivachariar, Koneswaram is venerated as one of the three foremost Shiva abodes in the world, alongside Thillai Chidambaram Temple and Mount Kailash. The Vishnu-Thirumal shrine of the Koneswaram complex repaired by Kullakottan Chola was referred to as the Thirukonamalai Macchakeswaram/Macceswaram Kovil in some Middle Tamil inscriptions such as the Nilaveli inscription of the 10th century, a Tamil rendering of the Sanskrit Matsyakesvara.On palaeographical and other considerations this epigraphic record could be assigned to the late 10th or early 11th century. It records a grant of 250 veli of land on the coast, to the shrine of Nilakanta Mahadevar at Matsyakesvaram on Konaparvatam of Tirukonamalai for conducting daily worship and rituals. Nittavinotapuram, Patiyana Aipolilpattinam, Makalana, Vikkiramacalamekapuram, Matottamana Iramakulavallip pattinam are some of the merchant towns where archaeological remains of monuments datable to the period of Chola administration have been found. In fact, Matsya is the fish incarnation of Vishnu, and this shrine's significance along with that of the third pagoda of the promontory to the goddess is expounded further in the Dakshina Kailasa Puranam and the Thirukonasala Puranam.P. P. Vaidyalinga Desicar (ed.), Daksinakailasapuranam, Jaffna, 1916, Tirunakaraccurukkam, vv. 31‚Äì34, p. 68A Sanrnugaratna Ayyar ed., Tirukkonasalapuranam, Jaffna, 1909, Avaiyadakkarn, p. 6 The temple's \\"Aayiram Kaal Mandapam\\" earned it the title Pagoda of Trincomalee ‚Äì Temple of a Thousand Columns among Europeans. The rocky promontory is dedicated to Siva in his ancient form of Kona-Eiswara, and is a major centre of pilgrimage today. The worship of Eiswara is noted to have been the original worship of the island; Charles Pridham, Jonathan Forbes and George Turnour state that it is probable there is no more ancient form of worship existing than that of Eiswara upon his sacred promontory.Constance Frederica Gordon Cumming (1893). Two happy years in Ceylon. pp. 295Jonathan Forbes, George Turnour. (1840). Eleven years in Ceylon: Comprising sketches of the field sports and natural history of that colony, and an account of its history and antiquities. p. 44 History= Origins and date of establishment  The construction time of Koneswaram has been estimated by comparison between carved reliefs on the temple's ruins, literature on the shrine and the inscriptions commonly used in royal charters from the 5th to 18th centuries. Koneswaram was likely founded before 400 B.C., although its exact date of birth remains vague. The evidence extant attests to the shrine's classical antiquity. Construction of Hindu temples was made possible due to the prevalent faith amongst the locals and mercantile communities in the region during the Sangam period.Dr. Paul E. Pieris declared in 1917, at a meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society (Ceylon Branch), there was in Lanka five recognized 'Eeswarams' of Siva, which claimed and received adoration of all India. These were Tiruketheeswaram near Mahathitha, Munneswaram, Thondeswaram, Tirukoneswaram and Naguleswaram. Royal Asiatic Society (Ceylon Branch) Kaviraja Varothiyan's Tamil poem inscribed on the Konesar Kalvettu, the 17th century stone inscription chronicle of the temple, gives the shrine's date of birth as circa 1580 B.C. Archaeologists point to its initial phase consisting of a rock cave, multilayered brick shrine style popularly constructed to Tamil deities of a range of faiths during the Sangam period (see Religion in ancient Tamil country). bas-relief of the temple, reminiscent of the dynasty's coinage symbols found on the island from the pre-modern era, installed after defeating the usurper Chandrabhanu of Tambralinga Contemporary historians such as S. Pathmanathan and Paul E. Peiris suggest Koneswaram temple has a recorded history from 300, when it finds mention in the Vayu Purana. Peiris notes that Koneswaram was one of the five recognised Iswarams of the Hindu deity Shiva in Lanka before the sixth century B.C.; a widely famous centre of deity worship long before the arrival of the mythical exile Vijaya to the island, attributed to the period 543‚Äî505 B.C. Koneswaram is the easternmost shrine of the Iswarams, the others being Naguleswaram (Keerimalai), Thiruketheeswaram (Mannar), Munneswaram (Chilaw) and Tenavaram (Tevan Thurai). The historian Diogo de Couto of the 16th century adds Ramanathaswamy Temple, Rameswaram to this group of principle temples in the region most revered on the Indian subcontinent.Jo√£o de Barros, Manoel Severim de Faria, Jo√£o Baptista Lavanha. Da Asia de Jo√£o de Barros e de Diogo de Couto, Volume 13.: Asia de Diogo de Coto. pp. 31 Other writers point to the worship of Eiswara by mythical royals on the island like Kuveni before the exile's arrival. Pathmanathan differs from Peiris in his view on the shrine's birth however, stating that Koneswaram temple was most likely established as a Hindu shrine by the mercantile communities that frequented the island from the fourth-century B.C. Kalinga region in India, where another temple dedicated to Shiva in the form Gokarnasvamin at Mahendra mountains is found. The Yalpana Vaipava Malai, an 18th-century Tamil chronicle connects the figure Vijaya and seven hundred of his followers to the shrine, stating they extensively repaired the five Iswarams upon their arrival to the island, before mixing with native tribes on the island forming matrimonial links with the Tamil kingdom through Pandyan queens. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica currently appears to follow this view, although in volume 10 of the encyclopedia, printed in 1974, the shrine's establishment is attributed to Tamil migrants. Encyclopedia Americana and New International Encyclopedia note that early Tamil rulers erected the temple of a thousand columns on the hilltop.Frank Moore Colby, Talcott Williams. (1923). The New international encyclopaedia, Volume 22. pp. 476The encyclopedia Americana, Volume 27 (2002). pp. 112 King Ellalan Manu Needhi Cholan in 205 B.C. and the prince Kulakottan of the Chola Dynasty extensively renovated the Koneswaram temple and the Kantalai Tank, responsible for irrigating plains belonging to the shrine. The latter's reign is alternatively attributed to between 1580 B.C. and 1250. Due to royal patronage by various Tamil dynasties from the early classical to medieval era, the temple flourished in the early centuries of the First Millennium. Hindus built at least three great stone temples with gopura on Swami Rock during Koneswaram's zenith, one to Vishnu-Thirumal, one to the goddess and the principal temple of the complex to Lord Shiva at its highest eminence. Naga Nadu, pre 377 B.C. Mahabharata, the Hindu epic written between 400‚Äî100 B.C. notes that Koneswaram is at Gokarna bay, in the middle of the ocean and is the island shrine of Uma's consort Shiva, known in the three worlds and worshiped by all peoples from the subcontinent, including the native tribes Naga, Deva and the Yaksha, the rivers, ocean and mountains. It continues that the shrine is the next pilgrimage spot for Hindus en route south following Kanyakumari of the early Pandyan kingdom and Tamiraparni island (Kudiramalai) and that worshipers should fast for three days at the temple.\\"Listen as I now recount the isle of Tamraparni, gemmed upon the ocean. The gods underwent austerities there, in a desire to attain greatness. In that region also is the lake of Gokarna. Then one should go to Gokarna, renowned in the three worlds. O Indra among kings! It is in the middle of the ocean and is worshipped by all the worlds. Brahma, the Devas, the rishis, the ascetics, the bhutas (spirits or ghosts), the yakshas, the pishachas, the kinnaras, the great nagas, the siddhas, the charanas, the gandharvas, humans, the pannagas, rivers ocean and mountains worship Uma's consort there\\". Mahabharata. Volume 3. pp. 46‚Äì47, 99 In the same time period, the Ramayana in written form describes how King Ravana and his mother had worshipped Shiva at the shrine, when the former wanted to remove the temple of Koneswaram when his mother was in ailing health. This literature continues that as the king was heaving the rock, Lord Shiva made him drop his sword. As a result of this a cleft was created on the rock, today called Ravana Vettu ‚Äì meaning Ravana's Cleft. Restoration in Anuradhapura kingdom, 377 B.C. ‚Äì 600 A.D. The Chola royal Kankan (Kulakkottan), a descendant of the legendary King Manu Needhi Cholan of Thiruvarur, Chola Nadu, restored the Koneswaram temple at Trincomalee and the Kantalai tank after finding them in ruins. He was the son of the king Vara Rama Tevan, who had been a prolific benefactor of the Konesar temple. Kulakkottan visited the Munneswaram temple on the west coast, before settling ancient Vanniars in the east of the island. According to the chronicles, he extensively renovated and expanded the shrine, constructed several lofty gopuram towers and lavished much wealth on it; he was crowned with the ephitet Kulakkottan meaning Builder of tank and temple. Further to the reconstruction, Kulakottan paid attention to agriculture cultivation and economic development in the area, inviting the Vanniar chief Tanniuna Popalen and several families to a new founded town in the area including Thampalakamam to maintain the Kantalai tank and the temple itself. The effects of this saw the Vanni region flourish. The Vanniar claim descent from this chief. Kullakottan's restorations took place despite interferences from the queen of the Pandyan King Pandia, who was absent from his throne in Anuradhapura on a visit to Jaffna. Kullakottan constructed and re-established the large temple of Shiva, the temple of Vishnu and that of the Mother-Goddess (Tirukkamakkottam) on the promontory, these shrines of the compound becoming the Three Pagodas of Tirukonamalai.Taksina Kailacapuranam,(tkp): Tirunakarac Carukkam, Vv 28‚Äì29., 52‚Äì89. Temples of Siva in Sri Lanka, Chinmaya Mission of Sri Lanka, Colombo, 1999, p. 19.; Tkp: Tirunakarac Carukkam. The Yalpana Vaipava Malai and Konesar Kalvettu, as well as a 16th-century Tamil inscription in Trincomalee and Tamil copper-plate inscriptions of the temple relate many details about Kullakottan's founding of Trincomalee and the Vanni. Modern historians and anthropologists agree as historically factual the connection of the Vanniars with the Konesar temple. Dating the reign of the king has proved difficult. The Konesar Kalvettu dates Kullakottan's renovations to specifically between 432‚Äî440. C. Rasanayagam notes that the Vanniar chiefs who were in control of the temple could not have multiplied so fast within 150 years causing the king Aggrabodhi I of Anuradhapura to take elaborate steps to contain the Vanniars in 593. He argues the Vanniars of the Vannimai were a buffer state between Trincomalee and Mannar from the classical period. Other historians suggest that Kullakottan arrived to the island during the island's reign of The Five Dravidians of Pandyan descent, between 103‚Äî88 B.C., corroborating the Yalpana Vaipava Malai equation of his grandfather Manu Needhi Chola's identity with that of Ellalan Chola, a historical king who ruled the island from 205‚Äî161 B.C. that shared many character traits with the legendary Manu Needhi. In Geography of Avienus, a poem of Latin geographer and writer Rufius Festus Avienus in 350 A.D., the author bases his writing on the island on Orbis descriptio by Alexandrian Greek poet Dionysius Periegetes (117‚Äî138 A.D.), who called the island the \\"great Island of Coliadis\\" whose inhabitants worship the multi-towered Cholian temple to Venus on their Cholian rock promontory by the sea. A twelfth-century commentary on Periegetes by Eustathius of Thessalonica also compares the shape of Konesar Malai to a phallus. The Portuguese historian De Quieroz cited poetic and inscriptional evidence to date Kullakottan's renovations to 1589 B.C., based on a Tamil poem by Kavi Raja Virothayan he read which was translated into English in 1831 by Simon Cassie Chitty. A major temple of the compound was built to the glory of the God Videmal by King Manica Raja 1300 years before the nativity according to Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indi√´n written in 1726 by Fran√ßois Valentijn.Robert Fellowes; Robert Knox.

Sixth-seventh century A.D. hymn, Pallava kingdom In the 6th century, a special coastal route by boat travelled from the Jaffna peninsula southwards to the Koneswaram temple, and further south to Batticaloa to the Thirukkovil. Koneswaram temple of Kona-ma-malai is mentioned in the Saiva literature Tevaram in the late sixth century A.D. by Thirugnana Sambandar. Along with Ketheeswaram temple in Mannar, Koneswaram temple is praised in the same literature canon by the 8th century Nayanar Saint Sundarar in Tamilakkam. Koneswaram henceforth is glorified as one of 275 Shiva Sthalams (holy Shiva abodes glorified in the Tevarams) of the continent, part of the \\"Paadal Petra Sthalam\\" group. The only other holy temple from Eela NƒÅdu (the country of the temple as named in the Tamil literature) is Ketheeswaram. During this period, the temple saw structural development in the style of Dravidian rock temples by the Tamil Pallava Dynasty. This occurred when Pallava King Narasimhavarman I (630‚Äì668 A.D.) armies conquered the island and when the island was under the sovereignty of his grandfather King Simhavishnu (537‚Äì590 A.D.), when many Pallava-built rock temples were erected in the region and this style of architecture remained popular in the next few centuries.Humphrey William Codrington. Short History of Ceylon. pp. 36Sachindra Kumar Maity. Masterpieces of Pallava Art. pp.4 The 8th‚Äì10th century Kanda Puranam (a Puranic Tamil literature epic and translation of the Skanda Puranam) authored by Kachiyappa Sivachariar of Kanchipuram describes the Koneswaram shrine as one of the three foremost Shiva abodes in the world, alongside Chidambaram temple in Tamil Nadu and Mount Kailash of Tibet. Several inscriptions written in the Tamil and Vatteluttu scripts interspersed with Grantha characters relate to the temple from this period. Koneswaram temple is mentioned in the 10th century Tamil Nilaveli inscriptions as having received a land grant in the Tamil country of one thousand seven hundred and ten acres (two hundred and fifty four v√®li) of dry and wet land to meet its daily expenses ‚Äì revealing the temple's role in providing various services to the local community by 900‚Äî1000 A.D. The fertile Koddiyapuram area of Trincomalee district paid one hundred avanams of rice to the shrine and was tasked with growing oil seed for Koneswaram annually. Tenth-twelfth century Chola empire Golden statue of Shiva in front of partially restored Koneswaram temple where the inscriptional poem praising Raja Raja Chola I was found Trincomalee figured prominently during the medieval golden age of the Tamil Chola Dynasty, due to the proximity of the Trincomalee bay harbour with the rest of the continent and its benefits for the Chola's maritime empire and the two powerful merchant guilds of the time ‚Äì the Manigramam and the Five Hundred Lords of Ayyavolu in their trade with the far east and conquest of Srivijaya of the Malay archipelago and Indonesia.Chola-era inscriptions record the activities of Tamil mercantile communities in Padavikulam. The mercantile groups referred to were the Ticai Aayirattu Ain Nurruvar (Velupillai, Ceylon Tamil Inscriptions, 1971) and the Ayyavole. Taniyappan, a merchant from Padavikulam, laid a foundation stone for a Siva temple there. A Tamil inscription by Raja Raja Chola refers to Ravi Kulamanikkeswaram Siva Temple in Padavikulam. (K. Indrapala, Epigraphia Tamilica, Jaffna Archeological Society, 1971 ‚Äì page 34). A 13th-century Sanskrit inscription excavated here mentions a Brahmin village in the area. The paddy fields of Padavikulam were watered by the Per Aru river.Abraham, Meera (1988). Two medieval merchant guilds of south India. pp. 132 The Koneswaram temple compounds and its adjacent region, from Periyakulam and Manankerni in the north, Kantalai and Pothankadu in the west, and Verugal in the south, formed a great Saiva Tamil principality. Residents in this collective community were allotted services, which they had to perform at the Koneswaram temple. An inscriptional record containing a praiseful poem of Raja Raja Chola I, who ruled the northern Malabar country from 993 to 1014 A.D. was discovered in the 1970s within the premises of the Koneswaram temple.S. Vithiananthan (1980). NƒÅnÃ≤kƒÅvatu AnÃ≤aittulakat TamilÃ≤ƒÅrƒÅycci MakƒÅnƒÅ·π≠·π≠u nikalÃ≤ccika·∏∑, YƒÅlÃ≤ppƒÅ·πáam, CanÃ≤avari, 1974, Volume 2. pp. 32George Woolley Spencer (1983).

Tamil inscriptions of the nearby Choleeswaram temple ruins of Peraru, Kantalai and the Manankerni inscriptions reveal the administrative practices of the Chola King Ilankeshvarar Devar (Sri Cankavanamar) with the Koneswaram shrine and the Trincomalee region at the time. Construction activities at the temple were aided by architect and Chola dignitary Muventavelan Kanavati. The Palamottai inscription from the Trincomalee district, found amongst the inscriptions in nearby Kantalai, records a monetary endowment to the \\"Siva temple of Then Kailasam (Kailash of the South)\\" by a Tamil widow for the merit of her husband. This was administered by a member of the Tamil military caste ‚Äì the Velaikkarar, troops deployed to protect shrines in the state that were closely associated to King Ilankeshvarar Devar. King Gajabahu II who ruled Polonnaruwa from 1131 to 1153 A.D. is described in the Konesar Kalvettu as a devout worshipper of Lord Shiva and a benefactor of the temple of Konamamalai. King Chodaganga Deva, a descendant of King Virarajendra Chola's grandson Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva ‚Äì the progenitor of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh ‚Äì made rich donations after visiting Konamamalai on Tamil New Years Day 1223 A.D., according to a Sanskrit inscription in Grantha script excavated on a doorjamb at the Hindu temple. A millennium-old Tamil inscription of the Chola Vatteluttu alphabet was discovered in October 2010 when digging for construction on an esplanade on the right side of Konesar Road leading to the shrine. Pandyan kingdom, thirteenth century Pandyan era Koneswaram inscription The Ananda Nilayam gopuram tower of the vimanam, the inner and outer gopurams of the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, Tirupati, with Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan's Kalasam visible. Sundara Pandyan gold plated the gopurams and placed the kalasam atop the towers of both Tirumala Venkateswaram and Thirukonamamalai Koneswaram Kovils.

Published in 1687 dated The temporal and spiritual conquest of Ceylon by Fern√£o de Queyroz Involvement of the medieval Pandyan Dynasty in the affairs of the Tamil country became stronger after the conquest of Pandyan king Srimara Srivallabha from 815‚Äî862, a strongly welcomed intervention by the local Tamils on the island. While under Pandyan suzerainty in 1262 A.D., Prince Jatavarman Veera Pandyan I, brother and lieutenant of King Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I repeated his brother's 1258 conquest of the island to intervene and decisively defeat Chandrabhanu of Tambralinga, a usurper of the northern Tamil throne; he proceeded to implant the Pandyan bull flag of victory and insignia of a \\"Double Fish\\" emblem at Konamalai while he subjugated the other king of the island. Historically, the Pandyans were known to have sculpted two fishes facing each other on the ceilings of their multi- storey temple gopurams once they were completed (and left it with one fish in case it was incomplete). Sundara Pandyan had renovated the gopurams by gold plating the roofs and installing gold gilded Kalasam atop them, a work of art displaying affinity to Dravidian architecture. Swami Rock at this time is described as \\"Kona ma-malai, around which the ocean waves swept pearls, gold, precious stones, and shells from the depth of the ocean and heaped them along the shore.\\" Local residents contributed to the wealth of the temple under the Pandyan's rule of the north of the island. The 13th century Tamil stone inscription in Kankuveli village records the assignment by Vanniar chiefs Malaiyil Vanniyanar and Eluril Atappar of income and other contributions from the rice fields and meadows of the Vannimai districts of the ascending Jaffna kingdom to the Koneswaram shrine. Jaffna kingdom (1215‚Äì1620 A.D.) The Tamil Aryacakravarti dynasty kings of the Jaffna kingdom paid homage to the Koneswaram shrine under its sovereignty, offering gifts of gold and silver. Among the visitors were King Singai Pararasasegaram and his successor King Cankili I. King Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan (1380‚Äî1410 A.D.) had the traditional history of the temple compiled as a chronicle in verse, entitled Dakshina Kailasa Puranam, known today as the Sthala Puranam of Koneswaram Temple. The literature describes how from the middle of Sivanoli Padam Malai, three rivers or \\"kankai\\" (Ganges) were generated to rise out of Shiva's foot print ‚Äì Mavillie-Kankai flowing towards the North, reaches Shiva's abode at Trincomalee, and falls into the sea south of it. Manikka-Kankai flows towards the East and passes by the temple of Kadirkamam, dedicated to Muruga, son of Shiva, and then falls into the eastern sea. Kavary-Kankai flows towards the West, and passes into the place of Shiva called Thiruketheecharam at Manthottam in Mannar. These three rivers are described as \\"highly meritorious streams\\". He shipped stone blocks from Trincomalee to the temple of Rameswaram to renovate its sanctum sanctorum. Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan's successor Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan (Pararacacekaran V), a trustee at Rameswaram who also oversaw structural development of that temple and the promotion of Saivite belief, donated part of his revenue to Koneswaram. The powerful Jaffna emperor Martanda Cinkaiariyan (Pararasasekaram III) took the Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta to Sivanoli Padam Malai in 1344 A.D. along with four yogis who were in the habit of visiting the foot-mark on the mountain peak annually; and with these men they were also accompanied by four Brahmanas and ten of the king's companions. In 1468 A.D. Saint Arunagirinathar Swamikal paid homage at Koneswaram during his pilgrimage from Jaffna's Nallur Kandaswamy temple to Kadirkamam. At Koneswaram, he offered a garland of Thiruppugazh verses in praise of the Sthalam. The population, he stated, at Koneswaram, where the deep ocean rolled its furious waves, was vast, the temple well organised and the priests well versed in the Four Vedas. The shrine of Muruga, adoring son of Konesar and his consort, was near one of the gopuram entrances of the complex. A rich collection of local texts written since the fourteenth century record the traditions pertaining to the shrine, including Konamamalai temple's use of the alternate name \\"Maccakeswaram\\". A temple of a thousand columns, during this medieval period, Koneswaram attracted pilgrims from around the Coylot Wanees Country and across Asia, culminating in it becoming the richest and most visited place of worship in the world of any faith. The last rites during the funeral of King Bhuvanekabahu VII of Kotte, a Hindu monarch who signed all of his official proclamations in Tamil were conducted at Koneswaram in 1551. His closest religious official and most trusted ambassador was of Hindu faith. Historian Diogo do Couto described the Pagode of Triquinimale as a principle temple of its kingdom while Portuguese Catholic priest and author Fern√£o de Quieroz described it as the \\"Rome of the Hindus of the Orient more frequented by pilgrims than Rameshwaram, Tirumalai-Tirupati, Kilvelur, Kanchipuram, Jagannath in Odisha or Vaijayanti in Bengal.\\" Furthermore, he described the splendor of the famous temple of Tenavarai at its zenith as similar in its greatness on the island to Koneswaram and how idolatrous navigators would descry Koneswaram from the sea. In a 1613 written letter by Jesuit fray Manuel Barradas, Koneswaram is described as a \\"... massive structure, a singular work of art. It is of great height, constructed with wonderful skill in blackish granite, on a rock projecting into the sea, and occupies a large space on the summit.\\"Perniola, V. \\"The Catholic church in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese period\\", vol. II, p. 366. King Ethirimana Cinkam had resisted a call by D. Hieronymo de Azevedo the previous year to aid the latter in building a fortress in Trincomalee. The enterprise was abandoned.Perniola, V. \\"The Catholic church in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese period\\", Vol. II, p. 366. With the defeat of King Cankili II, all of the territory of the kingdom of Jaffna, comprising Trincomalee and Batticaloa, was assigned to the \\"spiritual cures of the Franciscans.\\" This decision was taken by the bishop of Cochin, fray Dom Sebasti√£o de S. Pedro.Perniola, V. \\"The Catholic church in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese period\\", vol. II, p. 458.; Perniola, V. \\"The Catholic church in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese period\\", vol. III, p. 51.: Later, another decree of the same bishop of Cochin dated 11 November 1622, tracing that one indicated in 1602, entrusted newly to the Jesuits the spiritual cure in the districts of Jaffna, Trincomalee and Batticaloa, giving to them possibility to build churches, to train the sacraments and to convert the souls. The Jesuits would follow the Portuguese soldiers to Trincomalee and Batticaloa when they occupied the two localities. By the end of 1619, a small Danish fleet had arrived at Trincomalee; in May 1620, the Danes occupied Koneswaram temple and began works for the fortification of the peninsula before being defeated.Barner Jensen, U. \\"Danish East India. Trade coins and the coins of Tranquebar, 1620‚Äì1845\\", pp. 11‚Äì12; Holden Furber \\"Imperi rivali nei mercati d'oriente, 1600‚Äì1800\\", note n¬∞ 66, p. 326: \\"Senarat of Kandy sent to Trincomalee 60 Sinhala men in order to help the Danes in the construction of their fort.

Eleven brass lamps had been lit in the shrine and the main statues were taken out to town during the ther procession in the festive period, during which time Portuguese soldiers entered the temple dressed as Iyer priests and began robbing it. In an act of religious zeal, the temple was then levered over the edge into the sea. Fleeing priests buried some of the temple's statues in the surrounding area, and all remaining priests, pilgrims and employees were massacred. The final monument of the temple complex was destroyed two years later in 1624. Temple stones and its carved pillars were used to construct Fort Fredrick to strengthen the colonists' influence over the eastern seaboard of the island against other invading European armies, including the Dutch navy during the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese Wars. A new church and village were built in and around the fort. An extensive campaign of destruction of five hundred Hindu shrines, the Saraswathi Mahal Library and forced conversion in the Tamil country was conducted by the Portuguese upon their arrival to the island and conquest of the Jaffna kingdom; the temple had been paying protection fees of 1280 fanams a year to the Portuguese. Trincomalee witnessed several naval battles of Europe's Thirty Years' War under Phillip II's man Filipe de Oliveira.Gnanaprakasar, S. A critical history of Jaffna, pp. 153‚Äì72. Between 1639 and 1689 A.D., the Ati Konanayakar temple was built in nearby Thampalakamam to house the idols on procession that survived. The destruction of the Konesar temple is historically viewed as the biggest loot of one of the richest temples of Asia. Gold, pearls, precious stones and silks collected for more than a millennium were robbed within a few hours. A site plan by De Quieroz states: \\"On the first rise to the summit of the rock was a Pagoda, another at mid-ascent ‚Äì the principal one of them all at the highest eminence, visited by a concourse of Hindus from the whole of India.\\" He describes three temples of the compound on the promontory, stating that pilgrims leaped from the last temple into the ocean in sacrifice to their idols. In his dispatch to Philip III, King of Portugal, Constantine described: \\"The land of the Pagoda is 600 fathoms long and 80 feet at its broadest, narrowing to 30 feet.\\" Regarding a prophetic Tamil inscription de Noronha found at the site, he added \\"When I went there to make this Fort, I found engraved on the Pagoda, among many other inscriptions, one that ran thus: Kulakottan has built this pagoda...\\" Swami Rock (18th - 20th centuries) The first photograph of Swami rock and ruins of Koneswaram in 1870, prior to the reconstruction of the temple. Local residents offered services to a pillar from the original mandapam in memory of the destroyed temple Under Dutch Ceylon, most of Trincomalee town was administered under Jaffna-dependent Vanniars again, while the fort was occupied by the Dutch on what they called \\"Pagoda Hill\\". Batticaloa district remained dependent to Trincomalee's fort until 1782.Jacob Burnand. Memoir No ceremonies were permitted to take place on Swami Rock until British rule of the island, when pilgrims were permitted to return and worship Shiva at the fortressed sacred site. By the mid-19th century, sailors, the high priest and other pilgrims visited the rock, broke a coconut and said prayers, performing sacred rites every January. Fruits and other offerings were often cast over the edge of the cliff, falling to the ruins below. The first photograph of the shrine's remains and its promontory was taken in 1870. Literature on the shrine began to be written as the site began to regain popularity among pilgrims. Thirukonasala Puranam was written during the 19th century by Tamil scholar Masilamanipillai Muttucumaru on the temple and the Thirukonasala Vaipavam on Koneswaram was written by V. Akilesapillai in 1889, published sixty years later in 1952. Idol recovery, ruins and 20th-century reconstruction Antonio Bocarro draws Koneswaram temple monuments at the end of the promontory in 1635. The compound had been largely destroyed a decade earlier to build the large fort depicted. In 1950, the Urban Council of Trincomalee recovered a number of the original shrine's statues buried five hundred yards from the Koneswaram site. The discovery occurred during digging for a water well. The statues are of gold and copper alloy bronze and are believed to be from the tenth century A.D. They depict a seated figure of Shiva (in the form of Somaskanda), Shiva as Chandrasekhar, his consort goddess Parvati, the goddess Mathumai Ambal and Lord Ganesh. They were taken in procession around the region before being reinstalled at Koneswaram. Other Koneswaram statues that survived remain at the Ati Konanayakar temple. A pillar from the original temple stands under a decorated Vilvam (Aegle marmelos) tree on Swami Rock. In 1956, while scuba diving, photographer Mike Wilson and author Arthur C. Clarke discovered ruins from the sunken original temple spread on the shallow surrounding sea-bed. Relics found by Wilson and Clarke included masonry, architecture, idol images, carved columns with flower insignias, and stones in the form of elephant heads . These ruins, as well as the pillar on Swami Rock, display Tamil, Pallava, and Chola architectural influence of the 3rd‚Äì9th century era. Corroborated by the discovery of Pallava Grantha and Chola script inscriptions and Hindu images found in the premises, this suggests that the dynasties took a keen interest in the temple. Wilson and Clarke also retrieved the legendary Swayambhu lingam from the ocean floor. According to legend, this large natural stone obelisk was one of 69 naturally occurring lingams from time immemorial originally found on Mount Kailash of Tibet and housed in Koneswaram by King Raavan ‚Äì his most sacred power object from mythological times. This lingam was reinstalled at the Koneswaram site. Publishing their findings in the 1957 book The Reefs of Taprobane, Clarke expresses admiration for Swami rock's three thousand year veneration by Hindus. Identifying at least three Hindu temples as having been built on and around Swami rock, Clarke describes the tenth century A.D. Koneswaram idols as \\"among the finest examples of Hindu bronze sculpture known to exist\\", the seated Shiva Chola bronze \\"a masterpiece\\" and the battered stone work at the foot of Swami Rock as \\"probably the most photographed underwater ruins in the world.\\" 350 years after its destruction, Sri Lankan Tamil Hindu people of Trincomalee organised the temple restoration committee to restore the temple; the old images were reinstalled amid opening ceremonies in the newly restored shrine on 3 March 1963. Side entrance to the temple Some of the artefacts from the demolished temple, including De Sa de Noronha's translation of the prophecy sent to Portugal, are kept in the Ajuda Library of Lisbon (Bibliotheca da Ajuda), along with a painting and map of the original shrine. The chronicler Ant√≥nio Bocarro shows three monuments of the Trincomalee Koneswaram Temple Compounds on the extremity of the peninsula in his map of the Livro das plantas das fortalezas cidades e povoa√ßois do Estado da India Oriental document of 1635, but these temples are missing from the copy of the document stored at the Pa√ßo Ducal di Vila Vi√ßosa library in Lisbon. The stone inscription discovered by the temple's destroyer has a Double-Fish insignia and its engraved prophecy, translated from ancient Tamil script, warns of the \\"coming of the Franks\\" after the 16th century. The prediction reads \\"O King! The franks shall later break down the holy edifice built by Kulakoddan in ancient times; and no future kings of this island will rebuild it! Following the successive reigns of the cat eyed, the red eyed and the smoke eyed nations it will voluntarily revert to the Tamils.\\" Pandyan king Jatavarman Veera Pandyan's insignia of the old Koneswaram temple and a portion of the prophetic inscription are seen today at the door entrance to Fort Fredrick. Location and layout Location of one of the three Koneswaram temple monuments as Trincomalee was beginning to be fortified by European colonials in 1620. The fort visible is where a colossal monument of the Konesar temple stood on Konesar Malai (Swami Rock) before destruction in 1622; the final Pagoda monument was destroyed in 1624. Portuguese drawing/sketch published c. 1650. Trincomalee Koneswaram temple compounds The shrine was known to Europeans as the Pagoda of Trincomalee ‚Äì Temple of a Thousand Columns. The main shrine was built upon the jagati while its thousand pillared hall was the Aayiram Kaal Mandapam ‚Äì a distinctly thousand pillared platform close to the vimana of the koil that forms a distinct part of the site plan of classical Dravidian temple architecture. Ruins of this feature at Koneswaram indicate that the hall was a structural addition erected by Pallava artisans, dated between 537‚Äì668. It formed one of the nine prakara or major courtyard compounds of the Koneswaram complex. Two other temples were prominent compound monuments on the promontory, containing prolific gopura structures over the shrines built to Vishnu-Thirumal and the goddess Ambal-Shakti. Together, they became known as the Three Pagodas of Thirukonamalai. A site plan by De Quieroz states: \\"On the first rise to the summit of the rock was a Pagoda, another at mid-ascent, and the principal one of them all at the highest eminence, visited by a concourse of Hindus from the whole of India.\\" In his dispatch to Philip III, King of Portugal, Constantine described: \\"The land of the Pagoda is 600 fathoms long (1.2 km) and 80 feet at its broadest, narrowing to 30 feet.\\" The complex stretches across Konesar Road off the promontory, and includes shrines to Ganesh, Murukan and Bhadrakali. Koneswaram of Konesar Malai is located 152 kilometres (94.4 mi) directly east from Kudiramalai, the ancient royal district and southern pearl-bank emporium of the Thiru Ketheeswaram temple, Mannar. Koneswaram lies on a straight diagonal path connected to Ketheeswaram and another former Jaffna temple and Paadal Petra Sthalam Ramanathaswamy Temple, Rameswaram. This pilrimage path of 225 km (140 mi) is often traversed by foot according to Hindu custom. The complex also lies on exactly the same longitude as Mount Kailash. Deities of the complex In line with custom of Tamil Hindu temple compounds, the complex houses shrines to several deities. Koneswaram is the easternmost shrine of the 5 ancient Iswarams of Lord Shiva on the island, the others being Naguleswaram (Keerimalai), Thiruketheeswaram (Mannar), Munneswaram (Chilaw) and Tenavaram (Tevan Thurai). Koneswaram has attracted thousands of pilgrims from across Asia, its Shiva shrine mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata written from 400‚Äì100 B.C. describe at length its attraction to pilgrims from many countries and from 600‚Äî660, it has been glorified as one of 275 Shiva Sthalams, or holy Shiva dwellings on the continent in Tevaram. Swami Rock is heralded as a Shiva Upa Peetha (base) of Lanka in the Sivacharita, a Sanskrit work in praise of Shiva, and subsequent manuscripts of the Pithanirnaya (Maha Piitha Nirupana) as a general Sakta Peetha of Lanka with a temple of the compounds dedicated to the goddess Indraksi Devi and a male deity Raksasesvara ‚Äì a reference to Ravana. Kullakottan reconstructed the Three Pagodas of Thirukonamalai, the other two dedicated to Vishnu-Thirumal and that of the Mother-Goddess (Tirukkamakkottam ‚Äì a consort of Shiva) on the promontory over a far greater area than at present. This latter temple to the goddess ‚Äì Ambal/Uma/Shakti/Shankari Devi ‚Äì was one of the 18 Maha Shakthi Peethas, those Shakti Peethas consecrated to the goddess which are mentioned in the Ashta Dasa Shakthi Peetha Stotram by the Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara (788‚Äî820).D. C. Sircar. (1998). The Sakta Pithas. pp. 39, 41, 89The Astadasa (18) make separate mention of Lanka (Ceylon) and Simhala Dvipa ‚Äì the name of the Bhairava ‚Äì Raksasesvara ‚Äì strongly suggests Lanka is identical with Ceylon/Eela Nadu The Vishnu-Thirumal temple was likely the first temple encountered on the promontory ‚Äì and is mentioned in Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indi√´n written in 1726 by Fran√ßois Valentijn. The temple closest to the sea end was likely that dedicated to the goddess, where the current reconstructed Shiva temple stands. Smaller shrines within the complex to Ganesh, Durga, Murukan, Agastya, and the Navagraha including the sun god Surya would have been customary near the main shrine in the centre to Shiva ‚Äì the Murukan shrine is hailed at large in the Thiruppugazh series of Arunagirinathar. The temple to Bhadrakali is located further along in the complex inland along Konesar Road, benefitted from Rajendra Chola I. The Kali temple is mentioned in the book Birds of Prey (1997) by Wilbur Smith, set in the 1660s. The Thirukonasala Mahatyam, describing the origins of the world, Lanka and Koneswaram based on puranic legends is now lost. The historical literature Mattakallappu Manmiyam (Batticaloa Manmiyam) that chronicles the history of Tamil settlement in Batticaloa, follows the Dakshina Kailasa Puranam and Dakshina Kailasa Manmiam in describing Koneswaram as one of the nine most important and sacred sites in the world for all Hindus. Twentieth-century restored Koneswaram temple The statue of Lord Shiva was reconstructed in 2018. Festivals Coloured necklaces on sale at Koneswaram The Koneswaram temple is well known for its celebration of the traditional Ther chariot festival, the Navaratri and Sivarathri functions. The Ther Chariot Festival lasts for twenty two days in April and focuses on preparing the deities and the community for Puthandu, the Tamil New Year. Navaratri lasts for nine days and is dedicated to various aspects of the presiding goddess, whereas Sivarathri is dedicated to Siva. Devotees visit the temple to attend the daily pujas and make their offerings. Booths are erected outside for the sale of food, drink, brassware, pottery, cloth and holy images. These functions primarily attract Hindus to the temple. The main Thirukoneswaram Ther Thiruvilah Festival, the twenty-two-day annual chariot festival begins with the hoisting of the temple Nandi flag. This is followed by temple processions of Lord Konesar and his consort Mathumai Ambal, installed and pulled in an ornate chariot temple car while deities Pillayar and Murugan with his two consorts Valli and Theivayanai are taken ahead in two other decorated chariots. This is conducted throughout Trincomalee district, and follows Kulakottan's stone scriptures detailing how Hindus in Tamil villages like Sambaltivu, lands which historically belonged to the temple, are entitled to hold poojahs as their Upayam during the annual festival period. Until April 1624 the Koneswaram Ther Festival occurred around Puthandu in April annually with five chariots and this tradition was reintroduced in April 2003, three hundred and seventy nine years later. The water-cutting Theertham Thiruvilah festival (holy bath) takes place annually in the centuries-old Papanasachunai holy well (Papanasam Theertham) on Swami Rock during the Ther festival period. The deity and other holy artefacts are bathed in the water of the well in the complex's sacred precincts. Devotees are sprayed with the holy water following the Theertham. The Theppath Thiruvilah Boat Festival consists of Lord Konesar and goddess Mathumai Ambal taken in a boat around the temple from Swami Rock via the Back Bay Sea to the Dutch Bay Sea. Religious discourses and cultural items take place throughout the night before Puthandu at the Dutch Bay Sea beach. Thereafter the deities are taken to the temple early morning the next day on Puthandu by road through the Fort Frederick entrance. The Trincomalee Bhadrakali Amman Temple and other Hindu temples have held their water-cutting Theertham festivals in the Back Bay Sea (Theertha Kadatkarai) for several centuries. The Koneswaram Poongavanam Festival ‚Äì the Temple Garden Festival is held during this twenty-two-day festival period. An annual three-day procession follows Maha Sivarathri Day, observed every year since 1951 following the rediscovery of the bronze idols in 1950. Occurring in three stages, on each day of the festival, the images of the chief deity Konesar, the presiding consort goddess Mathumai Amman, Ganesh and Murugan are brought from Swami Rock to the entrance of Fort Fredrick in decorated Ther temple cars before being paraded through the whole Periyakadai of the Trincomalee town. The chariot cars are pulled by devotees through a decorated route while singing hymns. Devotees hold Poorna kumbham outside their houses along the route and worship as the procession moves. On the second day of the festival there is a procession to the Pathirakalai Ambal Temple where the images are kept for the evening. On the final day of the festival, the large chariots are pulled back to Koneswaram along a route through Trincomalee, accompanied by traditional Nadeswaram and Thavil musicians. Legends According to one Hindu legend, Shiva at Koneswaram was worshipped by Indra, king of the gods. King Ravana of the epic Ramayana and his mother are believed to have worshiped Lord Shiva in the sacred lingam form at Koneswaram circa 2000 B.C.; the cleft of Swami Rock is attributed to Ravana's great strength. According to this tradition, his father-in-law Maya built the Ketheeswaram temple in Mannar. Ravana is believed to have brought the swayambhu lingam in the temple to Koneswaram, one of sixty-nine such lingams he carried from Mount Kailash. Iconography of Ravana, the mythical king of Lanka depicted on the temple walls With the legend of the smiling infant, James Emerson Tennent describes \\"one of the most graceful\\" of the Tamil legends connected to the Temple of the Thousand Columns atop Swami Rock. An oracle had declared that over the dominions of one of the kings of the Deccan impended a great peril which could only be averted by the sacrifice of his infant daughter, who was committed to the sea on an ark of sandalwood, eventually reaching the island, south of Trincomalee at a place that in the mid 19th century was still called ‚Äô‚ÄôPƒÅlanakai‚Äô‚Äô (smiling infant), current Panagai. After being adopted by the king of the district, she succeeded over his dominions. Meanwhile, the Hindu prince Kullakottan, having ascertained from the Puranas that the rock of Trincomalee was the holy fragment Koneiswara parwatia of the golden mountain of Meru, hurled there during a conflict between gods, arrived at Swami Rock and constructed a temple of Shiva. The princess, hearing of his arrival, initially dispatched an army to expel him, but ended up marrying the prince to end the war, and later attached vast rice fields of Thampalakamam and built the great Kantalai tank to endow the temple and irrigate the surrounding plain. Upon her death, the prince shut himself inside the pagoda of Swami rock, and was later found translated into a golden lotus on the Shiva altar. The Dakshina Kailasa Manmiam, a chronicle on the history of the temple, notes that the Sage Agastya proceeded from Vetharaniam in South India to the Parameswara Shiva temple at Tirukarasai ‚Äì now in ruins ‚Äì on the bank of the Mavilli Kankai before worshipping at Koneswaram; from there he went to Maha Tuvaddapuri to worship Lord Ketheeswarar and finally settled down on the Podiya Hills. Ravana statue on East side (same side of Ravana's Cleft) of the Swami rock slope Dutch legends connected with the Hindu pillar from the ruins on Swami Rock concern an inscription found engraved on the re-erected monument dated to 1687. The inscription reads: \\"Tot gedaghtenis van Fran- cina van Reede, lofr. van Mydregt, dezen A¬∞ 1687 M April opgeregt\\", or in English : \\" This has been erected on the 24th April 1687 to commemorate Francina van Reede, Lady of the Manor of Mydrecht\\". The Dutch Governor of Ceylon Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff mentions the pillar in his diaries of 1738, visiting \\"Pagoodsberg\\" or \\"Pagoda Hill\\" on a trip from Jaffna to Trincomalee to meet Vanniar chiefs in the region. There he notes on his visit on 31 May, the \\"name of Francina van Reede, daughter of the late Commissaris Generaal van Reede was found cut on a shaft, with the year 1687, which shows that she too came as far as this. Nothing else worth mentioning...\\". The girl's father was Hendrik van Rheede, commander of Jaffna during Dutch Ceylon, and sailed from Trincomalee to Point Pedro on 23 April 1687. Historian Jonathan Forbes writing in 1810 in his book Eleven Years in Ceylon describes the pillar as a memorial to Francina's suicide, having flung herself off the edge of the cliff into the sea having seen her lover, a young Dutch officer to whom she was betrothed, sail away to Holland. Some historians describe this story as a conflation with practices that Queyroz claimed occurred with pilgrims at the site as idol worshiping sailors venerated the site from the sea. Historical records from closer to the period indicate Francina van Reede remarried in 1694. Writers describe the intentions of the person who re-erected the old Hindu pillar and carved the inscription on it as being to commemorate Francina having climbed the crag to wave goodbye to her father as he sailed past, and a token of human affection. Ravana's Cleft is also known as Lover's Leap in reference to this legend. Another tradition holds that during his rule in 113 A.D., King Gajabahu I marched from his southern strongholds to the Konesar Kovil with the intention of demolishing it and converting it to a Buddhist temple. When nearing the Kantalai tank, he is believed to have been miraculously cured of his blindness by a Hindu, and henceforth converted to Hinduism. The tank is said to be named on this account Kandalai meaning \\"eye grows\\" in Tamil. Dispute with Gokanna Vihara A temple dedicated to a deity in \\"Gokarna\\" city is mentioned in a fifth-century A.D. religious and historical literary work called Mahavamsa. It mentions that Mahasena (334‚Äì361) a Mahayanist zealot known for his temple destructions, who ruled a central kingdom of the island from the southern city of Anuradhapura destroyed temples dedicated to a deity in Gokarna and built Buddhist Viharas in its place. A twelfth-century commentary on Mahavamsa indicates that the destroyed deity temple had a lingam ‚Äì a form of Shiva in it. The interpretation of deity temples into specifically a Siva temple by the commentary on Mahavamsa is disputed by Sinhalese writers such as Bandu De Silva. Sri Lanka has had a history of conflict between its minority Hindu Tamils and majority Sinhalese Buddhists since its political independence from Great Britain in 1948 which led to the Sri Lankan Civil War. Since the 1950s Sinhalese Buddhists have claimed that the Tirukoneswaram temple was originally exclusively a Buddhist temple. They cite and interpret historical information of three Pagodas at the Koneswaram site as alluding to Buddhist temples. Buddhists have also claimed that the site was the location of the ancient Gokanna Vihara built by King Mahasena. It was also based on an assertion made by historian Senarath Paranavithana in reading a 13th-century Sanskrit donative inscription in Grantha Tamil script made by a Chodaganga Deva found in the Hindu temple's premises. The inscription reads that Deva landed in Gokaranna in 1223. Many evidence, archaeological and otherwise, support the claim the Buddhist Vihara existed at the site. Other sources indicate that the complex may have had Hindu and Buddhist sections prior to its destruction. During the 1958 riots, Tamils cut down bo trees near the temple to fabricate that it was not a Buddhist entity. In 1968, the unity government of majority Sinhalese dominated United National Party and the minority Tamil dominated Federal Party collapsed over disagreements about declaring the holy Hindu site a protected area. A committee appointed by a Federal Party Minister to study the viability of declaring the site protected was disbanded without consultation by the Prime Minister at the time, Dudley Senanayake, after receiving a letter of complaint from a prominent Buddhist monk who objected because the temple area would \\"get into the hands\\" of those \\"who are neither Sinhalese or Buddhist\\". The Federal Party withdrew its support to the government following that action. According to journalists like T. Sabaratnam, this incident had negative repercussions towards the future co- operation between Tamil and Sinhalese communities. The temple and its environs are currently occupied by the Sri Lankan Army, which maintains a base at Fort Frederick. On 21 September 2008, the chief priest of the temple Sivashri Kugarajakurrukal was assassinated in a campaign that has targeted Hindu priests in the region.

Goals The team had three objectives:Policing the Past, Our Role * To work with families of those who had been killed. * To ensure that cases were conducted to modern policing standards, and * To carry out the work in such a way that the wider community had confidence in the outcomes. Working with families was at the heart of the HET objectives, with a family liaison process in place, and the HET undertaking to provide each affected family with a copy of the relevant report. It was headed by Commander David Cox, formerly of the London Metropolitan Police, and consisted of a team of 100 investigators and supporting staff, and a budget of ¬£30 million. HET was split into two distinct teams: Review and Investigation. The Review team was staffed by police officers employed and seconded from outside Northern Ireland, while the Investigation team has been recruited locally. The team aimed to fulfil its mandate by 2011. However, the investigators - along with the Police Ombudsman - agreed that they would require further time to work through the outstanding cases. Cases were generally handles in chronological order. On 29 January 2008, it was announced that the Team would reopen files on 124 deaths resulting from fatal shootings by British Army soldiers between 1970 and 1973. At that time, under an agreement between the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), military witnesses to deaths were often initially interviewed by the Royal Military Police instead of the RUC. Doubts had since been raised about the independence and effectiveness of these investigations. In February 2008 it was confirmed in the House of Commons that the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) was to examine all deaths attributed to The Troubles from January 1969 to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, equating to 3,268 deaths which occurred in 2,516 incidents, or 'cases'. At that time 1,039 cases had been allocated to the HET business process, and the team had a total of 175 staff. Major reforms to the structure and resourcing of PSNI announced in September 2014 meant the closure of the Historical Enquiries Team, to be replaced by 'a much smaller unit' within PSNI. Findings The HET has investigated several of the most controversial killings during the Troubles, including the killing of Terry Herdman (17) in 1973, who had friends in the IRA and was accused of being an informer. He was hence killed by the IRA as they regarded him as a \\"liability\\"; the HET reported that Herdman did not knowingly betray IRA secrets to the Army or the police. Woman who fought for 37 years to get to truth of an IRA murder The Historical Enquiries Team (HET) report on the 1975 Miami Showband killings, an ambush on civilians travelling in a minibus, confirmed Mid-Ulster UVF leader Robin \\"Jackal\\" Jackson's involvement and identified him as an RUC Special Branch agent. The HET said the killings raised \\"disturbing questions about collusive and corrupt behaviour\\" between loyalist paramilitaries and British state forces. The HET report on the 1976 Kingsmill massacre, an ambush on civilians travelling in a minibus, stated that the organization that carried out the act, the South Armagh Republican Action Force (SARAF), included members of the Provisional IRA despite that organization being on a ceasefire. The HET report said that the 10 all male victims of the massacre, 4 of which belonged to the Orange Order,\\"In Memory\\" , Armagh County Grand Orange Lodge website. were targeted because they were from the Protestant community, and that their murder was a sectarian response to the shooting of 7 Catholics in the Reavey and O'Dowd killings that occurred the night before but that it was planned before that event. This is in line with the contemporary statement issued by the spokesman for SARAF. In the fatal shooting of Aidan McAnespie on 21 February 1988, the British Army soldier claimed that his hands were wet, causing him to inadvertently fire his machine gun when he was moving inside a sanger. The report called this the \\"least likely version\\" of what happened. Damien Walsh (17) was murdered while working at a coal supply business in Twinbrook in 1993. The HET reported that undercover British soldiers were watching as UFF loyalists murdered the Catholic teenager but were too far away to intervene. William McGreanery (41) was shot by a British soldier in Derry in 1971 when he was walking past an observation point. An investigation by the HET into Mr MrGreanery's death found that he was not carrying a firearm and he posed no threat to the soldiers, despite earlier claims that he was. Majella O'Hare (12) from Whitecross was on her way to confession on August 14, 1976, when she was hit in the back by a bullet. A HET report backed an earlier RUC investigation which found that the British soldier who shot her was not returning fire, as he had claimed. A HET report into the loyalist murders of three brothers from south Armagh in 1976 exonerated them and their family of any links to paramilitarism. The brothers - John Martin, Brian and Anthony Reavey who were all Catholic - were shot dead by six masked men who burst into their home in Whitecross in January 1976. In the Sean Graham bookmakers' shooting, five Catholic civilians were killed in a mass shooting perpetrated by the UDA, who opened fire on the bookmakers' shop on Ormeau Road in 1992. The HET report confirmed one of the guns used by the UDA gang had previously been returned to them by RUC officers.Bookies' massacre gun 'given by RUC' Inspectorate of Constabulary report A 2013 report into the HET by the UK's Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary found that the HET was not reviewing all of the historical cases within its remit in a consistent manner, and that some cases involving deaths caused by members of the police and military (which the report called 'state involvement cases') were 'being reviewed with less rigour in some areas' than non-state cases.

Early life Philip Crosthwaite was born 1825, in Athy, County Kildare, Ireland, to Edward and Rachel Crosthwaite. His parents were visiting their old home, having emigrated to the United States some years before. On returning to America, Philip was left in the care of his grandparents in Ireland and lived with them until 16, when he visited his mother. In 1843, he returned to Ireland to complete his education, and entered Trinity College, Dublin. When his grandmother died in 1845 and he came to America for a second visit, intending to return and complete his education. But while in Philadelphia, he met a young man from Boston with whom he struck up an acquaintance, and for a \\"lark\\" these two determined to take a short sea voyage. Going to Newport, Rhode Island, they shipped on board the schooner Hopewell, thinking they were on a fishing trip to the Newfoundland banks. Too late, they learned the ship was bound for San Francisco, Alta California (then a Mexican territory). They begged so hard to be put ashore that the captain finally promised to allow them to return by the first ship they met; but they never met a ship until they reached San Diego Bay. Crosthwaite and his friend, Rhead, jumped ship in San Diego. An east-bound ship came, but there was room for only one. They tossed for the berth and Crosthwaite lost, so he remained in San Diego. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in San Diego In 1846, when the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War broke out, Crosthwaite was on an otter hunting expedition on the Baja California coast, with Julian Ames, John Post, John C. Stewart, and William Curley. Learning of the war at the Misi√≥n Nuestra Se√±ora del Sant√≠simo Rosarito de Vi√±acado near El Rosario, Baja California, they all returned to San Diego and served in the Battle of San Pasqual. They reached the town late at night, and were wakened by a loud knock on the door early in the morning. It was Captain Gillespie, who said: \\"There can be no neutrals in this country; you must either enlist for three months (as the war will probably be over by that time), or be imprisoned on the Congress.\\" He intended to enlist, anyway, but the choice was made easy. A good deal of the local color concerning the Battle of San Pasqual came from Crosthwaite's accounts, as he served from start to finish. He was slightly wounded by Pico's rangers in the slaughter of December 6. After the troops left for the capture of Los Angeles, he performed garrison duty until the close of the war. San Diego under U.S. rule In 1847 Crosthwaite was appointed Suplente (Substitute Justice of the Peace or Mayor) of San Diego Pueblo. Crosthwaite married Mar√≠a Josefa L√≥pez, daughter of Bonifacio L√≥pez, of San Diego in Ensenada, Baja California, on June 10, 1848, 1 month after independence from Mexico, at San Diego. L√≥pez was a great- great-granddaughter of Basilio Rosas, one of 11 families who settled Los Angeles in 1781. Crosthwaite and L√≥pez had seven sons and three daughters, including Francisco, Felipe, Eduardo, Marcos, Santiago, Carlos, Lizzie, Guillermo. His daughter Mary married J. N. Brise√±o, of San Diego. His daughter Josefa married Julio Osuna, the grandson of Juan Mar√≠a Osuna, the first Alcalde of San Diego and grantee of Rancho San Dieguito (now Rancho Santa Fe). Most of the family remained in Baja California after the purchase of Rancho San Miguel in 1861 when the cattle were herded south from Rancho Paguay (Poway) in San Diego County. Many of the descendants of Crosthwaite still live in Playas de Rosarito, where some use the surname spelled as \\"Croswaithe\\". Jorge Croswaithe is now president of the Red Cross and Rafael Croswaithe was a candidate for the local government in the 2007 Baja California state elections. Many other family members are scattered between Baja California, in Mexico, and Southern California in the United States. Writer Luis Humberto Crosthwaite lives in Tijuana. During the California Gold Rush in 1849, Crosthwaite went north briefly to mine gold. He didn't get rich, but did bring back 47 ounces (1,350 grams) of gold. In 1851, Crosthwaite served in the Garra Insurrection, with the rank of third sergeant. After these troubles, he was the mainstay of the citizens in preserving the peace, at the time when a gang was terrorizing the town, and was seriously wounded. Crosthwaite held a number of offices at an early day, being the first county treasurer (1850), deputy sheriff several years, and sheriff one or two terms. He was also school commissioner in 1850, county clerk and recorder in 1853‚Äì54, and justice of the peace in 1854. He lived for several years in Mission Valley, above Old Town, and later owned Rancho San Miguel in Baja California. He was lessee of the Mission San Diego de Alcal√° in 1848, and later joined the gold rush. He also kept a store in Old Town, and later in new San Diego, in partnership with Thomas Whaley. His old ledger, kept in 1853, later owned by Joseph Jessop, shows many curious things. The first entry in it shows the sale of over $200 worth of provisions to Lieutenant Derby, for the use of the Indians working on the San Diego River dam. The prices charged are also very interesting, now. Ranch and city life Crosthwaite purchased Rancho San Miguel, near Ensenada, Baja California, in 1861 and moved there, but still spent much of his time in San Diego. He was an active in the San Diego Lodge of the Freemasons. Crosthwaite visited his sister in San Andreas, California, where her husband William Jeff Gatewood was publishing the San Andreas Register. Crosthwaite suggested that Gatewood move the paper to San Diego, which didn't have a newspaper then. He did and the first issue of San Diego Union was issued October 10, 1868. Crosthwaite was appointed Chief of Police in San Diego in 1869. The same year, he partnered with Thomas Whaley to run a store in Old Town. Death Crosthwaite died 1903 in San Diego. He is buried in an unmarked plot in the Masonic section of Mount Hope Cemetery, but it was since marked by the Masons in 1968. He had almost fifty grandchildren at the time of his death. Character and personality Crosthwaite was a well-built man, with a full beard and a remarkably deep voice. An uncle-in-law, Mr. Hempstead, stopped off at La Playa (between Old Town and Point Loma) on his way to San Francisco in the 1850s, and recognized him by his voice, although he hadn't seen him for years. He was known to be a fearless man, whose courage was proved in many hard encounters. He was a man of strong character and had enemies as well as friends. Part of these troubles were due to religious differences, he being an Episcopalian and his wife a Catholic. He was fond of telling his recollections of early days, often in a joking manner.

History=Previous club A previous club called Sutton Town existed until 1997. They played in the Northern Counties East League. They also spent time in the Midland Football League and the Northern Premier League. They were regular competitors in the Nottinghamshire Senior Cup. They still hold the joint record for most cup wins, along with Nottingham Forest. They were based at Priestsic Road in Sutton-in-Ashfield. Following the loss of the ground for the building of a supermarket, they moved to Lowmoor Road in the neighbouring town of Kirkby-in- Ashfield. They changed their name to Ashfield United because of a sponsorship deal with Ashfield District Council, however the club folded in 1997. This club was also nicknamed The Snipes. Another now defunct club (1996), Oakham United, based close to the King's Mill Hospital on the boundary between Sutton and Mansfield, applied to change their name to Sutton Town when the previous club became defunct but were denied permission by the Nottinghamshire FA. 2007 club This incarnation of the club was formed in August 2007, to replace an older club, previously known as North Notts F.C., who disbanded. In 2013 they were promoted to the East Midlands Counties League as champions of the Central Midlands League South Division. In June 2014 the club resigned from the league after they were unable to come to a suitable agreement over a lease at home ground The Fieldings that would enable them to be promoted in the future, which is a league requirement. They now had the option of trying to join another league which would allow them to continue at the same ground, but the problem remained that the Snipes would not be eligible for promotion under the terms of their current lease.

On February 19, 1955, the 40-passenger Martin 4-0-4 prop plane used by TWA for that route crashed into the Sandia Mountains. Its deviation from the normal flight path, initially believed to be the result of pilot error, was revised to \\"unknown\\" given that the contribution of other factors could not be definitively ruled out.  History  On February 19, 1955 at 7:03 am, TWA flight 260 en route from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Santa Fe, New Mexico received an IFR clearance from the Albuquerque tower (\\"ATC clears TWA 260 for approach at the Santa Fe Airport via Victor 19 climb northbound on the back course of the ILS localizer\\"). There were no further communications after the aircraft took off at 7:05. It was last seen in a high-speed shallow climb toward the cloud- shrouded Sandia Crest at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet above ground level. At 7:13 the flight crashed into Sandia Mountain killing all 13 passengers and three crew members on board instantly. Due to the complex mountainous terrain, several members of the New Mexico Mountain Club, along with other volunteers, assisted the New Mexico State Police in the recovery efforts. This later led to the formation of the Albuquerque Mountain Rescue Council, a volunteer organization still active today. Wreckage from the craft still remains, and can still be seen on brightly lit days by riders on the Sandia Peak Tramway, a popular tourist attraction active since 1966. The location is locally referred to as \\"TWA Canyon\\". The initial Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) Accident Investigation Report was released on October 12, 1955.Serling, Robert J. The probable cause: the truth about air travel today. Doubleday, 1960. Reprint. New York, Ballantine Books, 3rd printing, June 1964; Chapter 6, \\"Accident at Albuquerque\\", pg 140. Originally the cause was believed to be that the pilots were ‚Äúintentionally flying the plane into the mountain‚Äù. This initial CAB \\"probable cause\\" adopted a widespread rumor: it implied a \\"suicide pact\\" between the two airline pilots.Serling 1964, p. 141, 147 (a reprint of the letter from Jean Spong, the Captain's widow). An amended accident report (second version) was released by CAB on August 26, 1957, which deleted the word \\"intentional\\".Serling 1964, p.145. After much effort by Captain Larry DeCelles, working cooperatively with the CAB's investigators to understand pilot reports about latent faults in a fluxgate compass appearing only after extended intervals with turn bank-angle, the CAB finally issued its third version of the report on June 15, 1960: the probable cause was changed to ‚Äúdeviation from the prescribed flight path for reasons unknown‚Äù given that malfunction of the fluxgate compass as a contributing factor could not be entirely ruled out.Serling 1964, p. 164. Pilots had complained of that particular aircraft's radio-magnetic indicator (RMI) malfunctioning under certain operational circumstances, but maintenance personnel had been unable to duplicate the complaint on the ground and returned the aircraft to service. After the fatal flight, the captain, Ivan Spong, and co-pilot, James Creason, were primarily blamed for navigational malfeasance by the CAB, resulting in many instances of Captain Spong's widow receiving \\"death-threat\\" phone calls, presumably from victims' surviving relatives or friends. On May 14 members of the New Mexico Mountain Club who had participated in the initial recovery effort returned to the site to recover and bury any human remains left at the site before the summer climbing season. They collected over 150 pounds of remains and also recovered a Fluxgate compass from the remains of the left wing tip where it had been left by the impact.The crash of TWA Flight 260, by Charles M. Williams, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 2010, , pg 67 Because of a design wiring defect both the pilots and copilots RMI gauges were driven by the same Fluxgate compass which was the one recovered. As a result, there was no opportunity for either pilot to be aware of the erroneous data displayed on their RMIs. While \\"in order to accept the theory offered, the Board must conclude that both crew members were completely oblivious to all these [countervailing] indications, that their attention was focused entirely on the RMI, and that they did not cross-check any other flight instruments\\", this evidence convinced the CAB to amend the accident report to include instrument error as a possible contributing factor.Civil Aeronautics Board. Supplemental Aircraft Accident Report. Adopted June 9, 1960, released June 15, 1960. Docket No. SA-303. File No. 1-0063. http://dotlibrary.specialcollection.net/Document?db=DOT- AIRPLANEACCIDENTS&query;=%28select+609%29. Pages 1-2. The CAB's third version of their Accident Report discussed their willingness to work cooperatively with experts from the airline and the pilots' association toward revising its previous report.

It is located at 31¬∫54'S 116¬∫04'E, on the northern side of Great Eastern Highway, near the border between the suburbs of Swan View and Greenmount. Chippers Leap is named for John Chipper,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chipper-donald- john-5584http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1469754?q=john+chipper&c;=people who jumped from the rock on 3 February 1832 while trying to escape an attack by a party of Noongars. Chipper and an 11-year-old boy named Reuben Beacham had been driving Mr Leroux's cart from Guildford to his property in York via the York Road, Western AustraliaYork Road (now Old York Road) when they were attacked by Noongars. Chipper was speared once in the side before turning around to escape. A second spear pierced his shoulder as he jumped from the rock in order to save himself. Chipper, in his statement dated 5 February 1832, states \\"I heard him scream out, and I looked back, but did notice him; but perceiving a number of the natives gaining ground upon me, I turned short round the shoulder of the same hill, and ran off at my utmost speed\\". Chipper ran for approximately 4 miles before eventually reaching Governor James Stirling's house at Woodbridge. In the early 1930s the Main Roads Board planned a realignment of the York Road that ultimately resulted in the construction of the present Great Eastern Highway. The original plans had the road passing through Chippers Leap. After representations by the Western Australian Historical Society, the plans were changed to allow the road to pass close by the rock, thus not only preserving the rock but also increasing its visual effect and exposure. The road itself was not constructed until the 1960s. Chippers leap in 2012 The plaque at Chippers Leap At 8:30pm on 3 February 1932, the centenary of Chipper's leap, the Western Australian Historical Society dedicated a plaque in memory of the event. Around 200 people attended a dedication ceremony at the rock. The plaque reads: > ON THE 3RD OF FEBRUARY 1832.

Plaque, Chippers Leap. NOTE: Reuben Beacham was not 14 years of age. Reuben was born in Barnham Sussex and baptised on 20 September 1820, making him 11 and a half years old. For most of the 1960s through to the 1980s the rock face just west of the plaque featured an item of graffiti in white paint, reading \\"All have sinned\\" Towards the end of the 1990s it was replaced for a short time by \\"Please Turn Over\\". For at least the last ten years now it has been painted out and graffiti free. The plaque is adjacent to a very busy highway with no facilities for pedestrians, so it is not recommended as a stopping place at any time of day or night. A small section of parking area on the highway is available 100 metres to the west, just before a new sign \\"Perth Hills\\".

He is the second highest ever goal scorer in the history of the League of Ireland. Club career=Bray Wanderers Byrne scored in his first competitive game for Bray Wanderers coming on as a substitute in a League of Ireland Cup game on 16 August 1998. He made his League of Ireland debut on the opening day of the 1998‚Äì99 League of Ireland Premier Division season on 30 August. Byrne scored his first league goal against Shamrock Rovers on 4 September 1998. His exploits earned him the Player of the Month award for his first month in senior football. That season, he scored 7 goals from 15 appearances. Over the next 4 seasons, Byrne increased his reputation as a striker that struck fear into the heart of opposition defences, scoring 49 league goals in 128 league appearances. Despite breaking his ankle in November 1998, he recovered to score twice in the 1999 FAI Cup replay win. The 2001‚Äì02 season at Bray saw his most successful goals return, netting 14 league goals during the course of the season. Shelbourne On 12 January 2003, he signed for Shelbourne for a reported ‚Ç¨75,000, scoring twice on his league debut against Waterford United in April. He made an immediate impact, scoring 21 league goals in his first season, and helping Shelbourne to the summit of the league table. He was named PFAI Player of the Year for his efforts. 2004 saw him pick up where he left off, forging a good partnership with new signing Glen Fitzpatrick, and firing home 25 times in 33 league games, again helping Shelbourne to the league title. 2005 saw him hit 30 goals across all competitions, including 5 in the Champions League qualifiers and 22 in the league, and once again scoop the PFAI Player of the Year Award. During this time he courted the attention of foreign clubs, such as Brighton & Hove Albion and the Swedish champions Djurg√•rdens IF. It was widely assumed he would join Djurg√•rdens, however, the clubs could not agree a fee. The Swedes offered in the region of ‚Ç¨400,000, a record for a League of Ireland player. This was turned down because, reportedly, as much as 50% would have gone to his previous club, Bray Wanderers. Byrne was a key player for Shels in the title winning 2006 season, topping the scoring charts again with 15 goals in 26 league appearances, including a crucial last-minute winner against Derry City. This brought his tally of goals to 83 in 122 league appearances for the Reds. In the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup he missed a penalty at Odense BK and was yellow carded which meant he missed the return leg. Byrne scored his 100th goal for Shelbourne in a League of Ireland Cup game against Finn Harps during the 2006 season. Cardiff City Following the break-up of the Shelbourne team due to tax irregularities, which saw the club demoted to the League of Ireland First Division, Byrne signed for Cardiff City for a fee of ¬£75,000 on 17 January 2007, and scored on his debut against Wolves, after coming on as a 62nd-minute substitute. He made several appearances for Cardiff, alongside Michael Chopra, toward the end of the season as their promotion push stalled and they found themselves struggling to maintain form. During the summer it was widely reported that Cardiff had cancelled his contract, even being confirmed by Sky Sports that he had left the club, however this was soon revealed to be false. At the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season he found his first team chances to be limited due to the arrivals of Robbie Fowler, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Steve MacLean and found himself in the reserve side, where he was the leading scorer by January. Bohemians After being linked with the move for some time, he rejoined his former manager Pat Fenlon and signed for Bohemians on 8 January 2008 on a free transfer, signing a three-year deal. Byrne made his debut for Bohs as a substitute against St Patrick's Athletic on 14 March 2008, and scored his first goal for the club from the penalty spot against Finn Harps on 28 March 2008. He scored twice in two wins over Rhyl F.C. in the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Byrne wrote himself into Bohemian folklore by scoring the goals that clinched the 2008 title against Drogheda United on 10 October. On his first start of the 2009 season, Byrne netted a brace as Bohs beat arch- rivals Shamrock Rovers 2‚Äì0 on 20 March. He continued this good form throughout the season as Bohs won their second league title in a row, with Byrne netting 22 times in the league. This included an incredible 4 goals against Dundalk on 1 May. Byrne had an injury-hit 2010 campaign as he struggled for fitness and form. Despite a good run towards the end of the season where he scored an important winner against big rivals Shamrock Rovers, Byrne and Bohs just came up short losing the league title on goal difference. Due to the Gypsies' financial difficulties, he was released from the club when his contract expired at the culmination of the 2010 season. Dundalk On 4 December 2010, Byrne signed for Dundalk along with fellow Bohemians teammate Mark Quigley on a one-year deal. Return to Bray Wanderers On 24 January 2012, Byrne rejoined Bray Wanderers on a one-year deal. He returned to the club where he began his career, after a nine-year absence. On 30 March, he equalled Pat Morley's record of 182 League of Ireland goals. On 13 April, Byrne became the second highest goalscorer in the history of the League. For his exploits in May 2012 he was awarded the Airtricity/SWAI Player of the Month. On 8 June 2013, Byrne scored four goals at UCD to become the second player to score more than 200 League of Ireland goals. He also became Bray's leading all-time League goalscorer Later career On 6 January 2014, Byrne rejoined Bohemians. Limited game time in the 2015 season saw Byrne drop a division to join First Division side UCD where he spent one year. In January 2017, Byrne joined First Division side Cabinteely. On the final day of the season, coming on as a substitute, he scored a consolation goal in the 90th minute against Shelbourne to make it 3-1. He departed Cabinteely at the end of the 2017 season to bring to an end his League of Ireland career. A career which saw him score 222 league goals leaving him as the second highest ever goal scorer in league history, just 13 goals behind Brendan Bradley's record of 235. International career Byrne's form won him a call up to the Ireland team for a friendly against Poland in April 2004. The manager at the time, Brian Kerr, opted only to bring him on for the final few seconds. This move was not appreciated by Shelbourne supporters, who already had a strong dislike for Kerr due to his association with their rivals St Patrick's Athletic. Despite a relatively poor start to the 2006 season, Byrne was called up to the Ireland squad to face Chile on 24 May 2006 by Brian Kerr's successor, Steve Staunton. The game was a disappointing one for Ireland as they were defeated 1‚Äì0 at home. Byrne, unlike his previous international encounter, earned a reasonable amount of time on the park as he played the final 20 minutes of the game, setting up several gilt-edged opportunities for his teammates. Byrne was again called up to the Ireland squad by Staunton in 2006, for a friendly against the Netherlands, but was unable to take his place in the squad due to injury. Personal life Byrne is married with two children. He is the first cousin of all time Ireland leading goalscorer Robbie Keane.

The purpose of employee raiding is usually to gain access to unique or rare knowledge or skills which the employee may possess. Taking the employee gives the raider an unfair competitive advantage. Ethical and legal dilemmas over employee raiding arise from the conflict of interests between an employee's right to free access to the labour market, and an employer's right to protect knowledge and skills which it regards as company property. Employers may attempt to protect themselves against the most damaging effects of employee raiding by inserting non-compete clauses into employment contracts. With increasing competition between companies sharing the same field of business, there have been non-disclosure forms for employees to sign, preventing employee raiding. The extreme difficulty in verifying this is a major example of how it poses a threat to all companies.

Some courts refer to these as \\"restrictive covenants\\". As a contract provision, a CNC is bound by traditional contract requirements including the consideration doctrine. The use of such clauses is premised on the possibility that upon their termination or resignation, an employee might begin working for a competitor or start a business, and gain competitive advantage by exploiting confidential information about their former employer's operations or trade secrets, or sensitive information such as customer/client lists, business practices, upcoming products, and marketing plans. However, an over-broad CNC may prevent an employee from working elsewhere at all. English common law originally held any such constraint to be unenforceable under the public policy doctrine.Alger, 36 Mass. at 52 (1837). Contemporary case law permits exceptions, but generally will only enforce CNCs to the extent necessary to protect the employer. Most jurisdictions in which such contracts have been examined by the courts have deemed CNCs to be legally binding so long as the clause contains reasonable limitations as to the geographical area and time period in which an employee of a company may not compete. The extent to which non-compete clauses are legally allowed varies per jurisdiction. For example, the state of California in the United States invalidates non-compete-clauses for all but equity stakeholders in the sale of business interests.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß¬ß 16600, 16601 History As far back as Dyer's Case in 1414, English common law chose not to enforce non-compete agreements because of their nature as restraints on trade. That ban remained unchanged until 1621, when a restriction that was limited to a specific geographic location was found to be an enforceable exception to the previously absolute rule. Almost a hundred years later, the exception became the rule with the 1711 watershed case of Mitchel v ReynoldsMitchel v. Reynolds, 24 Eng. Rep. 347 (Q.B. 1711) which established the modern framework for the analysis of the enforceability of non-compete agreements.C. L. Fisk, Working Knowledge: Trade Secrets, Restrictive Covenants in Employment, and the Rise of Corporate Intellectual Property, 1800-1920, 52 Hastings Law Journal no. 2, 453-54 (2001); see also Alger, 36 Mass. at 53. Canada Canadian courts will enforce non-competition and non-solicitation agreements, however, the agreement must be limited in time frame, business scope, and geographic scope to what is reasonably required to protect the company's proprietary rights, such as confidential marketing information or client relationshttp://www.cba.org/abc/nouvelles/pdf/ADD-enforceability.pdf and the scope of the agreement must be unambiguously defined. The 2009 Supreme Court of Canada case Shafron v. KRG Insurance Brokers (Western) Inc. 2009 SCC 6, held a non-compete agreement to be invalid due to the term \\"Metropolitan City of Vancouver\\" not being legally defined. The 2000 Ontario Court of Appeals case Lyons v. Multary established a general preference towards non- solicitation over non-competition agreements, regarding the latter as \\"much more drastic weapons\\" and held a non-competition agreement to be invalid when a non-solicitation agreement would have been sufficient to protect the company's interests. China=Applicable personnel For an employee who has the obligation to protect the employer‚Äôs confidentiality and trade secrets, the employer and the employee may agree on the inclusion of non- competition clauses in the employment contract or a separate non-disclosure agreement. In the event that the employment contract has been terminated or has expired, during the agreed non-competition period, the employer shall pay compensation to the employee on a monthly basis. If the employee breaches the non-competition agreement, he/she shall pay damages to the employer as agreed. The personnel subject to non-competition agreement shall be limited to the employer‚Äôs senior management, senior technicians and other personnel with a confidentiality obligation. The scope, area and term of the non-competition agreement shall be agreed by both the employer and the employee, and such agreement must not violate the laws and regulations. Rights and obligations Upon termination or expiration of the employment contract, the term of non-competition for any of the persons as mentioned in the preceding clause to work in any other employer producing or engaging in products of the same category or engaging in business of the same category as this employer shall not exceed two years. If the parties have reached an agreement on non- competition and compensation, unless another agreement is in place, the employer is entitled to ask the employee to comply with the non-competition obligations when the employment contract is ended, and the People‚Äôs Court shall support this request. The employee, after complying with the non- competition obligations, is entitled to request the agreed compensation from the employer, and the People‚Äôs Court shall support this request. If during the period of non-competition, the employer asks to terminate the non-competition agreement, the People‚Äôs Court shall support said petition. When terminating the non-competition agreement, if the employee requests the employer to pay an extra 3-month non-competition compensation, the People‚Äôs Court shall support said request. Compensation When the non-competition obligation has been agreed, but the compensation for the duration after the termination or expiration of the employment contract has not been determined, if the employee has performed the non-competition obligations, and requests the monthly compensation which is equal to 30% of his/her average monthly salary of the twelve months previous to the termination or expiration of the employment contract, the People‚Äôs Court shall support said request. If the 30% average monthly salary of the twelve months previous to the termination or expiration of the employment contract as mentioned in the preceding clause is lower than the minimum wage of the region where the employment contract is performed, the employer shall pay according to the minimum wage. Consequence of breaching an agreement When an employee violates this Law to terminate the employment contract, or violates the stipulations of the employment contract about the confidentiality obligation or non-competition and any loss is caused to the employer, the employee shall be liable for damage compensation. If an employer and an employee have agreed upon both a non-competition agreement and compensation in the employment contract or confidentiality agreement, and if after the termination or expiration of the employment contract, the employer has not paid said compensation for three months due to its own reasons and the employee requests termination of the non-competition agreement, the People‚Äôs Court shall support such request. After an employee violates the non- competition agreement and pays liquidated damages to the employer, if the employer requests the employee to continue to perform non-competition obligations as agreed, the People‚Äôs Court shall support such request. Europe Generally, CNCs are allowed in Europe only if the employer can show a reasonable business interest in having a CNC.  Belgium  In Belgium, CNCs are restricted to new employments within Belgium and for no more than one year. The employer must pay financial compensation for the duration of the CNC, amounting at least half of the gross salary for the corresponding period.Clause de non-concurrence ‚Äì conditions de validit√©. DroitBelge.net.  France  In France, CNCs must be limited in time to a maximum of two years and to a region where the employee‚Äôs new work can reasonably be seen as competitive. The region can be a city or the whole country, depending on the circumstances. The employer must pay financial compensation, typically 30 percent of the previous salary.Qu'est-ce qu'une clause de non-concurrence ?. Service-Public.fr A CNC may not unreasonably limit the possibilities of the employee to find a new employment.  Germany  In Germany, CNCs are allowed for a term up to two years. The employer must provide financial compensation for the duration of the CNC amounting to at least half the gross salary.German law, ¬ß74 HBS, abs. 2 Unreasonable clauses ‚Äì for example, excluding similar jobs throughout the whole of Germany ‚Äì can be invalidated.  Italy  In Italy, CNCs are regulated by articles 2125, 2596, and 1751 bis of the civil code.  Netherlands  In the Netherlands, non-compete clauses (non-concurrentiebeding or concurrentiebeding) are allowed regarding issues such as moving to a new employer and approaching customers of the old company. Unreasonable clauses can be invalidated in court.  Portugal  In Portugal, CNCs are regulated by article 136 of the labor code and restricted to two years extendible to three years in cases of access to particularly sensitive information. The employer must pay financial compensation for the duration of the CNC but the law doesn‚Äôt specify anything regarding the amount of the compensation.Portuguese labour code, Article 136  Romania  In Romania, CNCs are regulated by articles 21-24 of the labor code and restricted to two years. The employer must pay financial compensation for the duration of the CNC, amounting to at least 50 percent of the last 6 months salary.  Spain  In Spain, CNCs are regulated by article 21 of the labor law. CNCs are allowed up to two years for technical professions and six months for other professions.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, CNCs are called restraint of trade clauses, and may be used only if the employer can prove a legitimate business interest to protect in entering the clause into the contract. Mere competition will not amount to a legitimate business interest. In Crown dependencies, as there are no directly relevant laws it is generally accepted that UK Crown law applies but in the case of intellectual property many financial and other institutions require employees to sign 10 year or longer CNCs which could be seen to apply even if they leave the country or enter an unrelated field of work. India Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act has a general bar on any agreement that puts a restriction on trade.http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indiancontractact/indiancontractact.html#27_Agreement_in_restraint_of_trade_void On this basis, it would appear that all non-compete clauses in India are invalid. However, the Supreme Court of India has clarified that some non- compete clauses may be in interest of trade and commerce, and such clauses are not barred by Section 27 of the Contract Act, and therefore valid in India. Notably, only those clauses backed by a clear objective that is considered to be in advantage of trade and commerce survives this test. For instance, a co- founder of a startup who signed a non-compete clause can be held to it, but if a junior software developer or a call center employee signs a non-compete clause with the employer, the same may not be enforceable. Pakistan According to Section 27 of the Contract Act, 1872, any agreement that restrains a person from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business is void. However, courts of Pakistan have made decisions in the past in favour of such restrictive clauses given that the restrictions are \\"reasonable\\". The definition of \\"reasonable\\" depends on the time-period, geographical location and the designation of employee. In the case of Exide Pakistan Limited vs. Abdul Wadood, 2008 CLD 1258 (Karachi), the High Court of Sindh stated that reasonableness of the clause will vary from case to case and depends mainly on duration and extent of geographical territory See Exide Pakistan Ltd. vs. Malik Abdul Wadood 2009 CLD 716 (Division Bench ‚Äì Karachi) United States The majority of U.S. states recognize and enforce various forms of non-compete agreements. A few states, such as California, Montana, North Dakota, and Oklahoma, totally ban non-compete agreements for employees, or prohibit all non-compete agreements except in limited circumstances. For this reason, non- compete agreements have been popular among companies with employees working in states where they are allowed. (Approximately 18 percent of the U.S. workforce is bound by a non-compete agreement.) They are very common among commercial radio stations and television stations, especially for radio personalities and television personalities working for media conglomerates. For example, if a radio or television personality quits, is laid off or fired from one station in the media market they work in, they cannot work for another competing station in the same market until their contract expires with their former employing station. As of 2018, non-compete clauses cover 18 percent of United States workers, and this is down from 38 percent of workers. While more prevalent among higher-wage workers, non-competes covered 14 percent of workers without college degrees in 2018. In March 2019, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was under pressure by politicians, unions, and advocacy groups to ban non-compete clauses. A related petition estimated that \\"one out of every five U.S. workers -- or about 30 million -- is bound by such an agreement.\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-20/labor-groups- petition-u-s-ftc-to-prohibit-non-compete-clauses California Non-compete agreements are automatically void as a matter of law in California, except for a small set of specific situations expressly authorized by statute.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 16600 (‚ÄúExcept as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.‚Äù); see e.g. Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP, 44 Cal. 4th 937 (2008). They were outlawed by the original California Civil Code in 1872 (Civ. Code, former ¬ß 1673), under the influence of the American legal scholar David Dudley Field II. = Enforcement of out- of-state agreements = A leading court decision discussing the conflict between California law and the laws of other states is the 1998 decision Application Group, Inc. v. Hunter Group, Inc.61 Cal. App. 4th 881 (1998). In Hunter, a Maryland company required that its Maryland-based employee agree to a one-year non-compete agreement. The contract stated that it was governed by and to be construed according to Maryland law. A Maryland employee then left to work for a competitor in California. When the new California employer sued in California state court to invalidate the covenant not to compete, the California court agreed and ruled that the non-compete provision was invalid and not enforceable in California. Business and Professions Code Section 16600 reflects a ‚Äústrong public policy of the State of California‚Äù and the state has a strong interest in applying its law and protecting its businesses so that they can hire the employees of their choosing. California law is thus applicable to non-California employees seeking employment in California. Whether California courts are required by the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution to enforce equitable judgments from courts of other states, having personal jurisdiction over the defendant, that enjoin competition or are contrary to important public interests in California is an issue that has not yet been decided.See EMC Corp. v. Donatelli, Suffolk Superior Court, Civil Action 09-1727-BLS2 (2009). = Exceptions = There are limited situations where a reasonable non-compete agreement may be valid in California. # Where the owner of a business is selling the entire business, or is selling the goodwill in the business, the seller may be bound by a non- compete clause.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 16601. # When there is a dissolution or disassociation of a partnership.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 16602. # Where there is a dissolution of a limited liability company.Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code ¬ß 16602.5. Florida The enforceability of non-compete agreements in the state of Florida is quite common. Some law firms build their law practice around these agreements and represent employees, employers and potential new employers of an employee currently bound by a non-compete agreement. The agreement is not allowed to be overly broad and generally difficult to enforce if it is for more than two years. However, Florida courts will rarely refuse to enforce a non-compete agreement due to its length or geographic scope. Instead, under Florida law, courts are required to \\"blue pencil\\" an impermissibly broad or lengthy non-compete agreement to make it reasonable within the limits of Fla. Stat. ¬ß 542.335. Also if the agreement is part of a general employment contract then there is the possibility of a prior breach by an employer. This may cause the non-compete clause of the contract to become unenforceable. However, recent case law from Florida's appellate courts has eroded the utility of the prior breach defense. Hawaii A new law bars high-tech companies, but only such companies, in Hawaii from requiring their employees to enter into ‚Äúnon-compete‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-solicit‚Äù agreements as a condition of employment. The new law, Act 158, went into effect on July 1, 2015. Illinois Non-compete agreements will be enforced in Illinois if the agreement is ancillary to a valid relationship (employment, sale of a business, etc.) and (1) must be no greater in scope than is required to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer, (2) must not impose an undue hardship on the employee, and (3) cannot be injurious to the public.Reliable Fire Equipment Co. v. Arredondo, 2011 IL 111871 (2011). While reasonable geographic and temporal limitations on the non-compete agreement are not expressly required by governing law, they tend to be examined as a measure of whether the scope of the non-compete is greater than is required to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer.Bires v. Waltom, Case No. 8-4680 (2009). Unlike other jurisdictions, which follow the general rule that consideration is only important as to whether it exists and not as to whether it is adequate, Illinois will inquire into the adequacy of consideration.Fifield v. Premier Dealer Services, 993 N.E.2d 938, 942 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st Dist. 2013) (2013). The majority of courts will require at least two years of continued at-will employment to support a non-compete agreement (or any other type of restrictive covenant). However, in certain cases involving particularly sharp conduct by an employee, courts have required less. While Illinois courts state the rule above, logically the analytical steps should be in reverse order‚Äîbecause inadequate consideration is fatal to the claim. Thus, under McInnis v. OAG Motorcycle Ventures, Inc.McInnis v. OAG Motorcycle Ventures, Inc. 2015 IL App (1st) 130097 (June 25, 2015) there are three requirements in order for a post employment restrictive covenant limiting a former employee‚Äôs right to work for a competitor to be enforceable under Illinois law: (1) it must be ancillary to a valid contract; (2) it must be supported by adequate consideration; and (3) it must be reasonable, considering whether it: (a) is no greater than is required for the protection of a legitimate business interest of the employer, (b) does not impose undue hardship on the employee, and (c) is not injurious to the public. The McInnis decision interpreted the Fifield decision, above, to mandate two years‚Äô employment in order for consideration to be adequate. Starting in 2017, Illinois banned non-compete clauses against employees earning less than $13 per hour. Massachusetts Noncompete agreements will be enforced in Massachusetts in appropriate circumstances.See e.g., Novelty Bias Binding Co. v. Shevrin, 342 Mass. 714, 716 (1961); Marine Contractors Co., Inc. v. Hurley, 365 Mass. 280, 287 (1974); Edwards v. Athena Capital Advisors, Inc., C.A. No. 07-2418-E, 2007 Mass. Super.

See also ; Russell Beck, Negotiating, Drafting and Enforcing Noncompetition Agreements & Related Restrictive Covenants (MCLE 5th Ed. 2015). =Historical context= By 1837, Massachusetts had indisputably adopted the analysis established in Mitchel.Alger, 36 Mass. at 53 (1837). In 1922, the Supreme Judicial Court eliminated any doubt that restrictive covenants in the employment context would be enforced when reasonable.See Sherman v. Pfefferkorn, 241 Mass. 468 (1922). =Current law= The basic proposition enunciated long ago continues to apply: ‚ÄúA covenant not to compete is enforceable only if it is necessary to protect a legitimate business interest, reasonably limited in time and space, and consonant with the public interest.‚ÄùLunt v.

Reasonableness Reasonableness is the touchstone of the analysis and is highly fact- dependent.Edwards v. Athena Capital Advisors, Civil Action No. 07-2418-E (Super. Ct. Aug. 7, 2007) (‚ÄúCovenants not to compete are valid if they are reasonable in view of all the facts in a particular case.‚Äù), citing Marine Contractors. Co. v. Hurley, 365 Mass. 280, 287-288 (1974); All Stainless, Inc. v. Colby, 364 Mass. 773, 778 (1974). The context in which the CNC arises (such as employment relationship, contractual relationship) is a critical factor in the analysis.Sentry Ins. v. Firnstein, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 706, 707 (1982) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts ¬ß 188 comment g (1981)); Zabota Community Center, Inc. v. Frolova, No. 061909BLS1, *2 (May 18, 2006). A CNC that is unreasonable because it is too broad, will be scaled back if it is in fact capable of being narrowed.See Edwards v. Athena Capital Advisors, Inc., C.A. No. 07-2418-E, 2007 Mass. Super. LEXIS 378 (Super. Ct., Aug. 7, 2007), quoting All Stainless, Inc. v. Colby, 364 Mass. 773, 778 (1974). Even when a CNC is limited in duration, geographic reach, and scope, it will be enforced ‚Äúonly to the extent . . . necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the employer.‚ÄùEMC Corp. v.

Nov. 2001), citing Kroeger v. Stop & Shop Co. Inc., 13 Mass. App. Ct. 310, 316 (1982). Consideration An otherwise valid CNC must still, like other contracts, be supported by consideration. Accordingly, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that a CNC must be ‚Äúancillary . . . to an existing employment or contract of employment‚Äù or some other ‚Äúpermissible transaction . . . .‚ÄùNovelty Bias Binding Co., v. Shevrin, 342 Mass. 714, 716-17 (1961). However, consideration can exist regardless of whether the CNC is entered into at the beginning of the employment relationship, during the term of employment, or even at the end of an employment relationship.See Marine Contractors Co., Inc. v. Hurley, 365 Mass. 280, 288 (1974) (‚ÄúMarine's interest in protecting its accrued good will from possible incursions by Hurley is not weakened by the fact that it negotiated the agreement not to compete at the end of Hurley's employment rather than at some earlier time.‚Äù); Novelty Bias Binding Co., v. Shevrin, 342 Mass. 714 (1961); Richmond Bros. Inc. v. Westinghouse Bdcst. Co. Inc., 357 Mass. 106 (1970). But see Zabota Community Center, Inc. v. Frolova, No. 061909BLS1, *2 n.3 (Super. Ct. May 2006) (Although the plaintiff cited its mid-employment threat of termination as proof of consideration for the CNC, the court ‚Äúexercising its equitable powers, sees it rather differently.‚Äù). Texas Under Texas law \\"a covenant not to compete is enforceable if it is ancillary to or part of an otherwise enforceable agreement at the time the agreement is made to the extent that it contains limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained that are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee.\\"Texas Business and Commerce Code, Section 15.50a. Specific rules apply to physicians, notably that a physician cannot be prohibited \\"from providing continuing care and treatment to a specific patient or patients during the course of an acute illness even after the contract or employment has been terminated.\\"Texas Business and Commerce Code, Section 15.50b. However, Texas courts will not enforce a covenant not to compete if the court determines that such a covenant \\"is against public policy and therefore substantively unconscionable.\\"Sec. Serv. Fed. Credit Union v. Sanders, 264 S.W.3d 292, 297 (Tex. App.‚ÄìSan Antonio 2008, orig. proceeding) Utah CNCs are enforceable, but any CNC entered into after May 10, 2016 may not extend for a period of more than one year. Virginia In Virginia, the enforceability of covenants not to compete is governed by common law principles. As restrictions on trade, CNCs are not favored by Virginia courts, which will enforce only narrowly drafted CNCs that do not offend public policy. In Virginia, a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the covenant is reasonable in the sense that it is: (1) no greater than necessary to protect its legitimate business interests, such as a trade secret; (2) not unduly harsh or oppressive in restricting the employee's ability to earn a living; and (3) not against public policy. Paramount Termite Control Co., Inc v. Rector, 380 S.E.2d 922, 924 (Va. 1989). = Legitimate business interest = In Virginia, courts weigh the (1) function, (2) geographic scope and (3) duration of the CNC against the employer's legitimate business interests to determine their reasonableness.See Advanced Marine Enters., Inc. v. PRC Inc., 501 S.E.2d 148, 155 (Va. 1998); Simmons v. Miller, 544 S.E.2d 666, 678 (Va. 2001) (stating that the function, geographic scope and duration of the CNC must be considered together to determine the reasonableness of the restriction). Additionally, CNCs are only reasonable if they prevent the employee from entering into direct competition with the employer and must not encompass any activity in which the employer is not engaged.See e.g. Omniplex World Servs. Corp. v. US Investigations Servs., Inc., 618 S.E.2d 340, 342 (Va. 2005) (‚Äúcovenants not to compete have only been upheld when employees are prohibited from competing directly with the former employer or through employment with a direct competitor.‚Äù); see also Motion Control Sys. v. East, 546 S.E.2d 424 (Va. 2001). Virginia courts will not generally attempt to revise or enforce a narrower restriction in a non-compete agreement. As a result, a drafting error or unenforceable restriction may render the entire agreement unenforceable in Virginia.Non-Competition Law Trends in Virginia, Virginia Employment Lawyers Blog, June 5, 2015 =Reasonable restriction on employee's ability to earn a living= Second, to enforce the CNC, a plaintiff must show that it is not unduly harsh or oppressive in restricting the employee's ability to earn a living. In Virginia, a CNC is not unduly harsh or oppressive if balancing its function, geographic scope and duration the employee is not precluded from (1) working in a capacity not in competition with the employer within the restricted area or (2) providing similar services outside the restricted area.See Paramount, 380 S.E.2d at 925. =Public policy= Third, to enforce a CNC, a plaintiff must show the CNC is reasonable from the standpoint of a sound public policy. Virginia does not favor restrictions on employment and therefore CNCs are generally held against public policy unless they are narrowly drafted as enumerated above. In Virginia, a CNC does not violate public policy if the restrictions it imposes do not create a monopoly for the services offered by the employer or create a shortage of the skills provided by the employee.See Blue Ridge Anesthesia & Critical Care, Inc. v. Gidick, 389 S.E.2d 467, 470 (Va. 1990); Paramount, 380 S.E.2d at 925. Washington According to Racine v. Bender, CNCs will be enforced by courts if they are validly formed and reasonable.Racine v. Bender, 141 Wash. 606, 615, 252 P. 115 (1927) There are exceptions, like in Labriola v. Pollard Group, Inc., where the Washington Supreme Court invalidated a CNC not supported by independent consideration by strictly enforcing the pre-existing duty rule.Ayres, I., and Speidel, R.E. Studies in Contract Law, Seventh Edition. Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2008, p. 81 Cases * In 2005, Microsoft and Google litigated the enforceability of a non-compete clause in Kai-Fu Lee's employment contract with Microsoft. Difference in state laws were highlighted as Google attempted to maneuver the case to California courts, where California law would be more likely to hold the clause unenforceable. * IBM v. Papermaster (No. 08-9078, 2008 U.S. Dist): Mark Papermaster moving from IBM to Apple computer in 2008. * In April 2010, after a year of non-compete clause stipulated on the contract, Paul Teutul Jr., formerly from Orange County Choppers, was able to start his own new non-motorcycle design company. Related restrictive covenants While CNCs are one of the most common types of restrictive covenants, there are many others. Each serves a specific purpose and provides specific rights and remedies. The most common types of restrictive covenants are as follows: * Garden-leave clause: a type of CNC by which an employee is compensated during the period that the employee is restricted. * Forfeiture-for-Competition Agreement and Compensation-for-Competition Agreement: an agreement by which an employee either forfeits certain benefits or pays some amount of money to engage in activities that are competitive with his former employer. * Forfeiture agreement: an agreement by which an employee forfeits benefits when his employment terminates, regardless of whether he engages in competitive activities. * Nondisclosure/confidentiality agreement: an agreement by which a party agrees not to use or disclose the other party's confidential information. * Non-solicitation agreement: an agreement by which an employee agrees not to solicit and/or not to accept business from the employer's customers. * Antipiracy agreement: an agreement by which an employee agrees not to solicit and/or not to hire the employer's employees. * Invention assignment agreement: an agreement by which an employee assigns to the employer any potential inventions conceived of during employment. The enforceability of these agreements depends on the law of the particular state. As a general rule, however, with the exception of invention assignment agreements, they are subject to the same analysis as other CNCs.For more detailed information, see Beyond the noncompete References=Works cited * External links * What you should know about non-compete agreements, PBS Category:Contract law Category:Labour law Category:Contract clauses ","title":"Non-compete clause"},{"id":"3794525","text":"Fort Fredrick (; ), also known as Trincomalee Fort or Fort of Triquillimale, is a fort built by the Portuguese at Trincomalee, Eastern Province, Sri Lanka, completed in 1624 CE, built on Swami Rock-Konamamalai from the debris of the world-famous ancient Hindu Koneswaram temple (Temple of a Thousand Pillars). The temple was destroyed by the Portuguese colonial Constantino de S√° de Noronha under Phillip III, occupier of the Jaffna kingdom and Malabar country on the island. On the Konamalai cape was also built a new village of Portuguese and Tamil people, 50 Portuguese soldiers and inside the fort, a church named after \\"Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe\\". The Fort of Triquillimale was dismantled and rebuilt by the Dutch in 1665, renamed Fort Fredrick. Background The fort in 1606 Several Hindu shrines in the Tamil country were destroyed during the occupation, particularly under Philip II, when Trincomalee became the scene of naval battles during Europe's Thirty Years' War. King Ethirimana Cinkam of the Jaffna kingdom had resisted a call by D. Jer√≥nimo de Azevedo in 1612 to aid the latter in building a fortress in Trincomalee. The enterprise was abandoned.Perniola, V. ‚ÄúThe Catholic church in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese period‚Äù, Vol. II, p. 366. With the defeat of King Cankili II, all of the territory of the kingdom of Jaffna, comprising Trincomalee and Batticaloa, was assigned to the \\"spiritual cures of the Franciscans.\\" This decision was taken by the bishop of Cochin, fray Dom Sebasti√£o de S. Pedro.Perniola, V. ‚ÄúThe Catholic church in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese period‚Äù, vol. II, p. 458.; Perniola, V. ‚ÄúThe Catholic church in Sri Lanka. The Portuguese period‚Äù, vol. III, p. 51.: Later, another decree of the same bishop of Cochin dated 11 November 1622, tracing that one indicated in 1602, entrusted newly to the Jesuits the spiritual cure in the districts of Jaffna, Trincomalee and Batticaloa, giving to them possibility to build churches, to train the sacraments and to convert the souls. The Jesuits would follow the Portuguese soldiers to Trincomalee and Batticaloa when they occupied the two localities. By the end of 1619, a small Danish fleet had arrived at Trincomalee; in May 1620, the Danes occupied Koneswaram temple and began works for the fortification of the peninsula before being defeated.Barner Jensen, U. ‚ÄúDanish East India. Trade coins and the coins of Tranquebar, 1620-1845‚Äù, pp. 11-12; Holden Furber ‚ÄúImperi rivali nei mercati d‚Äôoriente, 1600-1800‚Äù, note n¬∞ 66, p. 326: \\"Senarat of Kandy sent to Trincomalee 60 Sinhala men in order to help the Danes in the construction of their fort. During their permanence in Trincomalee, the Danesh coined also some \\"Larins\\", on which were recorded the words ‚ÄòDon Erich Grubbe‚Äô, of these coins, today do not remain trace, if not in the diary of Ove Giedde.\\" 1622 destruction of Koneswaram temple The shrine was attacked and destroyed on April 14, 1622 CE, the Tamil New Years Day, by the Portuguese general Constantino de S√° de Noronha (who called it the Temple of a Thousand Pillars). The main statue was taken out to town during the 'ther' (chariot or car) procession, during which time Portuguese soldiers entered the temple dressed as Iyer priests and began robbing it. In an act of religious zeal, the temple was then levered over the edge into the sea. Fleeing priests buried some of the temple's statues in the surrounding area. Temple stones and its carved pillars were used to construct Fort Fredrick to strengthen the colonists' influence over the eastern seaboard of the island against other invading European armies, including the Dutch navy during the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese Wars. An extensive campaign of destruction of five hundred Hindu shrines, the Saraswathi Mahal Library and forced conversion in the Tamil country was conducted by the Portuguese upon their arrival to the island and conquest of the Jaffna kingdom; the temple had been paying protection fees of 1280 fanams a year to the Portuguese. Trincomalee witnessed several naval battles of Europe's Thirty Years' War under Phillip II's man Filipe de Oliveira.Gnanaprakasar, S. A critical history of Jaffna, pp. 153‚Äì72. Between 1639‚Äì1689 CE, the Ati Konanayakar temple was built in nearby Thampalakamam to house the idols on procession that survived. The destruction of the Konesar temple is historically viewed as the biggest loot of one of the richest temples of Asia. Gold, pearls, precious stones and silks collected for more than 1000 years were robbed within a few hours. A site plan by De Queiroz states: \\"On the first rise to the summit of the rock was a Pagoda, another at mid-ascent, and the principal one of them all at the highest eminence, visited by a concourse of Hindus from the whole of India.\\" In his dispatch to Philip III, King of Portugal, Constantino described: \\"The land of the Pagoda is 600 fathoms long and 80 feet at its broadest, narrowing to 30 feet.\\" The final monument of the temple complex was destroyed two years later. Regarding a prophetic Tamil inscription de Noronha found at the site, he added \\"When I went there to make this Fort, I found engraved on the Pagoda, among many other inscriptions, one that ran thus: Kulakottan has built this pagoda...\\" 1624 - 1639 Fort Fredrick. The fort that was built by the Portuguese was initially a triangular fort named the Fort of Triquillimale by the Portuguese equipped with guns captured from a Danish fleet ship. Of triangular shape it was \\"... of stone and mortar...\\" with three bastions to the three angles, the more important bastion, was called ‚ÄòSanta Cruz‚Äô, it was the key for the defence of the bay and it was situated on the south side of the isthmus to directed contact with the waters of the bay, on this bastion were mounted six pieces of artillery. To the north extremity of the isthmus was situated the bastion of ‚ÄòSanto Ant√≥nio‚Äô, it was equipped of five pieces of artillery. The two main bastions were connect by a wall 100 \\"pa√ßos\\" long, three and half \\"bra√ßas\\" high and six \\"palmos\\" thick, this wall closed the isthmus in its more narrow part. A third bastion, the smallest of the three, was situated on the north side up on the peninsula, on this bastion were mounted three pieces of artillery. All the artillery had been recovered by a relict of a Danish ship. Another wall of the same dimension of the previous one, connected on the south side this third bastion with the main bastion of ‚ÄòSanta Cruz‚Äô. While on the north side the third bastion was connected with that of Sancto Antonio only by a parapet of \\"pedra and cal\\" situated on the top of the rock cliff to the sea, the Portuguese had modified the escarpment below this wall so as to render it steeper. On the higher extremity of the peninsula a small settlement of Portuguese ‚Äòcasados‚Äô and indigenous was situated, in total ‚Äòvinte brancos e vinte e cinco pretos‚Äô. The casados together with 50 Portuguese soldiers guaranteed the garrisoning of the fortress. The soldiers resided inside of the fortress together with their captain, while the captain of the fort that was named by the King or by the Viceroy, resided in a house in the settlement of the casados.18 In accordance with a map in the \\"Livro das plantas das fortalezas cidades e povoa√ßois do Estado da India Oriental\\" another isolated bastion was present on the south side of the rocky promontory. In front of the two main bastions a ditch seems to have been present. A small native village was situated between the Portuguese fort and the bay. In the Bocarro's map are shown also three temples on the extreme point of the peninsula, these temples instead are not present in the map of the \\"Livro das plantas das fortalezas cidades and povoa√ßois do Estado da India Oriental\\" of the library of the Pa√ßo Ducal de Vila Vi√ßosa. The entrance of the fort seems to have been situated along the southern wall on the side of the village of ‚Äòcasados‚Äô.Bocarro, A. ‚ÄúLivro das plantas das fortalezas cidades e povoacois do Estado da India Oriental‚Äù, p. 238. A map of the Portuguese age, compiled by the same Costantino de S√° governor of Ceylon, shows the fort of Trincomalee situated on the isthmus of the peninsula, clearly indicated in it is the village of the casados situated on the peninsula beyond the fort, the same fort has triangular shape with three bastions. It makes part of the same collection, a greater map of the fort, entitled \\"Planta da fortalesa de Trinquilimale\\" with indicates the names of the three bastions: S. Cruz (the larger bastion), S. Ant√≥nio and the small S. Tiago, with the indication \\"este baluarte se acomodou ao sitio\\". On the inner inside of the fort it is the name of N. S. de Guadalupe, indicating the name of the church of Trincomalee. Costantino de S√° informs us that on the three bastions were mounts 16 pieces of artillery, the garrison comprised 40 soldiers and 30 casados. The place was judged by de S√° impregnable for being placed on high cliffs and, according with his opinion, also the Portuguese city with a few works of fortification could be rendered one of the more strong places of the entire east.19 This is the description that captain Jo√£o Ribeiro makes to us of the fort of Trincomalee: the fort was a triangular fortress with three bastions, one on each angle, armed with 10 iron guns, it was constructed on a hill near the ‚ÄòBay dos Arcos‚Äô, inside the fort was a church20 and a warehouse for the goods and ammunitions. A captain and 50 soldiers were of garrison, in the fortress then resided a constable, Casados and a chaplain. The dimensions of smaller sides of the fortress were of 75 meters, the greater side measured 150 meters.‚ÄúCostantine de Sa‚Äôs maps and plans of Ceylon‚Äù, p. 57.Called in Caen‚Äôs diary ‚ÄúNossa Senhora de Garde Rope‚Äù that is ‚ÄúNossa Senhora de Guadalupe‚Äù, in: J.R.A.S.

The fort was renamed Fort Fredrick. In 1672, the year when the Dutch Republic was attacked by France, Britain, and two German states, the French captured Trincomalee and later they occupied Batticaloa. However soon the French were forced to leave. Trincomalee was important for its large all- season secure harbor. In late 18th century Trincomalee traded hands once more with the French capturing it again and later handing back to the Dutch East India Company (VOC) at the Peace of Paris in 1784. In 1795 it was taken over by the British, and remained a British garrison till 1948. Duri Coastal artillery guns were added during the two World Wars. Today it remains garrisoned by a detachment of the Gajaba Regiment, Sri Lanka Army, but accessible to visitors. Arthur Wellesley, later 1st Duke of Wellington visited whilst a Colonel in the British East India Company, the bungalow he resided in is known as Wellesley Lodge which is inside Fort Fredrick and now is the officer's mess of the 2nd (Volunteer) battalion of the Gajaba Regiment of the Sri Lankan Army.Lalin‚Äôs Column: Obrigado (Thank you) Portugal See also *Forts of Sri Lanka References  Category:Archaeological protected monuments in Trincomalee District Category:Barracks in Sri Lanka Category:British forts in Sri Lanka Category:Dutch forts in Sri Lanka Category:Forts in Eastern Province, Sri Lanka Category:Portuguese forts in Sri Lanka Category:Residential buildings in Trincomalee Category:Sri Lankan Army bases Category:World War II sites in Sri Lanka ","title":"Fort Fredrick"},{"id":"3794528","text":"Anse Etoile is an administrative district of Seychelles on the island of Mah√©.

Overview The location of Aqaba is unusual, for within a 15 miles (24 km) radius there are three other countries, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel. The airport has a single runway equipped with a category 1 instrument landing system (ILS). Thanks to its normally excellent weather conditions, the airport is rarely closed, though strong southerly winds bring sandstorms across the Red Sea from Egypt. The airport has a single 28,000 sq ft (2,600 m2) terminal building with just one departure gate and one baggage carousel, though the building is being extended. The facilities can cope when there is one aircraft to be handled, but on some occasions when there are three aircraft being turned around simultaneously things can become somewhat crowded. The capacity of the Terminal at present is 1.5 million passengers a year. There are also separate buildings for General Aviation and a Royal Pavilion ‚Äì King Abdullah II owns a palace along the shoreline and regularly visits. The Royal Jordanian Air Academy are regular visitors on land-away cross country training exercises. Annual passenger figures have risen from around 20,000 per year in the early days to over 90,000 in the year 2000. There are currently around 3,000 aircraft movements a year. A significant proportion of these are training flights, including those of the Royal Jordanian Air Force. The largest operator at Aqaba is Royal Jordanian. It operates about 10 flights a week to Amman, though extras are frequently scheduled, sometimes to coincide with passenger changeover on cruise ships. The airline operates Embraer E175 Regional Jets that undertake the journey in 45 minutes. These jets have replaced the Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft used by the Royal Wings subsidiary and have a total of 72 seats, 10 of which are business class. The airline also undertakes about six charter flights to Europe, with European charter airlines adding a further dozen. Aqaba is an airport that can handle the largest jets. Facilities map Annual Capacity 1,000,000, The airport has 4 check-in desks, 2 gates, a cargo building and a cargo apron together with a parallel taxiway. The airport has one baggage claim belt, 200 short- term parking spaces, a post office, bank, cafeterias, VIP lounge, duty-free shop, and gift shops, and a clinic. The airport includes also buildings for the Ayla Aviation Academy, the Royal Jordanian Academy, the Aero Wings for Industry's assembly plant for light planes, the Jordan Private Jets Services (JPJets)'s private jet terminal, and the Al Baddad International Group's maintenance centre.Historical Development of KHIA A new cargo terminal (6000 m2) and a new cargo apron (220 m √ó 600 m) opened in January 2005.

Several of his works, notably his novels Satantango (, 1985) and The Melancholy of Resistance (, 1989), have been turned into feature films by Hungarian film director B√©la Tarr. Biography=Early life and education Krasznahorkai was born in Gyula, Hungary, on 5 January 1954, to a middle-class Jewish family on his father's side.https://terebess.hu/keletkultinfo/krasznahorkai1.html His father was Gy√∂rgy Krasznahorkai, a lawyer, and his mother, J√∫lia P√°link√°s, was a social security administrator. After completing his secondary education in 1972 at the Erkel Ferenc high school where he specialized in Latin, he studied law from 1973 to 1976 at J√≥zsef Attila University (JATE) (now the University of Szeged) and from 1976 to 1978 at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University (ELTE) (formerly the University of Budapest). After completing law studies, he sought a degree in Hungarian language and literature at ELTE. As a requirement of his degree work, he submitted a formal thesis on the work and experiences of Hungarian writer and journalist S√°ndor M√°rai (1900‚Äì1989) after he fled Hungary in 1948 to escape the Communist regime that seized power after World War II (M√°rai lived in exile in Italy and later San Diego, California). During his years as a university student in Budapest, Krasznahorkai worked at Gondolat K√∂nyvkiad√≥, a publishing company. Krasznahorkai received his degree in 1983. Career as writer Since completing his university studies Krasznahorkai has supported himself as an independent author. When in 1985 his first major publication Satantango achieved success, he was immediately thrust into the forefront of Hungarian literary life. The book, a dystopian novel set in his native Hungary, is regarded as his most famous. It received a Best Translated Book Award in English in 2013. He travelled outside of Communist Hungary for the first time in 1987, spending a year in West Berlin as a recipient of a DAAD fellowship. Since the collapse of the Soviet bloc, he has lived in a variety of locations. In 1990, for the first time, he was able to spend a significant amount of time in East Asia. He drew upon his experiences in Mongolia and China in writing The Prisoner of Urga and Destruction and Sorrow Beneath the Heavens. He has returned many times to China. In 1993, his novel The Melancholy of Resistance received the German Bestenliste-Prize for the best literary work of the year. In 1996, he was a guest of the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin. While completing the novel War and War, he travelled widely across Europe. The American poet Allen Ginsberg was of great assistance in completing the work; Krasznahorkai resided for some time in Ginsberg's New York apartment, and he described the poet's friendly advice as valuable in bringing the book to life. In 1996, 2000, and 2005 he spent six months in Kyoto. His contact with the aesthetics and literary theory of the Far East resulted in significant changes in his writing style and deployed themes. He returns often to both Germany and Hungary, but he has also spent varying lengths of time in several other countries, including the United States, Spain, Greece, and Japan, providing inspiration for his novel Seiobo There Below, which won the Best Translated Book Award in 2014. Beginning in 1985, the renowned director and the author's good friend B√©la Tarr made films almost exclusively based on Krasznahorkai's works, including S√°t√°ntang√≥ and Werckmeister Harmonies. Krasznahorkai said the 2011 film The Turin Horse would be their last collaboration. Krasznahorkai has received international acclaim from critics. Susan Sontag described him as \\"the contemporary Hungarian master of apocalypse who inspires comparison with Gogol and Melville\\". W. G. Sebald remarked, \\"The universality of Krasznahorkai's vision rivals that of Gogol's Dead Souls and far surpasses all the lesser concerns of contemporary writing.\\" In 2015, he received the Man Booker International Prize, the first Hungarian author to be so awarded. Personal life After residing in Berlin, Germany for several years, where he was for six months S. Fischer Guest Professor at the Free University of Berlin, Krasznahorkai currently resides \\"as a recluse in the hills of Szentl√°szl√≥\\" in Hungary.L√°szl√≥ Krasznahorkai ‚Äì Author at New Directions Publishing (Retrieved 9 August 2012).

Dr. Garner returned to New Zealand in 1962, joining a team of scientists that founded the New Zealand Oceanographic Institute of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (today known as National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research), then located in Hobson Street, Wellington, New Zealand. Dr. Garner immigrated with his family to Canada in 1968, as a physical oceanographer in the ocean circulation department at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Nova Scotia, Canada from February 1968 to July 1971, where his topics of research included effects around the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. He worked extensively on the oceanographic research vessels CSS Dawson and CSS Hudson (Canadian Scientific Ship, painted Survey Ship white, and run by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography), which today is the CCGS Hudson. His voyages included a portion of the first ever circumnavigation of North and South America by the CSS Hudson in 1970, on which he was a watch keeper, not a scientist. David Garner returned with his family to New Zealand in 1971, where he was a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland Physics Department from approximately July 1971 to 1974, in Auckland, New Zealand. During his tenure, he worked on the physical oceanographic aspects of an ecological impact report by the university for Shell BP Todd Maui in their offshore drilling operations.

The film shows David getting into an Avro Anson, and working with a kite on the back of a truck, and a trawler. David attended Stages I and II at Canterbury College, then moved to Wellington where he graduated BSc and MSc from the Victoria College of the University of New Zealand. After graduation David was employed doing sunspot research at the Carter Observatory in Kelburn, Wellington, from where he published his first scientific paper. David Garner was the father of three children by Edna Jean Garner: including Mary Ann Garner, John David Garner and Steven James Garner. His wife was Kirsty Garner. David Garner died 13 May 2016.

He was the son of Sadiq Khan Zand, who was removed from the throne in Shiraz by Ali Murad Khan, who had previously taken Isfahan for himself.  Biography =Early life In February 1781, the Zand prince Ali Murad Khan put Jafar Khan's father Sadiq Khan Zand and all his brothers to death when he invaded Shiraz. Jafar Khan was the only one who was spared, because he privately had reached an agreement with Ali Murad Khan. While Ali Murad Khan was in northern Iran in 1785, Jafar Khan took the opportunity to besiege Isfahan. Ali Murad Khan then marched towards the city in order to defend it, but died on 11 February at Murchakhur, a town near Isfahan. Reign Jafar Khan then crowned himself as the new Zand king in Isfahan. At the same time, the Qajar warlord Agha Mohammad Khan marched towards Isfahan. Jafar Khan then sent his men to stop his advance towards the city, but they withdrew at Qum without even putting any resistance. Jafar Khan then sent an even larger Zand army towards Agha Mohammad Khan, who defeated the army near Kashan. Jafar Khan then fled to Shiraz. Agha Mohammad afterwards arrived to Isfahan, where he discovered what was left of the Zand treasure and Jafar Khan's harem. The Qajar troops then looted the city. In 1786, while Agha Mohammad Khan was in northern Iran, Jafar Khan quickly marched towards Isfahan and re-captured it. He then sent troops towards Kashan and Qum, while he marched towards Hamadan. He was, however, defeated by local tribal chieftains, such as a certain Khosrow Khan and Mohammad Hosayn Khan Qaragozlu. Jafar Khan then withdrew to Isfahan. When Agha Mohammad Khan heard about the Zand invasion of Isfahan and its surroundings, he quickly marched towards the city, which made Jafar Khan retreat back to Shiraz once again. In 1788, Agha Mohammad advanced closely to Shiraz, where he hoped to bait Jafar Khan out of Shiraz, which was strongly fortified, making it very hard to besiege. Unfortunately for Agha Mohammad Khan, Jafar Khan stayed in the city, which made Agha Mohammad Khan return to Isfahan, where appointed his brother Ali Qoli as its new governor, thus succeeding Jafar Qoli Khan. He then left for Tehran. With Agha Mohammad once again in the north, Jafar Khan began raising an army to prepare another attack against Isfahan and its surroundings. When Ali Qoli found out about it, he sent a group of tribesmen to a city south to Isfahan, named Qumishah. However, Jafar Khan managed to easily defeat them. Ali Qoli thereafter retreated to Kashan. Agha Mohammad Khan, learning of this, rapidly marched towards Isfahan, which made Jafar Khan withdraw to Shiraz once again. Agha Mohammad Khan, who was too unconfident to try and capture Shiraz, then went back to Tehran. Jafar Khan was murdered on 23 January 1789 by Ali Murad Khan's son Sayed Murad Khan. After his death, a four-month civil war began between several Zand princes who fought for succession to the throne. Jafar Khan's son Lotf Ali Khan emerged being the victor in this civil war in May.

There are many well recorded instances of the Apple Wassail in the early modern period. The first recorded mention was at Fordwich, Kent, in 1585, by which time groups of young men would go between orchards performing the rite for a reward. The practice was sometimes referred to as \\"howling\\". On Twelfth Night, men would go with their wassail bowl into the orchard and go about the trees. Slices of bread or toast were laid at the roots and sometimes tied to branches. Cider was also poured over the tree roots. The ceremony is said to \\"bless\\" the trees to produce a good crop in the forthcoming season. Among the most famous wassail ceremonies are those in Whimple, Devon and Carhampton, Somerset, both on 17 January. There are also many new, commercial or \\"revival\\" wassails springing up all over the Westcountry such as those in Stoke Gabriel and Sandford, Devon. Clevedon (North Somerset) holds an annual Wassailing event in the popularly attended Clevedon Community Orchard, combining the traditional elements of the festival with the entertainment and music of the Bristol Morris Men and their cantankerous Horse. A folktale from Somerset reflecting this custom tells of the Apple Tree Man, the spirit of the oldest apple tree in an orchard, and in whom the fertility of the orchard is thought to reside. In the tale a man offers his last mug of mulled cider to the trees in his orchard and is rewarded by the Apple Tree Man who reveals to him the location of buried gold.Briggs, Katharine (1976).

While all Sunni Muslims accept the group of hadith as authentic, the exact location of the area referred to as \\"Najd\\" is disputed by Salafis, while most other Muslims understand it to mean Najd in Saudi Arabia, which is the geographic origin of the Salafi movement. Text of the hadith According to two narrations in Sahih Bukhari, Muhammad asks Allah to bless the areas of Bilad al-Sham (Syria) and Yemen. When his companions said \\"Our Najd as well,\\" he replied: \\"There will appear earthquakes and afflictions, and from there will come out the side of the head (e.g. horns) of Satan.\\"Sahih Bukhari Volume 2, Book 17, Number 147Sahih Bukhari Volume 9, Book 88, Number 214 In a similar narration, Muhammad again asked Allah to bless the areas Medina, Mecca, Sham, and Yemen and, when asked specifically to bless Najd, repeated similar comments about there being earthquakes, trials, tribulations, and the horns of Satan.\\"O Allah bestow your blessings on our Medina, and bestow your blessings on our Mecca, and bestow your blessings on our Sham, and bestow your blessings on our Yemen, and bestow your blessings in our measuring (fee saa\`inaa wa muddinaa).\\" A person said, \\"O Messenger of Allah and in our Najd\\" and so he turned away from him and said, \\"there will occur earthquakes, trials and tribulations and there will appear the horn of Satan.\\" From Shu'ayb al- Arna'ut: Sharh as-Sunnah' (14/206-207 fn. 2)O Allah bestow your blessings on our Medina, O Allah bestow your blessings in our measuring, O Allah bestow your blessings in our Sham and our Yemen.\\" A person said, \\"And Najd O Messenger of Allah?\\" He said, \\"from there arises the horn of Satan and the trials and tribulations would come like mounting waves.\\" From al-Awsat by at- Tabaraanee from Hadith of Ibn Umar and authenticated by Ali ibn Abu Bakr al- Haythami in Mujma az-Zawaa\`id (3/305) > \\"O Allaah bestow your blessings on our Shaam. O Allaah bestow your blessings > on our Yemen.\\" The people said, \\"O Messenger of Allaah, and our Najd.\\" I > think the third time the Prophet, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said, \\"There > (in Najd) will occur earthquakes, trials and tribulations, and from there > appears the Horn of Satan.\\" It has been asserted that this hadith is relating the coming events that shook the Muslim nation, these known as fitnah or 'trials'. It has also been identified as where the Dajjal or Antichrist is said to emerge from (according to a narration through Imam Nawawi). There have also been various theories instigated against the people of the modern day region of Saudi Arabia known as 'Najd', however, linguistical and geographically this argument is disputed.Dr. Turki bin Fahad al-Ghamiz, Imtina' an-Nabi 'alaihi as-Salatu was- Salam 'an ad-Du'a li-Najd. Islam Today, 10 December 2005. Accessed 24 June 2018. Location of Najd The apparent meaning of 'najd' indicates a raised area, it is regarded that there are up to 13 various locations in the region regarded as 'najd'. Historically the location has been accounted as being between the borders of Iraq and modern day Saudi Arabia. This is in accordance to \\"Najd Qarnu ash-Shaytaan\\" the definition of Najd depends on one's own location, and from Madina, Najd would be Iraq. The area is indicated by various scholars of hadith as to be in accordance with this. Ibn Hajar al- Asqalani said after quoting the words of al-Khattaabee explaining the meaning of Qarn (horn) ; * \\"and others have said that the People of the East were disbelievers at that time and the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, informed us that the trials and tribulations would arise from that direction and it was as he said. And the first of the trials that arose, arose from the direction of the east and they were the reason for the splitting of the Muslim ranks, and this is what Satan loves and delights in. Likewise, the innovations appeared from that direction.\\" Ibn Hajr quoted al-Khattabi as saying: * \\"The najd is in the direction of the east, and for the one who is in Madeenah then his Najd would be the desert of Iraaq and its regions for this is to the east of the People of Madeenah. The basic meaning of Najd is that which is raised/elevated from the earth in contravention to al-Gawr for that is what is lower than it. Tihaamah [the coastal plain along the south-western and southern shores of the Arabian Peninsula] is entirely al-Gawr and Mecca is in Tihaamah.'[...] by this [saying of al-Khattaabee] the weakness of the saying of ad-Daawodee is understood that 'Najd is in the direction of Iraq' [min Nahiya al-Iraq] for he suggests that Najd is a specific place. This is not the case, rather everything that is elevated with respect to what adjoins it is called Najd and the lower area called Gawr.\\" The celebrated 12th-century historian Ali ibn al-Athir, who had frequently traveled to Iraq during the era of Saladin and had written his monumental work al-Kamil fi at-Tarikh (The Complete History), writes in his work 'al-Nih√¢yah' ; * \\"Najd is the highland region. This name is given to area beyond the Hij√¢z towards Iraq\\". It is also related that Imam Nawawi in his Sharh Saheeh Muslim 2/29 stated that this hadith had to with the Dajjal or Antichrist coming from the East. Possible locations Scholars have elucidated that there are perhaps up to thirteen various regions known as Najd. The geographer and Islamic scholar, of Greek origin, Imam Yaqut al-Hamawi in his encyclopedic work Mu'jam al-Buldan explained the various regions of najd as; 1\\\\. Najd Yemen. 2\\\\. Najd Iraq. 3\\\\. Najd Hejaz. 4\\\\. Najd Khal. 5\\\\. Najd Al-Shari. 6\\\\. Najd Azaar. 7\\\\. Najd Al- Aqaab. 8\\\\. Najd Kabkab. 9\\\\. Najd Mari. 10\\\\. Najd Alwaz. 11\\\\. Najd-e-Aja. Contemporary theories A number of authors have claimed that the hadith refers to Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the patronym of the Wahhabi movement. It is accounted that the origin of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab is from the modern day Najd region of Saudi Arabia which happens to be the only surviving region that carried on the title of 'Najd' after the geographical codification regardless that there were several distinct locations known previously as 'Najd'. This theory is generally supported by adherents to Barelvism as well as Twelver Shi'ism that have disdain for Wahhabism. Further Non-Wahhabi- Sunnis, such as scholars from Al-Azhar University, identified Wahhabism as the predicted \\"Horn of the Devil\\", or the Islamic Dajjal.Simon Ross Valentine Force and Fanaticism: Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia and Beyond Oxford University Press 2015 John Andrew Morrow Restoring the Balance: Using the Qur‚Äôan and the Sunnah to Guide a Return to the Prophet‚Äôs Islam Cambridge Scholars Publishing 2016 page 200 Contrary, advocates of Wahhabism consider the Banu Tamim tribe of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, in the present-day Saudi Arabia, as the only one, who will resist the Dajjal, citing certain scholary works, such as the Musnad of Ahmad ibn Hanbal: \\"Do not say of Banu Tamim anything but good, for indeed they are the severest of people in attacking the Dajjaal.\\" Further, the Ibn Hajar praises the Banu Tamim in his Tafsir: \\"I have loved the people of the tribe of Banu Tamim, ever since I heard three things the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said about them. I heard him saying, 'these people (of the tribe of Banu Tamim) would stand firm against the Dajjaal.' When the Saddaqat from that tribe came, the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said, \\"these are the Saddaqat (charitable gifts) of our folk.\\" Aa'ishah had a slave girl from that tribe, and the Prophet, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said to Aa'ishah, 'manumit her as she is a descendant of Ismaa'eel, alayhis salaam.\\" However evidence can be cited from the cluster of hadiths which identify the miqat points for pilgrims. In a hadith narrated by Imam Nasa‚Äôi (Manasik al-Hajj, 22), 'A‚Äôisha (r.a.) declared that 'Allah‚Äôs Messenger (s.w.s.) established the miqat for the people of Madina at Dhu‚Äôl-Hulayfa, for the people of Syria and Egypt at al-Juhfa, for the people of Iraq at Dhat Irq, and for the people of Najd at Qarn, and for the Yemenis at Yalamlam.' Imam Muslim (Hajj, 2) narrates a similar hadith: 'for the people of Madina it is Dhu‚Äôl-Hulayfa ‚Äì while on the other road it is al-Juhfa ‚Äì for the people of Iraq it is Dhat Irq, for the people of Najd it is Qarn, and for the people of Yemen it is Yalamlam.' These texts constitute unarguable proof that the Prophet (s.w.s.) distinguished between Najd and Iraq, so much so that he appointed two separate miqat points for the inhabitants of each. For him, clearly, Najd did not include Iraq. Otherwise some scholars assert, the 'Hadith of Najd' actually refers to Iraq, supported by the indication of another hadith: Narrated by Yusair bin 'Amr:I asked Sahl bin Hunaif, \\"Did you hear the Prophet saying anything about Al-Khawarij?\\" He said, \\"I heard him saying while pointing his hand towards Iraq. \\"There will appear in it (i.e, Iraq) some people who will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats, and they will go out from (leave) Islam as an arrow darts through the game's body.' \\" Ibn 'Abd al-Barr (368h-463h) was quoted as saying: \\"Allah knows best that the reason behind pointing of Prophet peace be upon him towards east regarding fitna is that the biggest fitna which was the key of troubles was the martyrdom of Uthman ibn Affan may Allah be pleased with him, and that was the reason behind the war of Jamal and Siffeen, these troubles started from the east. Then Khawarij emerged from the land of Najd, Iraq and its regions.\\"  See also  * Fitnat al-Wahhabiyya * Nejd Expedition * Wahhabi War External Links * Puncturing the Devil‚Äôs Dream About the Hadiths of Najd and Tamim - Masud.co.uk References Category:Hadith Category:Islamic eschatology Category:Satan ","title":"Hadith of Najd"},{"id":"3794673","text":"is a Japanese tokusatsu television series.

It was the shortest Kamen Rider series ever, lasting only 24 episodes.

Biography = Background and early life  Sadeq Khan belonged to the Zand tribe, a small and little-known tribe of Laks,...the bulk of the evidence points to their being one of the northern Lur or Lak tribes, who may originally have been immigrants of Kurdish origin., Peter Avery, William Bayne Fisher, Gavin Hambly, Charles Melville (ed.), The Cambridge History of Iran: From Nadir Shah to the Islamic Republic, Cambridge University Press, 1991, , p. 64. a branch of Lurs who may have been originally Kurdish. The Zands were concentrated on the villages of Pari and Kamazan in the Malayer district, but were also found roaming in the central Zagros ranges and the countryside of Hamadan. Sadeq Khan was the son of a certain Inaq Khan Zand, and had 3 sisters, a brother named Karim Khan Zand, and two half-brothers named Zaki Khan Zand and Eskandar Khan Zand. In 1722, the Safavid Empire was on the verge of collapsing‚ÄîIsfahan and most of central and east Iran had been seized by the Afghan Hotak dynasty, while the Russians had conquered many cities in northern Iran. Around the same time, the Ottoman Empire took advantage of Iran‚Äôs decadence to conquer a large number of western frontier districts. There they faced bold opposition from the local clans, including the Zands, who under the chief Mehdi Khan Zand harassed their forces and stopped them from advancing further into Iran. In 1732, Nader Qoli Beg, who had restored Safavid rule in Iran and had become the de facto ruler of the country, he made an expedition into the Zagros ranges of western Iran in order to subdue the tribes, whom he considered bandits. He first defeated the Bakhtiari and the Feylis, whom he forced to mass-migrate in larger numbers into Khorasan. He then baited Mehdi Khan Zand and his forces out of their stronghold at Pari, killing the latter and 400 of his Zand kinsmen. The surviving members of the tribe were forced to mass-migrate under the leadership of Inaq Khan Zand and his younger brother Budaq Khan Zand to Abivard and Dargaz, where its able members were incorporated into Nader's army.  Service under Karim Khan Zand  In 1774, the Mamluk governor of the Ottoman province of Iraq, Omar Pasha began meddling in the affairs of his vassal principality of Baban, which since the death of his predecessor Sulayman Abu Layla Pasha in 1762, had fallen more and more under the influence of the Zand governor of Ardalan, Khosrow Khan Bozorg. This made Omar Pasha dismiss the Baban ruler Muhammad Pasha, and appoint Abdolla Pasha as its new ruler. This, and Omar Pasha's seizure of the remnants of Iranian pilgrims who had died during the plague that ravaged Iraq in 1773‚Äîand his exaction of payment from Iranian pilgrims to visit the holy Shia places of Najaf and Karbala, gave Karim Khan the casus belli to declare war against the Ottomans. There were also other reasons for Karim Khan to declare war‚ÄîMashhad, where the holy Imam Reza shrine was situated, was not under Zand control, which thus meant that free entry to the sanctuaries of Iraq was of more significance to Karim Khan than it had been to the Safavid and Afsharid shahs. The Zand army was discontent, and sought to restore their reputation after Zaki Khans humiliating blunders on the Hormuz Island. Most importantly, Basra was a prominent trading port, which had surpassed the competing city of Bushehr in Fars in 1769, when the East India Company dropped the city for Basra. The Zand forces under Ali-Morad Khan Zand and Nazar Ali Khan Zand shortly clashed with the Pasha's forces in Kurdistan, where they kept them at bay, whilst Sadeq Khan, with an army of 30,000, besieged Basra in April 1775. The Arab tribe al- Muntafiq, which was allied with the governor of Basra, quickly withdrew without any effort to reject Sadeq Khan from passing through the Shatt al- Arab, whilst the Banu Ka'b and the Arabs of Bushehr supplied him with boats and supplies. Ottoman envoy Vehbi Efendi. Suleiman Agha, who was the commander of the fort of Basra, resisted Sadeq Khan's forces with resolve, which made the latter establish an encirclement, which would last over a year. Henry Moore, who belonged to the East India company, assaulted some of Sadeq Khan's stockpile boats, tried to block the Shatt al-Arab, and then departed to Bombay. A few months later, in October, a group of ships from Oman gave supplies and military aid to Basra, which considerably lifted the morale of its forces. However, their combined attack the next day occurred to be wavering‚Äîthe Omani ships eventually chose to withdraw back to Muscat during winter, in order to avoid further losses. Reinforcements from Baghdad arrived shortly afterwards, which was repelled by the Khaza'il, a Shia Arab tribe which was allied with the Zand forces. In the spring of 1776, the narrow encirclement by Sadeq Khan had resulted in the defenders being on the fringe of famine‚Äîa considerable portion of the Basra forces had deserted Suleiman Agha, whilst the rumours of a possible uprising, made Suleiman Agha surrender on 16 April 1776. Even though the able Ottoman Sultan Mustafa III (r. 1757‚Äì1774) had died and was succeeded by his incompetent brother Abdul Hamid I (r. 1774‚Äì1789), and the recent Ottoman defeat to the Russians, the Ottoman response to the Ottoman‚ÄìIranian war was unusually slow. In February 1775, before the announcement of the siege of Basra had approached Istanbul, and while the Zagros front was temporarily peaceful, the Ottoman ambassador, Vehbi Efendi, was sent to Shiraz. He reached Shiraz around the same time Sadeq Khan besieged Basra, \\"but was not empowered to negotiate over this new crisis.\\" In 1778, Karim Khan had made a compromise with the Russians for a cooperative offensive into eastern Anatolia. However, the invasion never took place due to Karim Khan's death on 1 March 1779, after having been ill for six months, most likely due to tuberculosis. Sadeq Khan and his forces shortly abandoned Basra.  Reign  Court of Sadeq Khan Zand. Karim Khan's death in March 1779 was followed by a power struggle. His sons Mohammad Ali Khan and Abol-Fath Khan Zand were declared co-rulers, but their rule was only nominal; real power was in the hands of their uncle Zaki Khan. After Zaki Khan's murder by the people of Isfahan, there was widespread rebellion. Ali-Morad Khan Zand, the commander of the royal army, who was sent to undermine a Qajar attack in the north, betrayed Abol-Fath and left the capital defenseless. Sadeq Khan, supported by the Nizari imam Ab≈´-l-·∏§asan  ªAlƒ´, collected an army in Kerman and invaded Shiraz, where he faced little resistance.Farhad Daftary, The IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´s: Their History and Doctrines (Cambridge University Press, 1990: ), p. 500. On August 22, 1779, Abol-Fath died from a heart attack and he became the ruler of Iran. His cause of death is not known, but Ali-Morad succeeded him.

For most of the band's run, it was composed of sisters Sarah (guitar, lead vocals) and Lizzie Kelly (keyboards, tambourine, backing vocals), as well as drummer John Matthews. The band's sound was inspired by acts such as Mazzy Star and Cat Power, both for their production ethic and the treatment of the lead vocals. On the local front, the band received support from the numerous mid-late 1990s Australian bands who played a brand of atmospheric indie-rock informed by the shoegaze movement of the early 1990s, such as Sounds Like Sunset and Gersey, who gave the band their earliest support slots. The Red Sun Band played with such artists as Cat Power, Magic Dirt, Youth Group and The Panics, and were on the bill for the Big Day Out festival in both 2005 and 2009. History The band originally played as a two-piece, with Sarah on bass and John Matthews on guitar. Serendipitously, the two founding members of the group had previously met at kindergarten. \\"In the class photo we are the two kids at the front holding the sign 'Arncliffe West Public School Year Kindi 1986'\\", wrote Matthews on the band's official site.theredsunband The pair performed in two-piece format before the addition of Kate Wilson on drums, who was followed by David O‚ÄôLeaf (aka David Olliffe, originally of The Vines). Wilson would go on to play with Sydney bands The Laurels and The Holy Soul. The best known line-up of the band came in 2003 after the departure of O‚ÄôLeaf, with Matthews switching to drums and Kelly to guitar. This made way for the addition of Kelly‚Äôs younger sister, Lizzie, on keyboards. Not unlike bands such as The Dandy Warhols, early My Bloody Valentine or The Doors, The Red Sun Band employed keyboard bass, rather than electric bass. The band‚Äôs debut album Peapod was released in 2004 on Slanted Recordings and produced by Magic Dirt's Dean Turner ‚Äì credited as Dean Dirt. It was recorded in St. Kilda at Hothouse Studios, the studio of former Kids in the Kitchen bass player Craig Harnath. On 27 March 2006, Sarah Kelly was awarded the Jessica Michalik Music Endowment by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA).APRA Awards - PDAwards On 24 November 2007 during a live gig at the Northcote Social Club in Melbourne, Sarah announced that John Matthews had quit the band four days previously. The band went on to performed with drummers Joe Hammond, Nicholai Danko & Jasper Fenton. They released their second studio album, The Shiralee, in 2008. In 2009, the band separated permanently. Lizzie Kelly moved to Toronto, while Sarah Kelly remained in Australia, forming The Jewel & The Falcon with Patrick Matthews (John Matthews' brother) and later Good Heavens with former Wolfmother members Chris Ross and Myles Heskett. According to Sarah Kelly, the band's separation came as a result of the departure of John Matthews and the death of Dean Turner.Wilson, Kim. (16 August 2012). \\"Good Heavens: Strange Dreams\\".

Plot A psychoanalyst and his young family and some friends are taken hostage by a gang led by an escaped killer, Al Walker. The doctor gets the killer to talk to him in an attempt to find out the killer's unconscious motivation for his evil ways. Walker relates a dramatic dream he's been having since childhood.

Life Trier was born to a middle class German-speaking Jewish family in Prague. In 1905, Trier entered the Industrial School of Fine and Applied Arts; he later moved to the Prague Academy. In 1906, he entered the Royal Academy, Munich, where he studied under Franz Stuck and Erwin Knirr. In 1910, Trier moved to Berlin where he spent most of his career. Trier married Helene Mathews in 1913; a daughter, Margaret, was born a year later. An anti-fascist, Trier's cartoons were bitterly opposed by the Nazis. In 1936 he emigrated to London. During the Second World War, Trier helped the Ministry of Information produce anti-Nazi leaflets and political propaganda. He and his wife became British citizens in 1947, the same year that they moved to Canada to be near their daughter, who had moved to Toronto with her husband in the late thirties. Illustrations The December 1946 issue of LilliputWorks for the periodicals Simplicissimus and Jugend appeared in 1909. The next year, Otto Eysler, the editor of Lustige Bl√§tter, persuaded him to move to Berlin and work for that magazine; Trier worked for Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung as well. In 1927/1929, Trier was introduced to Erich K√§stner, and he illustrated K√§stner's Emil und die Detektive (Emil and the Detectives). Trier provided the front cover design for every issue of Lilliput from its start until 1949. Each time, the design employed a man, a woman, and a dog. The man and woman were usually young and almost always a couple, the dog was almost always black. It seems the original dog was Trier's. It was run over by a tram and killed, and after that Trier immortalised him in his Lilliput covers; the idea was light- hearted and the settings and styles varied considerably. On his arrival in Canada, Trier started work on illustrations for the company Canada Packers. Exhibitions and murals In 1934 Trier held a one-man exhibition in Prague. Trier also created various murals: in the Kabarett der Komiker at Kurf√ºrstendamm (1929, destroyed by the Nazis in 1933), on the liner SS Bremen (1929), and for Hoffmann-La Roche (Welwyn Garden City, 1938). He also staged designs for Spielzeug (1924) and The Bartered Bride (1931). Trier held an exhibition of oils and water-colours in the University of Toronto in 1951, but died of a heart attack on 8 July of that year. Bibliography=Books by Trier *Brer Rabbit.

Geography Kainakary is famous for its unspoiled scenic beauty. Five rivers originating from the Western Ghats, including the sacred Pamba River, drain into the Vembanad lake in the tip of Kainakary. Once a communist bastion, its literacy rate is notably better than many of its counterparts. The village is blessed with the presence of more than five lakes, which are vast in area. They add to the beauty of this village. Kainakary is a major shooting location for movie/TV soaps/music videos, etc. The village itself has numerous small water bodies, rivers, canals and ponds. People dwell near to canals and river banks mainly. Being part of Kuttanad, vast paddy lands make up the major part of the village. These paddy lands are below sea water level. So the rice cultivation in this area is unique and well appreciated. Floods are another major calamity that can be seen in Kainakary's history. Floods in Kuttanad are expected during every heavy monsoon season in Kerala. And Kainakary is one of the worst affected during these floods. Native people are well accustomed to these hard times, the floods leading to the destroying of crops, damages to houses and buildings. Kainakary is known for its Snake boat race rowers. Economy The major income source of native people is from agriculture and fishing, while income from tourism is increasing. Inland water tourism using small boats, home stays, and resorts is showing tremendous presence in the past few years. Some adjacent, non-major incomes include vegetable gardens, fresh water clam farming, fish ponds, and duck farming during off-crop seasons. There is a practice of working one rice crop during monsoons and fish farming during summer in the same paddy fields around the year. Land reclamation Path-breaking kayal land reclamation projects (agricultural land reclaimed from the Vembanad lake bed), Venad Kayal and Madathil Kayal, are located in the village. This accomplishment opened up a new era for agricultural improvements. This reclamation project was carried out by Pallithanam Mathai Luka of Kainady Village in Kuttanadu. It enabled other large scale reclamation projects in the Vembanadu lake area, making Kuttanadu the rice-bowl of Kerala.  Population  According to the 2011 State Census, the population of Kainakary was 23696 living in 5689 households. The total area is governed as two separate villages namely Kainakary North and Kainakary South.  Places in and around Kainakary  Many localities collectively come under Kainakary. *Thottuvatala *Pallathuruthy *Thomayiram *Pazhupadam *Irumpanam *Somathuram *Arunootampadam *Kuppappuram *Kuttamangalam *Chennamkary *Meenapalli *Venattukad  Transport  The village is 6 km from Alleppey Town and 20 km from Changanassery Town by road. The nearest rail stations are Alleppey (ALLP) and Changanassery (CGY). The nearest international airports are Kochi (COK) - 82 km and Trivandrum (TRV) - 150 km. Ferry services are available to Alappuzha (30 min), Kollam (8 Hrs), Changanacherry (3 Hrs) and Kumarakom (3 Hrs). Road Transportation is not accessible on the eastern side of the village. The inner areas of the village , where roads are still not available is connected through State Water Transport Department (SWTD) Boats. These boards run on regular intervals and costs very less to commute. The starting point for theses services are from Alappuzha Town , and Nedumudy Boat Jetty. Few boats are available through Kainakary from Kottayam , Kodimatha Boat Jetty. Since back water tourism has penetrated into the area, now travelers could hire small boats named 'Shikkara' from various end points of roads. These boats are costly and are billed based on number of hours of usage mostly.  Accommodation  For travelling tourists and quick visitors, handful of home stays and budget to premium resorts are available spreading the village.  Snake boat race  Kainakary is the home village for the most celebrated team in Kerala's Snake Boat Race history, the United Boat Club (UBC).  Tourism - Major Attractions  *1.

Modern Kerala society took shape owing to migrations from different parts of India and abroad throughout Classical Antiquity.Nayar, Balachandran (1974) In quest of KeralaSmith, Bardwell (1976) Religion and social conflict in South Asia, Brill Publishers Kerala traces its non-prehistoric cultural genesis to its membership (around the AD 3rd century) in a vaguely defined historical region known as Thamizhagom -- a land defined by a common Tamil culture and encompassing the Chera, Chola, and Pandya kingdoms. At that time, the music, dance, language (first Dravida Bhasha -- \\"Dravidian language\\". -- then Tamil), and Sangam (a vast corpus of Tamil literature composed between 1,500-2,000 years ago) found in Kerala were all similar to that found in the rest of Thamizhagom (today's Tamil Nadu). The culture of Kerala evolved through the Sanskritization of Dravidian ethos, revivalism of religious movements and reform movements against caste discrimination.Srinivas, Narasimhachar (1980) India: social structure.

Performing arts  Thirayattam -( Bagavathi vellattu ) Native traditions of classical performing arts include koodiyattom, a form of Sanskrit drama or theatre and a UNESCO-designated Human Heritage Art. Kathakali (from katerumbu (\\"story\\") and kali (\\"performance\\")) is a 500-year- old form of dance-drama that interprets ancient epics; a popularized offshoot of kathakali is Kerala natanam (developed in the 20th century by dancer Guru Gopinath). Meanwhile, koothu is a more light-hearted performance mode, akin to modern stand-up comedy; an ancient art originally confined to temple sanctuaries, it was later popularized by Mani Madhava Chakyar. Other Keralite performing arts include mohiniyaattam (\\"dance of the enchantress\\"), which is a type of graceful choreographed dance performed by women and accompanied by musical vocalizations. Thullal, Thirayattam, padayani, and theyyam are other important Keralite performing arts. Thirayattam is one of the most outstanding Ethnic art of Kerala. This vibrant ritualistic annual performing art form enacted in courtyards of \\"Kaavukal\\"(sacred groves) and village shrine.\\"Thirayattam\\",(Folklore Text -malayalam, Moorkkanad Peethambaran) State Institute of language, Kerala Kerala also has several tribal and folk art forms. For example, Kummattikali is the famous colorful mask-dance of South Malabar, performed during the festival of Onam. The Kannyar Kali dances (also known as Desathukali) are fast moving, militant dances attuned to rhythmic devotional folk songs and asuravadyas. Also important are various performance genres that are Islam- or Christianity-themed. These include oppana, which is widely popular among Keralite Muslims and is native to Malabar. Oppana incorporates group dance accompanied by the beat of rhythmic hand clapping and ishal vocalizations. Margam Kali is one of the ancient round group dance of Kerala practiced by Saint Thomas Christians. However, many of these native art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among ordinary Keralites. Thus, more contemporary forms -- including those heavily based on the use of often risqu√© and politically incorrect mimicry and parody -- have gained considerable mass appeal in recent years. Indeed, contemporary artists often use such modes to mock socioeconomic elites. In recent decades, Malayalam cinema, yet another mode of widely popular artistic expression, have provided a distinct and indigenous Keralite alternative to both Bollywood and Hollywood.  Music  The ragas and talas of lyrical and devotional Carnatic music -- another native product of South India -- dominates Keralite classical musical genres. Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma, a 19th-century king of Travancore and patron and composer of music, was instrumental in popularising carnatic music in early Kerala... Additionally, Kerala has its own native music system, sopanam, which is a lugubrious and step-by-step rendition of raga-based songs. It is Sopanam, for example, that provides the background music used in Kathakali. The wider traditional music of Kerala also includes melam (including the paandi and panchari variants), as style of percussive music performed at temple-centered festivals using an instrument known as the chenda. Up to 150 musicians may comprise the ensembles staging a given performance; each performance, in turn, may last up to four hours. Panchavadyam is a differing type of percussion ensemble consisting of five types of percussion instruments; these can be utilised by up to one hundred artists in certain major festivals. In addition to these, percussive music is also associated with various uniquely Keralite folk arts forms. Lastly, the popular music of Kerala -- as in the rest of India -- is dominated by the filmi music of Indian cinema. The most remembered name in kerala music culture is of Great Indian musician Sri K. J. Yesudas.  Literature  Malayalam literature is ancient in origin, and includes such figures as the 14th century Niranam poets (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), whose works mark the dawn of both modern Malayalam language and indigenous Keralite poetry. The Triumvirate of poets (Kavithrayam: Kumaran Asan, Vallathol Narayana Menon and Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer) are recognized for moving keralian poetry away from archaic sophistry and metaphysics and towards a more lyrical mode. Poets like Changampuzha, Cherusseri, Pallathu Raman, and Edappally Raghavan Pillai also contributed to bring Malayalam poetry to the common man. Later, such contemporary writers as Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy (whose 1996 semi-autobiographical bestseller The God of Small Things is set in the Kottayam town of Ayemenem) have garnered international recognition. From 1970 to early 1990s, a lot of Malayalam Novelists and story writers contributed to the Literature of Kerala. The contributions from Thakazhi Sivashankara Pillai, Vaikom Muhammed Basheer P. Kesavadev, Uroob, OV Vijayan, T Padmanabhan, Sethu, Perumbadavam Sreedharan, Kovilan, M. Mukundan, Kakkanadan, Anand and Paul Zacharia, have been remarkable. Significant contributions from poets and songwriters such as Vayalar Rama Varma, P. Bhaskaran and ONV Kurup have influenced contemporary literature. Critics such as Kuttikrishna Marar and M.P. Paul till the sixties and later, M Krishnan Nair, S. Gupthan Nair, M. K. Sanu, Sukumar Azhikode, K.P. Appan, Narendra Prasad and M. Leelavathy have added value by providing critical analysis of the books written during the recent past. Folklore Thirayattam(Pookkutty Thira) The folklore of Kerala includes elements from the traditional lifestyle of the people of Kerala. The traditional beliefs, customs, rituals etc. are reflected in the folkart and songs of Kerala. Kerala has a rich tradition of Folklore. Folklore in this region is a spontaneous expression of human behavior and thoughts. Generally speaking, Folklore could be defined as the lore of the common people who had been marginalized during the reign of feudal Kings. The Keralites have their culture and lore which were mostly part of agricultural. Sowing, planting of nharu (seedling), clearing out the weeds, harvests etc. are the different stages of agriculture which have their typical rituals. Numerous songs and performing arts are accompanied with them. Kanyar Kali, Padayani, Mudiyettu, Thirayattam, Malavayiyattam, Theyyam, Kothamooriyattam, Nira, Puthari, etc. are some of the ritual folklore of Kerala. It was under the rule of Kolathiris, the Kings of Kolathunadu, and they codified the rituals, beliefs, taboos and folk performing arts. Even the dates of specific fertility rituals and folk performances were decided by the Kolathiris of which many are continuing even today. The Theyyam festivals, even now, are conducted as per the dates once fixed by the King. The folk arts of Kerala can be broadly classified under two heads: ritualistic and non-ritualistic. Ritualistic folk arts can be further divided into two: devotional and magical. Devotional folk arts are performed to propitiate a particular God or Goddess. Theyyam, thirayattam, poothamthira, kanyarkali, kummatti, etc., are some of them. Forms like panappattu and thottampattu are composed in the form of songs. In kolkali, margamkali, daffumuttukkali, etc., the ritualistic element is not very strong. Magical folk arts seek to win general prosperity for a community or exorcise evil spirits or to beget children. Gandharvas and nagas are worshipped in order to win these favours. The magical folk arts include pambinthullal, pooppadathullal, kolamthullal, malayankettu, etc. Onam (Malayalam: ‡¥ì‡¥£‡¥Ç) Onam is a harvest festival celebrated extravagantly by the people of Kerala, India. It is also the state festival of Kerala with State holidays on 4 days starting from Onam Eve (Uthradom) to the 4th Onam Day. Onam Festival falls during the Malayalam month of Chingam (Aug - Sep) and marks the commemoration of Vamana avatara of Vishnu and the subsequent homecoming of King Mahabali, who Malayalees consider to be just and fair King who was exiled to the underworld. Onam is reminiscent of Kerala's agrarian past, as it is considered to be a harvest festival. It is one of the festivals celebrated with the most number of cultural elements. Some of them are Vallam Kali, Pulikkali, Pookkalam, Onatthappan, Thumbi Thullal, Onavillu, Kazhchakkula, Onapottan, Atthachamayame etc. Another distinct feature of the festival is 'Ona Sadhya' (Onam Feast) and consists of numerous dishes served on a banana leaf and 'Ona Kodi' (new dress for the special occasion). Usual the Ona Sadhya consist of numerous side dishes along with rice and Ona Kodi is traditional dress. Both are eagerly observed by the youth with excitement. Politics The people of Kerala are very fond of politics. Majority of keralites belong to either one of the political alliances namely United Democratic Front (UDF) or Left Democratic Front (LDF). BJP has good following too. Regional parties such as Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), various factions of Kerala Congress, various factions of Revolutionary Socialist Party and a host of smaller parties add spice to Kerala political scene. Religious leaders have high influence in Kerala political movements. For many Keralites it's nostalgic to remember the political discussions and debates they had done in the chaya kada (local tea shops were youngsters go to sip a cup and read newspapers) in their younger ages.  Modern Kerala society  Being the state with the highest literacy rate and education level in the country, the Kerala society has moved from its agricultural background. Although Kerala remains fairly liberal in its outlook and open to modern ideas, and technological changes, the State largely remains conservative on social issues.  Martial arts and sports  Kerala also has its own indigenous form of martial art - Kalarippayattu, derived from the words kalari (\\"place\\", \\"threshing floor\\", or \\"battlefield\\") and payattu (\\"exercise\\" or \\"practice\\"). Influenced by both Kerala's Brahminical past and Ayurvedic medicine, kalaripayattu is attributed by oral tradition to Parasurama. After some two centuries of suppression by British colonial authorities, it is now experiencing strong comeback among Keralites while also steadily gaining worldwide attention. Other popular ritual arts include theyyam and poorakkali -- these originate from northern Malabar, which is the northernmost part of Kerala. Nevertheless, these have in modern times been largely supplanted by more popular sports such as cricket, kabaddi, soccer, badminton, and others. 'Kochi Tuskers Kerala' playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) is from Kerala. Kerala is home of the football clubs Kerala Blasters, Gokulam Kerala FC, Viva Kerala and FC Kochin.  Calendar  Kerala also has an indigenous ancient solar calendar -- the Malayalam calendar -- which is used in various communities primarily for timing agricultural and religious activities. Elephants in Kerala culture Caparisoned elephants during Sree Poornathrayesa temple festival. The Elephants of Kerala are an integral part of the daily life in Kerala. The elephants are an integral part of the culture and daily life in Kerala. These Indian elephants are given a prestigious place in the state's culture. They are often christened names by which they're known across the entire state. Elephants in Kerala are often referred to as the 'sons of the sahya' and are indispensable for temple festivals. The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala. Sarpa Kavu (meaning Sacred Grove of the Serpent) is a typically small traditional grove of trees seen in the Kerala state of South India. These pristine groves usually have representations of several Naga Devatas (serpent gods), which were worshipped by the joint families or taravads. This was part of Nagaradhana (snake worship) which was prevalent among Keralites during past centuries. It had been practised by nearly every Hindu community in Kerala ranging from Nambudiri Brahmins to tribal communities. Kerala has a large number of temples. The temples celebrate annual festivals which are not only unique to the region but sometimes have features that are unique to each temple. Each temple describes each interesting history behind its creation. In the Malabar, distinct art form called Theyyam attract tourists, and mini carnivals are also held along with temple festivals. Temple festivals are taken up with great pride by the residents and patrons of the temple and celebrated with much ado.

The composition's movements are all based on the musical notes F-A-E, the motto's initials, as a musical cryptogram. Schumann assigned each movement to one of the composers. Dietrich wrote the substantial first movement in sonata form. Schumann followed with a short Intermezzo as the second movement. The Scherzo was by Brahms, who had already proven himself a master of this form in his E flat minor Scherzo for piano and the scherzi in his first two piano sonatas. Schumann provided the finale. Schumann penned the following dedication on the original score: \\"F.A.E.: In Erwartung der Ankunft des verehrten und geliebten Freundes JOSEPH JOACHIM schrieben diese Sonate R.S., J.B., A.D.\\" (\\"F.A.E.: In expectation of the arrival of their revered and beloved friend, Joseph Joachim, this sonata was written by R.S., J.B., A.D.\\").Dietrich (1899), p. 5. The composers presented the score to Joachim on 28 October at a soir√©e in the Schumann household, which Bettina von Arnim and her daughter Gisela also attended.May (1948), pp. 129‚Äì30. The composers challenged Joachim to determine who composed each movement. Joachim played the work that evening, with Clara Schumann at the piano. Joachim identified each movement's author with ease.MacDonald (1990), p. 17. The complete work was not published during the composers' lifetimes. Schumann incorporated his two movements into his Violin Sonata No. 3. Joachim retained the original manuscript, from which he allowed only Brahms's Scherzo to be published in 1906, nearly ten years after Brahms's death.Geiringer (1948), p. 224. Whether Dietrich made any further use of his sonata-allegro is not known. The complete sonata was first published in 1935. All three composers also wrote violin concerti for Joachim. Schumann's was completed on 3 October 1853, just before the F-A-E Sonata was begun. Joachim never performed it, unlike the concertos of Brahms and Dietrich. Steven Isserlis, the English cellist and Schumann aficionado, has transcribed the F-A-E Sonata for cello and piano.

He also played international amateur football for South Africa. Commaille had a very long cricket career as a right-handed opening batsman, first appearing for Western Province in 1905‚Äì06 and not making his final first-class appearance until 1930‚Äì31, when he was playing for Griqualand West. Cricket before the First World War Commaille made a single appearance as a middle-order batsman for Western Province against the 1905‚Äì06 MCC side, making little impression. He returned to the Western Province side as an opening batsman in the 1908‚Äì09 Currie Cup competition, scoring 74 in the match against Border. A few days later he scored 34 and 65 against Transvaal as Western Province beat their rivals by six runs to take the Cup. In the 1909‚Äì10 season, an England team toured South Africa, playing its non-Test matches as Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). The game against Western Province was won by MCC by an innings inside two days, and Commaille scored only 13 and 14 in the two Western Province innings. Despite this modest record, Commaille was picked for the South Africa team for the first Test, batting down the order at No 8 in the first innings and No 9 in the second; he scored just 8 in the first innings but in the second he made 19 and put on 74 for the eighth wicket with Aubrey Faulkner, who made 123. Commaille's adhesive powers were demonstrated again in the second Test. Having failed with a score of just 3 in the first innings when batting at No 9, he was promoted to No 6 in the second innings and scored 30 out of 103 made while he was at the wicket as South Africa amassed a match- winning total after a tie on first innings. There was further promotion up the batting order in the third Test: he scored 39 batting at No 6 in the first innings and then just 2 batting at No 3 in the second. Finally in the fourth Test he was tried as an opening batsman alongside Billy Zulch and responded with an innings of 42, his highest of the series and the highest of the South African first innings; he scored just three in the second innings. He was not successful in the final Test, scoring just four and five as England won easily. In the five Tests, Commaille scored 155 runs at an average of just 15.50. Despite this modest performance, Commaille was selected for the 1910‚Äì11 tour of Australia, the first Test tour of Australia by a South African team. He was not successful on the tour, however, and was selected for only six first-class matches and none of the Tests; in some games he batted as low as No 10 and his highest score on tour was just 29, with an average of only 9.90. Commaille supplemented his cricket with some journalism on the tour, writing an adulatory article about the Tasmanian leg of the tour for The Argus newspaper. He was more successful in domestic South African cricket in 1912‚Äì13 and scored 55 and 103, his first century, in the match against Orange Free State. In 1913‚Äì14, there was another tour of South Africa by an England team; Commaille played in both the first-class matches for Western Province against the touring side, and scored 52 in the second of them, but by this time all the Tests had been played and he had not been picked for any of them. Football career Alongside his cricket career, Commaille was also prominent in South African Association football as both a player and an administrator; in 1913, he was the honorary secretary of the Football Association of South Africa at a time when a triangular Commonwealth series of internationals between England, South Africa and Australia was proposed (and rejected). As a player, he represented South Africa at either outside- or inside-right. Cricket after the First World War Commaille resumed his first-class cricket career with matches against the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team in 1919‚Äì20, and when proper domestic competition returned in 1920‚Äì21 he was immediately far more successful than he had been in any season pre-War. In the first Western Province game of the season against a very weak Border team he made 156, more than the opposing team made in their two innings combined. Later in the season he hit a second century against Griqualand West. There were tours to South Africa by Australia in 1921‚Äì22 and England in 1922‚Äì23, and Commaille played in the Western Province games against both sides, but did not earn a Test recall. In 1923‚Äì24 at the age of 40, he had his best domestic season, with unbeaten centuries against Natal and Griqualand West, and with places still up for grabs on the 1924 tour to England Commaille captained one of two trial sides in an end-of-season match, after which the team was chosen. Commaille's team lost the match to Neville Lindsay's team convincingly, but Commaille was picked for the tour and Lindsay was not. Commaille was not merely a player on the tour to England in 1924; he was vice-captain to Herbie Taylor. Taylor, however, played in every single first-class match on the tour and Commaille's captaincy was restricted to three non-first-class games against Scotland, Durham and a side from North Wales. But he played regularly as an opening batsman, and scored 1118 first-class runs at an average of 25.40 and with a highest score of 85. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote of him that he was a \\"good useful batsman but, though a consistent run-getter, he did nothing out of the common\\". Commaille appeared in all five Test matches. In the first game, Commaille's first Test for 14 years, the South Africans were sensationally dismissed in the first innings for just 30, and Commaille, batting at No 5, was the not-out batsman, though he made only one run; in the second innings, he resumed his more normal position as an opener and made 29 out of 101 runs added while he was at the wicket, as the South Africans totalled 390, still losing the match by an innings. The second Test had a similar result, but more even batting by the South Africans; Commaille was out without scoring in the first innings but made 37, his best of the series, in the second. Commaille's personal pattern for the series was maintained in the third Test, with just four runs in the first innings and 31 in the second. Rain ruined the final two Tests, but Commaille was not successful in either of his two single innings in these matches: he failed to reach double figures in the first innings in all five Tests. In the five Tests, he scored 113 runs at an average of 16.14. Back in South Africa in 1924‚Äì25, Commaille switched allegiance from Western Province to Orange Free State and two years later in 1926‚Äì27 he made the highest score of his long career, an innings of 186 against Natal in which he shared a second-wicket partnership of 305 with Shunter Coen which remains a Free State first-class record to this day. In the following match, the same pairing hit off the 236 runs needed for victory over Eastern Province to set the record for the first-wicket partnership that also remains unbeaten. In 1927‚Äì28, England toured South Africa. Commaille, just a few months short of his 44th birthday, made 77 and 54 in the first-class match between Orange Free State and the English team (playing as MCC). He followed that with a century in a non-competitive two-day first-class game against Natal and was then picked for the first two Tests of the five-match series. In the first match, he scored 23 and 4 in a game of many low scores ‚Äì only 12 out of 35 individual innings reached double figures. In the second game, he followed a first innings of 13 with a score of 47 in the second innings, his best in Tests, and he shared an opening partnership of 115 with Herbie Taylor which constituted more than half the South African total of 224. With the South Africans losing both the first two Tests, however, he was dropped from the team for the subsequent matches in which a series draw was obtained, and he did not play Test cricket again. Commaille continued in first-class cricket for a further three seasons, switching teams to Griqualand West in 1929‚Äì30 and finally retiring after a single game in 1930‚Äì31.

William Langston is the Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, Movement Disorder Specialist, and Chief Executive Officer of the Parkinson's Institute and Clinical Center in Sunnyvale, California, the founding member of the Scientific Advisory Board for the Michael J Fox Foundation and the Co-Editor- in-Chief of the Journal of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease. He is a graduate of the University of Missouri School of Medicine. Langston was formerly a faculty member at Stanford University and Chairman of Neurology at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, California. Langston has authored or co-authored some 360 peer-reviewed articles in the field of neurology, most of which are on Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Langston gained national and international recognition in 1982 for the discovery of the link between a \\"synthetic heroin\\" contaminant (MPTP) and parkinsonism.  Career  In 1982 William Langston was head of neurology at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center when he made a major breakthrough in the research of Parkinson's Disease as a result of several incidents detailed in the book The Case of the Frozen Addicts. Langston continued research into Parkinson's Disease and became an internationally known neuroscientist. He opened the Parkinson's Institute and Clinical Center in Sunnyvale, California in 1988 and became the Chief Executive Officer and Scientific Director. Langston's current research interests include the study of mechanisms of neuronal degeneration, the etiology of Parkinson's disease, and the development of new strategies to slow or halt disease progression such as cell replacement therapy and gene therapy and, more recently, the possible environmental causes of Parkinson's disease such as pesticides, cluster cases and the early identification of sufferers through genome mapping. In 2014 Carrolee Barlow became Chief Executive Officer of the Institute with Langston continuing as Chief Scientific Officer. During an interview in 2009 Langston stated: \\"I would never promise I could solve the disease. What I would do is say, I think there's a very real possibility, with the adequate funding, that we could make major progress on both finding the cause of the disease, which could lead to prevention, and also major progress on finding ways to slow and halt disease progression. I think that's a realistic possibility in my lifetime, my career. I wouldn't have said that five or 10 years ago. A cure, I will not say.\\"  The Case of the Frozen Addicts  The Case of the Frozen Addicts. was written by Langston and Jon Palfreman in 1995. A later edition was published in 2014. The book details the work done by Langston, his colleagues and associates around the world to isolate the neurotoxic contaminant which caused the Parkinson's like symptoms in a number of heroin users and to develop methods of utilising this discovery. The book includes discovery of the dangers to researchers in handling the contaminant and some competition and contention between researchers. William Langston was head of neurology at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in 1982 when a drug offender was admitted who could neither move or talk. He had been admitted from the county jail and initially treated as a malingerer but later admitted to the psychiatric unit with suspected catatonic schizophrenia. During an examination of the patient, Langston noticed his fingers moving, perhaps voluntarily, and wrapped them around a pencil. The patient began to write notes that indicated that his mind was normal but his body was not responding. He had taken heroin before the symptoms developed. Through coincidental personal connections and media presentations another 5 patients suffering the same symptoms were discovered. All had what appeared to be symptoms of advanced Parkinson's Disease. In an attempt to save their lives Dr Langston administered L-dopa, a drug then recently introduced to treat Parkinson's Disease. The patients responded and could move and talk. (Unfortunately all six patients later developed severe side effects.) The common link between the patients was the batch of heroin they had taken. Medical and police research established that the batch of synthetic heroin all six patients had used contained a neurotoxic contaminant, MPTP.Palfreman, p. 44. MPTP (which sometimes taints MPPP, an effective synthetic opioid), is selectively toxic to the same nerve cells in the brain which die in Parkinson's disease, the substantia nigra. The discovery of the biologic effects of this compound led to a renaissance of the basic and clinical research in Parkinson's disease. The clinical implications of this case were ground breaking. Parkinson's Disease is only suffered by humans but animal testing is essential in drug development. Now Parkinson's Disease symptoms could be induced in monkeys by using MPTP and research could begin into drugs to treat the disease. \\"[W]hat had started as a drug tragedy was to open a new chapter of medical research which would offer hope to Parkinson's disease sufferers throughout the world.\\"  Awards  Langston has received numerous awards, including the Distinguished Achievement Award from Modern Medicine, the Sarah M. Poiley Award from the New York Academy of Sciences, the 30th Anniversary Award from the Parkinson's Disease Foundation in 1987, the Distinguished Clinical Investigator Award from Roche Pharmaceuticals, the 1999 Movement Disorders Research Award from the American Academy of Neurology, the 2008 Donald Calne Lectureship and 2012 Robert A.

In music, especially modern popular music a slash chord or slashed chord, also compound chord, is a chord whose bass note or inversion is indicated by the addition of a slash and the letter of the bass note after the root note letter. It does not indicate \\"or\\". For example, a C major chord (C) in second inversion is written C/G or C/G bass, which reads \\"C slash G\\", \\"C over G\\" or \\"C over a G bass\\". If E were the bass it would be written C/E or C/E bass (making a major chord in first inversion), which is read \\"C slash E\\", \\"C over E\\" or C/E bass. Some chords may not otherwise be notated, such as A/A. Thus, a slash chord may also indicate the chord form or shape and an additional bass note. A/A (alternately notated as A Major/A bass) notated in regular notation (on top) and tabulature (below). In popular music, where the exact arrangement of notes is less important than some other forms, slash chords are generally used only when the specific bass note is important. A common example in guitar based music is in the I-V-vi progression, in which the V chord is a passing chord. By placing the third of the V chord in the bass, a descending scale, also known as a walkdown, is created in the bass. For example, in the key of G major this would be the chords G, D/F, Em. That progression has the descending bassline G, F, E. This type of slash chord contains diatonically occurring notes. In traditional Classical notation it would be written using figured bass symbols. Another commonly used type of slash chord in chord progressions is the minor key progression i ‚Äì i/VII bass ‚Äì iv/VI bass ‚Äì V. In the key of A minor, this chord progression would be notated A minor, A minor/G, D Minor/F, E major (or E7). This descending bassline moving diatonically from i to V is a stock feature in popular music that is used in numerous songs. In easy arrangements Some arrangers use slash chords to avoid writing chords more complex than triads, to make arrangements easier to play for beginners. Thus, in a song in the key of C major, when the arranger wishes the chord-playing musicians to perform a ii7 chord, rather than write Dm7 (which some beginners might not be familiar with), the arranger could write F/D. This enables a beginning chord-playing musician to perform a Dm7 chord even if she or he is not familiar with the fingering for seventh chords. The use of slash chords can enable beginning musicians to perform quite complex chords. For example, even though a beginner may not know what a dominant seventh flat ninth chord is, they will be able to play this chord if it is notated in slash notation, as long as she or he is familiar with the diminished seventh chord. In the key of C, a G79 chord could be notated in slash notation as B¬∞7/G (or B¬∞7/G bass). In jazz Some sources notate slash chords with a horizontal line, although this is discouraged as this type of notation can also imply a polychord. While almost all pop and rock usages of slash chords are intended to be read as a chord with a bass note underneath it other than the root of the chord, in jazz and jazz fusion, sometimes a chord notated as F/A is intended to be read as a polychord; in this example, the polychord would be an F major chord (the notes F, A, and C) and an A major chord (the notes A, C, and E) played simultaneously. To avoid ambiguity in a jazz or fusion chart, some arrangers use the notation \\"bass\\" to indicate when the second note (after the slash) is a bass note. Thus, F/A bass indicates an F major chord with an A bass note, whereas F/A may indicate a polychord with an F major chord and an A major chord.

He emerged following the decline of their googly bowlers Vogler and Schwarz in the early 1910s. Although Pegler only played a few first-class matches in South Africa between 1908 and 1910, he was chosen for South Africa's first Test tour of 1910/1911 and immediately established himself as a Test regular, although the extremely hard Australian wickets were as difficult for him as they were for the much-acclaimed \\"googly\\" trio of Vogler, Schwarz and Aubrey Faulkner. Despite taking only seven wickets in the Test series, it was no surprise when Pegler was chosen for the 1912 \\"Triangular Tournament\\" tour. On this tour, Pegler was a resounding success, playing in all but three of the South Africans' thirty-seven first-class matches and in an extremely wet summer being the leading first-class wicket-taker with 189 (eleven more than leading English bowler Colin Blythe). He took twenty-nine wickets in the six Tests despite the fact that South Africa only once bowled through two full innings owing to their being outclassed against both England and Australia. Pegler also did fairly well as a slogging tail-end batsman, scoring for the whole tour 643 runs at an average of over fifteen with his best scores being 79 against South Wales at Swansea and 52 against Northamptonshire's strong attack. Pegler also set a record for the fastest first-class fifty during the 1910/1911 tour when he hit 50 in fourteen minutes against Tasmania.

It might have been expected that Pegler would become the mainstay of the South African bowling attack for years to come, since he was only twenty-four and seemed to have great potential. However, his appointment as a colonial District Commissioner in Nyasaland around this time Sid Pegler meant that Pegler was never able to return to South Africa after playing one match for Transvaal at the beginning of 1913. Consequently, his only Test cricket after 1912 was on the 1924 tour, for which he was not even an original selection but where he was nonetheless much more successful than such bowlers as Buster Nupen, who had acquired a remarkable reputation on matting pitches. During World War I he was awarded the DSO and was wounded three times, once in his bowling arm.Louis Duffus, \\"The South Africans\\", The Cricketer, Spring Annual 1951, pp. 5‚Äì9. After he retired from first-class cricket in 1930, Pegler continued working in the game's administration. He managed the 1951 touring team to England.

A vereda in the Grande Sert√£o Veredas National Park, a national park created in tribute to the book. Grande Sert√£o: Veredas (Portuguese for \\"Great Backlands: Paths\\"; English translation: The Devil to Pay in the Backlands) is a novel published in 1956 by the Brazilian writer Jo√£o Guimar√£es Rosa. The original title refers to the veredas - small paths through wetlands usually located at higher altitudes characterized by the presence of grasses and buritizais, groups of the buriti palm-tree (Mauritia flexuosa),Martius & Spix. Viagem pelo Brasil. 1828, p. 109. that criss-cross the Sert√£o region in northern Minas Gerais as a labyrinthine net where an outsider can easily get lost, and where there is no single way to a certain place, since all paths interconnect in such a way that any road can lead anywhere. The English title refers to a later episode in the book involving an attempt to make a deal with the Devil. Most of the book's spirit is however lost in translation, as the Portuguese original is written in a register that is both archaic and colloquial, as well as full of the author's remarkable neologisms, which makes the aesthetics of the book a challenging task to transpose to other languages. The combination of its size, linguistic oddness and polemic themes caused a shock when it was published, but now it is widely regarded as the greatest work of Brazilian literature and one of the most important novels of Portuguese language literature and South American literature. In a 2002 poll of 100 noted writers conducted by the Bokklubben World Library, the book was named among the top 100 books of all time.The top 100 books of all time, Guardian Unlimited, May 8, 2002  Plot  Grande Sert√£o: Veredas is the complex story of Riobaldo, a former jagun√ßo (mercenary or bandit) of the poor and steppe-like inland of the Rio S√£o Francisco, known as Sert√£o, of the states of Minas Gerais and Bahia in the dawn of the 20th century. Now an old man and a rancher, Riobaldo tells his long story to an anonymous and silent listener coming from the city. The book is written in one long section, with no section or chapter breaks. A facsimile of an original page of the book hanging in the Museum of the Portuguese Language. Riobaldo is born into a middle-class family and, unlike most of his contemporaries, receives an education. This enables him to begin his career as a tutor to a prominent local rancher, Z√© Bebelo, and he watches as Z√© Bebelo raises an army of his own jagun√ßos to stamp out several of the local bandit gangs. Instead, for reasons that are never fully clear‚Äîapparently a desire for adventure‚Äîhe disappears from the ranch and defects to the side of the bandits under the leadership of Joca Ramiro. Due to his excellent aim, Riobaldo becomes a valued member of the band and begins to rise in stature. In the course of the events Riobaldo gets acquainted with Diadorim, revealed later to be someone from his past who used the name, Reinaldo. Diadorim is a young, pleasant and ambivalent fellow jagun√ßo. The two start a profound friendship full of homoerotic undertones. Throughout the book it is hinted that Diadorim is Joca Ramiro's nephew or illegitimate son. Ramiro's men defeat and capture Z√© Bebelo, but after a short trial, Bebelo is released. The war is temporarily over, but news later comes that two of Ramiro's lieutenants, Ricard√£o and Hermogenes, have betrayed and murdered him. As a result, the victorious army splits in two, Riobaldo staying with the current leader, Medeiro Vaz. When Vaz dies of illness, Z√© Bebelo returns from exile and takes ownership of the band (this is actually where the book begins; the previous part is told in a very lengthy retrospective). They survive a lengthy siege by Hermogenes' men, but Z√© Bebelo loses the taste for fighting, and the band is idled for nearly a month in a plague-ridden village. When this happens, Riobaldo mounts a challenge and takes command of the band, sending Z√© Bebelo away. Riobaldo, who has mused on the nature of the devil intermittently since the beginning of the book, tries to make a pact with the devil. He goes to a crossroads at midnight, but is uncertain as to whether the deal has been made or not, and he remains unsure for the rest of the story. He leads his band across a hostile desert and successfully ambushes and destroys Ricard√£o's men and kills Ricard√£o. He then moves against Hermogenes but is surprised; with difficulty and heavy casualties, his army defeats Hermogenes. The climax of the book is a knife fight between the two opposing armies. In the fight, Diadorim kills Hermogenes, but is in turn killed. When Diadorim's body is washed, Riobaldo discovers that Diadorim is in fact a woman, and the mystery of their love is cleared up. Riobaldo resigns command of the jagun√ßos and settles down to a more conventional life. The final musings of the book are regarded as some of the most beautiful fragments of Portuguese language literature. Television adaptation In 1985, the novel was adapted for a TV-miniseries for the Brazilian network Rede Globo.

(December 8, 1923 ‚Äì January 19, 2006) was a Roman Catholic cardinal and Archbishop of Samoa-Apia. Born in the village of Falealupo on the island of Savai'i in Samoa, he was the first Polynesian bishop and cardinal. He was made a Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in the Consistory of 5 March 1973, of the Title of St. Onofrio (St. Humphrey). His father was Taofinu ªu Solomona and his mother, Mau. Education Taofinu ªu was born on December 8, 1923 in Falealupo on Savai ªi island's west coast and attended the village catechism school before entering Moamoa Theological College. He continued his studies first at the Seminary of Lano, on Wallis Island and later at the Society of Mary (Marists) Seminary in Greenmeadows (near Napier, in New Zealand). He was ordained a priest for the Society of Mary (Marists) on December 8, 1954 by Bishop Giovanni Battista Dieter, S.M. He made his profession in the Society of Mary on September 8, 1962. Priesthood After ordination, Taofinu ªu worked at Leauva ªa and Palauli district in Samoa, before going to New York and later returning to Samoa in 1962. Father Taofinu ªu accompanied Bishop George Hamilton Pearce, S.M., the then Bishop of Apia (which was later to become the Archdiocese of Samoa-Apia) to the Second Vatican Council in Rome. He remained in Rome for three months, taking advantage of his time overseas to visit the Holy Land. After serving as Vicar to Bishop Pearce from 1964, Father Taofinu ªu became Vicar General of the diocese in 1966. Bishop On January 11, 1968, he was named Bishop of Apia, becoming the first Polynesian bishop in history. He was consecrated as Bishop of Apia, Samoa by his former bishop George Pearce, who was the new Archbishop of Suva, Fiji. One of his first duties as the new spiritual leader of Samoa's Catholic community was as one of the organizers of Pope Paul VI's November 30, 1970, visit to the Samoan Islands ‚Äì the first and, to date, the only visit by a Pope. During his time as Bishop of Apia, Catholic schools increased as he put an important focus on education throughout his diocese. He established a Theological College for Catechists and Deacons in an effort to evangelize the Faith to all the islands. His work contributed greatly to an increase in priestly vocations in Samoa. As bishop, Taofinu ªu was active in leading the reforms within the Catholic Church in Samoa in which some aspects of Samoan culture were blended with the existing practices. Archbishop and cardinal Taofinu ªu was created a cardinal by Pope Paul VI in the consistory of March 5, 1973. He participated in the 1978 papal conclaves of August, and October. He became the first Archbishop of Samoa-Apia, when the Diocese of Samoa-Apia and Tokelau (as it was then), was elevated to the rank of archdiocese. Liturgical Reform Cardinal Taofinu ªu presided over the first Synod of the Archdiocese of Samoa-Apia, which began on December 7, 1990 and ended on December 14, 1990. After careful discussion and consideration, Taofinu ªu approved six synodal acts from his Commission on Worship, Sacraments and Inculturation.The second of these six acts states \\"O le faaaganuuga o le Tapuaiga auaufaatasi i le Puleaga Faaakiepikopo o Samoa ‚Äì Apia ia faaauauina le tilotilo toto‚Äòa i ai ma le toe iloiloinaina ma o lona faatinoga ia lanutasia i le puleaga atoa\\" or \\"[t]he inculturation of the Liturgy in the Archdiocese of Samoa ‚Äì Apia is to be continually reviewed and reevaluated, and its implementation should be uniform through the archdiocese.\\" As a result of these acts, the liturgies in the archdiocese were vibrant, become more meaningful to the people by making use of the signs and cultural symbols of the people of Samoa. During his episcopate, a new hymnal incorporating old and new hymns for the liturgy was also prepared and published for use through the ecclesiastical province of Samoa-Apia. Retirement and death He retired as cardinal on November 16, 2002 at the age of 79, and died in Apia shortly after midnight on January 19, 2006 at the age of 82. His death was announced during a session of Parliament in Samoa while the Senate in American Samoa observed a moment of silence. He is buried in the cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, in Mulivai village, Apia.

He was born at Newcastle, Natal, and died in Berea, Durban, aged 74. He attended Hilton College. Beaumont was a hard hitting middle-order batsman and a good fielder. His first-class career spanned the years 1908 to 1914 and consisted of 32 matches, most of which were for South Africa during their tour of England in the wet summer of 1912. His first match of importance was for Wanderers when the Johannesburg club drew with a Rest of South Africa team containing S.J. Snooke and A.W. Nourse. He also turned out six times for Transvaal and represented South Africa at Test level in five matches against England and Australia. When playing his natural game Beaumont was a free- flowing batsman but too often he let an over-cautious nature restrict his talent. He scored his only first-class century, 121, whilst captaining Transvaal in a two-day match at Johannesburg against P.W. Sherwell‚Äôs XI in November 1913. But in all first-class matches he built only six scores of 50 or more. His highest Test score was 31, compiled against the Australians at Old Trafford during the Triangular Series of 1912. No obituary for Beaumont appeared in Wisden. He managed an oil company in Trinidad in the 1920s and donated the Beaumont Cup, which was contested by North Trinidad and South Trinidad beginning in the 1925-26 cricket season.Wisden 1972, p. 978.

He is one of the most important representatives of the Beirdd yr Uchelwyr (\\"Poets of the Nobility\\") or Cywyddwyr (\\"cywydd-men\\"), the itinerant professional poets of the period between the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan and c. 1600. Life He was born in c.1420, possibly at Pwllcynbyd farm, near the remote hamlet of Rhydycymerau in the parish of Llanybydder in south-west Wales: he took his bardic name from the nearby forest of Glyn Cothi in the Cothi valley.A 19th century tradition also suggests he grew up in a now vanished house in Cwm Cothi with the unfortunate name of Pwlltinbyd (\\"the world's arsehole\\"). His given name was Llewelyn, but he generally used the name \\"Lewys\\" in his verse, and is more usually known by this name. One of his manuscripts suggests that he may have received some education at Carmarthen Priory, but his early life is otherwise rather obscure.

The White Book of Hergest, compiled by Lewys, and the Red Book of Hergest were once kept here. Lewys lived through the Wars of the Roses, in which he was an adherent of the Lancastrian party, supporting the interests of Jasper Tudor, the Earl of Pembroke, and later of Henry Tudor. He is thought to have witnessed the Lancastrian defeat at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross in the company of Owen ap Gruffudd ap Nicolas, the son of a prominent Carmarthenshire esquire, and subsequently both men spent time as outlaws in Snowdonia.Gruffudd ap Nicolas, National Library of WalesLewys Glyn Cothi, National Library of Wales Although many of his poems are addressed to pro-Lancastrian gentry, he was not above praising Yorkist patrons when occasion demanded it, such as the Vaughan family of Hergest, Herefordshire, with whom his name is often associated. There is a story, originating in a note on a manuscript copy of his poetry, that Lewys settled at Chester and was later ejected from the city by its burgesses for marrying a widow without their consent. Other stories attached to different manuscripts claim that he was instead driven out of the staunchly Yorkist city for making a verse prophecy that Henry Tudor would become king. Although unconfirmed, it seems certain that something occurred to make him a laughing-stock of Chester's citizens and to spur him to satirise them mercilessly in an awdl, describing them as the offspring of \\"eight kinds of intercourse in the bushes\\" (\\"cyw wythryw cyfathrach ‚Äî dan lwyn\\") and calling the vengeance of another Lancastrian retainer, Rheinallt ap Gruffydd ap Bleddyn of Mold, on their heads.See the Dychan i Wyr o Gaer, ed. Fulton, Mapping Mediaeval Chester. A comment given by George Borrow, that Rheinallt actually took violent revenge on Lewys's behalf, is incorrect, as Lewys was actually appropriating a previous Wars of the Roses skirmish with tongue in cheek. Lewys travelled widely in Wales, visiting the houses of various patrons, and seems to have had a particular affection for Anglesey, where he paid tribute to the hospitality he received, writing \\"Gorddu yw brig Iwerddon / gan fwg ceginau o F√¥n\\" (\\"Blackened are the trees of Ireland / by the smoke of the kitchens of Anglesey\\"). He is known to have had at least one son, John, whose death at the age of 5 led Lewys to write one of his most powerful poems, the elegy Marwnad Si√¥n y Glyn, part of which runs, in a translation by the academic and poet Gwyn Williams, as: A tradition states that Lewys, who appears to have died around 1490, was buried at Abergwili, but his place of burial and exact date of death remain unconfirmed. One of his last poems is addressed to Henry Tudor after the latter had been crowned as King Henry VII. Work Lewys was a prolific poet, writing many celebratory poems and elegies: about 230 of his poems have survived in various manuscript sources. Although his strict-metre style is not as polished as some, it has been characterised as \\"fluent and natural\\".Stephens, M. The new companion to the literature of Wales, UWP, 1998, p.436 His work ranges from elaborate poems of praise and devotional verse to broad humour, the latter particularly when begging patrons for various items. He was an accomplished scribe, and is thought to have been responsible for compiling much, if not all, of Llyfr Gwyn Hergest (the White Book of Hergest), an important late-medieval Welsh manuscript which disappeared in the early 19th century (he also added several poems to the Red Book of Hergest, which is now in the National Library of Wales). Lewys was also an expert on heraldry, and compiled several treatises on the subject. The manuscript Peniarth 109, which contains over a hundred of his poems in his own hand, was illustrated by him with the arms of many Welsh noble families. His entire works were published in 1953 through the cooperation of the National Library of Wales and the University of Wales Press Board, and were edited by E. D. Jones.

Such vehicles are distinguished by being moved by the rotation of one or more auger-like cylinders fitted with a helical flange that engages with the medium through or over which the vehicle is moving. Modern vehicles called Amphirols and other similar vehicles have specialised uses. The weight of the vehicle is typically borne by one or more pairs of large flanged cylinders; sometimes a single flanged cylinder is used with additional stabilising skis. These cylinders each have a helical spiral flange like the thread of a screw. On each matched pair of cylinders, one will have its flange running clockwise and the other counter-clockwise. The flange engages with the surface on which the vehicle rests. Ideally this should be slightly soft material such as snow, sand or mud so that the flange can get a good bite. An engine is used to counter-rotate the cylinders‚Äîone cylinder turns clockwise and the other counter-clockwise. The counter-rotations cancel out so that the vehicle moves forwards (or backwards) along the axis of rotation. The principle of the operation is the inverse of the screw conveyor. A screw conveyor uses a helical screw to move semi-solid materials horizontally or at a slight incline; in a screw propelled vehicle, the semi-solid substrate remains stationary and the machine itself moves.  Early developments  Jacob Morath's design for an auger driven agricultural machine, 1899. One of the earliest examples of a screw-propelled vehicle was designed by Jacob Morath, a native of Switzerland who settled in St. Louis, Missouri in the United States in 1868. Morath's machine was designed for agricultural work such as hauling a plough. The augers were designed with cutting edges so that they would break up roots in the ground as the machine moved. An early patent for an auger driven farm tractor. One of the first screw-propelled vehicles that was actually built was designed by James and Ira Peavey of Maine. It was patented by Ira Peavey in 1907; the Peavey family has been famous for its contributions to the lumber industry ever since blacksmith Joseph Peavey of Stillwater, Maine, invented the tool known to this day as a Peavy. The Peavey Manufacturing Co. is still located in Maine. The Peaveys' machine had two pairs of cylinders with an articulation between the pairs to effect steering. At least two prototype vehicles were constructed: one was steam powered the other used a gasoline engine. The prototypes worked well on hard packed snow but failed in soft powder because the flanges had nothing to grip into. The machine was designed to haul logs, but its length and rigid construction meant that it had difficulty with the uneven winter roads for which it was intended. Peavey's invention could not compete with the Lombard Steam Log Hauler built by Alvin Lombard and it was not produced commercially. (The Lombard vehicle was an early example of a half-track vehicle, it resembled a railway locomotive with a sled or wheels in front for steering and caterpillar tracks for traction.)  Armstead Snow Motor  Fordson snowmobile at the Hays Antique Truck Museum, Woodland, California. In the 1920s the Armstead Snow Motor was developed. When this was used to convert a Fordson tractor into a screw-propelled vehicle with a single pair of cylinders. A machine used in the Truckee,CA area was referred to by locals as the \\"Snow Devil\\" and that name has been erroneously attached to these machines, although no known advertising of the time referred to them as such. A film was made to show the capabilities of the vehicle as well as a Chevrolet car fitted with an Armstead Snow Motor. The film clearly shows that the vehicle copes well in snow. Steering was effected by having each cylinder receive power from a separate clutch which, depending on the position of the steering gear, engages and disengages; this results in a vehicle that is relatively maneuverable. The promotional film shows the Armstead snow motor hauling 20 tons of logs. In January 1926, Time magazine reported: An extant example is in the collection of the Hays Antique Truck Museum in Woodland, California. This particular vehicle is said to have been used to haul mail from Truckee to North Lake Tahoe.  The Second World War period  With the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany in World War II, the quixotic Geoffrey Pyke considered the problem of transporting soldiers rapidly over snow. He proposed the development of a screw-propelled vehicle based on the Armstead snow motor.Lampe, 1959, pp. 91‚Äì95. Pyke envisaged that the vehicles would be used by a small force of highly mobile soldiers. The damage and casualties that a small force could inflict might be slight, but they would oblige the enemy to keep many men stationed in Norway in order to guard against every possible point of attack. Pyke's ideas were initially rejected, but in October 1941, Louis Mountbatten became Chief of Combined Operations and Pyke's ideas received a more sympathetic hearing. Mountbatten became convinced that Pyke's plan was worthwhile and adopted it. The scheme became Project Plough and many high-level conferences were dedicated to it.Lampe, 1959, p97. The problem of developing a suitable vehicle was passed to the Americans, and Pyke went to the US to oversee the development. However, Pyke, who could be very inflexible, fell out with various individuals on the project and the Americans moved on to design a more conventional tracked vehicle, the M29 Weasel. In 1944, Johannes Raedel, a soldier of the German Army and veteran of the Eastern Front invented his schraubenantrieb schneemaschine (screw-propelled snow machine). Raedel had seen the problems of operating tracked vehicles in the deep snows of Russia where a tank would dig out the snow under the tracks leaving the tank stuck on the snow compressed under the hull. According to Siegfried Raedel, son of Johannes:  Amphibians  The threaded cylinders are necessarily large to ensure a substantial area of contact and buoyancy. Being lightweight, the cylinders may conveniently serve as floats and the arrangement may be used in the design of an amphibious vehicle. During the Vietnam War, the American Waterways Experiment Station (WES) tested the Marsh Screw Amphibian, designed by the Chrysler Corporation. The counter rotating screws \\"...propelled the vehicle through water and marsh terrain adequately, but failed miserably on soil surfaces, especially sand. The average maximum speed attained on test lanes was a meagre .\\" Despite such disappointing results, Chrysler produced a much larger vehicle, the Riverine Utility Craft (RUC) for the Navy in 1969. The RUC travelled on two aluminium rotors, in diameter. The RUC achieved impressive speeds of on water and nearly on marsh. Again, however, speeds on firm soils proved disappointing, reaching only and crossing dykes proved difficult ‚Äì the vehicle would get stuck. The Soviets built a screw-propelled vehicle, the ZIL-2906, specifically for the challenging task of recovering cosmonauts who landed in inaccessible areas. In the 1960s, Joseph Jean de Bakker was the busy owner of the De Bakker machine factory in Hulst in the southwest of the Netherlands. He was also a keen fisherman, but he did not want his fishing time to be constrained by the vagaries of the tide. His solution was the Amphirol, a screw-propelled vehicle superficially similar to the Marsh Screw Amphibian. The Amphirol was able to convey him over the sticky clay revealed by the outgoing tide and to swim in water at high tide. De Bakker's Amphirol had a top speed of on mud and in water. It was powered by two modified DAF 44/55 variomatic transmission units; this made possible the significant innovation that the flanged cylinders could be deliberately driven in the same direction so that the vehicle could crab sideways on dry land at the alarming speed of . Also, when moving sideways, steering is effected by shifting the front of the cylinders so that they are no longer parallel ‚Äì giving a large minimum turning radius. Amphirols are used for ground surveying, for grooving the surface of newly drained polders to assist drying, and to carry soil-drilling teams. Today modern vehicles, widely known as amphirols, perform specialised tasks such as compacting tailings from industrial processes. The advantage of these machines to tailings densification is that they provide a means to allow water or process liquor to run off without repulping the profile. This approach subsequently largely negates the impact of rainfall on densification and dewatering. However, the lighter, faster machines are better suited to marginal terrain access, but not densification due to repulping and their limited penetration depth. The process of using these machines specifically for tailings and dredge spoil densification is commonly termed \\"mud farming\\" in the mining industry.  Recent developments  The British Ice Challenger exploration team used a screw drive in their Snowbird 6 vehicle (a modified Bombardier tracked craft) to traverse the ice floes in the Bering Strait. The rotating cylinders allowed Snowbird 6 to move over ice and to propel itself through water, but the screw system was not considered suitable for long distances, and the cylinders could be raised so that the vehicle could also run on conventional caterpillar tracks. The Ice Challenger website says that the design was inspired by a Russian vehicle used to pick up cosmonauts who landed in Siberia (perhaps the ZIL-2906). Russian inventor Alexey Burdin has come up with a screw-propulsion system \\"TESH-drive Transformable worms\\". More recently, commensurate with the ever-increasing demand for commodities whilst refinery operational footprints remain within set boundaries, mud farming with the larger machines with deep profile penetration capacity (termed MudMasters by their manufacturer) has proven to be an efficient method for high intensity tailings management.

The college is a Uniting Church school, which traces its origins back to 1923 when it was established by members of the Methodist Church which was founded by John Wesley. Since its foundation, the college has been located on a 19 hectare riverside property, near the banks of the Swan River. The campus consists of a Junior School (Manning House) for Kindergarten to Year 4, a Middle School (Years 5 to 8) and a Senior School (Years 9 to 12), performing arts, sporting grounds and boarding facilities for 150 students. Wesley College is affiliated with the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Australian Boarding Schools' Association (ABSA), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Association of Independent Schools of Western Australia (AISWA), and has been a member of the Public Schools Association (PSA) since 1952. Wesley's sister school is Penrhos College, Perth located in Como.  History  The foundation stone was laid by the Premier of Western Australia, Sir James Mitchell on 11 November 1922. This stone is still visible at the south-west corner of the original building, now known as the J. F. Ward Wing in honour of the school‚Äôs first headmaster. The College began operation in 2 July the following year, with an initial enrolment of 39 boys, and grew steadily in size. This evolution can be traced through the campus architecture which was first extended in 1925 with the construction of a general classroom block, now the RE Kefford Wing. A second storey was added to the original building in 1926, along with various verandahs and a weatherboard library, which have since been demolished. In 1930, J. F. Ward was succeeded as Headmaster by J. L. Rossiter. A number of new buildings were constructed in the 1930s, including the Headmaster‚Äôs Residence (now JS Maloney House), a dining hall, extra classrooms and a gymnasium (now the Hamer Wing). The College joined the Public Schools‚Äô Association in 1952. Rossiter was succeeded as Headmaster in 1954 by Norman Roy Collins. During Collins' 11 years' tenure, construction of the Lych Gate, Memorial Chapel (1960‚Äì61), the boat shed, the science block (1956, 1959), additional classrooms (1955, 1963) and the swimming pool (1963) were completed. Wesley College in 1926 A new Headmaster, Clive Hamer, was appointed in 1965 and served Wesley until 1983. During this period, Wesley took a lead role in the introduction of the Achievement Certificate in Western Australia (1969‚Äì71) and built the boarding houses of Cygnet and Tranby (1968‚Äì70), the HR Trenaman Library (1971), classrooms and balconies around the Jenkins Quadrangle (1972), the Collins Oval (1970) and the Joseph Green Centre (1973‚Äì78). In 1977, Wesley came under the auspices of the Uniting Church which resulted from a joining of the Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational Churches. The first female students were enrolled in 1978 with the opening of a new Junior School on land acquired north of Swan Street. Headmaster's Residence in 1950 Roderic Kefford served as the fifth Headmaster from 1984 to 1996 and continued the extensive curriculum changes associated with a broadening of upper secondary programs beyond university entry and the establishment of Wesley‚Äôs lower secondary structure. The RE Blanckensee Physical Education Centre was opened in 1987 and the original gymnasium was renovated to become the Hamer Wing classrooms. The Preparatory School was also extended towards Mill Point Road in 1994. A site development plan was initiated by John Bednall who was Headmaster from October 1996 to July 2002. This resulted in the refurbishment of the Kefford Wing, the Ward Wing and the Science block, the opening of the Junior School (Manning House) (1999) and Middle School (2000). In August 2003, David Gee was appointed Wesley‚Äôs seventh Headmaster. In 2005, the Design, Technology and Visual Arts Centre was opened at a cost of A$4.5 million. In 2006, the Boarding House was refurbished at a cost of $2 million with bigger rooms and a new security link building. In 2007, construction commenced on the school's biggest project ‚Äì the A$13 million refurbishment of the Joseph Green Centre. It was officially opened on 9 May 2008 during the school's 85th anniversary year. David Gee left the school at the completion of the 2018 school year and was replaced in 2019 by Ross Barron, who was previously the Head of Senior School at Hale.  Bednall controversy  During 2002 it was alleged that John Bednall, the headmaster at the time, had accessed child pornography on the internet. Bednall resigned immediately and a single charge was laid against him which was discontinued in the WA magistrates Court because of a lack of evidence.The Age, Friday April 2,2004 Bednall subsequently sued Wesley for wrongful termination. He later accepted a settlement offer from Wesley College Council, which included a statement recognising that Bednall had acted with the best interests of Wesley students in mind.Supreme Court of Western Australia - Judgement 24 May 2005  Campus  Aerial view of Wesley College campus and Swan River The school is based primarily on its nineteen hectare campus on Coode Street in South Perth which comprises each of the Junior, Middle and Senior Schools. The school also has playing grounds in Como, Collins Oval. Football, soccer and rugby are the main sports that are played on these grounds.  Building developments  The first stage of the school's current masterplan saw the $13 million refurbishment of the Joseph Green Centre as a performing arts and function facility, completed in May 2008. The second stage saw the refurbishment of the Ward and Kefford Wings of the Senior School ($2m) and the Old Boys' Memorial Chapel ($1.5 million). Since 2009 the school has seen the opening of the T.G O'Sullivan Pavilion and a new Languages Centre, as well as a refurbishment of the Hamer Wing and the Mildred Manning Science Centre. Wesley College uniform  Student life  Wesley's students have produced a regular newspaper, The Wesley Inquirer, since 2007. The Old Wesley Collegians Association offers a scholarship to a year 11 student, who has a father or grandfather who attended the college, based on sporting, academic and citizenship, both within Wesley and the wider community. The college offers three scholarships a year to indigenous students from rural and regional areas of Western Australia.  Traditions  The Wesley war cry is used for victories in sporting and other school events. The traditional Wesley send-off is used to \\"send off\\" students involved in major sporting events, and entails the introduction of participants accompanied by students stomping their feet on the wooden floor of the Joseph Green Centre. As of 2010, this has been informally named the \\"Woodsey Stomp\\" in recognition of long serving staff member, Frank Woods, who often received this applause every time he was to take the microphone at assembly. When a well-respected or prominent Wesley teacher retires from the School, a guard of honour is made on the Jenkins Quad.  House system  Wesley College has eight houses in the senior school, Mofflin, Cygnet, Hardey, Tranby, Grove, Walton, Dickson, Jenkins and six in the junior school, Hardey, Mofflin, Grove, Walton, Dickson, Jenkins. Each house is named in honour of an individual who has had an association with the school, including A. H. Dickinson, one of the founders of the school and Joseph Hardey, one of the first Methodists to settle in Western Australia. The eight senior school houses compete for the Klem Cup, named in honour of the first student enrolled at the college, while the middle school houses have events every year as they play for the Kay Cup.  Sport  Wesley has been a member of the Public Schools Association (PSA) since 1952, within which it competes in inter-school sports. Wesley sport is split up into two seasons, a winter and summer season. For summer they have tennis, cricket, water polo, swimming, basketball and rowing. For winter they have soccer, badminton, rugby, Australian rules football and hockey. In 2011 the Wesley College 1st XVIII football team historically won The Alcock Cup breaking a 17 year drought.  Drama  Wesley has had a strong drama program running for many years. One major production is produced by the Drama department each year. This usually takes place in the second term. Productions of Oliver, The King and I, Jesus Christ Superstar have been staged, plus the following in more recent years: *2000 - Lord of the Flies (Year 8 Production) *2001 - Oliver! *2002 - Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat *2005 ‚Äì Berlin to Broadway *2006 ‚Äì No major school production was held. *2007 ‚Äì Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (held at Penrhos College due to Joseph Green Centre Revamp) *2008 ‚Äì Macbeth (Modern and Musical Version) *2009 ‚Äì Little Shop of Horrors *2010 ‚Äì Lockie Leonard: Human Torpedo *2011 ‚Äì Aladdin *2012 - High School Musical *2013 - The Outsiders *2014 - The Wizard Of Oz *2015 - Peter Pan *2016 - Cos√≠ *2017 - The Wedding Singer *2018 - Beauty and the Beast *2019 - Avenue Q - School Edition *2020 - Rent - School Edition  Katitjin  Katitjin is a program partaken by all year 8 students. For the students it is a chance to get out of the classroom and learn within the community. The program is based out of the West Australian Rowing Club on the banks of the Swan River. The program runs for a full term. The name Katitjin is the Nyoongar word meaning \\"to listen and to learn\\".  Wesley Sports Club  Wesley's sporting facilities on the South Perth Campus can be used by members of the Wesley Sports Club and the general public. Formed for members of the local South Perth Community, and the College's students, the club operates the PE Centre including swimming classes, weights training, yoga and other programs.  Australian HPV Super Series (Pedal Prix)  The school has a major involvement in the Australian International HPV Super Series, with the program currently being run by Kyal Rees. The team had been competing in the Busselton round each year since 2014. The 2018 race was their best one ever. The team had rode 209 laps(177.65 km) in the 6 hours race and came first in the Senior School Division and also became the WA Champion School. The team had beat Hale School Dell Orean team by 16 laps.  Notable alumni  The school has produced four Rhodes scholars: R. Rossiter (1935), G. G. Rossiter (1946), M. V. Crockett (1994) and Dustin Stuart (2010). ;Sporting Several alumni of the school have become professional sportsmen. The R.E.

Biography  Kay was born in London, England on March 13, 1972 and raised in various locations including the UK, Barcelona (Spain), and Johannesburg (South Africa). His family relocated first to Los Angeles in 1979, and then to Colorado in 1987. He is the son of \\"Spaghetti Western\\" film director, Gilbert Lee Kay (aka Jos√© Briz). In 1993, Sonny founded the cult independent record label Gold Standard Laboratories, known also as GSL, while attending the University of Colorado at Boulder. During that time he was a member of the pre-screamo band Angel Hair (Gravity Records). In 1996, Kay (and GSL) relocated to Berkeley, California. By this time, he was vocalist with the influential \\"proto-futuristic\\" punk band, The VSS. Kay founded the independent music distributor Bottlenekk Distribution in 1996, which resulted in a rapid acceleration in releases and notoriety for GSL. The label soon became synonymous with bands such as The Locust, !!!, and The Mars Volta. Kay moved to San Diego in 2001 and to Los Angeles in 2003. Between 2003 and 2006 he was vocalist for the punk band Year Future. After GSL ceased operations in October 2007, Kay began devoting his time to making art and graphic design. From 2008 until 2013 he was creative director of Rodriguez Lopez Productions, a record label dedicated to releasing the works of guitarist Omar Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez and various other artists related to The Mars Volta, as well as its \\"parent\\" company, Sargent House.

As a community broadcaster, Casey Radio's role is to provide general local community programming including entertainment, news and information, and aims to \\"inform, entertain and involve\\" its listeners. The station caters to the communities' diverse needs with an eclectic mix, ranging from local council news to sport, country to comedy, retro to modern, rock to rockabilly, and a wide diversity of ethnic and multilingual programmes. The current Association President is Nia McMartin. Broadcast Area Their licence covers an area of 637.6 km¬≤ and 410 514 residents (2017). This includes most of the City of Casey and the City of Greater Dandenong, and eastern parts of the City of Frankston. The transmitter is limited to a maximum 400 watts of power and is located at a former landfill site off Quarry Road in Narre Warren North, Victoria. The Melbourne South East RA1 licence is bounded * north by Noble Park, Dandenong North, most of Endeavour Hills, and Narre Warren North; * north-east by Harkaway; * east by Berwick (and part of Beaconsfield), Clyde North, and Clyde; * south-east by Tooradin (and part of Dalmore); * south by Blind Bight, Warneet, and Pearcedale; * south-west by Langwarrin South, and Langwarrin; * west by Carrum Downs, parts of Patterson Lakes, Chelsea Heights, Aspendale Gardens, Braeside, and part of Mordialloc (north of Woodlands Golf Club); and * north-west by Dingley Village, Springvale South, and Springvale. History Casey Radio began life as Market City Radio in 1983, and the first test transmission was carried out from JC Mills Reserve, Dandenong on 6 May 1984. A further transmission later occurred from the Dandenong Show. After a 2-year hiatus, the station was revived by several early members, particularly life member Fred Harrison (originally from 3RPP), who assisted in the original licence application. Station facilities were established at Fountain Gate Shopping Centre on Magid Drive, Narre Warren in 1987. The frequency allotted for testing was 88.3 MHz, and the test transmissions were broad, extending to the Peninsula and the City of Knox. Some listeners even reported receiving the signal from Coburg and Geelong (which are 42 km and 83 km away respectively). These test transmissions continued four times a year (a week each time). Graeme Lewis and Andrew Tokely formed part of a technical team that oversaw the construction of the original transmission tower in April 1991. A full-time broadcast licence was later granted on 7 July 1991. Broadcasts were originally between 6am and midnight. The station celebrated its officially opening on 30 September 1991, and moved to another location at the shopping complex shortly thereafter. David Lentin (a former Melbourne radio personality and Victoria Police detective, now deceased) became president of the ailing station in 1996. He and longtime volunteer Jim Hines are credited for turning 3SER around, and were responsible for the decision to venture into outside broadcasts at local sporting events. Later in the mid-1990s, the station moved to a location in Narre Warren on the corner of Princes Highway and Webb Street. In September 2002, 3SER FM moved into their current council-owned premises in Cranbourne East known as the Casey Complex. The City of Casey retained ownership but agreed from 2003 to provide financial support and grants in exchange for station presenters highlighting the term \\"Casey Radio\\" during announcements. Webcasting of the signal began on 15 July 2005. In 2007 after almost 16 years, efforts to improve the stations' broadcast signal required building a new comms building and antenna and the disassembly of the old one. This was a joint cooperation between the City of Casey and Telstra. After Mr Lentin took ill in late 2007, Geoff Ablett stepped in as station manager whilst also balancing a few stints as City of Casey mayor. The 2008-09 period was tumultuous for the Cranbourne station, having secured a further 4 years of council funding but still trying to establish \\"transparent management practices\\". Efforts were made to establish a sub-committee, new board members welcomed and salaried staff were employed. 3SER began refreshing its identity and logo, utilising the Casey Radio moniker (to which had a couple of iterations between 2011‚Äì14), and some funds had been put aside to bring a new website to fruition. New station signage at the Casey Complex was installed. The City of Casey quarantined an allocation of $75 000 in funding from the 2017-18 financial year in part due to perceived poor governance and relationship with the council. A report to the council on progress made is due in 6 months, upon which time the held funds may be released. Sport Casey Radio is a media partner of the Victorian Football League and Victorian Premier Cricket competitions, an arrangement that has continued since it began in 1993. The station hosted a special Saturday morning radio program in winter for the VFL, and summer for the Victorian Premier Cricket competition, and then follows this by broadcasting matches of both competitions live on weekends. Currently it broadcasts the S.E.F.N.L. Game of the Day on Saturdays and the VFL Game of the Day on Sundays. Casey Radio also broadcasts from many charity-related sporting events, as well as Indoor cricket, Netball, Baseball (Claxton Shield), Basketball (NBL), Picnic Racing, (Non TAB) Soccer and Boxing.

This design dates back to ancient Greece.Bergstein. Page 21. Greek Actors used to wear these shoes to signify status. These were curial so the audience can be able to identify who is of importance in stage plays. According to the Kennedy Center, \\"tragic actors would don shoes called \\"buskins,\\" or raised platform shoes, to symbolize their superiority over comic actors, who would wear plain socks.\\" Women Wedges for women are more common and often have a sole that is much thicker at the back than at the front, making them high-heeled boots or shoes. Wedgies for women were popularized by Salvatore Ferragamo, who introduced the design to the Italian market in the late 1930s.Bergstein. Pages 20 to 22. The evolution of wedge heels became more and more colorful and outrageous through the 1970s-1990s. Men Men's wedge boots, usually called \\"wedgies,\\" typically have low heels. Men's boots of this kind became popular during the 1970s. They are making a comeback in 2010s.. Fashion is known to come \\"full circle\\" meaning that trends reappear every few years or decades.

There are many styles available under the wedges footwear category; the most common styles are low wedge, t-straps wedge, ankle straps wedge, platform wedge, and closed-toe wedge. High fashion In the high fashion world, Salvatore Ferragamo invented the cork wedge shoe in the 1940s due to the economic sanctions against Italy. Ferragamo could no longer afford to purchase steel for traditional heels. He experimented with pieces of Sardinian cork. It was glued and trimmed until the entire space between the sole and heel was solid.

She was at one time the world's oldest living sculptor. She lived in Cumbria much of her working life. Her most famous work includes Reconciliation (Coventry Cathedral, University of Bradford); Holy Family (Liverpool Cathedral, Gloucester Cathedral); Mary and Child (St. Paul's Cathedral); and Nativity (at Christmas) at St. Martin-in-the-Fields (Trafalgar Square). Biography de Vasconcellos was born in Molesey in Surrey; she was the only child of Hippolyto de Vasconcellos, a Brazilian diplomat and Freda Coleman, an English Quaker. After drawing lessons at Bournemouth Art School, de Vasconcellos studied at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London and, after the award of a Bronze Medal for Design in Sculpture during 1923, she studied in Florence under Guido Calore and Libero Andreotti before enrolling in the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris, where she was taught by Antoine Bourdelle, one of Auguste Rodin's assistants. She first exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Show in 1926, with The Repentance of St Hubert and completed her first major commission in 1929 for the Church of Saint Val√©ry in Varengeville-sur-Mer, Normandy, which included a life-sized reclining figure of Saint Val√©ry under a stone altar. After she returned to England, de Vasconcellos enrolled in the Royal Academy Schools and was placed second in the 1930 Prix de Rome contest. The Hand by Josephina de Vasconcellos, War Memorial Hall, St Bees School. Bronze cast of Reconciliation in Coventry Cathedral During the Second World War de Vasconcellos began working on a number of large sculptures including The Last Chimera, which is now in the grounds of the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh and The Hand, a memorial in green slate to a friend killed in the war which now serves as a war memorial for St Bees School in Cumbria. After the war de Vasconcellos and her husband Delmar Banner established a studio in London, while maintaining their home in the Lake District. A joint exhibition of their work was held in December 1946 at the Royal Watercolour Society Gallery off Bond Street with some larger sculptures, including The Last Chimera displayed on a Piccadilly bombsite. This exhibition helped establish de Vasconcellos in the British art world. She became a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy and at the Paris Salon. In 1948 she became the first female fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors, serving on its council and organising committee, and was also a founding member of the Society of Portrait Sculptors in 1953. Subjects of her portrait busts and sculptures included Lord Denning, Edith Sitwell, Roger Bannister, Norman Nicholson, General Sir William Platt, James Cameron and, in perspex, Tenzing Norgay. Other notable commissions included the Prince of Peace (1950), a war memorial in Aldershot (repaired in 1998). In 1955, with the help of students from St. Paul's School, she created Mary and Child, a work that remains in the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral. In 1959, she was commissioned by the vicar of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square in London to construct a Nativity scene of life-sized figures, which became a regular fixture of the church's Christmas display. In the 1990s she designed a memorial to the pilots who were based near her Lake District home during World War Two. In 1977, the department of peace studies at Bradford University commissioned a sculpture that de Vasconcellos entitled Reunion. After its restoration in 1994 it was renamed Reconciliation and in 1995, to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, bronze casts of this sculpture were placed in the ruins of Coventry Cathedral and in the Hiroshima Peace Park in Japan. An additional cast is in the grounds of Stormont Castle in Belfast. To mark the opening of the rebuilt German Reichstag building in 1999, another cast was placed as part of the Berlin Wall memorial. Throughout her life de Vasconcellos undertook numerous large commissions often carved in a flowing, naturalistic style. This contrasted with the more abstract styles of, for example Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. de Vasconcellos' subjects were frequently religious and many of her sculptures are in parish churches and cathedrals around Britain, including the cathedrals in Blackburn, Bristol, Carlisle, Gloucester, Liverpool, Norwich and Wells and in parishes such as St Bees Priory and St Mary's Church, Warrington. The National Art Gallery in Rio de Janeiro, Sheffield Art Galleries, Glasgow Art Galleries and the Civic Centre in Southampton all hod examples of her work. de Vasconcellos was also an active member of the Royal Society of Sculptors for much of her career. Personal life Escape to Light sculpture by de Vasconcellos at Haverigg. In 1930 de Vasconcellos married the artist and academic Delmar Banner, who was an Anglican lay preacher, and they remained together until his death in 1983 and they adopted two children in 1940. Her husband led her to be received into the Church of England, and the topic of faith came to run through much of her artistic work. The couple adopted two boys, and the family settled in a farmhouse at The Bield in Little Langdale in the Lake District, where she made a studio in an outhouse. de Vasconcellos and her husband were also god-parents to at least 20 children. In 1967, through associations with Pelham House School in West Cumbria, the family helped found the Beckstone Centre, an Outward Bound-type facility for disadvantaged boys at Beckstones in the Duddon Valley. In 1975, she initiated the founding of The Harriet Trust, on the Duddon Estuary at Millom so that disabled children could enjoy nature holidays within a purpose-built dwelling; the modified former fishing trawler The Harriet was used as a recreation space. It was such work, rather than her sculpture, that led to de Vasconcellos being awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1985. Last years In 1988, illness forced de Vasconcellos to leave Little Langdale, and for a time she was accommodated at Isel Hall near Cockermouth. She was able to find a small cottage and studio at Peggy Hill, Ambleside. She continued her creative work well into her 90s, her final piece, Escape to Light, was created in 2001 to commemorate the men of the Independent Off-Shore Rescue Service; it is located at Haverigg on the Cumbrian coast. De Vasconcellos died at 6 am on 20 July 2005, a few months after her 100th birthday, at the Orchard Lodge nursing home, Blackpool.

After the release of Child of the Ghetto, Coleman had a long-time struggle with PCP addiction. In 2008, Coleman told XXL about his substance abuse problems and rehabilitation. At the time of his latest arrest Coleman was in Narcotics Anonymous' twelve- step program.  Murder case  On December 15, 2010, Coleman walked into 25th Precinct to turn himself in. He confessed to a cold case crime, a murder of a Queens man in 1993. Coleman had attempted to confess twice before, but was previously considered to be under the influence of drugs and incoherent. On October 19, 1993, John Henkel was shot in the chest by a .40-caliber handgun outside of James Weldon Johnson Houses on Park Avenue and East 114th Street. Coleman stated that he ambushed and shot Henkel during an attempted robbery and fled the scene throwing his weapon into the East River. Coleman's information matched with the case and he was charged with murder. He is currently incarcerated at the Elmira Correctional Facility, located upstate in Elmira, NY. Coleman told in an interview that he confessed because the case weighed on him and he was \\"just trying to get things right between himself and God\\". Coleman claimed that he did not know that his victim died. Sean Combs commented on G. Dep's situation on Sirius' Shade 45 radio show, saying Coleman did the \\"right thing\\" by confessing. Coleman pleaded not guilty to second- degree murder at his appearance in New York Supreme Court on January 13, 2011. He was convicted of the second-degree murder charge on April 17, 2011 and was sentenced to 15-years to life in prison on May 8, 2011.

It is widely used in the manufacture and repair of aircraft to form a light but strong filler for aircraft wings. The foam is used to surround aircraft fuel tanks to reduce the chance of fires caused by the penetration of incendiary projectiles.Ballistic Evaluation of Aircraft Explosion Suppression Materials Ballistic foam is a type of polyurethane foam placed in the dry bays of aircraft. Ballistic foam prevents fires, adds strength to the structure, slows down the speed of shrapnel during attacks, and offers cost-effective protection. Ballistic foam is placed in the dry bays to provide a barrier between the spark and the fuel. As bullets or shrapnel penetrate the mold line skin surrounding the outermost portions of the dry bay, the ballistic foam deprives sparks of oxygen. Thus when the article punctures the fuel tank, a fire is not started. Not only does the foam displace oxygen, but all gases, including explosive vapors which could magnify the destructive effects of ballistic attack. Dry bays, voids, may also contain ‚Äúonboard ignition sources‚Äù like hot surfaces and electrical sparks which benefit both from a lack of gases and the fire-retardant nature of the foam. Ballistic foam strengthens aircraft by protecting it from fire as well as fluid while adding very little weight. The protection from fluid involves resisting damage by ‚Äúmoisture, hydrocarbon fuels, hydraulic fluids, and most common solvents‚Äù. The density of the foam varies with the type being used; Type 2.5 is a white to light amber foam weighing 2.5 pounds per cubic foot, while Type 1.8 is a pale blue to green foam weighing 1.8 pounds per cubic foot. Chopped fiberglass strands embedded in the foam add to the structural integrity through physical support and shrapnel mitigation. The layer that strengthens the foam in turn strengthens the airframe. The layer of fiberglass also prevents shrapnel and bullets from rupturing the foam. The fiber glass then allows the damage caused by projectile penetration to heal more effectively. The passive protection afforded by ballistic foam is very simple and inexpensive compared to active protection. One method of active protection is done by filling large dry bays with inert gases which will not sustain a flame. This process is very expensive and complex. Active protection only offers a ‚Äúone time‚Äù chance for ballistic protection while the ballistic foam is always available.

As its name implies, astrological transits involve a method of interpreting the ongoing movement of the planets as they transit the horoscope. This is most often done for the birth or Natal Chart of a particular individual. Particular attention is paid to changes of sign, or house, and to the aspects or angles the transiting planets make with the natal chart. A particularly important transit is the planetary return. This occurs when a transiting planet returns to the same point in the sky that it occupied at the moment of a person's birth. What this means is that the planet has completed a whole circuit of the sky, and signifies that a new cycle in the person's life is beginning. The most significant returns are those of the outer planets Jupiter and Saturn. The Jupiter return occurs approximately every 12 years and heralds a new phase of growth and development. The Saturn return occurs approximately every 30 years, and heralds a new phase in the aging process when new realities and responsibilities must be faced. Predictive astrology Astrological transits are a part of what is usually called predictive astrology, the claim of astrology to predict or forecast future trends and developments. Most astrologers nowadays regard the term 'prediction' as something of a misnomer, as modern astrology does not claim to directly predict future events as such. Instead it is claimed that an astrological pattern with regard to the future can correspond with any one of a variety of possibilities. What is in fact foretold is the trend of circumstances and the nature of the individual's reaction to the situation. In other words, progressed and transiting movements of the planets indicate phases in the individual's life when the potential shown in the natal chart will be given opportunities for development, whether through favourable or unfavourable circumstances.Jeff Mayo, Ibid, p141, 1979 In addition all modern astrologers stress the role of free will. It is asserted that astrology does not reveal fate or patterns which are 'written in stone', rather it reveals a person's strengths and weakness, talents and opportunities. The horoscope does not determine the future, but shows the possible paths that lie ahead so that the individual can choose between them.Maritha Pottinger, Astro Essentials , pV, p 7 ACS Publications, San Diego, 1991 Modern astrologers argue that no planetary aspect brings a fate that cannot be counteracted in some way and some benefit derived from it - what actual events happen are largely dependent upon the freedom of choice of the individual.Jeff Mayo, Ibid , p5, p141, 1979 The role of the astrologer is to create self-knowledge and awareness of the movement of the planets and their meaning, so as to give the individual an improved ability to make reasoned and sensible life choices. In short, no modern astrologer would try to predict actual future events, or claim that the future was mapped out and determined. Skeptics of astrology argue in response that stressing the role of vague, general trends and developments allows astrologers to avoid making verifiable predictions; and gives them the ability to attach significance to any number of arbitrary and unrelated events in a way that suits their purpose. Interpretation Interpretation of transits is usually fairly similar to the interpretation of progressions. In general however, transits primarily involve developments in the life circumstances outside the individual's control, while progressions involve psychological developments from within the individual. The most important point to remember with transits is that the pattern of the natal chart always determines their value. So, for example if the sun and Jupiter are in a difficult aspect in the natal chart, a positive or easy aspect between transiting Jupiter and the natal sun will not produce the same expected benefit. Also, if planets are not aspected in the natal chart, transiting aspects will in general not have the same effect. In short each person carries the pattern of the natal chart with them all their lives, and the progressed and transiting movements of the planets indicate when the potential in the natal chart will be given opportunities for development. Transits of the personal planets ‚Äì Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars ‚Äì are usually not considered as important because they move so quickly through the zodiac. The transits of the slower moving planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto ‚Äì are more powerful and noticeable, especially when they hit a personal planet or cardinal point. Transiting planets' aspects The main significance of transiting planets is when they form aspects with planets in the natal chart. Transiting aspects are usually limited to an orb of one degree either side of the natal planet. The following is a brief description of the effect of transiting aspects: Inner planets Transits of the inner planets (including sun and moon) are generally not considered by astrologers to be of major importance, as they are of such short duration, and so have a limited effect. Most astrologers would not chart these transits on an ongoing basis as they occur so frequently and are so fleeting in their operation. The following are their main characteristics: * Transiting Sun is at its peak for about two days and has an effect on health, energy and willpower in the area of life indicated by the natal planet, sign and house being transited. Greater creativity, activity and open expression. * Transiting Moon lasts a few hours at most and affects mainly moods and feelings, not always consciously, according to the planet, sign and house being transited. * Transiting Mercury is at its peak for only a day or two. A useful time for helping with backlogs of correspondence, making short journeys or visits. Thought patterns and focus will be altered positively or negatively depending on the nature of the aspect and aspected planet. A good time to write letters, e-mail, make phone calls and generally communicate with others. Combined with Venus, a Mercury transit can indicate entertaining, or perhaps giving a talk or lecture. Mercury transits to natal sun and ascendent indicate a good time for making minor changes - buying, selling and exchanging things. * Transiting Venus is at its peak for about two days, and usually indicates enjoyment in your social life and feelings of love. Social behavior will be altered. Sometimes the influence is financial through receiving gifts or money. Transits to the sun and ascendant indicate a good time to buy new clothes or to beautify yourself, and transits to the moon a good time to beautify the home and buy new household goods. Transits to Mercury and Jupiter indicate a good time to entertain, and transits to its own place and to the midheaven, a good time to be entertained. Transits to Neptune are a good time to go to the cinema or theater, while Uranus transits are favorable for taking chances in romance! * Transiting Mars energizes the areas of life related to the natal planet being effected. The person will be more energetic and be able to work harder than usual. But Mars can also promote tension and anger, so there is a need to watch the temper during a Mars transit, especially for transits with the moon. Plan to keep busy during a Mars transit so as to have an outlet for this excessive energy. There is also a need to take extra precautions against rushing and accidents. Be on especial guard when Mars transits the sun or the ascendant. Outer planets The transits of the outer planets are considered to be the most important by astrologers, as their effects can last for up to several years. The following are their main characteristicsJeff Mayo, Ibid, pp 142 - 143 * Transiting Jupiter Lasts some months and presents opportunities in the area of life involved by the aspected planet. Period of expansion and exceptional opportunities for achieving success in business, receiving benefits, good favour. Travelling, knowledge and new experiences are possible. Difficult aspects may lead to serious misjudgments, exaggerated, extravagant behaviour and sheer bad luck. * Transiting Saturn Period of limitation, restriction, possible ill-health, depleted energy, losses, depressive moods, death, lack of cooperation, general misfortune. Respect and social status will be affected. Yet can also be a useful time for wise long-term planning, conserving energy, building up resources, study, serious contemplation of life and self. Patience will be needed as this is not a time to push ahead with plans and affairs, and forcing matters will not do much good. It is better to accept that this aspect will slow down the rhythm of life in the house or planet involved, showing which lessons of discipline and structure must be learned. A time to consolidate and prepare for more go-ahead indications in the chart. * Transiting Uranus Period of unplanned, sudden drastic upheavals and changes can be expected. Dramatic turn to circumstances, with a new way of life opening. Possible period of inspiration, originality, creativeness, unconventional and rebellious behaviour. Greater desire for individuality, invention, expression and freedom, and new relationships are possible. * Transiting Neptune Peculiar, strange, confusing and chaotic happenings likely, but also great creativity and inspiration. Neptune dissolves ideas and emotions in the house or planet which is aspected. Diffusion and idealization tends to occur and a tendency to fall into illusions or dreams. Spiritualization of the arena of life involved occurs, artistic practices, theater, spiritual or religious experiences are possible at this time. Difficult aspects may stimulate neurotic, escapist, suicidal and mentally disturbed tendencies. Victimization, delusions, misunderstandings or saviour roles are possible at this time, and over-involvement with alcohol, drugs. * Transiting Pluto Period of major transformation in the life-pattern. Often the end of a 'chapter of experience' for the start of another, due to eruptive developments that have 'brewing up' under the surface for some time. Pluto will transform, renew and revolutionize the ideas or emotions in the house or the planet which is aspected. Deep psychological changes occur, cycles of either symbolic or real death and rebirth, obsessions, fateful encounters, power urges, power struggles and sexual issues. Old issues from past come to surface. Pluto exposes these issues so that their nature may be understood and the subject work to change them. Retrograde motion The retrograde motion of a planet is its apparent backward motion through the sky caused by the Earth travelling past a slower-moving outer planet, or when the Earth is itself passed by a faster-moving inner planet.Sasha Fenton, Ibid, p145, 1991 The outer planets are retrograde for over 40% of the time. In astrology, this backward movement was traditionally thought to be unlucky or inauspicious, as it went against the 'natural' order of movement (or 'direct movement' as it is known). Most modern astrologers consider the retrograde movement of a planet to be malefic, indicative of stress or difficulty. For example, the retrograde movement of Mercury is commonly thought to signify difficulties in communication, such as post or emails going astray, verbal misunderstandings, and travel delays and frustrations. Some astrologers however, do not regard the change from direct to retrograde motion as automatically being one to repression and limitation (nor the reverse sudden release). Rather a change in either direction of movement is regarded by them as simply indicating a shift in a person's handling of that part of their life.Maritha Pottinger, Ibid, pp402‚Äì3 1991 A transiting planet may pass over a particular spot in a natal chart and then turn retrograde, passing over the same spot again before it then goes 'direct' again, passing over the spot for a third time. This can bring a prolonged period of change into the person's life. Planetary returns The planetary return in astrology is when the transiting planet returns to the precise position it was in at the moment of a person's birth. Symbolically this means that the planet is beginning a new cycle in a person's life. Returns apply also to the sun and moon - an astrologer would say that a person's birthday is technically their 'solar return'; for it marks the day when the sun returns to the same position in the zodiac as on a person's original birthday. The most important returns are those of the outer planets Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.Derek and Julia Parker, Ibid, pp176‚Äì7, 1990 Half- returns (when the planet reaches the halfway point in its journey) are also important, especially in the case of Uranus, as many people may not live long enough to see or get the full benefit of its full return of 84 years. ;Jupiter returns Jupiter returns occur every twelve years or so, and indicate a new phase of growth and development in life. The first Jupiter return, at around age twelve, concerns the move into adolescence and puberty; while the second return at around age 24 concerns the first real moves into the adult world. The year of a Jupiter return will usually be a good one, with prizes won and grants awarded. Writers are often first published in this year, and sports people achieve their first important goals. Foreign travel and higher study are often indicated. The Jupiter return is the ideal time to push forward and be assertive, as efforts will usually be well rewarded. ;Saturn returns Saturn returns occur approximately every thirty years and indicate a phase in the aging process when new realities and responsibilities must be faced. The first Saturn return occurs at around age thirty and concerns the time when the first real responsibilities are felt. Many people will make a serious commitment at this time, perhaps to (or from a) marriage, starting a family or buying a home. It is also a time when many assess relationships that have failed and realise that it is time to end them. As regards work, many will reassess their career and question their progress to date. This can be a good time to change direction and retrain, even at the cost of a lower salary for a while. The second return occurs at around age fifty nine and concerns the time when people reassess the next phase of their lives. Many people begin to consider retiring from full-time work and developing interests that have been neglected because of career and children. It is also the first time that many have to face the reality of approaching old age. It is important to have a constructive, practical attitude at this time, and not simply regard oneself as being 'on the scrapheap', as for most people there are still many good years ahead. The Saturn return is often a difficult and challenging time, but decisions taken and changes made usually work out well in the long term if they are sensible and followed through with. ;Uranus returns Uranus takes about 84 years to complete a full return. However, one of its most important influences is felt when it reaches the halfway stage in its journey, at around age 42. The Uranus half-return is the origin of what for many people is the 'mid-life crisis'. Women, especially those with children growing up and leaving home, may feel that life has passed them by. A lot of women also begin the pre-menopause stage at this time, and many men experience the 'male menopause'. Permanent and successful long-term relationships may be unsettled or disrupted by casual flirtations and affairs. The Uranus half-return can be stressful and tense, but also energising. It is the ideal time for people to break out of routine lifestyles that they have been stuck in for years, and develop new interests. The full Uranus return takes place around age 84, and if the person is reasonably well and fit, it can herald a new and lively interest in life. For example, many creative people have completed great works after the age of 84 - Verdi composed his opera Falstaff, and Picasso painted many of his finest paintings late in life.

Traditor, plural: traditores (Latin), is a term meaning \\"the one(s) who had handed over\\" and defined by Merriam-Webster as \\"one of the Christians giving up to the officers of the law the Scriptures, the sacred vessels, or the names of their brethren during the Roman persecutions\\".. It refers to bishops and other Christians who turned over sacred scriptures or betrayed their fellow Christians to the Roman authorities under threat of persecution. During the Diocletianic Persecution between AD 303 and 305, many church leaders had gone as far as turning in Christians to the authorities and \\"handed over\\". sacred religious texts to authorities to be burned. Philip Schaff says about them: \\"In this, as in former persecutions, the number of apostates who preferred the earthly life to the heavenly, was very great. To these was now added also the new class of the traditores, who delivered the holy Scriptures to the heathen authorities, to be burned\\". Later, some of them would be returned to positions of authority under Constantine, sparking a split with the Donatist movement. While many church members would eventually come to forgive the traditors, the Donatists were less forgiving. They proclaimed that any sacraments celebrated by these priests and bishops were invalid.A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines The sect had particularly developed and grown in North Africa. Emperor Constantine began to get involved in the dispute and, in 314, he called the Council of Arles, Gaul, now in France. The issue was debated, and the decision went against the Donatists.. The Donatists refused to accept the decision of the council. Their \\"distaste for bishops who had collaborated\\". with Rome came out of their broader view of the empire. Held out as a counterexample to the traditors was the venerated Saint Vincent of Saragossa who preferred to suffer martyrdom rather than agree to consign Scripture to the fire. He is depicted in religious paintings holding the book whose preservation he preferred to his own life. The word traditor comes from the Latin transditio from trans (across) + dare (to hand, to give), and it is the source of the modern words traitor and treason. The same derivation, with a different context of what is handed to whom, gives the word tradition as well.

Biography  The sister of artist-designer Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh, she was born in Kidsgrove, Stoke on Trent, and moved to Glasgow with her family in 1890. Both sisters enrolled in painting classes at the Glasgow School of Art in 1891, where they met the young architects Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Herbert MacNair. Frances went on to marry MacNair in 1899, and Margaret married Mackintosh in 1900. After they met, they exhibited together in a 'School of Art Club' exhibition and due to their similar stylistic approach came to be referred to as \\"The Four\\". In the mid-1890s the sisters left the School to set up an independent studio together. They collaborated on graphics, textile designs, book illustrations and metalwork, developing a distinctive style influenced by mysticism, symbolism and Celtic imagery. Frances also produced a wide variety of other artistic work, including embroidery, metalwork panels and water colour paintings. Like her sister, she was influenced by the work of William Blake and Aubrey Beardsley and this is reflected in her use of elongated figures and linear elements. The sisters exhibited in London, Liverpool and Venice. In 1899 she married MacNair and joined him in Liverpool where he was teaching at the School of Architecture and Applied Art. The couple painted watercolours and designed interiors, exhibiting a Writing Room at the International Exhibition of Modern Art in Turin, and Frances began teaching. They also designed the interiors of their own home at 54 Oxford Street. In the early 1900s they also exhibited in Liverpool, London, Paris, Venice, Vienna and Dresden. The closure of the School in 1905, and the loss of the MacNair family wealth through a business failure, led to a slow decline in their careers, and they returned to Glasgow in 1909. In the years that followed, Frances painted a series of symbolist watercolours addressing the choices facing women, such as marriage and motherhood. Frances and Herbert had a son, Sylvan, born in June 1900 and who later emigrated to Rhodesia. Sleeping Princess, 1909. Frances' achievements are less well known than those of her sister, due in part to her departure from Glasgow, but also because her husband destroyed many of her works after her death. Both sisters works were also frequently overshadowed by the achievements of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Frances died in Glasgow in 1921. Much of her work that remains is held by the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, and in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.

Founded in 1908 as Government English School (G.E.S.), it is also one of the country's oldest English-medium schools. The students of Kolej, are mostly boys as Forms 1 to 5 are for boys only, and the Lower and Upper Sixth Forms are co-educational. There were only 50 students back in the year 1908 and by 2007 more than 1200 students were enrolled. The school is fondly known as \\"Kolej\\" to the people of Alor Setar and also Kedah as a whole. Students of this school are proudly known as \\"Collegians\\". The school's yearly magazine, Darulaman (\\"the abode of peace\\"), takes its name from the state of Kedah's honorific title. The school celebrated its 100 years in existence in the year 2008 and the Sultan Abdul Hamid Old Collegians' Association(SAHOCA) has built a new hall, the Dewan Centennial Sultan Abdul Halim in the school to commemorate the 100 year celebrations. The hall was officiated on May 18, 2016 and is named after His Royal Highness, Seri Paduka Baginda Yang Di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia (Supreme King of Malaysia), also the present Sultan of the state of Kedah, Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Badlishah who was also named the \\"Collegian of the Century\\" during the school's 100 year celebrations in 2008. History=The First School In 1908, before Kedah came under British protection, the state's government appointed Mohamad bin Iskandar, a senior teacher at the Penang Free School and the father of Mahathir Mohamad (fourth Prime Minister of Malaysia), as the first headmaster of the \\"Government English School\\" (GES), which was the state's first English school. The school was housed in a wooden building between the Alor Setar High Court building (now known as Galeria Sultan Abdul Halim) and the Balai Nobat facing the junction of Jalan Baru (now known as Jalan Putera). The small building, which could accommodate no more than 50 pupils, had previously been the office of Chief Minister Wan Md Saman, who was instrumental in the construction of the Wan Md. Saman canal. In 1910, Mohamad bin Iskandar resigned and returned to the Penang Free School leaving the G.E.S. in the hands of Md. Salleh. Ismail Merican, another Senior Assistant Master at the Penang Free School, was appointed Headmaster the following year. The student body had grown to 97, more than the building could accommodate, so some classes had to be held in the open air. The Second School In 1911 the school moved to a private house in Jalan Penjara Lama. Here also the accommodation was insufficient for the number of pupils, who occupied cubicles in the small, dark rooms, with many seated on the floor. By 1912 there were 160 boys enrolled. The school expanded its teaching staff, and now taught up to Standard Four. The shortages of accommodation and trained staff made teaching to a higher standard impossible, so that when pupils had attained Standard Four they enrolled in either the Penang Free School or the Malay College, or sought employment. The majority preferred to work since they could find good jobs with a Standard Four qualification. The Present Building The prime building of SAHC For the site of the present building, Che Md. Ariffin (Secretary to the Government), and Che Ismail Merican (Headmaster of the school) selected an area of about at Tanjung Bendahara. Construction, which began in 1915, was completed in late 1916. The building consisted of a two-storied structure in the centre with two classrooms on each side. Provision was made for future expansion, allowing adequate space for playing fields and more classrooms to accommodate over a thousand pupils. The school was formally declared open on January 1, 1917, and E.A.G. Stuart, who was the headmaster and also Superintendent of Education, had his office in the central building. By 1917 there were 223 on the roll with a staff of eleven including the Headmaster. There were trained teachers, and Stuart trained the others himself, as teacher training had not yet started in Kedah. The Stuart Library, Est. 1930 Stuart had the task of running two rapidly growing establishments at the same time. By 1923 he was finding it difficult to cope alone, so E.C. Hicks was appointed as his assistant. By 1926 over 400 pupils were enrolled, and the government appointed a committee to make recommendations for future English education in the state. This committee members were Stuart, S. Dennys, E.A.P. Helps, Tunku Mohamed and Tuan Syed Mohamed Idid. They recommended, among other things, that English education should be provided to 800 boys, of whom 640 should be Malays. Stuart relinquished his post as Headmaster to devote all his time to the Education Office, which occupied the top floor of the Post Office from 1926 until 1935. Hicks took over as Headmaster in late 1926. Stuart died the next year at Pulau Tikus Sanatorium, Penang, and soon afterward the college built a library and named it after him. Co- education Since its early days, the college had allowed co-education. After World War II, more girls were admitted, and in 1953 the Darulaman Magazine commented: \\"Owing to the shortage of teachers and the small number of students in Kampong Baru Girls' School (KBGS), co-education has been introduced into the Sultan Abdul Hamid College (SAHC) in 1948. KBGS sent only students of Standard Seven. They were Kalsom and Swee Eng, but towards the end of the year Che Zaidah joined them.\\" In 1949, four Malay girls enrolled, among them Tunku Sakinah, the daughter of the Sultan of Kedah. In 1950, 11 enrolled. In 1951 the intake dropped because the headmistress of KBGS sent only those she considered the best. By the beginning of 1952 only eight girls were left. In 1953 the figure rose again to 19, making a total of 24 girls in Standard Seven. In 1954 the college started Sixth Form tuition and three more girls enrolled.

It is a breakaway faction of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP). It was officially registered on 19 January 2006. The party is led by Charles Margai, the son of Sierra Leone's second prime minister Sir Albert Margai and the nephew of Sir Milton Margai. The PMDC is based in the country's second largest city of Bo. 2007 Presidential Election Margai, as the PMDC's candidate in August 2007 presidential election, received third place, behind Ernest Bai Koroma of the opposition All Peoples Congress (APC) and Solomon Berewa of the SLPP. On August 19, Margai stated his support for Koroma in the second round of the election.\\"In Sierra Leone, Margai endorses Ernest Koroma at his 62nd Birthday Party\\", Awareness Times, August 19, 2007. On August 20, the PMDC's Karamoh Kabba explained what he said was the reasoning behind the decision: the PMDC sought to \\"ensure a more representative government, the survival of the PMDC as a political party and the creation of a third formidable political force for smooth running of democracy in Sierra Leone\\". Furthermore, backing the APC would help to bridge the regional political divide marking Sierra Leone's politics (the SLPP and PMDC draw their main support from the south, while the APC draws its main support from the north), while backing the SLPP would deepen it. He added that the APC had a natural reason to want the PMDC to survive, while the SLPP had a natural reason to want to destroy it.\\"'Why We Went APC' - PMDC's Karamoh Kabba Speaks\\" , Awareness Times, August 20, 2007. Margai's support for the APC provoked controversy in the PMDC, with some feeling that his decision was made without properly consulting the party.Peter Clottey, \\"Some Executives of Sierra Leone‚Äôs Opposition PMDC Unhappy\\", VOA News, August 21, 2007.\\"In Sierra Leone, PMDC Rank & File Condemn Charles Margai\\", Awareness Times, August 20, 2007.

At the parliamentary election that was held on the same day as the first round of the 2007 presidential elections, the PMDC became the third largest party in Parliament with 10 seats (out of 112). In the 2008 Local Government elections, the PMDC did less well, winning only one Council Chairperson seat (out of 19), and 4% of the council seats. All seats won by the party were in the Southern region, specifically in the Bo, Bonthe, Moyamba and Pujehun districts.\\"Official election results from NEC Sierra Leone\\" In the 2012 elections the party lost all of its remaining seats. 2018 Presidential Election Margai was a presidential candidate in Sierra Leone's 2018 General Election. He selected veteran educator Isata Dora Bangura to be his running mate.

The museum contains paintings by El Greco, Francisco Goya, Canaletto, Jean-Honor√© Fragonard and Fran√ßois Boucher, together with a sizable collection of decorative art, ceramics, textiles, tapestries, clocks and costumes, as well as older items from local history. The early works of French glassmaker √âmile Gall√© were commissioned by Jos√©phine, wife of the founder John Bowes. A great attraction is the 18th-century Silver Swan automaton, which periodically preens itself, looks round and appears to catch and swallow a fish. History The Bowes Museum was purpose-built as a public art gallery for John Bowes and his wife Jos√©phine Beno√Æte Coffin-Chevallier, Countess of Montalbo, who both died before it opened in 1892. Bowes was the son of John Bowes, the 10th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, although he did not inherit the title as he was deemed illegitimate under Scottish law. His grandmother was Mary Bowes, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne, a fascinating woman who forged a pioneering path for women's rights in relation to divorce. It was designed with the collaboration of two architects, the French architect Jules Pellechet and John Edward Watson of Newcastle. The building is richly modelled, with large windows, engaged columns, projecting bays, and mansard roofs typical of the French Second Empire, set within landscaped gardens. An account in 1901 described it as \\"... some 500 feet in length by 50 feet high, and is designed in the French style of the First Empire. Its contents are priceless, consisting of unique Napoleon relics, splendid picture galleries, a collection of old china, not to be matched anywhere else in the world, jewels of incredible beauty and value; and, indeed, a wonderful and rare collection of art objects of every kind.\\" Among those with less favourable opinions was Nikolaus Pevsner, who considered it to be \\"... big, bold and incongruous, looking exactly like the town hall of a major provincial town in France. In scale it is just as gloriously inappropriate for the town to which it belongs (and to which it gives some international fame) as in style\\". The building was begun in 1869 and was reputed to have cost ¬£100,000 (equivalent to ¬£ million in ). Bowes and his wife left an endowment of ¬£125,000 (¬£ million in ) and a total of 800 paintings.Sir Frank Douglas MacKinnon, \\"On circuit, 1924‚Äì1937\\", Cambridge, The University Press, 1940 Their collection of European fine and decorative arts amounted to 15,000 pieces.http://www.culture24.org.uk/ne000011 Portrait of Olivia Boteler Porter by Anthony van Dyck before and after restoration.

To date, improvements have been made to visitor facilities (shop, cafe and toilets); galleries (new Fashion & Textile gallery, Silver gallery and English Interiors gallery); and study/learning facilities. The three art galleries, on the second floor of the museum, were updated at the same time. The museum hosts an internationally significant programme of exhibitions, recently featuring works by Monet, Raphael, Turner, Sisley, Gall√©, William Morris, and Toulouse-Lautrec. The BBC announced in 2013 that a Portrait of Olivia Boteler Porter was a previously unknown Anthony van Dyck painting. It had been found in the Bowes Museum storeroom by art historian Dr. Bendor Grosvenor who had observed it on-line at the Your Paintings web site. The painting itself was covered in layers of varnish and dirt, and had not been renovated. It was originally thought to be a copy, and valued at between ¬£3,000 to ¬£5,000. Christopher Brown, director of the Ashmolean Museum, confirmed it was a van Dyck after it had been restored.

Located about a 10-minute drive from the centre of Peshawar, it is the fourth busiest airport in Pakistan. One unusual feature is that one end of the main runway is crossed by a railway line‚Äîthe seldom-used Khyber train safari to Landi Kotal in the Khyber Pass. The airport was renamed on 27 January 2012 after Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (also known as Bacha Khan), a Pashtun nationalist political leader.Peshawar Airport gets a new name It was reconstructed in 2016 to 2018.  History  Strategically situated in the heart of Peshawar, Bacha Khan International Airport is located approximately 180 km from Islamabad (federal capital of Pakistan) which makes it about a two hour drive from the capital via M-1 motorway. Since Peshawar is the capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, it provides world connections for the majority of the northwest region of the country and adjoining areas of Afghanistan. Since the province has a large Afghan Pashtun community residing within KPK, Afghanistan flights have always been on the rise. The airport traces its origins to 1927 when there was a small airfield that catered to much of the British Empire and Imperial Airways aircraft that were either travelling onwards to the east (e.g. to China and Malaysia/Singapore) or west (e.g. Europe and America). For this reason the city was given the nickname \\"Gateway to the East\\" because it linked the traditional oriental culture to modern occidental traditions. The airport gained importance after the independence of Pakistan from the British Raj; the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan (CAA) and the Pakistan Air Force started to use the airfield jointly for both military and civil operations. There were countless flights operated to and from Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, as well as other cities within the newly formed state. The airport achieved international status in 1965 when the first flight was operated from Kabul, Afghanistan to Peshawar. The flight was operated by the national flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). As years went on the airport grew with more flights and aircraft and relative upgrade was carried out from time to time. It was not until 1981 that the CAA extended the terminal to meet future needs for the next decade and to meet the estimated growth of passengers. The apron was developed fully by 1986, where the airport was able to handle four widebody aircraft and two small narrow body aircraft at one time. In January 2008 the provincial government met to discuss the expansion work needed to upgrade the quality of the aircraft in terms of facilities, terminal modernisation and cargo growth. In June 2008 the Deputy Director General of the CAA, Air Vice Marshal Sajid Habib, said that five billion rupees have been allocated to expand and develop Peshawar airport. Details of the work performed are ambiguous.  Structure  Peshawar is a major passenger hub with 75% flights internationally bound. The airport is currently under evaluation to be upgraded to make it compatible with future needs of the geographical location. The CAA is currently working with the provincial government to develop the airport to meet international standards. The airport has some facilities to handle the basic needs of travellers, such as telephone booths (domestic/international), currency exchange, automatic teller machines (ATMs), Internet stations (powered by Wateen), information counters, gifts and souvenir shop(s), snack shop(s), rental car services, as well as a post office. At present the following technical features are available at the airport. * Runway ** long, wide with shoulders on either side corresponding to International Civil Aviation Organisation Category 4E. It is crossed by a (rarely-operational) railway line, one of the few such runways in the world. Max capacity: Boeing 777-300ER. * Aprons ** For passenger and cargo.

His plane was shot down and he was captured and put on trial in the USSR. This triggered the U-2 crisis of 1960. * On 26 March 1965, a PIA Douglas C-47A-1-DK took off from the airport. The aircraft lost contact with air traffic control mid flight. The aircraft had crash landed at the Lowery Pass. All passengers and crew did not survive the accident and the aircraft was written off. * A PIA Fokker F27 Friendship was making a night approach at the airport on 23 October 1986. Due to co-pilot error, the aircraft was lower than expected. The aircraft undershot the runway, causing it to land in a ditch which caused the aircraft to break up. Thirteen passengers and crew sustained serious injuries and the aircraft was written off. * Six international airlines had temporarily suspended flights to Peshawar in view of the deteriorating security situation in that part of Pakistan. This followed a rocket attack on the airport in August 2009. The absence of a functional five star hotel in the city after the Pearl Continental hotel bombing was also said to be one of the causes. The airlines were Saudi Arabian Airlines, Emirates Airlines, Gulf Air, Air Arabia, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways. All the airlines resumed services to the city after a short hiatus, and RAK Airways even commenced new services as well. * On 15 December 2012, the airport suffered a coordinated assault by a team of terrorists, which killed nine people. * On 25 June 2014, A PIA flight originating from Riyadh was fired upon while it was flying at low altitude and landing at Peshawar, by unknown gunmen positioned outside the airport's vicinity. One woman was killed, while two passengers and a flight steward were reported injured who were rushed to hospital. The incident came just weeks after the deadly Jinnah Airport attack, sparking concerns over security of airports. Authorities launched a search operation after the incident, during which 200 were taken into custody. The UAE-based carriers Emirates and Etihad temporarily suspended their flight operations to Peshawar, but both carriers relaunched flights in August. * On 23 April 2019, an Airblue A320 Registered AP-EDA operating PA613 from Sharjah to Peshawar suffered a runway excursion on landing. The aircraft stopped beyond the end of the runway, but still on paved surface. No injuries have been reported.https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/ap-eda See also * PAF Base Peshawar, a Pakistan Air Force base adjoined with the airport * List of airports in Pakistan * Airlines of Pakistan * Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority * Shaheen Airport Services * Transport in Pakistan  References External links  Category:Airports in Peshawar ","title":"Bacha Khan International Airport"},{"id":"3795192","text":"Rais Amrohvi (), whose real name was Syed Muhammad Mehdi (1914-1988) was a Pakistani scholar, Urdu poet and psychoanalyst and elder brother of Jaun Elia.

Life=Mantua, Rome, and Ferrara: Renaissance humanist and tutor Recent scholarship has identified Antonio Possevino's family as New Christians admitted to the learned circles of the court of Renaissance Mantua and its Gonzaga dukes. His father was Piedmontese from Asti and moved to Mantua where he joined the guild of goldsmiths. The family name was changed from Cagliano (Caliano) and had three sons, Giovanni Battista, Antonio and Giorgio.Donnelly, John Patrick. Antonio Possevino and Jesuits of Jewish Ancestry in Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu 109 (1986): 3-31. His mother nursed her son Antonio in 1533 together with Francesco III Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua.Fumaroli, Marc. L'Age de l'Eloquence (Geneva, 1981), p. 163, \\"frere de lait\\". If this information is correct it should help clarify the birth year of Possevino as 1533, not 1533/ 1534, as many older sources cite. His older brother, Giovanni Battista Possevino (1522‚Äì1552) arrived in the mid-1540s in the Rome of Paul III Farnese, first in the service of the Mantuan cardinal reformer Gregorio Cortese, then of the papal \\"cardinal nipote\\" Alessandro Farnese (cardinal) and finally of cardinal Ippolito II d'Este. In 1549 at seventeen Antonio came to study with his brother in Rome and met the leading intellectuals at the Renaissance court of pope Julius III (1550‚Äì1555), the patron of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and the builder of Villa Giulia. These included Fulvio Orsini and Paulus Manutius. In 1553 he published posthumously the Dialogo dell'Honore of Giovanni Battista who died not yet thirty. In Rome he dedicated the Centones ex Vergilio published under the name of Lelio Capilupi, to the French poet Joachim Du Bellay and in 1556 in Due Discorsi he defended his brother against accusations of plagiarism and defended the writings of Giovanni Battista Giraldi. His brilliance and literary skills made the young humanist much in demand. When he left Rome he was engaged in service to Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga as tutor to the sons of his brother Ferrante Gonzaga, Francesco Gonzaga and Gian Vincenzo Gonzaga, both future cardinals. He moved with them to the literary capital of Italy, the city of Ferrara ruled by the House of Este. Possevino was connected with the Aristotelian revival associated with Francis Robortello and Vincenzo Maggi (1498‚Äì1564) that generated many treatises on literary and courtly matters including his brother's Dialogo dell'honore and his early works. When the University closed in Ferrara due to the Italian War of 1551‚Äì1559, Antonio moved to Padua. At this time Don Ferrante, his wards' father, died in the aftermath of the Battle of St. Quentin (1557). Possevino had become an expert in the historical training of princes and was writing commentaries on this battle exalting the victory of Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Savoy. This produced a Piedmontese commendature that he had to renounce in order to become a Jesuit, a severe hardship for his family, as his brother Giorgio was in jail and he was supporting his nephews, Giovanni Battista Bernardino Possevino and Antonio Possevino, both future translators and authors.  France and Savoy; Lyons: Counter Reformation Jesuit But in Padua and in Naples he came in contact with the Society of Jesus and joined the order in 1559.La vocazione alla Compagnia di Gesu del p. Antonio Possevino in Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu 12 (1945): 102-124. Possevino's Latin account of his vocation is in the Jesuit archives in Rome, Archivio Romano della Compagnia di Gesu, Hist. Soc. ff.183-195. In 1560 Possevino was accompanied by Jesuit General Diego Lainez to the Savoy of Emanuele Filiberto where he bolstered the Catholic Church against heretics and he founded the Jesuit schools at Chambery, Mondov√¨ and Turin.Mario Scaduto, S.J., Le missioni di Antonio Possevino in Piemonte: propaganda calvinistica e restaurazione cattolica, 1560-1563 Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu 28 (1959): 51-191. In his efforts to bring the entrenched Waldensians around, he debated Scipione Lentolo (1525‚Äì1599), Calvin's emissary to the Italian Reformed community.Joseph Visconti, The Waldensian Way to God (2003) p. 303. Also Camillo Crivelli La disputa di Antonio Possevino con i Valdesi (26 luglio 1560) in Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu 7 (1938): 79-91. In combatting the influence of Calvin's Geneva increasingly he gravitated to France. This was at the onset of the Wars of Religion where he sought to rally the Catholics of Lyons together with Jesuit preacher Edmond Auger. He published a treatise on the Mass, Il sacrificio dell'altare (1563) and debated such Geneva reformers as Pierre Viret and the Italian Calvinist, Niccolo Balbani. For the Italian merchant community of Lyons he provided Catholic books, for example the Catechism of Peter Canisius and several other works in Italian. During this time he was put in jail and rescued from his Huguenot captors by influential adherents. In 1565 he successfully defended his order at the Colloquy at Bayonne before the boy king Charles IX and the future king Henri IV who remained a lifelong friend. In 1569 he wrote Il Soldato cristiano for pope Pius V who had it printed in Rome and distributed to the papal troops at the battle of Lepanto. He served as the rector of the Jesuit college of Avignon and then of Lyons where he received the Jesuit General Francis Borgia in 1571 on a journey from Spain to Rome.Antonio Possevino in Diccionario Historico de la Compania de Jesus (Madrid, 2001) IV, 3202. He was there during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. During these militant years he first conceived of the plan of his Counter Reformation bibliographical works, as he states in the introduction to the Bibliotheca selecta. Rome: Jesuit Secretary; Sweden, Poland, Russia: Apostolic Nuncio When Borgia died, Possevino returned to Rome for the third Jesuit General Congregation and stayed on as the Latin secretary to Everard Mercurian, Jesuit general from 1572 until 1578. Pope Gregory XIII sent him to the court of King John III of Sweden in order to influence the course of the Livonian War. During this decade travelling around the Baltic and Eastern Europe Possevino wrote several tracts against his Protestant adversaries, including the Lutheran David Chytraeus, the Calvinist Andreas Volanus and the Unitarian Francis DavidDe sectariorum nostri temporis Atheismis liber (Vilna, 1586; Cologne, 1586) This material reappears in Bibliotheca selecta Bk. 8. After Sweden and Poland Possevino proceeded to the Russian capital of Ivan the terrible and helped to mediate between him and Stefan Bathory in the Treaty of Jam Zapolski in 1582. He left a valuable account of his nunciature in his description of the Tsardom of Muscovy. He also wrote accounts of his travels in Transylvania and Livonia. During these years he helped found, with Piotr Skarga the Jesuit Vilnius University and Jesuit academies and seminaries in Braniewo, Olomouc and Cluj Antonio Possevino.

Possevino's efforts to bolster the Catholics in Poland under the patronage of Bathory engendered hostility to the Jesuit diplomat at the Habsburg court of Rudolf II reflected at the papal court of Rome. left Padua and Rome: Jesuit encyclopedist & bibliographer After his protector Bathory's death at the end of 1586 Possevino was retired from diplomacy by Jesuit general Claudio Acquaviva. He was banned from Rome as too political and exiled to Venetian territory. In Padua Possevino continued to conduct the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises thus influencing the vocation of the Bishop and Saint Francis de Sales there as a student of law. Finally, in Padua began the scholarly project of assembling and organizing the library of orthodox Catholic learning assembled in the Bibliotheca selecta (1593) dedicated to pope Clement VIII and Sigismund III Vasa. His sections were carefully reviewed by the leading professors of the Roman College including Christopher Clavius and Robert Bellarmine. A decade later the theological compendium Apparatus Sacer (1603‚Äì06) appeared in Venice. During the 1590s while he was busy as a bibliographer he was also active in pastoral work in his native Mantua and at the court of duke Vincenzo Gonzaga. Two missions on the status of the Jesuits in France brought him into renewed contact with king Henri IV. Venice and Ferrara: Jesuit polemicist In Venice Possevino served as a leader of the vecchi against the anti-papal giovani who supported Paolo Sarpi and had contacts with French and English ambassadors.G. Sorano Il P. Antonio Possevino e l'ambasciatore inglese a Venezia (1604-1605) in Aevum 7 (1933): 385-422. Following the Interdict of 1606 of pope Paul V against Venice, Possevino was banished with the Society of Jesus from the Republic of Venice. He was sent to relative obscurity in nearby Ferrara where he wrote several polemical tracts under various pseudomyns concerning the pro-Catholic False Dmitriy I, the Venetian Interdict and other controversial issues.William J. Bouwsma, Venice and the Defense of Republican Liberty: Renaissance Values in the Age of the Counter Reformation (Berkeley, 1968) passim. Having outlived his role during the Counter Reformation as the political Jesuit intellectual, par excellence, he died in 1611. Selected works * Apparatus sacer ad scriptores Veteris et Novi Testamenti, also simply called Apparatus sacer, is one of the most celebrated works of Antonio Possevino (the other being Bibliotheca selecta). It is an overview of the different interpretations of the Old and New Testament by ecclesiastical authors from the Church fathers up to his contemporaries. It was printed in three volumes in Venice during the first decade of the 17th century. It references no less than six thousand authors. *Del sacrificio dell'altare (Lyons, 1563) [English trans.

The island consists of small roads, close lanes, large number of closely built houses, only a few have a second floor, green vegetation surrounds most of the housing compounds, specially banana trees and in some households there are even taro (ﬁáﬁ¶ﬁçﬁ¶) fields within the housing compound. This vegetation is regarded as part domestic agriculture and is often sent to Male' to local market. To the south of Hulhudhoo is Herathera. An uninhabited section of the island which is located to the south, within the lagoon of Hulhudhoo. This island is linked with Hulhudhoo by bridge. The island of Maafishi, which is also located on the south of Hulhudhoo, has been linked to Hulhudhoo. Now Herathera has been developed as Canareef Island Resort.  Geography  Hulhumeedhoo's shape loosely resembles that of the letter D or even a harp. The island is the northeasternmost island of Addu City, making it the closest island to Fuvahmulah, which is located about 40 km to the northeast. The closest inhabited islands to the island, Hithadhoo, Maradhoo, Mardhoo-Feydhoo and Feydhoo (mainland Addu City) are located no more than 15 kilometers away, about 20 minutes by speedboat.  History  The original settlers were Dhivehi people of Aryan origin. An Arab traveller named Yoosuf Naib introduced Islam to the island many years before the rest of the Maldives converted to Islam, and built the country's first mosque. The island has since been known as a centre of learning and Islamic religious education. The 900 year old K≈çga·πá·πáu Cemetery in Meedhoo is the oldest cemetery in the Maldives. The largest tombstone in the country is also found in this cemetery. It is believed that this tombstone dates back to the 18th century and belongs to a royal of the Maldives.  Education  Schools within Hulhumeedhoo include Shamsuddin School, Asriyya Preschool, Shareefee Preschool, Hulhudhoo School, Nasriyya Preschool and Seenu Atoll School. Seenu Atoll School is the only secondary school in the island.  Landmarks  Hulhumeedhoo, being one of the oldest populated islands in the Maldives, is also home to remnants of the Second World War and even centuries-old ancient relics. Most of the ancient artifacts are found at Kogannu Cemetery, the oldest cemetery in the country, which is home to many mosques and tombs of antiquity. The island is home to World War II era remnants like coastal defense artillery and fortifications (Dh√© Badi Dheythere), built on the island's eastern coast by the British based at RAF Gan as defense against Axis powers. Kogannu Cemetery (facing east) during the wet season in 2019  Beaches  Some notable beaches of the island include, Eedhigamool beach, Kogannu beach, Kalhibih, Bomaa Fannu, Veyraando and H√©ra Burik√©d√©than (Ismehelaa Hera). To the south of the island is Canareef Island Resort, formerly Herathera, which was a part of southern Hulhumeedhoo that was dredged and separated to build a resort. To the north is a similar island, Ismehelaa Hera, also separated from Hulhumeedhoo to build a resort. This resort, named South Palm Maldives, is currently under construction. Moosaag√© Fann√© Athiri in April 2019  Medhebandharo  Medhebandharo (ﬁâﬁ¨ﬁãﬁ¨ﬁÑﬁ¶ﬁÇﬁãﬁ¶ﬁÉﬁÆ), also synonymously known as Fasgando (ﬁäﬁ¶ﬁêﬁ∞ﬁéﬁ¶ﬁÇﬁëﬁÆ), is the central harbour of the island. It is home to MPL Hulhumeedhoo Ferry Terminal and Addu Fisheries Complex. Aerial view of Hulhumeedhoo in 2013 with burnt areas of Kilhi visible (center left).  Kilhi  Hulhumeedhoo Kilhi or Mathikilhi or simply, Kilhi (ﬁÜﬁ®ﬁÖﬁ®) is a large, marshy grassland of around 50 hectares located in the centre of Hulhumeedhoo known for its ponds. Although in this case, it refers to a marsh, \\"Kilhi\\" usually means either lake or wetland in the Addu dialect of the Dhivehi language. The ponds are known to have a few freshwater fish species including, Greenstripe Barb (Puntius vittatus) and a species of swamp eel. Kilhi has been becoming more and more popular, ever since the building of a pond named \\"Mathikilhi Eco Garden\\". It has since been an icon and landmark of the island.  Wildfires  Wildfires occur in the dry, open marsh a few times every year. The cause of ignition is usually attributed to intentional or even accidental fires, although natural ignition is also possible. In 2018, a fire in the Kilhi area destroyed the nearby WAMCO site, the island's waste management office. marsh wildfire.350x350px References Category:Islands of the Maldives Category:Addu Atoll ","title":"Hulhumeedhoo"},{"id":"3795241","text":"Thomas Hayward (21 March 1835 ‚Äì 21 July 1876) was an English first-class cricketer who was generally reckoned to be one of the outstanding batsmen of the 1850s and 1860s. In the early 1860s, he and Robert Carpenter, his county colleague, were rated as the two finest batsmen in England. Richard Daft was among those ranking them as equal first, though George Parr reckoned Carpenter the better of the two. Hayward was from a famous cricketing family. His father was Daniel Hayward and his nephew was the Surrey and England batsman Tom Hayward. Hayward played as a right-handed batsman for Cambridge Town Club (Cambridgeshire) 1854‚Äì72 and also for numerous representative teams. At the end of the 1859 English cricket season, Hayward was one of the 12 players who took part in cricket's first-ever overseas tour when an England cricket team led by George Parr visited North America. He also was member of the second All England XI to tour Australia, and travelled out on the SS Great Britainhttps://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/traveller/11482 His overall first-class career record covered 118 matches. He scored 4789 runs at an average of 25.33 with a highest score of 132 and 6 centuries. He took 62 catches. Hayward was also a good right arm medium pace bowler, using the prevailing roundarm style. His bowling figures were 267 wickets for 3937 runs at an average of 15.81. His best innings analysis was an impressive 9‚Äì30. He took 5wI on 19 occasions and 10wM in 2 matches. He is buried in the Mill Road cemetery, Cambridge.

In May 2002, three of the Santorini's crew members were convicted of attempting to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip.  Operation  The ship's crew was led by Captain Div Va'iza, a Lebanese citizen, and included two of his relatives, Hussein Va'iza and Fahdi Awadwas. The three were professional smugglers; a fourth crewmember was Va‚Äôiza's son. The crew had been hired by Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ‚Äì General Command and were asked to smuggle arms into Gaza. The crew refused the operation as too risky, but agreed instead to smuggle the arms to a location near the Egyptian Sinai coast, where they would be met by agents of the PFLP-GC. The crew made three failed attempts to rendezvous with the agents in Sinai, and were captured on their fourth. The Santorini had left northern Beirut On May 6, 2001, carrying weapons packed in barrels. Their plan was to drop the barrels off-shore, anchored at a pre- determined spot for later collection by Sinai-based agents. A surveillance plane spotted the suspicious ship, and a Shayetet 13 commando team boarded the 40-ton ship near Rosh Hanikra, just off the coast of northern Israel's border with Lebanon.  Shipment  According to the IDF, the shipment contained the following weapons: *50 Katyusha rocket launchers * Four Strela 2 (SA-7) antiaircraft missiles *120 RKG anti-tank grenades *20 rocket-propelled grenade launchers *Two 60-mm mortars *98 60-mm mortar rounds *62 TMA-5 land mines *Eight TMA-3 anti-tank land mines *24 hand grenades *30 Kalashnikov rifles *116 gun cartridges for the rifles *13,000 7.62-mm Kalashnikov bullets Reactions *Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ‚Äì General Command: the PFLP-GC confirmed the shipment was theirs, with Jibril quoted on Israel's Army radio as saying \\"This was not the first shipment, nor will it be the last.\\" *Israel: Prime Minister Sharon said the event was \\"a very dangerous development\\" which \\"emphasises the intentions of the [Palestinian] authority.\\" He described it as an extremely grave violation of all the agreements that Arafat signed with Israel. *Palestinian Authority ‚Äì Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo denied any connection to the smuggling attempt, and the PA's spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudaineh was quoted saying \\"For sure we have nothing to do with the shipment.\\"Gaza-bound weapons arsenal seized by Israeli Navy Aftermath In May 2002, three of the Santorini's crewmembers were convicted, by a military tribunal, of attempting to smuggle weapons into Gaza. The key legal issues were whether the weapons were destined for Gaza (over which the court had jurisdiction, as it was then occupied by Israel), and whether the crew knew that Gaza was to be the final destination of the shipment. The fourth crewmember, Va‚Äôiza's son, was acquitted when the court determined he had not participated in the previous three attempts and that it was not proven that he knew the ship's destination.

It is an aluminium alloy-frame version of the Model 10 (also known as the M&P;). It was made from 1953 to 1986 in both two-inch (50.8 mm) and four-inch (101.6 mm) barrel configurations. It weighs 19 oz (524 g) unloaded. Early models used an aluminum cylinder as well as frame. Production variants In 1953, the United States Air Force (USAF) ordered a variant of the S&W; Military & Police Airweight with a two-inch barrel and aluminum cylinder to be issued to US Air Force flight crew members, called the Revolver, Lightweight, Caliber .38 Special, M13. Some 40,000 Smith & Wesson M13 revolvers were produced.

After the M13 was withdrawn from service, a higher-pressure cartridge, the Caliber .38 Ball, Special, M41 was introduced. The M41 Special cartridge had a revised pressure rating of 16,000 CUP, giving a velocity of . However, after continued negative reports, Air Force officials decided that the revolvers were not suitable for issue, and the model was withdrawn from service, all but a few examples being crushed or destroyed. A civilian model of the M13 was released in 1953, called the Military & Police Airweight. This designation was changed in 1957 to the Model 12 Airweight. The Military & Police Airweight initially used both an aluminum cylinder and frame, and weighed only 14.5 ounces.

It is chambered for the .38 Special cartridge and is fitted with a barrel, though additional barrel options have been offered at various times during its production. Originally known as the \\"K-38 Combat Masterpiece\\", it was renamed the Model 15 in 1957 when all Smith & Wesson revolvers were given numerical model numbers. It is a shorter barrel version of the Smith & Wesson Model 14 Target Masterpiece and essentially an adjustable-sight version of the seminal Smith & Wesson Model 10 (\\"Military and Police\\") revolver with target shooting features. The main production run of the Model 15 was from 1949 through 1999. It was discontinued for approximately a decade until 2011, when a re-tooled version was re-released under S&W;'s Classics Revolvers line. History The Smith & Wesson K-38 Combat Masterpiece Revolver Model 15\\"K-38 Combat Masterpiece Revolver Model 15\\", designed by Flora Mitchell Van Orden, wife of Brig. Gen. George O. Van Orden, USMC, with the attention of Tiny Helwig at the S&W; head office in 1949, is the full name as it appears on the cover of the S&W; owners manual is a derivative of the classic 1899 K-frame (medium frame) Military and Police .38 S&W; Special (aka .38 Special) six-shot double-action revolver. The M&P; underwent steady evolution throughout the 20th century and S&W; spun off several variations as separate models in the post World War II years. One of these was the K-38 Target Masterpiece, which began production in 1947. The Target Masterpiece included a number of new and/or special features, including a six-inch barrel with a narrow rib to provide a level sight plane, a Patridge front sight, a micrometer click rear sight, S&W;‚Äôs .375‚Äù short-throw hammer, a trigger adjustment for overtravel, and improved grips. Noting the accuracy of the Target Masterpiece, a number of police departments and the FBI soon requested the same revolver with a four- inch barrel and a Baughman Quick Draw front sight. The result was the K-38 Combat Masterpiece. The major distinction between the K-38 Target Masterpiece and the K-38 Combat Masterpiece is the barrel length and the front sight. In 1957 the K-38 Combat Masterpiece was renamed the Model 15 when all Smith & Wesson revolvers were given numerical model numbers. (The Military & Police and the Target Masterpiece were renamed the Model 10 and Model 14 respectively.) The model number is stamped on the frame behind the cylinder yoke, so it is visible (only) when the cylinder is open. A number of production and engineering changes have been made throughout the years, some of which are noted by a dash number suffixed to the Model number (15-1, -2, -3). Over the years the Model 15 has been produced with several barrel lengths, with 4\\" (standard) and 2\\" (1964‚Äì1988) being the most common. In 1972 S&W; released a stainless steel version as the Model 67. In 1997 the hammer and internal lockworks were modified from an on-the-hammer firing pin / internal hammer block to a floating firing pin / MIM flat hammer, and kept the hammer block that, unlike a transfer bar safety design, moves up with the trigger pull. The hammer hits a transfer bar, transferring the strike to the firing pin, while the block in a hammer block system moves down with the trigger pull, unblocking the hammer from the firing pin, allowing the hammer to strike the firing pin. These two safety systems work oppositely, but achieve the same goal of only allowing the gun to fire when the trigger is pulled all the way. The Model 15 was a popular sidearm for law enforcement and was the standard issue sidearm of the U.S. Air Force Police from 1962 until 1992 when it was replaced by the Beretta M9 pistol. Production of the Model 15 was discontinued in 1999 when Smith & Wesson was purchased and reorganized, although a couple limited run \\"Heritage Series\\" models were released in 2001 and 2002. In 2011 Smith & Wesson re-introduced the Model 15 (15-10) under their Classics Revolvers line, newly machined, with a shrouded redesigned barrel, and a built-in trigger lock (located just above the cylinder release thumbpiece on the left side).

From 1960 to 1969 the Air Force bought large numbers of Model 15-1, 15-2, and 15-3 revolvers with a 4\\" barrel. The only distinctive markings are \\"U.S.A.F\\" on the left side of the frame. Originally all were blued, though some were reparkerized while in Air Force service. The Model 15 was the standard issue sidearm of the U.S. Air Force Air/Security Police from 1962 until 1992. It was issued to security personnel in other branches of the U.S. armed forces, including the Naval Security Forces. The Air Force issued two types of .38 Special duty ammunition for the Model 15, originally the M41 .38 Special Ball (full metal jacket) cartridge, or the later-developed Caliber .38 Special, Ball, PGU-12/B High Velocity cartridge. The M41 was a low pressure cartridge rated at 13,000 psi, originally designed for 158-grain ball ammunition, but loaded with a 130-grain FMJ bullet. The PGU-12/B, issued only by the U.S. Air Force, had a greatly increased maximum allowable pressure rating of 20,000 psi, sufficient to propel the 130-grain FMJ bullet at from a solid test barrel, and from a revolver barrel.Military .38 Special Ammunition, The American Rifleman (March 1982), p. 68 The S&W; Model 15 revolvers were replaced by the Beretta M9 pistol in 9√ó19mm caliber beginning in 1985, with complete turnover by the early 1990s. In addition to military use, the Model 15 was issued by many police departments across the United States as well as various federal law enforcement agencies. In 1972 S&W; produced a stainless steel version of the Model 15 which it termed the Model 67. Users The LAPD's Model 15 revolvers (and department issued Model 36 5-shot, 2-inch barrelled snub nose Smith & Wesson revolvers for detectives, plainclothes, undercover and other officers' off duty carry) were modified to be fired double-action only. This was accomplished by the department armorer who ground the full cock notch from the hammers. Officers were then trained to shoot combat style without ever cocking the weapons. This change was likely the result of unintended injuries and/or property damage, and of litigation against the LAPD after officers had cocked their weapons only to have them discharge inadvertently, possibly as a result of physical attacks or having been startled in the course of searching for suspects. In lawsuits, the principle of res ipsa loquitur was easily affirmed because \\"an inadvertent weapon discharge is a negligent discharge\\". Overland Park Police Department (Kansas) used the revolver before going to semi-automatic Beretta 92 pistols.

The film stars Robert Gustafsson, Johan Rheborg, Henrik Schyffert, Jonas Inde, Maria Kulle and Ulf Brunnberg. The film consists of four interwoven stories about life tragedies, each related to fatherhood as the common theme. It was produced by Sveriges Television. The film won four Guldbagge Awards including Best Director and Best Actor for Gustafsson. In 2005 it was aired on television as four mid-length television films, which had been reedited with additional footage. Plot The stories are interwoven in the film version, though their stories are completely unconnected. In the television version, each story constitutes one episode and works as an independent television film, varying in length between 40 and 60 minutes. ;Landins (The Landins) Christer Landin, the father in a family living in a community in Scania, southern Sweden, tries to motivate his son who is falling behind in school by bringing him to his workplace as a pet cremator. Accidentally, the son turns on the crematory oven just in the wrong moment and the father is severely burned. Life still has to go on, and while the son is feeling guilty, the father goes through rehabilitation where he learns to speak again and befriends other local people also suffering from speech disabilities. ;En d√•lig id√© (A bad idea) Richard Brunn, a man with a lifetime subscription to the magazine Wallpaper*, is together with his wife opening a top designed beachside hotel. They are visited by Richard's parents who work as stage magicians. The parents bring an easy-going Dane and a wooden statuette representing a former minister, which Richard finds to be extremely tasteless, and which triggers a mental breakdown. ;Min sista vilja (My last will) The deceased S√∂ren H. Lindberg, an equally eccentric as successful harness racing driver and trainer from Dalarna, has left a bizarre will demanding various acts and arrangements to be performed at his funeral. As his three sons and countless mistresses are gathered, the sorrow and confusion is processed, and everybody is curious of who will inherit which part of his wealth. Eventually it turns out that all money has been spent on a hologram of Lindberg telling them that he used the money to create the hologram. Furthermore, his best horse is given away to the National Estonian Trotting Association without any explanation. ;Pappas lilla tjockis (Dad's little fatso) A cooking class in Gothenburg develops into a therapy session for lost souls. Johan is unable to get really close to anyone, including his wife, and keeps telling lies about his progress to the group. Ernst is dysfunctional and unable to get a job, and shifts between feeling very charismatic and like a total misfit. Jenny feels bad about not being able to keep herself from using irony and sarcasm to hurt people who don't understand when she's serious and when she's not. Olle is troubled by the breakup of his marriage.

It received funding from the Swedish Film Institute and Nordisk Film- & TV- Fond. Principal photography took place at Sveriges Television's studios. Release The film premiered on 25 January 2004 at the Gothenburg Film Festival. The regular Swedish premiere followed on 30 January. Theatrical screenings in Sweden included a 15-minute break in the middle. Also in January 2004, the film was screened in competition at the International Film Festival Rotterdam. The TV version premiered on 31 January 2005 with \\"Landins\\" which was followed by the other episodes with weekly intervals. Reception In Svenska Dagbladet, a film critic wrote: \\"Killingg√§nget defy expectations and make a serious film and simultaneously not. When their humour works best, like in the masterpiece Screwed in Tallinn, it is both satirical and heartbreaking at the same time. But the new film - or films - is several shades blacker.\\" The critic strongly complimented the acting, directing and overall production values, but criticised the film for having poor interaction of its different parts: \\"Everything is there. Killingg√§nget could without problems have made four feature films from their material if they only had refined it. In its current form Four Shades of Brown becomes overkill on all levels. Both too long and too short simultaneously.\\" Gunnar Rehlin reviewed the film for Variety and compared it to Roy Andersson's Songs from the Second Floor and Ulrich Seidl's Dog Days. Rehlin particularly complimented the acting performances of Robert Gustafsson, Johan Rheborg and Ulf Brunnberg, and called the film \\"a very good and very brave portrait in black of a country often seen as a model, caring society.\\" Four Shades of Brown won four Guldbagge Awards in 2005: Best Direction, Best Actor for Gustafsson, Best Actress for Maria Kulle and Best Supporting Actor for Brunnberg. It was also nominated for Best Film, Best Actor for Rheborg, Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay.

It was the most northerly line in New Zealand and was intended to run all the way to Kaitaia. It opened to ≈åkaihau in 1923 and closed in 1987. Construction Proposals for a railway line to Kaitaia and the Far North existed as early as the 1870s, but it was not until 1909 that preliminary surveys were conducted. After the North Auckland Line was linked to and extended over the Opua Branch in 1911, construction progressed in earnest from Otiria towards Kaikohe: initial work had been undertaken in 1910. On 1 May 1914, this section opened. A small amount of further construction took place over the next two years, but World War I meant that no work took place between 1916 and 1919. The resumption of work led to the completion of the line to ≈åkaihau on 29 October 1923. Debate raged over what route to follow to Kaitaia. The proposal was to run from ≈åkaihau to Rangiahua, near the Hokianga Harbour, and then either through the Maungataniwha Range, about 30 kilometres long with two tunnels; or skirting the range, roughly ten kilometres longer with no tunnels. A 1921 commission did not support work beyond ≈åkaihau, but a compromise in 1923 established Rangiahua as the northern terminus and the Public Works Department continued to build northwards, albeit slowly. The Great Depression proved catastrophic for the fortunes of the line beyond ≈åkaihau, with construction abandoned in 1931. The Rangiahua section was essentially complete: the line wound downhill to the settlement and a station yard complete with platform was built, though the station building itself was not erected. In 1936, a change in government led to a review of the work beyond ≈åkaihau and the decision was made not to extend the line to Kaitaia. The steep route to Rangiahua was not seen as being particularly useful and had been plagued by slips. The line was accordingly terminated in Okaihau, which was on the main State Highway north (SH1). During 1938 and World War II the abandoned trackage was salvaged, sometimes by bullock teams, for use elsewhere, especially the Dargaville Branch. Stations The following stations were on the Okaihau Branch, with the distance from Otiria in brackets. The extension to Rangiahua is not included, as it never saw regular service. Otiria to Kaikohe (Opened 1 May 1914) *Kawiti (5 km) *Cameron's Crossing (7 km) *Ngapipito (10 km) *Rakautao (17 km) *Ngapuhi (22 km) *Kaikohe (26 km) Kaikohe to Okaihau (Opened 29 October 1923) *Lake Omapere Road Crossing (35 km) *Okaihau (40 km) *A ballast pit was located near Kawiti. *Engine sheds were located at Kaikohe (closed 1930) and Okaihau Operation Although Kaikohe has become established as the service centre of the Far North, it failed to generate much rail traffic in the early years of the line. During the first ten months of existence, just 1,500 tons of inbound freight was carried, with roughly half that carried outbound; the decline continued to the point that in 1918 Kaikohe lost its stationmaster. Minimal services were offered, and although losses increased up to 1930, fortunes had somewhat improved by 1940, and by 1950 there was sufficient traffic to justify six trains each way a week. Two carried solely freight, while four were mixed trains, also carrying passengers. Full complements of staff were employed at Kaikohe and ≈åkaihau, where a locomotive depot was located. Folk singer Peter Cape wrote and sang his song The Okaihau Express in the 1950s about the ≈åkaihau train, which consisted of a steam engine, a carriage and a guards van.Cape, Peter. \\"The Okaihau Express\\" (song). When railcars were introduced on services north of Auckland in November 1956, they ran all the way to Okaihau. Previously, a carriage train known as the Northland Express (or the Opua Express) had run from Auckland to Opua with connections to Okaihau via the mixed trains, but with the change of the northern terminus to ≈åkaihau, the branch increased in importance. This proved to be short-lived; in July 1967 the very popular railcar service was withdrawn due to mechanical problems plaguing the railcars. Passengers had to use the mixed trains, with significantly older rolling stock on a slower schedule, and demand slipped. The branch closed to passengers on 21 June 1976. In 1977, a relaxation of road transport laws led to a decline in freight traffic on the line and forestry proposals that would have required a railway service failed to eventuate. Scheduled trains were cancelled on 12 August 1983, and for a little over four years the line was shunted when required. The branch closed on 1 November 1987. The branch today After the line's closure, the New Zealand Railways Corporation retained ownership over the trackbed in the hopes that forestry proposals would come to fruition, and some rails were still in place during the 1990s. In most places track and bridges have been removed, though evidence of the bridge piles and ballast remain. A loading bank and rails under a loading chute exist in Kaikohe, and in ≈åkaihau, the flat area of the yard, the tunnel leading to Rangiahua and the platform are very apparent. For much of the line's length, its formation is quite obvious and includes embankments and cuttings. At Rangiahua State Highway 1 is where the rails used to be, with a loading bank to the west and a platform to the east. The corridor is still owned by the Crown.  Pou Herenga Tai - Twin Coast Cycle Trail  A proposal was made by the Kaikohe Rau Marama Community Trust to convert the trackbed between ≈åkaihau and Kaikohe into a walking and cycling track, much like the Otago Central Rail Trail and the Little River Rail Trail in the South Island. This was to be the first step in a plan to establish a rail trail through to the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway in Kawakawa.Kate Molloy, \\"Proposed Walkway Opens Historic Rail Track\\", Northern News, 6 June 2007. of the line was opened in 2013 as the first part of the Twin Coast Cycle Trail from Opua to Horeke, which opened fully in 2017.

It was first produced in 1935, and many versions of it are still in production today. The Model 27 was built on Smith & Wesson's carbon steel, large N-frame, and was available at various times with 3\\", 4\\", 5\\", 6\\" or 8\\" barrel lengths and had adjustable sights. History When first introduced by Smith & Wesson in 1935, it was known as the Registered Magnum. The model was essentially a custom-order revolver. Barrel lengths could be had in increments from inches in length. In addition to the different lengths of barrels available, there were different grips, front sights, triggers, hammers, and finishes available. Each Registered Magnum came with a certificate of authenticity. Even though it was introduced in the middle of the Great Depression and was extremely expensive, Smith & Wesson found itself backlogged with orders for the four years that it produced the Registered Magnum. The Kansas City Police Department issued the Registered Magnum to its officers, and many other law enforcement officers across the United States carried the Registered Magnum. In 1939 Smith & Wesson stopped producing the Registered Magnum. It was replaced with the .357 Magnum. The .357 Magnum was available with barrel lengths of . It has been reported that these were the most popular barrel lengths for the Registered Magnum. Essentially the .357 Magnum was still the Registered Magnum, but standardized for ease of production and economy. The Smith & Wesson Model 28 \\"Highway Patrolman\\" was introduced as a lower-cost version of the Model 27 in 1954, stripped of some of the features of the Model 27, such as polishing. It was noted for its durability and reliability. The 3-inch barrel length was extremely popular with FBI agents from the 1940s through the 1960s. Skeeter Skelton considered the Model 27 with a 5-inch barrel as the best all-around handgun. General George Patton carried an ivory- handled Registered Magnum with a 3-inch barrel (along with his ivory-handled Colt Peacemaker); Patton called the Model 27 his \\"killing gun.\\" Variants The stainless steel Model 627 was introduced in 1989 as the \\"Model of 1989\\". It featured a -inch barrel, a 6-shot unfluted cylinder, and had a round butt with S&W; Combat stocks. In 1996 the Smith & Wesson Performance Center began production of an 8-shot 627. The revolver has a barrel with no muzzle brake or ports. The cylinder is unfluted. The revolver is made of stainless steel, with a matte finish and wood grips. Model 327 In 2008, the eight-shot, scandium-framed Smith & Wesson Model 327 was introduced. A variant of the 327, the 327NG, is part of the NightGuard line. The Smith & Wesson Model 327PD is an 8-shot double-action revolver that has a 4-inch barrel with no muzzle brake or ports, made of a stainless steel. It has a scandium alloy frame and a titanium cylinder. It comes with rosewood Hogue grips. It uses a light- gathering HI-VIZ front sight and an adjustable V-notch rear sight. The revolver finish is a glare-reducing matte black, with a matte gray cylinder. The S&W; TRR8 and M&P; R8 (both incorporating tactical rails) are recent advances of the 327 line. Current production Smith and Wesson now include the Model 27 in two variations in their current \\"Classics\\" Line of Revolvers.

Julmahuvi collectively are Tommi Korpela, Jukka Rasila, Janne Reinikainen, Petteri Summanen and Jani Volanen. The group first worked together on the sketch-show To(i)ni ja Heikki Haaman Show which ran from 1995 to -96 on MTV3. After this they produced the mockumentary about a fictional boyband named The Joyboys Story in 1997. The group's most famous show was the sketch show Studio Julmahuvi which ran for 8 episodes on Yle in 1998. The show was a parody of YLE's own programming, squeezing an entire evening's worth of programming into a half-hour show which included everything from news and weather to a children's show and a German police drama, with commercials and TV-spots on the side. The show was created with an impressive budget of 67 000 ‚Ç¨ per episode which resulted in extremely high production- values (in comparison to low-budget sketch-shows like Pulttibois and Kummeli). Afterwards Julmahuvi made Jerico 2000, a parody topic-show which also reused some of the smaller mockumentaries featured in Studio Julmahuvi. It aired on MTV3 in 1999. The last big production was the mini-series Mennen Tullen which featured several characters from Studio Julmahuvi's fictional cop-shows now in the present day. It aired on YLE between 2000 and 2001. Though produced in the fashion of a serious murder-mystery it was essentially a dark comedy with occasional absurd elements. The Joyboys Story won the Bronze Rose of Montreux in 1997 and Studio Julmahuvi was awarded with the Venla (Finland's equivalent to an Emmy) prize for the best comedy show in 1999. Studio Julmahuvi, The Joyboys Story, Jerico 2000 and Mennen tullen were all released as a box-set on DVD in 2005 with a bonus CD containing voice-clips and songs featured on Z-Salamapartio, one of the fictional cop-shows set in the 1970s.

Henderson Field is a former military airfield on Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands during World War II. Originally built by the Japanese, the conflict over its possession was one of the great battles of the Pacific war. Today it is Honiara International Airport. History=Japanese construction After the occupation of the Solomon Islands in April 1942, the Japanese military planned to capture Port Moresby in New Guinea and Tulagi in the southern Solomons, extending their southern defensive perimeter establishing bases to support possible future advances. Seizure of Nauru, Ocean Island, New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa would cut supply lines between Australia and the United States, with the result of reducing or eliminating Australia as a threat to Japanese positions in the South Pacific. The airfield on Guadalcanal was first surveyed by Japanese engineers when they arrived in the area in early May, and was known as \\"Lunga Point\\", or \\"Runga Point\\" to the Japanese, and code named \\"RXI\\". The airfield would allow Japanese aircraft to patrol the southern Solomons, shipping lanes to Australia, and the eastern flank of New Guinea. There were two major construction units involved: 1,379 men in one and 1,145 in another, originally scheduled to work on Midway Island once it was captured, arrived on 6 July 1942, commencing work after 9 July. Construction was observed and reported by Coastwatchers, and the airfield's presence spawned American plans to capture Guadalcanal and use the airfield for Allied aircraft. About the middle of July, 250 additional civilians of the \\"Hama Construction Unit\\" arrived under the command of Inouree Hama, who had had 50 men on Gavutu previously. Also, specialists from the 14th Encampment Corps established radio stations on Tulagi, Gavutu and at RXI. Local labor was also used in the construction. Airfield construction proceeded ahead of schedule and on the night of 6 August 1942, just before the American landing, the construction troops were given an extra sake ration for completing the airfield ahead of schedule. United States seizure and Battle of Guadalcanal : See: Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle for Henderson Field for more information Henderson Field as built up by April 1943, looking southeast to northwest On 7 August 1942, American forces of the United States 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions landed on the islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida in the southern Solomon Islands with the objective of denying their use by the Japanese to threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. The Allies also intended to use Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. The Marines overwhelmed the outnumbered Japanese defenders and captured Tulagi and Florida, as well as the nearly completed RXI airfield which was being built by the Japanese on Guadalcanal. The captured airfield was named Henderson Field in honor of United States Marine Corps Major Lofton Henderson, commanding officer of VMSB-241 who was killed during the Battle of Midway while leading his squadron into action against the Japanese carrier forces, thereby becoming the first Marine aviator to perish during the battle. The first aircraft to land on the field was a PBY patrol bomber on August 12. On August 20, thirty-one Marine aircraft (F4F Wildcat fighters and SBD Dauntless dive bombers) were launched by USS Long Island from south of Guadalcanal, forming the field's first permanent air contingent. Two days later, a squadron of U.S. Army P-400 Airacobra (P-39 variant) fighters arrived, and in the coming months a number of B-17s and U.S. Navy aircraft used the base. Boeing B-17E of 11th Bomb Group, 42d Bomb Squadron (Eager Beavers) at Henderson Field in 1943 Surprised by the Allied offensive, the Japanese made several attempts between August and November 1942 to retake Henderson Field. Three major land battles, seven large naval battles (five nighttime surface actions and two carrier battles), and continual, almost daily aerial battles culminated in the decisive Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in early November 1942, during which the last Japanese attempt to bombard Henderson Field from the sea and to land enough troops to retake it was defeated. In December 1942, the Japanese abandoned their efforts to retake Guadalcanal, conceding the island to the Allies and evacuating their last forces, while harassed and pursued by the U.S. Army's XIV Corps, by 7 February 1943. Operations after the Battle of Guadalcanal In 1944, specially- fitted Liberator PB4Y-1 bombers operated from Henderson Field to carry out reconnaissance on Eniwetok and other Japanese-held islands.Samuel Eliot Morison, History of United States Naval Operations in World War II: New Guinea and the Marianas, 1953 August P. Loring & W. Sidney Felton, p.164 Royal New Zealand Air Force squadrons were using the air base during October and November 1944 for patrols and searches. The RNZAF provided No 52 Radar Unit in March 1943 with GCI radar, which (unlike the SCR 270 radar) could provide altitudes of approaching enemy planes.

It was a J-frame modified to take a six-shot K-frame cylinder. It was Smith & Wesson's answer to the Colt Detective Special. The revolver was made with an offset cylinder stop, which made it difficult to manufacture and test. As a result, most Model 73s were destroyed for safety reasons; it is estimated that there are no more than 20 left in private ownership.

They represent specific guidelines to HR managers on various matters concerning employment and state the intent of the organization on different aspects of Human Resource management such as recruitment, promotion, compensation, training, selections etc. They therefore serve as a reference point when human resources management practices are being developed or when decisions are being made about an organization's workforce. A good HR policy provides generalized guidance on the approach adopted by the organization, and therefore its employees, concerning various aspects of employment. A procedure spells out precisely what action should be taken in line with the policies. Each organization has a different set of circumstances and so develops an individual set of human resource policies. The location an organization operates in will also dictate the content of their policies.  Purposes  The establishment of policies can help an organization demonstrate, both internally and externally, that it meets requirements for diversity, ethics and training as well as its commitments in relation to regulation and corporate governance of its employees. For example, in order to dismiss an employee in accordance with employment law requirements, amongst other considerations, it will normally be necessary to meet provisions within employment contracts and collective bargaining agreements. The establishment of an HR Policy which sets out obligations, standards of behavior, and documents disciplinary procedures, is now the standard approach to meeting these obligations. HR policies provide frameworks within which consistent decisions are made and promote equity in the way in which people are treated. HR policies can also be very effective at supporting and building the desired organizational culture. For example, recruitment and retention policies might outline the way the organization values a flexible workforce, compensation policies might support this by offering a 48/52 pay option where employees can take an extra four weeks holidays per year and receive less pay across the year. In actuality, policies and procedures serve a number of purposes: # They provide clear communication between the organization and their employees regarding their condition of employment. # They form a basis for treating all employees fairly and equally. # They are a set of guidelines for supervisors and managers. # They create a basis for developing the employee handbook. # They establish a basis for regularly reviewing possible changes affecting employees. # They form a context for supervisor training programs and employee orientation programs. Develop Human as resource In developing HR Policies, there should be clear and consistent statement of the organization's policies regarding all conditions of employment and procedures for their equal and fair implementation. In order to fulfill this objective, policies and procedures should be: * Clear and specific, but provide enough flexibility to meet changing conditions. * Comply with all appropriate law and regulation. * Consistent amongst one another and reflect an overall true and fair view approach to all employees. HR policies are developed by making decisions and taking actions on the day-to-day problems of the organization. The process of developing HR policies involves the assessment of the following factors: # Identify the purpose and objectives which the organization wishes to attain regarding its Human Resources department. # Analysis of all the factors under which the organization's HR policy will be operating. # Examining the possible alternatives in each area which the HR policy statement is necessary. # Implementation of the policy through the development of a procedure to support the policy. # Communication of the policy and procedures adapted to the entire organization. # Auditing the policy so as to reveal the necessary areas requiring change. # Continuous revaluation and revision of policy to meet the current needs of the organization.  Formulation  Human resource management consists of deliberate organizational activities designed to improve employee productivity and administration through such means as recruitment, compensation, performance, evaluation, training, record keeping and compliance. HR policies should be developed for key HR management functions covering eight commonly accepted responsibilities: # Compensation and benefits # Labor management relations # Employment practices and placement # Workplace diversity # Health, safety and security # Human resources information systems # Human resource research # Training and development''' The following steps should be taken when formulating or revising policies: # Gain understanding of the corporate culture and its shared values # Analyze existing policies: both written and unwritten existing policies. # Analyze external influences: HR policies are subject to the influence of many legislation, regulations and authorities, thus the codes of practice issued by the professional institutions should also be consulted. # Assess any areas where new policies are needed or existing policies are inadequate. # Check with managers, preferably starting with the organization's leadership team, on their views about HR policies and where they think could be improved. # Seek the view of employees about the HR policies, especially to the extent for which they are inherently fair and equitable and are implemented fairly and consistently. # Seek the view of the union's representatives. # Analyze the information retained in the previous steps and prepare the draft policies. # Consult, discuss and agree on policies with management and union representatives. In order to write the first draft of the policies as step 7 have stated, the following content should be included: * Policy name * Effective date of the policy and the date of any revisions * Approval status - At this stage, the status should be 'DRAFT' * References - list other policies or documents related to this policy * Purpose of the policy - what is it intended to promote or achieve * Main policy statement * Definition of any key concepts or terms mentioned in the policy need to be defined * Eligibility or scope - Any stakeholders are covered by the policy * How to deal with potential exceptions * Positions in the organizations responsible for implementing and monitoring the policy * Procedures for carrying out the policy - preferably written in numbered steps  Types  HR policies could be classified on the basis of sources or description.  On the basis of source  On the basis of their source, human resource policies could be classified into # Originated Policies - These are the policies usually established by the senior managers in order to guide their subordinates. # Implicit Policies - These are the policies which are not formally expressed; they are inferred from the behavior of managers. They are also known as Implied Policies. # Imposed Policies - Policies are sometimes imposed on the business by external agencies such as government, trade associations and trade unions. # Appealed Policies - Appealed policies arise because the particular case is not covered by the earlier policies. In order to know how to handle some situations, subordinates may request or appeal for the formulation of specific policies.  On the basis of description  On the basis of description, policies may be general or specific. # General Policies - These policies do not relate to any specific issue in particular. General policies are formulated by an organization's leadership team. This kind of policies is called 'general' because they do not relate to any specific issue in particular. # Specific Policies - These policies are related to specific issues like staffing, compensation, collective bargaining etc. Specific policies must confirm to the pattern laid down by the general policies.  Advantages  The following advantages are achieved by setting up HR policies: # They help managers at various levels of decision making to make decisions without consulting their superiors. Subordinates are more willing to accept responsibility because policies indicate what is expected of them and they can quote a written policy to justify their actions. # They ensure long term welfare of employees and makes for a good employer-employee relationship as favoritism and discrimination are reduced. Well-established policies ensure uniform and consistent treatment of all employees throughout the organization. # They lay down the guidelines pursued in the organization and thereby minimizes the personal bias of managers. # They ensure prompt action for taking decisions because the policies serve as standards to be followed. They prevent the wastage of time and energy involved in repeated analyses for solving problems of a similar nature. # They establish consistency in the application of the policies over a period of time so that each one in the organization gets a fair and just treatment. Employees know what action to expect in circumstances covered by the policies. Policies set patterns of behavior and permit employees to work more confidently.  Influential factors  The following factors will influence the HR policies of an organization:  Laws of the country  The various labour laws and legislation pertaining to labour have to be taken into consideration. Policies should conform with the laws of the country, state, and/or province otherwise they are bound to cause problems for the organization.  Social values and customs  Social values and customs have to be respected in order to maintain consistency of behavior throughout the organization. The values and customs of all communities should be taken into account when framing policies.  Management philosophy and values  Management philosophy and values influence its action on matters concerning employees. Therefore, without a clear, broad philosophy and set values, it would be difficult for employees to understand management.  Financial impact  HR policies may affect productivity and an organization's overall finances if they create unnecessary burdens or red tape for the organization's workforce. Organizations may also want to consider how realistic it is to enforce a policy fairly or keep it up-to-date as these have the potential to create issues amongst employees.

Based in Paris, France, the main goal of UNESCO is to end the world's poverty through collaboration and the exchange of scientific, cultural objects and education between nations. The book MacBride report was named after peace and human rights activist, Irish, Nobel laureate Se√°n MacBride. As of January 2019, The Organization has 193 members and 11 Associate Members. Task include analyze communication problems in modern societies, particularly relating to mass media and news, consider the emergence of new technologies, and to suggest a kind of communication order (New World Information and Communication Order) to diminish these problems to further peace and human development. Among the problems the report identified were concentration of the media, commercialization of the media, and unequal access to information and communication. The commission called for democratization of communication and strengthening of national media to avoid dependence on external sources, among others. Subsequently, Internet-based technologies considered in the work of the Commission, served as a means for furthering MacBride's visions. In the 1970's and 80's, major changes in media and communication were happening thanks to the MacBride report. They promoted policies directed at the liberalization of the Telecommunication market, monopoly powers as well as the comparative advantage, or dominance, of broadcasting and newspaper companies. While the report had strong international support, it was condemned by the United States and the United Kingdom as an attack on the freedom of the press, and both countries withdrew from UNESCO in protest in 1984 and 1985, respectively (and later rejoined in 2003 and 1997, respectively). The MacBride Commission The International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems was set up in 1977 by the director of UNESCO Ahmadou- Mahtar M‚ÄôBow, under suggestion by the USA delegation. Based in Paris, France and has over 50 offices around the world, It was agreed that the commission would be chaired by Se√°n MacBride from Ireland and representatives from 15 other countries, invited due to their roles in national and international communication activities and picked among media activists, journalists, scholars, and media executives. The members of the MacBride Commission were: * Elie Abel (USA) * Hubert Beuve-M√©ry (France) * Elebe Ma Ekonzo (Zaire) * Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez (Colombia) * Sergei Losev (Soviet Union) * Mochtar Lubis (Indonesia) * Mustapha Masmoudi (Tunisia) * Michio Nagai (Japan) * Fred Isaac Akporuaro Omu (Nigeria) * Bogdan Osolnik (Yugoslavia) * Gamal El Oteifi (Egypt) * Johannes Pieter Pronk (Netherlands) * Juan Somav√≠a (Chile) * Boobli George Verghese (India) * Betty Zimmerman (Canada), in substitution of Marshal McLuhan, then ill The commission presented a preliminary report in October 1978 at the 20th General Conference of UNESCO in Paris. The Commission's seminal session on new technologies to address the identified problems, was hosted by India at New Delhi in March 1979. The final report was delivered to M‚ÄôBow in April 1980 and was approved by consensus in the 21st General Conference of UNESCO in Belgrade. The commission dissolved after presenting the report. Because of controversy surrounding the report and the withdrawal of support by the UNESCO leadership in the 1980s for its ideas, the book went out of print and was difficult to obtain. A book on the history of the United States and UNESCO was even threatened with legal action and forced to include a disclaimer that UNESCO was in no way involved with it.

Miller later explained the cancellation, saying that he was concerned about \\"getting away from the traditional families\\", what he called \\"a very dangerous thing.\\" Miller noted that several individuals purchased automobiles from his dealerships as a form of support for the decision. He also expressed regret for any feelings that were hurt as a result. John Amaechi, a retired center who finished his career with Miller's Utah Jazz in 2003, publicly announced his homosexuality on February 7, 2007. Miller issued a statement the following day, conceding that he had made a bad decision in pulling Brokeback Mountain. He described it as a \\"knee-jerk reaction\\" and said that he would probably allow the film to be shown if faced with the same decision again; however he said he was still unsure how he would react to an openly gay player on his basketball team.Lya Wodraska, Miller says he now thinks 'Brokeback' ban was wrong , Salt Lake Tribune, February 8, 2007.

After completing a music degree at Southern University in Baton Rouge, he relocated to New Orleans. He taught at Southern University at New Orleans from 1974 to 2006. Biography Jordan was born in Crowley, Louisiana, and was raised during the time when rice farming was the predominant economic activity in the area. Jordan has noted that the music in southwestern Louisiana was \\"strictly Zydeco and Blues from way around, and that's what I came up listening to.\\" Zydeco musician Clifton Chenier hailed from the same area, as did tenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet (whose music teacher also instructed Jordan). Jordan's first instruments were C-melody and alto saxophones. While in high school, Jordan began performing \\"stock arrangements for three or four saxophones\\" with some older musicians, and immersed himself in the music of Charlie Parker. Jordan read transcribed solos in Down Beat magazine but also learned Parker's music by ear. He credits Illinois Jacquet with first giving him the idea of playing free improvisation, but was more profoundly affected by the free jazz of Ornette Coleman (who had previously performed in the area with blues bands). Jordan majored in music education at Southern University, attending the school at the same time as Alvin Batiste (his brother-in-law). He originally planned to become a classical alto saxophonist. He moved to New Orleans in 1955, and began playing frequent R&B; gigs with musicians such as Guitar Slim, Ray Charles, Big Maybelle, Big Joe Turner, Chuck Willis (with George Adams on baritone) and Choker Campbell. Jordan has described these gigs as being \\"satisfying for me, because there was a feeling that you'd get from dealing with that. I've played with some of the great female vocalists, from Gladys Knight to Aretha Franklin, or Big Maybelle, Little Esther, Lena Horne, and there's an aesthetic in dealing with those people that a whole lot of people don't get to. And the aesthetic from the Blues is a part of the thing that I want to have in my playing. I don't care how out it gets.\\" Jordan performs on tenor, baritone, soprano, alto, C-melody and sopranino saxophones, as well as contrabass and bass clarinets. He has indicated a preference for playing \\"outside\\" music (for example, free improvisation) on tenor, because he closely associates the alto with his earlier study of classical repertoire, tone, and technique. Jordan has performed and recorded with a wide selection of musicians in styles ranging from R&B; to avant-garde jazz, including Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, R.E.M., William Parker, Alvin Fielder, Archie Shepp, Fred Anderson, Ornette Coleman, Ellis Marsalis, Cannonball Adderley, Ed Blackwell, and Cecil Taylor. In 2008 he was awarded a lifetime recognition honor by the Vision Festival. In his performances and recordings his music is entirely improvised: \\"Everything you hear on my albums is improvised.\\" he explains. \\"It's collective improvisation, but there are no tunes. I tried writing down ideas a long time ago but I don't do that anymore.\\". The French Ministry of Culture recognized Jordan as a Knight (Chevalier) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1985. The French government bestowed him with their highest artistic award for his impetus as a visionary educator and performer. Jordan taught Donald Harrison and Branford Marsalis while the two were teenagers, and was an instructor at New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA). As an instructor of jazz studies at Southern University at New Orleans, Jordan encouraged his students to pursue new approaches to traditional musical forms. One of Jordan's students was trombonist Charles Joseph, who would go on to co-found the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. Jordan composed \\"Kidd Jordan's Second Line\\" for the Dirty Dozen Brass Band prior to their first European appearance in 1982, and has also performed with the band. In 2006, Jordan lost his home and most of his possessions during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. A few weeks after the hurricane, he recorded the album Palm of Soul in Brooklyn with William Parker and Hamid Drake. i in 2007 Kidd Jordan went west with Alvin Fielder and William Parker (musician) to play with Prince Lasha and John Handy in The Eddie Gale All Star band for the San Jose Jazz Festival On November 7, 2010. Kidd Jordan was Inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame in an event at Montrele's Bistro in New Orleans. Kidd Jordan Returned to Orleans. In 2011, the television series Treme featured a track from Palm of Soul, \\"Last of the Chicken Wings.\\" Jordan later made a brief appearance in Treme. Jordan's son Kent Jordan (de) is a jazz flautist.

The early Dhivehi scripts fell into the abugida category, while the more recent Thaana has characteristics of both an abugida and a true alphabet. An ancient form of Nagari script, as well as the Arabic and Latin scripts, have also been extensively used in the Maldives, but with a more restricted function. Latin was official only during a very brief period of the Islands' history. The language of the Maldives has had its very own script since very ancient times. It is likely that the first Dhivehi script appeared in association with the expansion of Buddhism throughout South Asia. This was over two millennia ago, in the Mauryan period, during emperor Ashoka's time. Manuscripts used by Maldivian Buddhist monks were probably written in a script that slowly evolved into a characteristic Dhivehi form. None of those ancient documents have been discovered yet and the early forms of the Maldivian script are only found etched on a few coral rocks and copper plates. Ancient scripts (Evƒìla Akuru) The most ancient Dhivehi script Dhivehi Akuru \\"island letters\\" is a script formerly used to write the Dhivehi language. Unlike the modern Thaana script, Divehi Akuru has its origins in the Brahmi script and thus was written from left to right. Dhivehi Akuru was separated into two variants, a more recent and an ancient one and christened \\"Dives Akuru\\" and \\"Evƒìla Akuru\\" respectively by Harry Charles Purvis Bell in the early 20th century. Bell was British and studied Maldivian epigraphy when he retired from the colonial government service in Colombo. Bell wrote a monograph on the archaeology, history and epigraphy of the Maldives. He was the first modern scholar to study these ancient writings and he undertook an extensive and serious research on the available epigraphy. The division that Bell made based on the differences he perceived between the two types of Dhivehi scripts is convenient for the study of old Dhivehi documents. The Dhivehi Akuru developed from the Grantha alphabet. The letters on old inscriptions resemble the southern Grantha of the Pallava dynasty and Chola dynasty periods of South India. However, this does not mean that the Maldives were dependent on those kingdoms, for the Maldives have been an independent nation for practically all their history. There has been very little interference, cultural or otherwise, from other neighboring kingdoms in South India and Sri Lanka. The early form of this script was also called Divehi Akuru by Maldivians, but it was renamed Evƒìla Akuru \\"ancient letters\\" in a tentative manner by H. C. P. Bell in order to distinguish it from the more recent variants of the same script. This name became established and so the most ancient form of the Maldive script is now known as Evƒìla Akuru. The ancient name of the Evƒìla Akuru was Dƒ´vƒ´ Grantha. This is the script that evolved at the time when the Maldives was an independent kingdom and it was still in use one century after the conversion to Islam. IAST). This table is provided as a reference for the position of the letters on all the tables. Evƒìla can be seen in the L≈çmƒÅfƒÅnu (copper plate grants) of the 12th and 13th centuries and in inscriptions on coral stone (hirigƒÅ) dating back from the Maldive Buddhist period. Two of the few copper plate documents that have been preserved are from Haddhunmathi Atoll. The oldest inscription found in the Maldives to date is an inscription on a coral stone found at an archaeological site on Landh≈´ Island in Southern Miladhunmadulu Atoll, where there are important Buddhist archaeological remains including a large stupa. The Landh≈´ inscription is estimated to be from the 8th century A.D. Even though long before that time Maldivian Buddhist monks had been writing and reading manuscripts in their language, older documents have not yet been discovered yet. The reason why even at that time the local script was known as \\"Dhivehi Akuru\\" by Maldivians was because another non-Maldivian script was used in the country. This was a Devanagari script related to the form used by Bengali and it had a ceremonial value. The oldest paleographically-datable inscription found in the Maldives is a Prakrit inscription of Vajrayana Buddhism dating back to the 9th or 10th century AD. This inscription is written in an early form of the Nagari script. Thus the name \\"Dhivehi Akuru\\" was used historically by Maldivians to distinguish their own writing system from foreign scripts. Foreign scripts were learned and introduced at that time when Maldivian monks visited the Buddhist learning centers of Nalanda and Vikramashila.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom, Barcelona 1999, Later Dhivehi or Dhives Akuru The last version of the Dhivehi script used after the conversion to Islam Among the Divehi Akuru scripts, the later form of the Dhivehi script was the script that evolved from the ancient Dhivehi script or Evƒìla Akuru after the conversion of the Maldives to Islam. It was still used in some atolls in the South Maldives as the main script until around 70 years ago. Since then it is rarely used, not even having a ceremonial role in scrolls of coats-of-arms or badges of government entities and associations, where Arabic is favoured. This script can be found on gravestones, old grants in paper and wood, and in some monuments, including the stone base of the pillars supporting the main structure of the ancient Friday Mosque in Mal√©. British researcher H. C. P. Bell obtained an astrology book written in Divehi Akuru in Addu Atoll, in the south of Maldives, during one of his trips. This book is now kept in the National Archives of Sri Lanka in Colombo. Apparently, the Dhivehi script was abandoned in other parts of the Maldives in favour of the modern Thaana script about 200 years earlier, perhaps at the beginning of the 18th century. Some modern Dhivehi historians want to believe that the Thaana script was introduced a few centuries before that. But the claim that the Thaana letters were devised in the 16th century is not supported by historical documents, for the oldest writing specimens in the Thaana script, interspersed with Arabic, are from the 18th century. The modern script Thaana, the contemporary official Dhivehi script Thaana is the first Dhivehi script written from right to left. It was inspired by numbers. It uses numerals as consonants and adds the diacritical (vowel) marks of the Arabic language. The first Thaana manuscripts are written in a crude early version of this script called Gabulhi Thaana (incipient Thaana), where the Arabic numerals have not yet been slanted 45 degrees and still look like numbers. Since no ancient writings in Thaana written before the 18th century have been found, it is doubtful that this script could be much older. The main reason why the Divehi Akuru were abandoned in favour of the Thaana script was owing to the need the learned Maldivians had to include words and sentences in Arabic while writing in the Dhivehi language. The most intriguing fact about the Thaana alphabet is its order (hƒÅ, shaviyani, n≈´nu, rƒÅ, bƒÅ, etc.). Its sequence does not follow the ancient order of the other Indic scripts (like Sinhala or Tamil) or the order of the Arabic alphabet. In fact, the order of the Thaana alphabet has no logic at all. This points to a likely esoteric origin of Thaana, namely to a script that was scrambled on purpose in order to keep it secret from average islanders. At their origin the Thaana characters, which are based on Arabic numerals and other symbols, were used in fandita (local magic or sorcery) to write magical spells. Many of these arcane incantations included Arabic quotations, which were written from right to left. Maldivian learned men, who were all well versed in sorcery, eventually saw the advantages of writing in this simplified hidden script. Hence, with the passing of time, Thaana came out of the shadows and was gradually adopted for everyday use. This script is currently in use as the sole Dhivehi writing system. While at their origin documents written in Thaana were full of Arabic words and quotations, the tendency is now to include as little Arabic script as possible, especially since special Thaana letters with dots were introduced to replace Arabic letters. The Thaana script is widely used nowadays by Maldivians both in official and unofficial documents, for the literacy rate of the Maldive society is very high by South Asian standards. Abolishment of the letter naviyani The letter naviyani ﬁ±, representing the retroflex nasal sound common to all Indic languages (Sinhala, Bengali, Hindi, etc.), was abolished from official documents in 1950 by Muhammad Amin, the ruler of Maldives. The reason why this particular retroflex sound was abolished and not others like Lhaviyani, Daviyani or Taviyani is not known. Letter Naviyani's former position in the Thaana alphabet was the nineteenth, between letters Daviyani and Zaviyani. It is still seen in reprints of traditional old books like the Bodu Tartheebu. It is also used by people of Addu and Fuvahmulah when writing songs or poetry in their language variants. The letter Shaviyani Letter Shaviyani (ﬁÅ) is the second letter of the Thaana alphabet. It represents the voiceless retroflex fricative , and is only found at the ends of words. The Dhivehi Akuru book In 1959, during Sultan Mohammed Farid's reign, former Prime Minister (and later President) Ibrahim Nasir expressed a wish to have a book written about the former Dhivehi script which by that time was largely ignored by Maldivians. Thus, he contacted As-Sayyid Bodufenvalhuge Sidi, an eminent Maldivian scholar, who swiftly obliged. Cover of the \\"Dhivehi Akuru\\" book written by Bodufenvalhuge Sidi By means of this small book Bodufenvalhuge Sidi (1888‚Äì1970) wanted to clearly show the fact that in ancient times Maldivians were writing from left to right in their own script. Hence Divehi Akuru is perhaps the only book ever written in Thaana that opens from the left side. As-Sayyid Bodufenvalhuge Sidi was one of the very few Maldivian people of modern times who understood the now-forgotten ancient Dhivehi letters in which parts of royal grants, warrants and deeds were written. He learnt this ancient script in Addu Atoll. Until early in the twentieth century, all government correspondence to and from Addu Atoll was written using these ancient Dhivehi letters. The last chapter of this book shows a text where the Dhivehi Akuru are coming along with Arabic script. As the reader acquainted with Dhivehi writing can see, this book is Volume 1 (evvana bai). Perhaps Bodufenvalhuge Sidi had the intention of publishing a second, or perhaps even a third volume on the subject. But he died before being able to do so. Even though H. C. P. Bell undertook very careful and thorough research on the Dhivehi documents, Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir's intention was to have a book on the ancient script of the Maldives written by a Maldivian. Prime Minister Nasir's request to Bodufenvalhuge Sidi was done in order to clarify Bell's misinterpretations, no matter how few. A staunch Maldivian nationalist, Nasir took this issue as a matter of national pride. Present day members of Maldivian cultural institutions are aware of the lacunae in Bell's research and of Bodufenvalhuge Sidi's valuable contribution to mend matters, but little has been done to correct those inaccuracies. Still, Bell's broad and valuable contributions to the study of the Dhivehi language and scripts should not be underestimated. Latin script Towards the mid 1970s, during President Ibrahim Nasir's tenure, telex machines were introduced by the Maldivian Government in the local administration. The new telex equipment was viewed as a great progress, however the local Thaana script was deemed to be an obstacle because messages on the telex machines could only be written in the Latin script. Following this, Dhivehi Letin, an official Latin alphabet, was approved by the Maldivian government in 1976 and implemented by the administration. Booklets were printed and dispatched to all atoll and island offices, as well as schools and merchant liners. This was seen by many as the demise of the Thaana script. Clarence Maloney, the American anthropologist who was in the Maldives at the time of the change, lamented the crude inconsistencies of Dhivehi Letin and wondered why the modern IAST Standard Indic transliteration had not been considered.Clarence Maloney; People of the Maldive Islands The Thaana script was reinstated by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom shortly after he took power in 1978. There was widespread relief in certain places, especially rural areas, where the introduction of Latin had been regarded as a preliminary to the introduction of infidel mores. However, the Latin alphabet of 1976 continues to be widely used.  Devanagari script for Mahl  Devanagari script for Mahal Although the Mahl dialect of the Dhivehi language spoken in the island of Minicoy in Union territory of Lakshadweep, India is also written mainly using the Thaana alphabet, in the 1950s a Devanagari script was modified to write the Maldivian dialect.

He is most famous for commanding the Pomorze Army in the Battle of Bzura during the invasion of Poland in 1939. Also notable for serving as president of the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America between 1961 and 1962. Education and the Great War Bortnowski was born on 12 November 1891 in Radom, Congress Poland, Russian Empire. Upon graduating from a gymnasium in Zhytomir, he enrolled into the Moscow State University as a medical student, only to transfer after one year to the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. There, he completed his medical studies. From 1908, he was a member of the Union for Active Struggle, and from 1912, a member of the Riflemen's Association. In 1913, he completed his training as a NCO, followed by his graduation as an officer in the ranks of the Rifleman's Association. With the outbreak of the Great War, Bortnowski interrupted his higher studies and joined the Polish Legions where he commanded a platoon in the ranks of the 1st Infantry Regiment. Next, as a Second Lieutenant, he commanded a company in the 5th Infantry Regiment, followed by a position as adjutant of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Brigade. On Christmas Day 1914, Bortnowski was wounded at the battle of ≈Åowcz√≥wek. Following the events of the Oath Crisis in 1917, he was arrested and interned at the Fort Beniamin√≥w POW camp in Beniamin√≥w from July 1917 until his release in April 1918. From his release from Beniamin√≥w to October 1918, Bortnowski acted as commander of the Krak√≥w branch of the Polish Military Organisation. Polish-Ukrainian War and Polish-Soviet War On October 31, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Bortnowski joined the Polish Army which was reborn after Poland had regained her independence at the conclusion of World War I. Initially, he led a company in the 5th Infantry Regiment, and was later promoted to lead a battalion of the 5th Infantry Regiment. In November 1918, he participated in both the Sieges of Przemy≈õl and Lw√≥w. From May 1919, Bortnowski worked as a Teaching Assistant during the very first post-war sessions at the War School of the General Staff of the War College in Warsaw. With the onset of the Polish-Soviet War, Bortnowski remained at his teaching position in Warsaw until December 1919. From October 10, 1919, he served as an operations officer of the Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division, composed mostly of his colleagues from the Polish Legions. Next, he served as Chief of the 3rd Operational Group Branch led by General Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy. Next, Bortnowski served as Chief of the 3rd Branch of the 3rd Army, and from October 1920, as Chief of Staff of the 3rd Army led by Zygmunt Zieli≈Ñski. Interwar period After the conclusion of the Polish-Soviet War, Bortnowski traveled to Paris, France, where he began training at the Ecole Superieure de Guerre on November 1, 1920. In September 1922, he graduated and returned to Poland where he received further training at various posts, notably in the staff of the Army Inspectorate in Wilno (modern Vilnius, Lithuania). On August 15, 1924, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel and in October of the following year, he became the commanding officer of the Kutno-based 37th Infantry Regiment. Dziennik Personalny M.S.Wojsk nr 106 z 15.10.1925 r. After the May Coup d'√âtat in 1926, he served as the Chief of the 3rd Branch of the General Army Staff for two months starting in November. In February 1928, he was appointed commander of the 26th Infantry Division in Skierniewice. Dziennik Personalny M.S.Wojsk. Nr 4 z 28.02.1928 r. From June 1930, he was transferred to Pozna≈Ñ where he was appointed commander of the 14th Infantry Division. In October 1930, was assigned to the Army Inspectorate in Toru≈Ñ as an officer. On November 1, 1931, he took command of the Zamo≈õƒá-based 3rd Legions Infantry Division, one of the most prestigious units of the Polish Army. On January 1, 1932, Bortnowski was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General by President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki. ZarzƒÖdzenie Prezydenta RP z dnia 10.12.1931 r. w: Dziennik Personalny MSWojsk. Nr 10 z 11.12.1931 r., s. 395 Starting from October 12, 1935, he served as an Inspector General of the Armed Forces at Toru≈Ñ. In the Autumn of 1938, Bortnowski took command of the Independent Operational Group Silesia which took participation in the occupation of Czechoslovak territory resulting from the Munich Agreement. Specifically, Bortnowski's troops occupied the Czechoslovak territory of Zaolzie. The popularity of Bortnowski after his successful invasion and occupation of Zaolzie was so great back in Poland, that he was planned to replace Marshal Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy as Commander-in-Chief when the latter was to run for the presidency in the planned 1940 elections. Prior to the outbreak of the September Campaign in September 1939, Bortnowski was promoted to the rank of Division General on March 1, 1939, and became the commanding officer of Pomeranian Army, the northernmost of the Polish armies to take part in the war. September Campaign During the September Campaign, also known as the Polish Defensive War, Bortnowski commanded the Pomeranian Army. Having been surrounded from two sides by Nazi German forces, the Pomeranian Army was forced to fight several bloody battles while retreating southwards towards Pozna≈Ñ and Warsaw, including the Battle of Tuchola Forest. On 9 September, Bortnowski subordinated the Pomeranian Army under the Pozna≈Ñ Army led by General Tadeusz Kutrzeba. Next, the combined forces of the Pomeranian and Pozna≈Ñ Armies took part in the Battle of the Bzura, a counter-offensive devised by Kutrzeba. Bortnowski's forces were most notable for fighting near the outskirts of ≈Åowicz and Sochaczew. On 14 September, he was ordered to retreat onto the northern side of the Bzura River which resulted in the definite retreat of both the Pomeranian and Pozna≈Ñ Armies towards Warsaw. On 21 September, Borntowski was captured by German forces and held as a prisoner-of-war. German captivity and post-war life Bortnowski spent the rest of World War II in various Nazi POW camps, such as Oflag IV-B Koenigstein, Oflag VIII-E Johannisbrunn and finally Oflag VII-A Murnau. Liberated in 1945 by American forces, he remained in exile after the war. Initially in Great Britain, where he was one of the founders of the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute in London, he eventually emigrated to the United States in 1954. He is most commonly associated with the Polish Independence League and the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America. He served on the Institute's committee starting November 30, 1954. From June 19, 1955, he served as the Institute's Vice-President, and was appointed President of the Institute in 1961 until 1962. He died on November 21, 1966 in Glen Cove, New York. His funeral took place five days later on November 26, where he was laid to rest at the Our Lady of Czestochowa Cemetery in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Controversy Prior to his death on September 22, General Miko≈Çaj Bo≈Çtuƒá, an officer serving in Bortnowski's Pomeranian Army, allegedly criticized Bortnowski's leadership during the September Campaign. He supposedly regretted that he had not, \\"during the first days of the war - during the Battle of Tuchola Forest, put a bullet through his (Bortnowski's) head and assumed command.\\" Additionally, he allegedly stated that \\"if I die, let it be known that the Army and I died because of this son-of-a-bitch.\\" The above-mentioned statements made by General Bo≈Çtuƒá were publicized by General Wiktor Thomm√©e. On the other hand, Bo≈Çtuƒá's statements regarding Bortnowski and his leadership during September 1939, were contrary to the general opinion of the other officers who had served under Bortnowski's command in the Pomeranian Army. General Bo≈Çtuƒá, who was remembered positively by Bortnowski himself, was supposedly hot-tempered in both word and action. During the September Campaign, Bo≈Çtuƒá dismissed both commanders of the two divisions which were part of his Operational Group. It is alleged that as a result of the bombardment during the Battle of Bzura, as well as the break-through towards the Modlin Fortress, Bo≈Çtuƒá may have suffered from a nervous breakdown. Bo≈Çtuƒá attributed Bortnowski the series of disastrous events of September 1939 which eventually resulted in Nazi Germany's and Soviet Russia's occupation of Poland. Specifically, Bo≈Çtuƒá criticized the \\"absurd\\" deployment of three large Polish Army units - the Pomeranian Cavalry Brigade, the 9th Infantry Division, and the 27th Infantry Division, into the Polish Corridor, which would allow Germany forces to cut Poland off from access to the Baltic Sea. Bo≈Çtuƒá was correct - General G√ºnther von Kluge's 4th Army quickly utilized this tactical botch. Kluge and his 4th Army captured the Corridor by smashing through the three Polish units, and cut off the rest of Poland from the Baltic coast, where several Polish coastal defense units remained and were forced to defend alone, which resulted in the notable Battle of Hel. On the other hand, General Bortnowski had known of this tactical absurdity and had unsuccessfully appealed several times to his superiors prior to the invasion. Bo≈Çtuƒá's reaction and criticisms may be justified through the Clausewitzian philosophy, where the commander of a losing army holds the heaviest burden for the loss, for he holds full responsibility for his army. With this interpretation, Bo≈Çtuƒá's criticisms of Bortnowski are justified in that Bortnowski was the commanding officer of the Pomeranian Army. R. Ziobro≈Ñ. Historia ≈ºo≈Çnierza tu≈Çacza.

It is built on Smith & Wesson's medium-sized K-frame. History Smith & Wesson's Models 16 and 17 have their origins with the company's Pre- World War 2 Hand Ejector series in the 1930s. These two revolver models debuted as companion pieces known as the Models K-32 and K-22 after World War 2. The K-32 Masterpiece (Model 16) debuted in 1935 and was chambered in .32 S&W; Long caliber. Production ceased during World War 2 and the revolver was reintroduced in 1947 along with the K-22 Masterpiece (Model 17) in .22 Long Rifle caliber. The Model 16 was dropped from production in 1983 due to the declining popularity of the .32 S&W; Long caliber and the Model 17 was discontinued in 1998 as the company focused less on blued steel revolvers at the time. Design The Model 17 has an adjustable rear sight and an un- pinned, fixed ramp or Patridge style front sight. It was designed as a target revolver and could be ordered from S&W; with \\"The Three T's\\" : Target Trigger, Target Hammer and Target Grips. Standard barrel lengths were 4\\", 6\\" and 8 3/8\\". The 4\\" model 17-6 is infrequently seen, as S&W; produced the almost identical, 4\\" barrelled, Model 18. The Model 18 was a Model 17 copy- except the 4\\" barrel was tapered where the Model 17 4\\" barrel was not. In 1990, S&W; also shipped the Model 17 featuring a 4\\", 6\\" or 8 3/8\\" full under lug barrel. The \\"under lug\\" was a solid, blued steel, circular rod, cast as part of the barrel, and running under the barrel from the front of the cylinder yoke to the muzzle's end.. The under lug not only enclosed the ejector rod, it also added considerable weight to the gun itself. The under lug model shipped with a special round butt wood grip that featured inletted finger grooves. The 4\\" Model 17 Under Lug is infrequently seen and quite possibly manufactured as an afterthought using factory shortened 6\\" or 8 3/8\\" under lug barrels. Derivatives=Model 18 & 617 The Smith & Wesson Model 18 (or the 22 Combat Masterpiece) was built on S&W;'s \\"K\\" Frame, (Smith & Wesson's designation for 'medium frame' firearms.) It was a tapered, 4-inch-barreled, double-action revolver, with adjustable open sights, chambered for the .22 long rifle. Many believe the Model 18 was designed as a training weapon for law enforcement officials and others who primarily carried Model 10's, 15's and 19's-.38 Special and .357 caliber revolvers. The Model 18 (like the Model 17) operates and handles in a similar fashion to these law enforcement models of the day; and closely shares the size, weight, grips, internal mechanism, and operation of several popular \\"K\\" framed revolvers like the Model 10 (.38 Cal.), Model 13 (.38 & .357 Cal.), Model 14 (.38 Cal.), Model 15 (.38 Cal.) and Model 19 (.38 & .357 Cal.) The only significant difference was the Model 18's .22 caliber. With the introduction of the Model 17 with full under lug barrels, Smith & Wesson also began production of the .22 caliber Model 617. This is the stainless steel version of the blued steel Model 17 .22 LR; however, all Model 617's have full under lug barrels. Offered in the same three barrel lengths as the Model 17, the 617 is still in current production and is shipped with rubber grips. The Model 617 is found with a six-shot or ten-shot, steel .22 LR cylinder. The only exception is the early production Model 617-2 which was made with a ten-shot, aluminium alloy .22 LR cylinder. Later \\"dash 2\\" 617's were shipped with stainless steel cylinders. Model 53 The Smith & Wesson Model 53 was introduced in 1961 in the .22 Jet caliber. It is a revolver of six round capacity built on the small K frame using a double action trigger. The .22 Jet cartridge had a listed velocity of 2460 fps using a 40 grain bullet, but actually reached 1700-1800 fps in the revolver. The Model 53 can also fire the .22 Short, Long, and Long rifle cartridges using chamber inserts. The hammer had a two position firing pin to allow it to be switched from rimfire to centerfire as needed. The handgun came with target handgrips and sights and in barrel lengths of 4, 6 and 8.3 inches. In the late 1950s there was considerable interest in the shooting community for revolvers chambered in various .22 caliber wildcat cartridges. Smith & Wesson sought to take advantage of this by unveiling a cartridge known as the .22 Remington CFM (Centerfire Magnum) cartridge or the .22 Remington Jet and chambered a version of the Model 17 in this caliber designating it the Model 53. The Model 53 was manufactured from 1960 to 1974. Present State The Model 17 was discontinued in 1998, but in 2009 was reintroduced as the Model 17 \\"Masterpiece\\" due to a resurgence in the popularity of vintage Smith & Wesson revolvers. The company chose approximately fifteen previously discontinued models to produce once again. This was done under the \\"Classics\\" category of S&W;'s current offerings.

Their best-known products are condenser microphones for broadcast, live and music production purposes. For several decades Neumann was also a leading manufacturer of cutting lathes for phonograph disks, and even ventured into the field of mixing desks for a while. History=Early years The company's original product was the CMV 3, the world's first commercially available condenser microphone. It was a rather large (40 cm tall, 9 cm diameter) microphone with several interchangeable capsule heads which gave it different directional patterns. Because of its shape and size, this microphone was often known as the \\"Neumann bottle\\". It is often seen in historical photographs of public events in Germany through the period of World War II. Neumann's factory in Berlin was damaged by Allied firebombing in November 1943. Georg Neumann relocated his company to the much smaller town of Gefell in Thuringia and resumed production at the beginning of the following year. At the close of the war, Thuringia fell under Soviet control and the company eventually became an East German \\"Publicly Owned Operation\\" (i.e. a state-run enterprise). After the reunification of Germany, the company in Gefell, which had continued to use the Neumann name, became known as Microtech Gefell. Meanwhile, Georg Neumann re-established his company as \\"Georg Neumann GmbH\\" in one of the Allied sectors of Berlin and in 1949 began producing a new model of switchable pattern microphone, the U 47, based on the M 7 capsule of the earlier CMV 3 series. This microphone was one of the first condenser microphones to gain widespread acceptance in the recording industry worldwide. In the United States, for example, the \\"sound\\" of the best-known crooners of the 1940s (e.g. Bing Crosby and later Elvis Presley) had utilized the ultra- smooth, rolled-off tone of RCA ribbon microphones; pop recordings in the 1950s (e.g. Frank Sinatra and later The Beatles) on the other hand were sharper, clearer, much more \\"present\\" and more \\"hi-fi\\"-sounding as the result of using condenser microphones with elevated upper-mid-range response. The U 47, which was distributed worldwide under the Telefunken brand name, was also used for some early classical orchestral recordings in stereo. Postwar period Neumann VMS70 Disc Cutting Lathe Other important microphones introduced by Neumann during the immediate postwar period included the M 49 and M 50, both based on designs researched and engineered at the NWDR in Germany. The M 49 used the M 7 capsule in a configuration whose directional pattern was remotely controlled, the first microphone to offer such a feature. The M 50 featured a small, diffuse-field equalized pressure transducer embedded in the surface of a 40 mm hard plastic sphere, which gave it increasing directionality above the mid-range frequencies. The company also produced equipment for electroacoustic measurement, including calibrated measurement microphones and chart recorders. During the period from 1953 to 1956 Neumann introduced a series of small condenser microphones (KM 53, 54 and 56) especially for use in television broadcast studios. In 1957 they introduced the SM 2 microphone, which was essentially a pair of KM 56 microphones in a single body, arranged so that their directional patterns could be controlled remotely. The SM 2 was the world's first stereo microphone. The end of the Fifties U47 Tube At the end of the 1950s, the Telefunken VF 14 vacuum tube on which the circuitry of the U 47 and U 48 had been based, was discontinued, so Neumann came under pressure to develop a successor. They decided to offer all three of those two models' directional patterns in a single microphone. In the meantime, the rock 'n' roll era had begun and some engineers were recording loud vocals with singers singing directly into microphones at very close range; when the U 47 or U 48 were used in this way, the result was considered by many engineers at the time to sound unacceptably harsh. (This could be considered ironic, since the U 47 and U 48 have a cult following today specifically for use in close-up vocals, with some engineers seeming to fancy that they are re-creating a \\"vintage\\" sound‚Äîwhereas in fact, they are creating a sound quality that was specifically abhorred by many of the \\"golden ears\\" of the era‚Äînotable exceptions being Beatles producer George Martin and engineers Norman Smith and Geoff Emerick.) The result was the U 67, a microphone with less emphasis in its upper midrange response, giving it less of a \\"forward\\" tone color. The U 67 uses a new capsule, the K 67. Unlike the K 47, the K 67 utilizes a two- piece backplate, allowing the diaphragms to be tuned separately and then matched to achieve the same front/rear response. The Sixties A Neumann U87 microphone In 1964 Neumann developed a small cardioid capsule with considerably improved off-axis linearity; it was used in the KM 64 and U 64 microphones. In 1965 Neumann began to introduce solid-state microphones. The first model was the KTM small cardioid, later followed by the \\"fet 70\\" series‚Äîtransistorized versions of small omnidirectional, cardioid and speech cardioid microphones as well as a \\"U 77\\" transistorized version of the U 67. This series used the 12-volt A-B powering system (parallel powering, T-power or \\"Tonaderspeisung\\") as found in Nagra tape recorders, and was therefore incompatible with existing studio power supplies. However, standard two- conductor shielded cables (as were commonly used for dynamic microphones) could now be used for connecting condenser microphones as well, obviating the need for special multi-conductor cables. In 1966 Neumann adapted the \\"phantom powering\\" method that had been used for years in certain telephone systems, so that a compatible method of powering would allow tube microphones, solid-state microphones and dynamic microphones all to be connected to the same power supplies. Eventually the \\"fet 80\\" series grew to include over a dozen models, some of which are still in production as of 2018‚Äîthe U 87, U 89, KMR 81, KMR 82 and USM 69. The best-known models from this series were the KM 84 small diaphragm cardioid and the U 87 three-pattern, large diaphragm successor to the U 67. The Eighties and beyond In 1983 Neumann began to introduce microphones with balanced outputs but no output transformer, starting with the model TLM 170. Eventually this \\"fet 100\\" or \\"transformerless\\" series was expanded to include the KM 100 modular series of small microphones (with seven different \\"active capsules\\" for various directional patterns), the cardioid TLM 193 (using the capsule of the U 89 and TLM 170), the small-diaphragm KM 180 series, the large-diaphragm cardioid TLM 103, the variable-pattern TLM 127 and the TLM 49 cardioid vocal microphone. Beginning in 1995 the company introduced a series of vacuum tube microphones with transformerless output circuitry: the multi-pattern M 149 Tube, the cardioid M 147 Tube, and the omnidirectional M 150 Tube (based on the classic M 50 design, with the pressure transducer mounted in the surface of a sphere inside the capsule head). In 2003 Neumann introduced their first microphone with built-in analog- to-digital conversion, the Solution-D D-01. In 2006, the D-01 was followed with a modular, small-diaphragm series of digital microphones, KM D, based on the KM 100/180 series. In 2005, Neumann began production of its first dynamic microphone, the BCM 705, for the broadcast industry. Neumann was acquired by Sennheiser Electronic GmbH in 1991. Production of Neumann microphones was moved into a newly built level 100 cleanroom factory in Wedemark, near Hannover. The company maintains its official headquarters in Berlin.

The eight executions in a 16-day period were the subject of an article, \\"Eight to Die in Arkansas\\", published in The Kansas City Star. Case facts The 21-year-old Hodges was convicted of killing a Clark County constable while resisting arrest. As described in court documents, Clark County Constable Morgan Garner, assisted by citizen J.E. Chancellor, arrested Hodges for the theft of a pistol and some small items of value. Hodges inquired as to whether Garner had a warrant for his arrest, to which Garner replied he did not. Hodges then refused to be arrested, at which point Garner produced his service pistol, ordering Hodges to put his hands up and submit to a search. Hodges did have a pistol on his person, but Garner, by Hodges' own admission, failed to find the weapon during a search of him. Hodges claimed that he was abused physically by Garner, and that while en route to the jail Garner threatened to shoot him. Hodges then claimed that he produced his own pistol, which Garner had not located, and fired in an effort to frighten Garner. Instead, Garner was shot twice, killing him. Hodges appealed his Clark County conviction and sentence of execution, but the Clark County decision was upheld. He was executed on December 18, 1914.

History When the programme was launched in 1974, it formed part of the long-running Grandstand Saturday afternoon programme, but from August 2001, it was a stand-alone show, and Grandstand was discontinued in 2007. The programme is now a weekly magazine, with reports from across the country at all levels of English and Scottish football. It previews the weekend's fixtures and provides updates from the early Premier League game. Since BBC have the rights to Premier League highlights, Football Focus also shows the key moments from the midweek matches. Prior to the launch of Match of the Day 2, it was often the first chance for free-to-air viewers to see analysis of the Sunday and Monday Premier League games.

After playing amateur football as a teenager in Cambridgeshire, he attracted attention from several Football League clubs and signed for Cardiff City in November 1995 for ¬£10,000. However, after making eleven appearances for the side, he was sold to Exeter City for the same price the following year. Flack remained with Exeter for ten years, making over 400 appearances in all competitions and becoming the club's fourth highest league goalscorer of all- time. He later briefly played for non-league sides Tiverton Town and Dorchester Town. Career=Early career Born in Cambridge, Flack grew up in the village of Orwell and played youth football for several local clubs before joining the village's football team Orwell, where his father Richard had played his entire amateur career. Making his senior debut as a left-back at the age of sixteen, he later converted to playing as a striker and finished as the club's top scorer in two seasons. The Orwell senior side was disbanded soon after and he instead joined Foxton where his prolific goalscoring attracted the attention of Cambridge City, joining the club in August 1994. While playing for Cambridge, he attracted attention from several Football League clubs, including Cambridge United, Lincoln City and Barnet, before signing for Third Division side Cardiff City in November 1995 for ¬£10,000. Cambridge United had already agreed a deal with Flack over a transfer but a late bid from Cardiff convinced him to move to South Wales. Prior to turning professional, Flack had worked as a hod carrier and bricklayer on building sites, competed as a boxer and been a stand-up comedian. He made his professional debut for the club on 13 January 1996 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Northampton Town, before scoring his first goal during a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Wigan Athletic on 16 March 1996. He made ten appearances in his first season of professional football, five coming as a substitute, but the arrival of Steve White at the start of the 1996‚Äì97 season saw Flack struggle to break into the first-team. Exeter City Having made just one appearance for Cardiff in the first two months of the season during a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Torquay United, Flack was sold to Exeter City in September 1996 for a fee of ¬£10,000, making his debut for the side in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion. In his first full season at the club, he scored 14 league goals in 41 matches. During the 2000‚Äì01 season, Flack suffered medial ligament damage during a match against Scunthorpe United in November 2000 but returned to the first-team after six weeks and went on to finish the season as the club's top scorer. In 2003, he suffered relegation from the Football League with Exeter, scoring the club's last goal in the league at the time on the final day of the season in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Southend United. Despite their victory, Swansea City survived after winning their final match, relegating Exeter to the Conference. Flack was the club's PFA representative and later commented on the financial difficulties they suffered, stating \\"Players weren't getting paid, some lost their houses, some lost their relationships. [...] There was loads going on ‚Äì it wasn't good.\\" Following their relegation, several clubs, including Hull City and Bristol Rovers who put in six-figure offers for the striker, made approaches to sign Flack but he rejected them in order to stay in Exeter where his family were settled. In January 2005, he played in Exeter's 0‚Äì0 draw at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the FA Cup. Flack took a pay cut in May 2005 and turned down a potential move to Stockport County in order to stay at Exeter, citing his desire to work with manager Alex Inglethorpe. The following season, Flack was mainly used as a substitute, although he did score the only hat-trick of his Exeter career in eleven minutes during a win over Southport on 4 March 2006, the fastest ever hat-trick scored for the club. He was awarded a testimonial match against Torquay United in July 2006 having spent ten years with Exeter, making over 400 appearances and becoming the club's fourth highest league goalscorer of all-time. At the time of his departure, he was the longest serving player at the club. Later career On 26 May 2006, Flack signed for Exeter neighbours Tiverton Town as a player‚Äìcoach, but on 7 December of the same year he joined Conference South club Dorchester Town on non-contract terms. He made his debut in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Braintree Town two days later, before scoring his first goal for the club in their following fixture, a 2‚Äì2 draw with Lewes. During his time at Dorchester, he scored twice in six appearances for the club. Flack was released on 1 March 2007 but complained that the club had done so without his knowledge, stating that he only discovered he had been released when an opposition manager contacted him and that he was owed wages by the club. However, Dorchester chairman Chris Pugsley refuted the claims. Flack later had further player-coach roles at Tipton St. John and Axminster Town. After retiring from playing professionally, Flack returned to the building trade and set up his own construction business.

It used a relatively unorthodox and visually distinctive combination of a twin boom fuselage and a pusher configuration, giving the aircraft a unique appearance. Work on the development of the 21 commenced at SAAB following a decision by the Swedish Air Force to embark on a large-scale expansion programme in preparation to fears that the nation might get dragged into the Second World War. The company designed a monoplane twin-boom aircraft, powered by a single Daimler-Benz DB 605B engine that was positioned within the rear of the fuselage, directly behind the pilot, that drove a rear-facing propeller, commonly known as a pusher configuration. This arrangement allowed armaments to be contained within the aircraft's nose section as well as providing the pilot with a high degree of external visibility. To safely enable the pilot to bail out without striking the propeller behind him, it was decided to adopt an ejection seat. On 30 July 1943, the 21 performed its maiden flight; on 1 December 1945, the first model of the fighter, the J 21A-1 was introduced to service. It was quickly followed by the improved J 21A-2, which featured a heavier armament arrangement, and the B 21A-3, which was a dedicated fighter-bomber mode of the type. In response to interest from the Swedish Air Force in adopting a jet- powered fighter, SAAB developed a conversion of the aircraft, using the British de Havilland Goblin as its powerplant. The jet-powered model of the aircraft was designated as the 21R. During the mid-1950s, less than ten years after its introduction, the 21 was withdrawn from service, having been replaced by a new generation of jet-powered fighters such as the de Havilland Vampire and the Saab 29 Tunnan. Design and development=Background In the run up to and during the early stages of the Second World War, the nation of Sweden was concerned that its neutrality in the conflict and its independence as a country could soon come under threat by one or more European nations becoming directly belligerent towards it. As an emergency measure enacted with the aim of increasing both combat preparedness and deterrence against would-be aggressors, the Swedish Air Force embarked upon a major expansion programme during the period of 1939‚Äì1941, which included the procurement of foreign-sourced aircraft as well as the indigenous development of new first-rate designs. However, as a consequence of the raging war across Europe, there were only a few nations that were willing to supply fighter aircraft to a small neutral country, while Sweden's own domestic production capability had been deemed to be insufficient until at least 1943. As a stop- gap measure, between February 1940 and September 1941, Sweden received a total of 72 Fiat CR.42 biplane from Italy, which the service designated as the J 11. However, the value of biplanes was rapidly diminishing in the face of increasingly capable monoplane fighters; thus, efforts to acquire more suitable aircraft continued.Cattaneo 1967, pp. 10-12. Meanwhile, Swedish aviation company SAAB had commenced original design studies into possible options for the development of a new fighter aircraft. Many of these options had been based around the use of a British Bristol Taurus engine and, unlike its previous designs, some of the studies explored were highly unconventional. One of the studied configurations was of a monoplane twin-boom aircraft, upon which the Taurus engine was positioned within the rear of the center fuselage, directly behind the pilot, to drive a rear-facing propeller mounted upon the rear of the fuselage, known as a pusher configuration. According to aviation author Bo Widfeldt, this unorthodox design made use of many features that were entirely new to Saab, but possessed several advantages over contemporary fighter aircraft that incentivised their pursuit, such as the ability to centralise a high amount of armaments upon the aircraft's nose section, a high degree of pilot visibility, and serviceability improvements.Widfeldt 1966, p. 3. While the design study was completed and showed promise, it remained dormant until 1941. That year, in response to pressure to provide a strong air defence component and faced with the prospect of improved imported designs being unavailable due to the war, Sweden decided to undertake an indigenous rearmament programme, which included the development and production of an advanced fighter aircraft. Accordingly, SAAB began studying the means to construct their radical proposal, a prospect which posed several problems that needed to be adequately addressed before proceeding to production. One early problem presented was the ability of the pilot to safely bail out without striking the propeller, which was behind his position. Many different solutions were examined, such as jettisoning either the propeller or the whole engine section via explosive charges prior to bailing out, before it was decided to adopt an ejection seat. It was a new technology, the 21 became one of the first service aircraft in the world to be fitted with an ejector seat. Design effort SAAB A21A-3 on display at S√∂derhamn /F15 Aviation Museum, S√∂derhamn, Sweden The SAAB 21 had an estimated top speed of 300 MPH, which required a powerful engine to generate sufficient thrust. Early on, it was decided to substitute the Taurus engine for the American Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp radial engine. However, Svenska Flygmotor AB was asked to provide an alternative to the Twin Wasp; options were limited by the very short timescale involved, thus a license-produced engine was the only plausible option. According, a localised version of Germany's new Daimler-Benz DB 605B inline engine, capable of producing 1,475 hp, was selected; however, due to the DB 605B's lack of maturity, a great deal of refinement and modification by Swedish engineers was required to de-bug and partially re- design the engine for operational use.Widfeldt 1966, pp. 3-4. A total of three prototypes were completed to support the programme; only two of these were flyable, while the third was a static airframe for stress testing purposes. On 30 July 1943, the first J 21 prototype conducted its maiden flight, flown by SAAB test pilot Claes Smith. During the takeoff, the wrong flap setting had been selected by the pilot, which resulted in the prototype struggling to get airborne, overrunning the runway and striking a fence at the end of the runway, damaging one of the landing gear legs while also managing to climb away. The maiden flight ended with a successful landing using the undamaged undercarriage units.Widfeldt 1966, p. 261. Further development Throughout 1945, several different options were explored with the intention of improving the 21's performance. During the first half of the year, the company had planned out a variant of the fighter that would be powered by a Rolls- Royce Griffon engine, capable of producing 2,000 hp and giving the 21 a projected top speed of 416 mph. Other projects, such as the studied SAAB 27, were also intended to use the Griffon; however, by the end of the year, all work on piston-engine upgrades had been abandoned. In parallel, SAAB and several other Swedish companies had been evaluating the options for the adoption of an innovative, brand new type of engine - the jet engine. Two early studies, designated as RX 1 and RX 2, had been examined, both of which being twin-boom aircraft similar to the 21.Widfeldt 1966, pp. 7-8. Recognising enthusiasm on the part of the Swedish Air Force for a jet-powered aircraft to be made available, during late 1945, SAAB resolved itself to producing a version of the 21 that would harness jet propulsion.Widfeldt 1966, p. 8. During 1947, at the behest of the Swedish Air Force, the 21 was subject to an extensive rebuilding programme, under which existing aircraft were converted to jet propulsion. The work required each aircraft to be extensively altered, receiving modifications to over 50 per cent of the airframe, tailplane and wing. Most significantly, each of the fighters was furnished with a single British-sourced de Havilland Goblin turbojet engine, which took the place of the DB 605B. The resulting jet-propelled fighter was adopted by the Swedish Air Force and became the service's first jet aircraft. In light of its extensive changes, rebuilt 21s were assigned the designation of J 21R.Erichs et al. 1988, p. 23. Design Artist's depiction of a J 21 inflight The Saab 21 was an unorthodox twin-boom pusher configuration fighter aircraft. It featured a low-mounted wing, a tricycle landing gear arrangement, and was furnished with heavy forward-firing armament.Widfeldt 1966, p. 4. Several recent innovations were incorporated into its design, such as an ejector seat for the pilot; the pusher layout later allowed the type to be readily modified with a turbojet engine as well. The advantages of a pusher design are of an unobstructed forward view for the pilot, while the armament can also be concentrated in the nose; however, a major drawback is difficulty in escaping from the aircraft in an emergency, as the pilot could get drawn into the propeller blades. Saab resolved this issue via the installation of an early ejector seat, developed by Swedish defense firm Bofors, which was developed in conjunction with the fighter itself.Erichs et al. 1988, p. 22. The wing of the 21 was based on a SAAB-designed low drag airfoil; as the wings could not reasonably accommodate recesses for the main landing gear when retracted, alcoves were instead provided within the tail booms, directly aft of the rear wing spar. Other systems, such as the center-section fuel tanks, were incorporated into the wing, which complicated their design considerably. To minimise drag, the coolers and ducts for the engine were housed within the contours of the airfoil between the fuselage and tail booms. The armament initially consisted of two 13.2 mm automatkanon m/39A (akan m/39A) autocannons in the wings and two more 13.2 mm akan m/39A autocannons and a 20 mm akan m/41A in the nose. On the A-2 model the 20 mm akan m/41 was replaced with a belt fed Bofors designed 20 mm akan m/45. On the J 21A-3 (later designated A 21A) it was possible to load rockets and bombs of various sizes and types. Later in the Saab 21's service life the 13.2 mm akan m/39 autocannons were rebarreled to fire American 12.7x99 mm ammunition due to economics. This was not a bad change though as the 12.7 mm AP-rounds had better performance than the 13.2 mm AP rounds and the Saab 21 was basically only viable as an attacker after WWII due to the jet era. Operational history On 1 December 1945, deliveries of the initial production model of the fighter, designated as the J 21A-1, commenced to the Swedish Air Force. Overall, 54 J 21A-1 fighters were constructed at SAAB's main plant in Trollh√§ttan; deliveries of this model continued until 5 December 1946, by which point it had been superseded by improved models. The J 21A-1 model was quickly followed by another 124 and 119 examples of the improved J 21A-2, which featured a revised armament arrangement, and the B 21A-3, a dedicated fighter-bomber, respectively. The type was used by the Swedish Air Force alone. In total, 298 J 21As were constructed prior to the production line being closed down during 1948.Widfeldt 1966, p. 6. During December 1945, the Svea Air Force Wing (F 8) became the first fighter unit to receive the J 21. During the following year, other units of the Swedish Air Force, such as G√∂ta Air Force Wing (F 9), also began to receive the type. However, within less than four years, some squadrons that had received the type were being re-equipped with a new generation of fighters harnessing jet propulsion for greater speed, such as the de Havilland Vampire.Widfeldt 1966, pp. 6-7. Despite the original intention for the type to be principally in air defence roles, in service, the J 21 was utilized mainly in the bomber role. According to Widfeldt, officials were often confused by its unconventional design and had doubts over the fighter's use and effectiveness.Widfeldt 1966, p. 7. In response to feedback that sought alternative options, the Swedish Air Board approached SAAB with a request to conduct design studies into the proposed development of a front- engine replacement, which was referred to as the J 23. This aircraft shared the same DB 605B engine as the J 21, but had a more traditional appearance; Widfeldt observed that the J 23 concept was visually similar to the North American P-51 Mustang, he also noted that its projected performance was beneath that of the existing J 21, which had been a key factor in the decision to persist with efforts to improve the existing fighter instead. Over time, the Swedish Air Force had become increasingly interested in jet propulsion and, as early as 1945, SAAB had been examining prospective modifications of the airframe to accommodate a jet engine in place of its piston engine. While production line J 21A series aircraft were first selected for conversion, the initial piston-engine version continued in production in five series \\"batches\\" that were completed in 1948‚Äì49. As a result of the conversion programme, the J 21A was phased out after 1954.Widfeldt 1966, pp. 8-9.

It aired on YLE between 2000 and -01. Though created in a form of a serious murder-mystery it is in fact a dark comedy with occasional absurd elements, technology and conventions (including a Deus Ex Machina). The cast of characters are from Julmahuvi's various fictional cop-series and there are also other references to Julmahuvi's previous productions. The name The name is a simultaneous pun on the Mennen brand of colognes (which plays a part in the story) and a Finnish saying equal in context to \\"easy come, easy go\\". Setting The series is set in a type of hyper reality where the events of television-series constantly clash with real-life. There appear to be no exact rules or borders as some shows are clearly staged while others take place in real life. Characters on television sometimes reflect as shining figures and while being broadcast are also surrounded by a glowing white aura. The reason as to why the real events of each show are taped and stored at the broadcasting center is never revealed and most characters appear oblivious to the fact. The character of Mats also breaks the fourth wall by consciously narrating the events of the story. Also, characters from the 70s period also appear in black and white whereas other characters like Mats and Rauski have somehow made the transition to colour. Characters=Mats One of the two stars of Z-Salamapartio (Z-Lightning Squad), a cop-show taking place in the 1970s (though jokingly filmed in a 60s black and white to emphasize the slow development of technology in Finland) and the main protagonist and narrator of the story. Mats is the patriotic and peppy half of the team who refuses to go along with any new fads. During his last case with Rauski, the latter shot him in the leg and he quit the team. 26 years later Rauski is found dead with a strange odor about him that unlocks Mats's suppressed memories. He then begins to solve a series of murders where the victims are all people who starred in cops-shows similar to Z-Salamapartio Raoul \\"Rauski\\" H√§kkinen Mats's partner, the cool-guy who loves to read the men's magazine Urkki and has a flair for cheap colognes. During their last case Rauski shot Mats in the leg which effectively ended their partnership. He also had an ongoing relationship with their French-speaking secretary Emmanuelle, who mysteriously lost her hearing. Mennen Tullen starts with Rauski being found dead at a subway station, the first in a series of subway related murders of cop-show stars. It is revealed that after their last case together Rauski attempted to keep the show afloat without Mats. The show gained the subtitle \\"Rauskin Enkelit\\" (Rauski's Angels) a parody of Charlie's Angels, introducing two unnamed female protagonists. Unfortunately each episode consisted only of Rauski's drunken ramblings and thus it can be assumed that his show was quickly cancelled. Berner One of the stars of Die K√ºhe (= the cows) a parody of German cop shows from the 80s. Berner is the younger of the two officers and one of the protagonists of Mennen Tullen. Berner decides to help Mats solve the murder mystery when his partner Dieter is kidnapped during his retirement party. It is revealed during Mennen Tullen that Berner and Dieter were dancers in the 70s (during Mats' and Rauski's last case) at an underground disco, which may explain the origins of Dieter's bad cough. Berner also appears to have some slight homosexual preferences. He also has a tendency to utter nonsensical one-liners (at the beginning of a chase scene he says Eine Kleine Nachtmusik), like Dieter he constantly speaks German yet others are able to understand him without difficulty and even talk back with their own mother tongue (Finnish or English). Dieter Berner's superior and partner on Die K√ºhe, an elderly looking officer with a progressively worsening caugh and an antipathy towards Turkish immigrants (which Berner shares to a degree). Dieter is kidnapped during his retirement party which prompts Berner to help Mats solve Rauski's murder-mystery. It is also revealed that Dieter and Berner were dancers prior to becoming TV-cops, while scantily glad at an underground disco, which may explain the origins of Dieter's caugh. James A psychic cop from the 90s style cop-show Pimeyden Tyyny (The Pillow of Darkness) commercials of which ran on Studio Julmahuvi though no full episodes were ever made. His constant companion is the anthropomorphic [The] Shark Man. After the cancellation of their show James and The Shark Man have become musicians performing at clubs. James only speaks English yet everyone is able to understand him, James also always understands the person talking back at him, despite the language of the speaker. City Gnomes City Gnomes are a suppressed minority, with elf- caps and long beards, whose lifestyle is threatened by the constantly increasing digging in the city's landscape. The gnomes are beginning to take direct action by invading underground bunkers and organizing protests. The gnomes bare a fading similarity to radical groups as an intentional parody. Kalervo Friman The TV executive with an anti-subway agenda who kidnapped Emmanuelle and set a trap for Raoul and Mats in order to cause an accident and shut down the building of the subway.

The Ending and the Deus Ex Machina The story concludes in a bizarre manner when Mats' repressed memories of his and Rauski's last case come to him. He realizes that he is the cause of the events which have taken place. At end of their last case he forced Emmanuelle's kidnapper, Kalervo Friman (a TV-executive with an anti- subway agenda ), to drink an entire one liter bottle of Mennen-brand cologne while Mats himself was hallucinating from the fumes. Rauski, trying to stop him, shot Mats in the leg. Friman became disfigured and his vocal-chords were also burned by the Mennen. After his disfigurement he only received supporting parts on the cop shows and began a murder spree in order to get his revenge. Friman had planted a bomb to stop the building of a subway network. Emmanuelle was too close to the bomb when it exploded and lost her hearing due to the explosion. After she manages to say \\"Mennen Tullen\\" (which the inebriated Mats kept repeating as he doused Friman), Mats comes to the realization that for years he had believed that his hallucinations were how the events actually turned out: a happy get-together at the Z-Salamapartio headquarters with champagne and a job-offer for the disgruntled Friman. Mats then sneaks in to the broadcasting center and rewinds the Master Tape of the incident to the point in time before he opened the bottle and somehow takes over his own body and prevents the horrific chain of events from taking place.

As part of their training, the two attended evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art between 1888 and 1894, and it was there that they met the MacDonald sisters, Margaret and Frances.

Influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, and other European movements such as Symbolism and Art Nouveau, they pioneered the Glasgow Style. MacNair set up his own studio in Glasgow in 1895, where he worked as a designer producing furniture, book illustrations, water colours and posters. MacNair's artistic merits have often been compared unfavourably to those of Mackintosh, but he had significant influence as a teacher following his move to Liverpool in 1898 and appointment as Instructor in Design at the School of Architecture and Applied Art. In 1899 Frances Macdonald joined MacNair in Liverpool and the two married. The couple painted watercolours and designed interiors, exhibiting a Writing Room at the International Exhibition of Modern Art in Turin. They also exhibited in Liverpool, London, Vienna and Dresden in the early 1900s. Following closure of the School in 1905, and the loss of the MacNair family wealth through business failure, the couple returned to Glasgow in 1909. MacNair's career went into decline from this period, and no works of his are known beyond 1911. Later life In 1913 McNair was working in Canada, in a chocolate factory and later a railway company.James Herbert McNair. Mackintosh Architecture, University of Glasgow. Retrieved 27 May 2017. He returned to Glasgow where he worked as a postman and as a manager in a garage. After the death of his wife in 1921, MacNair destroyed all of their works that he had in his possession. He then moved to an old people's home, where he lived until his death in 1955.  References  Further reading  * Robertson, Pamela, ed.

History left _School History_ Starting humbly with three rented double stories building in Jalan Genting Klang of Kuala Lumpur, the school was founded in 1919. With increasing numbers of students, the Board of Directors raised funds to purchase the property land where the Chong Hwa Primary School is situated today. In 1922, the new campus was set with only four classrooms, an office and a library. To accommodate the increasing number of students, a two-story brick building was built in 1938 and in the year of 1939, the first coeducation school was established and officially named as Selangor Chinese Primary & Secondary School. Mr. Liang Long Guang (Ê¢ÅÈæôÂÖâ) was the first principal for the school. Soon after, the school anthem was composed with the aid of the music teacher, Mr. Chen Luo Han (ÈôàÊ¥õÊ±â). The secondary school introduced both art and science streams and its reputation increased over time. The school has over 900 students with students from as far as Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. In the year of 1940, Mr. Liu Jing Sheng (ÂàòÁªèÁîü) was appointed as the principal after the resignation of Mr. Liang. Owing to the Education Act in that period of time, the secondary school has to be shifted to Jalan Gombak. During the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, the school was forced to close down. The school was destroyed during the war and what was left were ruins. Books, instruments, teaching aids, and efforts over the years were all shattered. After the retrocession of Malaya in 1945, the primary school was reopened on 1 November 1945, followed by the secondary school on 26 March 1946. The secondary school was temporarily set up on the field opposite to the primary school. In the year of 1954, under the administration of Mr. Ye Shao Chun (Âè∂Â∞ëÊò•), the school increased its size to 2,000 students. However, there were insufficient classrooms and the construction of the new campus could not be commenced. Thus in 1955, the secondary school had to temporarily borrow 16 classrooms from the primary school due to the growing numbers of students. The new Gombak Road secondary school construction was then finally started in 1957 and was completed on July 1958. The school has then expanded to 30 classrooms and the number of students went up to more than a thousand and three hundred people. The primary school accepted the subsidies from the government and became a standard Chinese primary school. Hence, the secondary school was separated from it. Four years later in 1962, the school was split into the Chinese Government Secondary School (SMJK Chong Hwa) and Chong Hwa Independent High School with each having the morning and afternoon session classes respectively. Mr. Chen Dick Long (ÈïøËø™Èæô) was officially appointed as the principal of SMJK Chong Hwa in 1979. In 1982, Chong Hwa Independent High School has then moved to Jalan Ipoh, while SMJK Chong Hwa remains in Jalan Gombak. From there on, the school continued to grow. Computer classes were first introduced in the year of 1985 along with the organisation of the Students' Federation to encourage students and school staff to work together to foster the spirit of autonomy and willingness, preventing adverse social influence to the students while eventually improving the quality of the students. Along the year, the school has constantly improved to enrich the students and in 1994 three air-conditioned auditoriums were set up to provide a better schooling environment. On 8 September 1994, Mr. Li Yu Chai (ÈªéÁÖúÊâç) was appointed as the acting principal after the retirement of Mr. Chen Di Long. Mr. Chen Bao Wu (ÈôàÂÆùÊ≠¶) then officially took up the position of the school principal in 1995. In 1999, in order to accommodate the Form Six students, the school has prepared four comfortable air-conditioned classrooms to provide the students with a proper environment for study. At the same year, the school has also refurbished the basketball courts, which were used for school activities. On 16 October 1999, Mr. Zhou Fu Chai (Âë®Á¶èÂΩ©) was appointed as the school principal after the retirement of Mr Chen Bao Wu on 8 August that year. Mr. Zhou Fu Chai has brought SMJK Chong Hwa to yet another reputable standard in his eight years of serving as the school principal. He then retired on 19 April 19, 2008 and Ms. Liu Yue Yao (ÂàòÁé•Áë∂) was appointed as the next, and also the first, female principal in the school. Ms. Liu was then transferred to SMK La Salle, Sentul on 23 August 2009, then replaced by Mr. Leong Kum Loy (Ê¢ÅÈáëÊù•). Unfortunately, Mr. Leong is not fluent in Chinese and thus, he was then transferred to SMK St.John on 15 November 2009. On 16 November 2009, Mr. Chai Chit Chuen (Ëî°Ê§çÁæ§) was appointed as the school principal and served the school until 14 March 2014. He was succeeded by Mr. Goh Chee Chiang (Âê¥ÂøóÂº∫) on 17 March 2014. During Mr. Goh's term of office, much progress was made in term of the school developments. With the guidance and assistance of the school Board of Directors, much progress was made in term of the school physical and infrastructure developments. The building of the school multi purpose hall and classrooms below it was completed in 2016. In 2017 Chong Hwa NTSS successfully applied for single session school and also allowed to participate in the DLP Program (Dual Language Program) for the teaching and learning of STEM subjects in English. The academic and co-curriculum performance has also shown tremendous improvement especially in the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) examinations. The percentage of SPM examination qualifiers (with Malay Language & History subjects passes) has improved from 72% in 2014 to more than 91% in 2019.

She sank in Liverpool Bay in 1865 in an incident that caused 46 fatalities. History Lelia was built by William C Miller & Company of Toxteth as one of a trio of blockade running sister ships ordered for the Anglo-Confederate concern, William G. Crenshaw & Company. She was a paddle steamship of 640 BRT. Her hull was built of steel, an unusual and expensive material for shipbuilding at the time. The engines and other machinery were built by Fawcett Preston & Company and rated at 300 nhp. (The Confederate States Navy warship, CSS Florida, had also been built at Miller's yard.) She left the River Mersey, with a largely Liverpool- based crew, and several prominent Confederate naval officers, on her maiden voyage on 14 January 1865 bound for Wilmington, North Carolina, via Bermuda, aiming to run the Union blockade. Lelia was heavily laden, and when she hit bad weather off the coast of North Wales, large waves knocked her anchors loose and through the deck, swamping her. She sank near the lightship Prince off the Great Orme. Two boats were able to leave the stricken ship, but one capsized and only twelve survivors (out of fifty-one on board) reached the safety of the lightship. The next day the Liverpool No 1 Lifeboat went to the scene, but was itself swamped by waves, with the loss of seven out of its 11 crew. Wreck The wreck of Lelia was discovered in the early 1990s when a diver recovered a bell from the seabed inscribed 'Lelia 1864'. It lies 10 miles north west off Hilbre Point, Wirral. The remains include one of the paddle wheels, the engine and boiler rooms, as well as less well-preserved cargo areas and a steam winch. The wreck was given protected status when it was added to the National Heritage list for England by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in August 2019.

He played 362 matches and scored 42 goals for Danish club Esbjerg fB, and played for a number of European clubs. He played 69 matches and scored two goals for the Denmark national football team, and represented Denmark at the UEFA Euro 1984 and 1986 FIFA World Cup tournaments. Club career Born in the Esbjerg suburb of Guldager, Bertelsen started playing football with small-time club S√¶dding-Guldager. When S√¶dding-Guldager coach and former Danish international Egon Jensen was hired by 3rd Division team Esbjerg fB, Bertelsen followed him to the club, where he played alongside later Danish internationals Ole Kj√¶r, Ole Madsen, and John Lauridsen. He made his Esbjerg debut at the age of 21, on 1 April 1973. He was a hard-working defensive midfielder, and helped the team win promotion to the top-flight Danish 1st Division. In 1976, he was named man of the match as Esbjerg won the Danish Cup tournament, Esbjerg's first trophy in 11 years. In the 1st Division, Bertelsen helped Esbjerg finish third in 1977, second in 1978, and finally win the 1979 Danish football championship. He was subsequently named 1979 Danish Player of the Year by the Danish Football Association. He received a number of offers from European clubs, and decided to move abroad in May 1982. He signed a professional contract with Belgian club R.F.C. Seraing, and quickly settled into the team. He stayed two years in Belgium, before moving on to French outfit Rouen FC when Seraing went bankrupt in 1984. After one season with relegation battlers Rouen, he moved to Swiss team FC Aarau in the summer of 1985. Bertelsen returned to Esbjerg fB in 1987, where he ended his career at the end of the 1988 season.

He played his second game in February 1978, and went on to become a mainstay in the team under new national manager Sepp Piontek. Bertelsen had a somewhat anonymous role in the defensive midfield,Rebecca Vang, \\"Fortidens stjerner: Den vestjyske slider\\", Politiken, 9 January 2005, p.12. though his work rate made him an integral part of the team. While playing abroad, Bertelsen was called up by Piontek to represent Denmark at the UEFA Euro 1984. He played full-time in all Denmark's four games before elimination in the semi-finals. He was also called up for the Danish squad at the 1986 FIFA World Cup. He played three of Denmark's four games at the tournament.

Vail as he appeared in 1900 Charles Henry Vail (April 28, 1866 ‚Äì June 16, 1924) was an American Universalist clergyman and Christian socialist political activist and writer. Vail is best remembered as the first National Organizer of the Socialist Party of America and as a candidate of that party for Governor of New Jersey. Biography=Early years Charles Henry Vail was born in Tully, New York on April 28, 1866. He attended public school in Tully and learned the trade of barrelmaker upon completion, working with his father for several years in that field.\\"Life of Charles H. Vail,\\" The Socialist (Seattle), whole no. 108 (August 31, 1902), pg. 2. Vail also showed considerable aptitude in the field of music and so he went to New York City to study under Dr. H.R. Palmer, a course which he completed in 1885. Thereafter, he taught large classes in both vocal and instrumental music throughout New York City. In addition to group lessons, Vail conducted private lessons in voice, banjo, guitar, clarinet, and organ. In 1887 he moved to Syracuse, New York, where he continued to teach music for the next two years. Although raised as an orthodox Protestant in the Disciple Church, Vail came to question some of its fundamental teachings and he turned to Universalism, ironically spurred to this belief by an anti-Universalist book purchased by his parents to dissuade him from that belief system. Vail became an enthusiastic adherent of Universalism and came to consider the propagation of its message to be his life mission. Vail enrolled in the Theological School of St. Lawrence University at Canton, New York. He graduated in 1892 with a Bachelor of Divinity degree, but remained through 1893 to take a graduate course. Vail's 1899 book Principles of Scientific Socialism was one of the standard introductions to the subject during the first two decades of the 20th century. A translation was published by Finnish-American socialists in Oregon in 1911. In August 1888, Vail married Mary C. Ellis of Owasco, New York, but his wife fell ill and lived only a short time. He was married a second time in July 1892 to Niva Bedell of Geneva, New York, a classmate from divinity school and fellow graduate of the class of 1892. Vail's first pastorate was in Albany, New York, where he spent a year at All Souls Church. He then moved to the First Universalist Church of Jersey City, New Jersey, remaining in that post for the next seven years. Political career Although raised as a Republican, Vail's political opinions shifted fairly rapidly, turning to socialism. In 1898 Vail and his second wife, Nina Bedell Vail, herself an ordained Universalist minister, were both designated deputy organizers of the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth, an organization which was attempting to establish socialist colonies in Washington state.\\"Organization Department,\\" Industrial Freedom [Edison, WA], vol. 1, no. 29 (November 19, 1898), pg. 3. At the end of 1900, Vail resigned his pastorate and accepted a job as the National Organizer of the Social Democratic Party of America, forerunner of the Socialist Party of America. In this capacity, Vail toured the United States speaking on various socialist topics for seven of the first nine months of 1901, traveling over 14,000 miles and visiting 19 states. He was accompanied by his wife Nina, who often shared the platform with him. On January 1, 1901, Vail was nominated by the Social Democratic Party of New Jersey as its candidate for Governor of New Jersey.

Life Kocharli was born in 1863 in Shusha being the only child of Ahmad bey Kocharli. Firidun graduated from the local Russian-Muslim school and was admitted to the Transcaucasian Teachers Seminary in Gori. Upon receiving his diploma in 1885, he started teaching Azerbaijani and religion at a Russian-Muslim school in Erivan. Literaty Criticism by Shams Rufullayeva In 1895 he was invited back to Gori to teach in his alma mater. Firidun bey Kocharli: National Teacher and Outstanding Philologist by Galina Mikeladze. Azerbaijanskie Izvestia He was one of the first Azerbaijani literati to raise questions about standards for the written Azerbaijani language. In 1895 he wrote his first article Tatar Comedies (\\"Tatar\\" was a common Russian name for Azerbaijanis before 1920), followed by Essays on Our Literature (1904). In 1903 he published his first academic work entitled Literature of the Azerbaijani Tatars, a critical piece that contains information on 130 Azerbaijani writers and poets. In the following years he published some smaller works like Mirza Fatali Akhundov (1911) and Gift to Children (1912). Kocharli also translated works of European, mostly Russian authors into Azerbaijani. His major academic work is Topics on the History of Azerbaijani Literature, which was published only in 1925, five years following his death. It was one of the first successful attempts to compile scientific data on the history and development of Azerbaijani literature. Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli, who greatly admired Kocharli, had published Yusif Bey Vazirov (Chamanzaminli), A Glimpse of Azerbaijan Literature (Istanbul: Istanbul Publishing House 1337 (1921), 103 pages.

In 1917‚Äì1918 he was member of the Azerbaijani National Council. In 1918‚Äì1920 Kocharli was elected to the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. In spring 1920, during the Soviet invasion of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918-1920), Armenian dashnaks (members of the chauvinist Armenian party \\"Dashnaksutiun\\") pretending to be Bolsheviks, arrested Kocharli, who had no guilt, and took him to Ganja. After two days when special envoys were sent from Baku to Ganja to release Kocharli, it was late. Dashnaks had already killed him without holding a trial. At the time of his death, Kocharli was the Principal of the Gazakh Teachers Seminary that was founded in 1918 at his request. He was married to Badisabah Kocharli, n√©e Vakilova, a Gazakh-native teacher who later worked in Baku, Zagatala and Shaki. Heritage In the Soviet era, Kocharli's works remained largely unknown due to his political affiliation with the anti-Communist Musavat Party. It was not until 1957 when Bakir Nabiyev, a graduate student in the Azerbaijan State University, started researching the heritage of Kocharli accessing archives and interviewing some of his surviving colleagues and students. In 1960 Nabiyev published the first monograph dedicated to the contributions of Kocharli into scientific literature.

As of 2020 Forbes has listed his net worth at US$ 3.8 billion. He has interests in education, and founded leading pharmacy college (Nirma Institute of Pharmacy)and a leading engineering college/ university . Life Born into a farmer family from north Gujarat, Karsanbhai finished his B.Sc. in Chemistry at age 21 and worked as a lab technician, first in the New Cotton Mills, Ahmedabad, of the Lalbhai group and then at the Geology and Mining Department of the state Government. In 1969, Karsanbhai started selling detergent powder, manufactured and packaged in his backyard. This was an after-office business - a one man company. Karsanbhai would cycle through the neighbourhoods selling handmade detergent packets door to door. At a price of Rs. 3 per kg, (one third the price of leading detergents), it was an instant success. Karsanbhai branded his detergent soap, Nirma, after the name of his daughter. After three years, Karsanbhai felt confident enough to quit his job. Later he said, \\"The lack of any such precedent in my family made the venture fraught with failure. But farmers from North Gujarat are known for their spirit of enterprise.\\" Karsanbhai set up shop at small workshop in an Ahmedabad suburb. The Nirma brand quickly established itself in Gujarat and Maharashtra. The high quality and low price of the detergent made for great value. Fuelled by housewife-friendly advertisement jingles, Nirma revolutionized the detergent market, creating an entirely new segment in the market for detergent powder. At the time, detergent and soap manufacture was dominated by multinational corporations with products like Surf by Hindustan Lever, priced around Rs. 13 per kg. Within a decade, Nirma was the largest selling detergent in India. Since production was labour-intensive, Nirma also became a leading employer (employing 14,000 people 2004). Made without some phosphates, Nirma was also somewhat more environment friendly. After establishing its leadership in economy-priced detergents, Nirma entered the premium segment, launching toilet soaps Nirma bath and Nirma beauty soap, and premium detergent Super Nirma detergent. Ventures into shampoo and toothpaste were not as successful, but the edible salt Shudh is doing well. Nirma beauty soap is one of the leading soaps, behind Lifebuoy and Lux. Overall Nirma has a 20% market share in soap cakes and about 35% in detergents. Nirma also has successful operations in neighbouring countries. In 1995, Karsanbhai started the Nirma Institute of Technology in Ahmedabad, which grew into a leading engineering college in Gujarat. An Institute of Management followed, with the entire structure being consolidated under the Nirma University of Science and Technology in 2003, overseen by the Nirma Education and Research Foundation. The Nirmalabs education project, aimed at training and incubating entrepreneurs, was launched in 2004. Karsanbhai's two sons, daughter and son- in-law are now at leading positions in the Nirma organization: Rakesh K Patel (MBA) looks after procurement and logistics, Hiren K Patel, chemical engineer and MBA, heads marketing and finance, while Kalpesh Patel is in human resources and Healthcare Industry (Nirlife healthcare).Rakesh Patel's son name is Raj Patel. Awards and recognition In 2009, Karsanbhai was ranked #92 by Forbes magazine, for the list of India's Richest persons. In 2001, Karsanbhai was awarded an honorary doctorate by Florida Atlantic University, recognizing his exceptional entrepreneurial and philanthropic accomplishments. In 1990, the Federation of Association of Small Scale Industries of India (FASII), New Delhi, awarded him the 'Udyog Ratna' award. The Gujarat Chamber of Commerce felicitated him as an 'Outstanding Industrialist of the Eighties'. He has served twice as Chairman of the Development Council for Oils, Soaps and Detergents. Patel has been conferred with Padma Shri Award for the year 2010. The award was formally conferred by the President of India Mrs Pratibha Patil. It was also announced on June 7, 2013 that he bought 40 crores six-seater chopper. After Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani and Zydus group promoter Pankaj Patel, Karsanbhai is the third Ahmedabad-based industrialist to buy a chopper. In 2017, Karsanbhai was ranked #38 by Forbes magazine, for the list of India's Richest persons ($640 million). In 2019, Karsanbhai was ranked #30 by Forbes magazine for the list of India‚Äôs richest persons.

It is thus a combination of metrorrhagia and menorrhagia. Causes It can occur due to any of several causes, including hormonal imbalance, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, usage of progestin-only contraception, or cancer. Not least, it can be caused by deficiencies of several clotting factors. It can lead to anemia in long-standing cases. Diagnosis The initial workup includes exclusion of pregnancy and cancer, by performing a pregnancy test, a pelvic exam and a gynecologic ultrasound. Further workup depends on outcomes of the preceding tests and may include hydrosonography, hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy, and magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment Treatment depends on the cause. In cases where malignancy is ruled out, hormone supplementation or the therapeutic use of hormonal contraception is usually recommended to induce bleeding on a regular schedule. Selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) are sometimes used to stop uterine bleeding. Epidemiology It occurs in up to 24% of women ages 40-55 years.

As a member of Z Special Unit Lyon took part in a number of commando operations against the Japanese and was killed during Operation Rimau while attempting to infiltrate Singapore harbour and destroy Japanese shipping there in 1944. Early life Born on 17 August 1915, Lyon was the second son of Brigadier General Francis Lyon, Royal Artillery, a senior British Army general staff officer during the First World War and the grandson of Colonel Francis Lyon, Royal Horse Artillery, who had fought in the Indian Mutiny. He was educated at Harrow and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst,Thompson and Macklin 2002, pp. 18‚Äì19.p and in 1935 was commissioned into the Gordon Highlanders before being posted to Singapore in 1936.Thompson and Macklin 2002, pp. 19‚Äì20. While there, Lyon spent much of his spare time sailing around South East Asia. In 1939, he married Gabrielle Bouvier, the daughter of a French official in French Indochina, and fathered a son, Clive.Thompson and Macklin 2002, pp. 25‚Äì27. Military career=Battle of Singapore In mid-1940 Indochina became controlled by Vichy France and was occupied by the Empire of Japan later that year. As the prospect of war between the Allies and Japan loomed, Lyon undertook covert operations with Free French sympathisers in Indochina.Thompson and Macklin 2002, p. 29. After Japan invaded Malaya on 8 December 1941, Lyon's wife and son found themselves behind enemy lines and they spent the war in Japanese internment after the ship they were travelling on was intercepted by a German raider and they were taken prisoner.Thomspon 2005, p. 395. As the Japanese advanced towards Singapore, Lyon worked to form resistance groups among the local population.Thomspon 2005, p. 184. Later, he evacuated civilians from Singapore by boat, until its fall to the Japanese, in February 1942.Thomspon 2005, p. 259. During this period he met an Australian named Bill Reynolds, who operated a small ship called Kofuku Maru.Thompson and Macklin 2002, p. 46. Operation Jaywick Robert Page, Major Ivan Lyon and Lieutenant D.M.N. Davidson enjoying beer in Brisbane after the completion of Operation Jaywick Lyon and Reynolds both later joined Special Operations Australia (a joint Allied intelligence unit for operations in the South West Pacific). Lyon was appointed to lead an SOA commando unit, Z Special Unit or Z Force, as it was usually known. In September 1943, he led Operation Jaywick, using Kofuku Maru (which had been renamed Krait). Z Force sailed from Exmouth Gulf, Australia and raided Japanese ships in Singapore Harbour. They sank or seriously damaged four Japanese ships, amounting to over 39,000 tons of shipping, before returning to Australia after an round trip.Thompson and Macklin 2002, p. 101. Operation Rimau Operation Rimau‚Äîan attempt to repeat the success of Jaywick‚Äîwas launched in October 1944, with Lyon commanding a 23-man Z Special Unit raiding team again on a mission to sink Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour. The party captured a Chinese junk and sailed towards Singapore, but were forced to abandon ship when they destroyed a Kempei Tei patrol boat that had approached them.Thompson and Macklin 2002, pp. 165‚Äì167. Ordering his men to retreat back to Merapas island and await submarine rescue, Lyon and five others attempted a reduced-capacity raid on Singapore Harbour, destroying three ships.Thompson and Macklin 2002, p. 169. After a four-month series of island hops and often ferocious battles with large numbers of Japanese forces, the entire 'Rimau' party were either killed during combat (Lyon was the first of these), drowned or captured.Thompson and Macklin 2002, pp. 170‚Äì215. Those captured were executed by beheading after a sham trial shortly before the Japanese surrender.Thompson and Macklin 2002, pp. 216‚Äì247. Lyon died on the tiny island of Soreh on 16 October 1944, whilst fighting a rearguard action to assist the getaway of two injured members of the 'Rimau' party.Thompson and Macklin 2002, p. 177. Discovered by a Japanese landing crew, Lyon‚Äîtogether with Corporal Clair Stewart and Lieutenant Robert 'Bobby' Ross, and the injured Private Archie Campbell and Lieutenant-Commander Donald Davidson‚Äîengaged the Japanese in battle, killing and injuring seven. The remaining Japanese escaped. Knowing that the Japanese would come back in a matter of hours with reinforcements‚Äîand that there was no possibility of island-hopping to safety with two injured and exhausted comrades‚ÄîLyon made the decision to dose the injured Davidson and Campbell with morphine, and set them on their way towards the nearby island of Tapai, where other members of the Rimau party were known to be holed up. Lyon set about creating rudimentary defenses, taking into account the position of a Malay household. The danger of accidentally involving the occupants of the shack in the forthcoming battle led Lyon to switch the position of his defenses away from this location, a formidable task given that the tiny island was bereft of significant cover, and almost entirely indefensible in the daylight. Lyon and Ross climbed a large Ru tree, having first equipped themselves with a massive amount of magazines and grenades. Corporal Stewart was positioned in a stone-lined ditch, about to their left, together with a cache of grenades and ammunition for the Silent Stens that all three carried. The Japanese returned two hours later, consisting of approximately 110 soldiers. For almost four hours, the Japanese suffered tremendous losses, unaware that their enemy was in fact firing from high above them, as well as being caught repeatedly by the grenades thrown by the unseen Stewart. At midnight, Japanese soldiers finally caught sight of the tiny muzzle flashes from the Silent Stens. Grenades were thrown above the branches; Ross and Lyon fell down from the branches, killed by shrapnel. They had accounted for over sixty dead and wounded Japanese. Stewart remained undiscovered on the island, but marooned as his folboat had been taken by the Japanese. Stewart was eventually caught and taken, after a series of different island jails, to Singapore, and executed there along with the rest of the captured party on 7 July 1945.Thompson and Macklin 2002, p. 178. After the war, Lyon's remains were found and reburied at Kranji War Cemetery on Singapore Island. A memorial tablet was placed on the outside of Saint George's Church, Singapore.Connell 1960, p. 278.

The long title of the Act was An act for taking away the Court of Wards and liveries, and tenures in capite, and by knights-service, and purveyance, and for settling a revenue upon his Majesty in lieu thereof. This Act was partly in force in Great Britain at the end of 2010,The Chronological Table of the Statutes, 1235 - 2010. The Stationery Office. 2011. . Part I. Page 63, read with pages viii and x. though only section 4: Passed by the Convention Parliament in 1660, shortly after the English Restoration, the Act replaced various types of military and religious service that tenants owed to the Crown with socage, and compensated the monarch with an annual fixed payment of ¬£100,000 to be raised by means of a new tax on alcohol. (Frankalmoin, copyhold, and certain aspects of grand serjeanty were excluded.) It completed a process that had begun in 1610 during the reign of James I with the proposal of the Great Contract. The Statute made constitutional gestures to reduce feudalism and removed the monarch's right to demand participation of certain subjects in the Army. By abolishing feudal obligations of those holding those feudal tenures other than by socage, such as by a knight's fee, it standardized most feudal tenancies of the aristocracy and gentry. The Act converted more of their tenures into ones which demanded nil or negligible impositions to the Crown. While socage usually implied rent to be payable to the monarch, no rent was paid in the form of free and common socage as interpreted by the courts. Instead the Act introduced and appointed collection offices and courts to administer a new form of taxation, called excise. Excise duty imposed taxation on the general public to provide an income for the monarch, its ministers and civil servants, to replace these relatively common feudal tenures among the landed classes. Section 3 of the Act repealed the Acts 32 Hen. 8 46, and 33 Hen 8 c 22, thereby abolishing the Court of Wards and Liveries, established in 1540, which had been responsible for revenue collection under the feudal tenure system. It was also the first Act (under its section 14) to impose an excise duty on tea,Book 1, Ch. 14: \\"From the Restoration to the Fire\\", A New History of London: Including Westminster and Southwark (1773), pp. 210-230. Accessed 7 March 2007. as well as on coffee, sherbet and chocolate; the duty was placed on the manufactured beverage, and not the raw tea or coffee, treating it in much the same way as beer or spirits. The Act also let any father, by last will and testament, designate a guardian for his children. The rights of this guardian superseded those of the children's mother.

With the decline of industry throughout the 20th century, Canons' Marsh was cleared to make way for urban renewal. Due to pollution, however, the gas works remained derelict for several years. The area is now the location of At-Bristol, the South West offices of Lloyds Bank, a campus of City of Bristol College and several bars, restaurants, apartment buildings and offices. Kingsdown Cabot Tower, viewed from Brandon Hill park Kingsdown is a mainly residential area of Bristol, located to the north of the city centre and south of Cotham. Redcliffe A small portion of the Redcliffe area lies within the Cabot ward; most of it, however, lies in the Lawrence Hill ward. Spike Island Spike Island is the narrow strip of land between the Floating Harbour to the north and the tidal New Cut of the River Avon to the south, from the dock entrance to the west to Bathurst Basin in the east. From the digging of the \\"New Cut\\" until the Bathurst locks were sealed up, it was literally an island. Tyndall's Park Tyndall's Park is an area to the east of Clifton. It contains the main precinct of the University of Bristol, Bristol Grammar School and the BBC Bristol studios.

Like many other Old Catholic Churches, it is theologically liberal, based upon Roman Catholic and Anglican traditions. The Community Catholic Church of Canada finds its roots in the tradition of the Old Catholic Church, a network of autonomous churches brought together in the Union of Utrecht (1889) after their break from the Roman Church because of innovations introduced by that church. Many also trace their origin from the many ethnic Eastern (Oriental) Catholic Churches which separated from the Church of Rome by the schism of 1054. The Community Catholic Church of Canada traces its Apostolic Succession from the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands as well as the Syrian Orthodox Catholic Church of Antioch. The church arose from groups meeting in Hamilton beginning in 1934 which were affiliated with the Liberal Catholic Church and the North American Old Catholic Church. The Old Catholic Church (now the CCCC) became autonomous in 1948 with the consecration of Bishop George Davis and was incorporated as an independent national church in 1960. The Most Reverend Deborah Vaughan is currently the Presiding Bishop. With clergy across Southern Ontario, the Church is growing and planning new ministries. The Community Catholic Church of Canada recognizes seven sacraments, practices open communion and maintains the threefold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons. The CCCC grew out of the Old Catholic Diocese of Hamilton (founded in 1949 by Fr. William Henry Daw. Daw also founded at other points in his ministry the Independent Anglican Church Canada Synod and the Liberal Catholic Church of Ontario).

At the start of the piece, there is a slow dreamlike introduction consisting of tritone phrases. This soon unwinds into the \\"goat-like\\" theme in a chromatically altered F major in 9/8 that skips along, providing the picture of a dancing goat. Following this theme is a more melodic theme or idea that gives off a more calming feeling. The goat theme and the calm theme both reoccur once again, and at the end of the piece the slow dreamlike idea returns and closes off the piece with a soft and quiet harmonic C for resolution. It is approximately three and a half minutes long. (The piece is approximately ABRSM grade eight standard and can also be found on the ABRSM flute diploma syllabus.)

Lurtsema hosted the classical music show Morning pro musica on radio station WGBH (FM) in Boston, Massachusetts, from 1971 until his death from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He was known among public radio listeners throughout New England for his sonorous voice and his phrasing, which frequently included long pauses. The long pauses, anathema to mainstream radio, were either tolerated or loved by his loyal listeners. \\"I'm not afraid of dead air,\\" he was quoted as saying. \\"I don't think there's anything wrong with a quiet spot once in a while. When I pause I'm visualizing my audience, the person I'm speaking to. I always imagine I'm speaking to someone in particular.\\" Lurtsema also did a great deal of voice-over work, especially for public television documentaries and classical pieces that include narration. In addition to his work in radio, Lurtsema was also a composer. In 1975, he was awarded a lifetime scholarship at the New England Conservatory of Music, where he began to study composition and theory. Among the songs, chamber works, and film scores he wrote are a bassoon quartet that became the theme music for the TV show Julia Child and Company. URL last accessed November 29, 2009. \\"Robert J.\\" or simply \\"Lurtz,\\" as he was known, began his program in 1971, deciding to broadcast seven days a week, five hours a day. He had originally been hired for just the weekends, and then the weekday job opened up. Lurtsema felt that the nation was in turmoil and that he could bring some much-needed consistency to people's lives with his calm voice and reassuring presence, not sensationalizing the news. He accepted the weekday job while continuing the weekend job. This schedule lasted for 23 years, after which he was heard only on the weekends. Lurtsema did many surveys of composers. He might play, for example, all the string quartets of Beethoven or Dvor√°k in order of composition at the same time each weekday, Monday through Friday. He himself had no exposure to classical music in his childhood, and so knew what it was like to grow up without any knowledge of it. He said that he learned along with his listeners. One memorable morning, Lurtsema, his sly sense of humor on display, devoted his full five hours to the playing of \\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\\" in all of the variations that he could find. Lurtsema's signature opening pieces, one for each day of the week, were accompanied by his own recordings of chirping birds. Ottorino Respighi's Ancient Airs and Dances Suite and one of Giovanni Gabrieli's triple brass quintets were among his opening themes. The show closed with Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, and orchestra (K. 297b). In addition to his calm manner, Lurtsema had a subtle sense of humor. He played the birdsong recording unaccompanied for the first part of his program, before fading in his classical opening piece for the day. On at least one occasion, on April 1, 1982, he celebrated April Fools' Day by giving the birds \\"the morning off\\" and substituting for them himself. On that morning, waking listeners were greeted by his measured, utterly deadpan voice offering an earnest spoken rendition of birdsong (i.e., \\"chirp... twitter... chirp... bob-WHITE!... chickadee-dee- dee...\\") for the length of time that the birds would normally have been heard unaccompanied. In 1992, his April Fools' broadcast featured the birds being replaced by howling wolves. Aware of his reputation for long pauses, on another April Fools' Day Lurtsema treated the listeners to a selection of his \\"best pauses.\\" Another example of Lurtsema's subtle sense of humor was the morning after the presidential election of 1980. He began the program as usual with a few minutes of birds, followed by that morning's theme music and his trademark introduction, \\"Good morning on this Wednesday morning. And now a look at the news, edited and reported by Morning Pro Musica's host, Robert J. Lurtsema.\\" Then on that morning he went on to say, \\"There is no news worth reporting this morning,\\" and went on with the program! On the morning of April 5, 1985 at 10:25 EST (Good Friday of that year), it was arranged that over 8000 mostly popular music radio stations would simultaneously broadcast the song \\"We Are the World\\". Surprising many listeners and radio industry personnel, Robert J interrupted his classical music program to play the song as well.Boston Globe - Apr 6, 1985 Author: Paul Hirshson, Page 1 Starting in 1995, Lurtsema and his production team traveled to Seranak Mansion at Tanglewood Music Center for the Boston Symphony Orchestra's opening weekend of the summer season. Morning Pro Musica was broadcast live from the Serenak grounds for the weekend, featuring interviews and live performances with Seiji Ozawa, Roger Norrington, Boje Shovus, Claudio Abbado, Gil Shaham, Emmanuel Ax, John Williams, Arlo Guthrie, Maurice Abravenal and many others.

He also left a mother, two sisters, and a brother. Another job on WGBH He also narrated one episode for the science show Nova named Where Did The Colorado Go, first aired March 10, 1974 (second episode), later aired on the BBC.

C93FM broadcast on 92.9 FM and, after it merged with Radio Avon, also broadcast on 1260 AM. C93FM has had several music formats during its time on the air. In 1989 the station was rebranded as 93FM Gold and in 1990 93FM Classic Hits. Then in 1991 the station reverted to C93FM with a new logo and playing classic rock and continued to play Classic Rock until 1999 when the station was changed to an Adult Contemporary music format. Originally C93FM was an independent station operated by a company of the same name C93FM Limited, the company also operated a second station Easy Listening i94.5 until 1997. The Radio Network made two attempts to purchase C93FM Limited in March and May 1997; however both were rejected by the Commerce Commission on the basis that they would give the company a dominant position in the Christchurch Radio Market. Instead C93FM and Easy Listening i were sold to Radio Otago, Easy Listening i94 became Lite FM in 1998. Following the sale of C93FM Limited to Radio Otago C93FM was started in Dunedin by rebranding local rock station 93Rox as C93FM. The Dunedin-based C93FM was then networked to Invercargill on 90.8FM and was originally branded as C91FM, on air the announcers simply called the station \\"Classic Rock.\\" Later in 1998 C91FM in Invercargill became known as C93FM. In 1999 Radio Otago was sold to the Radioworks and in Invercargill and Dunedin C93FM was replaced with network station The Rock. The Rock was also networked into Christchurch at the same time broadcasting on 93.7FM and as a result the format of C93FM was changed to an Adult Contemporary Format. Also the original 1260AM frequency used by C93 was replaced with Solid Gold as there were no other FM frequencies for Solid Gold to broadcast on at the time. The changes made to C93FM were not popular, and the station failed to attract new listeners as a result. C93FM went off the air in April 2001 and the 92.9FM frequency was taken over by Solid Gold, which later became The Sound in 2012, changing back to a classic rock format. Solid Gold also kept the 1260AM frequency until 2005 when it was used by Radio Pacific. Sources * Decision No. 294 Commerce Commission, Wellington New Zealand, 1997.

Carras was the first shipowner in the world who ordered and took delivery of a Japanese ship built for export after the war. Delivery of the tanker Tini in 1952 ordered from Hitachi, marked the start of a huge influx of Greek business for Japan's nascent shipbuilding industry. In the late 1960s the fleet of the J. C. Carras group of companies attained its zenith, with 34 ships of an overall capacity of approximately 640,000 dwt. Carras initially controlled a mixed fleet of bulkers and tankers, which subsequently became alldry, including 11 Greek flagged capesizes and a number of panamaxes. During that time he was also involved in the real estate and tourist business and bought an extended area in Sithonia, Chalkidiki peninsula in northern Greece and in 1963 he started constructing a tourist resort, known as Porto Carras, which became one of the most famous holiday resorts in Greece.

The blocks being offered may have been held by large investors or institutions, and proceeds of the sale go to those holders, not the issuing company. Also called secondary distribution. A secondary offering is not dilutive to existing shareholders since no new shares are created. The proceeds from the sale of the securities do not benefit the issuing company in any way. The offered shares are privately held by shareholders of the issuing company which may be directors or other insiders (such as venture capitalists) who may be looking to diversify their holdings. Usually however, the increase in available shares allows more institutions to take non-trivial positions in the issuing company which may benefit the trading liquidity of the issuing company's shares. A secondary market offering should not be confused with a follow-on offering, otherwise known as a subsequent offering, or a dilutive secondary offering.

The coastal plain continues well beyond the boundaries of the Swan River and its tributaries, as a geological and biological zone, one of Western Australia's Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) regions.IBRA Version 6.1 data It is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger West Australian Shield division. Location and description The coastal plain is a strip on the Indian Ocean coast directly west of the Darling Scarp uplands running from Cape Naturaliste in the south to north of the city of Perth. The plain mainly consists of fairly infertile sandy soil along with coastal sand dunes, river estuaries, and a number of wetlands kept back from the sea by the dunes. A number of rivers cross the plain from east to west from the Darling Scarp towards the sea, including the Swan and its main tributary, the Canning. The sediments of the Perth Basin are Tertiary and Quaternary in age immediately below Perth and include coquina, travertine, and sandy limestones with abundant shelly material. Perth is sited on a set of sand dunes formed during the Pliocene-Pleistocene during the last ice age. Offshore, the sand dune system and surficial deposits transition into a system of partly eroded limestones and sandy limestones. These form a series of drowned cuestas which today form submerged reefs. Because of the steepness and orientation of the Darling Scarp, watercourses run off the scarp in a westerly direction. On reaching the Swan Coastal Plain, they encounter two obstacles: firstly, the high permeability of the soil results in the loss of much water. Much flow is lost, and some watercourses simply cease to flow, for example, Wungong Brook, Cardup Brook, and Manjedal Brook. Secondly, the sequence of north-to-south-oriented dunes create obstacles to further westerly flow. Many watercourses turn at right angles and flow south or north along the dune swales, and in some cases this allows multiple watercourses to coalesce. For example, on reaching the coastal plain, Ellen Brook runs south for around , picking up a number of watercourses along the way, before finally emptying into the Swan River. Another example is the Serpentine River, which runs west to less than from the coast, then turns south, running parallel with the coast for nearly before disgorging into Peel Inlet. Coastal dunes and Wanneroo wetlands The dune topology also results in extensive north-to-south-oriented chains of wetlands, again located in the swales. For example, the chain of lakes north of Perth includes lakes of the Wanneroo wetlands including ‚Äì Lake Pinjar, Jandabup Lake and Gnangara Lake. The large bodies of water in the estuary of the Swan River, Perth Water and Melville Water are also located in dune swales. Geology The Swan coastal plain is characterised by a series of sand dune systems, the Quindalup dunes, the Spearwood dunes, and the Bassendean dunes, which run from west to east (in increasing age) from the coastline to the major faults which form the eastern boundary of the plain. The plain is bounded to the east by the Darling Scarp, to the north by a subsidiary fault running north-west from Bullsbrook, and to the south by the Collie-Naturaliste Scarp. The Pinjarra plain lies between the Bassendean dunes and the eastern scarps. Early work on all three dune systems considered them to have been formed at differing times by the deposition of sands carried by wind (aeolian and/or by river processes (fluviatile).R.B. Salama, D.W. Pollock, J.D. Byrne and G.W. Bartle. 2000. Geomorphology, Soils and Landuse in the Swan Coastal Plain in relation to Contaminant Leaching, Agrochemical Pollution of Water Resources, Proceedings of a Conference held on 16‚Äì18 February 2000 at Hat Yai, Thailand, Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, Canberra 2001, pp. 105-117. More recently, later authors have argued that these sandplains are mostly the product of in situ weathering. The carbonate material of all three dune systems has been completely leached, leaving dunes which consist solely of quartz sand. Within the Spearwood dunes, the yellow or grey sand may be several metres thick. The dune systems have been much studied, as the water retained within them supplies much of Perth's water needs. (See Gnangara Mound). Climate This coast has a mild Mediterranean climate. Ecology The Swan Coastal Plain is a specific botanical province.Thackway, R. and I D Cresswell An interim biogeographic regionalisation for Australia : a framework for setting priorities in the National Reserves System Cooperative Program Canberra : Australian Nature Conservation Agency, Reserve Systems Unit, 1995. Paczkowska, Graznya and Chapman. Alex R. The Western Australian flora: a descriptive catalogue Wildflower Society of Western Australia, Western Australian Herbarium, CALM, and the Botanic Gardens & Parks Authority, Perth. 2000. Flora Southwestern Australia is very rich in flora, with an estimated 8,000 species, a quarter of which can be found on this coastal strip. The traditional flora of the dunes and the fairly infertile plain was dense shrubby kwongan heathland adapted to the poor soils, dry summers, and regular fires. Kwongan vegetation contains a large number of endemic plant species, especially shrubs and wildflowers, including yellow flame and toothbrush grevilleas, fan-flowers, and cockies' tongues. The heath is scattered with woodland of Banksia and other trees including the red-blossomed quandong (desert peach) and firewood banksia. Going further inland, especially in river valleys where the soil is better, eucalyptus woodlands including tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) occur. The wetlands meanwhile have been particularly important ecologically, supporting a rich habitat of many plant varieties. The Swan Coastal Plain is a particularly important centre for certain types of plants, including Banksia, but also Caladenia orchids and Leucopogon shrubs, indeed some genera, such as the Dryandra series of Banksia and the Synaphea flowers are found nowhere else in the world. Other flora of the plain includes a type of mistletoe called the Christmas tree. Fauna The coastal plains are home to a number of marsupials from the large western grey kangaroo to the very small southwestern pygmy possum and mouse-like honey possum. Remnant populations of some marsupials are found on offshore islands including the Tammar wallaby and the quokka, the latter particularly on Rottnest Island. The coastal plains skink, discovered in 2012, is endemic to sand dunes in the area, and is threatened by residential development. Threats and preservation Much of the plain has been cleared for agriculture and urban development, especially in and around Perth, where the heath has been almost entirely cleared as far as the Darling Scarp and the city is spreading up and down the coast. Although some areas are protected, clearance is going on while the plant disease Phytophthora dieback and changes to traditional fire regimens affect the heathland vegetation including the Banksia trees. Protected areas include Kings Park, Beeliar Wetlands, Star Swamp, Hepburn Heights Bushland, Canning River Regional Park, Bold Park, Whiteman Park, Kensington Bushland and Thomsons Lake. History Traditionally, this area was under the care and control of the Yued, Whadjuk, Binjareb, and Wardandi Noongar peoples, whose hunter-gathering firestick farming practices maintained the climax vegetations old growth forests observed at the time of first contact. At this time, the kwongan heathland was much more widespread along the coast. In the 1830s, it was originally named Great Plain of Quartania or Plain of Quartania by James Stirling, the first governor of Western Australia, but those terms have fallen into disuse. European settlement led to many of the wetlands areas being drained for land reclamation to take advantage of the fertile soil for farming enterprises, and for expansion of parks and recreation areas. The city of Perth sits on an area of reclaimed wetlands. Between 49% (Riggert, 1966) and 80% (Godfrey, 1989) of the wetlands on the coastal plain is thought to have been drained, filled, or cleared since 1832. Lake Monger and Herdsman Lake are the last two major wetlands remaining in close proximity to the city. Lake Monger was originally part of a series of freshwater wetlands running north from the Swan River along the coastal plain for about . Lake Monger with Georgiana Lake and Lake Sutherland (both near Mitchell Freeway, near Sutherland and Newcastle streets) and Herdsman Lake made up what was known as \\"The Great Lakes District\\". Other lakes and swamps in the immediate northern vicinity of the early Perth township were Lake Kingsford (site of the current Perth railway station), Lake Irwin (Perth Entertainment Centre) and further north were Stone's Lake (Perth Oval), Lake Poullet (First Swamp, part of what is now Birdwood Square), Lake Thomson (Mews Swamp, between Lake, Brisbane, and Beaufort Streets) and Lake Henderson (parts of what is now Robertson Park and Dorrien Gardens). Further north still lay Second Swamp (Bulwer Street, east of Lake Street), Third Swamp (Hyde Park), and Three Island Lake and Smith's Lake (now Charles Veryard Reserve). Many of these lakes formed a natural interconnected drainage system which found its way into the Swan River at East Perth through Claise Brook. In 1833, water draining from Lakes Kingsford, Irwin, Sutherland, and Henderson was used to drive a water-driven mill located in Mill Street.

In 1905 he co-invented the first metallic alloy from which a high-resistance wire could be made that could be used as a durable and safe heating element. While working at Hoskins Manufacturing, the company of chemist, electrical engineer, inventor and entrepreneur William Hoskins (1862-1934) the two experimented for several years until the alloy was perfected. The material was patented that year as chromel, later and still today marketed as nichrome. ; republished in hotwire: The Newsletter of the Toaster Museum Foundation, vol. 3, no. 3, online edition. The piece is largely an interview of Hoskins. (And there actually is a Toaster Museum, backed by a related foundation. They take the history of toast, and electrical heating in general, quite seriously.) For this invention, Marsh was acclaimed as \\"father of the electrical heating industry\\". from Pana News-Palladium, retrieved 1997-06-05 Early life Marsh was born August 16, 1877, in Pontiac, Illinois, the oldest of three children. The family moved to Pana, Illinois, in 1884. Marsh went to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 1901, Albert received his bachelor of science degree in Chemical Engineering. The same year, he married Minnie E Hayward in Massachusetts. Career beginnings While working with an electric storage battery and doing technical writing, he experimented with nickel and chromium alloys in his spare time. In 1904, needing a better location to work on his wiring project and additional funding, he made a business arrangement with William Hoskins of Chicago. Hoskins was with Mariner & Hoskins, a firm of consulting chemists. He hired Marsh at a small salary - while giving him permission to work on the alloy project in his spare time. When later formed as Hoskins Manufacturing Company, the business relocated to Detroit, Michigan. Success When perfected, the new alloy was 300 times stronger than other types at that time. Chromel is made of 80% nickel and 20% chromium (though other ratios are used for special purpose nichrome applications). The US patent was granted February 1906, in Marsh's name, and later sold to Hoskins Manufacturing. By Hoskins's own account, he was deeply involved in the experimentation process, and not simply a funder. Toasters, dental furnaces and chromel wire for home appliance manufacturers were the first focus of the Hoskins company. The first two were unprofitable and were later dropped. The company concentrated on manufacturing the chromel wire. Marsh served as chief engineer and general manager of Hoskins Manufacturing Co. in Detroit. He was named president of the firm in 1915. Awards In 1936, Marsh was awarded the John Price Wetherill Medal of The Franklin Institute for \\"significant and timely contribution to the science of automotive engineering\\" and \\"for outstanding discoveries in the physical sciences\\". In 1941, the American Metals Congress bestowed upon Marsh with The Sauveur Award for outstanding metallurgical achievement.

Tagline Doc McCoy pulls off what he thinks is the perfect bank robbery, but there are things he has forgotten, including a treacherous partner, his amateur criminal wife, and that there is no such thing as a clean getaway. Plot Carter \\"Doc\\" McCoy, an expert criminal who was recently released from prison on a pardon, plans to commit a bank robbery with three accomplices. One is his wife Carol, a former librarian who was charmed by Doc's ruthlessness and immorality and thus became his partner-in-crime; she is waiting with their getaway car. The other two are the thuggish Rudy Torrento and the naive Jackson, both of whom are discussing the group's planned escape route: they intend to travel first to California, where they are to stay at a tourist camp Rudy knows while the heat dies down, and then intend to sneak across the Mexican border to go to a mysterious sanctuary for criminals run by a man called El Rey (\\"The King\\"). The bank's guard opens the door to prepare for the day, at which point Doc shoots and kills him from across the street. Rudy and Jackson hide the guard's body, then lie in wait as the other three members of the bank staff arrive for work, tying up each in turn. They steal about $250,000 ($ million today), at which point Rudy kills Jackson in order to increase his share of the proceeds. Doc starts a fire so they can escape while everyone is distracted. Rudy, guessing that Doc will try to kill him, pulls a gun, but Doc shoots first, seemingly killing Rudy, then meets up with Carol. Doc and Carol drive to the rural home of Beynon, the politician who sold Doc his pardon. Doc still owes Beynon some money, and wants to pay him off before fleeing the country. Meanwhile, Rudy regains consciousness and realizes that he may still survive if he can get medical treatment. He remembers a former cellmate and friend, Dr. Vonderschied, and imagines him advising that a veterinarian can treat him. A patrol of two police officers stumble across his position, but Rudy kills both and flees. Doc and Carol find Beynon drunk and despondent; the news has reported the deaths of the bank guard and two policemen and he feels morally responsible. He then tries to convince Doc that Carol, who was the one who actually met with him and negotiated Doc's pardon, had agreed to betray and ultimately kill Doc so that she and Beynon could take the money and run. Carol storms in and shoots Beynon dead, then insists that Beynon was lying. Doc is troubled but accepts this. The couple decide to drive to Kansas City, take a train to California, and then cross the border. Carol wonders if they can hole up in California with the help of the Santis criminal family, whose ancient matriarch Ma Santis is always willing to hide her friends and associates from the police. Doc dismisses the idea, doubting that Ma Santis is still alive. They drive Beynon's car to the Kansas City train station. Carol enters first while Doc disposes of the car, but a con artist manages to steal Carol's suitcase containing all the money. The con artist sneaks onto a train, pockets a sheaf of bills from the suitcase, and hides in an otherwise empty car. However, Carol and Doc find and kill the con artist shortly after the train leaves the station. After disembarking, Doc and Carol steal a vehicle by killing the driver. The con artist's body is discovered, and when authorities realize that the sheaf of bills in his pocket came from the bank, they conclude that Doc and Carol were the killers. A police bulletin is broadcast, forcing Doc and Carol to change plans once again. Rudy compels a rural veterinarian named Harold Clinton to treat and bandage his wound. Upon learning that his bandages will need to be changed a few times every day, Rudy forces Harold and his wife Fran to travel with him to California. From the news updates, Rudy deduces that Doc and Carol will need to move quietly and slowly. This allows Rudy to take the trip slowly and he begins to sleep with Fran, who is charmed by Rudy's brutish nature. Though Harold sleeps in the same bed, he cannot bring himself to do anything about his wife's infidelity. He soon kills himself in despair, at which point Rudy begins beating Fran, but she continues to slavishly love and obey him. Doc and Carol pay a migrant family to travel in the bed of their truck. After several days they arrive in California and make their way to the tourist court, where they are ambushed by Rudy and Fran. Doc manages to shoot and kill both commandeer a taxi. The cabbie radios his dispatch before Doc and Carol throw him out, so the police are able to set up a roadblock. Doc spots Ma Santis on the side of the road, and she waves them in to her hidden refuge. Santis needs time to arrange Doc and Carol's passage across the border and to El Rey's kingdom, so she hides them in partially-submerged caves for two days. Santis then has her son Earl take the couple to his farm while he negotiates their passage with the captain of a fishing boat. Doc and Carol are forced to wait inside a hollowed-out pile of manure for another three days. The two are finally smuggled into the fishing boat. As they are leaving American waters, a small Coast Guard cutter stops it, but Doc and Carol kill all three officers. Doc and Carol finally reach the kingdom of El Rey, which is indeed a sanctuary where criminals can live openly without fear of being extradited. However, all the goods for sale are luxury or first-class, so the cost of living is quite high. Furthermore, El Rey dictates that all residents must spend a certain amount of money per month. This means that, no matter how wealthy a criminal is upon arriving, he quickly gives all his money to El Rey. Fearing banishment to an outlying village with no food or drink, rife with cannibalism and suicide, the criminals kill each other in an attempt to accumulate money to pay El Rey. During the annual ball, the one night every year in which El Rey hosts a big party in his palace and disallows any \\"accidents\\", Doc despairs that he will have to kill Carol in order to make their money last longer and avoid the cannibal village. He wanders through El Rey's palace and comes across Dr. Vonderschied, Rudy‚Äôs friend. Doc tries to convince Vonderschied to talk Carol into some kind of surgery, then kill her during the process. Vonderschied reveals that Carol tried to pay him to enact the same plan against Doc. He denounces both for squandering their many talents and luck in pursuit of a monstrously bloody life of crime. Vonderschied directs Doc to Carol, hiding in the room. The couple acknowledge that they love each other, but neither denies that it will end with murder so one can avoid the cannibal village for a little while longer. As the clock strikes midnight, they sardonically toast their \\"successful getaway\\". Symbolism Much has been made of the symbolism of the last third of the book, in which the text transitions from a gritty crime thriller into a surreal and heavily allegorical drama. The caves that Ma Santis compels McCoy and Carol to hide in have been analogized to tombs or graves, the manure pile to rot and decomposition, and the boat ride to crossing the River Styx. Additionally, El Rey itself is compared to Hell, for it is described as a place where people \\"seem to live an eternity\\" and suffer immensely all the while. Film adaptations The novel has been adapted into films twice. The 1972 film version of The Getaway starred Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw. The 1994 film version of The Getaway starred Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger. In both films the surreal ending in the hellish domain of El Rey is discarded for a happy ending in which Doc and his wife ultimately escape to freedom.

History In 1978, Tony Wilson and Alan Erasmus cofounded The Durutti Column, with guitarists Vini Reilly and Dave Rowbotham, bassist Tony Bowers (formerly of Alberto Y Lost Trios Paranoias), drummer Chris Joyce, and vocalist Phil Rainford. After releasing two songs in a various artists compilation, A Factory Sample, that year, the Durutti Column became the sole concern of Reilly and Bowers, as Rowbotham and Joyce departed and formed The Mothmen, alongside former Alberto Y Lost Trios Paranoias singer Bob Harding. So, the first lineup comprised Joyce on drums; Bowers on guitar, bass, vocals, violin, and percussion; Rowbotham on guitar and bass; and Bob Harding on bass, organ, guitar, vocals, and percussion. In 1979, they released their debut single on Absurd Records, \\"Does It Matter Irene?\\" The recording of an album's worth of material in the first half of 1980 left the group without a label to release it on. Thus in stepped the assistance of a young and cash-strapped Adrian Sherwood, having just launched On-U Sound. A deal was done and in 1981 Pay Attention! appeared as its second album. The arrangement and production work remained the Mothmen's own with Sherwood playing no part in its creation. Sherwood's only direct involvement with the band was when he provided a dub mix of \\"Afghan Farmer Driving Cattle\\" [Rhythm 137] on On-U's first compilation release ‚Äì Wild Paarty Sounds Volume 1. During this period Joyce also found time to be the drummer for another one of On-U Sound's first generation 'crew', London Underground, as well appearing on Judy Nylon's \\"Pal Judy\\" set for the label. However, the Mothmen soon left for Do-It Records and in the process Rowbotham was replaced by Ronnie Hardman (bass) and Charlie Griffiths (synthesisers). The new line-up produced a handful more singles and a further album, One Black Dot, before they split for good in early 1982. Of The Mothmen's former members, Joyce and Bowers were to have the greatest subsequent commercial success, forming part of the first Simply Red rhythm section between 1984 and 1989. The On-U association with Joyce and Bowers had two final outcomes in the UK, in the form of Sherwood's providing flip-side mixes to Simply Red's \\"Holding Back The Years\\" and \\"Infidelity\\" 12\\" singles. Through the Sly & Robbie connection, Sherwood also contributed to Simply Red's 1997 \\"Night Nurse\\" cover of Gregory Isaacs' song. In 1991, founding guitarist Dave Rowbotham was murdered. Tony Bowers lives between Italy and Ireland where he works on various musical projects . Chris Joyce shares further details of his life and career, up to and beyond his work with Simply Red, on his biography in Chris Joyce School of Drums.

Retrieved 24 March 2014. Officially, the edifice is titled the Pontifical Sanctuary of the Holy Stairs ('Pontificio Santuario della Scala Santa), and incorporates part of the old Papal Lateran Palace. Replica stairs flank the original staircase, which may only be climbed on one's knees. The Holy Stairs lead to the Church of Saint Lawrence in Palatio ad Sancta Sanctorum (Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Palatio ad Sancta Sanctorum) or simply the \\"Sancta Sanctorum\\" (), which was the personal chapel of the early Popes. According to Roman Catholic tradition, the Holy Stairs were the steps leading up to the praetorium of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem on which Jesus Christ stepped on his way to trial during his Passion. The Stairs reputedly were brought to Rome by Saint Helena in the fourth century. For centuries, the Scala Sancta has attracted Christian pilgrims who wish to honour the Passion of Jesus Christ. Since the early 1700s, the Holy Stairs have been encased in wood for protection, but were briefly exposed in 2019 following restoration work.  History  According to Roman Catholic tradition, the Holy Stairs were the steps leading up to the praetorium of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem on which Jesus Christ stepped on his way to trial during his Passion. Medieval legends claim that Saint Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine the Great, brought the Holy Stairs from Jerusalem to Rome circa AD 326. In the Middle Ages, they were known as \\"Scala Pilati\\" (\\"Stairs of Pilate\\"). From old plans it appears that they led to a corridor of the Lateran Palace, near the Chapel of Saint Sylvester, and were covered with a special roof. In 1589, Pope Sixtus V had the Papal Lateran Palace, then in ruins, demolished to make way for the construction of a new one. He ordered the Holy Stairs be reconstructed in their present location, before the Sancta Sanctorum (Holy of Holies), named for the many precious relics preserved there. The chapel also houses an icon of Christ Pantocrator, known as the \\"Uronica\\", that was supposedly begun by Saint Luke and finished by an angel. This celebrated icon of Santissimi Salvatore Acheiropoieton (\\"not made by human hands\\"), on certain occasions, used to be carried through Rome in procession.Ewart Witcombe, p. 372. The Scala Sancta may only be ascended on the knees. For common use, the staircase is flanked by four additional staircases, two on each side, constructed circa 1589. In 1724, Pope Benedict XIII covered the marble stairs in wood for their protection, since the marble had been significantly worn away by the many pilgrims ascending the stairs over time. The stairs remained covered until 2019, when the protective wood covering was removed and the marble exposed following restoration work. When the stairs were reopened on 11 April 2019, pilgrims were permitted to ascend the exposed marble stairs on their knees for the first time in almost 300 years. The stairs remained exposed and open to the public between April 2019 and July 2019, and then were again covered in wood.  Decoration  A fresco at Scala Santa The decoration of the Scala Sancta was one of the major renovations of the pontificate of Pope Sixtus V, led by Cesare Nebbia and Giovanni Guerra and occupying a crew of artists to decorate frescoes including Giovanni Baglione, Giacomo Stella, Giovanni Battista Pozzo, Paris Nogari, Prospero Orsi, Ferra√π Fenzoni, Paul Bril, Paulo Guidotti, Giovanni Battista Ricci, Cesare Torelli, Antonio Vivarini, Andrea Lilio, Cesare and Vincenzo Conti, Baldassare Croce, Ventura Salimbeni, and Antonio Scalvati. Numerous preliminary drawings by Nebbia for these frescoes are extant, though it is not known with certainty who painted each fresco. A major restoration was completed in 2007 and funded largely by the Getty Foundation. In early 2018, a restoration of the frescoes began, causing the Scala Sancta to be closed for over a year.  Scala Sancta in the Catholic Church  Climbing the Holy Stairs on one's knees is a devotion much in favour with pilgrims and the faithful. Several popes have performed the devotion, and the Roman Catholic Church has granted indulgences for it. Pope Pius VII on 2 September 1817 granted those who ascend the Stairs in the prescribed manner an indulgence of nine years for every step. Pope Pius X, on 26 February 1908, conceded a plenary indulgence as often as the Stairs are devoutly ascended after Confession and Holy Communion. On 11 August 2015, the Apostolic Penitentiary granted a plenary indulgence to all who \\"inspired by love\\" climbed the Stairs on their knees while meditating on Christ's passion, and also went to Confession, received Holy Communion, and recited certain other Catholic prayers, including a prayer for the Pope's intentions. Those who were physically impeded from climbing the stairs could obtain the plenary indulgence by meditating on Christ's passion while at the Stairs and completing the other conditions. As part of the ceremonies opening the Holy Year in 1933, Cardinal Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani, Vicar of Rome, led a crowd of hundreds in mounting the steps on their knees. Between April 2019 and July 2019, pilgrims were permitted to ascend the stairs kneeling on the original uncovered marble steps for the first time in almost 300 years. As a result, visitor numbers during this time increased threefold from the usual, and long lines formed at the entrance.  Skeptical visitors  Scala Sancta Martin Luther climbed the steps on his knees in 1510. As he did so, he repeated the Our Father on each step. It was said, by doing this work one could \\"redeem a soul from purgatory.\\" But when Luther arrived at the top he could not suppress his doubt, \\"Who knows whether this is true?\\"Brecht, Martin; Martin Luther, His Road to Reformation 1483-1521, Fortress Press, 1981; p.103 Charles Dickens, after visiting the Scala Sancta in 1845, wrote: \\"I never, in my life, saw anything at once so ridiculous and so unpleasant as this sight.\\" He described the scene of pilgrims ascending the staircase on their knees as a \\"dangerous reliance on outward observances\\".

Controversy=Bofors scandal Srichand, Gopichand and Prakash Hinduja have been connected with the investigation into the Bofors scandal, in which Swedish firm Bofors was alleged to have paid illegal bribes to Government officials and politicians in connection with the 1.3 billion sale of 400 howitzers to the Indian Government in 1986. The three brothers were charged by the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation in October 2000, but in 2005 the High Court in Delhi threw out all charges against them, citing a lack of evidence and saying that documents central to the prosecution case were \\"useless and dubious\\" since their provenance could not be verified. Judge RS Sodhi said: \\"I must express my disapproval that 14 years of trial and of public money was spent on the case. It has caused huge economical, emotional, professional and personal loss to the Hindujas.\\" 2001 Hinduja affair In January 2001, it was revealed that UK government Minister Peter Mandelson had telephoned Home Office minister Mike O'Brien on behalf of Srichand Hinduja, who was at the time seeking British citizenship, and whose family firm was to become the main sponsor of the \\"Faith Zone\\" in the Millennium Dome. Consequently, on 24 January 2001 Mandelson resigned from the Government for a second time, insisting he had done nothing wrong. An independent enquiry by Sir Anthony Hammond came to the conclusion that neither Mandelson nor anyone else had acted improperly. In January 2001, immigration minister Barbara Roche revealed in a written Commons reply that Keith Vaz, Member of Parliament for Leicester East and at the time a Foreign Office minister, and other MPs, had also contacted the Home Office about the Hinduja brothers, saying that Vaz had made inquiries about when a decision on their application for citizenship could be expected. On 25 January, Vaz became the focus of Opposition questions about the Hinduja affair and many parliamentary questions were tabled, demanding that he fully disclose his role. Vaz said via a Foreign Office spokesman that he would be \\"fully prepared\\" to answer questions put to him by Sir Anthony Hammond QC who had been asked by the Prime Minister to carry out an inquiry into the affair. Vaz said that he had known the Hinduja brothers for some time; he had been present when the charitable Hinduja Foundation was set up in 1993, and had also delivered a speech in 1998 when the brothers invited Tony and Cherie Blair to a Diwali celebration. On 26 January 2001, Prime Minister Tony Blair was accused of prejudicing the independent inquiry into the Hinduja passport affair, after he declared that Keith Vaz had not done \\"anything wrong\\". On the same day, Vaz told reporters that they would \\"regret\\" their behaviour once the facts of the case were revealed. \\"Some of you are going to look very foolish when this report comes out. Some of the stuff you said about Peter, and about others and me, you'll regret very much when the facts come out,\\" he said. When asked why the passport application of one of the Hinduja brothers had been processed more quickly than normal, being processed and sanctioned in six months when the process can take up to two years, he replied, \\"It is not unusual.\\" On 29 January, the government confirmed that the Hinduja Foundation had held a reception for Vaz in September 1999 to celebrate his appointment as the first Asian Minister in recent times. The party was not listed by Vaz in the House of Commons Register of Members' Interests and John Redwood, then head of the Conservative Parliamentary Campaigns Unit, questioned Vaz's judgement in accepting the hospitality. In March, Vaz was ordered to fully co-operate with a new inquiry launched into his financial affairs by Elizabeth Filkin, who was Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards at the time. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, Vaz's superior, also urged him to fully answer allegations about his links with the Hinduja brothers. Mr Vaz met Mrs Filkin on 20 March to discuss a complaint that the Hinduja Foundation had given the sum of ¬£1,200 to Mapesbury Communications, a company run by his wife, in return for helping to organise a Hinduja-sponsored reception at the House of Commons. Vaz had previously denied receiving money from the Hindujas, but insisted that he made no personal gain from the transaction in question. In June 2001, Vaz admitted that he had made representations during the Hinduja brothers' applications for British citizenship while a backbench MP. Tony Blair also admitted that Vaz had \\"made representations\\" on behalf of other Asians. On 11 June 2001 Vaz was dismissed from his post as Europe Minister, to be replaced by Peter Hain. The Prime Minister's office said that Vaz had written to Tony Blair stating he wished to stand down for health reasons. In December 2001, Elizabeth Filkin cleared Vaz of failing to register payments to his wife's law firm by the Hinduja brothers, but said that he had colluded with his wife to conceal the payments. Filkin's report said that the payments had been given to his wife for legal advice on immigration issues and concluded that Vaz had gained no direct personal benefit, and that Commons rules did not require him to disclose payments made to his wife. She did, however, criticise him for his secrecy, saying, \\"It is clear to me there has been deliberate collusion over many months between Mr Vaz and his wife to conceal this fact and to prevent me from obtaining accurate information about his possible financial relationship with the Hinduja family\\". Ashok Leyland In February 2005 Ashok Leyland, an India-based flagship company of the brothers' Hinduja Group, announced an agreement to supply 100 army vehicles to the Sudanese Defence Ministry. It was alleged by arms campaigner Mark Thomas that this contravened UK arms export legislation, as a number of the company's directors were UK residents or citizens.

It is partly on the site of the former Pineland Hospital and Training Center. History In the early part of the 20th century, the State of Maine purchased six farms in New Gloucester, Maine, that became known as Pineland Farms. The purpose of this purchase was to build the Maine School for the Feeble Minded on part of the land and continue farming on the rest of it. The Maine School for the Feeble-Minded and Pownal State School Opening in 1908, the Maine School for the Feeble-Minded was an institution that housed people who were considered \\"mentally deficient\\", \\"idiots\\", \\"morons\\", \\"defective\\", or \\"retarded\\". However, during its early years, the State also placed orphans and other wards of the state at the Maine School, as no other public services existed to help them. In 1913, a local committee expressed concerns that the State had purchased Pineland Farms solely as a commercial venture, and that the location did not meet the needs of the Maine school. The committee suggested that the State move the school to a better location. Supporters of the Maine School, including mental health expert Dr. Walter E. Fernald and local doctor Seth C. Gordon, stated that while the agricultural fields of Pineland Farms did generate revenue, they also had therapeutic value. They would, as Gordon said, \\"keep these poor unfortunates employed and do them good.\\" Note: Though the 1913 Lewiston Evening Journal reference doesn't indicate Fernald's first name, it does say that he ran the Massachusetts School for the Feeble Minded. Cross-checking that against this citation, Maine Biographies, should confirm that Walter E. Fernald was the doctor in question. Maine School supporters also said that with some improvements, such as the installation of an additional artesian well, Pineland Farms could meet all the needs of its patients. In 1912, the state of Maine removed eight residents from Malaga Island off of Phippsburg, Maine, known for its mixed-race community, and placed them at the Maine School for the Feeble-Minded, where most remained for the rest of their lives. The bodies in Malaga's cemetery were removed and reinterred at the School, with several bodies being placed into three unmarked graves. In 1921, a resident described as deaf mute with arsonist tendencies escaped from the Maine School. After burning two barns near North Yarmouth, Maine, the escapee was captured by local residents and returned to the school. In 1925, Maine was the 25th state to pass a sterilization law, which stated that sterilization was permitted \\"for eugenic purposes or for therapeutic treatment on feebleminded and others suffering from certain forms of mental disease\\"; 189 patients were sterilized at the school. That year the state changed the school name to \\"Pownal State School\\". The old title, with its reference to 'feeble minded\\", was considered insensitive to the patients. At its peak residency in the 1930s, the Pownal School cared for an estimated 1,500 patients. Pineland Center In 1953, Peter W. Bowman became the superintendent of the Pownal State School, which in 1957 became the Pineland Hospital and Training Center. This name would be shortened to Pineland Center in the early 1970s. Over the next 18 years, Pineland Center received national recognition for the care of the mentally disabled. In the 1970s, political intrusion and budget cuts ushered in a series of administrators who were poorly equipped to manage Pineland Center and advocate for its residents and underpaid staff. The facility deteriorated and quality care for its residents was largely abandoned. In 1976, due to worsening conditions and allegations of patient abuse, the Federal government placed Pineland Hospital into receivership. As social attitudes towards the mentally disabled evolved, many Pineland Center residents were reintegrated into society. The most able of the hospital population were re-homed into apartments in the 1990s. Many advocates for the homeless noted that Maine's local transient population began to grow during this period as Pineland and other facilities released their residents. Routine care and therapy for these former residents ended and they drifted from their new homes.. By June 1995, approximately 60 patients remained at Pineland Hospital. In 1996, Pineland Center was closed. Recreational property Bride and groom at Pineland Farms In 2000, the Libra Foundation purchased Pineland Farms. At that time, the property included 1600 acres (6.5 km2) and 28 buildings. Most of Pineland Farms was being used for agriculture. The foundation extensively renovated the property, adding businesses, trails and recreational areas. As of 2013, Pineland Farms encompassed approximately 5,000 (20.23 km2) acres and was being used primarily as a public recreation area. Trail system The trail system at Pineland Farms is approximately 15.5 miles (25 km) long. The Libra Foundation renovated much of Pineland Farms into cross-country ski trails, which are used for a variety of other seasonal activities, such as trail running, mountain biking, and cyclo-cross. The Pineland Farm trails are also used for collegiate cross country running races and training. It is the home course for Bates College and has been the host site for the Maine state college championships. Pineland Farms is also used for orienteering events, such as the National Orienteering Championships, which were held at Pineland in 2004. Two significant disc golf courses are operated by Pineland Farms as part of its recreational offerings. Other facilities Bates College operates a Dutch Warmblood horse breeding at the Equestrian Center at Pineland Farms. Until 2008, an Equine-assisted therapy program was hosted at the center. The Libra Foundation rents out meeting facilities and guest houses at Pineland Farms. It sells food grown at Pineland Farms to the general public.

He was the second son of Oda Nobunaga. He survived the decline of the Oda clan from political prominence, becoming a daimy≈ç in the early Edo period. Though often described as an incompetent general, Nobukatsu was a skilled warrior. In the battle of Komaki and Nagakute, he used a 13th-century tachi of the Fukuoka Ichimonji school, to slay a samurai known as Okada Sukesabur≈ç, therefore the blade was known as \\"Okada-giri Yoshifusa\\", now a national treasure. Biography In 1570, Nobukatsu became an adopted heir of the Kitabatake clan and married a daughter of the former lord of Kitabatake, Tomonori. The true nature of this marriage was a condition of truce forced by the Oda clan to the Kitabatake clan. In 1575, Nobukatsu officially became the head of the family. The next year, he killed his father-in-law, imprisoned the previous lord, who was his father by adoption, and completely took over the Kitabatake clan. In 1579, eager to achieve fame, Nobukatsu directed an invasion of Iga, Iga Province, which only ended in disastrous failure and severe rebuke from his father. Two years later, Nobunaga himself led another invasion with an army of several ten thousand and destroyed the whole region. Death of Nobunaga When Nobunaga and his heir, Nobutada, died at the Honn≈ç-ji incident in 1582, problems arose about who would succeed the lordship of Oda clan. When Nobukatsu and his younger brother, Nobutaka, quarreled over the matter, a council decided on the infant son of Nobutada, Oda Hidenobu. The opinion of Toyotomi Hideyoshi was most influential on this decision. At this point, Nobukatsu changed his surname back to Oda. He succeeded his father as lord of Mino, Owari, and Ise Provinces. Decline of Nobukatsu During the succeeding chaotic years, Nobukatsu joined with Hideyoshi to destroy Nobutaka. However, soon their relationship became hostile, too, and Nobukatsu allied with Tokugawa Ieyasu to fight Hideyoshi in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute in 1584. After more than a half year of battles, Hideyoshi persuaded Nobukatsu to make peace, offering him the security of the dominion. Nobukatsu took this offer and practically became a retainer of Hideyoshi. Later, when he served at the siege of Odawara (1590), he refused to accept Hideyoshi's order to change his dominion, and not only lost his original domain but was also forced to become a monk under the supervision of some Toyotomi retainers. A few years later, Hideyoshi's anger eased and Nobukatsu regained some land to rule. He became the guardian of Toyotomi Hideyori after Hideyoshi's death. However, he betrayed the Toyotomi clan at the Siege of Osaka, and surrendered to Tokugawa Ieyasu. As a result, he was permitted to remain a daimy≈ç by the Tokugawa shogunate. Though he is often described as an incompetent general, he managed to survive the series of upheavals. After the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, he became the lord of the Uda-Matsuyama Domain in Yamato Province (modern-day Nara Prefecture), and comfortably lived the rest of his life.

Originally formed to contest the December 2005 elections, it described itself as a non-sectarian coalition that wants to end the presence of foreign troops and to rebuild government institutions. The main components were initially: * The Iraqi National Front, led by former Minister of State Saleh al-Mutlaq, who was the chief Sunni Arab negotiator for the constitution * The National Front for a Free and United Iraq of Hassan Zaydan * The Iraqi Christian Democratic Party of Minas al-Yusufi * The Democratic Arab Front of Farhan al-Sudayd * The Sons of Iraq Movement of Ali al-Suhayri The coalition included Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians, Yezidis and Shabaks. The Front is 'distinct' from the Iraqi National Dialogue Council, headed by Khalaf al-Ulayyan, which is a component of the Iraqi Accord Front. Mutlaq campaigned against the constitution in the October 2005 referendum, and refused to join the other main Sunni Arab-led list, Iraqi Accord Front because that group's largest component, the Iraqi Islamic Party, had backed the new constitution, which Mutlaq rejected due to it granting federalism and autonomy to different regions, and also because it did not emphasise Iraq's Arab identity.http://carnegieendowment.org/publications/special/misc/iraqielections2010/index.cfm?fa=inm#ifnd The Front performed relatively well in the December 2005 election, winning 11 seats, but complained of widespread electoral fraud and called for a re-run of the poll. Prior to the 2010 Iraqi Elections it joined the secular Iraqiyya coalition and was allocated 16 out of their 91 seats in the Council of Representatives of Iraq, becoming the biggest individual party with a Sunni Arab majority.

It was written by Cynthia Rylant, who has written over 100 children's books such as The Islander. Plot The novel is set in present-day West Virginia. The protagonist is Summer, an orphaned child who has been passed from one apathetic relative to another. At age six, she meets her Aunt May and Uncle Ob. The kindly old couple notices that, although Summer is not mistreated, she is virtually ignored by her caretakers and decide to take Summer home to their rickety trailer home in the hills of the Appalachian mountains. Summer thrives under their care, feeling that she finally has a home. Six years after Summer moves in, Aunt May dies suddenly in the garden. Summer must cope with her own grief while worrying about Uncle Ob, who is overwhelmed by the thought of living without his beloved wife. Uncle Ob decides to try contacting May's spirit, after he experiences the sensation that she has tried to communicate with him. He is assisted in this endeavor by Cletus Underwood, a classmate of Summer's, who provides information on a supposed spirit medium of some renown. Summer views his ideas with some skepticism, but is willing to try anything that might alleviate her uncle's sorrow. The three take a roadtrip to meet with the medium, only to discover that she had recently died. Uncle Ob is initially crushed by this news, and Summer fears that this disappointment was the last blow to his will to live. However, on the return trip, Uncle Ob suddenly snaps out of his depression, deciding to continue living on for Summer's sake. Characters *Summer- A young girl who serves as the main character and narrator of the story. She was orphaned as a baby, and was passed from relative to relative, until being taken in permanently by her Aunt May and Uncle Ob, who provided her with a happy, love-filled home. Summer is distraught when May dies, but is even more worried about Uncle Ob. *Uncle Ob- Summer's uncle and May's husband. He sinks into an extreme depression once May dies, and Summer fears that he has given up on living. He eventually becomes convinced that May's spirit is still visiting them, and seeks out a way to contact her. He is an accomplished craftsman, who has carved dozens of whirligigs over the years. *Cletus- A classmate of Summer's, he is viewed as the strangest student at her school. He meets Uncle Ob by chance shortly after May's death, and the two quickly become friends. Although Summer is not fond of him, she tolerates his presence since Ob enjoys his company. She begins to look more kindly upon him as time goes on. He claims to have had a near-death experience as a child, which gives Ob hope of being able to contact May's spirit.

History  Johnsonville was platted July 8, 1874 by John R. Johnson, Senior, near Sumner Station. A post office was established there on December 2, 1875, with George W. Johnson as postmaster. As of September 1875 there were said to be about 50 people living in the town; there were several businesses including a dry goods store and a tan yard that produced leather. The town also had a druggist, a doctor, a lawyer, a blacksmith, a grain dealer, a railway agent, a tinker, and a boarding-house. As of 1913, the population was about 80. The town was established at the intersection of two rail lines: the existing Toledo, Wabash and Western Railroad and the new Coal Branch of the Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad (the branch being known as the \\"Pumpkin Vine\\" Railroad), which was laid down in 1872. The well-chosen location favored the town's success, but trains had stopped running on the Pumpkin Vine by 1880, just six years after the town was formally established; and when the rails were removed shortly thereafter, the site's importance was diminished, and the town began to dwindle. The post office closed on August 31, 1907. As of 2007, Johnsonville consists of a non-denominational Christian church and a few residences.  Geography  Johnsonville is located in the southwestern portion of the township, at the T-intersection of County Road 875 West (a paved road) and 600 South (a gravel road). It is about east of the Illinois border. Flat, open farmland lies to the north and west, while wooded valleys and hollows lie to the southeast.

Honegger was widely known as a train enthusiast, and once notably said: \\"I have always loved locomotives passionately.

Description The popular interpretation Honegger‚Äôs ‚ÄúPacific 231‚Äù ‚Äì review of the premiereMusical Geography of the piece is that it depicts a steam locomotive, one that is supported by the title of the piece alongside film versions. Honegger, however, insisted that he wrote it as an exercise in building momentum while the tempo of the piece slows. He originally titled it Mouvement Symphonique, only giving it the name Pacific 231, a class of steam locomotive designated in Whyte notation as a 4-6-2, with four pilot wheels, six driving wheels, and two trailing wheels (the French, who count axles rather than wheels, call this arrangement 2-3-1) after it was finished.notes by Paul Serotsky Orchestration The orchestra consists of: 2 flutes, piccolo flute, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon ‚Äì 4 French horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, ‚Äì 4 percussionists (tenor drum, cymbal, bass drum, tam tam) ‚Äì strings. Pacific 231 is the first in Honegger's series of three symphonic movements. The other two are Rugby and Mouvement Symphonique No. 3. Honegger lamented that his \\"poor Symphonic Movement No. 3 paid dearly for its barren title.\\" Critics generally ignored it, while Pacific 231 and Rugby, with more evocative titles, have been written about in depth. In film Pacific 231 - soviet film by Mikhail Tsekhanovsky, 1931 A 1949 award-winning French film, Pacific 231, directed by Jean Mitry, used the orchestral work as the sound track for a tribute to the steam locomotive, and included close-up footage of driving wheels, running gear and railroad operations, mostly taken at speed, and cut/choreographed to the music.Pacific 231 (1949) Part 2 of 2-MyFootage.com on YouTubePacific 231 (1949) Part 1 of 2-MyFootage.com on YouTube References # Honegger, Arthur (1951), trans.

Club career=France Born in Nice, Letizi took his first steps as a professional player with OGC Nice where his team won the French second division in 1994. Upon reaching the French first division he was observed by a number of football clubs before joining FC Metz in 1996. At this new club, he and his team became runner-ups in the French first division in 1998 and finalists of the French League Cup in 1999. The chance to take a step up arrived when he joined Paris Saint-Germain in 2000, which enabled him to play in the Champions‚Äô League. He remained first choice at PSG for 6 years, but the signing of Mickael Landreau instigated his leave. Move to Scotland On 16 June 2006 he moved to Rangers FC on a free transfer. On 13 August 2006, his blunder led directly to a 1‚Äì1 draw with Dunfermline. Letizi soon redeemed himself in the next game, which saw Rangers achieve a 2‚Äì0 win against the Hearts. Unfortunately for the team, this match resulted in an injury for Letizi. After two months on the sidelines, Letizi controversially made an automatic return to the side despite impressive performances from his replacement Allan McGregor. Manager Paul Le Guen had made it clear at the start of the season that Letizi was going to be number one, which was not entirely unexpected. But the decision was soon put under dubious light when a fumble on the 14 October 2006 gave Inverness Caledonian Thistle an unforeseen 1‚Äì0 win at Ibrox Stadium, and left Rangers 10 points behind Celtic FC after just ten Scottish Premier League matches. After the departure of Le Guen, Letizi's future at Rangers was uncertain, and not long after, he was released from the club on the 30 January 2007. Letizi has not played since October 2006 and featured in just eight matches in his six-month stay at Rangers, winning only one match. International career While capped four times for the French national team, he never managed to displace Fabien Barthez. He was in France's preliminary squad of 28 players for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in his native country. However, he was one of 6 players removed from the tournament by head coach Aime Jacquet just before the tournament began. France went on to be victorious in the tournament and become national heroes.

The regiment was led by Colonel Gilman Marston, a future United States congressman who represented the state in the 51st Congress (1889-1891). The 2nd New Hampshire wore Union gray uniforms with \\"spiketail\\" dress coats trimmed in red cord, and \\"jaunty forage caps\\" with \\"2NH\\" on the crown.

In 1881 he invested the money he earned from teaching into cattle, then leveraged the profits to establish himself as a farmer and an entrepreneur.

The Estate is the former seat of the Dukes of Leeds and the Earls of Godolphin. It contains a Grade 1 listed Tudor/Stuart mansion, complete with early formal gardens (dating from circa 1500) and Elizabethan stables (circa 1600). The present house is remnant of a larger mansion. From 1786 it was owned by the Dukes of Leeds who never lived there. In 1920 the 10th Duke of Leeds sold it to the sitting tenant Peter Quintrell Treloar. After Treloar died in 1922, the following year his wife sold it to James Penna an agricultural engineer. James Penna died in 1926 and his son James Henry Penna inherited the house and estate and lived there until his death in 1935. In 1935 it was sold to C.B. Stevens, a local man, but he then sold the house and estate to artist Walter Elmer Schofield and family in 1937.David Tovey, Creating A Splash - The St. Ives Society of Artists - The First 25 Years (1927-1952) (Hilmarton Manor Press, 2003). Schofield's architect son Sydney restored the mansion, and received it as a wedding present from his parents. In 2000, Mary Schofield, widow of Sydney sold the wider estate to the National Trust, and in 2007 she then sold the house, gardens and farm-yard to the National Trust. The National Trust then carried out a major conservation project of the architecture of the North Range (the historic front) to prevent it from further decay and collapse. The house is open to the public on certain days. The Estate measures and includes Godolphin Hill which provides views over west Cornwall. More than four hundred recorded archaeological features range from Bronze Age enclosures to 19th-century mine buildings. The Trust has been improving public access to the Estate. The large village of Godolphin Cross (sometimes Crossroads), in the parish of Breage, adjoins the estate to the east. Amenities include a primary school. House and gardens Godolphin House is located at . The house and gardens were acquired by the National Trust in August 2007. Various events are held throughout the year. The house is approached from the north and consists of three wings around a square courtyard and the front wall of a further building on the south side. The main buildings originally stood to the south of this with two projecting wings. One room of the 16th-century remains in the east range; this has linenfold panelling. Opposite the hall range is the Jacobean range; the north side is castellated and has a loggia of seven bays on the ground floor. Stylistic features here appear to be of the mid 17th-century and suggest that the accepted date for the house of after 1712 is very unlikely. The house is available as a holiday let for approximately three weeks each month when it is not open to the public. Legend and customs Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin A custom first recorded in the 18th- century, but may relate to the 14th-century, was enacted yearly on Candlemas day (2 February) until 1921. Godolphin and St Aubyn wagered their respective seats on a race between two snails; Godolphin, losing, pricked his snail which curled up and lost the race. St Aubyn instead of claiming Godolphin's estate imposed an annual custom. The reeve of Lambourne knocked on the door of the great hall of Godolphin Court and demanded to be let in. He would jump on the table and demand 'rents duties and customs'. These were paid in a large quart of strong beer, a loaf of wheaten bread and cheese of similar value and 2s 8d.
