He is the second-most influential and most popular leader in the country after President Julius Nyerere. Kambona was born on 13 August 1928 on the shores of Lake Nyasa in a small village called Kwambe near Mbamba Bay in the district of Nyasa near Songea in Ruvuma region southern Tanganyika. He died in London in November 1997. He was the son of the Reverend David Kambona and Miriam Kambona. Reverend David Kambona belonged to the first group of African priests to be ordained into the Anglican Church of Tanganyika. Kambona received his primary school education at home under a mango tree in his home village. The tree still stands today. He was taught by his parents and by an uncle, all of whom were teachers. He was then sent to St Barnabas Middle School in Liuli in southern Tanganyika not far from his home. He also attended Alliance Secondary School in Dodoma in central Tanganyika. A British Anglican bishop paid Oscar Kambona's school fees because his father could not afford to do so. The school fees were 30 Pounds per year. Kambona is reported to have said he convinced the Anglican bishop to pay his school fees by reciting the Lord's Prayer in English. He was then selected to attend Tabora Boys‚Äô Senior Government School where he first met Julius Nyerere who was already teaching at St. Mary's, a Catholic school in the town of Tabora. Political career President Nyerere and President Kennedy in 1963 Kambona became the secretary-general of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) during the struggle for independence and worked closely with Nyerere who was president of TANU, the party which led Tanganyika to independence. Tanganyika won independence from Britain on 9 December 1961. The two were the most prominent leaders of the independence movement in Tanganyika in the 1950s. Oscar Kambona was a charismatic leader who also had great influence among the leaders of the African liberation movements based in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, second only to Nyerere, after the country won independence. He was a shining star in the constellation of Tanganyikan (later Tanzanian) politicians and it was widely believed that he would be the next president of the country if Nyerere no longer ran for office or stepped down for whatever reason. His stature as Nyerere's heir apparent or successor was enhanced when, as defence minister, he calmed down soldiers who could have overthrown the government. That was during the army mutiny in January 1964 when President Nyerere and Vice President Rashidi Kawawa were taken to a safe place by the members of the intelligence service in case the soldiers wanted to harm them. It was Oscar Kambona, alone, who confronted the soldiers and negotiated with them. He drove himself to the army barracks to talk to the army mutineers and listen to their demands. The soldiers wanted their salaries increased and British army officers replaced by African officers. There was, however, suspicion that some elements in the government and in the labour movement secretly worked with the soldiers to create a tense situation in an attempt to overthrow President Nyerere. Kambona obviously was not one of them. Had he wanted to, he could have used the opportunity to seize power. He was popular with the soldiers and they trusted him. He was also, during that time, minister of defence. Soldiers in neighbouring Kenya and Uganda also mutinied around the same time, within the next two days after Tanganyika's army mutiny which took place on 20 January, and made the same demands their counterparts did in Tanganyika. The army mutinies in the three African Great Lakes countries were suppressed by British troops who had been flown from Aden and Britain at the request of the nations' three respective leaders (Julius Nyerere of Tanganyika, Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, and Milton Obote of Uganda). Other British troops came from neighbouring Kenya. The mutinies were over in only a few days. After Nyerere came out of seclusion, he publicly thanked Oscar Kambona, whom he called \\"my colleague,\\" for defusing a potentially dangerous situation. In fact, when the soldiers remained defiant, it was Oscar Kambona who persuaded Nyerere to seek immediate assistance from the former colonial power, Britain, to suppress the mutiny. The two leaders had been close political allies and personal friends since the days of the independence struggle when they were the main leaders of the independence movement. In fact, when Kambona married a former Miss Tanganyika at a cathedral in London, Nyerere was his best man. But the two leaders started drifting apart a few years after independence. The first rift occurred in 1964 during the army mutiny, and then in 1965 when Tanzania officially became a one-party state. As a cabinet member, Oscar Kambona supported the transition to a one-party state but did so reluctantly, only as a team player. He was opposed to the change because he said there was no mechanism guaranteeing change of government by constitutional means in a country dominated by one party. He also contended that there were no constitutional safeguards to make sure that the country did not drift into dictatorship. The next split with Nyerere came in February 1967 when Tanzania adopted the Arusha Declaration, an economic and political blueprint for the transformation of Tanzania into a socialist state. Kambona was opposed to this fundamental change and argued that the government should first launch a pilot scheme to see if the policy was going to work on a national scale. Tanzania's socialist policy was mainly based on the establishment of ujamaa villages, roughly equivalent to communes or the Kibbutz in Israel, so that the people could live and work together for their collective well-being and make it easier for the government to provide them with basic services such as water supply, medical treatment at clinics, and education by building schools which could be within short distance from the villages. Oscar Kambona argued that it was important, first, to show the people that living in ujamaa villages, or collective communities, was beneficial and a good idea. He said that could be done by establishing a few ujamaa villages in different parts of the country as a pilot scheme to demonstrate the viability of those villages and show the people the benefits they would get if they agreed to live together and work together on communal farms. The debate, conducted mostly in private when the delegates of the ruling party TANU were discussing in a public forum the document of the Arusha Declaration, was between Oscar Kambona on one side and Julius Nyerere as well as Vice President Rashid Kawawa on the other side. They were the country's three main and most powerful and most influential leaders and met privately away from the delegates at the conference in Arusha to resolve their differences. The private meeting and debate went on for quite some time during the duration of the conference and whenever the subject came up, whether or not Tanzania should adopt socialist policies and establish ujamaa villages, Kawawa always supported Nyerere against Kambona. The two (Kambona and Kawawa) became bitter enemies thereafter. In fact, they started going separate ways even before then because Kambona saw Kawawa as no more than a \\"puppet\\" of Nyerere, manipulated at will, and who agreed with everything Nyerere said and wanted. However, when he was interviewed shortly after Kambona's death, Kawawa made a public statement that he \\"had no disagreement with Kambona and worked well with him as a colleague throughout.\\" The interview was broadcast by Radio Tanzania in 1997. Kambona was the only cabinet member who challenged Nyerere and stood up to him and saw him as his equal. There was probably another cabinet member, Chief Abdallah Said Fundikira III, Tanganyika's first minister of constitutional affairs, who not long after independence left the cabinet over disagreements with Nyerere. Fundikira had known Nyerere since their student days at Makerere University College in Uganda in the early 1940s. But the differences between Kambona and Nyerere were fundamentally ideological and more than just a dispute over the way ujamaa villages should be established. Kambona was opposed to socialism. He was not a socialist like Nyerere. He was a capitalist. He was also opposed to Chinese communist influence in Tanzania and believed that Nyerere's brand of socialism would be patterned after Chinese communist policies. He also believed that Chinese leader Mao Tse Tung had undue and profound influence on Nyerere. He attributed that to Nyerere's first visit to the People's Republic of China in 1965, contending that it was after this trip that Nyerere decided to establish a one-party state after he returned to Tanzania. But Kambona lost. The Arusha Declaration, Tanzania's socialist manifesto and political blueprint, was adopted in February 1967 and socialism became Tanzania's official policy. Exile A few months later, in July 1967, Oscar Kambona left Tanzania with his wife and children and went into \\"self-imposed\\" exile in London. It was first reported that he sneaked out of the country and drove all the way to Nairobi, Kenya, a neighbouring country. But it is highly unlikely that the members of the Tanzania's intelligence service were not aware of his departure. The government simply let him go. They could have stopped him, and could even have arrested him, if they wanted to. After he left and when his departure was reported in Tanzania's newspapers and on the radio, President Nyerere himself at a public rally in Dar es Salaam, the capital, talked about Kambona and said \\"Let him go.\\" He also said Kambona left with a lot of money and wondered how he got all that money which did not match his salary. There were rumours that one of the ways he enriched himself when he was in office was by taking some of the money which was intended to go to the liberation movements based in Tanzania. He was during that period also chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Liberation Committee overseeing liberation movements based in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in addition to his ministerial position as minister of external affairs. The allegations that he misappropriated some of the funds intended for the liberation struggle in Southern Africa, and got more money from other sources illegally or by unscrupulous means, was repeated on 12 January 1968, when President Nyerere challenged Oscar Kambona to return to Tanzania and testify before a judicial commission that he had not deposited large sums of money in his account, and explain where he got it from since it far exceeded his salary. Kambona responded to the allegations by requesting the Tanzanian government in a press conference in London in 1968 to hold a public investigation into his personal wealth and publish the findings. The government did not do that. It is also highly unlikely that Kambona misappropriated wealth since he spent most of his life in exile living in subsidised council housing for poor income families. Tony Laurence, in his book The Dar Mutiny of 1964 published by Book Guild Publishing, states that, fearing for his life, Kambona went to live in exile in Britain without any financial support and took a number of low-paying jobs to support himself and his family. Yet, during all that time, Kambona conducted himself with dignity, and with a sense of humour in spite of the hardship, and was a friend of other people also living in exile. Some of them were in a better financial position than he was. Nyerere's challenge to Kambona, asking him to account for his money, was reported in Tanzania's newspapers and by Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam (RTD) during that time. It has also been documented by Jacqueline Audrey Kalley in her voluminous work, Southern African Political History: A Chronology of Key Political Events from Independence to Mid-1997. There was also disagreement on the way Kambona's exile was described. Reports in Tanzania said he went into \\"self-imposed\\" exile but, to Kambona and his supporters as well as other observers, he was forced to leave Tanzania because he had fallen out with Nyerere and did not feel that he would be safe or lead a normal life in a hostile political climate. Speculation that he may have been in imminent danger just before he left was somewhat confirmed when his house in Magomeni, Dar es Salaam, was destroyed by the security forces and the soldiers of the Tanzania People's Defence Forces (TPDF) although not demolished. The destruction is shown in a photograph on the web site of the Kambona Foundation. The destruction of the house, after Kambona left, seemed to have been some kind of warning or simply a scare tactic and it probably achieved its purpose, especially with regard to Kambona's supporters in Tanzania. It probably meant, \\"this is what we have in store for you,\\" or \\"this is what you are going to get,\\" if you continue to support Kambona. And \\"this is what would have happened to him had he stayed.\\" That may be just one of the interpretations - why his house was destroyed. There may be other interpretations of the government's motives for sanctioning that. But fear for his security and freedom was real, further confirmed when his two younger brothers, Mattiya Kambona and Otini Kambona, were arrested around the same time he fled to London. They were detained for many years until President Nyerere released them. From his sanctuary in London, Oscar Kambona became a bitter critic and opponent of President Nyerere and his policies. He was even invited by the Nigerian military government of Yakubu Gowon in June 1968 to go and lecture in Nigeria after Tanzania recognised Biafra (the first country to do so in April that year), thus infuriating Nigerian leaders for supporting the secession of the Eastern Region of the Nigerian Federation. During his lecture tour of Nigeria in June 1968, Kambona denounced Nyerere as a dictator and accused the Tanzanian government of supplying weapons to Biafra. In a lecture in Lagos on 14 June 1968, he also said weapons and ammunition sent to Tanzania for the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) freedom fighters had been diverted by Nyerere and sent to Biafra; and went on to say that Tanzania's recognition of Biafra as a sovereign nation had damaged the country's reputation in Africa and elsewhere. Tanzania recognised Biafra for moral reasons because of the refusal and unwillingness of the local and the federal authorities to stop the massacre of Igbos and other Easterners in Northern Nigeria and other parts of the country, but especially in the North. Nigerian leaders were also quick to remind Nyerere that it was Nigerian troops who had saved him and provided security and defence for Tanganyika after the army mutiny in Tanganyika in 1964 when Nyerere appealed to fellow Africans for troops to temporarily provide defence while the Tanganyikan government was building a new army. Nigeria, under the leadership of President Nnamdi Azikiwe and Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa, immediately responded to Nyerere's request. Kambona was also quick to remind his listeners in Nigeria, and even in Britain where lived, that it was he who calmed down the soldiers when they mutinied while President Nyerere and Vice President Kawawa went into hiding, \\"in a grass hut,\\" as he put it. Coup Leader Not long after Kambona got ample publicity during his lecture tour of Nigeria in 1968 denouncing Nyerere, he was again in the news in Tanzania and other African countries and elsewhere. He was accused of masterminding a coup attempt to overthrow Nyerere1. The coup was to take place in October 1969. But all the alleged conspirators were arrested before the fateful date, except Kambona who was living in London. The alleged plotters were charged with treason. The chief witness for the prosecution was Potlako Leballo, president of the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), a South African liberation group based in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Leballo took over the leadership of the organisation after its first president, Mangaliso Roberto Sobukwe, were imprisoned by the apartheid regime. Leballo had gained the confidence of the coup plotters while he was working for Tanzania's intelligence service. His testimony proved critical in securirng a conviction of the accused during the treason trial presided over by Chief Justice Phillip Telfer Georges, a Trinidadian. The leading government attorney, besides Attorney-General Mark Bomani, was Nathaniel King, also from Trinidad. Kambona was the first accused and was charged in absentia. There were reports that he would be extradited to Tanzania but he never was. The Tanzanian government did not seek his extradition. It is also highly unlikely that the British government would have sent him back to Tanzania even if the two countries had an extradition treaty. And since he did not appear in court during the treason trial, he was not convicted. He could not have been convicted in a fair trial without himself being there to defend himself. During the trial, prosecuting attorney, Nathaniel King, said the coup plotters also intended to assassinate President Nyerere. He asked one of the accused, John Lifa Chipaka, what he meant when he said - in their secret communications obtained by the Tanzania intelligence service - they were going \\"to eliminate\\" Nyerere. Chipaka responded by saying, \\"Eliminate him politically, not physically.\\" Chief Justice Phillip Telfer Georges asked him the same question and was not convinced that Chipaka was telling the truth. Also the Chief Justice said the list of names found on the younger brother of John Chipaka, Eliya Dunstan Chipaka who was a captain, was not the kind of list one would expect to be a list of guests invited to a wedding. It was a list of army officers, potential participants in the planned coup, who were going to be approached or had already been approached by the conspirators to see if they could take part in the plot to overthrow the government. The list included officers from both sides of the union: Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar. The Chipaka brothers were cousins of Oscar Kambona. The court proceedings were reported in the newspapers and on the radio and they were open to the public. The records of those proceedidngs can be obtained from different sources, including newspapers from that period, and many documented works. They quote what the accused, the prosecuting attorneys, and the chief justice said during the trial. The transcript of the court proceedings, reported in Tanzanian newspapers and elsewhere, is also reproduced in Godfrey Mwakikagile, Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era. While his co-conspirators were languishing in prison after being convicted of treason, Oscar Kambona continued to criticise Nyerere from his safe haven in London through the years, while nurturing ambitions to return into the political arena in his home country where he once was a bright star in the 1960s before he fled to London. Return of the \\"prodigal son\\" It was not until 1992 after Tanzania adopted multiparty democracy that Kambona returned to lead one of the opposition parties after 25 years living in exile. He was the most prominent figure on the opposition side during that time after he returned to his home country. And he was in a combative mood. Even before he left London, he challenged the Tanzanian government to arrest him on his arrival in Tanzania, vowing that he was returning to Tanzania regardless of consequences and to clear his name before the people of Tanzania . He was not arrested. But that was not the end of his ordeal. The beginning of the end A campaign by the government was started to vilify him again. First was the claim that he was not a citizen of Tanzania and had never been one even though he had served as the country's minister of home affairs, minister of defence, and minister of foreign affairs, and even led the struggle for independence with Nyerere in the 1950s. Yet nothing was said in all those years that he was not a citizen of Tanganyika. It was only decades later, in the 1990s, that the government said he was not a Tanzanian but a Malawian. Others said he was a Mozambican. The government even withdrew his passport on the same grounds that he was not a Tanzanian citizen. He could not even travel outside the country after his passport was withdrawn. The vilification campaign against him by the Tanzanian government made the government look bad and it finally relented and gave the passport back to him. Kambona himself had his own \\"revelations\\" concerning the national identities of other Tanzanian leaders including President Nyerere himself. He said Nyerere's father was a Tutsi from Rwanda who was a porter for the Germans and settled in Tanganyika and that he could prove it. He also said Vice President Rashid Kawawa came from Mozambique, and John Malecela - who once served as Tanzania's foreign affairs minister, prime minister and vice president among other posts at different times - came from Congo where his grandparents were captured as slaves before they settled in Dodoma, central Tanzania. But few people took any of those claims seriously any more than they did the claim that Kambona himself was not a Tanzanian citizen but a Malawian, from Likoma Island, or a Mozambican. When Kambona returned to Tanzania, he also promised that he would tell the public how much money President Nyerere and Vice President Kawawa had stolen through the years and where they hid it. Many people were anxious to hear that. But when he addressed a mass rally in Dar es Salaam, he had nothing to say about the money he claimed President Nyerere and Vice president Kawawa stole. And many people were disappointed. It also cost him credibility among many people who believed that he simply did not tell the truth and had nothing to say about Nyerere and Kawawa with regard to their \\"misappropriation\\" of public funds. End of his life Kambona was indeed a luminary in Tanzanian politics. But he was no longer the star he once was, when he was second only to Nyerere in influence and popularity in the sixties when many people even copied his hair style, which came to be known as \\"Kambona style.\\" He died in London in July 1997, almost exactly 30 years after he first went into exile in Britain in July 1967 where he lived for 25 years before returning to his home country in 1992 to spend the last few years of his life. Despite his political misfortunes, Oscar Kambona will always be remembered as one of the most prominent leaders of Tanzania who also played a leading role in the struggle for independence and who relentlessly campaigned for the adoption of multiparty democracy in Tanzania. But he will also always be remembered as the most prominent Tanzanian leader who tried to overthrow President Julius Nyerere. It is, of course, anybody's guess how he would have been, as a leader, had he become president of Tanzania. Even his most bitter opponents can not prove he would have been a bad leader. He could have been one of the best presidents Tanzania ever had. We will never know. Or to put it another way, Oscar Kambona was one of the best presidents Tanzania never had. And it is very much possible that under his leadership, Tanzania's economy would probably not have suffered as much as it did under Nyerere during his years of socialist rule. Socialism ruined Tanzania's economy and Kambona was opposed to socialism right from the beginning, although many Tanzanians believed that Nyerere meant well but pursued the wrong policies. Even Kambona himself probably believed that Nyerere meant well but pursued the wrong policies and that the country would have done better had Nyerere and his colleagues been willing to listen to those who had different views on how the country should be run. Today, Tanzania is pursuing free-market policies after renouncing socialism, and has adopted multiparty democracy, the same policies and kind of political system Kambona had advocated all along. He has probably been vindicated by history.

Establishment Established as The Bay City Boat and Fishing Club in 1894, it is one of the oldest clubs on the Great Lakes. The name was changed to the Saginaw Bay Yacht Club in 1924. The present club house built in 1960. The Club has a full-service restaurant and bar open during the boating season. Guest docks are available and reciprocity is honored through the Interlake Yacht Club association and the American Registry of Yacht Clubs. Complete commercial marine facilities are located nearby.Bay YC Home Page, Official Page of the Saginaw Bay Yacht Club. Retrieved on September 22, 2007. History The club was originally called the Bay City Boating and Fishing Club, and was founded in the summer of 1894 by William Jennison and 109 other enthusiastic charter members. A clubhouse erected on pilings on the Saginaw River at the foot of Scheurmann in Essexville, Michigan; it opened in January 1895. At the time lumbering was king in the Saginaw Valley. Forty sawmills lined the banks of the Saginaw River from the mouth to above Bay City, and the pungent odors of freshly cut white pine and hemlock were ever present. Heavy traffic of steam tugs, tow barges leaving the mills with finished lumber, as well as incoming tugs towing log rafts or barges loaded with logs from lumbering areas, had to be a challenge as well as a hazard for the yachtsmen navigating the river. Sail and steamboats navigated their way up and down river. Activity slowed in 1898 after Ontario, Canada decreed that all timber cut on Crown lands must stay in Canada, cutting supplies for the mills significantly. Some mills along the Saginaw closed and some moved further north. The small clubhouse was rapidly outgrown. With a shortage of mooring space, the club members decided to move downriver and move their clubhouse, plus add a new facility. Luckily, an ideal parcel of land with frontage on the river and deep approximately a mile from the mouth of the river was available. A membership meeting voted unanimously to proceed with plans, provided that the membership could be increased to 150. This was quickly accomplished. The small clubhouse was transported over the winter ice to the new site. Henry Webber, a building contractor, was hired to construct a new building alongside it. Completion date was set for July 1, 1904. An artist's rendition of the new clubhouse appeared in the Bay City Tribune newspaper on May 5, 1904; the membership anticipated the best boating and social season ever. A grand opening of the beautiful 40' x 50' Victorian building was held on July 8, 1904. A number of pilings were driven in the river in front of the clubhouse and floats attached with chain for boat moorings. Occasionally strong northerly storms scattered the fleet, sinking some boats at their moorings. Between 1952 and 1956, basins were dredged on the north and south sides of the clubhouse, 600' (182m) long by 150' (46m) wide and eleven feet deep, eliminating further damage to the fleet. The day came when the club building was in dire need of repairs. The pilings it rested on had been shifted by the ice and were deteriorating. The floors were badly warped by previous flooding and the upper balcony had been closed for some time due to its poor condition. In 1959 the old building was demolished, and a new club constructed, featuring the latest in modern facilities and conveniences. The grand opening was held in conjunction with the Commodores' Ball in April 1960. The Saginaw Bay Yacht Club continues to grow and improve its facilities to maintain its reputation as one of the finest clubs on the Great Lakes.Bay YC History, Official Page of the Saginaw Bay Yacht Club.

Born in the Tuscany region of Italy (probably Lucca), Ramacciotti was reportedly associated with Garibaldi and held a military rank. Ramaciotti immigrated to the US in 1848, moving to Buffalo, New York. He apprenticed in a piano company in Buffalo before founding his own piano string company, the F. Ramacciotti company, in 1852. In 1853, he married Rachel Rendt of Detroit, Michigan. The couple had five children: Albert, Hugo, Italo, Eugenia, and Emma. In 1867, Ramaciotti moved his company to New York City. He invented and patented the first modern bass string for the piano. Previous piano strings used iron winding over iron. This modern invention using a special new machine used copper wound over iron. The company was one of the top makers of piano strings in the world for several decades. In 1894, Francis Ramacciotti died. His son Albert took over the company the next year. Albert expanded it to one of the three top string makers in the nation.

This would be the second and final album by the band released on the United Artists Records label. Background=Scrapped 2nd album for United Artist Records During mid 1967 the band were working on the follow-up to their Good Friday album with producer Glyn Johns at Olympic Recording Studios. According to John Tait's book Vanda & Young: Inside Australia's Hit factory, the album was to be titled Good Times. However, due to legal issues between the band and its Australian production company Albert Productions, that album was permanently shelved. Some of the surviving tracks (\\"Good Times\\", \\"Land of Make Believe\\"), as well as newly recorded ones, would be used on what was now titled Vigil (so titled as tribute to the fans who held vigil for the album's long release). Other songs from the original Good Times album would eventually be released on The Shame Just Drained compilation in 1977. Tracks from the scrapped album included: * \\"Good Times\\" (released on the Vigil album) * \\"Land of Make Believe\\" (released on the Vigil album) * \\"We'll Make It Together\\" (released on The Shame Just Drained compilation) * \\"Mr. Riley of Higginbottom & Clive\\" (released on The Shame Just Drained compilation) * \\"Where Old Men Go\\" (released on The Shame Just Drained compilation) * \\"Amanda Storey\\" (released on The Shame Just Drained compilation) * \\"Station on the Third Avenue\\" (released on The Shame Just Drained compilation) * \\"Where Did You Go Last Night\\" (released on the Raven Records EP, Son of Easyfever) * \\"My Old Man's a Groovy Old Man\\" (released on Best of The Easybeats ‚Äì Volume 2 compilation) * \\"I Know It\\" (still unreleased) * \\"Bad News\\" (still unreleased) Singles and recording Vigil Work continued on recordings after the band returned from their US tour in September 1967. During this period, the group worked with arrangers Bill Shepherd and Alan Tew. In late 1967, they released two singles that would later appear on the released album: \\"Falling Off the Edge of the World\\" in the US and \\"The Music Goes 'Round My Head\\"/\\"Come in You'll Get Pneumonia\\" in the UK. Their next single \\"Hello, How Are You\\" marked a change in musical direction for the group with its soft pop/adult contemporary sound. The song reached #20 in the UK Charts in March 1968. However, the band have always felt the change in sound might have hurt their standing with the public. The song's co-writer, George Young, later reflected in Rolling Stone Australia: \\"The people in the industry dig it and it skidded in and out of the Top 20. But it was a classic mistake from our point of view. We were a rock 'n' roll band and what was a rock band doing with this corn-ball, schmaltz shit? We shouldn't have done that\\". Australian format Unlike the Good Friday album, Vigil did receive an official release in the band's home country Australia. The Australian version would have the cover songs \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\", \\"Hit The Road Jack\\" and \\"I Can't Stand It\\" removed and \\"Bring a Little Lovin'\\" added. The track order would also be radically different from the UK release. It was released in 1968 through Albert Productions/Parlophone. The album was only released in mono, as stereo was still not common place for locally produced records. In New Zealand, the album was also released through Albert Productions/Parlophone, but the UK track order was kept and a stereo version was released. In March 2017, the Australian version of Vigil was re-issued on vinyl for Record Store Dayhttp://recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/9437. North American format - Falling Off the Edge of the World See: main article The North American version of Vigil was re-titled Falling Off the Edge of the World and issued in October 1968 with a different album cover and running order from the UK release. This version was pared down to 12 songs from 14, omitting \\"Sha La La\\" and \\"We All Live Happily Together\\". A different recording of the title track (known as the \\"second version\\") replaced the more common version from the Australian and UK/European releases. This version of the album has also been released on CD, paired with Friday On My Mind on the Collectables label. Release and reception UK release The album was titled Vigil, due to the long wait fans had since their last album Good Friday. It was not a commercially or critically successful album. Reviews from the time were mixed. Disc and Music Echo commented: \\"They have a good habit of selecting good numbers. You'll find many of them on this album. Sometimes their vocalizing gets a bit strained but their interesting orchestrations are strong on excitement.\\". In a modern review from All Music, Bruce Eder wrote: \\"There's a real sense of simply going through the motions of making music, and no originality to speak of on most of the songs\\". Vigil would be last the band would record for United Artists Records. The UK/European version was later reissued by Repertoire Records and featured ten bonus tracks. Australian release Like the UK album, the Australian release was neither a commercial or critical success. Along with The Best of The Easybeats Volume 2, the Australian version of Vigil was not reissued on compact disc by Albert Productions in the 1980s and 1990s.

It lies 150 km (95 mi) west of the capital city Riga in Skrunda Municipality.  History  The historical sources first mentioned Skrunda () in the Curonian Peninsula in 1253. In 1368 the Skrund Castle of the German Order was built on the left bank of Venta. During the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia period glass mills, powder mills, nail, gun and rifle workshops were operating in Skrunda. The finished products were transported down the Venta River. From 1685 through Skrunda, the main postal route of the Dukedom is Jelgava - Dobele - Blidene - Saldus - Skrunda - Grobina - Liepaja - Sventa - Momele. During the Swedish invasion in course of Great Northern War town was plundered. At the beginning of the 19th century, near the ruins of the former Order Castle, the Skrunda Manor House was built in the classic style. It was restored in 1881. The settlement began to form after the construction of the narrow-gauge railway line Liepaja- Aizpute, Aizputes-Skrunds- Saldus, during the First World War. During the struggle for freedom in Latvia, between 22 and 29 January 1919, at Skrunda, a major battle took place between the 2nd Soviet Latvian Riflemen's Regiment and the Latvian Special Battalion, under the leadership of Oskars Kalpaks. After the agrarian reform of 1920, the lands of Skrunda's manor were divided into building plots. In 1925 Skrunda was given the status of a densely populated (village) estate. With the opening of the Gl√ºda-Liepaja high-speed railway line in 1929, the economic development of Skrunda accelerated. In 1935 in Skrunda there were about 50 small business companies, as well as several industrial enterprises: watermills, linen processing workshop, two sawmills, two mechanical workshops. In 1950 Skrunda was granted status of a workers' village, in 1961 it gain town council. In the period from 1950 to 1959, Skrunda was the center of Skrunda district. In 1969, the VEF factory was built in Skrunda. During the Soviet era there was the Aizpute peat factory, geological and hydrogeological expedition, PMK section, workshops for utility services, fisheries \\"Skrunda\\", and the reloading base of the woodcutting plant \\"Volcano\\". In 1996 Skrundai was granted city rights.  Skrunda-1  There is a former Soviet secret city near the town - Skrunda-1, which housed two major radar installations during the Cold War period. One radar was demolished in 1995. Pursuant to an agreement between the Republic of Latvia and the Russian Federation, the other radar suspended operations on August 31, 1998. In October 1999, after several months of dismantling, the dismantled installations were repatriated to Russia and the last Russian troops and families vacated the area. Skrunda-1 is currently a ghost town, as the last remaining residents abandoned the town in 1999. The Soviet Union, when building secret installations, usually left the name of the settlement off the map and referred to them literally by the name of the nearest town, plus a number (usually a 1). In February 2010 the town was sold to a Russian investor for 1.6 million Latvian lats ($3.1 million); after that bidder (and a runner-up) backed out, the property was auctioned on June 4, 2010 to Iniciative Europa for 170,000 Latvian lats ($333,000).http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/real_estate/?doc=27830 However the property remains abandoned with a lone guard blocking the main entrance to keep tourists away.http://travelinlatvia.com/web/map/regions/kurzeme-2/kuldiga- lejaskurzeme/kuldiga-and-lower-kurzeme-where-to-stay/skrunda-soviet-radar- base/ The property then was purchased by Skrunda municipality for 12 000‚Ç¨, which in early 2016 started trading tickets for ‚Ç¨4 to visit the ghost town, however failing to generate interest from investors the municipality gave tenure of the property to the Ministry of Defense, which will use it for military exercises.

The congregation is the oldest Methodist congregation in North America, founded on October 12, 1766 as the Wesleyan Society in America.Heritage Landmarks The Society built its first church, a blue stucco barn called the Wesley Chapel, on this site in 1768; its design was attributed to Barbara Heck. Timber from the Chapel was later used in building the Bowery Village Methodist Church and the Park Avenue United Methodist Church. The second church on this site was built in 1817-18, and the extravagance of the building provoked a secession from the congregation by Rev. William Stillwell. The third church, the current one, was necessitated by the widening of John Street. The church was designated a New York City Landmark in 1965 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. In 1984, the church sold its air rights to 33 Maiden Lane. Hymnist Fanny Crosby was a member of the church congregation for many years.

He produced two short story collections and five novels in Punjabi. Most of his work was transliterated in Gurumukhi script in Indian Punjab. Besides his Punjabi works, he was a well known Urdu and Punjabi poet.  Early life  He was born on 1 January 1955 in Adam Ke Cheema village, Daska Tehsil, Sialkot District, Punjab, Pakistan. Literary life Mir Tanha Yousufi started his literary voyage as an Urdu poet. Since 1972, when he was an undergraduate science student, he kept sending his ghazals and poems to various literary magazines and literary pages of national news papers. Work in Urdu From 1986 onwards he continued contributing poems, ghazals and short stories to Urdu magazines including: ‚ÄúFanoon (Lahore)‚Äù edited by late Ahmed Nadeem Qasimi, ‚ÄúTakhleeq (Lahore)‚Äù edited by Azhar Javed, \\"Moaasir (Lahore)‚Äù edited by Ata- ul-Haq Qasimi, ‚ÄúAdabiyat (Pakistan Academy of Letters' quarterly magazine) and ‚ÄúKitab (Literary magazine of Pakistan Book Foundation). =Urdu poetry= His first Urdu poetry collection ‚ÄúLuknat (Fumbling)\\" was published in 1996. It contains modern as well as traditionally styled ghazals with a handful of poems (free versed as well as metered). The book was received with a critical acclaim and appreciation from the contemporary men of letters. Second collection of Urdu poetry is ready to go to the press. The contents of this book would be styled similar to the \\"Luknat\\". A good portion of this next Urdu poetry collection has already been contributed to various magazines. =Urdu prose= Although Yousufi had a good number of Urdu short stories; both in post modern and plain traditional style, yet the matter is not sufficient to be presented in the form of a book. He believed in quantity, yet he felt that quality is of prime importance which is a must for any creative piece of work. A few of his Urdu Afsanas were published in magazines. Punjabi work Punjabi being his mother tongue; it was but natural to keep moving between Urdu poetry to Punjabi poetry. This drove him to write Punjabi prose as well, which he did with consistency and ended up with the publication of his first book in Punjabi. Some of these magazines are listed as: ‚ÄúSver International‚Äù edited by Jamil Paul, ‚ÄúRvel‚Äù and ‚ÄúMeeti‚Äù edited by Ilyas Ghumman, ‚ÄúLehraan‚Äù edited by Akhter Hussain Akhter and \\"Pancham\\" edited by Saqib Maqsood.

And here entered Ilyas Ghumman in his life. Ilyas Ghumman, an electrical engineer by profession, is a Lahore- based renowned Punjabi writer, worker and publisher. He has a world fame for organizing events regarding the development and progress of Punjabi language, literature and culture. He asked Yousufi to try his pen for writing down some novelette/novel. This suggestion of Ghumman drove Mir Tanha Yousufi to produce his first Punjabi novel =Treh= ‚ÄúTreh {Thirst}\\" in 1998. Fluently written, clear in thoughts, rushing story lines and the purity of the language made this book a surprise for the Punjabi readers. =Ik Samadar Paar= Seeing the response on \\"Treh\\", Mir Tanha Yousufi was asked for more. Thus his second novel \\"Ik Samandar Paar [Across One Sea]\\", published in 2000, won the prestigious Punjabi literary award from \\"Masood Khaddar Posh Trust\\". ‚ÄúMasood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award\\" is regarded as the most respectable of all awards in Punjabi. It is well known in Pakistani Punjabi writers' community what \\"Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award\\" actually means. Some writers spent their life span to win it just for once! =Khiddoo= Taking further courage, he penned down his next novel \\"Khiddoo [The Cotton Ball]\\"; which won the award from \\"Masood Khaddar Posh Trust\\" for the second time, in the year 2002. Kaalaa Chaanan During all these years of writing \\"Treh\\", \\"Ik Samandar Paar\\" and \\"Khiddoo\\", along with his continuous activities in other Urdu and Punjabi writings (both poetry and prose), he had been thinking to write down something real big, a saga in Punjabi language. A deep research work, knowledge of the history and geography of the backdrop locale of the novel, the study of the civilization, culture and anthropology of area was needed. And thus, was written his Pakistan's \\"National Literary Award, 2005\\" or \\"Syed Waris Shah Award, 2005\\" winner Punjabi novel \\"Kaalaa Chaanan [Black Light]\\"; which spans over 728 pages and is the thickest novel in Punjabi published in Pakistan till 2005.

These stories had been published in various Punjabi magazines and kept making waves all these years due to style, language and intellect. The book was named \\"Tae Faer [Then What?]\\"and was published in 2005. This book picked up \\"Pakistan Writers' Guild Punjab's Best Prose Book in Punjabi printed in 2005.

This marked the second execution in the state of California since 1967, and the last execution by gas chamber in that state. Mason killed four elderly people in 1980, his cellmate in 1982, and is suspected of murdering his male lover.  Childhood  Mason was subjected to severe physical, psychological and verbal abuse by his strict fundamentalist Christian parents. He attempted to commit suicide at the age of five by swallowing a bottle of pills and setting his clothes on fire, the first of at least 25 reported attempts in the next 20 years. His behavior from an early age was uncontrollable. He set fires, attacked other children, and at the age of eight was found standing over his baby brother‚Äôs crib with a knife. His parents reportedly resorted to locking him in a room called ‚Äúthe dungeon‚Äù, a bedroom with the windows nailed shut. When he was 11 and defecated himself, his mother pinned a baby‚Äôs soiled nappies on him and made him wear his own soiled underwear on his head. On another occasion, his father allegedly strapped him to a workbench, gagged him and beat him unconscious. Mason was diagnosed with PTSD.  Criminal history  In July 1977, Mason stabbed a store clerk with an ice pick after robbing the store. He threatened to kill her if she called the police and testified against him. Mason was sentenced in November 1977 to 36 months in state prison. In March 1980, Mason assaulted and attempted to rob a victim who was returning home late at night. During the ensuing fight, Mason struck the victim on the top of the head with a gun. In December 1980, Mason gained admittance to the home of an elderly couple through the pretext of selling and delivering firewood. Mason then handcuffed the victims to chairs and robbed them of $47,000 worth of jewelry and coins. At the time of his arrest in February 1981, Mason had in his possession a loaded sawed-off shotgun and pistol and other ammunition. He was convicted and sentenced in April 1982. He confessed to these crimes and was sentenced in June 1982 to a total of 124 months in state prison for both 1980 crimes.  Murders  In 1980, Mason committed four murders, one on March 6, one on August 18, one on November 16, and one on December 6, and a murder of a cellmate in 1982. Mason was wanted in Butte County for the 1980 shooting and killing his lover while the victim was sleeping. He committed many other infractions. On January 27, 1984 he was sentenced to death. He was executed on August 24, 1993 in San Quentin's gas chamber. Execution Mason was executed August 24, 1993 in the gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison. He was the first condemned inmate to voluntarily waive his appeals on a federal level. The execution was scheduled for 12:01 a.m. At two minutes before midnight, a federal judge called the prison to verify that Mason's attorney was present should Mason wish to stop the proceedings. At 12:05 a.m. Mason was escorted into the chamber. At 12:08 a.m. Warden Daniel Vasquez stepped into the chamber, pointed out the location of Mason's attorney in the witness area, and asked Mason if he had changed his mind and wished to stop the proceedings. According to Warden Vasquez, Mason said, \\"No Warden, I want to proceed; thank you Warden.\\" At 12:09 a.m. the lethal gas was introduced into the chamber. Mason was pronounced dead at 12:23 a.m. Mason spent his last day visiting with family members. At approximately 6:00 p.m. he was escorted to the death watch cell. Mason was given unlimited use of the telephone to converse with his family members. Mason refused any last meal, requesting only ice water while in the death watch cell. Mason told the warden that he had no final words to impart.

The school provides a combined religious and secular single-sex education to approximately 750 male students, including training in talmud, musar literature, history, classical Jewish scholarship and literature, mathematics, language arts and sciences.  Students  The New York branch of the school consists of two buildings. One of them houses approximately 650 boys ranging in age from nursery school through the twelfth grade; the school maintains a separate building for tertiary study, with an additional enrollment of about 100 students. It has a student-teacher ratio of approximately nineteen to one, and is staffed by renowned teachers and rabbis.  Alumni  Graduates of the school generally pursue further Talmudic education in such institutions as the Brisk yeshiva and Mir yeshiva in Jerusalem, as well as Beth Medrash Govoha in New Jersey, with a significant percentage of school alumni occupying rabbinic pulpits and positions of Jewish education. They also attend prestigious universities such as Harvard law.  Controversies  The yeshiva made headlines when one of its teachers and assistant principal, Joel (Yehuda) Kolko, was charged in 2006 with sexually abusing two first-graders and forcing an adult former student to touch him during a visit to the school. Six former students also filed suit against the yeshiva, alleging the school administrators knew about Kolko‚Äôs molestation of students for decades, but sought to cover it up and intimidate students who spoke out. Kolko later pleaded guilty to two lesser counts of child endangerment and was sentenced to three years' probation, and has since left the school. The suit also alleged that school principal Lipa Margulies waged a \\"a campaign of intimidation, concealment and misrepresentations designed to prevent victims from filing lawsuits.\\" Four of the lawsuits were dismissed for being filed beyond the then five year statute of limitations. In October, 2016 it was reported that the school had reached a $2.1 million settlement on the two remaining cases.Edelman, Susan (October 23, 2016) \\"Brooklyn Yeshiva Settles with Sexual Assault Accusers for $2.1M\\", New York Post.

He was the son of Fujiwara no Maro, and, according to the genealogy book Sonpi Bunmyaku, his mother was Uneme of Yakami no K≈çri, Inaba Province, who is probably the same person who had a famous affair with Aki no ≈åkimi. The collection of Japanese poems Man'y≈çsh≈´ does not include his works. With an unknown woman he had a son , among other children with other women. The footnote of Sonpi Bunmyaku, however, notes that Toyohiko is actually the grandson of Hamanari. Hamanari achieved the court rank of and the position of sangi.  Life  As the heir of his father Maro, the founder of the Ky≈çke, Hamanari was a central figure of that clan. However, he was almost a generation younger than the second heads of the Nanke, Hokke, and Shikike, and this left him always a step behind their advancement. Hamanari was conferred the rank of in 751. Under Empress K≈çken, he held high-level positions in various ministries, but his promotion stagnated at this rank until Fujiwara no Nakamaro's rebellion in 764. He supported Empress K≈çken's side in the conflict, and was promoted to a month later. He held a position as director of the gy≈çbu-sh≈ç, and in 772 was promoted to and sangi, joining the ranks of the kugy≈ç. In 773, Emperor K≈çnin's heir was disinherited, and according to the rekishi monogatari Mizukagami, Hamanari opposed Fujiwara no Momokawa's candidate Prince Yamabe, the future Emperor Kanmu, in favor of his brother by another mother, on the grounds that Yamabe's mother was descended from immigrants from Baekje. Still, Hamanari was steadily promoted in K≈çnin's court: in 774 to , in 775 to , and in 776 to . In 781, after Emperor Kanmu assumed the throne, Hamanari was assigned away from the capital as director of the Dazaifu. Two months later, he was demoted within that body, had his retainers reduced from ten people to three and his stipend reduced by two-thirds, and was commanded to stop performing his actual duties and leave them to his supposed subordinate. This was likely intended by Kanmu to set an example for his opposition, and perhaps also as retribution. In 782, Hamanari's son-in-law Higami no Kawatsugu rebelled, and Hamanari was implicated and stripped of his high position as sangi. He was never able to return to the center of government. Hamanari died in the Daizaifu in 790, at the age of 67.  Personality  Hamanari was well-read, and practiced divination and onmy≈çd≈ç. He held positions in various ministries, but was unable to produce any impressive results. According to the Shoku Nihongi, this brought suffering to his subordinates and the people. For poetics, he is best known for Kaky≈ç Hy≈çshiki, the oldest extant piece of Japanese poetic criticism. In it, he attempts to apply phonetic rules of Chinese poetry to Japanese poetry.

Chesterton, whom Kolnai viewed as \\"a brilliant, if unsystematic phenomenologist of common experience.\\"Mahoney, Daniel J. \\"The Recovery of the Common World: An Introduction to the Moral and Political Reflection of Aurel Kolnai.\\" Privilege and Liberty and Other Essays in Political Philosophy. Lexington Books: Lanham, Maryland. 1999. Page 2. He then began a career of political journalism, writing for Der √ñsterreichische Volkswirt and Die Sch√∂ne Zukunft. Acutely aware of the real threat posed by the Nazi Party in Austria, he began writing for Der christliche St√§ndestaat, a periodical founded to combat Nazism and edited by Dietrich von Hildebrand. During this time, he also published some of his own philosophical writings including his Sexualethik, Der Ekel, Der Inhalt der Politik, and Der Versuch √ºber den Ha√ü. Kolnai's philosophical writings, though producing little profit for the author, were well received and generated excellent reviews. Salvador Dal√≠ was impressed by Der Ekel; in a 1932 essay for the journal This Quarter, the painter recommended Kolnai's text strongly to other surrealists, praising its analytical power.Andreas Dorschel, 'Genaue Imagination', in: S√ºddeutsche Zeitung No. 106 (7 May 2008), p. 14 During the 1930s, the encroachment of the Nazi Party in Austria remained a major concern. In 1938, Kolnai published his critique of National Socialism titled The War Against the West. The Nazi threat compelled Kolnai to leave Austria in 1937, where he was then a citizen, and depart for France where he married Elisabeth Gemes in 1940, also a Catholic convert. The Vichy threat prevented the newly-wed Kolnai from remaining in France, and after a brief stay in England, Kolnai and his wife moved to Quebec where he accepted a teaching position at the University of Laval. Frustrated by what he saw as the oppressive parochial Catholicism and the rigid neo-Thomism, Kolnai left Quebec in 1955 and returned to England on a Nuffield Foundation Travel Grant. Though he had quite an extensive list of publications in five different languages, Kolnai had little luck finding a permanent professorship in Britain, and fraught with financial worries, his health began to rapidly decline. Due largely to the influence of Harry Acton, Bernard Williams, and David Wiggins, Kolnai was able to secure a part-time \\"Visiting Lectureship\\" at Bedford College at London University. In England at this time, Kolnai became very influenced by the English common-sense philosophy of G.E. Moore and other British intuitionists such as H.A. Prichard, E.F. Carritt, and W.D. Ross.David Wiggins and Bernard Williams. \\"Aurel Thomas Kolnai.\\" Ethics, Value, and Reality: Selected Papers of Aurel Kolnai. University of London Athlone Press: 1977. In 1961, he received a one-year research fellowship at Birmingham. In 1968, he accepted a visiting professor position at Marquette University in Wisconsin which he maintained until 1973 when he died of a heart attack. Kolnai's wife Elisabeth worked on compiling, translating, and publishing his work until her death in 1982.  Philosophical writings and major themes  Kolnai is an eclectic, well-read thinker in the fields of philosophy, economics, and politics. His major philosophical influences were the phenomenological school of Husserl and British analytic philosophy. A major theme in his writings is the effort to recover the givenness of reality and the sovereignty of the object in order to develop a common-sense approach to philosophy. Kolnai drew on the philosophical realism of Thomas Aquinas and believed that Aquinas could provide a valuable contribution to the recovery of broad dialectical objectivism, but he was opposed to the rigidity of 20th century neo-Thomistic orthodoxy and the dogmatic claims of Thomistic ideology.Mahoney, Daniel J. \\"The Recovery of the Common World: An Introduction to the Moral and Political Reflection of Aurel Kolnai.\\" Privilege and Liberty and Other Essays in Political Philosophy. Lexington Books: Lanham, Maryland. 1999. Page 5. Kolnai's objectivism rests on four claims: #The importance of ordinary experience to provide access to the real #The importance of secular experience and common sense in the standards of 'tradition' #The importance of philosophical teachers and Authorities to 'guide, instruct, and inform' #The importance of receptivity to the 'multiplicity of objects and modes of cognition' to overcome subjectivityKolnai. Ethics, Value, and Reality: Selected Papers of Aurel Kolnai. University of London Athlone Press: 1977. Pages 27-29. Kolnai was critical of Martin Heidegger's and Sartre's existentialism, claiming that \\"they have nothing to offer but doom- consciousness spiced with a high-sounding idealistic demand‚Äîor worse: a new version of the aesthete's surrender to active barbarism, an espousal of totalitarian tyranny as the next best substitute for the impossible pursuit of total freedom.\\"Kolnai. Ethics, Value, and Reality: Selected Papers of Aurel Kolnai. University of London Athlone Press: 1977. Page 136. Quoted in Mahoney, \\"The Recovery of the Common World.\\" Page 6. Because the world was fallen and tension-ridden, Kolnai thought that Christianity should make its concern the secular world, in order to instill in it practical reason and morality, as expressed in a revealing passage in The War Against the West: > Personally I am inclined to think that in spite of its Christian polish, > Luther's pessimism is more pagan than Hegel's pagan optimism, the latter > being not entirely foreign to nineteenth-century progressive and > constitutionalist views. For black despair is the very core of overweening > arrogance. It is true that with Luther this is wrapped in the thread-bare > guise of reckless belief in God's grace independent of man's conduct. Hegel, > on the other hand, preserves some elements of actual morality.Kolnai, The > War Against the West. Page 127. Another major theme in Kolnai's writings is his anti-utopianism. Daniel Mahoney contextualizes Kolnai's anti-utopianism among such thinkers as Alain Besan√ßon and V√°clav Havel as well as Solzhenitsyn who viewed utopian thinking as the ideological underpinning of totalitarianism. Kolnai explores what he calls the \\"utopian mind\\" phenomenologically, which he links with what he calls the \\"perfectionist illusion,\\" which is marked by the view that human goods existing in a state of tension can somehow be reconciled. The reconciliation of value and reality, according to Kolnai \\"suggests the idea of a rupture between the given reality of the world and the counter-reality 'set apart.'\\"Kolnai, The Utopian Mind. Page 157. Quoted in Mahoney \\"The Recovery of the Common World.\\" Page 9. Kolnai thought that the identification of utopianism with a search for justice was misguided, led to the \\"forced negation of ineliminable tensions.\\"Kolnai, The Utopian Mind. Page 158, 185-95. Quoted in Mahoney, Ibid, Page 9. The quest for a utopia was, in its essence, a quest for a world no longer fraught with tension or human alienation‚Äîa quest which Kolnai saw as doomed to inevitable failure. Kolnai's political thought arises from both his phenomenological method and his belief in the importance of philosophy for human life. His emphasis on common sense and his practical point of view frames his political discussions in which he expresses himself as a genuine conservative, praising such concepts as social privilege and hierarchy. However, though Kolnai was sympathetic to what he called \\"the conservative ethos,\\" he was not a partisan thinker but rather a self- proclaimed centrist opposed to all forms of totalitarianism. Kolnai had an ongoing concern that unrestrained liberalism would inevitably end in totalitarianism, and his critiques of liberalism as he saw it manifest in the United States and Europe center on preventing such consequences. While supporting the cause of the liberal West and affirming pluralism, Kolnai also aptly stated that \\"to love democracy well, it is necessary to love it moderately.\\"Manent, Pierre. Tocqueville and the Nature of Democracy. Rowman & Littlefield: Lanham, MD. 1996. Page 32. Quoted in Mahoney \\"The Recovery of the Common World.\\" Page 15. Kolnai's ethical thought is characterized by strong loves and hates and expressed in terms of values and universal meanings. Broadly, his ethical thought can be described as Christian imperfectionism opposed to the elevation of morality beyond the everyday life. The negative character of moral duties was key for Kolnai, as expressed in his treatise on \\"Morality and Practice II:\\" > When we speak of 'respecting' alien property (as also life or rights) we use > that word in its weak sense of 'leaving alone,' 'not touching,' 'not > interfering with,' much as it is used in French medical language (the rash > of typhus fever 'respects' the face, i.e. in the soberer style of English > textbooks, the face 'escapes'), not in its strong sense of positive > appreciation for something distinctively noble and respectable . . .Kolnai, > \\"Morality and Practice II.\\"\\" Page 105-106. Kolnai was strongly influenced by Max Scheler's value ethics, and he thought that if all things were viewed axiologically, assessed first for value, as opposed to the language of 'ought' or 'must,' then one was provided with \\"a realm of approbative or disapprobative insights . . . without stressing the unbridgeable gulf between Is and Ought.\\" Thus, > \\"value ethics precludes the classic pitfalls in Ethics: Hedonism or > Eudemonism; Utilitarianism and Consequentialism of any kind, i.e. the > interpretation of moral in terms of allegedly more evident primary, natural > cognitive experiences; and various kinds of Imperativism: 'duty' cut off > from Good and Bad, and its interpretation in terms either of a concrete > (social, monarchical, fashionable . . . ) authority, or the 'rational ego,' > or of 'Conscience. . . . Axiological ethic directs our attention not only to > the plurality of moral values and disvalues, but to the falseness of every > monism in regard to the object of moral valuation: be it action, intention, > maxim or motive, virtue and vice, character, and all the more of course > wisdom or again ontological perfection.\\"Kolnai, Ethics, Value, and Reality: > Selected Papers of Aurel Kolnai. University of London Athlone Press: 1977. > Page xx-xxi. Kolnai currently remains relatively unknown, but especially in the light of the dialectical return to classical political theory in the writings of Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin, as well as the recent debates concerning neo- Conservative philosophy, it is likely that Kolnai will receive increasingly more attention in the near future. Kolnai has been praised by influential figures such as Dietrich von Hildebrand, H.B. Acton, Bernard Williams, and Pierre Manent.

History The school, originally called Ëá∫ÂçóÂ∑ûÁ´ãËá∫ÂçóÁ¨¨‰∫å‰∏≠Â≠∏Ê†° (\\"Tainan Second High School\\"), was established in 1922 by the Governor-General of Taiwan to achieve a Japanese and Taiwanese 'learning together' policy. The Tainan Second High School provided high school education for ethnic Taiwanese, while Tainan First High School was for ethnic Japanese from mainland Japan. Originally set up as a five-year high school, it was changed to a four-year school in 1943 due to the start of World War II. After the war, Taiwan was handed to the Republic of China, whose high school system was a 3-3-year one. In 1959, ShinHua Campus was established for senior high school students in ShinHua Township, Tainan County. The campus became independent in 1966 and was renamed to National ShinHua Senior High School. In 1970, Tainan Second High School was renamed to Provincial Tainan First High School. After Tainan was no longer included in Taiwan Province, the school became nationally funded.

It was the only cable car line ever built in Omaha, and had only four lines of tracks in operation. History The Omaha Cable Tramway Company was originally formed in 1884, and began operating in 1887. Its power house was at 20th and Harney Streets in Downtown Omaha. Frederick Drexel, who came to Omaha in 1856, helped incorporate the Cable Tramway Company in 1887. Former Omaha mayor Ezra Millard was the first treasurer of the company when he died in 1886, and Samuel R. Johnson was the president. The company had a bad image because of frequent disruptions in service caused by cable breakages. The cables were made of wire and hemp rope. In 1887 the company was sued by the Omaha Horse Railway for infringing on its territory after the Cable Tramway Company built tracks on the same street the railway operated on. The case was dismissed by a district court judge. After electrically powered trams were introduced in Omaha, in April 1889 the Cable Tramway Company consolidated with the Omaha Horse Railway under the name Omaha Street Railway Company, which was then disbanded in 1896.

One of the methods employed by eNotaries is the use of a digital signature and digital notary seal to notarize digital documents and validate with a digital certificate. Electronic notarization is a process whereby a notary affixes an electronic signature and notary seal using a secure Public key to an electronic document (such as a PDF or Word document). Once affixed to the electronic document, the document is rendered tamper evident such that unauthorized attempts to alter the document will be evident to relying parties. The e-notary will use cryptography and Public key infrastructure to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke the digital certificate. The Electronic Notary also must keep an electronic register of each act performed. In most cases, electronic notarizations does not mean that the notary can perform the electronic notarizations remotely as most states still require that the participants and the notary must all be physically present at the time of signing. There are also significant benefits to having the notarizations done electronically such as cost savings, superior security, authenticity, audit trails, and document integrity, which are things that are not available to paper based notarizations.

In Virginia the case of an electronic notarization, \\"satisfactory evidence of identity\\" may be based on video and audio conference technology, in accordance with the standards for electronic video and audio communications set out in subdivisions B 1, B 2, and B 3, that permits the notary to communicate with and identify the principal at the time of the notarial act, provided that such identification is confirmed by (a) personal knowledge, (b) an antecedent in-person identity proofing process in accordance with the specifications of the Federal Bridge Certification Authority, or (c) a valid digital certificate accessed by biometric data or by use of an interoperable personal identity verification card that is designed, issued, and managed in accordance with the specifications published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and in Federal Information Processing Standards.

Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770 (1984), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a state could assert personal jurisdiction over the publisher of a national magazine which published an allegedly defamatory article about a resident of another state, and where the magazine had wide circulation in that state.. Facts Keeton was a case for defamation brought by Kathy Keeton, a New York resident and publisher of Penthouse magazine, against the nationally distributed Hustler magazine. The plaintiff chose to bring the case in New Hampshire, even though the plaintiff was not a resident there, because New Hampshire allowed six years to bring suit under that state's statute of limitations, which is longer than any other state. Also, New Hampshire's \\"Single Publication Rule\\" could increase the amount of damages the plaintiff could collect by accounting for publication in all 50 states. Issue The issue was whether the federal court had personal jurisdiction if the case was brought in New Hampshire, by a plaintiff from a foreign state against a nationally circulated magazine. Opinion of the Court The U.S. Supreme Court upheld personal jurisdiction, stating that the plaintiff in a case had never been required to have \\"minimum contacts\\" in a state to bring suit in that state and since the magazine did conduct business within the state of New Hampshire. Other developments Keeton was later awarded a $2 million judgment by a New Hampshire jury. This case was decided at the same time as Calder v. Jones, which held that a state had personal jurisdiction over author or editor of an article published in a magazine widely circulated in the state the case was brought, if the claim brought was that the article was libelous about activities in the state by a resident of state.. Like Keeton, Rehnquist authored a unanimous decision there. However, key differences between the cases were that Calder involved a plaintiff suing in her state of residence and she was suing the author and editor involved in the piece in addition to the newspaper itself, while Keeton involved a plaintiff suing only the magazine itself.

Another mount can be seen at the top of the cliff. Fort Funston is a former harbor defense installation located in the southwestern corner of San Francisco. Formerly known as the Lake Merced Military Reservation, the fort is now a protected area within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA). It was named in honor of Frederick N. Funston (1865‚Äì1917), a Major General in the United States Army with strong connections to San Francisco, and included several artillery batteries. The fort is located on Skyline Boulevard at John Muir Drive, west of Lake Merced. The Fort was constructed upon windswept headlands along the Pacific coast and Ocean Beach below, above steep sandstone cliffs that provide a nesting habitat for a colony of bank swallows (Riparia riparia). The last remnants of a sand dune ecosystem that once covered the western half of San Francisco grows along the top of the headlands, with trailheads forming part of the California Coastal Trail that runs through San Francisco County.The Coastal Trail is temporarily closed due to erosion. History The land was acquired by the federal government in 1900 as the Lake Merced Military Reservation, originally intended to accommodate two 12-inch coast defense mortar batteries in the Coast Defenses of San Francisco (later Harbor Defenses). However, nothing significant was built there until after the American entry into World War I in early 1917. The fort, renamed for Major General Frederick Funston shortly after his death in 1917, began to take shape during World War I, with the construction of a parade ground, barracks and a series of coastal batteries. These were Battery Howe with four 12-inch mortars and Battery Bruff with two 5-inch M1900 guns on pedestal mounts. These weapons were relocated from Batteries McKinnon and Sherwood at Fort Winfield Scott, adjacent to the Presidio.Fort Funston at FortWiki.comBerhow, p. 217 Battery Howe was named for Walter Howe, a general and veteran of the Indian wars who died in 1915. Battery Bruff was named after Lawrence Bruff, an Ordnance Corps colonel and instructor at West Point who died in 1911. In 1920 Battery Bruff was disarmed due to a withdrawal from Army service of the 5-inch gun. In the early 1920s, Anti-aircraft Battery No. 5 of three 3-inch guns was built at the fort.Fort Funston at American Forts Network Following World War I, the Washington Naval Treaty of 1923 caused the cancellation of numerous battleships and battlecruisers building and planned for the US Navy. Some of the guns intended for these ships were made available to the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps to defend key ports against a potential naval attack. However, only a few of these weapons were emplaced prior to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. In 1936-1939 Battery Davis was built at Fort Funston, housing two 16-inch Mark 2 Navy guns. These 143-ton guns were moved on railroad cars in 1937 from Mare Island Naval Shipyard to Southern Pacific's Ocean View Station. This was the prototype US 16-inch battery for casemating against air attack, which was adopted for almost all US 16-inch batteries built during the war and retrofitted to most pre-war batteries of this type. It was also the prototype for the Army's M2 carriage; previous ex-Navy 16-inch guns had used a modified M1919 carriage designed for the 16-inch gun M1919.Berhow, p. 227 Battery Davis was named for Major General Richmond P. Davis, a Coast Artillery officer who served in France in World War I, retired in 1929 and died in 1937.Richmond P. Davis biography at NCpedia.org Also, an unnamed battery of four 155 mm guns on concrete \\"Panama mounts\\" was built at the fort circa 1938. In 1940 Battery Davis was joined by Battery Townsley at Fort Cronkhite. A third 16-inch battery, Battery 129 (also called \\"Construction 129\\") at Fort Barry, was built for the San Francisco area during World War II but not completed or armed. Four additional 155 mm guns on Panama mounts were emplaced as Battery Bluff. Also, four 40 mm Bofors gun batteries were placed around the fort. From December 1941 through April 1944 Fort Funston's garrison included elements of the 18th Coast Artillery Regiment.Gaines, William C., Coast Artillery Organizational History, 1917-1950, Coast Defense Journal, vol. 23, issue 2, pp. 12-13 The gun batteries were declared obsolete shortly after World War II, but a 90 mm anti- aircraft gun battery was on the site 1953-57 during the Cold War. Fort Funston later became a Nike missile launch site, hosting sites SF-59L (now the parking lot) and SF-61 from 1956 to 1963. The fort was inactivated in 1963 and eventually transferred to the National Park Service to be administered as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. At some point Batteries Howe and Bruff were demolished, while the Panama mounts have either been destroyed by erosion or buried. Features The area is covered with a network of trails suitable for hiking or horseback riding. There are two Dutch sand ladders that extend down the dunes to the beach. The beach is known for its magnetic sand and strong currents, discouraging swimming. Fort Funston is a popular dog park and the only park in the GGNRA that allows off-leash dogs. The strong, steady winds make the cliffs overlooking the beach a popular site for hang gliding. The gliding is rated intermediate difficulty (Level III). Additionally, the world record for the farthest thrown object was set here in 2003 by Erin Hemmings, who threw an Aerobie flying ring 1,333 feet.\\"World record toss\\". Fort Bragg Advocate-News.

A contestant had to hit the Big Bank space and answer a question correctly to take all cash and prizes in the bank. Round 2 There are four questions in the question round, which is faithful to the 2002-03 US game. A player can earn a maximum of twelve spins in a question round (by being the first to buzz in on all four questions, and answering all four correctly), and the maximum for all three would be 20. Round 3 The second and final round board has much higher values ranging from P1,250 to P125,000, and is also added with special prizes by the sponsors of the show. Their value is PHP60,000 - P50,000 cash and P10,000 worth of the sponsor's product (now P100,000 to P150,000). If two or all three players were tied, the player with the fewest spins went first; if they were tied for that as well, the player to the hosts' left went first. The Double Whammy space is marked with two Whammies. A player who hit the Double Whammy space would also have mischief on the player, although this version had more slime and pies rather than various objects related to United States version. A player who hits the Double Whammy space is only charged one Whammy. As is the case with the franchise, four Whammies eliminates a player from the game.

The name Castlewarden appears to be derived from Warinus, Abbott of St Thomas‚Äô Abbey in 1268 - Castellum Warin (Latin). Adam de Hereford had bestowed the lands on the Abbey of St Thomas, along with Wochtred (Oughter Ard) after being given large territories of land by Strongow.

He was a son of John Leche of Ghattisworth, esq. and Lucy de L‚ÄôLeche. The church was vacated by the early 17th century. The castle remained in good repair until the 18th century. Medieval Landmarks Castlewarden House, which now forms the main building of Castlewarden Golf Club , its medieval earthwork complex a motte and bailey and a rectangular enclosure are all listed monuments under the Kildare development plan. The earliest evidence of human habitation in the area was the discovery of a flint dated to 4800-3600BC, at Castlewarden below Oughter Ard Hill, a rare find on a dryland location. Castlewarden hill is an ancient site associated with the 10 U√≠ D√∫nchada kings of Leinster between 750 and 1050, whose inauguration took place on nearby Lyons Hill. Calendar and Civil Paper References Stephen Creman was Vicar of Uachtar √Ård and Castlewarden in 1541, where the church chancel was said to be ‚Äúin need of repair.‚ÄùThe church had disappeared by the early 17th century although the site and that of a holy well can still be identified. The Castle was burned by order of LJs William Parsons and John Borlase in 1641.

The failure of the siege saved the Empire from collapse, and, combined with other victories achieved by Emperor Heraclius (r. 610‚Äì641) the previous year and in 627, enabled Byzantium to regain its territories and end the destructive Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars by enforcing a treaty with borders status quo c. 590. Background In 602, Phocas overthrew Emperor Maurice (r. 582‚Äì602). According to the later sources, his reign was marked by atrocities and administrative incompetence. The new emperor's mismanagement left the Byzantine Empire vulnerable and unstable when the Sassanid king Khosrau II (r. 590‚Äì628) invaded, using the coup as a pretext for war as Khosrau II was personally close to Maurice, who helped him return his throne after Bahram Chobin's revolt. Initially, the Sassanid invasion was successful, with the Byzantines being driven into the Anatolian heartland. Later, Phocas was overthrown by the son of the then Exarch of Carthage, Heraclius. Heraclius started active warfare and personally lead his army into the battle, but the situation deteriorated and the Byzantine empire lost all its Near East possessions along Egypt. Despite several counter-offensives into Mesopotamia, Heraclius was unable to stop his Persian enemies from laying siege to his capital where from Chalcedon they were able to launch their attack. From 14‚Äì15 May 626, riots in Constantinople against John Seismos occurred because he wanted to cancel the bread rations of the scholae or imperial guards and raise the cost of bread from 3 to 8 follis. He did this to conserve government resources, but he was removed. However, there were further disturbances in the city. Siege The Siege of Constantinople in 626 depicted on the murals of the Moldovi»õa Monastery, Romania Khosrau, seeing that a decisive counterattack was needed to defeat the Byzantines, recruited two new armies from all the able men, including foreigners. Shahin was entrusted with 50,000 men and stayed in Mesopotamia and Armenia to prevent Heraclius from invading Persia; a smaller army under Shahrbaraz slipped through Heraclius' flanks and bee-lined for Chalcedon across the Bosphorus from Constantinople. Khosrau also coordinated with the Khagan of the Avars so as to launch a coordinated attack on Constantinople from both European and Asiatic sides. The Persian army stationed themselves at Chalcedon, while the Avars placed themselves on the European side of Constantinople and probably destroyed the Aqueduct of Valens. Because of the Byzantine navy's control of the Bosphorus strait, however, the Persians could not send troops to the European side to aid their ally. This reduced the effectiveness of the siege, because the Persians were experts in siege warfare. Furthermore, the Persians and Avars had difficulties communicating across the guarded Bosphorus‚Äîthough undoubtedly, there was some communication between the two forces. The defense of Constantinople was under the command of Patriarch Sergius and the patrician Bonus. Upon hearing the news, Heraclius split his army into three parts; although he judged that the capital was relatively safe, he still sent some reinforcements to Constantinople to boost the morale of the defenders. Another part of the army was under the command of his brother Theodore and was sent to deal with Shahin, while the third and smallest part would remain under his own control, intending to raid the Persian heartland. On 29 June 626, a coordinated assault on the walls began. Inside the walls, some 12,000 well-trained Byzantine cavalry troops (presumably dismounted) defended the city against the forces of some 80,000 Avars and Sclaveni (Slavs, then submitted to Avars), who were determined to remove all Roman imperial rule over Europe.. However, it was only when the Avars began moving forward heavy siege equipment towards the Theodosian Walls that their intention to lay a siege became clear. Despite continuous bombardment for a month, morale was high inside the walls of Constantinople because of Patriarch Sergius' religious fervor and his processions along the wall with an icon, which could be the icon of the Virgin Mary, inspiring the belief that the Byzantines were under divine protection. Furthermore, the patriarch's cries for religious zeal among the peasantry around Constantinople was made ever more effective by the fact that they were facing heathens. Consequently, every assault became a doomed effort. When the Avar-Slavic fleet and the Persian fleet were sunk in two different naval engagements, the attackers panicked and fled, abandoning the siege, apparently under the belief that divine intervention had won the day for Byzantium. On 7 August, a fleet of Persian rafts ferrying troops across the Bosphorus were surrounded and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the Golden Horn, while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus' galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from 6 August to the 7th also failed. With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to seriously threaten Constantinople again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over. In thanks for the lifting of the siege and the supposed divine protection of the Virgin Mary, a new proemium for the celebrated Akathist Hymn was written by an unknown author, possibly Patriarch Sergius or George of Pisidia. Aftermath Map of the environs of Constantinople in Byzantine times The loss in the siege came just after news had reached them of yet another Byzantine victory, where Heraclius's brother Theodore scored well against the Persian general Shahin. Furthermore, after the emperor showed Shahrbaraz intercepted letters from Khosrau ordering the Persian general's death, the latter switched to Heraclius' side. Shahrbaraz then moved his army to northern Syria, where he could easily decide to support either Khosrau or Heraclius at a moment's notice. Still, with the neutralization of Khosrau's most skilled general, Heraclius deprived his enemy of some of his best and most experienced troops, while securing his flanks prior to his invasion of Persia. In the next year, Heraclius led an invasion into Mesopotamia once again, defeating another Persian army at Nineveh. Afterwards, he marched on to Ctesiphon where anarchy reigned allowing Heraclius to extract ever more favorable terms as one Persian king was overthrown by another. Eventually, the Persians were obliged to withdraw all armed forces and return Egypt, the Levant and whatever imperial territories of Mesopotamia and Armenia were in Roman hands at the time of an earlier peace treaty in c. 595. The war was over; neither the Persians nor the Byzantines would cross swords again until the Arab-Islamic invasion broke the power of both empires. Assessment The siege of 626 failed because the Avars did not have the patience or technology to conquer the city. Though the Persians were experts in siege warfare, the walls of Constantinople proved to defend easily against the siege towers and engines, amongst the reasons being that the former could not move their siege equipment to the European side of the Bosphorus (which was heavily guarded), where their Avar and Slavic allies were initially stationed. Furthermore, the Persians and Slavs did not have a strong enough navy to ignore the sea walls and establish a channel of communication. The lack of supplies for the Avars eventually caused them to abandon the siege.

Ochs was inspired to write \\"Outside of a Small Circle of Friends\\" by the case of Kitty Genovese, who was stabbed to death on March 13, 1964, outside her home in Queens, New York, while dozens of her neighbors reportedly ignored her cries for help. The song's refrain, and its title, came from a conversation Ochs had with an acquaintance: > [It] came out of a chance remark, late at night at a coffeehouse. I was > talking to a Canadian guy, and he said, \\"Oh, I'm sure it wouldn't interest > anybody outside of a small circle of friends.\\" I said, \\"What'd you say?\\" and > I picked up a guitar and ZOOM, the chords came right away. The lyrics of \\"Outside of a Small Circle of Friends\\" condemn social apathy by relating different situations that should demand action on the part of the narrator, but in each case the narrator evades responsibility by giving a mundane excuse, and invariably concludes that \\"I'm sure it wouldn't interest anybody outside of a small circle of friends\\". The five scenarios include a woman who's being stabbed outside the window, an automobile accident that has left a car hanging on a cliff, the terrible living conditions in the city's ghetto, a magazine publisher who's been fined for publishing pornography, and a friend who's been arrested for smoking marijuana and sentenced to thirty years in prison. The song's arrangement provides a sharp contrast to its lyrics. For ironic effect Ochs wanted an upbeat arrangement. Producer Larry Marks and pianist Lincoln Mayorga produced an arrangement that is almost as memorable as the lyrics of the song. A decade after the song was recorded, Marks said: > The arrangement added to the irony of the whole song. Tacky piano played by > Lincoln and a banjo and small rhythm section, nothing more. It's almost like > a saloon song you shouldn't pay any attention to, and the lyric means > practically everything in the world. In 2001, an author remarked that the recording \\"pitted a disturbing lyric about murder and social irresponsibility against a backing of insanely cheerful banjo and a honky-tonk piano\\". Single versions A&M; Records released \\"Outside of a Small Circle of Friends\\" as a single in 1967. Reviews were generally positive. Billboard wrote that the record \\"should put folkster Ochs high on the Hot 100\\" and the Cleveland Press said that if radio stations \\"give it a chance, this will be a giant record\\". Rolling Stone gave the single a mixed review. The single got a good deal of airplay, especially on FM radio. Sales were fairly good. In Los Angeles, the song reached No. 20. It was No. 119 on Billboard's national \\"Hot Prospect\\" listing. As the song's popularity grew, some radio station managers began to object to the lyrics of the fifth verse of \\"Outside of a Small Circle of Friends\\", which said that \\"smoking marijuana is more fun than drinking beer\\". Without considering the irony of the lyrics, managers began to complain to A&M.; A&M; responded by releasing two alternate versions of the single. One version included the lyrics \\"smoking [four instrumental notes remain here] is more fun than drinking beer\\". Another removed the controversial verse altogether. Still, the damage had been done. Record sales suffered and the single lost its momentum. It never advanced further up the charts. Cover versions \\"Outside of a Small Circle of Friends\\" has been covered by several performers, including Eugene Chadbourne, Dave Van Ronk and Kind Of Like Spitting.

It was previously regarded as the northern subspecies of the spotted eagle-owl (Bubo africanus). Lake Bogoria - Kenya Description This species is about long and weighs about . Like the spotted eagle-owl, the greyish eagle-owl has mottled dark brown, buff, and white upperparts and finely barred (vermiculated) underparts giving a greyish-brown appearance. It differs from the spotted eagle-owl in having dark brown (not yellow) eyes and a brownish facial disk marked with a heavy brown circle around each eye. It also has morphological differences, such as being lighter though about the same length and having shorter tarsi. Voice As the greyish eagle-owl was considered the northern form of the spotted eagle-owl until recently their vocalisations have not been well studied. The call of the male recorded in West Africa consisted of two clear syllables and has been rendered as \\"koo-whoo\\" where the \\"koo\\" part is rather explosive and the \\"whoo\\" is somewhat downward inflected, lower pitched and extended. This call is made every few seconds and is thus not similar to that of the spotted eagle-owl. Distribution and habitat It is found in the northern part of Sub-Saharan Africa from Mauritania and Liberia east to Sudan and Somalia. Its habitats include dry rocky deserts and open savannah, as well as lowland forests in Somalia. Biology Roosts during the day hidden and sites used vary from rocky natural sites such as cliff crevices and boulders to bushes and trees to man-made sites. It feeds on larger insects and other large arthropods as well as vertebrates. It usually hunts from a perch, using a sit and wait technique, but may also hawk insects and sometimes bats in flight. The breeding biology is probably similar to the spotted eagle-owl. It lays 2-3 eggs in a scrape on the ground or among rocks or in a sheltered cliff site, although it will sometimes reuse the old platform-like nests of larger birds in trees. Taxonomic note It is closely related to the spotted eagle- owl, of which is it sometimes considered the northern subspecies, Bubo africanus cinerascens. In the area of overlap with the spotted eagle-owl in Kenya and the Horn of Africa, the two species are not known to interbreed.

It was patented in Japan by Sumitomo in 1972 and its medical use remains mostly confined to that country. Its muscle relaxant properties are approximately equivalent to those of diazepam - however, it has more powerful sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects and is around four times more potent by weight compared to diazepam. It is longer acting than diazepam due to its long-acting active metabolites, which contribute significantly to its effects. Its principal active metabolite is n-desalkylflurazepam, also known as norflurazepam, which is also a principal metabolite of flurazepam (trade name Dalmane). Flutoprazepam is typically used for the treatment of severe insomnia and may also be used for treating stomach ulcers. Flutoprazepam does not fall under the international Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, and is currently unscheduled in the United States. *In Singapore, flutoprazepam is a Class C-Schedule II drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act. *In Thailand, flutoprazepam is a Schedule III psychotropic substance. *In Hong Kong, flutoprazepam is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Flutoprazepam can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined $10000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time.

The association and its members lead and support global efforts to facilitate the peaceful and democratic development of Latvia by promoting understanding and support for Latvia through informational efforts mainly in the United States of America. In 1961, the ALA participated as a co-founder of the Joint Baltic American National Committee in cooperation with the Estonian American National Council and the Lithuanian American National Council . The ALA is also a member of the World Federation of Free Latvians (WFFL) and contributes 4 of WFFL's 16 board members. ALA has over 160 member organizations, and some 6,000 individual members, representing over 100,000 people of Latvian descent living in the United States. ALA headquarters are located in Rockville, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Some of the 160 ALA member organizations include the cultural organization Tilts, the Washington D.C. Latvian Lutheran Church, and the Latvian Welfare Association Daugavas Vanagi New York branch. The ALA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, tax exempt educational and cultural organization registered as a private and voluntary organization with the U.S. Agency for International Development. ALA is organized into 4 key program areas as is reported on the annual IRS Form 990 depicting the operations of non-profit organizations. The ALA supports cultural activities and facilitates cooperation within the Latvian American community, for example, organizing annual educational and cultural trips to Latvia. These programs help educate and inform the Latvian American Community about events and people in Latvia. The goals of the ALA are to promote the study of Latvian language, history and culture. The ALA is supplying Latvian schools in the United States with books and teaching materials, while also helping newly arrived Latvian immigrants to adjust to life in the United States and providing humanitarian aid to people in Latvia.  History  The complete history of the ALA has been compiled in two books. The first book, ALA 35, 1951-1986 by former members Bruno Albats (former ALA General Secretary) and Visvaldis Varnesis Klƒ´ve (former President of the ALA) and was published in 1986. The second book, ALA 1986-2000 was written and published in 2000 by Anita Tƒìrauda (former ALA General Secretary) and Irƒìne Karule. These books provide an overview of the association and its founding process. As documented through the personal experiences of the authors, the initiator of the concept of a unified voice for the Latvian American community was the Latvian Ambassador to the United States (1948-1953), J≈´lijs Feldmanis. On April 15, 1950, 79 representatives some of the main centers of the Latvian diaspora in the US, such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Detroit etc., met to address the initiative. The representatives decided: (1) to create a nation-wide Latvian organization; (2) to define the organization's overall goals; and (3) to develop the organization's basic structure. The representatives established an organizing committee to draw up the organization's statutes and to call for a congress of delegates to formally establish the ALA. Following the meeting in April 1950, Ambassador Feldmanis continued to work with the representatives of the main Latvian diaspora centers to create a unified Latvian organization. Numerous meetings were held in the various communities (most importantly, May 24, 1950, in Philadelphia and August 5, 1950, in New York) to gain local support and to finalise the founding statutes. Mr. Feldmanis repeatedly stated that the main goal of the association will be the fight for Latvia's freedom. 115 delegates participated at the founding congress. They represented local Latvian organizations and churches in the U.S. with 11,260 members in total. J≈´lijs Feldmanis was elected to lead the congress. After his proposal that the founding statutes be accepted without changes, the founding delegates agreed, officially establishing the ALA.

Cheryl Lynn, shortly before her death, reportedly told a neighbor of her grandparents that she was afraid of her mother.Rule, Ann. 1987. Small Sacrifices. New York, Signet. 120-121, 129-130, 186-187 Shootings On May 19, 1983, Downs shot her three children and drove them in a blood-spattered car to McKenzie-Willamette Hospital. Upon arrival, Cheryl (aged 7) was already dead, Danny (aged 3) was paralyzed from the waist down, and Christie (aged 8) had suffered a disabling stroke. Downs herself had been shot in the left forearm. She claimed she was carjacked on a rural road near Springfield, Oregon, by a strange man who shot her and the children. However, investigators and hospital workers became suspicious because they decided her manner was too calm for a person who had experienced such a traumatic event. She also made a number of statements that both police and hospital workers considered highly inappropriate. Suspicions heightened when Downs, upon arrival at the hospital to visit her children, phoned Robert Knickerbocker, a married man and former coworker in Arizona with whom she had been having an extramarital affair. The forensic evidence did not match her story; there was no blood spatter on the driver's side of the car, nor was there any gunpowder residue on the driver's door or on the interior door panel. Knickerbocker also reported to police that Downs had stalked him and seemed willing to kill his wife if it meant that she could have him to herself; he stated that he was relieved that she had left for Oregon and that he was able to reconcile with his wife. Downs did not disclose to police that she owned a .22 caliber handgun, but both Steve Downs and Knickerbocker informed them that she did. Investigators later discovered Downs bought the handgun in Arizona. While they were unable to find the actual weapon, they found unfired casings in her home with extractor markings from the murder weapon. Most damaging, witnesses saw her car being driven very slowly toward the hospital at an estimated speed of , contradicting her claim that she drove to the hospital at high speed after the shooting. Based on this and additional evidence, Downs was arrested on February 28, 1984, nine months after the shooting, and charged with one count of murder and two counts each of attempted murder and criminal assault. Prosecution Prosecutors argued that Downs shot her children to be free of them so she could continue her affair with Knickerbocker, as she claimed that he let it be known that he did not want children in his life. Much of the case against her rested on the testimony of her surviving daughter, Christie, who, once she recovered her ability to speak, described how her mother shot all three children while parked at the side of the road and then shot herself in the arm. Christie was eight years old at the time of the murder and nine years old at the time of the trial. Downs was convicted on all charges on June 17, 1984, and sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years. She was required to serve 25 years before being considered for parole. Psychiatrists diagnosed her with narcissistic, histrionic and antisocial personality disorders.Rule, pp. 440-445 Most of her sentence is to be served consecutively. The judge made it clear that he did not intend for Downs to ever be free again. Aftermath Downs' two surviving children eventually went to live with the lead prosecutor on the case, Fred Hugi. He and his wife Joanne adopted them in 1986. Prior to her arrest, Downs became pregnant with a fifth child and gave birth to a girl, whom she named Amy Elizabeth, a month after her 1984 trial. Ten days before Downs' sentencing, Amy was seized by the State of Oregon and adopted by Chris and Jackie Babcock, who named her Rebecca. As an adult, Rebecca appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and ABC's 20/20 discussing how she feels about her biological mother. She wrote to Downs in her younger years and has stated that she regrets it, regarding her mother as \\"a monster.\\" Downs was incarcerated at the Oregon Women's Correctional Center in Salem. She escaped on July 11, 1987, and was recaptured just a few blocks from the prison on July 21. She received an additional five-year sentence for the escape. After her recapture, Downs was transferred to the New Jersey Department of Corrections Clinton Correctional Facility for Women after heavy lobbying from Hugi. The Salem prison was located 66 miles from Hugi's home in Springfield; during her ten days of freedom, Hugi had feared that Downs would attempt to travel there in hopes of contacting Christie and Danny. Despite significant security upgrades at the women's facility after the escape, state officials accepted Hugi's argument that the risk of harm to Christie and Danny in the event of another escape was too great for Downs to remain incarcerated in Oregon. In 1994, after serving ten years, Downs was transferred to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. While in prison, she has earned an associate degree in General Studies. In 2010, she was located in the Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla, California, but transferred out when the facility was converted to an all-male institution in 2013. Author Ann Rule wrote the book Small Sacrifices (1987) detailing Downs' life and murder trial. The book documents accounts by friends, acquaintances, neighbors, and her surviving daughter Christie, who question the quality of her parenting.Rule, pp. 129-136, 155, 213 A made-for-TV movie also titled Small Sacrifices, starring Farrah Fawcett as Downs, aired on ABC in 1989. Parole hearing Downs' sentence meant she could not be considered for parole until 2009. Under Oregon law at the time, as a dangerous offender, Downs would have been eligible for a parole hearing every two years until she is released or dies in prison. In her first application for parole in 2008, Downs reaffirmed her innocence. \\"Over the years,\\" she said, \\"I have told you and the rest of the world that a man shot me and my children. I have never changed my story.\\" Her first parole hearing was on December 9, 2008. Lane County District Attorney Douglas Harcleroad wrote to the parole board, \\"Downs continues to fail to demonstrate any honest insight into her criminal behavior...even after her convictions, she continues to fabricate new versions of events under which the crimes occurred.\\" He also wrote that \\"she alternately refers to her assailants as a bushy-haired stranger, two men wearing ski masks or drug dealers and corrupt law enforcement officials.\\" Downs participated in the hearing from the Valley State Prison for Women. She was not permitted a statement, but answered questions from the parole board. After three hours of interviews and thirty minutes of deliberation, she was denied parole. Downs faced her second parole hearing on December 10, 2010. She was denied parole and, under a new law, will not be eligible for parole for another ten years. She will have to wait to apply for parole until 2020, when she will be 65 years old.

He is a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Early life and education Meir Wilchek was born in Warsaw, Poland, scion of a rabbinical family. During the Holocaust, he escaped from the German occupied territories to the territories occupied by Russia, and was transferred to Siberia, while his father, who served as a community rabbi in Warsaw, was killed in Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp. He survived, and immigrated to Israel in 1949 with his mother and sister. He graduated with B.Sc. in chemistry from Bar Ilan university and Ph.D. in biochemistry from the Weizmann Institute of Science. Wilchek has published over 400 scientific papers, and consulted various biotech companies. He was also in the party list of Mafdal and Meimad for the Knesset. Scientific contributions Meir Wilchek is known for his research in the field of biorecognition or affinity phenomenon, and its various application, e.g. for affinity chromatography, affinity labeling, affinity therapy, and the avidin-biotin system. The Avidin-biotin complex is the highest affinity interaction in nature, and its utilization to biochemistry integrates all of the former approaches. Other contributions include conversion of serines to cysteines, and was the first to prove experimentally the equation of Forster on dependence of energy transfer on distance, an approach known today as FRET. He also studied the fine structure of these chromophores using circular dichroism. More recently, he participated in a research team who studied how garlic works at the molecular level, thanks to a unique biotechnological procedure for producing large quantities of pure allicin, garlic's main biologically active component. Affinity chromatography Affinity chromatography is a method of separating biochemical mixtures, based on a highly specific biologic interaction such as that between antigen and antibody, enzyme and substrate, or receptor and ligand. The method was subsequently adopted for a variety of other techniques. Specific uses of affinity chromatography include antibody affinity, Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and purification of recombinant proteins - possibly the most common use of the method. To purify, proteins are tagged e.g. using His-tags or GST (glutathione-S-transferase) tags, which can be recognized by a metal ion ligand, such as imidazole. In 1971, Wilchek and colleagues applied this method to show that protein kinase is composed of regulatory and catalytic subunits. In 1972, Wilchek showed that the method can be used to remove toxic compounds from blood, as exemplified by the removal of heme peptides from blood using immobilized human serum albumin, thus laying the grounds for modern hemoperfusion Affinity labeling Affinity label is a molecule that is similar in structure to a particular substrate for a specific enzyme. It is considered to be a class of irreversible inhibitors. These molecules covalently modify active site residues in order to elucidate the structure of the active site. Using this method, Wilchek collaborated with a team who proved that the binding site of antibodies lies in the Fv portion of the molecule and involves three hypervariable sites, today called the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Affinity therapy Affinity therapy, or immunotoxins is a biorecognition-based approach to selectively deliver a cytotoxic drug or toxin to a specific target cell. The field of affinity therapy was pioneered by Wilchek, together with Michael Sela, Ester Hurwitz, and Ruth Arnon. In 1975, they applied drug-conjugated antibodies for the targeted delivery of cytotoxic compounds to cancer cells. They also demonstrated the advantage of having a polymeric spacer between the antibody and the drug and showed the effectiveness of conjugating simple polymers such as dextran for drug delivery and targeting. This approach was later adopted by others and eventually led to efficient treatment of human breast cancer by recombinant humanized anti-HER2 antibody (Herceptin) in a mixture with paclitaxel and doxorubicin. In 2003, Wilchek collaborated in a team who introduced a system based on antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT), using antibody-conjugated alliinase to produce a cytotoxic agent, allicin, in situ (at the site) of the cancer The avidin-biotin system The avidin‚Äìbiotin system is a technique for studying the interaction between two biomolecules in an indirect manner, as follows: Biotin is chemically coupled to a binder molecule (e.g., a protein, DNA, hormone, etc.) without disturbing the interaction with its target molecule; avidin is then used to ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù between the biotinylated binder and a reporter molecule or probe. This allows for a variety of tasks, including localization and identification of the binder or target molecule. Consequently, the avidin-biotin system can frequently replace radioactive probes. Together with Ed Bayer, Wilchek established the Avidin-biotin system as a powerful tool in biological sciences. Early in the 1970s, they exploited Avidin as a probe and developed new methods and reagents to biotinylate antibodies and other biomolecules. Today, the system is applied in research and diagnostics as well as medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Examples include western blot, ELISA, ELISPOT and pull-down assays. More recently, Wilchek participated in structural studies of the avidin‚Äìbiotin complex, to characterize the unique properties of this strong interaction. The studies have culminated in the determination of the 3D structure of the avidin‚Äìbiotin complex by X-ray crystallography, which aids in the design of specific artificial recognition sites.

It is under the Academy of Clermont-Ferrand. It is the head of PRES Clermont Universit√© consortium; PRES being the league of elite universities of France. Hence, the university is constantly ranked as a leading academic institution by various French academicians and newspapers, most notably Le Figaro. The Universit√© d‚ÄôAuvergne was founded in 1519 and as such in 1806 as a medical school. Soon the university established itself as a premier center for medical studies, and continues to do so for over 100 years. It became the Universit√© d‚ÄôAuvergne Clermont-Ferrand 1 on March 16, 1976. The university has a status of EPSCSP, which is the highest French accreditation. This leads to high emphasis over the professional and research areas of the university. A comprehensive institution, it offers more than 60 national degrees in Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Law and Forensics, Economics and Politics, Management and Administration, and Technology. On 1 January 2017, the university became part of the University Clermont Auvergne. History The first university existed between the 12th century and the end of the 15th century to Billom, near Clermont, with up to students. At the beginning of the 16th century, the Bishop of Clermont, Thomas Duprat installed a university library. The King established the University in February 1519, but following protests by Charles III of Bourbon and the University of Paris, it was closed in 1520. In 1681, the King authorized the creation of a medical college in Clermont. The Faculty of Arts was founded in 1808, inaugurated in May 1810 in the hospital Charitains (demolished in 1906), but it is improvised from the Restoration in September 1815. During the Second World War, the university hosted Clermont students and professors from the University of Strasbourg, fleeing the German occupation. The university was also severely affected: On 25 November 1943, the buildings were surrounded by the Gestapo, with orders to arrest deans, students and those from Alsace-Lorraine, and they all could be related to the resistance. Nearly 50 students and teachers were arrested and Paul Collomp, a professor of the faculty of Literature, was even killed by a gunshot. Large differences were created in particular political interventions in the implementation of the Reform of 1969 (Act Faure), but it was not until 1976 that the University Clermont only split into two separate institutions, Clermont II retrieving Literature, the Humanities and the Applied Sciences, the Natural Science and Technology, University Clermont I keeping it on the Law, Economics, the Medical and IUT. Although later on, both the universities developed their courses and were acclaimed prestige for their students and courses. After the split, the relations between the two universities have been timid or nonexistent, but the situation has gradually improved. Today the two institutions have significantly come closer together and collaborate on some courses. The creation of PRES Clermont Universit√© in May 2008 by the University of Auvergne, the Blaise Pascal University, the National School of Agricultural Engineers from Clermont-Ferrand (ENITA), the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure of Chemistry of Clermont Ferrand (ENSCCF) and the French Institute of Advanced Mechanics (IFMA) is dedicated to ensuring the visibility and attractiveness of the university campus Clermont internationally. Components With 15,000 students, including 3,000 foreign students, it consists of five faculties and 3 institutes: *Faculty of Law and Political Science at Clermont-Ferrand *Faculty of Economics and Management *Faculty of Medicine *Faculty of Pharmacy *Faculty of Dental Surgery *IUT (Engineering Sciences, Computer Networks, Multimedia, Biology, Management) *IUP \\"Management and Business Management\\" *Institute of Preparation for General Administration (IPAG) Research Centers With twenty-three laboratories as principal four UMR (2 INSERM, CNRS 1, 1 INRA), the potential for research is mainly focused on Life sciences and Health (61.3%). The tertiary sector, Economics-Management accounts for 34.4% and the Technology sector 4.3%. In 2004, the university saw a rapid improvement in the framework and courses were significantly altered to higher standards, particularly in fields of Medicine, Law and Economics- Management. A Bilingual Bachelor program in Business-Management program (French: Licence Bilingue Economie-Gestion) was launched and receives presently the highest funding in the Economics Department. It has developed a consortium with HEC Paris, University Paris X, Carnegie Mellon University and Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Australia. It shall begin from 2011. The Economics-Management department has tie ups for student internships with various prestigious institutions, namely UNESCO and in Saint-Etienne, which houses the headquarters of various French and international companies.

Helping Malayalam Take the Digital Leap ‚Äì The New Indian Express Input methods 150px Full size keyboards With the advent of Unicode inputting Indic text on computer has become very easy. A number of methods exist for this purpose, but the main ones are:- =InScript= Inscript is the standard keyboard for Indian languages. Developed by C-DAC and standardized by Government of India. Nowadays it comes inbuilt in all major operating systems including Microsoft Windows (2000, XP, Vista, 7), Linux and Macintosh. =Phonetic transliteration= This is a typing method in which, for instance, the user types text in an Indian language using Roman characters and it is phonetically converted to equivalent text in Indian script in real time. This type of conversion is done by phonetic text editors, word processors and software plugins. Building up on the idea, one can use phonetic IME tools that allow Indic text to be input in any application. Some examples of phonetic transliterators are Xlit, Google Indic Transliteration, BarahaIME, Indic IME, Rupantar, SMC's Indic Keyboard and Microsoft Indic Language Input Tool. SMC's Indic Keyboard has support for as many as 23 languages whereas Google Indic Keyboard only supports 11 Indian languages. They can be broadly classified as: * Fixed transliteration scheme based tools ‚Äì They work using a fixed transliteration scheme to convert text. Some examples are Indic IME, Rupantar and BarahaIME. * Intelligent/Learning based transliteration tools ‚Äì They compare the word with a dictionary and then convert it to the equivalent words in the target language. Some of the popular ones are Google Indic Transliteration, Xlit, Microsoft Indic Language Input Tool and QuillPad. =Remington (typewriter)= This layout was developed when computers had not been invented or deployed with Indic languages, and typewriters were the only means to type text in Indic scripts. Since typewriters were mechanical and could not include a script processor engine, each character had to be placed on the keyboard separately, which resulted in a very complex and difficult to learn keyboard layout. With the advent of Unicode, the Remington layout was added to various typing tools for sake of backward compatibility, so that old typists did not have to learn a new keyboard layout. Nowadays this layout is only used by old typists who are used to this layout due to several years of usage. One tool to include Remington layout is Indic IME. A font that is based on the Remington keyboard layout is Kruti Dev. Another online tool that very closely supports the old Remington keyboard layout using Kruti Dev is the Remington Typing tool. Braille IBus Sharada Braille, which supports seven Indian languages was developed by SMC. Mobile phones with Numeric keyboards Nokia 1108 Hindi Mobile/Hand/cell phone basic models have 12 keys like the plain old telephone keypad. Each key is mapped to 3 or 4 English letters to facilitate data entry in English. For inputting Indian languages with this kind of keypad, there are two ways to do so. First is the Multi-tap Method and second uses visual help from the screen like Panini Keypad. The primary usage is SMS. 140 characters size used for English/Roman languages can be used to accommodate only about 70 language characters when Unicode Proprietary compression is used some times to increase the size of single message for Complex script languages like Hindi. A research study of the available methods and recommendations of proposed standard was released by Broadband Wireless Consortium of India (BWCI). =Transliteration/Phonetic methods= English is used to type in Indian languages. QuillPad IndiSMS =Native methods= In native methods, the letters of the language are displayed on the screen corresponding to the numeral keys based on the probabilities of those letters for that language. Additional letters can be accessed by using a special key. When a word is partially typed, options are presented from which the user can make a selection. Smart phones with Qwerty keyboards Most smart phones have about 35 keys catering primarily to English language. Numerals and some symbols are accessed with a special key called Alt. Indic input methods are yet to evolve for these types of phones, as support of Unicode for rendering is not widely available.

HEPI measures the average relative level in the prices of a fixed market basket of goods and services typically purchased by colleges and universities through current-fund educational and general expenditures, excluding expenditures for research. Educational and general expenditures include the functions of instruction and departmental research, extension and public services, educational programs such as workshops and instructional institutes supported by sponsors outside the institution, student services, general administration and expenses, staff benefits, libraries, and operation and maintenance of the physical plant. Sponsored research, sales and services of education departments, and auxiliary enterprises are not priced by HEPI. The index is calculated on a fiscal year basis ending each June 30, by the Commonfund Institute, a branch of Commonfund, a non-profit organization devoted to the management of college and university endowments.\\" Higher Education's Operating Costs Rose by 3.4% in 2007, Down From Last Year's Rate\\" by Elizabeth Quill, Chronicle of Higher Education August 8, 2007Commonfund Institute News History and current status Throughout the years, Halstead continued to update the HEPI. Since 2005, HEPI has been maintained by the Commonfund Institute, and it relies upon eight separate ‚Äúcost factors‚Äù to construct the overall index. These factors are: faculty salaries, administrative salaries, clerical salaries, service employee salaries, fringe benefits, miscellaneous services, supplies and materials, and utilities. In 2005, Commonfund Institute assumed responsibility for the index and the proprietary model used to calculate HEPI‚Äôs values from Research Associates of Washington, D.C. In 2007, in keeping with its commitment to improving and expanding the index, Commonfund Institute inaugurated two additional HEPI services: HEPI calculated by type of institution for six different categories of public and private colleges and universities, and the monthly release, beginning in January of each year, of a forecast of HEPI for the coming fiscal year end. In 2009, two further improvements were introduced, aligning the estimates and the final HEPI calculation with the July‚ÄìJune academic fiscal year and making available HEPI calculated by region. HEPI forecasts are provided monthly from January through June of each year. The HEPI report is published using the July HEPI figure, which may be subject to a further small adjustment when the last of the underlying data items are finalized in November. Five characteristics HEPI has five critical characteristics that should be kept in mind when using it: # HEPI measures general inflation affecting all colleges and universities in the sector, not any specific institution. # In measuring average prices, HEPI reflects the quality of typically employed commodities. Any institutional departure in real expenditure from these averages represents a quality differential. # HEPI measures price changes for a fixed market basket of goods and services, so it does not account for the budgetary needs of institutions to buy more or better items to meet enrollment expansion, quality improvement, and competition. # The market basket has remained fixed over the years, which means that the index assumes a typical budget weighting of, for example, the number of gallons of fuel oil versus the number of professors. # Specialized indices for specific geographic regions and types of institution are included in the annual HEPI Report, but because the data series for which specialized information is available account for less than half of the factor weightings in the HEPI equation, they are of necessity approximations and should be used accordingly. Methodology=Calculation From 1961-2001, HEPI was based on the price data for 25 budget components organized into eight categories ‚Äì more than 100 items in all. From fiscal year 2002 on, HEPI has been calculated using a regression formula. The weighting of each expenditure category is determined by regression analysis (though it appears as though a sample of just 41 colleges is used) that essentially reports the share of total spending for each category. The heaviest weights accompany faculty and clerical salaries and fringe benefits, reflecting their relatively large share in college and university budgets.‚Äù The regression-based index values are essentially equal to those resulting from complete data. The R-squared value for the regression is .999997809. Regression-calculated HEPI values are not likely to vary from fully compiled values by more than 0.1 parts out of 200.0 or ¬± 0.05%. Enhanced methodology Beginning in 2009, the estimates and the final HEPI calculation were calculated using data series that were entirely aligned with the July‚ÄìJune academic fiscal year. Prior to that, the index had been calculated using data drawn from data series with various monthly endpoints. The resulting timing differences in the underlying data had sometimes led HEPI to seem too high or too low relative to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Adoption of the improved methodology led to a restatement of HEPI for the period 2002-2008. HEPI has useful tools for measuring inflation ‚Äì but they have to be used appropriately: * HEPI is useful as an overall measure of inflation affecting the higher education sector, just as consumers everywhere use the national Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a general measure of family purchasing power. * In an educational context, the CPI is most properly used to adjust faculty and other college and university personnel salaries to dollars of constant purchasing power.

People often want to know the effect of a predictor/explanatory variable X, on a response variable Y. One way to get an estimate for such effects is through regression analysis. Why the name marginal model? In a typical multilevel model, there are level 1 & 2 residuals (R and U variables). The two variables form a joint distribution for the response variable (Y_{ij}). In a marginal model, we collapse over the level 1 & 2 residuals and thus marginalize (see also conditional probability) the joint distribution into a univariate normal distribution. We then fit the marginal model to data. For example, for the following hierarchical model, :level 1: Y_{ij} = \\\\beta_{0j} + R_{ij}, the residual is R_{ij}, and \\\\operatorname{var}(R_{ij}) = \\\\sigma^2 :level 2: \\\\beta_{0j} = \\\\gamma_{00} + U_{0j}, the residual is U_{0j}, and \\\\operatorname{var}(U_{0j}) = \\\\tau_0^2 Thus, the marginal model is, :Y_{ij} \\\\sim N(\\\\gamma_{00},(\\\\tau_0^2+\\\\sigma^2)) This model is what is used to fit to data in order to get regression estimates.

The cuisines best known for their use of goat include African cuisine, Middle Eastern, North African, West African, Indian, Indonesian, Nepali, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Mexican, and Caribbean (Haiti). Cabrito, or baby goat, is a very typical food of Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico; in Italy it is called ‚Äúcapretto‚Äù. Goat has historically been less commonplace in American, Canadian and Northern European cuisines but has become more popular in some niche markets, including those that serve immigrants from Asia and Africa who prefer goat to other meat. the number of goats slaughtered in the United States has doubled every 10 years for three decades, rising to nearly one million annually. While in the past goat meat in the West was confined to ethnic markets, it can now be found in a few upscale restaurants and purveyors, especially in cities such as New York and San Francisco. Brady, Texas has held its Annual World Championship BBQ Goat Cook-Off annually since 1973.Roasted kidGoat meat is savory and less sweet than beef but slightly sweeter than lamb. It can be prepared in a variety of ways, such as being stewed, curried, baked, grilled, barbecued, minced, canned, fried, or made into sausage. Goat jerky is also another popular variety. In Okinawa (Japan), goat meat is served raw in thin slices as yagisashi. On the Indian subcontinent, the rice dish mutton biryani and the mutton curries prepared in parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, use goat meat / khashi (castrated male goat) meat as a primary ingredient to produce a rich taste. Curry goat is a common traditional Indo-Caribbean dish. In Bangladesh, traditional meat dishes like kosha mangsho and rezala are prepared using meat from a khashi, a castrated goat with a meat that has richer taste and a milder, less gamey flavour. In Indonesia, goat meat is popularly skewered and grilled as sate kambing, or curried in soups such as sup kambing and gulai kambing. Goat meat is also a major delicacy in Nepal, and both castrated (khashi-ko-masu) and uncastrated (boka-ko-masu) goats are sacrificed during Dashain, the largest annual celebrations in the country, as well as on other festive occasions. There are many separate dishes, which together include all edible parts of the animal. Bhutun is made from the gut, rakhti from the blood, karji-marji from the liver and lungs, and the feet ‚Äî khutti ‚Äî are often made into soup. Sukuti is a kind of jerky, while sekuwa is made from roasted meat and often eaten with alcoholic beverages. In addition to these dishes, goat meat is often eaten as part of momos, thukpa, chow mein and other dishes in various parts of the country. Taas is another popular fried goat meat dish in Nepal, particularly popular in Chitwan district of Nepal. Cabrito, a specialty especially common in Latin American cuisine such as Mexican, Peruvian, Brazilian, and Argentine, is usually slow roasted. In Mexican cuisine, there are a variety of dishes including fritada (cooking the goat in its blood) and cabrito entomatado which means it is boiled in a tomato and spices sauce. Southern Italian, Greek and Portuguese cuisines are also known for serving roast goat in celebration of Easter (in Italian cuisines, minced goat is used in spaghetti bolognese and lasagna as an alternative for beef), with the North of Portugal serving it as well on Christmas day; goat dishes are also an Easter staple in the alpine regions of central Europe, often braised (Bavaria) or breaded and fried (Tyrol). In Africa, the Chaga people of Tanzania, a ceremonial goat (locally called Ndafu) would be gutted and roasted as whole as part of tradition that spans hundreds of years. The ceremonial goat is the preferred replacement to the wedding cake used in many weddings around the world.  Characteristics  A tajine of goat meat Goat has a reputation for having a strong, gamey flavour, but the taste can also be mild, depending on how it is raised and prepared. Caribbean cultures often prefer meat from mature goats, which tends to be more pungent; while some other cultures prefer meat that comes from younger goats that are six to nine months old. Ribs, loins, and tenderloin goat meat are suitable for quick cooking, while other cuts are best for long braising. Despite being classified as red meat, goat is leaner and contains less cholesterol, fat, and protein than both lamb and beef, and less energy than beef or chicken; therefore, it requires low-heat, slow cooking to preserve tenderness and moisture.  Production  Goats consume less forage than beef cattle. A hectare of pasture can sustain 25 goats or more, compared to five steers. A goat may produce of meat, which is much less than that of cattle or pigs, often making goats unsuitable for modern meat processors.

As a three-year-old in 2005 he won the Grand Prix de Paris (in record time) and the St. Leger Stakes. In 2007 he won the Coronation Cup. Background Scorpion is a bay horse with a white star and white socks on his hind feet bred in Ireland by the County Kildare-based Grangemore Stud. He is one of many top-class horses sired by Montjeu. Others include the Derby winners Motivator, Authorized, Pour Moi and Camelot, the St Leger winners Leading Light and Masked Marvel, and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Hurricane Run. Scorpion's dam Ardmelody, was an unraced daughter of the Irish Derby winner Law Society. Ardmelody's dam, Thistlewood, was a half-sister to both the outstanding stayer Ardross and the Prix de Flore winner Gesedeh, the grand-dam of Electrocutionist. In September 2003, the yearling was sent to the Goffs sale where he was bought for ‚Ç¨260,000 by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne on behalf of the Coolmore organisation. Like many of the Coolmore horses, the details of Scorpion's ownership changed from race to race. He sometimes raced in the colours of Sue Magnier and sometimes as the property of a partnership of Magnier and Michael Tabor. He was trained at Ballydoyle by Aidan O'Brien. Racing career=2005: three-year-old season Scorpion did not race as a two-year-old, but made his debut in a ten-furlong maiden race at Leopardstown on 8 May 2005. Ridden by Kieren Fallon he started the 4/5 favourite and won by half a length from Magnolia Lane, with a gap of ten lengths back to the third placed horse. Two weeks later he was moved up in class for the Group Three Gallinule Stakes at the Curragh Racecourse. He again started the odds-on favourite but failed by a short head to catch Im Spartacus, with the British-trained Mister Genepi another short head away in third. Despite his defeat at the Curragh, the colt was again stepped up in class for the Group One Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly Racecourse on 5 June. After restraining the colt in the early stages Fallon attempted to make a forward move in the straight but Scorpion made no progress and finished sixteenth of the seventeen runners behind Shamardal, who defeated the favourite Hurricane Run by a neck. Scorpion was moved up in distance three weeks later and started a 25/1 outsider for the Irish Derby over one and a half miles at the Curragh. Ridden by Colm O'Donoghue he took the lead in the straight and kept on well after being overtaken by Hurricane Run to finish second, half a length behind the winner. Scorpion returned to France for the Grand Prix de Paris over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 14 July. Reunited with Fallon, he started the 6/4 favourite against eight opponent headed by the Prix du Lys winner Desideratum. After racing just behind the leaders he took the lead in the straight and drew away in the last 200 metres to win by two and a half lengths from Desideratum. After a break of almost two months, Scorpion returned to the racecourse to start 10/11 favourite for the 229th running of the St Leger over fourteen and half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September. He faced only five opponents, with his most serious opposition appearing likely to come from Hard Top and The Geezer, first and second in the Great Voltigeur Stakes. Ridden by Frankie Dettori, he took the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, going clear in the straight and winning by two lengths from The Geezer, with Tawqeet five lengths back in third. On his final appearance of the season he was ridden by Mick Kinane in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on 2 October. He was among the early leaders and held fourth place early in the straight but weakened in the closing stages and finished tenth of the fifteen runners, thirteen and a half lengths behind the winner Hurricane Run. 2006: four- year-old season Training problems kept Scorpion off the racecourse before he returned in the Listed Finale Stakes at the Curragh on 8 October. He started favourite but was beaten a length by the British-trained five-year-old Frank Sonata. In his two remaining races Scorpion competed in major international races but made little impact. He finished fifth behind Red Rocks in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs in November and seventh behind Collier Hill in the Hong Kong Vase at Sha Tin Racecourse in December. 2007: five-year-old season Scorpion began his third campaign in the Ormonde Stakes at Chester Racecourse on 11 May in which he was ridden by Kinane. He started favourite but appeared very nervous before the race and was beaten two lengths into second place by the Michael Stoute-trained four-year-old Ask. Three weeks later, the horse contested the Group One Coronation Cup over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. He started the 8/1 fifth choice in the betting behind the 2006 St Leger winner Sixties Icon, the Mooresbridge Stakes winner Septimus (also trained by Aidan O'Brien), the 2006 Epsom Derby winner Sir Percy and Maraahel, twice winner of the Huxley Stakes. Scorpion moved into second place behind Septimus at half way, before overtaking his better fancied stable companion two furlongs from the finish. He stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by one and a quarter lengths and half a length from Septimus and Maraahel. Scorpion started 4/5 favourite for the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot on 23 June but was beaten half a length by Maraahel, to whom he was conceding five pounds. On 28 July, Scorpion started 3/1 second favourite (behind his stable companion Dylan Thomas) for Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot. He took the lead soon after the start and maintained his advantage into the straight but weakened in the closing stages to finish fifth of the seven runners behind Dylan Thomas. On his final racecourse appearance, Scorpion was matched against another stable companion, the double Ascot Gold Cup winner Yeats in the Irish St. Leger over one and three quarter miles at the Curragh on 15 September. Scorpion was ridden by Seamie Heffernan and started at odds of 7/2, whilst Yeats, ridden by Fallon, was the 4/7 favourite. Scorpion went to the front from the start and held the lead until well inside the final furlong when he was caught and beaten half a length by Yeats. Stud record Scorpion was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion for the Coolmore Stud National Hunt breeding arm. He stood at the Castle Hyde Stud in County Cork and was marketed as a National Hunt stallion. The best of his progeny have included the King George VI Chase winner Might Bight, the American Champion Steeplechase Horse Scorpiancer and Don't Touch It (Herald Champion Novice Hurdle).

The slightly built Eden played for Manly-Warringah, Eastern Suburbs, Parramatta and the Gold Coast in the NSWRL premiership. Originally appearing in the halves, he later played at . Playing career A Manly junior who made his first grade debut for the Sea Eagles from the bench in Manly's 28-10 loss to Penrith at Penrith Park on 18 April 1981. Eden only played two first grade games for Manly in the 1981 season, the other (also from the bench) saw the Sea Eagles come away with a 22-15 win over defending premiers Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs at Manly's Brookvale Oval. The 1982 season saw Eden play 19 games for the Sea Eagles playing mostly at fullback due to the emergence of teenage halfback Phil Blake and injury to champion Manly fullback Graham Eadie. Eden would be the Sea Eagles top point scorer for the year (the first time since 1972 that honour would go to a player other than Eadie), scoring 2 tries and 71 goals for 148 points. Eadie returned late in the season and resumed the fullback role with Eden missing the Sea Eagles run to the Grand Final where they ultimately lost 21-8 to Parramatta. During the season, Eden was named the player of the series in the 1982 KB Cup won by Manly for the first time. Eden's form in 1982, plus his goal kicking and utility value saw his name touted as a possible selection for the 1982 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France. However, missing Manly's late season games and finals campaign would prove costly and he ultimately missed out on a place in the Australian squad for the Kangaroo Tour. With Eadie back for the 1983 NSWRFL season, Eden signed to play for Eastern Suburbs and would become the season's leading point scorer, scoring 256 points (12 tries, 103 goals, and 2 field goals). He also won the competition's Best and Fairest award, the Rothmans Medal, in 1983. Eden later said, \\"Manly eventually told me they weren‚Äôt going to be able to go anywhere near what they were offering over at the Roosters, but that they‚Äôd still love me to stay. I just said, 'Look, you've offered me three grand, the Roosters have offered me 25 ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm newly married and got a kid on the way ‚Ä¶ a university wage, help me out here.' So I signed with the Roosters.' After an injury interrupted 1984 season where he scored 96 points (5 tries, 36 goals) playing only 13 games mostly at fullback or , he signed with Parramatta for the 1985 season. He would spend 3 injuries interrupted seasons with the Eels, playing only 27 games for the club and like he had done in 1982 with Manly, he missed the Eels charge to the premiership in 1986. Eden signed for new club the Gold Coast Giants in 1988. That season saw him play 19 games for the club where he would be the team's leading point scorer with 79 points (1 try, 36 goals, 3 field goals) and had the honour of scoring the club's first ever try in their opening game of the season against Canterbury-Bankstown. He played a further 12 games in 1989 for the poorly performed Giants and was again their leading point scorer with 63 points(3 tries, 25 goals and 1 field goal) before announcing his retirement at the end of the season. Mike Eden played 112 first grade games in his career. A player of rare ability who could kick both in general play and for goal with either feet with equal effectiveness, he scored a total of 701 points from 26 tries, 296 goals, and 7 field goals.

He is taken to London by his uncle Sir Charles Tregellis, a highly respected gentleman and arbiter of fashion who is on familiar terms with the most important people of Great Britain. The novel interweaves Rodney's coming-of-age story with that of his friend Boy Jim's boxing endeavours. Jim has been brought up thinking he is a blacksmith's son - the blacksmith Harrison was a famous former boxer and the 'son' wishes to fight too. So a large portion of it deals with the famous bare-knuckle boxers of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, such as Jem Belcher, John Jackson, Daniel Mendoza, Dutch Sam, and others. The book includes vignettes of a number of historical personages, notably the Prince Regent, Lord Nelson, Sir John Lade, Lord Cochrane and Beau Brummell.

The plant is native to chaparral and woodlands and the Sierra Nevada foothills, and can survive drought, though it grows most abundantly in moist soils near water sources. Description thumb Rosa californica is a bush or thicket-forming shrub with prickly, curving stems. The fragrant flowers may grow singly or in inflorescences of several blooms. Each rose is open-faced and generally flat, with five petals in any shade of pink from almost white to deep magenta. It produces typical rose hips containing yellow seeds. Cultivation thumb Rosa californica is used in California native gardens and habitat gardens, forming colonies, and attracting wildlife with the bright rose hips in autumn. Uses The rose hips were used during World War II for their high vitamin content. They are dried for tea, or for use in jellies and sauces. The Cahuilla ate the rose buds raw or soaked them in water for drinking. A tea was also made from the roots, and used for colds. Because the rose hips remain on the plant throughout the winter, they provide food for wildlife during times when little forage is available.

Harry Halbreich (obituary). Diapason, September 2016, No.649, p.18. Biography The son of a Jewish-German father and English mother, Halbreich studied with Arthur Honegger and later with Olivier Messiaen at the Paris Conservatoire, gaining a first prize in analysis and history of music. He later made his base in Belgium. From 1970 to 1976 he was Lecturer () in Musical Analysis at the Royal Conservatory in Mons. He worked on numerous radio broadcasts and co-founded the Belgian music magazine Crescendo for which he was a major contributor. From 1973 to 1976 he was artistic director of the Festival de Royan. He was known for a number of books, articles and studies on modern and contemporary music, including monograph works on Olivier Messiaen, Claude Debussy, Arthur Honegger, and Bohuslav Martin≈Ø. He prepared musical catalogues of the works of Honegger and Martin≈Ø, and their works are therefore sometimes referred to by their H number. He assisted Nicolas Bacri in orchestrating Honegger's opera, La morte de Sainte Alm√©enne, originally written in 1918 for voice and piano; the new version was premiered in Utrecht on 26 November 2005, on the 50th anniversary of the composer's death. Halbreich's interest in modern music led to him writing articles on composers including contemporary music, particularly Spectral music: Hora»õiu RƒÉdulescu, Iancu Dumitrescu, Ana-Maria Avram, G√©rard Grisey, and Tristan Murail. He has also written on composers of the past, including Edgard Var√®se, George Enescu, Maurice Ohana as well as Ludwig van Beethoven. A personal friend of contemporary performers and composers such as Iannis Xenakis, Giacinto Scelsi, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and Witold Lutos≈Çawski, he was a keen defender of younger composers. He had a broad interest in culture, and while a convert to Catholicism, he was open to, and expressed deep knowledge of eastern spiritual history alongside Christian mystics. He died on 27 June 2016 at the age of 85.Death of H-number musicologist Of his three children, the eldest Fr√©d√©ric is a painter.

But other countries like Colombia, Chile, Germany and Spain, opted to limit amparo shield only to some constitutional guarantees or fundamental rights.[Brewer-Carias, A., ‚ÄúThe Latin American Amparo Proceeding and the Right of Amparo in the Philippines,‚Äù Second Distinguished Lecture, Series of 2007, Supreme Court, Philippine Judicial Academy in coordination with the Philippine Association of Law Schools, March 7, 2008.] In the Philippines, while the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines failed to expressly provide for amparo, several amparo protections are already guaranteed, thus: by paragraph 2, Article VIII, Section 1, the \\"Grave Abuse Clause\\" - which grants a similar general protection to human rights extended by the amparo contra leyes, amparo casacion, and amparo administrativo. Amparo libertad is similar to habeas corpus in the 1987 Constitution. The Clause is borrowed from the U.S. common law tradition of judicial review (1803 case of Marbury v. Madison).[See 1987 Phil. Const. Art. III, ¬ß¬ß 13 & 15; Art. VII, ¬ß 18; Art. VIII, ¬ß 5(1).][ 5 U.S. 137 (1803).

Azcuna, The Right of Amparo: A Remedy to Enforce Fundamental Rights, 37 ATENEO L.J. 15 (1993).). The \\"recurso de amparo\\" is an exhaustive remedy which originated from Latin America's Mexican, Chile and Argentina legal systems, inter alia. Mexico's amparo is found in Articles 103 and 107 of the Mexican Constitution -- the judicial review of governmental action, to empower state courts to protect individuals against state abuses. Amparo was sub-divided into 5 legal departments: :(a) the Liberty Amparo (amparo de libertad); (b) the Constitutionality Amparo (amparo contra leyes); (c) the Judicial or ‚ÄúCassation‚Äù Amparo, aimed at the constitutionality of a judicial interpretation; (d) the Administrative Amparo (amparo como contencioso-administrativo); and (e) the Agrarian Amparo (amparo en matera agraria, ejidal y comunal).Inquirer.net, Joaquin G. Bernas, The Mexican amparo  Argentine amparo  Amparo was also legally enshrined in Latin America legal systems. It is now an extraordinary legal remedy in Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay Peru, Brazil and Argentina. Amparo in Argentina is a limited, summary, emergency procedure, and merely supplementary, requiring previous exhaustion of administrative remedies before rendition of judgment of mandamus or injunction. The decision bars monetary awards and penal provisions except contempt or declaration of unconstitutionality. Inquirer.net, Joaquin G. Bernas, The Argentine amparo  Habeas corpus  Historically, Philippine Habeas Corpus (from 1901 until the present) failed to provide an efficacious legal remedy to victims of extra-judicial killings and desaparecidos. The amparo de libertad transcends the protection of habeas corpus. Once a lawsuit is filed under Habeas Corpus, Rule 102, Rules of Court, the defendants, government officers would merely submit the usual defense of alibi or non- custody of the body sought to be produced. The 1987 Philippine constitution, however, empowers the Supreme Court of the Philippines to promulgate amparo and habeas data, as part of the Rules of Court expressly: ‚ÄúPromulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights.‚Äù (Sec. 5, (5), Article VIII, 1987, Constitution) The writ of habeas corpus is an \\"extraordinary\\", \\"common law\\", or \\"prerogative writ\\", which were historically issued by English courts in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are quo warranto, prohibito, mandamus, procedendo, and certiorari. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority, so that the official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something, failing which the court has no discretion but to decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. National Summit on Extrajudicial Killings and Enforced Disappearances On July 16, 2007, Justices, activists, militant leaders, police officials, politicians and prelates attended the Supreme Court of the Philippines's 2-day summit at the Manila Hotel, Metro Manila to solve extrajudicial killings. Chief Justice Reynato Puno stated that the \\"National Consultative Summit on Extrajudicial Killings and Forced Disappearances: Searching for Solutions\\" would help stop the murders. Based on CBCP - Bishop Deogracias Yniguez- church's count, the number of victims of extrajudicial killings was record at 778, while survivors of \\"political assassinations\\" was 370; 203 \\"massacre\\" victims; 186 desaparecido; 502 tortured, and those illegally arrested.

Under the writ, plaintiffs or victims will have the right of access to information on their lawsuits‚Äîa constitutional right called the \\"habeas data\\" derived from constitutions of Latin America. The final draft of these twin writs (retroactive) will be promulgated on October.

Puno explained that amparo bars alibi, while Habeas Data \\"can find out what information is held by the officer, rectify or even the destroy erroneous data gathered\\". Brazil used the writ, followed by Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Argentina and Ecuador. Inquirer.net, Habeas data: SC‚Äôs new remedy vs killings, disappearances The Philippine 1987 Constitution was derived from the 1973 Ferdinand Marcos Constitution, its 1981 amendment, from the 1935 constitution, and from the United States Constitution. The United States Constitution was adopted in its original form on September 17, 1787, by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and later ratified by conventions in each state in the name of \\"the People.\\" The U.S. Constitution is the oldest written national constitution except possibly for San Marino 's Statutes of 1600, whose status as a true constitution is disputed by scholars. The Writ of Amparo is a remedy to enforce fundamental rights. ‚Äúamong the different procedures that have been established for the protection of human rights, the primary ones that provide direct and immediate protection are habeas corpus and amparo. The difference between these two writs is that habeas corpus is designed to enforce the right to freedom of the person, whereas amparo is designed to protect those other fundamental human rights enshrined in the Constitution but not covered by the writ of habeas corpus.‚Äù Law.ateneo.edu, Ateneo De Manila Law School The literal translation from Latin of Habeas Data is ‚Äúyou should have the data‚Äù. Habeas Data is a constitutional right to protect, per lawsuit filed in court, to protect the image, privacy, honour, information self-determination and freedom of information of a person. Habeas Data can used to discover what information is held about his or her person (via rectification or destruction of the personal data held. Habeas Data originated, inter alia, from the Council of Europe's 108th Convention on Data Protection of 1981 (aimed at protecting the privacy of the individual regarding the automated processing of personal data; with right to access their personal data held in an automated database.

The Supreme Court granted the writ and ordered the police to turn over documents relating to the drug war. The decision covered the turnover of police records on operations where suspects were killed. After hearings on a motion for reconsideration filed by the Office of the Solicitor General, the Supreme Court upheld on April 3, 2018, its earlier decision and ordered the solicitor general and the Philippine National Police to submit data related to the government's war on drugs. *On May 22, 2018, the Supreme Court upheld a Court of Appeals decision for the issuance of the writs of amparo and habeas data to human rights lawyer Maria Catherine Dannug-Salucon.

It argued that there must be a cooperative action on all parts of the government and civil society: :Though it responds to practical areas it is still necessary that further action must be taken in addition to this. The legislative bodies, House of Representatives and Senate, should also initiate its own actions promptly and without delay. They must enact laws which ensure protection of rights‚Äîlaws against torture and enforced disappearance and laws to afford adequate legal remedies to victims. The AHRC objected that the writs fail to protect non-witnesses, even if they too face threats or risk to their lives.

It was destroyed during the Second World War to prevent its use by the Japanese. Fundraising In order to fund the railway, Chin raised $2.75 million, mainly from overseas Chinese; some sourcesEric Scigliano, for example. Cheng and Yuzun (1982) seem to say that initial fundraising was entirely from China and from overseas Chinese, but some later funds were borrowed from abroad. say that further investment came from James J. Hill, but others say that at a time when railway development in China was dominated by European nations,Cheng and Yuzun (1982) record that \\"by 1911, over ninety percent of Chinese railroad lines were built by Westerners or by foreign loans.\\" he \\"vowed not to sell shares to foreigners, to borrow money from them, or to use their engineers.\\" Chin's partner Yu Zhuo raised further funds in China and from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Its benefits to Guangdong's economy were cut short when it was seized by local warlords in 1926; it was finally destroyed during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938.Guide to the Willard G. Jue Papers, 1880-1983 on the site of the University of Washington Libraries, accessed July 19, 2007.Xiao-huang Yin & Zhiyong Lan (2003), p. 9. While raising funds and building the railway, Chin encountered numerous obstacles: a magistrate tried to usurp credit for organizing the company; there were many difficulties over obtaining a right of way due to clan feuds and superstitions (geomancyHelen F. Siu, Agents and Victims in South China: Accomplices in Rural Revolution, Yale University Press (1989). . p. 71.); and gentry-officials repeatedly attempted extortion. Chin bought an official title to become legally one of the gentry himself, which somewhat eased the process. Still, the construction was confronted by over a hundred riots staged by local landlord forces, resulting in thirty-nine otherwise unnecessary turns, which made construction more expensive and affected speed and safety.Cheng and Yuzun (1982) Construction The company was officially chartered in 1906. The first section‚Äî15 miles from Kung Yick (, Gongyi) at the northern tip of the Taishan district to Taishan‚Äîopened in January 1908. In 1909, it reached Doushan and the 54-mile railway was officially open for business. By 1913, it reached another 26 miles to Jiangmen; a further 21-mile branch line from Taishan to Baisha opened in 1920.Jue (1983) p. 34 is the source for the spelling Kung Yick and the location of the city. Altogether, construction costs totaled about 9.7 million yuan or US$4.8 million. Rolling stock was purchased mainly from the United States, although three tank locomotives came from Germany. Trains typically had six or seven cars, carrying both passengers (in three classes) and freight. At its height in the 1920s, it carried three million passengers and approximately a hundred thousand tons of cargo annually, with 80% of income coming from passengers. In this same era, freight was heavily weighted toward imports: the import/export ratio was about thirty to one, in an economy heavily based on remittances from abroad. By 1922 there was a machine shop in Kung Yick City. Chin Gee Hee claimed that it \\"could manufacture everything except the locomotive.\\"Jue (1983), p. 34. Unfulfilled 1924 plans by Chin would have extended the railway in one direction 40 miles from Doushan to the Tonggu Commercial Port and in the other to Foshan, through which would have reached Guangzhou and the domestic mainland. Chin also wanted to continue west through Yangjiang and the west of Guangdong and to the Leizhou peninsula, forming a traffic network throughout the southwest of Guangdong. Several similar proposals met similar fates: the well-connected Yuehan Railway Company had a near-monopoly on railway construction in Guangdong, some of the gentry wished to create their own railways, and while the Sun Ning finally obtained the required formal positions, by the time it got those permissions it was in financial trouble. Furthermore, the Qing government prevented them from borrowing from abroad, despite the fact that the government itself was taking foreign loans at the time. Consequently, the railway never connected to any major port or any other key city of the Chinese economy. From 1927 to 1929, the government overtly took over the railroad, but it proved to be beyond their ability to operate it, and they returned it to civilian control. The railroad was destroyed in the Second Sino-Japanese War, dismantled in December 1938 to deny its use by the Japanese military, who nonetheless occupied Taishan. 23,782 rails were shipped to Guangxi in 1942 to build the Qianguei Railway; all other assets, which were worth over three million yuan, were carried off by the Japanese. Lucie Cheng and Liu Yuzun write that, while the railway did not play major economic or strategic role in the history of Chinese transportation, \\"its entire life reflects the interlocking but conflicting pressures of Western imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism which characterized early twentieth century China‚Ä¶ Moreover [it] reflects the role of emigrant capital and nationalism on the development of enterprises in the emigrant motherland,\\" reflecting especially the investment by overseas Chinese in a geographic area (Taishan) which had been the homeland for so many of them.

The locality is split between the Western Downs Region (northern part of the locality) and the Goondiwindi Region (southern part of the locality). The Moonie Highway passes through the locality from the north- east to the south-west. The Leichhardt Highway passes through the locality from the north to the south. The town is at the intersection of the two highways. History The town's name is derived from Moonie River, which was first recorded as Mooni by Sir Thomas Mitchell in November 1846 when he passed through the region. Moonie State School opened on 14 May 1962. Moonie Post Office opened by June 1966 closed in 1983. Moonie Library opened in 2003.  Economy  Farm land, Moonie, 2016 In December 1961 Moonie was the site of Australia's first commercial oil field, a very small field consisting of less than one percent of Australia's oil and gas reserves. The oil field is still operational and pumps out 35 kilolitres (7,700 gallons) every day. The region is also an agricultural area that produces grain, beef cattle and prime lambs.  Education  Moonie State School is a government co-educational primary (P-6) school at 11305 Moonie Highway. In 2016, the school had an enrolment of 43 students with 4 teachers (3 full-time equivalent) and 5 non-teaching staff (2 full-time equivalent).  Amenities  The town has a service station, the Moonie Sports Club, a pool and a motel. Moonie Library is located on the Leichhardt Highway.

He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in agricultural chemistry at the National Taiwan University. He subsequently moved to the United States and completed his doctoral degree in plant biochemistry from Utah State University.  Career  After completing his PhD, he conducted postdoctoral research at the University of California, Davis, New York Medical School, and University of California, San Diego. He joined the faculty University of California, Davis in 1966. The Yang cycle Yang was known for his research that unlocked the key to prolonging freshness in fruits and flowers. His research focused on how plants produce ethylene, which is important in regulating a host of plant functions, ranging from seed germination to fruit ripening. He studied the pathway of ethylene biosynthesis and proved unequivocally the central role of methionine as a precursor of ethylene. He discovers that this process is cyclic and therefore receives the name \\"Yang Cycle\\". Ethylene represents one of the five major hormones affecting plant development and maturation. He was the first scientist to report S-adenosylmethionine as an intermediate in methionine conversion to ethylene. Then, in 1979, he discovered aminocylopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) as an intermediate. His discovery of ACC-synthase opened the way to the understanding of the regulating process of ethylene biosynthesis. Yang died on February 12, 2007 in a Davis hospital from complications of pneumonia.  Awards and honours  Yang received several awards and honours for his research. In 1990, he was inducted into the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.

Environmental signals are often responsible for this grouping, including nightfall, high tide, or rainfall. The distinction between communal roosting and cooperative breeding is the absence of chicks in communal roosts. While communal roosting is generally observed in birds, the behavior has also been seen in bats, primates, and insects. The size of these roosts can measure in the thousands to millions of individuals, especially among avian species. There are many benefits associated with communal roosting including: increased foraging ability, decreased thermoregulatory demands, decreased predation, and increased conspecific interactions. While there are many proposed evolutionary concepts for how communal roosting evolved, no specific hypothesis is currently supported by the scientific community as a whole.  Evolution  One of the adaptive explanations for communal roosting is the hypothesis that individuals are benefited by the exchange of information at communal roosts. This idea is known as the information center hypothesis (ICH) and proposed by Peter Ward and Amotz Zahavi in 1973. It states that bird assemblages such as communal roosts act as information hubs for distributing knowledge about food source location. When food patch knowledge is unevenly distributed amongst certain flock members, the other \\"clueless\\" flock members can follow and join these knowledgeable members to find good feeding locations. To quote Ward and Zahavi on the evolutionary reasons as to how communal roosts came about, \\"...communal roosts, breeding colonies and certain other bird assemblages have been evolved primarily for the efficient exploitation of unevenly-distributed food sources by serving as ' information-centres.' \\"  The two strategies hypothesis  A stylized example of a communal roost under the two strategies hypothesis, with the more dominant individuals occupying the higher and safer roosts.The two strategies hypothesis was put forth by Patrick Weatherhead in 1983 as an alternative to the then popular information center hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that different individuals join and participate in communal roosts for different reasons that are based primarily on their social status. Unlike the ICH, not all individuals will join a roost in order to increase their foraging capabilities. This hypothesis explains that while roosts initially evolved due to information sharing among older and more experienced foragers, this evolution was aided by the benefits that more experienced foragers gained due to the fact that as better foragers they acquired a status of high rank within the roost. As dominant individuals, they are able to obtain the safest roosts, typically those highest in the tree or closest to the center of the roost. In these roosts, the less dominant and unsuccessful foragers act as a physical predation buffer for the dominant individuals. This is similar to the selfish herd theory, which states that individuals within herds will utilize conspecifics as physical barriers from predation. The younger and less dominant individuals will still join the roost because they gain some safety from predation through the dilution effect, as well as the ability to learn from the more experienced foragers that are already in the roost. Support for the two strategies hypothesis has been shown in studies of roosting rooks (Corvus frugilegus). A 1977 study of roosting rooks by Ian Swingland showed that an inherent hierarchy exists within rook communal roosts. In this hierarchy, the most dominant individuals have been shown to routinely occupy the roosts highest in the tree, and while they pay a cost (increased energy use to keep warm) they are safer from terrestrial predators. Despite this enforced hierarchy, lower ranking rooks remained with the roost, indicating that they still received some benefit from their participation in the roost. When weather conditions worsened, the more dominant rooks forced the younger and less dominant out of their roosts. Swingland proposed that the risk of predation at lower roosts was outweighed by the gains in reduced thermal demands. Similar support for the two strategies hypothesis has also been found in red-winged blackbird roosts. In this species the more dominant males will regularly inhabit roosts in thicker brush, where they are better hidden from predators than the less dominant individuals, that are forced to roost at the edge of the brush.Weatherhead, Patrick J., and Drew J. Hoysak. \\"Dominance structuring of a red-winged blackbird roost.\\" The Auk (1984): 551-555. The TSH makes several assumptions that must be met in order for the theory to work. The first major assumption is that within communal roosts there are certain roosts that possess safer or more beneficial qualities than other roosts. The second assumption is that the more dominant individuals will be capable of securing these roosts, and finally dominance rank must be a reliable indicator of foraging ability.  The recruitment center hypothesis (RCH)  Proposed by Heinz Richner and Phillip Heeb in 1996, the recruitment center hypothesis (RCH) explains the evolution of communal roosting as a result of group foraging. The RCH also explains behaviors seen at communal roosts such as: the passing of information, aerial displays, and the presence or lack of calls by leaders. This hypothesis assumes: * Patchy feeding area: Food is not evenly distributed across an area but grouped into patches * Short-lasting: Patches are not present for an extended period of time * Relatively abundant: There are many patches with relatively equal amounts of food present in each These factors decrease relative food competition since control over a food source by an individual is not correlated to the duration or richness of said source. The passing of information acts to create a foraging group. Group foraging decreases predation and increases relative feeding time at the cost of sharing a food source. The decrease in predation is due to the dilution factor and an early warning system created by having multiple animals alert. Increases in relative feeding are explained by decreasing time spent watching for predators and social learning. Recruiting new members to food patches benefits successful foragers by increasing relative numbers. With the addition of new members to a group the benefits of group foraging increase until the group size is larger than the food source is able to support. Less successful foragers benefit by gaining knowledge of where food sources are located. Aerial displays are used to recruit individuals to participate in group foraging. However, not all birds display since not all birds are members in a group or are part of a group that is seeking participants. In the presence of patchy resources, Richner and Heeb propose the simplest manner would be to form a communal roost and recruit participants there. In other words, recruitment to foraging groups explains the presence of these communal roosts. Support for the RCH has been shown in ravens (Covus corax). Reviewing a previous study by John Marzluff, Bernd Heinrich, and Colleen Marzluff, Etienne Danchin and Heinz Richner demonstrate that the collected data proves the RCH instead of the Information Center Hypothesis supported by Marzluff, et al. Both knowledgeable and na√Øve (\\"clueless\\") birds are shown to make up the roosts and leave them at the same time, with the na√Øve birds being led to the food sources. Aerial demonstrations were shown to peak around the same time as the discovery of a new food source. These communities were made up of non- breeders which forage in patchily distributed food environments, following the assumptions made by Richner and Heeb. In 2014, Sarangi et. al. shown that the recruitment centre hypothesis did not hold in the study population of Common Mynas (Acridotheres tristis) and hence Common Myna roosts are not recruitment centres. At this point in time there has been no additional scientific evidence excluding RCH or any evidence of overwhelming support. What is overlooked by RCH is that information may also be passed within the communal roost which increases and solidifies the community.  Potential benefits  Birds in a communal roost can reduce the impact of wind and cold weather by sharing body heat through huddling, which reduces the overall energy demand of thermoregulation. A study by Guy Beauchamp explained that black-billed magpies (Pica hudsonia) often formed the largest roosts during the winter. The magpies tend to react very slowly at low body temperatures, leaving them vulnerable to predators. Communal roosting in this case would improve their reactivity by sharing body heat, allowing them to detect and respond to predators much more quickly. A large roost with many members can visually detect predators easier, allowing individuals to respond and alert others quicker to threats. Individual risk is also lowered due to the dilution effect, which states that an individual in a large group will have a low probability of being preyed upon. Similar to the selfish-herd theory, communal roosts have demonstrated a hierarchy of sorts where older members and better foragers nest in the interior of the group, decreasing their exposure to predators. Younger birds and less able foragers located on the outskirts still demonstrate some safety from predation due to the dilution effect. According to the ICH, successful foragers share knowledge of favorable foraging sites with unsuccessful foragers at a communal roost, making it energetically advantageous for individuals to communally roost and forage more easily. Additionally with a greater number of individuals at a roost, the searching range of a roost will increase and improve the probability of finding favorable foraging sites. There are also potentially improved mating opportunities, as demonstrated by red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), which have a portion of a communal roost dedicated to individuals that lack mates and territories.  Potential costs  It is costly for territorial species to physically travel to and from roosts, and in leaving their territories they open themselves up to takeovers. Communal roosts may draw the attention of potential predators, as the roost becomes audibly and visibly more conspicuous due to the number of members. There is also a decrease in the local food supply as a greater number of members results in competition for food. A large number of roost members can also increases the exposure to droppings, causing plumage to deteriorate and leaving birds vulnerable to dying from exposure as droppings reduce the ability of feathers to shed water.  Examples by species = Birds  Rooks forming a nocturnal roost in Hungary Western Cattle Egret night roosting in MoroccoCommunal roosting has been observed in numerous avian species. As previously mentioned, rooks (Corvus frugilegus) are known to form large nocturnal roosts, these roosts can contain anywhere from a few hundred to over a thousand individuals. These roosts then disband at daybreak when the birds return to foraging activities. Studies have shown that communal roosting behavior is mediated by light intensity, which is correlated with sunset, where rooks will return to the roost when the ambient light has sufficiently dimmed. Acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) are known to form communal roosts during the winter months. In these roosts two to three individuals will share a cavity during the winter. Within these tree cavities woodpeckers share their body heat with each other and therefore decrease the thermoregulatory demands on the individuals within the roost. Small scale communal roosting during the winter months has also been observed in Green Woodhoopoes (Phoeniculus purpureus). Winter communal roosts in these species typically contain around five individuals. Tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) located in southeastern Louisiana are known to form nocturnal communal roosts and have been shown to exhibit high roost fidelity, with individuals often returning to the same roost they had occupied on the previous night. Research has shown that swallows form communal roosts due to the combined factors of conspecific attraction, where individual swallows are likely to aggregate around other swallows of the same species, and roost fidelity. Tree swallows will form roosts numbering in hundreds or thousands of individuals. Red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) roost in what has been classified as either a main roost or a sub roost. Main roosts are constantly in use, whereas the sub roosts are used irregularly by individuals lacking both a mate and territory. These sub roosts are believed to help improve the ability of non-breeding choughs to find a mate and increase their territory ranges. Interspecies roosts have been observed between different bird species. In San Blas, Mexico, the great egret (Ardea alba), the little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), the tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor), and the snowy egret (Egretta thula) are known to form large communal roosts. It has been shown that the snowy egret determines the general location of the roost due to the fact that the other three species rely on it for its abilities to find food sources. In these roosts there is often a hierarchical system, where the more dominant species (in this case the snowy egret) will typically occupy the more desirable higher perches. Interspecies roosts have also been observed among other avian species.Burger, Joanna. \\"A model for the evolution of mixed-species colonies of Ciconiiformes.\\" Quarterly Review of Biology (1981): 143-167.  Insects  Heliconius charitonius) sleeping in a nocturnal communal roost. 197x197px Communal roosting has also been well documented among insects, particularly butterflies. The passion-vine butterfly (Heliconius erato) is known to form nocturnal roosts, typically comprising four individuals. It is believed that these roosts deter potential predators due to the fact that predators attack roosts less often than they do individuals.Finkbeiner, Susan D., Adriana D. Briscoe, and Robert D. Reed. \\"The benefit of being a social butterfly: communal roosting deters predation.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences 2012; 279(1739): 2769‚Äì2776. Communal roosting behavior has also been observed in the neotropical zebra longwing butterfly (Heliconius charitonius) in the La Cinchona region of Costa Rica. A study of this roost showed that individuals vary in their roost fidelity, and that they tend to form smaller sub roosts. The same study observed that in this region communal roosting can be mediated by heavy rainfall.Young, Allen M., and Mary Ellen Carolan. \\"Daily instability of communal roosting in the neotropical butterfly Heliconius charitonius (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae).\\" Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society(1976): 346-359. Communal roosting has also been observed in south Peruvian tiger beetles of the subfamily Cicindelidae. These species of tiger beetle have been observed to form communal roosts comprising anywhere from two to nine individuals at night and disbanding during the day. It is hypothesized that these beetles roost high in the treetops in order to avoid ground-based predators.Pearson, David L., and Joseph J. Anderson. \\"Perching heights and nocturnal communal roosts of some tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) in southeastern Peru.\\" Biotropica (1985): 126-129.  Mammals  While there are few observations of communal roosting mammals, the trait has been seen in several species of bats. The little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) is known to participate in communal roosts of up to thirty seven during cold nights in order to decrease thermoregulatory demands, with the roost disbanding at daybreak. Several other species of bats, including the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) and the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) have also been observed to roost communally in maternal colonies in order to reduce the thermoregulatory demands on both the lactating mothers and juveniles.

It is an erect or spreading shrub with egg-shaped, pointed leaves and red tube-shaped flowers which give the plant its name longiflora and are usually present throughout the year. Its native range extends from the central coast of New South Wales to southern Queensland. Description Epacris longiflora is an erect to spreading shrub which grows to a height of and has stems with prominent short, broad leaf scars. The leaves are egg-shaped, long, wide with a pointed tip. The leaves are thin, flat and have margins with minute teeth. The flowers are red with a white tip, sometimes all red and have a peduncle up to long. There are five petals which are fused to form a tube with five lobes at the end. The tube is long, in diameter and the lobes are long. At the base of the petal tube there are whorls of bracts and five sepals long. Within the petal tube there is a central style with the stigma at its tip and an ovary at its base. The stamens are hidden inside the tube. Flowering occurs throughout the year, although there are fewer flowers in summer. The fruits are capsules long containing small, light seeds. Taxonomy and naming Epacris longiflora was first formally described by Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles in 1797 and the description was published in Icones et descriptiones plantarum. The specific epithet (longiflora) is derived from the Latin words longus meaning \\"long\\" or \\"extended\\" and flos meaning \\"flower\\". One vernacular name is cigarette flower, from the pattern on the flower. Distribution and habitat Fuchsia heath is found on the coast and tablelands north from Berry and as far as south-eastern Queensland. It grows in sandy soil on cliff faces, in heath to woodland margins and in dry sclerophyll forest. Ecology Plants are thought to live 5‚Äì20 years in the wild. Use in horticulture A highly regarded ornamental garden plant, E. longiflora was first cultivated in England in 1803. It grows in a variety of soils as long as the drainage is good, and does best in a partly shaded position. Along with other members of the genus, Epacris longiflora initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.

Some professional guidelines recommend prophylactic calcium and vitamin D supplementation in patients who take the equivalent of more than 30 mg hydrocortisone (7.5 mg of prednisolone), especially when this is in excess of three months. The use of thiazide diuretics, and gonadal hormone replacement has also been recommended, with the use of calcitonin, bisphosphonates, sodium fluoride or anabolic steroids also suggested in refractory cases.

Retrieved on 26 March 2009 * Direct inhibition of osteoblast function * Direct enhancement of bone resorption * Inhibition of gastrointestinal calcium absorption * Increased urine calcium loss * Inhibition of sex steroids The combination of these changes leads to drug-induced nutrient depletion. Prednisone moderately depletes calcium, vitamin D, chromium and magnesium. This explains why the professional guidelines recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Diagnosis The diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made using conventional radiography and by measuring the bone mineral density (BMD). The most popular method of measuring BMD is Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In addition to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes; this may be done with blood tests. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone, multiple myeloma, Cushing's disease and other above-mentioned causes may be performed.

In Russian Orthodox tradition he is often referred as the Servant to Seraphim and the Theotokos. Motovilov was born in Simbirsk to a noble family, and graduated from Kazan University. According to his notes, he once tried to commit suicide by drowning in Chyornoye Lake near Kazan, but was stopped by an apparition of the Theotokos, whom he claimed to have led him throughout the remainder of his life. Motovilov became acquainted with Saint Seraphim of Sarov and became one of his disciples. Cover of Motovilov's book Serafim's Discourse On the Purpose of the Christian Life shows how the event is usually depicted in the modern icon tradition Motovilov wrote down many of his conversations with St. Seraphim, including his favorite, Seraphim's Talk On the Purpose of the Christian Life, that occurred in November 1831 in the forest near Sarov. This event has been depicted in several different icons of St. Seraphim, and is considered one of modern Orthodoxy's most important spiritual treasures. In 1827 Motovilov started government work in Simbirsk. He had a conflict with Freemasons there, and was arrested and imprisoned in 1832 on trumped-up charges. Motovilov later claimed that these charges were fabricated by his Freemason enemies, including Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov. In 1833, Motovilov was released from prison by order of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia,Letter of Motovilov to Nicholas I of Russia but lost all chances for employment with the government thereafter. In 1840 Motovilov married Yelena Ivanovna Meliukova, the niece of a pupil of St. Seraphim, schemo-nun Marfa, and settled down on his estate near Simbirsk.–†–µ–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å –≤–µ—Ä—ã –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–π by Viktor Trostnikov Here he worked ceaselessly to glorify the name of Seraphim, who had died in 1833. Motovilov wrote numerous letters to important personages, including the Emperor himself, endeavoring to demonstrate the depths of Seraphim's prophetic gift and philosophy. He also organized large business ventures such as the Svyato-Preobrazhensky Bank, assisting in the migration of \\"millions of peasants\\" from Central Russia to Siberia.

He died in 1879, and was buried at Serafimo-Diveyevsky Monastery. Seraphim of Sarov, whose name Motovilov had worked so hard to bring to Russian public awareness, was canonized in 1903. He remains one of the modern Orthodox Church's most beloved saints. Motovilov's manuscripts were mostly left unpublished, and were stored in disarray in baskets kept in the attic of his house. In 1903 Motovilov's widow passed the baskets with the manuscripts‚Äîby now filled with feathers and chicken droppings‚Äîto the religious writer Sergei Nilus. Nilus eventually found a way to decipher the materials and published them.

History  The Game Connection history began in 2001, when Pierre Carde, former Director of Lyon Game and now CEO of Connection Events, decided to set up a convention for the gaming industry with the objective of doing business. The first convention took place in Lyon on December 2001 and attracted 27 French developers and 20 international publishers. From that moment on, Game Connection Europe brought together an increasing number of companies, representing today a total of about 45 countries. This success led Game Connection to sign a partnership with the Game Developers Conference in 2004, a deal which brought the convention to the Silicon Valley, giving birth to Game Connection America. Since then, California became the second location of Game Connection, at first welcoming the event in San Jose and then in San Francisco. Today Game Connection is no longer affiliated with GDC for its American edition, but it continues to grow in terms of participants. This pushed Connection Events, the event organizer, to expand its offer by adding to its traditional B2B formula a full set of conferences and master classes.  Locations  Game Connection takes place in two different locations at two different times of the year. * Game Connection Europe is held in Paris (France) during the fall, after having been set in Lyon for 10 years. * Game Connection America is held in San Francisco (USA) during the spring.  The Online Meeting System  Before the event, all attendees register on the Game Connection website. Through the online meeting system, participants can learn about each other's company projects and interests; search through the database, ask questions, send meeting requests and much more. This means meetings are only scheduled when both parties are interested, thus increasing the efficiency of the event and the probability that the right business partners will be found. On the website, developers can display their projects to give publishers an idea of what they will be presenting at the convention. During the event, each exhibitor (game seller or service provider) has a closed booth in which to make presentations to buyers during half-hour meetings. Depending on individual schedules, companies can feasibly conduct up to 40 meetings in three days.  The Selected Projects program  The Selected Projects program is designed to shed light on the most innovative and creative projects that the industry offers and gives additional exposure to its nominees. The program started in 2008 under the name of \\"Level-up\\" and it was an exclusive of Game Connection Europe. In 2010 it was renamed Selected Projects and today is part of Game Connection America, as well. Developers are invited to submit console, mobile and online games at any stage of development. The top 15 Selected Projects receive a free entrance to the convention, special rates on any exhibitor option, a five-minute presentation of their projects to high-level publishers and the chance to be named ‚ÄúBest Project of the Year‚Äù.  Connection Events  Connection Events is the organizer of Game Connection. Created in July 2006, the company is a spin- off of Lyon Game, a non-profit organization which initially launched Game Connection Europe, however closed its doors in 2009. Through the years, Connection Events has developed a true expertise in the video games industry that led to being given the charge of organizing the Lyon Game Developers Conference, the first French edition of the original GDC held yearly in California as well as the Paris GDC Game Developers Conference, the first of which took place in Paris on June 23‚Äì24, 2008. Since then, Connection Events has focused on the organization of Game Connection Europe and Game Connection America, as well as of other events such as the Serious Game Expo, property of the cluster Imaginove. Since 2007, Connection Events has also developed an expertise in Master Classes which have taken place in Lyon and Paris. With a 20-person limit per training session, these master classes are designed for video game professionals who want to develop their skills in different domains in a concrete way: production, arts, game design, programming and business. Among other professionals, Mike Acton from Insomniac Games, Christophe Balestra from Naughty Dog, Thomas Bideaux, Noah Falstein, Clinton Keith, and Doug Mealy have shared their skills during these master classes.

First, the rural character of the Romanian communities resulted in an exceptionally vital and creative traditional culture. Folk creations (the best known is the ballad Miori»õa) were the main literary genre until the 18th century. They were both a source of inspiration for cultivated creators and a structural model. Second, for a long time learned culture was governed by official and social commands and developed around courts of princes and boyars, as well as in monasteries. Overview=Creation of the world Stories suggest God made the earth with the help of animals, while Satan was trying to thwart his plans.Cosma, Aurel. Cosmogonia poporului rom√¢n (The Cosmogony of the Romanian People) (1942). Bucharest: Tipografia Ziarului \\"Universul\\".Leeming, David Adams. Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, 2010. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 17 Sept. 2012. In the majority of versions, before the earth existed, a boundless ocean called Apa S√¢mbetei was the abode of God and the Devil, seen as master and servant rather than equals. In these stories the Devil goes by the name \\"Nefartatul\\" and is the somewhat foolish brother of God in folk versions of stories. These stories appear not only in Romanian folklore, but also in those of Aromanian, Slavic Macedonian and Bulgarian folklore. Upon deciding to create the earth, God sent the Devil to bring a handful of clay from the ground of the World Ocean in his holy name. The Devil set forth and tried to bring it to the surface in his name instead, but could not succeed until he brought it up in the name of God. As this piece of clay grew into the earth, God laid himself down to sleep. The Devil tried to push him over the side, but the ever-expanding earth would hinder that. After trying to throw God off the earth in every one of the four cardinal directions, he shied away from the cross he drew in the ground himself. Origin of evil Other accounts, closer to the biblical one, suggest that the Devil and his demons were once angels of God. The Devil, however, tried to rebel, and, in response, God opened up the heavens so that he might fall to the earth. Fearing that Heaven might be voided, the archangel Michael re-sealed it, thus freezing the demons that had not yet fallen to hell in place. This is related to the concept of soul customs, where every soul is intercepted on its way to heaven by these demons, who force it into hell. It has also given rise to the Romanian saying p√¢nƒÉ ajungi la Dumnezeu, te mƒÉn√¢ncƒÉ sfin≈£ii (\\"before you reach God, the saints will eat you\\"). Origin of God Another question commonly addressed is that of the origin of God, which is explained in a Russian doll-type fashion; before every God there was another God that created him. Thus explaining the many names the Bible used for God, the Oltenians believed the first God was called Sabaoth, followed by Amon, Apollo, the Creator God of the Bible and, finally, Jesus Christ. Origin of race This is identified as the source of the expression a se √ÆngƒÉlbeni de fricƒÉ (to go yellow with fear), which can also be found in various forms in the folklore of other peoples. The Earth Even after Christian imagery and symbolism became part of Romanian culture, Mother Earth is identified as the consort of God, the heavenly Father. The origin of mountains is explained in a number of ways by the cultures of the different regions of Romania. One account is that mountains formed as a response to God demanding the Earth to nurture all life, to which the earth shuddered and brought forth mountains. Another version suggests the Earth was too large to fit under the firmament, and so God attempted to shrink it, thus raising mountains. Often, these accounts are accompanied by the imagery of one or several World Pillars, which sustain the earth from below and are usually placed beneath mountains. Earthquakes are frequently attributed to the earth slipping due to the Devil's constant gnawing at these pillars, which are rebuilt by God and his angels in times of fasting. The myth of the Blajini The etymology of the word blajin (adj.) is the Slavonian bla≈æƒïn≈≠ meaning kind, well-minding person.DEX, Romanian Academy Publishing House, Bucharest, 1998, According to Christian calendar, Romanians from Banat, Transilvania, Bucovina and Maramure»ô counties celebrate Easter of Blajini on first Monday after St. Thomas Sunday. Easter of Blajini is called also Easter of Deaths or Mighty Easter. Romanians generally perceived the earth as a disc, and they imagined what existed on the other side. This other earth is imagined as a mirror image of our own, and as a home to creatures called Blajini (\\"gentle/kind-hearted ones\\"), sometimes given the name Rohmani in Bucovina. They are described as anthropomorphic and short, sometimes having the head of a rat. They are either described as malicious or as having great respect for God and leading a sinless life. They are considered to fast the year through, and thus doing humans a great service. The Romanian holiday Pa≈ütele Blajinilor (Easter of Blajini) is a way to repay them for the benefits they bring. Since they live in isolation, they have no way of knowing when Easter comes. It is for this reason that Romanians eat dyed eggs and let the shells flow downstream, from there they believe they will get to the Apa S√¢mbetei, and from there to the Blajini. Blajini are invisible connectors between Inner and Hollow Earth. Blajin also means a dead child who did not receive the benediction of Holy Spirit. The ethnograph Marian Simion Florea wrote : Blajini are fictitious beings, incarnations of dead children not baptized who live at the end of Earth, nearby The Holy water (of Saturday).Marian Simion Florea, Cultural Romanian Foundation Publishing House, Bucharest 1994 Some explain them as the descendants of Adam's son Seth. Others think that they used to live alongside humans on the earth, but Moses, seeing his people oppressed by them, split the waters and, after he and his people had retreated to safety, poured the waters back onto them, sending them to their current abode. For celebrating the souls of dead relatives or friends, Romanians from above mentioned counties prepare festive meals and offer them, in the cemetery, nearby the tombs, after the religious mass and benediction, to all who wished to commemorate and pay their respects to the dead. They cheer up in memory of the deceased. Eschatology The most prominent symbol associated with the End Times is that of the earthquake. Waters overflowing and mountains collapsing are both linked to these earthquakes, which are mainly caused by lack of faith, which accelerates the crumbling of the World Pillars. Others attribute the earthquakes to the earth (which is alive, and can therefore feel) realising the wicked ways of humans, and trembling in fright. Other rare natural phenomena such as Eclipses or Comets were seen as a sign of impending doom. If these warnings should fail, God will initiate the End of the World. Such imagery as a darkened sun, a bleeding moon and falling stars are associated with the beginning of the End Times. Three saints (usually in the persons of Enoch, John and Elijah) are said to come to earth to unveil the Devil's attempts to destroy the world, whereupon they shall be killed by decapitation. The sky and the earth will be set alight and the earth will be purged, so that its Creator may descend upon it. The 12 winds are said to sweep up the ashes of people and gather them in the valley of Safed, where the Last Judgement shall be done. Sources form Moldova and Bucovina also speak of a great army led by the emperor Constantine, which will conquer all the world's states, and kill everyone save for a few pure ones, which will then repopulate the earth. In another instance, should this army not come, God shall burn the earth as described and bring the Blajini to live there. In another version, true to the succession of Gods mentioned earlier (s. here), Jesus Christ is said to come and create a new world like his father before him. A not-so-widespread belief is that of a definitive destruction of the earth, whereupon God and the Devil shall divide the souls of the dead among themselves and retire to the moon, who is considered to have been made in the image of the earth to serve a place of retreat after the destruction of the earth. Characteristics Strong folk traditions have survived to this day due to the rural character of the Romanian communities, which has resulted in an exceptionally vital and creative traditional culture. Romania's rich folk traditions have been nourished by many sources, some of which predate the Roman occupation. Traditional folk arts include wood carving, ceramics, weaving and embroidery of costumes, household decorations, dance, and richly varied folk music. Ethnographers have tried to collect in the last two centuries as many elements as possible: the Museum of the Romanian Peasant and the Romanian Academy are currently the main institutions which systematically organise the data and continue the research. Wood used to be the main construction material, and heavily ornamented wooden objects were common in old houses. In Maramure»ô, wood was used to create impressive structures such as churches or gates; in Dobruja, windmills were made of wood, and in mountainous regions hardwood was used even for covering the roof. To preserve traditional houses, many village museums have been created in the last century throughout Romania,Michael Hitchcock (1998): Tourism, Tam An Mini, and national identity, Indonesia and the Malay World, 26:75, 124-135: 129 such as the Village Museum in Bucharest, the Traditional Popular Civilisation ASTRA Museum in Sibiu or the Oltenian Village Museum in R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea. 200px 200px 200px Linen was the most common material for clothing, combined with wool during the winter or colder periods. These are embroidered with traditional motifs that vary from region to region. Black is the most common colour used, but red and blue are predominant in certain areas. Traditionally, men wore a white shirt and pants (if made of wool they are called i≈£ari) with a wide leather belt, usually over the shirt, and a vest sometimes made of leather and embroidered. They wore either boots or a simple shoe made of leather and tied around the foot called opincƒÉ and they wore a hat which differs in design from region to region. Women also wore a white skirt and a shirt with a vest. They wore an apron called ≈üor≈£ or cƒÉtrin≈£ƒÉ which is also embroidered and a headscarf called basma;on special occasions they wore more elaborate outfits. Music and dance represent a lively part of the Romanian folklore and there are a great variety of musical genres and dances. Party music is very lively and shows both Balkan and Hungarian influences. Sentimental music, however, is the most valued, and Romanians consider their doina (a sad song either about one's home or about love, composed like an epic ballad) unique in the world. Maria TƒÉnase is considered to be one of the greatest Romanian folk singers and today Grigore Le≈üe and Taraful Haiducilor are two of the most famous musicians. The dances are lively and are practiced throughout Romania by a large number of professional and amateur groups, thus keeping the tradition alive; Hora is one of the most famous group dances but men's folk dances such as cƒÉlu≈üari are extremely complex and have been declared by UNESCO to be \\"Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritages of Humanity\\". Romanians have had, from time immemorial, a myriad of customs, tales and poems about love, faith, kings, princesses, and witches. Ethnologists, poets, writers and historians have tried in recent centuries to collect and to preserve tales, poems, ballads and have tried to describe as well as possible the customs and habits related to different events and times of year. Customs related to certain times of year are the colinde - Romanian Christmas carols, sorcova on New Year's Eve or the MƒÉr≈£i≈üor custom on the 1st of March marking the spring. Other customs are presumably of pre-Christian pagan origin, like the Paparuda rain enchanting custom in the summer, or the masked folk theatre or Ursul (the bear) and Capra (the goat) in winter. Perhaps the most successful collector of folk tales was the novelist and storyteller Ion CreangƒÉ, who, in very picturesque language, shaped into their now-classic form stories like Harap Alb (roughly, \\"The White Moor¬¥¬¥) or Fata babei ≈üi fata mo≈üului (\\"The old woman's daughter and the old man's daughter\\"). Also, the poet Vasile Alecsandri published the most successful version of the ballad Miori≈£a (The Little Ewe), a sad, philosophical poem, centered on a simple action: the plot by two shepherds to kill a third shepherd because they envied his wealth. Another prolific editor of folk tales was Petre Ispirescu, who, in the 19th century published an impressive number of volumes containing a large number of short novels and tales from popular mythology. They are centered on popular characters like the prince FƒÉt-Frumos (the Romanian \\"Prince Charming\\"), the princess Ileana Cos√¢nzeana, the villain or monster Zmeu or CƒÉpcƒÉun, the dragon Balaur or fantastic superbeings like the good Z√¢nƒÉ and the evil Muma PƒÉdurii.'''

For a long time these qualities were not known to the world outside. Orientalists such as Max Mueller, Keith and even Edwin Arnold identified the literature of India with Sanskrit only. It is this neglect of Tamil in the British period that motivated a meeting of Tamil scholars at Thanjavur to consider starting a university for the development and growth Tamil in August, 1925. But, perhaps due to the lack of patronage from the government, the plan did not materialise.

It is also a country with deep rooted Buddhist beliefs. The contemporary art scene in the country reflects these facts, and the art is often related to Buddhism and the difficult socio- political situation. In this age of globalization, Burmese contemporary art has developed rather on its own terms.  History  One of the first to study western art was Ba Nyan. Together with Ngwe Gaing and a handful of other artists, they were pioneers of western painting style in Burma. Later, most of the students learnt from masters through apprenticeship. Some well known contemporary artists are mentioned below. Lun Gywe (born 1930)U Lun Gywe ‚Äî A Master Painter from Myanmar. Thavibu Gallery, 2005. . is the undisputed old master of Burmese painting. He has been the mentor of many younger generations of artists. Lun Gywe is a master with colours, often in an impressionistic manner, and is particularly fond of painting the beauty of women. His works are represented in the National Museum of Myanmar and the National Art Gallery of Malaysia.  Art spaces  Artists  Aung Kyaw Htet (born 1965) is a devout Buddhist who grew up in a small village‚Äîtwo factors which have a strong influence on his art. His paintings of religious life in Burma show monks and nuns in a realistic manner, though non-essential objects are omitted from the paintings to focus on the religious aspects. Aung Kyaw Htet paints the faces of monks and nuns in great detail to show their humanity. His works are represented in the National Museum of Myanmar and the National Art Gallery of Malaysia. Four additional artists who were found worthy to have their works included in the permanent collection of the National Art Gallery of Malaysia (the country's contemporary art museum) are MPP Yei Myint, Myint Swe, Min Wai Aung and Aung Myint. The younger generation of upcoming international contemporary artists include Nyein Chan Su and The Maw Naing and the Gangaw Village Artist Group. Now there are many contemporary artists such as Po Po. Po Po (born 1957) lives and works in Yangon. He studied art himself (he describes himself as self-taught) and works with various media especially with installation works. He has staged solo exhibitions since 1987; they include ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù and ‚ÄúSolid Concept‚Äù among others. He participated in the Kwangju Biennale 2000, the Flying Circus Project 2004 and Yokohama Triennale 2005. Wah Nu was born in Yangon in 1977, and launched herself on an artistic career after graduating from the University of Culture, Yangon in 1998 where she majored in music. Since then she has developed a personal expression by mainly adopting painting and video as media. In 2004, she held the exhibition ‚ÄúCloud Department‚Äù in Yangon. That is her first solo exhibition and then 2005, ‚ÄúSelf- Identity‚Äù second in gallery Art-U room,Wah Nu , Art-U room. Tokyo, Japan. She showed in group exhibitions including Bangladesh Biennale 2004, Fukuoka Triennale 20053rd Fukuoka Triennale 2005, Fukuoka, Japan, 2005. and Another Seven Artists in Yangon 2008. Recently, she participate in The 6th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art in Brisbane with her husband, artist, Tun Win Aung, who works in multimedia installations and performance arts. Most of the young artists who were born in the 1980s have greater chances of art practises inside and outside the country. Performance art is a popular genre among Burmese young artists. Aung Ko, Moe Satt, Mrat Lunn Htwann and Nyan Lin Htet are some of the promising artists. Among them, Nyan Lin Htet started making performance art works in early 2000s and later he joined the contemporary theatre group Annees Folles for intensive theatre training with Japanese theatre director Arata Kitamura in Japan. Since 2005, Lin Htet has been actively involved in international performance art and theatre scenes. After founding the Yangon-based experimental theatre group Theatre of the Disturbed in 2005, Lin Htet directed theatrical adaptations of dramatic and literary works by Samuel Beckett, Eug√®ne Ionesco and Franz Kafka as well as dramatic works by local playwrights including himself. In 2007, he was awarded the 2-year Artist-in-residency programme at the Cit√© internationale des arts in Paris with the support of Alliance Fran√ßaise de Rangoun and Ministry of Foreign Affairs-France. Lin Htet has been recognized not only as the most promising Burmese contemporary theatre artist but as one of the few promoters of contemporary Burmese art and theatre. He is currently based in Europe.

Early life Born in Saskatchewan, Canada, he was baptised into a Presbyterian family. His mother was involved with a holiness church and following his father‚Äôs conversion they went into classical Pentecostalism. Their city was visited by a Scandinavian itinerant minister with a \\"signs and wonders\\" approach to Christianity. While in the Baxter‚Äôs home city, he taught on the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Ern Baxter‚Äôs mother was the first in those meetings to receive the \\"baptism of power.\\" Baxter recalled seeing his father help her into the house drunk in the Spirit. Later in his teenage years, Baxter went through a period where he lost his faith in reaction to the legalism of religion and became seriously ill from pneumonia. Two events brought him back to Christianity ‚Äì a miracle of healing and the words of a friend: \\"Ern, being a Christian isn‚Äôt about what you do for God, it‚Äôs about what God in Christ Jesus has done and will continue to do for you\\". Ministry On 24 May 1932, he entered full-time ministry as a musician travelling across Canada with a missionary. While travelling, Baxter and his companion came to a conference held in Trossachs in Canada. There Ern Baxter received the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Trossachs was an unusual conference as the delegates were not Pentecostal in the classic sense ‚Äì they were seeking the experience of the Holy Spirit. This was Ern‚Äôs first exposure to what was to become a central passion in his life and ministry ‚Äì Word and Spirit or Reformed doctrine and charismatic life and power. The morning after he had been baptised in the Holy Spirit, he said God spoke to him and called him to the ministry saying, \\"I want you to preach My Word\\". In 1947, Baxter attended a service in Winnipeg where William Branham was speaking.New Wine Interviews Ern Baxter, New Wine Magazine, December 1978 Branham later spoke in Vancouver at meetings that were led by Baxter. Subsequent to the meetings, Branham approached Baxter and told him that he had been praying and the angel of the Lord had spoken to him and told him to invite Ern Baxter to become his companion in ministry. Baxter left Branham sometime in 1953 or 1954, primarily because Branham was starting to preach things that Baxter felt were \\"seriously wrong\\".New Wine Interviews Ern Baxter, New Wine Magazine, December 1978, p.23 Ern Baxter had a major influence not just in the United States but also across the world, particularly in Australia and the United Kingdom. He came to the United Kingdom in 1975 and preached keynote addresses at the main charismatic conferences ‚Äì the Lakes and Dales Bible Weeks. Professor Andrew Walker wrote of \\"the powerful influence of an American, Ern Baxter\\" because of his influence on the British New Church Movement. The Bible Weeks were run by UK charismatic leader Bryn Jones and his team of churches. Andrew Walker wrote, \\"Baxter‚Äôs influence was sensational; the audiences went wild every time he appeared ... during the first Bible Week at the Great Yorkshire Showground in 1976, Baxter was the great attraction and as in the previous year excitement was at fever pitch\\". Baxter‚Äôs ministry did not just affect Bryn Jones‚Äô churches. Terry Virgo, the father of the Newfrontiers family of churches wrote, \\"Ern Baxter was a powerful prophetic preacher, able to paint a huge picture of the magnificent end-time church. He was deeply rooted theologically, very widely read but also profoundly steeped in a powerful Pentecostal background ... the influence of Ern Baxter and his friends was growing even greater in the USA and their monthly magazine New Wine became their radical trumpet voice was now being read all around the world\\". Baxter did not limit himself to being a conference speaker. He believed in the principles of discipleship and took on 12 pastors to mentor and support where he could. Each of these men would travel over to meet him in his home, firstly in Mobile, Alabama, and then in San Diego, California, to spend time hearing him teach. He travelled as much as his health would allow, supporting and visiting his \\"sons\\" and their churches. He did not only teach from his experience but from a massive library of 9,000 plus books and journals that are now housed in a Memorial Library in Mobile, Alabama under the auspices of Charles Simpson Ministries. By the end of his life, Baxter was taking an interest in imparting all that he had learned to younger men ‚Äì his \\"Timothys\\". \\"Ern has a profound preaching and teaching ministry. He is a preacher‚Äôs preacher. It is important that the taped and printed records of his ministry be preserved and propagated\\".Charles Simpson, New Wine Magazine November 1986 Baxter is possibly best known for being part of what was called the Shepherding Movement, an influential and controversial expression of the charismatic renewal in the 1970s and 1980s. Its emphasis on submission to a personal pastor, or \\"shepherd\\" as the movement termed it, brought accusations of authoritarianism.Moore, S.

Dedicated to Saint Th√©r√®se de Lisieux, the church is classified as a diocesan shrine governed by the Military Ordinariate of the Philippines. History The Shrine began in 1947 as a makeshift chapel in Nichols Air Base (now Villamor Air Base) constructed by Rev Jos√© Alberto, the first military chaplain assigned to the Philippine Air Force. Originally dedicated to Michael the Archangel, it was expanded several times to meet the spiritual needs of the increasing numbers of Philippine Air Force servicemen. After undergoing major renovations in the 1980s, it was consecrated on 16 December 1983 and dedicated to Saint Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus by Archbishop Bruno Torpigliani, then-Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines. The Shrine was spared destruction during privatisation of some parts of Villamor Air Base under President Joseph Estrada, in a memorandum signed on 10 April 2000,Cf. Deed of Usufruct of Lot 6 of Swo-007605-00162-D in Favor of the Military Ordinariate of the Philippines dated 9 November 2000. and by the deed of usufruct granted to the Military Ordinariate of the Philippines by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority on 9 November 2000 during the chairmanship of Rogelio L. Singson.Cf. Ibid. After the visit of the pilgrim relics of St Th√©r√®se in 2000, the Shrine again underwent a major reconstruction initiated by the reigning Ordinary, Archbishop Ramon C. Arguelles, to promote the saint's spirituality and to encourage devotion to the \\"Millennium Saint\\" amongst servicemen. From 8 March 2005, this project continued towards its completion under a new Ordinary, Most Rev Leopoldo S. Tumulak. On 6 January 2007, Archbishop of Manila Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales approved the request of Bishop Tumulak to hold liturgical services for the Military Ordinariate in the Shrine, which was collocated within the territory of the Archdiocese of Manila.Cf. Letter of Cardinal Rosales to Bishop Leopoldo Tumulak, dated 6 January 2007. The newly refurbished Shrine was consecrated and rededicated to St Th√©r√®se on 17 May 2007. The presider at the consecration service was Archbishop of Cebu Ricardo Cardinal Vidal, while among the other co-celebrating bishops was Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines President, Archbishop √Ångel Lagdameo.The other Bishops present during the consecration of St. Therese Diocesan Shrine were Bishop Gabriel Reyes of Antipolo; Bishop Bernardino Cortez-Auxiliary Bishop of Manila; Bishop Antonio Galang of San Jose, Mindoro; and Bishop John Du of Dumaguete. Also on that day-the 82nd anniversary of the canonisation of St. Th√©r√®se‚Äìthe church was declared a Diocesan Shrine of the Ordinariate by Bishop Tumulak. Present at the service were President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who unveiled the historical marker; high officials of the Department of National Defense; and the top brass of the Armed Forces, Police and other uniformed services under the canonical jurisdiction of the Military Ordinariate.

The film won the Prix du sc√©nario at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, was Germany's entry in the category Best Foreign Language Film at the 2007 Oscars, but was not nominated. After making its worldwide debut at the Cannes Film Festival in France, the film was shown at several international film festivals. It was released in Germany on 27 September 2007. Plot ;Yeter's Death Retired widower Ali Aksu (Tuncel Kurtiz), a Turkish immigrant living in the German city of Bremen, believes he has found a solution to his loneliness when he meets Yeter √ñzt√ºrk (Nursel K√∂se). He offers her a monthly payment to stop working as a prostitute and move in with him. After receiving threats from two Turkish Muslims for the work she does, she decides to accept his offer. Ali's son, Nejat Aksu (Baki Davrak), a professor of German literature, does not have time to respond to the prospect of living with a woman of \\"easy virtue\\" before Ali is stricken with a heart attack. He softens to her: he learns that she has told her 27-year-old daughter she is a shoe saleswoman, sending shoes to her in Turkey to support that story, and wishes her daughter could receive an education like his. Back home from the hospital, Ali suspects Yeter and his son may have had a liaison. When his drunken demands of Yeter cause her to threaten to leave, he strikes her and she dies from the blow. Ali is sent to prison. Nejat travels to Istanbul to search for Yeter's daughter, Ayten (Nurg√ºl Ye≈üil√ßay), and assumes responsibility for her education. Unable to locate her through her family and not having any recent photos of her, he posts flyers with Yeter's photo throughout the area, in hope that it will lead to the daughter. When he posts a flyer in a small German language bookstore that happens to be for sale, he finds himself charmed into buying it. ;Lotte's Death A plainclothes officer loses his gun on the street during a riot. A hooded figure scoops it up and is pursued on foot by a battalion of uniformed officers, barely managing to hide the contraband on a random rooftop. This is Ayten, member of a Turkish anti-government resistance group. When her cell is raided, she flees Turkey and takes up a new identity with political allies in Bremen, Germany. However, even there, she has a falling out when she is unable to pay them money she owes, and thus finds herself on the street with barely a euro to her name. Her mother's number is lost, so she lives illegally and searches for her in local shoe shops. Lotte, a university student, offers to help her with food, clothes, and a place to stay‚Äîa gesture which is not particularly welcomed by her mother, Susanne. Ayten and Lotte become lovers and Lotte decides to help Ayten search for her mother. The quest is cut short when a traffic stop exposes Ayten's illegal status and she attempts a claim of political asylum. Despite Susanne's financial support, Germany rules that Ayten has no legitimate fear of political persecution. She is deported and immediately imprisoned. Lotte is devastated. She travels to Turkey to try to free Ayten, but quickly realizes how little hope there is, as she is facing 15 to 20 years in jail. Susanne pleads with her to think of her future and return home. When Lotte refuses, her mother denies her any further assistance. Lotte gravitates to Nejat's bookstore and ends up renting a spare room from him. Finally granted a prison visit with Ayten, Lotte complies with her imprisoned lover's request and retrieves the handgun Ayten grabbed in the riot. But Lotte's bag, with the gun inside, is snatched by a crew of boys that she then chases through their neighborhood. When finally she finds them in a vacant lot, one of them is inspecting the gun. She demands he return it, but he points it at her and fires, killing her instantly. ;The Edge of Heaven (literally, On the Other Side) Upon his release, Ali is deported to Turkey, returning to his property in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast. After her daughter's death, Susanne goes to Istanbul to see where her daughter had been living the past few months. She meets Nejat and reads her daughter's diary; she decides to take on her daughter's mission of freeing Ayten from prison. Susanne's visit to Ayten‚Äîan offer of forgiveness and support‚Äîleads the younger woman to exercise her right of repentance. As a result, she wins her freedom. Susanne asks Nejat about the story behind a Bayram festival they hear about, learning that it commemorates Ibrahim's sacrifice of his son Ishmael. She comments that there is the same story in the Bible, where Abraham is asked to sacrifice his son Isaac. Nejat reminisces about being scared by the story as a child and asking his father if he would sacrifice him if God told him to. When asked by Susanne what his father's answer was, Nejat tells her that his father said \\"He would make God his enemy in order to protect me.\\" Nejat removes the flyer of Yeter from the shop's noticeboard. He asks Susanne to look after his shop while he is gone, and drives to Trabzon, where his father is living. Susanne offers Ayten a place to stay with her at Nejat's house. When Nejat arrives in Trabzon, his father is out fishing, so he waits for him on the beach. CastProduction Filming took place in Bremen and Hamburg, Germany; at Taksim and Kadƒ±k√∂y in Istanbul; and on the Black Sea coast in Trabzon, Turkey.

Early life and educational career Noel Da Costa was born on December 24, 1929 Lagos, Nigeria to parents from Kingston, Jamaica, who were Salvation Army missionaries. After returning to Jamaica while Da Costa was young, they emigrated to New York City, living in Harlem. While in High School, he was inspired by one of his teachers to work in an artistic field. Da Costa completed his Bachelor's at Queens College in 1952 and his Master's in theory and composition at Columbia University in 1956, studying with Otto Luening and Jack Beeson. He studied with Luigi Dallapiccola in Florence, Italy under a Fulbright Fellowship, and shortly thereafter in 1961 took positions teaching at Hampton University and the City University of New York. In 1970 he accepted a position at Rutgers University, where he taught until 2001. He died the following year at the age of 72.

He also worked with choral groups, becoming the director of the Triad Choral in 1974, and played with both Symphony of the New World and several orchestras on Broadway theatre productions. Da Costa's works are marked by an infusion of elements of jazz, Caribbean music, and African music into the framework of Western classical music. The New York Times has described his music as \\"conservatively chromatic.\\" Among DaCosta's notable students is Nkeiru Okoye.

Popularly believed to have been the first ever female passenger in an airplane, she may also have been the first woman to pilot an aircraft. A friend of fellow sculptor Leon Delagrange, when he became interested in aviation Peltier soon followed. Early life and career Th√©r√®se Peltier was born the daughter of a liquor distiller on September 26, 1873 in Orl√©ans Loiret, France. In 1893, she married Marine doctor Alfred Peltier of Paris, where she would reside for most of her life. Peltier began to take sculpture lessons and exhibit in numerous salons. In 1908 she received the sculpture prize from the Union of Women Painters and Sculptors, which was the first society of female artists in France. Peltier specialized in wax sculpture and was included along with Delagrange and a group of other wax sculptors in a 1902 profile in The Literary Digest. Aviation On 8 July 1908 in Turin, Peltier flew as a passenger with Delagrange for a distance of 200 metres (656 feet). She is widely believed to have been the first female passenger on an airplane; however Henri Farman is reported to have flown or tried to fly with a Mlle P. Van Pottelsberghe in Ghent, Belgium in late May. Delagrange taught Peltier how to fly his Voisin 1907 biplane and she completed a number of solo flights, although she never earned her pilot's license. After a few training sessions, she flew alone for the first time in Issy-le- Moulineaux. The feat was recounted in L‚ÄôA√©rophile: Also in 1908, Peltier accompanied Delagrange on his successful record attempt for flight duration, during which he flew 30 minutes and 28 seconds. She also joined him on a series of Italian flight exhibitions in Turin and Rome, which she reported on for the French newspapers. During this tour, she made a solo flight of 200 metres at a height of 2.5 metres (7 feet) at the Military Square in Turin. The date of this flight is unknown, but it was reported in the weekly Italian magazine L'Illustrazione Italiana as 27 September 1908. In late 1908, Delagrange offered a prize of 100 francs for the first woman aviator to pilot a plane for one kilometer. Peltier reportedly began training to compete for the prize, but when Delagrange died in an airplane accident, on 4 January 1910 at Bordeaux, she left aviation forever. She wrote to Henri Deutsch-de-la Meurthe: Death Peltier died in Paris on February 18, 1926.

Morphology Anisoceratid shells begin as an irregular helical spiral which typically becomes confined to a single plane with growth. This is usually followed by at least a single straight shaft. Ribs and tubercles are common features. History and classification Older classifications, since first publication of Part L of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, include the Anisoceratidae in the suborder Ancyloceratina (within the Turrilitoidea). Subsequent study, e.g. Beznosov & Mikhailova 1983, has suggested that the Turrilitoidea, including the Anisoceratidae, have a different phylogeny from the true Ancyloceratina, resulting in their occasional reassignment to a separate suborder, the Turrilitina, however this classification is not widely followed.

In contrast to binoculars, it does not allow stereoscopic viewing, as both images are produced by the same objective and do not differ except for aberrations induced by the binoviewer itself. However, binocular viewing allows the brain's visual system to make use of binocular summation, resulting in a more relaxed viewing experience and an increased ability of detecting faint details. A binoviewer consists of a beam splitter which splits the image provided by the objective into two identical (but fainter) copies, and a system of prisms or mirrors that relay the images to a pair of identical eyepieces.

The series followed the lives of three incompetent and untrustworthy estate agents working at the fictional Embassy Properties in south London, and the often corrupt dealings of their entrepreneurial boss, Tony. The series was produced off the back of a one-off sketch from the Channel 4 sketch show, Comedy Lab. The programme was never made available on DVD, but is currently available to view on All 4. Only the one series was ever made. Characters * Mark England (Cliff Kelly) is smartly dressed, and tries to conduct business in a friendly, professional manner. It is assumed that Mark is gay, as in one episode he sleeps with a male customer, who turns out to have a wife and children. Mark often assumes the position of team manager, and is often referred to by Jerry as a 'lanky goon'. * Mark Devlin (Adam G. Goodwin) is portrayed as down-on-his-luck, and is subjected to physical violence as a recurring theme throughout the series. He lives wherever he can, sometimes even at Embassy Properties on the shop floor. His wife, Jenny, often cheats on him, and throws him out, only to find at the end of the series that Jerry was having an affair with her all along. Mark drives a white Austin Allegro (affectionately called Steve), which only functions in reverse gear. * Jerry Zachary (Dan Clark) is the suave, party animal of the three, whose favourite things in life appear to be sex, alcohol, and ecstasy. Jerry is often deceptive and slimy towards his customers, especially one tenant, Adrian Tent, who he palms off whenever he comes to him with a problem. * Tony (Mark Arden) is the wheeling-dealing boss, who insults his staff and often assaults Devlin. He has many high-profile contacts, and fingers in many pies. Tony often like to video himself having sex with various women, whilst in disguise. * Roy Dance (Barry J. Gordon) was a veteran to the industry, the only real professional of the four. Roy often appears as a figment of England's imagination, a recurring theme being \\"As Roy Dance used to say...\\". In the second episode, Roy dies when he unexpectedly explodes all over his living room, and his wife. Episodes * 1. Gangsters: Jerry gets involved with a mob, who mistake him for Mark Devlin. Devlin gets shot in both knees and spends the rest of the episode in a wheelchair. Meanwhile, new futuristic estate agents, \\"Abode\\", open up nearby and cause Embassy Properties to lose business. Jerry starts work at Abode, but soon after a hitman massacres the staff whilst Jerry is out of the office, so Jerry returns to his old job. * 2. Funeral: Roy Dance dies after exploding in his living room. The other estate agents attend the funeral and the wake, the latter of which is held at one of Embassy's condemned flats, due to a dysfunctional boiler. At the end of this episode, much of the congregation die after the flat explodes. * 3. Homeless: After being thrown out by his wife Jenny, Devlin sleeps at Embassy Properties. Tony imports a rare six-legged Bolivian mountain cat, of which only two exist in the world. He aims to sell it to Michael Jackson, owner of the other, so they can breed. Devlin accidentally kills the cat by falling through the crate which contains it, and hurriedly staples two of its legs to Mark England's cat, Botham, to try to cover for his actions. * 4. Night Out: The estate agents go on a night out after obtaining free tickets to one of Tony's clubs. England wakes up next to Steve, a customer with a wife and children. He falls for him but is heartbroken when he discovers his real life. Jerry pulls an unattractive woman, as he is too drunk to notice. When he tries to sneak out the following morning, she holds him at gunpoint whilst she has sex with him again. * 5. Female Temp: Tony calls in his niece, Jane, to help out in the office. Jerry tries to pull her throughout the episode, but she is more interested in the camp charms of England. It eventually turns out that this Jane is an imposter, and the real Jane is brought in by Tony at the end. * 6. Talk Show: The estate agents are invited onto The Dick Moodie Show, a daytime TV show. After arriving late, it is revealed that the first Jane from the previous episode was an undercover stooge for the show, and the estate agents' cowboy behaviour is unearthed. Devlin discovers that Jerry slept with his wife, and attempts to shoot himself in the head on live TV.

It is composed of a hotel tower managed by JW Marriott Hotels, an office tower, shops and residences. The project includes the restoration of four conservation buildings ‚Äì the former Non-Commissioned Officers' Club building and part of the former Beach Road Camp. It is accessible from Esplanade MRT station. History=Site history The four conservation buildings comprises three 1930s army blocks (Blocks 1, 9 and 14) and the former NCO Club built in 1952. The old concrete buildings were given conservation status in 2002 due to their rich historical and architectural significance. The Beach Road camp was the venue for the first National Service enlistment in 1967. The former NCO Club was originally designed as the headquarters of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes in Singapore, and had a swimming pool. The army blocks are in Art Deco style known for elegant, functional features, while the club is a hybrid of that and what came in the 1950s, called Modern architecture. Site plans On 27‚Äì29 September 2006, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showcased the Beach Road site at the \\"March√© international des professionnels de l'immobilier\\" (MIPIM) Asia in Hong Kong. MIPIM Asia is the Asia-Pacific version of MIPIM, an international property exhibition held in Cannes every year. The 3.5-hectare land parcel is bounded by Beach Road, Bras Basah Road, Nicoll Highway and Middle Road, and is located next to Esplanade MRT station. URA has planned the site for a mixed-use development comprising prime office space and high-end hotel rooms. The conserved buildings on the site would enhance the uniqueness of the development. The new integrated development would offer a mixture of low-rise conservation and medium to high rise buildings for commercial and hotel uses. URA required the developers to set aside at least 40% of the space for office use, and at least 30% of the space must be for hotel rooms. Site tender The site was launched for tender in March 2007, and was awarded through a \\"two-envelope\\" system, where the bids were first evaluated based on their concept proposals before the bid prices were made known. Proposals were assessed on their contribution to the city's skyline profile, the provision of attractive public spaces and high-quality architecture. When tender closed in July 2007, URA received seven submissions from major developers and firms. Five were rejected even though some of them came with higher bids; these included a joint venture between Pontiac Land Group and Morgan Stanley, CapitaLand, one of two bids from a joint venture between Keppel Land and Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Holdings, and two bids by Overseas Union Enterprise. The winning bid was the higher of two remaining tender submissions shortlisted by URA for their acceptable concept proposals. Won by a consortium led by City Developments Limited, the winning bid of S$1.689 billion worked out to about S$1,069 per square foot of potential gross floor area. Construction of the 99-year leasehold development, which was named \\"South Beach\\" and has a gross floor area of 146,827 square metres (1,580,433 square feet), started in 2012. CDL tied up with Dubai World's Istithmar Beach Road FZE and Elad Group Singapore, and tendered via Scottsdale Properties. Second-place Keppel Land and partner Cheung Kong Holdings lost out with their bid of S$1.386 billion. CDL estimated that its investment in the South Beach project would cost at least S$2.73 billion. Architecture The development features two new towers, 45 storeys and 42 storeys tall, which house two luxury hotels, offices and apartments. The original conserved military buildings of the old Beach Road Camp were restored for retail and hotel-related uses such as function rooms. The project has added at least 46,450 square metres (500,000 square feet) of new office space and about 700 to 800 hotel rooms. The CDL Consortium has proposed to adopt an environmental design and green technology to create a distinctive, high-quality development that fits in well with Singapore's tropical climate and urban context. Designed by British architectural firm Foster and Partners, a key feature of the winning design is a large \\"environmental filter\\" canopy that covers the open spaces, linking conservation buildings with the two high-rise towers and providing shelter from the elements and drawing air currents to cool the area beneath it. The canopy rises at some areas and lowers at others, resembling huge waves. Some parts of the canopy hover around one conservation block, another covers it, while yet another part appears to go into a block. Other parts of the canopy also appear to rise skywards, covering part of the fa√ßades of the two new towers. The two towers will have slanting fa√ßades to catch winds and direct air flow to the ground-level spaces. The building fa√ßades will also incorporate photovoltaic cells. Rainwater will be collected off the towers and the canopy to flow into a holding tank underground, instead of being wasted. The first storey will be laid out with a series of internal streets, with the aim of enhancing street level vibrancy and allowing pedestrians to move about easily. A pedestrian \\"green axis\\" arises upwards from the basement MRT station exit through multi-tiered gardens. The block layout features alleyways reminiscent of the nearby Seah Street area. It will also feature sunken courtyards, tiered gardens lined with shops, and food and beverage outlets.

At the time, the Marlands Shopping Mall was the largest shopping centre in Southampton and the first significant shopping centre in the city (East Street Shopping Centre being well out of the way of the main shopping district hence never being very successful and the Bargate Centre being much smaller), however it is now dwarfed by Westquay, which opened in 2000. The Marlands Shopping Centre was constructed to a postmodern design, and was built on the site of Southampton's bus station (the city is now without such a facility), a popular rose garden and some terraced housing which had become shops, on Manchester Street. These were destroyed in 1988 to make way for the shopping centre, despite local opposition. A replica of the Manchester Street shops was constructed as part of the Centre's atrium. The centre is laid out across two levels, with escalators connecting them at the North West entrance and escalators and glass lifts connecting them in the atrium, at the South of the centre. Unlike most of its contemporaries, the Marlands Shopping Centre does not contain a car park of any kind - the designated car park for the centre is accessed by going through Southampton's unusual ASDA supermarket which is on a slope - you go in on the ground floor and come out on the tenth floor - and across a bridge. The layout of the centre consists of an L-shaped mall where the street entrance at Above Bar Street leads through the centre's main arcade, to terminate at a large anchor store. The original anchor tenant of the mall was Dunnes Stores, though following their exit this facility was later occupied by Matalan. In 2014 it was confirmed that the Matalan store would be split to provide retail stores for Peacocks and Poundworld.\\"Two sign for the Marlands\\", Shopping Centre, 2014-05-21 Other significant stores within the centre include Poundland, CeX, The Disney Store and F. Hinds. The upper level of the centre has never been hugely successful - many of the units have been empty for some time. This lack of success is mainly due to the centre's location which is to the Northern part of the main shopping area although still in the centre of the city. In 2005-2006 the main (Above Bar Street) entrance to the centre was significantly refurbished. The original 'Postmodern' sign tower was replaced with an ultramodern glass and steel canopy and a new Costa Coffee outlet. An information desk was also added. The telephone of the management offices however stayed the same as (023) 8033 9164. On Thursday 19 August 2010 The Mall was sold as a ¬£136m deal. Other Malls throughout the UK have been sold and will now be run as part of a group, together with others in Gloucester, Romford and Falkirk, by a specially created management company called The Other Retail Group.

Career=Early career Making his debut in 1984, Peterson started wrestling in Texas All-Star Wrestling and in the NWA Central States. During the mid-1980s, Peterson briefly appeared in Fritz von Erich's World Class Championship Wrestling defeating Jack Victory on February 7 and Prairie States Wrestling against Ox Baker on July 23 before wrestling in the Mid-South area and, by early 1986, for Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation facing wrestlers such as Gustavo Mendoza and, in tag team matches, teamed with Brett Sawyer against Mike Scott and Rick Steiner, the Blade Runners and the Fabulous Freebirds (Terry \\"Bam Bam\\" Gordy & Buddy Roberts) in their UWF debut.

The channel is available to high definition digital television viewers in metropolitan areas through a number of owned-and-operated stations. On 25 September 2010, 7HD was replaced by the new channel 7mate. 7HD returned as a high definition simulcast on channel 70 on 10 May 2016. Initially, the Melbourne and Adelaide markets received 7HD as a HD simulcast of Seven's primary channel while the Sydney, Brisbane and Perth markets received 7HD as a HD simulcast of 7mate; this was to allow Australian Football League (AFL) matches to be broadcast in HD in those markets. Sydney, Brisbane and Perth temporarily received 7HD as a simulcast of the primary channel for the duration of the 2016 Summer Olympics, before the change was made permanent during and after the 2017 Australian Open tennis. Breakaway programming will be used to show further AFL matches in HD. History=Origins In 2004, after the 2001 introduction of digital terrestrial television in Australia, the Seven Network began a part-time high definition simulcast on digital channel 70 under the name 7 HD Digital. This simulcast showcased native high definition content alongside standard definition services on Seven. During the times that native high definition content was unavailable for simulcasting, a promo loop that showcased extracts from a variety of Seven's programs was broadcast. Breakaway era 7HD was officially announced on 15 September 2007, with Seven West Media announcing their intention to start a high definition multichannel, that was initially expected to launch in December 2007. However, 7HD became the first free-to-air commercial television channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, when it launched prior on 15 October 2007, with 25th Hour being the first program broadcast at 10:30 pm. The channel replaced Seven's existing high definition service 7 HD Digital, a part-time simulcast of its standard definition and analogue services. Due to an amendment of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 in 2006 ‚Äì the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital television) Act 2006 ‚Äì television networks were permitted to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in high definition. The channel expanded its broadcast schedule on 10 December 2007 to include daytime programming which had previously been a full simulcast of the main channel. 7HD breakaway programming ceased transmission on Sunday 4 October 2009 in preparation for the launch of 7TWO a few weeks later on 1 November. 7HD then returned to being a full high definition simulcast of Seven, before finally being replaced by 7mate on 25 September 2010. 2016 revival On 10 May 2016, 7HD returned as a high definition simulcast on channel 70. However, Melbourne and Adelaide were the only cities that received 7HD as a simulcast of Seven's primary channel on that date; Sydney, Brisbane and Perth received 7HD as a simulcast of 7mate. This is so that upcoming AFL matches can be shown in HD in all markets. In order to allow the 2016 Summer Olympics to be broadcast in high definition in all capital cities, 7HD was temporarily changed to a simulcast of Seven's primary channel in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth on 5 August 2016. However, it was reverted to a 7mate simulcast in those markets on 22 August 2016, following the conclusion of the Olympics. On 16 December 2016, 7HD switched from simulcasting 7mate to simulcasting Seven's primary channel in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth to allow the 2017 Australian Open tennis to be simulcast in high definition in all metropolitan markets. This change was not reverted and 7HD remained a simulcast of Seven in all capital cities. However, in order to broadcast AFL matches featured on 7mate in HD, Seven will use breakaway programming to show AFL matches in HD while keeping 7HD as a simulcast of Seven. In early 2020, following the relaunch of 7mate HD on Channel 74, 7HD continued broadcasting as a HD Simulcast of Channel Seven in all metropolitan markets. Programming During its time of breakaway broadcasting, 7HD broadcast a range of programming, with exclusive transmissions on weekday and weekend afternoons as well as late on weeknights, and for some time there was breakaway programming in prime-time on Saturdays and Sundays. Up to seven hours of exclusive programming was broadcast daily. Weekday afternoon programming included repeats of locally produced lifestyle programming, such as The Great Outdoors, New Idea TV, as well as movies and Disney cartoons such as Kim Possible, American Dragon: Jake Long, and My Friends Tigger and Pooh. In the late evenings a mixture of exclusive series, movies and encore screenings of series were broadcast. Late-night series broadcast included This is Your Laugh, Lost, Scrubs, That '70s Show, The Grid, Urban Legends, Final 24, Dateline NBC, 5ive Days to Midnight, A Country Practice, and classic episodes of Deal or No Deal as well as late movies and encores of other series shown on Channel Seven. The only two series exclusively made for 7HD were The NightCap and This is Your Laugh. The NightCap was broadcast exclusively on 7HD on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10.30pm until its axing during the Easter non- ratings break of 2008. Availability=Original channel In its former inception, 7HD was available Seven's owned-and-operated stations, ATN Sydney, HSV Melbourne, BTQ Brisbane, SAS Adelaide, TVW Perth and STQ Queensland. Regional affiliate Prime Television also carried their own HD simulcast, Prime HD, on its owned-and-operated stations, AMV Victoria, NEN Northern New South Wales and CBN Southern New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory. Southern Cross Television's Seven-affiliated stations carried their own HD simulcast, Southern Cross HD, on TNT Tasmania and TND Darwin. Southern Cross' other stations GTS/BKN Spencer Gulf/Broken Hill and QQQ Eastern & Central Australia, as well as Golden West Network (owned by Prime) did not carry a HD simulcast. Revival channel Upon its revival on 10 May 2016, 7HD returned to 1080i high definition, but was broadcast in MPEG-4 format as opposed to the standard MPEG-2 format. Seven-owned stations and affiliates downgrade 7mate from HD to standard definition upon the launch of their respective main channel's HD simulcast. 7HD initially launched as a simulcast of Seven's primary channel in Melbourne and Adelaide only, with Sydney, Brisbane and Perth receiving a HD simulcast of 7mate. 7HD later became a simulcast of Seven's primary channel in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth with breakaway programming used to broadcast 7mate's AFL matches in HD. The Seven-owned STQ Queensland transmitters did not carry 7HD in any form until 26 November 2018, when it is available in MPEG-2 format. Southern Cross announced in March 2017 that its Seven affiliated station TNT Tasmania would have a high definition simulcast, Southern Cross HD, launched in time for the first match of the 2017 AFL season later that month. Although it began on 22 March of the same year, it only began broadcasting Channel 7 programming in native high definition from 19 June 2018. Prime7 later launched its own high definition simulcast on its owned- and-operated stations in Northern NSW, Southern NSW/ACT, regional Victoria and Mildura on 15 January.

Brun Motorsport GmbH was a Swiss auto racing team founded by driver Walter Brun in 1983. They competed as a Porsche privateer team in sports car racing for their entire existence, running in a multitude of international championships. They notably won the World Sportscar Championship in 1986 and later became a full-fledged chassis constructor. Brun was also briefly part of the EuroBrun Formula One team from 1988 to 1990. The team was eventually dissolved in 1992. Racing history=1983 ‚Äì 1984 Following several years of competing for Team GS- Sport and their partner Sauber in the World Sportscar Championship (WSC) and Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft (DRM), Walter Brun took over the ailing GS- Sport company and renamed it Brun Motorsport for the 1983 season. Brun initially took over GS-Sport's BMW M1s and a Sauber SHS C6, modifying the later into what became known as the Sehcar C6. The new team also kept Hans Joachim Stuck and Harald Grohs as their drivers, with Walter Brun himself also doing driving duties. Following initial problems with the Sehcar, Brun became one of the early privateer owners of a Porsche 956, which was used in both the World Sportscar Championship and Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft. The 956 immediately boosted Brun's performance, as the team quickly took their first victory that season at an Interserie event at Autodrom Most with Walter Brun driving. This was followed by a fourth place at the 1000 km Spa. Abandoning the Sehcar project for 1984, a second 956 was purchased by the team, being used mainly by drivers Massimo Sigala and Oscar Larrauri. The team also added sponsorship from J√§germeister and Warsteiner. Running their first full seasons of the WSC and DRM with the 956s, Brun continued to improve their performances as the season progressed. The season opened with a fourth at the 1000 km Monza, followed by fourth and seventh places finishes at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and third and fourth at the 1000 km Spa. The team achieved their second victory ever at the 1000 km Imola, which was followed a week later by a victory at a DRM round at the N√ºrburgring, and then once more a month later at the same circuit for an Interserie event. Brun secured their first championship by winning the DRM teams title, while Stefan Bellof won the drivers' championship, having run for both Brun and Joest Racing. 1985 ‚Äì 1987 A Porsche 962C in Brun Motorsport's J√§germeister livery For 1985, Brun added a new Porsche 962C to his fleet of two 956s. The team began to dominate in the combined Interserie-DRM series, taking five victories and earning Hans Joachim Stuck second in the drivers' championship behind Joest Racing's Jochen Mass. However, the team remained winless in the World Championship. Even though the team scored a third at Mugello and a second at Hockenheimring, the team struggled to finish many events, leaving them sixth in the team's championship. The team suffered a further loss as Stefan Bellof was killed during the season in an accident while driving for the team at the 1000 km of Spa. Building on the team's success in 1985, Walter Brun began to expand his team even further for 1986. Two more 962s were purchased, with one being dedicated solely to competing in select rounds of the North American IMSA GT Championship. Although only running five rounds, the team managed to finish second at Watkins Glen behind champion Al Holbert. Back in Europe, Brun rebounded in the World Championship. After failing to finish Le Mans the previous year, the team earned a second place result. The first victory of the season came at Jerez and was followed by another at Spa. Although Brun only scored championship points in four rounds, with only one victory counting for points, the team was still able to win the teams' championship that year, defeating the factory Jaguar and Porsche teams. Brun closed off the successful year with one final victory at the Interserie round at the √ñsterreichring. Success came quickly in 1987, as Brun opened the year with a second place finish at the 24 Hours of Daytona. However, Jaguar became the dominant team in the World Championship, while the German Supercup became a struggle for Brun. This left the team with their first winless season ever, even though there were some strong performances over the year. Consistent finishes in the World Championship were not enough for Brun to defend their title, yet the team finished in second, ahead of a plethora of Porsche teams. 1988 ‚Äì 1991 962 sponsored by primary backers Repsol and Yokohama. With their great success and hoping to aid their driver Oscar Larrauri move into Formula One, Brun joined with Euroracing to form the EuroBrun team. Although Walter Brun provided a large amount of monetary investment, the team was run more by the Euroracing side. The team struggled and Brun's concentration on the Formula One squad hurt their efforts in sports cars. Even with the aid of new sponsor Repsol, the team managed only a lone victory at an Interserie event. Brun would slip to fourth in the World Championship as Mercedes-Benz would join Jaguar at the top. The EuroBrun effort downsized for 1989, leaving Walter Brun to attempt to regroup in sports cars. Following a third at the 24 Hours of Daytona, Brun would abandon their small IMSA GT concern and instead moved to the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, where they also scored a third on their debut. In the World Championship, even though Brun struggled to score podium finishes, the team was able to earn consistent points and eventually finish third in the championship, beating Jaguar as well as newcomers Nissan, Toyota and Aston Martin. As EuroBrun continued to drain funds and the Supercup championship was dissolved, the team was downsized in 1990. The Japanese effort was cancelled, and the team was left to concentrate almost solely on the World Championship. Even with a more concentrated effort, the team struggled to even finish in the top ten. A fifth place at Spa was their best effort all year, as the team now slipped to seventh in the championship standings. Following the 1990 season, the EuroBrun team was finally dissolved. At the same time, the World Championship was beginning to phase in new regulations which would leave the 962s that Brun campaigned ineligible starting in 1992, and Porsche planned no replacement for the cars. Instead of opting to purchase a customer car from another manufacturer, Brun decided to use expertise gained from their stint in Formula One to develop their own car. The funding for this project, known as the Brun C91, forced Brun to run solely in the World Championship. The team was able to improve on the previous year by gaining top ten finishes in nearly every race, but struggling to get both cars to finish. When the C91 eventually debuted halfway through the season, the car was a disaster which failed to complete any races it entered. The team finished ninth in the championship. Brun initially promised that the C91 would be better prepared for the 1992 season. However the financial strain of the EuroBrun team, the C91 project and a lack of results to attract sponsorship became too much, and Brun Motorsport closed before the 1992 season. Walter Brun continued racing for many years, as well as assisting RWS Motorsport and Konrad Motorsport. Constructor history Walter Brun developed cars throughout the entire history of Brun Motorsport, although only one bore his name. At the time of the formation of Brun Motorsport, the former Team GS- Sport Sauber SHS C6 was retained by the new team. Brun believed that the car had potential in the C2 class and therefore modified his chassis to adapt a Ford Cosworth V8. Problems with the car eventually led Brun to replace the Ford Cosworth with a turbocharged version of the BMW unit that Sauber had initially used. The car was however considered too difficult to continue, and Brun opted instead to purchase a Porsche 956. Later, after many years of experience and success with the 956 and later 962, Brun was forced to attempt to catch up to major manufacturers like Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz. Attempting to improve on the 962 platform, Brun began development of their own chassis in 1987. Attempting to overcome the flexing problems that had plagued the factory 962s, these new cars had a monocoque built by Brun and were then assembled with standard 962 parts. Eight of these cars were built in total, with a few sold to other teams while the rest joined Brun's fleet of existing 962s. Brun's largest project was the development of the Brun C91 in 1991, in preparation for the 1992 regulation changes. The car was a fresh design, using many elements from the Peugeot 905, Mercedes-Benz C291, and Jaguar XJR-14 such as a large double rear wing and low bodywork dominated by a tall cockpit. With the new regulations banning the turbocharged Porsche flat six, Brun required a naturally aspirated engine that was on par with Formula One technology. Using elements of the EuroBrun team, Brun turned to the same team that had supplied engines to the Formula One outfit: Judd. EuroBrun had initially used the outdated Judd CV V8, but Brun was able to get funding for the new EV V8. The car however suffered mechanical woes from its debut halfway through the 1991 season, and the team never managed to come to terms with the car before funding eventually ran out.

It is an open, irregularly- branched shrub with small leaves and heads of relatively large pink or white and pink flowers on the ends of the branches in spring. Description Verticordia insignis is an open, irregularly-branched shrub which grows to high. Its leaves are linear to elliptic in shape, roughly triangular in cross- section, long with a rounded end. Leaves near the flowers tend to be wider than those further down the stems. The flowers are scented and arranged in rounded, corymb-like groups on the ends of the branches on erect stalks long. The floral cup is top-shaped, about long, covered with short, soft hairs with a swelling beneath each sepal. The sepals are white to pale or deep pink, long, spreading with 5 to 7 lobes which have long, spreading hairs. The petals are egg-shaped to almost round, pale to deep pink, long and spreading, edged with short teeth. The style is fairly straight, long and glabrous. Flowering mostly occurs from September to November.Plate 2 from A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony; V. insignis is on the left. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia insignis was first formally described by Stephen Endlicher in 1837 and the description was published in Enumeratio plantarum quas in Novae Hollandiae ora austro-occidentali ad fluvium Cygnorum et in sinu Regis Georgii collegit Carolus Liber Baro de H√ºgel from specimens found near the Swan River by Carl von Huegel. When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Catocalypta along with V. roei, V. apecta, V. inclusa, V. habrantha, V. lehmannii and V. pritzelii. In the same review, George described three subspecies of V. insignis: * Verticordia insignis Endl. subsp. insignis which has white sepals, a style which is long, petals long, stamens long and upper leaves mostly long; * Verticordia insignis subsp. compta A.S.George which is similar to subsp. insignis but has pink sepals, shorter stamens (), and much shorter styles () and shorter upper leaves () * Verticordia insignis subsp. eomagis A.S.George which has longer sepals (), slightly longer petals (), longer stamens () and a longer style () than the other two subspecies. The specific epithet (insignis) is a Latin word meaning \\"remarkable\\", \\"notable\\" or \\"eminent\\". Distribution and habitat This verticordia often grows in association with other species of verticordia in grey or yellow sand near rocks in heath and woodland. It occurs along the Darling Scarp and inland as far as Northam and Brookton in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Geraldton Sandplains and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. Conservation The two subspecies insignis and compta are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife but subspecies eomagis is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture This verticordia has horticultural potential because of its flowers (described as \\"outstandingly beautiful, resembling miniature powder puffs\\"). It has been propagated from cuttings but establishing them in the garden has been difficult.

Instead, he walked in disguise as Tokuyama Takenoshin, a ronin. Accompanying him were Yagy≈´ J≈´bei, Isshin Tasuke, a pickpocket named Otsuta, and male and female ninja. Riding in the palanquin was a kagemusha, an actor named Shinkichi. His entourage included ≈åkubo Hikozaemon, Lady Kasuga, Matsudaira Nobutsuna, and various ladies-in-waiting. Going to Kyoto, the entourage followed the T≈çkaid≈ç. At various places along the way, a (fictional) half-brother of Iemitsu, Tsuzuki, attempted to assassinate him, with the assistance of F≈´ma ninja. The sequel, Shogun Iemitsu Shinobi Tabi Part II, depicts the return to Edo. This time the group travels along the Nakasend≈ç, passing through territory that had recently been held by the Sanada clan. Takenoshin rescues a princess (Shizu, in disguise under the name Isuzu), who, viewers later learn, is a daughter of Ishida Mitsunari in league with Mugensai, formerly the chief ninja of the late Ishida Mitsunari. Mugensai has lied to the princess in order to get her to assassinate Iemitsu.

Kennedy capped off a memorable year with membership of the victorious Munster colleges inter-provincial team. Kennedy subsequently studied agricultural science at University College Dublin. He achieved his degree in the late 1940s and took up employment with Minch Norton Maltings in Nenagh in 1950. He moved to the firm's Goresbridge depot as manager in 1961 before transferring to the Guinness Maltings in Midleton in 1964 where he stayed for seven years. In 1954 Kennedy married Rita McCormack. Together they had four daughters and one son. In 1971 the Kennedys took over the J.K. Moloney drapery business in Liberty Square, Thurles. Kennedy‚Äôs wife died in 1983 and on his retirement from his drapery business he came back go his native Puckane. Jimmy Kennedy died in 2007. Playing career=Club Kennedy played his club hurling with his local club in Kiladanagn. He won a North Tipperary junior championship medal with the club in 1944. Kennedy later played with the University College Dublin hurling club and enjoyed further successes. He won a Fitzgibbon Cup medal with the college club in the 1947-48 running of the intervarsity‚Äôs championship. He later added two Dublin county titles to his collection in 1947 and 1948. Kennedy later returned to his native Kiladangan club and continued playing until the mid-1950s. Inter- county It was during his time playing for UCD that Kennedy came to the attention of the Dublin senior inter-county selectors. He made his debut for ‚Äòthe Metropolitans‚Äô in 1946 and played in his first Leinster final in 1947. Kilkenny were victorious on that occasion. 1948 saw Kennedy line out in his second provincial final. Laois provided the opposition on that occasion, however, ‚Äòthe Dubs‚Äô trounced Laois by 5-9 to 3-3 giving Kennedy a Leinster title. Antrim fell heavily in the penultimate game of the championship, allowing Dublin to advance to an All-Ireland final meeting with Waterford. Dublin were far off the pace on that occasion and Waterford claimed the Liam MacCarthy Cup for the first time ever. Kennedy‚Äôs performances with Dublin brought him to the attention of the selectors of his own native-county who attempted to poach him back to Tipperary. Former GAA President Seamus Gardiner, Fr. Johnnie Minehan and county secretary Phil Purcell traveled to Dublin and met Kennedy. He wasn‚Äôt intending to move as liked the Dublin hurling scene. In the end, however, he agreed and declared for Tipperary in 1949. It proved to be a shrewd decision. A short time after making his debut for Tipp Kennedy captured a National Hurling League medal. He later added a Munster title to his collection as Tipp defeated Limerick in the provincial decider. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Tipp play Laois, the surprise winners of the Leinster final. The game turned into a rout as the Munster men completely overpowered the Leinster men. Kennedy collected his first All- Ireland medal following a 3-11 to 0-3 victory. In 1950 Kennedy began the year by winning a second National League title with Tipp. Tipperary later took on Cork in the Munster final. The stakes were high as both sides realized that whoever won would be the favourites to take the All-Ireland title. The game itself has gone down in history as a nadir in the history of crowd-troubled matches. It is estimated that up to 50,000 people packed into FitzGerald Stadium to witness the game as gates were broken down, walls were scaled and the playing field was frequently invaded. Oranges, sods of earth and overcoats were thrown at Tipp goalkeeper Tony Reddin as he tried to do his duty. In the end Tipp won the game by 2-17 to 3-11. In the All-Ireland final Tipperary faced Kilkenny. The game failed to live up to expectations; however, Kennedy added a second All-Ireland medal to his collection following a 1-9 to 1-8 victory. In 1951 Tipp were attempting to capture a third All-Ireland medal in- a-row. Kennedy began the campaign in the Munster quarter-final against Waterford; however, he was dropped for the semi-final against Limerick and only came on as a sub. He later played in the Munster final against Cork although he was badly hampered with cracked ribs. There was, however, no place for him on the All-Ireland final line up. Furthermore, although he had played two matches, he was the only member of the panel of twenty two to lose out on an All-Ireland medal. There were twenty one medals presented and Kennedy was the only member of the panel to lose out. A few weeks later Kennedy was selected to play in the Oireachtas series of games, however, he declined and informed the authorities that he did not wish to be considered for inclusion any more. This brought Kennedy‚Äôs inter-county career to an end. Provincial Kennedy also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He captained the team in the Railway Cup competition in 1949; however, he had little success. After moving to Tipperary Kennedy was eligible to play for Munster. He captured his sole Railway Cup winners‚Äô medal in 1950. TeamsReferences * Corry, Eoghan, The GAA Book of Lists (Hodder Headline Ireland, 2005).

(1898). History of the Munros of Fowlis. pp. 87 - 90.  Thirty Years' War  As a young man Robert entered the army in 1626 and became an officer in Donald Mackay's regiment, serving first in Danish service and later in Swedish service where he highly distinguished himself during the Thirty Years' War on the continent, particularly during the Battle of Lutzen in 1632.This officer is frequently mentioned throughout the famous work Robert Monro, His Expedition with the worthy Scots Regiment (called Mac-Keyes Regiment) (2 vols., London, 1637) According to 19th-century historian Alexander Mackenzie there were three Generals, eight Colonels, five Lieutenant-Colonels, eleven Majors and above thirty Captains, besides a large number of other soldiers all of the name Munro in the Swedish army during the Thirty Years' War. However, although there were numerous colonels and lower ranks bearing the name of Monro or Munro during the Thirty Years' War, none actually held the rank of general in any of the continental armies between 1618 and 1648.See for example, Robert Monro, His Expedition with the worthy Scots Regiment (called Mac-Keyes Regiment) (2 vols., London, 1637), List of the Scottish officers in chiefe, appendix to the first part; Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618‚Äì1648 (London, 2014), p.177.

Robert Monro's regiment  Sheriff of Ross and Inverness  On 26 August 1643, during the minority of the former chief, \\"the Estates of the Kingdom passed an Act for the Committees of War in the shires of Scotland\\", and among the Commissioners for the Sheriffdom of Sutherland and a part of Inverness-shire, occurs the name of \\"Sir Robert Munro, tutour of Foulles\\"; and again on 24 July 1644, in a commission for a similar purpose and for the same Sheriffdom is found the name of \\"Sir Robert Monro, Tutor of Foullis\\".Acts of Parliament, Scot., Vol., pp.51, 134. As quoted by Alexander Mackenzie in the History of the Munros of Fowlis. In 1649, the Scottish Parliament separated from the Sheriffdom of Inverness-shire the \\"lands eastward of Altnalait, Knockravock and the Royal Burgh of Tain\\", erected the Sheriffdom of Ross, and appointed the Marquiss of Argyll the Sheriff-Principal. Afterwards the commission was granted to Sir Robert Munro, who had been elected Member of Parliament for Inverness-shire in 1649 and for his own County of Ross after it was separated from the County of Inverness, 1649‚Äì50, to be Sheriff-Principal of the County of Ross. In 1651 Robert succeeded to the head of his house, upon the death of his cousin Sir Hector Munro, 2nd Baronet of Foulis who died at just 17 years of age, as already mentioned. Robert took up his residence in Foulis Castle.  Feud with Alexander Chisholm  In 1654 men of the Clan Chisholm raided lands belonging to Robert Munro, 3rd Baronet of Foulis. Valentine Chisholm and four other \\"delinquents\\" plundered 85 cows and 23 horses. Robert wisely pursued the matter through the courts of Oliver Cromwell. Robert Munro of Foulis accused Alexander Chisholm of Comar of allowing his kinsman to carry out the raid.Chisholm's court martial in 1655 and his 7 weeks imprisonment during Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth. Information provided by the Clan Chisholm Society. The court found Robert Munro of Foulis in favour and instructed Alexander Chisholm to produce Valentine Chisholm, who was \\"known for his barbarity\\", and his four followers in court within fifteen days, compensate Foulis and his kinsmen for their losses and also to provide a ¬£1,000 bond as security for future good behaviour. Whilst Robert Munro's lands were raided and his tenants abused, his younger brother George Munro, 1st of Newmore later commanded the king's forces in Scotland from 1674 to 1677.Way, George and Squire, Romily.

It is located on the southern headland of the island of Sylt. The municipality is part of the Amt Landschaft Sylt. The economy is dominated by tourism. Etymology H√∂rnum's name is derived from H√∂rn (\\"corner\\" or \\"edge\\"). Geography H√∂rnum is located on the southern tip of Sylt. Most of the municipal territory is covered by nature reserves (mostly dunes and heath). The H√∂rnum Odde is the southernmost point of the island and subject to constant erosion by wind and sea. History=First settlements Although fishermen had reportedly settled in the area prior to 1500 AD, the place is first recorded in 1649 as Hornum. The name \\"H√∂rnum\\" was already known to the chronicler Muchel-Madis (* 11 November 1572 in Morsum; ‚Ä† 21 January 1651), who in his chronicles reports a shipwrecking \\"1571... off H√∂rnum\\". In 1648, the area was named \\"H√∂rnum\\" on a map by cartographer Johannes Mejer (1606‚Äì1674). The southern tip of the island remained unsettled though for a long time, because not only storm surges but also shifting dunes, which would repeatedly bury houses, made a colonisation difficult. Only in the late 18th century, this effect could be stopped by planting vegetation on the dunes. \\"On H√∂rnum\\", as the entire southern peninsula of Sylt used to be called, there were at first only a few fishermen. A single house stood in the dunes at Budersand from 1765 to 1785. It served for storing flotsam, but was soon torn down by people from Amrum and Rantum. In 1787, only the foundations were left. Post-1900 There were no buildings in the area until the construction of a Hamburg America Line (HAPAG) pier. Long since, H√∂rnum had had a natural harbour east of Budersand, which remained largely unnoticed though. Only after a wooden wharf had been constructed, a regular ship line to Hamburg via Cuxhaven took up operations on 29 June 1901. Moreover, a seaside resort line H√∂rnum-Heligoland-Hamburg became active. In 1901, the area (still part of Rantum at the time) was connected by the to Westerland. Up to that point the heath around the harbour was devoid of any buildings. The first local structure was the railway station built in 1903, followed by the HAPAG building. Only in 1905 were the first residential buildings erected. Most of the initial growth of the village was driven by military construction. The core of today's H√∂rnum is the Wei√üe Siedlung (White Housing Estate) around Strandstra√üe, Hafenstra√üe and Blankes T√§lchen, built by the military starting in 1920. In 1936, construction started on the Rote Siedlung (Red Housing Estate; Steintal, Budersandstra√üe, Hangstra√üe) and like the Wei√üe Siedlung served as housing for the local population, all of whom were employed at the local Fliegerhorst (airbase), built after 1935, or other military installations. There were almost no civilian buildings at the time. Until the island was connected to the mainland by the construction of the Hindenburg causeway in 1927, the port of H√∂rnum and the local rail line were the main way for visitors to get on the island. Around 90% of the tourists would use H√∂rnum as their port of call. In 1906, the H√∂rnum water tower was built; after the connection of H√∂rnum to the island's common water supply it became superfluous and was demolished in 1967. In 1907, H√∂rnum got a 33.5 metres tall lighthouse, which was built based on a standardised design. Other such constructions were erected on the island of Pellworm and at Westerhever. From 1918 to 1930, the lighthouse was also used as a school house. Lessons took place at an elevation of 30 meters. At the end of World War I, H√∂rnum counted 21 inhabitants who were administrated by Rantum. In both World Wars, H√∂rnum was deemed a strategically important location which needed special defense. Military importance during the World Wars The first barracks were built in 1914 for troops of the so-called \\"Island Guard\\". At the beginning of World War I, island guards were stationed on Amrum, Sylt and R√∏m√∏ (today in Denmark), who used light signals to communicate. From the List \\"Elbow\\" peninsula in the north to H√∂rnum in the south, bunkers and shelters were dug into the dunes of Sylt and wired with telephone lines. Mostly elderly, local soldiers were tasked with searching the horizon for hostile troops, but the island did not witness any combat. During World War II, troops were deployed to the village. The port was mainly used by the Kriegsmarine and a small air field for minor planes had been constructed in the mid-1930s. After 1935, the Luftwaffe had built a naval air station and the \\"H√∂rnum Military Settlement (Milit√§rische Siedlung H√∂rnum)\\" as a preparation for the war. The outbreak of war prevented the project from being finished and so the gaps in the colony, which was designed as a garden city, have since been filled with post-war buildings. The number of inhabitants in H√∂rnum exploded due to the opening of the naval air station and the adjacent quarters and rose above 1,000 when the troops brought their families to the island. Shortly after, electricity was available from a local power station, and in 1941 H√∂rnum was connected to Westerland's water supply. H√∂rnum's seaplane base was the location of the first bombs dropped on German soil during the Second World War, on the night of 19 March 1940 during a raid by No 61 Squadron RAF's Handley Page Hampdens based at RAF Hemswell in Lincolnshire, England. Post- War era In 1947, H√∂rnum split from the neighbouring municipality of Rantum and became independent. Only two years later, the village was awarded the title Nordseebad (North Sea resort). An influx of tourists and \\"New H√∂rnumers\\" set in. In 1947, the village briefly provided shelter for more than 2,000 refugees from Germany's former eastern territories and also 40 families from Heligoland dwelt there after the evacuation of their island (occupied by the United Kingdom). In 1948, a wooden hut was erected with donations from Norway and consecrated as a church. It was named St. Martin. When St. Thomas' church was built in 1970, the St. Martin building shortly served as a kindergarten and a storage for Strandkorb beach chairs. Since 1974, this so-called Norwegian House is seat of the Wadden Sea Conservation Station (Schutzstation Wattenmeer), an environmental protection society, and since 1989 also serves as a youth club. In 1985, the hut was named after the H√∂rnum teacher and environmentalist Kuno Ehlfeldt. Also in 1948, H√∂rnum was connected to the island's road network. The original concrete slabs track consisted of a single lane and was broadened in 1969. In 1960, the Kersiegsiedlung colony, known for its thatched roofs, was built in the dunes. The Catholic St. Joseph's church followed in 1962, and in 1969/1970 the Evangelical St. Thomas' church was built according to a design by Nieb√ºll-based architect Martin-Bernhard Christiansen. The latter building constitutes Schleswig-Holstein's youngest historically preserved church. It is built in the shape of a white sail. Another notability is the ex-voto ship which hangs inside the church house ‚Äî a scale model of the paddlesteamer \\"Cobra\\", a Hamburg America Line ship, which from 1901 on contributed greatly to the exploration and development of the H√∂rnum area. In 1970, the railway service was discontinued and the track later demolished. It is now used as a bicycle track. Tourism development since the 1970s In the mid-1970s a spa and therapy centre was built and opened in 1977. In 1994, the Pidder L√ºng Barracks, which had replaced the former naval station, were closed. After the demolition of all buildings on the site, a golf course with an adjacent luxury hotel was built there. In 2002, the H√∂rnum harbour was slightly renovated. The H√∂rnum Yacht Club was created and a new ticket vending facility for Adler shippings was opened. Later, several neighbourhoods in H√∂rnum were also renovated. In 1999, the old therapy centre was closed as it did not provide modern standards for cures any more and was in deficit. It was replaced by a hotel. Economy=Tourism Tetrapods on the beach H√∂rnum's original function as a military town has been completely replaced by tourism as the main means of income. The beaches east and west of the village, the port and the dunes provide the village's assets. A popular route for mudflat hiking leads along the eastern shore to Rantum. The Schutzstation Wattenmeer offers information on the Wadden Sea and the salt marshes and promotes the protection of the local landscape among tourists. Another attraction is hiking around the H√∂rnum-Odde, the island's southernmost edge, which due to erosion is constantly shrinking. In the storm Erwin in winter 2005 alone, the H√∂rnum-Odde lost 20 metres of land. From this southern headland, the neighbouring islands of F√∂hr and Amrum are visible.

Etymology  The name Kaamp means \\"a marked out field\\".  History  Kampen in 1894 as seen from atop the Kampen Lighthouse The first mention of Kampen occurs in a tax registry from 1543. The village is considered to have been founded quite late, possibly as a result of people moving there from an earlier settlement destroyed by a storm. In 1767, the local Landvogt and some inhabitants bought land to the north of the village and established the Kampener Vogelkoje, a decoy. This was profitable over the next four decades and through 1921 yielded a total of 695,957 killed ducks. In 1803, Kampen consisted of 23 houses and 93 inhabitants (40 men and 53 women, of which 23 were seafarers). In 1853, King Frederick VII of Denmark ordered the construction of the Kampen Lighthouse. In 1860, the number of houses had fallen to 22 and there were still 93 inhabitants, however, just three of them were seafarers. In 1864, Kampen became Prussian. For centuries, until around 1900, Kampen was a rural village shaped by agriculture. Shipping and fishing as well as other industries and crafts played a relatively smaller role in the village's development. Together with Wenningstedt, the village of Kampen constituted part of the so-called \\"Northern Villages\\" (Nordd√∂rfer) of Sylt. The church and school were shared due to the low number of citizens in the respective villages ‚Äì so they could only be supported through a common effort. Kampen, a quiet hamlet situated in a heath, was discovered by tourists quite late. Until the beginning of the 20th century the place was merely regarded an insider's tip among travellers. Only in the 1920s did Kampen's reputation as a seaside resort begin to develop. An ordinance from 1912, which is still effective today, requires that all houses in the village be built in the traditional style, i.e. brick buildings with thatched roofs. In July 1903, Kampen was linked by the Sylter Nordbahn to Westerland. In 1908, this was extended north to List. In 1908, the Nordseebad Kampen auf Sylt GmbH (founded in 1904) built a large two-storied octagonal wooden pavilion on the northern heath, around 400 metres from the Kurhaus (it was demolished in 1922). Even earlier, in 1906, a development plan had called for covering all of the northwestern heath with new construction. After World War I, the Verein Naturschutz Insel Sylt e. V. was founded. Haus Kliffende to the north of the village became a cultural and artists' meeting place in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1921, locals established the Verkehrsverein Kampen/Sylt e. V. to boost tourism. Haus Kliffende. Beginning in 1921, writer Thomas Mann was a guest of Siegfried Jacobsohn and later often stayed at Haus Kliffende, north of the village. Many other intellectuals, musicians, writers and other artists flocked to the area. These included Max Frisch, Emil Nolde, Carl Zuckmayer, Heinrich Vogeler and Lovis Corinth. In 1923, there were 1,213 visitors to Kampen. Ferdinand Avenarius is considered as the first popularizer of Sylt. Today, a park is named after him. Kampen became a separate municipality on 21 March 1927, when the Nordd√∂rfer association was dissolved by the Prussian authorities, creating the Landgemeinde Kampen. In 1938, there were 25,0000 visitors and more than 500 Ehrenkurg√§ste. Prior to ‚Äì and during ‚Äì World War II camps to accommodate troops were established in Kampen by the Wehrmacht. A major camp was located near today's public camping site in the southwestern part of the village. It had been built due to the expansion of the air field in Braderup. There was, however, no direct combat action, nor did Kampen suffer any remarkable damage from the allied bombings. East of the village there was an anti-aircraft site with many bunkers and shelters. In the immediate post-war years, Kampen had 370 inhabitants and they were joined by 1,927 refugees from Germany's former eastern territories housed in the former military installations. In the 1950s, the Caf√© Kupferkanne was established inside the anti-aircraft facility. The Lager Skagerak became a youth hostel. After World War II the village became a venue of the \\"rich and famous\\" ‚Äì the tycoons of the Wirtschaftswunder. Also many celebrities of cinema and television thought Kampen to be fashionable. Gunter Sachs was one of those the public associated with the village. In the 1960s there was a considerable boost in the naturist movement. Especially the nude beach at Buhne 16 in Kampen gained popularity by frequent media reports. TV productions such as Tatort: (1972) were set in Kampen. In 1971, Kampen had been assigned the title Nordseebad. The boom slowed down in the 1980s. Today Kampen remains an upscale tourist resort.  Village development  From the 1920s on, the summer residences and villas of mostly wealthy guests were constructed on the Nordheide around the old village core. Thus the area of Kampen multiplied within a few years. Despite early plannings from the 1920s, the western heath of Kampen was not covered with buildings though and today is a nature reserve.  Geography  Kampen beach with Rotes Kliff. Kampen lies on the Geest at a height of around 27 metres above NHN. The so-called Rotes Kliff (red cliff) west of the village rises up to 30 metres from the North Sea and is highly endangered by erosion and storm surges. The Uwe D√ºne (dune) reaches a height of 52.5 m above sea level, making it the island's highest point. It is named after (1793‚Äì1838), a freedom fighter for a united Schleswig-Holstein who hailed from Keitum. East of Kampen the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park extends, in summer the municipality offers guided mudflat hiking trips there.  Economy  Like all municipalities on Sylt, Kampen is highly specialised on the tourism business, so that an economical monostructure can be found there. The annual number of visitors is currently around 35,000.  Attractions  The Kampener Vogelkoje is located roughly three kilometres north of Kampen. Nowadays this is a nature reserve of 10 hectares for numerous species of water fowl. There are also numerous studios and galleries of artists in Kampen.

A basic theme and motivation concerns the fixed point set in group actions of a finite group G. The most elementary formulation, however, is in terms of the classifying space BG of such a group. Roughly speaking, it is difficult to map such a space BG continuously into a finite CW complex X in a non-trivial manner. Such a version of the Sullivan conjecture was first proved by Haynes Miller.Haynes Miller, The Sullivan Conjecture on Maps from Classifying Spaces, The Annals of Mathematics, second series, Vol. 120 No. 1, 1984, pp. 39-87. JSTOR: The Annals of Mathematics. Accessed May 9, 2012. Specifically, in 1984, Miller proved that the function space, carrying the compact-open topology, of base point- preserving mappings from BG to X is weakly contractible. This is equivalent to the statement that the map X ‚Üí F(BG, X) from X to the function space of maps BG ‚Üí X, not necessarily preserving the base point, given by sending a point x of X to the constant map whose image is x is a weak equivalence. The mapping space F(BG, X) is an example of a homotopy fixed point set. Specifically, F(BG, X) is the homotopy fixed point set of the group G acting by the trivial action on X. In general, for a group G acting on a space X, the homotopy fixed points are the fixed points F(EG, X)^G of the mapping space F(EG, X) of maps from the universal cover EG of BG to X under the G-action on F(EG, X) given by g in G acts on a map f in F(EG, X) by sending it to gfg^{-1}. The G-equivariant map from EG to a single point * induces a natural map Œ∑: X^G = F(*,X)^G‚ÜíF(EG, X)^G from the fixed points to the homotopy fixed points of G acting on X. Miller's theorem is that Œ∑ is a weak equivalence for trivial G-actions on finite-dimensional CW complexes. An important ingredient and motivation (see [1]) for his proof is a result of Gunnar Carlsson on the homology of BZ/2 as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra. Miller's theorem generalizes to a version of Sullivan's conjecture in which the action on X is allowed to be non-trivial. In, Sullivan conjectured that Œ∑ is a weak equivalence after a certain p-completion procedure due to A. Bousfield and D. Kan for the group G=Z/2. This conjecture was incorrect as stated, but a correct version was given by Miller, and proven independently by Dwyer-Miller- Neisendorfer, Carlsson, and Jean Lannes, showing that the natural map (X^G)_p ‚Üí F(EG, (X)_p)^G is a weak equivalence when the order of G is a power of a prime p, and where (X)_p denotes the Bousfield-Kan p-completion of X. Miller's proof involves an unstable Adams spectral sequence, Carlsson's proof uses his affirmative solution of the Segal conjecture and also provides information about the homotopy fixed points F(EG,X)^G before completion, and Lannes's proof involves his T-functor.

History The name is derived from the village's being situated approximately in the middle of the island. At the same time it was located at a crossing of the two historical main roads that used to run across F√∂hr in a north-south direction. The name \\"Midlum\\" is first recorded in 1462. Even today there is a tradition in Midlum to go out to the sea dike in spring and cook a meal. This habit dates back to a time when the sheep of the village were driven out there to spend the summer under a shepherd's guidance. Traditionally, children had been helping the shepherds and had therefore been rewarded with Mehlbeutel, a sort of dumplings. Politics Until 2006, Midlum was the seat of the Amt F√∂hr- Land. Of the nine seats in the municipality council, the Midlumer W√§hlergemeinschaft holds seven since the communal elections of 2008. It was the only faction to compete in the elections of 2008 as there are no regular political parties in Midlum's communal political landscape. Two other seats are held by single candidates.

Geography and traffic  Until the end of 2006, Nebel was the seat of the Amt Amrum and as such it was the administrative centre of the island of Amrum. S√ºddorf (√ñ√∂mrang: S√∂ssaarep) and Steenodde (Stianood) are minor districts of Nebel. The western part of the village is called Westerheide. Nebel is situated on the bus line from Wittd√ºn to Norddorf. Until 1939 Nebel had a rail head station of Amrum's island railway. In Steenodde, there is a small harbour.  History  Nebel was presumably founded in the early 16th century. It is thought that the name is derived from the words nei and bel, where the former means \\"new\\" and the latter is based on the ancient Danish term boli, \\"settlement\\" (confer Nieb√ºll and Nieblum). The church of St. Clement was built in 1236 and was standing between the villages of Norddorf and S√ºddorf prior to the foundation of Nebel.  Village districts =Steenodde Steenodde (√ñ√∂mrang: Stianood, Danish: Stenodde) is the smallest hamlet on Amrum. It is directly located on the shore of the tidal flats of the Wadden Sea east of Amrum. Notable attractions include dolmens and grave mounds which are a common sight in the area. Steenodde has its own trafficable dock. The hamlet used to be a port for the ferry line Amrum-Halligen-Schl√ºttsiel, today there is a small port for minor freight vessels and for yachts below 12 m of length. The oldest house on Amrum, the former inn Zum lustigen Seehund (\\"The Merry Seal\\") is located in Steenodde, it was constructed in 1720. S√ºddorf S√ºddorf (√ñ√∂mr.: S√∂ssaarep, Dan.: Sydtorp) was first recorded in 1446 and is therefore thought to be the oldest hamlet on the isle. The sailor Hark Olufs, a native of S√ºddorf, became famous in the 18th century while serving the Bey of Constantine, Algeria. In the late 19th century, a windmill was erected on an old grave mound. It had already been built in 1775 on the neighbouring island of Sylt but was later relocated to S√ºddorf. Today it is used as a dwelling house. On the southwestern edge of S√ºddorf, there is the Satteld√ºne sanitorium, which specialises in the treatment of diseases of the respiratory system of children and adolescents. Moreover, Amrum's school house, the √ñ√∂mrang Skuul with elementary and secondary divisions, is located in this part of Nebel. South of S√ºddorf, still within the municipality's limits, the Amrum lighthouse is located. It took up service on January 1, 1875 and it has got the second-highest navigational light along the German North Sea shores next to the light of Heligoland. The tower is built on a 27 m high dune. The fire itself is located at 63 m above sea level and carries as far as . The lighthouse is Amrum's most prominent building.  Politics  Since the municipal elections of 2008, the Nebeler B√ºrgerblock holds seven seats, the CDU holds three and the SPD holds one seat of Nebel's municipality council.  Sights  Another mill, built in 1771 by Erk Knudten, hosts a museum of local history which also features exhibitions of works by various artists during the summer months. It is a Dutch horizontal type mill which was in use until 1962. Pastor Erich P√∂rksen saved the building from being torn down by founding a society for the preservation of the Amrum windmill in 1963. The mill is still operable today. Opposite of the windmill, the Graveyard of the Homeless is located, where unidentified drowned persons are buried. Most graves date back to the early 20th century, the youngest being from 1969. Since then, all bodies washed ashore on Amrum's beaches could reliably be identified due to improved forensic techniques. Each tomb is decorated with a simple wooden cross into which the date of the body's retrieval from the sea is encarved. The navigational light \\"Nebel\\", erected in 1981, is a modern aluminium construction of 9.6 m height. Due to its location, this leading light for the Norderaue channel has a height of 16 m above mean high tide sea level and carries as far as . √ñ√∂mrang H√ºs. The √ñ√∂mrang H√ºs at Waaswai 1, Nebel, is a largely original ancient Frisian house from around 1751 which is owned by the folklore society √ñ√∂mrang Ferian. The original owner was a sea captain who had his ship depicted on a tile mural in the house's living room. The home decor of former times is presented in the rooms of the √ñ√∂mrang H√ºs, which is opened to the public. In the attic, various exhibitions are held and one can celebrate official wedding ceremonies in the living room. The centre of Nebel is distinguished by further thatched 18th and 19th century homes. Two apostles of The Divine Sacrament The equally thatched church of St. Clement hosts a number of artifacts. Among them a Gothic wooden group of apostles called \\"The Divine Sacrament\\" which allegedly had been washed ashore during a storm surge. The baptismal font hails from Roman times. The narrow nave, which includes by a low gallery along its flank and over the entrance, communicates the vision of a ship's hull. Also worth a sight is the graveyard of this very church with its tombs from the times between 1670 and 1830. Not only do those tombstones depict ships, but they also contain a short narration on the life of the deceased. As of July 2008, the parish is facing conservational problems though. Especially lichen as well as moss are continuously destroying the ancient headstones. A professional cleansing is required but will be very costly. Thus ideas have been uttered to bury endangered tombstones into the soil, so bacteria could decompose the moss and lichen. The 36 m high church tower, tiled with copper plates, was only built in 1908. St. Clement's parish owns a rare copy of the Missale Slesvicense, a liturgical book printed in 1486 by Steffen Arndes. Only four exemplars of this book are preserved at all and it is thought to be the oldest book ever printed in Schleswig-Holstein and Denmark. The book is kept in the archives of the North Elbian Evangelical Church at Kiel and is infrequently displayed in the churchhouse.

The respiratory center is made up of three major respiratory groups of neurons, two in the medulla and one in the pons. In the medulla they are the dorsal respiratory group, and the ventral respiratory group. In the pons, the pontine respiratory group includes two areas known as the pneumotaxic centre and the apneustic centre. The respiratory centre is responsible for generating and maintaining the rhythm of respiration, and also of adjusting this in homeostatic response to physiological changes. The respiratory center receives input from chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, the cerebral cortex, and the hypothalamus in order to regulate the rate and depth of breathing. Input is stimulated by altered levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and blood pH, by hormonal changes relating to stress and anxiety from the hypothalamus, and also by signals from the cerebral cortex to give a conscious control of respiration. Injury to respiratory groups can cause various breathing disorders that may require mechanical ventilation, and is usually associated with a poor prognosis. Respiratory groups The respiratory centre is divided into three major groups, two in the medulla and one in the pons. The two groups in the medulla are the dorsal respiratory group and the ventral respiratory group. In the pons, the pontine respiratory group is made up of two areas ‚Äì the pneumotaxic centre and the apneustic centre. The dorsal and ventral medullary groups control the basic rhythm of respiration. The groups are paired with one on each side of the brainstem. Dorsal respiratory group Solitary tract nucleus in the dorsal respiratory group and nucleus ambiguus of the ventral respiratory group shown in their positions on the medulla oblongata. The dorsal respiratory group (DRG) has the most fundamental role in the control of respiration, initiating inspiration (inhalation). The DRG is a collection of neurons forming an elongated mass that extends most of the length of the dorsal medulla. They are near to the central canal of the spinal cord, and just behind the ventral group. They set and maintain the rate of respiration. Most of the neurons are located in the nucleus of the solitary tract. Other important neurons are found in the adjacent areas including the reticular substance of the medulla. The solitary nucleus is the end-point for sensory information arriving from the pontine respiratory group, and from two cranial nerves ‚Äì the vagus nerve, and the glossopharyngeal nerve. The solitary nucleus sends signals to the respiratory center from peripheral chemoreceptors, baroreceptors, and other types of receptors in the lungs in particular the stretch receptors. The dorsal respiratory group is thus seen as an integrating center that gives output to the ventral respiratory group to modify the breathing rhythm. Ventral respiratory group In the medulla, the ventral respiratory group (VRG) consists of four groups of neurons that make up the exhalation (expiratory) area of respiratory control. This area is in the ventrolateral part of medulla, about 5 mm anterior and lateral to the dorsal respiratory group. The neurons involved include those in the nucleus ambiguus, the nucleus retroambiguus, and the interneurons in the pre-B√∂tzinger complex. The VRG contains both inspiratory and expiratory neurons. The ventral respiratory group of neurons are active in forceful breathing and inactive during quiet, restful respirations. The VRG sends inhibitory impulses to the apneustic center. Pontine respiratory group In the pontine tegmentum in the pons, the pontine respiratory group (PRG) includes the pneumotaxic and apneustic centers. These have connections between them, and from both to the solitary nucleus. =Pneumotaxic center= The pneumotaxic center is located in the upper part of the pons. Its nuclei are the subparabrachial nucleus and the medial parabrachial nucleus. The pneumotaxic center controls both the rate and the pattern of breathing. The pneumotaxic center is considered an antagonist to the apneustic center, (which produces abnormal breathing during inhalation) cyclically inhibiting inhalation. The pneumotaxic center is responsible for limiting inspiration, providing an inspiratory off-switch (IOS). It limits the burst of action potentials in the phrenic nerve, effectively decreasing the tidal volume and regulating the respiratory rate. Absence of the center results in an increase in depth of respiration and a decrease in respiratory rate. The pneumotaxic center regulates the amount of air that can be taken into the body in each breath. The dorsal respiratory group has rhythmic bursts of activity that are constant in duration and interval. When a faster rate of breathing is needed the pneumotaxic center signals the dorsal respiratory group to speed up. When longer breaths are needed the bursts of activity are elongated. All the information that the body uses to help respiration happens in the pneumotaxic center. If this was damaged or in any way harmed it would make breathing almost impossible. One study on this subject was on anesthetized paralyzed cats before and after bilateral vagotomy. Ventilation was monitored in awake and anesthetized cats breathing air or CO2. Ventilation was monitored both before and after lesions to the pneumotaxic center region and after subsequent bilateral vagotomy. Cats with pontine lesions had a prolonged inhalation duration. In cats, after anaesthesia and bivagotomy, pontine transection has been described as evoking a long sustained inspiratory discharges interrupted by short expiratory pauses. In rats on the other hand, after anaesthesia, bivagotomy and pontine transection, this breathing pattern was not observed, either in vivo or in vitro. These results suggest interspecies differences between rat and cat in the pontine influences on the medullary respiratory center. =Apneustic center= The apneustic center of the lower pons appears to promote inhalation by a constant stimulation of the neurons in the medulla oblongata. The apneustic center sends signals to the dorsal group in the medulla to delay the 'switch off', the inspiratory off switch (IOS) signal of the inspiratory ramp provided by the pneumotaxic centre. It controls the intensity of breathing, giving positive impulses to the neurons involved with inhalation. The apneustic center is inhibited by pulmonary stretch receptors and also by the pneumotaxic center. It also discharges an inhibitory impulse to the pneumotaxic center. Respiratory rhythm Breathing is the repetitive process of bringing air into the lungs and taking waste products out. The oxygen brought in from the air is a constant, on-going need of an organism to maintain life. This need is still there during sleep so that the functioning of this process has to be automatic and be part of the autonomic nervous system. The in-breath is followed by the out-breath, giving the respiratory cycle of inhalation and exhalation. There are three phases of the respiratory cycle: inspiration, post-inspiration or passive expiration, and late or active expiration. The number of cycles per minute is the respiratory rate. The respiratory rate is set in the respiratory center by the dorsal respiratory group, in the medulla, and these neurons are mostly concentrated in the solitary nucleus that extends the length of the medulla. The basic rhythm of respiration is that of quiet, restful breathing known as eupnea. Quiet breathing only requires the activity of the dorsal group which activates the diaphragm, and the external intercostal muscles. Exhalation is passive and relies on the elastic recoil of the lungs. When the metabolic need for oxygen increases, inspiration becomes more forceful and the neurons in the ventral group are activated to bring about forceful exhalation. Shortness of breath is termed dyspnea ‚Äì the opposite of eupnea. Clinical significance Depression of the respiratory centre can be caused by: brain trauma, brain damage, a brain tumour, or ischemia. A depression can also be caused by drugs including opioids, and sedatives. The respiratory centre can be stimulated by amphetamine, to produce faster and deeper breaths. Normally at therapeutic doses, this effect is not noticeable, but may be evident when respiration is already compromised.

Most of its subject matter would come under the much larger humanities faculty in the typical English-speaking university. History The concept of Geist dates back to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German idealism, in particular to Herder's and Hegel's concept of a Volksgeist, the alleged common \\"spirit\\", or rather, mind, of a people. To understand the term Geisteswissenschaften, one should bear in mind that the continental faculty of philosophy inherited the medieval faculty of arts. Besides philosophy itself it encompassed the natural sciences with mathematics as well as the philological and historical disciplines and later on psychology and the social sciences. The term Geisteswissenschaften first was used as translation of John Stuart Mill‚Äôs term ‚Äúmoral sciences‚Äù. The historian, philosopher and sociologist Wilhelm Dilthey popularised the term, arguing that psychology and the emerging field of sociology ‚Äì like the philological and historical disciplines ‚Äì should be considered as Geisteswissenschaft rather than as Naturwissenschaft (natural science), and that their methodology should reflect this classification. His arguments were very influential in the theories of the prominent German sociologist Max Weber, though Weber preferred the term Kulturwissenschaft, which has been promoted by his neokantian colleagues (Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert). Current use Since the times of Dilthey it became common to speak of the Naturwissenschaften on the one hand and the 'Geisteswissenschaften' on the other ‚Äì not particularly considering the status of mathematics and of philosophy itself. After the separation of the natural sciences and mathematics into a particular faculty (in some universities not until the 1950s), the Geisteswissenschaften were left alone in the philosophical faculty and even philosophy often was subsumed under the term Geisteswissenschaften. Meanwhile, many of the German universities have split up these faculties in smaller departments, so that the old common interests and the old borders are less visible. The term is now used irregularly. In administrative contexts it is used broadly to discuss how to organise the academic institutions and describe the culture of academic discussions, so that the faculties of Theology and Law are added to the Geisteswissenschaften. In some contexts of science policy the Geisteswissenschaften are described as non-empirical sciences, drawing them near philosophy and excluding the social sciences from their area.Carl Friedrich Gethmann, Dieter Langewiesche, J√ºrgen Mittelstra√ü, Dieter Simon, G√ºnter Stock, Manifest Geisteswissenschaft, ed. by Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin 2005 Welche Religion braucht die Gesellschaft? . In the context of methodology on the contrary it has been emphasised, that Geisteswissenschaften such as history and the philological disciplines, relying on empirical data (documents, books and utterances), along with psychology and the social sciences, have a common empirical character, which is essentially based on comprehension (Verstehen) or understanding of expressions of meaning.Bernward Gr√ºnewald: Geist ‚Äì Kultur ‚Äì Gesellschaft. Versuch einer Prinzipientheorie der Geisteswissenschaften auf transzendentalphilosophischer Grundlage. Berlin: Duncker und Humblot 2009. Other authors, like Rudolf Steiner, used the term Geisteswissenschaft in a historically quite distinct sense to refer to a proposed \\"Science of Spirit\\".  Example usage  From Kulturgeschichte Frankreichs, Suchanek-Fr√∂hlich, p. 633:Kulturgeschichte Frankreichs Suchanek-Fr√∂hlich, Stefan Kr√∂ner Verlag, Stuttgart, 1966 > Man hat Taine vorgeworfen, dass er, dessen Hauptziel die Einf√ºhrung > naturwissenschaftlicher Methoden in die Geisteswissenschaften war, selbst > nicht induktiv, sondern deduktiv vorging.

Since 1 January 2009, it has been an Ortsteil (part) of the municipality Sylt.  Etymology  The name is frequently associated with the marine goddess R√°n (Rantum = R√°n's place). It is, however, more likely that the name derives from the old spelling of Raantem, i.e. \\"settlement at the edge\\". Geography  Rantum today is located at the narrowest part of the island with a width of only 600 metres. East of the village are the Rantum- Inge, an ample area of salt marshes and the Wadden Sea. To the west, beyond the dunes, the beach faces the open North Sea.  History The small village of Rantum has a colourful history. The settlement was destroyed on multiple occasions by storm surges or was buried by sand drift. The oldest record of the name is found in a nautical chart from 1142, which is today displayed in Copenhagen. On the chart, the Rantum church Westerseekirche is noted as a daymark. It was called St. Peter. Since at the time only major churches would be consecrated to St. Peter, it is likely that Rantum was an influential town around 1100. There is, however, no proof for this thesis. As Rantum was repeatedly destroyed by storm surges between 1362 and 1634 and had to be rebuilt in a different location each time, historical records are only preserved from the 17th century on. Well into the 18th century, Rantum was a stronghold of wreckers who looted ships for a living. In 1801, the people of Rantum had to move the village due to encroachment by the dunes. In 1825, the new village was destroyed by a flood. The location of the village kept moving eastward over time. In 1901, the linked Westerland and H√∂rnum via Rantum. It was abolished in 1970. Beginning in 1936, the Wehrmacht had a 568 hectare area of the wadden sea encircled by a dyke and flooded to create the Rantumbecken (Rantum Basin) as a take-off and landing site for seaplanes. In 1977, the small Rantum Harbour was created from the remains of a naval air station pier as a tidally independent marina. Attractions LORAN radiator at Rantum Local sights include the Eidum decoy pond, which served for catching ducks. It is named after the village of Eidum which was drowned in a 1436 flood. Today, the Rantum Basin is a bird sanctuary with more than 60 species to be counted. Since 1962, this has been a protected nature preserve. Since 1993, the Sylt Quelle (Sylt Well) has been pumping mineral water containing iodine for bottling. This water is marketed across the island and can also be tapped on the spot by customers. The brand is offered by restaurants across Germany. In the adjacent Kunstraum, exhibitions, lectures, public discussions and stage plays take place. In addition, this has become the venue for the Meerkabarett, the Sea Cabaret, which annually features various artists during the summer season. The Wadden Sea Conservation Station (Schutzstation Wattenmeer) operates a branch office in Rantum which provides information on coastal management, the Wadden Sea, the salt marshes and offers guided mudflat hiking. A LORAN-C transmitter for radio navigation is located near Rantum, using a tall lattice tower mast radiator as an antenna. The regular service was ended on 31 December 2005. Economy Rantum was designated Nordseebad in 1973. Tourism is the main source of income today. Youth facilities Rantum hosts the Wei√üe Zeltstadt (White Tent City) camp site. During the summer holidays, the Schleswig-Flensburg District Sports Association offers youth camps there. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutsches Schleswig e.V operates a congress venue for youths and a summer school. In the southern part of the village, the Puan Klent youth resort is located. Government Rantum was merged on 1 January 2009 with Sylt-Ost and the town of Westerland. In separate referendums in 2008, Westerland (by a large majority) and Sylt-Ost (narrowly) agreed to the merger in May 2008. Rantum followed. In September 2008, the merger contract was signed. Rantum is now an Ortsteil of Gemeinde Sylt. Since 1 May 2015, the mayor of Gemeinde Sylt has been Nikolas H√§ckel.

It is located north of the town of Westerland and is part of the Amt Landschaft Sylt. The local economy is dominated by tourism. Etymology The name Wenningstedt likely means '\\"homestead of the people of Winni\\". Braderup probably means \\"village on the slope\\". History Tradition holds that in the 5th and 6th century the Angles and Saxons led by Hengist and Horsa sailed from here to conquer England. Reportedly, their raiding party set sail from a harbour in Frisia called Wynningstede. However, this is unproven and even if true, due to coastal erosion, the place they could have sailed from is now located more than 2 kilometres west of the current beach, in the North Sea. According to another tradition, a few hundred metres off today's shoreline there was the ancient settlement of Wendingstedt with an old Frisian port at the west coast. This supposedly was home to 200 fishing boats and was destroyed by a storm in 1300 AD. It is disputed though among scientists if this village ever existed or if it is merely a legend. The first definitive mention of Wenningstedt occurs in 1462. Braderup by contrast is one of the youngest settlements on the geest of Sylt. It is first mentioned in a document in 1540. Until the early 19th century, Wenningstedt remained almost unchanged for centuries, consisting of merely eight farmsteads. The inhabitants lived on agriculture and fishing. Not a few men would also go whaling in the Arctic Sea or sailed on Hamburg ships to catch herring. Since 1859, Wenningstedt has been a seaside resort, since 1960 it has been a recognised seaside spa (Nordseebad). In 1830, Braderup still had more inhabitants than Wenningstedt. Only by the beginning of the 20th century did the latter start to grow faster, boosted by tourism, and the number of inhabitants initially surpassed Braderup only slightly. Together with Kampen and Braderup, Wenningstedt was part of the so-called Northern Villages (Nordd√∂rfer) - an early municipal association on the island. The term was coined when List, the northernmost village on the island, was part of the Danish realm. Thus Wenningstedt, Braderup and Kampen were the German \\"Northernmost Villages\\". This administrative cooperation ended in 1927 when Kampen and Wenninhgstedt became two separate communities, with Braderup becoming part of Wenningstedt. In 1903, the ' (island railway) connected Wenningstedt to Westerland in the south and from 1908 to List in the north. The railway was abolished in 1970. In 1914, a Protestant chapel was built at the village pond. During World War II a heavy coastal artillery battery was deployed in the dunes northwest of Wenningstedt. There was however no combat action; the facilities were blown up in the late 1940s by the Royal Air Force stationed at Westerland and were later completely dismantled and covered with sand by German combat engineers. Architecture and village development Until the mid 19th century, Wenningstedt was dominated by farmsteads in the Uthland Frisian style. The village centre was located by the pond, Kiar. With the rise of tourism, numerous small guest houses but also villas were built for summer tourists. Until then, there had been no regular road network in the village, but due to tourist development new streets and neighbourhoods were planned on the drawing board. As the guest houses more and more avoided the old village core, the new centre gradually migrated to the west, towards the beach. The new style was now leaning towards fashionable seaside resort architecture: two-storey buildings with high-ceilinged rooms and white, wooden porches. The construction boom of the 1950s and 1960s brought about another major change. Simple brick houses were built, very often meant to be small guest houses. In addition the first true summer homes were constructed in the post-war era. In the 1980s and 1990s almost all land that could be covered with buildings inside the village was used, so new constructions regularly meant demolishing old structures. Since the 1980s, almost exclusively holiday apartment houses have been built, some leaning towards a retro-Frisian style - most of them being two-and-a-half storeys buildings with four to six flats. This has not only displaced the traditional family-run guest houses, but it alsodecreased the housing space available for long-term residents of Wenningstedt. Tower blocks like in Westerland have not been built, only some flat blocks were constructed along the main road in the early 1980s. New street names In cooperation with the Amt Landschaft Sylt a revision of street names and house numbering was undertaken, which became effective on 1 January 2006. This revision had become urgent since the extensive construction of the past 50 years had made it difficult for emergency services, postmen and also guests to find their way around. Geography=Municipal subdivisions Wenningstedt-Braderup consists of Wenningstedt on the west coast of Sylt and Braderup, located on the Wadden Sea eastern coast of the island. Due to its significantly higher number of residents, Wenningstedt constitutes the municipality's centre with a communal office, spa bureau and retail businesses. Braderup does not have an original village core but until the mid-19th century was merely a hamlet of a few scattered farmsteads. Even today there are no major tourist facilities or hotels there. Economy Wenningstedt's economy, as everywhere on Sylt, is highly dependent on tourism. There is hardly any industry that is not at least indirectly influenced by the tourism business. Like the immediate hotel and restaurant industry, retailers and several service enterprises are also dependent on the tourists' spending. Tourism Wenningstedt calls itself a \\"families' spa\\" and with about a million overnight stays booked, it is the fifth-largest tourist resort in Schleswig-Holstein. These bookings are distributed among 7,000 guest beds, 2,000 of which are accounted for by the Wenningstedt camping site, roughly 4,000 to holiday apartments and the remainder are shared by hotels and guest houses. Wenningstedt is moreover recognised as a spa in Germany, yet classical spa treatments are almost extinct due to changes in German health insurance regulations. Thus today less than 2% of all tourists are traditional spa guests who have been prescribed a cure. Wenningstedt's value as a health resort is however still uncontested, the North Sea with its stimulating climate enhances one's health and trains the immune system without any additional treatment. The village's spa centre, which once offered cures and applications like taking the waters, massages and balneotherapy, has been closed and demolished. Tourism in Wenningstedt does also profit from two adjacent golf courses that were established in the 1980s. Attractions=Denghoog The Denghoog dolmen, which was built in the Neolithicum around 3000 BC, is located on the northern outskirts of Wenningstedt. Its name means Thing Hill. It is made up of twelve supporting stones that carry a ceiling of stone slabs. It was first excavated in 1868 and since 1928 has been open to the public. Others Wenningstedt village pond Another local attraction is the village pond of Wenningstedt. In the 1950s it was gifted to the municipality by its former owner under the premise that the village keeps it open to the public and preserves it as a place of recreation. The statutes rule that the adjacent buildings have to have thatched roofs in order to maintain the rural charm of the village. Wenningstedt is located at the edge of an area of dunes ending in the Rotes Kliff (Red Cliff) stretching north to Kampen. Below the cliff there is a sandy beach all along the village, which especially in summer serves as a major tourist attraction. Northeast of the village of Braderup there is the Braderup heath. Already in the 1920s this rough landscape was declared a nature reserve. The area borders directly on the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park, where guided mudflat hiking tours are on offer.

With their missioning the Frisians officially became Christian but kept a lot of old traditions, e.g. the Biikebrennen. The first church for Wenningstedt was located in the neighbouring village of Keitum. Only in 1914 the so-called Frisian Chapel was built in the immediate vicinity of an ancient pagan ritual site. Until then, the people of Wenningstedt had to take on the uncomfortable trip to Keitum - only for tourists and only in summer a church service was at times held in the hall of the Friesenhof inn in Wenningstedt. The closest Roman Catholic church is St. Christopher in Westerland. In September 2005, a foundation was established to maintain the Frisian Chapel and the pastor's post. With \\"√ú√ºs Serk - Unsere Kirche\\" (Our church), the Nordd√∂rfer Parish wants to secure its work in the villages of Kampen, Wenningstedt and Braderup. ‚Ç¨ 725,000 have so far been gathered as a founding asset. On a long-term prospect ‚Ç¨1 million is needed. In the meantime, the parish hopes to earn ‚Ç¨50,000 per annum from interest alone to maintain its work. Buddhism The physician and author Paul Dahlke introduced Buddhism to the island in the 1920s. In 1914, he built a \\"Buddhist Home\\" in Wenningstedt, which was supposed to serve as a meeting point and temple for Buddhists on Sylt. He refrained from constructing an already planned Buddhist monastery, though, which would have been the first of its kind on European soil, because he thought the island was not remote enough. However, in 1920, at the spot he had already designated and purchased for his monastery, he erected a \\"Buddha monument\\" which gradually decayed after his death and was eventually torn down in the early 1940s. Today, Buddhism does not play a role on Sylt any more.

The University, modeled after the famous private universities in Cairo and Beirut, was created amid the turmoils of war but in the relatively secure Kurdish region of Iraq. The purpose of founding such a university, according to Dr. Barham Salih was to stimulate reform in the Iraqi education system. Its location, however, was contested by Arab education officials in Baghdad who argued that the university should be built there and not in a region with historically secessionist ambitions.Edward Wong, \\"An American University for Iraq but Not in Baghdad.\\" The New York Times, January 3, 2007.

Early life The son of a member of the Royal Air Force, Keenan was brought up in Swatragh, County Londonderry, before his family moved to Belfast. As a teenager, Keenan moved to England to find work, for a time working as a television repairman in partnership with his brother in Corby, Northamptonshire. During this time he came to the attention of the police when he damaged a cigarette machine, which led to police having his fingerprints on file. Keenan returned to Northern Ireland when the Troubles began, and started working at the Grundig factory in the Finaghy area of Belfast where he acquired a reputation as a radical due to his involvement in factory trade union activities. IRA activity Despite his family having no history of republicanism, Keenan joined the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1970 or 1971, and by August 1971 was the quartermaster of the Belfast Brigade. Keenan was an active IRA member, planning bombings in Belfast and travelling abroad to make political contacts and arrange arms smuggling, acquiring contacts in East Germany, Libya, Lebanon and Syria. In 1972, Keenan travelled to Tripoli to meet with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in order to acquire arms and finance from his government. In early 1973 Keenan took over responsibility for control of the IRA's bombing campaign in England and also became IRA Quartermaster General.The Provisional IRA, p. 254.A Secret History of the IRA, p. 137. In late 1973 Keenan was the linchpin of the kidnap of his former employer at Grundig, director Thomas Niedermayer.Those in office must admit their part in our dirty war In early 1974, Keenan planned to break Gerry Adams and Ivor Bell out of Long Kesh using a helicopter, in a method similar to Seamus Twomey's escape from Mountjoy Prison in October 1973, but the plan was vetoed by Billy McKee.The Provisional IRA, p. 345. Keenan was arrested in the Republic of Ireland in mid-1974 and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for IRA membership.The Provisional IRA, p. 256. On 17 March 1975 he was shot and wounded while attempting to lead a mass escape from Portlaoise Prison. While being held in Long Kesh, Gerry Adams helped to devise a blueprint for the reorganisation of the IRA, which included the use of covert cells and the establishment of a Southern Command and Northern Command.A Secret History of the IRA, pp. 156-157. As the architects of the blueprint‚ÄîAdams, Bell and Brendan Hughes‚Äîwere still imprisoned, Martin McGuinness and Keenan toured the country trying to convince the IRA Army Council and middle leadership of the benefits of the restructuring plan, with one IRA member remarking \\"Keenan was a roving ambassador for Adams\\". The proposal was accepted after Keenan won support from the South Derry Brigade, East Tyrone Brigade and South Armagh Brigade, with one IRA member saying \\"Keenan was really the John the Baptist to Adams' Christ\\".A Secret History of the IRA, p. 159. In December 1975, members of an IRA unit based in London were arrested following the six-day Balcombe Street Siege. The IRA unit had been active in England since late 1974 carrying out a series of bombings, and a few months after his release from prison Keenan visited the unit in Crouch Hill, London, to give it further instructions. In follow-up raids after the siege, police discovered crossword puzzles in his handwriting and his fingerprints on a list of bomb parts. A warrant was issued for his arrest. Garda S√≠och√°na informer Sean O'Callaghan claimed that Keenan recommended IRA Chief of Staff Seamus Twomey to authorise an attack on Ulster Protestants in retaliation to an increase in sectarian attacks on Catholic civilians by Protestant loyalist paramilitaries, such as the killing of three Catholics in a gun and bomb attack by the Ulster Volunteer Force on Donnelly's Bar in Silverbridge, County Armagh on 19 December 1975. According to O'Callaghan \\"Keenan believed that the only way, in his words, to put the nonsense out of the Prods [Protestants] was to just hit back much harder and more savagely than them\\". Soon after the sectarian Kingsmill massacre occurred, when ten Protestant men returning home from their work were ordered out of a minibus they were travelling in, and executed en masse with a machine gun on 5 January 1976. Arrest and imprisonment Keenan was arrested on the basis of the 1975 warrant near Banbridge on 20 March 1979 when the Royal Ulster Constabulary stopped two cars travelling north on the main road from Dublin to Belfast, and was extradited to England to face charges relating to the Balcombe Street Gang's campaign in England. The capture of Keenan was a blow to the IRA, in particular as he was carrying an address book listing his contacts including Palestinian activists in the United Kingdom. The IRA responded by despatching Bobby Storey and three other members to break Keenan out of prison using a helicopter, but all four were arrested and remanded to Brixton Prison. Keenan stood trial at the Old Bailey in London in June 1980 defended by Michael Mansfield, and was accused of organising the IRA's bombings in England and being implicated in the deaths of eight people including Ross McWhirter and Gordon Hamilton-Fairley. Keenan was sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment after being found guilty on 25 June 1980. Keenan continued to support Gerry Adams while in prison. In August 1982 Adams was granted permission by the IRA's Army Council to stand in a forthcoming election to the Northern Ireland Assembly, having been refused permission at a meeting the previous month.A Secret History of the IRA, pp. 215-216. In a letter sent from Leicester Prison Keenan wrote that he \\"emphatically\\" supported the move and endorsed the Army Council's decision, saying: > It is not enough for Republicans to say, with reference to the Army [IRA], > actions speak louder than words. We must never forsake action but the final > war to win will be the savage war of peace. To those of us who have > struggled for years in a purely military capacity, it must be obvious that > if we do not provide honest, recognisable political leadership on the > ground, we will lose that war for peace. Peace process Keenan was released from prison in June 1993 and by 1996 was one of seven members of the IRA's Army Council. Following the events after the IRA's ceasefire of August 1994 he had been openly critical of Gerry Adams and the \\"tactical use of armed struggle\\", or TUAS, strategy employed by the republican movement.A Secret History of the IRA, p. 446. After the Northern Ireland peace process had become deadlocked over the issue of the IRA decommissiong its arms, Keenan and the other members of the Army Council authorised the Docklands bombing which killed two people and marked the end of the IRA's eighteen-month ceasefire in February 1996. Keenan outlined the IRA's public position in May 1996 at a ceremony in memory of hunger striker Se√°n McCaughey at Milltown Cemetery, where he stated \\"The IRA will not be defeated...Republicans will have our victory...Do not be confused about decommissioning. The only thing the Republican movement will accept is the decommissioning of the British state in this country\\". In the same speech he accused the British of \\"double-dealing\\" and denounced the Irish government as \\"spineless\\". In November 1998 Keenan addressed a republican rally in Cullyhanna, County Armagh to mark the 25th anniversary of the death of IRA member Michael McVerry.Bandit Country, pp. 448-449. He stated: > I can categorically state the only time the IRA will decommission, we will > decommission in agreement with a government of national democracy, a > government that derives from the first D√°il. That's when we will > decommission‚Äînever, ever before...Everybody's saying: 'The prisoners are > being released, what's your problem?' Well there's no prisoner was ever in > jail to be let out to sell out the struggle and I'm sure none of them would > want to be let out if this struggle wasn't going the whole way. Keenan continued by saying that if republican demands were not met then British Prime Minister Tony Blair would be responsible for the consequences, and went on to say: > So in the future maybe the jails are going to be full again...If our enemies > don't want peace, there can only be one conclusion: they must want war. We > don't want to go back to that. But let there be no mistake: if we don't get > equality and if the reasons for conflict are still there...then the waiting > time will soon draw to a close and republicans will once again have to do > anything that is necessary to get a Republic, because that's the goal. On 25 February 2001 Keenan addressed a republican rally in Creggan, County Armagh, saying that republicans should not fear \\"this phase\\" of \\"the revolution\\" collapsing should the Good Friday Agreement fail. Keenan confirmed his continued commitment to the Armalite and ballot box strategy, saying that both political negotiations and violence were \\"legitimate forms of revolution\\" and that both \\"have to be prosecuted to the utmost\\". Keenan went on to say \\"The revolution can never be over until we have British imperialism where it belongs‚Äîin the dustbin of history\\", a message aimed at preventing rank-and- file IRA activists defecting to the dissident Real IRA. Keenan played a key role in the peace process, acting as the IRA's go-between with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. Gerry Adams remarked \\"There wouldn't be a peace process if it wasn't for Brian Keenan\\". Keenan resigned from his position on the Army Council in 2005 due to ill-health, and was replaced by Bernard Fox, who had taken part in the 1981 Irish hunger strike. On 6 May 2007 Keenan was guest speaker at a rally in Cappagh, County Tyrone to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the deaths of the so-called \\"Loughgall Martyrs\\", eight members of the IRA East Tyrone Brigade killed by the Special Air Service in 1987. Provisional IRA Chief of Staff It is alleged by the Irish Independent and The Daily Telegraph that Keenan succeeded Thomas \\"Slab\\" Murphy as Chief of Staff of the Provisional IRA at some point between the late 1990s and the mid-2000s before he relinquished the role to deal with his poor health caused by cancer. Death Keenan died of cancer on 21 May 2008 in Cullyhanna, South Armagh.

Life Cohn was born in Neustrelitz, Mecklenburg on 28 September 1854. He was the son of August Cohn, a lawyer, and Charlotte Cohn. At the age of 17, Cohn began to study jurisprudence at the University of Leipzig. However, at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg and the University of Strasbourg he began to study physics. In Strasbourg, he graduated in 1879. From 1881 to 1884, he was an assistant of August Kundt at the physical institute. In 1884 he habilitated in theoretical physics and was admitted as a private lecturer. From 1884 to 1918, he was a faculty member of the University of Strasbourg and was nominated as an assistant professor on 27 September 1884. He dealt with experimental physics at first, and then turned completely to theoretical physics. In 1918 he was nominated as an extraordinary professor. After the end of World War I and the occupation of Alsace-Lorraine by France, Cohn and his family were expelled from Strasbourg on the Christmas Eve of 1918. In April 1919, he was nominated as a professor at the University of Rostock. From June 1920, he gave lectures about theoretical physics at the University of Freiburg. In 1935 he retired in Heidelberg where he lived until 1939. He resigned from the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG) together with other physicists like Richard Gans, Leo Graetz, George Jaff√©, Walter Kaufmann, in protest at the despotism of the Nazi regime. Cohn was a baptized Protestant and was married with Marie Goldschmidt (1864‚Äì1950), with whom he had two daughters. Because of his Jewish descent he found himself forced to emigrate to Switzerland because of the pressure under the Nazi regime. He lived in Hasliberg-Hohfluh at first, and from 1942 in Ringgenberg, Switzerland, where he died at the age of 90. Cohn's younger brother, Carl Cohn (1857‚Äì1931) was a successful overseas merchant from Hamburg, who worked from 1921 until 1929 as a senator in Hamburg. Work : At the beginning of the 20th century, Cohn was one of the most respectable experts in the area of theoretical electrodynamics. He was unsatisfied with the Lorentzian theory of electrodynamics for moving bodies and proposed an independent theory. His alternative theory, which was based on a modification of the Maxwell field- equations, was compatible to all relevant electrodynamic and optical experiments known at that time (1900‚Äì1904), including the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment (MMX) of 1887. Cohn's electrodynamics of moving bodies was based on the assumption that light travels within the Earth's atmosphere with a constant velocity - however, his theory suffered from internal failures. While the theory predicted the negative result of MMX within air, a positive result would be expected within vacuum. Another weak point stems from the fact, that his concept was formulated without the use of atoms and electrons. So after 1905 his theory was superseded by Hendrik Lorentz's and Albert Einstein's. Regarding his own theory (developed in 1900 and 1901), he used the Principle of Economy to eliminate the known concept of luminiferous aether (but also the concept of atoms) and argued that one can simply call it vacuum. He also maintained that one can use a frame of reference in which the fixed stars are at rest. As a heuristic concept this can be described as a material \\"aether\\", but in Cohn's opinion this would be only \\"metaphorical\\" and would not affect the consequences of his theory.Cohn, 1901, pp. 98-99. He also incorporated the transformation equations x'=x-vt and t'=t-vx/c¬≤ introduced by Lorentz in 1895 into his theory, calling them the \\"Lorentzian Transformation\\" ().Cohn, 1900, p. 519. In 1905 this name (for transformations valid to all orders in v/c) was altered by Henri Poincar√© into the commonly used expression \\"Lorentz transformation\\". In 1904 he compared his theory with Lorentz's mature 1904 theory, employing physical interpretations of the Lorentz transformation that were similar to those later used in Albert Einstein's special relativity in 1905. For instance, local time was described by him as a consequence of the assumption that light propagates in spherical waves with constant velocity in all directions (a similar definition was already given by Poincar√© in 1900). He also illustrated the effects of length contraction and time dilation by using moving rods and clocks. He critically remarked that the distinction between \\"true time\\" and \\"local time\\" in Lorentz's theory is artificial, because it cannot be verified by experiment. However, Cohn himself believed that the validity of Lorentz's theory is limited to optical phenomena, whereas in his own theory it is possible that mechanical clocks might indicate the \\"true\\" time.Darrigol (2000), p. 368Janssen/Stachel (2004), pp. 31-32 Later in 1911 (after his own theory was disproved), Cohn accepted the relativity principle of \\"Lorentz and Einstein\\" and wrote a summary on special relativity, which was applauded by Einstein.Miller (1981), p. 182 SourcesPublications *; Second edition Berlin 1927: Das elektromagnetische Feld - Ein Lehrbuch  * :*Wikisource translation: On the Electrodynamics of Moving Systems I * :*Wikisource translation: On the Electrodynamics of Moving Systems II * *\\"Physikalisches √ºber Raum und Zeit\\", Himmel und Erde XIII, 117‚Äì136 (1911); auch als Brosch√ºre ver√∂ffentlicht: Physikalisches √ºber Raum und Zeit, Berlin/Leipzig 1920, 4.

Tragically, Kurd von Mosengeil died in a mountaineering accident in Tyrol in September 1906, as he was completing his doctoral dissertation. Planck and Wilhelm Wien edited his draft for publication in the Annalen der Physik in 1907. The resulting posthumous paper (Theorie der station√§ren Strahlung in einem gleichf√∂rmig bewegten Hohlraum, en:Theory of stationary radiation in a uniformly moving cavity) contains the correct relativistic expression for the temperature of a moving body among other equations of relativistic thermodynamics and a statement of the mass-energy equivalence inspired by the work of Friedrich Hasen√∂hrl (1904). Planck vouched personally for the scientific content of von Mosengeil's dissertation and believed in its lasting value. Von Mosengeil's results help break new ground in further researches by Planck (1907) and Einstein (1908).

The show's original run was hosted by Lana Coc-Kroft, Marc Ellis, Leigh Hart, Graeme Hill, Ric Salizzo and reporter Eva Evguenieva. In 2001 Leigh Hart was added to the cast under his persona of 'That Guy'. The show first screened on New Zealand television in 1996 on Sky Sport; however, those without a Sky subscription could view SportsCafe without a UHF Sky decoder by tuning their TV to the Sky Sport UHF channel, as the signal was not scrambled during this show. In 2002, SportsCafe moved to Sky 1 and in 2003 to TV2 (TVNZ 2). It featured interviews with current sports stars and comical skits about sports. Each episode lasted 60 minutes, including commercials. The show was pulled at the end of 2005 after the 'Celebrity Drug Scandal' but it is understood that this was not the reason for the show going off the air. The grand final screened November 23, 2005 and at the end of the show the presenters actually destroyed the set on the air, as The Exponents played their hit song \\"Why Does Love Do This To Me?\\". On Sunday June 22, 2008, it was announced in the Herald on Sunday newspaper that SportsCafe would return for a final season, to begin on July 9, 2008. The show featured most of the original cast, and aired on Wednesday nights at 9.30 pm on TV2. In 2011, SportsCafe returned for three exclusive online episodes, in order to celebrate New Zealand's hosting of the Rugby World Cup later in the year. Three shows were confirmed, and broadcast on July 8, 15 and 22. Recordings of these episodes can be found on YouTube.  National Nude Day  \\"National Nude Day\\" was a mock public holiday created when Marc Ellis challenged SportsCafe viewers to streak in front of then Prime Minister Helen Clark. The show ran an event each year inviting viewers to submit photos and video of themselves performing daily activities in the nude, which was continued on the internet (rebranded as \\"World Nude Day\\" or \\"International Nude Day\\") until around 2009. A number of student pubs in Ellis' home town of Dunedin offered special deals for nude patrons on the day. Internet collections of world holidays mark the day as 14 July; in fact it was held at the organizers' whim, having variously fallen on 19 September and 6 February.

The fifth-ranked Michigan Wolverines defeated #24 UCLA by a point, 24‚Äì23. This began a ten-game winning streak for Michigan, the biggest win was a 24‚Äì10 win at Illinois that ultimately gave the Big Ten title to Michigan, over the runner-up Illini.

It was a third- straight berth in the Rose Bowl for the Trojans, but they had lost the previous two, the only such streak in USC history (through , no Pac-12 team has done so since). The previous western team to lose consecutively was California, which dropped three straight (1949‚Äì1951) while representing the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). Game summary The game was expected to be a tight physical defensive struggle, and it was. USC scored first, when quarterback Todd Marinovich ran for a touchdown and led 10‚Äì3 at halftime, but Michigan came back to tie the score in the third quarter. Midway through the fourth quarter, Michigan faced a 4th-and-2 at its own 46-yard line. The normally conservative Schembechler called for a fake punt and it worked to perfection as punter Chris Stapleton rambled 24 yards for what would have been a first down, but Michigan was called for holding. On the resultant drive, USC scored the winning touchdown with just over a minute to play. At the end of the game, Schembechler walked off the field as head coach for the last time, refusing interview requests; he remained briefly as the athletic director, a post he gained concurrently in 1988. A few days later, he announced he was leaving Michigan to become the president of the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball.

The original name of this Buddhist shrine is uncertain. Pawon literally means \\"kitchen\\" in Javanese language, which is derived from the root word awu or dust. The connection to the word \\"dust\\" also suggests that this temple was probably built as a tomb or mortuary temple for a king.Soetarno, Drs. R. second edition (2002). \\"Aneka Candi Kuno di Indonesia\\" (Ancient Temples in Indonesia), pp. 103. Dahara Prize. Semarang. . Pawon from the word Per-awu-an (place that contains dust), a temple that houses the dust of cremated king. However who was the personage that entombed here is still unknown. Local people name this temple as \\"Bajranalan\\" based on the name of the village. Bajranalan is derived from the sanskrit word Vajra (thunder or also a Buddhist ceremonial tool) and Anala (fire, flame). In the contemporary era during the full moon in May or June, Buddhists in Indonesia observe Vesak annual ritual by walking from Mendut passing through Pawon and ends at Borobudur.  Architecture  The temple slightly faces northwest and stands on a square base. Each sides of the stairs and the top of the gates are adorned with carved Kala-Makara, commonly found in classic Javanese temples. The outer wall of Pawon is carved with reliefs of boddhisattvas and taras. There are also reliefs of kalpataru (tree of life), flanked between Kinnara- Kinnari. The square chamber inside is empty with a square basin in the center of it. Rectangular small windows were found, probably for ventilation. The roof section of is crowned with five small stupas and four small ratnas. Because of its relative simplicity, symmetry and harmony, the historians dubbed this small temple as \\"the jewel of Javanese temple architecture\\", in contrast with tall-slender East Javanese style counterparts as found in later Singhasari and Majapahit period.

Michigan fullback Leroy Hoard was named the Player of the Game.2008 Rose Bowl Program , 2008 Rose Bowl. Retrieved January 26, 2008. It marked consecutive Rose Bowl wins for the Big Ten, which had only two victories (1974, 1981) in the previous eighteen (1970‚Äì1987). Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler's record in the game improved to . Under second-year head coach Larry Smith, USC lost consecutive Rose Bowls for the only time in its history, and through , no Pac-12 team has done so since. The previous western team to lose consecutively was California, which lost three straight (1949‚Äì1951) while representing the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). This was the first of 22 Rose Bowls televised by ABC; it had been on NBC since the first television broadcast in January 1952. Because New Year's Day was on a Sunday in 1989, the game was played the next day. Both teams returned the following year for a rematch, with a different result. Teams=Michigan Wolverines Michigan opened the season with consecutive narrow losses to Notre Dame and Miami (FL) who were ranked #13 and #1 respectively at the time. But they recovered to go unbeaten the rest of the way, their only blemish being a 17‚Äì17 tie at Iowa. A 17‚Äì3 win over defending Big 10 champ Michigan State proved to be the difference as Michigan won the Big 10 by one game over Michigan State. USC Trojans USC opened the season with nine straight wins and rose to #2 in the rankings. They faced sixth ranked rival UCLA, who was 9‚Äì1 and had been ranked #1 for a couple of weeks earlier. The game in Pasadena was one of the notable ones in the UCLA‚ÄìUSC rivalry in that it was for the Pac-10 championship (Rose Bowl berth), and a possible Heisman Trophy for either starting quarterback, Troy Aikman of UCLA or Rodney Peete of USC. Peete was found to have measles in the days before the game; USC used a strong ground game and \\"bend but don't break\\" defense, in front of the largest Rose Bowl regular season crowd in history, to beat the Bruins 31‚Äì22. The win set up a rare #2 USC vs. #1 Notre Dame matchup the following week in Los Angeles, which the undefeated Irish dominated, 27‚Äì10. It was the fifth straight loss for the Trojans in the annual rivalry, a winless streak that continued until 1996. Game summary Behind the passing of Heisman Trophy runner-up Rodney Peete and running of Aaron Emmanuel, USC score two touchdowns in the second quarter and took a 14‚Äì3 to halftime. Despite their lack of early success, Michigan stuck with its pounding running attack led by a huge offensive line and running back (and game MVP) Leroy Hoard. They began to wear down the Trojans and USC's offense began to sputter. By the fourth quarter, Michigan's offensive line took over and the Wolverines took a 22‚Äì14 lead into the last two minutes. Peete tried to lead the Trojans to a touchdown and game tying two-point conversion but Michigan's defense forced an interception to effectively end the game.

When the last generating units were commissioned, it was the largest power station in the southern hemisphere, with a capacity of 375 megawatts (MW) from eleven turbo-alternators. It was able to supply up to one third of the state's electricity needs at the time. It remained the most powerful until the completion of Vales Point Power Station in 1966. In 1924, the 117 acre site for the power station was chosen. The station was located on Bunnerong Road in Matraville.  Bunnerong 'A' Station - 175 MW  Bunnerong was originally built with eighteen cross drum boilers from Babcock & Wilcox Ltd (UK), supplying steam at and , with each boiler producing of steam. Six 25 megawatt (MW) Metropolitan-Vickers two-cylinder turbo-alternators were built between 1926 and 1930 by the Electricity Department of the Municipal Council of Sydney, one of the two main authorities responsible for electricity generation at the time. The first turbo-alternator commenced operation in January 1929, and the sixth in January 1930. Current was generated at 11 kilovolts (kV) and stepped up to 33 kV for transmission. With a capacity of 150 MW, Bunnerong was the largest power station in New South Wales. A seventh 25 MW unit was brought into use in September 1937, expanding capacity to 175 MW. This original installation was later known as Bunnerong 'A' Station.  Bunnerong 'B' Station - 200 MW  Bunnerong 'B' Station began operation in 1939, with the commissioning of a 3-stage 50 MW turbo-alternator(No8) supplied by C.A. Parsons and Company. A second 50 MW turbine(No9) followed in 1941, bringing the capacity of Bunnerong to 275 MW. Bunnerong 'B' Boilerhouse had four Babcock & Wilcox pulverized fuel boilers, each produced 300,000lbs/hr of steam at 600psi. In 1949, two oil fired, Velox boilers from Gibson, Battle & Co Pty Ltd of Sydney were added. Each could produce an additional 165,000lbs/hr of steam at 600PSI and 825degF. Being a range type station these Velox boilers could supply steam to either A or B stations. The boilers of 'A' Station suffered from reduced efficiency and clinker-related shutdowns owing to shortages of high grade hand-selected coal after the mechanization of mining began. The more modern 'B' Station was designed to handle the lower quality, impure coal extracted in mechanized mining, but supply difficulties meant that it often received the high grade product intended for 'A' Station. In 1946, supplementary oil burners were fitted to every boiler, to mitigate the consequences of coal shortages and quality issues. A third 50 MW Parsons turbo-alternator was commissioned in 1947, followed by a fourth identical unit. These final two machines were fed by four Simon-Carves pulverized fuel boilers rated at 300,000lb/hour, exhausting to a large concrete chimney. The completion of Bunnerong 'B' Station increased the total capacity to a continuously-rated 375 MW, making Bunnerong the largest power station in the southern hemisphere. During overload testing in 1958, a maximum of 382 MW was achieved. After the completion of 'B' Station, more than 1,600 people were employed on the site. A number of industrial disputes relating to unsatisfactory working conditions resulted in reduced power output, sometimes for weeks on end.  Bunnerong Railway Branch  The Council operated its own private railway which connected the power station with Botany Goods Yard.Bunnerong Power Station Railway Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin September, 1948 p30 The railway continued to operate as a private line when the power station was taken over by the Electricity Commission, including the shunting of a siding to the Boral plant. On 19 November 1966, there was a fatal accident when a train ran away down the steep grade of this siding.Runnaway Train on the Bunnerong Branch Oakes, John Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, February, 2000 pp 50-55. A ladder leading to an underground chamber Former train line for the power plant  Electricity Commission of New South Wales  The Electricity Commission of New South Wales was formed in 1950, and assumed control of the generating assets of the Sydney County Council (which had taken over the Municipal Council of Sydney's power stations in 1936), including Bunnerong and Pyrmont in 1952. Closure and Demolition With the completion of newer power stations, Bunnerong 'A' was out of use by 1973, 'B' Station was relegated to emergency supply duties, and the entire installation was finally decommissioned in 1975. The removal of equipment began in 1978 and was largely completed by 1981. Peak load gas turbines were in use on the site from 1982 to 1984, but demolition commenced after their removal. The 112 metre-high concrete emission stack of Bunnerong 'B' boilerhouse was demolished in December 1986, and the majority of the huge structures of 'A' and 'B' Stations were razed by 28 June 1987. Demolition was largely undertaken by the American company, Controlled Demolition Incorporated. The large switch house dating from 1926 remained in place until its levelling in March 1994. Few traces of the power station remain.

This includes those medical schools in Ireland, previously part of the United Kingdom, that are now part of the Irish education system. England= London  Most of the teaching hospitals in London were founded centuries before the University of London. Their students qualified with diplomas from the Royal College of Surgeons and/or the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, and latterly (until 1999) the Conjoint diplomas of MRCS, LRCP. When London University degrees became available, the other diplomas were often attempted first. Until recent decades, most of the pre-clinical output of the Oxford and Cambridge universities went to the London teaching hospitals: they could return to their original universities to take their medical degrees, or take the London qualifications. Small numbers went elsewhere in the UK, e.g. to the University of Edinburgh, and rarely further afield, such as to Harvard University. Before medical education became systematically ordered in the 19th century, it was possible to count attendance at a London teaching hospital towards an Edinburgh or Glasgow degree. Provincial The Durham University School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health operated at Durham University's Queen's Campus in Stockton-upon- Tees from 2001 to 2017, when it was transferred to Newcastle University. Ireland= Dublin  The Catholic University of Ireland's School of Medicine was set up in Dublin under British rule in 1855. The university's qualifications were not recognised by the state, but the medical students were able to take the licentiate examinations of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, which still runs the last surviving non-university medical school in the British Isles. The Catholic University's school became independent in 1892 and in 1909 became part of University College, Dublin, and its students thereafter took the MB BCh BAO degrees of the National University of Ireland. Scotland= Edinburgh  In Edinburgh, students accumulated \\"duly performed\\" certificates from classes and clinics to become eligible to take the examinations. For the university exams, at least half of the classes had to be in the university, but the rest could be from teachers recognised by the Royal Colleges (a kind of Privatdozent system, as this could be a stepping stone to a university post) in the 19th century. A number of small private anatomy schools and medical schools were collectively known as the extramural school. Both university and extramural students could qualify with the Triple Qualification, the licentiate exams of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons. Polish School of Medicine (Polish Medical Faculty) at the University of Edinburgh This school operated in Edinburgh from 1941 to 1949, originally to provide doctors for I Polish Army Corps which had been evacuated to Britain after the fall of France in World War II. At first it enabled medical students from the Polish universities, which had all been closed by the German administration, to complete their courses and qualify. Instruction and examination were mostly in Polish. As well as the University's facilities, the Paderewski Hospital was set up on the Western General Hospital site. It was not feasible to move the school as a unit to Poland after the liberation. The school was both a faculty of the University of Edinburgh and a university authorised by the Polish government in exile (in London), and the Dean also had the powers of a Polish Rector Magnificus. Of 337 students enrolled, 227 graduated, 38 transferred to British universities and 71 discontinued their studies. The school awarded both British degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery and a Polish Dyplom Lekarza on the same bilingual Latin- Polish certificate. Nineteen progressed to Doctor of Medicine (MD).J Brodzki Polish School of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd 1942 64 ppW Tomaszewski The University of Edinburgh and Poland. A historical review. Edinburgh: 1968University of Edinburgh Polish School of Medicine web site In the late 19th century the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women taught students at Surgeons' Square with clinical teaching at Leith Hospital. The Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women operated at 31 Chambers Street from 1889 until it merged with the Royal Colleges School of Medicine in 1916.  Glasgow  The Glasgow Medical School had an extramural component similar to that of the University of Edinburgh. Anderson's University/College (the non degree-granting precursor of Strathclyde University) had its own Medical Faculty from 1800 to 1887, when the parent institution became part of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College. Its most famous alumnus was David Livingstone. Anderson's College Medical School became independent in 1887. It prepared students for the Triple Qualification diploma (LRCPE, LRCSEd, LRFPSG) which was the Scottish equivalent of the English Conjoint examinations, but not for the University of Glasgow's degrees. This school was attended by large numbers of Americans who were excluded from US East Coast schools by the Jewish quotas applied there before World War II: these included Arthur Sackler, Mortimer Sackler and Raymond Sackler. It was absorbed into the University of Glasgow's Faculty of Medicine in 1947. The building adjacent to the Western Infirmary remained in use for decades. St Mungo's College Medical School was set up in 1876 by the medical teachers of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI), after the university had migrated westwards and set up the new Western Infirmary for clinical teaching. At first their students could not take the university examinations. St Mungo's College also had a non-university law school, which prepared accountants and law agents but not advocates. In 1947 it was absorbed into the University of Glasgow's Faculty of Medicine, whose teaching departments remain based within GRI to the present day. The college buildings on the GRI campus remained in use until 1982, when the teaching departments moved into the-then new Queen Elizabeth Building - a multi-storey car park now stands on the site of St. Mungo's College.

Raymond, born in Vienna, was the third child (after two daughters) of Vinzenz Vesely, an employee of the Austrian state railway system, and his wife Henriette, n√©e Dluhos. Both parents were of Czech descent. They intended their son to study mining after high school, and pursure a career in the civil service. After the premature death of both his parents, Raymond studied at a commercial academy and trained as a banker. Raymond composed operetta music as well as copious pieces for films and Schlager, which were very successful in the 1920s and 1930s and were commonly heard being sung and whistled in the streets. He became world-famous with his 1925 composition \\"\\" (\\"I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg\\"), and his pieces were considered to be very much in the typical style of the 1920s, especially \\"\\" (\\"I Saw Miss Helen Bathing\\") or \\"\\" (\\"I Lost An Eyelash\\"). Due to a weak heart, he spent his military service with a propaganda company which served the Belgrade military transmitter. After the war, he took a short break from the Salzburg Radio Orchestra to go to Hamburg, where he finished his last two operettas, Geliebte Manuela (Beloved Manuela) and Flieder aus Wien (Lilacs from Vienna). In 1951, he moved to a new home in √úberlingen, where he spent three years with his young wife Eva-Maria before dying of a heart failure shortly before the birth of their son, Thomas. His marble grave is located in √úberlingen, on the shore of Lake Constance, and is decorated with a lyre.

He played in the Football League for Brighton & Hove Albion until injury put an end to his professional career, and then played for many years in non-league football in Sussex. After being assistant manager at Burgess Hill Town, he resumed his playing career with Shoreham in 2018. Career Tuck was associated with Brighton & Hove Albion as a schoolboy, and joined the club as a YTS trainee in 1991. He made his first-team debut on 28 September 1993 in the Football League Trophy, and his Second Division debut four days later at the Goldstone Ground in the starting eleven for a goalless draw with Exeter City. Tuck went on to make 93 league appearances, scoring once, and captained Albion on several occasions. He appeared at left back in the final game at the Goldstone Ground, against Doncaster Rovers in 1997, and the following week played the full 90 minutes against Hereford United in the game that secured Albion's status as a Football League team. Tuck missed the last couple of months of the 1997‚Äì98 season with a groin problem that required surgery. He played the whole of Brighton's first three fixtures of the 1998‚Äì99 season, but those were his last at Football League level. He received specialist advice that he should \\"take things easy\\" as he recovered from the surgery, and ended up retiring from full-time football. Tuck signed for Isthmian League Division One club Worthing on a non-contract basis in January 2000, where he began as cover for the injured Mark Knee and finished up winning both the Supporters' and the Players' Player of the Year awards for 2000‚Äì01. In October 2001, feeling he had \\"gone as far as [he] can with Worthing\\", Tuck joined Southern League Division One club Eastbourne Borough. He remained for nearly five years, won both Player of the Year awards in the 2003‚Äì04 season, and was voted Player of the Round for the 2004‚Äì05 FA Cup fourth qualifying round. He captained the team as they reached the 2005 Conference North/South play-off final, and scored a \\"wonder goal\\" from in the semifinal against Thurrock, but Borough lost the final 2‚Äì1 to Altrincham. After missing much of pre-season with a calf injury, Tuck started the 2006‚Äì07 season out of favour. He spent a brief spell on loan at Isthmian League Burgess Hill Town, He played twice more for Borough, taking his appearance total to 228 in all competitions, and then moved on, to Conference South rivals Bognor Regis Town. A serious achilles tendon injury in March 2007 put an early end to Tuck's season, but he was still chosen as Bognor's Player of the Year. He was expected to return later in the year once his recovery was complete, but instead rejoined Burgess Hill Town in December. He took on a coaching role as well as playing, until an ankle problem put an early end to his on-field season in January 2009. After manager Jamie Howell was dismissed in March, Tuck was interviewed for the vacancy, but turned it down and left the club. He rejoined Bognor Regis Town ahead of the 2009‚Äì10 season, announced his retirement from the game in October, and signed for Eastbourne Town in January 2010. Tuck joined Whitehawk for the 2010‚Äì11 Isthmian League season, and remained as part of the team that won the 2011‚Äì12 Isthmian League Division One South title as well as the Sussex Senior Cup final, in which they beat Crawley Down at Brighton's Falmer Stadium. He signed for Burgess Hill Town for a third time, initially on loan, and was then appointed assistant manager in November 2012 after Adam Hinshelwood stepped down. Tuck was mentioned in connection with the managerial vacancy at Bognor Regis Town in May 2017. Tuck made a rare start for Burgess Hill Town in the Sussex Senior Cup in January 2018 against Saltdean United, but was sent off early in the second half for a second yellow card. He left the Hillians in September 2018 and subsequently signed as a player for Shoreham where he appeared alongside his son Josh. Personal life Tuck was born in Brighton and attended Stanley Deason Secondary School in Whitehawk. In 2015, he was working as a PE teacher at Varndean School in Brighton.

The difference is that White has not yet played c4, and therefore retains some options. If White plays an early c4, the opening will transpose into a King's Indian. It is also possible for White to support an early e4 advance, transposing into the Pirc Defence. Unless transposition is reached, there are four popular, independent continuations: * 3.g3 (the Przepi√≥rka variation, closely related to the Fianchetto Variation of the King's Indian) * 3.Bg5 (the Torre system, which may be considered a variant of the Torre Attack) * 3.Bf4 (the London system) * 3.Nc3 (the Barry Attack)Kenilworth Chess Club, http://www.kenilworthchessclub.org/kenilworthian/2005/11/barry-attack- bibliography.html The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings classifies the East Indian Defence under A49 for the Przepi√≥rka variation and A48 for the others. Fianchetto without c4 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.g3 is the King's Indian, Fianchetto without c4. This can also be reached by 1.Nf3 lines. Black almost always plays 3...Bg7. White can play 4.c4 or 4.Bg2. After 4.Bg2, Black can play ...0-0, ...d5, or ...d6. 4...d5 gives the Neo-Grunfeld Defence with 5.c4 or 5.0-0 0-0 6.c4. 4...d6 is the same as 4...0-0 with 5.c4 0-0 or 5.0-0 0-0. After 4...0-0, White can play 5.c4 or 5.0-0. With move 5.0-0, Black can play ...d6 or ...d5. 5...d5 gives the Neo-Grunfeld Defence after 6.c4.

Georgia. It is named after the medieval Georgian poet Shota Rustaveli. History The establishment and development of the educational system in Adjara was a long-time endeavor of the Georgian community. In 1893 the issue was raised to open a Boys‚Äô Gymnasium in Batumi. On 26‚Äì27 June 1893 the Municipality of the city granted 2 623, 95 sq/m area of land for the Boys‚Äô Gymnasium at the seaside. The project was designed by a military engineer Sedelnikov. The first floor of the building allocated a gym while the second floor contained the church, assembly hall, eight classrooms, art classroom, physics study-room, laboratory and a library. The Boys‚Äô Gymnasium started functioning in July, 1897. On 26 September 1900 it became possible to open a Women's Gymnasium as well. Later, by 1923, a Pedagogical Institute was founded in the building of former Women's Gymnasium (present Public School No.2) which afterwards turned into a Pedagogical College. It used to prepare the first stage school teachers. In the building of the Boys‚Äô Gymnasium in 1935 a 2-year Teacher's Institute was opened with 4 faculties: Georgian Language and Literature, Physics and Mathematics, History, Natural Sciences and Geography. To this the faculty of Physical Education was added in 1936 and a faculty of Russian Language and Literature ‚Äì in 1938. In 1938 the Institute was named after Shota Rustaveli. The first director of the Teachers‚Äô Institute was Khusein Nakaidze. A significant assistance was rendered to the Institute in providing the scientific personnel by other higher educational institutions of Georgia, first and foremost ‚Äì Tbilisi State University. The following outstanding representatives of the Georgian academia conducted fruitful activities within the walls of the Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University (that time Teachers‚Äô Institute): Giorgi Akhvlediani, Giorgi Tsereteli, Iase Tsintsadze, Sargis Kakabadze, Simon Kaukhchishvili, Giorgi Tavzishvili, Razhden Khutsishvili, Dimitri Gedevanishvili, Giorgi Javakhishvili, Vukol Beridze, Shota Dzidziguri and others. It is owing to them as well that the newly established higher institution soon gained the reputation ‚Äì a system of teaching and research activities was formed and the preparation of local academic staff took its beginnings ‚Äì by 1943 there were 5 candidates of sciences at the Institute already. In July 1935 the preparatory courses were created that particularly fostered the attraction of high school applicants from Adjara highlands. According to the statistics 600 school leavers submitted applications to the Institute in the first year; 219 applicants were admitted to the Institute. In June 1945 a Pedagogical Institute was founded on the basis of Batumi Teachers‚Äô Institute that was followed by reconstruction process and improvement of the facilities and equipment. In 1956 the renovated building entered into exploitation. However, it was not sufficient for the growth of the Institute and in 1977 the construction of a new 5-storeyed building began that was finished in 1982. The collapse of the Soviet Empire and Georgia's fight for independence made it possible to realize the wish of great Ivane Javakhishvili who said: ‚ÄúIf there is to be another university in Georgia, it should be in Batumi.‚Äù By the Decision No.453, 3 September 1990 of the Cabinet of Ministries of Georgia Batumi State University was established on the basis of Batumi Pedagogical Institute. After this transformation apart from special faculty chairs there began functioning 9 university chairs at the higher education institution. The number of specialties increased ‚Äì the faculties of law, economics and medicine were created. As a result of the educational reform in the country the university was transferred to a two-cycle teaching: Bachelor and Master Levels were created. Post-graduate studies also were functioning for certain specialties.

Reasons for the conflict  Mehmed the Conqueror's aggressive military policy in capturing the throne of the Byzantine Empire resulted in the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. Independent Byzantine Greek rulers continued to rule in some areas after this event. One of these domains was the Empire of Trebizond. When Mehmed turned to the East to clean up the remnants of Byzantine rule in 1461, he was faced with the Ak Koyunlu, a tribe that ruled huge lands in the Eastern Anatolia. Their leader, Uzun Hasan, continued the tradition of close relations between the Byzantine throne and his own kingdom so he supported the Empire of Trebizond and sent them military aid but his support wasn't enough to save Trebizond from the Ottoman forces. Mehmed II conquered all of the Eastern Black Sea region. Uzun Hasan decided to seek help from Christian powers because he thought that the Ottomans would return for his own kingdom. Therefore, he decided to sign a treaty with the Republic of Venice, the rival of the Ottoman Empire at that time. In response to Uzun Hasan's treaty with Venice, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror first sent various Janissary contingents, commanded by various figures including Radu cel Frumos, these contingents guarded crucial garrisons and awaited the Ottoman onslaught on the Anatolian opposition. Another reason for tensions between Ak Koyunlu and Ottomans was the political standing of another powerful Anatolian tribe, Karamanids. Kasƒ±m Bey, the ruler of Karamanids, was supporting the growing power of Uzun Hasan. These two powers were working in cooperation against the Ottoman advance in Anatolia. In 1471, a successful Ottoman operation against Karamanids reduced the power of the tribe.  Battle  Mehmed II returned with his army in 1473 to defeat Uzun Hasan. The Turcomans had a traditional army that contained considerable amounts of light cavalry. On the other hand, the Ottoman army was using the latest technology. They came with handguns and cannons. This difference between the natures of the two armies marked the result of the battle. The Ottoman side gained a decisive victory, whereas the Turcoman army was nearly destroyed in a single day.  Aftermath  Ottomans nearly destroyed the power of the Ak Koyunlu in the East. Ak Koyunlu would be destroyed completely by Shah Ismail of Iran in later years. This victory of the Safavid Empire would create a new enemy for the Ottoman Empire in the East. The race between the two empires ended with the fall of the Safavid dynasty from power in the 18th century.

The halt was closed in 1956 as part of an economy campaign. It was also used by special trains for Clayesmore Preparatory School at least until 1961. There were 2 carriages which started from Waterloo attached to one of the regular main line trains and these carriages were un- coupled from the main line train and coupled to a local train to go to Charlton Marshall Halt. There was a train at the beginning and end of each school term. So there were 6 trains that stopped at the halt every year. Trains continued to pass the site until the S&DJR; closed in 1966. Track was finally lifted in 1969, as the railway was still open until the closure of the goods terminal at Blandford that year. The site was in a cutting, which now part of a footpath and bridleway.

It merged on January 1st, 2000 with local police forces under state authority to form the Grand Ducal Police (Luxembourgish: Groussherzoglech Police; French: Police Grand-Ducale). History=Formation The Grand Ducal Gendarmerie was formed on February 3, 1733, \\"to fight the plague of the vagrants and people without consent\\".  French rule and transition  Luxembourg was incorporated into France as the D√©partement des For√™ts from 1795 to 1813 and the \\"Gendarmerie Nationale\\" system was applied. The law of the \\"28 Germinal, Year VI\\", was to remain the basis of the Luxembourgish Gendarmerie. In 1805, the name of the \\"National Gendarmerie\\" was changed to \\"Imperial Gendarmerie\\". Transitionally, after Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig in 1813, Luxembourg became part of the province of Middle-Rhine, administered by Prussia. The Gendarmerie being in complete disarray, the ordinance of 18 February 1814 replaced it with a government militia, with 3 officers and 106 sub-officers and soldiers.  Kingdom of the Netherlands  From 1815 to 1830, Luxembourg was ruled by the King of the Netherlands, as was Belgium. The law of 1814, creating a Corps de Mar√©chauss√©e (Constabulary Corps) in Belgium on the model of the French Gendarmerie, was extended to Luxembourg. After the Belgian Revolution in October 1830, Luxembourg was divided into two parts: the larger part formed the Belgian Province de Luxembourg; the other became the present-day Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, still ruled by the Netherlands. Until 1839, it was controlled by the Dutch Constabulary. Luxembourg was made an independent state (still ruled by the Dutch King in personal union) by the Treaty of London of 19 April, and the creation of a local police force was necessary. The Ordinance of 29 January 1840 created the \\"Grand Duchy Royal Gendarmerie\\". On 1842, it lost its autonomy and was incorporated into the federal contingent (of the German Confederation). Until 1877, the commandant of the Gendarmerie was under the authority of the commander of the contingent.  Independence  The Royal- Grand Ducal decree of 25 August 1863 changed the name into the 'Company of the Grand Duchy Royal Gendarmerie' (), and increased its size to 108 men. In 1877, the Gendarmerie was separated from the contingent. The law of 16 February 1881 created a \\"Force Arm√©e\\", consisting of a company of gendarmes and a company of volunteers, under the command of a major. In 1902, a criminal brigade was created in the Gendarmerie, in order to help the judicial authorities in dealing with crimes and misdemeanours. This brigade was reorganised and reinforced in 1911. By grand-ducal decree of 30 November 1929, it received the name of \\"Service de la S√ªret√© Publique\\".  World War 2 and the Cold War  In 1940, under the German occupation, the Gendarmerie was dissolved and its members were integrated in the services of the polizei deployed into the occupied countries on Eastern Europe. During the Battle of the Bulge, 15 gendarmes assisted American troops with defending the town of Diekirch. The law of 23 July 1952 constituted the legal bases of the modern gendarmerie. It formed a part of the army as well as of the police force. Current The Gendarmerie was merged into the Grand Ducal Police on 1 January 2000. The gendarmerie was placed under the supervision of the Minister for the Police Force (later Minister for the Interior) for all matters related to its organisation, administration, training, and discipline. It fell under the remit of the Minister for Justice for all matters related to the maintenance of law and order and the exercise of the Criminal Investigation Department.

Monument in Fort Mercer, 2008 Fort Mercer was a fort on the Delaware River in New Jersey constructed by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Built by Polish engineer Thaddeus Kosciuszko under the command of George Washington, Fort Mercer was built in 1777 to block the approach to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in concert with Fort Mifflin on the Pennsylvania side. Fort Mercer was located in an area called Red Bank, in what is now the borough of National Park, Gloucester County, New Jersey. The fort was named in honor of Brigadier General Hugh Mercer who had died earlier that year at the Battle of Princeton. The fort's site is now part of Red Bank Battlefield Historical Park, which includes a monument and museum. Several cannons attributed to British warships lost supporting the attack on the fort, and others found buried at the fort itself, are in the park.Fort Mercer at RevolutionaryWarNewJersey.com Fort Mercer was built and Fort Mifflin rebuilt and garrisoned to protect a line of chevaux de frise obstacles across the Delaware River. Fort Billingsport was built downriver to protect another line of these obstacles. Fort Mercer had earthen walls with a surrounding ditch, topped with a log palisade. The fort was about long and wide and mounted 14 cannons, with bastions on the landward corners. A separate outer redoubt was located north of the fort, but this was not garrisoned. The fort could accommodate a garrison of 1,500 men, but only 600 were available, mostly Rhode Island troops of the Continental Army commanded by Colonel Christopher Greene, also a Rhode Islander. French officer Thomas Duplessis made the fort more defensible by the small garrison by having a wall built inside the river side of the fort. On October 22, 1777, in the Battle of Red Bank, an attack by 900 Hessian troops under British Major General William Howe, then occupying Philadelphia, was repelled by Fort Mifflin's defenders with heavy losses on the Hessian side, over 500 casualties including the death of their commander, Colonel Carl Emil Kurt von Donop. The defenders suffered only 40 casualties. Galleys of the Continental and Pennsylvania Navies under Commodore John Hazelwood provided supporting fire.

Two years later, Droemer's son Willy Droemer, became part of the publisher's management and succeeded his father after Adalbert Droemer's death in 1939. In October 1939 Theodor Knaur Nachf. published its Knaurs Welt-Atlas with maps that represented the greater German Reich and the lands recently annexed and conquered by the Nazis. In 1943, the company offices and printing presses were destroyed by Allied bombing. After the end of World War II, Willy Droemer founded the publisher as the new Droemersche Verlagsanstalt, in Schloss Wiesentheid (Unterfranken), which soon after moved to Munich. Starting in 1970, Willy Droemer and Georg von Holtzbrinck worked together and exchanged company shares. In 1980, the publishing group Georg von Holtzbrinck took over the publishing completely and Droemer withdrew from the management. In 1982, the publishing house took over the Kindler Verlag. Since 1999, the Droemer Knaur Publishing group was owned as joint venture half by the Georg von Holtzbrinck publishing group and half by Weltbild. 2013 Holtzbrinck group took ownership completely. In the same year, the Pattloch Publisher was integrated into the Droemer Knaur publishing group. The Pattloch-Verlag was founded in 1946 in Aschaffenburg and was part of Weltbild publishing group since 1987. In the Pattloch publishing, nonfiction books appear from renowned scientists and journalists on social issues. With the authors Manfred L√ºtz and Raphael M. Bonelli began a tradition of psychotherapeutic bestsellers. The Droemer Knaur publishing group was no. 1 among the best-selling publishers in 2005 and 2006, according to the bestseller list of Der Spiegel / book report. Since 2008 Droemer Knaur also publishes e-books. In 2009, the PAN-Verlag was founded, which existed until 2012. In 2010, O. W. Barth Verlag (previously S. Fischer Verlag) was taken over. O.W. Barth was founded in 1924 in Munich and was sold to the Scherz Verlag in Bern in 1973. With this, it was acquired by S. Fischer in 2002. The O.W. Barth Verlag describes itself as a publisher of spiritual literature focusing on Eastern wisdom teachings, holistic healing systems and nonfiction, at the intersection between science and spirituality. Also in 2010, the online platform neobooks.com was founded and in 2011 the Droemer Paperback.

It is a deciduous large shrub growing to 4 m tall, spreading by stoloniferous root sprouts. The leaves are oval, long and broad, cuneate to slightly oblique at the base, acute or rounded at the apex, with a wavy- toothed or shallowly lobed margin, and a short, stout petiole long; they are dark green above, and glaucous beneath, and often persist into the early winter. The flowers are deep to bright red, rarely yellow, with four ribbon- shaped petals long and four short stamens, and grow in clusters; flowering begins in mid winter and continues until early spring (the Latin word means \\"spring-flowering\\"). The fruit is a hard woody capsule long, which splits explosively at the apex at maturity one year after pollination, ejecting the two shiny black seeds up to distant from the parent plant. Although often occurring with the related Hamamelis virginiana, it does not intergrade, and can be distinguished by its flowering in late winter (December to March in its native range), not fall. New foliage, spent flowers Cultivation and uses H. vernalis is valued in cultivation for its strongly scented flowers appearing in late winter, when little else is growing.

After Abaqa's death she became the leader of a Monastery in Constantinople which was popularly named after her as Saint Mary of the Mongols. Her monastic name was Melanie (). Historical context In the 13th century, the Mongol Empire founded by Genghis Khan had expanded to its greatest extent. Hulagu Khan, grandson of Genghis, had swept with his army through Persia and Syria, destroying centuries-old Islamic caliphates, those of the Abbasids and Ayyubids, and led the 1258 Sack of Baghdad, considered to be the single most disastrous event in the history of Islam. However, the Mongol Empire was experiencing internal dissension, and though the center of power was the Great Khan in Karakorum, the Empire had split into four \\"khanates\\", one for each of four of Genghis's grandsons. Hulagu's portion was known as the Ilkhanate and stretched through the area today that covers parts of Turkey and Iran on the west, and Pakistan on the east. The section to the north, covering parts of Russian and Eastern Europe, was known as the Golden Horde. Relations between the khanates were not friendly, and battles erupted between them, even as they both were attempting to further extend the Empire westwards towards Europe, Greece, and the Middle East. Arranged marriage Michael VIII, the Byzantine Emperor based in Constantinople, attempted to stay on friendly relations with both khanates. Hulagu had been negotiating for a lady of the imperial family of Constantinople to be added to his number of wives, and Michael selected his illegitimate daughter Maria.Runciman (1987), p. 320\\"The sustained attacks by the Sultan Baibars (‚Ä¶) rallied the Occidentals to this alliance [with the Mongols], to which the Mongols also convinced the Byzantines to adhere\\", Jean Richard, \\"Histoire des Croisades\\", p. 453 He also betrothed another of his daughters, Maria's sister Euphrosyne Palaiologina, to Nogai Khan, head of the Golden Horde. Both khanates maintained an attitude of tolerance towards the Christians.Van Millingen (1912), p. 272 On her journey to marry Hulagu, Maria left Constantinople in 1265, escorted by the abbot of Pantokrator monastery, Theodosius de Villehardouin.Van Millingen (1912), p. 273 Historian Steven Runciman relates how she was accompanied by the Patriarch Euthymius of Antioch. However, in Caesarea they learned that Hulagu had died, so Maria was instead married to his son, Abaqa Khan. She led a pious life and was quite influential on the politics and the religious outlooks of the Mongols, many of whom were already Nestorian Christians. They had previously looked to Doquz Khatun, Hulagu's wife, as a religious leader. When Doquz also died in 1265, this sentiment turned to Maria, who was called \\"Despina Khatun\\" by the Mongols (ŒîŒ≠œÉœÄŒøŒπŒΩŒ± being Greek for \\"Lady\\").Runciman (1987), p. 332 Widowhood Maria resided in Persia at court of Abaqa for a period of 15 years, until her husband - follower of Tengri - died and was succeeded by his Muslim brother Ahmad.Van Millingen (1912), p. 274 According to Orlean's manuscript, Baidu Khan was close to Maria during her time in Persia and frequently visited her ordo (nomadic palace) to hear interesting stories about Christianity. She eventually returned to Constantinople, but in 1307, during the reign of Andronicus II, she was offered again as bride to a Mongolian prince, Charbanda,Teteriatnikov, Natalia, \\"The Place of the Nun Melania (the Lady of the Mongols) in the Deesis Program of the Inner Narthex of Chora, Constantinople,\\" Cahiers arch√©ologiques 43 (1995), 163‚Äì80 the Mongol ruler of the Middle East in order to obtain an alliance against the rising power of the Ottomans, who at that time were threatening the Byzantine city of Nicaea. Maria went there, both to encourage its defense and to hasten the negotiations with the Mongols about her wedding. She met with the Ottoman Sultan, Othman, but her menacing behaviour aroused the spirit of the Ottomans. Before the 30,000 troops sent to her aid by the Mongols could reach the city, the Ottomans stormed the fortress of Tricocca, which was the key to Nicaea, and conquered it.Van Millingen (1912), p. 275 Maria was then forced to go back to Constantinople once again, where she became the Ktetorissa of the Panagiotissa Monastery, and remained there for the rest of her life. According to some sources, she brought back a daughter of her from Abaqa - Theodora Ara Qutlugh (). Legacy Maria Palaiologina ultimately became the Ktetorissa of the Monastery of the Theotokos Panaghiotissa, later known after her as Panaghia Mouchliotissa (\\"Our All-Holy Lady of the Mongols\\"). The church of the monastery was officially dedicated to the Virgin Mary, but due to Maria's association with it, it became popularly known as the \\"Church of Saint Mary of the Mongols\\".Janin (1953), p. 213\\"Istanbul\\" (2003), p.111 Maria herself was never canonized. The Church is called by the Turks \\"the Church of Blood\\" (Kanli Kilise), as the building saw violent combat during the capture of Constantinople by the Turks.

It first appeared as a serial in the magazine Revue Ind√©pendante between November 1886 and April 1887. It was published in book form on 26 April 1887 by Tresse et Stock. En rade followed Huysmans' most famous novel, A rebours, and was a commercial failure since neither critics nor the public could understand its mixture of brutal realism and fantasy. Later on, the Surrealists were more appreciative and Andr√© Breton included extracts from the novel in his Anthology of Black Humour. Plot Very little happens in this avowedly anti-Romantic work. Jacques Marles seeks refuge from his Parisian creditors with his wife Louise in a dilapidated bungalow in the village of Granard, Ireland. Far from finding contentment in an idyllic summer landscape, the couple discover the countryside is grotesque and diseased. The local tinkers are greedy, cunning and obsessed with money. The novel documents the petty irritations and disappointments of the Marleses' day-to-day existence as well as their struggle with the English language. Interspersed with these realistic descriptions are three dream sequences, recounting Jacques' kinky fantasies in a highly Decadent style influenced by Baudelaire's Les Paradis artificiels and (possibly) the poems of Lautr√©amont.

Kuban Cossack Chorus (, ) is one of the leading Folkloric ensembles in Russia. Its repertoire and performances reflect the songs, dances and folklore of the Kuban Cossacks. History=Early years The modern Kuban Cossack Chorus sets the date of its creation as 14 October 1811, when its predecessor, the Black Sea Host Singing Chorus (–ß–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –í–æ–π—Å–∫–æ–≤—ã–π –ø–µ–≤—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ö–æ—Ä), was formed. The founders of this choir were Kiril Rossinsky and regent Grigory Grechinsky. Over the next hundred years in addition to singing the Russian Orthodox Liturgy in Slavonic, the choir regularly gave public concerts throughout the Krasnodar Krai. These concerts would include classical works as well as folk songs in addition to sacred works. Soviet Union In summer of 1921, under the Decossackization programme of the Bolshevik authorities, the Cossack Host was dissolved, being revived only in 1936. The choir was then headed by Grigory Kontsevich and Yakov Taranko, formally regents of the old Kuban Chorus. A year later, during the Purges, Kontsevich was arrested and then executed. The choir however continued to grow, and in 1939 with the addition of a dance group it was renamed the Ensemble of Kuban Cossack Dance (–ê–Ω—Å–∞–º–±–ª—å –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏ –∏ –ø–ª—è—Å–∫–∏ –∫—É–±–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∫–∞–∑–∞–∫–æ–≤). Such was the professionalisation of this and other such 'folk ensembles' under Stalin's regime that the group in effect consisted of professional musicians and dancers, graduates of Soviet music and dance schools and not necessarily of Cossack descent.Laura J. Olson (2004), p. 162 During the Second World War, the group toured several fronts and performed for Red Army soldiers and particularly the Kuban Cossack regiments that served in the ranks. In 1961, under the initiative of Nikita Khrushchev the ensemble was dissolved once again. In this year many similar folkloric groups were dissolved in the USSR. In 1968, under the leadership of Sergey Chernobay the ensemble was once again re-established as part of the State Russian folk choirs. Three years later the re-established chorus debuted at the Bulgarian international Festival of Folklore, where it earned the first of many titles it would receive in numerous festivals and competitions. Zakharchenko In 1974, the artistic director of the State Kuban Cossack Chorus became Viktor Gavrilovich Zakharchenko, who continues to lead the choir to this day. Zakharchenko was a local transferred back to Kuban from the Siberian Chorus he previously helped direct. Due to his efforts, in 1975 the choir became laureates of the First All Russian screening competition of state folk choirs in Moscow, and again in 1984. In October 1988, by order of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the choir was awarded the Order of Friendship of Peoples, and in 1990 became a laureate of the Taras Shevchenko State Ukrainian Prize in Ukraine. Its highest award was received in 1993 when the choir was awarded the title of \\"Academic\\". =Recent times= During the post-USSR years, the Chorus has channeled its energy into the collection and rebirth of the Cossack traditions, demonstrating pride in Russian patriotism and local customs. In August 1995, Patriarch Alexius II allowed the Host to sing church liturgy once again, and from October 1996, by decree of Krasnodar Krai governor Aleksandr Tkachyov, the choir has been recognised as a direct successor to the old Host choir of 1811. Despite its turbulent past, the Chorus has grown to become one of the leading concert ensembles in Russia. It regularly tours abroad and has appeared in Japan, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Norway, China, Vietnam, Poland, Czechia, Bulgaria, Serbia and Australia.  Centre of Cossack Folklore  In 1990 on the basis of the Kuban Cossack Chorus, a centre of folk culture of Kuban was set up. Its mandate is to collect, study and revive cultural traditions of the Kuban Cossacks. The Centre has children's and teenage choirs and folk-instrument ensembles. It also collects traditional clothing and relics of the past from village life. Programme Cossack songs and dances, mostly in Russian, a few in the Ukrainian language, are a standard part of its programmes. In addition the Chorus transforms poems into songs, such as those of Alexander Pushkin and Taras Shevchenko. It also performs famous non-Cossack songs such as Katyusha.

Training Albert Ferber was a classical pianist and teacher. He was born in Lucerne, and studied in Switzerland, Germany and France where his teachers included Karl Leimer, Walter Gieseking and Marguerite Long. Whilst in Switzerland he often played to Sergei Rachmaninoff although he never regarded the latter as a teacher in the conventional sense. He first came to England in 1937, basing himself in London permanently from 1939 where he undertook further study with James Ching. Conducting and composing Although best known as a concert pianist and recording artist, Ferber had a brief association with the theatre and the cinema, conducting theatre orchestras during the 1940s for productions such as The Beggar's Opera. A little later he appeared as pianist in the Brian Hurst film The Mark of Cain (1947) and composed scores for two films, The Hangman Waits (1947) and Death in the Hand (1948), both directed by the Australian, Albert Barr-Smith. After this, his performing activities prevented any further composition until near the end of his life when he wrote a set of six songs to texts by Paul Verlaine. Teaching Alongside his performing work, Ferber had an active teaching career, gaining early experience in Italy where he deputised for his former teacher Karl Leimer. After settling in England, he was employed as piano teacher (and concert manager) at the James Ching Pianoforte School. Later in life he gave many masterclasses in both the UK and Europe for organisations such as the European Piano Teachers Association (EPTA), but it is as a private teacher that he is probably best remembered. Robert Finley recalls that his teacher was an advocate of the Alexander Technique and that \\"he emphasised relaxation ‚Ä¶ and avoiding the build up of muscular tension and stress\\". Kathron Sturrock commends Ferber's \\"gentle and helpful wisdom\\" which saw her \\"through many a dark moment\\", whilst Penelope Thwaites describes him as an \\"exceptional teacher ‚Ä¶ interested in drawing out the individuality of his pupils; believing in that individuality and conveying confidence: a rare gift\\". She also states that he was \\"much loved by all his pupils\\". Career outline Ferber's performing career developed in England through a series of Wigmore Hall recitals in the late 1940s and early 1950s, many of which were managed by James Ching Ltd. A successful BBC audition in 1945 led to a concerto appearance for the Corporation and then to engagements with Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Josef Krips and the Hall√© Orchestra, and further work with Sir Adrian Boult, Sergiu Celibidache, Jascha Horenstein and Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt. His career took him to most parts of the world, although he had a special affinity with South American countries, which he visited many times. In the UK he made regular recital appearances in London at the Queen Elizabeth and Wigmore Halls and continued to broadcast for the BBC until illness ended his performing career. He died in 1987. Repertoire As soloist with orchestra, Ferber played several concertos by Mozart and Beethoven as well as the first, second and fourth of the Rachmaninoff concertos, the second by Chopin, Mendelssohn and Camille Saint- Sa√´ns, and those by Schumann and Grieg. More unusually, the Concerto for Piano and Strings by Robert Gerhard featured in his repertoire. He also appeared as accompanist to Alexander Kipnis in Schubert's Winterreise (at the age of 18) and as chamber musician, playing with Henryk Szeryng (violin) and Ernesto Xanc√≥ (cello) in duos, and with both artists in trios. Ferber was most active as a solo recitalist, the pianist's repertoire being extensive and wide- ranging. In addition to standard works by J. S. Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Schubert, Ferber played many lesser-known twentieth century works such as the piano sonatas by Ernest Bloch, Frank Bridge and Robert Simpson, and Robert Gerhard's Don Quixote suite. In July 1947 he gave the first performance of Lennox Berkeley's Six Preludes for Piano at Broadcasting House and in May 1951 premiered Gerhard's Three Impromptus at the Wigmore Hall. Even when playing works by mainstream composers, Ferber tended to avoid the obvious and introduced audiences to comparative rarities such as Beethoven's Variations on Salieri's La Stessa, la Stessissima, Chopin's Variations on a German Folksong and Schumann's Sonata No. 3. However, the artist was especially drawn to French repertoire, in particular the music of Gabriel Faur√© and Claude Debussy, whose ≈ìuvre often featured in his concerts. His recital programmes were always imaginative and varied, often structured around collections of shorter items rather than major works, though the latter were included. Recordings Albert Ferber's playing is well represented on disc, one of his earliest LP recordings, of Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words and Schumann's Kinderscenen, appearing in 1951 for Decca. In the same year he made a live recording of Brahms's Variations on a Theme of Haydn for two pianos, partnering Adelina de Lara at her ‚Äòfarewell‚Äô Wigmore Hall concert. Over the next thirty years he recorded, for Saga Records, Faur√©'s piano music (in two volumes), sonatas by Beethoven and Balakirev, along with pieces by Brahms, Chopin, Chopin-Liszt, Debussy, Liszt, Ravel and Smetana. Saga also issued an LP of his recordings of \\"The World's Best Loved Piano Music\\". For Meridian, he recorded music by Chaminade, Debussy, Faur√©, Ibert, Poulenc and Satie; for Rare Recorded Editions, he made an LP of Rachmaninov's Sonata No. 1 and Variations on a Theme of Chopin; and for the Ducretet-Thomson label, he recorded two sets of Beethoven variations and nearly all of Debussy's piano music. His final recording, made in 1981 for Hyperion, was of the Schubert Impromptus D899 and 935. In the last few years, Forgotten Records has reissued some of his Debussy and Beethoven recordings, and all of his Debussy recordings have been reissued by French EMI. Most recently, Ferber's complete Decca recordings from 1945 to 1951 were released on CD. Despite some resurgence of interest in the 21st century, as Robin O‚ÄôConnor formerly of Saga Records observes, the pianist is now almost unknown.4 Style Ferber's performing style was tasteful, intelligent and unpretentious, devoid of self- serving gesture. His recording of the Balakirev sonata, the finale in particular, demonstrates that his playing was sometimes technically fallible, but he could always identify with the style and underlying spirit of a work and, in concert, his performances seemed to convey musical essence rather than pianistic ego. His sound was distinctive: clear in texture and articulation, and of a fragile beauty which some critics felt could become hard under pressure. His strengths were probably most consistently shown to best effect in the music of Faur√© where his tonal shading and undemonstrative interpretation ‚Äì ‚Äòart concealing art‚Äô ‚Äì attracted universal admiration. However, perhaps most impressive amongst his recorded legacy is his LP of the Rachmaninov Sonata No. 1 where everything seems to work for him. All performing elements unite to produce a vivid, sharply-drawn, account of an immediacy more commonly associated with live than with studio playing. The recording can be enjoyed on a moment-by-moment basis but equally appreciated as a deeply satisfying cohesive musical experience.

Decrees have the same legal force as laws, which can only be passed by the Federal Parliament. Even more, unlike other federal states, no hierarchy exists between (federal) laws and (community or regional) decrees, as each entity is supposed to have clearly defined subject-matter jurisdiction. The only difference is in terminology (and naturally in territorial applicability, as decrees are only valid in the jurisdiction of the parliament that passed it). The following five legislative assemblies have the power to pass decrees: * The Flemish Parliament and the Parliament of the French Community, being the parliaments of the two main communities, directly by virtue of Art. 127-129 of the Constitution * the Parliament of the German-speaking Community, directly by virtue of Art. 130 of the Constitution * the regional assemblies referred to in Art. 39 of the Constitution, being de facto the Walloon Parliament only, as the Flemish regional matters are exercised by the Flemish (Community) Parliament, and as Brussels is a separately organised matter (with ordinances instead of decrees). The power to pass decrees for regional assemblies is only indirectly granted by the Special Law on Institutional Reform of 1980, and is referred to as the \\"rules meant in Art. 134\\" in the Constitution. * the Assembly of the French Community Commission, which is informally known as the Brussels Francophone Parliament. Both Communities (Flemish and French) may transfer legislative powers to their Commissions in Brussels, but only the French Community has done this. The Flemish counterpart, the Council of the Flemish Community Commission, does not have the power to pass decrees and remains under full control of the Flemish Parliament. Instead, it legislates by regulation. This power was introduced in the first state reform in 1970, to the then-established Dutch and French cultural councils, the precursors to the present-day parliaments of the two main communities. Unlike laws, decrees are not subject to royal assent. Decrees are not signed and promulgated by the king but instead are promulgated by the executive body, being the community or regional government or, in the case of the Brussels Francophone Parliament, the College of the French Community Commission. Decrees and ordinances are published in the Belgian Official Journal. Unlike ordinances, decrees are not subject to judicial review or to supervision by the federal government. The Constitutional Court is however responsible for supervising the division of power between the federal state, the communities and regions and may annul laws, decrees and ordinances. Variants of decrees: * Special decrees exist equivalent to special laws: such legislation requires a two-thirds majority in parliament and is required for certain matters (mostly relating to education and institutional matters). * Multiple of the above-mentioned entities may adopt a joint decree (nl. gezamenlijk decreet, fr. d√©cret conjoint), which is a decree approved by multiple entities and applying to each of them. This cooperation mechanism is possible per article 92bis/1 of the Special Law on Institutional Reform, introduced in 2014 as part of the sixth state reform.

On 27 December, in an effort to prevent the capture of RAF Kuala Lumpur, the 11th Indian Infantry Division occupied Kampar, which offered a strong natural defensive position. In doing so they were also tasked with delaying the advancing Japanese troops long enough to allow the 9th Indian Infantry Division to withdraw from the east coast. The Japanese intended to capture Kampar as a New Year‚Äôs gift to Emperor Hirohito and on 30 December the Japanese began surrounding the British and Indian positions. The following day fighting commenced. The Allied forces were able to hold on for four days before withdrawing on 2 January 1942, having achieved their objective of slowing the Japanese advance. Background Kinta district. The site overlooking Kampar is set on what is now called Green Ridge. That ridge, together with the nearby Thompson, Kennedy and Cemetery Ridges overlook the main road to the south from Ipoh, Perak, and were of great strategic value. The ridges sit on top of the Gunung Bujang Melaka, a 4,070 foot limestone mountain. This jungle-covered mountain offered a clear view of the surrounding plains covered with open tin mining sites and swamps. The Gunung Bujang Melaka lies to the east of the town of Kampar, its steep slopes leading down to the Kampar Road. With this town and the mountain under control, the Japanese Army would have an excellent view of the Kinta Valley to the south. Allied forces knew that if the 5th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army captured Kampar, they would also be able to use it as a foothold into the Kinta Valley. With the beginning of General Tomoyuki Yamashita's 25th Army invasion of Malaya the III Indian Corps, defending the north of Malaya, was forced into a series of costly retreats southwards. The outcome of these retreats, ordered by Malaya Command, was a badly mauled and decimated British infantry. The losses suffered by the 11th Indian Division in the battles at Jitra, Kroh, Alor Star and Gurun meant that the division's British and Indian battalions had mostly been amalgamated. After the loss of Kedah province the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade (Malaya Command reserve force and well trained in jungle warfare) replaced the 11th Division and commenced a very successful fighting withdrawal to the Kampar position, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese spearhead units. The 12th Brigade's job was to buy time for the re-organisation of the 11th Division and the preparation of defences at Kampar. British positions Of the three brigades from the 11th Indian Division, two‚Äîthe 6th and 15th Indian Infantry Brigades‚Äîhad been amalgamated to form the 15th/6th Brigade under Brigadier Henry Moorhead (commander of Krohcol). The 15th/6th Brigade now consisted of the survivors from the 1st Leicestershire Regiment and 2nd East Surreys (which had been amalgamated to form the British Battalion), and a composite Jat-Punjab Regiment (formed from survivors of the 1/8th Punjab Regiment and the 2/9th Jat Regiment). The remaining regiments of the brigade‚Äî1/14th Punjab, 5/14th Punjab and 2/16th Punjab Regiments‚Äîcovered the rear of the Kampar position. With all of those regiments in one formation the 15th/6th Brigade still only numbered about 1,600 men. The 28th Gurkha Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Ray Selby, though intact, was low in strength and morale; its three Gurkha battalions had suffered heavy casualties in the fighting around Jitra, Kroh, Gurun and at Ipoh. Major General Archie Paris (temporary commander of the 11th Division) had to defend a line from the coast through Telok Anson (now Telok Intan) up to the defensive positions at Kampar. The defensive perimeter at Kampar was an all round position, straddling Kampar Hill (Gunong Brijang Malaka) to the east of Kampar town, overlooking the Japanese advance and well concealed by thick jungle. Paris placed artillery spotters on the forward slopes protected by the 15th/6th Brigade on the western side of the position, and the 28th Gurkha Brigade covered the right flank on the eastern side. The two brigades were supported by the 88th Field Artillery Regiment, which was equipped with 25 pounders, and the 4.5 inch howitzers of the 155th Field Artillery Regiment. Once the 12th Brigade had passed through Kampar Paris sent them to cover the coast and his line of retreat at Telok Anson. Japanese positions The Japanese attacking force came from Lieutenant General Takuro Matsui's Japanese 5th Division. The intact and relatively fresh 41st Infantry Regiment (about 4,000 strong) from Major General Saburo Kawamura's 9th Brigade spearheaded the attack on Kampar Hill. Kawamura's brigade consisted of Colonel Watanabe's 11th Regiment and Colonel Kanichi Okabe's 41st Regiment.Thompson pg. 155 and 187 Battle=Kampar Type 97 Te-Ke tanks followed by their bicycle infantry advancing during the battle, December 1941.

Once the well concealed Gurkhas' positions were found the Japanese formed up to attack and the howitzers of the 155th (Lanarkshire Yeomanry) Field Artillery opened up a concentrated fire on the Japanese troops. All through 31 December the 11th Regiment attacks were beaten off by the Gurkhas and the close support artillery fire. On midnight of New Year's Eve the commander of the 155th Field Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Augustus Murdoch, \\"ordered a twelve gun salute to be fired at the Japanese\\".Smith pg. 304‚Äì305 At seven in the morning, on 1 January 1942, Kawamura launched his main attack against the western side of the Kampar position. This attack was carried out by the 41st Regiment and the brunt of it was against the area held by Lieutenant Colonel Esmond Morrison's British Battalion. The 41st Regiment attacked straight into the British Battalion's positions, supported by heavy mortar fire. The fighting became fierce with Japanese and British positions taken and retaken at the point of a bayonet. Japanese casualties were heavy with a continuous stream of wounded passing Colonel Okabe's headquarters. Combined with the infantry assaults the Japanese poured continuous artillery fire and bombed and strafed the British positions with impunity (the Japanese had nearly complete air superiority by this stage in the campaign). Matsui brought in fresh soldiers to replace his mounting casualties. The well concealed and dug in 15th/6th Brigade, supported by the 88th (2nd West Lancashire) Field Artillery, held on to their positions throughout the two days of fierce fighting on the western slopes of Kampar Hill without relief. The ferocity and confusion of the close-quarter fighting around the British Battalion was especially violent in the forward positions. Lieutenant Edgar Newland, commanding a platoon of 30 Leicesters, held the most forward position of the battalion. His platoon was surrounded and cut off for most of the battle but Newland and his men fought off all attacks and kept hold of their isolated position throughout the two days. For his actions Newland later received the Military Cross. During the two-day battle Japanese troops managed to capture trenches on the eastern sector of Thompson Ridge. After two counter-attacks by D Company of the British Battalion and a third by the Jat-Punjab Battalion failed, a reserve mixed company of 60 Sikhs and Gujars from the Jat-Punjab Battalion was brought in to attempt to retake the trenches. This half company under the command of Captain John Onslow Graham and Lieutenant Charles Douglas Lamb (both officers were from 1/8th Punjab) fixed bayonets and charged the Japanese position. The Japanese fire was so heavy that 33 men, including Lamb, were killed in the charge. Graham continued to lead the attack after being wounded and only stopped when a grenade mangled both his legs beneath the knees. Nevertheless, he continued to shout encouragement to his men and was seen throwing grenades at the Japanese trenches. Altogether 34 Indians died in the attack but they retook the position. Graham died of his wounds a day later and was subsequently Mentioned in Dispatches for his actions on Thompson Ridge. Telok Anson Matsui realised that the British position at Kampar was too strong for him to take, so General Yamashita ordered landings on the west coast south of Kampar near the 12th Brigade positions at Telok Anson in order to out flank and cut off the line of retreat of the 11th Division. The 11th Infantry Regiment were to land at Hutan Melintang and attack Telok Anson from the south and a force from the Imperial Guards Division headed overland, following the Perak River to attack Telok Anson from the north.Thompson pg. 187 The landings were successful and Telok Anson was taken after a brisk battle with the 3rd Cavalry and 1st Independent Company on 2 January 1942. Once Telok Anson had fallen the 3rd Cavalry and 1st Independent Company fell back to the 12th Brigade which successfully delayed the Japanese from taking the main north‚Äìsouth road. Major-General Paris, with his line of retreat threatened, ordered the positions at Kampar to be abandoned. The 12th Brigade covered the retreat of 11th Division and the British pulled back to the next prepared defensive position at Slim River. Aftermath Over the four-day period, between 30 December 1941 and 2 January 1942, the 11th Division managed to fight off determined Japanese attacks and inflicted heavy casualties upon them. Such were the Japanese losses that the 41st Infantry Regiment was unable to participate in the later invasion of Singapore. Japanese newspapers at the time claimed 500 Japanese casualties against an Allied loss of 150, but there was no official release of actual Japanese casualties. It was the first serious defeat the Japanese had experienced in the Malayan campaign. Even though the battle was a success for the Allies, the lack of reserves in Malaya Command to support the 11th Division forced the division's withdrawal towards the Slim River.Thompson pg. 187‚Äì188Owen pg. 94‚Äì95 See also *Malaya Command *Japanese Order of Battle, Malayan Campaign NotesReferences  * Further reading * External links *The Battles of Kampar by Chye Kooi Loong *Remembering the Battle of Kampar : The Forgotten Heroes of The British Battalion.

The first name of his nom de plume is taken from the ancient Greek god Hermes. The last name means \\"fat mountain\\", but is written as Phettberg instead of Fettberg as an ironic hint to his Greek-sounding first name.  Early life and career  Phettberg grew up in the village of Unternalb near Retz in a family of winegrowers. Following a brief stint as a bank clerk and continued education, he became assistant vicar with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna. In the mid-1980s, he was co-founder of the groups Libertine Sadomasochismusinitiative Wien and of project Polymorph Perverse Klinik Wien.  1990s  Beginning in 1991, he participated in productions of the theatre group Sparverein Die Unz-Ertrennlichen. In 1992, Phettberg began writing the column \\"Phettbergs Predigtdienst\\" (Phettberg's sermon) for the weekly Vienna magazine Falter. The column is written in the form of a sermon, building upon the scripture passages for each respective Sunday in the Catholic liturgical year. After a health-related hiatus (see below), he resumed writing in early 2007. From November 12, 1994 and throughout 1995, he was the host of the ORF talk show Phettbergs Nette Leit Show, which featured interviews with primarily Viennese celebrities, scientists, and people from exotic occupation groups. The opening question for the guests, \\"Frucade oder Eierlik√∂r?\\" (Frucade or eggnog) became well-known and was also used as the title of a book featuring excerpts from interviews during the show's run. When ORF broadcast 19 episodes of the show from June 1995 to April 1996, Phettberg quickly gained fame with a larger audience in Austria as well as Germany and Switzerland, owing to his unconventional questions and the relentless presentation of his own problems, sexual phantasies, and celebration of gaps in his general education. A draft r√©sum√© from 1999 translates as: \\"Am pornographer, columnist and wreck. Would like to talk.\\"Draft resum√© from the official homepage  2000s  In 2000, Phettberg pioneered internet broadcasting with a weekly show, in which he delivered his Phettberg's sermon column while being bonded and whipped. In March 2001, together with Thomas Holzinger, he produced a full week, or 168 hours of continuous live internet broadcast, during which Phettberg was guarded in the prison of the so-called Arche Phettberg (also the title of the show) by half-naked young men in blue jeans. Also in 2001, he appeared as himself in the TV documentary Gipfeltreffen - Hermes Phettberg trifft Helge Schneider by Roger Willemsen. In 2003 and 2004, Austrian terrestrial TV station ATVplus featured him in a show called Beichtphater Phettberg, produced and directed by his recurring team of artist companions: Thomas Holzinger, Mandy E. Mante and Paul Poet. Since then, Phettberg has participated in a variety of artistic and public sexual performances, as well as in numerous talk shows. He is also presently a proponent for the foundation of a \\"University of Pornography and Prostitution\\". Kurt Palm did a documentary about and with Phettberg in 2007, \\"Hermes Phettberg - Elender\\" (Hermes Phettberg - Miserable). The documentary revolves around Phettbergs stroke as well about Phettbergs childhood and early life, trying to explain his interest in sadomasochism and his chronic depression.  Health issues  On October 23, 2006, Phettberg suffered a stroke, followed by another shortly after. His condition and the subsequent long therapy and rehabilitation phase forced him into a work hiatus. During rehab, he lost 70 kilograms in weight.  Phettberg in fiction  In 1995, Fritz Ostermayer and Hermes Phettberg together wrote and published Hermes Phettberg r√§umt seine Wohnung zamm (\\"Hermes Phettberg tidies up his apartment\\"). In 1999, Austrian author Franzobel published a play named Phettberg: Eine Hermes-trag√∂die which premiered at the Vienna Volkstheater. The play is loosely centered on an exaggerated version of Hermes Phettberg's life and character.

On Duncan's right stands his grandson Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll and on his left is his son Colin of Glenorchy. (Description after Boardman, The Campbells.) Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell (Classical Gaelic Donnchadh mac Cailein, and also called Donnchadh na-Adh () of Loch Awe, (died 1453), was a Scottish nobleman and politician. He was an important figure in Scottish affairs in the first half of the 15th century and Justiciar of Argyll. He was head of the Clan Campbell for 40 years. Family Duncan's date of birth is in 1390 in Lochow, Argyll. He was the son of Colin Campbell of LochaweBalfour Paul, Sir James, The Scots' Peerage, Edinburgh, 1904, vol.1, p.328-330., and Mariota Campbell. Colin (called Colin Iongantach 'Wonderful', and 'Colin The Good Knight') was the eldest son of Archibald Campbell of Lochawe, while Mariota was the daughter of John Campbell, and thus heiress to the lands of Ardscotnish and Glen Orchy. Colin obtained a dispensation by 13 January 1366 permitting the marriage of Mariota to his son John. He evidently changed his plans and married Mariota himself as in 1372 he obtained a second dispensation, this allowing Colin and Mariota to remarry, after a separation, having already married although within the prohibited degree of kinship.Boardman, The Campbells, pp. 72-72, 102 & 104; Paul, The Scots Peerage, Vol I, p. 330. Duncan may not have been their eldest son: a brother named John Annam, John the Weak, is said to have been passed over. Duncan was seemingly the chosen heir by 6 February 1393 when he was granted the lands of Menstrie by his father. On Colin's death, some time before 19 January 1414, Duncan became head of the Campbells of Loch Awe.Boardman, The Campbells, pp. 104 & 109-110. Family ties Duncan was twice married, first to Marjorie (d. before August 1432), daughter of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, secondly to Margaret Stewart of Ardgowan (d. after August 1442). Duncan's closeness to the Albany Stewarts led to King James I of Scotland viewing him with some suspicion, and James sent Duncan south as a hostage in England. The documentary record calls him Campbell of Argyll, and gives his share of the liability for the king's ransom as 1500 merks, more than any other hostage save one.Boardman, The Campbells, p. 291. William Douglas, heir of the Lord of Dalkeith, was also assessed as liable for 1500 merks. See also Paul, The Scots Peerage, vol. I, p. 330, where the amount is described as Duncan's income. The value of 1500 Scots merks in English Pounds sterling, in then-current gold coin was some 750 English merks or 500 pounds sterling. The Scots demy (108 pence Scots money) was considered to be of equal value to the English half-noble (54 pence English money); Grueber, Handbook, p. 171. In time Duncan and the king were somewhat reconciled and following James's assassination Duncan was among the supporters of Queen Dowager Joan. \\"The fortunate\\" During the minority of King James II, Duncan professed support and loyalty to the regency, while constantly expanding his power in Argyll, often at the expense of the Crown. He was nevertheless knighted before March 1440 and created a Lord of Parliament as Lord Campbell of Lochawe by James II in 1445. Death He died between February 1453 and 21 May 1454, and was buried in the collegiate church at Kilmun, which he and his wife Margaret Stewart had founded in 1442 (see Kilmun Church). Their effigies can still be seen in a niche with a wide cusped arch. His first successor was Archibald, Master of Campbell; also known as Archibald Roy of Kilbride since he was born in Kilbride, two miles from Inverary. Archibald Roy of Kilbride was the 14th Campbell, the Sixth McCailen More, and 16th Knight of Lochow.The House of Argyll and the Collateral Branches of the Clan Campbell. p. 32. His second son by his wife Margaret, Colin, was the founder of the Campbell of Breadalbane line (Earl of Breadalbane and Holland). His other sons by his second marriage, Archibald, Duncan, and Neil, created the Campbell septs of Otter, Auchinbreck, and Ormidale, respectively. His grandson Colin, son of Archibald 'Gillespic,' (d. 1440) his only child by his first wife, succeeded him as Chief of the Clan Campbell.

Created by Ann Marcus and Norma Monty, the role was originally portrayed by Jason Culp from 1988 to 1990. William deVry took over the role upon the character's re-introduction in 2013. Creation=Background Julian Jerome is the youngest son of crime lord Victor Jerome (Jack Axelrod), born in 1959. Unlike his older brothers, Victor favors Julian and protects him from the mob life. While in graduate school, Julian has a three-year romance with Cheryl Stansbury (Jennifer Anglin) and they fall in love. According to his sister, Olivia (Tonja Walker), Julian even plans to marry Cheryl. However, Julian is forced to break off the relationship as Victor refuses to involve Cheryl in the family business. Casting The role was originated by Jason Culp on February 24, 1988. Culp made his final appearance on March 16, 1990. On July 8, 2013, TV Source Magazine announced exclusively that Wiliam deVry, previously known for his role as Storm Logan on The Bold and the Beautiful and his Emmy-nominated role as Michael Cambias on All My Children, had joined the cast of General Hospital in an undisclosed contract role. deVry filmed his first scenes on July 9, reportedly with Maura West, who had recently joined the cast as Ava Jerome. deVry later took to Facebook to confirm the news and revealed his first air date to be July 30. deVry also appeared briefly on the General Hospital spin-off, Port Charles. deVry said that when he originally auditioned for the role, he wanted to make sure the series was not using the open casting call in an attempt to cast someone else. No decision had been made and they were still testing candidates for the role. Three weeks after his first audition, deVry had a screen test. The character and casting was very much a mystery. deVry revealed that he and the others who auditioned for role were only given a vague character breakdown. However, the lack of information provided for the character only piqued his interest. deVry also revealed that he was hesitant to take the role due to his history with All My Children and the sudden change in direction for the character of Michael Cambias with the installation of new producers. deVry was offered a screen test immediately after his audition. deVry screen tested with Maurice Benard, who portrayed Sonny Corinthos. A few days later, deVry booked the role and was offered a four-year contract with the series. deVry filmed his first official scenes with Sullivan, and also confirmed that he had indeed worked with West. Development TV Source confirmed the character's name as Derek Wells, the boss of fashion editor Connie Falconeri, portrayed by the departing Kelly Sullivan. Derek comes to town with an \\"agenda\\", said deVry. However, deVry claimed that he had not filmed with West. deVry described Derek as a \\"really strong character.\\" Soaps In Depth speculated that deVry's Derek would factor into many more storyline. deVry later confirmed those speculations. Soaps In Depth described Derek as a \\"media mogul\\" who would cause trouble for several other characters, including Sullivan's Connie and by extension Benard's Sonny. Derek is introduced as the new owner of Connie's fashion magazine, Crimson, and its parent publication, the tabloid recently abandoned by Todd Manning (Roger Howarth). deVry said that anyone who comes in contact with Derek should watch their backs. Soaps In Depth speculated that Derek would factor into Connie's departure from the canvas. Michael Fairman speculated that Derek Wells was just a code name and that Derek Wells was somehow connected to the infamous Jerome crime family. Ron Carlivati previewed the month of August and hinted that Derek Wells shared a connection to Ava and the original Jerome family. According to Carlivati, deVry's introduction opens the door for a new and bigger story. deVry admitted that the decision to make his character Julian Jerome was very last minute and he was only made aware of the potential decision a few days before taped his first scenes. Upon's deVry's introduction as Julian, it is revealed that he and sister Ava were behind the gambling ring that afforded them the opportunity to infiltrate the Corinthos crime organization. Storylines=1988‚Äì1990 Julian agrees to help Duke Lavery (Ian Buchanan) find his kidnapped wife, Anna (Finola Hughes), much to his father's chagrin. However, Julian is thinking of the bigger picture and tries to convince Victor to use Duke to legitimize their criminal organization. Julian's attempt to help Duke ends in tragedy when he is shot and wounded in a shootout with a rival mob boss in March 1988. On his death bed, Julian makes Duke promise to help Victor legitimize the mob. Julian's death bed guilt trip put a kink in Duke's plans to cut ties from the mob completely which Julian had previously warned Duke against. At Julian's memorial service, Olivia announces that she and Duke will be controlling the organization. Meanwhile, Julian's former love Cheryl resurfaces and does her best to hide her relationship with Julian from her current boyfriend, police commissioner, Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers). Unbeknownst to most, Olivia had put a hit out on her brother, hoping to take over their father's business. Cheryl discovers that Julian actually alive. He convinces her to keep quiet. However, Julian blows his own cover to confront his sister about her involvement in his shooting. Olivia claims the bullet was meant for Duke. When Julian refuses to go along with Olivia's plans to merge the Jerome and Carter families, Olivia has her henchman, Dino (Chris DeRose), kidnap Cheryl. When a hysterical Cheryl shoots at Olivia and leaves her in a coma, Julian covers it up, framing Anna. Julian still protects Cheryl when he is implicated in Olivia's attempted murder after her earring, which he gave to her as a gift, is discovered at the crime scene. However, Olivia, who hated Anna, helps keep up the story and claims Anna as the shooter. Duke threatens Julian when it is revealed that he, Olivia and Robert have been covering for Cheryl and framing Anna. Julian helps care for Cheryl when she gets shot, which immediately causes trouble for Cheryl and Robert. Anna and Cheryl are cleared when it is revealed that Dino, Victor's illegitimate son, had shot Olivia, hoping to claim the Jerome empire for himself. When Duke and Anna successfully send Olivia to a mental hospital and Victor ends up dead, Julian swears revenge for Duke's betrayal. With the family weakened by Victor's death, Julian heads up the organization, and makes it his business to neutralize Olivia, who has escaped from the mental hospital. He puts a hit out on Duke, who has gotten plastic surgery and is going by the name Jonathan Paget (Greg Beecroft), and plans to frame Olivia for the crime. However, Julian ends up killing Olivia when he learns that she told Anna about Paget's true identity. In March 1990, the bitter rivalry comes to an end when Julian and Duke are both killed after a struggle over a gun. It is later revealed that Cheryl gave birth to Julian's son, and Victor arranged for Cheryl to think the child was stillborn. The child, Lucas is eventually adopted by Dr. Tony Jones (Brad Maule) and his wife, Bobbie (Jacklyn Zeman), after Cheryl's death in 1992. 2013‚Äì2015 Media mogul Derek Wells arrives as the new owner of Crimson magazine and The Port Charles Press. \\"Derek\\" is later revealed to be Julian, working with sister Ava (Maura West) to reclaim the Port Charles mob territory from Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard), the current mob boss. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) requests Derek's help to find a bone marrow for her ailing son, Danny, but when he bumps the story, he agrees to get tested to make up for it. When Derek proves to be a match, and learns how Sam was conceived from her mother, Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn), he realizes he is Sam's father. Though Ava tells him to keep quiet, he's torn over wanting a family. Sonny discovers that Julian had survived the shooting and that the WSB and then Police Commissioner Robert Scorpio had arranged for him to receive a new face and identity in exchange for his testimony against the mob. Sonny exposes Julian's identity, and threatens his life. However, Julian uses Danny as leverage, saying that if he relapses, Julian will need to be alive to donate bone marrow. Sam begs Julian to bank his bone marrow to prove he cares about his family more than the business. Julian refuses, upsetting Sam, who pushes him away. Julian tries to reach out to Sam, as well as Alexis, who he's falling for. Ava and Julian start to grow distant, especially after Ava starts having an affair with Sonny's son, Morgan (Bryan Craig). She gives information to Sonny on Julian's business to hang onto Morgan, and Sonny finds out that Julian has a silent boss who has been bankrolling him for years. This boss is revealed to be Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary), who shows a ruthless side to handling the business. After Sonny goes to prison, he hands over his business to Duke, who also survived the shootout, to keep Julian from taking over. Julian sends his hitman, Carlos Rivera (Jeffrey Vincent Parise), after Duke, and the botched hit leaves Duke dead. Anna is devastated, and vows to make Julian pay. Julian meets Lucas (Ryan Carnes), now an adult and a doctor, but has trouble connecting with him after Lucas reveals that he's gay. Wanting to connect with his family and Alexis, Julian decides to leave the mob. Luke, though, refuses to let him, and threatens his family to make sure he doesn't leave. Needing help, Julian confesses to a crime, and gets sent to Pentonville, where Sonny is locked up on a murder charge. The two team up to try and stop Luke. They're able to break out with Ava, and thwart Luke. Julian saves Lucas before being caught. Alexis helps get Julian acquitted, and he's released from prison. Alexis starts dating Julian, and he's able to reconnect with his children, as well. Olivia Falconeri (Lisa LoCicero) becomes pregnant with Julian's child after a one-night-stand, but she claims that Ned Ashton (Wally Kurth) is the father. Right before she goes into labor, though, Julian finds out that he's the father. Olivia gives birth to a baby boy, but Julian is led to believe the baby died. Olivia left town, and returned with an infant she claimed to have adopted. Julian later found out that the baby boy with Olivia was actually their son, Leo, and went to confront Olivia. Alexis came, and stopped Julian from starting a fight with Olivia, helping him calm down. He and Olivia sat down to talk, and eventually agreed to a shared custody arrangement. 2016‚Äîpresent Julian proposed to Alexis, and they got engaged. During their wedding, the entire congregation was taken hostage by Landon Dixon (Troy Ruptash), who was after Ava for calling the cops on his weapons shipment. Sonny was able to subdue Landon, and he was arrested. Julian found out that Ava was being threatened by their organization after talking to the cops, and tried to find a way to protect her. He ended up re-entering the mob. Soon after, Carlos is arrested for murdering Duke, and tells Julian to help him get released. Julian asks Alexis to be Carlos' attorney, despite the fact that it's a conflict of interest. Alexis agrees, but Carlos escapes custody. He asks Julian to help him leave town, but Julian instead stabs Carlos, killing him. Alexis quickly realizes Julian was responsible for the murder, and he tries to cover up the evidence so Alexis can't turn him in. Alexis, though, tells Julian she's done with him, and files for divorce. Julian refuses to grant the divorce, saying he'll fight to regain Alexis' trust. However, Alexis is arrested for Carlos' murder soon after, and tells Julian to come forward so she is not charged with murder. Julian refuses, saying Alexis should go to trial and get acquitted. Alexis instead wears a wire, and gets Julian to confess to both Duke and Carlos' murder. Julian finds the wire, and kidnaps Alexis, bringing her to the pier and nearly killing her. He's stopped by Sonny, and while the two are fighting, Alexis stabs Julian, saving herself and Sonny. Julian is arrested, and his children disown him. However, he is acquitted at the trial, thanks to his lawyer, Scott Baldwin (Kin Shriner), and Ava. Despite getting acquitted, Julian's children and Alexis still turn their backs on him. Soon after, Julian's car is bombed, and ends up killing Morgan, who had stolen it while drunk. Believing Sonny is responsible, Julian hires investigator Curtis Ashford (Donnell Turner) to prove Sonny's guilt. However, when Curtis finds out someone else is responsible, Julian fires him. He later takes a call from \\"Oscar Jessup,\\" the man Curtis said was linked to the bombing. Julian realized that Alexis had become an alcoholic after losing her law license for defending Carlos. Trying to get her to sober up, Julian tries to get her help, but no one believes him. Julian decides to intervene himself, but ends up severely injured when Alexis runs him over while driving drunk. He blackmails her into taking care of him so he won't tell the police. Alexis eventually sobers up when Julian forces her to, and he decides not to press charges against Alexis. Sam was investigating the bombing along with her husband, Jason Morgan (Billy Miller), and Julian was ordered to kill Jason by Jessup's men. Julian refused, and tried to come clean to Sam, until he found out Leo was hospitalized. He went to confront \\"Jessup,\\" who was actually his sister, Olivia. She had taken over after Julian left, and coerced him into joining the mob by threatening Julian's family. Olivia is also responsible for killing Morgan. She wanted revenge on Julian for ruining her life, and killing Duke. Julian was desperate to get rid of his sister, and tried to kill Olivia. She caught on and kidnapped a pregnant Sam in retaliation. Julian left a letter for Alexis to find in case something happened to him. Olivia found out, and kidnapped Julian to cover her own tracks. Julian was rescued, and was questioned by the police about his sister's plans. Alexis found out about Olivia, and yelled at Julian for not telling her or anyone else about his sister. Olivia kidnapped Alexis, and forced to Julian to shoot Alexis or she would kill him. Julian helped Alexis get free, and struggled with Olivia, falling off a bridge after a gunshot was fired. Julian was presumed dead, and Alexis learned that Olivia threatened to kill his children unless he killed Alexis, and he tried to thwart her, but he was unable to. In May 2020, he married Nelle Benson (Chloe Lanier) after being blackmailed by her.

But in 1851, when the assembly finally met, the political tide had turned and conservative forces had regained strength. The Danes presented a bill to the assembly which would have made the Danish Constitution of 1849 valid in Iceland with an exception concerning the legislative power. Iceland was to get six seats in the Danish Parliament. The delegates prepared an alternative bill, proposing a constitution for a practically independent Iceland in personal union with the Danish king. Seeing that the delegates would never agree to the Danish bill and believing them to have no authority to discuss the alternative bill, Governor Trampe decided to dissolve the Assembly.

Philip Street in the Society Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was owned by the Cassey family for 84 years (1845‚Äì1929). The Casseys were a prominent, prosperous, African-American family known for their activism in working for the abolition of slavery and against colonization - the repatriation of free blacks to Africa - and their support for educational, intellectual, and benevolent organizations. Joseph Cassey Joseph Cassey (1789‚Äì1848) arrived in Philadelphia from the French West Indies some time before 1808. He prospered in the barber trade and as a perfumer, wig-maker, and money-lender. An 1823 engraved ad for Joseph Cassey's barber shop at 36 South 4th Street states, \\"Keeps a general assortment of perfumery, scented soaps, shaving apparatus, ladies work and dressing boxes, fine cutlery, fancy hair, pommade, ‚Äúhuil antique‚Äù, combs, &c.;\\" Joseph Cassey's Barber Shop ad, 1832 Cassey bought and sold real estate, often with his sometime business partner, Robert Purvis, another African-American of note in Philadelphia. Among the properties that Cassey amassed were several in the neighborhood of his home near Society Hill, the back of the property at 243 Delancey Street, and a farm shared by Cassey and Purvis in Bucks County known to have been visited by Lucretia Mott where, she wrote, she was entertained handsomely. Cassey also owned property in Burlington County, New Jersey. He was a landlord, at one point collecting rents from families totaling no less than 27 people living at 243 Delancey Street. The 1820s and 1830s were the highest public profile years for Joseph Cassey in community service. He served as Treasurer to the Haytien Emigration Society of Philadelphia in 1824, a group recruiting free people of color to emigrate to Haiti. Supporting education was a strong priority with Cassey. In 1818, he served as an officer at the Pennsylvania Augustine Society which networked him with some of the strongest supporters on Haitian resettlement. One of those supporters was Francis Webb, Secretary to the Haytien Emigration Society and Philadelphia distributor for Freedom's Journal from 1827-1829. After Webb's death in 1829, the Casseys remained close to Webb's children, including youngest son and future author, Frank J. Webb. The ill-fated \\"Canterbury Affair\\" of the 1830s saw Cassey supporting the transition of the Canterbury Female Boarding School for local white children in Canterbury, Connecticut, to a high school for \\"young Ladies and little Misses of color‚Äù, as advertised in the Liberator. The local townspeople rose up against the schoolteacher and threw her in jail, closing down the school permanently. Laws were enacted preventing students of color from outside the state to be educated in Connecticut. Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident. In the early 1830s, Joseph Cassey also funded the efforts to start a manual labor college in New Haven, Connecticut, home of Yale University, which met with resistance from the local townspeople, to the extent that they would ‚Äúresist the establishment of the proposed College‚Ä¶by every lawful means‚Äù. In 1839, Cassey joined with colleagues, sailmaker James Forten and lumber merchant Stephen Smith, to establish a ten-year scholarship for poor but deserving black students at the Oneida Institute in upstate New York which had a race-blind admissions policy. Joseph Cassey was a noted abolitionist, anti-colonizationist, and intellectual activist. Introduced to William Lloyd Garrison by James Forten, Cassey became the first agent in Philadelphia of The Liberator, an early abolitionist newspaper from 1831 published in Boston by Garrison. Cassey actively funded and distributed the newspaper in Philadelphia. He was appointed Vice President of the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1833. He was on the Board of the American Anti-Slavery Society from 1834 through 1836 and Treasurer of the American Moral Reform Society from 1835‚Äì1841. He and wife Amy were founding members of the Gilbert Lyceum (1841) for scientific and literary interests, the first of its kind established by African-Americans and which included both genders. The Lyceum organized lectures on ‚ÄúPhysiology, Anatomy, Chemistry & Natural Philosophy‚Äù. Involved in the church, Cassey was a member at St. Thomas‚Äô Church on 5th Street, active as an officer in the Sons of St. Thomas benevolent society and in the nondenominational Benezet Philanthropic Society. By 1840 he had amassed an estimated net worth of $75,000, mostly in real estate. He claimed only $2,000 in net worth to the census takers in 1847, excluding his real estate holdings. He retired and moved from his residence over his barber shop at 36 South Fourth Street to more elegant accommodations at 113 Lombard Street, not far from his friend James Forten who was living at 92 Lombard Street (these addresses are from the former street numbering system). Cassey was one of the few men of color to retire to the status of ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù. Upon his death in 1848, his will divided his estate between his wife, Amy, and six surviving children (5 sons, 1 daughter); Francis L., Joseph C., Alfred S., Peter William, Sarah, and Henry. Amy Cassey Born in New York City in 1809 to Sarah and Rev. Peter H. Williams Jr., a leading Episcopalian minister, Amy Matilda Williams married Philadelphia businessman Joseph Cassey, a gentleman twenty years her senior in 1826. At the time she was only 17 years old. She was an early and active participant in the Antislavery Conventions of American Women (1837). As the household always employed at least one servant, Amy was free to devote considerable attention to the anti-slavery effort, including being active in the interracial Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society. Amy‚Äôs personal album resides in the collection at the Library Company of Philadelphia and contains original drawings and writings by Frederick Douglass, Lucy Stone, William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Sarah Mapps Douglass, and members of James Forten‚Äôs family, to name a few. Six of her eight children survived infancy. In 1846 Amy adopted Annie Wood, the fifteen- year-old aunt of nine-year-old Charlotte Forten Grimke. When Joseph Cassey died in 1848, Amy remarried two years later to Charles Lenox Remond and moved to Salem, Massachusetts, where she continued her work in abolition and civil rights. Both Annie Wood and Charlotte Forten lived with the Remonds while attending school in Salem; they regarded Amy's daughter, Sarah Cassey, as their sister. The days and hours leading to Amy's death in 1856 are captured in the diary of young Charlotte Forten.Brenda Stevenson, The Journals of Charlotte Forten, New York: 1988 In 1861, Sarah Cassey married Detroit and Chatham doctor, Samuel C. Watson. She would die in 1875.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p860-865 Offspring of Joseph and Amy Cassey=Rev. Peter William Cassey Son Rev. Peter William Cassey was a barber, dentist, and bleeder in Philadelphia, later moving to California in 1853. Initially a successful barber with a shaving saloon in the basement of the Union Hotel, 642 Merchant Street, San Francisco, he relocated to San Jose in 1860, where he founded the Phoenixonian (1861), the first secondary school in California for Black students, and the \\"Christ Episcopal Church for Black people\\". Peter and wife Anna taught at the Institute. Peter organized the Convention for Colored Citizens of California in Sacramento in 1865. In 1881, Rev. Cassey left San Jose to become the first black priest at St. Cyprian's Church in New Bern, North Carolina. Alfred S. Cassey 1863 Broadside listing Alfred as a speaker calling men of color to arms. Son Alfred S. Cassey continued his father's legacy for being foremost in the ranks of the African- American elite of the day. A postal worker and performing musician, although his early trade was as a gilder, carver, and painter of ornamental work, Alfred was the first Chair of the American Negro Historical Society in 1897 and lived with his family in this house. He was active in the boycott campaign to end discrimination of black troops in 1864. Black soldiers at Camp William Penn were stationed in leaky tents while their white counterparts were housed in barracks, family members were not allowed to visit, black soldiers were paid $3 less than white soldiers, or only $10 per month, and had to provide their own clothing while military clothing was provided for white soldiers. Black soldiers were not allowed to ride the trolleys into town if the cars were full of white soldiers. This campaign led to the formation of the Pennsylvania State Equal Rights League in 1864. During the 1860s, Alfred signed the petition to singer Madame Mary Brown and the open Call to Arms during the Civil War. Along with Alfred, a Joseph W. Cassey (relation unknown, Alfred's son?) signed these same petitions. Alfred was active in the Masons of Philadelphia, was pall-bearer at the funeral of Colonel McKee in 1902, and donated many old concert programs to the William Dorsey Collection, now at Cheyney University. Joseph C. Cassey Son Joseph C. Cassey was principal bookkeeper to Stephen Smith and William Whipper, lumber merchants in Columbia, Pennsylvania, and notable African-Americans in Philadelphia. Joseph C. was credited with being one of the best accountants and businessmen in the U.S. in his era. He went on to own and run the leading lumber business in the Penn Yan area of western New York. Matilda Inez Cassey Granddaughter Matilda Inez Cassey was a pianist, performing concerts in Philadelphia, and lived her whole life in the Cassey House. Deed records for the Cassey House As for the Cassey holdings at 243 Delancey Street, formerly 63 Union Street, according to deed records, Joseph bought the back portion of the property in 1845. As no building was described in this deed, the stand-alone trinity probably was constructed under the patronage of Joseph Cassey. In 1866, the whole of 243 Delancey Street, with all buildings, including the main house and now the three trinities, was bought by Francis L. Cassey at a Sheriff‚Äôs sale. Francis transferred the property to Alfred‚Äôs wife, Abby A. Cassey, in 1871. Alfred S. and Abby Cassey were recorded to have lived there at least from 1867 to 1903 per Philadelphia City Directory records. Abby willed the property to Matilda Inez Cassey. The estate of Matilda, who likely lived her whole life in the main house, sold the property in 1917. The final Cassey interest in the property, one trinity, was sold by James G. A. Cassey in 1929. Copies of these deeds can be found at the Philadelphia City Archives and at the Blockson Collection, Temple University in the Cassey file. Deed records can be traced back to William Penn. New Sweden in Society Hill When the Swedes bought the land for New Sweden from local Indian chiefs around 1638, property that later became Philadelphia, Wilmington, and parts of Maryland, they brought with them an architectural classic, the log cabin. A lesser-known style of Swedish architecture, adopted by the English when they took over New Sweden in 1682, was the gambrel roof, a roof with two slopes, the lower slope steeper than the upper slope. While New Sweden may have lacked the money and architecturally savvy patrons to construct more elegant structures at the time, the simple design of the gambrel roof was relatively common and preferred by the merchant population of the day, as it maximized the floor space of the loft area. The Rhoads-Barclay House at 217 Delancey Street A few remaining examples of this Swedish architecture can still be seen in Society Hill at 217 (Rhoads-Barclay House) and 243 Delancey Street (the Cassey House), believed to have been built in the 1780s and first formally deeded in 1810. This latter residence is actually an even rarer example of a half-gambrel roof with the original dormer window. Exceedingly few of these structures remain in the former colonies, let alone Philadelphia. Other half-gambrels can be seen at The Man Full of Trouble Tavern (1759), Drinker‚Äôs Court (1756), Bell‚Äôs Court (c. 1810), part of Bridget Foy‚Äôs roof, and behind the Nicholas Biddle (banker) House south of Washington Square (Philadelphia). Besides the uniqueness and historical significance of the half-gambrel roof design, the house is also an example of a flounder house, a residential structure with a tall, windowless side wall reminiscent of the eyeless side of the flounder and a half gable roof resulting in one wall being taller than the opposite wall. While more familiarly known as an early architectural style in historic Alexandria, Virginia, dating from the late 18th century, this brick flounder with half- gambrel roof, Flemish-bond fa√ßade, and walls two courses thick, is a classic example of a flounder house where the gable faces the street, the windowless side abuts the property line, and the structure is built on the street edge of the property leaving more space behind the home for a courtyard. As Alexandria was closely tied to Philadelphia by significant seaborne trade, it is not surprising that the two sister cities have very similar historical architecture. Anachronistic changes to the house were made around 1965 by Adolph De Roy Mark, an architect instrumental in the 1960s restoration of Society Hill.

First used in the making of soaps, oleochemistry is now part of our daily lives where it is found in a wide variety of sectors like food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and industrial. The resulting product can be called Oleochemicals (from Latin: oleum ‚Äúolive oil‚Äù). They are analogous to petrochemicals derived from petroleum. The formation of basic oleochemical substances like fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), fatty alcohols, fatty amines and glycerols are by various chemical and enzymatic reactions. Intermediate chemical substances produced from these basic oleochemical substances include alcohol ethoxylates, alcohol sulfates, alcohol ether sulfates, quaternary ammonium salts, monoacylglycerols (MAG), diacylglycerols (DAG), structured triacylglycerols (TAG), sugar esters, and other oleochemical products. As the price of crude oil rose in the late 1970s, manufacturers switched from petrochemicals to oleochemicals because plant-based lauric oils processed from palm kernel oil were cheaper. Since then, palm kernel oil is predominantly used in the production of laundry detergent and personal care items like toothpaste, soap bars, shower cream and shampoo.  Processes  Important processeses in oleochemical manufacturing include hydrolysis and transesterification, among others. Hydrolysis The splitting (or hydrolysis) of the triglycerides produces fatty acids and glycerol: :RCO2CH2‚ÄìCHO2CR‚ÄìCH2O2CR + 3 H2O -> 3 RCOOH + HOCH2‚ÄìCHOH‚ÄìCH2OH The addition of base helps the reaction proceed more quickly, the process being saponification. Transesterification Fats react with alcohols (R'OH) instead of with water in hydrolysis) in a process called transesterification. Glycerol is produced together with the fatty acid esters. Most typically, the reaction entails the use of methanol (MeOH) to give fatty acid methyl esters: :RCO2CH2‚ÄìCHO2CR‚ÄìCH2O2CR + 3 MeOH -> 3 RCO2Me + HOCH2‚ÄìCHOH‚ÄìCH2OH FAMEs are less viscous than the precursor fats and can be purified to give the individual fatty acid esters, e.g. methyl oleate vs methyl palmitate. Hydrogenation The fatty acid or fatty esters produced by these methods may be transformed. For example, hydrogenation converts unsaturated fatty acids into saturated fatty acids. The acids or esters can also be reduced to the fatty alcohols. For some applications, fatty acids are converted to fatty nitriles. Hydrogenated of these nitriles gives fatty amines, which have a variety of applications.Karsten Eller, Erhard Henkes, Roland Rossbacher, Hartmut H√∂ke \\"Amines, Aliphatic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim, 2005. Applications The largest application for oleochemicals, about 30% of market share for fatty acids and 55% for fatty alcohols, is for making soaps and detergents.The Changing World of Oleochemicals Wolfgang Rupilius and Salmiah Ahmad, Palm Oil Developments 44, 2005 Lauric acid, used to produce sodium lauryl sulfate and related compounds, which are used to make soaps and other personal care products. Other applications of oleochemicals include the production of lubricants, solvents, biodiesel and bioplastics. Due to the use of methyl esters in biodiesel production, they represent the fastest growing sub-sector of oleochemical production in recent years. Oleochemical industry development = Europe  Through the 1996 creation of Novance and the 2008 acquisition of Oleon, Avril Group has dominated the European market of oleochemistry Southeast Asia Southeast Asian countries' rapid production growth of palm oil and palm kernel oil in the 1980s spurred the oleochemical industry in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Many oleochemical plants were built. Though a nascent and small industry when pitted against big detergent giants in the US and Europe, oleochemical companies in southeast Asia had competitive edge in cheap ingredients.The Future of Palm Oil in Oleochemicals Appalasami & de Vries, Palm Oil Developments 14-3, 1990 The US fatty chemical industry found it difficult to consistently maintain acceptable levels of profits. Competition was intense with market shares divided among many companies there where neither imports nor exports played a significant role. By the late 1990s, giants like Henkel, Unilever, and Petrofina sold their oleochemical factories to focus on higher profit activities like retail of consumer goods. Since the Europe outbreak of 'mad cow disease' or (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) in 2000, tallow is replaced for many uses by vegetable oleic fatty acids, such as palm kernel and coconut oils.

It is also known as the Moureaux Law, as it was proposed to the Parliament by Justice Minister Philippe Moureaux. Historical context The first Belgian law proposal against racism was introduced in the wake of the signature by Belgium of the 1965 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination at the Chamber of deputies by the Socialist MP Ernest Glinne on December 1, 1966, at the request of the MRAX (Movement against racism, antisemitism and xenophobia, Belgian equivalent of the French MRAP) which had prepared the proposal.Belgium signed it on August 17, 1967 and ratified it on August 7, 1975 (status); see also Declarations and Reservations by Belgium The law proposal was introduced twice in 1966‚Äì1967 and again twice in 1968‚Äì1969.A l‚Äôoccasion du 30√®me anniversaire de la ¬´ loi Moureaux ¬ª , MRAX, 30 July 2011Session of December 1, 1966 , Belgian House of representativesFull chronology (in French):Avant la loi antiraciste‚Ä¶ (Historique 1966-1981), R√©sistanceS On July 20, 1980, a terrorist attack against Jewish children took place in Antwerp (Lamorini√®restraat),\\"Een eeuw in beeld. 1980 \\", Gazet van Antwerpen then a French-Algerian man was killed on December 4 in Brussels by members of the extreme right wing Front de la jeunesse,Ren√© Haquin, \\"Ann√©es 1980.

Biography Guiler was born in Boston, Massachusetts, lived in Puerto Rico as a child, went to school in Scotland, and graduated from Columbia University where he studied economics and literature. He was working at National City Bank when he met Ana√Øs Nin. They married in March 1923. In 1924, they moved to Paris, and in that city Nin's wrote the best known part of her famous diary. In 1939, shortly before World War II, Parker and Nin moved back to New York City. In 1940, he took up engraving and etching, studying under Stanley William Hayter of Atelier 17 in Paris, producing surreal images that often accompanied Nin's books. He received advice and instruction in filmmaking from Alexander Hammid, who told Guiler \\"Use the camera yourself, make your own mistakes, make your own style\\". He adopted the name Ian Hugo in the 1940s when he began making experimental films, some starring Nin. His successful banking career supported not only the very late recognized artistic work of his wife, and later his own, but also Henry Miller's and to a lesser extent various others. His unusual tolerance and unconditional love, as well as his income, made Ana√Øs's unusual work and life possible. Because of Ana√Øs's Madame Bovary way with money, his dedication to the arts and taking more risks later in life, he needed the money that Ana√Øs's writing brought so late in their lives. His own art was never financially successful. The film Bells of Atlantis (1952) features a soundtrack of electronic music by Louis and Bebe Barron, and stars Nin as a mythical queen of Atlantis. In Jazz of Lights (1954), also featuring a score by the Barrons, the street lights of Times Square become, in Nin's words, \\"an ephemeral flow of sensations.\\" Hugo lived the last two decades of his life in New York City, dictating his memoirs and continuing his engraving and filmmaking work. He briefly met Nin's other husband, Rupert Pole, after Nin's death in 1977. Even though Nin and Pole's 1955 marriage was annulled in 1966, Pole was Nin's literary executor after her death; after Guiler's death, Pole scattered his ashes at the same place as Nin's, a cove on the coast at Santa Monica.

An all ages version of Clear, published by Sweets, was released on February 19, 2009 for the PlayStation 2. Clear is Moonstone's sixth game; Moonstone has also developed Gift. The gameplay in Clear follows a plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters. Moonstone later released a fan disc titled Clear: Crystal Stories in May 2008. Before the game's release, a manga based on the story, drawn by Japanese artist Yukiwo, was serialized in the seinen magazine Comp Ace. An illustrated story of Clear serialized in the Dengeki Hime magazine. Other media such as an image song single, a vocal mini album, drama CDs, and a short story collection called Clear Short Stories were produced. Gameplay Clear is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of K≈çichi Yukino. Its gameplay mainly consists of reading and progressing through the story's narrative and dialogue. The game's text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who K≈çichi is talking to, appearing on top of background artwork. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the regular background art and character sprites. Clear follows a branching plot line with nonlinear sequences and multiple endings, where the plot's direction is affected by the player's decisions. The gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent on simply reading the text that will appear on the screen; this text represents either dialogue between the various characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a \\"decision point\\" where they are given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. During these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction, depending on which choice the player makes. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the five heroines in the story. In order to view the five plot lines to their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points in order to further the plot in an alternate direction. Throughout gameplay, there are scenes depicting K≈çichi and a given heroine having sexual intercourse. Plot and characters Clear's story is set on the island Harukajima. , the protagonist, used to live on the island, but moved to Tokyo as a child. K≈çichi comes back from Tokyo to this very ordinary and small island off the coast from mainland Japan and lives with his grandfather. When he returns, a part of his childhood memory on the island is missing. K≈çichi is not a normal human; he is a type of blood-sucking vampire, though he cannot attack people, due to a certain rule. He came to attend his current school because this secret was exposed in his old town on an island offshore Japan. K≈çichi has a younger female cousin called . After her parents died, she was adopted into his family as his sister. After her brother transfers schools, she does as well so she can still go to the same school as him.

Lisco rose to international prominence during the Salvadoran Civil War when he called attention to human rights atrocities committed against El Salvador's indigenous peoples, who number about 1 percentEl Salvador of the country's 7 million people. Early life Adrian Esquino Lisco was born in Comarca San Ramon, in western Sonsonate Department, El Salvador. He was of indigenous Nahua heritage. Esquino Lisco's older brother had been killed during the suppression of the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising (also called La matanza) by the Salvadoran dictatorship. Esquino Lisco was described as a short, soft- spoken man who was less than 5 feet tall. He was a farmer and artisan by profession. Esquino Lisco's father founded the Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Indigenas de El Salvador (ANIS) in 1954. The main purpose of the ANIS was to preserve the culture, customs and language of El Salvador's indigenous groups, including the Lenca, Maya and Nahua. The organization generally worked behind the scenes to preserve El Salvador's indigenous heritage. Many indigenous Salvadorans considered it too dangerous to speak their native languages or even wear traditional clothing ever since the massacre that ended the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Adrian Esquino Lisco inherited the title of spiritual chief in 1976 and became head of the Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Indigenas de El Salvador. He attended a number of indigenous peoples conferences throughout the late 1970s throughout the world. Through Esquino Lisco's work, the ANIS finally won legal recognition from the Salvadoran government of President Jos√© Napole√≥n Duarte in 1980. Salvadoran Civil War (1980 - 1992) Adrian Esquino Lisco first appeared in international news coverage of the civil war when he began calling attention to the February 23, 1983 Salvadoran army-led attack on an indigenous farm cooperative in Las Hojas, El Salvador. Salvadoran soldiers captured 74 male villagers, tied their thumbs behind their backs shot them. A Salavadoran federal judge later reported just 18 dead. An El Salvadoran federal human rights commission, charged with investigating the Las Hojas massacre and other violations, did not accomplish much, reportedly because of pressure from the country's army. The commanders of the Salavadoran troops at Las Hojas were given amnesty in the 1990s as part of a broader Central American peace plan. Esquino Lisco and others blamed wealthy Salvadoran landowners for the atrocity at Las Hojas. Lisco accused influential landowners of using the army to destroy the Las Hojas cooperative. Landowners often considered the farm cooperatives to be subversive, even Communist. Attempts at farm reforms were begun in the late 1970s, but were soon halted, leading to resentment from both peasants and wealthy landowners. Esquino Lisco once had an encounter with Colonel Elmer Gonzales Araujo, one of the leading commanders at Las Hojas. Gonzales Araujo reportedly told Lisco that his soldiers were defending themselves against \\"armed subversives.\\" Lisco later told The New York Times that, \\"I asked the army high command how guerrillas could die with their hands tied behind their backs.\\" Esquino Lisco went to Washington D.C. during the height of the Salvadoran Civil War to draw attention to the war's atrocities. He soon found receptive supporters in the U.S. Congress, most notably Senator Ted Kennedy and U.S. Representative Joe Moakley. His work in Washington put pressure on the Salvadoran government. According to Francisco Acosta, a Salvadoran activist based in Maryland, Lisco's lobbying of Congress led to the release of more than 100 political prisoners from government custody. Death Adrian Esquino Lisco died of complications from diabetes, including kidney failure, at a hospital in El Salvador's capital, San Salvador on September 8, 2007. He was 68 years old.

Biography Kilbourne was born on December 23, 1872, in Fort Myer, Virginia, the place where his father (also an Army officer) was stationed at the time. He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in 1894 with academic distinction, winning the Second Jackson-Hope Medal for academic achievement. Kilbourne was an Honor Graduate of the Artillery School in 1903, a graduate of the General Staff College in 1920, and served as VMI's sixth Superintendent, October 1, 1937 to July 11, 1946. Prior to joining the army, he worked for the Weather Bureau.A Concise History of the US Army Signal Corps He was also a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Military service Grave at Arlington National Cemetery He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant, May 20, 1898 in the Signal Corps and eventually reached the rank of Major General, July 9, 1935.Davis, Jr., Henry Blaine (1998). Generals in Khaki. Pentland Press, Inc. p. 214. . OCLC 40298151 Kilbourne served in the Philippine-American War as a second lieutenant in the campaign which captured Manila and included operations in Cavite, Laguna and Bulacan Provinces. He served in the Boxer Rebellion in China and the relief of the Allied legations in Peking and in operations in South Sulu. Kilbourne had five tours of duty in the Philippines. He was responsible for much of the military development of the island fortress of Corregidor. During his third assignment there, from 1908 to 1913, he established the first artillery garrison on Corregidor. In later Philippine duty in the late 1920s, Gen. Kilbourne initiated the elaborate tunnel system of Corregidor (Malinta Tunnel) which served American troops during the early stages of World War II and enabled Gen. MacArthur's troops to resist as long as they did in the face of the overwhelming odds in favor of the Japanese. He was assigned to duty with the General Staff from 1911‚Äì1913 and again in 1915. He arrived in France on January 1, 1918 for service in World War I where he served on both the British and French fronts for a short period and then returned to Washington in March. While on an inspection tour, he lost the vision in his right eye in the explosion of a trench mortar shell. He returned to France in May 1918 with the 89th Division, continuing with that unit until October 6, 1918. He commanded the 36th Heavy Artillery Brigade and the 3rd Infantry Brigade during the remainder of his service in France and Germany. He was the head of the U.S. Mission inspecting the coastal defenses of Europe and Turkey and returned to the U.S. in May 1919 to serve on the faculty of the Army War College from, 1920 - 1924. He later served as one of the directors of the college. He was Commandant of Boston Harbor from 1924‚Äì25 and Executive Assistant to the Chief of Coast Artillery from 1925 - 1928. In 1928 he commanded the 2nd Infantry Brigade, 1st Division until 1929 after which he commanded the Coast Artillery District of Manila and Subic Bay from 1929‚Äì1932 and served in the War Plans Division in Washington D.C. from 1932 - 1934. He commanded the Sixth Corps Area and 2nd Army, 1936. Kilbourne retired from the Army in 1936 as a Major General. He died on November 12, 1963, and is buried in Section 3 of Arlington National Cemetery. Educator According to William H. Milton, Jr, Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute, 1952‚Äì60, \\"In April, 1937, the Virginia Military Institute Board of Visitors named him superintendent of V.M.I. to succeed General John A. Lejeune. He came to the Institute in time to plan and direct the centennial celebration of the founding of V.M.I. and served during the trying war years when problems of discipline and of economy in operation were staggering in number and complexity. He brought to V.M.I. not only the training of a soldier but the compelling power of his own example as a Christian gentleman.\\"Ibid, p. 172. Writer Gen. Kilbourne was also a prolific writer.

It is one of Europe's strongest life science clusters, with many life science companies and research institutions located within a relatively small geographical area. The name has officially been in use since 1997. Major life science sectors of the Medicon Valley cluster includes pharmacology, biotechnology, health tech and medical technology. It is specifically known for its research strengths in the areas of neurological disorders, inflammatory diseases, cancer and diabetes.  Background and activities  The population of Medicon Valley reaches close to 4 million inhabitants. In 2008, 60% of Scandinavian pharmaceutical companies were located in the region. The area includes 17 universities, 32 hospitals, and more than 400 life science companies. 20 are large pharmaceutical or medical technology firms and 170 are dedicated biotechnology firms. Between 1998 and 2008, 100 new biotechnology and medical technology companies were created here. The biotechnology industry alone employs around 41,000 people in the region, 7,000 of whom are academic researchers. International companies with major research centres in the region include Novo Nordisk, Baxter, Lundbeck, LEO Pharma, HemoCue and Ferring Pharmaceuticals. There are more than 7 science parks in the region, all with a significant focus on life science, including the Medicon Village in Lund, established in 2010. Companies within Medicon Valley account for more than 20% of the total GDP of Denmark and Sweden combined. Medicon Valley is promoted by Invest in Sk√•ne and Copenhagen Capacity.Medicon Valley Many of the region's universities have a strong heritage in biological and medical research and have produced several Nobel Prize winners. The almost century-long presence of a number of research-intensive and fully integrated pharmaceutical companies, such as Novo Nordisk, H.

His artistic innovations and technical virtuosity gained wood engraving a foothold as a high art form in twentieth-century America. Landacre's linocuts and wood engravings of landscapes, still lifes, nudes, and abstractions are acclaimed for the beauty of their designs and a mastery of materials. He used the finest inks and imported handmade Japanese papers and, with a few exceptions, printed his wood engravings in his studio on a nineteenth-century Washington Hand Press, which is now in the collection of the International Printing Museum in Carson, California.  Early life in Columbus, Ohio, and San Diego, California  Paul Hambleton Landacre was born in Columbus, Ohio, in 1893, into a family of scientists. His father Walter graduated college with a degree in analytical chemistry and worked as an analytical and consulting chemist. His uncle Frank received a doctorate from the University of Chicago, became a full professor of anatomy at Ohio State University, and President of the Ohio Academy of Science. Landacre's mother, Clara Jane Hambleton, also came from a well-educated and scientifically-minded family largely of Quaker descent. Her brother, James Chace Hambleton, was a naturalist who served as the first president of the Audubon Society in Columbus, Ohio. During his sophomore year at Ohio State University, Landacre suffered a debilitating streptococcus infection that left his right leg permanently stiffened and his dreams of becoming an Olympic track and field athlete shattered. In 1917, after an extended hospitalization, he left Ohio to convalesce in the more healthful climate outside San Diego where his father and step-mother had recently relocated. Landacre met his future wife, Margaret McCreery, in San Diego where they both worked in the advertising industry. Also a transplanted Midwesterner (born in Missouri in 1891), McCreery wrote advertising copy and advanced her prospects by moving to downtown Los Angeles. Landacre soon followed. They were married in July 1925 in Laguna Beach. McCreery played an instrumental, behind-the-scenes role in her husband's successful transition to becoming a professional printmaker of national renown. In the turbulent wake of his wife's passing in 1963, Paul declared that \\"everything I did in my work and everything I thought or said was as much or more of Margaret's as it was mine.\\"Letter from Paul Landacre to Eleanor Stelzer of the Origins of Art Research Foundation, May 8, 1963. William Andrews Clark Memorial Library.  Career in Los Angeles  Although he took a few life-drawing classes at the Otis Art Institute between 1923 and 1925, Landacre largely taught himself the art of printmaking. He experimented with the technically demanding art of carving linoleum blocks and, eventually, woodblocks for both wood engravings and woodcuts. His fascination with printmaking and his ambition to make a place for himself in the world of fine art coalesced in the late 1920s when he met Jake Zeitlin. Zeitlin's antiquarian bookshop in Los Angeles‚Äîa cultural hub that survived into the 1980s‚Äîincluded a small gallery space for the showing of artworks, primarily prints and drawings, and it is there in 1929 that Landacre's first prints were exhibited. In early 1930 Zeitlin gave Landacre his first significant solo exhibition in southern California. Zeitlin's ever-widening circle of artists included Edward Weston, a photographer, and Henrietta Shore, a painter and printmaker, each of whom shared the modernist vision that so captivated Landacre. In early 1934, Zeitlin, together with screenwriter and Hollywood insider Delmer Daves, organized the Paul Landacre Association. Its thirteen original members included a cross section of local cultural and industrial elites who reflected the vigor, wealth, and cosmopolitan nature of early modern Los Angeles. Each member committed $100 annually to purchase Landacre's new works. During the Association's six-plus years, Landacre \\"reached artistic maturity and produced a succession of award-winning prints ....\\"Wien, Jake Milgram, Paul Landacre's World. The Magazine ANTIQUES, July/August 2016. Well- connected to the New York art scene, Zeitlin handled the work of many American artists represented by Carl Zigrosser, director of the Weyhe Gallery in Manhattan and, later, curator of prints at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. By 1936 Zigrosser considered Landacre to be \\"one of the few graphic artists worth watching\\" in America, and included him among his portraits of 24 contemporary American printmakers in his seminal work, \\"The Artist in America\\" (Knopf 1942). Rockwell Kent also praised Landacre as, without exception, the finest wood engraver in America.Los Angeles Times, July 2, 1939, C7. Elected an associate member of the National Academy of Design in 1939 and a full Academician in 1946, Landacre was honored in 1947 with a solo exhibition of his wood engravings at the Smithsonian Museum, its graphic arts division under the curatorial leadership of Jacob Kainen. Los Angeles printer and book designer Harry Ward Ritchie (Ward Ritchie) also recognized Landacre's extraordinary gifts and between 1932 and 1957 collaborated with him on some 25 printing projects. Often, Ritchie commissioned Landacre to conceive decorative wood engravings for privately distributed books of small format and limited edition. Of national and local appeal, many of Landacre's linoleum cuts and wood engravings were inspired by the American Far West, including the hills and mountains of Big Sur, Palm Springs, Monterey, and Berkeley. \\"California Hills and Other Wood Engravings by Paul Landacre\\" (Los Angeles: Bruce McCallister, 1931), a limited-edition folio comprising 15 of Landacre's early works printed from the original blocks, was awarded recognition as one of the \\"Fifty Books of the Year\\" for 1931. In rapid succession, three books featuring his wood engraved designs also garnered such recognition: \\"The Boar and the Shibboleth\\" (1933), \\"A Gil Blas in California\\" (1933), and \\"XV Poems for the Heath Broom\\" (1934). In the 1950s, the AIGA recognized \\"A Natural History of Western Trees\\" (1953) and \\"Books West Southwest, Essays on Writers, Their Books and Their Land\\" (1957) as \\"Fifty Books of the Year\\", and they became the fifth and sixth books with Landacre designs to win the prestigious award. For \\"Trees\\" Landacre contributed more than 200 ink drawings on scratchboard. Landacre achieved a singular, mature style lauded for its formal beauty‚Äîmeticulously carved fine lines, delicate cross hatching, and flecking‚Äîelements in white which strikingly contrast with velvety blacks. His prints, including the early linocuts, gained early and lasting critical recognition, were awarded numerous prizes, and are found in more than a hundred and fifty public collections throughout the United States.These include the National Gallery of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Huntington Library, Art Institute of Chicago, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Amon Carter Museum of American Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Library of Congress, New York Public Library, Boston Public Library, William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, and Smithsonian American Art Museum. Landacre died in 1963, soon after, and emotionally resulting from, the death of his wife who had been an essential working companion for 38 years, even helping the artist late in his life pull impressions from the formidable Washington Hand Press.  Landacre Residence Is Now A City of Los Angeles Historic- Cultural Monument  In March 1932, the artist and his wife purchased a rustic one-bedroom bungalow at 2006 El Moran Street where they lived for the remainder of their lives. The modest home was perched near the top of an impossibly steep and winding Peru Street. The neighborhood tract was known as the Semi-Tropic Spiritualists' Association in an area of Echo Park formerly known as Edendale, an historic district near downtown Los Angeles. Conservationist Charles Fisher successfully applied for landmark status, and in March 2006, the Landacres's hillside home was declared City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 839.

Originally constructed as part of the Norman invasion of Wales, the castle was designed as a ringwork overlooking the town in either the late-11th or early-12th centuries. It was rebuilt in stone around 1200 by the de Braose family and then had a turbulent history, being attacked and burnt several times during the First and Second Barons' Wars, the wars with the Welsh princes, the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr and the Wars of the Roses. In the 17th century a Jacobean mansion house was built alongside the medieval keep and the property became a private home. Serious fires in 1939 and 1977 gutted the castle and, despite repairs in the 1980s, by the 21st century much of the building was derelict and unstable. Since 2011 it has been owned by the Hay Castle Trust who plan to renovate the property to form an arts and education centre. History=11th‚Äì16th centuries Depiction of Hay-on-Wye in 1823, showing the castle overlooking the town The Normans began to make incursions into South Wales from the late-1060s onwards, pushing westwards from their bases in recently occupied England. Their advance was marked by the construction of castles and the creation of regional lordships.; The Norman adventurer Bernard de Neufmarch√© conquered Brecknock in 1091 and assigned the manor of Hay to one of his followers, Philip Walwyn. The first castle in Hay, later abandoned, was built by St Mary's church outside the main settlement, where a motte known as Hay Tump still survives. The English lordship of Hay, known as Hay Anglicana, became a wealthy walled town and the lands passed by marriage to Miles of Gloucester and then into the de Braose family.; ; In the late 11th or early 12th century, a new fortification was built inside Hay-on-Wye itself, on high ground around from the old motte, taking the form of an earth ringwork with a stone gate-tower.; The de Braose dynasty expanded Hay Castle in stone around 1200 with a curtain wall reinforced by intramural timbers, turning the gate- tower into a keep.; The castle tenants used the chapel of St John in the town for their worship. During the First Barons' War, Reginald de Braose joined the alliance against King John who successfully attacked the castle in 1215. The Welsh prince Llewelyn the Great attacked and burnt the town and castle in 1231 and the castle was then rebuilt by Henry III in 1233. During the Second Barons' War, Prince Edward captured the castle in 1263 but it was recaptured and burnt by Simon de Montfort and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd the following year. It was further damaged by the Welsh rebellion led by Owain Glynd≈µr around 1401 and in 1460 during the Wars of the Roses.; ; By the time the antiquarian John Leland visited in the 16th century, the town of Hay was \\"wonderfully decaied\\" although the castle was described as having once \\"bene right stately\\". 17th‚Äì19th centuries Depiction of the castle in 1816 Hay Castle was substantially expanded in the 17th century, creating a Jacobean mansion. Two explanations have been offered by historians for this redevelopment. One option is that during the first half of the 17th century, Howell Gwynne built a manor house to the west of the old keep, which was replaced by a new mansion in 1660 by James Boyle of Hereford. Another reverses this sequence, suggesting that James Boyle left the castle to Howell Gwynne in 1603, and that the mansion was built at the beginning of the century.; In either case, the Jacobean building was two storeys tall, three with its facade included, and featured seven dormer gables in a Dutch style and a large staircase.; It was built from stone and incorporated the upper floors of the old keep into its design.; Formal gardens were constructed outside the keep either around the start of the 17th century or after 1660.; In 1702, the house was divided up among different tenants, and passed into the hands of the local Wellington family.; Until 1812, the basement of the keep was used to supplement the town gaol.; In 1809, the industrialist Sir Joseph Bailey leased the castle, going on to purchase it outright in 1844, and established a walled kitchen garden known as Castle Gardens to the south-west of the main castle. It was used as a vicarage from 1825 onwards, including by Archdeacon William Bevan.; The terraced gardens were maintained during the 19th century, with various trees planted behind the castle in the 1860s and 1870s, and a stable block was built within the grounds.; ; 20th‚Äì21st centuries Plan of the castle in the 21st century; A ‚Äì terraced gardens; B ‚Äì mansion; C ‚Äì keep and gateway; D ‚Äì stable and service block; E ‚Äì rear garden Between 1904 and 1906 the castle was rented by the Morell family, after which it was occupied by the Dowager Lady Glanusk. The architect W. D. Caroe was employed to restore the house in 1910 and it was sold to the banker Benjamin Guiness in 1937. A major fire then destroyed the interior of the eastern side of the castle in 1939. Around 1961, the castle was acquired by Richard Booth who used it as a bookstore and as a location for parties, with a holiday cottage in the grounds.; ; Much of the walled garden was sold for development in 1975, and another fire in 1977 destroyed the interior of the western half of the castle: repairs were carried out from the 1980s onwards.; In 2011 the castle was sold for around ¬£2 million to the Hay Castle Trust, who intend to turn it into an arts and education centre.; The firm of Rick Mather Architects were taken on in 2015 to manage the work at a projected cost of ¬£4.35 million, to include a new art gallery and a viewing point at the top of the keep. A grant of ¬£528,600 from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2014 supported initial planning, and further grants were given by the Country Houses Foundation and the Headley Trust. The castle site is now approximately across. As of 2015, the derelict, roofless parts of the castle are in a poor structural condition and infested with ivy, with other parts suffering from death watch beetle.; None of the earthworks or curtain wall survive, except for a small portion next to the gateway; this fragment of wall is thick and shows the original bank to have been as much as high when viewed from the outside, but is now in danger of collapse.; The wooden door on the left side of the gateway probably dates from around 1300, and the right door from the early-17th century, but they are currently unusable.; There are some limited remains of the old walled garden interspersed in the modern housing estate.; The main castle site is protected under law as a Grade I listed building.

He was the father of the author and politician the Hon. William Pember Reeves. Reeves was born in 1825 in Clapham, Surrey, England. He represented the Avon electorate from an to 1868, when he resigned as the November 1867 death of his business partner, Crosbie Ward, prevented him from attending the upcoming parliamentary session in Wellington. He contested the Selwyn electorate in 1871 against Edward Cephas John Stevens and had a majority of one vote. He was Resident Minister for the Middle (South) Island in the 3rd Fox Ministry in 1871‚Äì1872. The dominant topic for the 1875 election was the abolition of the Provinces. Reeves favoured the retention of the provincial system of government, whilst Cecil Fitzroy, 20 years his junior, was an abolitionist. Fitzroy narrowly won the election in the Selwyn electorate by 14 votes. On 21 October 1884, Reeves was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council. He served until his death on 4 April 1891. He was a journalist and newspaper proprietor in Christchurch and Lyttelton, and was the principal proprietor of the Lyttelton Times, though he died virtually bankrupt (he had failed on the Stock Exchange in England before migrating to New Zealand).Biography of his son William Pember Reeves in the 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand Reeves underwent an operation at the end of March 1891. Later in the week, complications set in and he died the following day on 4 April 1891 at his homestead 'Risingholme'. He is buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery and it was the largest Christchurch funeral since William Sefton Moorhouse had died 10 years earlier. Risingholme in the Christchurch suburb of Opawa was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand) as a Category II heritage building on 24 June 2005. Reeves was survived by his wife and their eight children. His son, William Pember Reeves, who became a dominant politician in New Zealand, was married to Maud Pember Reeves. Amber Reeves was his granddaughter.

Philanthropy News Digest called it \\"direct, succinct, and illustrated with concrete examples.\\"Amazon Detailed Book Review In 2007, Martin published her second book, RenGen:Renaissance Generation - The Rise of the Cultural Consumer and What it Means to Your Business. The book detailed Martin's theory about the RenGen, or Renaissance Generation, an emerging group of individuals who are hungry for innovative ideas and ways to express them. RenGen also refers to a growing cultural movement formed by the confluence of art, education, entertainment and business. According to Martin, a powerful new player is at the center of this RenGen: the cultural consumer. Cultural consumers thrive on information and ideas to fuel their creative self-expression. Martin proposes that as the RenGen gathers force in our civilization, it will change how Americans live and work.Martin, Patricia RenGen:Renaissance Generation - The Rise of the Cultural Consumer and What it Means to Your Business.

The waterfall, which lies at the base of Torc Mountain, in the Killarney National Park, is from Killarney in Kerry, Ireland. The waterfall is a popular site on the Ring of Kerry and the Kerry Way tours. Naming Lower section of Torc Waterfall The word Torc is from the Irish translation of a \\"wild boar\\", and the area is associated with legends involving wild boars. One legend is of a man who was cursed by the Devil to spend each night transformed into a wild boar, but when his secret was revealed by a local farmer, he burst into flames and disappeared into the nearby Devils Punchbowl on Mangerton Mountain from which the Owengarriff River emerged to hide the entrance to his cave beneath the Torc Waterfall. There is also the story of how the legendary Irish warrior, Fionn MacCumhaill, killed a magical boar on Torc mountain with his golden spear. Geology Pathway up the Torc Waterfall The 20 meters high waterfall is formed by the Owengarriff River as it drains from the Devil's Punchbowl lough, a deep cirque high above in Mangerton Mountain. Torc Waterfall sits on a geological fault called the Muckross to Millstreet Fault Line. Torc Mountain consists of 400 million-year-old Devonian Old Red Sandstone, but the base around Muckross Lake is circa 100 million years younger and consists of Carboniferous Limestone. At some stage, after the limestone was deposited, a period of tectonic-plate collision occurred and the land under Torc was lifted up 3,000 metres, re-exposing the underlying older sandstone. Visiting Torc Waterfall is from Killarney, and from the gates of Muckross House, in the Killarney National Park.Ireland for Dummies By Elizabeth Albertson, Liz Albertson p290 The cascade is one of the main points on the Kerry Way walking tour, and a popular stop-off location on the larger Ring of Kerry tour. The waterfalls are a 200 metre walk from the car park (at ) just off the N71 road,Frommer's Ireland Day by Day By Christi Daugherty, Jack Jewers p289 and the climb to the top of the waterfalls is by way of a stone path of about a hundred steps (and circa 55 metres in elevation gain), and takes around 30 minutes to complete. Red deer are frequently seen and heard in the area. Steps up Cardiac Hill Killarney National Park have a number of loop-trails around the Torc Waterfall of varying lengths, called the Blue, Yellow and Red Trails. The Red Trail climbs Cardiac Hill (also called Huntsman's Hill or the Cardiac Steps), and involves climbing a very steep series of stone steps (the starting point is half a kilometre west of the waterfall car-park off the N71) to an observation point and stone beehive hut, half-way up Torc Mountain at circa , giving views of the Lakes of Killarney, and then looping back eastwards to join the Old Kenmare Road and descend via Torc Waterfall. A marked hiking trail also runs from the waterfall to the top of Torc Mountain via the Old Kenmare Road, however, hikers can avoid Torc Waterfall and start from the upper car-park above the waterfall (at 55 metres, ), to complete the 8‚Äìkilometre 3 hour route to the summit of Torc Mountain and back.
