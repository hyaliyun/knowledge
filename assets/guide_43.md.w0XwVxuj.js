He appeared in more than 40 films and television productions between 1948 and 1975. In the 1960s he also worked as a theatre director in West Germany. Personal life Meyen was born in Hamburg, the son of a Jewish merchant who was deported to a concentration camp during the Nazi regime. The 18-year-old Meyen himself was incarcerated\\"Die K√∂nigin der Schmerzen\\" by Matthias Matussek and Lars-Olav Beier, Der Spiegel (21 May 2007) as a Mischling and survived the Neuengamme concentration camp. After the war, he began his career with Willy Maertens at the Hamburg Thalia Theater. From 1952 he performed at the Theater Aachen and from 1955 moved to Berlin. Also starring in films directed by Helmut K√§utner, Falk Harnack and Wolfgang Staudte, he played the role of a young Luftwaffe officer in the 1955 movie Des Teufels General side by side with Curd J√ºrgens. He also worked as a dubbing actor giving his voice to Dirk Bogarde, Robert Mitchum, Michel Piccoli, Peter Sellers, and Jean-Louis Trintignant. From 1953 to 1966 he was married to actress Anneliese R√∂mer. In July 1966 he married Romy Schneider in Saint-Jean- Cap-Ferrat. Their son David Christopher was born 3 December 1966; the family lived in Berlin and later in Hamburg. Meyen dealt with the production of theatre plays and operas, however with moderate success. The couple finally divorced in 1975, and Schneider took their son with her to France. Meyen was a depressive, his condition caused by the torture he had received from the Nazis for being half-Jewish. In 1979, Meyen hanged himself at home in Hamburg. He is buried in the Ohlsdorf Cemetery. His son died in an accident two years later.

Ulubey Canyon Nature Park () is a nature park in the Ulubey and Karahallƒ± districts of U≈üak Province, Turkey. The canyon is the second longest in the world after the Grand Canyon in the United States. The park provides suitable habitat for many species of animals and plants and is being developed as a centre for ecotourism. Canyon Ulubey Canyon covers an area of . It is wide and deep, with a total length of . The streams Ulubey Creek and Banaz Creek (tributaries of B√ºy√ºk Menderes River) run through the Ulubey Canyon. The main canyon along both creeks has tens of big lateral canyons. The walls of the canyon are and high. At least three terraces are visible in the canyon walls. In addition, there are many conical karstic hills along the canyon. Climate Being in a transitional zone between the Aegean and Central Anatolia regions, U≈üak Province exhibits the climate characteristics of both regions. The summer months are warmer and more arid than in the Aegean region, and the winter season is milder than in the Central Anatolian region. Rain brought by air masses from over the Aegean Sea generates a more humid climate than in Central Anatolia. Average annual precipitation is . Monthly or seasonal distribution of precipitation is irregular. Ecology =Flora= Plants growing in the nature park include the Turkish pine (Pinus brutia), rockrose (Cistus), oak (Quercus ithaburensis), Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), salt cedar (Tamarix), sumac (Rhus), hackberry (Celtis), broom (Genista), mullein (Verbascum), milkvetch (Astragalus) and wild marjoram (Origanum). =Fauna= The nature park provides suitable habitat for mammals such as the wild boar, hare, fox, jackal, gray wolf (Canis lupus), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), porcupine and jerboa, the reptiles tortoise, striped viper (Montivipera xanthina), the bird species red-legged partridge, common buzzard, hawk, common raven (Corvus corax), the fish species European chub (Squalius cephalus), catfish and the insect species multiple-eyespotted blue butterfly. Ecotourism The area hosted many civilizations in the past including Lydia, Achaemenid Empire, Macedonia, Kingdom of Pergamon, Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, Germiyanids and finally Ottoman Empire. The canyon system of Banaz-Ulubey has a significant potential for ecotourism in the country. In August 2013, the canyon was declared a nature park by the Ministry of Forest and Water Management. In 2015, a glass-floor observation deck in the form of a ship bow, constructed above the canyon floor, and a cafeteria were opened for tourism purposes. Hiking, trekking and camping using tents are popular outdoor activities in the canyon area. It was reported in June 2015 that about 40,000 tourists visited the nature park in one month. The number of visitors in one month rose to nearly 100,000 by March 2016. Notable places in the region are Cilandiras Bridge, Duraklƒ± Rock-cut tombs, Hask√∂y monuments, Pepuza, and Blaundus ancient towns, and Salma Creek.

Background and early life He was born a son of a decorator. Jakob studied in Rotterdam at the academy and helped his father in the decoration business. From 1873 to 1876 he studied at the Academy in Brussels, and after in Munich (1878‚Äì1880), Vienna (1880) and Rome (1880). In 1882 Jakob married his cousin Antje Doetje Kramer. They settled in Amsterdam where Smits worked as a painter. He carried out, among other things, tasks for the museum Boijmans-Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. Out of the marriage of Jakob and Antje were produced two children, Theodora and Annie. In 1884, the couple divorced. Notable achievements and associations Maternity in Red Boerenhuis, Jacob Smits's atelier in Mol-Achterbos Jakob Smits moved to Blaricum and in Haarlem becomes director of the Nijverheids- en Decoratieschool (E: Industry and Decoration school). He got to know Albert Neuhuys, a painter of The Hague School, and together they made excursions to Drenthe and the Campine in Belgium. Jakob Smits became impressed by the Campine landscape and he established himself in 1888, definitively in Achterbos (Mol). He paid 2,000 Belgian francs for a small farm which he developed to his Malvinahof. In the same year he married Malvina Dedeyn, the daughter of a Brussels lawyer, who is disinherited because of this marriage. Smits lived in poverty while he worked tirelessly for what he calls my simple work, symbolic, poetic and real. In 1897, he received a gold medal for his exhibitions of large water-colour paintings on a gold background in Munich and Dresden. He also painted many portraits, especially of Malvina and of their children Boby, Marguerite and Kobe. In 1899 destiny struck: in a few days he lost his daughter Alice and his wife. In 1901, Smits married Josine Van Cauteren. In the same year he held his first individual exposition in Antwerp. There he obtained much praise of colleagues and critics but found no buyers for his work. The exhibited work De vader van de veroordeelde (E: the father of the convict) was acquired later that year by the Museum of Brussels. Spring Smits financial situation improved somewhat, but his family was put heavily on the test. In 1903 both his parents were ruined by a robbery and as a result, he had nine family members to maintain. At the request of the municipal authorities of Mol, in 1907 Smits arranged an international exhibition of artists who came to paint landscapes in Mol and its surroundings. The artist Paula Van Rompa-Zenke belonged to the arranging committee. There were no less than 68 painters participating, with Germans, Dutch, and Americans coming to Mol. The term Molse School was born. In 1910, Smits published an album with 25 engravings, which was dedicated to Queen Elisabeth. In 1912, the young Dirk Baksteen became a student of Smits. In 1914, Smits stopped his production of art work. He became President of the Comit√© voor hulpverlening en voedselvoorziening van het canton Mol (E: Committee for assistance and food supplies of the canton Mol). After World War I he continued his work with a totally new vision and style as an engraver and painter. As from 1923 his health deteriorated. Smits suffered from a painful cancer of his jaw. Death and legacy On 15 February 1928 he died of a heart disease and he was buried on the church court of Achterbos (Mol). On his sepulchre stands a bronze Mother and Child of George Minne. He lies interred with some other members of the Molse School. Jakob Smits, who became a Belgian in 1902, was a knight in the Order of Leopold (1903), Officer in the Order of the Crown (1919) and Commander in the Order of the Crown (1927). His wife Josine survived him 28 years and after her death in 1956 the Malvinahof was sold. In 1977, in the converted old parish of Mol-Sluis the municipal Jakob Smits Museum was opened.

He officially opened the academy on 20 November 1906. Originally located on the royal yacht Maha Chakri and some other boats donated by the king, the academy later moved to Wang Derm Palace in Thonburi (in the compound of the present headquarters of the Royal Thai Navy), then to Sattahip, and finally to its current location in Samut Prakan in 1952. The academy is served by Royal Thai Naval Academy BTS station.  Mission  The mission of the RTNA is to train officers for the Royal Thai Navy and Royal Thai Marine Corps.  Curriculum  The RTNA provides undergraduate programs in engineering and science, combined with naval professional training. Cadets can major in electrical engineering, marine engineering, hydrographic engineering, and management science and are trained as engineers, navigators, and marines.  Graduation  Cadets graduate with a bachelor's degree in engineering or science and are commissioned in the Royal Thai Navy with the rank of ensign (sub-lieutenant). Together with graduates of the other armed forces and police academies they receive their swords from the king personally or the king's representative.  Education of Thai naval officers  Thailand cadet, who have visited by a friendly exchange program, is looking around museum in Naval Academy in Jin-hae Those who want to enter the academy first have to pass the entrance exam, after which they join a two-year preparatory program at the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School where they study together with army, air force, and police cadets. On successful completion, they enter the Royal Thai Naval Academy. After graduation, they attend a further one-year advanced course at Sattahip that leads to a graduate diploma in naval science. On completion of this course, they are ready to work as officers in the Royal Thai Navy and Royal Thai Marine Corps.

The HDRT contested the 1968 Hardie-Ferodo 500 endurance race at the Mount Panorama Circuit, Bathurst, as well as the 1968 London-Sydney Marathon using GMH's latest car, the Holden HK Monaro. Although short-lived, this team was significant as the precursor to a permanent Holden Dealer Team set up the following year which then played a dominant role in Australian touring car racing over the next two decades. 1968 London‚ÄìSydney Marathon In early 1968, the Holden Dealer Racing Team was set up by David McKay, who already ran the Scuderia Veloce race team in various forms of motor sport in Australia. A motoring journalist with Sydney's Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph newspapers (both of which were owned by Sir Frank Packer), McKay learned of the upcoming London‚ÄìSydney Marathon which was sponsored by race organiser Sir Max Aitken and his UK newspaper, the Daily Express. The marathon would begin on 24 November in Crystal Palace in London, and finish on 18 December at the Warwick Farm Raceway in Sydney. McKay convinced his own editor David McNicoll and Telegraph owner Packer to get involved in the event, which they did with co-sponsorship (it reportedly took less than 5 minutes to convince the astute Packer). McKay also convinced GMH to get involved by supplying him with three of the yet to be released Holden Monaros in which to run in the event. Contrary to popular belief at the time, the Monaros were actually prepared for the 7,000 mi Marathon that would travel through eleven countries by GMH under the supervision of its Sales Director John Bagshaw and chief engineer Bill Steinhagen, and not by Scuderia Veloce. Also, the cars would not be entered under the name of Scuderia Veloce or the Holden Dealer Racing Team, but instead were entered in the event under the name of their major sponsor, The Sydney Telegraph, with the words \\"Sydney Telegraph Racing\\" prominently painted on the side of the cars. While the team did not feature strongly in the results due to mechanical woes, the team's second car driven by leading Australian Rally Championship driver Barry Ferguson finished 12th outright, while the 3rd car driven by triple Australian Grand Prix winner Doug Whiteford finished 14th. The Monaro driven by team leader David McKay failed to finish the marathon. McKay's Monaro was rolled over while competing a rally section near Broken Hill, NSW, hospitalising one of the crew. This disqualified it from the rally. A new windscreen was fitted and was driven straight to Sydney allowing McKay to watch the finish. 1968 Hardie-Ferodo 500 Paul Hawkins and Bill Brown pictured at Sydney Motorsport Park in 2013. The day following the official launch of the Monaro on the Gold Coast, prominent Melbourne based Holden dealer and former racer Bill Patterson reportedly asked McKay (who was on the Gold Coast covering the cars launch) what it would cost to run three of the new Holden Monaro GTS327s in the 1968 Hardie-Ferodo 500 at Mount Panorama for Group E Series Production Touring Cars. This led to an agreement being reached where McKay's Scuderia Veloce team, under the name Holden Dealer Racing Team, would run three Monaros which were separately financed by three different Holden dealers, Patterson Motors (Victoria), Midway Motors (Queensland) and Sutton Motors (NSW), with each dealer named on all three cars. The Monaros (not, as rumor had it, the London-Sydney cars) were delivered to the teams base in Wahroonga on Sydney's Upper North Shore where they were prepared by Scuderia Veloce chief mechanic Bob Atkins. Car #23D was driven by international sports car and Formula One racer Paul Hawkins and Bill Brown, #24D was driven by New Zealander Jim Palmer (a Tasman Series regular) and Phil West, while car #25D was driven by 1964 Armstrong 500 winner George Reynolds and veteran touring and sports car driver Brian Muir. The race was won by the privately entered Monaro of Bruce McPhee and Barry Mulholland. The Palmer/West Monaro finished second outright, with the Muir/Reynolds car in fifth, while the Hawkins/Brown car was disqualified for receiving outside assistance after breaking a wheel in The Cutting. Palmer and West had actually finished 3rd on the road, but the 2nd placed Des West / Ron Marks Monaro was disqualified in post-race scrutineering, lifting the HDRT car to second place. It was not until the 1969 Datsun Three Hour at Sandown that a permanent Holden Dealer Team, managed by Harry Firth, had its first outing. None of the six Holden Dealer Racing Team drivers from 1968, nor David McKay or Scuderia Veloce were involved in Firth's 1969 Holden Dealer Team campaign.

Method Optimization techniques based on static program analysis of the source code consider code performance improvements without actually executing the program. No dynamic program analysis is performed. The analysis may even consider code within loops including the number of times the loop will execute, for example in loop unrolling. In the absence of all the run time information, static program analysis can not take into account how frequently that code section is actually executed. The first high-level compiler, introduced as the Fortran Automatic Coding System in 1957, broke the code into blocks and devised a table of the frequency each block is executed via a simulated execution of the code in a Monte Carlo fashion in which the outcome of conditional transfers (as via \`IF\`-type statements) is determined by a random number generator suitably weighted by whatever \`FREQUENCY\` statements were provided by the programmer.J. W. Backus, R. J. Beeber, et al., The Fortran Automatic Coding System, Proceedings of the Western Joint Computer Conference, February 1957, p. 195 Rather than programmer-supplied frequency information, profile-guided optimization uses the results of profiling test runs of the instrumented program to optimize the final generated code. The compiler is used to access data from a sample run of the program across a representative input set. The results indicate which areas of the program are executed more frequently, and which areas are executed less frequently. All optimizations benefit from profile-guided feedback because they are less reliant on heuristics when making compilation decisions. The caveat, however, is that the sample of data fed to the program during the profiling stage must be statistically representative of the typical usage scenarios; otherwise, profile-guided feedback has the potential to harm the overall performance of the final build instead of improving it. Just-in-time compilation can make use of runtime information to dynamically recompile parts of the executed code to generate a more efficient native code. If the dynamic profile changes during execution, it can deoptimize the previous native code, and generate a new code optimized with the information from the new profile. Adoption There is support for building Firefox using PGO.Building with Profile-Guided Optimization, mozilla.org, 13 August 2013 Even though PGO is effective, it has not been widely adopted by software projects, due to its tedious dual-compilation model. It is also possible to perform PGO without instrumentation by collecting a profile using hardware performance counters.Dehao Chen (2010), \\"Taming hardware event samples for fdo compilation\\", Proceedings of the 8th annual IEEE/ACM international symposium on Code generation and optimization, pp. 42‚Äì52. This sampling-based approach has a much lower overhead and does not require a special compilation. The HotSpot Java virtual machine (JVM) uses profile-guided optimization to dynamically generate native code. As a consequence, a software binary is optimized for the actual load it is receiving. If the load changes, adaptive optimization can dynamically recompile the running software to optimize it for the new load. This means that all software executed on the HotSpot JVM effectively make use of profile- guided optimization. PGO has been adopted in the Microsoft Windows version of Google Chrome. PGO was enabled in the 64-bit edition of Chrome starting with version 53 and version 54 for the 32-bit edition. Implementations Examples of compilers that implement PGO are: * Intel C++ Compiler and Fortran compilers * GNU Compiler Collection compilers * Oracle Solaris Studio (formerly called Sun Studio) * Microsoft Visual C++ compiler * Clang * IBM XL C/C++ See also * Adaptive optimization * Dynamic dead code elimination * Global optimization * Hot spot (computer programming) * Interprocedural optimization ** Link-time optimization (LTO) * Tracing just-in-time compilation References Category:Compiler optimizations ","title":"Profile-guided optimization"},{"id":"20038233","text":"Khodro Kaveer is an automobile company based in Yazd, Iran.

In Wellington, close to the epicenter, shaking lasted for at least 50 seconds. The moment magnitude of the earthquake has been estimated as 8.2, the most powerful recorded in New Zealand since systematic European colonisation began in 1840.M 8.2 Wairarapa Tue, Jan 23 1855. GeoNet. This earthquake was associated with the largest observed movement on a strike-slip fault, maximum . It has been suggested that the surface rupture formed by this event helped influence Charles Lyell to link earthquakes with rapid movement on faults.Sibson, R.H. (2006). \\"Charles Lyell and the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake in New Zealand: Recognition of fault rupture accompanying an earthquake\\". Seismological Research Letters. 77 (3): 358‚Äì363. Tectonic setting New Zealand lies along the boundary between the Australian and Pacific Plates. In the South Island most of the relative displacement between these plates is taken up along a single dextral (right lateral) strike-slip fault with a major reverse component, the Alpine Fault. In the North Island the displacement is mainly taken up along the Kermadec subduction zone, although the remaining dextral strike-slip component of the relative plate motion is accommodated by the North Island Fault System (NIFS).Mouslopoulou, V., Nicol, A., Little, T.A. & Walsh, J.J. (2007). \\"Terminations of large strike-slip faults: an alternative model from New Zealand\\". In: Cunningham, W.D. & Mann, P (eds). Tectonics of Strike-Slip Restraining and Releasing Bends.

A group of dextral strike- slip structures, known as the Marlborough Fault System, transfer displacement between the mainly transform and convergent type plate boundaries in a complex zone at the northern end of the South Island.Van Dissen, R. & Yeats, R.S. (1991). \\"Hope Fault, Jordan Thrust, and uplift of the Seaward Kaikoura Range, New Zealand\\". Geology, 19, 393‚Äì396. The earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault which is part of the NIFS. Earthquake characteristics 300 px The earthquake was associated with the rupturing of approximately of the Wairarapa Fault. A horizontal displacement of up to was accompanied by uplift and tilting of the Rimutaka Range on the northwestern side of the fault with vertical offsets of about 6 metres near the fault reducing to almost nothing on the western coast of the Wellington Peninsula. The estimated magnitude of about 8.2 is unusually large for an earthquake associated with movement on a mainly strike-slip fault, and the coseismic offset would have been the largest known for such an event. It has been suggested that this was caused by the rupture propagating down to where the fault links through to the top of the subducting Pacific Plate. Geomorphological evidence, particularly the uplifted beach ridges observed at Turakirae Head, appears to record three previous coseismic uplifts of the Rimutaka Range caused by earthquakes similar in magnitude to the 1855 event, with a recurrence interval of about 2200 years. Damage Wellington experienced severe shaking but the resulting damage was reduced as the city had been extensively rebuilt following the 1848 Marlborough earthquake using mainly wooden structures; only one recorded fatality (in a brick building) occurred.\\"The Earthquake of 1855\\", Early Wellington, 1928, Louis E. Ward Reports identify at least another four people (possibly as many as eight) as having died in the surrounding countryside during the earthquake. Numerous landslides were reported along the slopes of the Rimutaka Range. Minor damage was recorded in places as far away as Lyttelton and Christchurch. The uplift of the northwestern side of Wellington Harbour rendered many of the jetties in the harbour unusable, although this new area of land provided a new rail and road route to the north. Much of modern Wellington's central business district is formed from land raised from the harbour by the event, as shown by the series of \\"Shoreline 1840\\" plaques.

At the conclusion of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, the Geelong City Council held a dinner on 15 January 1957 to honour the six Geelong Guild athletes (Ron Blackney, John Chittick, Robert James \\"Bob\\" Joyce, John Landy, Don MacMillan and John Vernon) who had represented Geelong and Australia at these games. During the dinner, where most of the neighbouring cities and shires were represented, John Landy made a speech on behalf of the honoured athletes, in which Landy compared overseas facilities available to athletes to those of Australia. Geelong, at that stage, had no dedicated athletic field of any kind. To confirm a proper management structure of Landy Field (Riverside Reserve) the Geelong City Council entered into an agreement with the Geelong Guild Athletic Club Trustees: Bervin E. Purnell, president; Rudi Hochreiter Snr, secretary;Wal Whiteside, construction engineer; and Charles Harding, committee member).

Paton was born into a family that had founded the civil engineering firms of Easton, Gibb & Son and Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners and he would spend his entire professional career working for the latter. Following his graduation from University College London one of his first jobs was the construction of a dam in Maentwrog in Wales. Paton later became an expert on dams and much of his career was devoted to their construction. In 1931 he undertook an economic survey of Canada which recommended a programme of works for its port system. This report was still being used into the 1970s. During the Second World War Paton was involved with the construction of gun emplacements in the Dardanelles, Turkey and of caissons for the Mulberry Harbours used after the Invasion of Normandy. After the Second World War, Paton undertook an economic survey of Syria, which made recommendations for port, water infrastructure, irrigation and hydroelectric improvements. This was followed by a similar report on Lebanon and one on the possibility of extending railways from Northern Rhodesia to neighbouring countries. From 1946, Paton worked almost exclusively on hydroelectric projects, beginning with the Owen Falls Hydroelectric Scheme in Uganda. He also worked on the Kariba Dam in Zambia and Zimbabwe, which was the largest dam in the world when built and for which he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He was also involved with the Indus Basin Project, the Aswan High Dam, the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam, the P.K. Le Roux Dam, the Spioenkop Dam and the Tarbela Dam. Paton was knighted in 1973 and retired in 1977, remaining a senior consultant to Gibb and Partners. He spent his retirement in Jersey, where he died at St Helier on 7 April 1999. Paton was dedicated to his professional career and served as President of both the Institution of Civil Engineers (November 1970 ‚Äì November 1971) and the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers. Early life Angus, the name he preferred, was born on the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands on 10 May 1905. p. 417 His father, Thomas Lyall Paton, was a journalist and author. His mother, Janet, was the daughter of Easton Gibb, founder of Easton, Gibb & Son, a firm of civil engineering contractors. His uncle on his mother's side, Alexander Gibb, was also a civil engineer; and had founded Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, where Paton would spend his professional career. Paton left Jersey with his family in 1909 and spent a year in England before being sent to school in Boulogne-sur-Mer in France then Lausanne in Switzerland. He returned to England at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. He spent the next six years living in St Leonards-on-Sea in Sussex where he lived next door to his future wife, Joan Delme-Murray. Paton spent four years at Brunswick preparatory school in Haywards Heath, Sussex before studying at Cheltenham College. He was a good student, which he put down to an excellent maths teacher, a good memory and being \\"not much good at games\\". On Alexander Gibb's advice Paton read for a degree in civil engineering at University College London (UCL), where he had won a scholarship at the age of 17. Whilst at UCL Paton earned half-colours for long distance running and became the only student to graduate with a first class honours Bachelor of Science degree in engineering in 1925. Work = Post-graduation = Maentwrog Dam Upon graduation Paton joined Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, which had been founded in 1922. One of his first jobs there was to assist with the design of a new jetty for Barking Power Station.. In 1927 he worked on a dam at Maentwrog in North Wales and between 1932 and 1933 was resident engineer on the Glenlee portion of the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme... Paton was seconded to the Rangoon Port Trust in 1930 to construct a wharf for the export of lead from Burma. This wharf survived a serious earthquake on 5 May 1930 and was opened on 20 February 1931. On 10 April 1931 Paton sailed to Canada to undertake a survey of its ports and outline the additional facilities that would be required in the next 25‚Äì50 years. He was assisted in this for six weeks by Ralph Freeman who had designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The report was issued on 15 January 1932 but was not implemented until 1935 with the election of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of Canada.. The report's findings continued to be in use until the 1970s. Paton was responsible for the construction of a new brewery for Guinness in Park Royal, London from October 1933 to October 1936. This was the biggest job of his career thus far and involved the construction of seven steel framed buildings, a power station, a storage silo, roads and railway sidings. Paton also built industrial and trading estates in Wales, West Cumberland and London. He was made a partner in the firm in 1938. =Second World War= A caisson from one of the Mulberry harbours During the Second World War the running of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained a large number of government contracts and within a few weeks of the start of the war in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a ¬£7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943‚Äì44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the precast concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944‚Äì45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford. =Post-war= In 1945 Paton began construction of a wool factory at Darlington and a Rayon factory at Carrickfergus, both jobs were completed in 1951. In 1946 Paton was put in charge of an economic survey of Syria which required him to traverse the country by aircraft and car. The report, issued in 1947, recommended port, water infrastructure and irrigation improvements and the construction of a hydroelectric power station on the Euphrates River. Paton undertook a similar survey in Lebanon from 1947 to 1948. He was also involved in a report on the possibility of running a railroad from Northern Rhodesia to Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Nyasaland. Owen Falls Dam under construction Paton worked extensively in the field of hydroelectric power and became regarded as a world authority on the matter. From 1946 to 1955 he worked on the Owen Falls Hydroelectric Scheme in Uganda which resulted in the complete stoppage of the White Nile for the first time in history. Following the completion of Owen Falls Dam, Paton worked on the first stage of the Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River, of which he said that it was the \\"highlight of his professional career\\". Paton made 22 visits to the site, of a total duration of 267 days. The project itself was, at 420 ft high, the largest dam built until then and, despite some of the worst floods on record hitting the project, was completed in 1960 at ¬£5 million under budget. In recognition of his work on the Kariba project Paton was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1960. As a result of the success of the Kariba project Gibb and Partners became involved with many of the biggest dam projects of the next two decades including works in Sudan, Argentina, South Africa and Pakistan. Kariba Dam Paton was later involved in the second stage of the Kariba Project and in the Aswan High Dam project.. In 1955 he became a senior partner in Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners upon the death of Alistair Gibb in a polo accident. From 1960 until 1977, when he retired, Paton was the responsible partner for the firm's involvement in the supervision of the $1.2 billion World Bank Indus Basin Project. This included the construction of the Mangla Dam between 1962 and 1968. In 1962 Gibb & Partners was one of two firms chosen (with Coyne et Bellier) by the South African government to build two dams on the Orange River. The first to be constructed was the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam which was officially opened in March 1972. The second, the P.K. Le Roux Dam, was finished in 1977.. Following the success of this project Paton was retained to build a third, smaller dam, the Spioenkop Dam, which was finished in 1972. Paton was also involved with the tunnelling and underground powerhouse for the Drakensberg Pumped Storage Scheme. Paton was retained by the World Bank once more in 1967 to supervise the construction of the Tarbela Dam in Pakistan, which was completed in 1976. He also worked on the modernisation of the Royal Mint which involved the move from its 600-year home at Tower Hill to Llantrisant in Wales in time for decimalisation in 1971. Retirement Paton retired from the firm in 1977 but worked for them again as a senior consultant between 1979 and 1985.. During this time he worked on the James Bay Project, a large hydroelectric and infrastructure development in Quebec, Canada. Paton spent the last twenty years of his life in retirement in Jersey in the Channel Islands. In his working life he had visited 48 countries and spent 3152 days abroad. During his career with Gibb and Partners he had grown the company from a 400 employee, home-based company to one which employed more than 1500 engineers working in 63 countries. He was also largely responsible for leading the trend of exporting British technical expertise around the world. Paton made an endowment to the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1986, as a result the Academy awards the Sir Angus Paton Bursary of ¬£7000 annually to a masters student. Paton married on 7 June 1933 to Joan with whom he raised two daughters and two sons. Joan died on 7 January 1964, an event which spurred him to become more involved in his profession. Paton died at St Helier in Jersey on 7 April 1999.  Personal life  Paton married Eleanor Joan Delm√©- Murray on 7 June 1933, they remained married until her death at the age of 53 in 1964. He never remarried. They had two sons together, Alan and John and two daughters Eleanor (known by her second name, Anne) and Janet Paton. He had thirteen grandchildren and, at the time of his death, six great-grandchildren. Professional recognition = Institutional and committee memberships = In addition to his busy work schedule Paton served his profession on numerous councils and committees. The first of these was as chairman of the Association of Consulting Engineers between 1949 and 1950, an association of which he was made an honorary member in 1984. Paton served on the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1954 to 1959 and again from 1961 to 1966. He was elected vice president of that institution, a position he filled from 1966 to 1970 when he was elected president.. Whilst serving as president he started New Civil Engineer magazine to keep members up to date with civil engineering news.. From 1960 to 1965 Paton was a board member of the Hydraulics Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and from 1964 to 1975 he served on the council of the Construction Industry Research and Information Association. Paton was also the British representative on the committee of the International Commission on Large Dams between 1966 and 1973. From 1968 to 1970 he was chairman of the National Economic Development Council's working party on large industrial construction sites and from 1969 to 1974 was a member of the Natural Environment Research Council. Paton was vice-chairman of the Council of Engineering Institutions from 1971 to 1972 and chairman for 1972 to 1973. From 1974 to 1979 he was chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food flood protection research committee. Paton was also a member emeritus of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers and served as their president in 1980.. =Other honours= Paton was awarded many honours for his contributions to civil engineering. In 1952 he was made an honorary fellow of University College London and he was also a fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers and the American Society of Civil Engineers. Paton was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1969 and served as one of its vice-presidents for the 1977‚Äì78 session. Paton became one of the few practising engineers to have held that post. He was created a knight bachelor in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1973 in recognition of his services to the construction industry. This knighthood was personally conferred upon him by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 November 1973. In 1976 Paton became a founding member of the Fellowship of Engineering and received an honorary Doctorate of Science (DSc) in engineering from the University of London in 1977. In 1978 he was made an honorary fellow of Imperial College London and received another honorary DSc in engineering from Bristol University.

D. Eastman. The book is based on a short story by Palmer's husband Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), \\"Gustav, the Goldfish\\", which was published with his own illustrations in Redbook magazine in June 1950. Plot The story is about a boy who buys a fish, named Otto, from a pet store. The store owner, Mr. Carp, gives the boy instructions on how to care for the fish, including strict feeding instructions: \\"Never feed him a lot. Just so much, and no more! Never more than a spot! Or something may happen. You never know what.\\" When the boy inadvertently disobeys these instructions out of compassion for his new pet, Otto begins to grow uncontrollably, quickly outgrowing his fishbowl. This leads the boy to move him into a series of successively larger containers, ending with the bathtub. When Otto outgrows the tub, the house begins to flood. The boy then requests help from a police officer and the fire department, who help him take Otto down to the local pool. There, they drop the fish in, causing it to expand to the size of the pool and scare off all of the swimmers. Since Otto keeps on growing, the boy calls Mr. Carp. He is not surprised, as boys always ignore his feeding instructions. When Mr. Carp arrives, he dives into the pool and pulls Otto below. Eventually, he emerges with the fish, back to its normal size. He refuses to say how he did it, but tells the boy to never overfeed Otto again, and the boy takes his advice to heart.  Background  \\"Gustav, the Goldfish\\", the short story that served as the basis for this book, was written and illustrated by Dr. Seuss and published in the June 1950 edition of Redbook magazine as the first installment in his series of children's stories for Redbook. This story has much in common with A Fish Out of Water, including its plot and characters. However, the goldfish's name is Gustav instead of Otto, and the pet shop owner's name is Mr. VanBuss instead of Mr. Carp. The original story was collected, along with six other Dr. Seuss stories originally published in magazines, in the 2011 collection The Bippolo Seed and Other Lost Stories. In 1959, in a letter to his wife, he gave her formal permission to write a book for the Beginner Books series based on his original story, writing, \\"You have the right to use any of the situations or any of the words from the original story that your little heart desires. You must, however, comply with all necessary steps in protecting my original copyright.\\" Palmer's work involved, in part, rewriting and simplifying the original text to comply with Beginner Books' policies. She finished A Fish Out of Water in 1961, at the Hotel Madison in New York City where she and her husband were staying for six weeks while their home in La Jolla, California, was being remodeled. She had apparently been working at it steadily, as she jokingly described this last revision as \\"the 9,373th version\\" of the book.

The First Peace of Prenzlau ended a war fought between 1445 and 1448,Landesgeschichtliche Vereinigung f√ºr die Mark Brandenburg, Jahrbuch f√ºr brandenburgische Landesgeschichte, 1983, p.98 while the Second Peace of Prenzlau ended a war fought between 1466 and 1468. In older documents, Prenzlau may be spelled Prenzlow, which was the common spelling during the time period the treaties were drawn and was only changed during the 19th century. Prenzlau is situated in the center of Uckermark. First Peace of Prenzlau (1448) After a series of conflicts, the Brandenburgian margraves and the Pomeranian dukes partitioned the Uckermark with the Treaty of Prenzlau (1448). The southern parts should belong to Brandenburg, while the northern parts stayed with Pomerania. The northern parts were to be inherited by Brandenburg in case the House of Pomerania would extinct. The peace treaty was prepared already in 1447 and signed on May 3, 1448.Wolf-Dieter Mohrmann, Der Landfriede im Ostseeraum w√§hrend des sp√§ten Mittelalters, Lassleben, 1972, p.285, , Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.181, , Second Peace of Prenzlau (1472, 1479) War started again when Stettin (Szczecin) refused to hail the Brandenburgian margraves, which it was supposed to following the Treaty of Soldin (1466). Brandenburg responded by attacking the Pomeranian duchy and advanced deep into Pomerania-Stettin, which before the war included the Uckermark. Most of the fighting in this war was ended by a truce, the treaty of Prenzlau (1468): Brandenburg thereby kept the southern Uckermark gained in the course of the war from Pomerania. The truce concluded in September 1468 was prolonged in 1469 in Petrikau.Stephanie Irrgang, Peregrinatio Academica: Wanderungen und Karrieren von Gelehrten der Universit√§ten Rostock, Greifswald, Trier und Mainz im 15. Jahrhundert, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2002, p.97, , The Second Treaty of Prenzlau (1472) was a peace treaty signed on May 31, 1472 between Albert III, Elector of Brandenburg, and the Dukes of Pomerania. Based on the terms of the accord, the dukes Eric II and Wartislaw X surrendered the Duchy of Pomerania-Stettin to Albert III, with the Uckermark becoming an integral part of Brandenburg and the remainder of Pomerania-Stettin becoming a Brandenburgian vassal. This accord was confirmed by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III in 1473.Ingo Materna, Wolfgang Ribbe, Kurt Adamy, Brandenburgische Geschichte, Akademie Verlag, 1995, p.206, , Frank-Lothar Kroll, Preu√üens Herrscher: Von den ersten Hohenzollern bis Wilhelm II., Beck, 2006, p.45, , A third treaty of Prenzlau (1479) confirmed the 1472 one.

Lake villages existed there in prehistoric times. During medieval times it was an important fishery, but following extensive drainage works it had disappeared from maps in the eighteenth century. Location Meare Pool was formed by water ponding-up behind the raised peat bogs between the Wedmore and the Polden Hills, and core samples have shown that it is filled with at least of detritus mud, especially in the Subatlantic climatic period (1st millennium BC). Meare Pool was located on low-lying levels just north of Meare. Its precise boundaries varied according to season, and, over the longer term, as efforts were made to drain the area. Early 16th century surveys variously describe it as being up to a mile and a half wide and having a circumference of between 2.5 and 5 miles. The south end was bordered by the high ground that the village of Meare is built upon. The pond would have extended no further west than the current Westhay to Wedmore road, where a shelf of rock formed a natural boundary. To the north lies the Godney ridge. The eastern extent is harder to determine, and it may have gone as far as the site of the Glastonbury Lake Village. Prehistory In prehistoric times there were two Meare Lake Villages situated within the lake, occupied at different times between 300 BCE and 100 CE, similar to the nearby Glastonbury Lake Village. The Meare villages were discovered in 1895 but excavation did not start until 1908. More recent studies have shown that the villages were formed by laying dried clay over the Sphagnum Moss of the bog. The pool at that time was at least long by wide. Fishery Meare Fish House In the Domesday book of 1086 the village of Meare is recorded as supporting \\"10 fishermen and 3 fisheries paying 20 pence\\". At the time of the Dissolution in 1540, Meare Pool was said to contain a great abundance of pike, tench, roach and eels. In 1638 it was owned by William Freake, who described it as \\"lately a fish pool\\". In the 14th century a Fish House was built at Meare for the chief fisherman of the Abbot of Glastonbury that was also used for salting and preparing fish. It is the only surviving monastic fishery building in England. The importance of this industry is illustrated by a series of acrimonious disputes between Glastonbury and the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral. The Abbey required fish on Fridays, fast days and during Lent. As many as 5000 eels were landed in a typical year. There were also three fishponds which would have allowed fish to have been bred or stored. Drainage In early times the Meare Pool collected the waters of the rivers Brue and Sheppey, and discharged in a northerly direction into the Lower River Axe. In the later years of the 12th century the Abbey diverted the Brue to flow westwards, perhaps largely through natural channels, from Meare Pool to join the river Parrett. Further reclamation was carried out in stages between about 1620 and 1740, with the \\"new Cutts\\" (or Decoy Rhyne) being built about 1660. The rivers Sheppey and Hartlake were canalised into the River James Wear and Division Rhyne sometime in the late 1730s. Early drainage work was carried out in the later years of the 12th century, with the responsibility for maintaining all the watercourses between Glastonbury and the sea being placed on named individuals among whom were Ralph de Sancta Barbara of Brentmarsh. Drainage of the surrounding area by monks of Glastonbury Abbey had reduced the size of the lake to at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Meare Pool had disappeared from maps by 1749. Legacy Current Ordnance Survey maps show Meare Pool as a placename in an area with spot heights of 4m. The 14th century fish house has been designated as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument and is now in the care of English Heritage. In World War II a pillbox was located at Meare Pool at the confluence of the Decoy Rhyne and Whitelake River.

This strength helped persuade King Peter II of Portugal to sever his alliance with France and Bourbon-controlled Spain, and ally himself with the Grand Alliance in 1703 as the Alliance fleets could campaign in the Mediterranean using access to the port of Lisbon and conduct operations in support of the Austrian Habsburg candidate to the Spanish throne, the Archduke Charles, known to his supporters as of Spain. Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt represented the Habsburg cause in the region. In May 1704 the Prince and Admiral George Rooke, commander of the main Grand Alliance fleet, failed to take Barcelona in the name of Rooke subsequently evaded pressure from his allies to make another attempt on C√°diz. In order to compensate for their lack of success the Alliance commanders resolved to capture Gibraltar, a small town on the southern Spanish coast. Following a heavy bombardment the town was invaded by English and Dutch marines and sailors. The governor, Diego de Salinas, agreed to surrender Gibraltar and its small garrison on 4 August. Three days later Prince George entered the town with Austrian and Spanish Habsburg troops in the name of of Spain. The Grand Alliance failed in its objective of replacing Philip V with as King of Spain, but in the peace negotiations Gibraltar was ceded to Britain. Background At the start of the War of the Spanish Succession Portugal was nominally an ally of the Bourbons: France under Louis XIV, and Spain under his grandson, Philip V. Although not a belligerent, Portugal's harbours were closed to the enemies of the Bourbon powers ‚Äì principally the vessels of England and the Dutch Republic. However, following the Anglo-Dutch naval victory at Vigo Bay in 1702 the balance of naval forces had swung in favour of the Grand Alliance. Having now the ability to cut off Portugal's food supplies and trade (particularly gold from Brazil) it was not hard for the Allied diplomats to induce King Peter II to sign the Methuen Treaties of May 1703 and join the Alliance.Bromley: The New Cambridge Modern History VI: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia 1688‚Äì1725, 418 Once had committed himself to war the Alliance fleets gained access to Portugal's harbours, in particular the port of Lisbon. In return for his allegiance had demanded military and financial aid and territorial concessions in Spain; he had also asked that the Alliance send to Lisbon Emperor Leopold I's younger son, Charles ‚Äì the Alliance's Habsburg candidate to the Spanish throne ‚Äì to demonstrate the earnestness of their support. Known to his supporters as of Spain, the young pretender arrived in Lisbon ‚Äì via London ‚Äì with George Rooke's fleet on 7 March 1704, amid great celebrations.Kamen: of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice, 33 Apart from the failed Grand Alliance attempt to take C√°diz in 1702, and the subsequent attack on the Spanish treasure fleet in Vigo Bay, the war had thus far been limited to the Low Countries and Italy. With Portugal's change of allegiance, however, the war moved towards Spain. In May 1704 the court at Lisbon received news that French and Spanish troops had crossed the frontier into Portugal. This army of approximately 26,000 men under and the Duke of Berwick scored several victories on the border: Salvaterra fell on 8 May, Penha Garcia on 11 May, personally oversaw the fall of Castelo Branco on 23 May, and T'Serclaes captured Portalegre on 8 June.Lynn: The Wars of 1667‚Äì1714, 295‚Äì96 But without supply for their forces, the coming summer heat made it impossible for them to continue with the campaign, and returned to Madrid on 16 July to a hero's welcome. However, the heat did not affect the war at sea where the Alliance was in a position of strength.Kamen: of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice, 38 Prelude Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt (1670‚Äì1705). Prince George was the Imperial representative in the Iberian Peninsula and the nominal commander of the Anglo-Dutch forces. Using Lisbon as an improvised forward base Admiral Rooke's Anglo-Dutch fleet ventured into the Mediterranean Sea in May 1704. After seeing the Levant trading fleet safely through the Strait of Gibraltar Rooke headed towards Nice to put himself in touch with Victor , Duke of Savoy. The Grand Alliance had planned for a naval attack upon the French base at Toulon in conjunction with the Savoyard army and the rebels of the C√©vennes; but with Amadeus busy defending his capital Turin from French forces, the Toulon expedition was abandoned and Rooke sailed for the Catalan capital, Barcelona.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 405 Accompanying Rooke was Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt who had enjoyed popularity amongst the Catalans as their governor at the end of the Nine Years' War. The Prince was the great exponent of the Barcelona plan; he had been in touch with the dissidents within Catalonia and counted on the appearance of the fleet to encourage a rising in favour of Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702‚Äì1713, 104 On 30 May, under cover of the ships‚Äô guns, Prince George landed with 1,200 English and 400 Dutch marines; but the governor of Barcelona, Don Francisco de Velasco, had managed to keep the city's disaffected elements quiet and partisans on the alert. Moreover, the dissidents were incensed by the size of the Alliance force and had expected the personal appearance of Stanhope: History of the War of the Succession in Spain, 97. Velasco had been governor of Catalonia in 1697 at the time of the French siege, and had lately been reappointed. Ultimatums for Velesco to surrender on pain of bombardment were ignored, and the plans for an insurrection from within the city's walls failed to materialize. Rooke, fearing an attack from a French squadron, was impatient for departure. Prince George could do little more than order his local followers ‚Äì a thousand in all ‚Äì to disperse to their homes. The marines embarked on 1 June without loss.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702‚Äì1713, 107 Meanwhile, the comte de Toulouse, one of illegitimate sons, was sailing towards the Straits with the fleet from Brest. News from Lisbon of the French manoeuvres reached Rooke on 5 June. Determined to prevent the junction of the Toulon and Brest fleets Rooke decided to risk a battle. However, owing to the foul bottoms of the Anglo- Dutch ships the swifter French fleet escaped Rooke's pursuit and arrived safely in Toulon; thenceforth, Toulouse became the commander of the enlarged French fleet, now known as the Grand Fleet of France. Rooke could not venture within range of the Toulon forts nor risk attack from a superior force so far from any port of refuge. He therefore turned back towards the Straits where the arrival of an English squadron under Cloudesley Shovell had put the Allies on a numerical parity with the French.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 406 Rooke met Shovell on 27 June off Lagos. and sent word from Lisbon that they now wished another attempt to be made on C√°diz.Le Fevre & Harding: Precursors of Nelson: British Admirals of the Eighteenth Century, 68 Methuen believed the place to be ungarrisoned and easy to take, but the admirals in the fleet remained sceptical,Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702‚Äì1713, 109. A naval reconnaissance confirmed Rooke‚Äôs opinion about the supposed weakness of the port‚Äôs defences. especially when considering that they were not on this occasion carrying a force comparable to the failed attempt there two years earlier. C√°diz, however, was not the only potential target. As the Alliance fleet lay off Tetuan on the Barbary Coast, a council of war aboard Rooke's flagship discussed the need to please the two kings and save their own reputations. On 28 July the Alliance commanders considered the proposal of Prince George, now commander-in-chief of Alliance forces in the peninsula, for an attack on Gibraltar.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702‚Äì1713, 109 The idea of attacking Gibraltar was old and widely spread. The ‚ÄòRock‚Äô had caught the attention of Oliver Cromwell, and later William III's and Queen Anne‚Äôs ministers had marked it for England. The Moors had previously shown interest in the Rock and fortified it with a castle whose ruins still remained. Emperor Charles V had added many other works; but its immediate operational benefit was negligible.Stanhope: History of the War of the Succession in Spain, 98 Gibraltar had little trade and its anchorage was unprotected ‚Äì there was no question, at this time, of basing a fleet there.Roger: The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649‚Äì1815, 169 Gibraltar was finally selected for its strategic value, weak garrison and to encourage the rejection of Philip V (the Bourbon Claimant) in favour of Charles III (the Habsburg claimant). Battle Attack on Gibraltar 1‚Äì3 August 1704. Prince George of Hesse entered the town on 6 August in the name of but effective control remained with the English.Kamen: of Spain: The King who Reigned Twice. 39 The Grand Alliance fleet crossed from Tetuan on 30 July; by 1 August Rooke, flying his flag in the Second Rate Royal Katherine, stood at the entrance to the bay while Admiral George Byng‚Äôs squadron (16 English under Byng and six Dutch ships under Rear Admiral Paulus van der Dussen) anchored inside, ranging themselves within the line of defences from the Old to the New Mole. The council of war had decided that Prince George would land with 1,800 English and Dutch marines on the isthmus under cover of a naval bombardment. The marines landed at the head of the bay, and met with no resistance except for a small body of cavalry. They cut off Gibraltar from the mainland while the enemy on the nearby hills were dispersed by fire from two ships sent to the east of the rock.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702‚Äì1713, 110 Prince George summoned the governor, Don Diego de Salinas, to surrender in the name of . He refused, and the garrison pledged its allegiance to . Although the governor was determined to resist he knew he did not have the means to do so: his earlier requests for reinforcements and military stores had always been in vain.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 410 By his own account, Don Diego had ‚Äòno more than fifty-six men of whom there were not thirty in service‚Äô and could count on a few hundred civilian militia ‚Äòof such bad quality that before they [the Allied fleet] arrived they began to run away.‚Äô In addition, he had 100 cannon of various kinds but few were in a state to be fired, and fewer still had gunners to fire them. 2 August passed in preliminaries. Don Diego, who in Trevelyan's words was prepared to ‚Äòdie like a gentleman‚Äô, sent back his defiant reply to the summons to surrender. Byng's squadron warped themselves in along the sea front as close as the depth permitted and Captain Jumper brought the Lenox within actual musket range of the New Mole. These operations were carried out in a dead calm, and were not impeded by a few shots from the Spanish batteries. At midnight Captain Edward Whitaker of the Dorsetshire led a party against a French privateer anchored at the Old Mole which had been firing at the marines on the isthmus. Admiral George Rooke (1650‚Äì1709) by Michael Dahl About 05:00 the following day, 3 August, Byng's squadron of 22 ships fired in earnest on the crumbling walls and forts.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 411 Tens of thousands of shells were fired in the attack. The actual damage done was small in proportion to the expenditure of the shot, but in view of the possible approach of the French fleet the job had to be done quickly or not at all. Captain Whitaker acted as Byng's aide-de-camp, carrying his instructions from ship to ship, including the final order to cease firing six hours after they had begun. As the smoke lifted Captain Jumper at the southern end of the line could discern the New Mole and the fort that commanded its abutment on the land. The defenders of the fort appeared to have fled, and Whitaker and Jumper agreed that a landing could be effected there unopposed. Rooke granted the request to attack, and a flotilla of row-boats raced for the New Mole. =Landing= As the Grand Alliance prepared for their assault the priests, women, and children who had taken refuge at the chapel of Europa Point at southern end of the peninsula, began to return to their homes in the town. An English ship fired a warning shot in front of the civilian column forcing them back out of harm's way, but the shot was mistaken by the rest of the fleet as a signal to resume fire, and the bombardment began again. Under cover of the guns the landing party did its work. The foremost sailors clambered into the breached and undefended fort at the New Mole; however, by accident or design the magazine at the fort blew up. Some of the landing party carried lighted gun-matches and, according to Trevelyan, had forgotten the possibility of a powder-magazine. Whatever the cause of the explosion the Alliance suffered between 100‚Äì200 casualties.Stanhope puts the figure at 40 dead and 60 wounded: Trevelyan states 200 casualties: Francis states that 40 sailors were killed and 'a few Spaniards'. A momentary panic ensued, for the survivors suspected an enemy-laid trap had caused the disaster. There was a rush for the boats, but at this critical moment Captain Whitaker arrived with reinforcements. The landing was supported by a number of Catalan volunteers, for whom one of Gibraltar's main spots, Catalan Bay, bears its name.Bronchud, Miguel (2007). The Secret Castle: The Key to Good and Evil. DigitalPulp Publishing.com, p.112. Within a few minutes the attackers had rallied and proceeded north along the deserted ramparts of the seafront towards Gibraltar. On arriving near southern wall of the town, Whitaker halted the sailors and hoisted the Union Flag in a bastion on the shore.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 412. The Union Flag had been in frequent use since the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland in 1603. Byng now came ashore with several hundred more seamen. Thus was the town invested by Byng in the south, as well as on its stronger northern side where the marines had landed with Prince George. Meanwhile, the party of the women and children stranded at Europa Point had been captured by English sailors. Rooke had given orders that the prisoners were not to be ill-treated, but the desire to recover these women was a further inducement for the defenders to end their resistance.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702‚Äì1713, 111 On 4 August, seeing all was lost, Don Diego agreed to terms that guaranteed the lives and property of those committed to his care. Under the capitulation French subjects were taken prisoner, while any Spaniard who would take an oath of allegiance to as King of Spain could remain in the town with religion and property guaranteed.

Officers tried to maintain control but (as had happened two years previously in the raid on C√°diz) discipline broke down and the menOne has but to read the books left to us by the sailors to realize the peculiar horror of the life between-decks. Cooped up there, like sardines in a tin, were several hundreds of men, gathered by force and kept together by brutality. A lower-deck was the home of every vice, every baseness and every misery ran amok.But some of the sailors, before they could be recalled to their ships broke loose in the town and plundered the inhabitants There were numerous incidents of rape, all Catholic churches but one (the Parish Church of St. Mary the Crowned, now the Cathedral) were desecrated or converted into military storehouses, and religious symbols such as the statue of Our Lady of Europe were damaged and destroyed. Angry Spanish inhabitants took violent reprisals against the occupiers. English and Dutch soldiers and sailors were attacked and killed, and their bodies were thrown into wells and cesspits.Jackson, p. 99. After order was restored,\\"Great disorders\\", he found, \\"had been committed by the boats crews that came on shore and marines; but the General Officers took great care to prevent them, by continually patrolling with their sergeants, and sending them on board their ships and punishing the marinesa few of them hanged as rioters after the sacking. One Englishman had to throw dice with a Dutchman to determine who should hang pour encourager les autres. They stood under the gallows and diced on a drum. The Englishman threw nine to the Dutchman's ten, and suffered execution before his mates. despite the surrender agreement promising property and religious rights, Article V promised freedom of religion and full civil rights most of the population left with the garrison on 7 August citing loyalty to Philip.Letter Of The Authorities To King Philip V. 115 Sire, The loyalty with which this city has served all the preceding kings, as well as your Majesty, has ever been notorious to them. In this last event, not less than on other occasions, it has endeavoured to exhibit its fidelity at the price of lives and property, which many of the inhabitants have lost in the combat; and with great honour and pleasure did they sacrifice themselves in defence of your Majesty, who may rest well assured that we who have survived (for our misfortune), had we experienced a similar fate, would have died with glory, and would not now suffer the great grief and distress of seeing your Majesty, our lord and master, dispossessed of so loyal a city. Subjects, but courageous as such, we will submit to no other government than that of your Catholic Majesty, in whose defence and service we shall pass the remainder of our lives; departing from this fortress, where, on account of the superior force of the enemy who attacked it, and the fatal chance of our not having any garrison for its defence, except a few poor and raw peasants, amounting to less than 300, we have not been able to resist the assault, as your Majesty must have already learnt from the governor or others. Our just grief allows us to notice no other fact for the information of your Majesty, but that all the inhabitants, and each singly, fulfilled their duties in their several stations; and our governor and alcalde have worked with the greatest zeal and activity, without allowing the horrors of the incessant cannonading to deter them from their duties, to which they attended personally, encouraging all with great devotion. May Divine Providence guard the royal person of your Majesty, Gibraltar, August 5th (N. S.), 1704. Several factors influenced the decision including the expectation of a counterattack ...plundered the inhabitants. Partly on account of this, partly because they expected Gibraltar to be retaken soon, all the inhabitants except a very few...chose to leave and the violence Although Article V promised freedom or religion and full civil rights to all Spaniards who wished to stay in Habsburg Gibraltar, few decided to run the risk of remaining in the town. Fortresses changed hands quite frequently in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The English hold on Gibraltar might be only temporary. When the fortunes of war changed, the Spanish citizens would be able to re-occupy their property and rebuild their lives. ... Hesse's and Rooke's senior officers did their utmost to impose discipline, but the inhabitants worst fears were confirmed: women were insulted and outraged; Roman Catholic churches and institutions were taken over as stores and for other military purposes ...; and the whole town suffered at the hands of the ship's crew and marines who came ashore. Many bloody reprisals were taken by inhabitants before they left, bodies of murdered Englishmen and Dutchmen being thrown down wells and cesspits. By the time discipline was fully restored, few of the inhabitants wished or dared to remain. during the capture, which ultimately proved disastrous for the Habsburg cause. So the damage was done and the chance of winning the adherence of the Andalusians was lost. The subsequent siege failed to dislodge the Habsburg forces and the refugees settled around Algeciras and the hermitage of San Roque. The Alliance's conduct aroused anger in Spain against the 'heretics', and once again the chance of winning over Andalusians to the Imperial cause was lost. Prince George was the first to complain, which was resented by Byng who had led the fighting and who in turn blamed the Prince and his few Spanish or Catalan supporters. Rooke complained in a letter home that the Spaniards were so exasperated against the Alliance that ‚Äòthey use the prisoners they take as barbarously as the Moors‚Äô.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 414 Spain attempted to retake Gibraltar in 1727 and most notably in 1779, when it entered the American Revolutionary War on the American side as an ally of France.\\"Gibraltar.\\" Microsoft Encarta 2006 [DVD]. Microsoft Corporation, 2005. The capture of Gibraltar was recognised as a great achievement in Lisbon and by all the trading interests in the Mediterranean. A month after its capture Secretary of State Sir Charles Hedges described it as 'of great use to us [the English] for securing our trade and interrupting the enemy's'.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 415 With the English navy established on the Straits the piratical Moors of the Barbary Coast became reluctant to attack English merchant shipping, and allied themselves with Queen Anne. However, Gibraltar's immediate use as a port was limited for it could only take a few ships at a time, and ministers did not think they could keep it unless a garrison could be found for its security. John Methuen recommended an English garrison. This was supplied by the marines that had helped take the place, and by several companies of regular troops. Gibraltar was, therefore, held by English troops and at English cost ‚Äì but it was in name. A year later the Austrian candidate wrote to Queen Anne about ‚ÄúMa ville de Gibraltar‚Äù. If he had succeeded in his attempt to ascend the throne in Madrid the difficulty of keeping Gibraltar for England would have been politically very great. The Alliance fleet returned to Tetuan to water. Before fresh orders came from Lisbon there was news of the approach of the French Grand Fleet under Toulouse. In an attempt by the French to retake Gibraltar, the one full-dress naval engagement of the war was fought off M√°laga on 24 August; afterwards, French and Spanish troops battered at the land approaches, defended by a small garrison of sailors, soldiers, and marines. In 1711, the British and French Governments started secret negotiations to end the war leading to the cession of Gibraltar to the British by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, which remains a British overseas territory to this day.

Early life William Henry Evered Poole was born in Caledon, Cape Colony on 8 October 1902. He was the son of Major William John Evered Poole, previously of the 60th King's Royal Rifle Corps, and Constance van Breda, a member of one of the best-known Cape Colony families, who had married in October the previous year. As the first-born son, he was given Evered as his last name in accordance with age-old Poole tradition. Poole attended an Anglican private boys' school, St Andrew's College in Grahamstown, from 1911 to 1917 and the Diocesan College, informally known as \\"Bishops\\", Rondebosch in 1918.Beyers C.J., Dictionary of South African Biography, Volume V, Human Sciences Research Council, Pretoria, 1987 In 1927, Poole married Elsie Irene van Boeschoten and had one daughter. After the dissolution of the marriage in 1951, he married Maureen Naish-Gray on 22 October 1951. Military career =Regimental service and peacetime commands= In 1920, while a public servant, Poole joined the 9th Infantry Regiment (Cape Peninsula Rifles) of the Active Citizen Force as a private. Poole transferred to the Permanent Force in 1922. He was placed first on the course for promotion to commissioned rank on 11 September 1923. He was next posted as a lieutenant to the 3rd Battery, South African Field Artillery and transferred to the South African Permanent Garrison Artillery at Cape Town in March 1925, when he again qualified in the first place on a garrison gunnery course. In 1927, he attended a staff duties course at the South African Military College at Roberts Heights and was attached to the South African staff Corps at the college in 1929, again passing out in the first place on a staff duties course of the Permanent Force in 1931. Appointed officer instructor to the Transvaal Horse Artillery for 1931‚Äì32, he qualified as a captain in the Field Artillery at the end of 1931. In June 1932, he was granted the temporary rank of captain as staff officer, 'A' and 'G', in Cape Town and transferred to the staff corps. Poole was subsequently posted to the Special Service Battalion as second-in-command with the rank of major. He became the Officer Commanding of the battalion in February 1934. In June 1935, he was granted the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel and was attached to the British Brigade of Guards at Aldershot, in London, and at Pirbright until September 1935. For the rest of the year, he attended the Senior Officers' School at Sheerness. He returned to South Africa to resume command of the Special Service Battalion in 1936. In October 1937, Poole was transferred to the South African Military College and became Commandant of the college on 16 March 1938. Following the Union's entry into the Second World War in September 1939, Poole organised the greatly expanded facilities at the college, including the huge 'B' Mess dining halls seating 500 officer cadets. =Second World War= Poole was appointed General Service Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of 1st Infantry Division, with the rank of colonel, on its formation in August 1940. However, when the 2nd Infantry Division was formed he became its GSO1 on 1 October 1940. In April 1941, Poole was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier. In June, he was transferred back to the 1st Division as brigadier to take command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade in Egypt. He saw active service with the brigade at Mersa Matruh, commanding 'Braforce' under the 2nd Division on the Egyptian frontier later in 1941, and then with the 1st Division on the Gazala Line from February to May 1942. He returned temporarily to South Africa as officer commanding Cape Fortress until rejoining his brigade at El Alamein in August 1942. There he commanded the brigade in the Second Battle of El Alamein in October‚ÄìNovember 1942. He returned to South Africa as second-in-command of the 1st Division. Poole assumed command, with the rank of major general, of the 6th Armoured Division on its formation in February 1943. He retained command throughout its training in the Middle East and subsequent service in Italy as part of the British Eighth Army. After the liberation of Florence, the division became part of the Fifth United States Army. At the end of the war, he became General Officer Administration of all South African troops in the Allied Central Mediterranean Force until their repatriation on 2 March 1946. During the Second World War, Poole was twice mentioned in despatches, received the Distinguished Service Order, and was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was among the very few South Africans to be invested as a Commander of the United States Legion of Merit, and was invested as a Commander of the French Legion of Honour. He also received the French Croix de Guerre. Post-war and diplomatic career In 1948, Poole was passed over as Chief of Staff by the newly elected National Party government of Dr D. F. Malan and posted to Berlin to head the South African military mission there. After this he switched to a diplomatic career. He was subsequently appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Italy, Greece and Egypt, and in 1954 was transferred to Argentina and Chile. In 1960, he became ambassador to Greece.

In 1641 Cradock was in the group of preachers for Wales authorized by the Long Parliament : others were Erbery, Ambrose Mostyn, Richard Symonds, and Henry Walter. These Welsh radicals formed a tight and effective lobbying group, and held together until the mid-1650s. Parliament renewed similar authority, in 1645 and 1646, with funding; it was also specified that Symonds, Henry Walter and Cradock should preach in Welsh. Cradock had already shown he could do that in 1645, preaching to captured royalist Welshman after the battle of Naseby.Christopher Hill, Change and Continuity in 17th Century England (1974), p. 26. He was one of the ‚ÄúWelsh saints‚Äù, who commanded troops of Thomas Harrison with Vavasor Powell and Jenkin Jones.Austin Woolrych, Commonwealth to Protectorate (1982), p. 11. He was later appointed the regular preacher to Barebone's Parliament, at St. Margaret's, Westminster.Austin Woolrych, Commonwealth to Protectorate (1982), p. 241. He was a supporter of Oliver Cromwell, and when controversy arose over Cromwell's Protectorate, he condemned Vavasor Powell's anti-Cromwell pamphlet The Word of God.

Hewsen, Armenia: A Historical Atlas. The University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 163. The founder of this principality was Esayi abu-Muse, in the 9th century. In the 16-18th centuries Dizak was ruled by the Armenian Melik-Avanian dynasty, a branch of the House of Syunik-Khachen. The seat of the princes of Dizak was the town of Togh (or Dogh) with the adjacent ancient fortress of Ktish. One of the last princes of Dizak, Esayi Melik-Avanian, was killed by Ibrahim Khalil Khan in 1781, after a long-lasting resistance in the fortress of Ktish.

Mushegh Bagratuni (the son of Smbat Sparapet, who was forced to join the Abbasid Army) recited a poem to this battle, comparing it with the second coming of Christ.Tovma Artsruni and Anon, History of the House of Artruni, Yerevan 1985, pp. 297‚Äì98. The resistance of Ktish endured more than a year. Esayi wrote to the caliph protesting against this attack and after receiving from him a safe-conduct, he went to Bugha for peace talks. Bugha however treacherously captured him. In 855 Esayi Abu-Muse, along with him all the princes of Armenia, who were captured by Bugha, were exiled to Samarra in Mesopotamia. Offspring *1.

Haynes has subsequently resigned, and the first Director reported to United States Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England and acting General Counsel Daniel J. Dell'Orto. Directors The first officer to be appointed Director was Brigadier Thomas W. Hartmann a military lawyer in the United States Air Force Reserve. Hartmann had previously been the Legal Advisor to the Convening Authority for the Office of Military Commissions.

Hartmann had been reassigned from the position of Legal Advisor after the officers Presiding over three separate Guantanamo military commissions had barred him from participation after he was accused of putting \\"undue command influence\\" on Prosecutors. On 2 November 2008 Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, reported that Hartmann had filed a request to retire from the Air Force on 17 February 2008. Hartmann was replaced by his deputy Michael Chapman, who had been the deputy Legal Advisor since April 2005. Hartmann attributed his reassigment, and appointment to the new position, to the \\"explosive growth of the commissions over the last 10 or 12 months.\\" The Air Force described Hartmann new appointment as a promotion. Hartmann's boss at the Pentagon, William J. Haynes, had resigned in February. The Operations Director position was \\"civilianized\\" in the fall of 2009 following Hartman's retirement. The current Director of Operations, Ward K. Johnson, III, was appointed to the post in November 2009. Johnson had previously served on active duty with the U.S. Army as a Branch Chief, Presiding Officer and Tribunal President with the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants under the control of Deputy Secretary of Defense England.

Early life Rita de Acosta was born in New York City in 1875 to Ricardo de Acosta (1837‚Äì1907), a steamship-line executive of Cuban descent, and a Spanish mother, Micaela Hern√°ndez de Alba y de Alba (1853‚Äì1921), reputedly a relation of the Dukes of Alba.

Personal life Portrait photograph of Mrs. Rita Lydig, 1925 Rita de Acosta was married twice. Her first marriage was on January 3, 1895 when the 16 year old Rita became the first wife of multimillionaire William Earl Dodge Stokes (1852‚Äì1926), who built The Ansonia on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The marriage was unhappy, reportedly due to Stokes's temper and physical cruelty, and when it was dissolved by divorce in 1900, she received a settlement of nearly two million dollars, a record for the time. In February 1922, she testified in court against Stokes, then going through an acrimonious divorce from his second wife, stating that he used to beat her during their marriage. Before their divorce, they lived at 262 West 72nd Street and became the parents of one son, William Earl Dodge Stokes Jr. (1896‚Äì1982). In 1902, she married Major Philip Mesier Lydig, a wealthy and socially prominent retired officer in the United States Army, in Grace Church chantry by the Rev. Dr. William R. Houghton. She was given away by her brother Ricardo, her sister Aida was her maid of honor and William Astor Chanler was Lydig's best man. In 1913, she sold her art collection, which included pieces by Sandro Botticelli. They separated in 1914 and divorced in 1919. In 1921, Lydig announced her engagement to Reverend Percy Stickney Grant (1860‚Äì1927), rector of the Church of the Ascension. Their wedding plans were broken off in 1924 when Bishop William Manning refused to authorize the marriage, citing Lydig being a divorc√©e with two living former husbands. Rev. Grant died shortly afterwards, leaving his personal fortune to the woman he had hoped to marry, and Lydig spent large sums of money on fashion, art, furniture, and other objects to overcome her grief. Heavily in debt, she was forced to sell her Washington Square home and its contents, was declared bankrupt. Rita died of pernicious anaemia at the Gotham Hotel on October 27, 1929 at the age of 54.

He is regarded as the founding father of the Fluidization in Chemical Engineering. Early life John Frank Davidson was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the industrial centre of the county of Northumberland. His school years (1937‚Äì1944) fell on severe days of World War II. In 1944, he entered the University of Cambridge, with which all his further life has been associated. After receiving the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1947, Davidson joined Rolls-Royce in Derby, where he served two and a half years in the Mechanical Development Department. Having returned in 1950 to Cambridge, he became a graduate student in the Engineering Department (1950‚Äì1952). At the end of 1952, he passed to the recently founded Department of Chemical Engineering of the University of Cambridge. In that period, Davidson began to theoretically study the motion of large gas bubbles in liquids and wrote his still widely cited works on the mass transfer between a bubble and a liquid flowing past it. However, what is more important, these studies stimulated him to carry out a number of pioneering works on fluidisation, which were generalised in his book Fluidised Particles(1963), written with David Harrison (later, this book was translated into Russian). This was one of the first books on fluidisation, and it generated keen interest. Career Davidson's works made an important contribution to the development of the hydrodynamics of a circulating fluidised bed and the heat transfer in a fluidised bed and also to the creation and implementation of methods for lignite combustion in a fluidised bed. Davidson received the degree of PhD in 1953 and the degree of Doctor of Science in 1968 at the University of Cambridge. In 1974, for works on two-phase flows and, first of all, for achievements in fluidisation, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in chemical engineering (He was elected as a Vice-President, Royal Society of London, 1989). In 1974‚Äì1975, he was a member of the Court of Enquiry for the Flixborough disaster. Davidson's research work was always closely related to his pedagogical activities. He started as a university demonstrator in chemical engineering (1950) and then was a university lecturer (1954), a reader in chemical engineering (1964), and a professor (1975). In 1975‚Äì1993, Davidson headed the Department of Chemical Engineering of the University of Cambridge and did much for the development of the department, updating of the curriculum, and strengthening of relations with industry. In 1978‚Äì1993, he bore the title of Shell Professor of Chemical Engineering since Shell was an important sponsor of the foundation of the department. Indissoluble are the ties of Davidson's life and activities with Trinity College, one of the oldest Cambridge colleges, ties lasting from 1949 to the present time. In 1957, he became the College's steward responsible for the entire household, including organisation of receptions of the royal family. The most difficult challenge in this period was the reconstruction of the Old Kitchen, built in 1605. This reconstruction lasted several years in the early 1960s. In 1992‚Äì1996, Davidson was vice master of Trinity College. In 1970‚Äì1971, Davidson was president of the Institution of Chemical Engineers; he is a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Engineering (1976), Docteur Honoris Causa de l'Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse (1979), an Honorary Doctor of Science of the University of Aston (1989), and a Foreign Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (1991). He has the Kurnakov Memorial Medal given by the Kurnakov Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry of the USSR Academy of Sciences (1991) and was elected a foreign member of the Russian Engineering Academy (1998). In 1999, Davidson was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society of London. Davidson was a frequent participant at and guest of Mendeleev congresses, at which he has delivered plenary lectures. He continued active research work at the Department of Chemical Engineering of Cambridge University after his retirement in 1992. Personal life He married Susanne Hedwig Ostberg in 1948. They have a son and a daughter. Recognition He was awarded a Royal Medal in 1999 for his chemical engineering work, and has been a Fellow of the Royal Society since 1974. He was president of the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) from 1970 to 1971 and vice-president of the Royal Society in 1989. He was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

Based in Oslo, Aker BioMarine is part of the Aker Group The company also created Eco-Harvesting. History Aker BioMarine was established as an independent enterprise in 2006, building on years of deepwater fishing experience as part of Norway‚Äòs Aker Group. Its previous business activities were, with theexception of the biotechnology company Natural, previously organized under Aker Seafoods Holding, a 100 percent subsidiary of Aker ASA. In 2003, Aker BioMarine began what it is best known for: harvesting and processing Antarctic krill. Traditionally, harvesting krill in a commercially viable and environmentally sound way was difficult. Aker claims it has solved this problem through its proprietary Aker ECO-HARVESTING technology. The company re-listed on the Olso Stock Exchange on July 6. Technology and products Aker BioMarine produces krill products rich in omega-3 phospholipids. Krill is mainly used for the production of krill meal and krill oil, which in turn is used for animal or aquaculture feed and for human consumption through health products and omega-3 supplements. The company has registered Superba as the company‚Äôs brand name for nutraceuticals and Qrill as the company‚Äôs brand name for its krill meal and krill oil products for aquaculture. As for research, a 2009 study of Superba krill oil found that it gave a substantially larger reduction of fat in the heart and the liver than omega-3 from fish oil. A clinical study in children with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) suggests that Superba krill oil offered significant improvements in both clinical scores and in identified EEG patterns as compared to typical ADHD EEG patterns. In one study, krill-fed salmon acquired 11% greater body weight than that of the fish in the control group. In 2011, krill oil was classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use as a human food ingredient. In one study, krill-fed salmon acquired 11% greater body weight than that of the fish in the control group. The company uses Eco-Harvesting, a technology that brings live krill on board the boat and prevents the unnecessary by-catch such as birds and sea mammals. It also reduces the waste incurred by traditional methods when a proportion of the catch at the bottom of the net is rendered unusable through pressure from the rest as it is hauled aboard. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified ECO-HARVESTING as sustainable on June 15, 2010. As of 2013, Aker BioMarine is the only krill fishery to achieve this distinction. Awards and accomplishments Aside from Superba receiving GRAS status and achieving MSC certification, the company received the \\"Investment in the Future Award 2012\\" from Nutrition Business Journal. Aker BioMarine received the award for \\"strategically investing more than $550 million to build out the krill supply chain in the Antarctic with a long-term focus on sustainable harvesting\\". Memberships and associations Aker BioMarine works closely with WWF-Norway and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) as well as independent scientists and marine conservationists to ensure that the company contributes to the well-being of the krill fishery and the Antarctic food chain. To that end, Aker BioMarine is a founding member of the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies (ARK), which works with CCAMLR to ensure a healthy and sustainable krill population in Antarctica.

Migraine Boy is a comic strip created by cartoonist Greg Fiering, which has been published in several mainstream printed media and TV. Usually presented in black and white six-panel strips, the comic is set in a typical American suburban neighbourhood backyard, and deals with a bad-tempered kid suffering from chronic migraines, and his interaction with his neighbour who constantly approaches him trying to befriend him. The stories have a grim, sometimes absurd or surreal sense of humor, and often end up with Migraine Boy reacting violently to the irritation produced by his neighbour. History The comic strip made its first appearance in 1992 in the Seattle-based Hype magazine. Over the course of the years, it was also published in other printed media, such as the Spy magazine, Flagpole Magazine, the Village Voice, UTNE Reader, The Baffler, Rolling Stone, and Entertainment Weekly. In 1994, the US rock band R.E.M. chose Fiering to create the album cover for their album titled Monster, after lead singer Michael Stipe saw Migraine Boy in the Flagpole magazine. This ultimately resulted in Flagpole introducing Stipe and Fiering to each other, and Migraine Boy being featured in the album's inside booklet. A year later, in 1995 a 64-page book, called Migraine Boy's Fairweather Friends (), was published in the US by St. Martin's Griffin, featuring an introductory text written by Stipe. In 1996, animation studio GreenHead Media produced a series of twelve thirty-second short clips for MTV, animated by James Dean Conklin, which were aired as fillers over the duration of that year. Later, in year 2000, a second book, titled I Don't Love You!: The Best of Migraine Boy () was published by Slave Labor Graphics. In 2001, Fiering and Conklin independently produced an animated short film called Migraine Boy: The Bet, technically superior to those aired on MTV, which featured colored 3D graphics.Migraine Boy: The Bet at YouTube Since June 2010, Fiering has been posting new Migraine Boy comics on the official \\"Migraine Boy and Pals\\" website. Awards The Migraine Boy website was nominated for the 1997 Webby Awards, in the \\"Art and Design\\" category. Characters ;Migraine Boy: Bearing gritted teeth and a permanent frown, Migraine Boy is the main character of the strip, and the one that gives it its name. Although his real name is never clearly stated, it is suggested to be \\"Joey\\" in the episode named \\"Blossom\\".Migraine Boy - \\"Blossom\\" He appears as a bad-tempered young boy with his migraine symbolized in the comic strips as wiggly lines around his head. In MTV's animated version, the migraine is also accompanied by a pulsating low sound, and the appearance of the wiggly lines and the intensity of the sound apparently respond to Migraine Boy's level of irritation. ;Migraine Boy's neighbour: Appearing in mostly all of the strips, Migraine Boy's overjoyful neighbour is the most recurring character besides Migraine Boy himself. Despite his name never being mentioned, he has unofficially come to be known as Aspirin Boy. His interventions in the comic strips often consist of him trying to cheer up Migraine Boy, most frequently by trying to play games with him (usually dress- up ones), or trying to find ways to relieve him from his headache. He is also shown to frequently have the necessity to love and be loved by Migraine Boy. In numerous episodes, suggestions are even made that his feelings for Migraine Boy go beyond those of friendship and sometimes tend towards homosexual love, which disgusts Migraine Boy even more than usual. Because there is seldom continuity or consistency in Migraine Boy, the strip can have him kill his neighbor in the last panel.Migraine Boy - \\"Cupid\\" ;Tylenol: Named after the popular painkiller often used to treat migraines, Tylenol is Migraine Boy's shih tzu pet dog. Although he is rarely seen, he has been shown to be able to perform human-like tasks such as talking or weightlifting.Migraine Boy - \\"X-tra Strength\\" References External links *Migraine Boy official site *MigraineBoy.com *Greg Fiering's homepage *GreenHead Media Category:American comic strips Category:1990s American television series Category:1990s American animated television series Category:Comic strips started in the 1990s Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992 Category:Child characters in comics Category:Migraine ","title":"Migraine Boy"},{"id":"20038930","text":"George Klein may refer to: *George Klein (inventor) (1904‚Äì1992), Canadian inventor *George Klein (comics) (died 1969), American comic book artist *George Klein (biologist) (1925‚Äì2016), Hungarian-Swedish biologist and writer *George Klein (DJ) (born 1935‚Äì2019), disc jockey and television host *George Klein (Canadian football) (1932‚Äì?), Canadian football player *George S.

It became known nationwide in the 2000s with the success of young pop singers from Amami ≈åshima such as Hajime Chitose and Atari K≈çsuke.  Names and concepts  Although shima-uta is often considered to represent Amami's musical tradition, it is just one of various music genres. Amami's traditional songs can be classified into three categories: # kami-uta (religious songs sung by priestesses) including omori, tahab√´ and kuchi, # warabe-uta (children's songs), and # min'yo (folk songs). Amami's min'yo is further divided into three genres: # gy≈çji-uta (songs for annual events) including songs for hachigatsu-odori, # shigoto-uta (work songs), associated with rice planting, sailing, etc., and # asobi-uta, which are sung at recreational gatherings. In a narrower sense, shima-uta refers to asobi-uta and is also known as sanshin-uta, zashiki-uta (lit. room songs) and nagusami- uta (lit. comforting songs). In a broader sense, shima-uta also covers gy≈çji- uta and shigoto-uta. = History of conceptualization = Today shima-uta is recognized as a genre of songs both in academics and in popular culture. However, musicologist Takahashi Miki shows that recognition has only been developed relatively recently. The word means \\"island\\" in Japanese. In Amami ≈åshima and other islands, it also means (one's own) community within the island. Such a semantic extension can be understood by the fact that many communities had little contact with the outside because they were geographically isolated by the vast sea in the front and heavy mountains in the back. Thus shima-uta originally means songs transmitted in one's own community. A report states that elderly people only refer to their own community's songs as shima-uta; songs from other communities are not considered shima-uta. In written Japanese, the specialized meaning of shima is sometimes indicated by the use of katakana („Ç∑„Éû), instead of the conventional kanji (Â≥∂). In modern Japanese academia, Amami's traditional songs were described by the term min'yo (folk songs), a term which can be found in Shigeno Y≈´k≈ç's Amami ≈åshima minzoku-shi (1927), Kazari Eikichi's Amami ≈åshima min'y≈ç taikan (1933) and Nobori Shomu's Dai Amami shi (1949). These authors were influenced by Yanagita Kunio, the father of Japanese folkloristics, who developed the concept of min'y≈ç as a product of society and communal space. Takahashi notes that although Kazari's monograph of 1933 used shima-uta and min'y≈ç apparently interchangeably, the revised edition of 1966 almost exclusively chose min'y≈ç. The term min'y≈ç also gained public acceptance throughout Japan when the national broadcasting organization NHK began to use the term in its radio programs in 1947. While the natives of the Amami Islands chose the academic term min'y≈ç to describe Amami's traditional songs, some people from outside the Amami Islands used shima-uta proactively. In his preface to Kazari's 1966 book, Shimao Toshio, a novelist from Kanagawa Prefecture, praised shima-uta as \\"Amami's spirit and embodiment\\" while he used min'y≈ç in academic contexts, in the hiragana spelling („Åó„Åæ„ÅÜ„Åü). Ogawa Hisao, who was born in Hokkaido but played an important role in publicizing shima-uta, showed a varying attitude toward the word. In his monograph titled Amami min'y≈ç-shi (1979), he exclusively used min'y≈ç, probably due to the book's academic nature. In 1981, however, he published the Amami no shima-uta, where shima-uta was written in kanji (Â≥∂ÂîÑ). He noted that while shima-uta had referred to songs of isolated communities, it became increasingly frequent that shima-uta was performed for outsiders. He contrasted Amami's shima-uta with mainland Japanese min'y≈ç, which he thought had been transformed into show business, and he replaced the kanji form (Â≥∂ÂîÑ) with katakana („Ç∑„Éû„Ç¶„Çø) in his Amami shima-uta e no sh≈çtai (1999). Takanashi conjectured that by doing this Ogawa had shown his . As for popular culture, Takahashi analyzed the Nankai Nichinichi Shinbun, a local newspaper of the Amami Islands, and found that the word shima-uta (Â≥∂ÂîÑ, Â≥∂Ê≠å) gradually replaced min'y≈ç from 1959 to the early 1980s. A similar change can be observed in the titles of records published by Amami ≈åshima-based Central Gakki. The transition might have been boosted by the change of the name of Amami's major min'y≈ç content to shima-uta taikai in 1977. In 1979, Tsukiji Shunz≈ç won grand prizes in the All-Japan Folk Song Contest. He was followed by T≈çhara Mitsuyo in 1989 and Rikki in 1990. In the 2000s, Hajime Chitose and Atari K≈çsuke sang pop songs in the style of shima- uta. This series of events helped make shima-uta become recognized as a regional brand of Amami. = Okinawa and The Boom = Confusingly, Okinawa Prefecture's folk songs are sometimes referred to as shima-uta, which causes a conflict of interest with those who see shima-uta as a regional brand of Amami. Shima-uta is not a native term of Okinawa, Miyako or Yaeyama but was introduced from Amami in the 1970s. Okinawa's folk songs were simply called uta in local communities and were described as min'y≈ç in academic writing. Musicologist Takahashi Miki identified two persons who had popularized the term shima-uta in Okinawa Prefecture. One is Nakasone K≈çichi, who is known for his research on folk songs of the Amami, Okinawa, Miyako and Yaeyama Islands. He borrowed the term from an Okinawa-based community of Amami people but extended its referent to folk songs of these four archipelagoes. He consistently used the hiragana form („Åó„Åæ„ÅÜ„Åü). Although he contrasted shima-uta with mainland Japanese min'y≈ç, Nakasone's understanding of shima-uta was heavily influenced by Yanagita Kunio. Resisting commercialism, he searched for songs transmitted by local communities. The other important figure is Uehara Naohiko, a radio personality and songwriter of the Ryukyu Broadcasting Corporation. Around 1970, he visited Amami ≈åshima and was taught the name shima-uta by local singers. He stuck to the mixed writing (Â≥∂„ÅÜ„Åü). He claimed that the name had been used in Okinawa too, but Takahashi found no evidence to support his claim. His notion of shima-uta was drastically different from that of academics: he applied the term not only to traditional folk songs but to shin min'y≈ç (contemporary folk music) and even to pop music. He used his radio programs and musical events to popularize the name shima-uta in Okinawa. Uehara was different from Nakasone in that he engaged in transforming folk songs into popular music. In 1992, The Boom, a rock band from Yamanashi Prefecture, released an Okinawa-inspired song titled \\"Shima Uta\\" (Â≥∂ÂîÑ). It became a smash hit in Japanese market and the name shima-uta came to be associated with Okinawa pop in mainland Japan.  Features  Shima-uta is often performed alternatively by a pair of a man and a woman. When one sings, the other must answer. One must choose and sing the most appropriate song in reply to the other's song. This style of performance is called utakake. Koizumi Fumio analyzed Japanese musical scales with the so-called tetrachord theory. There are four major tetrachords, namely ry≈´ky≈´, min'y≈ç, ritsu and miyakobushi. In Northern Amami (Amami ≈åshima, Tokunoshima and Kikai Island), the ritsu, min'y≈ç and miyakobushi tetrachords can be found. In this respect, Northern Amami stands in sharp contrast with the Okinawa Islands, where the ry≈´ky≈´ and ritsu scales are prevalent. Southern Amami (Okinoerabu and Yoron Islands) are similar to northern Okinawa. Probably the most distinct feature of shima-uta is its extensive use of falsetto, which is usually avoided in mainland Japan and Okinawa. Male and female voices are usually of the same pitch. Today shima-uta is sung to the accompaniment of the sanshin (shamisen). There is no consensus on when sanshin were introduced to Amami, but it is clear that until recently only wealthy families owned them. In any case, Amami has developed its own variant of sanshin, e.g., using a plectrum (pick) made of thinly sliced bamboo instead of Okinawa's thick plectrum made of water buffalo horn  Origin  Shima-uta shares its 8-8-8-6 syllable structure with Okinawa's ry≈´ka. It is generally agreed by scholars that this is an innovative form that emerged relatively recently. However, there remains a disagreement over exactly how it evolved. Hokama Shuzen considered that the earliest form of songs were incantations that were sometimes chanted rather than sung. From such incantations, epic songs such as Okinawa's umui and kwƒìna and Amami's omori and nagare emerged. Epic songs then evolved into lyric songs, including Amami's shima-uta and Okinawa's ry≈´ka. He claimed that the development of lyrical ry≈´ka from epic omoro happened in the 15th to 16th centuries, when Okinawan people were supposedly liberated from religious bondage and began to express personal feelings. He also considered that the introduction of sanshin helped the transition from the long, relatively free verse forms to the short, fixed verse form. As for Amami, Hokama emphasized Amami's internal development from omori to nagare and from nagare to shima-uta. Although shima-uta's 8-8-8-6 syllable structure is likely to have been formed under the influence of Okinawa's ry≈´ka, he considered it of secondary importance. Ono J≈´r≈ç simply saw shima-uta as a derivation from Okinawa's ry≈´ka. He also supported the transition from epic songs to lyric songs. However, his theory is radically different from Hokama's in that the 8-8-8-6 form was formed under the influence of kinsei kouta of mainland Japan, which has the 7-7-7-5 syllable structure. He dismissed the hypothesis that the first stanza of omoro of the later stage partly showed the 8-8-8-6 pattern, which he reanalyzed as kwƒìna- like 5-3, 5-3, and 5-5-3. He dated the formation of ry≈´ka to the first half of the 17th century, shortly after kinsei kouta became common in mainland Japan. Ogawa questioned the transition from epic songs to lyric songs. He suggested the possibility that both types of songs had co-existed for a long time. The most critical weakness of his hypothesis is the lack of attested lyric songs from earlier times. He attempted to explain this by their extemporaneous nature: lyric songs, or love songs in particular, must have been quickly replaced while people had a strong incentive to preserve epic songs.

Moshir Habibollah Homayoun Shahrdar was born into a wealthy merchant family in 1886. He is widely credited as being the first Iranian pianist, and judging by his appearance as a frequent accompanist on 78s (credited and uncredited), the Persian repertoire greatly benefited from his expertise. Biography He was born in Tehran in 1886. He was the first known Iranian pianist. He played and composed Persian Music for piano. His father was Nasrullah Khan Sepahsalarie kompanye Shirazi. His teachers were Agha Bozorg [Army Music officer], Mirza Hussein Gholi Farahani, Hussein Esmaeil Zadeh, and Mohammad Sadegh Khan Sorourol Molk. He went to London with Darvish Khan to record Gramophone Discs. He recorded many discs with Darvish Kahn, Zelli, Farah Angiz, Taher Zadeh and‚Ä¶ His Discs:W029, GPX8, WXGPX6, GFX7, G.C.7-12250, G.C.7-19272. He is also the founder of the Shahrdar Family. First Iranian piano player His father, Nasrullah Khan Sepahsalari Kompani Shirazi, was a merchant who spent 6 months out of the year in France and 6 months in Tehran. He would take Persian rugs and artworks to Paris and trade them for French articles. In 1890, Nasrollah Sepahsalari Kompani returned to Iran with 2 pianos and chandeliers. He gave one of the pianos to the Royal Court under Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar. The second piano, he took to his home. At the time, being a wealthy merchant, Nasrollah Sepah Salar Kompani had an estate in Tehran whereby there was a large home towards the aft of the property where his wife and children lived, and near to the entrance of the property, there was a separate building used to entertain guests and finalize business transactions. Apparently, the piano was placed in the business building of the property and no one knew how to play the piano. Nasrullah Khan had 11 children. His 5th child was Habibollah. When he brought the piano, young Habibollah was 4 years of age, and his father would bring him to the entertainment building in the evening and force him to play the piano. He had no formal training in piano playing, however, he was accustomed to hearing the traditional Persian instruments such as the Tar, Santoor, and Kamanche. Young Habibollah could apply the sounds from these instruments to the piano and produce beautiful music. This became a passion of his which lasted his lifetime. He was often heard on Iranian National Radio playing his piano in the 1950s and was referred to as Goldfingers. His father died from heart disease when he was young. By the time he was 20 years of age, he went to England and played the piano in the Royal Court. Civil services He became a civil servant and worked with Reza Shah in the modernization of Iran. He was instrumental in the organization of the first Iranian census whereby all citizens of Iran had to be registered and a surname had to be recorded for all families. At the time, he was a Mayor in Shiraz, and therefore, he adopted the name of Shahrdar, which means holder or possessor of the city. His last name was then given to all his brothers and sisters. He also was a chief of police in Tehran before being appointed mayor of Shiraz. He also was CEO of national Iranian steel company. This was a company established by German engineers. Politically, he was opposed to the religious ruling and to dictatorships. For this, in the early 1900s, he was shortly imprisoned. He was soon released with no consequence. World War II During World War II Nazi Germany requested Iranian assistance in building a railroad track from Iran to Europe. In the late 1930s thanks to German companies and Reza Shah, the Iranian Steel Corporation was formed. Reza Shah appointed Shahrdar in charge of overseeing the development of the corporation. Even though Iran was a neutral country during World War II, Reza Shah seemed to favor Nazi Germany, which alarmed the Allied Forces. On August 25, 1941, the Allied Forces invaded Iran with Russia invading from the North and the British from the South. Shahrdar feared the Russians would retaliate for his involvement with the Iranian Steel Corporation, so he took his family and fled to Shiraz. Shiraz is a southern city and was occupied by the British and the Americans. Eventually, hostilities subsided and he returned to Tehran. Personal life and family He married at an early age. His wife died from illness, and he did not remarry until age 39. Marriage to Forough Afkham Afkhami. When he lived in Shiraz, he had the opportunity to befriend with a noble named Emamgholi Afkham-Ebrahimi that he was the son of Soltan Ali Khan VAZIR AFKHAM a prime minister in Qajar dynasty. One day, Emamgholi showed a picture of one of his daughters to Habibollah Shahrdar. Habibollah khan could obtain the picture from him, and then he sent a message to his sister in Tehran to propose to young Forough Afkhami. She and her family accepted Habibollah Shahrdar's sister acted as proxy in Teheran for civil marriage to her. Therefore, he was not present at his wedding. Then a caravan was arranged where both families traveled to Shiraz for the wedding party and at which time Habibollah Shahrdar met his wife Forough. They had 5 children: Cyrus, Farideh, Shahrdokht, Cambize, and Pirooz. Death He developed Parkinson's disease and in 1969, he died from complications of the disease. He is remembered for his contributions to Persian music and his civil service.

Initially planned as an ambitious land grant railroad which would run the length of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, poor finances and politically motivated routes frustrated these aims.  History  The AL&TB; was one of several railroads chartered in the 1850s to take advantage of a land grant program instituted by the federal government. Under an act of 1856 and successive acts Michigan had in its gift over of land which could be given to railroads (which would then re-sell these lands for a profit) in exchange for constructing certain routes. At the heart of Michigan's network at the time were the Michigan Central Railroad and the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, both of which ran east‚Äìwest across the southern Lower Peninsula. As proposed in the route would run from \\"Amboy by Hillsdale and Lansing, and from Grand Rapids to some point on or near Traverse Bay.\\"Daboll (1906), 464. This route would bisect the existing railroad network and provide a railroad connection to Lansing, the new state capital. Almost immediately local interests intervened: the cities of Owosso and Saginaw, which sit northeast of Lansing, successfully lobbied to change the route to run through their cities, then northwest to Traverse Bay. This was a pronounced change from the initial plan, in which the line ran in a straight line northwest from Lansing. The new route's odd shape prompted a Lansing newspaper to dub it the \\"Ram's Horn Railroad.\\" That epithet had been applied earlier in the decade by Iowa newspaperman James Morgan to a proposed road from Dubuque to Keokuk, whose route was also determined by political considerations and ultimately was not built.Keatley (1883), 34. The company began by building a line from Lansing to Owosso, which it completed in November 1862.Daboll (1906), 464; United States Congress (1882), 14. The railroad was sold in 1866 to the Jackson, Lansing and Saginaw Railroad Company, which in turn became part of the Michigan Central Railroad.

Round Format: The format is three single point rounds, then one double point round, then all subsequent rounds are triple point rounds. There is no sudden death question. Face-Off: Until September 2019, the winner of the face-off played the round. Starting with the September 22, 2019 episode the rules were changed to match the current American rule in effect since 1999, where the winner could choose to play or pass. Stealing a Question after Opponent has Three Strikes: The value of the answer used in a successful steal is added to the family's score (the rule in effect on the American version at the time of the Polish version's debut, dropped in 2003). Prize Money: Each point is worth three z≈Çotys (25,000 old z≈Çotys in 1994, 2.5 new z≈Çotys between 1995 and 1998), and is paid regardless of result. Both the winning and losing families are paid.

Formerly known as the Philippine Export-Import Credit Agency or PhilEXIM, is the principal agency for State Guarantee Finance of the Philippines. The primary objective is to perform development financing role through the provision of credit guarantees in support of trade and investments, exports, infrastructure, energy, tourism, agricultural business/modernization, housing, MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) and other priority sectors of the economy, with the end in view of facilitating and promoting socio-economic and regional development. PHILGUARANTEE is the result of the merger and consolidation of five Philippine Guarantee Programs and Agencies (PGPAs) pursuant to Executive Order No. 58, series of 2018. History The organization was originally created by Presidential Decree (PD 1080) on January 31, 1977, under the name Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation (PHILGUARANTEE) to provide guarantees and facilitate the entry of foreign loans for development projects. On February 12, 1998, its area of operation was expanded and its name accordingly changed to Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines (TIDCORP) by Republic Act No. 8494. It was re-titled again through an Executive Order (EO 85) on March 18, 2002, to Philippine Export- Import Credit Agency (PhilEXIM). On July 23, 2018, President Duterte approved the merger of the Home Guaranty Corporation and the Philippine Export-Import Credit Agency (PhilEXIM) to prevent operational redundancies, standardize policies, facilitate timely approvals, and lower administrative costs. The order transferred the guarantee functions, programs, and funds of the Small Business Corporation and the administration of the Agricultural Guarantee Fund Pool and the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund to the PhilExim, the surviving entity in the amalgamation of the five Philippine Guarantee Programs and Agencies (PGPAs). It also authorized capital stock of the PhilExim to be increased from Php10 billion to Php50 billion while the equity contributions of the national government to the HGC, IGLF, and AGFP will be transferred to the PhilExim to form part of its paid-up capital. To reflect the centralized nature of the merged guarantee functions, the PhilEXIM was renamed as Philippine Guarantee Corporation or PHILGUARANTEE.

Since the Middle Ages various spellings of this ancient surname have been used : Legh, a Lee, Leghe, Leigh and Leyghe; there were also variations on Peter, eg. Piers and Peers, the family's most oft-used given name. The first Sir Piers Legh, of Lyme, was knighted in 1397 and assumed as a coat of arms those of his mother, Matilda de Norley, in lieu of his ancient patrilineal Leigh arms. For ease of distinguishing between the earlier generations, it became customary to append a Roman numeral to the various Leghs' names; in this case the numbering system is as used in The National Trust Handbook for Lyme Park. List of the Leghs of Lyme *Sir Piers Legh I (beheaded 1399) was the second son of Robert Legh of Adlington by his second wife, Matilda, daughter and heiress of Sir Thurstan de Norley of Norley in Lancashire. In 1388, Piers married Margaret d'Anyers, the granddaughter of Sir Thomas d'Anyers, who fought with the Black Prince at the Battle of Cr√©cy (Sir Thomas had recovered the Black Prince's Standard and was rewarded with an annuity of 40 Marks a year drawn on the Black Prince's Cheshire estates, his Royal Manor of Frodsham, which could be redeemed for land of an equivalent value). Sir Thomas's son (also Sir Thomas Danyers aka Daniell) died in 1353, a year before his father, so his young daughter, Margaret d'Anyers, became sole heiress of the Cheadle Hulme manor; as an orphan heiress she was married first to Sir John Radclyffe (who died without issue), then to Sir John Savage of Clifton with whom she had a son, John, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Blanche. After being widowed in 1386 for a second time, she married Piers de Legh on 4 January 1388; he was 28 years of age whilst his bride Dame Margaret Savage (n√©e d'Anyers) was almost 40 as she was said to be 80 at her death in 1428. Dame Margaret Legh and her husband eventually claimed her grandfather's reward from Richard II in 1398 receiving about 1,400 acres at Lyme Handley near Disley in Cheshire; Sir Piers Legh, having been knighted in 1397 by Richard II, was executed at Chester in 1399 after Henry Bolingbroke's coup, later being buried at St Michael's Church, Macclesfield.East Cheshire Past and Present by J.P.

History The club was formed in 1989, initially under the name Pearl 1990, and was subsequently renamed to Kingstonian in 1995. Geoff Phillips, one of the founding members of Kingstonian Cricket Club, led the way in creating the new club from the former Pearl Assurance club and negotiating with Kings College to keep the team at Windsor Avenue. Although he last played for the club in 2009, he continued to be the driving force behind the club, managing finances as the Club treasurer, holding numerous club offices and liaising with Kings College to allow the club to continue to use their ground. It was Geoff's drive, energy and enthusiasm that enabled the club to expand and to join the Surrey Fullers league. For many years, Geoff gave up his Saturday and Sunday afternoons to help at the cricket ground, including preparing teas for home games, manning the bar, even providing a taxi service to get players to and from games. These efforts helped the club save thousands of pounds which enabled the club to purchase items like mobile covers, a bowling machine and a portable cage. Geoff Phillips passed away in November 2019. 2016 2016 was a Breakthrough year for the club as it set up its first ever colts section (Please see section on Coaching Children's Cricket for more details).

He held the Commonwealth welterweight title from 2005 to 2007 and the British welterweight title from 2006 to 2008. Early professional career Anderson's first fight as a professional took place during April 2003 at the York Hall in Bethnal Green winning his fight in the second round against Paul Mcllwaine. An explosive beginning to his pro career saw him stop each of his next three opponents before going the distance for the first time against Sergey Starkov the tough Russian journeyman. One more points win that year against Frenchman Alban Mothie saw Anderson finish his debut year with an impressive record of 6-0. The fight against Mothie was also notable for the fact that it was the first time Anderson had fought in his native Scotland as a professional boxer. All his previous fights that year having been south of the border. A further six fights and six wins were had during 2004 taking the young prospects record up to 12-0 by the end of that year. The reward for this came in January 2005 when Anderson would fight for the Celtic welterweight title in Glasgow, taking on and beating Northern Ireland's Glenn McClarnon who had just challenged David Barnes for the full British title in his previous fight. The bout ended in the 4th round when a clash of heads caused a cut above McClarnon's eye and forced the stoppage handing victory and a first career title to Anderson. British & Commonwealth champion The new Celtic champion fought once more that year before meeting reigning champion Joshua Okine for the Commonwealth welterweight crown at the Ice Rink in Kirkcaldy, Anderson's home town. The fight was Anderson's toughest test to date with the Scot scoring a split decision win over the man from Ghana who had just beaten British champion Barnes in his previous fight. In March 2006 Anderson defended his newly won title with a victory over fellow Scot Craig Dickson. In June 2006, Anderson travelled south to the Aston Villa Leisure Centre in order to meet British title holder Young Mutley in a unification clash and according to some reports produced one of the comebacks of the year in order to take both belts home. Anderson had been put down in the 2nd round and suffered a nasty cut in the 4th and both fighters were taking some heavy punches before a left hook from Anderson left Mutley reeling in the 10th round. A punch that eventually led to the referee stopping the fight. The man from Kirkcaldy was the new unified British and Commonwealth title holder. One more non-title fight that year saw Anderson finish 2006 with two belts and an unbeaten record of 18-0. Defeat to Nuumbembe Former soldier Ali Nuumbembe was the first man to defeat the Scot in a professional ring. The man from Namibia challenged for the Commonwealth title in February 2007 and ran out a close split decision winner in a fight which took place in Anderson's backyard, the Ice Rink in Kirkcaldy. Despite still have the consolation of holding the British belt Anderson was left fuming by the scoring of the fight made by one of the judges saying \\"It was ridiculous. It was like fighting in Italy...I thought I won six out of the first seven and was a round ahead by the time we went into the 12th round...I thought I nicked that round so I couldn't believe that scorecard. But I will come back, I have plenty of time on my side.\\" He was however himself considered fortunate by some to get through the 8th after a cut above his left eye left Anderson struggling to get through the round. British champion Anderson's next fight saw him defend his British title against Irishman and former WBU champion Eamonn Magee with Anderson claiming that the fight was a great improvement on his last saying \\"It was a great win. The key was just getting my head right...I was on my toes for the whole 12 rounds. It's a great achievement.\\" In September 2007 he followed the win up with another defence against England's Francis Jones in a fight that proved to be a lot tougher than might have first been thought. Anderson had Jones down in the 10th round before the referee stepped in to stop the fight in the 12th. Speaking after what was now his second defence of his title Anderson said \\"I was giving him some of my best shots but, to be fair to him, he kept taking them and coming back for more...I thought as the fight went into the later stages that his corner might have pulled him out but he kept coming back for more and more, so all credit to the lad. He gave it everything.\\" Fights with Kevin McIntyre Fellow Scot Kevin McIntyre stunned the British boxing in November 2007 when in what was to be Kevin Anderson's third defence of the title he found himself thoroughly outboxed and put down a number of times by the challenger. McIntyre himself had suffered a number of defeats in his boxing career and was thought to have found his level before winning a unanimous eventual decision to claim the title. An immediate rematch clause was applied and the two boxers found themselves facing each other once again in February 2008. The fight ended in another win for a delighted McIntyre who said after claiming another points win \\"I needed to prove the last fight wasn't a fluke...Anderson showed that he might have been under par in the first fight but he wasn't tonight, he showed that he was a tough fighter\\" The back to back defeats to McIntyre left Anderson needing to refocus and saw the former champion take some time off from the sport. Speaking to Boxing News about his break from the ring he said \\"I needed some time away, to spend with my two kids, to get my head right and around the McIntyre fights. I moved house, had a kid, moved house again, had another kid. I needed the break\\"Boxing News  Interview with Kevin Anderson See also * List of British welterweight boxing champions References Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish male boxers Category:Welterweight boxers Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Scotland Category:Boxers at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Category:Sportspeople from Kirkcaldy ","title":"Kevin Anderson (boxer)"},{"id":"20039633","text":"Flock, founded in 2002, is a biannual literary journal based in Jacksonville, Florida.

The Victorian Government has granted land of cultural significance for the Land Council to manage. These sites include: * the Sunbury earth rings, an important ceremonial place. * Coranderrk Aboriginal Station Cemetery in Healesville (1991) The council had a statutory role under Commonwealth legislation that gave it the power to grant or refuse consent to disturb Aboriginal sites. This gave the Council members a significant say in how their important cultural places were managed. The Victorian state government introduced the Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 and the Wurundjeri Council is now approved as a Registered Aboriginal Party under that Act, which will allow the council to continue to make decisions about its cultural places. However the decision recognised only the area not under dispute with other parties. The other parties include the Wathaurung/ Wathaurong people to the west, the Dja Dja Wurrung/ Jaara Jaara people to the north-west, the Taungurung people to the north, the Gunai/Kurnai people to the east and the Boon Wurrung/ Bunurong people to the south.

Plot  Charlie and Guddu are twins who were raised in Mumbai. Charlie lisps while Guddu stutters. Charlie likes to take shortcuts to fulfill his dream of becoming a bookmaker at the racecourse where he works for three criminal brothers who fix races. He is closer to the youngest brother Mikhail than to Guddu, to whom he is hostile. A jockey deceives Charlie when he bets on a horse during a fixed race, losing all of his savings. Seeking revenge, Charlie locates the jockey in an upmarket city hotel. At the same hotel, policemen Lobo and Lele kill three drug dealers and collect a guitar case containing cocaine, which they must deliver to drug lord Tashi. Charlie and his men invade the jockey's hotel room and take all his possessions. The ensuing chase leads to the hotel car park where Lobo and Lele are placing the guitar case in their van. Charlie and his men seize the van to escape from the jockey's men and realise they have stolen a police vehicle, whilst also discovering the cocaine, which Charlie steals to sell. The policemen, upon returning, discover that the cocaine is missing and set out to find Charlie. Meanwhile, Guddu's lover Sweety, sister of the politician Sunil Bhope, reveals that she is pregnant with Guddu's child and expresses her wish to marry Guddu. They marry later that night. Bhope hears about his sister's actions and sends his men to apprehend the lovers. Bhope's men gatecrash Guddu's wedding and beat him, then realise that he is a migrant from Uttar Pradesh. This enrages Bhope, who orders his men to kill Guddu and return Sweety to his house so he can arrange a marriage for her. Sweety fights off her brother's henchmen and escapes with Guddu. Charlie tells Mikhail about the cocaine, who is delighted. When Charlie returns to retrieve the case, Bhope and his men are waiting inside the van. One of Bhope's men recognises Guddu as Charlie's twin and Bhope demands that Charlie reveal Guddu's whereabouts. An inebriated Mikhail interrupts their conversation and is killed by Bhope. On the way to the airport, Guddu realises that Sweety has faked her stutter. At a petrol station, Lobo and Lele notice the pair. Mistaking Guddu for Charlie, they arrest him. They assault Guddu, refusing to believe that he is Charlie's twin brother until Guddu's mobile phone rings; the caller is revealed to be Bhope. Lobo and Lele agree to exchange Charlie for Guddu and Sweety on a train. The policemen take Guddu and Sweety to Bhope's house, where Bhope reveals that a local builder will pay him to marry Sweety to the builder's son. Guddu bargains with Bhopeif he retrieves the cocaine-filled guitar case for Bhope, he will get Sweety. Bhope sends his henchmen with Guddu to retrieve the guitar case from Charlie's house.

Bhardwaj liked Boy's approach to the script; Nair and Bhardwaj discussed it and thought it was a typical Bollywood masala film. Boy sent Bhardwaj another draft of his script. Three years later, Bhardwaj asked Boy to sell him the idea, and he later bought the script for US$4,000. Bhardwaj revisited the idea and added some Bollywood elements and a dark, serious side to the script. He worked on the original idea with writers Sabrina Dhawan, Abhishek Chaubey and Supratik Sen. He included Dhawan in writing the screenplay because as he thought she would give it a \\"solid structure\\". Bhardwaj said that during the writing of the screenplay, most of the original ideas were changed and the climax was \\"Indianized\\". His re-worked version now included one brother with a stammer and the other with a lisp. Bhardwaj said that despite the complicated structure, Kaminey is \\"anything but arty\\" and could not alienate audiences in any part of India, and that it is a simple story but with a complicated structure. Dhawan said that the film's script was complex and has multiple stories which required excessive writing and rewriting to make each character sound distinct. The media showed concern over the film's title, deeming it \\"odd\\", and some people were shocked because of the title, which can be translated into English as \\"mean\\". However, the makers said that \\"kaminey\\" is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment. According to Bhardwaj, the idea for the title came from a scene from Gulzar's Ijaazat (1987), in which the lead actor (Naseeruddin Shah) refers to the actress in a loving manner; it was the first time that he heard the word used that way. Bhardwaj told Rediff, \\"when the script of this film was written, it was like discovering your own mean side. The format of the film is of a caper and all the characters in this film, excluding one, has an agenda. So I thought it was an apt title for the film\\". = Casting = Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in the lead roles Shahid Kapoor was cast in the film's lead role. Several media outlets reported that Bhardwaj considered many actors before casting Kapoor in the role, which he refused. Bhardwaj refuted the claims, saying, \\"There is a huge difference between discussing and narrating and offering someone a film and I would like to clear up the rumour by saying that Kaminey was never offered to anyone else and so no one rejected it.\\" Kapoor said that he accepted the role after reading the script. Priyanka Chopra was cast to play Sweety, the lead female role. She initially turned down the role, saying she felt it was a boys' film and her eight-scene part did not seem good enough. However, Bhardwaj persuaded her to accept the role. The idea for casting the screenwriter Amole Gupte came from the casting director Honey Terhan. Gupte said that when he received a call from Terham, he thought it was a joke. He stated, \\"A man named Honey introduced himself as Vishal Bhardwaj's casting director and offered me a very important role. I banged the phone down not believing a word of what he said\\". However, after meeting Bhradwaj and hearing a script reading, he loved the story and accepted the offer. The actors Chandan Roy Sanyal, Shiv Subramnayam, Hrishikesh Joshi, Rajatava Dutta and Deb Mukherjee were cast in supporting roles. For the role of drug dealer Tashi, Bhardwaj chose his friend Tenzing Nimaa tour operator in Mussooriesaying he had the character and attitude he wanted, and a weird sense of humour. = Characters = Bhardwaj instructed the film's entire cast and crew to watch caper classics such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), Pulp Fiction (1994) and True Romance (1993) to study the nuances and become familiar with the genre. Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not want them to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie's physique was very different from Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult. Chopra described her character Sweety as \\"feisty and vivacious\\". She said, \\"Sweety is very busy, and does not have time to take care of her looks and apply make up. Her only aim in life is to bunk her lectures and visit her boyfriend's college or stay in his hotel, and eventually marry him.\\" Chopra described both her character and herself as being \\"outspoken and fun loving\\" as well as honest and unable to \\"hide something that is wrong\\". She said she had a different cultural background to Sweety, and found it challenging to convincingly portray a Maharashtrian Marathi girl. She had to adopt body language and a Maharashtrian accent to suit the character. She learnt the Marathi language to make the character as authentic as possible, which she found difficult. Chopra said: \\"I am speaking a lot of Marathi in the film. It was difficult for me because it's a difficult language and I am not good at Marathi. But I think it's my luck that through Kaminey I got to learn one more language.\\" Gupte described his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight. Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable and that it provided him with a foil to express rage and anguish. He worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from European and Japanese cinema. Chandan Roy Sanyal described his character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti- Narcotics Bureau. They said that to prepare for the roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script and understanding the characters, and discussing it with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid that he did not have much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him. = Filming = Principal photography commenced in mid-2008, and the film was mostly shot in Mumbai. During a late night shoot for a scene in Pune, Chopra received minor injuries. Chopra was supposed to ride a motorcycle with Kapoor seated on the pillion seat. Both fell off the motorcycle as it skidded on mud. Kapoor was unhurt but Chopra received scratch marks and bruises. It was reported that Kapoor suffered from several injuries while shooting. During filming, Chopra became hoarse because she had to scream her lines; an essential part of her role as an \\"extremely vocal Maharashtrian girl.\\" Some important railway sequences were shot at Wadi Bunder Yard near Sandhurst Road. Kapoor found filming for both of his characters at nearly the same time very difficult; he would shoot them on alternate days.  Themes and influences  According to the Hindustan Times, Kaminey \\"is the first attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner.\\" Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the antagonist is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in \\"layered and complex\\" situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's \\"enduring fascination for underdogs, characters on the margins of society and the morally compromised\\". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with \\"themes that affect our lives directly\\", and \\"is a reminder that we all have a dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side\\". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, \\"Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out.\\" He continued, \\"[w]ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film\\". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a \\"radically different and refreshing\\" way, and the director \\"daringly takes it a step further\\". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple \\"decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, it would have been a complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)\\" The Daily Beast said that \\"for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes‚Äîestranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy‚Äîand presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing. Bhardwaj has been influenced by many directorsincluding Manmohan Desai, Subhash Ghai, Quentin Tarantino and Francis Ford Coppolaand combines these influences in his work. Rakesh Bedi wrote that \\"Bhardwaj keeps displaying his vision throughout the film\\". Reviewers have compared the film's multi-plot narrative to those of several films by Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and the Coen Brothers. Reviewers said that the film mostly belongs to the level of Pulp Fiction; Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called it \\"Bollywood's first all-the-way-out-to-there pulp fiction\\". Bedi wrote, \\"there's Bu√±uel in the Bengali dons, there's Kurosawa ... in that surreal train car in which Charlie lives, there's Ray in money-floating dreams that Charlie has\\". Keshav Chaturvedi of the Hindustan Times compared the apocalyptical gang war in the climax to Apocalypse Now (1979). He said, \\"Bhardwaj just demolishes the cliches of Bollywood. In ripping apart the stereotype, he gives us a prototype: a Bollywood that deals with alienation, ... angst, ... and atrocity.\\" A review in The Times of India said that the film's climax reaches the level of Reservoir Dogs, and described it as \\"absolutely riveting stuff, with the camera going on a hitherto unexplored journey in Indian cinema.\\"  Soundtrack  Vishal Bhardwaj composed the music soundtrack for Kaminey and Gulzar wrote the lyrics. The album contains five original songs, two remixes and one theme song; it was released on 6 July 2009. The song \\"Dhan Te Nan\\" is a rehashed version of a song originally composed by Vishal Bhardwaj for an episode of the Zee TV series Gubbare. The soundtrack album was commercially successful after its release, especially \\"Dhan Te Nan\\", which topped the charts across various platforms. The soundtrack album received positive reviews from music critics. Rediff.com rated the album 4.5 out of 5, labelled it a \\"masterpiece\\" and wrote, \\"Bhardwaj has delivered a soundtrack that is lethally explosive. Not that we expected anything less. And trust Gulzar to artfully craft a really long fuse for the Kaminey bomb, making sure the tracks stay afire long before and after they actually go boom.\\" Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote, \\"Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album and this is where its prime strength lies. The album boasts of at least three chartbuster tracks'Dhan Te Nan' (sure shot superhit), 'Thode Bheege' (must for the hearts in love) and 'Raat Ke Dhai Baje' (for some 'masti' and 'hungama'). Songs like 'Fatak' and 'Kaminey' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj. Add to that the 'Go Charlie Go ‚Äì Theme Music' and you know that Kaminey is yet another addition to some excellent albums that have hit the stands during last one month.\\" Planet Bollywood rated the album 8.5 out of 10 and said it is the best soundtrack released that year, and that \\"[i]t has experimentations with both music and lyrics\\". Indo-Asian News Service praised the soundtrack and said that \\" ... \\"Kaminey\\" is easily among 2009's finest scores. Experimental in its sound, yet very mainstream in appeal. Vishal Bhardwaj has proved his mettle yet again.\\"  Marketing and release  The teaser poster of Kaminey was received positively by critics. The trailer, which introduces four characters; one lisping, one stuttering, a woman yelling about having raped a man and one jeering at the lisper, received positive reviews. Critics kept their expectations high due to Bhardwaj's previous films, and said the trailer was like a comic book which introduces the characters of Kapoor and Chopra differently. The theatrical trailers and the music generated interest for the film. The film's marketing also involved public appearances by Chopra and Kapoor. The makers of the film were disappointed by the Censor Board for Film Certification's decision to grant the film an \\"A\\" certificatemeant for viewers 18 years or olderinstead of a \\"U/A\\" certificate that they had expected. Bhardwaj said, \\"It was injustice to us. There is no abusive language used in the film and the violence is of 'comic book kind'.\\" The Censor Board asked him to replace dialogue which mentioned the city of Pilibhitwhich they said was a sensitive constituencywith a fictitious city name. He replaced Pilibhit with Barabanki.\\" The film was subject to some controversies. A First Information Report was filed by Jagannath Sena Sangathan at a police station in Puri against the film for allegedly denigrating Lord Jagannath. According to them, a scene in which the text \\"Apna Hath Jagannath\\" is seen in a toilet on a semi-clad model had hurt religious sentiments. The objectionable portion of the scene was removed from the prints released in the state of Orissa. A complaint supported by a caste group backed by a Samajwadi Party MP about the use of the name of a community \\"teli\\" in the song \\"Dhan Te Nan\\"which was considered derogatory to the Teli communitywas filed with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The Censor Board reacted to the complaint, insisting on the replacement of the word, which was later replaced with \\"Dilli\\". Kaminey was scheduled to release on 5 June 2009. However, the release was postponed because of problems between the producers and multiplexes in India. The film was released on 14 August 2009 on 1,200 screens worldwide. Because of the 2009 flu pandemic, the film was not released in the Maharashtra regionincluding Mumbai and Punebecause the multiplexes in these cities were closed by the Maharashtra government for three days as part of precautionary measures against swine flu. Moser Baer Home Videos released Kaminey on DVD in October 2009 across all regions in a two-disc pack complying with the NTSC format. One disc contains the film; the other has additional content including a \\"making of the film\\" documentary, the original beginning and deleted scenes. VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time. Bollywood Hungama critic Joginder Tuteja rated the DVD 4 out of 5, praising the bonus features and the packaging. Airtel Digital TV premi√®red the film on its Pay Per View service on 12 September 2009. The Indian television premi√®re of the film was on Colors on 28 February 2010. The film is also available on Netflix.  Critical reception  Kaminey received widespread critical acclaim from critics who praised many aspects of the film. Raja Sen of Rediff.com rated the film 4.5 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Kaminey is startlingly clever, an innovative film with genuine surprises. A kind of film whose success we ought all pray for, because it'll prove smart cinema works.\\" The Indian Express gave a rating of 4 out of 5, calling it \\"Bollywood's first all-the-way-out-to-there pulp fiction\\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 4 stars out of 5, called it a \\"must watch\\" and wrote, \\"[i]t's an unpredictable crime drama that combines violence and dark humor in a manner that's reminiscent of the films of Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and the Coen Brothers. And yet Kaminey is so original and inventive in the manner in which it takes Bollywood's favorite formulatwin brothersand turns it on its head.\\" He praised the writingwhich he said was the film's real strength, the non- linear screenplay and the dialogue, and wrote that the film has \\"the best performance you will see by an ensemble cast in a long time\\". Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India rated the film 4 out of 5, and said it is \\"Bollywood's first film which is full of brains, brawn and belligerence besides being a bravura attempt to rewrite the tried and tested idiom of desi movielore. Kaminey is a smart and balsy film that brings Hollywood to Bollywood which catapult the viewer into the dark, violent world of crime and criminals, leaving you no time to blink or breathe easy ... Tarantino, take a bow. Brave new Bollywood is here.\\" Anupama Chopra gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and wrote \\"Kaminey is the best Bollywood film I've seen this year. It's an audacious, original rollercoaster ride. Written and directed by Vishal Bharadwaj, Kaminey requires patience and attention but the pay off is more than worth it.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4 out of 5 and wrote \\"Kaminey is bold, stark, funny and unpredictable and is a film with an attitude. Like it or leave it, but you'd never be able to ignore it. Word from the wise: Go for this hatke (different) experience!\\" Zee News also rated the film 4 out of 5 and said, \\"Bhardwaj has once again delivered a powerful film that completely bowls you over with its splendid script, riveting narrative and stellar performances by lead pairShahid and Priyanka [who] have a cracking on-screen chemistry that certainly reminds you of yesteryears on-screen couples.\\" The review also said, \\"Kaminey is an engrossing flick that does not let you move from your seat!\\" Kaveree Bamzai of India Today rated the film 4 out of 5 and said it \\"is dark, melodramatic, poetic and ultimately operatic\\". He also said, \\"Its lyrics are the blow-up-your-brains-out kind ... and its music, composed by the multi-talented Bharadwaj is perfectly in sync with a narrative that doesn't pause for breath.\\" Namrata Joshi from Outlook gave a rating of 4 out 5 and called Kaminey \\"a strikingly anarchic, unusually energetic, quirky and frenetic film\\". Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu gave the film 4 stars and wrote, \\"Kaminey takes the post-postmodern noir genre to a whole new level, to a sophistication the Indian audience isn't used to. Watch it at least twice to fully appreciate this masterpiece.\\" Writing for Variety, critic Joe Leydon described the film as a \\"tasty cinematic masala that is energetically entertaining, if not consistently coherent\\".  Box office  Kaminey was successful throughout India, with occupancy around 90% across multiplexes. The film was successful across most single screens, and collected in India during the opening weekend. In its first week of release, the film collected in India.

Legacy  Film director Shekhar Kapur praised the film, saying, \\"Kaminey catapults Indian Cinema in modernity beyond Tarantino\\". He said that Kaminey would be able to compete with any film in the world in terms of its design, performances, inherent narratives, editing and pace. Filmmaker Karan Johar labelled it a cult film, describing it as \\"edgy ... cult and geniusely performed and executed!

SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, TWIN RIDGES ELEMENTARY Works His 1971 book The Scottish Enlightenment and the American College Ideal, which argued that American education owed its roots to influential Presbyterian Scots who never feared an educated populace unlike their counterparts in the Anglican church, was a contribution to a larger ongoing intellectual discussion about Scottish and American relations (e.g., Ian Charles Cargill Graham's 1956 Colonists from Scotland: Emigration to North America, 1707‚Äì1783 and Andrew Hook‚Äôs 1975 Scotland and America: A Study of Cultural Relations, 1750‚Äì1835).Scots in the North American West, 1790-1917: 1790-1917, Ferenc Morton Szasz, University of Oklahoma Press, 2000, , , 272 pages In the mid-1980s Sloan edited the collection of essays published as The Computer in Education: a Critical Perspective (Columbia University Press, 1985). His 1994 book Faith and Knowledge: Mainline Protestantism and American Higher Education focuses on the rise and fall of various mainline American Protestant churches' engagements with higher education, noting that this now almost forgotten and often overlooked theological renaissance‚Äîbegun by evangelicals of neo-orthodoxy in the 1930s‚Äîwould fully blossom in March 1953 with the launch of an essentially new journal The Christian Scholar. Its morph into the journal Soundings fifteen years later would signal the renaissance's abrupt end.Faith and Knowledge, Douglas Sloan, Westminster John Knox Press, 1994. , .

It is a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. The barn, of coursed and squared rubble, was originally built in the 14th and 15th centuries to hold the produce from farms in the area who paid one tenth of their produce to Glastonbury Abbey as the landowner. It is one of four surviving monastic barns built by the Abbey, the others being the Tithe Barn, Manor Farm, Doulting, the West Pennard Court Barn and the Glastonbury tithe barn, now the Somerset Rural Life Museum. Restoration On 9 June 1963 lightning set fire to the thatched roof and it remained a wreck until Michael Eavis, organiser of the Glastonbury Festival, bought it in 1995, and presented the barn to the Pilton Barn Trust. The project was made possible with a grant of ¬£400,000 from English Heritage. The Glastonbury festival contributed a further ¬£100,000. A new roof, replicating the original, using a combination of traditional carpentry techniques and modern technology, has been built, by Peter McCurdy using skills used when recreating the Globe theatre in London, from English oak which came from Northumberland. The roof frame consists of cruck construction which sits high in the walls with an arcade plate then carrying the apex of the roof above. McCurdy was also assisted by a local team run by Jon MaineMaine has recently saved Grade 2* Merchants House in Shepton Mallet who designed and erected the complex scaffolding both internally and externally and then using 8000 36\\" long oak hand split (riven) battens tiled the roof using over 30,000 hand made plain tiles. In addition to the new roof a new floor was laid, including a wide strip in Blue Lias Stone and 44 cubic meters of lime concrete used to fill the expanses either side. It is said to be the largest expanse of lime concrete flooring anywhere in Europe. The restoration was nominated for the annual Wood Awards, which recognise and encourage outstanding design, craftmanship and installation in joinery and structures in wood. It was awarded the prize as the Best Use of British Timber Award and Structural Timber Award in 2005. It also received the Royal Institute of British Architects Town and Country Design Award in the same year. It was officially opened on Friday 1 April 2005 by local historian Sir John Keegan and is now used for public events such as medieval fairs, dances, weddings, parties, Somerset Arts Week and village events.

In 1912 she was sold and became the cruise ship The Viking. Toward the end of 1914 she was requisitioned and converted into the armed merchant cruiser HMS Viknor. She sank in 1915 with all hands, a total of 295 Royal Navy officers and men. Building In the 1880s RMSP introduced a series of larger new ships to improve its scheduled services between Southampton, South America and the Caribbean. The first was the , built by Caird and Company and . She was RMSP's first new ship to have a hull of steel rather than iron. After her success RMSP ordered two more ships to an improved and enlarged version of the design from Robert Napier and Sons of Govan. Atrato was , followed by . Before these were completed RMSP ordered two more from Napier: the slightly larger in 1889 and . Orinoco had only a small amount of deck housing and was the last square-rigged sail-steamer to be built for RMSP. The Napier ships were more modern, each with a full superstructure deck and rigged as a three-masted schooner. The smaller sail plan was based on the increasing economy and reliability of their engines. Atratos boilers had a working pressure of 150 lbf/in2. She had eight of them, supplying steam to one three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine that drove a single screw. This gave her a top speed of on trials and a service speed of . The ship's passenger capacity included 176 in first-class staterooms and nearly 400 emigrants in steerage class. Her cargo capacity was 2,524 tons and her coal bunkers 1,109 tons. She had of refrigerated storage space for provisions, using a dry-air refrigeration system with a discharge rate of of air per hour. She had tanks for of fresh water. Atrato was launched on 22 September 1888, named after the Atrato River in Colombia. RMSP named all of its ships after rivers; many of them with Hispanic names to reflect its trade with Latin America. Civilian service Atratos maiden voyage began from Southampton on 17 January 1889. As well as her passengers, mails and a full cargo she carried in her strong room ¬£120,000 in sovereigns, jewellery worth ¬£2,000 and silver bars worth ¬£400. She called at Carril, Vigo and Lisbon, and then crossed the Atlantic to South America. There she worked her way down the east coast, calling at Pernambuco, Macei√≥, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Montevideo and Buenos Aires. Magdalena, Thames and Clyde joined the same South American route over the next 18 months, but after her maiden voyage Atrato was switched to join Orinoco on RMSP's Caribbean route. All five sisters had long and successful careers. The five ships' furnaces suffered from heat damage, so in 1891 they were lined with zinc. In 1899 Day, Summers and Company of Southampton raised the boats on Atrato, Magdalena, Thames and Clyde \\"to a boat deck clear of the promenade\\" at a cost of more than ¬£5,000. In 1903 Atrato, Magdalena and Clyde were fitted with bronze propellers costing another ¬£5,000. In May 1905 RMSP ordered insulation and refrigeration to be fitted to part of their cargo space to enable Orinoco and Atrato to carry fresh fruit. In October 1912 the Viking Cruising Company of London bought Atrato and renamed her The Viking. She became a cruise ship, touring the waters of northern Europe. Naval service and loss The Norwegian liner , which Viknor detained in 1915 When the UK entered the First World War in 1914 the Admiralty requisitioned her, had her re-fitted as an armed merchant cruiser and commissioned her as HMS Viknor. She was placed under the command of Commander EO Ballantyne with a complement of 22 officers and 273 ratings and assigned to the 10th Cruiser Squadron. On 28 December 1914 Viknor went on patrol from the River Tyne, and on 1 January she joined \\"B\\" patrol off the north coast of Scotland. The patrol was ordered to find and stop the neutral Norwegian America Line ship , which the UK Government believed was carrying a suspected German spy. Viknor found Bergensfjord, detained her and escorted her to Kirkwall in Orkney. There the suspect and a number of other prisoners were transferred to Viknor, which then left for Liverpool. Viknor never reached her destination. On 13 January 1915 she sank with all hands in heavy seas off Tory Island, County Donegal, Ireland. She sent no distress signal. Some wreckage and many corpses washed ashore on the northern coast of Ireland. It is thought she struck a German naval mine, possibly one of those laid by the German auxiliary cruiser Berlin. ‚Äì includes photo of the ship in Palmers Dock, Hebburn Her wreck was found ‚Äì photographs of Atrato and her wreck in 2006, and in 2011 a scuba diver placed a White Ensign on it in memory of her complement. ‚Äì placing of a White Ensign on the wreck by scuba diver Stewart Andrews References Sources and further reading  * External links * Category:1888 ships Category:Auxiliary cruisers of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built in Govan Category:Maritime incidents in 1915 Category:Passenger ships of the United Kingdom Category:Ships lost with all hands Category:Ships of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company Category:Ships sunk by mines Category:Shipwrecks of Ireland Category:Steamships of the United Kingdom Category:World War I naval ships of the United Kingdom Category:World War I shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean Category:Protected Wrecks of the United Kingdom ","title":"RMS Atrato (1888)"},{"id":"20040182","text":"Margot Trooger (2 June 1923 - 24 April 1994) was a German film actress.

Another 10% were Japanese civil servants on overseas postings, researchers, and students. The remainder were long-term residents, largely Japanese women married to Dutch men. Most live in Amsterdam.

Oudenstaart 1, 5000LJ Tilburg\\" and formerly at .  Employment  The workplace is one of the most important sites of cross-cultural encounters for Japanese working in the Netherlands. Japanese company offices in the Netherlands are generally small in size, numbering less than 100 employees. The decision-making processes in Japanese and Dutch corporate cultures are superficially similar, both relying on achieving consensus from stakeholders and subordinates rather than devolving decision-making authority to a single person. The need for Japanese expatriate middle-managers to refer plans back to headquarters in Japan, in addition to the emphasis on collective responsibility for the results of plans agreed to by consensus, means that decision-making in Japanese companies proceeds more slowly than in Dutch companies. Nevertheless, Dutch employees in Japanese companies perceive the decision-making process as achieving better and more thorough results despite its slow pace. Japanese expatriate employees in the Netherlands put in longer hours than local employees. Dutch employees feel that their Japanese superiors and colleagues put in such long hours because they use their time inefficiently; furthermore, they feel little pressure to adopt those same working hours, asserting that the Japanese managers simply receive more benefits and salary in line with their increased responsibility. However, their Japanese colleagues resent this attitude, feeling that Dutch colleagues \\"leave work undone on their desk and go home\\", leaving it for the late-working Japanese to complete. Japanese managers find they have to delineate job requirements and responsibilities more explicitly for Dutch employees than they would for Japanese employees in Japan, due to the local cultural emphasis on individual responsibility above collective responsibility.  Cuisine  As of 2000, when eating outside the home, Japanese expatriates in the Netherlands most commonly patronise Chinese restaurants (29% of meals eaten out); Japanese restaurants run a close second at 25%, Italian restaurants at 19%, and French restaurants at 10%. However, they deride the Japanese restaurants of the Netherlands as low-quality and expensive. They also cook Japanese food at home, though in a pattern different from that in Japan; they consume less fish and more meat dishes (especially nikujaga), and often have to find substitutes for preferred vegetables which are unavailable locally. Preparing Japanese food is often viewed as troublesome due to these limitations, and many Japanese wives express that they only prepare such dishes because their husbands prefer them; when the husbands are away, they cook Western-style food instead. However, the community in Amsterdam at least have some Japanese-style grocery stores available locally. For the community in Maastricht, fewer such options are available; many cross the border to Germany to do their shopping in D√ºsseldorf and take advantage of the many specialised grocery shops which have popped up to serve the city's significant Japanese community, or band together and order groceries‚Äîespecially fish prepared in the Japanese style‚Äîto be shipped down from Amsterdam. Another common option is to grow herb seasonings, especially garland chrysanthemum, perilla, and cryptotaenia, in one's own back garden.

The approximately Middleton, William D. (1967). The Time of the Trolley, p. 195. Milwaukee, WI (US): Kalmbach Publishing Co. LCCN 67-20155. tunnel connects Station Square to South Hills Junction, and is used only by Pittsburgh Light Rail cars and buses of the Port Authority of Allegheny County. With the cessation of bus service on the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel in 2019, the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel is the only tunnel in the United States to operate both bus and rail services. History The tunnel was built by Booth and Flinn for Pittsburgh Railways to overcome the barrier of Mount Washington to the development of electric streetcar services to points south. Excavation was started October 6, 1902, and the tunnel was officially opened December 1, 1904. The tunnel was paved around the rails to allow for joint use by bus and trolley traffic in 1973. The Transit tunnel is located almost in line with the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel, which was at a much higher elevation. That tunnel was originally a coal mine accessed from the top of an incline on the river side. It was later opened at the back and used to run through to other coal mines in the Saw Mill Run valley. The Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad operated passenger service through the tunnel from 1873 until 1892, after which passengers journeyed instead via the new Castle Shannon Incline, while coal trains continued to use the old route through the tunnel. From 1909 the main passenger service became Pittsburgh Railways streetcars running from the Transit Tunnel into the Castle Shannon route at South Hills Junction. Because of the related nature of the two tunnels, an urban legend persists that the Transit Tunnel was originally a coal mine. Accidents Northern exit of tunnel in 1968 showing site of both accidents Two spectacular runaway accidents are associated with the tunnel, which is on a steep gradient averaging over 6 percent, and curves as the north portal is reached. On December 24, 1917, Knoxville service car 4236 ran away downhill after becoming detached from the wire and derailed and overturned on the curve into Carson Street. The car slid on its side until hitting a telegraph pole which ripped the roof off. Twenty-one people were killed and 80 were injured; the claims from the accident sent Pittsburgh Railways into receivership. On October 29, 1987, a 1700-series all-electric PCC car began to exceed the tunnel's speed limit as it entered the south portal after departing South Hills Junction. The operator, realizing the car could neither stop nor take the sharp curve from the transitway to the Panhandle Bridge ramp, ordered all the passengers to move to the back, and radioed the PAT central dispatcher to clear Station Square. The car left the rails and took Smithfield Street instead (the trolleys' original route downtown, until 1985), crossing Carson Street, sideswiping a PAT bus and a truck, and knocking out a fire hydrant. Miraculously, the car stayed on its wheels, and finally stopped next to the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, the former Pittsburgh and Lake Erie station building at Station Square. Thirty-seven people were injured, four seriously, but there were no fatalities. All three braking systems on the car had failed: the drum, dynamic, and magnetic rail brakes. Most of the 1700 series cars were found to have electrical defects, prompting PAT to retire all of their remaining PCC's that had not been rebuilt as 4000 series cars. Consequently, PAT was left with a shortage of cars, which contributed to the closure of the Overbrook line in 1993.

Rugby career Harris played for Aberavon during their 'golden era' which saw the team crowned Welsh Club Champions four consecutive years from the 1923/24 to the 1926/27 season. While playing for Aberavon, Harris was awarded his one and only Welsh cap against the Touring Australian Waratahs. The match took place on 26 November 1927 at the Cardiff Arms Park, and although the Welsh forwards showed strength and commitment, were out- classed by the tourist back play. In 1931, while still with Aberavon, Harris was part of the joint Neath / Aberavon team that narrowly lost to the 1931 touring South Africans. Harris was challenged to the position by Neath's Cliff Evans, but Harris was considered more experienced and tougher.Billot (1974), pg 166. The match was a close contest, and with three minuted left on the clock the score line was 3-3 after the Welsh side had taken an early lead; but the tourist fought back and scored a try with the last move of the game. During the match, Harris and his Aberavon team mate Wilf Selby were considered the better pairing than the South African duo of Danie Craven and Bennie Osler, but the Welsh team's threequarter line was believed to have let them down with slow distribution.Billot (1974), pg 169. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 466. * New South Wales Waratahs 1927 =The Tal Harris Appreciation Society= The Tal Harris Appreciation Society was formed in 1994, dedicated to the memory of Tal Harris.

He appeared in more than 280 films between 1921 and 1970. Biography Meyerinck was born in Potsdam, Brandenburg, the son of Friedrich von Meyerinck (1858‚Äì1928), Hauptmann (Captain) in the Prussian Army. He grew up at his family's estates in the Province of Posen and attended the gymnasium secondary school in Godeberg. Having passed his Abitur exams, he was called up for military service as a cadet in World War I, but soon was dismissed due to a pulmonary disease. In 1917 he gave his debut as a theatre actor at the Schauspielhaus in Berlin and from 1918 to 1920 continued his career at the Hamburg Kammerspiele. Back in Berlin he performed in avant-garde plays by Carl Sternheim, as well as in several revue entertainments and kabarett venues. Later he returned to classical theatre with engagements at the Deutsches Theater and the Lessing Theater, performing as The Imaginary Invalid, Mephistopheles, but also as Captain of K√∂penick or as Meckie Messer in Brecht's Threepenny Opera. From 1920 onwards, Meyerinck starred as a silent film actor, whereby he developed a distinctive appearance with his high forehead and moustache, often emphasizing his hypnotic expression by sporting a monocle. He was able to continue his career in the sound film era by his unmistakable rasping voice, which perfectly added to his physiognomy, having a standing order for scoundrels and charlatan roles. Commonly identified as a homosexual he ran the risk to be imprisoned by the Nazi authorities like his friend Kurt von Ruffin, nevertheless, he performed in numerous entertainment films of Nazi cinema. After World War II, Meyerinck remained one of the busiest film actors in West German cinema. He starred as quirky official, devious noble or impostor in numerous film comedies, often together with Peter Alexander and young Ilja Richter but also in several Edgar Wallace films of the 1960s. The magazine Der Spiegel called Meyernick's role in numerous films a \\"comical Erich von Stroheim, who parodied Prussianism and made it ridiculous\\". He also continued as a theatre actor, from 1966 in the ensemble of the Thalia Theater in Hamburg. Hubert von Meyernick made one of his few Hollywood film appearances in Billy Wilder's film satire One, Two, Three (1961), portraying in a memorable supporting role the penniless aristocrat Count Waldemar von und zu Droste-Schattenburg, who adopts Horst Buchholz for financial reasons. Meyernicks skills in English were rather bad, so he was dubbed by German-American actor Sig Ruman. The Jewish Billy Wilder spoke about Meyernick in a 1997 interview with Der Spiegel: \\"I remember a gay actor, we called him Hubsi, Hubert von Meyernick. He never vaunted himself for that, but during the Kristallnacht he went along the Kurf√ºrstendamm and called: If somebody among you is Jewish, follow me! He cached the people in his apartment. Yes, there were decent people, whose words you could believe, that it was hard to do resistance during that time. People like Meyernick were marvelous, wonderful.\\"Der Spiegel ‚ÄûIch erinnere mich an einen schwulen Schauspieler, den wir ‚ÄûHubsi‚Äú nannten, Hubert von Meyerinck. Er hat sich selbst dessen nie ger√ºhmt, aber in der Kristallnacht ist er √ºber den Kurf√ºrstendamm gelaufen und hat gerufen: ‚ÄûWer auch immer unter Ihnen j√ºdisch ist, folgen Sie mir.‚Äú Er hat die Leute in seiner Wohnung versteckt. Ja, es hat sie gegeben, die anst√§ndigen Menschen, deren Worten man glauben konnte, da√ü es schwierig war, Widerst√§ndler zu werden in jener Zeit. Menschen wie Meyerinck waren herrlich, wunderbar.‚Äú Meyerinck died from heart failure in Hamburg. He is buried in the Schladen cemetery near Braunschweig.

He is credited with firing the first recorded gunshot ever from an airplane showing that a plane would not break up due to the gun's recoil. Biography Fickel enlisted in the Regular Army when he was twenty one years of age. He served as a private, corporal, sergeant, and first sergeant of Company K, 27th Infantry. He was stationed at Fort Hayes, Fort Sheridan and Fort Leavenworth. In 1907 Fickel was commissioned as a second lieutenant of Infantry. He then joined the 29th Infantry at Fort Douglas. In August of that year he went with that regiment for the Philippine Islands and served at Fort William McKinley with 2d Lt. Henry H. Arnold. In 1909 Fickel returned to the United States for station at Fort Jay on Governors Island in New York harbor. He was there through 1911. He then went to Fort Niagara until November 1913. Fickel then went for a second tour of duty in the Philippine Islands with the 13th Infantry. He served at Fort William McKinley again and at Camp McGrath until March 1917. He was then assigned to duty as an instructor at the Officers Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison. There he remained until November of that year. Fickel was then ordered to Washington, D.C., for duty with the headquarters of the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. He served in that capacity until May 1918. Fickel was next ordered to Rockwell Field in California as a student officer at the flying school. Upon completion of his course in November 1918 he assumed command of Carruthers Field in Texas where he remained until January 1919. Fickel was then ordered back to Washington, D.C. There he served in the Office of the Chief of Air Service until March 1921. His next duty was with the Spruce Production Corporation Portland, Oregon. There he served until the summer of 1922. He then returned to Washington for a two-year tour of duty as Chief of the Supply Division of the Air Service. In June 1925 Fickel graduated from the Air Corps Technical School at Langley Field. In June 1926 he also graduated with honors from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth. His next tour of duty was to serve as executive officer of the Materiel Division at McCook Field until April 1927. He then attended the Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field in Texas for three months. Fickel then returned to McCook Field where he reassumed his duties as executive officer, Materiel Division, for a period of three years. Fickel then attended the Army War College in Washington, D.C. He graduated in June 1931. His next duty was as Chief of the Buildings and Grounds Division in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps, Washington, D.C. He was there until January 1935. From February 1935 to June 1936, Fickel was Commandant of the Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field. His next tour of duty was as Air Officer of the Ninth Corps Area, with headquarters at the Presidio of San Francisco, California. He was there until March 1939. He was then assigned to command the 1st Wing, General Headquarters Air Force at March Field in California. In February 1940, he was appointed Assistant Chief of Air Corps in Washington, D.C. He was later assigned to Riverside, California, in 1940, as Air District Commander, becoming the first Commanding General of the Fourth Air Force on December 18, 1940. After an inordinately high rate of accidents involving Lockheed P-38 Lightnings in his command, he was relieved of command on April 2, 1942, on the orders of his friend Hap Arnold, now commanding the Army Air Forces, and reassigned to command the District No. 3 (Western) Technical Training Command, Oklahoma, on March 5, 1942. Fickel retired in 1946. Notability Lieutenant Jacob Earl Fickel with Glenn H. Curtiss experimenting shooting from an airplane in 1910 Fickel is credited with firing the first recorded gunshot ever from an airplane on August 20, 1910.Caidin, p. 7 Lieutenant J. E. Fickel of the 29th Infantry flew with Glenn H. Curtiss at the old at Sheepshead Bay Race Track near New York City, on August 20, 1910, to become the first man to fire a rifle from an airplane in flight. From his passenger seat he fired a rifle twice at a target from an altitude of 100 feet with Glenn H. Curtiss flying the airplane. It was done at Sheepshead Bay Race Track near New York City. This proved that a gun could be fired from an airplane without the plane breaking up into pieces due to the gun‚Äôs recoil.Caidin, p. 7 He repeated the feat at an air show in the summer of 1911 at Nassau Boulevard airfield on Long Island with Arnold at the controls. Competing against a team of Britons, Thomas Sopwith and Malcolm Campbell, the Americans won easily when Fickel displayed a skill that enabled him to put six bullets through a dinner plate from an aircraft flying off the ground.Coffey, Thomas M. (1982). Hap: The Story of the U.S. Air Force and the Man Who Built It General Henry H. 'Hap' Arnold. Viking Press, , p. 51. Fickel became the first aerial gunner in America. These experiments led to low recoil machine guns. Soon thereafter machine guns were added to planes for air-to-ground attack or air-to-air fighting. The first airplane machine guns were patented by Samuel Neal McClean. He sold his rights to the Automatic Arms Company in late 1910. Issac N. Lewis working for the company later improved the technology on this airplane machine gun system. The first use of an airplane machine gun in combat was in August 1914 with the first recorded airplane shot down in air- to-air fighting in October of that year. By 1915 air combat was an integral part of World War I fighting. Gen. Fickel was the brother-in-law of glider pioneer, Lawrence Malcolm Allison, of Lawrence, Kansas.

It stands at the edge of Bi≈°ƒáe plain and is one of the most valuable mixed urban and rural structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina, distinguished from other similar structures in its urban layout.Regional Programme for Cultural and Natural Heritage in South East Europe 2003 - 2006 Blagaj was most likely named for its mild weather patterns since blaga in Serbo-Croatian means \\"mild\\".Visit Mostar Blagaj is situated at the spring of the Buna river and a historical tekke (tekija or Dervish monastery). The Blagaj Tekija was built around 1520, with elements of Ottoman architecture and Mediterranean style and is considered a national monument. Blagaj Tekke is a monastery built for the Dervish. Sources Vrelo Bune, the source of the Buna river, is a strong karstic spring. The river flows west for approximately and joins the Neretva near the village Buna. The historic site of the Blagaj Fort (also Stjepan-grad or Stipan-grad), on the hill above Blagaj, was the seat of Grand Duke of Bosnia, Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá, and the birthplace of Bosnian queen Katarina Kosaƒça- Kotromaniƒá.  History  Blagaj Street During the classical antiquity there existed an Illyrian fortress and a Roman castrum. During the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian, several fortified towns were built in the area. Blagaj was mentioned in Constantine Porphyrogenitus‚Äô work De Administrando Imperio as Bona, then part of Zahumlje (Hum). In the late 12th century, during the rule of Stefan Nemanja (Grand Principality of Serbia), prefect Jurko raised a church dedicated to saints Cosmas and Damian. In the 14th century, during the reign of Bosnian Ban Stjepan II Kotromaniƒá, Hum became part of the Bosnian state. In the 15th century Sandalj Hraniƒá Kosaƒça and his nephew Stephen Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça ruled the Hum and Blagaj territory until the arrival of the Ottomans in 1466. Blagaj is also known as a residential area of Bosnian rulers and particularly of royal families Hraniƒá and Kosaƒça. In historical sources Blagaj was first mentioned in 1423. During the period of the Ottoman Empire, Blagaj was the seat of the Blagaj Vilayet, and was divided into several neighborhoods. The city had seven mosques, two inns, four musafirhana (guest houses), a madrasa (Bosnian: medresa), two maktab, seven mills and four stone bridges on the river Buna. Bosniaks were majority until 1835, during the Austro-Hungarian period Christians constituted twice as many. An Orthodox Church was built in 1893 and a Roman Catholic church in 1908.  Architecture  The earliest Blagaj settlement was located at the foot of the Blagaj fort, where the road runs down from the fort and intersects with the Nevesinje road. There was too little trade for a commercial centre to emerge and in an agricultural environment of this kind the circumstances did not give rise to an urban settlement. The urbanization of the area (in the form we know today) was defined in the second half of the 15th century, and its structure was shaped during the 16th century. Source of the Buna river and the Blagaj Tekija The historic site of the Old Blagaj Fort (Stjepan grad) - Unlike other fortifications serving as residences in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Blagaj fortress is located on a natural level area above steep cliffs to the south, west and north. The walls have survived for much of their length to a height of 12 or 14 m. The interior defended area is relatively small, similar to that of the fortress in Jajce.Regional Programme for Cultural and Natural Heritage in South East Europe 2003 - 2006 Historical sources frequently refer to mediaeval fortress Blagaj Fort (Stjepan grad) as a distinct territorial entity. During the Ottoman period construction of buildings was initiated in the fortress outskirts (houses and public edifices. The residential areas were formed as urban quarters or mahalas, with buildings facing inwards - onto their courtyards. Resident complexes display evidence of a high standard of living and the Velagiƒá house complex is one of the most valuable of this type in Herzegovina. The town mostly developed along the right bank of river Buna because the left bank is somewhat steeper and less suitable for construction. Public buildings were positioned quite deliberately within the urban structure as a whole. Among the first edifices was the Careva (Imperial) mosque constructed in 1521, which helped the settlement acquire the status of kasaba. It was followed by the construction of Karaƒëoz-beg bridge from 1570 and then the Leho bridge. Using bold structural solutions played a vital role in architecture of Blagaj: addition of pillars and vaults, along with other structural elements, is quite evident. Barrel vaults, which were common in mosques, the tekke and the hammam ‚Äì were raised to a high degree of perfection and made an entirely free ground plan possible. The synchronization of artisan crafts and construction techniques on the one hand and the development of the settlement on the other has left a mark on the Blagaj's image as a distinctive urban centre in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the reign of Austro-Hungarian Empire, Blagaj still retained its oriental-settlement character in its overall appearance as well as in its architectural and compositional details despite the obvious deterioration of the urban fabric.UNESCO: The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj  See also  * Neretva * Mostar * Buna, Mostar * Poƒçitelj * Stolac * Vrelo Bune * Buna * Vrelo Bunice * Bunica * Trebi≈æat * Bregava * Hutovo Blato References External links *Virtual tour of the Blagaj Tekke Category:Mostar Category:Geography of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Archaeological sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:World Heritage Tentative List for Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:World Heritage Tentative List ","title":"Blagaj"},{"id":"20040569","text":"Roshnik is a former municipality in Berat County, central Albania.

Resulting from an unusually explosive eruption, they may be associated with a series of battles in the area in 1790. Background The 1782 Battle of Moku≈çhai gave Kamehameha I control of the west and north sides of the island of Hawaii, but Ke≈çua Kuahuula and his uncle Keawemauhili were able to escape. For a few years, Kamehameha was occupied with Maui and the arrival of Europeans to Kona, Ke≈çua ruled Ka≈´ and Keawemauhili ruled Hilo. Keawemauhili finally recognized Kamehameha as his help. This angered Ke≈çua who raided some of the lands of Kamehameha while he was in Maui at the Battle of Kepaniwai. Ke≈çua then attacked and killed his uncle at Hilo. Kamehameha returned from Maui to the Big Island, and Ke≈çua ambushed them in a thick forest of Paauhau, but the battle was inconclusive (near coordinates ). Kamehameha counterattacked and drove Ke≈çua back, in what is known as the Battle of Koapapa ªa. Kamehameha had brought a cannon salvaged from the ship ' captured at Ka≈´p≈´lehu. Ke≈çua captured the piece, but did not have gunpowder nor expertise to use it effectively. After heavy losses on both sides, the commanders each decided to retreat to their secure territory. The footprints were thought to have been left by Ke≈çua's forces in their retreat. While passing Kƒ´lauea, they made offerings to the goddess Pele and made camp. As the volcano started to erupt, they thought they might have made some offense, so he split his group into three and stayed to make more offerings. Two parties of warriors were overwhelmed by a pyroclastic eruption while crossing the desert. Only one party of three survived the eruption. The footprints were attributed by early geologist Thomas Jaggar to those warriors who were killed in this event. Ke≈çua would be killed later in 1791 at Kawaihae. The Ancient Hawaiians kept elaborate oral histories, but did not accurately count years from the Christian era. One important event in the oral history was ' which means \\"the falling sand\\" in the Hawaiian Language. This corresponded to an eruption witnessed in 1790 by British sailor John Young. It probably was given the specific name because it was an unusual kind of eruption for Hawaiian volcanoes. Surveyor Frederick S. Lyman used the 1790 date to estimate people's birthdates during his 1857 tax assessment. New research More recent research indicates that some or all of the footprints may in fact be attributable to everyday activities, and not to the war parties. Extensive surveys were done in 1998 and 2000 including radiocarbon dating the few samples of charcoal that could be found. A large number of habitation sites and trails were counted, indicating the area was in use for hundreds of years during the eruption cycle of 1500 to 1790. Modern forensic techniques applied in 2008 determined that many of the footprints were made by women and children, not warriors. They were probably already in the area chipping off sharp chunks of glass to use as tools, and left the footprints while escaping during a lull in the eruption. Ke≈çua's groups, however, were at the summit, and some were killed instantly by the following blast of poison gas, not by the actual falling of the ash.\\"Footprints in Ka≈´ were probably made in 1790‚Äîbut not by Keoua's party\\" on USGS web site, August 28, 2008, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. Although sometimes called \\"fossilized\\", the imprints are not old enough to be true fossils. The fine ash was probably made into thick mud by a rain triggered in the eruption, which then quickly solidified in the tropical sun and was preserved in the arid desert. Recognition The footprints were found accidentally by geologist Ruy H. Finch in the hardened ash of the Ka ª≈´ Desert while he was trying to investigate a 1919 eruption that produced Mauna Iki (small mountain). Although the National Park had been formed by then, these lands were owned by the Territory of Hawaii. In 1938 the area was proposed as a bombing practice range, resulting in protest from conservation groups. On June 20, 1938, the Federal Government bought the land to add to the park, with the bombing range limited to four and a half square miles. The Army never used the land, but the Navy caused some injuries to fishermen in 1945. In June 1950 the bombing range was returned to the park after being cleared of unexploded ordnance. In 1941 the Civilian Conservation Corps built a trail and shelter. It is Hawaii state archaeological site number 10-61-5505,Hawaii County Historic Sites on official State web site.

The population of the former municipality at the 2011 census was 7,232. History Old Gorica Bridge Ruins in the style of the old Gorica bridge in Berat attest to the existence of early inhabitants and what would later become the town today. The contemporary city has its origins in recent displacements of residents from nearby villages over the last 100 years. The building of bridges has been the mark of continuity in the town's history. Known by various names, such as \\"Bridge of Hasan Bey,\\" the contemporary name comes from a cement and iron bridge believed to have been built by the Italians as infrastructure for oil pipelines that connected Ku√ßov√´ with Vlor√´. Local residents call it the \\"Old Bridge.\\" Today it is a small town, known as a crossroad between Berat and Ku√ßov√´. Geography The town is situated on both banks of the river Osum, at the foot of low mountains. Demographics The population is composed of a mix between locals who are from the other side of town, with predominantly Orthodox surnames, and migrants of the 1960s onwards who originate from villages near Berat, and nearby villages such as Fief, Kutalli, Konizbalte, etc.. Primarily a middle to low-aged population, similar to other Albanian communities in transition, Ura Vajgurore has witnessed an increase in external and internal migration, and immigration of people from mountainous villages of Berat. The economy has long been recognized for surface mining of stone, and recently for processing granulated stone, lime, etc.. The main activities are trade, transport, etc.. Culture The town contains a number of educated residents with higher education in distinction to the rest of the population. There are a few notable personalities that originate from this city, like Llazar Fype (writer). Of considerable notoriety is the local Polyphonic Albanian folk music group. Politics Local politics lean primarily left due to local economic needs.

The band was formed somewhere between 2000 and 2002 by Alex Pope (formerly of Sea Scouts ) and Dave Haley (The Amenta, Blood Duster and Psycroptic). Recording Ruins began as a recording project, featuring Pope supplying vocals, guitar and bass, with Haley on drums. It has been incorrectly reported that Haley is merely a session player in the band, and he has publicly dismissed such views as nonsense. The band consists of two core-members used on recordings, with extra live members added for shows, similar to Norwegian black metal band, Satyricon. Initial recordings were intended for demo purposes only, but were decided later to be of sufficient quality for public use. Their first recording, Atom and Time, was released in 2004 by Blacktalon Media. Their debut full length album Spun Forth as Dark Nets was engineered by Joe Haley, Dave's brother and member of the live Ruins line-up. From the response to their recordings, Ruins decided to recruit session musicians to play live. Live Joe Haley and Kai Summers joined Ruins as live session members on guitar and bass respectively. When Summers has been unavailable for shows, Tom Void has filled in. However, Summers remains the full-time live member. Ruins have toured extensively across Australia and New Zealand, supporting many well-known overseas bands including Satyricon, Celtic Frost, Immortal, Pig Destroyer, and Wolves in the Throne Room. Ruins performing in 2008 Current Their third release, Cauldron (2008), was repressed on limited edition vinyl by Debemur Morti Productions.

Early life Wallis was born in L√ºneburg, in Lower Saxony, Germany, where his father was an advocate. Wallis was deaf and mute until six years of age, and it was not until 1836 that he was able to talk. As a consequence, he suffered from a speech defect during his entire life. In about 1836 his father died, leaving his mother a widow with six children. With no means of support, she found it necessary to leave L√ºneburg and move to Detmold, her native town. It was here that Wallis attended school and, in the surrounding mountains and forests, developed the love of nature and botany which later gave him the desire to travel abroad and visit the tropics. As a youth, Wallis had great energy and an indomitable will, and despite his speech impediment he acquired considerable proficiency in foreign languages, an accomplishment which stood him in good stead during the course of his career. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a goldsmith but, disliking the work, he quit and took an apprenticeship with a gardener at Detmold. At the end of his apprenticeship, he obtained employment in Munich, from where he often visited the Alps to collect and study plants. In 1856, Wallis went to southern Brazil, where he set up a horticultural establishment for a German firm but, following the bankruptcy of the parent company, the branch was forced to close and Wallis was left practically penniless. Jean Linden In 1858, he was engaged as a plant-collector by Jean Linden‚Äôs orchid company, L‚ÄôHorticulture Internationale, of Brussels. Wallis then began a hazardous journey, crossing the continent of South America, starting at the mouth of the River Amazon and traversing the total length to its source, exploring the river and many of its more important tributaries. In 1866, Wallis was exploring the low-lying areas where the Rio Negro meets the Amazon, when he came across an unknown Cattleya species growing among the branches of macucus trees. Wallis was able to send a large shipment to Linden, who named the new species Cattleya eldorado, and the following year had more than 700 plants of the new species in bloom on display in Paris. James Veitch & Sons In 1870, he was engaged by James Veitch & Sons, of Chelsea, London who sent him to the Philippines to search for orchids of the Phalaenopsis species which were indigenous to those islands. Although he was able to make sufficient finds to send a shipment back to England, including Paphiopedilum argus, P. haynaldianum, Dendrobium amethystoglossum and Lilium philippinense, the mission proved too expensive to be considered a success and Wallis had to be recalled. In December 1872, he was sent to Colombia, where he had explored previously, returning in 1874 with many finds, including two giant-leaved Anthuriums, A. veitchii and A. warocqueanum, as well as several interesting and valuable orchids, including various species of Masdevallia. Later career and death His contract with Veitch was terminated in 1874, but he continued to collect plants in South America at his own expense, commencing his last journey at the end of the summer of 1875, when he left to explore the northern and central regions of the continent. Whilst in Colombia, he discovered Zamia wallisii but his samples were lost; it was only in the 1980s that the plant was re-located. He was next heard of in Panama, dangerously ill with yellow fever and malaria.

Even though he was born and educated in France, he started his career in Portugal, where he developed several projects on different fields such as: architecture, urban planning, hydraulic engineering and agriculture development. In 1803, he was to become one of the most ranked engineers on the Portuguese army as he was promoted to Brigadier of the Royal Engineers.  First years  Reinaldo Oudinot was born in 1744 in Sampigny on the diocese of Verdun in France. It has been written that after finishing his degree in engineering he travelled to England, arriving in Portugal in 1766. On 5 September he signed in the Portuguese Army, beginning his military career with the post of infantry helper. In his first years he worked at the Province of Estremadura where Later in 1768 he joined the team of Gilherme Elsden on the surveys for Tejo, upgrading to Infantry Officer on 8 February.  Leiria (1773-87)  In 1773 Reinaldo Oudinot was nominated to be the head-director of the Hydraulic works in the Lis River in Leiria. During this assignment, he developed several surveys of the Pinhal de Leiria. The project developed by Oudinot to the Lis river had two stages: the first, consisted of the regularization of the river channel through the cleaning of the sands and the establishment of the river into a straight line; the second, consisted of the construction of a floodwall to prevent future floods to happen over the lands in the south. During these improvementson the harbour, the consort king D. Pedro III, heir of these lands, valued the work of Oudinot, allowing him to expand his ideas for the harbour in 1778. In 1787, after the death of D. Pedro, the succeeding prince D. Jo√£o ordered an inspection on the hydraulic works made on the Lis River. This inspection resulted in a new project proposal by sergeant major Manuel Caetano de Sousa, who contested the hydraulic project of Reinaldo Oudinot. These actions cause Oudinot to be removed from the direction of the harbour. Although the presence of Reinaldo Oudinot was no longer required in Leiria, a short time later he was assigned to work on Porto, to open and clean the harbour of Douro River. During this time, he developed an astonishing amount of work that extended to architecture design and urban planning.  Porto (1789-1804)  After staying 15 years in Leiria, Reinaldo Oudinot was nominated to travel to Porto to examine the harbour of Douro River. He arrived in October 1789, with the instructions made by the minister Jos√© Seabra da Silva. These instructions provided him information about the site and which points to work on the harbour. One month later, Oudinot sent to Jos√© Seabra da Silva, a plan with the project to be made. In this plan he answers the demands by making a dyke on the north side of the harbour, on the river mouth, which connected the lighthouse S. Miguel-o-Anjo to the Fort of S. Jo√£o Baptista. The idea was to allow the regular movement of the waters oriented by the dyke to dredge up the silt from Douro. The project was approved and in February 1790 the Queen D. Maria I ordered the beginning of the procedures. The Infantry Officer Faustino Salustiano da Costa e S√° was nominated to be Oudinot's assistant. Five days after the approval, the Queen demanded the construction of two military barracks for the troops in Porto, Saint Ov√≠dio and Casa Pia. This assignment was also given to Oudinot. From 1789 to 1804, Oudinot presented several projects that consisted not just of the opening and cleaning of the harbour but also of the redesigning of Douro's riverfront. This urban project for the riverfront of Douro consisted of the development of five places: S√£o Jo√£o da Foz, Massarelos, Ribeira do Porto, Guindais and Freixo. Along with these improvements, Oudinot also proposed the construction of a seaside road connecting these five points, providing distribution and harmony to this urban plan. In his plan for the riverfront from 1791, Reinaldo Oudinot combined the three most important aspects for development: hydraulic, urban and military. By expanding the Fort of S. Jo√£o Baptista and designing a new urban structure of regular blocks and squares, Oudinot completely restructured the river mouth of Douro. Even though this project wasn't built due to insufficient funds, the ideologies used by Marques de Pombal in the Downtown of Lisbon are clearly visible on this plan.  P√≥voa de Varzim (1791)  Throughout the year 1789, Reinaldo was designated to travel to the town of P√≥voa de Varzim (30 km north of Porto) to study the conditions of the site and later develop an urban project for the village. The project's main goal was to improve the village infrastructure with the development of three constructions: the transportation of water to the centre of the village by making a new aqueduct; the second, the design of a Central Square for the village, a place for commercial activities and social gathering (this project-square would be accompanied with the construction of the village's City hall and Market); and third, the construction of a Port so the fishing boats could safely anchorage in difficult weather. On the 26th of 1791, Reinaldo Oudinot completed the project, mailing the plans and budget to the Minister Jos√© Seabra da Silva. The strategies developed by Oudinot to P√≥voa de Varzim helped the village establish a political and social centre, thanks to the square. This square (later named as Pra√ßa de Almada), was designed as a rectangular space, connecting the two main communities at the time, the historic centre, on the countryside, and the fishing community on the seaside. All these projects were made during this 15-year period where he worked for the Government of Porto. In 1801, in an early stage of the War of the Oranges, Reinaldo Oudinot took charge as Governor of the Troops of Porto replacing Jo√£o Correia de S√°, who died that same year.  Aveiro (1802-04)  During his work in Porto, Reinaldo Oudinot and his assistant and son-in-law Luis Gomes de Carvalho were nominated to work on the Vouga river in Aveiro in 1802. This assignment also had the purpose of developing the harbour and opening of the river mouth. For two years, Reinaldo Oudinot and his partner presented different projects and solutions for the harbour, being only constructed the dyke for the Lagoon. Due to the floods happening in Madeira Island in the beginning of 1804, Oudinot left Aveiro, leaving the works on the Lagoon in the hands of Luis Gomes de Carvalho. This construction later revealed to be a success in 1808.  Madeira (1804-07)  After the great floods in Madeira Island in 1803, Reinaldo Oudinot was designated to work in the reconstruction of Funchal. For this assignment he was elevated to Brigadier of the Royal Engineers. In his first months spent on the island, he developed a strategy for the reconstruction of the riversides of Funchal, which was presented in April 1804. Some time later, he presented a plan showing the state of the city after the floods of 1803. In this plan Oudinot proposed an urban expansion of Funchal to the West, which he called \\"The New City to Build\\". This plan was never constructed, however, according to researchers, it might have had a major influence on the development of Funchal. In 1805, Oudinot presents a new plan for the city, signed by his assistant Capitan Feliciano de Mattos de Carvalho. Later in 1806, his constructions would successfully sustain the floods. Reinaldo Oudinot later died on 11 February 1807 in Funchal. Even though he stayed in Madeira Island only three years, he developed an astonishing amount of work that played a major role on the reconstruction of the city of Funchal, after the great floods of 9 October 1803.  Personal life  Reinaldo Oudinot was first married to D¬™ Maria Vic√™ncia de Mengui in France. They had only one daughter, D¬™ Maria Paula Oudinot who married Luis Gomes de Carvalho, a military engineer who later became Oudinot's assistant and follower on the harbour of Aveiro. After his wife death, he remarried in 1802 to D¬™ Vicencia do Carmo Locatelli, daughter of the Italian Jo√£o Batista Locatelli. They had three children, Jo√£o Reinaldo, Maria Augusta and Thereza Josephina. The Oudinot's family were established in Aveiro and Leiria for many years, and can still be found descendants. It has been written that Reinaldo Oudinot is brother of Nicolas-Charles Oudinot, Duke of Reggio and Marshal of France.

This vessel should not be confused with the many other vessels, some of similar design, also named Enterprise. In earlier times, this vessel was sometimes called Tom Wright's Enterprise after one of her captains, the famous Tom Wright.Wright, E.W., Lewis & Dryden Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 57-58, Lewis & Dryden Publishing, Portland, OR 1895 Construction Enterprise was built at Canemah, Oregon in the fall of 1855 by Capt. Archibald Jamieson, Captain A.S. Murray, Amory Holbrook and John Torrence, in the fall of 1855, for the upper Willamette trade. Her officers on the first trip upriver to Corvallis (then known as Marysville) were: Jamieson, captain ; Chandler, purser; and Torrence, engineer. George A. Pease was afterward employed as pilot, and John Marshall, engineer. Operations on the Willamette River Willamette Falls, 1918. These falls at Oregon City separated the lower and upper Willamette. From 1855 to 1858 Enterprise was operated on the Willamette River, running between Oregon City, Canemah, and Corvallis. At that time Corvallis was considered to be the head of navigation on the Willamette. Merchants above Corvallis tried to get Captain Jamieson to bring Enterprise, which he then commanded, above Corvallis, but he would not go farther than Orleans, then a small settlement on the east side of the river across from Corvallis.Corning, Howard McKinley, Willamette Landings -- Ghost Towns of the Middle River, at 119, Oregon History Society, Portland, Oregon (2d Ed. 1973) Transfer to British Columbia Capt.

Jamieson used the money from the sale of Enterprise to build the steamer Onward. Tom Wright became one of the most famous steamboat captains in the Pacific Northwest. Like Jamieson, Wright was one of a family in the steamboat business. His father was Capt. John T. Wright, who was the owner of other steamboats, such as Sea Bird and Commodore. The other two sons, also steamboat captains, were George S. Wright and John T. Wright, Jr.Carey, Roland, Sound of Steamers,\\" at 42-43, 54, 55-57, Alderbrook Publishing, Seattle, WA 1965Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 130, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 Tom Wright's plan for Enterprise was to take the vessel into British waters to serve the Fraser River Gold Rush. The first part of the journey began by moving Enterprise from the upper to the lower Willamette River by lining the vessel over Willamette Falls. These falls could not be navigated by steamboats, and indeed Captain Jamieson was later killed when a vessel under his command was accidentally swept over them and destroyed. Lining was procedure where a heavy cable was attached to the vessel, and then to a well- anchored windlass on shore. Little by little the cable would be let out to allow the vessel to gradually pass over the falls to the lower river. Wright then took Enterprise down the lower Willamette and Columbia rivers to Astoria, Oregon. Once there, Wright arranged for an ocean-going steamship to tow Enterprise to Victoria, British Columbia. Victoria, then the largest settlement on the Pacific Coast of North America north of San Francisco. Enterprise left Astoria under tow, but the strong waves on the Columbia Bar caused Enterprise to be so terribly racked that the vessel began leaking, and it was only by luck that they got Enterprise back into shallow water at Astoria before she sank. She was raised and repaired, and started again in August for Victoria, again under tow. Operations in British Columbia Drawing showing the \\"New Eldorado\\", the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush 1860 drawing of gold seekers embarking for Fraser Canyon Gold Rush 1860 drawing of a miner, apparently unsuccessful, returning from Fraser Canyon Gold Rush Enterprise arrived in Victoria in the middle of August 1858. 'Other steamboats that arrived at Victoria at almost the same time that summer were Wilson G. Hunt, Martin White, and Maria.Downs, Art, Paddlewheels on the Frontier -- The Story of British Columbia and Yukon Sternwheel Steamers, at 28-29, Superior Publishing, Seattle WA 1872 Enterprise with other American steamboats obtained a license from the governor of British Columbia to operate in British territory. Enterprise was the second steam-powered vessel to operate on the Fraser River, and had been brought up to Victoria in July 1858. The first vessel was another American steamer, the Umatilla ex Fashion from the Columbia River. Enterprise was very successful on the Fraser River, earning $25,000 in one trip up to Murderer's Bar, near Fort Hope, BC. 25,000 miners went into the Fraser diggings in the summer of 1858, but by the winter only 3,000 remained. With the drop in the population of miners, by the fall of 1858, Enterprise was one of only two steamboats operating on the Fraser River, the other being Maria, under Capt. William A. Lubbock. For a time at least, the two boats divided the traffic between them, with Maria running upriver from Fort Langley to Fort Hope and other points, and Enterprise running between Fort Langley and Victoria, on Vancouver Island. With a monopoly on transport, the two boats were able to raise freight rates from $4 to $7 per ton in the summer to $60 a ton. Beans that cost 3 cents a pound in Victoria cost 75 cents in Lytton, British Columbia. On December 9, 1858, Enterprise was caught in the ice on the Fraser River between Fort Hope and Fort Langley. The vessel was short on food and accommodations, and so 114 of the passengers decided to leave the steamer and walk the remaining distance to Fort Langley. In the cold weather, this proved a mistake, as they had inadequate clothing and insufficient clothing and camping provisions to make the journey. After three days in the ice, Captain Wright was able to hack the Enterprise free. He then cruised up and down the river, eventually rescuing all of the passengers, many of whom were suffering from frostbite. Enterprise built for the Willamette River was not strong enough to regularly cross the often stormy Strait of Georgia, which was the body of water that separated Vancouver Island from the mouth of the Fraser River on the mainland. The Wrights however had no choice in the matter if they were to remain in business, because the vessel they had been running on the route, the Sea Bird was destroyed by fire in the Strait of Georgia on September 7, 1858 while en route from Victoria to Fort Langley. By the spring of 1859, Capt. John T. Wright was able to replace Sea Bird by purchasing an interest in the sidewheeler Eliza Anderson, and arranging to have the Anderson brought from Portland, Oregon where she had been recently built, to Victoria, BC, where she arrived in late March, 1859. This allowed the Wrights to run the heavier more durable Anderson across the Straits to Fort Langley, while returning Enterprise to the 'Fraser River to make the run up from Fort Langley. On March 30, 1859, with Captain Tom Wright in command, Enterprise set out upriver from Fort Langley (after meeting the Anderson). The river was rising high with the rapidly melting snowfall, and with a new boiler installed in the Enterprise Captain Wright hoped to take the vessel all the way to Fort Yale. Only one other steamboat had ever made it to Fort Yale, the Umatilla which by then was no longer on the Fraser River. This time, Captain Wright was unable to go further up than Fort Hope. Enterprise was not powerful enough to beat the strong currents forming whirlpools in the river. Another constant hazard were logs caught in the river bottom, forming \\"snags\\" which could damage or destroy a steam vessel. Failed transfer to Chehalis River Modern map of Grays Harbor, Washington To command a steamboat at a time when there were neither roads nor railroads in the Pacific Northwest was to be in a spectacular opportunity to earn money. Tom Wright never became rich because he could never settle down to running a vessel on a particular route for a sustained period of time. As soon as he mastered one route, he would be looking for another one. In June 1859 Captain Wright was ready to make another change. Hearing of homesteading activity beginning in the valley of the Chehalis River, in the western part of what is now Washington, Wright determined to take Enterprise to the Chehalis. This would require the lightly built Enterprise to be towed, in this case by the Eliza Anderson west through the Strait of Juan de Fuca and then south down the coast line of the Pacific Ocean to Grays Harbor. The Chehalis River flows into Grays Harbor on its eastern shore, near where the modern cities of Aberdeen and Hoquiam, Washington are now located. Wright begin this journey from Victoria on July 8, 1859 with Eliza Anderson towing Enterprise. In the Strait of Juan de Fuca Enterprise broke a shaft on her sternwheel, and the entire expedition was forced to turn back to Esquimalt, where Enterprise had to wait for a replacement shaft to be brought in from San Francisco. Run to San Juan Islands Enterprise was repaired by the end of July 1859, and by that time there was a demand for steamers to carry troops to the San Juan Islands. At that time the boundary between the United States and British Columbia was in dispute, with both countries claiming the San Juan Islands. British and American garrisons were established on San Juan Island. At one point a soldier shot a pig belonging to a partisan of the opposing country, and as a result the otherwise bloodless standoff became known as the Pig War. Steamboats in the area received contracts from both countries to move troops and supplies to the islands in connection with the dispute. Once Enterprise was repaired, Tom Wright postponed his plans to move the vessel to the Chehalis to take advantage of the increase in business, making a run on August 1, 1859 from Victoria to San Juan Island carrying passengers. Completed transfer to Chehalis River Following the San Juan Island trip, Tom Wright was finally able to get Enterprise around Cape Flattery and south to Grays Harbor and the Chehalis River. Wright's plan had been to earn huge freight rates and passenger fares from what he had thought would be the booming population in the Chehalis valley, Wright worked Enterprise to the head of navigation on the Chehalis, sinking three times on the way. When he finally arrived at the headwaters, Wright found not a booming population ready to pay lots of money for steamboat service, but only five farmers who offered to sell Wright a few eggs, butter and vegetables for fifty dollars. Disgusted with the situation, Wright tied up the Enterprise and returned to Puget Sound. By the spring of 1860, Wright was able to arrange a government contract to transport troops down the Chehalis River to Grays Harbor, and so was able to recoup some of his losses. Once the government contract work expired, there was no further business in the Grays Harbor area. Unable to move the lightly built vessel again on the open ocean, Wright dismantled Enterprise at Grays Harbor, with the machinery being shipped to China.

The author is traditionally known as Henry, and was a Cistercian in Huntingdonshire. A 1506 illustration of Owein with the Prior at St Patrick's Purgatory Date and provenance The Tractatus tells of the journey of an Irish knight, Owein (a version of the Irish name E√≥gan), to St Patrick's Purgatory in Loch Derg, where he journeys through Purgatory and the Earthly Paradise.http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/soint.htm Owein's journey is dated by Henry of Saltrey to the reign of King Stephen of England between 1135 and 1154. Henry states that his source was Gilbert, a monk in Lincoln who visited Ireland in 1148 to found a monastery at Baltinglass. Since Gilbert spoke no Irish, he was introduced to the knight Owein, who became his interpreter during his two-year stay in Ireland. The text The Tractatus is dedicated to Abbot Hugh of Sartris. The introductory section is composed of six parts, a theological survey of the otherworld, an account of Irish scepticism of Saint Patrick's teaching, an example given by Gilbert of the savagery of the Irish, how Christ revealed Saint Patrick's Purgatory to Patrick, an account of a saintly former prior at the Purgatory, and the rituals practiced by the pilgrims who came there. The narrative of Owein's visit begins with an account of how the knight was moved to make reparation for his sins after attending confession. On entering the cave he made his way to a great field in which was a hall which resembled a cloister. There he was greeted by fifteen men who appeared to be monks and were dressed entirely in white. Their prior gave Owein advice on how he should complete his journey safely, by calling on the name of Jesus Christ if ever he found himself in difficulty. Shortly after the men had departed Owein heard a great roar and a vast number of demons rushed towards him. These demons bind Owein and throw him into a fire, but he is delivered when he calls on Christ. Owein journeys across a series of plains where the souls in purgatory undergo tortures at the hand of demons. The sufferings of the souls in purgatory are described in detailed and vivid terms. The demons repeatedly try to torture Owein, but he escapes each time he utters Christ's name. Finally he comes to a great, fiery river which emits a great stench and is filled with demons. The demons reveal that beneath this river is the entrance to Hell. A narrow and slippery bridge provides the only means of traversing this river safely. When Owein calls upon the name of Jesus the bridge widens enough for him to cross comfortably. The account of purgatory is followed by a homily comparing the severity of purgatorial pains with the sufferings of the present world and exhorting the reader to pray for the dead. On the other side of the bridge lies the Earthly Paradise. Two archbishops greet Owein and take him through a land filled with flowers, singing, sweet smells and joy. Owein is told that this is a place of rest for souls who have been purified in purgatory before their entry into heaven. The archbishops take the knight to the top of a high mountain from where he can make out the gates of the celestial heaven. A second homily is inserted here asking the reader to always remember the happiness of the saints and the pain of the sinful. Owein receives some of the manna-like heavenly food which the inhabitants of both the celestial and earthly paradises enjoy. He is then told he must return to the world to live out the rest of his life. He returns by the way he came and this time the devils flee from him in terror. Henry concludes by relating how Gilbert met Owein and recounted his tale to Henry himself. Gilbert's also gives the testimony of a monk who was abducted by devils one night as further proof of the authenticity of Owein's story. Henry adds an account of his own researches into the story. He interviewed two Irish abbots about the purgatory and bishop Florentianus, who gives an account of a hermit living near Lough Derg who is visited by demons. Influence The Tractatus was arguably the most popular vision of Purgatory throughout the Middle Ages and survives in over 30 versions in almost every European vernacular. More than 150 manuscripts of the Latin text are extant. It was read and adapted long after several ideas feature prominently in it fell out of mainstream belief (e.g. the idea of the earthly paradise as an afterlife location where souls would spend time between their period in purgatory and their entry into heaven). Among the most famous versions of the Tractatus is the Anglo-Norman translation the Legend of the Purgatory of St. Patrick by Marie de France. The Auchinleck manuscript preserves a version in Middle English verse. The story was almost certainly known to Dante. http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/soint.htm In its themes, Irish background, and breadth of influence, it is comparable to the Visio Tnugdali. The two texts are nearly contemporary and frequently appear in the same manuscripts. Like the Visio Tnugdali, the Tractatus was instrumental in shaping popular ideas of the Otherworld.http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/soint.htm References Bibliography *Easting, Robert: The Date and Dedication of the Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii.: Speculum, Jahrgang 53, Heft 4/10/1978, pp. 778‚Äì783. *Haren, Michael and Yolande de Pontfarcy, The Medieval Pilgrimage to St Patrick's Purgatory: Lough Derg and the European Tradition Clogher Historical Society, 1988. *Zaleski, Carol G.: St. Patrick's Purgatory: Pilgrimage Motifs in a Medieval Otherworld Vision.: Journal of the History of Ideas, Jahrgang 46, Heft 4, 1985, pp. 467‚Äì485. *Le Goff, Jacques: Die Geburt des Fegefeuers: Vom Wandel des Weltbildes im Mittelalter.

Among its publications are exhibition catalogues, artists‚Äô biographies and autobiographies, and even a book of poetry. In addition to publishing scholarly texts, IRSA organizes research work and exhibitions of historical and contemporary art, to which it supplements catalogues.http://www.irsa.com.pl/?lang=En Within the framework of its activities, IRSA collaborates with both universities and museums worldwide. History Established in 1979 by the Polish art historian J√≥zef Grabski, the Institute was initially based in Venice (1979‚Äì1982) and hence the acronym IRSA, Istituto per le Ricerche di Storia dell‚ÄôArte. From there it moved to Florence and Vienna, and finally in 1996 to Cracow, Poland. Dr. Grabski‚Äôs initiative to create a new art periodical as the main activity of the institute was the result of what was observed as a lack of an independent and, significantly, interdisciplinary journal dedicated to art history. His idea came to fruition with a group of art historians gathered after the International Congress of the History of Art (CIHA) in Bologna in 1979 and IRSA as an Institute and as a publisher came into being. That same year (but already dated 1980) the first issue of Artibus et Historiae appeared. Since that time the periodical has appeared in uninterrupted sequence on a semi- annual basis.http://www.artibusethistoriae.org/ In 2019 IRSA will celebrate 40 years as an international institute and publishing house.

Organization Non-partisan, its purpose is to \\"work for immediate, total and unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces [from Chechnya] and for the right of the Chechen people to autonomy\\". In addition it works to spread information about the situation in Chechnya, to help organize developmental support within Chechnya, and to assist Chechen refugees in Norway and other countries. Its board of directors are chaired by Hilde J√∏rgensen. Members of the board include former national legislator Ingvald Godal and the Norwegian PEN chairman Kjell Olaf Jensen. Attention The committee has played a somewhat controversial role in Norwegian politics. Following the Moscow theater hostage crisis in October 2002, Ingvald Godal said of the terrorists that \\"I understand their action, even though I do not defend it\\". He later claimed that he failedly attempted to enlist Norway as a negotiator during the crisis. In November the same year, ahead of a state visit by Vladimir Putin in Norway, Ingvald Godal filed a prosecution request to the Police of Norway. He also suggested that the Prime Minister of Norway take initiative to an international criminal tribunal for Chechnya. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that a police prosecution of a foreign head of state is not possible, and rebuffed the latter proposal. During Putin's visit, the committee held a demonstration together with Amnesty International, the Norwegian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and Norwegian Church Aid. The committee has engaged in other peaceful protests, such as a 2007 memorial of Anna Politkovskaya in cooperation with the Helsinki Committee, the Norwegian PEN, the Human Rights House, the Norwegian Union of Journalists and Nobel Peace Center. In 2004 the committee and the Socialist Left Party of Norway invited Ahmed Zakayev, a separatist exiled in the United Kingdom, to visit Norway. The Norwegian ambassador to Russia √òyvind Nordsletten received a letter from the Solicitor General of Russia, who called the visit \\"blasphemous\\" and demanded extradition. Another visit to Norway by Zakayev followed in December 2004. As a result, counsellor Paul G.

Abrahams was prominent, and articles about him appeared regularly in mainstream British Jewish publications in his lifetime, including The Jewish Chronicle, The Jewish Encyclopedia, the Jewish Yearbook (UK - 1899), and the Young Israel (December 1899). Education and teaching Abrahams began his studies at the Manchester Hebrew School, but left there to go to London, where he lived with his uncle, Rabbi Aaron Levy, a sofer and dayan (judge) on the London Beth Din. He became a student-teacher at the Jews' Free School on 1 June 1854, and then entered the University of London, completing a bachelor's of arts degree in 1863. He became a teacher at the Jews' Free School, and became head of the English department in 1864. While continuing to teach there, he also studied at John Curwen's Tonic Sol-Fa College, graduating in 1874 and adding music to the subjects he taught at the Jews' Free School. He became a school administrator in 1884 and headmaster in 1897, succeeding Moses Angel. As Moses Angel did before him, Abrahams disliked the Yiddish spoken by Jews newly arrived to England in a wave of immigration from Russia. In a 1905 speech at a prize- giving ceremony, he called Yiddish \\"that miserable jargon which was not a language at all\\". Instead, he favored immersion in English as a way of quickly assimilating Yiddish-speaking students. Along with the introduction of music to the curriculum, he founded a cadet corps at the school, built a gymnasium, and organized sporting activities for the students. He also moved the school away from purely theoretical studies and towards technical and vocational training, by opening new physics and chemistry laboratories and woodworking and metalworking shops. Under his leadership the school became \\"the largest public elementary school in the world\\". He retired from the school in 1907. Other activities Abrahams founded a periodical, the Jewish Record, in 1868, and served as its first editor for three years. He also helped found the Jewish Educational Board and the Teachers' Training Committee, and worked with several local benevolent societies. After retiring, he became honorary president of the synagogue at Westcliff-on-Sea.

His father, Barnett Abrahams (1785‚Äì1868), taught Hebrew there, and became cantor in Manchester in 1845. His mother, Hannah, was Barnett's second wife, came from a Polish family, and died in 1868. Abrahams married Fannie Rosetta Mosely on 11 February 1869; they had two children. His son, Bertram Louis Abrahams (1870‚Äì1908) was a physician, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He died on 3 June 1918.

The adventures have some connection with those of Ashmedai, while the conversations consist chiefly of riddles similar to those put to Solomon by the Queen of Sheba. The exact extent of its indebtedness to the Haggadah is somewhat doubtful, though it is practically certain that the various versions are derived from an Eastern original.  Text and history  In Polish, in 1521 in Krakow a book titled \\"The talks that the king Salomon the clever had with Marcho≈Çt [Marcolf, Markolf] fat and bawdy, however, as they say, very eloquent\\" was published . The earliest known versions of the tale in Old English are the ones commonly referred to as Solomon and Saturn, first published by J. N. Kemble in 1848, for the √Ülfric Society. The tale was popular in Germany, where Marcolf, or Marolf, became a sort of type of the \\"wise fool\\". It was first printed under the title Dis buch seit von kunig salomon vnd siner hu√ü frouwen Salome wie sy der k√ºnig fore nam vnd wie sy Morolff k√ºnig salomon br√ºder wider brocht in Strasbourg by printer Matthias Hupfuff in 1499, with woodcut illustrations. Bavarian State Library entry, with link to digitized images of book. Woodcut illustrations only, of 1555 Strassburg edition printed in: Latin versions of it were often appended to the \\"Epistol√¶ Obscurorum Virorum\\". Both Hans Folz and Hans Sachs made use of the legend. A French version was made by Pierre Mauclerc, Count of Brittany, in the thirteenth century. In Italian, Giulio Cesare Croce adopted it in his \\"Bertoldo\\", another name for Marcolf. This was developed into a book at Bologna in 1736. Other versions occur in the Bolognese and Venetian dialects, and in Dutch, Greek, Polish, Icelandic, and Welsh. There are two editions in English, one published by Gerard Leeu (Antwerp, 1492), and another, Sayings or Proverbes of King Solomon, with the Answers of Marcolfus, printed by Richard Pynson in 1530, a version of the much shorter French Dictionnaire de Salomon.

It is closely related to Crossota millsae and is found in the Arctic Ocean at depths below .Raskoff, K., and R. Hopcroft (2010). Crossota norvegica. Arctic Ocean Diversity. Accessed 5 August 2012. Crossota norvegica is also known as the ‚ÄúDeep-Red Jellyfish.‚Äù This species is described as ‚Äúalien-like‚Äù and is known for its vibrant red hue. It is a small cnidarian, reaching only up to 2 cm in its body size.Raskoff, K., and R. Hopcroft (2010). Crossota norvegica. Arctic Ocean Diversity. Accessed 15 February 2018. Description Unlike other cnidarians, Crossota norvegica lives its entire life in the planktonic stage or the planula stage, instead of experiencing both the sessile stage and planula stage. Another unique trait off this species is that it does not develop into a polyp. Polyps typically produce the sexual reproduction gametes of cnidarians by budding. These polyps are stationary and non-moving forms of cnidarians (The Columbia Encyclopedia).The Columbia Encyclopedia. Encyclopedia.com. Accessed 15 February 2018. Others will reproduce sexually in the medusa stage, where they are free-swimming cnidarians. During this stage they are typically very small, around 1-50mm in diameter. It is unclear whether or not this species is dioecius, meaning that it needs both a male and a female in order to reproduce. Alternatively, some hydrozoa, but not all, can be sequential hermaphrodites where they can produce and fertilize eggs on their own, without a partner.Hammond, G. (2009). \\"Hydroza\\". Animal Diversity. Accessed 15 February 2018. Crossota norvegica is closely related to the Crossota millsae, in which both males and females have been found and described to reproduce together. As a part of the cnidarian family, they have ectodermal cells that contain nematocysts (cnidae). Some of these nematocysts have the ability to sting. Along the cnidae are spines that will produce an acid. When the cnidae comes into contact, the nematocysts get stuck into prey. Though these are a very common type of cnidae, not all cnidae have the ability to produce acid to stun prey. Habitat and diet Crossota norvegica lives in temperatures ranging from 3.7ÀöC to 3.9ÀöC.OBIS. Ocean Biogeographic Information System. Accessed 15 February 2018. This species has been found in waters deeper than 2,500 m. Its diet is currently unknown. Many Hydrozoa will feed on small zooplankton by use of their tentacles, whereas others eat phytoplankton. Philatelic error Crossota norvegica appeared on a stamp issued by Canada in 2007 to commemorate the International Polar Year. Unfortunately, the name on the stamp was given as Crossota millsaeare, a misspelling of Crossota millsae.

Places of interest The ruins of Shanid Castle, an important Anglo-Norman stronghold, is located a short distance away from the village. The castle was possibly constructed in 1230 on land associated with the FitzMaurice family which settled in the area after 1169 and was a fortress of the Knights of Glin before being burned in 1641.

It only saw action once and was not particularly successful. Design After the success of the X class midget submarines, an attempt was made by SOE's technical division, Inter Services Research Bureau (ISRB) under the command of Lt. Colonel John Dolphin to design a submersible craft for covert missions. These would include the landing and supplying agents behind enemy lines, intelligence gathering work off hostile coastlines, and delivering explosive depth charges to enemy shipping routes. This design became the Welfreighter. It was intended that the Welfreighter could travel surfaced by night towards an enemy-held coastline, submerging as and when necessary to avoid detection.British SF water craft, (section 'Welfreighter') covertshores.blogspot.com, accessed 30 May 2020 The special agents would then be disembarked and go ashore along with their equipment, stored in the special containers. The Welfreighter would then sail out to sea and submerge itself to wait until the next night. At a pre-arranged time, or upon receiving a sound signal from the landing party (made by a mechanical device) it would surface again and pick up the agents, before heading out to sea either to rendezvous with a larger surface vessel or return to base under its own power. The initial concept was a true miniature submarine which could from a distance be mistaken for a conventional motor boat and which could hold two agents along with its crew of two men, and which could also carry up to one ton of supplies in sealed containers. The designed range was to be up to on the surface, with a range of at speeds of up to . While submerged it was to be capable of diving to a depth of and travelling up to underwater. Design work began towards the end of 1942 with the building of a 1/4 scale model which was used for tests in an experimental tank at Vickers' plant at St. Albans. By February 1943 the tests had produced several alterations to the original design including modifications to the hull form to make it stable under tow at speeds of - . =Prototypes= Following the model tests, permission was granted for the construction of a full size prototype at the SOE establishment known as The Frythe near Welwyn Garden City. The first prototype had little resemblance to the later versions. When launched at Staines in May 1943 it permitted further tests but showed flaws in that it was not stable under tow at speeds over and lacked freeboard. A second prototype was begun in June and was tested throughout the autumn and winter. A third prototype was begun in September 1943. Its surface range - - exceeded the specification, but at the expense of reducing the storage capacity by . Its speed was less than the specification, at maximum while surfaced, with a mere submerged. It did however perform satisfactorily when pressure tested to a depth of . Production In early 1944 a specification for a final Mk III version was proposed by SOE, which eventually entered series production. The range was now specified as , with an additional using disposable tanks (which however meant a loss of the diving capability). A further could be added if part of the storage capacity was used. The accommodation had also been enlarged; as well as the two crewmen, 4 passengers could be carried on short voyages, or 3 for longer trips. The cargo capacity had also been enhanced to enable between 1.5 and 2 tons to be carried. Underwater endurance had also been augmented, the craft now being capable of supporting 6 persons for up to 40 hours submerged. Finally, surface speed had been increased to cruising speed, or maximum. Even the electric propulsion was upgraded: it could deliver 2-3 knots. By now it was apparent that it was unlikely that the Welfreighter would be needed in Europe, therefore consideration was given to its use in the Far East. Due to the urgency of production it was not possible to create a dedicated factory. As had happened with the Welman submarine the year before, production was contracted out to specialised engineering firms already engaged in production of war material. In the spring of 1944 the Letchworth company of Shelvoke and Drewry Ltd. was awarded a contract to produce Welfreighters. By early September an order for up to 34 Welfreighters was placed for delivery as soon as possible after 1 October. The company had no experience of ship construction, and was from the sea. Security surrounding the production of the Welfreighter was tight, and few non-vetted employees knew the truth until after the end of the war. Completed craft were transported at night under canvas covers to Station IX at Welwyn, where they were fitted out, the compass and periscope and secret equipment fitted. The craft were then balanced, trimmed, and pressure tested in the establishment's water tank. They were then transported onwards to Fishguard in Wales, for sea trials. Appearance The Welfreighter outwardly resembled a conventional motor boat. While surfaced it was propelled by a Gardner 4LW diesel omnibus engine driving a 4-bladed propeller, while underwater propulsion was provided by two electric motors, driving a pair of small propellers. Two \\"masts\\" on the craft's foredeck housed a Barr and Stroude periscope and a magnetic compass. A dummy mast and sail could be attached to these masts to help disguise the craft as a fishing smack. The foredeck was raised up to give some headroom inside the craft, and was fitted with small square viewports. To the rear of the main structure was a raised deck, beneath which were housed 6 high pressure air cylinders. To the rear of this area was a cargo well, fitted at the stern with a drop-down tailgate. This could house seven cylindrical drums of cargo. Carefully loaded so as to give a slight positive buoyancy, these drums could hold equipment for use by agents or saboteurs and could be floated out through the tailgate and towed ashore by agents, either swimming or using an inflatable boat. Each Welfreighter was manned by a Sub Lieutenant RNVR as Commander, and a Naval Engine Room Artificer (ERA) or Army mechanic (REME). Up to four special agents could travel as passengers, although two would be more usual. These would commonly be Army personnel, who would be expected to assist with handling the craft while on the surface. Service =Europe= Before the Welfreighter became properly operational the secret war in Europe was nearly over. In late 1944 plans were discussed to deploy the craft to the Adriatic, to assist operations in the Balkans, where SOE was involved in supporting partisans in northern Greece, Albania, and Yugoslavia. It was also suggested that Welfreighters could be used to plant mines in the entrances to German ports, but this was dropped when it was demonstrated that a suitable charge would have to weigh over , which would be too much for the craft's buoyancy and trim. Trained Welfreighter crews were ready for operations through the autumn of 1944, but neither Combined Operations HQ or SOE ever required anything of them. =Far East= Two Welfreighters were shipped to Fremantle, Australia, in late 1944, to become part of the clandestine Services Reconnaissance Department (commonly known as Z Special Unit). Extensive trials were conducted, including towing trials and exercises using high-powered motor launches and Motor Torpedo Boats. One source suggests that 12 were sent to Australia in 1945.A Welfreighter four man submarine on trials at Careening Bay camp Notes regarding a photograph, 1945 www.awm.gov.au, accessed 30 May 2020 References * * Category:Midget submarines Category:Submarines of the United Kingdom Category:Special Operations Executive ","title":"Welfreighter"},{"id":"20041306","text":"Hustler Booth at the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo at the Sands Convention Center, Las Vegas, Nevada on January 7, 2010 Hustler Video is an American pornographic film studio.

It is not an integral in the Lebesgue sense; the word \\"integral\\" is used because the Berezin integral has properties analogous to the Lebesgue integral and because it extends the path integral in physics, where it is used as a sum over histories for fermions. Definition Let \\\\Lambda^n be the exterior algebra of polynomials in anticommuting elements \\\\theta_{1},\\\\dots,\\\\theta_{n} over the field of complex numbers. (The ordering of the generators \\\\theta_1,\\\\dots,\\\\theta_n is fixed and defines the orientation of the exterior algebra.) =One variable= The Berezin integral over the sole Grassmann variable \\\\theta = \\\\theta_1 is defined to be a linear functional : \\\\int [af(\\\\theta)+bg(\\\\theta)] \\\\, d\\\\theta = a\\\\int f(\\\\theta) \\\\, d\\\\theta + b\\\\int g(\\\\theta) \\\\, d\\\\theta, \\\\quad a,b \\\\in \\\\C where we define : \\\\int \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta = 1, \\\\qquad \\\\int \\\\, d\\\\theta = 0 so that : : \\\\int \\\\frac\\\\partial{\\\\partial\\\\theta}f(\\\\theta)\\\\,d\\\\theta = 0. These properties define the integral uniquely and imply : \\\\int (a\\\\theta+b)\\\\, d\\\\theta = a, \\\\quad a,b \\\\in \\\\C. Take note that f(\\\\theta)=a\\\\theta + b is the most general function of \\\\theta because Grassmann variables square to zero, so f(\\\\theta) cannot have non-zero terms beyond linear order. =Multiple variables= The Berezin integral on \\\\Lambda^{n} is defined to be the unique linear functional \\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^{n} }\\\\cdot\\\\textrm{d}\\\\theta with the following properties: :\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^n}\\\\theta_{n}\\\\cdots\\\\theta_{1}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta=1, :\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^n}\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial\\\\theta_{i}}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta=0,\\\\ i=1,\\\\dots,n for any f\\\\in\\\\Lambda^n, where \\\\partial/\\\\partial\\\\theta_{i} means the left or the right partial derivative. These properties define the integral uniquely. Notice that different conventions exist in the literature: Some authors define instead :\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^n}\\\\theta_{1}\\\\cdots\\\\theta_{n}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta:=1. The formula :\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^n}f(\\\\theta) \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta=\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^1}\\\\left( \\\\cdots \\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^1}\\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^1}f(\\\\theta) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta_{1}\\\\right) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta_2 \\\\cdots \\\\right)\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta_n expresses the Fubini law. On the right-hand side, the interior integral of a monomial f=g(\\\\theta')\\\\theta_{1} is set to be g( \\\\theta'), where \\\\theta'=\\\\left(\\\\theta_{2},\\\\ldots,\\\\theta_{n}\\\\right); the integral of f=g (\\\\theta') vanishes. The integral with respect to \\\\theta_{2} is calculated in the similar way and so on. =Change of Grassmann variables= Let \\\\theta_{i}=\\\\theta_{i}\\\\left(\\\\xi_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\xi_{n}\\\\right),\\\\ i=1,\\\\ldots,n, be odd polynomials in some antisymmetric variables \\\\xi_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\xi_{n}. The Jacobian is the matrix :D=\\\\left{ \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\theta_{i}}{\\\\partial\\\\xi_{j}},\\\\ i,j=1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\right}, where \\\\partial /\\\\partial\\\\xi_{j} refers to the right derivative (\\\\partial(\\\\theta_1\\\\theta_2) /\\\\partial\\\\theta_2 = \\\\theta_1, \\\\; \\\\partial(\\\\theta_1\\\\theta_2) /\\\\partial\\\\theta_1 = -\\\\theta_2). The formula for the coordinate change reads :\\\\int f(\\\\theta)\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta=\\\\int f(\\\\theta( \\\\xi))(\\\\det D)^{-1}\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\xi. Integrating even and odd variables =Definition= Consider now the algebra \\\\Lambda^{m\\\\mid n} of functions of real commuting variables x=x_{1},\\\\ldots,x_{m} and of anticommuting variables \\\\theta_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\theta_{n} (which is called the free superalgebra of dimension (mn)). Intuitively, a function f=f(x,\\\\theta) \\\\in\\\\Lambda^{m\\\\mid n} is a function of m even (bosonic, commuting) variables and of n odd (fermionic, anti-commuting) variables. More formally, an element f=f(x,\\\\theta) \\\\in\\\\Lambda^{m\\\\mid n} is a function of the argument x that varies in an open set X\\\\subset\\\\R^{m} with values in the algebra \\\\Lambda^{n}. Suppose that this function is continuous and vanishes in the complement of a compact set K\\\\subset\\\\R^{m}. The Berezin integral is the number :\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^{m\\\\mid n}}f(x,\\\\theta)\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta \\\\mathrm{d}x=\\\\int_{\\\\R^{m}}\\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^{n}}f(x,\\\\theta)\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta. =Change of even and odd variables= Let a coordinate transformation be given by x_{i}=x_{i} (y,\\\\xi),\\\\ i=1,\\\\ldots,m;\\\\ \\\\theta_{j}=\\\\theta_{j} (y,\\\\xi),j=1,\\\\ldots, n, where x_{i} are even and \\\\theta_{j} are odd polynomials of \\\\xi depending on even variables y. The Jacobian matrix of this transformation has the block form: :\\\\mathrm{J}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial(x,\\\\theta)}{\\\\partial (y,\\\\xi)}= \\\\begin{pmatrix} A & B\\\\ C & D\\\\end{pmatrix}, where each even derivative \\\\partial/\\\\partial y_{j} commutes with all elements of the algebra \\\\Lambda^{m\\\\mid n}; the odd derivatives commute with even elements and anticommute with odd elements. The entries of the diagonal blocks A=\\\\partial x/\\\\partial y and D=\\\\partial\\\\theta/\\\\partial\\\\xi are even and the entries of the off-diagonal blocks B=\\\\partial x/\\\\partial \\\\xi,\\\\ C=\\\\partial\\\\theta/\\\\partial y are odd functions, where \\\\partial /\\\\partial\\\\xi_{j} again mean right derivatives. We now need the Berezinian (or superdeterminant) of the matrix \\\\mathrm{J}, which is the even function :\\\\mathrm{Ber~J}=\\\\det\\\\left( A-BD^{-1}C\\\\right) \\\\det D^{-1} defined when the function \\\\det D is invertible in \\\\Lambda^{m\\\\mid n}. Suppose that the real functions x_{i}=x_i(y,0) define a smooth invertible map F:Y\\\\to X of open sets X, Y in \\\\R^{m} and the linear part of the map \\\\xi\\\\mapsto\\\\theta=\\\\theta(y,\\\\xi) is invertible for each y\\\\in Y. The general transformation law for the Berezin integral reads :\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^{m\\\\mid n}}f(x,\\\\theta)\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta\\\\mathrm{d}x=\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^{m\\\\mid n}}f(x(y,\\\\xi),\\\\theta (y,\\\\xi)) \\\\varepsilon \\\\mathrm{Ber~J~d} \\\\xi\\\\mathrm{d}y =\\\\int_{\\\\Lambda^{m\\\\mid n}}f (x(y,\\\\xi),\\\\theta (y,\\\\xi))\\\\varepsilon\\\\frac{\\\\det\\\\left(A-BD^{-1}C\\\\right)}{\\\\det D}\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\xi\\\\mathrm{d}y, where \\\\varepsilon=\\\\mathrm{sgn}(\\\\det\\\\partial x(y,0)/\\\\partial y) is the sign of the orientation of the map F. The superposition f(x(y,\\\\xi),\\\\theta(y,\\\\xi)) is defined in the obvious way, if the functions x_{i}(y,\\\\xi) do not depend on \\\\xi. In the general case, we write x_{i}(y,\\\\xi) =x_{i}(y,0)+\\\\delta_{i}, where \\\\delta_{i}, i=1,\\\\ldots,m are even nilpotent elements of \\\\Lambda^{m\\\\mid n} and set :f(x(y,\\\\xi),\\\\theta) =f(x(y,0),\\\\theta) +\\\\sum_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_{i}}(x(y,0),\\\\theta) \\\\delta_{i}+\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i,j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2}f}{\\\\partial x_{i}\\\\partial x_{j}}(x(y,0),\\\\theta) \\\\delta_{i}\\\\delta_{j}+ \\\\cdots, where the Taylor series is finite.  Useful formulas  The following formulas for Gaussian integrals are used often in the path integral formulation of quantum field theory: * \\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\theta^TA\\\\eta\\\\right] \\\\,d\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\eta = \\\\det A with A being a complex n \\\\times n matrix. * \\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left[- \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\theta^T M \\\\theta\\\\right] \\\\,d\\\\theta = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathrm{Pf}\\\\, M & n \\\\mbox{ even} \\\\ 0 & n \\\\mbox{ odd} \\\\end{cases} with M being a complex skew-symmetric n \\\\times n matrix, and \\\\mathrm{Pf}\\\\, M being the Pfaffian of M, which fulfills (\\\\mathrm{Pf}\\\\, M)^2 = \\\\det M. In the above formulas the notation d \\\\theta = d\\\\theta_1\\\\cdots \\\\, d\\\\theta_n is used. From these formulas, other useful formulas follow (See Appendix A in S. Caracciolo, A. D.

Facts A man paid ¬£100 for what he thought was a bezoar stone. This is a stone that forms in animals' intestinal systems, and was believed to have magical healing properties. The seller said it was a bezoar stone, which turned out to be false.William Hughes, A practical Treatise of the laws Relitive to the sale and Conveyance of Real Property.(Saunders and Benning, 1840) p168. The buyer sued for the return of the ¬£100 purchase price. How the claimant discovered that the bezoar did not work is not discussed in the report. The issue for the court was whether the sales pitch had been the usual big talk of the market merchants in the plying of their wares, or if there had been indeed an actual deceit in the transaction.William Hughes, A Practical Treatise of the Laws Relative to the Sale and conveyance of real property (Saunders and Benning, 1840) p170. Judgment The Exchequer Court held the buyer had no right to his money back, saying \\"the bare affirmation that it was a bezoar stone, without warranting it to be so, is no cause of action.\\" The majority of the judges held that the buyer was required to show either that the seller knew the stone was not a bezoar, in which case the seller was liable for deceit, or that the seller had warranted (contractually guaranteed) that the stone was a bezoar, in which case the seller would be liable for breach of warranty. Since the seller in this case was not alleged to have done either of these things, the buyer's claim failed.

His mother was Franti≈°ka K≈ôiƒçkov√° (1861-1936). His brother Petr K≈ôiƒçka (1884‚Äì1949) later became a well-known poet, and his sister Pavla K≈ôiƒçkov√° (1886‚Äì1972) became a writer. Their father enthusiastically supported the musical education of his children; Jaroslav received violin, piano, and voice lessons as a child. He attended high school in Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod and graduated in 1900. As a high school student, he founded his own vocal quartet, string quartet, and student orchestra and began to compose. After graduating from high school, he moved to Prague and studied at the Prague Conservatory from 1902 to 1905. Under the tutelage of Josef Klicka, he studied organ, orchestration, and harmony. He studied conducting with Karel Knittl[cs] and composition with Karel Stecker[cs]. His musical role models were the famous Czech composers Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, Bed≈ôich Smetana, and Zdenƒõk Fibich, and later also the Czech modernists V√≠tƒõzslav Nov√°k and Josef Suk. After studying for a year in Berlin (1905‚Äì1906), he moved to Russia for three years (1906‚Äì1909) and taught music theory, harmony, and chamber music at the Imperial Music School in Ekaterinoslav. There he founded an orchestra with which he performed works by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k and Bed≈ôich Smetana. In Russia, he developed friendships with the composers Alexander Glazunov and Sergei Tanejev. K≈ôiƒçka was inspired by Russian poetry and music, and the work of composers Mikhail Glinka and Modest Mussorgsky particularly influenced his compositions. It was in Ekaterinoslav that he penned one of his most famous songs, \\"Albatross,\\" from the cycle Severn√≠ noci (Northern Nights). Mussorgsky's song cycles for children also inspired him to compose his own children's songs. K≈ôiƒçka moved to Prague in 1909, and from 1911 to 1920 he directed the Prague choir Hlahol[cs]. His tenure as director afforded him the opportunity to study numerous works by contemporary Czech composers such as Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek, V√≠tƒõzslav Nov√°k, and Otakar Jeremi√°≈°, in addition to premiering Nov√°k's cantata Svatebn√≠ ko≈°ile (The Wedding Shirt), Op.48. During this period, he also began his first major work: the opera Hipolyta. From 1911 he championed his former teacher Karel Stecker at the Prague Conservatory, and after Stecker's death in 1919 he was appointed as a full professor of composition. On October 14, 1918, he married Marie Krbov√°, a pianist and singer in the Hlahol choir who studied under Josef Bohuslav Foerster. Together with his student Jaroslav ≈ò√≠dk√Ω, K≈ôiƒçka conducted the choir of the Czech Philharmonic from 1922 to 1930. During the critical years of World War II and the German occupation (1942‚Äì1945), he also served as rector of the Conservatory. During his many years of teaching at the Prague Conservatory, Jaroslav K≈ôiƒçka trained numerous composers, including Jaroslav ≈ò√≠dk√Ω, Karel H√°ba, Emil Hlobil, Karel Janeƒçek, V√°clav Trojan, J√°n Cikker, Jan Kapr and Jarmil Burghauser. He spent the last years of his life in the peaceful foothills of the Bohemian forest, where he dedicated himself to his composing in the village of ƒåerven√© Dvorce near Su≈°ice. He is buried in the Vy≈°ehrad cemetery in Prague.A plaque commemorating the family home of the K≈ôiƒçka brothers in Kelƒç.  Honors  In 1936, Jaroslav K≈ôiƒçka won a bronze medal in the art competitions of the Olympic Games for his Hor√°ck√° suita (Hor√°cko Suite a.k.a. Mountain Suite), Op. 63. He was elected a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1921, and in 1957 he received the esteemed title of Honored Artist (Zaslou≈æil√Ω umƒõlec). The K≈ôiƒçka Brothers Museum is located in his hometown of Kelƒç.  Works  Jaroslav K≈ôiƒçka's work encompasses almost all musical genres, in his words, ‚Äúfrom passions to operetta,‚Äù with a distinct emphasis on vocal compositions. In addition to song cycles and cantatas, he also composed operas, operettas, incidental music, symphonies, string quartets, and chamber music works. His compositions for children were significant and unique for his time; he wrote numerous children's song cycles and the first Czech children's opera, Oga≈ôi (1918). At the end of the silent film era, K≈ôiƒçka began composing film scores; in 1929, he wrote the music for the historical film Svat√Ω V√°clav, which commemorated one thousand years since the death of the Bohemian ruler Wenceslaus I. He began composing operettas after 1945. In addition to his musical compositions, K≈ôiƒçka wrote many treatises on music and published regularly in the music periodicals Hudebn√≠ revue and Hudebn√≠ rozhledy. = Song Cycles = * Severn√≠ noci (Northern Nights), Op. 14 (1909/1910), four songs based on poetry by Konstantin Balmont ** 1.

The film consists of a series of interviews with different drivers, focusing on both their personal life stories and also the life and culture of truck drivers in the United States. Production The film was shot with a crew of three people: director and cameraman Doug Pray, producer Brad Blondheim, and lighting, sound, and general production assistant Jim Dziura.http://bigrigmovie.com/bigrig/INFO5-about.html, official production notes Filming took place over four different two-week roadtrips. The crew of three did not schedule interviews with truckers: they would drive into a truck stop in their RV and approach the truckers for interviews. If the driver agreed, Pray would ride as the passenger and interview the driver for the day, while Blondheim followed in the RV. Most of the interviewees were very skeptical of the crew at first, and the crew was repeatedly thrown out of truck stops for soliciting interviews, which is typically not allowed. Director Pray and producer Blondheim became interested in a trucker documentary after a series of road trips to various concerts during the filming of Pray's Scratch.Doug Pray, Brad Blondheim, audio commentary on Big Rig DVD In 2001, Pray and Blondheim shot and edited a 10-minute film as a proof of concept for the film's production process.Big Rig Original Test Promo, included on Big Rig DVD For the film's music, producer Blondheim was inspired by the roots music featured in the film O Brother, Where Art Thou?. One of the music producers from Scratch interested them in the music of Buck 65. The final cut of the film uses several contributions from Buck 65; about one third of this was composed specifically for the film. The film was shot on a Panasonic Varicam and edited by the director using Final Cut Pro. In July 2012 it was announced by several in the truck driving community and by a source inside Ocule Films that there will be a sequel to the film, No time frame for when filming or production will begin on the sequel.

It can result from an increase in births (fertility rate), a decline in the mortality rate, an increase in immigration, or an unsustainable biome and depletion of resources. When overpopulation occurs, individuals limit available resources to survive.Pimentel, David, et al. \\"Natural resources and an optimum human population.\\" Population and environment 15.5 (1994): 347-369.Pimentel, David, et al. \\"Will limits of the Earth's resources control human numbers?.\\" Environment, Development and Sustainability 1.1 (1999): 19-39. The change in number of individuals per unit area in a given locality is an important variable that has a significant impact on the entire ecosystem.Singh, Rajeev Pratap, Anita Singh, and Vaibhav Srivastava, eds. Environmental issues surrounding human overpopulation. IGI Global, 2016.  Animal overpopulation  In the wild, overpopulation often causes growth in the populations of predators. This has the effect of controlling the prey population and ensuring its evolution in favor of genetic characteristics that render it less vulnerable to predation (and the predator may co-evolve, in response). In the absence of predators, species are bound by the resources they can find in their environment, but this does not necessarily control overpopulation, at least in the short term. An abundant supply of resources can produce a population boom followed by a population crash. Rodents such as lemmings and voles have such cycles of rapid population growth and subsequent decrease. Snowshoe hares populations similarly cycled dramatically, as did those of one of their predators, the lynx.K. G. Poole. (1994). Characteristics of an Unharvested Lynx Population during a Snowshoe Hare Decline The Journal of Wildlife Management, 58(4), 608-618 The introduction of a foreign species has often caused ecological disturbance, as when deer and trout were introduced into Argentina when rabbits were introduced to Australia, and indeed when predators such as cats were introduced in turn to attempt to control the rabbits. Some species such as locusts experience large natural cyclic variations, experienced by farmers as plagues.Simpson, Stephen J.; Sword, Gregory A. (2008). \\"Locusts\\". Current Biology 18:r364-366.  Human overpopulation  Human overpopulation occurs when the number of humans in a specific geographical location exceeds the carrying capacity of the place occupied by that group. Overpopulation can further be viewed, in a long term perspective, as existing when a population cannot be maintained given the rapid depletion of non-renewable resources or given the degradation of the capacity of the environment to give support to the population. The term human overpopulation also refers to the relationship between the entire human population and its environment: the Earth,\\"Global food crisis looms as climate change and population growth strip fertile land \\". The Guardian (31 August 2007). or to smaller geographical areas such as countries. Overpopulation can result from an increase in births, a decline in mortality rates against the background of high fertility rates,Zinkina J., Korotayev A. Explosive Population Growth in Tropical Africa: Crucial Omission in Development Forecasts (Emerging Risks and Way Out). World Futures 70/2 (2014): 120‚Äì139. an increase in immigration, or an unsustainable biome and depletion of resources. It is possible for very sparsely populated areas to be overpopulated if the area has a meagre or non-existent capability to sustain life (e.g. a desert). Advocates of population moderation cite issues like quality of life, carrying capacity and risk of starvation and disease as a basis to argue against continuing high human population growth and for population decline. Scientists suggest that the human impact on the environment as a result of overpopulation, profligate consumption and proliferation of technology has pushed the planet into a new geological epoch known as the Anthropocene.

It is a scholarly peer review journal embracing a broad range of topics within the field of art history; however, it aims to address interdisciplinary connections at the peripheries of art and other humanistic fields, such as psychology, sociology, philosophy, or literature. It appears twice a year, in hardback. The articles are in one of four languages: English, Italian, German, or French Artibus et Historiae is indexed in the Bibliography of the History of Art (BHA) and its articles are deposited in electronic form accessible through JSTOR. Title and Logo Artibus et Historiae takes its title from the private experiences of its founder and editor-in-chief, Polish art historian Dr. hab. J√≥zef Grabski. \\"Artibus\\" is an inscription on the fronton of an old and very prestigious art exhibition hall, \\"Zachƒôta\\" (Society for Encouragement of Fine Arts, founded in 1860), in his native Warsaw. The second part of the title, \\"Historiae\\", is a tribute paid to the Countess Karolina Lanckoro≈Ñska, professor of art history and editor of Polish historical sources in her own \\"Institutum Historicum Polonicum\\" in Rome, Italy. The logo of IRSA and Artibus et Historiae - a symbolic representation of a winged putto standing firmly on a balance, held in his own hands - comes from a Renaissance painting by Lorenzo Lotto (Portrait of a Man Aged Thirty-Seven. c. 1542 Collection Doria Pamphili, Rome) and symbolizes the Platonic idea of internal equilibrium between the spiritual and the physical aspects of the activities and existence of man. History Artibus et Historiae is the primary publication issued by IRSA. The idea of publishing a new art journal was conceived by Dr. Grabski in the late 1970s and realized after the International Congress of Art History (CIHA) in Bologna (1979). Thus IRSA Publishing House was brought into being and the first number of Artibus et Historiae appeared in 1980. It has since continued to feature groundbreaking articles at the forefront of art historical research. In 2019 the periodical will celebrate forty years of international readership. Journal Profile Artibus et Historiae presents scholarly contributions to the field of art history addressing a wide-ranging spectrum of topics. Although art history remains the main focus of the journal, many articles address interdisciplinary aspects at the frontiers of art and other humanistic fields, such as psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature. Likewise, articles are not limited to particular media or form and many address topics in photography or film as well as the theory and reception of art. Certain works, which due to their length, could not have been published in periodical form, have appeared as volumes in the series from Bibliotheca Artibus et Historiae.

A dog that conforms to most of the items of description in its individual breed standard is said to have good conformation. Unlike equine conformation, there are no fixed rules for dog conformation, as dogs are the most variable in appearance of any animals (\\"Phenotypic variation among dog breeds, whether it be in size, shape, or behavior, is greater than for any other animal\\"). Instead, conformation in dogs is based on the dog type from which the breed developed, along with many details that have been added to the breed standard for purposes of differentiation from other breeds, for working reasons, or for enhancing the beauty of the animals from the viewpoint of the fanciers who wrote the breed standards. Breed standards The breed standard for each breed of dog details desirable and undesirable attributes of appearance and temperament for an individual breed. Due to the great variability in dogs, there is no one standard of good conformation. What is good conformation for a lapdog will not be good conformation for a guard dog; good leg structure for a dog that must travel long distances will not be the same as good leg structure for dogs whose conformation requires short bursts of speed. Breed standards are designed solely to describe the breed's history and purpose, temperament, and appearance. The breed standard is not a checkbox list of requirements, but rather a description, giving a detailed \\"word picture\\" of an idealized dog of that breed. Requirements for documentation, genetic testing, health testing, testing for particular styles of work or fitness for particular dog sports or requirements for training are beyond the scope of a breed standard, and are instead developed as breeder guidelines by breed clubs, kennel clubs, or even by national agricultural department rules. Conformation refers solely to the externally visible details of a dog's structure and appearance, along with the dog's expected temperament, which varies for each breed or type of dog.

The Laplace transform is \\"half\\" of a Fourier transform; from the decomposition :L^2(\\\\mathbb{R})=L^2(-\\\\infty,0) \\\\oplus L^2(0,\\\\infty) one then obtains an orthogonal decomposition of L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}) into two Hardy spaces :L^2(\\\\mathbb{R})= H^2\\\\left(\\\\mathbb{C}^-\\\\right) \\\\oplus H^2\\\\left(\\\\mathbb{C}^+\\\\right). This is essentially the Paley-Wiener theorem.  See also * H‚àû References * Jonathan R.

The first hot Neptune to be discovered with certainty was Gliese 436 b in 2007, an exoplanet about 33 light years away. Recent observations have revealed a larger potential population of hot Neptunes in the Milky Way than was previously thought.Oligarchic formation of hot Neptunes Hot Neptunes may have formed either in situ or ex situ.  General characteristics  Because of their close proximity to their parent star, hot Neptunes have a much greater rate and chance of transiting their star as seen from a farther outlying point, than planets of the same mass in larger orbits. This increases the chances of discovering them by transit-based observation methods. Transiting hot Neptunes include Gliese 436 b and HAT-P-11b. Gliese 436 b (also known as GJ 436b) was the first hot Neptune to be discovered with certainty in 2007. The exoplanet Mu Arae c (or HD 160691 c) discovered in 2004 might also be a hot Neptune, but it has not been determined definitively. Another may be Kepler-56b, which has a mass somewhat larger than Neptune's and orbits its star at 0.1 AU, closer than Mercury orbits the sun. The first theoretical study of how hot Neptunes could form was carried out in 2004. If these planets formed ex situ, i.e., by migrating to their current locations while growing, they may contain large quantities of frozen volatiles and amorphous ices. Otherwise, if they formed in situ, their inventory of heavy elements should be made entirely of refractory materials. Yet, regardless of the mode of formation, hot Neptunes should contain large fractions (by mass) of gases, primarily hydrogen and helium, which also accounts for most of their volume. Ultra-hot Neptune LTT 9779b is the first ultra-hot Neptune discovered with an orbital period of 19 hours and an atmospheric temperature of over 1700 degrees Celsius. Being so close to its star and with a mass around twice that of Neptune, its atmosphere should have evaporated into space so its existence requires an unusual explanation.SEPTEMBER 22, 2020,The first ultra-hot Neptune, LTT 9779b, is one of nature's improbable planets, by Peter Thorley, University of WarwickAn Ultra-Hot Neptune in the Neptune desert, James S.

During halftime of Tech's September 20, 2008, football game against the University of Massachusetts, Williams entered a promotional contest in which he made a 30-yard field goal. He caught the attention of head coach Mike Leach, who liked the fundamentals he used on the kick. Leach wanted him on the team, and although it was initially thought he would not be immediately eligible, the NCAA granted a one-time exception based on the specific circumstances. He was allowed to play immediately as he had not been recruited by Tarleton State and also because he was never a scholarship player. However, the season he played on Tarleton State's squad counted toward his eligibility, making him a sophomore during his first year at Tech. He also had to reject the free rent he won in the contest in order to remain eligible. Williams made his debut in a 63‚Äì21 win over Kansas where he was a perfect 9 for 9 on PATs.

Life The son of Thomas Bilsland Lang, a medical practitioner, and his wife Emily Smith, he was born in Groombridge in Sussex on 12 May 1874. Lang was educated at Dennistoun Public School in Glasgow before being accepted into the University of Glasgow, where he graduated with a Bsc (Hons) in botany and zoology in 1894. He qualified for medicine in 1895 but never became a practicing doctor; thanks to his own enthusiasm and the encouragement of his teacher Frederick Orpen Bower he instead became a professional botanist. His first research was on the structure of ferns, something Bower was apparently an authority on, and Lang soon followed him in that regard. He moved to study at the Jodrell Laboratory on a Robert Donaldson scholarship in 1895, where he focused on the apomixis of ferns, and discovered a sporangium on the prothallus of a fern at a time when biologists were exploring alternate means of reproduction in plants. In 1899 he travelled to Sri Lanka and Malaya to study tropical cryptogams and collect samples, returning to Britain in 1902, when he became a lecturer at the University of Glasgow; while there he worked closely with D. T. Gwynne-Vaughan and Bower, with the three of them being known as the \\"triumvirate\\". After Gwynne- Vaughan's death in 1915 he studied preserved plant remnants in Aberdeen, making great insights into the nature of Psilophyton, which until then had been neglected. In 1900 he was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by the University of Glasgow, and when the Barker chair of cryptogamic botany was created at the University of Manchester Lang was the first choice. He took up his duties in 1909. In 1911 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and was awarded a Royal Medal in 1931 for 'his work on the anatomy and morphology of the fern-like fossils of the Old Red Sandstone.' In 1926 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Frederick Orpen Bower, Sir John Graham Kerr, Diarmid Noel Paton and George Alexander Gibson. He won the Society's ]Neill Prize for the period 1915-1917. In 1932 he received an honorary doctorate (LLD) from the University of Glasgow, followed by a second honorary doctorate from Manchester University in 1942. He was also a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. After his retirement he moved to Westmorland. His wife died in 1959 following a period of ill-health, and he followed barely a year later at his home in Milnthorpe on 29 August 1960. Family He married his cousin, Elsa Valentine, in 1910. They had no children.

It is one of the few DS games to receive an ESRB rating of M for \\"Mature\\" and a CERO rating of C or \\"ages 15 and older\\". The game was released on September 11, 2008 in Japan and on October 30, 2008 in North America. Arc System Works acquired the rights to the series in 2017. The game is a part of the mobile phone game series of the same name, and contains a remake of the original game, retitled Dear Martel.https://news.mynavi.jp/article/20080807-a030/ Premise Theresia is a psychological horror visual novel adventure game from a first-person perspective, consisting of two stories, each sharing a common background: an unnamed country, presumably under strict martial law by the time the game takes place, is engaged in a fierce and bloody war with an unspecified opposing nation. No further details are provided: the player is then thrust directly into the role of Leanne, the protagonist of the first half of the story. Upon completion of the main game, a shorter second chapter is unlocked, consisting of a remake of the series' original phone game. Featuring an unnamed protagonist, it provides a deeper insight into the overarching background narrative. Throughout the course of the game, both characters have to explore their confinements, trying to escape and learn the details of their past, avoiding traps and coming face-to-face with personal demons and other psychological dilemmas along the way. The game makes use of the Nintendo DS touchscreen capabilities. Gameplay Gameplay is divided into two modes: a movement mode, where the player navigates the facility and searching for different rooms, and an observational mode, in which the player investigates certain areas and solves puzzles. During the latter mode, the player may activate traps that harm the player and reduce their life bar. Only careful observation or usage of a found 2x4 can reveal them to the character to prevent harm. The player can regain lost health via the use of found elixirs. Plot =Dear Emile= Leanne, a teenage girl wakes up in a small, barely lit room. She has no memories, and the only tangible clue is the word Theresia scribbled upon a piece of paper. The first areas of the game are used to instruct the player on the controls, set the atmosphere and introduce the survival aspect: in fact, the building reveals itself to not only be merely the sub-basement of a larger complex, but also to be riddled with traps, each hidden in even the most unexpected places. Most of the doors are locked, barricaded, or lead to places blocked by environmental hazards created by the state of disrepair permeating the structure. Proceeding, Leanne discovers that the place is an underground facility containing a prison, stretching over several underground stories and including waterworks, storage and torture rooms, even some unknown crypts. By reaching the upper levels, more of the setting and personal background of Leanne are revealed: the country is losing the war, and the prison is part of a military installation which includes a testing laboratory, run by a woman named Maylee, who Leanne has seen in flashbacks. She also has flashbacks of a young man named Sacha and a silver- haired woman, who was drenched in and smelled of blood. Evidence reveals that the testing revolves around a bioweapon of the enemy, known to cause uncontrollable hemorrhaging, high fever, madness, amnesia, and ultimately death as the body gradually swells and turns purple. After the death of someone infected, it becomes a highly contagious airborne virus, making the corpses highly contagious. In order to stop the virus, known was Epicari, from spreading, the bodies would be burned. As Leanne finally reaches the surface, she visits the above-ground portion of the installation, built under a church, until finally reaching the commander's office. Journal entries and notes Leanne has discovered along the way cause her to have flashbacks and gain back bits and pieces of her memory. She remembers that, as an infant, she was the sole survivor of a village destroyed in the war. Leanne grew up mostly at the church, watched over by the priest who ran it. She caught the eye of a young boy named Sacha and longed to talk to him, but had not due to her mother making her promise never to talk to anyone but her. Sacha and Leanne began exchanging letters in secret. When Emile discovered Sacha embracing Leanne, the woman ran at him with a knife. One of the other church members got in the way and was killed. Emile was restrained and taken to the underground part of the facility. She was no longer allowed to visit Leanne. Epicari had begun to surface, and many people were dying. Maylee showed up with a bunch of scientists and was able to create a cure from Emile's blood. This was called \\"Theresia\\", which was her last name. She reminded Maylee of someone, whose blood also was used to create a cure in the past. Leanne also made her think of this person, as the girl would pray for the infected without fear as their corpses were burned. As the virus continued to spread, the military decided to move everyone underground, to the large area they had been using as a base. Though Sacha tried to convince Leanne to run away with him, as the two had fallen in love with each other, Leanne couldn't forget Emile. She asked Maylee to take her to see her mother. The minute Emile saw Leanne, she took her to one of the prison cells, put her in chains, and locked her up. Leanne did not mind this, though, as she was happy to be her mother's alone and enjoyed being visited by her. Eventually, the military ordered the deaths of everyone not on their staff, hoping to finally stop the virus from spreading. Sacha came to release a reluctant Leanne, but was discovered by Emile. He pointed a gun at her, but she calmed him down and hugged him by singing him a lullaby she often used to sing an infant Leanne. She took the gun from him and shot him in the head, killing him. Then, she tried to escape with Leanne and was assisted by Maylee, who had come to care for the two of them. Emile murdered many of her own comrades in an effort to protect her daughter, and it is the memory of this which makes Leanne realize that her mother really did love her. At some point, Leanne herself had become infected with Epicari. She was given the vaccine Theresia made from her mother's blood by Maylee, but a side-effect of both the virus and the vaccine was amnesia, thus why she couldn't remember anything upon waking up. The one who left her journal entries was likely Emile, who wanted her to remember. Emile is also the one who set up the traps, out of a twisted sense of love. She was keeping Leanne safe by preventing people from getting to her, as well as preventing her from leaving. In the commander's office, Leanne finds what seems to be the body of her mother and mourns her death. She leaves some red flowers that also held a strong place in her memory, as she often spent time with both her mother and Maylee among them. She takes the final key needed for her escape, with her mother had seemingly been protecting. Casting aside everything on her person, along with the pendant her mother had given her, Leanne escapes the destructing facility. Outside, she finds an abandoned infant, which she resolves to take in. After the credits, the camera zooms in on Leanne kneeling outside with the baby, Emile standing behind her. There is a strange noise, and the camera falls over. It is unclear what this means, though popular theories are that the body Leanne found was not Emile's, and that the woman was still alive and had attacked her in order to stop her from escaping or that this was symbolic of Leanne still being in her mother's clutches, as she starts to follow the same path as her-taking in an orphaned child and passing on a twisted sense of love. =Dear Martel= Martel was the name of his sister, who had a different father than him. After the death of their mother soon after she was born, he sent her to an orphanage ran by their grandfather. He was adopted and continued his studies. Years later, he returns to the orphanage to be a doctor and to do research. He is reunited with Martel, who has grown into a kind, beautiful young woman. The two seem to get along well. He also becomes friends with two other doctors there Franz and Maylee. The doctor becomes very happy with his new family. Unfortunately, the doctors unknowingly create the Epicari virus and infect the children. As the virus spreads, they request help from the government. Soldiers come, but only to forcibly take samples from the children. The orphanage is then quarantined. As more and more children die, the doctor, Franz, and Maylee struggle to find a cure. Martel buries the dead children without fear of being infected herself, and the fact that she doesn't eventually leads to the creation of the vaccine Theresia from her blood (it's theorized Martel and Emile share the same father, since the blood of both could be used to make the vaccine, meaning they shared DNA). By this time, Franz was unknowingly infected with Epicari. He had suddenly started hiding his face, claiming he hated how he looked. One of the symptoms of the virus was the exacerbation of personal issues, but because they falsely believed the virus only affected children, they didn't realize this until it was too late. Eventually he went mad and attacked people with an axe. When his mask fell off, he killed himself by ramming his face into the axe embedded in the wall. Though they finally managed to create the vaccine, the place was stormed by soldiers. The staff tried to tell them that they now had a cure, the soldiers were relentless and used flamethrowers to massacre all the children and many of the staff. The doctor managed to hide with Martel, but was separated from Maylee. She ultimately survived, going on to try and create more of the vaccine as shown in Dear Emile's story. When everything was over, the doctor and Martel left their hiding places. A disheveled and slightly-bloody Martel stepped on and killed an insect without realizing it. The doctor, who was unknowingly suffering from Epicari himself, snaps from this sight and strangles her. He buries her amongst the red flowers she had grown outside the orphanage. Knowing he will soon forget, the doctor leaves the notes and journal entries to remind him what he has done. He also sets up the traps and writes the messages on the wall, as a way to punish himself for what he has done. After getting the vaccine and remembering everything, the doctor desperately tries to dig up Martel's body but cannot find it. He is happened upon by Maylee, who talks with him.

Her generative work, Psychological Testing, remains a classic text in which she drew attention to the individual being tested and therefore to the responsibilities of the testers. She called for them to go beyond test scores, to search the assessed individual's history to help them to better understand their own results and themselves. Known as the ‚Äútest guru‚Äù, Anastasi focused on what she believed to be the appropriate use of psychometric tests. As stated in an obituary, ‚ÄúShe made major conceptual contributions to the understanding of the manner in which psychological development is influenced by environmental and experiential factors. Her writings have provided incisive commentary on test construction and the proper application of psychological tests.‚ÄùReznikoff, M & Procidano, M (2001): \\"Anne Anastasi (1908-2001)\\", American Psychologist, 56:816-817 According to Anastasi, such tests only revealed what the test-taker knows at the time; they did not explain test scores. In addition, any psychometric measurement must take into account that aptitude is context- dependent. Anastasi stressed the importance of the role of the tester to correctly select, conduct, and evaluate tests. She was president of the American Psychological Association in 1972, the third ever woman to be elected. In 1984, she was given the American Psychological Foundation's Gold Medal. In 1987, she was awarded the National Medal of Science. Family and Education Anne Anastasi was born on December 19, 1908 in New York City to Anthony Anastasi and Theresa Gaudiosi Anastasi. Her father died when she was a baby, and his family did not remain in contact. She grew up with her mother, her mother's brother, and her grandmother. Theresa Gaudiosi Anastasi supported the family, eventually working for the Italian newspaper Il Progresso. Anne was homeschooled by her grandmother until sixth grade. After brief periods in public and preparatory schools, she entered Barnard College at age 15. Her interests in mathematics and psychology. She graduated from Barnard College with a bachelor's degree at age 20 in 1928, and completed a Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1930. Anastasi was hired by Harry Hollingworth to teach at Barnard, where she remained from 1930 to 1939. She worked at Queens College, City University of New York from 1939 to 1947, becoming chair of the department. She worked at Fordham University from 1947 to 1979, serving as chair from 1968‚Äì1974. She retired as a full professor in 1979, and became a professor emeritus. In 1933, Anastasi married John Porter Foley, Jr. (1910-1994), an industrial psychologist. The following year, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She was treated with radium, which destroyed the cancer but caused her to become infertile. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, she and her husband could only find work in different cities, she in New York and he in Washington, D.C. Anastasi died in New York on May 4, 2001. Differential Psychology In 1937 Anastasi published the first edition of Differential Psychology, a nearly 900-page pioneering work on what she defined as ‚Äúthe scientific study of differences between groups‚Äù Her definition encompassed not only race and ethnicity, but also group differences reflective of age, education, family, gender, religion, and social class. Her approach to the study of culture and difference has been described as an \\"elegant model\\" that incorporates a number of current fields of study with \\"brilliant simplicity\\". Anastasi also addressed the methodological challenges involved in studying group differences. These were clearly demonstrated in the 1930s by Nazi ‚Äúrace science‚Äù. Anastasi's summary of such work was blistering: ‚ÄúThe array of evidence in support of this [Aryan supremacy] is incomplete and one- sided at its best, and fantastic and mythical at its worst.‚Äù Between the methodological difficulties involved and the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis, differential psychology largely disappeared as a field of research. By 1954, Anastasi herself had moved from the study of group differences to that of individual differences. Anastasi published three editions of Differential Psychology (1937, 1949, 1958). In 1985 the American Psychological Foundation described it as a ‚Äúclassic\\" text and a model of \\"clarity, comprehensiveness, and synthesis‚Äù. Psychological Testing = Problems Addressed = Anastasi's (1983) essay ‚ÄúWhat Do Intelligence Tests Measure?‚ÄùAnastasi, A. (A) (1983): \\"What do intelligence tests measure?\\" In S.B. Anderson & J.S. Hemlick (Eds.), On Educational Testing: Intelligence, Performance Standards, Test Anxiety, and Latent Traits, (pp. 5-28). San Francisco: CA: Jossey-Bass, Inc. aimed to correct misinterpretations regarding the understanding and use of aptitude and personality tests. Anastasi pointed out that the ‚Äútesting boom‚Äù of the 1920s caused the term IQ to be adopted and misused by the general public. According to Anastasi, the misappropriation of the term created connotations that intelligence is heritable, stable throughout one's lifespan, and resistant to change.Anastasi, A. (A). In contrast, Anastasi emphasized that psychometric scores convey an individual's present status of what he or she knows. She cautioned against interpreting such tests as serving a strong predictive function, as scores only indicated to what degree a person acquired the knowledge and skills for the criterion of a given test. They evaluate for what is in high demand within a specific context; what an individual can achieve in the future depends not only on his or her present intellectual status as determined by the test, but also on subsequent experiences. Therefore, Anastasi advocated against psychometric tests definitively labelling a person, as they assess for specific types of knowledge and do not account for how intelligence can change over time. Important to Anastasi was an understanding of the cultural frames of reference within which a test is developed. She stated that ‚ÄúNo intelligence test can be culture free, because human intelligence is not culture free‚Äù. Therefore, according to Anastasi, the first step in developing an intelligence test within a given culture was formulating a task analysis in order to determine how well individuals gain knowledge valued within that culture. = Methods= Anastasi mostly applied existing methods to individual and group ability testing, as well as self- report inventories and measuring interests and attitudes. She followed the methodological principles of norms, reliability, validity, and item analysis. The essay ‚ÄúPsychological Testing: Basic Concepts and Common Misconceptions,‚ÄùAnastasi, A. (B) (1985): \\"Psychological testing: basic concepts and common misconceptions\\" In A.M. Rogers & C.J. Sheirer (Eds.), G. Stanley Hall Lecture Series, 5 (pp. 87-120). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. encapsulates Anastasi's methodological positions. Anastasi stressed that, in order to evaluate any psychometric test, the tester must be knowledgeable of the main features of the tests, particularly as they apply to norms, validity, and reliability. Her approach to standard scores and standard deviation was one in which she believed that understanding statistical concepts was essential to understanding the meaning of statistical computation.Anastasi, A. (B). In regards to criterion-referenced tests, Anastasi diverged from educational psychologist Robert Glaser, who first introduced the concept in 1963.Glaser, R. (1963): \\"Instrumental technology and the measurement of learning outcomes\\", American Psychologist, 18: 519-522. Instead of approaching such tests as fundamentally different from norm- referenced tests, Anastasi maintained that the two could be combined to give a more comprehensive evaluation of the individual's test performance. An example is the Stanford Diagnostic Test in reading and mathematics, which assesses specific subject mastery by combining both interpretations. Anastasi recognized that there are many types of test reliability. However, when dealing with standardized testing, much of the variance in reliability can be minimized by controlling such conditions as the testing environment, rapport, instructions, and time limits. In contrast with the belief that there are three kinds of validity - content validity, criterion validity, and construct validity - Anastasi espoused to the then-growing belief of the mid-1980s that many more procedures could be used to build validity into a test. Defining the constructs to be assessed initiates the validation process. It culminates with ‚Äúvalidating and cross-validating various scores through statistical analyses against external, real-life criteria‚Äù. = Difference between aptitude and achievement test = In Psychological Testing: Basic Concepts and Common Misconceptions, Anastasi clarified differences between types of tests. Two differences between aptitude tests and achievement tests are test use and the degree of experiential specificity forming the foundation of the tests‚Äô construction. Achievement tests are used to assess current status; aptitude tests can predict future performance as defined by their specific criteria. Experiential specificity is narrowly defined for achievement tests, such as SAT Subject Tests. In contrast, the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales aptitude tests are based on broad knowledge of American culture beginning in the twentieth century. = Theoretical stance= Anastasi's theoretical framework that ability or intelligence change with experience and that their cultural context dictates their parameters informed her methodological approach to psychometric testing. Tests should be selected and used while bearing in mind their contextual appropriateness and limitations. She emphasized that tests serve specific functions in Western society, such as school/occupational placement or to assess for mental disabilities. = Criticism= The 1955 first edition of Psychological Testing was criticized for attributing test results only to individual differences, instead of recognizing that ‚Äú‚Äòoccasional differences‚Äô are also measured by means of tests\\".Guilford, J. (1955): \\"Review of Psychological Testing, Psychological Bulletin, 52(1), 97-98. In the latest edition of the book, Anastasi and her co-author Susana Urbina suggested that more accurate results can be obtained by combining information from several fairly homogeneous tests. Each one would cover a single trait, or different aspect of the criterion.

Swynnerton was born in Folkestone, Kent on 3 December 1877. His father was a senior chaplain in the Indian Army, and his mother the daughter of Major W. H. Massy, of Grantstown Hall, Tipperary. Swynnerton spent his early years in India, returning to England to start his schooling at Lancing College in Sussex. In 1897 he was accepted at Oxford University, but emigrated to Africa instead. In Natal he met the renowned entomologist and authority on Curculionidae, Guy Anstruther Knox Marshall (1871‚Äì1959), who owned some farms in Southern Rhodesia and persuaded Swynnerton to manage one of these in the Melsetter district. In 1900 he became manager of Gungunyana Farm close to the Chirinda Forest in the Chipinga District - this farm was also bought by Guy Marshall in 1902. For the following 19 years Swynnerton used the farm as a base and worked on comprehensive collections of plants, birds and insects, the plants being written up later in 1911 in J. Linn. Soc. (Bot.) 40:1-245 as Flora of Gazaland. The British Museum was a regular recipient of his plant and insect specimens which were lauded for displaying \\"a precision in localisation and notes on economic uses which made this collection a model one\\". He was elected a Fellow of the Linnaean Society in 1907. From the farm he made a number of collecting trips to the nearby Chimanimani Mountains. During this period Guy Marshall became chief editor of the Bulletin of Entomological Research and remained a close friend and mentor to Swynnerton.Flora of Zimbabwe The Rhodesian government appointed him in 1918 to research the tsetse fly problem, later that year extending his brief to also cover Mo√ßambique. In 1919 he was appointed as the first game warden of Tanganyika, again with a brief to investigate the tsetse situation, and becoming Director of Tsetse Research at Shinyanga ten years later. In 1937 he was awarded the Order of St Michael and St George. However, on 8 June 1938, on his way to receiving the award, he died in a de Havilland Leopard Moth plane crash near Mjari in Tanganyika.

In a single generation, a cell can only influence its nearest neighbours, and so the speed of light (by analogy with the speed of light in physics) is the maximum rate at which information can propagate. It is therefore an upper bound to the speed at which any pattern can move. Notation As in physics, the speed of light is represented with the letter c. This in turn is used as a reference for describing the average propagation speed of any given type of spaceship. For example, a glider is said to have a speed of c/4, as it takes four generations for a given state to be translated by one cell. Similarly, the \\"lightweight spaceship\\" is said to have a speed of c/2, as it takes four generations for a given state to be translated by two cells. Lightspeed propagation While c is an absolute upper bound to propagation speed, the maximum speed of a spaceship in Conway's Game of Life is in fact c/2. This is because it's impossible to build a spaceship that can move every generation. (This is not true, though, for cellular automata in general; for instance many light-speed spaceships exist in Seeds.) It is, however, possible for objects to travel at the speed of light if they move through a medium other than empty space. Such media include trails of hives, and alternating stripes of live and dead cells. Faster than light propagation Certain patterns can appear to move at a speed greater than one cell per generation, but like faster than light phenomena in physics this is illusory. An example is the \\"Star Gate\\", an arrangement of three converging gliders that will mutually annihilate on collision. If a lightweight spaceship (LWSS) hits the colliding gliders, it will appear to move forwards by 11 cells in only 6 generations, and thus travel faster than light. This illusion happens because the glider annihilation reaction proceeds by the creation and soon-after destruction of another LWSS. When the incoming LWSS hits the colliding gliders, it isn't transported, but instead modifies the reaction so that the newly created LWSS can survive. The only signal being transmitted is that determining whether the outgoing LWSS should survive or not. This does not need to reach its destination until after the LWSS has been \\"transported\\", and so no information needs to travel faster than light.

Origins The long vodka is claimed to have been invented in Lancashire, England in 1978 by Jacky Bevan. Bevan was a barmaid who, instead of making a gin gimlet as requested, accidentally made the drink with vodka instead of gin. She tried this combination and found it too bitter; she added lemonade to the drink and the first iteration of the drink was created. When Bevan visited a pub in Inverkeilor, Scotland in 1981 and requested the drink, the bartender was intrigued by her drink choice and added it to his cocktail menu. It is believed that shortly afterwards the drink became known in nearby Aberdeen and Montrose, and it quickly gained popularity around Scotland. The rinse of Angostura bitters and the name 'long vodka' were added sometime after this.  Preparation  A long vodka is made by adding lemonade, or soda water, and lime cordial to 1 or 2 shots of vodka on ice. The glass can either be rinsed (and then emptied) with Angostura bitters, or 2‚Äì3 drops can be added to taste; distinguishing the drink from a vodka lime and lemonade.

The six Extra Continental regiments, which were authorized by Congress and organized in late 1775 to mid-1776, are distinct by having formed without any administrative connection to an individual state.Wright, pp. 319‚Äì321. The 16 Additional Continental regiments were approved by Congress as a separate group on December 27, 1776, specifically in response to a request from Gen. George Washington for additional troops, and Congress expressly delegated their formation directly to Washington. All Additional Continental regiments were organized in the spring and summer of 1777.Wright, pp. 321‚Äì325. In contrast to both the Extra and Additional regiments, all other infantry regiments of the army were organized and supported under the direct authority of individual state governments (the \\"line regiments\\"). Extra Continental regiments The six Extra Continental regiments, which are commonly confused with the Additional regiments, are: *Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment *Warner's Regiment (Green Mountain Boys) *1st Canadian Regiment *2nd Canadian Regiment *German Battalion *DuBois' Regiment (later, the 3rd New York Regiment) Additional Continental regiments The 16 Additional Continental regiments formed later and under distinctly different circumstances than those of the Extra Continental regiments.Wright, pp. 98‚Äì99. The 1-year enlistments in most Continental Army regiments that formed in the earliest part of the American Revolutionary War expired on December 31, 1776. Therefore, Congress and Washington began preparations for reorganizing the army during that early fall. The reorganization was to apply to troops from every state, and a major factor in the new plan was the decision to recruit for the duration of the war rather than for a single year. Eighty-eight regiments were authorized by a Congressional resolve of September 16, 1776, in which Congress formally outlined the 13 state lines of the Continental Army by specifying the quota of regiments for each state.Ford, v. 5, pp. 762‚Äì763. Congress' estimates of the population of each state governed its allocation of regiments, ranging from 15 regiments each from Massachusetts and Virginia to single regiments from Delaware and Georgia. In correspondence to Congress during December 1776, however, Washington pressed for even more men.Washington to Congress (December 16, 1776). Central to Washington's position was a recommendation to increase the infantry regiments from the 88 called for in September to a minimum of 110.Washington to Congress (December 20, 1776). Congress acted on Washington's request on December 27, 1776, and ruled \\"That General Washington shall be, and he is hereby, vested with full, ample, and complete powers to raise‚Ä¶from‚Ä¶all of these United States, 16 battalions of infantry, in addition to those already voted by Congress‚Ä¶\\"Ford, v. 6, pp. 1045‚Äì1046. In contrast to the previously approved 88 regiments, the 16 Additional regiments were organized directly by Washington's authority, rather than by the authority of the state governments, and were placed completely under Washington's control. The resolution gave Washington the requested 110 regiments, for in addition to the 16 new regiments and the 88 units of the September quotas there were the 6 Extra regiments that had been previously approved by Congress and that were also not explicitly tied to a single state. The 16 Additional Continental regiments are: *Cornell's Additional Continental Regiment (never formed) *Forman's Additional Continental Regiment *Gist's Additional Continental Regiment *Grayson's Additional Continental Regiment *Hartley's Additional Continental Regiment *Henley's Additional Continental Regiment *Jackson's Additional Continental Regiment *Lee's Additional Continental Regiment *Malcolm's Additional Continental Regiment *Patton's Additional Continental Regiment *Scammell's Additional Continental Regiment (never formed) *Sheppard's Additional Continental Regiment *Sherburne's Additional Continental Regiment *Spencer's Additional Continental Regiment *Thruston's Additional Continental Regiment *Webb's Additional Continental Regiment Although Washington wrote to Col.

Dr. Basavaraju died on the night of 29 January 2012 at Mysore.  Awards  He received several awards, including: * 1977 - Karnataka Sahitya Academy. * 1994 - Kannada Rajyothsava Award * 1994 - Karnataka Sahitya Akademi Award for Poetry for Thaanaanthara * 2000 - Sahitya Akademi prize for translation to Kannada. * 2005 - Bhasha Samman conferred by Central Sahitya Akademi. * 2005 ‚Äì Basava Puraskara * 2008 - Nadoja Award by Kannada University The other awards conferred on him are Chidhananda Award, Prof. Sam.Shi.

The areas of his specialization included textual criticism, prosody, literary research and translation. He tried his hand in poetry as well and published three collections. Basavaraju was born in Idagur a small village in Kolar district. After receiving early education in Idagur, Siddaganga and Bangalore, he moved to Mysore for higher education. He obtained B.A (Hons) (1946) and M.A. (1951) degrees in Kannada from the University of Mysore. He was awarded a D.Litt. degree from the same University for his work ‚ÄòShivadasa Geetanjali‚Äô. After an early stint of teaching at Davanagere and The Yuvaraja‚Äôs college, Mysore, Basavaraju joined the Institute of Kannada Studies in the University of Mysore in 1967 and retired in 1979. Basavaraju brought many innovative ideas to the field of textual criticism. His sole aim was to bring the literary classics and scholarly treatises of Kannada within the reach of the common man un- acquainted with old Kannada. He prepared simplified prose versions of many important texts. He also experimented with splitting the poems in ancient texts in to their morphological components and then arranging them in a more communicable order, with appropriate punctuation marks. Before undertaking these innovative steps he worked diligently with old paper ones and palm leaf manuscripts and strove to get to the original version. He was quite secular in his choice of works and chose Jaina classics such as Adipurana, Buddhist classics such as Ashvaghosha‚Äôs ‚ÄòBuddhacharita‚Äô and also works such as Toraveya Ramayana and Shabdamanidarpana. The works edited by L.Basavaraju include:- *Basaveshvara Vachanasangraha (1952) *Allamana Vachanachandrike (1960) *Shivadasa Geethanjali (1963) *Basava Vachanamrutha (In two parts) (1964, 1970 and 1989) *Akkana Vachanagalu (1966) *Allamana Vachanagalu (1969) *Basavannanavara Vachanagalu (1996) *Basavannanavara Shatsthalada Vachanagalu (1990) *Devara Dasimayyana Vachanagalu *Sarvajnana Vachanagalu (‚ÄòParamartha‚Äô) (1972) *Bedagina Vachanagalu (1998) *Shivaganaprasadi Mahadevayyana Prabhudevara Shunyasampadane (1969) *Kalyanada Mayidevana Shivanubhava Sutra (1998) *Pampana ‚ÄòAdipurana‚Äô (1976) *Pampana ‚ÄòSarala Pampabharata‚Äô (1999) *Pampana ‚ÄòSamasta Bharatha Kathamrutha‚Äô (2000) *Pampana ‚ÄòSarala Adipurana‚Äô (2002) *Pampana Adipurana Kathamrutha (2003) *Rannana ‚ÄòSarala Gadayuddha‚Äô (2005) *‚ÄòChikkadevaraya Saptapadi‚Äô by Tirumalarya (1971) *‚ÄòTorave Ramayana Sangraha‚Äô (1951) *‚ÄòSarala Siddaramacharite‚Äô (2000) *Raghavankana ‚ÄòSarala Harishchandra Kavya‚Äô (2001) *‚ÄòKannada Chandassamputa‚Äô (1974) :(This is an edited work, containing all the four ancient Kannada works on prosody.

During their first season, the Triangles, clad in bright yellow and green uniforms, played in the WTT Eastern Division with teams from Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Baltimore, Detroit, Cleveland, and Toronto-Buffalo. WTT also had an eight-team Western Division for a total of 16 teams representing most of the major metropolitan areas in the United States. There was even a team from Hawaii called the Leis. The Triangles folded following the 1976 season. With Pittsburgh and Philadelphia both lacking franchises, the league had considered fielding a team called the Pennsylvania Keystones in 1977, composed of players from the Soviet Union. However, with the Cleveland Nets struggling to draw fans for their home matches, owner Joseph Zingale decided to fill the WTT void in nearby Pittsburgh and have his team play approximately half of its home matches in Richfield Township, Summit County, Ohio and the other half in Pittsburgh. The team was called the Cleveland-Pittsburgh Nets. After the Nets announced they would play half their matches in Pittsburgh, the league had planned to have the Keystones play in Philadelphia. The team of Soviet players did compete in WTT in 1977, but it did not have a permanent home and played its \\"home\\" matches in several different cities. The name Pennsylvania Keystones was scrapped, and the team was officially called the Soviet National Team and informally the Soviets. As for the Nets, they played approximately half their 1977 home matches at the Coliseum at Richfield and the other half at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh. The Nets also played some \\"home\\" matches in Nashville, New Orleans and Hollywood, Florida. Coaching The Australian tennis star Ken Rosewall coached the original Pittsburgh Triangles team in 1974. Rosewall's top players were Evonne Goolagong, who had already captured her first Wimbledon singles title in 1971, and young phenom Vitas Gerulaitis. Vitas, nicknamed the Lithuanian Lion, had recently won the West Penn Open in Mt. Lebanon and would go on to win the 1975 Wimbledon men's doubles crown (with Sandy Mayer) and the 1977 Australian Open men's singles title.

The AIWF aims to brings equal rights to men and women in the workforce, and in society in general.  History  The Forum was founded in 2001 by Haifa Fahoum Al Kaylani, who began with the vision of putting to help Arab women become \\"part and parcel of the international community\\". She put together a formal network of Arab and international businesswomen as well as female community leaders to expand the growing role of women in the global marketplace and decision-making. Al Kaylani is also member of the Suzanne Mubarak Women's International Peace Movement and is also a member of the Women's Leadership Board at the Harvard University. The AIWF 2005 report called Engines of economic growth in the Arab world suggested that Arab men be given paternal leave from work to look after children rather than leaving all the work to women, through role balancing. In 2011, the AIWF launched the Young Arab Women Leaders initiative to specifically support young Arab women. The 10th edition was held in 2017 at the London Royal Academy of Engineering.  Description  One idea is that women are given educational and working opportunities meaning that they will be able to make their mark in society as a whole and as individuals. By allowing women to educate themselves and give them more access to computers, technology and university scholarships they can achieve business, educational and governmental roles. Businesses and organisations have been able to contact and associate with people in their same position located in other countries. Arab women residing in Britain and Europe can now make business engagements with ladies in the Middle East giving them more potential for business and community work and profit.

They are able to provide linear measurements of firing activity of single neurons, large neuronal populations or activity of myocytes. Many physiological processes are accompanied by changes in cell membrane potential which can be detected with voltage sensitive dyes. Measurements may indicate the site of action potential origin, and measurements of action potential velocity and direction may be obtained. Potentiometric dyes are used to monitor the electrical activity inside cell organelles where it is not possible to insert an electrode, such as the mitochondria and Dendritic spine. This technology is especially powerful for the study of patterns of activity in complex multicellular preparations. It also makes possible the measurement of spatial and temporal variations in membrane potential along the surface of single cells. Types of dyes Fast-response probes: These are amphiphilic membrane staining dyes which usually have a pair of hydrocarbon chains acting as membrane anchors and a hydrophilic group which aligns the chromophore perpendicular to the membrane/aqueous interface. The chromophore is believed to undergo a large electronic charge shift as a result of excitation from the ground to the excited state and this underlies the putative electrochromic mechanism for the sensitivity of these dyes to membrane potential. This molecule (dye) intercalates among the lipophilic part of biological membranes. This orientation assures that the excitation induced charge redistribution will occur parallel to the electric field within the membrane. A change in the voltage across the membrane will therefore cause a spectral shift resulting from a direct interaction between the field and the ground and excited state dipole moments. New voltage dyes can sense voltage with high speed and sensitivity using photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) through a conjugated molecular wire. Slow-response probes: These exhibit potential-dependent changes in their transmembrane distribution which are accompanied by a fluoresence change. Typical slow-response probes include cationic carbocyanines and rhodamines, and ionic oxonols. Examples Commonly used voltage sensitive dyes are substituted aminonaphthylethenylpyridinium (ANEP) dyes, such as di-4-ANEPPS, di-8-ANEPPS, and RH237. Depending on their chemical modifications which change their physical properties they are used for different experimental procedures. They were first described in 1985 by the research group of Leslie Loew. ANNINE-6plus is the latest voltage sensitive dye with fast response (ns response time) and high voltage sensitivity. It has been applied to measure the action potentials of a single t-tubule of cardiomyocytes by Guixue Bu et al. A recent computational study confirmed that the ANEP dyes are affected only by the electrostatic environment and not by specific molecular interactions. Materials The core material for imaging brain activity with voltage-sensitive dyes are the dyes themselves. These voltage-sensitive dyes are lipophilic and preferably localized in membranes with their hydrophobic tails. They are used in applications involving fluorescence or absorption; they are fast acting and are able to provide linear measurements of changes in membrane potential. A variety of specialized equipment may be used in conjunction with the dyes, and choices in equipment will vary according to the particularities of a preparation. Essentially, equipment will include specialized microscopes and imaging devices, and may include technical lamps or lasers. Strengths and weaknesses Strengths of imaging brain activity with voltage-sensitive dyes include the following abilities: * Measurement of population signals from many areas may be taken simultaneously, and hundreds of neurons may be recorded from. Such multisite recordings may provide precise information on action potential initiation and propagation (including direction and velocity), and on the entire branching structure of a neuron. * Measurements of spike activity in a ganglion that is producing behaviour can be taken and may provide information about how the behaviour is producing. * In certain preparations the pharmacological effects of the dyes may be completely reversed by removing the staining pipette and allowing the neuron 1‚Äì2 hours for recovery. * Dyes may be used to analyze signal integration in terminal dendritic branches. Voltage-sensitive dyes offer the only alternative to genetically encoded voltage sensitive proteins (such as Ci-VSP derived proteins) for doing this. Weaknesses of imaging brain activity with voltage-sensitive dyes include the following problems: * Voltage-sensitive dyes may respond very differently from one preparation to another; typically tens of dyes must be tested in order to obtain an optimal signal., imaging parameters, such as excitation wavelength, emission wavelength, exposure time, should also be optimized * Voltage-sensitive dyes often fail to penetrate through connective tissue or move through intracellular spaces to the region of membrane desired for study. Staining is a serious issue in applications of these dyes. Water-soluble dyes, such as ANNINE-6plus, do not suffer this problem. * Noise is a problem in all preparations with voltage-sensitive dyes and in certain preparations the signal may be significantly obscured. Signal to noise ratios can be improved with spatial filtering or temporal filtering algorithms. Many such algorithms exist; one signal processing algorithm can be found in recent work with the ANNINE-6plus dye. * Cells may be permanently affected by treatments. Lasting pharmacological effects are possible, and the photodynamics of the dyes can be damaging. Uses Voltage-sensitive dyes have been used to measure neural activity in several areas of the nervous system in a variety of organisms, including the squid giant axon, whisker barrels of the rat somatosensory cortex, olfactory bulb of the salamander, visual cortex of the cat, optic tectum of the frog, and the visual cortex of the rhesus monkey.

Design Dashing Daisy Ice Queen (65703) in original box Daisy was released in the UK in 1973, with the tag line \\"Mary Quant makes Daisy the best dressed doll in the world\\". Her name was a reference to Mary Quant's logo, a daisy flower. The doll was manufactured in the 1970s in Hong Kong by Model Toys Ltd, in connection with Flair Toys Ltd. Flair Toys Ltd went out of business in 1980, but Daisy continued to be manufactured until 1983. The doll is 23 centimetres (9 inches) tall and there are three different versions of her: \\"Dizzy Daisy\\", who has a stiff body and unbendable legs, with just her arms and legs swinging up and down from the hips and shoulders; a basic bodied version with bendable legs, as well as the swivelling arms and leg joints; and an active version called \\"Dashing Daisy\\", whose body is the most bendable. Her hair colour has ranged from different shades of blond to brunette and red. Other dolls were manufactured from the same moulds: \\"Havoc, Super Agent\\" was released in 1976; and Daisy's best friend, \\"Amy\\", who was only available by redeeming daisy tokens from Daisy packages. Clothes Daisy's clothes were designed by Mary Quant and there are hundreds of different models. The doll and its accessories were sold in ordinary local shops. The clothes were cutting-edge 1970s design, as would be expected of Mary Quant, one of Britains leading fashion designers and inventor of the mini skirt and hot pants. Materials included satin, for long evening gowns and flared pants, stretch jersey nylon/polyester for T-shirts, fake \\"fun fur\\" for jackets and matching hats, and denim for jeans, waistcoats, hats, skirts and even a boiler suit (very fashionable at the time). Cotton was used extensively for all manner of outfits, long gypsy style dresses, again highly fashionable, blouses, tabards, mini dresses, etc. Patterns were also cutting-edge fashion, including flowers, stripes and polka dots. Footwear included platform clogs and sandals in every colour, and Go-Go Boots with the Quant daisy on the side. House  Daisy had her own house, a fold-up country cottage with one room divided by a split level floor for the bedroom area, and a sloped roof, printed inside with windows and wallpaper and outside with stone walls, windows and greenery. Furniture included round 1970s-style kitchen table and chairs, white with pedestal bases which were based on the Eero Saarinen \\"Tulip\\" chairs and table, it had a complete set of crockery and cutlery, plus a bowl of flowers, napkins and two paper table cloths. Daisy also had a kitchen sink with orange doors a 'tiled' white back splash and hot water boiler, a stove, again white with orange bottom drawer and set of pans. In the bedroom there is a 'Victorian' range of furniture: a bed made of brass look plastic with two sheets, a pillow and eiderdown in white nylon with pink roses all over, a dressing table with swivel mirror and working (battery) oil lamp, and a wardrobe. These items were originally in brown plastic to represent wood, and then went on to be manufactured in a rich green, the doors of the wardrobe papered in a tiny flower print. The range also included a light pink chaise longue, a chevral dressing mirror and bentwood-style coat and hat stand, a Chesterfield-style arm chair with pedestal side table and an oil lamp. Daisy also had her own bike with a saddle bag, and a \\"Daisy mobile\\", rather like the \\"Mystery Machine\\" in Scooby-Doo. Later on she had a scooter which ran on battery power. Pets Daisy's pets were a dog called Spot, a Dalmatian, a black Labrador retriever and a horse called Archie, which can be found in three colours: white with black spots, brown and a palomino.  Booklets  Every year a new fashion booklet was issued, showing any new Daisy dolls, and all her latest fashions for that year. Each booklet had a theme; the first, in 1973, being called My Fashion Diary, telling all about Daisy's year and the various outfits she wears each month for various occasions. The 1974 booklet is called My Round the World Holiday, in which Daisy travels the world, showing off more wonderful outfits designed by Mary Quant. Later issues included: My Exciting Life as a Reporter (1975); I'm Having Fun as a Travel Courier (1976); All about my Gift shop (1976); and My Glamorous Life as a Ballerina (1977). Each fashion book took the reader on a journey in Daisy's busy life. Children could emulate her travels etc. with their own Daisy doll and outfits. Later fashions (after these booklets) were named \\"The Optimum\\" and \\"Flair\\" ranges. Imitations Daisy was imitated by other manufacturers, using similar head moulds to make clone fashion dolls. These dolls may be unmarked, or be marked simply \\"Hong Kong\\". Associated items Sets of Daisy paper dolls were produced in the 1970s including: * Daisy's Fashion Wardrobe 1: Daisy becomes a model * Daisy's Fashion Wardrobe 3: Daisy at the Fair * Daisy's Fashion Wardrobe 4: Daisy's Dress Show A book, Mary Quant's Daisy Chain of Things to Make and Do () was published by Collins in 1975.

Described as perhaps their most Steely Dan-like album, the first single released was St. Saviour Square, originally recorded by Walter Becker and subsequently by Mike Thorne, whose version ended up on the album, despite the band considering the Walter Becker's version better. The song lyrics refer to a demolished housing estate (now site of the Liverpool Women's Hospital) located in the square of the same name (now called Crown Street) west of Upper Parliament Street in the Toxteth area of Liverpool.

Prior to the 1870s, Yankton was served by steamboats along the Missouri River. As service declined, railroads took over to serve the communities in South Dakota. In the late 1870s, the Dakota Southern Railroad entered Yankton. Shortly afterward, the Dakota Southern was bought by The Milwaukee Road. The Milwaukee Road then expanded westward toward Rapid City, South Dakota and the Black Hills. In 1905, The Milwaukee Road built its depot in Yankton. Using a common design, the depot is rectangular in shape and single story. It is built of brick with wood and stone trim. There is a covered area at one end of the depot that leads to the waiting room. A baggage room is located at the other end and the station agent's office is located between the two. As railroad passenger service declined after the 1940s, the depot was sold. The Milwaukee Road itself went bankrupt in the 1980s, and the tracks adjacent to the depot were sold to BNSF Railway predecessor Burlington Northern. At the time of nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, the depot was used as offices for a local cable television company. In 2008, the depot houses the offices of an architectural firm. The depot was listed in the National Register because of its architecture and also because of it association with the commercial development of Yankton and the development of railroads in South Dakota.

Raids, ambushes and ongoing military activities by the Brigade Battalions and flying columns made South Tipperary ungovernable for the British in 1920 and 1921, with the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) confined to what barracks remained occupied and the British Army only venturing out in large convoys. Background The period between the Easter Rising of 1916 and the start of the Irish War of Independence in January 1919, was one of growing tensions between the nationalist element of the Irish population and those in authority, particularly the RIC and British authorities. These tensions were set against the backdrop of increased membership of nationalist volunteer organizations across the country and meetings and open drilling of volunteer companies coupled with the jailing of a large number of political prisoners, raids on houses of political activists by the RIC and incidents such as the death of hunger striker Thomas Ashe.The IRB: The Irish Republican Brotherhood from The Land League to Sinn F√©in, Owen McGee, Four Courts Press, 2005, 1918 saw the political stakes raised with the Military Service Bill coming into effect making conscription in Ireland legal and the proclamation issued banning nationalist organizations such as Sinn F√©in, the Irish Volunteers, the Gaelic League and .The response to these measures was a significant upswing in anti British sentiment, emphasized by the overwhelming victory by Sinn F√©in in the 1918 General Election and the anti-conscription rallies.Wikipedia page - 1918 in Ireland While some in the nationalist movement were satisfied with political victories there was an element that argued that the only way Ireland would ever obtain freedom was through a military confrontation with the British and particularly those who served British interests in Ireland. Se√°n Treacy, circa 1919 By 1917 in South Tipperary, the volunteers were being formed into companies with regular drilling and instructions on the use of firearms. Raids for arms were undertaken during 1917 and 1918 as the Volunteer companies were arming themselves in the anticipation of future conflict.Aengus O Snodaigh (21 January 1999). \\"Gearing up for war: Soloheadbeg 1919\\". An Phoblacht. Se√°n Treacy was the driving force behind a lot of this activity and he regularly visited the local companies often accompanied by Dan Breen. The visit of de Valera to Tipperary Town in August 1917 generated great interest and enthusiasm. Treacy was √âamon de Valera's body guard when he came to Tipperary in 1917 to speak at political rallies. Treacy was arrested a short time later and sentenced to 6 months jail.Ryan, Desmond (1945). Se√°n Treacy and the Third Tipperary Brigade I.R.A. Kerryman Limited. The jails were full of activists who were arrested for drilling, singing banned nationalistic songs, parading in uniform etc. and they became a school for revolutionaries with men from all over Ireland discussing the plight of their country and what needed to be done to progress their cause. In the 1918 General Election, Sinn F√©in candidates were overwhelmingly returned in County Tipperary. The relationship between the RIC and the Volunteers was increasingly hostile with clashes at political rallies or while the Volunteers were drilling. S√©umas Robinson, a veteran of the 1916 Easter Rising, arrived in Tipperary in 1917 at the request of Eamon U√≠ Dubhir who he had met while they were both imprisoned.Bureau of Military History - Witness Statement 1348 Michael Davern Eamon U√≠ Dubhir and Maurice Crowe along with Treacy, Breen and Robinson were prominent in leading the activity of the Volunteers in South Tipperary in 1917 and 1918. Establishment Plaque in Church Street Tipperary commemorating the contribution of the Moloney family to the struggle for independence The Third Tipperary Brigade, also known as the South Tipperary Brigade, was established in 1918. In October 1918 a Brigade meeting was held to elect officers, at P.J. Moloney's house in Church Street, Tipperary Town. Moloney was later in the year elected as a Sinn F√©in MP. The house was burnt down during the war by British forces. Moloney's three sons were all members of the brigade. Richard Mulcahy from GHQ presided over the meeting.Irish Burea of Military History- witness statement 1658, Tadhg Crowe S√©umas Robinson was elected O/C (in absentia as he was imprisoned at the time and didn't rejoin the Brigade until late December), Se√°n Treacy vice O/C, Dan Breen Quarter Master and Maurice Crowe Adjuntant. The Brigade originally had 6 Battalions with this later being extended to 8. These were Rosegreen, Cashel, Dundrum, Tipperary, Clonmel, Cahir, Drangan and Carrick-on-Suir.Bureau of Military History Witness Statement 1433, Michael Fitzpatrick After Se√°n Treacy was released from Dundalk prison in mid 1918, Treacy and Breen along with Se√°n Hogan set up their headquarters in the 'Tin Hut' in Greenane. Here they tested explosives and planned activities. The 'Tin Hut' was a frequent haunt for many who would later play an important part in the Brigade's activities in the war, including Maurice Crowe, Dinny Lacey, Tadhg Crowe and Patrick O'Dwyer.Irish Bureau of Military History - Witness Statement 1432, Patrick O'Dwyer Soloheadbeg The ambush led by Treacy, Robinson, Breen and Hogan at Soloheadbeg is generally acknowledged as the opening engagement of the war. Two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary were killed in the attack - Constable Patrick O'Connell and Constable James McDonnell. Breen following imposition of martial law The planning for Soloheadbeg took place in the 'Tin Hut' on a dairy farm in Greenane. Treacy, Breen and Hogan had been undertaking experiments with explosives there and considering ways to attack the RIC. Treacy was keen to commence hostilities and believed a military confrontation with the RIC and the British authorities was the only way to establish the Republic that Ireland had proclaimed in 1916 and voted for in 1918. In December 1918, they received information that there were plans to move a consignment of gelignite from the Tipperary Town military barracks to the Soloheadbeg quarry. They commenced plans to intercept the consignment and Dan Breen's brother Lars, who worked at the quarry, received information that the consignment was to be moved around 16 January 1919. They anticipated that there would be between 2-6 armed escorts and they discussed different contingencies, such as where they would guard the RIC if they surrendered and that they would fire on the escort if they didn't immediately surrender.Irish Bureau of Military History, Witness Statement 1432 Patrick O'Dwyer Robinson, who had returned to the Brigade area after his release from jail, was briefed by Treacy about the plans to seize the gelignite. Robinson supported the plan and confirmed with Treacy that they would not request permission from GHQ, if they did they would be obliged to wait for a response and even if the response was affirmative it may come back after the gelignite was moved.Irish Bureau of Military History, Witness Statement 1721, S√©umas Robinson 'Those involved on the day of the operation were four officers of the 3rd Tipperary Brigade IRA; Se√°n Treacy, Dan Breen, Se√°n Hogan (then only 17) and S√©umas Robinson. They were joined by five other Volunteers: Tadhg Crowe, Patrick McCormack, Paddy O'Dwyer, Michael Ryan (Donohill) and Se√°n O'Meara (Tipperary) - the latter two being cycle scouts.Aengus O Snodaigh (21 January 1999)'. \\"Gearing up for war: Soloheadbeg 1919 On each day from January 16 to January 21, the men selected for the ambush took up their positions from early in the morning to late afternoon and then retired and spent the night at the 'Tin Hut'. On 21 January around noon, Patrick O'Dwyer noticed the convoy leaving the barracks. The consignment was on a horse-drawn cart, led by two council men with two armed RIC constables guarding the consignment. O'Dwyer cycled quickly to where the ambush party was waiting and informed them of the details of the convoy.Aengus O Snodaigh (21 January 1999)'. \\"Gearing up for war: Soloheadbeg 1919 Robinson and O'Dwyer hid about 30 metres in front of the main ambush party of six, in case they rushed through the main ambush position. After the convoy reached the position where the main ambush party was hiding, they were called onto surrender as masked men appeared in front of them with their guns drawn. The two constables took up firing positions and the volunteers immediately fired upon them. Both RIC constables, Patrick O'Connell and James McDonnell, were killed.Irish Bureau of Military History, Witness Statement 1432 Patrick O'Dwyer As planned, Hogan, Breen and Treacy took the horse and cart with the explosives and sped off. They hid the explosives in a field in Greenane and threw a few sticks out on the roadside a few miles further on as a decoy. The explosives were moved several times and later divided up between the battalions of the brigade.Irish Bureau of Military History, Witness Statement 1450, John Ryan Tadhg Crowe and Patrick O'Dwyer took the guns and ammunition from the dead constables, while Robinson, McCormack and Ryan guarded the two council workers before releasing them once the gelignite was far enough away.Irish Bureau of Military History, Witness Statement 1432 Patrick O'Dwyer Breen has left apparently conflicting accounts of their intentions that day. One implies that the purpose of the confrontation was merely to capture explosives and detonators being escorted to a nearby quarry. The other, that the group intended killing the police escort to provoke a military response. > \\"Treacy had stated to me that the only way of starting a war was to kill > someone, and we wanted to start a war, so we intended to kill some of the > police whom we looked upon as the foremost and most important branch of the > enemy forces ... The only regret that we had following the ambush was that > there were only two policemen in it, instead of the six we had > expected.\\"History Ireland, May 2007, p.56. On the run As a result of the Soloheadbeg ambush, martial law was declared in County Tipperary. Treacy, Breen and Hogan met up again with Robinson a few weeks later and the \\"big four\\" as they were locally called, remained in hiding over the coming months, moving from house to house of sympathisers or sleeping in the rough in the countryside. Treacy and Robinson traveled to Dublin and met with Michael Collins who offered to arrange for them and Breen and Hogan to escape to America. They rejected the offer and told Collins they would remain in Ireland and continue the fight. Hogan was arrested by the RIC in May 1919, his capture would lead to one of the dramatic events of the war. Treacy, Breen and Robinson supported by men from the East Limerick Brigade rescued a handcuffed Hogan from a train under the guard of four RIC officers at Knocklong station in Limerick. Hogan would have almost certainly been executed if he wasn't rescued. Two of the RIC policemen were killed in the fight and Breen and Treacy seriously injured. Treacy, Hogan, Robinson and Breen relocated to Dublin and undertook a range of missions under the direction of the Dublin leadership, some of these missions were in association with a unit known as The Squad. Robinson initially and Hogan later returned to Tipperary to continue the fight against the British and the RIC in Tipperary and surrounding counties. Treacy was eventually killed in an exchange of fire with a British secret service agent in Talbot Street, while Breen alternated between Tipperary and Dublin as the conflict continued. Raids on RIC barracks Aside from the RIC hunt for 'the big four' the remainder of 1919 was reasonably quiet in South Tipperary. This changed in early to mid 1920 as the battalions of the 3rd Tipperary Brigade mounted a series of raids on RIC barracks, including attacks on the barracks at Hollyford, Drangan, Cappawhite, Rear Cross and Clerihan.A short History of the Third Tipperary Brigade - John R Shelley - Phoenix Publishing 1996 Dinny Lacey, commander of the No. 1 Flying Column Robinson continued to command the brigade through the rest of the war of independence. In September 1920 he appointed Dinny Lacey as O/C of the brigade's first flying column and later that year a second flying column was established with Se√°n Hogan as O/C.Irish Bureau of Military History Witness Statement 1433, Michael Fitzpatrick Civil War Dan Breen's appeal to free state troops Reservations about the Treaty caused division within the Brigade. Some members sided with the Provisional Government, (later the Irish Free State), while others remained neutral during the ensuing Civil War. The majority, including Brigade Officers S√©umas Robinson, Dan Breen, Se√°n Hogan and Dinny Lacey, took the Republican side. Lacey was killed in action against Free State troops in 1923 in the Glen of Aherlow while Robinson was a General throughout the civil war, Breen and Hogan were both interned by the Free State Army during the Civil War. Third Tipperary Brigade Commemorations A memorial at St. Michael's Cemetery, Tipperary Town lists the names of those brigade members that were killed in the War of Independence and the Civil War. There are numerous memorials, plaques and statues in Tipperary and surrounding areas that commemorate members of the brigade or actions of the brigade including those at: Soloheadbeg, Knocklong, Talbot Street, Annacarthy, Drangan and Ballingarry. The Sean Treacy Memorial swimming pool in Tipperary Town, contains information about and a number of artifacts from the brigade. A number of songs recall events and members of the brigade including: *The Galtee Mountain Boy, three of the four historical figures in the popular Irish republican song The Galtee Mountain Boy were members of the Third Tipperary Brigade, Flying Column leaders Dinny Lacey & Se√°n Hogan as well as the Brigade's Quartermaster Dan Breen. *Tipperary so far away (Ballad of Sean Treacy).

Dublin was founded in the early 19th century by George McCausland and a friend who migrated from Dublin, Ireland.  History  The first record of the village of Dublin is found in the Act of Assembly Districts of the 18th century, which divided the county into election districts and designated Dublin the vote place for the Fifth district. Martenet's map of 1878 shows McCausland built a home on one side of what is now Route 440 and a tavern or inn on the other side. The tavern on the southeast side was a long two-story building that was very close to the road. The building had a porch on the first and second stories. In old records, reference is made of the Mt. Ararat Lodge of Masons, Maryland, which moved its meeting place in 1809 from a tavern in Delta, Pennsylvania to George McCausland's tavern in Dublin. The lodge remained there until 1826, then moved to the old Masonic Lodge on Bond Street in Bel Air. Roadside scene in Dublin On the northeast corner of Routes 440 and 136 was a small log house, with a short circular stairway and a fireplace, which was used as a school and referred to as \\"the academy\\". Along with several of the older homes, it burned in 1971. In 1858, the town had ten houses and places of business. Among the owners were McComas, Gallion, James, Rausey, J. Dougherty, and Jones. Dublin had a post office in 1878, one of the first in Harford County. At that time, the town boasted two stores, a blacksmith shop, a wheelwright shop, a church, a school, and two taverns. Dublin school was a part of the public school system in 1867 with a one-room building on present-day Route 136 across from the present school. In 1800, Charles Beavers donated land for a Methodist house of worship (on present-day Route 136). A log structure was first erected and later a clapboard one-room was built which served the congregation until 1939. The Methodist bishop sent a deacon to start a church in Dublin. The deacon was visiting Bush Chapel, on the Bush River, and traveled through Dublin to the Greenstone area, now on Baltimore Boy Scout land off Peach Orchard Road. That area was well populated with strong Methodists and also by being on the river and several mining ore mills. The area was very thickly settled. Several stones can be seen which are believed to be part of the foundation the deacon started. He never returned and, in later years, a church was started in Dublin. Dublin has long been known for the incident of \\"The Headless Peddler\\". This occurred in 1763 on John Bryarly's farm on a stream called Rock Run. After this event, the stream name was changed to Peddler's Run. The end of the story was only closed in 1843, on James Warner's farm. The road, now Route 440 through Dublin, was known as Dublin-Stafford Road. This was the main road to Bel Air and the Susquehanna River where the commercial life was. The travel pattern of the county was from Bush River up to Churchville, into Dublin and to the Susquehanna River; there was no Route 1 until later years. Dublin has two very old cemeteries, a north and a south. The South Cemetery is on Deerfield Road. At one time a small church was erected there for the slaves and Southern sympathizers. You can still make out the foundation lines of the church. The oldest tombstone is dated 1820, though possibly there are older unmarked slaves' graves. The other cemetery is with the Dublin United Methodist Church on Route 136. On the Martenets' map of 1858, the village was not spread out but in a small area. The Indians had mostly vacated this area by the 18th century but they had left the land very poor and barren for crops. The area was known as Arabin Petra, a tract of approximately (or hundredth as was used in those days). This land was originally acquired by Dr. Charles Carroll. Usually, when a settlement was made of a town, the first three things established were a church, a school, and a jail. There is no record of a jail for Dublin. But the local story goes that if you did not live in Dublin, you better have your business in town settled by dark or else the locals would \\"send you packin'\\".  Land area  Dublin was part of a tract of land patented to Dr. Charles Carroll of Annapolis, Maryland. He was issued a patented certificate on June 15, 1721. The tract lying north of Deer Creek was known as \\"Arabia Petrea\\". Dr. Carroll sold \\"Arabia Petrea\\" to Jacob Giles and Isaac Webster in 1733. Isaac and Jacob were brothers-in-law. Isaac and Jacob in turn sold off part to new settlers moving into the area. Two of the newcomers in Dublin were William Beaver and Walter Ashmore. Isaac and Giles sold lands east of Route 136 to Walter Ashmore and land west of Route 136 to William Beaver. William Beaver willed his land to his son Charles Beaver. In 1796, Charles petitioned the court to have appointed commissioners \\"mark and bound\\" his land. The first stone was set November 8, 1796 with a \\"B\\" carved in the face. After more than 200 years, the stone still stands in that spot which is located in the northwest corner of The Evangelical Methodist Church of Dublin. Charles Beaver, now aging, started to sell off parts of his farm. In 1794, he leased/purchased a lot on the northeast corner of Route 136 and Route 440 (1603 Whiteford Road) to George McCausland. In 1798, he sold to John Evatt on the southwest side of Route 136 and Route 440 (1536 Whiteford Road). On October 20, 1800, Charles sold about to five trustees for a church to be erected (1528 Whiteford Road). In 1802, he sold lot #1 to George McCausland; George erected a tavern on it. This also served as the Fifth district voting place (Walt Moody's lot). In 1802, Charles sold to John Evatt (Roger Waddell's lot and Ira Lee's field). The first school set up in Dublin was in 1812 on a lot from William Nevill to trustees William Silver, John Galbreath, George McCausland, and Thomas Barnes. This lot bordered Beaver's land and \\"was to have rights to the cool spring.\\" The first public school in Dublin, by act of the 1850 General Assembly of Maryland, was started in 1855. The quarter acre lot was purchased from Jonathan Lemmon and was next to the church lot. This served as Dublin's public school until 1915 when a new school was built across the road. Dublin, in 1858, was said to have had ten houses and places of business. By 1878, Dublin boasted two stores, a blacksmith shop, a wheelwright shop, a hoop maker, a tailor shop, one school and two churches, Dublin Methodist Episcopal Church and for the southerners Southern Methodist Episcopal Church. Some of the residents in 1878 were: T.J. McCausland, R. Hooper, James Chenowith, R. Gallion, A.L. McCann, J.E. Jones, E. Willis, John McDoon, John Daughtery, William Neville, Jonathan Lemmon, Jane Davis, A.B. Lindsey, James Ramsey, John Crawford, and John Deckman.Harford County land and will records and \\"Our Harford Heritage\\" by C.M. Wright.  Dublin Methodist Church  In 1772, Bishop Frances Asbury had been in the area preaching and ministering the various areas. He returned to England and sent a deacon to establish a church in the area. A foundation was laid at the populated Greenstone, now on the Baltimore Boy Scout Camp off of Robinson Mill Road. The large stones can still be seen. For some reason, the church was never completed. In 1800, Charles Beaver in Dublin conveyed 126 square perches of land (0.9 acres) to five Trustees in trust, \\"that they erect or build or have erected or built a house of worship for the use of the member's of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\\" Probably in 1860 a clapboard construction, one room building was erected and served the community for eighty years. In 1939, while demolishing the old clapboard church to make way for the new Port Deposit granite stone church, a date of 1860 was found carved in one of the roof rafters of the old church. The new church, which is constructed of local material, stone from Port Deposit, and slate from Slateville, also has ten beautiful stained glass windows donated by members of the church. Thanks to many donated hours of labor, the total cost of the church was only $14,053. In 1963, a two story education wing was added to the existing building, and over the past several years several remodeling projects have been completed in various areas of the church. In 1870, David and Driscilla Riley sold to the church and 120 square perches of land and dwelling for $13,000 to be used as the parsonage for the Harford circuit. The building was a two-story log construction, which was located just west of the present Dublin Market on Route 440 (Kilgore-Botts property) until 1977 when it burnt down. In 1872, Reverend Clarkson who was assigned to the eight church circuit (including Dublin, Darlington, Franklin, Watters Meeting [Thomas Run], Mt. Zion, Bel Air, Mt. Vernon, and Emory) refers to the condition and appearance of the parsonage in his journal. In 1888, the first parsonage and 120 square perches of land was sold to Catherine Daugherty and a second parsonage was built on the remaining part of the lot. This served as the parsonage until 1968 when a new brick structure was built on Route 136 next to the church. The second parsonage was then sold. Many can remember an old building that sat where the present day parsonage on Route 136 is; it was the original Dublin School. The three room structure was used for grades 1 thru 11 until 1915 when a new wooden schoolhouse was constructed across the road. R.L. McCann willed the old schoolhouse and land to the church. It was utilized as a Boy Scout meeting house until it was demolished to make way for the present day parsonage. Today, the congregation has many 4-generation worshippers attending services. In the spring of 2000, the Dublin United Methodist Church, being one of the oldest Methodist churches in the New World, celebrated 200 years of worshipping.C.

According to provisions outlined in the treaty, Lithuania would acquire about one fifth of the Vilnius Region, including Lithuania's historical capital, Vilnius, and in exchange would allow five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops to be established across Lithuania. In essence the treaty with Lithuania was very similar to the treaties that the Soviet Union signed with Estonia on September 28, and with Latvia on October 5. According to official Soviet sources, the Soviet military was strengthening the defenses of a weak nation against possible attacks by Nazi Germany. The treaty provided that Lithuania's sovereignty would not be affected. However, in reality the treaty opened the door for the first Soviet occupation of Lithuania and was described by The New York Times as \\"virtual sacrifice of independence.\\" Background =Pre-war treaties= Map attached to the German‚ÄìSoviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty dividing Eastern Europe into Soviet and German spheres of influence Lithuania declared independence from the Russian Empire on February 16, 1918. On June 12, 1920, following the brief Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War, a Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty was signed. The Soviet Union recognized Lithuania's independence and its right to the Vilnius Region. The region was fiercely contested with Poland and fell under its control after ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920. It was then incorporated into the Republic of Central Lithuania which was a short- lived political entity without international recognition. The region was ceded to Poland in 1922 at the Peace of Riga after the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War and confirmed internationally by the League of Nations. The Lithuanians refused to recognize Polish control and continued to claim legal and moral rights to the region throughout the interwar period. The Soviet Union continued to support Lithuanian claims against sovereign Poland. The Soviets supported as well Lithuania's interests in the Klaipƒóda Region after the Klaipƒóda Revolt and signed the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Non-Aggression Pact in 1926, later extended it to 1944. On August 23, 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. According to pact's secret protocols, Lithuania was assigned to the German sphere of influence while Latvia and Estonia, the other two Baltic states, were assigned to the Soviets. This different treatment could be explained by Lithuania's economic dependence on Germany. Germany accounted for approximately 80% of Lithuania's foreign trade and after the 1939 German ultimatum had control of Klaipƒóda, Lithuania's only port. Also, Lithuania and Russia did not have a common border. =World War II= On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Wehrmacht pushed Polish forces behind the line agreed with the Soviets. Germans took control of the Lublin Voivodeship and eastern Warsaw Voivodeship. When on September 17 Red Army invaded Poland, Soviet troops took over Vilnius Region, which according to the 1920 and 1926 Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian treaties was recognized to Lithuania. As a result, Soviets and Germans re-negotiated the secret protocols of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. On September 28, 1939, they signed the Boundary and Friendship Treaty. Its secret attachment detailed that to compensate the Soviet Union for German- occupied Polish territories, Germany would transfer Lithuania, except for a small territory in Suvalkija, to the Soviet sphere of influence. The exchange of territories was also motivated by Soviet control of Vilnius: the Soviet Union could exert significant influence on the Lithuanian government, which claimed Vilnius to be its de jure capital. In the secret protocols, both Soviet Union and Germany explicitly recognized Lithuanian interest in Vilnius. Negotiations =Initial stance= On September 29, the next day after the Boundary and Friendship Treaty, Germany canceled planned talks with Lithuania and the Soviet Union informed Lithuania that it wished to open negotiations regarding future relationship between the two countries. The new Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian negotiations were supposed to formally resolve the status of the Vilnius Region. Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urb≈°ys arrived to Moscow on October 3. During the meeting Joseph Stalin personally informed Urb≈°ys about the Soviet‚ÄìGerman secret protocols and showed maps of the spheres of influence. He demanded that Lithuania signed three separate treaties, according to which: # military bases would be established and up to 50,000 Soviet soldiers would be stationed in Lithuania (the original mutual assistance pact); # Lithuanian territory west of the ≈†e≈°upƒó River would be ceded to the Nazi Germany (as agreed between Germany and Soviet Union in the Boundary and Friendship Treaty); # one portion of the Vilnius Region would be attached to Lithuania. Urb≈°ys' protested the Soviet bases arguing that it would mean virtual occupation of Lithuania. Soviets argued that their army would protect Lithuania from possible attacks from Nazi Germany and that a similar treaty was already signed with Estonia. Urb≈°ys argued that Lithuania's neutrality was enough to guarantee its security and proposed to strengthen Lithuanian army. According to the Lithuanian brigadier general Musteikis, Urb≈°ys told that Lithuanians refuses Vilnius Region as well as the Russian garrisons, however then nervous Stalin replied that \\"No matter if you take Vilnius or not, the Russian garrisons will enter Lithuania anyway\\". Finally, Soviets agreed to reduce the number of troops to 35,000. Urb≈°ys then also bargained for more territories in the Vilnius Region, especially in the vicinity of Druskininkai and ≈†venƒçionys, territories with larger Lithuanian population. The Soviets replied that the boundary draw by the 1920 peace treaty was inaccurate and that Belarusians also laid claims to the territory. Soviets tentatively agreed that territories, where Lithuanian majority could be proven, would be transferred to Lithuania. The most shocking demand was to cede part of Lithuanian territory to Germany. Lithuanians decided to postpone any negotiations regarding territory transfer to Germany until Germans expressed clear demands. =Acceptance= Lithuanian delegation before departing to Moscow on October 7, 1939. Urb≈°ys is third from left. Urb≈°ys returned to Lithuania to consult the government. German officials confirmed that the secret protocols were real, and informed Lithuanians that transfer of the territory in Suvalkija was not an urgent matter. Eventually, Nazi Germany sold this territory to the Soviet Union for 7.5 million dollars on January 10, 1941 in the German‚ÄìSoviet Border and Commercial Agreement. Lithuanians in principle agreed to sign the mutual assistance treaty, but were instructed to resist Soviet bases as much as possible. Alternatives included doubling Lithuanian army, exchanging military missions, and building fortifications on the western border with Germany similar to the Maginot Line in France. On October 7, Lithuanian delegation, including General Stasys Ra≈°tikis and Deputy Prime Minister Kazys Bizauskas, returned to Moscow. Stalin refused the proposed alternatives, but agreed to reduce the number of Soviet troops to 20,000 ‚Äì about the size of the entire Lithuanian army. Soviets wanted to sign the treaty right then to commemorate the 19th anniversary of the ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny and Lithuania's loss of Vilnius. Political rallies, organized in Vilnius demanding city's incorporation into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, put additional pressure on Lithuanians and provided a sense of urgency. Urb≈°ys refused to sign and the talks receded for the second time. In Lithuania, President Antanas Smetona doubted that it was worth gaining Vilnius for such a price and debated whether the negotiations could be broken off. Bizauskas argued that refusing the treaty would not prevent Soviet Union from implementing its plan. The Soviet Union had already threatened Estonia with force in the case it refused their mutual assistance treaty and was gathering forces in Vilnius Region in the east and in Latvia in the north. In such light, the government decided to demand as much territory as possible. However, when the delegation returned to Moscow, it found the atmosphere changed. Soviets were inflexible, refused further negotiations, and intimidated the delegation to sign the treaty. They presented a new draft, which combined the mutual assistance pact and transfer of Vilnius into one agreement. The Lithuanian delegation had little choice but to sign the proposed treaty. After signing the treaty, Stalin invited the Lithuanian delegation to celebrate and watch two movies with him. Urb≈°ys informed the Lithuanian government about signing of the treaty only in the morning of October 11 ‚Äì at the time the treaty was already published by Soviet news agency TASS. Provisions About one-fifth of Vilnius Region (dark orange) was ceded to Lithuania in exchange for four Soviet military bases (marked with stars) according to the Mutual Assistance Treaty =Articles of the treaty= The mutual assistance treaty contained nine articles: *Article I: Transfer of Vilnius Region and the city of Vilnius to Lithuania *Article II: Mutual assistance in case of an attack *Article III: Soviet Union renders assistance to the Lithuanian Army in terms of munitions and equipment *Article IV: Soviet Union receives right to station its troops in Lithuania. Base locations are to be decided by a separate treaty. *Article V: Coordinated actions in case of an attack *Article VI: Agreement not to participate in alliances against the other party *Article VII: Sovereignty is not affected by this treaty *Article VIII: Articles II to VII are valid for a period of 15 years with an automatic extension for another 10 (note that transfer of Vilnius is permanent) *Article IX: Date of effect The treaty also had a secret supplement, which specified that the Soviets could station only up to 20,000 of their troops. =Location of Soviet troops= The treaty did not decide the exact location of the Soviet bases and 18-member Soviet delegation, led by Mikhail Kovalyov, was sent to Lithuania to discuss the specifics on October 22. The Lithuanians sought to limit Soviet bases to Vilnius Region and southern Lithuania, offering Pabradƒó, Nemenƒçinƒó, Naujoji Vilnia, and Alytus. They considered a base in Samogitia (western Lithuania) to be the worst possible outcome. The Lithuanians preferred fewer, but bigger bases with no permanent runways for the aircraft. The Soviets initially proposed to have their bases in Vilnius, Kaunas, Alytus, Ukmergƒó, and ≈†iauliai. The final agreement was signed on October 28, the same day when the Lithuanian army marched into Vilnius. A day before, another agreement determined the new border of eastern Lithuania: Lithuania received of territory with population of approximately 430,000. The territory comprised about one fifth of the Vilnius Region recognized to Lithuania by the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty of 1920; population of Lithuania reached about 3.8 million. According to the final agreement, four military bases would be established in Lithuania with 18,786 military personnel from the 16th Special Rifle Corps, 5th Rifle Division, and 2nd Light Tank Brigade. The bases were to be located in Alytus (infantry, artillery, and mechanized units with 8,000 troops), Prienai (infantry and artillery units with 2,500 soldiers), Gai≈æi≈´nai (mechanized and tank units with 3,500 troops), and in Naujoji Vilnia (headquarters, infantry and artillery units with 4,500 troops). For comparison, on June 1, 1940 Lithuanian army had 22,265 soldiers and 1,728 officers. While aircraft bases in Alytus and Gai≈æi≈´nai were under construction, Soviet aircraft were to be stationed in Kirtimai, a neighborhood of Vilnius. The final location of the bases showed that the Soviets were more concerned with encircling Kaunas, the temporary capital, than with defending the country against a possible foreign attack. Aftermath =International and domestic reaction= The treaty was presented as proof of Soviet respect to small nations and Stalin's benevolence by Soviet propaganda. Russians emphasized that it was the second time the Soviet Union gave Vilnius to Lithuania while the League of Nations failed to mediate Polish‚ÄìLithuanian dispute. Soviets also worked to assure Lithuanians that Soviet friendship is effective protection from and a welcome alternative to Nazi aggression. Polish government-in-exile officially protested the treaty as it did not recognize Russian conquest and claimed sovereignty over territories of the Second Polish Republic. Lithuanians replied that the region was legally part of Lithuania. Poles resented the transfer and as soon as the Soviet Army left Vilnius, anti- Lithuanian riots broke out accusing Lithuanians of betrayal. France and Great Britain, traditional allies of Poland, also condemned the treaty. Belarusian activists, who campaigned for Vilnius incorporation into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, were arrested, deported, or executed by the Soviet authorities. The transfer upset their national aspirations to position Belarus as a successor to the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Lithuanian relations with Vatican were expected to improve as the cause for tension, Vilnius Region assigned to Poland by the Concordat of 1925, now was under Lithuanian control. Lithuanian politicians attempted to show the regained Vilnius as a major diplomatic victory. The Lithuanian Nationalists Union, ruling political party in Lithuania since the 1926 coup, used celebrations of return of the city to increase its prestige and popularity. The government stressed its competence and the opposition emphasized Soviet generosity. While politicians publicly praised the Soviet Union and taunted \\"traditional Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian friendship,\\" in private they understood this treaty was a serious threat to Lithuanian independence. Popular attitude was reflected in a known slogan \\"Vilnius ‚Äì m≈´s≈≥, Lietuva ‚Äì rus≈≥\\" (Vilnius is ours, but Lithuania is Russia's). After the treaty was signed, Lithuania lost its neutrality and could not independently execute its foreign policy. For example, Lithuania could not support Finland when the Winter War broke out after Finland rejected a similar mutual assistance treaty proposed by Soviet Union. In international politics, Lithuania became a Soviet satellite. =In Vilnius Region= Lithuanian troops enter Vilnius. On October 28, the Lithuanian Army entered Vilnius for the first time since 1920. Before handing over the city to the Lithuanians, the Soviets robbed and transported to Soviet Union all valuables: equipment from factories (including Elektrit) and hospitals, vehicles and trains, cultural objects from museums and libraries. After the Russian troops left, Polish residents, seeing the deal as a betrayal of Poland, protested against the Lithuanian government. On October 30 ‚Äì November 1, when bread price suddenly rose, clashes between local communists and Poles turned into a riot against the Jewish population. Many Jewish shops were raided and some 35 people were injured. Jews accused Lithuanian police of inaction and sympathizing with Polish rioters. Soviet soldiers, uninvited by the Lithuanian government, helped to subdue the riots. The territory presented an economic challenge to Lithuania: unemployment was rampant, food was in short supply, valuables were stolen by Soviet army, war refugees were gathering from other former Polish territories. The Lithuanian army would provide up to 25,000 daily rations of hot soup and bread to residents of Vilnius. Lithuanian government exchanged the Polish z≈Çoty to Lithuanian litas at a favourable rate, losing over 20 million litas. The Lithuanian government decided to implement a land reform similar to the land reform executed in the 1920s. Large estates would be nationalized and distributed to landless peasants in exchange for redemption dues payable in 36 years. Politicians hoped that such reform would weaken pro- Polish landowners and would win peasants' loyalty to the Lithuanian state. By March 1940, 90 estates and 23,000 hectares were distributed. Lithuanians proceeded to \\"re-Lithuanize\\" cultural life in Vilnius Region. They closed many Polish cultural and educational institutions, including Stephan Batory University with over 3,000 students. Lithuanians sought to introduce the Lithuanian language in public life and sponsored Lithuanian organizations and cultural activities. =In Lithuania= Future of the Vilnius Region caused frictions between political and military leaders in Lithuania. As first Soviet troops moved into Lithuania on November 14, the government, which included four generals, resigned. A new civilian cabinet, led by controversial Prime Minister Antanas Merkys, was formed on November 21. Lithuanians were careful to follow the treaty to a letter and not to give any excuses for Moscow to accuse them of treaty violations. At first, delayed by the Winter War, the Soviets did not interfere with Lithuania's domestic affairs and Soviet soldiers were well-behaved in their bases. The Lithuanian government started debating its options and what could be done to prepare for the future occupation. Despite various resolutions, nothing material was accomplished. Lithuania had no counterweight to Soviet influence: its own forces were small, Germany was in effect Russia's ally, Poland was conquered, France and Great Britain had bigger issues in western Europe. After the Winter War was over, Soviet Union turned its attention to the Baltic States. After months of intense propaganda and diplomatic pressure, the Soviets issued an ultimatum on June 14, 1940 ‚Äì the same day when world's attention was focused on fall of Paris during the Battle of France. Soviets accused Lithuania of violating the treaty and abducting Russian soldiers from their bases. Soviets demanded that a new government, which would comply with the Mutual Assistance Treaty, would be formed and that an unspecified number of Soviet troops would be admitted to Lithuania. With Soviet troops already in the country, it was impossible to mount military resistance. Soviets took control of government institutions, installed a new pro-Soviet government, and announced elections to the People's Seimas. The proclaimed Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was incorporated into the Soviet Union on August 3, 1940.

He was active in the Anti-Slavery movement and also in famine relief in Russia and aid to Armenians. He was joint secretary and then chair of the Friends War Victims Relief Committee. Family background He was born 29 September 1834 at Melksham, in Wiltshire, of Quaker parents. He was the son of Edmund Brooks (1802‚Äì1893), baker, warehouseman, farmer and Ann Wright (1799?‚Äì1884), daughter of David Wright (1774?‚Äì1857) of Bury St Edmunds, baker, and Ann Wright (1778?‚Äì1827). He had two brothers. About 1850 the family moved to Esher, Surrey, where his father was a farmer. Education He was educated at the Sidcot School. He then entered the engineering works of John Fowler & Co., Leeds, and built up a solid position in the firm so that he was able to take a leading part in the engineering industry. In 1860, he moved to Guildford in Surrey, where he practised as an engineer and in 1870, moved to Grays in Essex. Business interests In the cement business, he was a partner with his sons and sons-in-law in Hilton, Anderson Brooks, & Co earlier Brooks, Shoobridge and Co. with activities at Grays in Essex and Halling, Faversham and Upnor in Kent. At one time, his company employed the largest number of staff of any company in Essex. He was fully occupied with this business until the early 1890s, when he became more involved with Quaker and philanthropic work. Quaker interests He was treasurer the Anti-Slavery Society until his resignation in 1926. He was Secretary of the British Quaker Anti-Slavery Committee and was concerned among other things with the establishment in 1897 of a Mission in Pemba, one of the Zanzibar islands, now in Tanzania, to help freed and escaped slaves there. Slavery was finally legally abolished in Zanzibar in 1909.Britain and Slavery in East Africa By Moses D. E. Nwulia, on GoogleBooks, pp.194 ff.

Brooks returned, reported on 15 January 1892 to the Meeting and left again with Herbert Sefton Jones, who was fluent in Russian, on 15 February with funds for a Quaker relief effort and an urgent need to distribute food before the spring thaw would make transportation difficult. The Friends concentrated their efforts on Samara but also went to Tatarstan and other adjacent regions. Some of the travel was by railway but much was by horse drawn sledge. Brooks returned home on 12 April. In the end, the Russian famine of 1891‚Äì92 killed between 375,000 and 500,000 people.\\"The great Russian famine of 1891‚Äì2 : E.W.

The small- scale craft winery is located in Nierstein on the Rhine and owns around 26 hectares of vineyards. It is member of the Verband Deutscher Pr√§dikats- und Qualit√§tsweing√ºter (short VDP). History In 1912 the Gutehoffnungsh√ºtte (later MAN AG) purchased a lime pit in the south of Nierstein including the neighbouring vineyards. The limestone is needed as raw material for the production in the ironworks of Oberhausen (Ruhr Area). After the First World War the demand for limestone decreased drastically and the management decided to use the purchased area for viticulture. In 1920 the first vintage is vinified. The wines of the estate ‚ÄûGutehoffnungsh√ºtte‚Äú were consumed only within the company or donated, later sold, to key customers. The lime pit was sold in 1955, with the proceeds reinvested in the winery. As part of this transaction top Nierstein vineyard sites were purchased and became assets of the estate and the oenologic equipment was modernized. In the 1980s the corporate structure was changed and the Gutehoffnungsh√ºtte run under the MAN label. Also the Weingut received a new name in 1995 and is called Weingut St. Antony, after the first ironworks, St.-Antony-H√ºtte, in Oberhausen. The responsibility for the winery had been directly located at the corporate management, chief oenologist was Alexander Michalsky. During this time St. Antony gathered a place in the top 100 wineries in Germany. In 2005 Detlev Meyer, a private investor who is a textile merchant, acquired the estate. Since July 2008 another top Nierstein winery ‚ÄûHeyl zu Herrnsheim‚Äú, with another 13 hectares, was long time rented by Meyer and merged with St. Antony. The winemaking of both is located now in the former Gustav Adolf Schmitt winery. Between 2005 and 2018, the Geisenheimer Felix Peters Chief was the chief oenologist for both estates. Since 2019, Dirk W√ºrtz has been managing the wineries as a partner and chief oenologistAxel Biesler: Wortloser Aufbruch, retrieved 25 Oktober 2019 Weingut St. Antony - Dirk W√ºrtz gibt Vollgas, dated 20 April 2019. Geography The estate stretches across the so-called ‚ÄûRoter Hang‚Äú (red slope) with steep slope viticulture and presence of red slate in Nierstein and comprises part of the top vineyard sites ‚ÄûOrbel‚Äú, ‚ÄûPettenthal‚Äú, ‚ÄûHipping‚Äú and ‚Äû√ñlberg‚Äú. The ‚ÄûBrudersberg‚Äú site is in exclusive possession of ‚ÄûHeyl zu Herrnsheim‚Äú. St. Antonys vineyards in the Rheinhessen wine region are within the boundaries of the collective sites (Gro√ülagen) of Spiegelberg, Rehbach and Auflangen, which are not displayed on the label.

His actions caused significant damage to the Allied cause and he has been described as \\"the worst traitor of the war\\". Cole was killed while resisting arrest by French police in Paris in January 1946. Biography Cole was born in an East London slum. By the time he was a teenager he was a petty criminal committing burglary, embezzlement and cheque fraud. He had served several sentences in British gaols before the start of the Second World War. In September 1939, after recently being released early from prison, he lied about his criminal past to enlist in the British Army (serial no. 1877989RE). He was assigned to the 18th Field Park Company, part of the Royal Engineers, a unit in the 4th Infantry Division. It was sent to France in late 1939 as a part of the British Expeditionary Force and was stationed in Loison-sous-Lens, where Cole was promoted to sergeant. In May 1940, he was arrested for stealing money from his own Sergeants' Mess and placed in a guardhouse. Cole became a prisoner of war after being left behind when his unit pulled out during the Fall of France. Cole soon escaped, using a stolen black Peugeot 202. He moved to Lille, where he dabbled in the black market. It was here he reinvented himself as an English gentleman and former Scotland Yard detective who was now a captain in British Intelligence in occupied France. He moved to Marseilles where he helped the French Resistance establish escape route networks with safe houses, couriers and document forgers. During this period, he referred to himself as \\"Captain Paul Cole\\", but he also used a variety of aliases, including Mason, Rooke, Corser, de Loebelle, Anderson, Deram and Godfrey. Cole fashioned himself as a suave upper-class Englishman dressed in plus fours, with plastered-down hair, and a finely-clipped moustache. His espionage work was also given the wholehearted support of Special Operations Executive (SOE) in London. However, in 1941 Cole was confronted by Albert Gu√©risse, a Belgian Resistance leader who ran the \\"Pat O'Leary Line\\" that helped Allied servicemen reach neutral Spain and English-controlled Gibraltar, about embezzling money, even though the SOE still vouched for his integrity. Gu√©risse had agents watch Cole to gather evidence that he had been stealing money intended to finance the escape lines to fund a high-society lifestyle of nightclubs and expensive restaurants. Cole was arrested and locked in a room, while the Resistance group decided his fate. While they deliberated and concluded that he should be executed, Cole forced open a window and escaped. Now on the run from the Resistance, Cole handed himself in to Geheime Feldpolizei, an executive branch of German military intelligence. After giving the Nazi security agency 30 pages of names and addresses of Resistance members, he became an agent for the Sicherheitsdienst, collaborating with the RSHA to find and capture French Resistance members and destroy the escape lines he had helped run in occupied France.Wake, Nancy. The White Mouse. Pan Macmillan Press, Australia. 1994. (page 50). () While working out of 84 Avenue Foch in Paris, he denounced many important figures in the Resistance movement, including Ian Garrow and Gu√©risse. Cole was often present when they were detained. On some occasions, the Nazi security forces would arrest him too so his treachery remained undiscovered. It is believed that Cole betrayed at least 150 members of the French Resistance, of whom 50 were executed by the Gestapo.Major-Gen Albert- Marie Edmond Gu√©risse: Pat O'Leary of the PAO Allied escape line ‚Äì the 'Pat' or 'O'Leary' Line Although employed by the Germans, Cole quickly reverted to his old ways. He married a French girl, but abandoned her when their baby died. Cole also had several mistresses. He stole one girlfriend's life savings after convincing her he would pay her back with money he had back in Britain. Prison escape and death In 1944, Cole fled Paris before the Allies liberated the city. With the war over, in June 1945 he reinvented himself at Bad Saulgau in South Germany by claiming to be a Captain Mason, who was on a secret mission to root out high-ranking Nazis and Werwolf members who had fled to the Alpine Fortress in Bavaria. But Cole was caught after his own self- confidence got the better of him. He sent a postcard to an ex-girlfriend in Paris telling her of his new life. She contacted the authorities, and he was arrested by MI9. However, despite being imprisoned at the SHAEF military prison in Paris, he escaped from custody by dressing as an American serviceman on 18 November 1945 and walking straight out through the main gate. On 8 January 1946, after receiving a tip-off, French police found out he was hiding on the fourth floor above a bar on the Rue de Grenelle in Paris. Cole was shot and killed while trying to escape. He was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave in Paris.Murphy, Brendan. TURNCOAT, The Strange Case of Traitor Sergeant Harold Cole..

In his left hand he holds an acorn and in his right a thorn, both items drawn from the tradition of fairy iconography. His massive neck is similar to that of a bull, and holds a disproportionally small head, marked by glaring eyes and open jaws, and a venomous slithering tongue.Robertson, 77 According to the art critic Jonathan Jones, the flea is depicted as an \\"evil, gothic, grotesque stalking through a starry realm between stage curtains.\\" Ghost of a Flea is distinguished by its innovative use of gold leaf. Beneath the curtain folds, the flesh of the flea and bright stars, Blake placed a thin foil of \\"white\\" gold which he made from gold-silver alloy. He then used a brush and powdered gold foil made into paint to colour much of the minute detail. Blake overlaid using thick brown paint derived from sugar, gum and glue.\\"The Ghost of a Flea circa 1819‚Äì20.\\" Tate, 2004. Retrieved on November 02, 2008. Henry Fuseli, The Nightmare.

Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved on November 02, 2008. On the reverse of the panel is written, \\"The Vision of the Spirit that inhabits the body of a Flea, and which appeared to the late Mr. Blake, the Designer of the vignettes for Blair Grave and the Book of Job. The Visions first appeared to him in my presence, and after wards till he had finished this picture. The Flea drew blood on this.\\" Today the work is in relatively poor condition, partly due to the technique employed by Blake. Areas of the surface have cracked and dulled with age.\\"One of Blake's 'Spiritual Visitants'. Tate. Retrieved on November 08, 2008. Although Blake was singular in his ability to directly transcribe visions onto canvas or paper, a number of visual and literary sources can be detected in this work. The art historian Hope Werness suggested that The Flea may be inspired by a 1665 work by early microscopist Robert Hooke (1635‚Äì1703), whose Micrographia includes a drawing of a flea microscopically observed.Werness, 180 Comparisons have been made to Henry Fuseli's monstrous imps, while the image of the flea echos figures in Blake's earlier work, and his scaly body is similar to the monster in his 1805 pen and ink drawing Pestilence: Death of the First Born. In 2006, the Tate hung The Ghost of a Flea and William Raddon's 1827 engraving after Fuseli's The Nightmare side by side in \\"The Nightmare in Modern Culture\\" room of their \\"Fuseli, Blake and the Romantic Imagination\\" exhibition.\\"The Nightmare in Modern Culture. Tate, 2006. Retrieved on August 9, 2009. Reception During his lifetime, Blake's prints were described as the work of a madman. This view was reinforced when word spread that Blake was inspired through visions, and, according to G. E. Bentley, \\"So plain was Blake's madness to some that they assumed he must have been confined in a madhouse\\" and few were willing to believe that the artist actually saw anything.Bentley 2003, 379 In 2006, the painting was described by The New York Times as Blake's \\"quite strangest and certainly most Gothic work\\".Riding, Alan. \\"Spirits, Gothic Fantasies and Sex, Please, We're British \\". The New York Times, February 27, 2006. Retrieved on November 08, 2008. Provenance The Ghost of a Flea was purchased by Varley around 1820, and later passed to his son Albert Varley. A label on the reverse of the canvas states that the panel was sold by Albert in February 1878, a fact confirmed by an inscription written by the poet and artist William Bell Scott (1811‚Äì1890) on the inside back cover of the Blake-Varley Sketchbook which reads, \\"I have since getting this book [in 1870], bought the painting of the \\"Ghost\\" of the Flea, from Mr Varley of Oakley St. Chelsea, son of John Varley\\".

Caribbean and Central America Awards In February 2009, the Pioneers of Prosperity Awards launched in seven countries in the Caribbean, including Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Later in 2009, Pioneers of Prosperity will launch across Central America, including the countries of Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. The competition is open to all private sector small and medium enterprises (SMEs) based in the participating countries that have between 5 and 250 employees and annual revenues of US$100,000 and $5,000,000. The prizes for the Caribbean awards will total to $600,000, including a $100,000 grand prize winner and several smaller prizes ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. Just under 600 firms applied for the competition, which closed on March 23, 2009. The winners will be selected by a jury process from a pool of applicants evaluated according to the COW-F framework, and the prizes awarded in June 2009.  Theoretical background The Pioneers of Prosperity program uses the COW-F framework,Michael Fairbanks, \\"The Last Best Chance: Prosperity, Competitiveness, and Natural Capitalism-The Ultimate Integration\\" in The Natural Advantage of Nations: Business Opportunities, Innovations and Governance in the 21st century, ed. K. Hargroves and M. H. Smith (London: Earthscan Publications Ltd., 2006), xxxv conceived of by development expert and author Michael Fairbanks,Changing the mind of a nation: Element in the process for creating prosperity http://www.sevenfund.org/pdf/Changing%20The%20Mind%20of%20a%20Nation.pdf to identify promising business models. The COW-F framework asserts that a good business model provides a unique value proposition to all of its stakeholders: Customers, Owners, Workers, and Future generations. Customers receive a product they value at a competitive price; Owners receive an above average return for their investment; Workers receive a high and rising standard of living; and all of this is achieved without eroding the social or environment fabric for future generations, and ideally while investing in the broader public good. According to Fairbanks, COW-F firms understand the correlation between satisfied employees and a successful business. Satisfied employees take pride in their place of work, have higher degrees of loyalty to their employer and have a vested interest in seeing the company succeed. The assumption is that by investing in their employees, through both rising wages and employee training, employers find themselves with happier employees that are more productive. Highly productive employees are a critical component of a successful business.Changing the mind of a nation: Element in the process for creating prosperity http://www.sevenfund.org/pdf/Changing%20The%20Mind%20of%20a%20Nation.pdf The ‚ÄòPioneers of Prosperity‚Äô program identifies and rewards outstanding emerging market COW-F entrepreneurs. By publicizing their stories and rewarding their efforts, it is hoped that the benefits of the COW-F model can be disseminated across the developing world.http://www.pioneersofprosperity.org As a condition of the grant, the winners use award proceeds for improvement of the skills and capabilities necessary to further enhance the COW-F model for their workers. The training may focus on both management and technical skills, including: financial management, market research techniques, product design, sales, and customer service.

She adopts a brisk, cheerful approach: socialising with guests at the wake, giving her husband's belongings to various charitable causes, and deciding she must devise an efficient plan to deal with her grief. Muriel's husband left her a considerable sum of money, and, despite having been advised not to make any \\"big decisions\\", she soon agrees to hand over control of the money to their son Giles (who received nothing from the will). Although it is clear to the audience that Giles is mismanaging the money, it comes as a surprise to Muriel when he loses her inheritance through poor investments. He reassures her there is nothing to worry about and the problem is simply \\"liquidity\\", but she is soon forced to sell her home and possessions and move to a small seaside town. Muriel ends the story poor and alone, losing contact with her children, Margaret having shown a great improvement and living an almost normal life after a spell of psychiatric treatment. It is implied Margaret's mental illness was the result of sexual molestation by her father. Muriel appears to be aware of this and also begins to wonder if she contributed to her husband's end with \\"all those death-dealing breakfasts.\\" She is now reduced to using the Meals on Wheels service she had once commanded, and her only entertainments are television and cassette tapes from the library.

Synopsis Susan (Maggie Smith) is the wife of a vicar, living in a small village near Leeds. Her husband is a popular local figure, well respected and he also seems to collect adoring middle aged and elderly women because of his status as the vicar, all of whom fuss and fawn over him and seem to passive aggressively compete with Susan for his time and affection. Susan is bored with her husband and unhappy with her life, although she is passive in this unhappiness other than her alcoholism. She has run up a debt with the local shop because of her constant buying of sherry, she dislikes the community she lives in and only gives the bare minimum of attention to her own parish duties as the vicar's wife. During a difficult afternoon trying to arrange the church flowers with several of the other women, Susan goes into the church's backroom and drinks the communion wine hidden in the cupboard. She then returns to the others, challenges one of the flower arrangements that includes spiky teasels and ends up falling down the altar stairs and hitting her head. The women take this opportunity to take Susan home, fuss over her husband and look through everything in the house under pretext of getting the vicar his lunch and \\"helping\\" Susan. On the next Sunday service, the vicar discovers the loss of the wine and has to celebrate the host in a bottle of Benylin, which Susan says will be fine since it is red, sweet and sticky. Susan starts buying her sherry from Ramesh, an Asian grocer in Leeds who is young, attractive and talks to her about his culture and life: he is married, but his wife is under 16, so not permitted to join him in England. The Bishop comes to lunch and Susan accidentally spills evaporated milk on him. A lock has been put on the communion wine cupboard in the vestry. During another visit to Ramesh, Susan begins an affair with him and finally discovers some happiness and enjoyment in life, until Ramesh asks her if the reason she drinks is his colour or because she has a problem with alcohol. This pushes Susan towards recovery: she begins to attend AA meetings, and attempts to be more honest with her husband. Ramesh returns to India to bring his wife home, selling his shop so that they can begin elsewhere. The vicar thinks that God is responsible for Susan's recovery, and his Bishop recommends him for a higher position in the church thanks to his \\"knowing what trials parishioners face\\". Susan remains passive, knowing that her recovery is due to Ramesh, and that God and her husband have little to do with it.

Storyline  Irene Ruddock is a single, middle-aged woman living near Bradford and is not afraid to speak, or rather write, her mind. She frequently writes to her MP, the police, the chemist ‚Äì everyone she can, to remedy the social ills she sees around her. Irene becomes suspicious of a neighbouring couple whom she suspects of neglecting their child, and tries to raise these suspicions to her doctor, who instead offers her a prescription (presumably some kind of anti- depressant or anti-psychotic medication) to help her forget her worries. Irene is eventually questioned by police after having written many abusive letters to the family, who, it emerges, were not neglecting the child but visiting him in hospital where he has just died of leukaemia. It is also revealed that Irene harassed the chemist through a series of letters (accusing his wife of being a prostitute) and finally had a court order taken out against her after a man she had accused of child molestation had a nervous breakdown. For her latest misconduct Irene receives a suspended sentence and is issued with social workers who try to help her find other interests; she is eventually gaoled after starting a new letter-writing campaign. In prison, Irene makes new friends and develops a thriving social life, taking classes and gaining new skills in a secretarial course. She states that she feels truly happy, perhaps for the first time in her life. She speaks happily as she reviews the process of being released from prison. This could be taken as somewhat ironic, as earlier in the monologue she harshly criticizes the amenities in prison, comparing them to being on holiday. The end of the monologue finds Irene in a significantly darker mood and tone. Sitting next to an empty bed in a darkened cell with minimal light from a window, she explains that her cell mate often has nightmares of the child she killed, and Irene must comfort her in the night. This conclusion is presented in similar fashion to the dark shift in fate of the main character at the end of another monologue from the same series, called A Woman of No Importance, but it is unknown whether this darker shift in this monologue also means an unhappy end for Irene.

Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company launched El Cid at Newport News, Virginia on 7 October 1899 for service between New York City and Gulf of Mexico seaports of New Orleans and Galveston, Texas. The United States Shipping Board took control of the ship from Southern Pacific Steamship Company in 1917. She was fitted out for United States Navy service by Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company at Brooklyn, New York. Work began on 22 November 1917. Gun platforms were added for two anti-aircraft guns forward and a 5\\"/51 caliber gun aft. The minelaying conversion enabled her to carry mines on three decks, and included six Otis elevators individually capable of transferring two mines every 20 seconds from the storage decks to the launching deck. Stern ports were cut for launching the mines and the rudder quadrant was raised to give adequate clearance. Watertight subdivision was improved by strengthening existing bulkheads and building two new bulkheads to divide the largest compartments so the ship might stay afloat if only one compartment were flooded. Quarters were enlarged to accommodate messing and berthing arrangements for a crew of about 400. The main machinery was overhauled and auxiliary machinery was added for the elevators, for heating the berthing spaces, for refrigerated food storage, for additional fresh water distilling capacity, for magazine sprinklers and galley and washroom plumbing, and enlarged electric generators for lighting and radio communications. Existing coal bunkers on the third deck were replaced with a bunker in the hold forward of the boiler room with chutes to load coal over the mines. Larger boats and heavier anchors required larger davits and anchor windlass, and the mines required specialized handling machinery.Daniels, Josephus The Northern Barrage and Other Mining Activities (1920) Government Printing Office pp.70-71 USS Canonicus was commissioned on 2 March 1918 with Commander Thomas L. Johnson, USN, in command. Canonicus cleared Newport, Rhode Island on 12 May 1918 and reached Inverness, Scotland on 27 May 1918. While operating as part of Mine Squadron 1 from 7 June until the close of the war on 11 November 1918, Canonicus: * planted 763 mines during the 1st minelaying excursion on 7 June, * planted 710 mines during the 2nd minelaying excursion on 30 June, * planted 798 mines during the 3rd minelaying excursion on 14 July, * planted 810 mines during the 4th minelaying excursion on 29 July, * planted 170 mines during the 5th minelaying excursion on 8 August, * planted 640 mines during the 6th minelaying excursion on 18 August, * planted 810 mines during the 7th minelaying excursion on 26 August, * planted 820 mines during the 8th minelaying excursion on 7 September, * planted 830 mines during the 9th minelaying excursion on 20 September, * planted 860 mines during the 10th minelaying excursion on 27 September, * planted 860 mines during the 11th minelaying excursion on 4 October, * planted 820 mines during the 12th minelaying excursion on 13 October, and * planted 890 mines during the final 13th minelaying excursion on 24 October. transport. Canonicus returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 3 January 1919 and was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force on 7 February 1919. She made three voyages as a troop transport between the United States East Coast and France, returning 4,166 troops to the United States. Canonicus was decommissioned on 7 August 1919 and returned to the Southern Pacific Steamship Company. Big Four In the words of British Rear Admiral Lewis Clinton-Baker, the North Sea mine barrage was the \\"biggest mine planting stunt in the world's history.\\" The United States converted eight civilian steamships as minelayers for the 100,000 mines manufactured for the barrage. The largest of these were four freighters owned by Southern Pacific Steamship Company. Southern Pacific Transportation Company had evolved from the First Transcontinental Railroad to become the dominant transportation provider in California. Owners of the original Central Pacific Railroad were known as the Big Four. Sailors similarly referred to these former Southern Pacific ships as the Big Four. * El Siglo became No. 1694 USS * El Dia became No. 1695 USS * El Cid became No. 1696 USS * El Rio became No. 1697 USS References * External links *Department of the Navy: Naval Historical Center: Online Library of Selected Images: U.S. Navy Ships: USS Canonicus (ID # 1696), 1918-1919 Category:World War I mine warfare vessels of the United States Category:Transports of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in New York (state) Category:1899 ships Category:Unique minelayers of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in Newport News, Virginia ","title":"USS Canonicus (ID-1696)"},{"id":"20042778","text":"Class 69 may refer to: *British Rail Class 69, a future class of diesel locomotive converted from existing class 56 locomotives *NSB Class 69, a Norwegian passenger train * DRG Class 69, a German 2-2-2 passenger locomotive class operated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn following the annexation of Austria prior to World War II and comprising: **BB√ñ Class 12 , locomotives 69 001 - 002 **KkStB Class 112, locomotive 69 011 See also * Type 69 (disambiguation) ","title":"Class 69"},{"id":"20042779","text":"Kurt Georg Hugo Thomas (25 May 1904 - 31 March 1973) was a German composer, conductor and music educator.

It was first published in serialized form in the Franco- Belgian comics magazine √Ä Suivre (#96-106), and as a complete volume first in 1987 by Casterman. In English, it was published as The Tower (Stories of the Fantastic) in 1993 by NBM Publishing.  Background  As the story takes place in the ancient history of the Obscure World, La Tour is the one Les Cit√©s Obscures album exhibiting the least connection to steampunk fiction. Instead, The Tower's design, architecture, and clothing show strong Medieval influences of time periods between the 10th and the 15th centuries, particularly Pre-Romanesque, Romanesque, Gothic, and early Renaissance art. The technology used is therefore more reminiscent of clockpunk.  Plot  We are introduced to Giovanni Battista (whose visual appearance Schuiten based on Orson Welles playing Falstaff in Chimes at MidnightDossier FRANCOIS SCHUITEN, in Reddition - Zeitschrift f√ºr Graphische Literatur, #32, 1998, p.22 (German)). Battista is a maintenance engineer in The Tower, a gigantic structure with many such engineers, each maintaining his own sector. The time is about 400 AT (Age of The Tower), which is the number of years since The Tower's ongoing construction has begun. Battista lives a solitary life alone in his sector, focused intently on his job and on following its established protocols. His world, like the graphic novel itself, is black and white. But over the years he loses contact with the other maintenance engineers and even with his superiors. His repeated requests for a resupply of materials needed to repair the structure are seemingly ignored. Thus, Battista's sector begins to fall into decay. Worried about the increasingly decrepit state of his sector, Battista decides to leave his post and to inform his superiors in person. Although he begins the journey on foot, climbing down The Tower, he eventually builds a parachute to speed his descent. But the parachute is caught in an updraft, and Battista is taken even higher in The Tower. There he encounters an autonomous civilization whose technological and architectural level Schuiten locates exactly at the segue between Medieval Gothic art and the early Renaissance period. Like Battista, the inhabitants are following the protocols of the established bureaucracy, and patiently waiting for news from the base of The Tower while their sector decays. One inhabitant, Elias, has a collection of paintings. Unlike the rest of the graphic novel, these painting are in color, and Battista is fascinated by the scenes they depict: of nudity, of war, and most importantly of people motivated by their passions. Having failed to reach the base of The Tower, Battista decides to head upwards, intending to reach the top where pioneers and construction engineers are said to continually advance the building higher and higher. As Battista reaches the top, he comes upon the shocking revelation that The Tower's continuous construction was abandoned years before. The pioneers apparently left in a hurry, taking everything of value and discarding what was too heavy to carry. The trail of discarded belongings leads Battista to a gigantic winch that was presumably used to lower the pioneers through the hollow center of The Tower to its base. At the bottom, Battista finds piles of riches thrown haphazardly about and abandoned, partially obscuring the exit. Near a discarded picture frame he glimpses some color--what Battista mistakes for a painting is in fact the world outside The Tower. Battista leaves The Tower behind and gets swept up in a raging war at its base. He kills for the first time in his life, and eventually helps to lead a band of soldiers to victory as The Tower collapses in the distance behind him. Battista makes a life for himself and rises to a position of some distinction, living happily ever after, but haunted by his memories of The Tower and by the stark contrast between its black-and-white world and the colorful life he now enjoys.

In order for the kkStB to provide a fast feeder service to express train stations, a requirement arose for small, fast locomotives. Karl G√∂lsdorf designed Class 112 for this purpose. The engines were well built, enabled a top speed of 100 km/h to be attained for short periods of time and could haul 100 tonnes continuously at 80 km/h. On their deliver in 1907 by Krauss in Linz the two engines were fitted with a small smokebox superheater, that was later removed. The small locomotives were initially used to haul newspaper trains between Vienna and Linz. Later they hauled the shuttle (Pendler) between H√ºtteldorf and Unterpurkersdorf, a connecting line to the Vienna Stadtbahn, where they travelled in the centre of the train.

She won the 1940 Carnegie Medal for British children's books. Biography Barne was born in Petersham, Surrey, but was brought up in Somerset and Sussex, and later studied at the Royal College of Music. On 12 April 1912, in Eastbourne, she married Eric Streatfeild, thus becoming the cousin-in-law of another popular children's writer Noel Streatfeild. Eric Streatfeild was the first cousin of Noel Streatfeild's father. Barne was a member of the Women's Voluntary Service, responsible for the reception of children evacuated to Sussex. During the war years, she published six novels, most notably Visitors from London about evacuees (J. M. Dent, 1940). For that work she won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. She is possibly best known now for her pony books Rosina Copper and its sequel Rosina and Son, about the true story of an Argentine polo pony mare that was rescued from neglect after being ordered to be killed. They were illustrated by Alfons Purtscher and Marcia Lane Foster respectively. Apart from her novels, she wrote some non-fiction books, including a biography of Elizabeth Fry (who was her husband's great grandmother) in 1950, a book about the orchestra and a history of the Girl Guides. She was the Girl Guides \\"Commissioner for Music and Drama\\" for some years. Ruth Gervis, the illustrator of a number of her books, said of her: She died on 3 February 1961 after a long illness.

Rugby career Prosser first played rugby for his home town, Glynneath, before moving to first class side Neath. It was with Neath that Prosser first played against international opposition, when he was chosen for a joint Neath / Aberavon team to face the touring South Africans in 1931. It was a very close game that was 3-3, when in a final attack, the South Africans scored the winning try. Prosser trialed for the Wales team as early as the 1931/32 seasonBillot (1974), pg 166. but did not gain his first cap until the 1934 Home Nations Championship, when he was selected to face England. The match was played at the Cardiff Arms Park under the captaincy of first time international John Evans, and the inexperienced Welsh team were poor in comparison to England. Out of 13 new caps on the day, five, including Evans, never played for Wales again, but Prosser returned in the next two games of the tournament, now led by the more reliable Claude Davey. Although Wales won these two games, Prosser was not reselected for the next years Championship. In 1935, Prosser was given another chance to face international tourist when Neath joined up with Aberavon again to face the touring All Blacks. Although the joint team lost to New Zealand Prosser brought his familiar style of offensive forward play through the All Black back division,Billot (1972), pg 103. and did enough to gain the favour of the Welsh selectors. Prosser played his final game for Wales one week later when he was chosen to face the same touring New Zealanders.

For reasons of cost, however, they achieved this by converting 0-6-0 tank locomotives built in 1898 by Krauss/Linz). One unit was converted by the Lokomotivfabrik Floridsdorf in 1934 and another in 1937. Locomotives 97.153 and 97.152 were used for the conversion. The boiler and the valve gear were used unchanged. Oil-firing was provided, the tank for which was installed on the rear section of the boiler barrel, and enabled one-man operation. The engines were given a special livery with the water tanks and driver's cab being painted light green. The little locomotives proved themselves well, but no more were converted, because from 1935 the BB√ñ DT 1 was available for short express trains.

The property was built by Robert Wynn, a member of the local gentry, following his marriage to his first wife, Dorothy Griffith. Plas Mawr occupied a plot of land off Conwy's High Street and was constructed in three phases between 1576 and 1585 at a total cost of around ¬£800. Wynn was known for his hospitality, and the household was supported by Wynn's local dairy herds, orchards and gardens. On his death he laid out complex instructions for dividing his estate; the resulting law-case took years to resolve, effectively preventing the redevelopment of the house and preserving it in its original condition. After 1683 Plas Mawr passed into the hands of the Mostyn family and ceased to be used as a family home. It was rented out for various purposes during the 18th and 19th centuries, including for use as a school, cheap lodgings and finally as the headquarters of the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art. In the 20th century the house became increasingly well known for its preserved Elizabethan architecture, but the costs of maintenance grew considerably and its condition deteriorated. The Welsh heritage agency Cadw took over the management of the property in 1993 and carried out an extensive, 42-month-long restoration project at a total cost of ¬£3.3 million. With many of its rooms redecorated to resemble their condition in 1665, and replanted Renaissance gardens, it is now run as a tourist attraction. Architecturally, Plas Mawr is almost unchanged from the 16th century, and the historian Rick Turner considers the house to be \\"the finest surviving town house of the Elizabethan era\\". Plas Mawr shows a blend of continental Renaissance and local North Wales influences, with an innovative floor-plan and architectural detailing. The house still retains much of its original plasterwork, which incorporates symbols, badges and heraldry, which the historian Peter Smith has described as \\"the most perfect and the most complete memorial to Elizabethan Wales.\\" The architecture of the house influenced other contemporary projects in North Wales, and was later copied during the 19th and 20th centuries in buildings around the town of Conwy, including the local police station and nearby hotel. History =16th ‚Äì 17th centuries= Plas Mawr was built in the town of Conwy between 1576 and 1585 by Robert Wynn. Robert came from a prosperous local family and entered the service of first Sir Walter Stonor and then Sir Philip Hoby, both administrators and senior officials to King Henry VIII. Robert fought and was injured at the Siege of Boulogne in 1544, took part in military campaigns in Scotland and traveled extensively across Europe. He invested in land across North Wales and married his first wife, Dorothy Griffith, a member of the local gentry, in 1570. Once married, Robert needed a suitable house and chose to settle in Conwy, a prosperous town that was known in the 16th century for its genteel society.; arch-braced collar trusses joined using \\"double pegging\\" In 1570, Robert paid Hugh Mershe ¬£200 for an existing \\"mansion house\\" in Conwy, positioned in the middle of a burgage plot on what is now Crown Lane. More land to the north of this was purchased from a Richard Peake in 1576 for ¬£40, and work then began on the north wing of Plas Mawr, which was completed by the following year.; Mershe's former house was pulled down to allow the preparation of the foundations of the rest of the building, including the digging of fresh drains. Robert lived in the completed north wing until 1580, when the central and south ranges were built, finishing the main part of Plas Mawr.Turner pp.11‚Äì13. Robert went on to rent further land around the north of Plas Mawr.; The land at the south end of the burgage, however, facing onto the High Street, belonged to a Robert Laythwood, who had a house there. Wynne purchased this in 1585, probably for the relatively high price of ¬£40, and demolished it to enable the final phase of development, using the space to build a gatehouse that formed the new entrance to Plas Mawr.; Further small pieces of land were bought on the north-west side of the house and converted into an ornamental garden, bringing the total cost of the land to around ¬£300.; The result was the grandest Elizabethan town house in Wales at the time. These three phases of house construction ‚Äì 1576‚Äì77, 1580 and 1585 ‚Äì were probably overseen by several different senior craftsmen, possibly working to an original plan determined by a surveyor or mason working at the English royal court.; Judging by the details of the roof design, a single master carpenter may have been used for all three parts of the build; he probably worked elsewhere across the region during these years, including on 15 other houses and two churches. Both of the first two phases of work were probably conducted by the same team of plasterers, possibly from London, and they used as much as of lime plaster on the rendering. Timber and slates were brought down the Conwy valley for the house, with grey Silurian grit rubble quarried from the hills near the town, and finer sandstone brought from nearby Deganwy.; ; The total of the building work was probably around ¬£500. Entertainment and hospitality were important to a gentleman's 16th- century social status and, according to his nephew, the antiquarian John Wynn, Robert Wynn kept a \\"worthy plentiful house\\". The household was supported by milk from Wynn's own dairy herds, and by food from the orchards, gardens and a fish trap that he owned around the town. The house had its own brewing, baking and dairy facilities, and further supplies were bought in from regional merchants. Dorothy died in 1586 and Robert married Dorothy Dymock, with whom he had seven children at Plas Mawr. When Robert died in 1598 he left a complex will that led to legal disputes between the family and the executor, Sir Roger Mostyn. The legal case effectively halted any further development of the house, by now the most prominent in Conwy, until its resolution in 1630. The property passed to Robert's grandson, another Robert Wynn, in 1637, and onto his daughter, Elin in 1683. By 1665, the house was equipped to a quality and style that would have put it only just behind the houses of the major gentry families in Caernarfonshire. Elin then married into the Wynne family, and made little use of the house, and it ultimately passed by marriage into the Mostyn family. =18th ‚Äì 19th centuries= The Mostyns' principal residence was Mostyn Hall in Flintshire and so the family rented out Plas Mawr to various tenants during the 18th and 19th centuries.; In the 18th century the gatehouse was used as a courthouse and the main house as cheap housing. In the 19th century, parts of the house were converted into a school and space for other small businesses, as well as still being used for domestic accommodation: in 1881, the house had 25 residents. Minor changes were made to Plas Mawr in the process, such as the installation of partition walls to subdivide the larger rooms, but it remained largely intact. The Mostyns offered the house for sale in 1870, as part of a package of land including Bodysgallen Hall, but there were no offers. By the 1880s, the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art became concerned about the condition of Plas Mawr, and in 1887 Lord Mostyn agreed to lease the building to the Academy for use as their headquarters. The architects Arthur and Herbert Baker were commissioned to survey the building, conduct repairs and remove some of the post-17th century alterations, and J. R. Furness then carried out conservation work on much of the plasterwork. The Victoria Gallery was built onto the north-west side of the house to hold artistic exhibitions, and a weather vane was added to the top of the building to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. =20th ‚Äì 21st centuries= By the early 20th century, Plas Mawr's historical significance was increasingly well understood, but the costs of maintaining the house grew considerably. By the middle of the century, the finer sandstone had corroded and the timber beams were deteriorating; a 1956 survey described them as \\"much decayed\\".; The plaster ceilings were bowing and coming away from their timbers. The Academy of Art sought government and private assistance to undertake temporary and partial repairs, but these were insufficient and in 1993 it moved into new accommodation and the property was passed into the control of the state, under the management of the Welsh heritage agency Cadw.; Cadw carried out a major restoration project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis.; The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re- rendered and lime washed.; Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, with the exception of the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. The Great Chamber is available for wedding ceremonies. Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities. The restoration included installing original and replica interior furnishings, using wall hangings woven from Kidderminster stuff and Dornix. In what historical consultant Charles Kightly has praised as a \\"brave and successful\\" decision, much of the plasterwork was repainted, using reversible techniques, to resemble its 17th-century condition.; In total the project cost ¬£3.3 million, and won the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Building Conservation Award.; Further work followed in 2006 to restore the gardens, again attempting to replicate the style prevalent in 1665. In the 21st century the house is operated as a tourist attraction by Cadw. The historian Rick Turner considers Plas Mawr to be \\"the finest surviving town house of the Elizabethan era\\" and it is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument.; Architecture Cross-section and ground-floor plan of Plas Mawr: A ‚Äì Parlour; B ‚Äì Brewhouse; C ‚Äì Pantry; D ‚Äì Upper Courtyard; E ‚Äì Kitchen; F ‚Äì Hall; G ‚Äì Buttery; H ‚Äì Lower Courtyard; I and J ‚Äì Gatehouse =Influences= Architecturally, Plas Mawr is almost unchanged from the 16th century, making it a very rare survival from this period. The architectural style is a product of the broader Renaissance influences prevalent across Europe at the time. Robert Wynn spent time in Germany, and the style of Plas Mawr makes use of North German Gothic themes, particularly in its use of symmetry, the pedimented windows at the front of the house, faceted finials and crow-stepped gables.; ; These features were already popular in England when the house was built, and indeed Plas Mawr is very similar in design to Eastbury Manor House, the two possibly being based on the same architectural plan. Some of these features had already begun to spread into Wales ‚Äì crow-stepped gables, for example, were already being used in Flintshire by the 1580s ‚Äì but others were ground breaking in Wales, such as the use of ovolo-moulded and dormer windows.; Nonetheless, Robert Wynn was only an emerging member of the gentry, and his house was not as large or as sophisticated as contemporary grander Renaissance properties built in larger rural settings. Some of the house's architecture also reflects the influences from contemporary buildings across North Wales, in particular Gwydir Castle, built by Robert Wynn's father John. Plas Mawr lacks a fashionable long gallery, for example, which was popular in England at the time, and was already beginning to appear in Welsh houses. Instead, it has a rear turret, or belvedere, which is raised prominently above the height of the rest of the house, overlooking the town: this was a slightly antiquated feature, but was widely used in other Wynn family properties, including Bodysgallen Hall.; ; The design of Plas Mawr influenced other buildings in North Wales at the time, including the redecoration of Gwydir Castle, Maenan Hall further up the Conwy valley, Plas Mawr in Caernarfon and Hen Blas in Beaumaris.; It also later shaped the architecture of 19th- and 20th-century buildings in Conwy itself, surviving examples of which include the town's police station and the Castlebank Hotel. =Layout= Restored kitchen and batterie de cuisine Modern visitors typically enter the house from the High Street to the south, passing through the gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building to be built in North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed to show off the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors.; Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn. The main house forms an \\"H\\"-shape, with a north and a south wing joined in the middle, all facing onto an upper courtyard. The upper courtyard was key to the way that the main house functioned: it linked almost all the ground floor rooms in the house, as well as providing access to the cellars, and gave an impressive view of the turret towers. In the south wing was the hall and the buttery, with the red and white chambers above them. Probably when Plas Mawr was first built, and certainly by 1665, the hall would have been used to meet ordinary visitors and for servants' meals, rather than forming the main room of the house; the wooden benches and table on display are original to the property. Traditionally, the service rooms in houses had been placed at the far end of the main hall, but Plas Mawr departed from this design. The service area, including the kitchen and pantry, was instead placed in the centre of the building, between the parlour and the hall; this radical redesign was copied at nearby Hafod Lwyfog. The restored kitchen is equipped with a batterie de cuisine, with a combination of original and replica equipment. Above these rooms was the great chamber, the main room which formed the ceremonial centre of the house.; In the north wing was the brewhouse and the parlour, with two chambers above them, the latter possibly used by Dorothy Wynn as her bedroom. The private bedrooms for the family and guests were each equipped with a fireplace, an important status symbol in the period. The roof attics of the house contained a great deal of space for accommodating the household servants. The attic above the great chamber has a grand timber roof with arch-braced collar trusses, joined using an unusual system called \\"double pegging\\", which is only used in the Conwy valley during the late 16th century. It appears that the great chamber's ceiling was originally supposed to be open, looking up to the timbers with the trusses visible, but a mistake in the construction of the walls meant that one side of the chamber no longer fitted smoothly with the timbers, creating an ugly appearance; a plaster ceiling was then added to hide the error. The gardens behind the house may originally have resembled the gardens at Bodysgallen Hall, which were laid out in the Renaissance style popular across Europe. The slope of the land results in Plas Mawr's gardens forming the upper and lower terraces, and these have been replanted and restored in an attempt to show them as they might have appeared in 1665. The summerhouse is based on a version shown in a contemporary painting of Llanerch's gardens, and the flowerpots are modeled on those found in excavations at Tredegar House. =Plasterwork= Seven rooms still possess elements of their original plasterwork, which the historian Peter Smith has described as \\"the most perfect and the most complete memorial to Elizabethan Wales\\", and their original wooden carved panels that line the walls.; ; The plasterwork includes extensive heraldry, badges and symbols: in the upper north range alone, 22 different heraldic emblems are molded into the ceilings and walls. The gatehouse shows the royal arms, as do the great chamber and the parlour, probably because they were intended to host senior guests. The badges of numerous monarchs are included throughout the house, including those of Richard II, Richard III, Henry IV and Henry VII.; The badges of other prominent nobles, such as Robert Dudley, are also featured in the house. The plasterwork in the parlour displays the arms of Robert Wynn himself, and Robert Wynn's bedchamber above the brewhouse shows the combined arms of the Wynn and Griffith families, which are generally given equal prominence throughout the house.; Robert Wynn's arms are most prominent in the hall and the bedchambers, where the royal arms are smaller and less prominent. In the 16th century, Wynn's heraldry would probably have been echoed in the furnishings of the house, including the fabrics, cups and silverware. The plasterwork also incorporates a number of classical themes, but these are not as well executed as the badges and other emblems: the historian Rick Turner describes them as \\"rather token additions\\", and Smith considers this part of the decoration to be \\"naive\\".; Turner p.33.
