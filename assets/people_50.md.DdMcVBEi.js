Club career Telford joined Leeds United Ladies in 2007 from relegated club Sunderland. In May of that year she had turned out for Charlton Athletic in a tournament in Spain, but Charlton disbanded their women's team shortly afterwards. At Leeds, Telford was named player of the match in the 2008 FA Women's Cup final, after an impressive performance in Leeds' 4‚Äì1 defeat to Arsenal. In summer 2010, Telford was called into the England squad as an unattached player, having left Leeds Carnegie. Matt Beard signed her for Chelsea Ladies ahead of the inaugural 2011 FA WSL season. In October 2012 it was announced that Telford would join Australian club Perth Glory for the 2012‚Äì13 winter season. Telford left Chelsea after three years in December 2013, signing for Notts County ahead of the 2014 FA WSL season. There she was reunited with her former Leeds coach Rick Passmoor and she would have the opportunity to train with goalkeeper coach Kevin Pilkington. Chelsea coach Emma Hayes' decision to hand Telford a free transfer left her shocked and raging. Telford was carrying a shoulder injury ahead of the 2015 FA Women's Cup Final and Notts County were angry when The Football Association refused their request for dispensation to sign another goalkeeper. Telford recovered to play in the team's 1‚Äì0 defeat by Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. She signed a two-year extension to her contract in November 2015. In June 2016, Telford suffered torn ankle ligaments in a win over Doncaster Belles and was ruled out for three months. Notts County moved quickly to sign Lizzie Durack as a replacement. Notts County Ladies folded in April 2017. International career Telford made her senior international debut on 11 March 2007 as a substitute against Scotland, having previously played at U17, U19, U21 and U23 levels. In May 2009, Telford was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by The Football Association. In May 2015, Mark Sampson named Telford in his final squad for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, hosted in Canada. England eventually finished in third place, but Telford was disappointed to be the only member of the squad not to play any minutes at the tournament. In 2019, Telford was part of the England team that won the SheBelieves Cup in the United States, playing two of the three games against Brazil and Japan. Later that year, Telford was called up by Phil Neville to the 2019 World Cup squad. As part of England's social-media facing squad announcement, her name was announced by Sports Presenter Nicole Holliday. Having been included in England squads for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup and UEFA Women's Euro 2017 without getting to play, Telford finally got her first minutes at a major tournament on 14 June 2019, starting in England's second group game at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup against Argentina. Personal life Telford attended Tanfield School, then Gateshead College on the Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme. Telford publicly came out in 2017. She is in a relationship with England cricketer Georgia Elwiss.

It may be an independent unit, or integrated into the electrodes.  History  Efforts to amplify biosignals started with the development of electrocardiography. In 1887, Augustus Waller, a British physiologist, successfully measured the electrocardiograph of his dog using two buckets of saline, in which he submerged each of the front and the hind paws.Webster, John G. (2006) Encyclopedia of Medical Devices and Instrumentation Volume I. New Jersey: Wiley-Interscience. . A few months later, Waller successfully recorded the first human electrocardiography using the capillary electrometer. However, at the time of invention, Waller did not envision that electrocardiography would be used extensively in healthcare. The electrocardiograph was impractical to use until Willem Einthoven, a Dutch physiologist, innovated the use of the string galvanometer for cardiac signal amplification. Significant improvements in amplifier technologies led to the usage of smaller electrodes that were more easily attached to body parts. In the 1920s, a way to electrically amplify the cardiac signals using vacuum tubes was introduced, which quickly replaced the string galvanometer that amplified the signal mechanically. Vacuum tubes have a larger impedance, so the amplification was more robust. Also, its relatively small size compared to the string galvanometer contributed the widespread use of the vacuum tubes. Furthermore, the large metal buckets were no longer needed, as much smaller metal-plate electrodes were introduced. By the 1930s, electrocardiograph devices could be carried to the patient's home for the purpose of bedside monitoring.Rowbottom ME, Susskind C. In: Electricity and Medicine: History of their Interaction. San Francisco (CA): San Francisco Press; 1984. With the emergence of electronic amplification, it was quickly discovered that many features of the electrocardiography were revealed with various electrode placement.Ernstine and Levine report the use of vacuum-tubes to amplify the electrocardiogram instead of the mechanical amplification of the string galvanometer.  Variations =Electrocardiography Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) records the electrical activity of the heart, across the surface of the thorax skin. The signals are detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded by a device external to the body.\\"ECG- simplified. Aswini Kumar M.D.\\". LifeHugger. The amplitude of ECG ranges from 0.3 to 2 mV for the QRS complex, which is used to determine the interbeat interval from which the frequency is derived. The typical requirements for the amplifiers to be used in ECG include: * Low internal noise (<2 mV) * High Input Impedance (Zin > 10 MŒ©) * Bandwidth ranging from 0.16‚Äì250 Hz * Bandwidth cutoffs (>18 dB/octave). * Notch filter (50 or 60 Hz, depending on country/region) * Common mode rejection ratio (CMRR > 107 dB) * Common mode input range (CMR ¬± 200 mV) * Static electricity shock protection (>2000 V). Electromyography Electromyography (EMG) records the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. It records various types of muscle signals from simple relaxation by using placing electrodes on the subject's forehead, to complex neuromuscular feedback during stroke rehabilitation. The EMG signals are acquired from the electrodes applied over or nearby the muscles to be monitored. The electrodes delegates signals to the amplifier unit, usually consisting of high performance differential amplifiers. The usual types of the signal of the interest are in the range of 0.1‚Äì2000 mV amplitude, over a bandwidth of about 25‚Äì500 Hz. Although many electrodes still connect to an amplifier using wires, some amplifiers are small enough to mount directly on the electrode. Some minimal specifications for a modern EMG amplifier includes: * Low internal noise (<0.5 mV) * High input impedance (>100 MŒ©) * Flat bandwidth and sharp high and low frequency cutoffs (>18 dB/octave). * High common mode rejection ratio (CMRR > 107 dB) * Common mode input range (CMR > ¬±200 mV) * Static electricity shock protection (>2000 V) * Gain stability > ¬±1% Electroencephalography Electroencephalography (EEG) instrumentation is similar to EMG instrumentation in terms of involving the placement of many surface electrodes on the patient's skin, specifically, on scalp. While EMG acquires the signals from muscles below the skin, EEG attempts to acquire signals on the patient's scalp, generated by brain cells. Simultaneously, EEG records the summed activity of tens of thousands to millions of neurons. As the amplifiers became small enough to integrate with the electrodes, EEG has become to have the potential for long term use as a brain-computer interface, because the electrodes can be kept on the scalp indefinitely. The temporal and spatial resolutions and signal to noise ratios of EEG have always lagged behind those of comparable intracortical devices, but it has the advantage of not requiring surgery. High performance differential amplifiers are used for amplification. Signals of interest are in the range of 10 ¬µV to 100 ¬µV, over the frequency range of 1‚Äì50 Hz. Similar to EMG amplifiers, EEG benefits from the usage of integrated circuit. The chances of EEG is also mainly from the asymmetrical placement of electrodes, which leads to increased noise or offset.Northrop, R. B. (2012). Analysis and Application of Analog Electronic Circuits to Biomedical Instrumentation. CRC Press. Some minimal specifications for a modern EEG amplifier includes: * Low internal voltage and current noise(<1 mV, 100 pA) * High input impedance (>108 MŒ©) * Bandwidth (1‚Äì50 Hz) * Frequency cutoffs (>18 dB/octave) * High common mode rejection ratio (>107) * Common mode input range (greater than ¬±200 mV). * Static electricity shock protection (>2000 V) * Gain stability > ¬±1% Galvanic skin response Galvanic skin response is a measurement of the electrical conductance of the skin, which is directly influenced by how much the skin is moist. Since the sweat glands are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, the skin conductance is crucial in measuring the psychological or physiological arousal.Martini, Frederic; Bartholomew, Edwin (2003). Essentials of Anatomy & Physiology. San Francisco: Benjamin Cummings. p. 267. . The arousal and the eccrine sweat gland activity are clinically found to have direct relation. High skin conductance due to sweating can be used to predict that the subject is in a highly aroused state, either psychologically or physiologically, or both.Carlson, Neil (2013). Physiology of Behavior. New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . Galvanic skin response can be measured either as resistance, called skin resistance activity (SRA) or skin conductance activity (SCA), which is a reciprocal of SRA. Both SRA and SCA include two types of responses: the average level and the short-term phasic response. Most modern instruments measure conductance, although they both can be displayed with the conversion made in circuitry or software. Other Electrocorticography (ECoG) records the cumulative activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons with a sheet of electrodes placed directly on the surface of the brain. In addition to requiring surgery and having low resolution, the ECoG device is wired, meaning the scalp cannot be completely closed, increasing the risk of infection. However, researchers investigating ECoG claim that the grid \\"possesses characteristics suitable for long term implantation\\". The neurotrophic electrode is a wireless device that transmits its signals transcutaneously. In addition, it has demonstrated longevity of over four years in a human patient, because every component is completely biocompatible. It is limited in the amount of information it can provide, however, because the electronics it uses to transmit its signal (based around differential amplifiers) require so much space on the scalp that only four can fit on a human skull.Interview with Dr. Kennedy, Senior Research Scientist, Neural Signals, Inc., 9/30/2010 In one experiment, Dr. Kennedy adapted the neurotrophic electrode to read local field potentials (LFPs). He demonstrated that they are capable of controlling assistive technology devices, suggesting that less invasive techniques can be used to restore functionality to locked-in patients. However, the study did not address the degree of control possible with LFPs or make a formal comparison between LFPs and single unit activity. Alternatively, the Utah array is currently a wired device, but transmits more information. It has been implanted in a human for over two years and consists of 100 conductive silicon needle-like electrodes, so it has high resolution and can record from many individual neurons. Design=Acquiring signals Nowadays, mostly digital amplifiers are used to record biosignals. The amplification process does not only depend on the performance and specifications of the amplifier device, but also closely binds to the types of electrodes to attach on the subject's body. Types of electrode materials and the mount position of electrodes affect the acquirement of the signals.Bronzino, Joseph D. (2006). The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, Third Edition. Florida: CRC Press. Multielectrode arrays are also used, in which multiple electrodes are arranged in an array. Electrodes made with certain materials tend to perform better by increasing surface area of the electrodes. For instance, Indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes have less surface area than those made with other materials, like titanium nitride. More surface area results in reducing impedance of electrode, then neurons signals are obtained easier. ITO electrodes tend to be flat with a relatively small surface area, and are often electroplated with platinum to increase surface area and improve signal-to-area ratio.Interview with Dr. Potter, Associate Professor, Georgia Institute of Technology, 10/16/2013 Digital amplifiers and filters are produced small enough nowadays to be combined with electrodes, serving as preamplifiers. The need for preamplifiers is clear in that the signals that neurons (or any other organs) produce are weak. Therefore, preamplifiers preferably are to be placed near the source of the signals, where the electrodes are adjacent to. Another advantage for having preamplifiers close to the signal source is that the long wires lead to significant interference or noise. Therefore, it is best to have the wires as short as possible. However, when wider bands are needed, for instance a very high (action potentials) or a low frequency (local field potentials), they could be filtered digitally, perhaps with second-stage analog amplifier before being digitized. There may be some drawbacks when several amplifiers in cascade. It depends on the type, analog or digital. However, in general, filters cause time-delay and amendments are needed to have signals in sync. Also, as extra complexity is added, it costs more money. In terms of digital amplifiers, a lot of works that the laboratories do are feeding back signals to the networks in closed loop, real-time. As a result, more time is needed to apply on signals when there are more digital amplifiers on the way. One solution is using field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the ‚Äúblank slate‚Äù integrated circuit that is written whatever on it. Using FPGA sometimes reduces a need to use computers, resulting in a speed-up of filtering. Another problem with cascaded filters occurs when the maximum output of the first filter is smaller than the raw signals, and the second filter has a higher maximum output that the first filter. In that case, it is impossible to recognize if the signals have reached the maximum output or not. Design challenges The trend with the development in electrodes and amplifiers has been reducing its size for better transportability, as well as making them implantable on the skin for prolonged recording of the signals. Preamplifiers, head-stage amplifiers stay the same except that they should have different form-factors. They should be lightweight, waterproof, not scratching skin or scalp from parts that they need to mount themselves, and they should dissipate heat well. Heat dissipation is a big issue, because extra heat may cause in the temperature of nearby tissue to rise, potentially causing a change in the physiology of the tissue. One of the solutions to dissipate heat is the usage of the Peltier device. Peltier device, uses Peltier effect or thermoelectric effect to create a heat flux between the two different types of materials. A Peltier device actively pumps the heat from one side to the other side of the device, consuming electrical energy. Conventional cooling using compressed gases would not be a feasible option for cooling down an individual integrated circuit, because it needs many other devices to operate such as evaporator, compressor and condenser. Overall, a compressor-based system is more for a large-scale cooling jobs, and is not viable for small-scale system like bioamplifiers. The passive cooling, like heat sink and fan, only limits the rise of temperature above the ambient condition, while Peltier devices can actively pull heat right out of a thermal load, just like compressor-based cooling systems. Also, Peltier devices can be manufactured at sizes well below 8 mm square, therefore they can be integrated to the bioamplifiers without making them to lose mobility.\\"Tellurex - Peltier FAQ\\".

She is the only U.S. Navy ship to be named for the siskin. History YMS-425, a motor minesweeper, was laid down on 6 June 1944 by the Astoria Marine Construction Co. at Astoria, Oregon; launched on 9 September 1944; and placed in service on 21 December 1944, Lt. Gustave J. Blasi, USNR, in command. The motor minesweeper conducted training exercises and shakedown along the U.S. West Coast during the spring and early summer of 1945. On 10 August, she departed San Francisco, California, and headed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She spent 10 days in the Hawaiian Islands before getting underway for Okinawa on the 31st. She stopped at Eniwetok from 12 to 14 September, at Saipan from 19 to 22 September, and made Okinawa on the 28th. From Okinawa, she headed to Japan; and, for the next six months, she operated in Japanese coastal waters, sweeping mines for the occupation forces. YMS-425 completed her part in the minesweeping operation and, on 11 March 1946, shaped a course for the United States. After stops at Saipan, Eniwetok, Johnston Island, and Pearl Harbor, she entered San Francisco Bay on 7 May. From San Francisco, California, she moved via the Panama Canal to Boston, Massachusetts, arriving there on 7 July 1946. YMS-425 decommissioned on 19 July 1946 and remained at Boston. On 1 September 1947, YMS-425 was renamed Siskin (AMS-58) and was assigned to the 1st Naval District at Boston for duty as a U.S. Naval Reserve training ship. Siskin recommissioned at Boston in March 1950 under the command of Lt. F. W. Cole. She operated along the southeastern and gulf coasts of the United States, from Norfolk, Virginia, to Panama City, Florida, assigned to Mine Division 42 (MinDiv 42) until January 1954. From January 1954 until January 1955, she was assigned to MinDiv 43 and served with the Naval Mine Countermeasures Station at Panama City, Florida. In November 1954, her homeport was changed to Charleston, South Carolina; and, from January to April 1955, she was overhauled at Norfolk, Virginia. On 7 February 1955, her designation was changed from AMS-58 to MSCO-58. After overhaul, she conducted refresher training, then returned to normal operations along the U.S. East Coast. Siskin arrived in Buffalo, New York, via the St. Lawrence Seaway, on 17 October 1957. She decommissioned there on 24 October and resumed duty as a Naval Reserve training ship. Later, she was transferred back to the 1st Naval District at Boston, Massachusetts, until 1 October 1968, when her name was struck from the Navy list. She was subsequently sold for scrapping.

Pedigree Donnerhall was by Donnerwetter, a stallion who stood at Gr√∂nwohldhof and competed at Grand Prix level with Herbert and Karin Rehbin before he was sold to the United States in 1990. His other approved sons include Donnerkiel, Dobrock and Don Wienero L. Donnerhall's dam, Ninette, also produced the mare Noblesse (by Pik Bube I). Ninette was from the Nagate line of mares. Her sire, Markus, was half-Thoroughbred and his sire Manolete xx is also found in the great eventing horse Volturno, winner of 2 Olympic silver medals and a silver medal at the 1978 World Championships in Lexington. He was approved for Hanoverian, Westphalian, Holstein, Bavarian, Baden-Wurttemberg, Hessen, KWPN, Danish Warmblood studbooks. He stood . Dressage career Donnerhall began his career in 1984, placing second out of 70 horses at his Stallion Performance Test held in Adelheidsdorf, with a score of 131.92. According to his rider, he was very easy to train, reaching the Grand Prix level of training in 2 years . He was especially known for his expressive passage, piaffe, and extended trot. Donnerhall had a stellar career as a dressage horse, winning some of the most prestigious competitions, including over 65 FEI Grand Prix Dressage classes and a life earning of D.M. 640,000. He was 1986 German DLG Champion in Hanover, beating out the very athletic Hanoverian stallion World Cup I. In 1994 German Champion (Mannheim), won the team gold and individual bronze at the Dressage World Championship in 1994 and at the European Dressage Championship in 1997 in Verden. In 1997, he also won the World Cup European League. Donnerhall earned his third team gold while finishing 4th individually at the 1998 Dressage World Championship. He was also named Oldenburg Stallion of the Year in 1998. The stallion then went on a \\"farewell tour\\" that same year, retiring from competitive sport at the age of 17. He died January 2002 of acute intestinal toxicopathy. Breeding career Donnerhall has the highest dressage breeding value of all stallions at 271, and has produced over 77 approved sons, 450 broodmares (84 State Premium), and over 636 competition horses . Like his sire, Donnerhall stood at Gr√∂nwohldhof. His first few years produced only a few offspring, as the stud was a good distance from the main Oldenburg breeding areas. Within a few years, however, his popularity grew immensely. At the 1998 Federal Championship in Warendorf, more than 50% of the horses had Donnerhall in their pedigree . Donnerhall passes on his flowing gait, presence, trainability, and excellent temperament. The 2007 Hanoverian Stallion had Donnerhall offspring 763 winning dressage competitors (84 as show jumpers), with prize money totaling Euro 1,502,302. Offspring include: * Don Primero: Champion 5-year old German dressage horse in Verden at the 1990 Bundeschampionate (score of 9.3), now a Grand Prix level dressage horse, siring offspring which sell at 6-figures. * Don Schufro: exported to Denmark, successful at Grand Prix with Andreas Helgstrand * Don Frederico: Champion of 1999 Hanovarian stallion licensing and considered second most valuable sport horse stallion with a Breeding Value Index of 174 points. * Donnerschlag * Donner bube: located in Wetaskiwin, Alberta, Canada -owner Dr. David Bell and Roxy Bell * Donnerschwee: sold for DM 220.000, the highest price up to that time paid for a horse at a German Breeding Association auction.

It is now operated as St Alphege Gardens.  History  The parish of St Alphege used two churches successively, moving from its original building to a former priory church nearby after the Dissolution of the Monasteries.  Original site  The first church was built adjoining the London Wall,\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert,C;Weinreb,D;Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) with the wall forming its northern side.The London Wall Walk Chapman, Hugh, Hall, Jenny, & Marsh, Geoffrey: London, The Museum of London 1985 The churchyard lay to the north of the wall. The earliest mention of this church dates to c. 1108‚Äì25, though it is said that it was established before 1068. The church was closed by Act of Parliament at the end of the sixteenth century, and demolished. The London Wall was left standing. The site of the church became a carpenter's yard. In 1837 it was laid out as a public garden, which remains today, with a preserved section of the London Wall on its north edge. After the realignment of the road London Wall, that section formerly running past the site of this church was renamed St Alphege Gardens. The churchyard to the north of the London Wall was still open in 1677, but was subsequently built over. The last building on the site, using the London Wall as its southern boundary, was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War. This exposed the Roman city wall, on which the medieval wall had been built. When a new Salters' Hall‚Äîwhich was opened in 1976‚Äîwas built on the site, the area north of the London Wall was made into a garden for the Hall.  Priory church  The second church began as the Priory Church of the (probably Benedictine) nunnery of St Mary-within-Cripplegate. This was probably founded before 1000, but by 1329 the community had fallen into decay. The land passed into the hands of William Elsing, who founded a hospital on the site, Elsing Spital, in 1331. Originally a secular establishment, it was taken over by Augustinian canons in 1340. The hospital closed in 1536, with the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Remains of the medieval tower.After the closure of the original Church of St Alphege, the Priory Church became the new Parish Church. The rest of the Spital site was sold to Sir John Williams, who built a private house in its grounds, which was destroyed by fire in 1541.Sion College and Library, Pearce. E.H. The property was subsequently sold on, and used for the foundation of Sion College in 1630. The church was repaired in 1624, and the upper part of the steeple rebuilt in 1649. It was damaged, but not destroyed, in the Great Fire of 1666.Vanished churches of the City of London Huelin, G.: London, Guildhall Library Publishing 1996 Further repairs were made in 1684 and 1701. The parishioners applied in 1711 to the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches for funds to enlarge the building, and in 1718 petitioned Parliament for funds; neither initiative proved successful. The steeple was in such a condition by 1747 that the bells could not be rung, and four of the six were sold.  Rebuilding  In 1774 the church was found to be unfit for use, and a committee was set up to arrange its rebuilding. This was done at a cost of ¬£1350, retaining the tower. The new church was opened on 24 July 1777. The rebuilt church had two fronts; an eastern one in Aldermanbury, and one to the north facing London Wall. George Godwin described them as ‚Äúboth equally remarkable for want of taste in the arrangement, and of beauty in the effect‚Äù. The east front had a Venetian window between two pilasters, elevated on a basement; this arrangement was flanked by two doorways. The door and window surrounds and pilasters were stone, the rest brick. The fa√ßade to London Wall had two Doric columns, flattened against the wall, supporting an entablature and pediment. Between the columns was a doorway, its lobby leading into the medieval tower. The interior of the body of the church was described by Godwin as ‚Äúmerely a plain room with a flat ceiling, crossed from north to south by one large band at the east end‚Äù. The pulpit was, unconventionally, placed against the west wall, so that the congregation faced away from the altar. By 1900, the tower and porch were again in a poor state, and the north entrance was rebuilt with a neo-Gothic fa√ßade in 1913. The church was damaged in an air raid in the First World War. The Parish was amalgamated with that of St Mary Aldermanbury in 1917.Church of England, Parish of St. Mary Aldermanbury. ‚Äì Papers relating to the amalgamation of the parishes of St Mary Aldermanbury, 1893. ‚Äì M0001898CL cited in City of London Parish Registers Guide 4 Hallows,A.(Ed): London, Guildhall Library Research, 1974 The church was rebuilt in 1919, but was scheduled for demolition in the same year.History of the Church and Parish of St Alphage, London Wall Carter, P.C: London, W.H & L Collingridge,1925 The bells went to St Peter‚Äôs Acton.The Times, Thursday, Jul 24, 1919; pg. 7; Issue 42160; col D The nave was demolished in 1923, leaving the tower and the porch. Until the Second World War, the tower was maintained with an altar and chairs as a place for prayer. The tower was gutted by fire in 1940. The City of London Corporation began to redevelop the badly bombed area in 1958, as part of the new Barbican complex. In the course of the development, the early twentieth-century north porch and the upper levels of the tower were removed. During 2018 and 2019 as part of a program to install a raised walkway the remaining parts of the church tower and area around it were renewed to form a central feature in a new plaza named London Wall Place & St Alphage Gardens. The restored tower viewed from pedestrian walkway. A plaque from the churchyard's conversion to a public garden in 1872. The remains of the church were designated a Grade II listed structure on 4 January 1950. The surviving remnants of these consist of the ruin of a central tower, built of flint and rubble masonry, with arches on three sides; the south wall is missing.

Common sources of secondary data for social science include censuses, information collected by government departments, organizational records and data that was originally collected for other research purposes. Primary data, by contrast, are collected by the investigator conducting the research. Secondary data analysis can save time that would otherwise be spent collecting data and, particularly in the case of quantitative data, can provide larger and higher-quality databases that would be unfeasible for any individual researcher to collect on their own. In addition, analysts of social and economic change consider secondary data essential, since it is impossible to conduct a new survey that can adequately capture past change and/or developments. However, secondary data analysis can be less useful in marketing research, as data may be outdated or inaccurate. Sources of secondary data Secondary data can be obtained from different sources: * information collected through censuses or government departments like housing, social security, electoral statistics, tax records * internet searches or libraries *GPS, remote sensing * km progress reports Administrative data and census Government departments and agencies routinely collect information when registering people or carrying out transactions, or for record keeping ‚Äì usually when delivering a service. This information is called administrative data. It can include: * personal information such as names, dates of birth, addresses * information about schools and educational achievements * information about health * information about criminal convictions or prison sentences * tax records, such as income A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. It is a type of administrative data, but it is collected for the purpose of research at specific intervals. Most administrative data is collected continuously and for the purpose of delivering a service to the people. Advantages and disadvantages of secondary data Secondary data is available from other sources and may already have been used in previous research, making it easier to carry out further research. It is time-saving and cost-efficient: the data was collected by someone other than the researcher. Administrative data and census data may cover both larger and much smaller samples of the population in detail. Information collected by the government will also cover parts of the population that may be less likely to respond to the census (in countries where this is optional). A clear benefit of using secondary data is that much of the background work needed has already been carried out, such as literature reviews or case studies. The data may have been used in published texts and statistics elsewhere, and the data could already be promoted in the media or bring in useful personal contacts. Secondary data generally have a pre- established degree of validity and reliability which need not be re-examined by the researcher who is re-using such data. Secondary data is key in the concept of data enrichment, which is where datasets from secondary sources are connected to a research dataset to improve its precision by adding key attributes and values. Secondary data can provide a baseline for primary research to compare the collected primary data results to and it can also be helpful in research design. However, secondary data can present problems, too. The data may be out of date or inaccurate. If using data collected for different research purposes, it may not cover those samples of the population researchers want to examine, or not in sufficient detail. Administrative data, which is not originally collected for research, may not be available in the usual research formats or may be difficult to get access to. Secondary analysis or re-use of qualitative data While 'secondary data' is associated with quantitative databases, analysis focused on verbal or visual materials created for another purpose, is a legitimate avenue for the qualitative researcher. Actually one could go as far as claim that qualitative secondary data analysis ‚Äúcan be understood, not so much as the analysis of pre-existing data; rather as involving a process of re-contextualizing, and re- constructing, data.‚ÄùMoore, N.

He helped Jackie Wilson, Buddy Holly, Bobby Darin and others early in their careers in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Life and career Jacobs was born in New York City, United States, and graduated from New York University. During World War II he served in the United States Army, then returned to the city and spent several years arranging for Tommy Dorsey, then partnered with Sy Oliver to pursue freelance arranging work. When he was hired to be the musical director for the television series, Your Hit Parade, for its 1957-58 season, he replaced most of the existing studio orchestra members with his own choices including Dick Hyman, Don Lamond, Al Caiola and Jerome Richardson. At that point, the Hit Parade orchestra became one of the first on-screen orchestras to become integrated. In 1953 he produced a number of acts, including the McGuire Sisters and Teresa Brewer, and by 1958 had a hit single, the theme tune from the movie Kathy-O. In 1956 his recording of \\"Man with the Golden Arm\\" sold over one million copies as a single and was awarded a gold disc. According to The Ultimate Book of Songs and Artists, by Joel Whitburn, Jacobs's biggest hits were \\"Main Title\\" and \\"Molly-O\\" (1956), \\"Petticoats of Portugal\\" (1956), and \\"Fascination\\" (1957). Jacobs brought a lush instrumental orchestral sound to a number of rock and roll songs in the late 1950s, notably those for Buddy Holly and Cirino Colacrai and his vocal quartet, the Bowties. Eventually retiring in the late 1970s, he wrote Who Wrote That Song?, a reference book on popular songs and songwriters. He died in 1988 in New York City, at the age of 70.

As of September 20, 2007, it is on UNESCO's Memory of the World list. The codex, written at the end or even in the middle of the 10th century, contains a menaion for the month of March, intersecting with the movable cycle of Easter. It also contains 24 lives of saints, 23 homilies and one prayer, most of which were written by or are attributed to John Chrysostom. The 284-folio (or 285-folio, according to some sources) codex was \\"discovered\\" in 1823 by Canon Micha≈Ç Bobrowski in the Uniate Basilian monastery in Supra≈õl. In 1838, Bobrowski sent the last part of the manuscript in two pieces to Slovene philologist Jernej Kopitar so that he could transcribe it. After Kopitar returned it, Bobrowski sent him the first part (118 folios), however for unknown reason it was never returned to Bobrowski and was found in 1845 among the documents of the deceased Kopitar. It was later kept by the Ljubljana Lyceum and now by the National and University Library of Slovenia in Ljubljana. The largest part was bought for the private library of the Zamoyski family in Warsaw. This part of the codex disappeared during World War II, but later resurfaced in the United States and was returned by Herbert Moeller to Poland in 1968, where it has been held by the National Library of Poland in Warsaw until the present day. The third part, consisting of 16 folios, is held by the Russian National Library in Saint Petersburg. The codex was published by Franz Miklosich (Vienna, 1851), Sergej Severjanov (Suprasal—åskaja rukopis—å, Saint Petersburg, 1904), and Jordan Zaimov and Mario Capaldo (Sophia, 1982‚Äì1983). Alfons Margulies produced a significant volume on the codex titled Der altkirchenslavische Codex Suprasliensis (Heidelberg, 1927). Folio 260 of the manuscript contains the note g(ospod)i pomilui ret—äka amin. Some experts think ret—äka represents the name of a scribe (hence the occasional name Codex of Retko) and that the text was copied from several sources. Research indicates that at least one of the sources may have Glagolitic (for Epiphanius' Homily on the Entombment). Vocalizations of yers, rarely occurring epenthesis, change of —ä to —å behind hardened ƒç, ≈æ, ≈° and some other linguistic traits point to its (Eastern) Bulgarian linguistic provenance.

It is the UK's Open University's contribution to the Open educational resources (OER) project and the home of free, open learning from The Open University. The original project was part- funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.\\"Our story ‚Äì How OpenLearn started\\" ‚Äì Open University OpenLearn is a member of the OpenCourseWare Consortium (OCWC).Open Education Consortium Members History OpenLearn dates back to 1999, when Open2.net, an Open University-BBC collaboration, gave a first home to free learning resources that the public could interact with without the need to sign up to study a university course. The Open University launched the OpenLearn brand with the LearningSpace website in October 2006 to provide free access to extracts of educational materials generated as part of course production. The publication of such structured learning materials, designed for distance education, is unique in the field of open educational resources. LearningSpace and Open2.net came together under the same OpenLearn brand in 2010, creating a single home for all free learning from The Open University. It also aggregates videos and audio made available via other Open University channels, such as iTunesU, YouTube and AudioBoo. Since 2014, it has also been republishing The Open University's courses from FutureLearn, providing a space where learners unwilling or unable to commit to FutureLearn's weekly learning model can follow courses to their own timetable. Fundamentals of the program Open Education materials make three contributions. They make new knowledge available to all (not just the few who can pay for it). They allow users to download, modify, translate and adapt to their culture to the material to enhance its usefulness. They provide the opportunity for people to work together to co-modify, co-produce, test and co- produce again, retesting derivative material which generates a cycle of rapid continuous improvement. Using technology Open Educational Resources aim to remove access barriers to knowledge and educational opportunities around the world. Through the Moodle-based virtual learning environment, learners are offered over 1000 structured media-rich study units, supported by a number of learning and communication tools in the Free Courses area. Personal profiles, learning journals and rating options empower learners to become self publishers and reviewers, tagging their entries to provide a means by which others can find and connect with their ideas. Knowledge mapping software enables learners to visually represent resources and the links between them, to construct arguments and frame debates. By publishing their work online, they share their own pathways through the material with other visitors to the website. The OpenLearn website also provides a standalone experience for the learner, but is also one that can be taken apart and remixed to take on a new form. The Web 2.0 approach to an open and collaborative LearningSpace primarily for learners, is complemented by OpenLearn Create(formerly Labspace and OpenLearnWorks), an area for experimentation, where educational practitioners are encouraged to download, amend and adapt both current and archived course materials. Published under an Attribution-ShareAlike- NonCommercial Creative Commons license, the Open University media-rich materials can be reused in alternative educational settings, repurposed for a local context, translated and built upon to form a larger open repository of derivative educational materials. Collaborators are encouraged to form their own areas within the LabSpace to personalise the materials, increasing the relevance of the content for specific learning communities and to test out course ideas and develop materials based on user feedback. Viral content OpenLearn enables viral content not just through its licensing model, but also through a commitment to open technologies. The use of an open source virtual learning environment, along with the ability for people to download and upload materials in various formats (from an RSS to a print to an IMS Common Cartridge) encourages replication of the content and enables interoperability with other provider's content management systems. Innovators have already re- published OpenLearn materials in new environments by implementing a variety of freely available technologies. The materials have been replicated in offline desktop libraries to provide access for remote communities around the world. RSS feeds enable the content to be easily embedded in web based widgets and RSS readers, allowing the engagement with the content to happen away from OpenLearn. OpenLearn Create By the end of the first phase of funding (30 April 2008), OpenLearn hosted more than five thousand hours of core OU materials and additional user generated content in the LabSpace area of the site. In 2012, the LabSpace area was overhauled to give a better user experience and a tighter focus on collaboration with partners. The area was rebranded OpenLearn Works. The site has since been further developed and redesigned, changing its name to OpenLearn Create in 2017.

There are four difficulty levels: Amateur, Professional, Legend and Extreme. Total Immersion Racing was released for the Mac OS X by Feral Interactive in 2003. Game modes Single Race: Race on any unlocked track with any unlocked car. One lap to twenty-five can be raced and the time of day can be changed to either Evening or Day (on most tracks). Career: Start in a low power GT car and rise through the ranks to win the PRO category championship and unlock cars and tracks. Time Trial: Get best lap times on any track with any car. Challenge: Complete thirty seven different challenges under five classes: GT, GTS, PRO, Manufacturer and Endurance. A list of all the challenges can be found below. Cars There are a total of seventeen cars divided into three groups (GT, GTS and PRO (prototype)): Challenges The challenges have to be completed in order, with completion of #1 unlocking #2 and so on. With each race the player accumulates points for their finishing position (10 for a win), which contribute to a championship score. Failure to win the championship will constitute failure of the challenge. The challenges may be one-car specific or may allow the choice of several or all cars from a single class. Completing challenges unlocks cars and tracks for use in single and multi-player as well a time trial use. Generally, 'manufacturer' challenges (where specific cars are unlocked) are separated by one or two general challenges (mostly allowing use of any unlocked car from the class of the previously unlocked vehicle). Winning races on tracks not previously raced on will unlock them, since not all tracks are available for racing from the start. Each challenges includes anywhere from 1 to 8 separate races, each of between 1 and 50 laps. For challenge racing, there are no difficulty settings, with the difficulty ramping up as the player moves through them.

A native of Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico, she rose to prominence during the Mexican Revolution as a Socialist activist and reformer and as a supporter and associate of General Emiliano Zapata. Biography Dolores Jim√©nez y Muro was born June 7, 1848, in Aguascalientes, Mexico, but while young her family moved San Luis Potos√≠. She grew up in the upper middle class of San Luis Potos√≠, where her father was a senior government official. The family had many liberal friends and from her childhood Jim√©nez was exposed to foreign and liberal ideas. She had no formal schooling, studying at home, but was encouraged to pursue her talent for poetry. In 1874, she was invited by the state government to read her poems at an official celebration of the September independence festivals. These poems were later collected into a book and published as Un rayo de luz (A Ray of Light). In 1883 Jim√©nez lost both of her parents and she began teaching school. She became aware of how easily one could fall into poverty or become exploited. Pre-Revolutionary radicalism Dolores Jim√©nez published in La Esmeralda and La Sombra de Zaragoza and by 1902 had become the director of La Potosina Magazine. She continued to teach in the rural school system until 1904, when she moved to Mexico City. She published articles against the regime of Porfirio D√≠az and was arrested. In prison, she met Elisa Acu√±a Rossetti, Juana Bel√©n Guti√©rrez de Mendoza, and In√©s Malv√°ez. From prison, the woman began publishing a radical journal, Fiat Lux. In 1905, she joined the staff of the La Mujer Mexicana (Mexican Women) for whom she worked until 1908. She also published articles in Diario del Hogar (Newspaper of the Home). In 1907, Acu√±a, Bel√©n and Jim√©nez y Muro founded the \\"Daughters of Anahuac\\", a group of about three hundred libertarian women, who demanded improved working conditions for women and advocated labor strikes. In 1908, Jim√©nez founded, with Acu√±a, Bel√©n, and Jose Edilberto Pinelo, a worker's organization in Mexico City called \\"Mexican Socialism.\\" They continued to publish the newspaper Fiat Lux, as the voice of an organization called the Mutual Society for Women. In 1910, Jim√©nez and others founded the Club Femenil Antirreeleccionista Hijas de Cuauht√©moc (Anti-Reelectionist Women's Club: Daughters of Cuauht√©moc). The club, including members Mercedes Arvides and Julia Nava de Ruis√°nchez staged a demonstration in Mexico City on 11 September 1910 protesting election fraud. These activities and a failed attempt at rebellion by supporters of Arriaga resulted in the arrest of Jim√©nez, Acu√±a, Bel√©n, and Mar√≠a Dolores Malv√°es and their imprisonment at San Juan de Ul√∫a fortress in the Gulf of Mexico. Revolutionary radicalism In prison in 1911, Dolores Jim√©nez continued to be politically active in jail and founded Regeneraci√≥n y Concordia. Through this she sought to further the changes that she desired to see in Mexico. She envisioned a country where there were significant improvements to the economy and land reforms. She also wanted changes to improve the living conditions of women and indigenous people. Regeneraci√≥n y Concordia had feminist aims which her partners, Acu√±a, Bel√©n and Sara Estela Ram√≠rez joined her work. In March, 1911, Francisco I. Madero called for demonstrations in Guerrero, Michoacan, Tlaxcala, Puebla and Campeche, and Jim√©nez organized the protests. She was a notable contributor to the Complot de Tacubaya, which sought to depose President Porfirio D√≠az in favor of Francisco I. Madero. She is credited with writing \\"The Political and Social Plan\\", published on March 18, 1911, which outlined the ideas and aims of the conspirators. The \\"Plan\\" advocated a continuation of the demands the Mexican Liberal Party had made in 1906, including fair wages, affordable housing, improved working conditions, and curbs on foreign investment. It also promoted the decentralization of the country's education system, on the premise that a school's needs are best met when it is locally funded and controlled. Unlike earlier revolutionary theorists, however, Jim√©nez insisted that wage should be increased for women as well as for men. She also insisted that foreign firms operating in Mexico should be required to have at least half of their workforce made up of Mexicans. After the plan was read in Mexico City on 31 October 1911, interim president Francisco Le√≥n de la Barra had Jim√©nez arrested. In spite of her age, (she was in her 60s and most of her compatriot revolutionaries were in their 20s), she was refused release until she staged a hunger strike. She realized that Madero was not a supporter of the radical reforms she supported and switched her loyalty to Emiliano Zapata. In 1913, she joined the Zapatista forces and developed the prologue to the Plan de Ayala. She directed the newspaper La voz de Ju√°rez from which denounced the coup led by Victoriano Huerta to overthrow Madero. Zapata appointed her to a position of brigadier general but that was insufficient to prevent an eleven-month imprisonment ordered in 1914 by Huerta. She was released from prison and rejoined Zapata until his assassination in 1919. Post-revolution Between 1921 and 1924, Jim√©nez worked in the Secretary of Education's Cultural Missions program. She died on October 15, 1925, in Mexico City, at the age of 75. Selected works *Un rayo de luz *Al inmortal Hidalgo *En el Aniversario Published in The Shadow of Zaragoza.

Early life and education Rosenthal was born to a Jewish family in Philadelphia. He holds a Doctor of Arts degree from the University of the Pacific. Screenwriting career Rosenthal sold the first screenplay he wrote, which came out theatrically as The Legend of Billie Jean. This was followed by such films as The Jewel of the Nile, The Beverly Hillbillies, Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, Mona Lisa Smile, Mighty Joe Young and The Sorcerer's Apprentice. He also did uncredited work on I, Robot and Eragon. Rosenthal co-wrote (with Konner) and directed The In Crowd for Orion Studios. Other appearances  Rosenthal is a voting member of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences. and was featured in the documentaries Tales From The Script: 50 Hollywood Screenwriters Share Their Stories and Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films , where he details his experiences working on Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.  Superman IV: The Quest for Peace  Rosenthal recorded a DVD commentary for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace for the Deluxe Edition of the film in 2006. He discussed the film's original intentions and deleted scenes. Rosenthal has also described the final film as production company Cannon Films stabbing star Christopher Reeve in the back. According to Rosenthal, Reeve and director Sidney J. Furie begged Cannon Films to film a sequence in New York City, in front of the real United Nations Building, because filmgoers were very familiar with that location, but the Milton Keynes setting looked more like a municipal auditorium. However, Cannon refused because they were \\"pinching pennies at every step\\". Rosenthal also revealed that he and writer Lawrence Konner wanted Reeve to play Nuclear Man as well as his dual roles of Superman and Clark Kent in the film. They imagined the villain being a darker version of the hero in the cloning process. The effect would have been costly to achieve and the idea had already been explored in Superman III. Therefore, Cannon hired actor Mark Pillow for the part of Nuclear Man. Also according to Rosenthal, there are approximately 45 minutes of the film that have not been seen by the public after they were deleted, following a failed Southern California test screening.

The story follows the head of production at a Hollywood studio who wants to make a movie to fulfill a promise made to a dying friend. The film was written by Charles Grodin, who also appears in the movie. The cast includes Tyne Daly, Gilda Radner, and Vincent Gardenia. Steve Martin makes a cameo appearance as Fabio Longio. Plot Hollywood studio mogul Joe Mulholland (Matthau) vows to produce the pet project of a dying acquaintance, who has been trying to find a way to make a film out of a best-selling sex manual. He and screenwriter Herb Derman (Grodin) try to make it happen, but fail in every possible way. Meanwhile, Herb is distracted by his own marital problems. Cast * Walter Matthau as Joe Mulholland * Charles Grodin as Herb Derman * Vincent Gardenia as Saul Gritz * Tyne Daly as Nancy Derman * Gilda Radner as Livia * Steve Martin as Fabio Production Charles Grodin recounted the making of this film in his autobiography, It Would Be So Nice if You Weren't Here: in the mid-1970s, Paramount Pictures paid a great amount of money to secure the rights to Alex Comfort's sex manual The Joy of Sex just so it could use the title, which studio executives thought to be highly commercial. In 1978, they hired Grodin to write a script, telling him the movie \\"could be about anything.\\" Grodin decided to use this exact situation as the premise: a Hollywood writer struggles to write a script based on a sex manual after a big studio acquires the rights. When he finished his first draft, the studio passed and eventually released National Lampoon's Joy of Sex in 1984. After Paramount put Grodin's script in turnaround in 1978, he was free to offer it to other studios. However, since Paramount held the rights to the title The Joy of Sex, the film was retitled Dreamers. Columbia Pictures showed interest in producing it with Peter Falk playing the leading role of the producer. But when the deal with Columbia fell through, Grodin ended up pitching his screenplay to every studio several times over the course of the next seven years. Eventually, director William Asher agreed to make it with a budget of two million dollars if people would defer salaries. This is why Grodin and Asher share a producers credit on the finished film. Grodin persuaded some of his actor friends to become involved. He, Steve Martin, Gilda Radner, Penny Marshall and Tyne Daly all agreed to work for the least amount of money the union allowed. Martin did so without even reading the script. When the film was finally green-lit, Grodin received no salary for writing or producing it, only the minimum for working five weeks as an actor: about $5,000 for two years of work (seven years in total since the inception of the project). When the film was finally ready to go in front of the cameras, original lead actor Peter Falk was no longer available. Another well-known comic actor had to drop out when he didn't pass his insurance physical. Walter Matthau agreed to star at the very last minute, receiving $1 million, half his usual fee at the time for his work. Following not very successful preview screenings, the son of MGM exec Greg Morrison suggested to add narration by Grodin to the picture. MGM initially refused to pay for the picture nor release it, because \\"it was not of first-class technical quality\\" and \\"does not reflect the screenplay.\\" The film finally got a limited release in several large cities across America. However, because of its small budget ($3.5 million) and all-star cast, it was expected to make money for MGM on video cassette, cable, regular television and foreign sales. Years later, on a depression-themed episode of his talk show, Grodin would cite the failure of this film (along with the subsequent death of his father) with putting him into a long period of depression.

A ballplayer in the Chicago semi-pro leagues, often for the Inland Steel Mill team, James Stanley (the name he played under) briefly played for Danville in the 3-I League in 1910, hired by Danville's manager Jack McCarthy, an old Chicago baseball player. Stanley was released in May, having played fewer than 10 games. In 1911 he played 3rd base for the Seward Statesmen of the Nebraska League, batting .244 in 60 games. In 1912 he returned to Chicago, playing 3rd, right field and shortstop for the semi-pro Chicago Green Sox, batting .252 in 33 games. In 1913 he played the infield for the Chicago Keeleys of the semi-pro Federal League, batting .256 through the end of August. An injury (a broken bone in his ankle) curtailed his season. In 1914 the Chicago Whales signed him to be a utility infielder. The 5-6, 148 pound Stanley, nicknamed \\"Honus\\" after Hall of Famer Honus Wagner, batted .194 in limited duty. After his major league stint, he played for the Youngstown (Ohio) Steelmen (1915). In 1916 his old manager, Joe Tinker, signed him to play 3rd base for the Peoria Distillers, though it appears he never played for them. That year he moved to Michigan City, IN to work as a crane operator there, and played for his company team. In 1918 he was back in South Chicago (a neighborhood near the old Chicago steel mills) playing semi-pro ball.Chicago Examiner, April 25, 1918. By 1925 was working for the Michigan City fire department.

YMS 45 was laid down on 20 June 1941 at Brooklyn, New York, by the Wheeler Shipbuilding Corp.; launched on 20 April 1942; and commissioned on 8 June 1942, Lt.(jg.) LeRoy E. Rogers, Jr., USNR, in command.  World War II service  After trials and outfitting, the motor minesweeper reported for duty to the Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier. On 31 August, she departed Norfolk, Virginia, in company with YMS-44, bound for Bermuda. The ship operated as an escort vessel in the West Indies through the end of the war in Europe. She was based at Bermuda until 4 October 1943 when she and YMS 44 moved to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On 6 June 1945, YMS-45 headed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, and arrived at Norfolk on the 11th.  Transfer to Pacific Fleet  She stood out to sea again on 18 July as an element of Task Unit (TU) 29.01, bound for the Pacific Ocean. The motor minesweeper transited the Panama Canal between 29 July and 1 August and reached San Pedro, California, on 13 August. From that port, she shifted south to San Diego, California, where she remained for seven weeks.  End-of-war operations  On 1 October, YMS-45 put to sea and shaped a course for Oahu. The warship entered Pearl Harbor on the 13th and operated in Hawaiian waters until 1 December when, in company with four other motor minesweepers, she got underway for the Ryukyu Islands. She and her colleagues arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 20 December and conducted minesweeping operations in those waters for about a month. After a three-week visit to Sasebo, Japan, in February 1946, the warship returned home via Pearl Harbor. She reached San Francisco, California, on 28 March and remained there until 13 June. On that day, the ship headed south with task unit TU 99.12.9. Steaming by way of San Diego, she arrived in the Panama Canal Zone on 28 June. She entered port at New York on 12 July and was decommissioned there on 5 August 1946.  Naval Reserve training ship  The minesweeper remained in reserve until 13 January 1947 when she was placed in service as a school ship for reservists of the 3d Naval District. On 19 August 1947, YMS 45 was named Barbet and redesignated AMS 41.  Reactivation during Korean War  On 11 May 1950, the warship was placed in commission, in reserve. On 21 November 1950, she was placed in full commission. The minesweeper continued to serve as a school ship for New York reservists until early in 1952 when she was reassigned to Mine Squadron (MinRon) 4 and to the Mine Countermeasures Station at Panama City, Florida. That duty, punctuated by repair periods at various locations along the U.S. East Coast, filled the remainder of her active career.  Final decommissioning  Barbet was redesignated MSC0-41 on 7 February 1955; but, on 18 April 1955, she began inactivation preparations at Green Cove Springs, Florida. She was decommissioned at that port on 17 June 1955 and remained in reserve there for a little more than four years. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 November 1960. Details regarding her ultimate disposition are unavailable, but, presumably, she was scrapped.  Military awards and honors  Barbet (AMS-41) earned one battle star as YMS-45 for her role in the postwar minesweeping performed off Okinawa and in Japanese waters.

These fortifications later served to protect commercial routes and as centers for isolated Muslim communities as well as serving as places of piety. The word ribat in its abstract refers to voluntary defense of Islam, which is why ribats were originally used to house those who fought to defend Islam in jihad. They can also be referred to by other names such as khanqah, most commonly used in Iran, and tekke, most commonly used in Turkey. Classically, ribat referred to the guard duty at a frontier outpost in order to defend dar al-Islam. The one who performs ribat is called a murabit. Contemporary use of the term ribat is common among jihadi groups such as al-Qaeda or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The term has also been used by Salafi jihadis operating in the Gaza Strip. In their terminology,  ªAr·∏ç al-Ribat \\"Land of the Ribat\\" is a name for Palestine, meaning it is a place of conquest and jihad.‚ÄúRadical Islam In Gaza‚Äù, International Crisis Group, Middle East Report N¬∞104, 29 March 2011, p. 7; see also note 61 (PDF).https://www.ecoi.net/en/file/local/1059351/1226_1301926747_104-20radical-20islam-20in-20gaza.pdf  As a fortress  In time, ribats became hostels for voyagers on major trade routes (caravanserai) and refuges for mystics. In this last sense, the ribat tradition was perhaps one of the early sources of the Sufi mystic brotherhoods, and a type of the later zawiya or Sufi lodge, which spread into North Africa, and from there across the Sahara to West Africa. Here the homes of marabouts (religious teachers, usually Sufi) are termed ribats. Such places of spiritual retreat were termed KhƒÅnqƒÅh (). Some important ribats to mention are the Rabati Malik (c.1068‚Äì80) which is located in the desert of central Asia and is still partially intact and the Ribat-i Sharaf from the 12th century which was built in a square shape with a monumental portal, a courtyard, and long vaulted rooms along the walls. Most ribats had a similar architectural appearance which consisted of a surrounding wall with an entrance, living rooms, storehouses for provisions, a watch tower used to signal in the case of an invasion, four to eight towers, and a mosque in large ribats.  Sufism  Ribat was originally used as a term to describe a frontier post where travelers (particularly soldiers) could stay. The term transformed over time to become known as a center for Sufi fraternities. The ribats were converted to a peaceful use where Sufis could congregate. Usually the ribats were inhabited by a shaykh and his family and visitors were allowed to come and learn from him. Many times the tomb of the founder was also located in the same building. The institutionalization of these centers was made possible in part through donations from wealthy merchants, landowners, and powerful leaders. Some of these compounds also received regular stipends to maintain them. These institutions were used as a sort of school house where a shaykh could teach his disciples the ways of the specific ·π≠arƒ´qah (, Sufi brotherhood or fraternity). They were also used as a place of worship where the shaykh could observe the members of the specific Sufi order and help them on their inner path to ·∏•aqƒ´qah (, Ultimate truth or reality). Another use of ribat refers to a sort of convent or retreat house for Sufi women. Female shaykhas (ÿ¥ŸäÿÆÿ©), scholars of law in medieval times, and large numbers of widows or divorcees lived in abstinence and worship in ribats. Some of these women stayed in the ribats until they were able to remarry in an effort to maintain their reputation because divorced women were not widely accepted in Islamic society.

East Sussex is divided into five local government districts. Three are larger, rural, districts (from west to east: Lewes; Wealden; and Rother). The other two, Eastbourne and Hastings, are mainly urban areas. The rural districts are subdivided into civil parishes.See List of civil parishes in East Sussex The County Council meets at East Sussex County Hall, the authority's headquarters; there are a number of other administrative buildings located throughout the county.  History  Sussex was historically divided into six sub-divisions known as rapes. From the 12th century the three eastern rapes and the three western rapes had separate quarter sessions: the county town of the three eastern rapes was Lewes. This position was formalised by Parliament in 1865, and the two parts were made into administrative counties, each with distinct elected county councils, in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888. Within East Sussex there were also three self- administered county boroughs: Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings. In 1974 East Sussex was made a non-metropolitan county, and the three county boroughs became districts within the county. At the same time the western boundary was altered, so that the Mid Sussex area (including Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath) was transferred to the county of West Sussex. In 1997, Brighton and Hove became a self-administered unitary authority; it was granted city status in 2000, whilst remaining part of the ceremonial county of East Sussex.  Elections  In common with all shire counties, the whole of East Sussex County Council is elected every four years. The first election to the reconstituted council took place in 1973, to prepare for the handover of services in April 1974. The 1997 election was the first at which no representatives from Brighton and Hove were elected, as a result of that area acquiring a unitary council. The Conservative Party has always held the largest number of seats on the council, though among the existing divisions of the council (excluding wards from Brighton & Hove), in 1993 the Liberal Democrats won 23 of the 44 seats, which would on current boundaries have given them overall control.Local Elections Handbook 1993 Since the removal of Brighton and Hove, the Labour Party influence has been reduced although the party retains the majority of seats in Hastings. An election was held in May 2013. The UK Independence Party made gains here as elsewhere in the rural parts of England where elections were held. There was a more recent election in 2017.

The series was created and produced by Herb Meadow. Overview In The Man From Blackhawk, Rockwell plays Sam Logan, an insurance investigator from the Blackhawk Insurance Company. Logan scours the West investigating claims, verifying their accuracy, and seeking to root out fraud and dishonesty. Unlike most of his Western counterparts, Logan dresses like a dude with a suit and a drawstring tie instead of classic cowboy wear. He is also more inclined to use his fists than a gun. Apparently designed to take advantage of the popularity of private eye television series, such as Richard Diamond, Private Detective and 77 Sunset Strip, The Man From Blackhawk was a Screen Gems production. Beverly Garland is cast as Sarah Marshall, with Richard Rust as George Blackburn, in \\"Logan's Policy\\", the series premiere (October 9, 1959).

They were endemic to North America and Eurasia during the Early Paleocene to the Early Oligocene, and were the earliest group of large carnivorous mammals in Asia. They are not closely related to any living animals. Mesonychid taxonomy has long been disputed and they have captured popular imagination as \\"wolves on hooves,\\" animals that combine features of both ungulates and carnivores. Skulls and teeth have similar features to early whales, and the family was long thought to be the ancestors of cetaceans. Recent fossil discoveries have overturned this idea; the consensus is that whales are highly derived artiodactyls. Some researchers now consider the family a sister group either to whales or to artiodactyls, close relatives rather than direct ancestors. Other studies define Mesonychia as basal to all ungulates, occupying a position between Perissodactyla and Ferae. In this case, the resemblances to early whales would be due to convergent evolution among ungulate-like herbivores that developed adaptations related to hunting or eating meat.  Description  The mesonychids were an unusual group of condylarths with a specialized dentition featuring tri-cuspid upper molars and high-crowned lower molars with shearing surfaces. They had large heads with relatively long necks. Over time, the family evolved foot and leg adaptations for faster running, and jaw adaptations for greater bite force. Like the Paleocene family Arctocyonidae, mesonychids were once viewed as primitive carnivorans, and the diet of most genera probably included meat or fish. Various genera and species coexisted in some locations, as hunters and omnivores or scavengers. In contrast to arctocyonids, the mesonychids had only four digits furnished with hooves supported by narrow fissured end phalanges.  Evolutionary history  They first appeared in the Early Paleocene, undergoing numerous speciation events during the Paleocene, and Eocene. Mesonychids fared very poorly at the close of the Eocene epoch, with only one genus, Mongolestes, surviving into the Early Oligocene epoch. Restoration of Mesonyx Mesonychids probably originated in Asia, where the most primitive mesonychid, Yangtanglestes, is known from the early Paleocene. They were also most diverse in Asia where they occur in all major Paleocene faunas. Since other carnivores such as the creodonts and Carnivora were either rare or absent in these animal communities, mesonychids most likely dominated the large predator niche in the Paleocene of Asia. Throughout the Paleocene and Eocene, several genera, including Dissacus, Pachyaena and Mesonyx would radiate out from their ancestral home in Asia and into Europe and North America, where they would give rise to new mesonychid genera. These animals would have migrated to North America via the Bering land bridge. The term \\"mesonychid\\" is often used to refer to any of the various members of the order Mesonychia, though most experts prefer to use it to refer to the members of the family Mesonychidae, with many experts using the term \\"mesonychian\\" to refer to the order as a whole. Taxonomy Mesonychidae was named by Cope (1880). Its type genus is Mesonyx. It was assigned to Creodonta by Cope (1880); to Creodonta by Cope (1889); to Carnivora by Peterson (1919); to Mesonychia by Carroll (1988) and Zhou et al. (1995); and to Cete by Archibald (1998);J.

Goluboy shchenok, alternative translations - Pale Blue Puppy/Slate puppy) is a 1976 Soviet animated film. The lyrics and screenplay were written by Yuri Entin, loosely based on the tale by Gyula Urban. Several quotes from the film's lyrics became common colloquial sayings, for example, \\"What trouble can we stir up?\\" and \\"Ah, how I'm angry, ooh, how I'm angry!\\" voiced by Mikhail Boyarsky, and the phrase \\"One ought to live skilfully.\\" The film was unique in utilizing a non-traditional animation technique where spots of colorful India ink were used to form the characters. This gave a great deal of plasticity to the animated characters. For example, the Black Cat would vanish from the foreground only to reappear immediately in the back, or the evil Pirate would transform into a thundercloud by inflating himself with his own malice.  Plot  A puppy, who is strangely born with a coat that is a shade of light blue, is rejected by all. Nobody wants to play with him or to be his friend. Even the Grey Dogs avoid him. The Black Cat, a dodger and a faker, is the only one that feigns interest. Unexpectedly, the Pirate attacks the island and using the Black Cat, kidnaps the Blue Puppy. Along comes the Good Sailor, who always helps ones in trouble and does good things. As the Sailor sails the sea, the Black Cat tells him about the abduction of the Puppy. The Sailor decides to rescue the puppy and begins chasing the Pirate; the Pirate eventually attacks the Seaman with a sawfish which sinks the Sailor's ship. The Pirate ties the Seaman and the Puppy together with shackles, but the Puppy manages to free both himself and the Sailor. Meanwhile, the Pirate and the Black Cat are celebrating their victory and sing a song about their spurious friendship. Their celebration is cut short, however, as the Seaman confronts and defeats the Pirate. He and the Puppy return to the island as heroes. Now, nobody tries to avoid the Puppy. More importantly, however, the Puppy now has a real friend. The moral of the story is that it is not so awful to be different from others, as long as one has friends, and the respect of one's peers.  Publications  Since its inception, the tale was published many times by Melody on vinyl records and, later, on a CD. The soundtrack includes not only the film songs, but also the plot narration in rhyme. Some singles from the soundtrack are included in special children audio-collections. At the end of the 1990s, the tale was reborn on the theater stage. Plays loosely based on the film were staged at the St. Petersburg Marionette Theater and at the Moscow Chamber Music Puppet Theater. A musical version has also appeared at a Krasnoyarsk night club. A computer video-game Birthday of the Blue Puppy was released by Fargus.  Ambiguous meaning of the tale  In the early 1990s, Yuri Entin was under constant pressure over his film. This is because the word goluboy (blue) is the modern Russian slang term for gay. This misconception was helped along by some of the quotes from the songs in the movie, for example, when the Blue Puppy is teased by the other dogs: \\"You are blue! You are blue! We don't want to play with you!\\" or in the subsequent song by the Puppy, which has the line, \\"I am hurt by an evil fate, oh, why am I blue?\\" However, the additional connotation to the Russian word \\"blue\\" is a recent phenomenon, and writer Yuri Entin has pointed out that he never thought of such an association in 1976, when the film was made. In the original work of the Hungarian writer, Gyula Urban, the Puppy was black, but in the Soviet tale, Entin wanted the Puppy to be a non-traditional color.

Most of the protocols described by this early version are rarely used today. Description It specified two raw data rates of 1 and 2 megabits per second (Mbit/s) to be transmitted via infrared (IR) signals or by either frequency hopping or direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) in the Industrial Scientific Medical frequency band at 2.4 GHz. IR remains a part of the standard but has no actual implementations. The original standard also defines carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) as the medium access method. A significant percentage of the available raw channel capacity is sacrificed (via the CSMA/CA mechanisms) in order to improve the reliability of data transmissions under diverse and adverse environmental conditions. IEEE 802.11-1999 also introduced the binary time unit TU defined as 1024 ¬µs. At least six different, somewhat-interoperable, commercial products appeared using the original specification, from companies like Alvarion (PRO.11 and BreezeAccess-II), BreezeCom, Digital / Cabletron (RoamAbout), Lucent, Netwave Technologies (AirSurfer Plus and AirSurfer Pro), Symbol Technologies (Spectrum24), and Proxim Wireless (OpenAir and Rangelan2). A weakness of this original specification was that it offered so many choices that interoperability was sometimes challenging to realize. It is really more of a \\"beta-specification\\" than a rigid specification, initially allowing individual product vendors the flexibility to differentiate their products but with little to no inter-vendor operability. The DSSS version of legacy 802.11 was rapidly supplemented (and popularized) by the 802.11b amendment in 1999, which increased the bit rate to 11 Mbit/s. Widespread adoption of 802.11 networks only occurred after the release of 802.11b which resulted in multiple interoperable products becoming available from multiple vendors. Consequently comparatively few networks were implemented on the 802.11-1997 standard.

Chaitivel is the tenth poem in the collection known as the Lais of Marie de France and is one of very few lais to contain alternate titles. Like the other poems in this collection, Chaitivel is written in the Anglo-Norman dialect of Old French, in couplets of eight syllables in length. Synopsis In Nantes, Brittany, lives an exceedingly beautiful lady, who is loved by four knights. Because they are equally chivalrous, she cannot decide which one she prefers and decides to love them all at the same time. When a tournament is announced at Nantes, shortly after Easter, competitors come from all over France, including the four knights. In the tournament, three of the knights are killed and one is severely injured in the thigh. The lady builds a tomb and enshrines the dead; and then she ensures that the remaining knight receives the best medical care possible, though his injury has caused him to be impotent. While the lady frequently visits the knight, she continues to think of the three others who died. One night after dinner, the lady tells the knight that she will compose a lai in honor of her four lovers and name it \\"The Four Sorrows\\". The knight objects, however, stating that she should name it \\"The Unfortunate One\\" (\\"Chaitivel\\"). He explains that he has suffered the most: every day he must watch his beloved come and go, and yet he can never make love to her. The lady agrees and names the lai Chaitivel.

He was a member of the Waffen-SS. In this function, Bikker served as a guard at the prison and work camp Erika near Ommen. He received his nickname due to his brutal behaviour at the prison camp. Bikker is the alleged murderer of Dutch resistance fighter who was killed, twenty-seven years old, on 17 November 1944. Following the end of World War II, he was sentenced to death by a Dutch court. Together with Klaas Carel Faber, and four other convicted war criminals, he managed to escape from prison in Breda on 26 December 1952 and fled to Germany, crossing the border at Ubbergen near Cleves. Settling in the city of Hagen, he lived in Germany undetected until 1995. Following a decree from 1943, foreign members of the Waffen-SS automatically received German nationality. Germany does not extradite its own nationals. Finally, being one of the few surviving war criminals, he was taken to court after all in Germany. Bikker's only chance to evade prosecution and trial was to claim diminished responsibility due to illness. When a doctor attested Bikker's limited responsibility, his case came to court. However, following a breakdown and fainting in court, neurologists advised against Bikker standing trial due illness. Court was adjourned on 2 February 2004.

It features the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Grant Park Chorus along with guest performers and conductors, and claims to be the only free outdoor classical-music concert series in the US. The Festival is a non-profit organization. The Festival has been a Chicago tradition since 1931, when mayor Anton Cermak suggested free concerts to lift spirits of Chicagoans during the Great Depression.Tiebert, Laura, Frommer's Chicago with Kids (3rd edition), 2007, Wiley Publishing, Inc., , p.263.Knox, p. 15 The tradition of symphonic Grant Park Music Festival concerts began in 1935. The Festival was previously held at the Petrillo Music Shell in Grant Park, but moved to the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in the Millennium Park section of Grant Park for its 70th season, in 2004. It has occasionally been held at the Harris Theater. Over time, the Festival has had various financial supporters, three primary locations, and one name change. It has sometimes been nationally broadcast and has consistently enjoyed the efforts of many of the world's leading classical musicians. Recently, its organizers have agreed to release some of the Festival's concerts to the public on CD.  Funding  The series was almost completely funded by the Park District, originally. The District was responsible for performer payrolls, concert advertising and marketing, administered orchestra auditions, and coordinated the scheduling for each season list of guest artists.Macaluso, p. 168 Advertising costs for printed media designed by Park District graphic designers were funded through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Federal Arts Program. The tradition of posters for Chicago Transit Authority buses, Chicago \\"L\\" trains and stations and field houses continued even after WPA relief funding ended.Macaluso, pp. 4-5 In 1977, the Grant Park Concerts Society evolved to coordinate all fund-raising for the Festival. It coordinated both general marketing and the membership program. By hosting fund-raising events and selling Festival memberships, it supplemented the Parks District funding, which was in the $1.5‚Äì2.0 million range. In 1996, the Park District and Festival staff discontinued their relationship with the Concerts Society. The Park District resumed its responsibility as the sole marketing and fund- raising department. At the end of the 1990s, the Festival was recognized as a non-profit organization and developed ties with the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs. The relationship had the city department taking charge of some administrative duties. As of 2009, The Festival featured the Grammy- nominated Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and is sponsored by the Chicago Park District, the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and the Grant Park Orchestral Association. The park district provides over half of the operating costs, while the Department of Cultural Affairs contributes logistical support. The remaining funding come from a variety of private sources including foundations, corporations and thousands of individual patrons. The park district pays the salaries of principal conductor Carlos Kalmar, chorus director Christopher Bell, and members of the orchestra and Grant Park Chorus. The Festival also receives grants and broadcast fees. In 2010, the $2 million of the total Festival $4 million budget that was not covered by the Park District and was raised through memberships and private philanthropy. This money finances guest soloists and major collaborations.  History  The first concert occurred after the completion of the original Petrillo Music Shell on July 1, 1935 with a march from Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user. In the past, National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and CBS Broadcasting Inc. (CBS) have broadcast the free concerts. The first summer boasted an attendance of approximately 1.9 million for 65 concerts.Macaluso, p. 60 In 1939, the single-concert attendance record was set with over 300,000 for the Lily Pons concert.Macaluso, p. 62 Pons shared the stage with her husband Andre Kostelanetz in what was described as the largest audience of her career.Macaluso, p. 69 David Rubinoff was estimated to have drawn as many as 225,000.Macaluso, p. 63 Current attendance at the approximately thirty annual concerts is estimated at three hundred thousand in total. The free Festival has always had a picnic-like atmosphere.Macaluso, p. 64 In the 1930s, the concerts were presented on national radio broadcasts to dozens of radio stations.Macaluso, p. 67 In addition to lifting spirits, the Grant Park Music Festival has been able to provide musicians a living wage. In 1938, when the minimum wage was $0.25/hour, the musicians were paid $10 ($ today) for a 2-hour concert. In the early years, through the 1940s the Chicago Woman's Symphony performed often at the Festival.Macaluso, p. 87 In 1944, the Festival developed its own professional Grant Park Symphony Orchestra.Macaluso, p. viii Also in 1944, WGN (AM) began the nationally syndicated Theater of the Air live from Grant Park. In 1945, Nikolai Malko became the Festival's first resident conductor.Macaluso, p. 77 He served in that role until 1954.Macaluso, p. 86 Between the scheduling of Van Cliburn's 1958 Grant Park Music Festival appearance and his actual July 16 appearance, he won the quadrennial International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow that April. He was catapulted to international fame for winning one of the world's elite music competitions. As a result, he was greeted with a celebration that included a ticker tape parade down Michigan Avenue and his Grant Park Music Festival appearance was a major event.Macaluso, p. 96 In the 1960s, the Festival took a more adventurous direction featuring works by the likes of Arnold Schoenberg, Sergei Prokofiev, Gustav Mahler and Anton Werbern who highlighted the 1964 schedule under the new direction of Edward Gordon. In 1962, Thomas Peck became the leader of the newly formed Grant Park Chorus,Macaluso, p. 114 which he directed until his death in 1994.Macaluso, p. 127 In 1963, the Festival introduced the interactive daytime Young People's Concerts led by Irwin Hoffman and at times by youth audience members.Macaluso, p. 120 Gordon also introduced opera in concert as part of the Festival in 1964.Macaluso, p. 126 The 1970s saw declining attendance at the Festival.Macaluso, p. 131 Mitch Miller, who derived popularity from the Sing Along with Mitch television show was a regular conductor and one of the largest draws.Macaluso, p. 139 Steven Ovitsky, became concert manager in 1979 and served until 1990.Macaluso, p. 149 During the 1980s the Festival earned a reputation for performing works by American musical composers.Macaluso, p. 147 Ovitsky focused on living American composers such as William Bolcom, John Adams, Michael Torke and Paul Freeman. The 1980s also saw a host of elite principal conductors such as Zdenƒõk M√°cal, Leonard Slatkin, Hugh Wolff, David Zinman and Robert Shaw. The 1990s saw wide- ranging performances such as the Russian opera Prince Igor, a narration of Casey at the Bat by Jack Brickhouse with orchestral accompaniment, six Chicago Bulls National Basketball Association championship celebrations and a celebrated return visit of Van Cliburn for the sixtieth season. The Van Cliburn visit rivaled the Pons attendance figures with estimates exceeding 300,000.Macaluso, p. 165 In 1992, the Grant Park Concerts officially became the Grant Park Music Festival. From 1994 to 1997, Hugh Wolff served as principal conductor of the Festival and it took until 2000 for an elaborate search to yield Kalmar as his successor. The Festival ended the 2005 season with John Adams' Pulitzer Prize-winning On the Transmigration of Souls. In 2000, the Festival reached an agreement with Cedille Records to record the Grant Park Orchestra. It produced six CDs during the decade.Macaluso, p. 204 In 2001, Boston Landmarks Orchestra was founded for the purpose of providing a free summer concert series in Boston's Hatch Memorial Shell and now claims to also provide an annual free summer music series. On July 16, 2004, the Festival moved to the state of the art Pritzker Pavilion, where it shares space with a regular world music series (\\"Music Without Borders\\"), a jazz series (\\"Made in Chicago\\") and a variety of annual performances by Steppenwolf Theatre, Lyric Opera of Chicago and Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Nonetheless, the Festival remains the core of the summer program with its Wednesday, Friday and Saturday evening performances for ten weeks during the heart of the summer.Macaluso, p. 182 At the end of the 2005 Grant Park Music Festival season in August, the Festival's Grant Park Orchestra and Carlos Kalmar presented Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Adams' On the Transmigration of Souls, which was written at the request of the New York Philharmonic to honor the victims of the September 11 attacks.Macaluso, p. 215 In 2006, the Joffrey Ballet celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in a collaboration with the Festival. During the decade, the Festival hosted an innovative array of talents such as Chinese erhu player Betti Xiang, pipa player Yang Wei, Portuguese fado singer Mariza, Cuban classical and jazz clarinetist Paquito D'Rivera, Hungarian-Roma fiddler Roby Lakatos and Mediterranean singer Maria del Mar Bonet.Macaluso, p. 212  Performances  The performance schedule includes ten consecutive weeks of performances on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from mid June to mid August. Currently, performances usually begin at 6:30 on Wednesday and Friday and 7:30 on Saturday with band shell seats reserved for subscribers. Unclaimed seats are released to the public 15 minutes before each performance. The lawn seating is free and commonly adorned with blankets and families. Harris Theater hosts occasional Grant Park Music Festival events. The orchestra and chorus have open rehearsals at the Pritzker Pavilion during performance season with sessions usually running from 11:00 am to 1:30 pm and approximately 2:30 or 3:00 pm until 5:00 pm. The Festival is represented by a staff of trained guides, called docents, that field questions and provide educational talks during the rehearsals.Macaluso, p. 216 The rehearsals have programs available. In the 1930s, the concerts lured some of the most prominent performers and conductors in the world: Pons, Jascha Heifetz, Bobby Breen, Rudy Vallee, Helen Morgan, conductor Andre Kostelanetz, violinists David Rubinoff, Mischa Elman, Efrem Zimbalist and Albert Spalding, pianist Moriz Rosenthal, sopranos Marion Claire, Edith Mason and Vivian Della Chiesa, tenors Tito Schipa, John Carter, Lawrence Tibbett and baritone John Charles Thomas.Macaluso, p. 68 The 1940s saw a broad spectrum of performers including Mario Lanza, clarinetist Benny Goodman, soprano Kirsten Flagstad and actor-singer Paul Robeson.Macaluso, p. 78 Other performers included sopranos Claire, Eileen Farrell, Grace Moore and Della Chiesa, tenors Giovanni Martinelli, Richard Tucker and Jan Peerce, baritone Robert Merrill, violinist Mischa Mischakoff and conductors Frederick Stock, Leo Kopp, Arthur Fiedler and Antal Dor√°ti.Macaluso, p. 88 Beginning in the 1950s, Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley greeted the opening night crowds nearly every year during his 21-year tenure.Macaluso, p. 100 Among the performers of the 1950s were sopranos Beverly Sills and Farrell, tenor Peerce, pianists, Van Cliburn, Jorge Bolet, Gary Graffman and Earl Wild, violinists Elman and Michael Rabin, and cellist Janos Starker.Macaluso, p. 104 The 1960s upheld the tradition of diverse audiences and performers such as contralto Marian Anderson, pianists Alfred Brendel, Daniel Barenboim, Leon Fleisher, Lorin Hollander and Christoph Eschenbach, violinists Itzhak Perlman, Ruggiero Ricci, Charles Treger, Jaime Laredo, cellist Leonard Rose, conductor Leonard Bernstein, tenor Pl√°cido Domingo, mezzo-sopranos Maryilyn Horne and Tatiana Troyanos, soprano Martina Arroyo and Roberta Peters, as well as a host of dance companies such as the American Ballet Theatre, Joffrey Ballet and Maria Alba Spanish Dance Company.Macaluso, p. 122 The Joffrey Ballet performed Gerald Arpino and George Balanchine works. In the 1970s, the Festival hosted soprano June Anderson, vocalist Gordon MacRae, pianists Dave Brubeck, Alicia de Larrocha, Jerome Lowenthal and Sheldon Shkolnik and violinists Elaine Skorodin. Dancers from both the Chicago City Ballet and New York City Ballet were also featured.Macaluso, p. 138 Conductors included Mitch Miller, Leonard Slatkin, Aaron Copland and David Zinman. Dancer Edward Villella and soprano Kathleen Battle also made appearances.Macaluso, pp. 138-43 In the 1980s, featured performers included pianists Walter Klein, Hollander, Andr√© Watts and Garrick Ohlsson, clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, the Vermeer Quartet, baritone Merrill, bass Paul Plishka, soprano Arleen Auger and harmonica player Corky Siegel.Macaluso, p. 158 Conductors included Macal, Slatkin, Wolff, Zinman and Shaw. Performers in the 1990s included Van Cliburn, mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade, Rosemary Clooney, violinist Joshua Bell, conductor Maxim Shostakovich (who led works by his father Dmitry Shostakovich), trumpeter Doc Severinsen, and soprano Deborah Voigt. In the new millennium's first decade the Festival welcomed sopranos Battle, Dawn Upshaw, Karina Gauvin and Erin Wall, tenor Vittorio Grigolo, pianist Stephen Hough, violinists Rachel Barton Pine, James Ehnes, Roby Lakatos, Christian Tetzlaff and Pinchas Zukerman, vocalists Otis Clay, Mariza and Maria del Mar Bonet and rock band The Decemberists.Macaluso, p. 206 Other performers include pianist Valentina Lisitsa, soprano Jonita Lattimore, baritone Nathan Gunn and mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore.Macaluso, pp. 206-09 The Joffrey Ballet also performed with the Festival.Macaluso, p. 211 The principal conductor is Carlos Kalmar. Guests in the 2007 season included Marc-Andr√© Hamelin, Russell Braun, Erin Wall, Glen Ellyn Children's Chorus and many more performing the works of composers such as Brahms, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Leo Brouwer, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Tan Dun and Ferruccio Busoni. The 2010s included a scheduled Grant Park's screening of the BBC's nature documentary Planet Earth Live on July 21, with live orchestral accompaniment featuring the composer George Fenton, who served as conductor.  Reception  Frommer's describes the Festival as \\"One of the city's greatest bargains\\",Blackwell, Elizabeth Canning, Frommer's Chicago 2010, p. 32 and it notes that the series is popular.Blackwell, Elizabeth Canning, Frommer's Chicago 2010, p. 156 One of the special editions notes that the Festival is continuing to uphold its Depression era mission of lifting Chicagoans' hearts and suggests that you arrive at the Festival an hour early to get good lawn seats.Tiebert, Laura, Frommer's free & dirt cheap, pp. 8‚Äì9 It also notes that the daytime rehearsals are a good substitute for the evening performances.Tiebert, Laura, Frommer's free & dirt cheap, pp. 103‚Äì4  Notes  References   *  External links  * Category:Classical music festivals in the United States Category:Music festivals in Chicago Category:Millennium Park Category:Works Progress Administration in Illinois Category:1935 establishments in Illinois Category:Recurring events established in 1935 ","title":"Grant Park Music Festival"},{"id":"13359904","text":"The Mitsubishi Ki-1, also known as Mitsubishi Army Type 93 Heavy Bomber, was a bomber built by Mitsubishi for the Imperial Japanese Army in the 1930s, which flew for the first time in 1933. Despite its antiquated appearance, the Ki-1 was used in Manchukuo and in north China during the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War, in areas where danger from enemy fighter aircraft was minimal. Design and development The Mitsubishi Ki-1 was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with fixed landing gear, twin fins and rudders, and was powered by two Mitsubishi Ha2-II water-cooled V-12 engines, giving a maximum speed of . The pilot and co-pilot were seated in tandem under an enclosed canopy, while gunners sat in semi-enclosed nose and dorsal gun turrets, each armed with a single machine gun. The usable bomb load was up to . The Ki-1 shared a similar configuration with the Junkers S 36 first flown in 1927, militarized into the Junkers K37 by Junker's Swedish subsidiary AB Flygindustri at Limhamn near Malm√∂. It was able to reach altitudes not reachable for the fighters of 1927. However, as soon as 1930 this advantage was lost due to British developments such as the Bristol Bulldog fighter, and Junkers was not successful in selling the design. In 1931 however representatives of Mitsubishi from Japan visited the Limhamn facilities to study some of the military conversions of Junkers aircraft. The sole K 37 prototype S-AABP (ex D-1252 - S 36-prototype), as well as all development papers were purchased in part by funds raised by donations in Japan. The aircraft got the name Aikoku No.1 (patriotic gift). The K37 prototype was brought to Japan and tested in combat during the Manchurian Incident of 1931, following which the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force authorized Mitsubishi to produce both heavy and light bomber variations. The heavy bomber Ki-1, was much larger than the original Junkers K37 and first flew in August 1932. A total of 118 aircraft were built in two versions between March 1933 and April 1936. A Ki-1 in flight with gunners stations and ventral dustbin turret manned Operational history The Mitsubishi Ki-1 was also designated Mitsubishi Army Type 93-I Heavy Bomber under the long aircraft nomenclature system used by the Japanese military. Already obsolete by the time of its introduction, it found use during the counterinsurgency operations of the Pacification of Manchukuo, as well as limited use during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The design was upgraded to the Mitsubishi Ki-1-II (Mitsubishi Army Type 93-II Heavy Bomber) with a strengthened airframe and slightly more powerful Mitsubishi Ha2-III V-12 engines, which increased maximum speed to . However, even with the new engines, the Ki-1 was still underpowered, and was unable to maintain altitude during single engine flights, which proved to be a serious issue during the aircraft's operational service due to lack of reliability of the engines.

They were an important source of development in military theory, and in particular of armoured warfare before, during and after the Second World War, in the process influencing the outcome of World War II and the Korean War. Beginnings The Red Army's tactical doctrine was shaped by the Russian experience of the First World War, and in particular the Brusilov Offensive. Theoretical writings on tactical doctrine in the late 1920s reflect Soviet awareness that motor transport and armoured vehicles would potentially change the conduct of warfare. Many of the popular Russian Civil War leaders were cavalry officers, which strengthened support for the notion that development of Soviet tactical doctrine should emphasize maneuver and mobility, as was the case in other European armies which were perceived as a future threat to the spread of the Socialist and Communist ideals, such as America and the rest of the capitalist world. In the late 1920s the Soviet Union's Military Commissariat, in addition to establishing a regular armed force known as the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, established several directorates responsible for development of doctrines of the various combat arms and combat service support arms. Part of the effort included purchasing equipment from overseas to gain understanding of recent developments, including armoured vehicles from France and Britain as well as several chassis from an American designer that later became the basis of a family of Soviet produced tanks. Theoretical development The basic tactical principles of the Red Army remained those used during World War I, primarily trench warfare, until the emergence of theoreticians such as Uborevich, Tukhachevsky and Triandafillov who transformed the tactical, operational and strategic conduct of war in Soviet military philosophy. The core premise of the new thinking became a maintenance of the offensive, increase of tempo in the conduct of combat, use of overwhelming firepower, and penetration in depth of enemy territory. The Brusilov operation was regarded as the most successful conducted by the Russian Army during World War I, and recognition of the ultimate failure to reach its objectives was related to several inherent failings of the Russian Army such as lack of armoured vehicles to provide close support to assaulting infantry, interaction with the air units, and above all good small unit leadership. While developing their theoretic work, the Soviet military command invited German officers to participate in, and contribute to exercises held in the then Belorussian Special Military District. Development and application before World War II The doctrine, described in Triandafillov's work The Character of the Operations of Modern Armies, and later formally in the PU-36 (1936 Field Service Regulations) authored by Tukhachevskii in the early 1930s, spelled out the tactical and operational doctrines and led to a complete reorganisation of the Red Army to include large numbers of motor transport and armoured vehicles. The infantry would now work with heavy artillery to break through the enemy's possibly fortified forward positions, thus allowing the mobile troops to exploit the breach to penetrate enemy's defensive positions and destroy rear support and service units and ultimately lines of communications. Infantry units received substantial increase in the number of automatic weapons and supporting artillery, and there was a concerted effort to improve leadership qualities of the officer corps, including teaching and encouraging use of initiative. The many cavalry formations that still existed in the Red Army changed their tactics from the usual cavalry role to that of mobile mounted infantry to support the tanks, but less reliant on fuel and support, thereby reducing the logistic tail of the operational formation. Significant attention was paid to development of close air support (CAS) although there was a serious impediment in the industrial capability to provide enough radios to the military units. Stalin severely undermined the improvements made when he instituted the Great Purge of 1936‚Äì38, which resulted in the loss of a significant portion of trained officers from the army, including Tukhachevskii. Many of the remaining officers lacked the experience and training necessary to carry out the doctrine of deep battle. Other survivors became fearful of displaying initiative contravening direct Stavka orders. Further complicating the problem was that many of the personnel needed to train new officers were themselves also purged. Nevertheless, the new regulations were used during the Soviet-Japanese clashes on the eastern China‚ÄìRussia border with overwhelming success. The theory had been applied against the conventional Japanese infantry tactics and was proven to work. Poland 1939 When World War 2 began with the German invasion of Poland, Stalin instituted a rapid forced expansion of the Red Army, which resulted in even more poorly trained and inexperienced officers being placed in commanding positions they were not ready for. Winter War The Great Purges had a significant impact on Soviet ability to set and achieve operational objectives during the war in Finland. Shortfalls in terrain analysis, intelligence on Finnish disposition, equipment, and personnel plagued early Soviet attempts at deep battle. By December 1939 Soviet advances began to stall out and despite initial success with doctrinal mass and penetration across a broad front. A lack of dedicated mechanized exploitation forces allowed the Finnish army to stem and repel Soviet advances with counterattacks on Soviet flanks. Tactically, the Soviets lacked cohesive combined arms maneuver and tanks were regularly committed without infantry support. Soviet success was achieved ultimately through a strategy of attrition, using a significantly larger resource base to wear away at the Finnish army. Barbarossa By the time of the German invasion in June 1941 the Red Army was roughly twice the size it had been in September 1939, but was sorely unprepared for war. The doctrine of Deep Battle was still the official line, but few of the soldiers were trained or prepared to utilize it correctly.

Beethoven Symphonies (), S.464, are a set of nine transcriptions for solo piano by Franz Liszt of Ludwig van Beethoven's symphonies 1‚Äì9. They are among the most technically demanding piano music ever written. History By 1837, Liszt appears to have completed the transcriptions of the fifth, sixth and seventh symphonies, of which the fifth and sixth were published by Breitkopf & H√§rtel and the seventh by Tobias Haslinger. In 1843, he arranged the third movement of the Third Symphony, which was later published by Pietro Mechetti in 1850. Liszt was paid 8 francs per page by Breitkopf & H√§rtel, who first requested two symphonies to be transcribed. During his 1840 travels in Europe he might have given the transcribed symphonies some publicity by playing them at his concerts. With three symphonies transcribed, Liszt set aside the work for another 23 years. It was not until 1863 that Breitkopf & H√§rtel suggested to Liszt that he transcribe the complete set for a future publication. For this work, Liszt recycled his previous transcriptions by simplifying passages, stating that \\"the more intimately acquainted one becomes with Beethoven, the more one clings to certain singularities and finds that even insignificant details are not without their value\\". He would note down the names of the orchestral instruments for the pianist to imitate, and also add pedal marks and fingerings for amateurs and sight readers. When Liszt began work transcribing the ninth symphony, he expressed that \\"after a great deal of experimentation in various directions, I was unable to deny the utter impossibility of even a partially satisfactory and effective arrangement of the 4th movement. I hope you will not take it amiss if I dispense with this and regard my arrangements of the Beethoven symphonies as complete at the end of the 3rd movement of the Ninth.\\" (He had in fact completed a transcription of the Ninth Symphony for two pianos in 1850.) Nevertheless, he made another attempt after an expressive letter from Breitkopf & H√§rtel, and expressed \\"the range achieved by the pianoforte in recent years as a result of progress both in playing technique and in terms of mechanical improvements enables more and better things to be achieved than was previously possible. Through the immense development of its harmonic power the piano is trying increasingly to adopt all orchestral compositions. In the compass of its seven octaves it is able, with only a few exceptions, to reproduce all the characteristics, all the combination, all the forms of the deepest and most profound works of music. It was with this intention that I embark on the work which I now present to the world.\\" The full set of transcriptions were finally published in 1865 and dedicated to Hans von B√ºlow. The original publication of the fifth and sixth symphonies had been dedicated to the painter and amateur violinist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Vol. V, p. 299: Franz Liszt: Catalogue of Works  Reception and recordings  Cyprien Katsaris in 1996. He is the second musician to record the complete symphony transcriptions. Vladimir Horowitz, in a 1988 interview, stated \\"I deeply regret never having played Liszt's arrangements of the Beethoven symphonies in public ‚Äì these are the greatest works for the piano ‚Äì tremendous works ‚Äì every note of the symphonies is in the Liszt works.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/arts/music/liszt-a-piano-virtuoso- whose-genius-was-interpretation.html?_r=0 Liszt's Beethoven Symphony transcriptions are little known outside serious musical circles, and were in relative obscurity for over 100 years after their publication. It remains a mystery why none of Liszt's pupils performed or recorded these works. The first recording of any of them was not until 1967, when Glenn Gould recorded the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies. ƒ∞dil Biret became the first pianist to record the complete cycle, between July 1985 and April 1986. Subsequently, Cyprien Katsaris, Leslie Howard, Konstantin Scherbakov and Yury Martynov have also recorded all nine. In February 1971 at Trinity College, Dublin, Irish pianist Charles Lynch played the entire set of Liszt's transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies over four successive Saturday evenings. The Irish Times critic, Charles Acton, paid tribute to Lynch's achievement: > \\"It is doubtful if Liszt himself ever played them as a series. Since his > day, individual virtuosi have played individual symphonies but it is > possible that Charles Lynch is the first person who has played all of them > as a public series - and all in four weeks. On that score we may be in the > presence of a historical event.

In a 2012 interview, Cyprien Katsaris, after performing Liszt's transcription of the 3rd Symphony Eroica publicly for the 79th time, said he \\"...called [his] agent and told him to change all the programs because [he] could not play it anymore...\\", he then continued, \\"...it helps you with anything that you play after it!\\" Frederic Chiu has recorded the 5th and 7th Symphonies for Centaur Records. In his program notes he suggests that \\"Liszt's piano scores must therefore be taken as a sort of gospel in regards to Beethoven's intentions with the Symphonies\\" because of Liszt's unique perspective, having met Beethoven in person, having heard collaborators and contemporaries of Beethoven perform the Symphonies, having studied and performed the works both as a pianist/transcriber and as a conductor in Weimar. No one in history could claim to have as much exposure, insight and journalistic integrity as regards Beethoven's intentions around the Symphonies. Musicologist Dr. Alan Walker stated that Liszt's Beethoven Symphony transcriptions \\"are arguably the greatest work of transcription ever completed in the history of music.\\" NotesReferences *Letters of Franz Liszt ‚Äî Volume 1: from Paris to Rome *Letters of Franz Liszt ‚Äî Volume 2: from Rome to the End External links * *Discography of Beethoven-Liszt: The complete symphonies Category:Compositions by Franz Liszt Category:Compositions for solo piano Category:1843 compositions Symphonies Category:Arrangements of classical compositions ","title":"Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)"},{"id":"13359986","text":"Mette is a female given name of Scandinavian origin.

The building opened in 2005 and is located above the IJtunnel, a ten-minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal station. The building was designed by Danish architects 3XN. The Bimhuis is part of and partly integrated in the Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ. Background Before the Muziekgebouw there was Muziekcentrum de IJsbreker located at the Weesperzijde that got shut down and replaced by the Muziekgebouw. Just like the IJsbreker the venue primarily focuses on contemporary classical music, while the Bimhuis is mainly focused on contemporary jazz music. Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ has one big concert space, but also a smaller one that is also used for conferences, talk, exhibitions. Also concerts take place at various other locations in the building such as the atrium and on the three large balconies above the restaurant. Often expositions of installations and sound art are programmed as well. Yearly the World Minimal Music Festival and Holland Festival takes place in Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ. There is a monthly cross-over event called The Rest is Noise that involves experimental pop music in the agenda of the venue. The first main and artistic director was Jan Wolff (2005‚Äì2008); Tino Haenen has been artistic director since June 2008. Haenen was previously director of the Belgian contemporary music festival Ars Musica. Since December 1st 2008 Boudewijn Berentsen is the main director, while Haenen stayed the artistic director. Since February 2012 Haenen is followed up by Maarten van Boven, formerly the vice-director of Paradiso. Education IJsbreker was a pioneering organization in the field of education about experimental music for children. Originally named the Klankspeeltuin ('Sound playground') the education centre had a collection of interactive sound installations. Muziekgebouw continued the activity of the IJsbreker with a newly build collection and has an active education programme for children and teenagers. Over 400 workshops per year are held there, and is the biggest in Europe on this educational front. The Klankspeeltuin consists of a space filled with unique custom build experimental musical instruments. Around 2016 the old collection became outdated and suffered from a lot of technical flaws and the team decided to renew the complete collection and replace if for smaller hands on instruments, instead of interactive installations. With this equipment the organisation also runs events on location. Also it is not only focused on children and teenagers anymore, but also gives more elaborate multiple day workshops for older people/students. For this project they approached a team of inventors to build a unique collection of experimental musical instruments for them. In June 2017 the Klankspeeltuin was renamed as the Sound Lab and currently owns 100 different instruments ranging from a series of ethnic instruments from all over the world to known odd instruments such as the theremin and the steel tongue drum to more unique designs by builders such as Yuri Landman, Arvid Jense, Diane Verdonk, Dato Instruments, Makey Makey, and othershttp://www.parool.nl/stadsgids/s-v-p-overal-aanzitten-in- klankwerkplaats-soundlab~a4502939/. Current director of the Sound Lab is Anouk Diepenbroek. Fokker Organ Inside the Bamzaal there is also the microtonal 31-TET Fokker organ, designed by Adriaan Fokker. Regularly concerts take place on this organ. Offices It houses the Holland Festival, Stichting Huygens- Fokker, Slagwerk Den Haag as well as many other Dutch music organisations. It also hosted some events of the 17th edition of the Sonic Acts Festival, in 2017.

It has previously been sponsored by Zain Telecommunications and was known as Zain Africa Challenge. Prior to the acquisition of MTC, Celtel's parent company, the competition was known as the Celtel Africa Challenge. The programme was an extension of Celtel‚Äôs corporate social responsibility initiative known as ‚ÄúMaking Life Better‚Äù, further adopted and retained by Zain. It was created by Richard Reid and produced by Richard Reid Productions, which also produces the Honda Campus All-Star Challenge in the United States. Season five, which was set to be telecast in 2011, failed to make it past pre- production after the Zain sold its African network operations to Bharti Airtel. Zain Africa Challenge was hosted by John Sibi-Okumu. Game Format Africa Challenge is a question-and-answer game played between two teams of three players each. The game is played in four rounds. The first three rounds are called Face-Off Rounds. The fourth round is called the Ultimate Challenge. Face-Off Rounds In each of these rounds, there are two types of questions: Face-Offs, worth 10 points each, and Bonuses, worth 20 points. In each of the three Face-Off rounds, a different player represents the team answering Face-Off questions. That player is the only one who can answer for his or her team. On Face-Offs, after the entire question is read, the first player to signal gets to answer. If s/he answers correctly, the team gets a Bonus question. If s/he answers wrong, the player representing the other team gets a chance to answer the Face-Off. If that player answers correctly, his or her team gets the Bonus. Bonuses are played by the entire team. In each Face- Off round, there are four new categories. In each category there are four Face-Off questions. Each Face-Off has a related Bonus question. The last player to correctly answer a Face-Off selects the category for the next Face- Off. Ultimate Challenge At the end of the three Face-Off rounds, the teams play the Ultimate Challenge. The team that‚Äôs behind goes first. If there‚Äôs a tie, a coin toss occurs and the team that wins decides if it wants to go first or last. Each team gets a turn to play the Ultimate Challenge. There are four new categories from which to choose. When it‚Äôs a team‚Äôs turn to play, the players confer and select the category. Once a category is selected, it is no longer available. In the Ultimate Challenge, the team has 60 seconds to answer 10 questions. The questions are read rapid-fire one after the other. Team members can confer on answers. Any team member may call out an answer. The first answer heard by the moderator is the one that will be accepted. As long as there is time remaining, teams can keep coming back to questions which they missed or on which they passed. Each question is worth 50 points, and if a team can answer all 10 questions correctly, then in addition to the 500 points, each team member receives a US$500 bonus. Even if the first team to play the Ultimate Challenge does not take the lead in the game, the second team plays the Ultimate Challenge because the team members have a chance to win the bonus money. The team with the most points at the end of the Ultimate Challenge wins the game. Grants and Prizes Zain provided grants to the 16 participating universities and to the students who represent the universities at the Zain Africa Challenge Championship Festival. Universities who participate in the first-round of the knockout competition receive US$5,000 and each player receives $500. As the competition progresses, the monetary and other grants increase: * Quarter-final universities receive US$100,000 and each player receives $1,000 * Semi-final universities receive US$1,500,000 and each player receives $1,000 plus $500 in educational materials * The runner-up university receives US$2,500,000 and each player receives $1,000 plus $1,500 in educational materials * The champion university receives US$5,000,000 and each player receives $1,000 plus $3,500 in educational materials In addition, players whose teams sweep the Ultimate Challenge round in any televised match receive a US$500 per-person bonus.

It is furnished with an all-metal hull, pusher propellers, a gull wing, and retractable landing gear. During late 1948, the P.136 prototype performed its maiden flight; roughly six months later, it reportedly completed certification tests, clearing the type's entry into service. The aircraft was marketed in the United States as the Royal Gull by American distributor Kearney and Trecker. During the late 1950s, a land-based utility aircraft, the Piaggio P.166, was developed from the P.136 and shares many design similarities, despite the deletion of the hull in favour of a conventional fuselage. Development During the 1940s, barely a year following the end of the Second World War, Italian aircraft manufacturer Piaggio Aero, being keen to rebuild itself and its customer base in the post-war era, embarked upon the development of a new amphibian design. As noted by Aviation periodical Flight International, this was no simple choice, as many aviation companies had been defeated in their ambitions to develop efficient flying watercraft and required ingenuity to achieve. The design produced by Piaggio was of a relatively large aircraft, yet still being capable of operations from both relatively rough waters and fairly compact grass air strips. Furthermore, large portions of the aircraft, such as its three-bladed constant-speed propellers, was internally designed by the company.Lambert 1958, p. 487. During 1954, Francis K. Trecker, president of Kearney & Trecker Corporation, was impressed when he witnessed a P.136 in flight, and offered to bring the type to the North American market. A new entity, initially known as the Royal Aircraft Corporation, was formed to distribute the aircraft in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Trecker secured the right to build complete aircraft, but he typically imported partially-constructed P.136s from Italy and assembled them with additional American-sourced components and systems. Around 75 engineering modifications were made to the airframe to better suit North American requirements. Design A Piaggio P.136 The Piaggio P.136 was a twin-engine pusher-type amphibian, being capable of carrying a maximum of five people with baggage, or a pair of stretchers and an accompanying medical attendant. While the general configuration and systems remained largely the same across different models, there were some customisations present in the cabin to suit its customer and intended purpose; while military aircraft would often be fitted with alternative instrumentation and radio sets, as well as additional transparent panels in locations like the doors for greater external visibility, civil P.136s would be furnished with more comfortable seating and additional panelling for sound exclusion and heat retention purposes. The aircraft's fuel is stowed in two large metal tanks housed within the hull. The P.136's pusher configuration confers several advantages, one being that both the propellers and engines are kept well clear of spray and the cabin doors. Cooling of the engines is achieved via large scoops located above the leading edges of the wing. After passing through the engines, this heated air is then channeled at the propellers to keep them free of ice, making any special de-icing apparatus unnecessary. Reportedly, operations revealed that even prolonged taxiing in tropical climates did not lead to any instances of overheating. Another benefit of the aft positioning of the engines is that cabin noise is inherently lessened in the cabin, providing a quieter environment for passengers and pilot alike. The engines typically drove fixed-pitch propellers, although variable-pitch propellers were available as an option for greater performance.Lambert 1958, pp. 487-478. P.136 L-1 during takeoff Several features of the P.136 are to enhance customer convenience. Access to the cabin is eased by stepping on the spray dam set upon the chine, while a spacious baggage compartment is present to the rear of this cabin; some bulky cargo may also be stowed inside a large chamber accessed via a hatch located just aft of the wing. The top of the fuselage has four hoisting points, intended for use by cranes to lifting the aircraft. For ease of maintenance, only a handful of moves are required to unclip the engine cowlings to directly access the aircraft's powerplants. A starboard windscreen panel controls all mooring and anchoring operations, while full nautical riding and navigation lights are fitted. The aircraft has a total of six sealed bilge compartments, which can be pumped dry via a single hydraulic pump; reportedly, it can remain buoyant even with two compartments flooded. In terms of its controls and handling, Flight International observed that the P.136's boat hull makes little imposition on its flight characteristics: \\"As a landplane, it behaves as well as any comparable light twin, except that it pays the penalty of slightly lower cruising speed incurred by its marine capabilities\\"; the publication also praised its \\"excellent manoeuvrability\\" and ability to perform a \\"very steep approach\\".Lambert 1958, p. 488. All of the flight control surfaces had a fabric covering, these typically being mass-balanced. As common amongst flying boats, both the control wheel and pedal travel are large, aiding in take-off runs to avoid water-based obstructions such as buoys. Water steering is achieved via a large rudder that is linked to cable of the aerodynamic rudder; it is extended by pulling a long wire out of the cabin roof. Highly-effective slotted flaps were positioned in sections on either side of the engine nacelles, full deployment of which rarely being used other than to rapidly decelerate. Operational history According to Flight International, the Italian Air Force was the first organisation to place an order for the type.Lambert 1958, p. 486. During the 1950s, the Italian Air Force opted to procure a fleet of 14 P.136s, where they were used to conduct coastal patrol and air-sea rescue missions. In addition to military sales, the P. 136 also received orders from civilian operators. A number were purchased by individuals and private operators. American aircraft manufacturer Kearney and Trecker was appointed as a wholesaler for the type, received three Italian-built P.136s along with the partially-assembled fuselages and components for the productions of another 29 examples of the type under a licensing arrangement. The company produced a handful of examples under the Royal Gull brand.Lambert 1958, pp. 486-487.

Xiao S) and Kevin Tsai (Ëî°Â∫∑Ê∞∏). It was produced by Chungta Production (‰∏≠Â§ßË£Ω‰Ωú) from 2004 to 2009, and currently produced by Gin Star Entertainment (ÈáëÊòüÂ®õÊ®Ç) along with the writing and production staff of GUESS. It was first broadcast on 5 January 2004 and ended in 2016. In most episodes, the hosts interview a panel of celebrities in various and controversial topics while employing their signature comedic bantering. It is broadcast in Hong Kong on ATV Home under the name of Variety Show of Mr Con and Ms Csi.Variety Show of Mr. Con and Ms. Csi on ATV Home Retrieved 2010-12-08 Although it is broadcast in Taiwan, the show is very successful and popular among Chinese speaking audiences across the world who watch uploaded re-runs over the internet or through bootleg DVDs. The show has been mentioned in other Taiwanese variety and talk shows, mainly from presenters who appeared on the show. Since its debut in 2004, it has been one of the most successful talk shows in Taiwan and in Mandarin speaking countries across Asia.  Style  Unlike most Chinese language talk shows, the format of Kangsi is fast-paced, humorous and fully self-aware, despite topics that are occasionally controversial, and taped in a small studio. Most episodes feature a group of entertainers and politicians as guest stars engaging into discussions ranging from their career to gossip and current events. Along with its variety show approach, Kangsi frequently accompanies itself with cartoon sound effects, comical use of editing (instant replays and freeze frames) and wacky animated texts and visuals.  Name  This program was originally called \\"Qi Guai Shi Dian Zhong\\" (Â•áÊÄ™ÂçÅÈªûÈêò, \\"Weird 10 o'clock\\"). And later changed to \\"KƒÅngxƒ´ L√°i Le\\". The word \\"Kangxi\\" was derived from the names of both hosts; \\"Â∫∑\\" (Kang) was taken from the Chinese name of Kevin Tsai and the word \\"ÁÜô\\" (Xi) was taken from the Chinese name of Dee Hsu. It is also a play on the name of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty.  Special Units  This program is mainly focus on interviews of guests, however, there are also some special units which have been held irregularly: * \\"Remove Makeup\\" - Female artists are required to remove makeup and wear pajamas to show their natural side * \\"Gift Swap\\" - artists and sometimes the hosts are required to bring gifts that match certain themes, such as gifts for Christmas party or gifts from ex-love partners, and exchange them with each other * \\"Apology Unit\\" - guests can confess to the wrong things they did recently, and sometimes their confession target would be invited to program to confront them * Singing and dancing competitions judged by professionals and the hosts  List of guests  Since its premiere in 2004, the hosts have interviewed entertainers and politicians from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Mainland China, and elsewhere. Most of the guests have previously hosted and appeared in other Taiwanese variety shows with Tsai and Hsu prior to Kangsi. Barbie Hsu, sister of Dee Hsu, made a rare appearance on the show, discussing part of her very private life outside her career.

After widening the hole to allow for human entry, the explorers discovered one of the most spectacular caves in the western United States.

CitySpace was active from 1993-1996 and won the 1996 NII Award for Arts and Entertainment. Early CitySpace installations at the Boston Computer Museum (1993), Exploratorium (1994 and 1995) and Ontario Science Center (1995) combined educational computer graphics workshops and introduction to internet communications for young people ages 8 to 18. Both during and between CitySpace installations, contributors around the world collaborated via email and early internet video tools including CU-SeeMe to create avatars, buildings, vehicles and virtual toys. CitySpace installations consisted of networked Silicon Graphics Onyx Reality Engine supercomputers, Macintosh-based 3D modeling and graphics software, videoconferencing and data projection. The CitySpace software, written by Chris Cederwall of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, enabled real-time rendering, six degrees of avatar motion, text chat, and peer-to-peer communication between CitySpace clients for sharing avatar position information, chat content, and graphics updates.

EMM equips, sends, and supports mission workers in 36 countries. EMM's mission statement: Christ's transforming love compels us to cross cultures, engage the world, and make disciples of Jesus.  History  In 1894, a group of 12 Lancaster County Mennonites formed a group called Home Mission Advocates for the purpose of aiding in local mission work. Their original outreach took the form of local Sunday school classes and community service projects, but the group also carried a strong global vision. In 1914, the group founded Eastern Mennonite Board of Missions and Charities (EMBMC), with the aim of someday sending mission workers to various international locations. The early days of EMM ministry established work in the Philadelphia area, the Welsh Mountains of Pennsylvania, Lancaster City, and many rural areas. In 1934, global mission work began when EMM's first international missionaries settled near Shirati, Tanzania. In the 1950s, workers began serving in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. In 1988, work expanded to include the Middle East, and in recent decades EMM has continued to experience growth in missionary sending among its international partner church network. EMM's mission vision was initially financially supported by several dozen Mennonite churches in Lancaster County and the surrounding areas. As the work grew, the support base also grew and now includes Anabaptist congregations and individuals primarily in the Eastern United States. The popular name Eastern Mennonite Missions (EMM) was adopted in 1993.  Global work  Since EMM's founding, more than 7,440 individuals have served as missionaries and volunteer workers in 21 U.S. states and in over 109 countries. EMM's core work has always been to multiply disciples across cultures, based on the Great Commission of Matthew 28:19 in which Jesus gives his disciples the charge to ‚Äúmake disciples of all nations.‚Äù EMM personnel work in a variety of ministry areas, including business for transformation, children at risk, discipleship training, education, health and community development, hospitality, leadership training, Muslim ministry, and pioneer witness.  Global churches  EMM workers have been involved in the formation of Mennonite churches around the world. Thirty-four church groups have formed or developed through the ministries of EMM, and these now comprise over 450,000 baptized members. Some of these include Kenya Mennonite Church, Tanzania Mennonite Church, the Honduran Mennonite Church, Amor Vivente (Honduras), the Vietnam Mennonite Church, Garifuna Mennonite Church (Belize and the U.S.), the K‚Äôekchi‚Äô Mennonite Church (Guatemala), the Peruvian Mennonite Church, Life Enrichment Church (Thailand) and numerous other church plants globally and in the U.S.  Christian-Muslim relations  EMM's Christian/Muslim Relations Team was founded in 2013 by missionary, author, and professor David W. Shenk. Shenk is a Muslim studies expert and a global consultant for EMM, having authored or co-authored multiple books about Christian-Muslim relations and global missions. These include Surprises of the Christian Way, Journeys of the Muslim Nation and the Christian Church, Anabaptists Meeting Muslims, Creating Communities of the Kingdom, Global Gods, God‚Äôs Call to Mission, Teatime in Mogadishu, A Christian and a Muslim in Dialogue, and Christian. Muslim. Friend. Shenk's approach to Christian-Muslim relations is founded on the Anabaptist commitment to pacifism and Christian witness. Initially a three- member team, the Christian/Muslim Relations Team grew to five members in 2014. Members act as global missionaries with EMM, traveling together and separately to multiple countries each year. Although the stated mission of the team is to ‚Äúequip Christians around the world for life-giving relationships with Muslims,‚Äù the team also regularly engages with Muslims.  Presidents  Past EMM presidents include John H. Mellinger (1914‚Äì1934), Henry Garber (1934‚Äì1956), H. Raymond Charles (1956‚Äì1980), Paul G. Landis (1980‚Äì1993), Norman G.

He is the co-founder of Kingston Technology. Early life John Tu was born in Chongqing, China. He was the son of an official in China's Nationalist government. He moved to Shanghai with his parents in 1945, before going to Taiwan two years later as the Chinese civil war neared the coast. John felt totally lost at school. He describes himself as a mediocre student unable to attend the best Chinese colleges. Therefore, John moved in 1960 to Germany. He wanted to study electrical engineering, but John didn't know how to speak German. He knew how to speak a few sentences in English. So after several weeks, he went out on the street to find someone who spoke English. A biker led him to an priest who had lived in China, and sent him to a language school in Munich. In Germany at that time, a two-year apprenticeship was required for everyone, so he worked at a shipbuilding factory. After working there for two years, he studied electrical engineering at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt in Germany and graduated in 1970. He then went to work for Motorola in Wiesbaden, Germany. In 1971 he moved to California. Career In 1982, he co-founded Camintonn with David Sun. in 1986, they sold it for $6 million and founded Kingston Technology.

In addition to his work as an author, his paid work was principally as a magistrate in Springfontein, South Africa, as well as in Namaqualand and the Transkei. His last position before retirement was as Chief Magistrate of Port Elizabeth, one of South Africa's larger cities. He organised the building of \\"New Brighton\\", a township for aboriginal African people in Port Elizabeth. At the time it was regarded as very progressive‚Äîa pleasant place to live. Scully was born in Dublin, Ireland, raised in Cashel, County Tipperary, and then emigrated to southern Africa with his parents in 1867. During 1871 he prospected for diamonds with Cecil Rhodes in Africa. His daughter, Miriam Power (b. 1893), married Dr John A. Ryle; their children included Sir Martin Ryle, Nobel laureate and Astronomer Royal from 1972 to 1982. Scully died in Umbogintwini on KwaZulu-Natal's coast in 1943; his second wife (Nora) also died that same year. His novel Daniel Vananda describes the violence engendered by the ethnic legislation of the time. Similarly, Kafir Stories contains stories that are generally sympathetic with the aboriginal African peoples of South Africa. After the Boer War, Scully was appointed Chair of a commission to investigate war crimes by the British forces in the Cape Province. (The main war crimes were committed in the Transvaal and the Free State.) After this he wrote The Harrow, which was fictional but based on cases which the commission had investigated. He supplied the publishers with a key to every incident in the book‚Äîbut with the proviso that this should never be published. Years later he regretted writing the book.

There are five possible filing status categories: single individual, married person filing jointly or surviving spouse, married person filing separately, head of household and a qualifying widow(er) with dependent children. A taxpayer who qualifies for more than one filing status may choose the most advantageous status.26 U.S.C. 1, Section 1 Determining filing status Generally, the marital status on the last day of the year determines the status for the entire year.26 U.S.C. 1, Section 2 Single Generally, if someone is unmarried, divorced, a registered domestic partner, or legally separated according to state law on December 31, that person must file as a single person for that year because the marital status at year-end applies for the entire tax year.Id. There are some exceptions, such as qualifying as a head of household or as a surviving spouse, that do not require one to file as a single taxpayer. Married filing jointly Marital status is decided based on a person's marital status on December 31. If a couple is married on December 31 of the taxable year, the couple may file a joint return for the year.Id. However, even if the first day of legal separation or divorce from the spouse is December 31, one cannot file a joint return for any portion of that year.Id. Certain married individuals, not legally separated or divorced, may still be considered single for purposes of filing tax returns if they are living apart.Id. A married couple is not required to file jointly. If one lived apart from one's spouse for the last six months of the year, one may also qualify for head of household status.Id. If a spouse dies during the year, the surviving spouse may generally still file a joint return with the deceased spouse for that year because the taxpayer's marital status at the time of the spouse's death applies to the entire taxable year. Married filing separately Although the joint return often produces lower taxes, the opposite is sometimes the case. To accommodate for such circumstances, married couples may decide to file separately for a taxable year.Samuel A. Donaldson, \\"Federal Income Taxation Of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials\\", 2d. edition St. Paul: Thompson-West 2007, 2d edition, 5-7. Married couples filing separately does not create an identical situation to the two parties filing as single. There are different brackets for unmarried taxpayers from the ones for married taxpayers who file separately. Unmarried taxpayers enjoy wider tax brackets and so pay less tax on the same amount of income.Id. Certain taxpayers, who would otherwise be considered married but file separately, maintain a household for a child and have a spouse not a member of the household for the last six months of the taxable year shall be considered unmarried. Head of household To qualify for the head of household filing status, one must be unmarried and pay more than half the cost of maintaining a home for oneself and another relative who lives with that person for over half the year and can be claimed as the dependent.Id. A \\"dependent\\" for these purpose includes grandchild and step- grandchildren, not just children and stepchildren.26 U.S.C. 1, Section 2(b) Filing as a head of household can have substantial financial benefits over filing as a single status taxpayer. As a head of household, one may obtain a more generous tax brackets and larger standard deductions.: Samuel A. Donaldson, \\"Federal Income Taxation Of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials\\", 2d. edition (St. Paul: Thompson-West 2007, 2d edition, 5-7. There are many special rules and exceptions applicable to head of household filing status.: Id. Qualifying widow(er) with dependent child Certain taxpayers, who maintain their homes as principal residences of qualifying dependents and whose spouses died during either of the last two preceding taxable years, may be considered surviving spouses as long as they have not remarried. If the two-year time period has run out following the spouse's death, one may still qualify for head of household status. There are many special rules and exceptions that apply to the surviving spouse filing status. Importance of choosing correct status An individual's tax liability depends upon two variables: the individual's filing status and the taxable income.Id. The status can be determinative of the correct amount of tax, whether one can take certain tax deductions or exemptions that could lower the final tax bill, and even whether one must file a return at all.: Id. One must file the status honestly, or it will be considered fraudulent and penalties will be assessed.See 26 U.S.C. 61, Section 6013(b)(5)(B) As a taxpayer, one must withhold at least 90% of the tax burden for the year and should make sure to withhold enough to avoid penalties.

She was sighted by crew aboard Penelope slightly before midnight, heading northeast. Blackwood ordered an immediate pursuit and sent word via Minorca to the rest of the fleet. A first broadside was fired at about 1am, but Guillaume Tell continued on her course without returning fire. By dawn, Penelope had again drawn within range of the larger French vessel, and Blackwood ordered a continued raking fire which brought down Guillaume Tells main and mizzen topmasts. Penelopes sister ships Lion and Foudroyant hove into view shortly afterward, and engaged Guillaume Tell at close range, disabling her rigging and causing damage to her hull. Both British ships were badly damaged by the time Guillaume Tell struck her colours, and it was Penelope that took the French ship in tow and led her as a prize to Syracuse. Penelope lost two killed and two wounded in the battle. Blackwood was later commended for his gallantry and perseverance in initially engaging the French ship despite her larger size and firepower.Chatterton 1967, p.109 , , Penelope, , and the brig shared in the proceeds of the French polacca Vengeance, captured entering Valletta, Malta on 6 April. Because Penelope served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (2 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants.

HMS Penelope is seen raking the Guillaume Tell as the two ships of the line close in Fate On 30 April 1815, Penelope, under James Galloway, ran aground near the Cap des Rosiers, British North America. She broke apart during the night, killing at least 40 of her crew. Many survivors subsequently froze to death. In all, 216 men drowned or froze to death. Sixty-six men and two women reached Douglastown two days later. The subsequent court-martial placed the master at the bottom of the list of seniority for failing to pay attention to the situation of the ship. Galloway and his First Lieutenant were reprimanded for the breakdown of discipline on board and on shore during the disaster; neither was employed again. One seaman received 500 lashes for insubordination, desertion, and being drunk. Some 48 men took the opportunity to desert.Hepper (1994), pp.153-4.

For each school maximum of 12 students are chosen. More information about eligibility criteria can be found on the admission website of Aalto University. It is possible to apply for the IDBM program through more than one Aalto University school, if the applicants fulfill the field-specific eligibility criteria. In such a case an applicant should deliver the appropriate application package for each school. Such an applicant, however, can be selected only through one of the Aalto University schools. An accepted student completes the master's degree of the school which he/she is accepted to.  IDBM as a minor  The IDBM is also offered as a minor study entity. The IDBM minor program is 24-40 ECTS credit study entity for master level students. The program is a joint offering of the Aalto University School of Business, the School of Arts, Design and Architecture and the School of Science. The program emphasizes the importance of design as a competitive factor, linked with state-of-the-art technology and business models. The IDBM minor program is mainly meant for the students of Aalto University but students from other Finnish universities are also warmly welcomed. Prerequisites for being accepted to the program are 150 cr studies, an interest in multidisciplinary teamwork and the possibility to follow through a very intense program.  IDBM research areas  In addition to mastering the graduate-level program and practice-based industry projects, IDBM has carried out its own research and participated in the development of the international community in design management research. Since the beginning of the Program, different research activities have emerged, including numerous master theses, few doctoral theses, and special reports conducted within the IDBM sphere, let alone the research components of the industry projects. The more extensive and systematic development of IDBM research activities started in 2007 as part of the wider evolution towards the new version of IDBM within the incipient Aalto University. Since that IDBM has been able to substantially increase its research activities, as a number of new externally funded projects have been initiated and conducted. The collection of recent IDBM publications consists of around 60 articles in journals, conferences, books, and other media. In line with the generic goals of the Program, IDBM research has the aim to generate systemic and multidisciplinary knowledge applicable to global business development that is design- and technology-intensive. IDBM functions at the intersection of disciplines, integrating relevant parts of existing disciplinary views and epistemologies, and developing new theoretical and empirical perspectives on the multidisciplinary interaction. IDBM research is strongly based on empirical data and industry interaction. It nurtures an explorative, creative, and open-minded approach in order to be agile and reactive towards emerging phenomena within design and creative industries.  Industry Projects  The students in the IDBM programme offer their knowledge in the form of industry projects. Since 2010, some 10-12 projects have been completed per annum within the IDBM program; many for leading Finnish or international companies. Each project is completed by teams of 3 to 5 students representing the School of Art, Design and Architecture, the School of Business and the School of Science. An expert is chosen to supervise the progress of the project. The projects are confidential; if necessary, the students and the supervisors will sign a non-disclosure agreement. The project topics have dealt with new product concepts (design and user interface issues), the definition of customer needs and the future environment of a product, the analysis of markets and customer feedback, and the examination of corporate identity, communications and design management, among other things. Usually the duration of the industry project is one academic year (from September to May). A project can also be completed within a tighter schedule if necessary. In the industry projects, the company involved is able to come into contact with young, innovative students and to obtain first-hand information on the most recent research and training in the field. During the course of the project, the company also has an opportunity to evaluate the students in view of possible future collaboration.

It examines India's family planning program centered on the gender it primarily affects: women.  Plot  While examining India's family planning or population control programs, it also focuses on the coerced sterilizations (done by tubal ligation) of women in India and on the opinions of Indian women of these programs and the traditional family life of Indian women. The film documents the state of reproductive rights for women in India that juxtaposes the detachment of science next to a new form of oppression for women.Something like a War is a film about reproductive rights, especially women's reproductive rights, in India. The film includes footage of a group of women discussing their sexuality and motherhood. The discussions between these women emphasize the challenges women face to be valued for more than their reproductive role. One woman states that they (women) are valued only for their womb, and only if their womb produces a boy. Women in India are objectified by their sexuality and ability to reproduce. This often forces women to hide their sexuality. Once women are able to reproduce they are married off and expected to have children, often at a very young age. While there is pressure from families to have children, the government also exerts pressure to limit the reproduction of low-income, Dalit and Mulsim women. This often forces women to feel ashamed and hide their menstruation. One scene shows a woman describing her first time menstruating, stating that a friend told her to hide this, to do so she should shove sand between her legs. Deepa Dhanraj is a world renowned filmmaker that has been involved with the women's rights movement since 1980. She founded Yugantar, a Bangalore-based film collective that mainly focuses on producing films about women's labor and domestic conditions in the southern parts of India. With over three decades of experience with filmography she has produced award-winning films such as Enough of this Silence (2008), and The Advocate (2007). Her film Something Like a War depicts gender and class violence of the population control policies enforced by the Indian government.

Armand Bayou Nature Center -- Entrance Sculpture A nature center (or nature centre) is an organization with a visitor center or interpretive center designed to educate people about nature and the environment. Usually located within a protected open space, nature centers often have trails through their property. Some are located within a state or city park, and some have special gardens or an arboretum. Their properties can be characterized as nature preserves and wildlife sanctuaries. Nature centers generally display small live animals, such as reptiles, rodents, insects, or fish. There are often museum exhibits and displays about natural history, or preserved mounted animals or nature dioramas. Nature centers are staffed by paid or volunteer naturalists and most offer educational programs to the general public, as well as summer camp, after-school and school group programs. Some nature centers allow free admission but collect voluntary donations in order to help offset expenses. They usually rely on support from dedicated volunteers. Environmental education centers differ from nature centers in that their museum exhibits and education programs are available mostly by appointment, although casual visitors may be allowed to walk on their grounds. Some city, state and national parks have facilities similar to nature centers, such as museum exhibits, dioramas and trails, and some offer park nature education programs, usually presented by a park ranger.

It is located at 101 Museum Drive on the grounds of the park surrounding the Mariners' Museum and is accredited with the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). It was formed in 1962 as the Peninsula Arts Association (PAA) by a group of Hampton Roads art supporters. The first official exhibit, staged in 1962, was a visit from a Virginia Museum Artmobile. It has moved and grown in size over the course of its 57 years to become one of the premier arts advocates in the area. It's one of less than 15 non-collecting art centers accredited by the AAM. The Peninsula Fine Arts Center offers innovative approaches to creating, exploring, and presenting the arts to students of all ages. In addition to providing an outlet for art exhibitions and performances, PFAC offers studio art classes and a variety of educational outreach programs to schools and throughout the community. The Peninsula Fine Arts Center maintains a permanent \\"Hands On For Kids\\" gallery designed for children and families to interact in what the Center describes as \\"a fun, educational environment that encourages participation with art materials and concepts.\\" Early years (1962-1980) The PAA was originally housed in downtown Newport News in the former John W. Daniel School Building. The first official exhibit was staged in 1962. Before having venues, founders shared works of art hanging from clothes lines in their backyards. In 1964, PAA was moved onto the campus of Christopher Newport College before moving again to Hilton Village and later, Newmarket South Shopping Center. Major exhibitions that were too large for these venues were held in the Mariners‚Äô Museum. The PAA received a significant gift in 1975 that would prove to shape its future and help it establish independence when Newport News Shipbuilding donated its former hydraulics testing laboratory. The lab was located on two acres of land in Mariners‚Äô Museum Park across from the Mariners‚Äô Museum. Following an intense renovation financed by community supporters, the PAA opened its new doors on November 5, 1978. Further remodeling provided studios upstairs for the use of the Art Magnet Program of the Newport News Public School System. The program allowed talented students an opportunity to develop their artistic potential. This educational model would develop into workshops for students that include informative sessions and portfolio reviews that are still in place today. Expansion, affiliation and accreditation (1981-1993) In 1983, the PAA officially became the Peninsula Fine Arts Center and was named an Affiliate of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. As the Center started receiving more attention, David L. Peebles was named Chairman of the Capital Campaign in 1985 to raise $1.5 million for a new wing for Pfac. With the successful commitment of the private and public sector, the ground-breaking ceremony was held March 14, 1988. Award-winning Williamsburg, VA architect Carlton Abbott designed the new addition. The expansion and renovation provided an addition to triple exhibition space and to develop a suitable entry area, classrooms, workshop and art handling areas with provision for security, barrier-free accessibility and state-of-the-art temperature, humidity and ventilation systems. Usable floor space increased from 4,000 square feet to over 15,000 square feet with three galleries, a hallway gallery, video gallery, four art classrooms and a meeting room. The official Grand Opening celebration of the Fine Arts Center was held on the weekend of April 30, 1989. The reception was marked by the opening of an exhibition called \\"TRIBUTARY: 3,000 Years In the Course of Art,\\" an impressive display at the new facility that would come to hold 15-20 exhibitions a year. In total, Pfac has featured nearly 500 exhibitions in its history, including annual juried shows, holiday invitationals, high school and college competitions, as well as curated shows. By 1992, as the Center celebrated its 30th Anniversary, the museum had grown into one of the most influential contemporary art organizations in Virginia. An exclusively 3-Dimensional exhibition in 1990 was praised as the most important contemporary art exhibit in the region in nearly a decade by local art critics. In 1993, the Center earned accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums, an effort that took nearly two years of self-evaluation and an in- depth report that was analyzed for months by the AAM. This is a status that PFAC continues to enjoy to this day. PFAC is truly unique because it does not own a permanent collection. This is great because it allows the organization to be ever-changing, exploring new facets of art and attracting different audiences with each exhibition. 50th anniversary The Center celebrated its semicentennial in 2012 with several exhibitions. They included a national exhibit, \\"Art and the Animal,\\" and a celebration of regional artists who have either taught or displayed work in other exhibitions at Pfac called \\"The Artists: Who We Are Past and Present.\\" The latter was a photography exhibit illustrating the history of the Center and Virginia Peninsula with a juried photo exhibition. In the summer, Pfac held its nationally-recognized \\"Biennial\\" exhibition. The anniversary year culminated with the exhibition \\"50 Great American Artists\\" (curated by Michael Preble).

The couple need not necessarily involve two individuals of opposite sexes, and often two women can be seen dancing together. Nowadays it has become rare to see two men dancing an entire pizzica.

Avril Horner and Sue Zlasnik (eds.) Valancourt Classics 2011 Barratt's comic gothic novel The Heroine, published in 1813, was an instant success. Further editions quickly followed in 1814 and 1815. Among those who praised the novel at the time was Jane Austen, who declared herself \\"very much amused by it\\" and called it \\"a delightful burlesque\\".Letter to Cassandra Austen, 2 March 1814. The Critical Review described it as \\"a very spirited and laughable satire upon the various productions and the name of the novel... which have appeared for the last 18 or 19 years.\\"Critical Review No. 4 (December 1813) pp. 623‚Äì629. Another critic praised it as \\"not inferior in wit and humour to Tristram Shandy, and in point of plot and interest infinitely beyond Don Quixote.\\"The Biographical Dictionary of the Living Authors of Great Britain and Ireland (1816).

After being neglected and out of print for almost a century, it has recently been revived by a new edition in 2011. Despite this literary success, little is known of Barrett's life. He appears to have died of tuberculosis in 1820, and yet he is mentioned as an author in a publication called The American Farmer, printed in Baltimore and dated 1823. Given his reported financial difficulties,Peel Papers Vol. LXXII; British Museum Additional MS 40,252 Folio 108 it is possible, though unproven, that he fled to America to escape his debtors. His death was recorded in The Ladies' Monthly Museum, as having taken place in Glamorgan.

Realistic job previews should provide the individuals with a well-rounded description that details what obligations the individual can expect to perform while working for that specific company. Descriptions may include, but are not limited to, work environment, expectations, and Company policies (rules, restrictions). At the heart of realistic job previews are the employee exchange or psychological contract between employer and employee. By being hired after use of the RJP, the employee enters the contract aware of what the organization will provide to them (pay, hours, schedule flexibility, culture, etc.) as well as what will be expected from them (late hours, stress, customer interaction, high urgency, degree of physical risk, etc.).  Purpose  Realistic job preview is a psychological contract between an employee and an employer. A realistic job preview/RJP is a job description that lets potential candidates know the details of the job they have applied for regarding pay, hours, schedule flexibility, and culture. The purpose of a hiring manager giving a realistic job preview is to make sure a new candidate/employee is fully aware of what the job entails. Realistic job previews help form bonds and build mutual trust with candidates, which leads to a lower turnover ratio, which is high with new hires. High turnover of new hires can occur when they are unpleasantly surprised by an aspect of their job, especially if that aspect is important to them (e.g. unpleasant working environments, inflexible schedule and unreasonable working hours). For example, if a new employee started a new job with an understanding that they wouldn't have to work weekends and then are immediately scheduled for a Saturday night, it undermines that trust and the psychological contract is breached. Better informed candidates who continue the application process are more likely to know what to expect and have the job to be a good fit while the ones who choose not to continue, save themselves time pursuing a job or company that wasn't right for them. Realistic job previews can save approximately $300,000 over a five year period if it decreases turnover of one senior staff (employee) and one (entry) lower-level employee during the span of that five years, though the savings could be much greater depending on the size of the company. Receiving a detailed RJP plays a very important role in the socialization of new employees. RJPs also help influence the behaviors and attitudes of new hires, and is crucial when a new employee is starting in a new organization. A quality realistic job preview has a bigger psychological purpose than one may think. If the expectations and promises aren't met to the employee, it can cause dissatisfaction and lead to dysfunctional organizational outcomes. For example, if a company continuously overemphasizes its benefits, job outlooks etc., it will not meet up to the expectations it had previously set for itself, thus lowering trust, which can lead to turnover.  Benefits and criticisms  The idea behind realistic job preview is to interchange unrealistic expectations about a job with realistic expectations. This is overall beneficial because it can lower the initial expectations the individual has for the job, and enhances the ability to cope with the new job. By creating a realistic job preview, individuals indirectly develop an impression of the organization being honest and open to their potentially new employees. In turn, this improves the commitment of new employees as well as their initial job satisfaction. Thus, the hiring organization saves time by interviewing only the candidates with a strong chance of success. Although many studies show that realistic job previews can also increase the drop-out rate for new candidates, other studies have shown that the effect they have on job acceptance is swayed by their job alternatives. An increased drop out rate is a good sign because it means that the realistic job preview gave them a reliable perspective on the position, and revealed that it would not have been something important enough for them to commit to. Yet, it has been shown that these effects are influenced by other job alternatives, which do not help predict job acceptance and commitment rates. Another criticism of realistic job preview is that it should not be used as a selection tool, but as a device for self-evaluation. Research has also pointed out that the nature of \\"realistic\\" information shared (in lab research or in the field) is unclear.  Creating a RJP  There are no specific outlines or rules that one needs to follow in order to create a realistic job preview; the process can be simple or complicated. Generally, one will keep in mind the positive and negative aspects of that job as well as the basic overview. A realistic job preview can include concepts of the job that inform the future employee about things like goals, objectives and salary as well as being informative on the information and expectations of what that future employee is unlikely to know. Examples of this could include, but are not limited to, what is done during this job and why. Since an RJP informs the employee about details of a specific job, communicating the challenging or messy possibilities may also be included. Balancing out the pros and cons of the job to keep the employee interested in the position without giving them false expectations can help prevent any miscommunication. RJP information is focused on the things that matter most to the candidate's demographic and parts of the job or culture that correlate with engagement and turnover. Concluding the RJP with an overall image of the company's values, while including details will give the future employee something to think about and consider, such as if the companies values align with their goals or the culture is something they would mess in senselessly with. A realistic job preview can be presented in a variety of ways. Length of the preview varies depending on the type of position the individual is applying and how it is presentation is dependent on the company, which could determine the situation at hand. Some approaches to explain the RJP are as followed: * On-The-Job Footage (real employees not actors) * Role Plays * Informative Documents * Scripted Narrative * Face-To-Face Interviews  See also  *Employee engagement *Evaluation (workplace) *Human resource management *Job interview *Leadership *On boarding *Organizational culture *Performance management *Recruitment  References  Category:Recruitment ","title":"Realistic job preview"},{"id":"13361044","text":"√âvry L√©on Schatzman (16 September 1920 - 25 April 2010) was a French scientist hailed as \\"the father of modern French astrophysics\\". Background His father, Benjamin Schatzman, was a dentist born in Tulcea, Romania, and emigrated at a young age with his family to Palestine. Schatzman began his studies at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure in November 1939. After the German invasion of France, Schatzman, who was Jewish, fled occupied France, arriving in Lyon in January 1942. He worked there for a year and then moved to Haute- Provence Observatory where he hid under the pseudonym Antoine Emile Louis Sellier. Artist's impression of debris around a white dwarf Career He was hired by the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in the fall of 1945 and received his doctorate in March 1946. He taught at Princeton University and the Copenhagen Observatory. He his mentored during his year at Princeton by Lyman Spitzer and Martin Schwarzschild and works with Bengt Str√∂mgren in Copenhagen. He starts teaching at the University of Paris in 1949, where he remained for 27 years, creating the first astrophysics chair in France. He worked for a long time at the Institut d'Astrophysique, a CNRS organization built in the garden side of l'Observatoire. During this period Schatzman also taught at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (). Schatzman became an associate professor at the University of Paris in 1954. He founded an astrophysics laboratory in Meudon in 1964, then in 1976 he moved to Nice Observatory, where he eventually became a full researcher. Schatzman retired in the fall of 1989.The Desire To Understand the World, Evry Schatzman, Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics 34 (1996), pp. 1‚Äì34. DOI 10.1146/annurev.astro.34.1.1. His daughter, mathematician Michelle Schatzman, was born in 1949. White dwarves and wave heating Schatzman worked on white dwarfs during the 1940s. He realized that the atmospheres of white dwarfs should be gravitationally stratified, with hydrogen on top and heavier elements below,Th√©orie du d√©bit d'√©nergie des naines blanches, Evry Schatzman, Annales d'Astrophysique 8 (January 1945), pp. 143‚Äì209.Physics of white dwarf stars, D. Koester and G. Chanmugam, Reports on Progress in Physics 53 (1990), pp. 837‚Äì915., ¬ß5‚Äì6 and explained pressure ionization in white dwarf atmospheres. He was one of the proponents of the wave heating theory of the solar corona.On the theory of coronal heating mechanisms, Max Kuperus, James A. Ionson, and Daniel S. Spicer, Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics 19 (1981), pp. 7‚Äì40.The heating of the solar corona and chromosphere, Evry Schatzman, Annales d'Astrophysique 12 (1949), pp. 203‚Äì218. Schatzman proposed the mechanism of magnetic braking, by which outflows slow down the stellar rotation.Mestel, L., 1968, MNRAS, 138, 359‚Äì391 Schatzman wrote the astrophysics textbook Astrophysique G√©n√©rale and contributed greatly to the popularity of astrophysics in France. He received the Prix Jules Janssen of the Soci√©t√© astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society) in 1973, the Holweck Prize in 1985, and the Gold Medal of the CNRS in 1983. He became a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1985. The CNRS recognized Schatzman as \\"the father of modern French astrophysics\\". Skepticism and political involvement Schatzman advocated throughout his career for better science education to the general public. He was Chairperson of the Union rationaliste from 1970 to 2001. In 1992 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) presented him with their Distinguished Skeptic Award. He criticized science communicators who legitimized pseudo-scientific beliefs, such as Hubert Reeves. He was a member of the Communist Party after the war. He left in 1959, in protest over Stalin's heavy-handed regime. He led a teachers' union from 1953 to 1957 and was active with the World Federation of Scientific Workers.

It is worn by both male and female astronauts. Astronauts can urinate into the MAG, and usually wait to defecate when they return to the spacecraft. However, the MAG is rarely used for this purpose, since the astronauts use the facilities of the station before EVA and also time the consumption of the in-suit water. Nonetheless, the garment provides peace of mind for the astronauts. The MAG was developed because astronauts cannot remove their space suits during long operations, such as spacewalks that usually last for several hours. Generally, three MAGs were given during space shuttle missions, one for launch, reentry, and an extra for spacewalking or for a second reentry attempt. Astronauts drink about of salty water before reentry since fewer fluids are retained in zero G. Without the extra fluids, the astronauts might faint in Earth's gravity, further highlighting the potential necessity of the MAGs. It is worn underneath the Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG). History Disposable Absorption Containment Trunk (DACT) During the Apollo era, astronauts used urine and fecal containment systems worn under spandex trunks. The fecal containment device (FCD) was a bag attached directly to the body with an adhesive seal, and the urine collection device (UCD) had a condom-like sheath attached to a tube and pouch. Women joined the astronaut corps in 1978 and required devices with similar functions. However, the early attempts to design feminized versions of the male devices were unsuccessful. In the 1980s, NASA designed space diapers which were called Disposable Absorption Containment Trunks (DACTs). These addressed the women's needs since it was comfortable, manageable, and resistant to leaks. These diapers were first used in 1983, during the first Challenger mission. Disposable underwear, first introduced in the 1960s as baby's diapers then in 1980 for adult incontinence, appealed to NASA as a more practical option. In 1988, the Maximum Absorbency Garment replaced the DACT for female astronauts. NASA created the name Maximum Absorbency Garment to avoid using trade names. Male astronauts then adapted the MAG as well. In the 1990s, NASA ordered 3,200 of the diapers of the brand name Absorbencies, manufactured by a company that has folded. In 2007, about a third of the supply remained. Usage The MAGs are pulled up like shorts. A powdery chemical absorbent called sodium polyacrylate is incorporated into the fabric of the garment. Sodium polyacrylate can absorb around 300 times its weight in distilled water. Assuming the astronaut urinates, the diaper would only need to be changed every eight to ten hours. The MAG can hold a maximum of of urine, blood, and/or feces. The MAG absorbs the liquid and pulls it away from the skin. Media attention These garments gained attention in February 2007, when astronaut Lisa Nowak drove to attack Air Force officer Colleen Shipman out of jealousy for her former lover. It was stated in a police report that Nowak said she used the diapers to avoid pit stops during her journey. However, Nowak denied these claims and testified that she did not wear these diapers during her trip.

It is a mystery novel set primarily on a fictional island, but also partly in Wrightsville, a fictional small town in the northeastern United States that figures in several Queen stories. Plot summary Munitions maker King Bendigo is the wealthiest man alive, and what the King wants, the King gets. What he wants is the investigative powers of Ellery Queen and his father, New York homicide detective Richard Queen, in order to investigate some threatening letters. Bendigo has an enormous security apparatus in place that is capable of dealing with threats that involve sovereign governments, but these threats are more personal. Ellery and his father are transported to the Bendigo private island and soon determine that the threats originate within the King's family. The King has two brothers, his assistant Abel and drunken sot Judah, and the King's beautiful wife Karla completes the list of suspects. Judah makes little secret of the fact that it is he who has originated the threats; he announces that he will shoot King at exactly midnight on June 21. At that time, King is locked in a hermetically sealed room accompanied only by his wife; Judah is under Ellery's observation and armed only with an empty gun. At midnight, Judah lifts the empty gun and fires‚Äîand King falls back, wounded with a bullet. Karla falls under suspicion but no gun is found on her person or anywhere in the room; similarly, Judah cannot have had a bullet in his possession, having been searched repeatedly. When Ellery learns that the Bendigo family is originally from his familiar haunt of Wrightsville, he travels there for an investigation of the King's early life. Upon his return to the private island, he solves the crime and dramatic and deadly effects follow in short order. Literary significance & criticism (See Ellery Queen.) After many popular mystery novels, a radio program and a number of movies, the character of Ellery Queen was at this point firmly established. The character of Djuna, the Queens' houseboy seen in earlier works, is not here present but the occasional character of their cleaning woman Mrs. Fabrikant is seen in the opening chapter set in the Queens' New York City apartment. An apparently tamed pet pigeon named Ars√®ne Lupin is also seen in the first chapter but is not seen again. This novel is the final Ellery Queen novel set in Wrightsville, but only for a chapter.

Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Larry Pressler ran for re-election to a fourth term, but was narrowly defeated by Democratic nominee Tim Johnson by 9,000 votes. Pressler was the only incumbent Senator to lose reelection in the 1996 cycle.  Candidates = Democratic  * Tim Johnson, U.S. Representative  Republican  * Larry Pressler, incumbent U.S. Senator Campaign Pressler and Johnson swapped leads in their own polls all year. The two candidates also swapped charges. Pressler said that Johnson was too liberal for the state, while Johnson contended that Pressler was beholden to the out-of-state interests that have fattened his campaign coffers. Seeking a fourth term, Pressler noted his seniority; his close ties to his longtime Senate colleague, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole; and, most emphatically, the power he wielded as the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Yet the massive changes in telecommunications law that he shepherded through the Senate since becoming chairman last year proved to be a mixed blessing politically for Pressler. Political action committees related to industries affected by the legislation were generous donors to his campaign, and Pressler assured South Dakota voters that, over the long run, the bill will lower prices and provide jobs. But both telephone and cable television rates have gone up in South Dakota this year, leading Pressler to pull an ad stating that phone rates were going down. Despite this apparently negative short-term effect, Pressler said that Johnson's votes against the \\"telecom\\" bill, along with his opposition to the GOP's seven-year balanced-budget plan and changes in farm policy, proved Johnson votes inconsistently with his moderate rhetoric. \\"You say one thing in South Dakota and vote liberal all the time in Washington,\\" intoned an announcer in a Pressler TV ad. In another ad, which Pressler called \\"the essence of my campaign,\\" the senator himself called Johnson a liberal. Johnson countered that Pressler's vote for the deficit- reducing budget-reconciliation package was a blow against the interests of farmers and seniors, two groups that helped fuel Pressler's victories in the past.

Centre Street is a historically old road, and is now a busy artery between Newton Corner and Newton Centre to the south. The house is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is fronted by a monumental two-story Greek temple portico supported by four fluted Ionic columns. The main entrance is at the center of the three-bay facade, flanked by sidelight windows and topped by an architrave with cornice. A cross-gabled section projects on the south side of the building, with a fully pedimented gable that has a half-round window at its center. The area where the house stands was originally allocated to Deacon Samuel Hyde, who was one of Newton's first settlers, arriving in 1639. Hyde and his brother laid out Centre Street.

The opening of the border gate between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic set in motion a chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer a GDR and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. The idea of opening the border at a ceremony came from Otto von Habsburg and was brought up by him to Mikl√≥s N√©meth, the then Hungarian Prime Minister, who promoted the idea.Mikl√≥s N√©meth in Interview, Austrian TV - ORF \\"Report\\", 25 June 2019. Otto von Habsburg The Pan-European Picnic itself developed from a meeting between Ferenc M√©sz√°ros of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) and the President of the Paneuropean Union Otto von Habsburg in June 1989. The local organization in Sopron took over the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the other contacts were made via Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay.Hilde Szabo: Die Berliner Mauer begann im Burgenland zu br√∂ckeln (The Berlin Wall began to crumble in Burgenland - German), in Wiener Zeitung 16 August 1999.Otmar Lahodynsky: Paneurop√§isches Picknick: Die Generalprobe f√ºr den Mauerfall (Pan-European picnic: the dress rehearsal for the fall of the Berlin Wall - German), in: Profil 9 August 2014.

August 1989 war ein Test f√ºr Gorbatschows\\" (German - 19 August 1989 was a test for Gorbachev), in: FAZ 19 August 2009. Background In 1989, the situation in Central Europe was tense. Despite dictatorial governments, the people in Eastern Bloc countries demanded democratic elections, freedom of speech, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops. The Iron Curtain and its physical manifestations in heavily guarded border fences and crossings, e.g. as seen in Czechoslovakia and in East Germany, were a dominant factor in the movement to unite Europe. Although some countries, such as East Germany, had a hard-line Communist power structure, others, such as Hungary, took a reform-oriented approach. Supported by Mikhail Gorbachev's new policies, the reformist Communist countries' leadership accepted the necessity for change (‚Üí Perestroika). Non-governmental organizations and new political parties played a sizable role in the movement towards a democratic, multiparty system. That year, round-table discussions were held in several Central European countries to develop a consensus on changing the political system. In February formal discussions began in Warsaw and on 4 April the Polish Round Table Agreement was signed, legalising Solidarity and scheduling parliamentary elections for 4 June. Solidarity's victory surpassed all expectations.. In this whole context, there were individual organizations in the west that were constantly trying to get in touch with the people in the east or to find ways to weaken the communist system. Like the Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, whose president Karl von Habsburg had been since 1986. Under his responsibility, attempts were made to sustainably support the opposition and freedom movements in Central and Eastern Europe, and the Paneuropa Union participated intensively in the political events in what was then Czechoslovakia, Hungary, then Yugoslavia and the Baltic States. But in public opinion in the West as well as in the East, nobody thought of the possibility of a quick dissolution of the communist structures in the East. The Iron Curtain was strictly guarded and fully intact until August 1989, even if individual technical systems were dismantled.Andreas R√∂dder: Deutschland einig Vaterland ‚Äì Die Geschichte der Wiedervereinigung (2009)Otmar Lahodynsky \\"Eiserner Vorhang: Picknick an der Grenze\\" in Profil, 13 Juni 2019. Developments in Hungary Beginning in 1989, Romanian citizens were filling refugee camps at the Hungarian-Romanian border near Debrecen. In the early summer of 1989, thirty to forty thousand people sought asylum in Hungary. Although the Hungarian government had been bound by a bilateral agreement to return the refugees to Romania, Hungary signed the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (CRSR) in 1989.. The financial situation was difficult in Hungary, and Prime Minister Mikl√≥s N√©meth decided that his government could not afford to maintain automated border control along the border with Austria; spare parts would come from the West and were paid for in hard currency. N√©meth believed it was no longer necessary to secure the borders; Hungarians were allowed to travel freely, and the government did not intend to continue fortifying the country's western borders. At the border between East and West Berlin several hundred people were killed, with border guards ordered to shoot escapees. The last person shot to death was Chris Gueffroy, in February 1989. East Germans, who often spent their summer holidays on Lake Balaton (where they could meet relatives and friends from West Germany), remained in Hungary during the summer of 1989. On 20 June Otto von Habsburg, heir apparent of the House of Habsburg and member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1999, addressed an audience at the university of Debrecen about Europe without borders and the European Parliament elections' impact on Central Europe. His speech was followed by a dinner, at which two representatives of the conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum party (M√°ria Filep and Ferenc M√©sz√°ros) suggested a picnic for local residents at the Austro-Hungarian border to celebrate the bonds between Austrians and Hungarians. Although the Hungarian Democratic Forum's (MDF) national leadership of the MDF had reservations, Filep (supported by local Fidesz and MDF groups) recruited participants and searched for a suitable location. She wanted to include guests at the \\"common destiny camp\\", a gathering of intellectuals and opposition activists from Central and Eastern European countries in Martonv√°s√°r (not far from Lake Balaton) scheduled to end date on 20 August. The site chosen for the picnic was on Bratislava Road in Sopron, a border crossing since 1922. The gathering was intended as an informal meeting of Austrians and Hungarians at the border meadow. Permission to open the border station for three hours was granted, so pedestrians from both countries could experience Europe without borders. Its organisers recruited Otto von Habsburg and Imre Pozsgay, a reformist member of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSzMP) and Minister of State, as patrons of the event. Former Prime Minister N√©meth explained in 1989, a 2014 documentary, that the picnic offered the Hungarian government a way out of a situation which had arisen with East German tourists holidaying in Hungary that summer: A flyer was produced, advertising the picnic with a map of the site, and was distributed to East German citizens wishing to defect to West Germany via Austria. Under East German law, citizens were required to request permission to travel to the West; they saw the picnic as an opportunity to act. The destiny of these approximately 100,000 people was the top news story in prime-time news broadcasts for several months, showing Europe the urgent need to find a suitable way out. The East German rulers, planning to celebrate the 40th birthday of East Germany on 7 October 1989, were keen to hide the problems and were silent about the mass exodus of their own people. In a re- enacted scene in Anders √òstergaard's documentary 1989, Prime Minister N√©meth tells an aide, \\"Gyuri, I think this could actually be a very good thing. I think it would be good if some of the East Germans used this opportunity and fled.\\" \\"Fled?\\" \\"Yes. And we would not interfere with it.\\" \\"I see.\\" N√©meth explained in the documentary: At the picnic several hundred East German citizens overran the old wooden gate, reaching Austria unhindered by the border guards around √Årp√°d Bella. The Hungarian borders were opened on 11 September, and the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November... Picnic events In a symbolic gesture agreed to by Austria and Hungary, a border gate on the road from Sankt Margarethen im Burgenland, Austria to Sopronk≈ëhida, Hungary was to be opened for three hours on 19 August. On 27 June Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock and his Hungarian counterpart, Gyula Horn, cut the border fence about from this spot (a symbolic act highlighting Hungary's decision to dismantle its border surveillance, which had begun on 2 May)... More than 600 East Germans fled to the West. In the run-up to the picnic, its organisers distributed pamphlets advertising the event and Hungarian border guards were ordered by the Ministry of the Interior not to intervene or carry arms; the border guards helped people to flee. In Budapest and around Lake Balaton, thousands of East Germans hesitated to cross the border. Over the next few days, the Hungarian government increased the number of guards patrolling its western border and a relatively small number of refugees reached the West. On 11 September 1989, Hungary opened its borders to citizens of East Germany and other Central European countries; this was the first time a Central European border was opened to citizens of Eastern Bloc states. A few months after the opening, more than 70,000 East Germans fled to West Germany via Hungary. Erich Honecker Prime Minister N√©meth said in 1989, \\"I was in my office all day, I was nervous, very nervous. Luckily, there was no knocking on my door by the Soviet ambassador, no telephone calls from Moscow.\\" The picnic was organised by four Hungarian opposition parties: the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Alliance of Free Democrats, Fidesz, and the Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party. Its patrons were Christian Social Union in Bavaria MEP Otto von Habsburg (head of the house of Habsburg and claimant of the Austro-Hungarian throne) and Hungarian Minister of State and reformer Imre Pozsgay. East Germany's Erich Honecker told the Daily Mirror about the picnic, \\"Habsburg distributed pamphlets right up to the Polish border, inviting East German holiday-makers to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given presents, food, and Deutsche Marks, before being persuaded to go over to the West.\\" Later developments The Hungarian government normalised border controls after the picnic. In August, 6,923 people were arrested at the border; of those, 5,527 or 80 percent were East Germans. The Hungarian government feared that laxness would lead to hard-liners assuming control in the Kremlin, leading to a coup d'√©tat against Gorbachev. During the night of 21‚Äì22 August Kurt-Werner Schulz, a 36-year-old East German from Weimar, was killed. N√©meth said later: On 22 August N√©meth flew by helicopter to Bonn to meet with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Kohl's foreign secretary, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. There, N√©meth \\"dropped a bomb on their table\\": N√©meth assured Kohl that the Hungarians would handle the border situation, and compliance by Gorbachev was unnecessary. Kohl telephoned Gorbachev, informing him of N√©meth's decision, and Gorbachov assured Kohl that the Hungarian premier \\"was a good man\\". On 11 September the border was opened, and 30,000 East Germans fled to the West. After the East German regime tried to block the Hungarian route, thousands fled to the West via Czechoslovakia and there was a massive popular uprising. On 17 October Honecker was relieved as head of state, and on 9 November the gates to West Berlin were opened. Today Pan- European Picnic monument by Mikl√≥s Melocco The picnic site is commemorated with a monument by Mikl√≥s Melocco, a bell from the city of Debrecen, a pagoda from the Association of Japanese‚ÄìHungarian Friendship, and a wooden monument unveiled by the organisers in 1991. The Pan-European Picnic is considered a significant milestone on the road to German reunification, and commemorative ceremonies are held annually on 19 August at the border. In 2009 Angela Merkel (who grew up in East Germany) attended festivities commemorating the picnic's 20th anniversary, thanking the Hungarians for their courage and foresight: \\"Two enslaved nations together broke down the walls of enslavement... and Hungarians gave wings to East Germans' desire for freedom.\\" Hungarian President L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom unveiled a white marble monument in memory of those who risked their lives to cross the Iron Curtain, and Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said: \\"We must remain an open Europe of open societies and open minds, open to others beyond our present boundaries\\".

It is a 2-1/2 story wood- frame structure, eight bays wide, with a side-gable roof and clapboard siding. The rear roof extends down to the first floor, giving the house a saltbox profile. There are two entrances on the main facade, each two bays in from a side. Both have Federal period surrounds with pilasters and a corniced entablature; the one on the left also has half-length sidelight windows. The oldest portion of the house is believed to be the southernmost three bays, which were built as a \\"half house\\" about 1736 by Ebenezer Bartlett, who owned about of land. Bartlett and his wife Anne raised seventeen children in the house, expanding it to five bays.

The twelfth and last poem in the collection known as The Lais of Marie de France, it appears in the manuscript Harley 978 at the British Library. Like the other poems in this collection, \\"Eliduc\\" is written in the Anglo-Norman dialect of Old French, in couplets of eight syllables in length. At 1184 lines, it is the longest of the lais attributed to Marie de France. The text of the lai notes that its correct title should be Guildeluec and Guilliadon, but the name Eliduc has stuck. Plot summary \\"Eliduc\\" tells the story of a knight named Eliduc who lives in Brittany. Because he is very loyal to the king, Eliduc is given many gifts and responsibilities. Jealous of the preferential treatment Eliduc receives at court, some of the other knights slander him to the king. The king banishes Eliduc from his presence with no explanation. Disappointed, Eliduc decides to leave Brittany and go to Logres (Great Britain). He leaves his faithful wife, Guildeluec, in charge of his lands while he is abroad. Once in Logres, Eliduc hears about a king who lives near Exeter. This king does not have a son, and he is being besieged by another king who wishes to marry his daughter. Eliduc decides to fight for the king and he ultimately helps him win against his enemy. Eliduc soon attracts the attention of the princess, Guilliadon, who decides to send him two tokens of love: a belt and a ring. Eliduc accepts these gifts, and the love of the princess, in spite of his marriage. Eliduc and Guilliadon live happily for some time until word reaches him that his former king in Brittany needs him. Eliduc leaves Logres, and Guilliadon asks to accompany him. Instead, Eliduc convinces her to set a date for his return. Eliduc returns to his king and wife in Brittany. Although he tries to hide his pain of the separation from Guilliadon, she realizes that something is wrong. When the date arrives for him to return to Guilliadon, he goes to Logres with the intention of running off with his lover. Eliduc sends his chamberlain to Guilliadon who agrees to leave with Eliduc. Once the boat leaves port, however, a tempest begins to rage. One of the sailors blames Eliduc, and Guilliadon finally learns that Eliduc has a wife in Brittany. Distraught, she faints. Thinking Guilliadon has died, Eliduc tosses overboard the sailor who accused him, and the storm subsides. When they finally reach land, Eliduc decides to go to a chapel deep in the woods where he will bury Guilliadon. He goes to visit a hermit he knows near the site, but the hermit has recently died. Eliduc's comrades want to leave Guilliadon in the tomb with the hermit, but Eliduc resists, claiming he still wants to build an abbey or church there. He leaves Guilliadon in the hermit's chapel and returns to his wife to think about the plans for his abbey. Guildeluec is happy to see her husband but soon realizes that his mind is elsewhere. She has one of her servants follow Eliduc one day when he goes to the chapel to visit Guilliadon's body. Guildeluec soon follows to discover the source of her husband's sorrow. Seeing the young woman, Guildeluec understands immediately that this is her husband's lover; and she mourns the young woman. Two weasels run into the chapel. When the servant kills one of the weasels (both female, metaphorically representing the two women), the other one runs into the forest to find a magical flower that revives him. Seeing this, Guildeluec takes the flower from the weasel and uses it to heal Guilliadon. Not knowing that the woman she sees is Eliduc's wife, Guilliadon immediately explains her story, confessing that she did not know that Eliduc was married. Guildeluec reveals her identity and forgives Guilliadon. The two women return to Eliduc who is overwhelmed with joy at the sight of his lover. Noticing this, Guildeluec generously decides to become the abbess of Eliduc's proposed abbey in the forest and frees Eliduc of his marital bond. Eliduc goes on to marry Guilliadon and lives happily for many years. Later in life, Guilliadon enters into the convent of Eliduc's first wife, and Eliduc himself enters into a monastery. All three serve God for the rest of their lives. Analysis and significance \\"Eliduc\\" is one of several of Marie's lais dealing with adultery and the importance of fidelity in love. It has been speculated that Marie arranged her poems as they appear in MS H in order to pair a short, tragic poem with a longer one on the power of love and the importance of fidelity. If this is true, \\"Eliduc\\"'s may be compared with the previous poem, \\"Chevrefoil\\", a short lai about the adulterous love of Tristan and Iseult that eventually caused the lovers' deaths.The Lais of Marie de France, p. 14. The incident on the boat alludes to the Biblical account of Jonah. God sends a tempest to punish Jonah for his disobedience. However, in the Bible, it is the offender who is thrown overboard and not the accuser. In the Middle Ages, the weasel was believed to be skilled in medicine and have the ability to heal death.Medieval Bestiary : Weasel Though \\"Eliduc\\" does not have any overt connections to the Arthurian legend, Guilliadon's home, Logres, is traditionally the name given to King Arthur's realm. Additionally, characters named \\"Aliduke\\" or other variations on Eliduc appear in Arthurian stories.Bruce, The Arthurian Name Dictionary, \\"Aladuke\\", p. 10. Unlike most of Marie's lais, Eliduc is not found in Old Norse translation (in the Strengleikar), but the motif of a character learning about healing plants by observing weasels appears not only there but in the Icelandic V√∂lsunga saga, which seems to indicate that Eliduc was known in Iceland in some form.Carol J.

McIlwain) is a parameter describing a particular set of planetary magnetic field lines. Colloquially, L-value often describes the set of magnetic field lines which cross the Earth's magnetic equator at a number of Earth-radii equal to the L-value. For example, \\"L=2\\" describes the set of the Earth's magnetic field lines which cross the Earth's magnetic equator two earth radii from the center of the Earth. L-shell parameters can also describe the magnetic fields of other planets. In such cases, the parameter is renormalized for that planet's radius and magnetic field model.Galileo - Glossary of Selected Terms. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, (2003). Although L-value is formally defined in terms of the Earth's true instantaneous magnetic field (or a high-order model like IGRF), it is often used to give a general picture of magnetic phenomena near the Earth, in which case it can be approximated using the dipole model of the Earth's magnetic field. Charged particle motions in a dipole field Map of L-shell field line locations on the surface of the Earth. The real terrestrial field is approximately dipolar, but misaligned with the rotation axis, and offset a few hundred km in the direction opposite to the South Atlantic Anomaly. The motions of low-energy charged particles in the Earth's magnetic field (or in any nearly-dipolar magnetic field) can be usefully described in terms of McIlwain's (B,L) coordinates, the first of which, B is just the magnitude (or length) of the magnetic field vector. This description is most valuable when the gyroradius of the charged particle orbit is small compared to the spatial scale for changes in the field. Then a charged particle will basically follow a helical path orbiting the local field line. In a local coordinate system {x,y,z} where z is along the field, the transverse motion will be nearly a circle, orbiting the \\"guiding center\\", that is the center of the orbit or the local B line, with the gyroradius and frequency characteristic of cyclotron motion for the field strength, while the simultaneous motion along z will be at nearly uniform velocity, since the component of the Lorentz force along the field line is zero. At the next level of approximation, as the particle orbits and moves along the field line, along which the field changes slowly, the radius of the orbit changes so as to keep the magnetic flux enclosed by the orbit constant. Since the Lorentz force is strictly perpendicular to the velocity, it cannot change the energy of a charged particle moving in it. Thus the particle's kinetic energy remains constant. Then so also must its speed be constant. Then it can be shown that the particle's velocity parallel to the local field must decrease if the field is increasing along its z motion, and increase if the field decreases, while the components of the velocity transverse to the field increase or decrease so as to keep the magnitude of the total velocity constant. Conservation of energy prevents the transverse velocity from increasing without limit, and eventually the longitudinal component of the velocity becomes zero, while the pitch angle, of the particle with respect to the field line, becomes 90¬∞. Then the longitudinal motion is stopped and reversed, and the particle is reflected back towards regions of weaker field, the guiding center now retracing its previous motion along the field line, with the particle's transverse velocity decreasing and its longitudinal velocity increasing.Introduction to Space Science, Robert C Haymes, Wiley & sons, 1971. Chapter 7, \\"Van Allen Radiation\\" and Chapter 9, \\"Planetary Magnetism\\" In the (approximately) dipole field of the Earth, the magnitude of the field is greatest near the magnetic poles, and least near the magnetic Equator. Thus after the particle crosses the Equator, it will again encounter regions of increasing field, until it once again stops at the magnetic mirror point, on the opposite side of the Equator. The result is that, as the particle orbits its guiding center on the field line, it bounces back and forth between the north mirror point and the south mirror point, remaining approximately on the same field line. The particle is therefore endlessly trapped, and cannot escape from the region of the Earth. Particles with too-small pitch angles may strike the top of the atmosphere if they are not mirrored before their field line reaches too close to the Earth, in which case they will eventually be scattered by atoms in the air, lose energy, and be lost from the belts.The Radiation Belt and Magnetosphere. W. N. Hess, Blaisdell Publishing Co 1968 However, for particles which mirror at safe altitudes, (in yet a further level of approximation) the fact that the field generally increases towards the center of the Earth means that the curvature on the side of the orbit nearest the Earth is somewhat greater than on the opposite side, so that the orbit has a slightly non-circular, with a (prolate) cycloidal shape, and the guiding center slowly moves perpendicular both to the field line and to the radial direction. The guiding center of the cyclotron orbit, instead of moving exactly along the field line, therefore drifts slowly east or west (depending on the sign of the charge of the particle), and the local field line connecting the two mirror points at any moment, slowly sweeps out a surface connecting them as it moves in longitude. Eventually the particle will drift entirely around the Earth, and the surface will be closed upon itself. These drift surfaces, nested like the skin of an onion, are the surfaces of constant L in the McIlwain coordinate system. They apply not only for a perfect dipole field, but also for fields that are approximately dipolar. For a given particle, as long as only the Lorentz force is involved, B and L remain constant and particles can be trapped indefinitely. Use of (B,L) coordinates provides us with a way of mapping the real, non-dipolar terrestrial or planetary field into coordinates that behave essentially like those of a perfect dipole. The L parameter is traditionally labeled in Earth- radii, of the point where the shell crosses the magnetic Equator, of the equivalent dipole. B is measured in gauss. Equation for L in a Dipole Magnetic Field In a centered dipole magnetic field model, the path along a given L shell can be described as r = L\\\\cos^2\\\\lambda where r is the radial distance (in planetary radii) to a point on the line, \\\\lambda is its geomagnetic latitude, and L is the L-shell of interest. L-shells on Earth For the Earth, L-shells uniquely define regions of particular geophysical interest. Certain physical phenomena occur in the ionosphere and magnetosphere at characteristic L-shells. For instance, auroral light displays are most common around L=6, can reach L=4 during moderate disturbances, and during the most severe geomagnetic storms, may approach L=2. The Van Allen radiation belts roughly correspond to L=1.5-2.5, and L=4-6. The plasmapause is typically around L=5. L-shells on Jupiter The Jovian magnetic field is the strongest planetary field in the solar system. Its magnetic field traps electrons with energies greater than 500 MeV Jupiter‚Äôs radio spectrum from 74 MHz up to 8 GHz. Imke de Pater et al. Icarus, Volume 163, Issue 2, June 2003, Pages 434-448. The characteristic L-shells are L=6, where electron distribution undergoes a marked hardening (increase of energy), and L=20-50, where the electron energy decreases to the VHF regime and the magnetosphere eventually gives way to the solar wind. Because Jupiter's trapped electrons contain so much energy, they more easily diffuse across L-shells than trapped electrons in Earth's magnetic field. One consequence of this is a more continuous and smoothly-varying radio-spectrum emitted by trapped electrons in gyro- resonance.

In the latter part of the first decade of the 21st century, the club established an autonomous department in Campo Grande, the capital of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, as the main focus of its notable activities. In between, the club also represented the city of √Åguas de Lind√≥ia in the S√£o Paulo state hinterland. Saad EC participated from 1974 for two years in the first division of the S√£o Paulo State Championship. From 2010 the club played three seasons in the first division of Mato Grosso do Sul. The Saad women's team, established in 1985, dominated the 1990s and won practically three national championships between 1996 and 2003. Its last success was winning the first official cup competition in 2007, then lining up nominally as Mato Grosso do Sul FC. History On April 28, 1961, Saad Esporte Clube was founded by the businessman Fel√≠cio Jos√© Saad as a replacement for another club, the Associa√ß√£o Atl√©tica S√£o Bento - not to be confused with the club Associa√ß√£o Atl√©tica S√£o Bento of the city of S√£o Paulo, which existed between 1914 and 1935 - which folded in the late 1950s. In 1966 the club professionalised and in the year thereafter it ascended to the second division of the S√£o Paulo State Championship. 1974 and 1975 it played as an invitee in the first division. Until 1990, with the exception of 1989, the club played in the second division. In the last year, the club represented the city of √Åguas de Lind√≥ia in the S√£o Paulo state hinterland. The men's team was dissolved thereafter, before a revival in 2009 as MS/Saad in the second division of the Campeonato Sul-Mato-Grossense. From 2010 to 2012 the club played there in the first division. Probably the best known player in the club's history was the 16 times Brazilian international Jos√© Ribamar de Oliveira \\"Canhoteiro\\". He is generally considered one of the best left wingers of all time and ended his career with the club in 1967 aged circa 35.  Women's football  In 1985 the Campinas (SP) based Guarani FC discontinued its women's football department which then practically joined in its entirety Saad EC. In 1993 Saad became the first club in the country to offer its female athletes a minimum wage of US$ 100\\\\. The women of Saad remained unbeaten in all of their official matches from 1994 to 1996 and won in 1996 the Brazilian Women's Championship. In 1989 Saad won the Trof√©u Brasil and in 2003 the Circuito Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino, both then the highest possible achievements in Brazilian women's football. In 2007 the team of Saad EC lined up as Mato Grosso do Sul FC, based officially in the state capital Campo Grande and won the first Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino, organized by the Brazilian football association, the CBF.The official name of the participating clubs are defined in the official Regulamento da Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino de 2007 , Federa√ß√£o Tocantinense de Futebol (per 2013-09-26). In the same year Saad finished third in a tournament Liga Nacional de Futebol Feminino and which was only held in that year, with Santos FC being the winner. Saad participated in the following two years under its own name in the Copa, advancing to the eighth and quarter-finals respectively, before ceasing top level activities in women's football. In 1997, Saad Esporte Clube U17 squad finished first in the CBF (Confederacao Brasileira de Futebol) sponsored National Championship, becoming the one and only champion. Also, in the late 1990s the club was involved with a United States University women's soccer program at the National American University of Rapid City (SD), which had some second tier successes. =Achievements= * Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino: 2007 (as Mato Grosso do Sul FC) * Brazilian Women's Football Circuit: 2003 * Brazilian Women's Football Championship: 1996 * Brazil Trophy: 1989 * State Cup of S√£o Paulo: 1990 - 1995 ReferencesExternal links * Official website Category:Association football clubs established in 1961 Category:Football clubs in Mato Grosso do Sul Category:Women's football clubs in Brazil Category:1961 establishments in Brazil ","title":"Saad Esporte Clube"},{"id":"13361531","text":"Gabbiadini is an Italian surname.

Dirk apologizes the next day, telling the story of how his father had killed his mother's lover, thereby causing his over-reaction. Ellery's secretary and inamorata Nikki Porter urges him to stay involved in the situation and Nikki moves in with the Lawrences to keep an eye on things (and act as Dirk's secretary on a stalled book). Nikki soon reports that Martha actually is having a series of clandestine meetings with romantic actor Van Harrison. The meetings are arranged with innocuous envelopes that look like advertising, but with Martha's name and address written in scarlet typewriter ink. Also, the envelopes contain only a day, time and a sequential letter of the alphabet‚Äîa code that is soon linked to a New York Guidebook. By the time the meetings have progressed from \\"A\\" through to \\"W\\", Dirk has found out about the affair and followed Martha to Van's home in the suburb of Darien. He breaks in, confronts the pair and shoots them both, seriously wounding Martha, who nearly dies. Van Harrison has just enough time before he dies to leave a dying clue‚Äîusing his own blood, he writes an \\"X\\", then a \\"Y\\" on the wall, and dies. Ellery must consider the significance of this dying message and finally solves it, just as Dirk's murder trial is about to conclude. After Ellery gets a private conversation with the judge, a criminal then receives justice. Literary significance and criticism After numerous popular mystery novels, a radio program and a number of movies, the character of Ellery Queen was at this point firmly established. This novel is more frank about sexual matters than earlier Queen works (for instance, in 1942's Calamity Town, the possibility of extramarital sex is referred to entirely in euphemisms). The plot device of the \\"dying clue\\" had been used in Queen's short stories but this is the first novel that relies on such a device.

A screw- cutting lathe is a machine (specifically, a lathe) capable of cutting very accurate screw threads via single-point screw-cutting, which is the process of guiding the linear motion of the tool bit in a precisely known ratio to the rotating motion of the workpiece. This is accomplished by gearing the leadscrew (which drives the tool bit's movement) to the spindle with a certain gear ratio for each thread pitch. Every degree of spindle rotation is matched by a certain distance of linear tool travel, depending on the desired thread pitch (English or metric, fine or coarse, etc.). The name \\"screw-cutting lathe\\" carries a taxonomic qualification on its use‚Äîit is a term of historical classification rather than one of current commercial machine tool terminology. Early lathes, many centuries ago, were not adapted to screw-cutting. Later, from the Late Middle Ages until the early nineteenth century, some lathes were distinguishable as \\"screw-cutting lathes\\" because of the screw-cutting ability specially built into them. Since then, most metalworking lathes have this ability built in, but they are not called \\"screw-cutting lathes\\" in modern taxonomy. History The screw has been known for millennia. Archimedes devised the water screw, a system for raising water. Screws as mechanical fasteners date to the first century BC. Although screws were tremendously useful, the difficulty in making them prevented any widespread adoption. Early wooden screws The earliest screws tended to be made of wood, and they were whittled by hand, with or without the help of turning on a lathe with hand-controlled turning tools (chisels, knives, gouges), as accurately as the whittler could manage. It is likely that sometimes the wood blanks that they started from were tree branches (or juvenile trunks) that had been shaped by a vine wrapped helically around them while they grew. (In fact, various Romance words for \\"screw\\" come from the word root referring to vines., p. 403.) Walking sticks twisted by vines show how suggestive such sticks are of a screw. Early metal screws Early machine screws of metal, and early wood screws [screws made of metal for use in wood], were made by hand, with files used to cut the threads. One method for making fairly accurate threads was to score a rod using an inclined knife with a wrap half way around the rod, the knife being precisely angled for the proper pitch. This was one of the methods Maudslay used to make his early leadscrews., p. 40. This made the screw slow and expensive to make, and its quality highly dependent on the skill of the maker. A process for automating the manufacture of screws and improving the accuracy and consistency of the thread was needed. Earliest lathes with machine-guided toolpath for screw-cutting Lathes have been around since ancient times. Adapting them to screw-cutting is an obvious choice, but the problem of how to guide the cutting tool through the correct path was an obstacle for many centuries. Not until the late Middle Ages and early modern period did breakthroughs occur in this area; the earliest of which evidence exists today happened in the 15th century and is documented in the Mittelalterliche Hausbuch.. It incorporates slide rests and a leadscrew. Roughly contemporarily, Leonardo da Vinci drew sketches showing various screw- cutting lathes and machines, one with two leadscrews. Leonardo also shows change-gears in some of these sketches. In the succeeding three centuries, many other designs followed, especially among ornamental turners and clockmakers. These included various important concepts and impressive cleverness, but few were significantly accurate and practical to use. For example, Woodbury discusses Jacques Besson and others. They made impressive contributions to turning, but the context in which they tended to work (turning as a fine art for rich people) did not channel their contributions toward industrial uses. Henry Hindley designed and constructed a screw-cutting lathe circa 1739. It featured a plate guiding the tool and power supplied by a hand-cranked series of gears. By changing the gears, he could cut screws with different pitch. Removing a gear permitted him to make left-handed threads.Daumas, Maurice, Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers, Portman Books, London 1989 Modern screw-cutting lathes (late 18th to early 19th centuries) The first truly modern screw-cutting lathe was likely constructed by Jesse Ramsden in 1775. His device included a leadscrew, slide rest, and change gear mechanism. These form the elements of a modern (non-CNC) lathe and are in use to this day. Ramsden was able to use his first screw-cutting lathe to make even more accurate lathes. With these, he was able to make an exceptionally accurate dividing engine and in turn, some of the finest astronomical, surveying, and navigational instruments of the 18th century. Others followed. Examples were a French mechanic surnamed Senot, who in 1795 created a screw-cutting lathe capable of industrial-level production, and David Wilkinson of Vermont, who employed a slide rest in 1798. However, these inventors were soon overshadowed by Henry Maudslay, who in 1800 created a screw-cutting lathe that is frequently cited as the first. Clearly, his was not the first; however, his did become the best known, spreading to the rest of the world the winning combination of leadscrew, slide-rest, and change gears, in an arrangement practical to use and robust enough for cutting metal. These late-18th-century screw-cutting lathes represented the breakthrough development of the technology. They permitted the large-scale, industrial production of screws that were interchangeable. Standardization of threadforms (including thread angle, pitches, major diameters, pitch diameters, etc.) began immediately on the intra-company level, and by the end of the 19th century, it had been carried to the international level (although pluralities of standards still exist). In the late 19th century Henry Augustus Rowland found a need for very high precision screws in cutting diffraction gratings, so he developed a technique for making them. Present day Until the early 19th century, the notion of a screw-cutting lathe stood in contrast to the notion of a plain lathe, which lacked the parts needed to guide the cutting tool in the precise path needed to produce an accurate thread. Since the early 19th century, it has been common practice to build these parts into any general-purpose metalworking lathe; thus, the distinction between \\"plain lathe\\" and \\"screw- cutting lathe\\" does not apply to the classification of modern lathes. Instead, there are other categories, some of which bundle single-point screw-cutting capability among other capabilities (for example, regular lathes, toolroom lathes, and CNC lathes), and some of which omit single-point screw-cutting capability as irrelevant to the machines' intended purposes (for example, speed lathes and turret lathes). Today the threads of threaded fasteners (such as machine screws, wood screws, wallboard screws, and sheetmetal screws) are usually not cut via single-point screw-cutting; instead most are generated by other, faster processes, such as thread forming and rolling and cutting with die heads. The latter processes are the ones employed in modern screw machines. These machines, although they are lathes specialized for making screws, are not screw-cutting lathes in the sense of employing single-point screw-cutting.

Die Glocke (, \\"The Bell\\") was a purported top-secret Nazi scientific technological device, secret weapon, or Wunderwaffe. First described by Polish journalist and author Igor Witkowski in Prawda o Wunderwaffe (2000), it was later popularized by military journalist and author Nick Cook who associated it with Nazi occultism, antigravity and free energy research. Mainstream reviewers have criticized claims about Die Glocke as being pseudoscientific, recycled rumors, and a hoax. Die Glocke and other alleged Nazi \\"miracle weapons\\" have been dramatized in video games, television shows, and novels.  History  Polish author Igor Witkowski. In his 2001 book The Hunt for Zero Point, author Nick Cook identified claims about Die Glocke as having originated in the 2000 Polish book Prawda o Wunderwaffe (The Truth About The Wonder Weapon) by Igor Witkowski. Cook described Witkowski's claims of a device called \\"The Bell\\" engineered by Nazi scientists that was \\"a glowing, rotating contraption\\" rumored to have \\"some kind of antigravitational effect\\", be a \\"time machine\\", or part of an \\"SS antigravity program\\" for a flying saucer called the \\"Repulsine\\". Cook proposed that an SS official named Hans Kammler later secretly traded this technology to the U.S. military in exchange for his freedom. Cook's publication introduced the topic in English without critically discussing the subject. More recently, historian Eric Kurlander has discussed the topic in his 2017 book on Nazi esotericism Hitler's Monsters A Supernatural History of the Third Reich. According to reviewer Julian Strube, Kurlander \\"cites from the reservoir of post-war conspiracy theories\\" and \\"heavily relies on sensationalist accounts...mixing up contemporary sources with post-war sensationalist literature, half-truths, and fictitious accounts\\". According to Salon reviewer Kurt Kleiner, \\"It's a story that strains credulity. But unless we're after cheap laughs, our hope when we pick up a book like this is that the author will, against the odds, build a careful, reasonable and convincing case. Cook isn't that author\\". Kleiner criticized Cook's work as \\"ferreting out minor inconsistencies and odd, ambiguous details which he tries to puff up into proof\\", characterized the process of evaluating Cook's claims as \\"untangling science from pseudo-science\\", and concluded that \\"what is instructive about the book is the insight we get into how conspiracy theories seduce otherwise reasonable people\\". Skeptical author Robert Sheaffer criticized Cook's book as \\"a classic example of how to spin an exciting yarn based on almost nothing. He visits places where it is rumored that secret UFO and antigravity research is going on...and writes about what he feels and imagines, although he discovers nothing more tangible than unsubstantiated rumors\\". Sheaffer notes that claims about Die Glocke are circulated by UFOlogists and conspiracy-oriented authors such as Jim Marrs, Joseph P. Farrell, and antigravity proponent John Dering. Author Jason Colavito wrote that Witkowski's claims were \\"recycled\\" from 1960s rumors of Nazi occult science first published in Morning of the Magicians, and describes Die Glocke as \\"a device few outside of fringe culture think actually existed. In short, it looks to be a hoax, or at least a wild exaggeration\\". Author Brian Dunning states that Morning of the Magicians helped promote belief in Die Glocke and Nazi occultism, and its absence in the historical record make it \\"increasingly unlikely that anything like it actually existed\\". According to Dunning, \\"all we have in the way of evidence is a third-hand anecdotal account of something that's desperately implausible, backed up by neither evidence nor even a corroborating account\\". Author and historian Robert F. Dorr characterizes Die Glocke as among \\"the most imaginative of the conspiracy theories\\" that arose in post-World War II years, and typical of the fantasies of magical German weapons often popularized in pulp magazines such as The Police Gazette. Some theories circulating on Internet conspiracy sites claim that Die Glocke is located in a Nazi gold train that is buried in a tunnel beneath a mountain in Poland. Duncan Roads, editor of Nexus magazine, has pointed out that the \\"Nazis on the Moon trope\\" is linked to wild speculations about Nazi anti- gravitational technology, such as Witkowski's Die Glocke. Journalist Patrick J. Kiger wrote that German propaganda of fictional Wunderwaffen combined with the secrecy surrounding actual advanced technology such as the V-2 rocket captured at war's end by the U.S. military helped spawn \\"sensational book- length exposes, web sites, and legions of enthusiasts who revel in rumors of science fiction-like weapons supposedly invented by Hitler‚Äôs scientists\\". According to Kiger, Die Glocke is a popular example of such legends and speculation, citing former aerospace scientist David Myhra's contention that if antigravity devices actually existed, the Germans, desperate to stop the Allies' advance, would have used them.

Mostly active in the 1970s, Phase 2 is generally credited with originating the \\"bubble letter\\" style of aerosol writing, also known as \\"softies\\".  Early life  Born to the late John Thomas Marrow and Adele C. Marrow. He was a native of The Bronx, and attended DeWitt Clinton High School. Many famous graffiti writers of the early 1970s would meet at a doughnut shop across from the school before heading down to the 149th Street‚ÄìGrand Concourse station to watch tagged trains on the IRT subway lines pass.Castleman, p85. He began writing in late 1971 under the name Phase 2. Part of the appeal of aerosol writing for Phase 2 was that it allowed him to get his \\"name\\" known, yet remain anonymous. He noted later that tagging provided disadvantaged urban teens \\"the only significant vehicle to represent their existence.\\"  Career  Example of a PHASE 2 piece on a subway car, utilizing the bubble letter style. In late 1972, Phase 2 first used an early version of the \\"bubble letter\\" or \\"softie\\", a style of writing which would become extremely influential and is considered a \\"giant leap\\" in the art form. The puffed-out, marshmallow-like letters drawn by Phase 2 were soon copied by other artists who added their own variations. Phase 2 quickly embellished on his original form, creating and naming dozens of varieties of softies, such as \\"phasemagorical phantastic\\" (bubble letters with stars), \\"bubble cloud\\", and \\"bubble drip\\".Castleman, p56. He described the thrill of tagging subway cars as \\"impact expressionalism\\". He is also credited with having pioneered the use of arrows in graffiti writing around this same time. Hip-hop journalist Jeff Chang has noted that Phase 2's canvasses from 1973 have \\"been widely recognized as defining the early genre.\\"Chang, p153. Over time Phase's work become more complex, moving away from the simple tags of the early 1970s to \\"hieroglyphical calligraphic abstraction.\\" In 1975, he joined the newly created United Graffiti Artists, a professional aerosol writer collective that began to attract media attention. He was featured in an essay on graffiti art by Richard Goldstein, which appeared in New York magazine. In 1986, Phase 2 became the art director of International Get Hip Times, the first 'zine about aerosol culture. Phase participated in hip-hop shows organized by Kool Lady Blue during the summer of 1982 at The Roxy in Chelsea, Manhattan. These shows brought together the top DJ's, rappers, break-dancers, and aerosol artists from the South Bronx and introduced hip-hop music and culture to the downtown punk and new wave scenes. Phase 2 designed the flyers for these events and often created aerosol pieces live on stage.Chang, 174. He was also part of the first \\"international\\" hip-hop tour when stars from the Roxy performances toured in England and France.Chang, 182-84. In 1982, as part of his involvement with the Roxy scene, Phase 2 released two rap singles. \\"Beach Boy\\" was a collaboration with Barry Michael Cooper, who later wrote the script for New Jack City. \\"The Roxy\\" featured the Bill Laswell-led group, Material, and Grand Mixer DXT. Phase 2 was also a b-boy and claimed that his dance crew pioneered the uprock (or \\"battle rock\\") style of dance, despite claims that it originated in Brooklyn. Along with Michael Holman, Phase 2 helped form the pioneering break dance crew, The New York City Breakers, and gave the crew their name. Phase 2 made numerous flyers for Holman's hip hop events and many other hip hop events, and was the first person to use the term \\"hip hop\\" on a flyer. Holman: \\"Phase 2 was a good friend and a good person who cared deeply for other people and the culture (hip hop, aerosol/graffiti) he was greatly responsible for creating. He spent a lot of time educating people like me who were eager to learn more about hip hop culture, back in the early 1980s. He will be missed, dearly.\\" Phase 2 was the first to create a large-scale, three- dimensional graffiti/aerosol sculpture. The piece stood over 6 feet high and was made of brushed steel. The sculpture stood for years in the Jacob Javits Center. It was accidentally removed and destroyed during a reconstruction of the center. Though he did not have a role in the production, Phase 2 did apparently influence the classic early hip-hop movie Wild Style. In the DVD commentary for the film, director Charlie Ahearn explained that, when thinking about the key character named \\"Phade\\", he had Phase 2 in mind. The role was played by Fab 5 Freddy, also a graffiti artist. Phase 2 later worked as a consultant on the 1984 movie, Beat Street.

The screenplay is an updated version of the George Cukor-directed 1939 film of the same name based on a 1936 play by Clare Boothe Luce. Though a commercial success, The Women was panned by critics. Plot Clothing designer Mary Haines lives in a beautiful suburban Connecticut home with her wealthy financier husband Steven and their 11-year-old daughter Molly. Her best friend since college, Sylvie Fowler, is the editor of a prominent fashion magazine that dictates the latest in taste and style for New York City fashionistas. When Sylvie learns Steven is involved with Crystal Allen, a perfume salesgirl in Saks Fifth Avenue, from chatty manicurist Tanya, she confides in the ever-pregnant Edie Cohen but hesitates to tell Mary, who discovers the news from the same woman after getting a manicure herself. Despite her mother Catherine's exhortation to keep quiet about what she knows, Mary confronts Crystal first, in a lingerie store, and then Steven, before asking for a divorce. Sylvie, Edie, and writer Alex Fisher join forces to support their spurned friend, but complications arise when Sylvie, facing the loss of her job, conspires with local gossip columnist Bailey Smith by confirming Mary's marital woes in exchange for Bailey contributing a celebrity profile to the magazine. Mary is stunned by Sylvie's betrayal and ends their friendship. Mary's daughter begins to ditch school and confides in Sylvie because her mother, distracted by the upheavals in her once idyllic life, becomes more distant. Mary is fired from her job by her father, has a makeover, and decides to open her own clothing design firm with some financial assistance from Catherine. As she begins to get her life in order, she makes an effort to bond with Molly, who reveals her father's relationship with Crystal is unraveling, and reunites with Sylvie, who has quit her job. With this knowledge in hand, Mary sets out to repair her fractured marriage as she prepares to unveil her new line of womenswear in a fashion show attended not only by boutique owners but the buyer from Saks as well. Sylvie tells Mary that she has met a guy and is thinking of giving him her real phone number. Edie's water breaks and she has a baby boy. Mary receives a call from her husband and is encouraged by the others to answer it; she then arranges a date with him. In the end, we see that a magazine titled Sylvie is published with the four friends on the cover and Alex's book is out. A hint is given about Crystal's possibly going out with Alex's ex-girlfriend Natasha. The women talk about the magazine, the book and the joys, heartaches and uniquely special triumphs of being a woman. CastProduction In The Women: The Legacy, a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, Diane English discusses her fifteen-year-long struggle to bring a contemporary version of the 1939 classic film to the screen. She wanted to present a version in which the female characters were strong and self-reliant and supported and defended each other rather than resort to treachery and catty remarks to achieve their goals. Since the concept of women going to Reno in search of a divorce is archaic, she needed to eliminate this aspect of the original plot from her treatment, which necessitated deleting several characters from the story. One character that is not in its original form is Lucy, who in the play and original movie runs the ranch in Reno, here she is seen as Mary's dog. English wrote the first screenplay in 1993 during hiatus from Murphy Brown. The following year, Julia Roberts and Meg Ryan agreed to co-produce and star, with James L. Brooks as director and a supporting cast including Blythe Danner, Marisa Tomei, Debi Mazar, and Candice Bergen. In 1996, the first table reading of the script was held at Sony Pictures. Despite the enthusiasm of everyone involved, the project stalled when Roberts and Ryan decided they wanted to play the same role. English spent the following year revising the screenplay, during which time Brooks dropped out to direct As Good as It Gets. Roberts also lost interest and moved on. English first entertained the idea of directing the film herself in 2001. Over the next few years, Sandra Bullock, Ashley Judd, Uma Thurman, Whitney Houston, and Queen Latifah were among those to express interest, although none were attached officially. After being turned down by every major Hollywood studio, English decided to develop the project as an independent film and approached Victoria Pearman, the president of Mick Jagger's production company, Jagged Films, who agreed to produce the film for Picturehouse. Pearman offered some plot suggestions, and English put the finishing touches on the seventh and final draft of the script. Upon the film's completion, it was shown to executives at Warner Bros., which had absorbed Picturehouse in the interim. Unimpressed, they put the film on the back burner until the box office success of Sex and the City convinced them there was an audience for an all-female film.Entertainment Weekly, September 5, 2008, pp. 46‚Äì49 The film was shot on location in New York City and various cities in Massachusetts.http://hookedonhouses.net/2010/04/25/for-sale-the- colonial-revival-house-used-in-the-women/ As with the play and 1939 film, English was careful to make sure no men appear on screen, even in long shots and crowd scenes.

He was described as the spiritual father of Berberism (\\"Dda Moh\\"), and a strong supporter of the revival of the Tamazight culture. Biography Mohand Arav was part, as soon as 1963, of the early movement that led to the rise of the National Liberation Front. He had published Happy The Martyrs Who Have Seen Nothing in 1963 in which he documented his war experience against the French. This book earned him the death penalty by the Ahmed Ben Bella administration. More precisely, he wrote explicitly how Ramdane Abbane (one of the historic leaders of the Algerian movement) was murdered by Abdelhafid Boussouf, and not killed in combat.Hsain Ilahiane, Historical Dictionary of the Berbers (Imazighen), Rowman & Littlefield, 27 March 2017 In 1965, he fled to France. Along with individuals including Taos Amrouche, Mohammed Arkoun, Abdelkader Rahmani, Mohand Sa√Ød Hanouz, he cofounded the Academie Berbere in Paris in 1966 and the designer of the modern Berber flag. In 1969, he organized the first Berber music concert, and launched a Berber-focused magazine, Imazigh√®ne. That year, the Academie Berbere became Agraw Imazighen. In 1978, following diplomatic pressure from Algeria, France asked Mohand Arav to leave the country. He dissolved the Academie Berbere and settled in the Isle of Wight. In 1997, he returned to Algeria, his last trip to his home country before passing away on 1 January 2002.

PowerTOP analyzes the programs, device drivers, and kernel options running on a computer based on the Linux and Solaris operating systems, and estimates the power consumption resulting from their use. This information may be used to pinpoint software that results in excessive power use. This is particularly useful for laptop computer users who wish to prolong battery life, and data center operators, for whom electrical and cooling costs are a major expenditure. Usage The original focus was on CPU sleep states, and showing the programs or drivers responsible for \\"wakeups\\" which prevent CPUs entering sleep states. A database of known problems automatically provides more user friendly \\"tips\\" for specific sources of wakeups. However, it also shows information on CPU frequency scaling.

Gurvis, directed by Robert Deubel, and starring Julia Montgomery, Suzanne Barnes, Rutanya Alda, and Hal Holbrook. The film focuses on a group of college coeds who are targeted by a killer in a bear mascot costume during an all- night scavenger hunt on their campus. Shot at Upsala College in New Jersey, the film received a small regional theatrical release under the alternate title The Scaremaker in December 1982, before being subsequently released under the better-known Girls Nite Out title in 1983. Plot At Weston Hills Sanitarium in rural Ohio, psychiatric patient Dickie Cavanaugh commits suicide by hanging himself. Cavanaugh's sister gives permission to two gravediggers to bury the body. While the two men are digging the hole for Cavanaugh's body, they are attacked and murdered by an unseen killer who throws their corpses into the burial plot. Meanwhile, at nearby DeWitt University, the basketball team wins a championship game, and as a result, an all-night scavenger hunt will take place the next evening for the female students. Lynn and her boyfriend-star player Teddy Ratliff celebrate the victory at the campus diner, and the waitress Barney is thrilled for the team. Lynn, Teddy, and other students attend a party that evening, where the story of Dickie circulates among freshmen who are unaware of his recent death; they are told that Cavanaugh murdered his girlfriend Patty in a jealous rage and is locked away in the sanitarium. Lynn becomes jealous over Teddy's attraction to Dawn Sorenson and misfit Mike Pryor gets into a fight with his girlfriend Sheila. Soon, school mascot Michael Benson is stabbed in his dorm room after arriving back from the party, and his bear mascot costume is stolen by the killer. The following day, Mike Pryor is questioned by campus security officer Jim MacVey over the fight with his girlfriend; MacVey's daughter Patty was Dickie Cavanaugh's girlfriend. Later that evening, the campus radio DJ broadcasts the clues to the scavenger hunt, which are received by the girls on their portable radios. Meanwhile, the killer who is dressed in the bear costume, is armed with serrated knives mimicking bear claws. Jane enters the girls' locker room and locates the first item of the hunt, only to be attacked from behind by the killer, who brutally slashes her throat while calling her misogynistic slurs. Shortly after, Kathy discovers Jane's body crudely strung up in the locker room showers. Kathy tries to flee before also having her throat slashed. The DJ at the radio station begins receiving phone calls from the killer, who tallies his victims; the killer also calls officer MacVey and claims to be Dickie Cavanaugh. Sheila goes down to the pond to search for another item and runs into the bear-clad killer, whom she believes to be Benson. Teasing him, she goes into an abandoned shed by the pond. While inside the shed, the killer smashes their hand through the window, slashing Sheila's throat. Meanwhile, Lynn continues searching for items on the scavenger hunt, while Teddy visits Dawn at her apartment, where the two have sex. Lynn's friend Leslie goes to search for an item in the attic of the old chapel, where she is murdered and her body is discovered by Lynn. After calling, the police arrive and find all of the bodies, where they are suspicious of Mike Pryor and question several of the students. Dawn gets into an argument with her boyfriend, who kicks her out of their house after he tells her he knows about her affair with Teddy. Officer MacVey studies the phone calls placed to the radio station as well as files and photographs of Dickie Cavanaugh, whose death he became aware of by Dickie's doctor. On her way home, Dawn senses that someone is following her and makes a call from the cafeteria payphone to Teddy's house, where he is consoling Lynn. Teddy leaves Lynn to get Dawn, and finds her bloodily wounded in the cafeteria. As Teddy is comforting her, he is stabbed by Barney, who reveals herself as the killer. Officer MacVey enters the cafeteria and confronts Barney, whom he addresses as Dickie's twin sister, Katie Cavanaugh. Katie, apparently suffering from dissociative identity disorder, responds to MacVey in alternating voices, claiming to be Dickie. After MacVey tells Katie that Dickie is dead, she reverts, and calmly tells him that Dickie is not dead, and that she brought him home from the hospital. She opens the freezer, displaying Dickie's frozen body clothed in a wheelchair and with the bear-claw weapon in his hand. CastProduction=Filming Girls Nite Out was shot in early 1982 in Dobbs Ferry, New York, and at Upsala College in East Orange, New Jersey. Director Deubel had previously worked as a documentarian, while the film's producers, Anthony N. Gurvis and Kevin Kurgis, were two attorneys from Ohio who helped finance the film. According to actress Rutanya Alda, the principal film shoot spanned a period of only three days due to budgetary and location restrictions, and most scenes were shot in one to two takes. Due to the fact that the film was shot on a real college campus, the filmmakers were forced to shoot over a weekend. The shoot began on a Friday and concluded on a Sunday, meaning the cast and crew had to work for twenty- four-hour intervals. Alda stated that the final shot of the film in which Dickie's corpse is revealed freezer (which Alda herself played) was shot after the principal shoot. In a 2013 interview, Alda claimed that the producers of the film still owed her $5,000 for her work that they never paid her for. Music The film soundtrack is composed of several oldies hits by The Lovin' Spoonful, The Ohio Express, 1910 Fruitgum Co., John Fred & The Playboy Band and others. Release The film first received a regional theatrical release under the title The Scaremaker on December 3, 1982 in several Southern U.S. cities, such as Jackson, Tennessee and Clarksville, Mississippi. The film continued to screen regionally under this title through early 1983, as a double bill with Blood Beach. It was re-released in late 1983 under the title Girls Nite Out, opening under this title in Detroit, Michigan on October 8, 1983 as a double bill with Pieces (1982). In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the film was released in December 1986, with twenty-two seconds excised from the original cut.  Critical response  Variety described the film as \\"a routine slasher picture, offering little entertainment...\\" Scott Cain of The Atlanta Constitution wrote that the film \\"has all the predictable ingredients... There must be 50 supporting roles and, as a consequence, none of the characters has much chance to make a favorable impression.\\" Mike Hughes of the Hattiesburg American wrote: \\"By horror standards, it's almost adequate... Where they failedthoroughlywas in their frequent passes at campus humor... Where they succeeded was in filming the story smoothly and giving it a solid cast.\\" In a 1998 review, the Blockbuster Entertainment Guide to Movies and Videos awarded the film two out of four stars. There have been numerous retrospective reviews of the film published after its initial release. Online movie guide AllMovie awarded the film two out of five stars, writing: \\"Girls Nite Out might be one of the most forgettable of the early '80s slashers\\", calling it \\"dull\\" and \\"routine\\". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk in 2005, called the film a \\"poor excuse for entertainment holds the grand distinction of hosting two members of the Holbrook family (Hal and son David) as part of its cast,\\" also criticizing the lack of variety among the murder scenes, and adding: \\"In the end, when the slayer is revealed, we rest easier knowing that it takes a certain strangled mindset to turn serial killer and that we are safe‚Äîat least for now. Girls Nite Out offers none of this nuance. Instead, we get boredom on top of balderdash, never a good fright night combination.\\" Film scholar John Stanley awarded the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, writing: \\"This imitation of Friday the 13th (originally shot as The Scaremaker) is strengthened only by the presence of Hal Holbrook as a campus security chief.\\" Steven Scheuer in Movies on TV '88-'89 referred to the film as \\"bloody and borderline offensive\\" and deemed the villain's costume \\"simply laughable,\\" ultimately giving the film a one-star rating. Critic James J. Mulay gave the film zero stars in The Horror Film: A Guide to More Than 700 Films on Videocassette (1989), noting the film's surprise ending but that it overall \\"scarcely succeeds,\\" also criticizing the film's actors, who he deemed \\"old enough to be teaching higher education.\\" Home media Girls Nite Out was released for the first time on DVD by Media Blasters on August 30, 2005, as part of the company's \\"Slasher Collection\\" series. The release features an interview with actress Julia Montgomery, as well as the film's theatrical trailer and original opening titles bearing the film's original title of The Scaremaker.

It is a mystery novel set in the imaginary New England town of Shinn Corners, United States. Plot summary Aunt Fanny Adams, famed artist, is the most notable citizen of the tiny New England town of Shinn Corners. A noted proponent of the naturalist school (\\"I paint what I see\\") who only began painting at age eighty, her income props up the local church, school, and almost everything else in town. When she is found murdered, suspicion immediately falls on a passing tramp named Josef Kowalczyk, and a planned lynching is nearly successful. It takes the combined efforts of the town's second-most-notable citizen, Judge Shinn, and his house guest, Major Johnny Shinn, to insist upon a trial by jury. Empaneling a jury takes every eligible citizen in the village, counsel and witnesses alike, and so the trial would never withstand legal scrutiny. But Judge Shinn and Major Shinn's investigation reveals a trail of circumstantial evidence that leads to another potential killer before the mock trial's conclusion. Literary significance & criticism (See Ellery Queen.) This is the first novel by the author Ellery Queen that does not feature the detective character Ellery Queen or even mention his name, but not the last. There are many similarities between the character of Aunt Fanny Adams and the real-life naturalist painter Grandma Moses.

He was son of Rabbi Isaac Sinzheim of Treves, and brother-in- law of Herz Cerfbeer. Biography Sinzheim was the most learned and prominent member of the Assembly of Notables convened by Napoleon I on May 30, 1806. The task of answering the questions laid before the assembly by the imperial commissioner was entrusted to Sinzheim, who fulfilled his duties (July 30-August 3, 1806) to the satisfaction of the assembly as well as of the commissioner and even of Napoleon himself. The German sermon which he delivered in the synagogue of Paris in honor of the emperor's birthday, on Aug. 15, also strengthened Napoleon's favorable opinion of the Jews, who received the imperial promise that their rights as French citizens should not be withdrawn. On February 9, 1807, four days after the Assembly of Notables was dissolved, the Grand Sanhedrin was convened; its chairman (\\"nasi\\"), appointed by the minister of the interior, was Sinzheim, who had probably suggested the assembly, having been frequently consulted by the imperial commissioner. The consistorial constitution, provided by the decree of March 17, 1808, opened a new field of activity for Sinzheim, who was elected chairman of the Central Consistory. He was regarded as the foremost French Talmudist of his time, and was the author of the Yad David, which has recently been printed in its entirety by Machon Yerushalayim.

No other city was as often the stage destination of the Rheinland‚ÄìPfalz Rundfahrt as Bad Marienberg (Westerwald). In its early years, it was an amateur race.

Since 1981, a mountain and a sprint classification have been introduced. In 2007, for the first time a classification for the best young professional was introduced (blue jersey). Due to the cases of doping in cycling, the Rheinland‚ÄìPfalz Rundfahrt was cancelled in 2008.

It ran for only eight issues between November 1993 and June 1994, although the character later reappeared in DC's Justice Society of America series. Fictional character biography Louis Sendak is a 78-year-old man and a retired superhero. A green door in his house leads to an other-worldly labyrinth to which his father would often go during Louis' childhood to collect strange, alien items. One of these items was the Scarabaeus, which latched on to Louis in 1941 and transformed him, giving him superpowers which he used to become the superhero Scarab. Publication history=Vertigo series The series came about when John Smith asked Stuart Moore for his ideas about a possible reboot of Doctor Fate for DC's Vertigo imprint and giving the imprint its own interpretation of DC's Golden Age history and characters. Smith's proposal was deemed \\"too extreme\\" for an established character and was asked to rework the concept into an original creation, which became Scarab. Scarab was subsequently cut down from an ongoing series to a limited series, with pencils by Scot Eaton and inks by Mike Barreiro, which ran for eight issues in 1993 and 1994. =Crossover= Two Indigo Prime agents, Dazzler and Creed, appeared in Scarab #7 & 8 as a way to end the series due to the problems that Smith had encountered with writing it.

An Imperial naval force in China first came into existence from 1132 during the Song Dynasty and existed in some form until the end of the Qing period in 1912. However, the \\"Imperial Chinese Navy\\" usually only refers to the Qing navy which existed between 1875 and 1912. History=Precursors The Second Opium War showed the complete futility of the pre- modern Chinese fleet when facing modern European navies, when 300 Chinese naval junks, armed with British-made guns, did almost no damage to 56 British and French ironclads. In the 1860s, an attempt to establish a modern navy via the British-built Osborn or \\"Vampire\\" Fleet to combat the Taiping rebels' US- built gunboats. The so-called \\"Vampire Fleet\\" fitted out by the Chinese government for the suppression of piracy on the coast of China, owing to the non-fulfilment of the condition that British commander Sherard Osborn should receive orders from the imperial government only, was scrapped. Establishment of the Qing navy In 1865, the Jiangnan Shipyard was established. In 1874, a Japanese incursion into Taiwan exposed the vulnerability of China at sea. A proposal was made to establish three modern coastal fleets: the Northern Sea or Beiyang Fleet, to defend the Yellow Sea, the Southern Sea or Nanyang Fleet, to defend the East China Sea, and the Canton Sea or Yueyang Fleet, to defend the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. The Beiyang Fleet, with a remit to defend the section of coastline closest to the capital Beijing, was prioritised. A series of warships were ordered from Britain and Germany in the late 1870s, and naval bases were built at Port Arthur and Weihaiwei. The first British-built ships were delivered in 1881, and the Beiyang Fleet was formally established in 1888. In 1894 the Beiyang Fleet was on paper the strongest navy in Asia at the time. However, it was largely lost during the First Sino-Japanese War in the Battle of the Yalu River. Although the Zhenyuan and Dingyuan modern batttleships were impervious to Japanese fire, they were unable to sink a single ship and all eight cruisers were lost.The battle displayed once again that the modernisation efforts of China were far inferior to the Meiji Restoration. The Nanyang Fleet was also established in 1875, and grew with mostly domestically built warships and a small number of acquisitions from Britain and Germany. The admiralty or naval board (haijun yamen) was established in 1885. The Nanyang Fleet fought in the Sino-French War, performing somewhat poorly against the French in all engagements. The separate Fujian and Guangdong fleets became part of the Imperial navy after 1875. The Fujian Fleet was almost annihilated during the Sino-French War, and was only able to acquire two new ships thereafter. By 1891, due to budget cuts, the Fujian Fleet was barely a viable fleet. The Guangdong Fleet was established in the late 1860s and based at Whampoa, in Canton (now Guangzhou). After the First Sino-Japanese War, Zhang Zhidong established a river-based fleet in Hubei. In 1909, the remnants of the Beiyang, Nanyang, Guangdong and Fujian Fleets, together with the Hubei fleet, were merged, and re-organised as the Sea Fleet and the River Fleet. Sa Zhenbing In 1911, Sa Zhenbing became the Minister of Navy of the Great Qing. Hai Chi of the Imperial Chinese Navy, on parade in New York. One of the new ships delivered after the war with Japan, the cruiser Hai Chi, in 1911 became the first vessel flying the Yellow Dragon Flag to arrive in American waters, visiting New York City as part of a tour.New York Tribune September 12,1911 Successors After the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 and the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912, the Imperial Chinese Navy was replaced by the Republic of China Navy. The People's Liberation Army Navy was established in early 1949 by the Communist Party of China, and after the establishment of the People's Republic of China later that year became the main navy of China.

In 1910, as part of the reform of the Qing government structure, the Navy Office was replaced by a Navy Ministry, headed by a Navy Secretary. The highest ranks of the navy after the merger of the fleets in 1909 were: * Admiral of the Imperial Chinese Navy (Zheng Dutong) * Vice Admiral of the Imperial Chinese Navy (Fu Dutong) * Rear Admiral of the Imperial Chinese Navy (Xie Dutong) * Commodore of the Imperial Chinese Navy (Tongdai) * Fleet leader of the Imperial Chinese Navy (Duizhang) When it was first developed by Empress Dowager Cixi, the Beiyang Fleet was said to be the strongest navy in East Asia. Before her adopted son, Emperor Guangxu, took over the throne in 1889, Cixi wrote out explicit orders that the navy should continue to develop and expand gradually. On the eve of the First Sino- Japanese War, the German General Staff predicted a victory for China and William Lang, who was a British advisor to the Chinese military, praised Chinese training, ships, guns, and fortifications, stating that \\"in the end, there is no doubt that Japan must be utterly crushed\\". However, after Cixi went into retirement, all naval and military development came to a drastic halt. The military defeats suffered by China has been attributed to the factionalism of regional military governors. For instance, the Beiyang Fleet refused to participate in the Sino-French War in 1884,Loir, M., L'escadre de l'amiral Courbet (Paris, 1886), 26‚Äì29, 37‚Äì65. the Nanyang Fleet retaliating by refusing to deploy during the Sino-Japanese War of 1895.Lung Chang [ÈæçÁ´†], Yueh- nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [Ë∂äÂçóËàá‰∏≠Ê≥ïÊà∞Áà≠, Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993), 327‚Äì28. Li Hongzhang wanted to personally maintain control of this fleet, many top vessels among its number, by keeping it in northern China and not let it slip into the control of southern factions. China did not have a single admiralty in charge of all the Chinese navies before 1885; the northern and southern Chinese navies did not cooperate, therefore enemy navies needed only to fight a segment of China's navy.

He was foaled one year earlier than Man o'War and was a full brother to Belmont Stakes winner Mad Play. Trained by Sam Hildreth and ridden most of the time by the great jockey Earl Sande, Mad Hatter was known as much for his erratic temperament as for his racing ability. Sande was one of the few jockeys that understood Mad Hatter, especially in his later years. Racing career Late to mature, Mad Hatter was lightly raced and won the Bellerose Stakes as a two-year-old. At three, he won the Minneola Handicap easily, having only been to the post twice before and never at more than a mile. Then he lost to Sir Barton in the Maryland Handicap at Laurel Park Racecourse, placing second after running fractions of :22 2/5, and :46 3/5. Sir Barton beat him by two lengths. After winning the inaugural Latonia Championship Stakes over a muddy track by 8 lengths, Mad Hatter went on to Pimlico Race Course in November in the Pimlico Autumn Handicap, beating Sir Barton, who placed a distant third, twelve lengths behind him. In his next race, the Saratoga Handicap, again against Sir Barton and Exterminator, he got into a speed duel with The Porter and placed last. In 1921, Mad Hatter won the Jockey Club Gold Cup and the Metropolitan Handicap and was named U.S. Champion Older Male Horse. Mad Hatter continued to win graded stakes races as a campaigner with a repeat win of the Jockey Club Gold Cup in 1922, the Toboggan Handicap in 1923, and the Suburban and Queens County Handicaps in 1924. Stud career Fertility problems were reported for Mad Hatter. His brother, Belmont Stakes winner Mad Play, was completely sterile. However, out of 177 foals, Mad Hatter sired 23 graded stakes winners such as The Nut, Cocked Hat, Cresta Run, and the champion filly Snowflake.

Biography= Formation and Guided By Fire (2007)  Ghost Brigade was formed in 2005 by former members of the melodic death metal band Sons of Aeon (Wille Naukkarinen and Tommi Kiviniemi), the stoner metal band Sunride (Wille Naukkarinen, Veli-Matti Suihkonen and Janne Julin) and the death metal band Paraxism (Manne Ikonen). They recorded several songs which were gathered in a demo album, released in 2006. The following year, they started to record several songs such as \\"Along The Barriers\\" and \\"Horns\\", which led to the band deciding to record their first proper studio album, Guided By Fire, with their \\"house engineer\\" Mikko Poikolainen. It was released on September 17, 2007 via Season Of Mist as a digital download and later reissued in 2012 in a clear vinyl edition.. It was the first album of the band to feature Aleksi Munter, the keyboardist of the melodic death metal band Swallow The Sun and the only to feature Fredrik Nordin, the vocalist of the stoner metal band Dozer as guest vocals. The band went on tour with Insomnium in Finland to promote the album between April and October 2007.  Isolation Songs (2009-2010)  Two years after Guided By Fire, Ghost Brigade released their second album, Isolation Songs, on August 3, 2009 via Season Of Mist. The second album was produced by Antti Malinen. About this album, Wille Naukkarinen stated: \\"We had a few different working titles for this record but 'Isolation Songs' was the one that we collectively felt good about. I remember reading through the lyrics of this album just before we went to the studio in order to come up with an album title and the word 'isolation' came to mind several times. The songs themselves aren't directly about that at all but I think that having a feeling of being isolated has been an inspiration or a driving force to at least some of the content of these lyrics. And if you think about our songwriting process in general, Isolation Songs is probably the best possible title to characterize that as well. I, for example, have to be completely isolated from the outside world to write riffs, melodies and songs for Ghost Brigade; it just doesn't work any other way. We can't go to our rehearsal room and jam until we come up with something 'pretty cool.' This band digs deeper than that. And besides, Isolation Songs sounds like it's a title of a country album and that of course, is a big bonus. It was a lot of work to get this album done, it took almost two years to write these songs, but now that it's 100% ready I can only say that I feel privileged to be a member of GHOST BRIGADE. I have a strong feeling we have created something very special with 'Isolation Songs' and it is by far my personal favorite of all recordings I've ever been a part of. I hope people will enjoy these songs as much as we do once they get the chance to hear them.\\" After the release of Isolation Songs, the band went on tour as the opener for fellow metal band Amorphis during their 2010 tour in Europe.  Lineup changes and hiatus (2011-2015)  Ghost Brigade released their third studio album, Until Fear No Longer Defines Us, on August 19, 2011. In 2013, long-time bassist Janne Julin left the band and was replaced Joni Saalamo. The band also acquired a new keyboardist in Joni Vanhanen. With this new lineup, the band recorded their fourth studio album, titled IV: One with the Storm. It was released on November 7, 2014, again via Season of Mist. The album was produced by the band and Tuomas Kokko. In December of the following year, the band announced an indefinite hiatus in a Facebook post.

The film follows a college student who finds rooming in a hilltop boarding house where a homicidal killer is on the loose. Released regionally in November 1979, The Silent Scream performed favorably at the box office, which prompted American Cinema Releasing to expand its release in January 1980. It went on to become one of the most financially successful independent horror films of the 1970s. Plot Scotty Parker, a college student in Southern California, is seeking a room for the fall semester at the last-minute. She is directed to a boarding house run by the standoffish Mrs. Engels; a Victorian mansion on a cliffside overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Mrs. Engels lives in the house along with her teenage son, Mason, and several other college students, including Doris, Peter, and Jack. The four students become friends, and decide to go on a double date together. Afterward, Doris and Peter walk along the beach near the house. Peter, drunk, makes unwanted advances on her, and Doris leaves him on the beach. He falls unconscious, and is awakened by an unseen assailant who stabs him to death with a butcher knife. Lieutenant McGiver and Sergeant Manny Rusin are assigned to investigate Peter's murder, and Lt. McGiver grows suspicious of Mrs. Engels and her son. One afternoon, Scotty and Doris meet in the basement laundry room, where Doris tells her she is planning on moving after what happened to Peter. Scotty returns to her room with Jack, and the two begin to have sex. Meanwhile, in the basement, a woman bursts out of a hidden door, stabbing Doris numerous times in the head and chest. The woman flees through the secret door, which opens to a hidden staircase that travels along the house's air ducts, eventually leading to a room located off the main attic space. Scotty goes downstairs to get her laundry, where she finds a pool of blood, and Doris gone. She discovers the secret door, and ascends the staircase. At the top, she finds a narrow hallway with a door at the end. She attempts to open it, and is attacked by the woman, who pulls her inside. The commotion alarms Mrs. Engels, who enters the room from an access door in the attic and intervenes. Mrs. Engels reveals that the woman, Victoria, is her daughter. Mason chastises his mother for having taken in boarders at the house, knowing of Victoria's violent outbursts. Mrs. Engels then reveals to Mason that Victoria is in fact his mother: After a suicide attempt, she gave birth to him, but was left mute and homicidal after undergoing a botched lobotomy at a psychiatric hospital. Meanwhile, Jack searches for Scotty throughout the house, but is unable to find her. He is confronted by Mason downstairs, who knocks him unconscious. At the police station, Sgt. Rusin uncovers a file on Victoria's past and determines she has been living in the Engels home after being taken out of the psychiatrist hospital; he and Lt. McGiver promptly leave to go to the boarding house. Meanwhile, with Scotty bound and gagged in a closet, Mrs. Engels attempts to console the childlike Victoria. Mason obtains a gun from his bedroom and returns to the attic, attempting to kill Victoria. In a struggle, he inadvertently shoots Mrs. Engels through the chest, killing her. With his back turned, Victoria approaches Mason. He turns around, and she stares at him blankly, moving closer with a knife. Cornered against a window, he shoots her, and then shoots himself in the head. Scotty manages to free herself, but finds Victoria has survived the gunshot; she attacks Scotty with the knife. Jack awakens just as Lt. McGiver and Sgt. Rusin arrive at the house. They enter the attic and find Victoria collapsed with a knife in her stomach. Jack consoles Scotty as Victoria dies on the floor. CastProduction Smith Estate in Los Angeles served as a shooting location The film had a tumultuous post- production process where a large portion of the film was re-shot. Diane McBain recalled that she was cast as a police detective in September 1977 when the film began shooting in the Smith Estate, Highland Park, Los Angeles, Eagle Rock, Los Angeles and Occidental College with the film written and directed by Denny Harris. The film was considered un-releasable. Harris brought in brothers Jim and Ken Wheat who rewrote the script. In early 1978 a new series of actors including Yvonne De Carlo, Barbara Steele and Cameron Mitchell were brought in for new shooting. Only 15% of the original footage remained in the film. McBain was told that her character of a female police detective was \\"unbelievable\\" with her role reshot with Mitchell as the detective.p. 285 Mc Bain, Diane & Michaud, Michael Gregg Famous Enough - A Hollywood Memoir 2014 BearManor Media Release=Box office The Silent Scream was released theatrically by American Cinema Releasing; it had a limited regional release, opening in Tulare, California on November 15, 1979 and Honolulu, Hawaii on November 19, 1979. Because the film performed well during its initial release, American Cinema Releasing expanding the release to 131 theaters throughout California in January 1980. The film had its Los Angeles opening on January 18, 1980. During the first week of its January 1980 release, the film grossed $1.67 million. According to the chart book by Leonidas Fragias, it was a number one film in cinemas for the weekend of 6 February 1980. Critical response Tom Buckley of The New York Times panned the film, writing: \\"The only frightening thing about Silent Scream is that there are people who will pay $5 to see it... Everything about the production is repulsively amateurish, and it is saddening to see performers like Yvonne De Carlo and Cameron Mitchell reduced to appearing in it.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirers Desmond Ryan praised the camerawork as \\"adept\\" but ultimately deemed the film \\"crude and ineffective for the apparent reason that Harris is so absorbed in technique‚Äîin how a grasping hand or wielded knife is to be filmed‚Äîthat he has ignored just about every other aspect of making a film.\\" Hal Lipper of the Dayton Daily News deemed the film a \\"carbon copy of Halloween,\\" though he praised Balding as a \\"competent actress\\" and added that the film's finale \\"looks as though it came from a Charles Manson therapy session.\\" Robert Masulo, a critic for The Sacramento Bee, praised the film's cinematography, but felt the performances were \\"without inspiration,\\" and the screenplay \\"overflowing with clich√©s.\\" Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times was more favorable in her assessment, writing that \\"despite indulgences in improbable plotting and predictable gore, The Silent Scream is a scary, stylish Grand Guignol horror movie,\\" adding that director Harris \\"rarely miscalculates his shocks, and his quiet moments are even better.\\" The Boston Globes Michael Blowen also gave the film a favorable review, summarizing: \\"In spite of its obvious flaws, Silent Scream is the best low-budget horror film since Halloween. If that sounds like damning with faint praise, so be it.\\" Home media The film was released on VHS by Media Home Entertainment and Video Treasures. The film was released by Scorpion Releasing on DVD in 2009 and on Blu-ray in 2017.

Built in 1837 on a site overlooking Seneca Lake, it is one of the nation's finest examples of monumental residential Greek Revival architecture. The property was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. and It is now owned and operated by the Geneva Historical Society, and is open for tours in the warmer months. Description and history Rose Hill is located in northwestern Fayette, on the east side of NY 96A overlooking Seneca Lake to the west. It is on of land, a small remnant of the much larger 19th- century farm it was once part of. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, whose most prominent feature is its main facade, which resembles a Greek temple with six Ionic columns supporting a fully pedimented gable. The central block is flanked by single-story wings, whose two-bay facades are fronted by Ionic colonnades. The wings are recessed from the main facade in front, but extend further to the rear, giving the building an overall U shape. The interior exhibits fine Greek Revival woodwork, with a spiral staircase in the central hall, and an elaborate archway separating the two parlors. The plasterwork is as fine as the woodwork, with major examples derived from the published works of architect Minard Lafever. The property was first developed as a farm in 1802 by Robert Rose, who moved to the area from Virginia. In 1839, William K. Strong, a New York City businessman, purchased the property and had the mansion house built. Its architect is not known, but its stylistic details suggest that the builders were influenced by the published works of both Minard Lafever and Andrew Jackson Downing, both proponents of the Greek Revival. The property was purchased in 1850 by Benjamin Swan, another New York City businessman, as a wedding present for his son Robert Swan. The Swans operated the property as a farm which was highly regarded for its performance. The property declined after Robert Swan's death in 1890. In 1965 it was given to the Geneva Historical Society. In poor condition, it underwent an extensive restoration, and was endowed by one of Swan's grandsons to support its future care. The property is open for tours from May to October.

She was the wife of the philosopher Stephan K√∂rner and mother of the mathematician Thomas K√∂rner and the biochemist, writer and translator Ann M. K√∂rner. BiographyLife Edita Leah L√∂wy was born in Znojmo, Czechoslovakia, the daughter of a corn miller, on 10 July 1921. She travelled to the United Kingdom as a refugee in 1939, after the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia. Her family remained behind, with only her brother and several cousins surviving the war. (In 1938/1939, her father changed the family name to Laner in a vain attempt to deceive the Nazis into thinking that he and his family were not Jewish.) She arrived with no money, speaking four languages - Czech, German, Italian and French but little English. Among other jobs, she worked briefly for Reuters. During the war, she met Stephan K√∂rner, a fellow Czech refugee, who was studying for his doctorate in philosophy at Cambridge; the couple married in London in 1944. After the end of the war and Stephan's release from the Czech army, the couple settled in Bristol where Stephan took up an assistant lectureship at the university. The K√∂rners had two children, mathematician Thomas William K√∂rner and Ann K√∂rner (who later married Sidney Altman, a Canadian molecular biologist, who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1989). In the late summer of 2000, Mrs. K√∂rner was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, which had advanced to such a stage that she was given only weeks to live. The couple would soon after be found dead together by a physician on a routine visit to their home in Bristol. Their deaths, which, occurred on 17 August 2000, were ruled suicides by the coroner who stated that he was \\"sure beyond reasonable doubt that both these persons intended to take their own lives.\\"Paul Forrest, Coroner's Court, Bristol UK, October 18, 2000 Career Edith and her husband Stephan on their wedding day in 1944Not content simply to stay at home raising a family, she became a member of the committee overseeing the two local long-stay psychiatric hospitals in the 1950s. This was a fast-changing time for psychiatric medicine, with new drug treatments and changing public attitudes allowing new methods of treatment and care, and Mrs K√∂rner (she never allowed her colleagues to call her by her first name) argued strongly - and successfully - to restructure and reform the sector to take full advantage of these developments. She was appointed a local magistrate in 1966, and would later become the first woman - and the first immigrant - to chair the board in Bristol (from 1987 to 1990). She chaired the bench during the poll tax upheavals of the late 1980s - some 20,000 people in Bristol refused to pay the charge - maintaining a judicial impartiality despite a strong personal and political objection to the tax. She argued strongly for a clear separation of the judiciary and the executive, and for the court system to be as streamlined and efficient as possible. By 1976 she had become the chair of the regional health authority for the south-west, gaining a reputation as an informed and intelligent commentator on health-service issues. In 1967 she had studied the use of computers in the health service for the South Western Regional Hospital Board (as it then was), and in 1980 she was asked to chair a full-scale national review of the way information was generated and handled in the NHS. The K√∂rner Committee studied the matter for four years and produced six major sets of recommendations, all of which were adopted and put into action by the government. The committee's work paved the way for a full-scale computerization of the health service; for the next twenty years, the statistical information used to monitor the work of the NHS was known as \\"K√∂rner Data\\".

An audiobook version read by the author was released on CD in 2007.BBC Audiobooks Ltd. . Plot The title's \\"uncommon reader\\" (Queen Elizabeth II) becomes obsessed with books after a chance encounter with a mobile library. The story follows the consequences of this obsession for the Queen, her household and advisers, and her constitutional position. The title is a play on the phrase \\"common reader\\". This can mean a person who reads for pleasure, as opposed to a critic or scholar. It can also mean a set text, a book that everyone in a group (for example, all students entering a university) are expected to read, so that they can have something in common. The Common Reader is used by Virginia Woolf as the title work of her 1925 essay collection. Plus a triple play ‚Äì Virginia Woolf's title came from Dr. Johnson: \\"I rejoice to concur with the common reader; for by the common sense of readers, uncorrupted by literary prejudices, after all the refinements of subtilty and the dogmatism of learning, must be generally decided all claims to poetical honours.\\" In British English, \\"common\\" holds levels of connotation. A commoner is anyone other than royalty or nobility. Common can also mean vulgar, as common taste; mean, as common thief; ordinary, as common folk; widespread, as in \\"common use\\"; or something for use by everyone, as in \\"common land\\".

Of medieval origin, it was rebuilt after the Great Fire of London to the designs of Christopher Wren and demolished in 1878. Early history The church of St Dionis was dedicated to Dionysus the Areopagite. The name Backchurch could have come from its standing behind other buildings, or from its position relative to the church of St Gabriel Fenchurch. It was in existence by the year 1288, when Reginald de Standen was recorded as being the rector. In 1466 the Alderman John Darby had an aisle added, in which he was buried. The patronage of the church once belonged to the prior and canons of Christchurch, Canterbury and later passed to the dean and chapter of Canterbury Cathedral. Rebuilding after the Great Fire The church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and rebuilt to the designs of Christopher Wren in 1674 at a cost of ¬£5,737. A tower, also to Wren's design, was added ten years later. Wren‚Äôs church was 66 feet long and 59 feet wide. It was divided into nave and aisles by Ionic columns supporting an entablature. The ceiling of the nave was arched, and pierced with circular windows under groin vaulted openings, while the aisle ceilings were horizontal. There was a west gallery with an organ. The bell tower was divided into three storeys by string courses. At the top was an open parapet, and a small bell turret which had been removed by the nineteenth century. The church was built mostly of stone, with some brick which was later stuccoed.Elmes, James. Topographical Dictionary of London, p.164 The east end of the church, in Lime Street, had a pediment and two pairs of coupled Ionic pilasters with a large window below carved festoons. A row of shops, built against the south wall, stood between the church and Fenchurch street. A City of London commemorative plaque noting the year of demolition is attached to the wall of the buildings that now occupy the former site of St Dionis Backchurch, opposite number 24 Lime Street EC3. Demolition St Dionis Backchurch reburials monument at the City of London Cemetery In 1858, the vestry asked the architect George Edmund Street to examine the fabric of the church. He found that the church was in need of substantial repairs and recommended that the most economical course of action would be to demolish the whole church except for the tower, and rebuild it to a Gothic design of his own. Before any such plans could be carried out, however, the vestry decided that the church was no longer needed. In 1878 the parish was merged with that of All Hallows Lombard Street under the Union of Benefices Act of 1860 and the church demolished. While surveying the church, Street discovered that a fifteenth-century crypt had survived under the chancel of Wren‚Äôs church. The church had a peal of ten bells, cast between 1726 and 1750. They were transferred to All Hallows Lombard Street when St Dionis was demolished. A parish mark can be seen in Philpot Lane.

History Originally built in the 14th century, the church is mentioned in writing for the first time in 1387. In 1901-39 the Church of St. Nicholas was the only church in Vilnius where the mass was held in Lithuanian. By the same token it was a centre of Lithuanian culture (its famous dean Kristupas ƒåibiras was killed in 1942 during a bombing raid).Prof. Tomas Venclova, Vilnius. R.

From 1901-1906, its priest was Juozapas Kukta. The building kept a secret collection of editions published by Martin Kukhta‚Äôs publishing house. From 1921, services were offered each Sunday at 10am, with Belarusian language sermons. Until 1940, priest Adam Stankevich served there and, in the 1920s, its priests included Konstantin Stepovich (Kazimir Svayak), Wincenty Godlewski and Yazep Germanovich.\\" After the World War II, the Cathedral of Vilnius was closed and the Curia of the Archdiocese of Vilnius was moved to the St. Nicholas Parish building and the Church of St. Nicholas in fact performed the functions of a cathedral. During the Soviet occupation a statue of the patron of Vilnius, St. Christopher, was erected in the church orchard (sculptor Antanas Kmieliauskas, 1959); it was an obvious act of resistance, as the city's coat-of-arms with St. Christopher's figure was banned at that time. Architecture Archaeologists believe that the same Roman Catholic church survived till the present day. Externally, the church represents the Brick Gothic style, while its interior has been renovated several times. The church belfry was built in the 17th century in the Baroque style. Its fa√ßade is flanked by two stocky buttresses with cut-off tops. The triangular pediment with niches has been recently renovated accentuating its original Gothic character. In the interior, four elegant octahedral pillars support web and star vaults. The high altar holds a painting of St. Nicholas with a silver setting from the 16th century. The church is adorned with two sculptures: a polychrome statue of St. Louis from the Gothic period, and Vytautas' bronze bust erected in 1930 (sculptor Rapolas Jakimaviƒçius).

On November 3, 2009, Bradford was elected to the Houston City Council from At-large Position 4 and took office January 2, 2010.Meet the new players In the 2011 election, Bradford won a second term as a Houston City Councilmember. Background Bradford is an attorney, public safety consultant, former Houston Chief of Police and vice mayor pro-tem for the City of Houston. In January 2012, members of the Houston City Council elected Bradford as vice mayor pro-tem via unanimous vote. Bradford ran three successful citywide campaigns, the maximum (three terms) permitted under law. During his second and third campaign, he won in every council district, without a run-off and got the highest number of votes in all of the citywide contested races. He became a resident of the city of Houston in 1979. Bradford has lived in Hiram Clarke, Alief, Fondren Southwest, and MacGregor areas, he understands the various characteristics of the Houston community and appreciates efforts to focus on neighborhood needs. Bradford served 24 years as a Houston police officer and seven years as chief of police. He was appointed Houston's police chief by Mayor Bob Lanier and re-appointed by Mayor Lee P. Brown. While serving as chief of police, Bradford managed 7,000 personnel and $500 million annual budget. During his tenure, citizens' fear of crime and public safety concerns went from 59% in 1996 to only 10% by the time he left office in 2003, as documented by Dr. Stephen Klineberg, Rice University. He holds degrees in law from the University of Houston Law Center, criminal justice from Grambling State University, and a public administration degree from Texas Southern University. Also, he is a graduate of the FBI Academy and Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government Program for State and Local Executives. Bradford has combined his education, legal training and police experience to work with neighborhoods and businesses, nationally and internationally, to help develop safety strategies. He has initiated and led investigations, reviews, and assessments surrounding police, community and incidents of crime on numerous occasions. Bradford was part of the leadership team that first developed and implemented community policing strategies in Houston, Texas. Today, more than 80% of the police agencies in America utilize some form of community policing; it is a proven concept in providing public safety services. Bradford served one of the longest tenures as a Houston police chief and implemented many significant programs and initiatives during his administration. These include the department's first alternative dispute resolution process, American Sign Language Program, assessment center process for promotions, expansion of airport security, city/county jail consolidation project, computer crime mapping, crisis intervention team program, decentralized family violence unit, hate crimes program and Houston Police Online. Bradford also initiated HPD crime laboratory accreditation, the first meet and confer employees‚Äô benefits agreement, established the first Middle Eastern and South Asian community liaison, created the No Trucks in the Left-Lane Motorists Safety Program, implemented a racial profiling prohibition policy, implemented HPD's Top 10 Sex Offenders/Parole Violators Program and created the department's first crime victim services unit. He also opened new police stations at four divisions and police storefronts at five locations. In cooperation with 28 other police agencies and media outlets, Bradford implemented the Technology to Recover Abducted Kids (TRAK) System, and he established the first youth police advisory council in the nation. Bradford has served as a precinct chair and election judge in Harris County, Texas. Also, he has extensive experience as a senior consultant in the international consulting firm of Brown Group International (BGI). BGI is a full-service consulting firm that provides solutions to problems of government, corporations and individuals. BGI offers services in the areas of public safety, homeland security, crisis management, government relations, community government, personnel selection, litigation support, technology services and international trade. Additionally, Bradford has served for several years as an adjunct professor in the School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University. He is a highly rated professor teaching two particular courses: Police Administration and Judicial Administration. As a Houston City Council member, Bradford focused on the delivery of core services which include water, garbage, infrastructure issues and safety services. In addition to serving on the Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee, he served as chair of the Ethics, Elections and Council Governance Committee, vice chair of the Budget and Fiscal Affairs Committee and chaired a City of Houston Procurement Process Task Force. Bradford‚Äôs civic activities include serving as a precinct chair, election judge, and deputy voter registrar in Harris County, Texas. He holds memberships and volunteers in numerous community activities, including the ENRICH After-School (Evaluating the Out-of-School-Time Needs, Resources and Initiatives in the Communities of Houston) Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, Education Foundation of Harris County, American Education Technologies Youth Counselor, Grambling State University's Criminal Justice Advisory Board, Wiley College Criminal Justice Institute, DeVry University Industry Advisory Board, 100 Club, Harris County Constable Precinct 7 Advisory Board and frequently serves as a university guest lecturer, crime prevention and safety awareness speaker. Education Bradford holds degrees from the University of Houston Law Center, Grambling State University and Texas Southern University. He is also a graduate of the FBI Academy and the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government.Meet the Players Career While chief of police for the Houston Police Department, Bradford held one of the longest tenures in that office. He also has the distinction of being one of only two police chiefs to be appointed by two Houston mayors. Both Mayor Bob Lanier and Mayor Lee Brown selected him as their chief of police. Bradford managed a department with 5,000 officers and 2,000 civilian personnel, an annual budget of $500 million, and a population of 2 million people over . Bradford, an attorney, served 24 years with the Houston Police Department, including seven years as police chief.

It closed in 2009 along with Chapter Girls School when Strood Academy was opened. History The Temple School for Senior Boys, as it was originally known, opened its doors to 401 pupils on 6 January 1936 in brand-new buildings on the Temple Farm Estate on land at the top of Cedar Road. The first headmaster was Mr. E. Featherstone with twelve assistant masters including Mr. H. G. Benyon who worked all his life at Temple and retired over thirty years later as Deputy Head. The building of the school had been funded by the City of Rochester Education Authority and it was officially declared open by Earl de la Warr. Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education on the 22nd. May 1936. On the 14th. December that year all the boys were marched from school down to the Corn Exchange to hear the reading of the Proclamation of King George V1. School life before the Second World War was a period of development. Matters such as installing new equipment, developing the playing field for football including much stone-picking to ensure a safe pitch ‚Äì and eventually the first successful Sports Day. Ominously, a year before war broke out, every pupil was issued with a gas respirator and for some years all were obliged to carry them everywhere they went. The school closed early in August 1939 supposedly for a five-week summer holiday but war broke out on the 1st. September so the summer holiday lasted until November. As it was thought that the Medway Towns would become a prime target for German bombers, evacuation of the school was hastily organised and over one hundred boys with their younger brothers and sisters were evacuated to Whitstable. Eleven of the school staff accompanied them but Mr. Featherstone remained in Strood for just one month before he was permitted to resign. The new headmaster, Mr. H. A. Skerrett was one of the teachers who was evacuated to Whitstable and never once carried out headmaster duties in Temple School in Cedar Road. Until the end of 1941 those pupils remaining in Strood were educated on a part-time basis ‚Äì juniors in the mornings and seniors in the afternoons. In this year the school acquired an infant's department which remained until Elaine Primary School opened in the early 1950s. In January 1942, Mr. P. Weatherhogg from St. Peter's, Rochester was appointed headmaster and by the end of that year all children were having full-time schooling. During most of the war Temple was an all-age school for both boys and girls who lived to the west of Watling Street. It was not until the end of 1946 when the girls had transferred to Chapter School in Cliffe Road, Frindsbury that Temple became the Boys School that flourished for the next sixty years. Mr. J. O. Hancock, BSc., A.V.C.M began his distinguished career as headmaster in April 1947. He had previously taught in Manchester, but came to Temple from Stockport Grammar School where he had been Senior Science Master. Mr. Hancock was a strong and determined man and his beliefs were unshakeable. He believed that every youngster should have support and the same chance to make the most of his abilities. Mr. Hancock was responsible for introducing the school motto ‚ÄòNothing but the best‚Äô. Football teams were entered or each school year in the local schools‚Äô league. Rugby and hockey teams had regular fixtures. In the summer Temples‚Äô cricket teams were among the most successful in the County, regularly beating such as Maidstone Grammar, Rochester Math, Gillingham Grammar and Borden Grammar. Temple teachers in the war. Mr. Hancock was lucky enough to have the support of some very enthusiastic and capable teachers who had played their part in WW2. *Frank Jeffery D.F.C had been a navigator in a bomber which crashed, badly injuring him and causing him to spend three years in a prisoner of war camp. *Len Mason had also been in the RAF for six years. *Bill Lang had been an Army Intelligence Officer in Italy. *Joe Ingham had been one of a few survivors of a bombed-out tank in France. *Bob Sinclair who had begun teaching before the war, spent time in the army. GCE In 1954 the first boys entered who could stay at Temple for five years. A special GCE form was created at this time with a vigorous programme of schoolwork and homework and this led to some pleasing results but of course Mr. Hancock made sure that at no time did pupils of lesser academic ability ever take second place in the schools‚Äô priority. In 2006, 2% of the pupils gained 5 passes with Maths and English at GCSE, leading the press to dub it the worst school in the country. In 2007, it was 16% and the press were not interested. In 2007, Temple school beat 4 Medway schools in the key KS2- KS4 value added indicator.League Tables Curriculum The school followed the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3, but were more flexible at Stage 4curriculum - official website The subjects students were allowed take depended much on ability, the following subjects were optional at GCSE: History, Geography, Graphics, Resistant Materials, Food Technology, Leisure and Tourism, Btech Sports, Diploma in Digital Applications (DiDA), French, German, Religious Education, Music, Drama, Art, Btech Art.

The mass formula is often given for integral quadratic forms, though it can be generalized to quadratic forms over any algebraic number field. In 0 and 1 dimensions the mass formula is trivial, in 2 dimensions it is essentially equivalent to Dirichlet's class number formulas for imaginary quadratic fields, and in 3 dimensions some partial results were given by Gotthold Eisenstein. The mass formula in higher dimensions was first given by , though his results were forgotten for many years. It was rediscovered by , and an error in Minkowski's paper was found and corrected by . Many published versions of the mass formula have errors; in particular the 2-adic densities are difficult to get right, and it is sometimes forgotten that the trivial cases of dimensions 0 and 1 are different from the cases of dimension at least 2. give an expository account and precise statement of the mass formula for integral quadratic forms, which is reliable because they check it on a large number of explicit cases. For recent proofs of the mass formula see and . The Smith‚ÄìMinkowski‚ÄìSiegel mass formula is essentially the constant term of the Weil‚ÄìSiegel formula. Statement of the mass formula If f is an n-dimensional positive definite integral quadratic form (or lattice) then the mass of its genus is defined to be :m(f) = \\\\sum_{\\\\Lambda}{1\\\\over{\\\\operatorname{Aut}(\\\\Lambda)}} where the sum is over all integrally inequivalent forms in the same genus as f, and Aut(Œõ) is the automorphism group of Œõ. The form of the mass formula given by states that for n ‚â• 2 the mass is given by :m(f) = 2\\\\pi^{-n(n+1)/4}\\\\prod_{j=1}^n\\\\Gamma(j/2)\\\\prod_{p\\\\text{ prime}}2m_p(f) where mp(f) is the p-mass of f, given by : m_p(f) = {p^{(rn(n-1)+s(n+1))/2}\\\\over N(p^r)} for sufficiently large r, where ps is the highest power of p dividing the determinant of f. The number N(pr) is the number of n by n matrices X with coefficients that are integers mod p r such that :X^\\\\text{tr}AX \\\\equiv A\\\\ \\\\bmod\\\\ p^r where A is the Gram matrix of f, or in other words the order of the automorphism group of the form reduced mod p r. Some authors state the mass formula in terms of the p-adic density :\\\\alpha_p(f) = {N(p^r)\\\\over p^{rn(n-1)/2}} = {p^{s(n+1)/2}\\\\over m_p(f)} instead of the p-mass. The p-mass is invariant under rescaling f but the p-density is not. In the (trivial) cases of dimension 0 or 1 the mass formula needs some modifications. The factor of 2 in front represents the Tamagawa number of the special orthogonal group, which is only 1 in dimensions 0 and 1. Also the factor of 2 in front of mp(f) represents the index of the special orthogonal group in the orthogonal group, which is only 1 in 0 dimensions. Evaluation of the mass The mass formula gives the mass as an infinite product over all primes. This can be rewritten as a finite product as follows. For all but a finite number of primes (those not dividing 2 det(∆í)) the p-mass mp(∆í) is equal to the standard p-mass stdp(∆í), given by :\\\\operatorname{std}_p(f)= {1\\\\over 2(1-p^{-2})(1-p^{-4})\\\\dots(1-p^{2-n}) (1-{(-1)^{n/2}\\\\det(f)\\\\choose p}p^{-n/2})} \\\\quad (for n = dim(∆í) even) :\\\\operatorname{std}_p(f)= {1\\\\over 2(1-p^{-2})(1-p^{-4})\\\\dots(1-p^{1-n}) } (for n = dim(∆í) odd) where the Legendre symbol in the second line is interpreted as 0 if p divides 2 det(∆í). If all the p-masses have their standard value, then the total mass is the standard mass :\\\\operatorname{std}(f) = 2\\\\pi^{-n(n+1)/4}\\\\left(\\\\prod_{j=1}^n\\\\Gamma(j/2)\\\\right) \\\\zeta(2)\\\\zeta(4)\\\\dots \\\\zeta(n-1) (For n odd) :\\\\operatorname{std}(f) = 2\\\\pi^{-n(n+1)/4}\\\\left(\\\\prod_{j=1}^n\\\\Gamma(j/2)\\\\right) \\\\zeta(2)\\\\zeta(4)\\\\dots \\\\zeta(n-2)\\\\zeta_D(n/2) (For n even) where :\\\\zeta_D(s) = \\\\prod_p{1\\\\over 1-{\\\\big(\\\\frac{D}{p}\\\\big)}p^{-s}} :D = (‚àí1)n/2 det(∆í) The values of the Riemann zeta function for an even integers s are given in terms of Bernoulli numbers by :\\\\zeta(s) = {(2\\\\pi)^s\\\\over 2\\\\times s!}B_s. So the mass of ∆í is given as a finite product of rational numbers as :m(f) = \\\\operatorname{std}(f)\\\\prod_{p2\\\\det(f)}{m_p(f)\\\\over \\\\operatorname{std}_p(f)}. Evaluation of the p-mass If the form f has a p-adic Jordan decomposition :f=\\\\sum qf_q where q runs through powers of p and fq has determinant prime to p and dimension n(q), then the p-mass is given by :m_p(f) = \\\\prod_qM_p(f_q)\\\\times \\\\prod_{q Here n(II) is the sum of the dimensions of all Jordan components of type 2 and p = 2, and n(I,I) is the total number of pairs of adjacent constituents fq, f2q that are both of type I. The factor Mp(fq) is called a diagonal factor and is a power of p times the order of a certain orthogonal group over the field with p elements. For odd p its value is given by :{1\\\\over 2(1-p^{-2})(1-p^{-4})\\\\dots (1-p^{1-n})} when n is odd, or :{1\\\\over 2(1-p^{-2})(1-p^{-4})\\\\dots (1-p^{2-n})(1-p^{-n/2})} when n is even and (‚àí1)n/2dq is a quadratic residue, or :{1\\\\over 2(1-p^{-2})(1-p^{-4})\\\\dots (1-p^{2-n})(1+p^{-n/2})} when n is even and (‚àí1)n/2dq is a quadratic nonresidue. For p = 2 the diagonal factor Mp(fq) is notoriously tricky to calculate. (The notation is misleading as it depends not only on fq but also on f2q and fq/2.) *We say that fq is odd if it represents an odd 2-adic integer, and even otherwise. *The octane value of fq is an integer mod 8; if fq is even its octane value is 0 if the determinant is +1 or ‚àí1 mod 8, and is 4 if the determinant is +3 or ‚àí3 mod 8, while if fq is odd it can be diagonalized and its octane value is then the number of diagonal entries that are 1 mod 4 minus the number that are 3 mod 4\\\\. *We say that fq is bound if at least one of f2q and fq/2 is odd, and say it is free otherwise. *The integer t is defined so that the dimension of fq is 2t if fq is even, and 2t + 1 or 2t + 2 if fq is odd. Then the diagonal factor Mp(fq) is given as follows. :{1\\\\over 2(1-p^{-2})(1-p^{-4})\\\\dots (1-p^{-2t})} when the form is bound or has octane value +2 or ‚àí2 mod 8 or :{1\\\\over 2(1-p^{-2})(1-p^{-4})\\\\dots (1-p^{2-2t})(1-p^{-t})} when the form is free and has octane value ‚àí1 or 0 or 1 mod 8 or :{1\\\\over 2(1-p^{-2})(1-p^{-4})\\\\dots (1-p^{2-2t})(1+p^{-t})} when the form is free and has octane value ‚àí3 or 3 or 4 mod 8\\\\. Evaluation of Œ∂D(s) The required values of the Dirichlet series Œ∂D(s) can be evaluated as follows. We write œá for the Dirichlet character with œá(m) given by 0 if m is even, and the Jacobi symbol {\\\\left(\\\\frac{D}{m}\\\\right)} if m is odd. We write k for the modulus of this character and k1 for its conductor, and put œá = œá1œà where œá1 is the principal character mod k and œà is a primitive character mod k1. Then :\\\\zeta_D(s) = L(s,\\\\chi) = L(s,\\\\psi)\\\\prod_{pk}\\\\left(1 - {\\\\psi(p)\\\\over p^s}\\\\right) The functional equation for the L-series is :L(1-s,\\\\psi)= {k_1^{s-1}\\\\Gamma(s)\\\\over (2\\\\pi)^s} (i^{-s}+\\\\psi(-1)i^s)G(\\\\psi)L(s,\\\\psi) where G is the Gauss sum :G(\\\\psi) = \\\\sum_{r=1}^{k_1}\\\\psi(r)e^{2\\\\pi i r/k_1}. If s is a positive integer then :L(1-s,\\\\psi) = -{k_1^{s-1}\\\\over s} \\\\sum_{r=1}^{k_1}\\\\psi(r)B_s(r/k_1) where Bs(x) is a Bernoulli polynomial. Examples For the case of even unimodular lattices Œõ of dimension n > 0 divisible by 8 the mass formula is :\\\\sum_{\\\\Lambda}{1\\\\over\\\\operatorname{Aut}(\\\\Lambda)} = {B_{n/2}\\\\over n}\\\\prod_{1\\\\le j< n/2}{B_{2j}\\\\over 4j} where Bk is a Bernoulli number. Dimension n = 0 The formula above fails for n = 0, and in general the mass formula needs to be modified in the trivial cases when the dimension is at most 1. For n = 0 there is just one lattice, the zero lattice, of weight 1, so the total mass is 1. Dimension n = 8 The mass formula gives the total mass as :{B_4\\\\over 8}{B_2\\\\over 4}{B_4\\\\over 8}{B_6\\\\over 12} = {1/30\\\\over 8}\\\\;{1/6\\\\over 4}\\\\;{1/30\\\\over 8}\\\\;{1/42\\\\over 12} = {1\\\\over 696729600}. There is exactly one even unimodular lattice of dimension 8, the E8 lattice, whose automorphism group is the Weyl group of E8 of order 696729600, so this verifies the mass formula in this case. Smith originally gave a nonconstructive proof of the existence of an even unimodular lattice of dimension 8 using the fact that the mass is non-zero. Dimension n = 16 The mass formula gives the total mass as :{B_8\\\\over 16}{B_2\\\\over 4}{B_4\\\\over 8}{B_6\\\\over 12}{B_8\\\\over 16}{B_{10}\\\\over 20}{B_{12}\\\\over 24}{B_{14}\\\\over 28} = {691\\\\over 277667181515243520000 }. There are two even unimodular lattices of dimension 16, one with root system E82 and automorphism group of order 2√ó6967296002 = 970864271032320000, and one with root system D16 and automorphism group of order 21516! = 685597979049984000. So the mass formula is :{1\\\\over 970864271032320000} + {1\\\\over 685597979049984000} = {691\\\\over 277667181515243520000 }. Dimension n = 24 There are 24 even unimodular lattices of dimension 24, called the Niemeier lattices. The mass formula for them is checked in . Dimension n = 32 The mass in this case is large, more than 40 million. This implies that there are more than 80 million even unimodular lattices of dimension 32, as each has automorphism group of order at least 2 so contributes at most 1/2 to the mass. By refining this argument, showed that there are more than a billion such lattices. In higher dimensions the mass, and hence the number of lattices, increases very rapidly. Generalizations Siegel gave a more general formula that counts the weighted number of representations of one quadratic form by forms in some genus; the Smith‚ÄìMinkowski‚ÄìSiegel mass formula is the special case when one form is the zero form. Tamagawa showed that the mass formula was equivalent to the statement that the Tamagawa number of the orthogonal group is 2, which is equivalent to saying that the Tamagawa number of its simply connected cover the spin group is 1. Andr√© Weil conjectured more generally that the Tamagawa number of any simply connected semisimple group is 1, and this conjecture was proved by Kottwitz in 1988. gave a mass formula for unimodular lattices without roots (or with given root system).

Of Cappadocian origin, he occupied the see of Tomi from 360. According to Sozomen, during the campaign against the Goths in this region, the emperor Valens stopped at Tomi and urged the populace to convert to Arianism and reject the Nicene Creed. Bretannio spoke out against this and for this he was exiled.Fleury, Claude. The ecclesiastical history of M. l'abb√© Fleury, Vol. 2, T.

Santi Beati: San Bretannione Basil the Great requested of the ruler of Scythia Minor, Junius Soranus (Saran), that he should send him the relics of saints of that region. Basil was sent the relics of Sabbas the Goth in Caesarea, Cappadocia, in 373 or 374 accompanied by a letter entitled the 'Epistle of the Church of God in Gothia to the Church of God located in Cappadocia and to all the Local Churches of the Holy Universal Church'. The sending of Sabbas' relics and the writing of the actual letter has been attributed to Bretannio. He may have represented Tomi at the council held in Constantinople in 381, but his name may have been confused with the name of the bishop Gerontius (Terentius) of Tomi, who may have been the actual participant at this council. Baronio, in compiling his martyrology, seems to have arbitarirly assigned him the feast day of January 25.

He owned and operated Greenwood Press, a small book printing press based in the San Francisco Bay Area. He taught classes in design, typography, and printmaking at Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University, University of California, Santa Cruz, and San Francisco Art Institute.  Biography  Stauffacher was born in San Francisco, California, in 1920, and he grew up in nearby San Mateo, California. His father Frank A. Stauffacher was a plumber, and his mother was Elsa R. Stauffacher. His brother, Frank Stauffacher, was a filmmaker and ran the pioneering Art in Cinema cinema series at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art from 1946 to 1954. At the age of 13, he established the Greenwood Press. The press was named after the street on which it was located, in a small building that he and his father built behind the family home in San Mateo, California. His first printed book appeared in 1941 when he was 20 years old, Washington Irving's \\"Three Choice Sketches By Geoffrey Crayon, Gent\\" based on The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.. In 1955, he received a Fulbright grant for three years of study in Florence, Italy, and decided to close Greenwood Press. There he met master printers Giovanni Mardersteig and Alberto Tallone, whose work and ideas influenced him profoundly. After his return to the United States, he became assistant professor of typographic design at Carnegie Mellon University and his work led to the formation of the New Laboratory Press. He went on to become typographic director at Stanford University Press and to teach at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI), and University of California, Santa Cruz. One of his former students was artist Tom Killion. In 1966, he reopened the Greenwood Press in a building at 300 Broadway in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco and resumed producing books and limited editions such as Albert Camus and the Men of Stone (1971). In 1967, he was commissioned to redesign the Journal of Typographic Research, later renamed Visible Language. The typographic composition he used for its cover was used for many years. Stauffacher was added to the distinguished list of AIGA medalists in 2004. Several of his experimental compositions using wood and metal type are in the permanent collections of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), the Stanford University Library, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). He was the subject of an article and his work featured on the cover of the groundbreaking Emigre magazine in 1998.

Flower, designed by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark, was released in February 2009 on PlayStation 3, via the PlayStation Network. PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions of the game were ported over by Bluepoint Games and released in November 2013. An iOS version was released in September 2017, and a Windows version was released in February 2019, both published by Annapurna Interactive. The game was intended as a \\"spiritual successor\\" to Flow, a previous title by Chen and Thatgamecompany. In Flower, the player controls the wind, blowing a flower petal through the air using the movement of the game controller. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary wind turbines. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. Flower was primarily intended to arouse positive emotions in the player, rather than to be a challenging and \\"fun\\" game. This focus was sparked by Chen, who felt that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. The team viewed their efforts as creating a work of art, removing gameplay elements and mechanics that were not provoking the desired response in the players. The music, composed by Vincent Diamante, dynamically responds to the player's actions and corresponds with the emotional cues in the game. Flower was a critical success, to the surprise of the developers. Reviewers praised the game's music, visuals, and gameplay, calling it a unique and compelling emotional experience. It was named the \\"best independent game of 2009\\" at the Spike Video Game Awards, and won the \\"Casual Game of the Year\\" award by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences. Gameplay alt=A group of pink flower petals is displayed above a green grassy field with the viewer seemingly amongst them. The sky is pink-toned, and a light yellow sun is shown above the horizon on the right side. Flower is divided up into six main levels and one credits level. Each level is represented by a flower in a pot on a city apartment windowsill, and upon selecting one the player is taken to the \\"dream\\" of that flower. Once inside a level, the player controls the wind as it blows a single flower petal through the air. Changes in the pitch and roll of the floating petal are accomplished by tilting the PlayStation 3 controller. Pressing any button blows the wind harder, which in turn moves the petal faster. The camera generally follows just behind the petal, though it sometimes moves to show a new objective or consequence of the player's actions. Groups and lines of flowers are present in each level; approaching these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour. Although no speech or text is used anywhere in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the main menu, the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears to be near the ending location of the previous one, and through the course of the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place. As the player progresses through the different levels of the game, the city viewed through the apartment window in the level selection screen gradually becomes more vibrant and colorful. If the player triggers three secret flowers in each level, the cityscape is replaced with a bright field with mountains in the background. The music changes in scope as the game progresses, growing in scale and complexity and adding to the narrative arc. The credits level is played in a similar manner to the main levels, but as the player flies through each flower the name of a person involved in the game appears above it. Flower includes PlayStation Network trophies in keeping with the game's feel. While some are objective-based, many are centered on relaxing and watching the scenery. Development Designer Jenova Chen in 2007 Flower was developed as a spiritual successor to Flow, a 2006 Flash game created by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark while the two were students at the University of Southern California. Flow was later developed into a PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany in 2007 and a PlayStation Portable game by SuperVillain Studios in 2008. Flower was Thatgamecompany's \\"first game outside the safety net of academia\\". It was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2007, and was released on the PlayStation Network on February 12, 2009. Flower was intended primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as \\"an emotional shelter\\". Six to nine people were involved at varying stages of development. Chen, who co-founded Thatgamecompany with game producer Kellee Santiago, was the creative director in charge of the game, while Clark was the lead designer. Chen described the game as \\"an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature\\". He decided on the \\"nature\\" theme early in the development process, saying that he \\"had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it leads you to somewhere else. I thought; wouldn't it be nice if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature\\". Before beginning work, the development team commissioned two pieces of music that they felt would inspire the right emotional tone for the game to guide their efforts. They created a number of prototypes, including concepts focused on growing flowers and based around human consciousness. The team decided that a prototype centered on petals floating in the wind best captured the emotions they wanted to evoke. They made keeping the player in a peaceful emotional state their design focus, and removed elements that frustrated players such as petal collection requirements to unlock levels and game mechanics that were too traditional and made the players too excited. The team tried to not place any barriers in the levels, allowing the player to go anywhere in an open world but realized that without a few guidelines, such as the camera focusing on new flowers or segmenting the levels, players became confused and frustrated. Chen described the process as \\"almost like we wanted to throw away the traditional game design, but we end up picking up all the pieces we threw away and putting them back because we know those are actually needed to deliver a good guided experience\\". The overall development time was two years, but the team spent three quarters of that time in the prototyping stage. After deciding on the game elements, Flower was produced in only six months. The game's focus on emotions was sparked by Chen, who felt that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. Chen tried to make the game focus more on emotions than on a message; he specifically changed the design of Flower when early testers felt there was a message of promoting green energy in the game. To make Flower have the \\"emotional spectrum\\" that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a \\"fun\\" game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. He summarized this view by saying that the only gameplay mechanic is hitting a flower to trigger a new event. The team specifically cut out deeper gameplay elements because these would have added \\"challenge\\" to the game, which, while fun, would not have been relaxing. Santa Monica Studio contracted with Bluepoint Games to create ports of the game for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which were published in November 2013 to correspond with the release of the PlayStation 4. Annapurna Interactive brought Flower to the iOS platform in September 2017, and to Microsoft Windows in February 2019. Music The music for Flower was created by Vincent Diamante, a video game music composer and professor at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. He had previously scored the music for Cloud, Chen's first game, and Dyadin when they were both at the University of Southern California. He worked directly with the development team to integrate the music into the game by adjusting the placements of flowers and the tones that each type played when they were reached. He did this by harmonizing the gameplay with the music, and adjusting the music dynamically to correspond to changes in the game world. Diamante used his music to influence the development team in adapting ideas he had for the game. The music and instruments in each level were chosen to correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation with the amount of petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37. Reception Flower was well-received by critics. Alice Liang of 1UP.com applauded the game, saying that \\"the freedom of movement makes the game feel as relaxing as a gently wafting breeze\\". She felt that \\"fun\\" did not fully describe the game experience, saying that it had a \\"well- constructed movie's emotional arc\\" and that the game's music, visuals, and gameplay all drew the player into a compelling emotional experience. She also felt that it was very replayable, which offset its brevity. Ryan Clements of IGN agreed with Liang's opinion, saying that it provided \\"more enjoyment, emotion and enlightenment than any game\\" he had played in years. Though he noted that the game would not appeal to everyone, he described it as \\"something very unique and very powerful\\", referring to it as a \\"must-play\\". Michael Kontoudis of PALGN called it an \\"utterly unique, brave and moving game brimming with personality and intent\\", though he noted that as it was closer to a work of art than a game, many players would not be interested in it. Gerard Campbell of The Press similarly described it as something more than a game, calling it a \\"perfect foil\\" to \\"ultra-violent shoot-'em-up\\" games and summarizing it as \\"one of the most refreshing and relaxing games around\\". Eurogamer Tom Bramwell had similar praise, describing it as \\"pleasantly innocent and uplifting\\", though he awarded it a lower score than other reviewers as he felt the US$9.99 price was too high for the game's length. This criticism was not universal, as reviewers such as Jason Hill of The Age called the Australian price of \\"reasonable\\" and described the length as not \\"overstay[ing] its welcome\\". Critics such as GamePro Terry Terrones and GameTrailers echoed the same praises as other reviewers for the game; GameTrailers said that it was \\"less a game and more an experience. You don't necessarily 'play' Flower; you interact with it,\\" while Terrones noted the music as the best part of the game's presentation. Tom Hoggins of The Daily Telegraph felt that Flower would \\"reignite the 'video games as art' debate\\" and was of the opinion that it was a \\"wonderful work of art\\" in addition to a game. The positive reception surprised the developers, as they had expected a mixed reaction. Flower received the \\"Best Independent Game Fueled by Dew\\" award in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards. It was similarly named the \\"Best Indie Game\\" of 2009 by Playboy. It was nominated for the 2009 \\"Outstanding Innovation in Gaming\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\\", and \\"Outstanding Innovation Achievement in Game Direction\\" awards, and won the \\"Casual Game of the Year\\" award by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences. It was nominated for the \\"Use of Audio\\" video game awards by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and won the \\"Artistic Achievement\\" award. Its soundtrack was awarded the 2009 \\"Best Original Soundtrack\\" prize from G4. The music was also nominated for the Game Audio Network Guild's \\"Music of the Year\\" award and won the \\"Best Interactive Score\\" award. Its gameplay debut at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo resulted in multiple awards, including \\"Best E3 Download Game\\" from 1UP.com, \\"Best Original Game\\" from UGO, and \\"Special Achievement for Innovation\\" from IGN. In 2012, Flower was listed on Time's All-TIME 100 greatest video games list. In 2011, Flower was chosen through a public vote out of an initial selection of 240 to be one of 80 games showcased in a 2012 exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum titled \\"The Art of Video Games\\". In 2013, the museum acquired the game for its permanent collection. The game was showcased in the 2015 Smithsonian exhibition, Watch This! Revelations in Media Art.

Records show that Canaries has existed since 1763 and the original settlers came from the neighbouring island of Martinique. In 1876 a Catholic School was established and after 1929 there was an infant school and a junior school in the village.

The battle ended in a victory by the French-Papal troops. Background When the first Italian Parliament met in Turin, Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy was proclaimed King of Italy on March 17, 1861, and Rome was declared capital of Italy on March 27, 1861. However, the Italian government could not take its seat in Rome because Emperor Napoleon III maintained a French garrison there to prop up Pope Pius IX. This created an unstable political situation that led to much strife, both internal and external. In 1862 Giuseppe Garibaldi, the hero of the unification, organized an expedition from Sicily, under the slogan Roma o Morte (Rome or Death) that attempted to take Rome. However, after crossing the Straits of Messina, the expedition was stopped at Aspromonte (known as the Aspromonte incident of 1862) by Italian troops. Garibaldi was wounded, taken prisoner, but subsequently released. This act was forced on the Italian government by Napoleon III, who threatened military intervention if Garibaldi were not stopped. On September 15, 1864, the September Convention was signed by the Italian government and Napoleon III. The Italian government agreed to protect the Papal States against external menaces and agreed to move the capital of Italy from Turin to Florence. The French garrison would be withdrawn from Rome within two years, during which time the Papal army would reorganize itself into a credible force. This unpopular agreement led to numerous riots (primarily in Turin which objected to its loss of status) and to renewed demands for the Italian government to take possession of its capital, Rome. Garibaldi's expedition On August 12, 1866, in the aftermath of the Third Italian War of Independence, Italy gained Mantua and Venice. Now only Rome and its neighbourhood were missing to complete the territorial unity of the state. In December of the same year, the last French battalions embarked from Civitavecchia to France. On September 9, 1867, at a congress in Geneva, Garibaldi declared that the Papacy was \\"the negation of God ... shame and plague of Italy\\". At the time, his popularity was at its apex, since he was the only Italian general who had obtained significant successes during the last war against Austria. He was therefore left free to organize a small army of about 10,000 volunteers. The plan was to march against Rome, while a riot was to break out inside the city. However, Garibaldi's overt moves allowed the French emperor Napoleon III to send a relief force in time to Rome. Apart from this official support, the Papal army was at the time composed mostly of French and European volunteers. Invasion of Lazio Victory of French Zouaves Garibaldi's volunteers invaded Lazio, the region that contains Rome, in October 1867. A small contingent, led by Enrico Cairoli with his brother Giovanni and 70 companions, made a daring attempt to take Rome. The group embarked in Terni and floated down the Tiber. Their arrival in Rome was to coincide with an uprising inside the city. On 22 October 1867, the revolutionaries inside Rome seized control of the Capitoline Hill and of Piazza Colonna. In the meantime, Giuseppe Monti and Gaetano Tognetti let explode a mine under the caserma Serristori in Borgo, which was the seat of the Papal Zouaves, devastating the building and killing 27 persons. However, when the Cairoli and their companions arrived at Villa Glori, on the northern outskirts of Rome, the uprising had already been suppressed. During the night of 22 October 1867, the group was surrounded by Papal Zouaves, and Giovanni was severely wounded. Enrico was mortally wounded and bled to death in Giovanni's arms. At the summit of Villa Glori, near the spot where Enrico died, there is a plain white column dedicated to the Cairoli brothers and their 70 companions. About 100 meters to the left from the top of the Spanish Steps, there is a bronze monument of Giovanni holding the dying Enrico in his arm. A plaque lists the names of their companions. Giovanni never recovered from his wounds and from the tragic events of 1867. According to an eyewitness,Rosi, Michele (1929) I Cairoli, L. Capelli Ed., Bologna, pp. 223‚Äì224 when Giovanni died on 11 September 1869: The last group of rebels inside Rome, in the quarter of Trastevere, was bloodily captured on October 25. The captured Roman rebels were executed in 1868. Garibaldi with about 8,100 men, had reached the neighbourhood of Rome, occupying Tivoli, Acquapendente and Monterotondo. Here he halted his march, waiting for an insurrection which never occurred. Minor fights ensued, but without relevant results. Three days later he advanced on the Via Nomentana, in order to spur the rebels to action, but returned to Monterotondo the following day. On the same day, Italian troops had crossed the boundary to halt the Garibaldine army, and a French force had disembarked in Civitavecchia. Battle In the first hours of November 3, the Papal troops, under general Hermann Kanzler, and the French expeditionary corps, under general Balthazar de Polh√®s, moved from Rome to attack Garibaldi's army along the Via Nomentana. The Allies were well trained and organized, and the French troops were armed with the new Chassepot rifle; Garibaldi's volunteers were less well organized, and nearly without any artillery or cavalry, apart a small squadron led by Garibaldi's son, Ricciotti. The Papal vanguards met Garibaldi's volunteers about 1.5 km south of the village Mentana, midway from Rome to Monterotondo. The three battalions defending the position were quickly dislodged. However, Garibaldi's resistance stiffened in the fortified village, and repeated Papal attacks were all pushed back until nightfall. The situation changed when three companies of Zouaves occupied the road from Mentana and Monterotondo. Garibaldi intervened in person, but could not prevent his troops being routed. The survivors entrenched in the castle of Mentana; some surrendered the following morning, and others fled to Monterotondo. On November 4 Garibaldi retreated to the Kingdom of Italy with 5,100 men. In Mentana, the monument Ara dei Caduti (Altar of the Fallen) is built over the mass grave of the Italian patriots who died in the battle. Subsequently, a French garrison remained in Civitavecchia until August 1870, when it was recalled following the outbreak of the Franco- Prussian War. Rome was captured by the Italian Army on September 20, 1870, finally giving Italy possession of its capital.

The appearance of such signs reflects the area of brain dysfunction rather than a specific disorder which may be diffuse, such as a dementia, or localised, such as a tumor. One reflex thought to have good localizing value is the palmar grasp reflex which usually signifies damage to the frontal lobe of the opposite side. The glabellar reflex or \\"glabellar tap\\" is present in individuals with extrapyramidal disorders such as Parkinson's disease. These reflexes are believed to be \\"hard-wired\\" before birth, and are therefore able to be elicited in the newborn. As the brain matures, certain areas (usually within the frontal lobes) exert an inhibitory effect, thus causing the reflex to disappear. When disease processes disrupt these inhibitory pathways, the reflex is \\"released\\" from inhibition and can be elicited once again, hence the term \\"frontal release sign\\". Some frontal release signs and their role in infancy: * Palmar grasp: Baby naturally grabs objects placed in palm. * Palmomental reflex: stroking on the thenar eminence of the hand causes contraction of sub mental muscles . * Rooting reflex: Baby finds breast to suckle. * Sucking reflex: Baby sucks breast / bottle / teat to get milk. * Snout reflex: Involved in suckling. * Glabellar reflex: May protect eyes in certain situations.

Segal (August 2, 1945 ‚Äì February 13, 2011) was a scholar of ancient religions, specializing in Judaism's relationship to Christianity. Segal was a distinguished scholar, author, and speaker, self-described as a \\"believing Jew and twentieth-century humanist.\\" Segal was one of the first modern scholars to write extensively on the influences of Judaism (including Second Temple Rabbinic texts, Merkabah mysticism, and Jewish apocalypticism) on Paul of Damascus. Segal was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College (B.A., 1967), Brandeis University (M.A., 1969), Hebrew Union College- Jewish Institute of Religion (Bachelor of Hebrew Letters, 1971), and Yale University (M.A., 1971; M.Phil., 1973; and Ph.D., 1975). At the time of his retirement, Segal was Professor Emeritus of Religion and Ingeborg Rennert Professor Emeritus of Judaic Studies at Barnard College and held a concurrent appointment as Adjunct Professor of Scripture at Union Theological Seminary. He had also taught at Princeton University and the University of Toronto. Segal was an expert in the field of history and religious traditions of Judaism and Christianity of the Roman period, and on the Semitic languages in use in Israel in that period. His scholarly reputation commenced with his landmark book, Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports About Christianity and Gnosticism (1977), in which he explored early references in rabbinic texts that he proposed were directed against beliefs of Jewish Christians and gnostics. His 1986 book, Rebecca's Children, was a sensitive study showing that rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity were sibling developments from the parent biblical tradition. His award-winning book, Paul the Convert (1990) was Editor's Choice and main selection of the History Book Club's summer 1990 list, and a selection of the Book of the Month Club. The 368 page text is a collection of studies that interprets Paul within the context of Jewish mysticism and history, providing unique depth and insight for Biblical exegetes and Jewish historians. His last book, Life After Death: A History of the Afterlife in Western Religion (2004) was a massive study of beliefs spanning from ancient near-eastern civilizations to the present and across various religious traditions. Life After Death is \\"considered one of the definitive treatments of that weighty subject ‚Äî and was weighty in its own right, at 731 pages.\\" It was a selection of the History Book Club, the Book of the Month Club, and the Behavioral Science Book Club. It also featured on the Leonard Lopate Show, Talk of the Nation, and was the cover story of the Globe and Mail Book Review Supplement (Toronto). In addition, he wrote numbers articles and chapters in scholarly books. Segal gave conference presentations and lectures internationally. He was a founding member of the Society of Biblical Literature program unit on Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism, and the SBL program unit on Divine Mediators in Antiquity. In 1988, he was the first Jewish member of the Society for New Testament Studies to address the society. He was elected a member of the American Society for the Study of Religion and the first American living outside Canada to be elected President of the Canadian Society for Biblical Studies. Until Segal's book Paul the Convert was published in 1990, most modern Biblical scholars failed to take into account the Jewishness of Paul and the vast majority of Jewish historians ignored Paul altogether because of his perceived anti-Semitic writing. Segal argues in Paul the Convert that despite Paul's polemical rhetoric, the Jewish community must nevertheless consider the historical value of Paul's epistles because of the insights he provides into first century Hellenisic Judaism. Segal's exegetical concern is with the Jewish context of Paul's religious struggle following his conversion. He reads Paul's epistles in light of the social sciences, borrowing from modern sociological and psychological studies (especially those pertaining to conversion). He also examines Paul through the lens of Jewish Merkabah mysticism and the Rabbinic tradition ‚Äì a pioneering method of study of the New Testament. Segal argues that in order to understand Paul thoroughly, one must understand the circumstances of his time and culture. Segal draws similarities between things like Paul's description of his conversion on the road to Damascus (2 Cor. 12:1-9) and Ezekiel and Enoch's heavenly ascent. He argues that Paul's emphasis on the Glory of God (Kavod) in these stories is characteristic of the Merkabah mystic tradition. The type of exegesis that Segal engages in provides a rare insight into first century thinking. Segal understands Paul as part of Jewish history; he interprets Paul's conversion as an apostasy and a break from Judaism because of his insistence on transformation in Christ, although Paul never perceived his actions as outside the Jewish community (Acts 21:24). Paul, Segal argues, never felt that he had left Judaism, \\"He began as a Pharisee and became a convert from Pharisaism. He spent the rest of his life trying to express what he converted to. He never gave it a single name.\\" Paul's conversion experience, Segal argues, forced him to re-evaluate his faith and understanding of the Torah; he was made to reconcile his revelation with his Pharasaism.

Segal, who was opposed to Abu El Haj's tenure bid, told The New York Times that \\"there is every reason in the world to want her to have tenure, and only one reason against it ‚Äî her work, I believe it is not good enough.\\" Segal wrote a critique of Abu El Haj's book Facts on the Ground for the Columbia Daily Spectator, in which he said that the reasons for which he opposed tenure for Abu El Haj were professional, not personal.

Launches made with the related Feng Bao 1 carrier rocket are not included.  Launch statistics  Rockets from the Long March family have accumulated 349 launches . Of these, 331 were successful, 11 were failures, and 7 were partial failures. The cumulative success rate is .  Anomalies and failures  A success is a launch that deploys all payloads into the correct orbit without damage. The launch vehicle may experience an anomaly that does not affect the mission. The payload may experience an anomaly that was not caused by the launch. * On 29 November 1994, the Long March 3A successfully deployed Chinasat-5 into geostationary transfer orbit. However, the satellite failed to reach geostationary orbit due to a propellant leak. * On 3 November 2016, the Long March 5 experienced an anomaly in the second stage, failing to deploy the stack into the correct geostationary transfer orbit. However, the third stage was able to compensate for the performance shortfall with a longer burn. A partial failure is a launch that reaches orbit, but at least one payload was not deployed into the correct orbit without damage. After a partial failure, a satellite may operate at reduced functionality or with a reduced lifetime. A common type of partial failure occurs when a satellite is deployed into a lower than intended orbit. The satellite can maneuver with its own propulsion system to reach the correct orbit, but this reduces the fuel available for station-keeping and shortens its operational life. * On 29 January 1984, the maiden launch of the Long March 3 failed to reach geostationary transfer orbit. * On 28 December 1991, the Long March 3 failed to deploy the payload into geostationary transfer orbit. * On 28 November 1995, the Long March 2E damaged AsiaSat 2 by subjecting it to excessive forces during the launch. The satellite was unable to broadcast to its full coverage area. * On 18 August 1996, the Long March 3 failed to deploy the payload into geostationary transfer orbit. * On 31 August 2009, the Long March 3B failed to deploy the payload into geostationary transfer orbit. The satellite reached the intended orbit with its own propulsion system. * On 28 December 2016, the Long March 2D failed to deploy the payloads into sun-synchronous orbit. The primary payloads reached the correct orbit with their own propulsion systems, but the secondary payload had no propulsion system and reentered two months later. * On 18 June 2017, the Long March 3B failed to deploy ChinaSat 9A into geostationary transfer orbit. The satellite maneuvered 10 times over a one-month period to reach the correct orbit. A failure is a launch that destroys the satellite or does not deploy it into earth orbit. * On 5 November 1974, the Long March 2 lost control during its maiden launch. * On 21 December 1992, the Long March 2E experienced a structural failure of the payload fairing, destroying the Optus B2 communications satellite. * On 25 January 1995, the Long March 2E experienced another structural failure in the payload fairing, destroying the Apstar 2 communications satellite. * On 14 February 1996, the Long March 3B lost its guidance platform and veered off course, hitting a nearby village and killing at least 6 people. * On 18 August 2011, the Long March 2C lost attitude control. * On 9 December 2013, the Long March 4B experienced an early shutdown of its third stage and failed to reach orbit. * On 31 August 2016, the Long March 4C failed to reach orbit. * On 2 July 2017, the Long March 5 experienced an anomaly in its first stage and failed to reach orbit. * On 22 May 2019, the Long March 4C failed to reach orbit due to a problem with its third stage. * On 16 March 2020, the first Long March 7A failed to reach orbit. * On 9 April 2020, the Long March 3B failed to reach orbit with the Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua) satellite due to third stage failure.

The period from 1746 to 1761, brought several artists with ducal patronage to Marchena. An example is Manuel Salvador Carmona (1734 1829), the engraver who created the altarpiece for the Brotherhood of Correa at the monastery of San Agust√≠n de Marchena.Caballos E. and Nogales F.

San Sebasti√°n Church The Iglesia de San Sebastian was constructed outside the walls of the ducal palace as an hermitage. In the 18th century, the building was demolished due to its poor repair and then rebuilt. The nave has three sections, separated by pillars. The main section is decorated in wood panelling. The main altarpiece was constructed in the mid 18th century in the Baroque style. The three streets outside are marked by crucifixes located about statues of San Sebasti√°n and San Pablo. Inside, there is a 16th-century sculpture of the Crucified Christ.ixteenth century. The main entrance is dated 1823. Points of interest=Zurbar√°n Museum This museum is named after the artist Francisco de Zurbaran (1598 1664) who received patronage from the lords of Marchena. The museum is located in the Iglesia de San Juan Bautista. In the sacristy are nine paintings. They depict the Crucifixion, the Immaculate Conception, Saint Peter, James, son of Zebedee (Sao Tiago), John the Evangelist (Juan Evangelista), Bartholomew the Apostle (Bartolom√©), Paul the Apostle (Pablo) and Saint Andrew the Apostle (Andr√©s). Zurbaran was commissioned to paint the figures in 1634. He delivered the paintings in 1637. The most notable of the canvases are the Immaculate, due to its objective and meticulous treatment of the tissues, and the Crucifixion, due to the study of light through moonlight. The museum also displays a set of 15th century to late 16th century liturgical miniature books; a vestment in black velvet and gold thread; and a rain coat embroidered with liturgical figures. In the church are displayed gold decorations by the silversmiths Francisco de Alfaro (c. 1548 1615) and Marco Beltr√°n. The works include the Beheading of Saint John the Baptist. It is 162 cm in height depicting a temple in Renaissance style where the decollation takes place. There is a silver and gold chalice, with four saints in the center in enamel and the four evangelists highlighted at the base. There is also a depiction of the Crucifixion dated 1592. Other items include an ampolleta to take the Holy Oil to the sick; an acetre (small cauldron) containing hyssop (medicinal plant); and a \\"virile\\" (a small container meant to fit in a larger one). The works of Marcos Beltr√°n are a chalice of golden silver and a portapaz of the same raw material. From the Baroque period stand the candelabra and altarpieces carved by Juan de Orea. In addition to the above, there are innumerable objects of minor authors but of great historical-artistic interest. Lorenzo Coullaut Valera museum This museum, located in the Almohade Tower of the at the Gate of Moron in Marchena is named after the sculptor Lorenzo Coullaut Valera (1876 1932) who was born in Marchena.Lorenzo Coullaut Valera Museum Rustic Andalusia website It opened as a permanent exhibition in 1990 to display some of the artist's works, sketches and replicas of works. These works include twenty- three sculptures, three reliefs and two original drawings of an altarpiece. Arco de la Rosa The Arco de la Rosa is a door in Marchena's ancient wall. In approximately 1430, the door was constructed in the gate that would have admitted travellers from Seville, the Puerto de Seville. The work, commissioned by Pedro Ponce de Leon, was officiated by a bull from Pope Martin V. Legend tells that a Moorish Princess had an unrequited love for a Christian captain. The door's name comes from the roses she threw to him. However, the name may relate to the Madonna of the Rose.Mallado A. \\"La leyenda del Arco de la Rosa de Marchena\\" ABC of Sevilla website. 28 September 2014. The door is an arch boarded by two square columns. Above the door is a high crenelated platform. The exterior of the door is decorated with embossed stone shields. The original gate had a ramp entrance. This was changed to steps when the door was constructed. Other Other points of interest include Iglesia de San Miguel, Iglesia de Santo Domingo and the Iglesia de Santa Clara. Also, there are the Convent of Santa Isabel, the Convent of San Andr√©s and the Convent of the Immaculate Conception, the Ducal Palace and Cilla del Cabildo.

In 2006, a photo album created by H√∂cker (the H√∂cker Album), with some 116 pictures from his time at Auschwitz, was given to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, sparking new interest in his activities as a concentration camp administrator. Early life and family The youngest of six children, H√∂cker was born in the village of Engershausen (now part of Preu√üisch Oldendorf), Germany. His father was a construction worker, who was later killed in action during World War I. Following an apprenticeship as bank teller he worked at a bank in L√ºbbecke before being made redundant. After having been unemployed for two and a half years, he joined the SS in October 1933 and the Nazi Party in May 1937. Concentration camp administrator On 16 November 1939 he joined the 9th SS Infantry Regiment based at Danzig and, in 1940, became the adjutant to the commanding SS officer of the Neuengamme concentration camp, Martin Gottfried Weiss. In 1942 Weiss was also the commanding officer of the Arbeitsdorf concentration camp with H√∂cker serving as his adjutant. Before being transferred in May 1943 to the Majdanek concentration camp, again as adjutant to Weiss, H√∂cker followed a course at the SS military academy (Junkerschule) in Braunschweig. During the same period he also received some military training. In 1943, he became the adjutant to the commandant at Majdanek during the Operation Reinhardt mass deportations and murders. Afterward, he became adjutant to Richard Baer, in 1944, who was previously deputy to WVHA chief Oswald Pohl in Berlin. In May 1944 H√∂cker was transferred to Auschwitz, where he remained until the advance of the Soviet Red Army forced camp evacuation in January 1945. Thereafter, he was transferred to the Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp along with Baer. The two men administered the camp until the Allies arrived. H√∂cker used false papers to flee the camp and avoid being identified by the British when they captured him. Post-war trials He married before the war and had a son and daughter during the war, with whom he was reunited after his release from 18 months in a British POW camp in 1946. Early in the 1960s he was apprehended by West German authorities in his hometown, where he was a bank official. It is not known why the bank rehired and promoted him after a long absence. At his trial in Frankfurt, part of the noted Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials, H√∂cker denied having participated in the selection of victims at Birkenau or having ever personally executed a prisoner. He further denied any knowledge of the fate of the approximately 400,000 Hungarian Jews who were murdered at Auschwitz during his term of service at the camp. H√∂cker was shown to have knowledge of the genocidal activities at the camp, but could not be proved to have played a direct part in them. In post-war trials, H√∂cker denied his involvement in the selection process. While accounts from survivors and other SS officers all but placed him there, prosecutors could locate no conclusive evidence to prove the claim. In August 1965 H√∂cker was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for aiding and abetting in over 1,000 murders at Auschwitz. He was released in 1970 and was able to return to his bank post as a chief cashier, where he worked until his retirement. On 3 May 1989 a district court in the Germany city of Bielefeld sentenced H√∂cker to four years imprisonment for his involvement in gassing to death prisoners, primarily Polish Jews, in the concentration camp Majdanek in Poland. Camp records showed that between May 1943 and May 1944 H√∂cker had acquired at least 3,610 kilograms of Zyklon B poisonous gas for use in Majdanek from the Hamburg firm of Tesch & Stabenow.Justiz und NS-Verbrechen Auschwitz photo album In 2006, a photo album created by H√∂cker came to the attention of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum; the album contains rare images of the life of German functionaries at Auschwitz while the camp remained in operation, including some of the few photos of Josef Mengele at Auschwitz.\\"Nazi Scrapbooks from Hell\\" , National Geographic Channel. November 30, 2008. H√∂cker died in 2000, still claiming that he had nothing to do with the death camp at Birkenau. During his final statement at the Frankfurt Trial in 1965, he had claimed, ‚ÄúI only learned about the events in Birkenau‚Ä¶in the course of time I was there‚Ä¶ and I had nothing to do with that. I had no ability to influence these events in any way‚Ä¶neither did I want them, nor carry them out. I didn‚Äôt hurt anybody‚Ä¶ and neither did any one die at Auschwitz because of me.‚Äù H√∂cker testified that he never set foot on the ramp during the selection process, despite one survivor recalling an officer with the surname H√∂cker being present on the ramp. A documentary airing on The National Geographic Channel, \\"Scrapbook from Nazi Hell\\", examined the claims made by former prisoners at Auschwitz that there was a German officer with the surname H√∂cker present on the ramp during the selection process. Photographic analysts used data gained from measurements of H√∂cker in the several photographs in his album. Measurements from photogrammetric analysis, along with the height listed in his SS service records, were compared to a figure found in two of the photos from the \\"Auschwitz Album\\" (made by SS photographers) whose face cannot be seen. The SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer, whose face cannot be seen because his back is facing the camera, is shown on the ramp where the new arrivals disembarked from the trains and went through the \\"selection\\" process (the sorting of prisoners healthy enough to be useful as forced labor, in contrast with the sick, the elderly, women with small children, and children, who were sent immediately to the gas chambers). It is significant to note that during his trial and for the rest of his life, Karl H√∂cker vehemently denied that he had anything to do with killing, and was never present or participated in the selection process. The results of the measurements gleaned from the \\"H√∂cker Album\\" showed that there was almost an exact match to the SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer shown on the ramp during selection, though barring definitive eyewitness testimony, it is nearly impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the man in the photo is indeed H√∂cker. The LAPD Sr Forensic Image Analyst who consulted on the measurements taken from the photos believes that there is enough evidence to say that the man is most likely H√∂cker. There is, however, one significant discrepancy between H√∂cker and the Nazi on the ramp. Karl H√∂cker, in May 1944 upon his appointment as Adjutant to the Camp Commandant, held the rank of SS- Obersturmf√ºrher (first lieutenant), yet the unknown SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer (technical sergeant) uniform insignia does not match that rank. As a possible explanation for this, it was posited by the documentary that H√∂cker may have worn the uniform of lower ranking to conceal his true identity. Barring concrete evidence, all the above is conjecture.

The members of the Russian section of the First International supported Marx in his struggle against the Bakuninist anarchists, propagated the revolutionary ideas of the International, did what they could to strengthen the ties between the Russian revolutionary movement and its Western-European counterpart, and took part in the working-class movements of Switzerland and the French Third Republic. However the members of the Russian section were not consistent Marxists their views still contained much of Narodnik utopianism, specifically they idealised the village community, calling it ‚Äúa great achievement of the Russian people.‚Äù The section failed to establish close ties with the revolutionary movement in Russia, which, in the final analysis, was the main reason for its collapse in 1872.What the ‚ÄúFriends of the People‚Äù Are and How They Fight the Social- Democrats by Vladimir Lenin References Category:Defunct socialist parties in Russia Category:Political parties established in 1870 Category:Political parties in the Russian Empire ","title":"Group of Narodnik Socialists"},{"id":"13362901","text":"Geologically one of the youngest inhabited territories on Earth, Easter Island, located in the mid-Pacific Ocean, was, for most of its history, one of the most isolated.

Location of Easter Island in the South Pacific Ocean  First settlers  Early European visitors to Easter Island recorded the local oral traditions about the original settlers. In these traditions, Easter Islanders claimed that a chief Hotu Matu'aResemblance of the name to an early Mangarevan founder god Atu Motua (\\"Father Lord\\") has made some historians suspect that Hotu Matua was added to Easter Island mythology only in the 1860s, along with adopting the Mangarevan language. The \\"real\\" founder would have been Tu'u ko Iho, who became just a supporting character in Hotu Matu'a centric legends. See Steven Fischer (1994).

They are believed to have been Polynesian. There is considerable uncertainty about the accuracy of this legend as well as the date of settlement. Published literature suggests the island was settled around 300‚Äì400 CE, or at about the time of the arrival of the earliest settlers in Hawaii. Some scientists say that Easter Island was not inhabited until 700‚Äì800 CE. This date range is based on glottochronological calculations and on three radiocarbon dates from charcoal that appears to have been produced during forest clearance activities.Diamond, Jared. Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. Penguin Books: 2005. . Chapter 2: Twilight at Easter pp.79‚Äì119. See page 89. Moreover, a recent study which included radiocarbon dates from what is thought to be very early material suggests that the island was settled as recently as 1200 CE.Hunt, T. L., Lipo, C. P., 2006. Science, 1121879. See also \\"Late Colonization of Easter Island\\" in Science Magazine. Entire article is also hosted by the Department of Anthropology of the University of Hawaii. This seems to be supported by a 2006 study of the island's deforestation, which could have started around the same time. A large now extinct palm, Paschalococos disperta, related to the Chilean wine palm (Jubaea chilensis), was one of the dominant trees as attested by fossil evidence; this species, whose sole occurrence was Easter Island, became extinct due to deforestation by the early settlers.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Chilean Wine Palm: Jubaea chilensis, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg The Austronesian Polynesians, who first settled the island, are likely to have arrived from the Marquesas Islands from the west. These settlers brought bananas, taro, sugarcane, and paper mulberry, as well as chickens and Polynesian rats. The island at one time supported a relatively advanced and complex civilization. It is suggested that the reason settlers sought an isolated island was because of high levels of Ciguatera fish poisoning in their then-current surrounding area.  South American links  The Norwegian botanist and explorer Thor Heyerdahl (and many others) has documented that cultural similarities exist between Easter Island and South American Indian cultures. He has suggested that this most likely came from some settlers arriving from the continent.Heyderdahl, Thor. Easter Island ‚Äì The Mystery Solved. Random House New York 1989. According to local legends, a group of people called hanau epe (meaning either \\"long eared\\" or \\"stocky\\" people) came into conflict with another group called the hanau momoko (either \\"short eared\\" or \\"slim\\" people).Sebastian Englert's Rapa Nui dictionary with original Spanish translated to English. After mutual suspicions erupted in a violent clash, the hanau epe were overthrown and nearly exterminated, leaving only one survivor.The \\"Hanau Eepe\\", their Immigration and Extermination. Various interpretations of this story have been made ‚Äì that it represents a struggle between natives and incoming migrants; that it recalls inter-clan warfare; or that represents a class conflict.John Flenley, Paul G. Bahn, The Enigmas of Easter Island: Island on the Edge, Oxford University Press, 2003, pp.76; 154. Traditionally the sweet potato has been cited as evidence of contact between the two cultures: this staple of the pre-contact Polynesian diet is of South American origin. However, recent evidence suggests the sweet potatoes grown by Polynesians diverged from American sweet potatoes long before Polynesia was inhabited, leaving natural long-distance dispersal as the most plausible explanation for the presence of sweet potatoes, but not necessarily excluding the possibility of pre-historic contact. It is hypothesized that Polynesians traveled to South America and back, or South American balsa rafts drifted to Polynesia, possibly unable to make a return trip because of their less developed navigational skills and more fragile boats. Polynesian connections in South America have been claimed to exist among the Mapuches in central and southern Chile.Mapuche Indians and Polynesian connections. The Polynesian name for the small islet of Sala y G√≥mez (Manu Motu Motiro Hiva, \\"Bird's islet on the way to a far away land\\") east of Easter Island has also been seen as a hint that South America was known before European contacts. Further complicating the situation is that the word Hiva (\\"far away land\\") was also the name of the islanders' legendary home country. Inexplicable insistence on an eastern origin for the first inhabitants was unanimous among the islanders in all early accounts.This was recorded e.g. by the British B. F. Clark in 1877. See Heyerdahl. Jacob Roggeveen's expedition of 1722 gives us our first description of the islanders. They were \\"of all shades of colour, yellow, white and brown\\" and they distended their ear lobes so greatly with large disks that when they took them out they could \\"hitch the rim of the lobe over the top of the ear\\".ROUTLEDGE, Katherine. 1919. The Mystery of Easter Island.The story of an expedition. London. page 201 Roggeveen also noted how some of the islanders were \\"generally large in stature\\". Islanders' tallness was also witnessed by the Spanish who visited the island in 1770, measuring heights of 196 and 199 cm.See Heyerdahl. DNA sequence analysis of Easter Island's current inhabitants indicates that the 36 people living on Rapa Nui who survived the devastating internecine wars, slave raids and epidemics of the 19th century and had any offspring, were Polynesian. Furthermore, examination of skeletons offers evidence of only Polynesian origins for Rapa Nui living on the island after 1680.VAN TILBURG, Jo Anne. 1994.

Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press. page 104464 skeletons ‚Äì definitely Polynesian  Pre-European society  Ahu Tongariki near Rano Raraku, a 15-moai ahu excavated and restored in the 1990s According to legends recorded by the missionaries in the 1860s, the island originally had a very clear class system, with an ariki, king, wielding absolute God-like power ever since Hotu Matua had arrived on the island. The most visible element in the culture was production of massive moai that were part of the ancestral worship. With a strictly unified appearance, moai were erected along most of the coastline, indicating a homogeneous culture and centralized governance. In addition to the royal family, the island's habitation consisted of priests, soldiers and commoners. The ariki mau, Kai Mako'i 'Iti, along with his grandson Mau Rata, died in the 1860s while serving as an indentured servant in Peru. Motu Nui islet, part of the Birdman Cult ceremony For unknown reasons, a coup by military leaders called matatoa had brought a new cult based around a previously unexceptional god, Make-make. In the cult of the birdman (Rapa Nui: tangata manu), a competition was established in which every year a representative of each clan, chosen by the leaders, would swim across shark- infested waters to Motu Nui, a nearby islet, to search for the season's first egg laid by a manutara (sooty tern). The first swimmer to return with an egg and successfully climb back up the cliff to Orongo would be named \\"Birdman of the year\\" and secure control over distribution of the island's resources for his clan for the year. The tradition was still in existence at the time of first contact by Europeans but was suppressed by Christian missionaries in the 1860s.  The \\"statue-toppling\\"  European accounts in 1722 (Dutch) and 1770 (Spanish) reported seeing only standing statues, but by James Cook's visit in 1774 many were reported toppled. The huri mo'ai ‚Äì the \\"statue-toppling\\" ‚Äì continued into the 1830s as a part of internal conflicts among islanders. By 1838, the only standing moai were on the slopes of Rano Raraku and Hoa Hakananai'a at Orongo. In about 60 years, islanders had for some reason (possibly civil struggle between tribes) deliberately damaged this part of their ancestors' heritage.Fischer, Steven Roger. Island at the end of the World ‚Äì The Turbulent History of Easter Island. Reaktion Books Ltd. 2005. . See page 64. In modern times, moai have been restored at Anakena, Ahu Tongariki, Ahu Akivi and Hanga Roa.  European contacts  1770 Gonz√°lez de Ahedo expedition's maps of Easter Island (Isla de San Carlos). Original north- down manuscript map of Easter Island, Collection of Naval Museum of Madrid; original manuscript map of Spanish anchorage at Easter Island, Jack Daulton Collection, Los Altos Hills, California. La P√©rouse map Map of traditional clan districts The first-recorded European contact with the island took place on 5 April (Easter Sunday) 1722 when Dutch navigator Jacob Roggeveen visited for a week and estimated there were 2,000 to 3,000 inhabitants on the island. This was an estimate, not a census, and archaeologists estimate the population may have been as high as 10,000 to 12,000 a few decades earlier. His party reported \\"remarkable, tall, stone figures, a good 30 feet in height\\", the island had rich soil and a good climate and \\"all the country was under cultivation\\". Fossil-pollen analysis shows that the main trees on the island had gone 72 years earlier in 1650. The Dutch reported that a fight broke out in which they killed ten or twelve islanders. The next foreign visitors arrived on 15 November 1770: two Spanish ships, San Lorenzo and Santa Rosalia, sent by the Viceroy of Peru, Manuel de Amat, and commanded by Felipe Gonz√°lez de Ahedo. They spent five days on the island, performing a very thorough survey of its coast, and named it Isla de San Carlos, taking possession on behalf of King Charles III of Spain, and ceremoniously erected three wooden crosses on top of three small hills on Poike.Jo Anne Van Tilburg. \\"Easter Island, Archaeology, Ecology and Culture\\". British Museum Press, London, 1994. Four years later, in mid-March 1774, British explorer James Cook visited Easter Island. Cook himself was too sick to walk far, but a small group explored the island. They reported the statues as being neglected with some having fallen down; no sign of the three crosses and his botanist described it as \\"a poor land\\". He had a Tahitian interpreter who could partially understand the language. Other than in counting, though, the language was unintelligible. Cook later estimated that there were about 700 people on the island. He saw only three or four canoes, all unseaworthy. Parts of the island were cultivated with banana, sugarcane, and sweet potatoes, while other parts looked like they had once been cultivated but had fallen into disuse. Georg Forster reported in his account that he saw no trees over ten feet tall on the island. On 10 April 1786 the French explorer Jean Fran√ßois de Galaup La P√©rouse visited and made a detailed map of Easter Island. He described the island as one-tenth cultivated and estimated that the population of the island was around two thousand. In 1804 the Russian ship Neva visited under the command of Yuri Lisyansky. In 1816 the Russian ship Rurik visited under the command of Otto von Kotzebue. In 1825 the British ship HMS Blossom visited  Destruction of society and population  A series of devastating events killed almost the entire population of Easter Island in the 1860s. Such devastating events that contributed to the downfall and collapse of the Easter Island society can be attributed to the rapid deforestation during the time of moai- construction. The Easter Island palm was used by settlers for means of constructing agricultural tools for their society and aiding in the transport of the Island's statues. It is likely the decline of the palm and the rapid deforestation that took place on the island caused the islanders to start to decline in population while those who survived were forced to completely adapt to their changing environment. In December 1862, Peruvian slave raiders struck Easter Island. Violent abductions continued for several months, eventually capturing or killing around 1500 men and women, about half of the island's population. International protests erupted, escalated by Bishop Florentin- √âtienne Jaussen of Tahiti. The slaves were finally freed in autumn, 1863, but by then most of them had already died of tuberculosis, smallpox and dysentery. Finally, a dozen islanders managed to return from the horrors of Peru, but brought with them smallpox and started an epidemic, which reduced the island's population to the point where some of the dead were not even buried. The first Christian missionary, Eug√®ne Eyraud, arrived in January 1864 and spent most of that year on the island; but mass conversion of the Rapa Nui only came after his return in 1866 with Father Hippolyte Roussel. Two other missionaries arrived with Captain Jean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier. Eyraud contracted tuberculosis during the 1867 island epidemic, which took a quarter of the island's remaining population of 1,200, with only 930 Rapanui remaining. The dead included the last ariki mau, the last East Polynesia royal first-born son, the 13-year-old Manu Rangi. Eyraud died of tuberculosis in August 1868, by which time almost the entire Rapa Nui population had become Roman Catholic.  Dutrou-Bornier  Jean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier ‚Äì who had served as an artillery officer in the Crimean War, but was later arrested in Peru, accused of arms dealing and sentenced to death, to be released after intervention from the French consul ‚Äì first came to Easter Island in 1866 when he transported two missionaries there, returned in 1867 to recruit laborers for coconut plantations, and then came again for good in April 1868, burning the yacht he had arrived in. He was to have a long-lasting impact on the island. Dutrou- Bornier set up residence at Mataveri, aiming to cleanse the island of most of the Rapa Nui and turn the island into a sheep ranch. He married Koreto, a Rapa Nui, and appointed her Queen, tried to persuade France to make the island a protectorate, and recruited a faction of Rapa Nui whom he allowed to abandon their Christianity and revert to their previous faith. With rifles, a cannon, and hut burning supporters, he ran the island for several years.Steven R Fischer The island at the end of the world. Reaktion Books 2005 Dutrou- Bornier bought up all of the island apart from the missionaries' area around Hanga Roa and moved a couple hundred Rapa Nui to Tahiti to work for his backers. In 1871 the missionaries, having fallen out with Dutrou-Bornier, evacuated 275 Rapa Nui to Mangareva and Tahiti, leaving only 230 on the island.Steven R Fischer (2005) The island at the end of the world Reaktion Books p. 113. Katherine Routledge The Mystery of Easter Island p. 208 put the number remaining on the island at 171. Those who remained were mostly older men. Six years later, there were just 111 people living on Easter Island. \\"Queen Mother\\" Koreto with her daughters \\"Queen\\" Caroline and Harriette in 1877 In 1876 Dutrou-Bornier was murdered in an argument over a dress, though his kidnapping of pubescent girls may also have motivated his killers.Steven R Fischer The Island at the End of the World. Reaktion Books 2005 page 120 Neither his first wife back in France, who was heir under French law, nor his second wife on the island, who briefly installed their daughter Caroline as Queen, were to keep much from his estate. But to this day much of the island is a ranch controlled from off-island and for more than a century real power on the island was usually exercised by resident non-Rapa Nui living at Mataveri. An unusual number of shipwrecks had left the island better supplied with wood than for many generations, whilst legal wrangles over Dutrou- Bornier's land deals were to complicate the island's history for decades to come  1878‚Äì1888  Alexander Salmon, Jr was the brother of the Queen of Tahiti, the son of an English merchant adventurer, and a member of the mercantile dynasty that had bankrolled Dutrou-Bornier. He arrived on the island in 1878 with some fellow Tahitians and returning Rapa Nui and ran the island for a decade. As well as producing wool he encouraged the manufacture of Rapa Nui artworks, a trade that thrives to this day. It was this era of peace and recovery that saw the linguistic change from old Rapa Nui to the Tahitian-influenced modern Rapa Nui language, and some changes to the island's myths and culture to accommodate other Polynesian and Christian influences (notably, Ure, the old Rapa Nui word for \\"penis\\", was dropped from many people's names).Steven R Fischer The island at the end of the world. Reaktion Books 2005 pages 123‚Äì131 This era saw archaeological and ethnographic studies, one in 1882 by the Germans on the gunboat , and again in 1886 by the American sloop , whose crew excavated Ahu Vinapu with dynamite. Father Roussel made a number of pastoral visits in the decade, but the only permanent representatives of the church were Rapa Nui catechists including, from 1884, Angata, one of the Rapa Nui who had left with the missionaries in 1871. Despite the lack of a resident priest to celebrate mass regularly, the Rapa Nui had returned to Roman Catholicism, but there remained some tension between temporal and spiritual power as Father Roussel disapproved of Salmon because of his Jewish paternity.Steven R Fischer The island at the end of the world. Reaktion Books 2005 page 124  Annexation to Chile  On 8 March 1837, under the command of Teniente de Marina Leoncio Se√±oret, the ship of the Chilean Navy Colo Colo sailed off from Valpara√≠so bound for Australia.Marcos Moncada Astudillo in La tradici√≥n naval respecto del primer buque chileno en Isla de Pascua, retrieved on 5 January 2013 Thus, the Colo Colo was the first Chilean ship to visit the Easter Island. Easter Island was annexed by Chile on 9 September 1888 by Policarpo Toro, by means of the \\"Treaty of Annexation of the island\\" (Tratado de Anexi√≥n de la isla), that the government of Chile signed with the Rapa Nui people. Until the 1960s, the surviving Rapa Nui were confined to the settlement of Hanga Roa and the rest of the island was rented to the Williamson-Balfour Company as a sheep, sugar cane and bananas farm until 1953. The island was then managed by the Chilean Navy until 1966 and at that point the rest of the island was reopened.  1914  1914 was an eventful year for the 250 residents of Easter Island. In March, the Routledge Expedition landed and began a 17-month archaeological and ethnographic survey of the island. In October, the German East Asia Squadron including the , , and assembled off Hanga Roa before sailing on to Coronel and the Falklands. In December another German warship, the commerce raider Prinz Eitel Friedrich, visited and released 48 British and French merchant seamen onto the island, supplying much needed labour for the archaeologists.  Today  Until the 1960s the surviving Rapanui were confined to Hanga Roa. The rest of the island was rented to the Williamson-Balfour Company as a sheep farm until 1953. The island was then managed by the Chilean Navy until 1966, at which point the island was reopened in its entirety. In 1966 the Rapanui were given Chilean citizenship. Mataveri International Airport General Pinochet posing with a native Rapa Nui woman Following the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat that brought Augusto Pinochet to power, Easter Island was placed under martial law. Tourism slowed down and private property was \\"restored\\". During his time in power, Pinochet visited Easter Island on three occasions. The military built a number of new military facilities and a new city hall.Lewis, Raymond J. (1994) \\"Review of Rapanui; Tradition and Survival on Easter Island. As a result of an agreement in 1985 between Chile and the United States, the runway at Mataveri International Airport was extended by , reaching , and was re-opened in 1987. Pinochet is reported to have refused to attend the opening ceremony in protest against pressures from the United States to address human rights cases.D√©lano, Manuel (17 August 1987) Pinochet no asiste a la inauguraci√≥n de la pista de la isla de Pascua. El Pais. 21st century On 30 July 2007, a constitutional reform gave Easter Island and the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands (also known as Robinson Crusoe Island) the status of \\"special territories\\" of Chile. Pending the enactment of a special charter, the island continued to be governed as a province of the V Region of Valpara√≠so.Chilean Law 20,193 , National Congress of Chile A total solar eclipse visible from Easter Island occurred for the first time in over 1300 years on 11 July 2010, at 18:15:15. Species of fish were collected in Easter Island for one month in different habitats including shallow lava pools, depths of 43 meters, and deep waters. Within these habitats, two holotypes and paratypes, Antennarius randalli and Antennarius moai, were discovered. These are considered frog-fish because of their characteristics: \\"12 dorsal rays, last two or three branched; bony part of first dorsal spine slightly shorter than second dorsal spine; body without bold zebra-like markings; caudal peduncle short, but distinct; last pelvic ray divided; pectoral rays 11 or 12\\". Indigenous rights movement Starting in August 2010, members of the indigenous Hitorangi clan occupied the Hangaroa Eco Village and Spa. The occupiers allege that the hotel was bought from the Pinochet government, in violation of a Chilean agreement with the indigenous Rapa Nui, in the 1990s. The occupiers say their ancestors had been cheated into giving up the land. According to a BBC report, on 3 December 2010, at least 25 people were injured when Chilean police using pellet guns attempted to evict from these buildings a group of Rapa Nui who had claimed that the land the buildings stood on had been illegally taken from their ancestors. In January 2011, the UN's Special Rapporteur on Indigenous People, James Anaya, expressed concern about the treatment of the indigenous Rapa Nui by the Chilean government, urging Chile to \\"make every effort to conduct a dialogue in good faith with representatives of the Rapa Nui people to solve, as soon as possible the real underlying problems that explain the current situation\\". The incident ended in February 2011, when up to 50 armed police broke into the hotel to remove the final five occupiers. They were arrested by the government and no injuries were reported. Since being given Chilean citizenship in 1966, the Rapa Nui have re-embraced their ancient culture, or what could be reconstructed of it.Diamond, Jared (2005), Collapse: How societies choose to fail or survive, page 112. Mataveri International Airport is the island's only airport. In the 1980s, its runway was lengthened by the U.S. space program to 3,318 m (10,885 ft) so that it could serve as an emergency landing site for the space shuttle. This enabled regular wide body jet services and a consequent increase of tourism on the island, coupled with migration of people from mainland Chile which threatens to alter the Polynesian identity of the island. Land disputes have created political tensions since the 1980s, with part of the native Rapa Nui opposed to private property and in favor of traditional communal property. On 26 March 2015, local minority group Rapa Nui Parliament took control over large parts of the island, throwing out the CONAF park rangers in a non-violent revolution. Their main goal is to obtain independence from Chile. The situation has not yet been resolved.

Military career Forbes was commissioned as a subaltern in the 1st Welsh Guards in 1939. After a short period in Gibraltar, he served as battalion intelligence officer in the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1940. Leading a reconnaissance patrol near Arras in May 1940, he was captured by the Germans. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his conduct. He was held in a series of German prisoner-of-war camps until the end of the war, but was involved in at least 10 attempts to escape from the four prisoner of war camps in which he was detained. He and six others escaped from Oflag IX-A/Z at Rotenburg. He was quickly recaptured and jailed. He was involved in three attempts to escape from Oflag VII-C at Laufen, and three further attempts at Oflag VI-B at D√∂ssel (now part of Warburg). He was moved to Oflag VII-B at Eichst√§tt then back to Oflag IX-A/Z, where another escape bought him eight days of liberty. Recaptured and marched west with other prisoners to prevent being released by the advancing Red Army, he slipped out of the column and managed to reach forward units of the advancing First United States Army, and was quickly returned to England. His escape attempts led to a mention in dispatches in 1945, upgraded to an MBE (Military Division). He continued to serve in the Welsh Guards after the war, in England, Germany and with CENTO forces in Turkey. He retired from the Army as a major in 1958. Later life After leaving the British Army, he worked for Calmic Chemicals, Gillette and Shell- Mex BP until 1964. He was also an amateur painter and sculptor. He retired to Strathdon in Aberdeenshire.

The plot, involving India's Ghadar Party, the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the German Foreign office, was a part of the larger so-called \\"Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy\\", and it was the prime offence cited in the 1917 Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy Trial, described at the time as the longest and most expensive trial in American legal history. Background By 1914, plans for a pan-Indian revolution had been hatched. As World War I broke out, Germany decided to actively support the Ghadar plan. For this, links established between Indian and Irish residents in Germany (including Roger Casement) and the German Foreign office were used to tap into the Indo-Irish network in the United States. In September 1914, the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann- Hollweg authorised German activity against India. The German effort was headed by Max von Oppenheim, archaeologist and the head of the newly formed Intelligence bureau for the east. Upon Oppenheim fell the task of arranging the Indian student groups into a cohesive group. Oppenheim also convinced Har Dayal of the feasibility of the project and was able to establish contact with the Ghadar party in the United States. In an October meeting of the Imperial Naval Office, the consulate in San Francisco was tasked to make contact with Ghadar leaders in California. Naval lieutenant Wilhelm von Brincken was able to establish contact, through Tarak Nath Das and an intermediary named Charles Lattendorf, with Ram Chandra. Arms shipment With the approval of San Francisco German vice-consul E.H. von Schack, arrangements for funds and armaments were secured. Ram Chandra was to receive a monthly payment of $1,000. At the same time $200,000 worth of small arms and ammunition was acquired by the German military attach√© Captain Franz von Papen through a Krupp agent by the name of Hans Tauscher. In the meantime, Papen arranged for Joseph McGarrity to make the necessary arrangements for shipping the arms purchase from New York to Galveston via the Mallory Steamship Company, an Irish-American shipping firm. From Galveston the guns were sent by train to San Diego, where they were to be shipped to India via Burma. However, Charles Martinez, a customs official who had arranged the shipment to San Diego, was not told of the true destination, and hired the schooner Annie Larsen. For this purpose, an elaborate deception was hatched to convey the idea that the arms were meant for the warring factions in Mexico. J. Clyde Hizar, a Colorado attorney in charge of placing the arms on board the Annie Larsen, posed as a representative for the Carranza Faction. This ruse was convincing enough to elicit an offer of $15,000 from the rival Villa faction to divert the shipment to a Villa-controlled port. However, the Annie Larsen was not suitable for a trans-Pacific voyage. Frederick Jebsen, a German reserve naval officer with close connections to the German embassy, arranged for another ship, the , to be purchased under the illusion that it was to be used by \\"American-Asiatic Oil Company\\", a fake oil-trading company, and was to deploy between China and Borneo. The plan was for the Maverick to leave empty from San Pedro around the same time as the Annie Larsen leaves San Diego fully loaded. The two would rendezvous off Socorro Island near Mexico. The Annie Larsen would transfer its shipment to the Maverick which would then proceed towards South-East Asia. For this purpose, Jebsen also established, taking his attorney Ray Howard as partner, a fake company to hide the true ownership of the ship. The Maverick received a crew composed of sailors from two German ships interned at San Francisco. An American by the name of John B. Starr-Hunt served as supercargo on the Maverick, and was under orders to scuttle the ship if challenged by Allied warships. The impression at the docks was that the ship was to relieve congestion in the East Indian Coconut industry, in Java and Borneo. The Annie Larsen sailed for Topolobampo on 8 March 1915 under Captain Paul Schlueter for rendezvous with the SS Maverick. Also placed on board was a person by the name of Walter Page as supercargo. Page's real identity was L. Othmer, the captain of the German bark Atlas, which had earlier been interned by the U.S. government in San Francisco. Page was given complete authority over the ship's movement and he set sail for Socorro Island, off Baja California. However, at this stage that the plan started falling apart. The Maverick, which was in drydock at the time, could not sail for another month. Even during this time, rumours abounded that it was to be used to smuggle arms into Southeast Asia. The ship was searched a number of times by customs and security agents, who only found the ship's empty hold. Immediately before it left, it received an additional crew of five Indian Ghadar activists carrying fake Persian passports. They carried with themselves large amounts of Ghadarite literature, and were tasked by Ram Chandra to establish contacts with Indian revolutionaries and arrange for the arms to be transported inland. However, awaiting the Maverick for nearly a month, the Annie Larsen ran out of fresh water and, without a condenser on board, was forced to head for the mainland of Mexico. Arriving at the rendezvous point, the Maverick was informed of the Annie Larsen's departure by a two-man crew left behind by Page. The Maverick waited for twenty-nine days for the Schooner's return. During this time, it was visited by HMS Kent. The Ghadar agents were forced to burn the revolutionary literature in the boiler room while the Kent crew searched the ship. A subsequent visit by an American warship also revealed nothing save the ship's empty hold. The Annie Larsen sailed to Acapulco to replenish its supplies. However, it faced trouble as three of the crew members refused to sail the ship, claiming it was not seaworthy. Captain Sheultzer was able to successfully appeal for help from the which was in the area. Its contraband cargo was not discovered by the Yorktown's boarding party. Allowed to use the Yorktown's wireless, the German crew were able to notify the German Consulate of their position and of the failed rendezvous. Sailing from Acapulco, the Annie Larsen made for Socorro Island again. However, in adverse weather, this attempt failed as well, and after twenty-two days Scheultzer gave up, choosing to make for the northern port of Hoquiam, Washington. Returning to San Diego after failing to meet the Annie Larsen, the Maverick was directed by Fred Jebsen to proceed to Hilo, Hawaii, where it was redirected to Johnston Island by the German consulate for a second effort to rendezvous with the Annie Larsen. However, this failed too and it was subsequently directed to Anjer, Java. At Anjer, a German operative named Theodore Helfrichs was instructed to dispose of the ship. However, it was seized by Dutch authorities. Starr-Hunt and four of the Ghadarites attempted to flee in a ship, but were captured by the British cruiser . Taken to Singapore, Starr-Hunt confessed his role in the plot. Resolving the plot In the United States, the conspiracy was successfully infiltrated by British intelligence through both the Irish, as well as Indian channels. The activities of Ghadar on the Pacific coast were noted by W. C Hopkinson, who had grown up in India and spoke fluent Hindi. In the meantime, through intelligence sources arising from British, Irish, European, and Mexican sources, the Justice Department had a clear picture of the conspiracy and the true purposes of the Maverick and the Annie Larsen. The Home department of the British Indian government had begun the task of actively tracking Indian seditionists on the East Coast as early as 1910. Francis Cunliffe Owen, the officer heading the Home Office agency in New York, had become thoroughly acquainted with George Freeman and Myron Phelps posing as members of the Clan-na-Gael. Owens' efforts were successful in thwarting the SS Moraitis plan. The Ghadar Party was incidentally established after Irish Republicans, sensing infiltration, encouraged an exclusively Indian society. Following this, a number of approaches were adopted, including instituting a \\"Native\\" Indian intelligence officer to infiltrate the movement, as well as the use of the famous American Pinkerton's detective agency. An Irish double agent by the name of Charles Lamb is said to have passed on the majority of the information that compromised the conspiracy and ultimately helped the construction of the prosecution. An Indian operative, codenamed \\"C\\" and described most likely to have been Chandra Kanta Chakraverty (later the chief prosecution witness in the trial), also passed on the details of the conspiracy to British and American intelligence. On 29 June 1915, the Annie Larsen was raided at Hoquiam and its contraband cargo seized. However, Page was able to escape and later made for Germany. The Annie Larsen cargo was sold at an auction despite the German Ambassador Count Johann von Bernstoff's attempts to take possession insisting they were meant for German East Africa. Additionally, some of the plans involving the Indian Berlin Committee leaked out through Czech revolutionaries and spy networks who were in touch with their counterparts in the United States. The American network of the Czech organisation, headed by E. V. Voska, was a counter-espionage network spying on German and Austrian diplomats. Voska, being pro-American, pro-British and anti-German, on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, spoke of it to Tom√°≈° Masaryk, who then passed the information to the American authorities. The Americans informed British intelligence. Trial The Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy Trial commenced in the District Court in San Francisco on November 12, 1917, following the uncovering of the Annie Larsen cargo. One hundred and five people, including the former Consul-General and vice consul, members of the Ghadar Party, and members of the German consulate in San Francisco were tried. The trial lasted from November 20, 1917, to April 24, 1918. The trial was also sensationally notable for the assassination of the chief conspirator Ram Chandra. Chandra was assassinated on the last day of the trial in a packed courtroom by one of his fellow accused, Ram Singh. Singh himself was also immediately shot dead by a United States Marshal. In May 1917, eight Indian nationalists of the Ghadar Party were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to form a military enterprise against Britain. The trial in later years has been criticised for being largely a show trial to appease the British government. In addition, the jury during the trial was carefully selected to exclude Irish persons with republican views or associations. The British authorities hoped that the conviction of the Indians would result in their deportation from the United States back to India. However, in the face of strong public support in favor of the Indians, officials of the U.S. Department of Justice chose not to do so. Impact on Anglo-American relations By 1916, the majority of the resources of the American department of the British Foreign office were related to the Indian seditionist movement. Before the outbreak of the war, Sir Cecil Spring Rice, the Ambassador to United States at the time of the war, is known to have urged the British Foreign office not to make this a diplomatic issue. Spring Rice's dispatches cite concerns with regards to American tolerance of the Anarchist movements in American soil, the American government's inactions despite concrete knowledge (in Spring Rice's opinion) of the conspiracies, as well as concerns regarding the image of Britain in American public opinion if Britain were seen to persecute oppressed people. Further, Spring Rice was particularly wary of the political commitments of American President Wilson's government, especially given that the Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan had eight years previously written the highly critical pamphlet British Rule in India. This pamphlet had been classified as seditionist by the Indian and Imperial governments. Following Bryan's departure, the British secretary of state, Robert Crewe-Milnes, attempted to persuade Spring Rice to raise the issue in front of the United States government. American authorities in the Philippines were also more cooperative at this time, and assured Britain they would have foreknowledge of any plans against Hong Kong. Following the conclusion of the Lahore Conspiracy Case trial, and as more evidence of German complicity came to light, Foreign Secretary Edward Grey was forced to override Spring Rice's hesitation; in February 1916, the British government officially presented its concerns regarding the conspiracy and German complicity to the American government. Although the new secretary of state Robert Lansing was initially as uncooperative as Bryan, the first investigations of the conspiracy opened with the raid of the Wall Street office of Wolf von Igel. The papers seized were later presented as evidence in the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy trial. Much to the chagrin of the British government, however, it was not pursued further at the time. The issue did precipitate a more general Anglo-American neutrality dispute. This was aggravated by belligerent preventive measures taken by the British far-eastern fleet that threatened the sovereignty of American vessels. In particular, HMS Laurentic seized German and Turkish passengers on the American vessel China at the mouth of the Yangtze, the British government accusing them of planning to foment an armed uprising in India. This incident provoked outrage from the American government, and was followed by a number of incidents including the SS Henry S incident. The US Atlantic Fleet dispatched destroyers to the Philippines. The relations were strained until May 1916, when the British government decided to relax its aggressive policy and seek cooperation with the US. The China prisoners were released that month, but relations did not improve before November that year, with a number of exchanges through the rest of 1916. The issue was ultimately addressed by William Wiseman, head of British intelligence in the US, who bypassed diplomatic channels to give details of a bomb plot directly to the New York police. This led to the arrest of Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty. As links became apparent, within the Chuckrevarty papers and the Igel papers, the investigations by federal authorities ultimately expanded to cover the entire conspiracy. The US agreed to pass on evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for Breaches of Neutrality. At a time that Diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the Foreign Office directed the Embassy to cooperate with the investigations. These ultimately resolved the Anglo-American diplomatic disputes just as America entered the war.

Description Epipactis palustris is a perennial herbaceous plant. This species has a stem growing to 60 cm high with as many as ten erect leaves up to 12 cm long and up to 4cm wide, with parallel venation. It persists as an underground horizontal stem called a rhizome, from which new roots and stems grow each year. The aerial part of the stem is upright and has a cylindrical section. The base of the aerial stem is glabrous (smooth) and surrounded with pink scales, the upper part of the stem is pubescent and slightly reddened. The flowers are 17 mm across arranged in a one-sided raceme. In the typical form, the sepals are coloured deep pink or purplish-red, the upper petals shorter and paler. The labellum at least as long as the sepals, white with red or yellow spots in the middle.Webb, D.A., Parnell, J. and Doogue, D. 1996. An Irish Flora Dundalgan Press Ltd, Dundalk.

Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment Epipactis palustris is typically found in humid woodland and grassland, as well as in marshes, dune slacks and bogs. It prefers a calcareous substrate with a basic pH, low nutrient availability and medium wet. Pollination and ecology Each flower contains male and female organs of reproduction. Flowers produce nectar and are pollinated by wasps, bees and Diptera. Orchids rely on a symbiotic relationship with soil fungi, which gives them access to more soil nutrients. Epipactis palustris is specialised compared to other Epipactis species, partnering mainly with fungal species in the order Helotiales, but also to a much lesser degree with Sebacina, Tulasnella, Thelephora and Ceratobasidium in descending order of frequencyAnnals of Botany - Differences in mycorrhizal communities between Epipactis palustris, E. helleborine and its presumed sister species E. neerlandica. Etymology Epipactis is a Greek word the meaning of which is disputed, but some have translated it as \\"grow above\\". The species epithet palustris is Latin for \\"of the marsh\\" and indicates its common habitat.Archibald William Smith \\"Helleborine\\" may refer to deer using the orchid for food (many conservationists have noted that helleborine orchids are grazed by deer.Plantlife - Epipactis youngianaWildflower Society Online ReportFinnish Orchids).

Conducted by a judge, jury, or government official, an inquest may or may not require an autopsy carried out by a coroner or medical examiner. Generally, inquests are conducted only when deaths are sudden or unexplained. An inquest may be called at the behest of a coroner, judge, prosecutor, or, in some jurisdictions, upon a formal request from the public. A coroner's jury may be convened to assist in this type of proceeding. Inquest can also mean such a jury and the result of such an investigation. In general usage, inquest is also used to mean any investigation or inquiry. An inquest uses witnesses, but suspects are not permitted to defend themselves. The verdict can be, for example, natural death, accidental death, misadventure, suicide, or murder. If the verdict is murder or culpable accident, criminal prosecution may follow, and suspects are able to defend themselves there. Since juries are not used in most European civil law systems, these do not have any (jury) procedure similar to an inquest, but medical evidence and professional witnesses have been used in court in continental Europe for centuries. Larger inquests can be held into disasters, or in some jurisdictions (not England and Wales) into cases of corruption.[Anon.] (2001) \\"Inquest\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Deluxe CDROM edition History The inquest, as a means of settling a matter of fact, developed in Scandinavia and the Carolingian Empire before the end of the tenth century. It was the method of gathering the survey data for the Domesday Book in England after the Norman conquest. In his account of the culture of the Gauls (Commentarii de Bello Gallico VI.19.3), Julius Caesar mentions a very early use of the procedure: \\"if a matter comes into suspicion about a death, they hold an inquiry (a quaestio) concerning the wives in the method used for slaves, and if guilt is established, they kill the wives, who have been tortured, with fire and all torments.\\" Inquests by region=United KingdomEngland and Wales= In England and Wales, all inquests were once conducted with a jury. They acted somewhat like a grand jury, determining whether a person should be committed to trial in connection to a death. Such a jury was made up of up to twenty-three men, and required the votes of twelve to render a decision. Similar to a grand jury, a coroner's jury merely accused, it did not convict. Since 1927, coroner's juries have rarely been used in England. Under the Coroners Act 1988, a jury is only required to be convened in cases where the death occurred in prison, police custody, or in circumstances which may affect public health or safety. The coroner can actually choose to convene a jury in any investigation, but in practice this is rare. The qualifications to sit on a coroner's jury are the same as those to sit on a jury in the Crown Court, the High Court, and the County Court. Additionally, a coroner's jury only determines the cause of death, its ruling does not commit a person to trial. While grand juries, which did have the power to indict, were abolished in the United Kingdom by 1948 (after being effectively stopped in 1933), coroner's juries retained those powers until the Criminal Law Act 1977. This change came about after Lord Lucan was charged in 1975 by a coroner's jury in the death of Sandra Rivett, his children's nanny. The charity Inquest looks at inquests concerning contentious deaths including those in places of detention, and has campaigned for reforms to the inquest and coroner's system in England and Wales. =Scotland= There are no inquests or coroners in Scotland, where sudden unnatural deaths are reported to, and investigated on behalf of, the procurator fiscal for an area. The procurator fiscal has a duty to investigate all sudden, suspicious, accidental, unexpected and unexplained deaths and any death occurring in circumstances that give rise to serious public concern. Where a death is reported, the procurator fiscal will investigate the circumstances of the death, attempt to find out the cause of the death and consider whether criminal proceedings or a fatal accident inquiry is appropriate. In the majority of cases reported to the procurator fiscal, early enquiries rule out suspicious circumstances and establish that the death was due to natural causes. Deaths are usually brought to the attention of the procurator fiscal through reports from the police, the registrar, GPs or hospital doctors. However, anyone who has concerns about the circumstances of a death can report it to the procurator fiscal. There are certain categories of deaths that must be enquired into, but the procurator fiscal may enquire into any death brought to his notice. United States In the United States, inquests are generally conducted by coroners, who are generally officials of a county or city.18 C.J.S. Coroners and Medical Examiners ¬ß¬ß 1, 9.

Fenwick Island State Park is open for year-round recreation from 8:00 am until sunset. Originally part of Delaware Seashore State Park, it was established in 1966 and renamed in 1981. The park is located on Fenwick Island, a narrow strip of land between the Atlantic Ocean and Little Assawoman Bay. It is largely undeveloped in comparison to the beach communities that surround it. History Fenwick Island is named for Thomas Fenwick a planter to migrated to the Thirteen Colonies from York, England. He was granted rights to the land by Lord Baltimore, the second Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland, in 1682. Fenwick never actually lived on Fenwick Island, but he did rise to a position of importance in Sussex County government. He served as a Justice of the Peace, Sheriff and register of wills until his death in 1708. Some legends contend that Fenwick swam ashore at Fenwick Island after being thrown overboard by pirates. Most historians do not believe that this happened. It is, however, likely that Fenwick's future son-in-law did swim ashore. William Fassett swam ashore after being cast off by a group of pirates. He would go on to marry Fenwick's daughter, Mary and claim the land of Fenwick Island for himself. Colonial ownership of Fenwick Island was disputed between the family of William Penn, governor of the Province of Pennsylvania and Delaware Colony and the family of Cecil Calvert governor of the Province of Maryland. The dispute was settled in the 1750s when the Trans- Peninsular Line was drawn. This line which forms the southern boundary of Delaware begins on Fenwick Island at the Fenwick Island Lighthouse. While the governors of Delaware and Maryland were arguing over the correct boundaries, pirates used the harbors of Little Assawoman Bay to the west of Fenwick Island State Park as a safe haven. For 100 years the pirates raided the ships of local and passing sea capitans, using Cedar Island in the bay as their base of operations. Fenwick Island has remained largely undeveloped because it is a narrow peninsula that is just wide. The constantly shifting dunes have made commercial and residential development difficult. The town of Fenwick Island is located just above the Delaware/Maryland border. Despite several descriptions of Fenwick Island as a barrier island, it is clear from maps that it is not a true island. The border between Maryland and Delaware below Fenwick Island is a land boundary. Ocean City, Maryland occupies the southern tip of the peninsula on which Fenwick Island is situated. Ownership of the land was designated to the state of Delaware in 1926. It was used as part of the coastal defense system during the World War II years. An observation tower from this era still stands at the northern end of the park. Management of the property was transferred from the Delaware Highway Department to the State Park Commission in 1966. Fenwick Island State Park was originally the southern portion of Delaware Seashore State Park. The parks were divided in 1981. Fenwick Island State Park is managed in conjunction with Holts Landing State Park on Indian River Bay to the north. Recreation Beach at Fenwick Island State Park Fenwick Island State Park borders the Atlantic Ocean and Little Assawoman Bay. This allows visitors to the park to experience two different coastlines on one patch of land. The beach at the ocean is open to swimming, surfing and surf fishing. It is monitored by lifeguards from 9:00 am until 5:00 pm, Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend. A modern bathhouse is equipped with showers, changing rooms, a gift shop and food concession. Visitors to the park, interested in surf fishing, are permitted to drive vehicles onto the beach provided they purchase a permit at the gift shop or from the offices at Delaware Seashore State Park. The bay side of the park is open to fishing, recreational crabbing, clamming, sailing and windsurfing and kayaking. Visitors to the park may rent various types of watercraft and receive sailing lessons from an outfitter across bay at the Assawoman Wildlife Area.

In April 2017, Vapiano had 180 locations in 31 countries, including Australia, China, Egypt and the United States. On 20 March 2020, Vapiano announced its cash-flow insolvency due to a sharp drop in sales after most restaurants had to close due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  History  Restaurant in Leopoldstadt, Vienna (2009) In 2002, Mark Korzilius opened the first restaurant under the Vapiano brand name in Hamburg's Neustadt district. One month later, the company was registered as a joint-stock company according to German law under the company name of Mark's AG in the Commercial Register. In addition to Mark Korzilius, who served as the company's sole Management Board member, other investors were involved. The Italian architect and designer Matteo Thun contributed to the design. Among other elements, he came up with the interior design of the restaurant. At the end of 2003, the founder Mark Korzilius stepped down from his position as company Chairman, and the company was also renamed Vapiano AG. Based on the model of the original Hamburg location, the company opened additional restaurants, e.g. in 2004 in D√ºsseldorf as well as 2005 in Frankfurt, Nuremberg and Munich. New restaurants were also established in Hamburg. At the end of 2005, Vapiano moved its headquarters from Hamburg to Bonn. This was in connection with the opening of a restaurant in the Erich-Ollenhauer-Haus. In 2005, the company crossed the EUR 10 million threshold in revenue for the first time. From 2006, the company increasingly expanded abroad, e.g. to Belgium, Austria and Turkey. There was remarkable media reception marking the opening of the first restaurant in Vienna. Activities were also launched in Dubai and the United States. At the same time, Vapiano increasingly began cooperation with franchise partners in Europe. After continuous growth in the years 2006 and 2007, the number of restaurants in 2008 exceeded 30 and by the end of 2009 had already reached roughly 60. In 2011 in Vienna, Vapiano opened its 100th restaurant. Since September 2008, the company has been operating as Vapiano SE. In 2011, the private equity firm, Verm√∂gensverwaltung Mayfair, acquired 40 percent of the shares in Vapiano from Gregor Gerlach. Gerlach had invested in the company already in the start-up phase, acquired the shares of other shareholders and served as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. The equity position assumed by Mayfair, which according to Capital had even sought a majority, was intended above all to facilitate international growth.Kapalschinski, Christoph (2011-06-15). \\"Tchibo-Erben investieren in Pasta\\". The Sander Family, heirs of Wella, had acquired shares in Vapiano in the meantime. The change in the shareholder structure led to the resignation of the longstanding Chairman Marko Silz, due to \\"differing views\\" concerning the future strategy. His successor was Gregor Gerlach, who continued to promote international expansion. After ten years in operation, the company had 118 restaurants and 7,200 employees worldwide, including 50 restaurants and 3,100 employees in Germany. In the 2010s, the company's success led to me-too competitors. In 2014, Vapiano altered its strategy and in smaller cities built new corporate- owned restaurants not run as franchise operations. The growth of the company slowed down, along with basic criticism of the company's expansion strategy in 2015. In mid-2015, Gregor Gerlach announced that he was moving from Chairman onto the Supervisory Board, in order to devote more efforts to other ventures. In addition to the Management Board, the Supervisory Board of Vapiano was also newly appointed. In 2017, Vapiano went public and at that time \\"had a market value of about 553 million euros, or more than $630 million.\\" In early 2019 the company was in financial trouble. Losses piled up after sales targets were missed, the share price had slumped by 75% since entering the stock market in 2017, and the company had expanded too quickly. As a result, the company decided to reduce the expansion tempo, have more locations operated by franchisees, alter the concept in order to reduce waiting times for customers and close unprofitable locations. In 2018 the company reported financial losses of ‚Ç¨101 million. On 20 March 2020 the company filed for insolvency. The main reason was that losses had increased after almost all restaurants had to close temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company officially entered insolvency proceedings on 2 April 2020 in Cologne.  Group structure  Pasta dish in Vapiano, Berlin. Vapiano SE is the parent company of the group. Since the financial year of 2014, the group has prepared consolidated annual financial statements and reported earnings according to the International Financial Reporting Standards. The consolidated companies in 2014 included some three dozen subsidiaries, associated firms and joint ventures based in Germany and abroad, in which Vapiano SE owns at least 50 percent of the shares. This included, for example, Vapiano Ltd., based in London, and Vapiano USA, LLC based in McLean, Virginia. The purpose of the companies includes doing business throughout the country or the operation of individual restaurants. The equity ratio of the group was around 34 percent in the financial year of 2014. Vapiano SE is structured along the lines of a traditional separation of the company's Management Board and Supervisory Board. The Management Board most recently consisted of Chairman Jochen Halfmann and CFO Lutz Scharpe. The Supervisory Board, chaired by Thomas Tochtermann, most recently consisted of three representatives of shareholders.  Restaurants  The Vapiano in F√ºrth is the first free- standing Vapiano (2015) In 2002, the Die Welt (German daily newspaper) described the first Vapiano restaurant as a \\"cross between a pasta restaurant, pizzeria, lounge and bar in an Italian style\\". Self-service is an essential element of the Vapiano concept, but the company eschews the term \\"fast-food restaurant\\". The name Vapiano is derived from the Italian words va (\\"go\\") and piano (\\"slowly\\"). The slogan of the company is Chi va piano, va sano e va lontano (\\"Those who have an easy-going and relaxed approach to life, live more healthily and longer.‚Äú). Except for bread and rolls, all the ingredients are prepared on site in the restaurants. This applies particularly to pasta and sauces for pasta and pizza. In its restaurants, Vapiano offers various types of pasta, prepared fresh daily. The chain's restaurants are normally found in central locations or in districts with many offices. Starting in 2014, the first free-standing building for Vapiano was built in F√ºrth. Restaurants normally have between 25 and 60 employees and range in size up to 1,000 square meters. The company's largest restaurant worldwide, having a floor space of 1,500 square meters, has been operated by Vapiano in Vienna since 2013 in The Mall shopping center in Wien Mitte railway station. With a total of seven locations, there are more restaurants of this chain in Austria's capital than in any other city. The distinguishing features of all the franchise restaurants are a long service counter, exposed-concrete floors, large wooden tables, basket lamps and Italian tile decor, along with a green wall consisting of real plants in the newest Vapianos. In addition, there is always an olive tree and an herb garden with basil and rosemary. Upon entering a restaurant, guests receive a chip card that keeps track of all the meals and drinks ordered. Antipasti, pasta and pizza have always been divided up into various price categories. All the meals are made to order before the eyes of the guests (Front Cooking). Once the meals are prepared, the guest can bring them to any of the free-seating tables. For pizza, guests receive a portable disc that blinks and vibrates as soon as the order is ready to be picked up at the counter. Guests pay for meals and drinks when leaving the restaurant, after handing in their chip card.  Locations  One Vapiano restaurant in Marylebone in the City of Westminster in London. In October 2016, there were four Vapiano restaurants in the United Kingdom: Three restaurants were located in London, one restaurant in Manchester. According to the consolidated financial statements for the financial year of 2014, there were 152 restaurants worldwide under the Vapiano brand. According to the company, there were 62 in Germany, eleven in Austria, nine in the United States, eight in Sweden, six in France, six in Switzerland, seven in Australia, five in the Netherlands, four in Hungary, six in England, seven in Mexico, three in the Czech Republic , three in Poland, three in the United Arab Emirates, two in Brazil, two in Denmark, three in Estonia, two in Finland, two in Chile, two in Luxembourg, two in Saudi Arabia, two in Spain, two in Serbia, two in Taiwan, two in Qatar and two in Ukraine. Vapiano had a presence of one restaurant each in Scotland, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Egypt, Kuwait, Lithuania, Norway, Colombia and South Korea.  Criticism  Vapiano in Bochum (2015) In February 2013, the Food, Beverages and Catering Union (Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gastst√§tten) filed criminal charges with the District Attorney's Office of Bochum, because Vapiano was alleged to have severely obstructed the election of a work council for a Bochum restaurant. Working hours of work council chair members were said to have been reduced, and in addition, they were alleged to have been excluded from further training measures and relieved of responsibilities. Two work council chair members were even said to have been dismissed because the company claimed they had exerted pressure on the workforce. Vapiano issued a statement in this regard that the company had \\"absolutely nothing against work councils\\". A short time later, the Allgemeine Hotel- und Gastronomie-Zeitung, the weekly newspaper for the hotel and restaurant business in Germany, reported that the union and the company had approached one another and resumed discussions concerning the election of a work council. In June 2015, the company was subject to allegations that it had manipulated the records concerning the working hours of its employees, in order to push down wage costs. The German weekly newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported on former restaurant managers who claimed they had been instructed by their superiors to retroactively modify the time sheets of their employees and trainees. This was alleged to be standard practice in several Vapiano's corporate-run restaurants. According to estimates, the losses for employees were said to reach up to EUR 50,000 per year for each restaurant. Vapiano's Management Board was reportedly shocked by the allegations and spoke of \\"criminal energy\\". PricewaterhouseCoopers was hired to investigate the incidents, and the company also announced the introduction of a new system for time accounting. Also in 2015, \\"Die Welt\\" documented allegations by former employees, according to which best-by dates had been manipulated. \\"Partly strange-smelling\\" and \\"no longer appetizing\\" meals were said to have been served, also including pasta with a \\"green shimmer\\". In order to mask the disgusting odor of some products, employees are said to have been instructed to simply cook the food longer. Vapiano issued an apology for possible mistakes. The company said that, if the allegations were true, it was due to the \\"misconduct of individual employees\\". The company said it wanted to look into the allegations and cited its strict quality standards, including inspections by SGS Institut Fresenius and T√úV Rheinland. The Bundesverband der Systemgastronomie, the German federal association for that type of industry, publicly defended Vapiano.

It has also been treated as a separate species, Epipactis youngiana.  Taxonomy  Epipactis helleborine var. youngiana was discovered in 1975 by Tony Porter, and described as a new species by Porter and A. J. Richards in 1982. The specific epithet commemorates Donald Peter Young, who worked extensively on Epipactis. It is part of the Epipactis helleborine species complex, and cannot be distinguished from the wide-ranging and variable species E. helleborine using genetic markers. It is therefore treated as a variety of the widespread species, as E. helleborine var. youngiana. Epipactis helleborine var. youngiana was thought to be a hybrid between two other orchid taxa, probably E. dunensis and E. helleborine. More recently it is treated simply as a variety of E. helleborine.  Description  Epipactis helleborine var. youngiana is a perennial herb that typically grows high. It differs from typical E. helleborine in having its basal leaf more than 1.2√ó as long as broad rather than 1.1√ó as long as broad, in the basal leaf being \\"flat, flaccid, unribbed, silky to [the] touch, margins undulate\\" (\\"cucullate, stiff, ribbed, coarse to [the] touch, margins not undulate\\" in E. helleborine), in its flowers ‚Äì when coloured ‚Äì being clear pink rather than dirty pink, in the rostellum being nearly as long as the anthers (less than half as long as the anthers in E. helleborine) and in having a shiny ovary with a few stiff hairs, rather than matt with soft hairs or hairless, as in E. helleborine.  Distribution  Epipactis helleborine var. youngiana was first discovered in southern Northumberland, close to Newcastle-upon-Tyne and along the valley of the River South Tyne; all the sites were associated with metal mining. Populations of similar orchids on bings (coal-mining spoil heaps) in the Central Belt of Scotland have also been assigned to the same taxon. Similar plants also occur on the sand dunes at Kenfig Burrows in South Wales, which have been polluted by the nearby Margam steelworks.  Conservation  Epipactis helleborine var. youngiana is considered an endangered species in the United Kingdom, and is protected under Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

It comprises two large marshes, Mono≈°torski Rit and Apatinski Rit and vast forests, meadows, ponds, swamps and the Danube's meanders, including of the Danube course (1366 ‚Äì 1433 km). It is projected as a part of the future trans-boundary biosphere reserve \\"Mura-Drava-Danube\\", a five country project, dubbed the \\"Amazon of Europe\\". The name means \\"Upper Danube Valley\\". Parts of the nature reserve are subject to the Croatia‚ÄìSerbia border dispute; Croatia claims some areas under Serbian control on the eastern side of the river.  Protection = Background  In the past 200 years, the amelioration of the area, especially the draining of the marshes, reduced once vastly spread wetland ecosystems in the Pannonian Basin to several patches along the major rivers. During that period, the rivers in the Baƒçka region were turned into the canals. Obsolete ideas of turning the natural streams into canals without gravel or sand in their beds was done allegedly for better sailing and floods prevention. However, in time dozens of plant and animal species disappeared and even the human population was affected by this process: fish catch diminished and underground waters, used for drinking, were not being purified through the soil anymore.  Establishment  The first designation as a protected area dates back to 1955, when an area of was proposed as an important habitat for the white-tailed eagle and the black stork. Since then, the area included and the level of protection has been gradually increased. Gornje Podunavlje was designated as a Special Nature Reserve in 2001, with a total size of .  Level of protection  Within the reserve, there is a three-level zonation system established: protection regimes of category I (1.3%), II (24.7%) and III (74.0%). There is a huge biodiversity of Gornje Podunavlje Reserve. More than 150 bird species occur regularly in the reserve, amongst which a lot of threatened ones. It is an area of important aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation, wet meadows and native lowland forests composed of willow, poplar, ash and oak trees. The area is rich in fish species, as one of the most important spawning areas along the Danube. A project \\"Partnership for the living Danube\\" was established in 2007. Within the scopes of the project, of Gornje Podunavlje's wetlands were revitalized. A new method of removing the wooden and shrub vegetation, which suffocated the life in and around the ponds of Sarkanj and Semenjaƒça, was implemented. A mosaic of natural habitats (wet meadows-saline marshes-water \\"mirrors\\") was restored. Floating plant colonies were also restored and regenerated: yellow iris, common duckweed, reed, European white water lily, yellow water-lily, common cattail and sedge. They soon became the nesting place for many wading birds. Some birds, absent from the area for over a century, returned. In 2017 works on revitalization of the marsh ≈†iroki Rit began, on an area of while the ≈†trbac locality is scheduled to be next. Gornje Podunavlje is also declared an Important Bird Area, Important Plant Area, Prime Butterfly Area, part of the Emerald network and a Ramsar wetland.  Trans-boundary Biosphere Reserve  Gornje Podunavlje is part of the vast Central Danube Floodplains, the large trans-boundary floodplain in the middle Danube, along the route of the southern European Green Belt. It is one of the best preserved wetlands in the Danube River Basin area. In 2009, the preliminary bilateral agreement between Croatia and Hungary was reached on creating a joint natural reserve in the Drava-Danube region. In March 2011, corresponding ecology ministries from five countries (Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia) agreed on creating a Trans-boundary Biosphere Reserve of Mura-Drava-Danube which would consist of more than of the core zone (already protected areas), of buffer zones and of transitional zones. It should include the already protected areas: Kopaƒçki rit, Veliki Pa≈æut, Mura-Drava (in Croatia), Danube-Drava National Park (in Hungary), Gornje Podunavlje, Karaƒëorƒëevo, Tikvara (in Serbia) and several Natura 2000 protected areas in Austria, Slovenia and Hungary. With in total, it would be among the largest protected terrestrial areas in Europe, hence it was named the \\"Amazon of Europe - Mura-Drava-Danube\\". In June 2016 UNESCO officially designated the reserve and in September 2016 five ministers opened the reserve and agreed on future cooperation and joint management. That management will include the administration of the river ecosystems in sustainable way, renewal and protection of the natural wetlands and biodiversity, taking care of the drinking water, spurring of the economic development: organic production, tourism and protection of the diverse cultural heritage in each of the countries. UNESCO Biosphere Reserve The reserve was officially designated UNESCO Biosphere Reserve on 14 June 2017 under the title \\"Baƒçko Podunavlje\\". Podunavlje is the second UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in Serbia after Golija-Studenica, designated in 2001.  Wildlife  Eurasian spoonbill As one of the last integral floodplains of the Danube, it contains some of the most valuable wetland habitats and therefore is a sanctuary for many species, which with their lifecycles, is inherently connected to the river.  Plant life  Natural poplar, oak and willow forests and occasionally flooded wet meadows or numerous oxbow lakes and swamps, which were once widespread in the Danube wetlands, are today rare and fragmented habitats. Trees growing in Gornje Podunavlje also include ash while the reserve is also inhabited by the plants like violet limodore, yellow iris, European white water lily, sweet flag, yellow water-lily winter aconite, sedge, common duckweed, water violet, reed, common cattail and common mare's-tail. Number of plant species in the reserve, over 1,000, makes one third of all plant species in Serbia.  Animal life  The reserve is home to 20 species of amphibians and reptiles and a numerous invertebrates, including over 60 species of butterflies. Gornje Podunavlje is a habitat of numerous fish species which find ideal spawning conditions in the oxbows and shallow shoals of the emanated river, including the critically endangered species of bastard sturgeon. The area is home to some important species such as white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) or black stork (Ciconia nigra), but also to ferruginous duck and Eurasian spoonbill. A total of 248 species of birds live in the reserve, or 71% of all bird species in Serbia (349). Also, it is populated by the rare and endangered mammals like European otter (Lutra lutra) and wild cat (Felis silvestris). Other mammals include European badger and red deer. Half of the species of fish (50 out of 98) and mammals (50 out of 95 or 101, depending on the source) registered in Serbia, can be found in the reserve. Although suffers a certain pressure from numerous human activities, this area still remains an unspoiled natural environment for the many species which inhabit it.

The company had offices at Pinewood Studios and produced content for the TV channel as well as programmes for international TV, the Internet and mobile distribution. Before its sale in 2010, the channel averaged around a million viewers a week. History Film24 was an independent multi-platform content business, based at Pinewood Film Studios, that produced programmes and short features about the film industry and films themselves to satisfy the ever- growing consumer demand for film consumption and the audience's fascination with the movie business. Content was available primarily on Sky. The Channel was founded by one of the UK‚Äôs top headhunters - the late Nicky J Davis. Film24, the TV channel, launched in July 2007 as a channel about film, not airing films, but with original programming covering large and small films and DVD releases, new talent, regional cinema, films in production and behind-the- scenes programmes reporting and explaining every aspect of the film industry. In the latter half of 2009, the COO, Andrew Burns, brought in a new programming strategy, focusing on acquiring programmes. This new direction saw an increase in celebrity programming, demonstrating the Hollywood lifestyle and reality television shows. Film24 also showed comedy, factual documentaries, sports, as well as awards shows, with the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Independent Spirit Awards airing in 2010. The Screen Actors Guild Awards were transmitted live in the UK. Viewing figures increased to a million a week In September 2009, Film24 commissioned Starstruck Media to relaunch flagship programme Film Xtra. Originally, thirteen 15 minute programmes were agreed, but the programme was soon made into a half-hour feature, and continued to look at new cinema releases, home entertainment releases, and news from the world of film. The programme was presented by former CBBC and Top of the Pops presenter, Adrian Dickson. A spin-off series, that was broadcast post the 9 p.m. watershed - FXU, started in January 2010, presented by Tim Fornara. Also in September, Film24 acquired the rights to computer games shows Playr and Playr Guides. In December 2009, Film24 announced plans to significantly increase its spend on new programmes. In early 2010, the channel showed a number of Southern Television programmes such as Freewheelers, The Flockton Flyer and the TV version of Dick Barton, some of which later turned up on Talking Pictures TV who own the rights to the Southern TV library as well as a significant number of films that were also shown on the channel. It also completed a number of output deals with a number of major Film studios and distributors Film24 Sale The channel's principal shareholder was Lord Paul's Caparo Group. In May 2010, Angad Paul (CEO of Caparo Group) withdrew promised development funding, without any notice, following serious financial problems at Caparo, forcing the channel into financial difficulties. On 22 June 2010, Canis Media, who were contracted to schedule the channel announced that it had been asked to review options for the potential sale of the Film24 EPG by Film24‚Äôs board On 7 September 2010, Canis Media announced that the sale of the Film24 EPG was \\"near to completion\\" and the new owner would be unveiled shortly. On 28 October 2010, it was reported that Sony Pictures Television were on the brink of a deal to buy Film24 as their first entry into the UK channel market. On 19 November 2010, Sony Pictures Television acquired the EPG slot for Film24 for an undisclosed sum. On 8 November 2015, Angad Paul (CEO of Caparo Group) committed suicide by jumping from his 8th floor London penthouse two weeks after his family's steel company Caparo Group was forced into Administration.

His mother, a pianist, recognized his musical talent when he was four. At the age of seven, d'Antalffy's piano instruction was taken over by Ferenc Ripka. When he turned ten, Herr √ñd√∂n supervised his musical progress.Curriculum vitae of Dezso d'Antalffy As a secondary-school student he practiced eight hours a day, which gave him a firm basis for his technique. Academy of Music=Study At the IV/74 Durlach organ at the Budapest Academy of Music in 1907 D'Antallfy moved to Budapest in 1902, where he attended the faculty of law at the Hungarian Royal University according to his father's wishes, and studied the organ and composed music at the Academy of Music. For four years he was the student of Hans Koessler, who taught many Hungarian composers including Kod√°ly, Bart√≥k and Weiner. D'Antallfy graduated in 1906. He studied composition at the Academy of Music in Berlin, a musical centre at the time, and had classes with Hungarian violinist and composer Joseph Joachim. D'Antallfy was a conductor at the Cologne Opera House in 1907 and 1908. In 1909, he continued his studies in Leipzig and Bologna. Teaching A decade in Budapest began with his return in 1909, when d‚ÄôAntalffy composed most of his organ pieces. When his teacher retired in 1909, he became an organ teacher at the Academy of Music and received tenure in 1912. In 1919, d‚ÄôAntalffy began teaching composition. His first solo concert in January 1911 was a success, and he received a wreath from his fellow musicians. The concert featured a wide range of music, from the early Baroque (Frescobaldi) to contemporary music (including his own pieces. He married Dalma Arkay in March 1911 and fathered his only daughter, Judith d'Antalffy, in 1912. Until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, d‚ÄôAntalffy continued composing. He began performing abroad, and his expertise in organ-building was recognized. He was recruited when war broke out, and remained in Gro√üwardein (or Nagyv√°rad) for two years. In 1916 d‚ÄôAntalffy began working again, giving charity performances in Budapest, Transylvania and elsewhere in the country. At the height of his career in 1917, he was the chief organist at St. Stephan's Basilica in Budapest (playing the largest organ in the country, built by J√≥zsef AngsterHe served as chief organist and choirmaster of the St. Stephen's Cathedral, playing their IV/64 Angster organ (1905). in 1905. Study abroad Page from d'Antalffy's 1911 Organ Tutor In Leipzig, he studied composition with organist Max Reger. His organ teacher was Karl Straube, virtuoso organist of St. Thomas Church. Leipzig was an organ hotbed at the time, and its effects can be heard in d'Antalffy's works. Reger's combination of the tradition of Bach with Liszt and Brahms was part of his mindset when he seasoned traditional themes and melodies with impressionist, Debussy-like harmonies. Enrico Bossi, his teacher of interpretation and methodology in Bologna, had a similar influence since Bossi's works centred around the organ. Although Reger used liturgical genres such as the chorale and fugue, Bossi primarily composed concert pieces and D'Antalffy did the latter as well. Bossi's impact on d'Antalffy as a teacher became tangible in 1911, when he wrote his two-volume Organ Tutor (a detailed, versatile course book in Hungarian, focusing on the pupil's technical development with a variety of exercises).

Invited by entrepreneur Samuel Roxy Rothafel,S. L. \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel hired d'Antalffy in 1927 as one of three organists (with Lew White and Casimir A. J. Parmentier) for the opening of the Roxy Theatre in New York. The Roxy had a V/34 Kimball with two other consoles, Op. 6889, and in the lobby, a III/14 Kimball, Op. 6888 (1927). d'Antalffy became the organist of the two-year-old Capitol Theatre,He also worked as organist at the Capitol Theatre, New York City, playing a IV/45 Estey, Op. 1710 (1919) (where he played a concert the following April establishing him as the \\"Dohn√°nyi of the organ\\" in the press). The 4,000-seat Capitol Theatre, was a forerunner of the later cinema palaces. In September 1922, d'Antalffy became an organ teacherd'Antalffy was invited by Georg Eastman to teach organ specifically \\"motion picture accompaniment\\" at the Eastman Music School in Rochester; he taught during 1922 and 1923. John Hammond (who recorded under the name of John Hassell) was hired during the same time for the same purpose. They both performed in nightly programs providing organ accompaniment at the Eastman Theatre playing the IV/135 Austin, Op.1010 (1923). at the Eastman School of MusicAlmanac of The Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester and, with John Hammond, an organist at the 3,000-seat Eastman Theatre. In February 1924, d'Antalffy was asked to be the musical director of a series of performances. American producer Morris Gest brought The Miracle, a 1911 play by Kurt Vollm√∂ller and directed by Max Reinhard in Germany, to the U.S. D'Antalffy was the organist, the choirmaster and the conductor of the three-act play. He met his daughter and returned to Budapest, where he accepted a teaching position at the Academy of Music after a three-and-a-half-year absence. Budapest and the U.S. Samuel Roxy Rothafel with his organ staff in front of the Kimball console at the March 11, 1927 opening of the Roxy Theatre in New York (left to right: C. A. J. Parmentier, Dezso d'Antalffy, Lew White, \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel, Emil Velazco and Franck White) Circumstances in Budapest were difficult. The organ of the Academy of Music was under reconstruction and temporarily unusable, making teaching and concerts impossible. D'Antalffy gave concerts in other towns, toured the United States in December 1924 to perform The Miracle and accepted lesser positions as a conductor and organist. In 1925, d'Antalffy returned to teaching and giving concerts at the Academy for a year. For the third time, he then joined The Miracle company for a series of 32 performances in Los Angeles in January and February 1927. Producer Morris Gest asked d'Antalffy to compose music for Hofmannstahl's play, Everyman. His stay in the U.S. was lengthened by an invitation to teach from Union Theological Seminary in New York, and shortly afterwards his Academy of Music contract expired. D'Antalffy taught freshmen composition, counterpoint, music-reading, transposition and orchestration from 1927 to 1929 at the seminary's new sacred-music school, which existed until 1973. D'Antalffy at the Roxy Theatre organ in New York The Miracle company offered him work again at the beginning of 1929; Morris Gest was looking for a composer and conductor for a new production, The Freiburg Passion Play, directed by David Belasco (Gest's father-in-law, who had staged John Luther Long's short story \\"Madame Butterfly\\"). The play's 1900 London production influenced Giacomo Puccini, who did not understand English, to compose an operatic version. From April to June 1929 The Freiburg Passion Play was presented in the largest theatre of the time, the 5,300-seat Hippodrome Theatre in New York. In 1927, impresario Samuel Roxy Rothafel invited d'Antalffy to join the staff of organists at his new Roxy Theatre in New York City; at the time, the Roxy was the country's most prestigious movie palace. After the onset of the Great Depression, d'Antalffy toured in Europe during the spring of 1930. He became involved in the film industry, recording the soundtrack music for the Gaumont Film Company's The Miracle of the Wolves. D'Antalffy returned to Hungary, giving concerts in and outside Budapest, and was one of the first to play the newly built Angster organ in Szeged's Votive Church. It was the second-largest organ in Europe at the time, with five manuals and 136 stops. At the end of 1931, d'Antalffy returned to the U.S. and Rothafel commissioned him to compose an oratorio for the December 27, 1932 opening of Radio City Music Hall. Radio City was part of Rockefeller Center, at the time the world's largest privately owned enterprise which included fourteen Art Deco skyscraper office buildings, and was designed as the world's largest, most-luxurious theatre. The lyrics and orchestration of his oratorio, The Voice of Millions,\\"Voices of Millions premiered in Radio City Music Hall with a 100-piece orchestra and a choir of 300 voices presenting it over a world-wide radio hook-up.

The first worldwide broadcast by Radio City was a success, and d'Antalffy worked for the theatre as a staff composer and organistIn 1932, d'Antalffy became staff composer and organist for the Radio City Music Hall playing the IV/58 Wurlitzer, Op.2179 (1932). From 1932 to 1939, he was full time and from 1939 to 1942, part time. for ten years. Native American opera and later life At the peak of his career (contemporaneous with Kod√°ly, Bart√≥k and Stravinsky, d‚ÄôAntalffy composed a Native American opera. Onteora's Bride, a version of an Indian story, was presented at Radio City Music Hall in 1934. In its two-week run, it was played four or five times a day for a total of 58 performances. The Indian Association of America made d‚ÄôAntalffy an honorary chieftain.Cleveland- \\"Szabads√°g\\", New Yorki lev√©l 1935. m√°rcius 1 In 1936 he orchestrated Bach's Concerto for Two Violins for the New York Philharmonic, and the orchestra (directed by John Barbirolli) made d‚ÄôAntalffy an honorary member in 1938. The piece, his final success as a composer, was performed in 1940. Hospitalized with heart failure in 1942, d'Antalffy was unable to follow his wife back to Budapest. Although he considered returning to Hungary, he was prevented from doing so by health and financial problems. D‚ÄôAntalffy died in a Denville, New Jersey nursing home on April 29, 1945, at age 59.

A very early Episcopal church had been constructed within Muchalls Castle itself in the first quarter of the 17th century. Earlier ruined Episcopal churches also exist slightly to the east on historical lands of Muchalls Castle. Cookney Church is situated somewhat west on a high hill and within view of the ancient trackway of the Causey Mounth; moreover, the Causey Mounth trackway was constructed in medieval times to make passable this only available route across the coastal region of the Grampian Mounth from points south from Stonehaven to Aberdeen. This ancient drovers' road specifically connected the River Dee crossing (where the present Bridge of Dee is situated) via Muchalls Castle and Stonehaven to the south.C. Michael Hogan, Causey Mounth, Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham, Nov. 3, 2007 The route was that taken by William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal and the Marquess of Montrose when they led a Covenanter army of 9000 men in the first battle of the Civil War in 1639.Watt, Archibald, Highways and Byways around Kincardineshire, Stonehaven Heritage Society (1985) See also *Netherley *Red Moss ReferencesExternal links * Banchory-Devenick and Maryculter/Cookney Church of Scotland, Aberdeenshire Category:Churches in Aberdeenshire Category:Category C listed buildings in Aberdeenshire Category:Listed churches in Scotland ","title":"Cookney Church"},{"id":"13363452","text":"Pawe≈Ç Kaczmarek (born 1 July 1985) is a Polish footballer who plays as a midfielder.

She lives in Los Angeles, California.  Early life and education  Mandani was born in Tehran, Iran in 1981. From the age of seven, she studied calligraphy and painting. In 1994 she moved to Oregon. Madani graduated from Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon in 2004 with a BA degree in political science and visual arts. She did an internship in Berlin in 2003 with the German Council fo Foreign Affairs and worked with an expert on Iranian affairs. In 2006, she graduated from Yale University School of Art in New Haven, Connecticut with an MFA degree in painting.  Work  Madani is known for her use of cartoonish and exaggerated sexual imageries in her paintings. Her work often focuses on the relationship between the adult and child. Many of her works contain images of men in traditionally childlike positions, playing with they anuses, bodily fluids, and penises. The paintings are satirical, funny, and very loose in their execution. Madani works to capture the moment an idea emerges in sketchbooks and she translates this by using decisive brushwork and strong lines in her paintings, and is a visual example of real world impulses that get repressed. In 2008 Madani began incorporating animation into her work, as an attempt to bring the painting to action. In 2013 she was part of the lawsuit, Independence Collection, LLC v. Tala Madani. While attending Oregon State University, Madani had a storage locker that was filled will 114 of her paintings, that was later found at a storage locker auction and purchased by Independence Collection, LLC. Madani's work was included in the 2017 Whitney Biennial held at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. Awards have included Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation (2013), Catherine Doctorow Prize for Contemporary Painting (2013), the De Volkskrant Art Award (2012), Pinchuk Art Centre (2012), the Van den Berch van Heemstede Stichting Fellowship (2008), and the Kees Verwey Fellowship (2007).

Once Kaientai Dojo arrived in Japan in April 2002, Mashimo started as a wrestler using a grappling and shoot style, finishing his opponents quickly by KO or TKO before starting a short series of matches with Isami which Mashimo lost 3-1, but in doing so, won a lot of crowd support for his fire and spirit. Mashimo did not affiliate with any units in the early years, instead choosing to fight anyone. 2003 also saw Mashimo have his biggest match in his career since debuting as a wrestler, taking on NJPW junior legend Jyushin Thunder Liger in an impressive match which opened eyes to him. He also travelled to some other promotions that year, including Riki Choshu's World Japan. In 2004, he allied with Kunio Toshima and SUPER-X but never officially making a faction. Toshima & Mashimo won the UWA and UWF Intercontinental tag team titles, but vacated them after winning due to winning them in a Handicap match in the tournament final as Hi69's partner, MIYAWAKI was injured earlier in the night. Mashimo also got the biggest chance of his career, challenging Heat for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. He also made it to the STRONGEST-K '04 finals that year after dispatching of Taka Michinoku in the semifinals. However, Mashimo was defeated by Hi69 in the finals at Tokyo's Korakuen Hall. In 2005, under the guidance of former Far East Connection manager, 296, Kengo Mashimo formed a stable along with KAZMA called Kinnoutou and Kinnoutou started to dominate, eventually taking in Ryota Chikuzen and Kunio Toshima as well. Mashimo and KAZMA though were the most successful of the group, Mashimo going undefeated from the formation of Kinnoutou and did not drop a fall until well after he left the group. Kengo Mashimo and KAZMA won the first Strongest-K Tag Team tournament and were crowned the first ever Strongest-K Tag Team Champions, the two dominating the tag team scene in K-DOJO as they also won the UWA and UWF Intercontinental Tag Team titles, absorbing them into the STRONGEST-K Tag Team title. When K-DOJO split its roster into two, Mashimo, along with the rest of his Kinnoutou allies were drafted to GET. Mashimo's singles dominance was also highlighted with winning the STRONGEST-K '05 tournament, defeating Yuji Hino in one of the longest singles matches in K-DOJO history. Early 2006 saw Mashimo and KAZMA lose their first ever tag match together, losing the STRONGEST-K Tag Team title in February to Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi. After losing, signs of friction started to grow in Kinnoutou with Kunio Toshima's sense of justice saving TAKU Michinoku from a Kinnoutou attack. Mashimo and Toshima battled each other until Mashimo defeated Toshima in April. Mashimo resumed his quest to become the ace of K-DOJO and became the first man to win the STRONGEST-K tournament twice by defeating Saburo Inematsu in the final and after his win, he left Kinnoutou and jumped to RAVE where he was a lone wolf after rejecting attempts from New Standard, Kashiwa Gumi and the Boso Heroes. Finally, after two years of chasing, Mashimo finally gained K-DOJO's Strongest-K Championship title by defeating the popular JOE and became the ace of the company. After joining RAVE and winning the Strongest-K Championship, Mashimo started a rival partnership with the newly unmasked Madoka. Mashimo also appeared regularly on Big Mouth Loud and later Uwai Station shows. Mashimo and Madoka fought for Mashimo's title at the January Korakuen show, but resumed their partnership after, the two winning the 2007 STRONGEST-K Tag Team Tournament and followed it by winning in the GPWA sponsored Differ Cup tournament. Mashimo's Kinnoutou past was brought back to him, defeating his ex-partner KAZMA in the main event for the 5th Anniversary show in April, then taking on Ryota Chikuzen for his title a few months later. Once GET and RAVE merged, Mashimo kept his partnership with Madoka and brought Boso Boy Raito into their alliance, however never officially becoming a group. Mashimo began a short feud with TAKA Michinoku, Mashimo forcing TAKA to prove himself after an average two years, which led to a title match on TAKA's 15 Anniversary show which Mashimo won. 2007 has also seen Mashimo start an interpromotional rivalry with BJW heavyweight Daisuke Sekimoto, the two fighting on nearly every Indy Summit show, culmulating in a BJW Tag Team title match with Mashimo teaming with DDT star HARASHIMA in a 30-minute draw against champions Sekimoto and Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX's Yoshihito Sasaki. On September 7, 2012, Mashimo began working for New Japan Pro Wrestling, joining the Suzuki-gun stable, which also included his trainer Taka Michinoku. Mashimo's first big match in New Japan took place on September 23 at Destruction, where he was defeated by Togi Makabe in a singles match. On November 15, Mashimo entered a tournament to determine the inaugural NEVER Openweight Champion. After wins over Bushi and Ryusuke Taguchi, Mashimo was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals on November 19 by Karl Anderson. From November 20 to December 1, Mashimo took part in the round-robin portion of the 2012 World Tag League, alongside Suzuki-gun leader Minoru Suzuki. The team finished with a record of three wins and three losses, failing to advance from their block. In February 2013, Mashimo took part in Suzuki-gun's war with the Chaos stable, which built to a singles match on February 10 at The New Beginning, where he was defeated by Shinsuke Nakamura. In early 2014, Mashimo began working regularly for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) as a member of Kenso's Dark Kingdom stable. However, on August 30, Mashimo turned on Kenso and his stable. On May 21, 2017, Mashimo won his first title in AJPW, when he and Kai defeated Bodyguard and Zeus for the World Tag Team Championship. They lost the title back to Bodyguard and Zeus on June 11.

The group specialises in 14th to 16th century music from Flanders and takes its name from the historical Flemish chapel (capilla flamenca), the choir of the court chapel of Emperor Charles V. When the emperor left Flanders in 1517, he took his best musicians with him to Spain to accompany him as \\"living polyphony\\". The ensemble's Artistic Director, Dirk Snellings, died in 2014. The ensemble had ceased performing in November of the previous year.Gramophone Magazine (21 July). \\"Capilla Flamenca's Dirk Snellings has died\\". Retrieved 22 July 2015. Members The core of the Capilla Flamenca is four male singers, Marnix De Cat (Countertenor), Tore Tom Denys (Tenor, who succeeded Jan Caals in 2006), Lieven Termont (Baritone) and Dirk Snellings (1959-2014),(Bass), who is also the group's artistic director, and a musicologist.Hommage √† Dirk Snellings (obituary) For each performance, the vocal core is enlarged either with complementary singers, an alta capella of wind instruments, a bassa capella of string instruments and/or an organ according to the needs of the genre. Among the singers, Psallentes (‚Äúthe singers‚Äù) stand out, a Belgian vocal group specialising in plainsong and directed by Hendrik Vanden Abeele. The members of the windbands Oltremontano, directed by sackbut-player Wim Becu, and La Caccia, directed by Patrick Denecker (recorder and bagpipes) frequently perform the function of alta capella. Capilla Flamenca has also performed and made recordings with Philadelphia-based Piffaro. The bassa capella consists of lute-player Jan van Outryve and viola da gamba-players Liam Fennelly, Thomas Baet√© and Piet Stryckers. Joris Verdin is the group's organ player. Repertoire=Franco- Flemish polyphony Capilla Flamenca specialises in Franco-Flemish polyphony, focusing on the music of around 1500. Recordings and performances of religious and profane works by Pierre de la Rue, Josquin des Prez, Heinrich Isaac, Johannes Prioris, Jacob Obrecht, to name just a few, have been executed since the ensemble's formation in the 1980s. Over the years, the group's interest has expanded to include earlier music, most notably the so-called Ars Nova and Ars Subtilior of the 14th century. The group's recordings and performances are characterised by musicological research and by attention to authentic performance. Capilla Flamenca's analysis is based on a study of the original sources, in co-operation with fellow musicologists.See e.g. the publication of the Brussels Manuscript II 270 by Bruno Bouckaert and Eugeen Schreurs, Collection of Middle Dutch and Sacred Songs, Leuven, 2005. Several anonymous compositions from this manuscript were recorded by Capilla Flamenca on the CD Lumina in 2006. This includes solving the typical conundrums of early music, such as the use of musica ficta, the problem of text-setting,In most manuscripts of polyphony, the text is not written under the notes to which it should be sung. Although some treatises on the subject, such as De musica verbali libri duo by Gaspar Stoquerus (1570), subsist and can be studied, it is mostly through the practice and experience of singing together that the singers discover the correct setting of the text. the correct use of mensural proportions, the decoding of canonsQuite often, when a canon is to be sung, only the Dux (leading voice) is written. It is left to the singers to find out when and at what pitch the Comes (following voice) is to start singing. Sometimes a riddle written in the manuscript contains the key to the canon. See Katelijne Schiltz and Bonnie J. Blackburne (eds.), Canons and Canonic Techniques, 14th-16th Centuries: Theory, Practice, and Reception History. Proceedings of the International Conference Leuven, 4‚Äì5 October 2005, Leuven, 2007. and the authentic pronunciation of French, Flemish and Latin .See Vera Scherr, Auff√ºhrungspraxis Vokalmusik Handbuch der lateinischen Aussprache, B√§renreiter, 1991. Cross-over Capilla Flamenca has made cross-over productions with artists from other artistic disciplines. Side by side with the dancers of Les Ballets C de la B, the Capilla toured the world with Foi, directed by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and choreographed by Joanna Dudley . Between 2003 and 2005 the production was performed more than 100 times. In 2005, the ensemble confronted Jacob Obrecht's music with the video artist Walter Verdin's view on the famous The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch.David Patrick Stearns, 'Piffaro melds music, Bosch', The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 13, 2006 (scan of the original article available on the Capilla Flamenca web site. More recently, in collaboration with the contemporary music ensemble Het Collectief, the Capilla Flamenca created 12X12, a programme combining Karl-Heinz Stockhausen's Tierkreis with Ars Nova polyphony . In 2007, Joanna Dudley joined them again in the theatre and video production Who killed Cock Robin?. Festivals and concert halls Capilla Flamenca has been a guest at festivals such as the Festival of Arezzo, the Holland Festival of Oude Muziek at Utrecht , Ferrara Musica , Festival de Saintes , Festival d‚ÄôAmbronay and Cuenca Religious music Week . In 2005, it was ensemble in residence at the Laus Polyphoniae Festival in Antwerp. The ensemble has appeared on the stages of concert halls, such as the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels , Concertgebouw Brugge , the Konzerthaus in Vienna and Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. Educational activities In addition to recording and performing, the Capilla Flamenca has a commitment to education. In order to further the understanding of polyphonic music, Capilla Flamenca's concerts are preceded by an introduction to the programme aimed at the general public. Capilla Flamenca and its members teach at music conservatories. They often teach master classes and workshops, both for experienced amateurs and for young professionals. From 2005 to 2007, Marnix De Cat worked with a group of boys and girls (pueri) in order to introduce them to polyphony. Like the 15th- and 16th-century choristers, the young singers were instructed by the magister puerorum (master of the choristers) in the rules of music and the art of singing through simple songs and plainsong. This resulted in a number of concerts and a CD. Awards In 2003, Capilla Flamenca received the Premio Il Filarmonico at the festival of Arezzo.Provincia di Arezzo In 2005, it was awarded the Flanders Cultural Award (‚ÄúCultuurprijs Vlaanderen‚Äù) for music.cultuurweb.be Discography *1993 - Puer nobis.

Background At their height, the firm had over 700 members and were among the more violent football hooligan firms in England. In January 1998, dozens of hooligans invaded the pitch at the club's new Britannia Stadium at the end of a 7‚Äì0 Division One defeat by Birmingham City and several seats were thrown onto the pitch. This was one of several traumatic events in one of the worst seasons in the club's history, as they were relegated from Division One at the end of it. On 21 October 2001 84 people were arrested after rival fans clashed at Stoke City's local Potteries derby with Port Vale. Violence broke out in the streets around Vale Park in the Burslem district of Stoke. There were two pitch invasions and fans from both clubs threw missiles at each other. About 300 police officers were drafted in to keep the peace. On 29 December hooligans from the Naughty Forty and another firm associated with the club the Under 5's fought with hooligans from Huddersfield Town in Huddersfield. In the worst incident Stoke fans smashed up and set fire to the White Hart pub, causing extensive damage. On 28 April 2002 Stoke City played Cardiff City at home. Staffordshire Police mounted a large operation and had to call in officers from other forces and around 1,000 officers were on duty on the day. The match had to be halted for seven minutes as the police attempted to arrest Stoke hooligans in the ground. After the game police were pelted with stones, and Cardiff City chairman Sam Hammam had his car vandalised. On 1 May, violence again erupted between hooligans of the two clubs when they met in a Division Two play-off match. Five people were arrested as trouble erupted after Cardiff lost the match, when hooligans from both clubs confronted each othert outside Ninian Park. Three police officers needed hospital treatment following disturbances while a number of others suffered minor injuries. Officers using batons struggled to keep the two sets of fans apart as missiles, including stones, bottles and fence posts, were thrown from the Cardiff side. Former N40 founding member, Mark Chester, wrote a book about his exploits with the firm in 2006 stating that he was a reformed character, and that he was not proud of his past, having moved on from the violence of football hooliganism.

The home was built in 1917 and was among the first five built on Enfield Road. All were completed by 1918 and are listed in the city directory for that year. It is the only surviving house of these originals. Architecture The home is a two-story stucco structure with a wide porch, built in the Prairie School style after Frank Lloyd Wright. It is one of ten remaining Prairie School buildings in the Old Enfield neighborhood. The home has been described as a special ‚ÄúAustin vernacular‚Äù adaption by an expert on Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. History The Enfield neighborhood was platted from the eastern pasture of Elisha M. Pease's expansive Woodlawn estate in 1914. This structure was part of the \\"Enfield A\\" subdivision. It is located at 1102 Enfield Road, on a slight rise where Enfield Road begins. This home and its garage apartment are contributing structures to the Old West Austin Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In June and August 2006 respectively, the Austin Historic Landmark Commission and Austin Planning Commission deemed the home worthy of historic designation. The City Preservation Officer has also argued for the home's historic preservation. Notable residents Ethel Felder was born in Chappell Hill, Texas on October 9, 1886. Her family had large land holdings in that county, and the town of Felder was near Chappell Hill. Felder married Harry Daniel Webster and bore two children, Dan and Barbara. Mrs. Webster was widowed at age 26 in 1912. Webster had an exhibition of miniatures at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1914 when she was living in Westport, Connecticut. She was also listed in \\"Who‚Äôs Who in Art\\" as a painter there in 1915. Ethel Felder Webster is listed in \\"Who Was Who in American Art: 400 Years of Artists in America.\\" By 1918, Webster and her children had moved to Austin and were living in this home. After several years, they moved to California where she, a pianist, was on the faculty of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. Her surviving paintings show a gift for realistic portraits, including a self-portrait of a modern woman with short hair and the clothing and jewelry of the late 1920s. Harry Daniel Webster, a nationally known sculptor, was born in Iowa in 1880 and trained by master sculptors and painters. He created statues in Saugatuck, Westport (\\"The Minuteman\\"), and at the State Capitol at Pierre, South Dakota. He also sculpted a statue of Senator W.H.H. Beadle of South Dakota, which was placed in Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. Webster also created the great bronze doors for Austin‚Äôs American National Bank Building, originally located in the Littlefield Building at Sixth and Congress). The doors were cast by Tiffany. Their West Texas theme with prominent longhorns reflects the life of cattle baron George Littlefield. (These massive doors were given to UT and are now in the Ashbel Smith Building on West Sixth Street.) Mr. Webster died at age 32 in 1912. Before the original owner of this house was known, it was named for two others prominent former residents: State Appeals Judge James Baugh and UT department chair Malcolm Colby.

Roberson played in college at Kansas State University and had brief career with the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. He was the starting quarterback at K-State from 2001 to 2003, before starting a career in the Canadian Football League. College career Roberson was a top recruit of Kansas State and Bill Snyder, who was an advocate of fast, mobile quarterbacks. He is in the Kansas State record books for several achievements, including ranking fourth on the single season quarterback rating of 143.2 in 2003 and he is also sixth with a rating of 136.5 in 2002. He also holds the school record for touchdown passes in a season, with 24 in 2003. 2000 In 2000 Roberson played sparingly, taking over at one point for a poorly performing Jonathan Beasley. 2001 In 2001, Roberson split time with Marc Dunn, the Wildcats finished with a 6-6 record. 2002 On September 21, 2002, Roberson came off the bench and had 204 total yards and 4 touchdowns as #25 Kansas State upset #11 USC 27-20. Roberson, who coach Snyder had told the media he'd grade \\" somewhere between average and C-minus\\", was named the starter after the game. Roberson lead the Wildcats to a successful season, winning the 2002 Holiday Bowl against Arizona State and finishing #6 in the polls. 2003 In 2003, the Wildcats entered the season ranked #7 in the top 25, in part due to the strong play by Roberson and running back Darren Sproles. During the third game of the season against McNeese State, Roberson suffered a hand injury and missed a month of playing time. Kansas State was upset by Marshall during one of the games Roberson missed, and Roberson's injury held back his performance once he returned, leading to three consecutive losses and Kansas State dropping out of the top 25 entirely. However, they recovered and won 6 games in a row and earned a berth to the 2003 Big 12 Championship Game against #1 Oklahoma. The Wildcats won 35-7, Roberson was named the Most Valuable Player of the game, completing 10 of 17 passes with no interceptions and four touchdown passes, which accounted for all Kansas State offensive scores in the game. He also rushed 17 times for 62 yards.Big 12 Conference - Official Athletic Site The win earned the Wildcats a berth in the 2004 Fiesta Bowl. =2004 Fiesta Bowl controversy= In the early morning hours of New Year's Day, 2004, police were called to the Kansas State team hotel in Paradise Valley, Arizona, by a woman who accused Roberson of sexually assaulting her.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/football/ncaa/specials/bowls/2003/01/01/roberson.suspect/ Roberson and the rest of the Kansas State team were in town to play Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl. Police did not arrest Roberson, and later determined that no crime had been committed and no charges should be filed, but an investigation by the Kansas State athletic department concluded that Roberson and several other players had violated unspecified team rules. As a result, Roberson was stripped of his scholarship by head coach Bill Snyder. Snyder decided this after the bowl game, which the Wildcats lost 35-28. Canadian football Roberson went undrafted in the 2005 NFL Draft, and was not signed to an NFL team afterwards. Roberson played quarterback in the Canadian Football League with the Montreal Alouettes, where he was a third-string quarterback in 2005 and then in 2006 became a wide receiver. In 2005, his rookie season in the CFL, Roberson tore his rotator cuff and was out for the season.

She made her first screen appearance in the pilot episode \\"In The Hands Of Giants Pt 1\\", which was broadcast on 28 August 2007. Casting Hazlehurst signed up for a part in City Homicide, after learning that series would have a strong ensemble cast. She told Erin McWhirter of The Courier-Mail \\"I like the idea of the regular cast and the reasons dramas have failed is because they haven't assembled a group of well- known people. They will have one but when you look at six faces and you only know or like one you have to really like that one person to watch.\\" Hazlehurst initially commuted from Queensland to Melbourne for filming, before moving to the latter city when she found the travelling too much. Development Hazlehurst admitted that she was intrigued by the chance to play a strong female character, who was in an executive position within the police force and had the respect of her colleagues. The actress met with members from the real Victoria Police homicide squad, so she could understand her character better. Hazlehurst described Bernice as \\"tenacious, intuitive and tough\\". She went on to say \\"I understand the difficulties of being a female in a male world. I think most females do. But in a profession like the police, for a woman to get this rank she would have to have these qualities in spades. It was important she be someone who was able to command respect, who has authority, doesn't take bulls--- and trusts her instincts to have good people on her team and let them do their jobs.\\" A TV Week writer called Bernice \\"tough and fiercely competitive\\" and commented that her goal was to become Commissioner. They added \\"She believes that women have as much of a right to be in the top ranks of the service as their male counterparts, but she also thinks they have to earn their place like she did. Behind the tough professional exterior, Bernice is a compassionate single mother to 14-year-old Josh.\\" In February 2009, Hazlehurst reflected on her character's journey, saying \\"Waverley's life and career have taken some extreme twists and unexpected turns over the last two seasons, and playing her has been a terrific challenge and a huge learning curve.\\" She found that she had even more respect for the work that the police do every day, and she had more understanding of the pressure they were under in their professional and personal lives. A major storyline for the character was the kidnapping and death of her teenage son, Josh (played by Hazlehurst's son William Jarratt). The storyline begins with Bernice being investigated for alleged misconduct. She then learns that she is being set up by Billy Pierce (Simon Stone), the brother of a policeman that Bernice had come into contact with some years prior. Bernice had been the chair of a committee that rejected Billy's brother's application for remuneration. Afterwards, he committed suicide and Billy found him. Billy later kidnaps Bernice's son Josh, and taunts her with clues as to his whereabouts. Hazlehurst thought Billy's revenge plan was \\"perfectly executed\\" and said \\"he's a very disturbed but intelligent man who's established a near foolproof scheme to bring Bernice undone.\\" Hazlehurst called the storyline the hardest thing she has ever done, but she enjoyed playing something that challenged her. She also enjoyed being out and about, as most of Bernice's scenes were shot in her office. When asked if it was easier to summon up the emotions knowing it was her own son, Hazlehurst replied \\"certainly, yes - since it was my own son, there was another layer of emotion there.\\" The actress added that she hoped viewers would be moved by the storyline and that her respect for what the police do increased \\"tremendously\\". Storylines Bernice Waverley has been a cop since she was 18 years old and in the force for over 30 years at the beginning of the series. She has a teenage son, Josh, and is close friends with Detective Senior Sergeant Stanley Wolfe and Assistant Commissioner Bill Mulholland (John McTernan). Bernice is accused of corruption and is suspended from the police force, leading her to try and prove she has been set up. Bernice's son Josh is kidnapped by the man framing her Billy Pierce, and it emerges that he is the brother of a former police officer who Bernice had a hand in dismissing from the force. He became deeply depressed and committed suicide. Billy sends Bernice clues as to Josh's whereabouts, but he kills Josh in the same way that his brother died, by slashing his wrists. Bernice is reinstated into the police force, and Stanley consoles her over Josh's murder. After Stanley goes on leave, Bernice returns to homicide to take over his position, after Bill Mulholland arranges it especially for her. Bernice is promoted to Commander of Crime, leaving Stanley to resume his original position. Reception While reviewing the series, Farah Farouque from The Age stated \\"It's also splendid to see Noni Hazlehurst breaking TV's glass ceiling to play the boss, Superintendent Bernice Waverley, as a woman of a certain age ‚Äì who has not resorted to surgical enhancement. Now, if only she could score more screen time, too.\\" Josephine Gillespie of The Queensland Times branded Bernice \\"a hard-talking police officer\\". The Sunshine Coast Daily's Nathanael Cooper praised Hazlehurst in the role, saying she \\"delivered such a compelling performance in the second season that she has managed to establish herself as one of the most popular actresses on television.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Bernice Waverley at Yahoo!7 *Bernice Waverley at TV Week Category:City Homicide characters Category:Fictional Australian police detectives Category:Female characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 2007 ","title":"Bernice Waverley"},{"id":"13363836","text":"The Zamagna (in Italian; Zamanja, D≈æamanjiƒá or Zamanjiƒá in Serbo-Croatian) was one of the noble families (post-Roman patriciates) of the Republic of Ragusa.

Built in the 1760s, it is notable as the first home in America of painter and naturalist John James Audubon (1785-1851) for which the community is named. The estate is now maintained as a museum and wildlife sanctuary by Montgomery County, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989. The house serves as the educational center of the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Audubon Society, and is known as John James Audubon Center at Mill Grove. Description and history Mill Grove is located on the west side of the village of Audubon, just north of Valley Forge National Historical Park. The estate consists of more than of mainly woodlands on the south bank of Perkiomen Creek, bounded on the south by Pawlings Road. The main house is a 2-1/2 story stone structure, oriented to overlook the creek. Its roof faces are each pierced by three wood frame gabled dormers, and there are stone chimneys at the interior of each end. A single-story ell extends the building to one side, and a gabled porch shelters the main entrance. The house was built about 1762 by James Morgan, who also operated a mill and lead mine on the property. He built the addition in 1765 to serve as a tavern for passing travelers. Due to its proximity to Valley Forge, it was looted during the American Revolutionary War, although the house was spared from significant damage. The property was purchased in 1789 by Jean Audubon, a French sea captain. In 1803 he sent his seventeen-year-old son Jean (who soon anglicized his name John James Audubon) to Mill Grove to oversee further development of the mine. Instead of doing so, the young Audubon became enamored with the natural beauty of the area. In the two years he spent here, he taught himself methods of tracking birds by banding, and how to set specimens for drawings. He also became engaged to Lucy Bakewell, returning here in 1808 for the wedding. During Audubon's absence between 1805 and 1808, the property was overseen by another Frenchman, to whom Audubon sold the property following his wedding. In 1813 it was bought by Samuel Wetherill, in whose family it remained until 1951. His heirs turned the property over to the county, which has managed it since as a wildlife preserve and nature center. The estate now comprises with more than five miles (8 km) of trails. The house features a museum displaying original Audubon prints, all of his major oil paintings and memorabilia.

It was a part of ESPN Radio from 1 pm to 4 pm, with all three hours also simulcasted on ESPNews. On April 26, 2017 Danny Kanell was let go by ESPN after a number of personnel were laid off, leaving only Russillo to host the show. December 22, 2017 was the last day of The Ryen Russillo Show due to a contract dispute, although Russillo's contract runs until August 2018. He will be doing weekly podcasts until his contract expires. Will Cain took over the timeslot with his own radio show on January 2, 2018. The previous version of the show was launched as The Scott Van Pelt Show on July 6, 2009, replacing Tirico & Van Pelt, which was co-hosted by Scott Van Pelt and Mike Tirico. That show began on September 20, 2007 as The Mike Tirico Show, with Van Pelt, Michele Tafoya and Kirk Herbstreit as rotating co-hosts. The Mike Tirico Show aired from 1 pm to 3 pm under that title for a total of 160 shows until April 30, 2008. On May 1, 2008 the show was officially renamed Tirico & Van Pelt. Van Pelt also began hosting the first version of The Scott Van Pelt Show, which aired from 3 pm to 4 pm, immediately following T&VP.; Van Pelt's solo hour ended in March 2009 as T&VP; moved to 2 pm to 4 pm. Tirico left the series in June 2009 to focus on his work with ESPN television, and Ryen Russillo became a co-host. On October 4, 2012, the show officially changed its title to SVP & Russillo. In May 2015, Van Pelt announced that he was leaving the show to become the weeknight midnight anchor on SportsCenter starting in the late summer of 2015 (September 7). Kanell, who had been a regular substitute co-host during the SVP era, was named permanent co-host with Russillo from September 2015 until Kanell's departure in April 2017. Timeslot history The Mike Tirico Show and The Stephen A. Smith Show replaced a rotation of various hosts, under the umbrella title This is ESPN Radio, which had been airing since Dan Patrick announced on July 9, 2007 that he would leave The Dan Patrick Show on August 17 of that year. Patrick was held off-air following that announcement and the subsequent announcement that he would move to a new syndicated radio show save for three final episodes airing August 15 through 17. On March 22, 2008, it was announced that Scott Van Pelt would become Tirico's permanent co-host, and would host the 3‚Äì4 pm hour solo. The Stephen A. Smith Show aired its final episode on April 11, 2008, with Smith focusing more on ESPN television at that time; SportsNation began an hour earlier for two weeks until Van Pelt began hosting the hour on May 1. The 3 pm hour is heard on far fewer affiliates than the 1‚Äì3 pm timeslot, as many local sports talk shows air at 3 pm in the Eastern Time Zone. On New York City's ESPN-owned WEPN, Mike Tirico originally aired only for its first hour, followed by Smith's local show from 2‚Äì3 pm and his national show from 3‚Äì4 pm; following Smith's departure, Tirico & Van Pelt began airing in the country's largest market in its entirety, with Michael Kay adding another hour, taking over Smith's national hour. In January 2009, Kay's show expanded earlier again, to 2 pm, truncating T&VP; back to one hour in the New York market. As part of a programming overhaul, ESPN Radio moved Tirico & Van Pelt from its 1‚Äì3 pm Eastern slot to 2‚Äì4 pm Eastern on March 16, 2009, discontinuing Van Pelt's solo hour. The show currently does not air in New York, but does air in Los Angeles and for one hour in Chicago. Former logo when Scott Van Pelt co-hosted with Ryen Russillo As of the 2008 NFL football season, Carl Brutananadilewski, a popular character on the Adult Swim animated television series Aqua Teen Hunger Force (currently titled Aqua Teen Hunger Force Forever), has made appearances on The Scott Van Pelt Show. In a segment on Friday afternoons, Carl picks one NFL game's winner every week known as \\"Carl's Stone Cold Lock of the Century ... of the Week\\". Meatwad has also introduced Van Pelt's weekly NCAA and NFL football picks. Pictures of Meatwad, Master Shake, and Frylock can be seen on the main desk of Van Pelt's radio show when it is shown on ESPN television networks.

A Union Army veteran of the American Civil War, he was most notable for his service as Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic and a U.S. Representative from New York's 24th congressional district. Biography Shaw was born in Lyme, New York on December 21, 1841, a son of Henry Shaw and Sally Ann (Gardner) Shaw. Shaw was raised on his family's farm in Lyme, and attended the local schools. He was a student at Union Academy in Belleville and St. Lawrence University in Canton before leaving school to join the military. Military service Shaw enlisted in the Union Army for the American Civil War, joining Company A, 35th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a private in June 1861. He was later promoted to corporal, and he served until being mustered out with the rest of his regiment in June 1863. Shaw took part in the regiment's activities in Virginia and Maryland, including; construction of Fort Tillinghast and Fort Craig (autumn 1861); guard and patrol duty in and around Falls Church, Virginia (winter 1861-1862); guard and patrol duty in and around Falmouth, Virginia (spring 1862); battles at Rappahannock Station, White Sulphur Springs, and Gainesville (summer 1862); Second Battle of Bull Run (August 1862); Chantilly (September 1862); South Mountain (September 1862); Antietam (September 1862); and Fredericksburg (December 1862). In January, 1863, the regiment was assigned to the provost guard brigade in Falmouth, and also performed guard and patrol duty along the Aquia Creek railroad. In May, the regiment left Maryland for New York so it could be mustered out. After his discharge, Shaw was appointed a special agent of the Army provost marshal's office in Watertown, and served until the close of the war. The provost marshal's duties included keeping track of men eligible for military service, and compelling them to report if they refused to answer the call. In addition, the provost marshal kept records on paid substitutes and men who had been paid bounties to enlist, and arrested them if they failed to leave for the front lines. The provost marshal's staff also tracked down deserters from the front lines and returned them to their units or imprisoned them. After the war, Shaw was commissioned as a colonel and assigned as commander of the New York National Guard's 36th Infantry Regiment. He served until resigning in 1868 to accept a US consul's appointment. Start of career Shaw returned to St. Lawrence University after the Civil War, but left before completing his degree. In 1866, he was a successful Republican candidate for the New York State Assembly from the 2nd District of Jefferson County, and he served in the 90th New York State Legislature (1867). In 1868, Shaw was appointed as United States consul in Toronto, Canada. He served until 1878, and Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State, commended Shaw's written reports as the best in the consular service. In 1878, Shaw was appointed as consul in Manchester, England, and he served until 1885, when the newly-elected administration of Grover Cleveland replaced him with a Democratic appointee. Later career After leaving Manchester, Shaw resided in Watertown, and was a sought after speaker for holidays, the dedications of Civil War memorials, and Republican political campaigns. He was also active in Watertown's civic life, including service as president of its Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) and chamber of commerce. Shaw was long active in the Grand Army of the Republic, and was elected department commander for New York in 1897. In 1899 he was elected commander-in-chief of the GAR's national organization, and he served until 1900. Congressman In 1900, Shaw was elected as a Republican to fill the vacancy in the 56th Congress that was caused by the death of Charles A. Chickering. He was reelected to the 57th Congress, but died before the term began on March 4, 1901. Shaw's brief Congressional service spanned from November 6, 1900 until his death. Death and burial Shaw died in Washington, D.C. on February 10, 1901. News accounts indicated that he returned to his room at the Riggs House hotel after attending a banquet in honor of Leo Rassieur, his successor as GAR commander-in-chief.

In more colloquial terms, the health of soil arises from favorable interactions of all soil components (living and non- living) that belong together, as in microbiota, plants and animals. It is possible that a soil can be healthy in terms of eco-system functioning but not necessarily serve crop production or human nutrition directly, hence the scientific debate on terms and measurements. Soil health testing is pursued as an assessment of this status NRCS 2013 but tends to be confined largely to agronomic objectives, for obvious reasons. Soil health depends on soil biodiversity (with a robust soil biota), and it can be improved via soil management, especially by care to keep protective living covers on the soil and by natural (carbon-containing) soil amendments. Inorganic fertilizers do not necessarily damage soil health if 1) used at appropriate and not excessive rates and 2) if they bring about a general improvement of overall plant growth which contributes more carbon-containing residues to the soil.  Aspects The term soil health is used to describe the state of a soil in: *Sustaining plant and animal productivity (agronomic focus); *Enhancing biodiversity (Soil biodiversity) (ecological focus); *Maintaining or enhancing water and air quality (environmental/climate focus); *Supporting human health and habitation. *Sequestering Carbon Soil Health has partly if not largely replaced the expression \\"Soil Quality\\" that was extant in the 1990s. The primary difference between the two expressions is that soil quality was focused on individual traits within a functional group, as in \\"quality of soil for maize production\\" or \\"quality of soil for roadbed preparation\\" and so on. The addition of the word \\"health\\" shifted the perception to be integrative, holistic and systematic. The two expressions still overlap considerably. Soil Health as an expression derives from organic or \\"biological farming\\" movements in Europe, however, well before soil quality was first applied as a discipline around 1990. In 1978, Swiss soil biologist Dr Otto Buess wrote an essay \\"The Health of Soil and Plants\\" which largely defines the field even today. The underlying principle in the use of the term ‚Äúsoil health‚Äù is that soil is not just an inert, lifeless growing medium, which modern intensive farming tends to represent, rather it is a living, dynamic and ever-so-subtly changing whole environment. It turns out that soils highly fertile from the point of view of crop productivity are also lively from a biological point of view. It is now commonly recognized that soil microbial biomass is large: in temperate grassland soil the bacterial and fungal biomass have been documented to be 1‚Äì/hectare and 2‚Äì/ha, respectively. Some microbiologists now believe that 80% of soil nutrient functions are essentially controlled by microbes.The Role of Soil Biology in Improving Soils Webinar Using the human health analogy, a healthy soil can be categorized as one: *In a state of composite well-being in terms of biological, chemical and physical properties; *Not diseased or infirmed (i.e. not degraded, nor degrading), nor causing negative off-site impacts; *With each of its qualities cooperatively functioning such that the soil reaches its full potential and resists degradation; *Providing a full range of functions (especially nutrient, carbon and water cycling) and in such a way that it maintains this capacity into the future.  Conceptualisation  Image:SoilHealthConcept.jpg Soil health is the condition of the soil in a defined space and at a defined scale relative to a set of benchmarks that encompass healthy functioning. It would not be appropriate to refer to soil health for soil-roadbed preparation, as in the analogy of soil quality in a functional class. The definition of soil health may vary between users of the term as alternative users may place differing priorities upon the multiple functions of a soil. Therefore, the term soil health can only be understood within the context of the user of the term, and their aspirations of a soil, as well as by the boundary definition of the soil at issue. Finally, intrinsic to the discussion on soil health are many potentially conflicting interpretations, especially ecological landscape assessment vs agronomic objectives, each claiming to have soil health criteria.  Interpretation  Different soils will have different benchmarks of health depending on the ‚Äúinherited‚Äù qualities, and on the geographic circumstance of the soil. The generic aspects defining a healthy soil can be considered as follows: *‚ÄúProductive‚Äù options are broad; *Life diversity is broad; *Absorbency, storing, recycling and processing is high in relation to limits set by climate; *Water runoff quality is of high standard; *Low entropy; and, *No damage to, or loss of the fundamental components. This translates to: *A comprehensive cover of vegetation; *Carbon levels relatively close to the limits set by soil type and climate; *Little leakage of nutrients from the ecosystem; *Biological and agricultural productivity relatively close to the limits set by the soil environment and climate; *Only geological rates of erosion; *No accumulation of contaminants; and, An unhealthy soil thus is the simple converse of the above.  Measurement  On the basis of the above, soil health will be measured in terms of individual ecosystem services provided relative to the benchmark. Specific benchmarks used to evaluate soil health include CO2 release, humus levels, microbial activity, and available calcium. Soil health testing is spreading in the United States, Australia and South Africa. Cornell University, a land-grant college in NY State, has had a Soil Health Test since 2006. Woods End Laboratories, a private soil lab founded in Maine in 1975, has offered a soil quality package since 1985. Bost these services combine test for physical (aggregate stability) chemical (mineral balance) and biology (CO2 respiration) which today are considered hallmarks of soil health testing. The approach of other soil labs also entering the soil health field is to add into common chemical nutrient testing a biological set of factors not normally included in routine soil testing. The best example is adding biological soil respiration (\\"CO2-Burst\\") as a test procedure; this has already been adapted to modern commercial labs in the period since 2006. There is however resistance among soil testing labs and university scientists to add new biological tests, primarily since interpretation of soil fertility is based on models from \\"crop response\\" studies which match yield to test levels of specific chemical nutrients, and no similar models for interpretation appear to exist for soil health tests. Critics of novel soil health tests argue that they may be insensitive to management changes. Soil test methods have evolved slowly over the past 40 years. However, in this same time USA soils have also lost up to 75% of their carbon (humus), causing biological fertility and ecosystem functioning to decline; how much is debatable. Many critics of the conventional system say the loss of soil quality is sufficient evidence that the old soil testing models have failed us, and need to be replaced with new approaches. These older models have stressed \\"maximum yield\\" and \\" yield calibration\\" to such an extent that related factors have been overlooked. Thus, surface and groundwater pollution with excess nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) has grown enormously, and is reported presently (in the United States) to be the worst it has been since the 1970s, before the advent of environmental consciousness.

Once a person has accepted the responsibility of holding a church calling and has been accepted by the members for that position, one or more Melchizedek priesthood holders \\"set apart\\" the person to serve in that calling. The priesthood holders accomplish this by giving the person a priesthood blessing by the laying on of hands. If the recipient is being set apart as a president of a priesthood quorum, including a stake president or a bishop, \\"priesthood keys\\" are also conferred upon them.LDS Church (2006). Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) p. 47. Generally, only general authorities and local leaders of stakes, wards, missions, districts, and branches may set apart a member to serve in a position.LDS Church (2006). Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) pp. 47‚Äì58. When a person is released from serving in a calling, there is no ordinance comparable to setting apart that is used to signify the end of a person's service. A setting apart is different from a priesthood ordination. A person is ordained to a specific priesthood office, such as apostle, elder, high priest or deacon, but a person is set apart to callings such as counselor in the First Presidency, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, stake president, temple president, mission president, high councilor, or member of a quorum presidency or auxiliary organization presidency (such as the Relief Society or Sunday School). A bishop must be ordained to the priesthood offices of high priest and bishop and is then set apart as the bishop of a specific ward. A stake patriarch is ordained to the priesthood office of patriarch and is then set apart as the patriarch of a specific stake.

He was a Republican U.S. Representative from Texas during the Reconstruction era. Originally from Germany, Degener moved to the United States and lived in Texas. During the American Civil War, slave-holding Texas joined the Confederacy, but Degener remained loyal to the Union, and was persecuted by the Confederates for this loyalty to the U.S. Two of Degener's sons were murdered by the Confederates in the Nueces massacre. After the war ended, Degener served as a Republican congressman for the Texan 4th Congressional District and as a San Antonio city council member in the 1870s. He died in 1890.

Degener pleaded not guilty. His legal counsel challenged the legal authority of the military, and the charge of sedition, which was not a crime legally recognized by the government. Found guilty anyway, he was ordered to post a bond of $5,000 that he would be loyal to the Confederacy. Degener's sons Hugo and Hilmar died during the Nueces massacre when they were murdered by the Confederates.

He won his office in 1896 and 1898 with a plurality, as white voters split between Democratic and Populist party candidates. Early life and education Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1849, Hawley attended Catholic parochial schools and the Christian Brothers College there. After his father died when he was young, Hawley took on the duties of caring for his mother and siblings while still in his teens. He studied law under a Judge Bowman of Louisiana. Move to Texas and early career Hawley moved to Galveston in 1875 at the age of 21. He never practiced law however, instead becoming a merchant, importer, and manufacturer in the bustling port city for the next twenty years. On December 11, 1878 he married Mary Drake Rice with which he had one child, a daughter. He was elected to serve as president of the Galveston Board of Education from 1889 to 1893. Political career Hawley became active in Republican Party politics in the waning years of the Reconstruction era, a time when Texas was almost completely dominated by the Democratic Party. The Galveston area was a center of an urbanized population, including many German immigrants and African-American freedmen, groups that favored the Republican Party. On September 4, 1890 Hawley was elected as the temporary chairman of the Republican State convention in San Antonio. He served as a delegate to several Republican National conventions. In 1896 the one-term Democratic Congressman Miles Crowley chose not to run for reelection in Texas' 10th congressional district, which at the time included Galveston County. Hawley ran and was elected to the Fifty-fifth Congress. A 16 year-old Albert Lasker worked as a reporter on the campaign before moving to Chicago and a career in advertising. Hawley successfully ran for reelection in 1898 for the Fifty-sixth Congress. In each election Hawley triumphed with less than 50% of the vote, due to much of the white vote being split between the Democrats and the new Populist Party. During his four years in Congress, he was the only Republican elected from Texas. In office when Galveston was destroyed by the powerful 1900 hurricane, Hawley decided not to seek reelection. Hawley also realized the likely effects of the poll tax passed by the Texas legislature in 1901, which sharply reduced voting by minorities and poor whites. Total voter participation dropped markedly in the state in the early 1900s essentially ending Republican and Populist competition and leaving elections to be dominated by white Democrats.\\"Nixon v.

It began during the late 19th century as a meeting of Pennsylvanians living in New York City who gathered annually beginning in 1899 to discuss events in their home state. As the first few meetings developed into an annual event, it morphed into weekend-long retreat where political networking and fundraising took place in New York's finest clubs, restaurants, and hotels. The main event of the weekend is the \\"Pennsylvania Society Dinner,\\" which is sponsored by \\"The Pennsylvania Society,\\" a nonprofit corporation. In recent years the receptions hosted by lobbyists, political committees, and corporations have taken on increased importance. It has been criticized because of its image as a stereotypical \\"smoke-filled room\\" where lobby groups gain access to government officials, a few of whom have been known to use taxpayer funds to pay their way to New York. Other observers criticize the retreat for being held in New York instead of within Pennsylvania. Origins and organization The tradition for Pennsylvania's political and business retreat dates to 1899, when James Barr Ferree, a native Pennsylvanian living in New York invited a group of 55 other Pennsylvanians living in New York to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to discuss current affairs in their native state. The dinner became a recurring event and the group began calling themselves \\"The Pennsylvania Society of New York.\\" It later developed into an annual gathering of Pennsylvania politicians and businessmen on New York's \\"neutral ground.\\" The organization later changed its name to The Pennsylvania Society and became a nonprofit charitable organization. It was incorporated in 1903, and currently claims 2,000 members. While it sponsors a high school essay contest, the main function of the organization is to organize the weekend retreat. The gathering began as an exclusively Republican event, but it now includes a sizable number of Democrats. The early years of the meeting were reminiscent of the stereotypical smoke-filled room, where Pennsylvania steel, coal and oil magnates met in closed-door meetings to select their political candidates. That public perception continues, with political legend telling of New York- based businessmen summoning Pennsylvania's politicians to New York to receive their instructions for the following year. Events and receptions The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, site of the Pennsylvania Society Dinner. The main attraction of the weekend is the \\"Pennsylvania Society Dinner,\\" a black tie event held in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on the final night of the weekend. In 2005, about 1,500 individuals attended. However, much of the \\"real action\\" takes place in the invitation-only dinners and receptions hosted by businesses, candidates, and lobbying firms throughout the weekend. In an attempt to attract more attendees, hosts have hired top tier guests, including Jon Stewart, Lewis Black, and George H.W. Bush, who ended his 2003 speech with a reference to Dana Carvey's impression of him by saying, \\"Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent.\\" Several events have become well known for drawing high-powered guests, including the events hosted by the Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association. In 2004, an evening at an Upper East Side cigar lounge hosted by Republican national committeewoman Christine Toretti Olson gained significant praise from attendees. In a 2005 event, Rick Santorum was able to raise $46,000 for his 2006 re-election campaign and $130,000 for the Pennsylvania Republican Party. The Pennsylvania Society has become known as the \\"unofficial start of the next year's big political season\\" because of its reputation as a place for potential political candidates to make contacts, meet fundraisers, and make a name for themselves early in the electoral process. Former Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Bill DeWeese said in 2003 that the Pennsylvania Society is \\"a magnificent re- creation of the gilded age and the era of the robber barons of the late 19th century, when Fricks and Carnegies and Pews dominated Pennsylvania's commercial and political scene. Slender elements of its original purpose endure. However, it is primarily a hell of a party.\\" Criticism and Counter event East Wing of the Pennsylvania State Capitol, the site of the \\"Pennsylvania People's Dinner\\" protest event. Public watchdogs have criticized the event as a chance for \\"wealthy special interests to mingle with the movers and shakers in state government\\" or as a gathering for \\"fat cat\\" politicians away from their Pennsylvania constituents. During the 2005 Pennsylvania Society weekend, Gene Stilp and Eric Epstein, governmental reform and anti-pay raise activists, hosted the \\"Pennsylvania People's Dinner,\\" a reform-themed potluck dinner in the \\"darkened, barely heated\\" East Wing of the Pennsylvania State Capitol while the members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly are in New York City. The event, described as \\"part parody, part celebration\\" of the November repeal of the controversial pay raise, featured paper plates and folding chairs for the potluck style dinner. The hosts decorated the capitol with toy pigs, the mascot of the anti-pay-raise movement, and stuffed cows, mocking John Perzel's defense of the pay raise by claiming that \\"immigrant cow-milkers\\" make as much as legislators. The dinner has become an annual event, with the lack of lighting and heating becoming part of the tradition. The event has undergone several name changes: in 2006 it was called the \\"Pennsylvania New Society Dinner,\\" in 2007 it was the \\"Real Pennsylvania Society Dinner.\\" Location Attendees have been known to enjoy the New York City tourist attractions, including the Broadway theatre and the Fifth Avenue shopping district almost as much as, if not more than, the political networking opportunities. Political pundits frequently note the irony of holding the Pennsylvania Society in New York. In 2003, Ed Rendell suggested that the $20‚Äì$40 million economic impact from the event would best be directed to a city in Pennsylvania, but said \\"since I can't get a budget passed, I'm going to leave that for another day.\\" In 2005, Philadelphia City Council unanimously passed a resolution sponsored by Frank DiCicco calling for the event to be moved within Pennsylvania. \\"Everybody who is anybody, and everybody who wants to be somebody, is there.\\"\\"The three-day crush of Manhattan cocktail parties known as the Pennsylvania Society is a requisite stop for aspiring candidates and potential donors.\\" Many attendees downplay the Pennsylvania Society's corrupt image, with Ken Davis, chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Party, telling the Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"I don't know anybody who's been bought at Pennsylvania Society. Rented, maybe ‚Äì but not bought.\\"  See also  *Pennsylvania Federation of Historical Societies *List of dining events ReferencesFurther reading * External links *Pennsylvania Society official website *The Pennsylvania Society and Executive Order No. 002-04, Philadelphia Board of Ethics Category:Political conferences Category:Politics of Pennsylvania Category:Culture of New York City Category:Recurring events established in 1899 Category:Dining events ","title":"The Pennsylvania Society"},{"id":"13364209","text":"Cockrell in the Civil war Jeremiah Vardaman Cockrell, also known as Vard Cockrell, (May 7, 1832 - March 18, 1915) was a U.S. Representative from Texas, after having served as a field commander in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.

He was a member of the Democratic Party.\\"Blanton Censured, Falls Later In Faint\\", New York Times, October 28, 1921. Fetched from URL on 4 Aug 2010. Biography Born in Houston, Texas, Blanton was educated in the public schools. He graduated from the law department of the University of Texas at Austin in 1897, with three years in the academic department. He was admitted to the bar in 1897 and commenced practice in Cleburne. He moved to Albany, Texas, and continued the practice of law until 1908, when he was elected judge of the 42nd Judicial District of Texas. He was reelected in 1912 and served in that capacity until he was elected to Congress in 1916. Blanton was elected as a Democrat to the Sixty- fifth and to the five succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1917 ‚Äì March 3, 1929). Censure While a member of the House of Representatives of the Sixty- seventh Congress, Blanton inserted into the Congressional Record a letter purporting to have been written by one Millard French, a non-union printer, to \\"George H. Carter, Public Printer\\"; the letter recited a conversation reported to have occurred between French and a printer named Levi Huber who belonged to the union. The letter was said to contain language that was \\"unspeakable, vile, foul, filthy, profane, blasphemous and obscene\\", in the words of Representative Franklin Mondell, and the House voted to expunge the letter from the Congressional Record, on a vote of 313 to 1.\\"Blanton Expulsion from House Asked\\", New York Times, 26 August 1921.

Stevens of the University of Hawaii at Manoa wrote in a 1982 article that the offending remarks \\"were not all that offensive by today's standards,\\" and only took up half a column of the Record, and furthermore contained only 32 \\"obscene\\" words, which were already censored in the form of removing most of the letters and replacing them with underscores. A motion to expel Blanton failed by only eight votes, and he was unanimously censured by the House of Representatives on October 24, 1921, for \\"abuse of leave to print.\\" Mondell, the author of the expulsion resolution, claimed on the floor of the House of Representatives that \\"There is not a member who will not say that it is the vilest thing he has ever seen in print\\", and that \\"Any one speaking the words contained in the Congressional Record would be subject to fine and imprisonment under the laws of the land.\\" Representative Finis Garrett, defending Blanton, insisted Blanton had \\"no intention of being indecent but merely [had] a desire to show a condition existing between organized and non- organized labor in the printing office.\\" Subsequent events The censure motion did not appear to harm Blanton's reputation with his constituents and he was reelected to the House in 1922, 1924, and 1926.

He was re-elected to Congress from this rural district for more than 30 years, resigning in December 1978 rather than run again for office. Early life and education Born in Anson, the seat of Jones County, north of Abilene, Texas, Burleson attended the public schools there. He received his higher education at Abilene Christian College and Hardin-Simmons University, both in Abilene. Burleson went to Tennessee for law school, graduating in 1929 from Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee. He returned to Texas, where he was admitted to the bar the same year. He set up a practice in Gorman in Eastland County. With business slowing because of the Great Depression, Burleson sought public office. Legal and related career In 1930 Burleson was elected to his first public office, as County Attorney of Jones County, Texas, serving from 1931 to 1934. He next was elected as a judge in Jones County, serving from 1934 to 1940. In 1940 Burleson was hired as a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, serving into 1941. He entered politics, serving as a secretary and staff member to U.S. Representative Sam Russell of Texas's 17th congressional district in 1941 and 1942. With Russell's support, Burleson was appointed as general counsel for the Housing Authority in the District of Columbia in 1942; at that time, the District did not have home rule and was controlled by Congress through its committees. After the United States entered World War II, Burleson served in the United States Navy from December 1942 to April 1946. He was assigned to the South Pacific Theater. Political career Following the war, in 1946 Burleson was elected to national office as a Democrat from the area where he had established his reputation: Texas's 17th congressional district to the Eightieth Congress. He was reelected to the fifteen succeeding Congresses from this rural district, and served from January 3, 1947, until his resignation, December 31, 1978. Statue of Omar Burleson at Jones County Courthouse in Anson, Texas Because of his seniority, Burleson gained the chairmanships of the Committee on House Administration (Eighty-fourth through Ninetieth Congresses), the Joint Committee on the Library (Eighty-fourth through Ninetieth Congresses), and the Joint Committee on Printing (Eighty-fourth Congress). Burleson was one of the majority of the Texan delegation to decline to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto opposing the desegregation of public schools as ordered by the Supreme Court in its ruling on Brown v. Board of Education. It had determined that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. Delegations of other Southern states, particularly Virginia and some in the Deep South, did sign the manifesto and actively resisted such desegregation for years. But Burleson voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, which were directed at enforcing constitutional rights for African Americans and other minorities. He also opposed ratification of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which gave the federal government oversight and enforcement over state practices that discriminated against minority voters. Burleson chose against running for reelection in 1978. He was succeeded by the election of fellow conservative Democrat Charles Stenholm of Stamford, which is also in Jones County. Stenholm owned and operated a large cotton farm there, but lived in Abilene, Texas. After resigning from Congress, Burleson resided in Abilene until his death there on May 14, 1991. He is interred at the Mount Hope Cemetery in Anson, his hometown. Legacy A statue of Burleson was installed in his hometown of Anson at the Jones County Courthouse. He had also served there in his early career as County Attorney and judge of the County Circuit Court.

Early and family life Born in King William County, Virginia, Segar received a private education appropriate to his class. He studied law. He married Mary (1808-1886), who would survive him. They had several children, including a son John F. Segar (b. 1836) and a daughter, Virginia Segar (b. 1846) mentioned in the 1850 census.1850 U.S. Federal Census for Hampton, Elizabeth City County, VIrginia p. 10 of 19 The second Mary Segar was still living with Joseph Segar's household in 1860, as was a young man with middle initial misspelled as Arthur B Segar (born 1843).1860 U.S. Federal Census for Fox Hill, Elizabeth City County, Virginia p. 18 of 21. The latter was actually his nephew, Arthur Simpkins Segar, one of the sons of his slightly younger brother John A. Segar (1805-1848), who had married Charlotte Simpkins in 1832 and moved to Virginia's Eastern Shore, where they had a large family. Joseph Segar accepted his seven-year old nephew into his home in 1851, and paid for his education at two military schools, first the Hampton Academy, then the Danville academy. As the American Civil War began, on May 31, 1861, Arthur S. Segar in Hampton, Virginia enlisted in a Confederate rifle company as a private (the Wythe Rifles incorporated into the 32nd Virginia Infantry according to one source, the nominally Mississippi Hatchie Rifles according to another). By 1862 with his year-older brother John A. Segar (Jr.) (1843-1918) he joined the 6th Virginia Infantry defending Norfolk. For his efforts in the Seven Days Battles, A.S. Segar received a Virginia lieutenant's commission and with his brother was assigned to the 38th Virginia Infantry.  Career  Admitted to the bar, Joseph Segar practiced law in various counties in the Hampton Roads area, Elizabeth City County being across Chesapeake Bay from Norfolk, Virginia. Segar held several local offices, and was elected to represent Elizabeth City County and various neighboring counties several times (part time) in the Virginia House of Delegates, 1836‚Äì1838, 1848‚Äì1853, and 1855-1861. He also owned slaves, and relatives lived with the family. In 1840, his household included five slaves.1840 U.S. Federal Census for Elizabeth City p. 29 of 38 In 1850 the household also included two female relatives, Mary Segar (b. 1820) and Sally F. Segar (b. 1843). By 1860, Segar called himself a farmer rather than lawyer, probably because he operated a plantation in the seaside suburb of Hampton called (for its dunes) Fox Hill (and his son John also called himself a farmer). Segar owned seven slaves in 1860, all but two of them over fifty years old.1860 U.S. Federal Census for Fox Hill, Elizabeth City County, Virginia p. 1 of 10. The slaves were two 55-year old black men, black men aged 26 and 35 years old, two black women aged 55 and one aged 50. Although not mentioned in the census forms, Segar actually owned the Hygeia Hotel and most of the land between Fort Monroe and what became the Hampton Institute. When Union troops secured Fort Monroe in May 1861, Massachusetts troops converted the late former President John Tyler's summer home, Villa Margaret, into barracks and Federal troops also encamped on the Segar farm at the Hampton end of a bridge over what was sometimes called Mill Creek or Comfort Creek, for it led near Old Point Comfort. The camp was initially called Camp Troy, but later Camp Hamilton to honor then Lt.Col. Schuyler Hamilton, secretary to Gen. Winfield Scott. Congressional career Segar presented credentials as a Unionist Member- elect to the Thirty-seventh Congress from an election held on October 24, 1861, but the House on February 11, 1862, decided he was not entitled to the seat. Segar was subsequently elected to the same Congress and served from March 15, 1862, to March 3, 1863. In the Thirty-eighth Congress (1863‚Äì1865), no Virginia representatives were seated.Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, (1774‚Äì2005), \\"Official Annotated Membership Roster by State with Vacancy and Special Election Information for the 38th Congress \\". Segar presented credentials, but was declared not entitled to the seat by resolution of May 17, 1864, though he was paid for mileage and pro-rated salary. Segar presented credentials on February 17, 1865, as a United States Senator-elect to fill the vacancy in the term commencing March 4, 1863, caused by the death of Lemuel J. Bowden, but was not permitted to take his seat. In the first session of the Virginia General Assembly following passage of VIrginia's Constitution of 1869, his nephew Arthur S. Segar was one of Norfolk City's two delegates, alongside Republican Henry M. Bowden. On January 25, 1870, in the Forty-first Congress, Segar claimed an at-large ninth seat for Virginia in the U.S. House, but was not seated. The recent Virginia constitutional convention had asserted the ninth seat,Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, (1774‚Äì2005), \\"Official Annotated Membership Roster by State with Vacancy and Special Election Information for the 41st Congress\\". but Congress only allowed eight seats to Virginia, since its apportionment of eleven seats had been reduced by the three seats assigned to the new state of West Virginia in 1863. Segar was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for election in 1876 to the Forty-fifth Congress. Later life After the Civil War, Segar went bankrupt, as did diehard rebel Jefferson Sinclair, a prominent landowner in Hampton who often cross-signed notes with Segar. During the administration of President Rutherford B. Hayes, Segar received an appointment to the Spanish Claims Commission, serving from 1877 to 1880. Segar died on a steamer while en route from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington, D.C., on April 30, 1880. He was interred in St. John's Cemetery, Hampton, Virginia, where his widow joined him eight years later. His grateful nephew, A.S. Segar would continue his uncle's legal and political legacy in the Hampton Roads area, becoming a schoolteacher, then a lawyer and Conservative Party politician who represented Norfolk for a single term in the Virginia General Assembly (1869-1870), and later won election as the Commonwealth Attorney for Elizabeth City County and served eight years before resuming his private legal practice representing the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad and the Newport News Shipyard, among prominent clients.

Burgess.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) p. 534 In the election of 1882, Mayo ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives to represent Virginia's first district. The vote was close‚Äîhe was first declared the loser, then the winner and then the loser again. Incumbent Democrat George T. Garrison of Accomack County according to the initial tally won 70 more votes than challenger Mayo. The Readjuster-controlled State Board of Canvassers then threw out the votes of Gloucester County and Hog Island (Garrison had received all 14 votes from Hog Island). Thus Mayo led by a single vote: 10,505‚Äì10,504. (A third candidate, Republican John W. Woltz, received only 168 votes.) Mayo was seated and served from March 4, 1883 until March 20, 1884. However, Garrison refused to concede, and the House Committee of Elections then chose to accept the Gloucester County and Hog Island ballots, so the House voted unanimously to seat Garrison halfway through the term. Mayo then returned to Virginia's Northern Neck and resumed his legal practice. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to Congress in 1884, but again won election to the House of Delegates in 1885 and 1887.Leonard pp. 542, 546 Family life Robert M.

The technology was developed and tested onshore and offshore in Fremantle, Western Australia. In early 2015 a CETO 5 production installation was commissioned and connected to the grid. all the electricity generated is being purchased to contribute towards the power requirements of HMAS Stirling naval base at Garden Island, Western Australia. Some of the energy will also be used directly to desalinate water. CETO is designed to be a simple and robust wave technology. CETO is claimed to be the only ocean-tested wave-energy technology globally that is both fully submerged and generates power and or desalinated water onshore. The CETO technology has been independently verified by Energies Nouvelles (EDF EN) and the French naval contractor DCNS.Carnegie Wave Energy, 2011. Available from [19 May 2011] Technology=CETO 5 The name is inspired by the Greek ocean goddess, Ceto. the system distinguishes itself from other wave-energy devices in being fully submerged. Submerged buoys are moved by the ocean swell, driving pumps that pressurize seawater delivered ashore by a subsea pipeline. Once onshore, the high-pressure seawater is used to drive hydro-electric turbines, generating electricity. The high-pressure seawater can also be used to supply a reverse osmosis desalination plant, producing freshwater. Some historic conventional seawater desalination plants are large emitters of greenhouse gases; this is due to the amount of energy required to drive the grid-connected pumps that deliver the high-pressure seawater to reverse osmosis membranes for the removal of the salt.Desalination, 2010. Available from <> [10 May 2011] CETO 6 CETO 6 is in development, and differs from CETO 5 in having a larger buoy, with the electrical generation onboard and the power being transferred to shore by an electrical cable. The buoy is designed for deeper water and further offshore than CETO 5.  Commercial demonstration and independent verification of results  On completion of Stage 1 of the Perth Wave Energy Project, Carnegie enlisted Frazer-Nash Consultancy Ltd to verify the CETO 3 unit's measured and modelled capacity. During the CETO 3 in- ocean trial, Frazer‚ÄìNash verified the peak measured capacity to be 78 kW and delivered a sustained pressure of 77 bar, above what is required for seawater reverse-osmosis desalination. Projects= Perth Wave Energy Project (PWEP)  Stage 1, already been completed, involved the manufacture, deployment and testing of a single commercial-scale autonomous CETO unit off Garden Island. For this stage, the CETO unit was not connected to shore but was stand-alone and autonomous, providing telemetric data back to shore for confirmation and independent verification of the unit's performance. Stage 2 involved the design, construction, deployment and operational performance evaluation of a grid-connected commercial-scale wave-energy demonstration project, also at Garden Island. The facility consisted of multiple submerged CETO units in an array, subsea pipeline(s) to shore, hydraulic conditioning equipment, and an onshore power generation facility. In early 2015 a multi megawatt system was connected to the grid, with all the electricity being bought to power HMAS Stirling naval base. Two fully submerged buoys which are anchored to the seabed, transmit the energy from the ocean swell through hydraulic pressure onshore; to drive a generator for electricity, and also to produce fresh water. a third buoy is planned for installation.  La R√©union Wave Energy Project  The R√©union Island project is a joint venture between Carnegie and EDF Energies Nouvelles. The project will initially consist of the deployment of a single, autonomous commercial scale unit (stage 1) which will be followed by a 2MW plant (stage 2) and a further expansion of the project to a nominal 15MW installed capacity (stage 3). stage 1 has been awarded $5M of French government funding. A cable between a buoy and the seabed anchored hydraulic pump snapped in a CETO 4 prototype installation in January 2014. The buoy was swept away during Cyclone Bejisa, which also led to a fatality and widespread damage on R√©union Island. The design was an earlier iteration than the Perth CETO 5 installation and lacked the quick release mechanism which was included in CETO 5.  Ireland Wave Energy Project  Carnegie has signed a formal funding and collaboration agreement with the Irish Government's Sustainable Energy Association (SEAI) for a ‚Ç¨150,000 project to evaluate potential CETO wave sites in Ireland and develop a site-specific conceptual design. The project is 50% funded by the SEAI and 50% by Carnegie, and forms the first phase of detailed design for a potential 5 MW commercial demonstration project in Irish waters. The project was under way in 2011 and is being managed through Carnegie's Irish subsidiary, CETO Wave Energy Ireland Limited.

Other wave energy and CETO characteristics * Wave energy is a renewable, high availability source of power. * About 60% of the human population lives within 60 kilometers of a coastline, minimising transmission issues. * Since water is about 800 times denser than air, the energy density of waves exceeds that of wind and solar, increasing the amount of energy available for harvesting. * Waves are predictable in advance, making it easier to predict mismatches between supply and demand. * CETO does not stand for Cylindrical Energy Transfer Oscillating unit ‚Äì a popular misconception. The name refers to Ceto, a Greek sea goddess. * CETO sits underwater, moored to the sea floor, with minimal visual impact above the water. In practice, buoys have been fitted with warning lights on a mast above water. * CETO units operate in deep water, away from breaking waves, meaning there is minimal impact on popular surfing sites. * CETO units are designed to operate in harmony with the waves. This means, apart from anchor points, there is no need for massive steel and concrete support structures to be built. * CETO units act like artificial reefs, because of the way they attract marine life.

He would have three younger brothers as well as three sisters, and inherited Honeywood, which he would operate until his death.Louise Pecquet du Bellet, Some Prominent Virginia Families, Volumes 1-2, (Genealogical Publishing Com, 1976) p. 94, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=wEL-bI- QNmYC&pg;=PA93&lpg; As was customary for gentleman of his class, Edward Colston received a private education, then was sent to New Jersey for higher studies.

He first married Jane Marshall of Fauquier County, but she died in 1815.Evans p. 225 In 1825 Colston met and married Jane Brockenbrough of Richmond, and they had three sons and four daughters. After this Edward Colston's death, all their sons (Raleigh T. Colston, Edward Colston Jr. and William Brockenbrough Colston) would become Confederate States Army officers, after recruiting the Hedgesville Blues (which became part of the Stonewall Brigade, 2nd Virginia Infantry). Only Raleigh died in the war (one of the few casualties of the Battle of Mine Run in 1863); William followed his father's path into Berkeley County politics and the junior Edward became a lawyer politician in Cincinnati, Ohio. His nephew Raleigh E. Colston (son of his brother Dr. Raleigh T. Colston) would become a controversial Confederate general and also survived the Civil War.Evans p. 216 Career Edward Colston was admitted to the bar and practiced in what later became the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, although the local Berkeley County judges chose fellow lawyer, soldier and politician Elisha Boyd as the local prosecutor (and he would serve four decades). Like Boyd, Colston served in the War of 1812, volunteering as a private in Charles Faulkner's artillery company (which helped defend Norfolk and Portsmouth against British land and naval forces). He later received a lieutenant's commission in an infantry regiment. Berkeley County voters elected Colston to the Virginia House of Delegates several times. He first served from 1812 until 1814, then from 1816 to 1817, before winning election to the Fifteenth Congress (March 4, 1817 ‚Äì March 3, 1819) with 64.35% of the vote, defeating Democratic-Republicans Daniel Morgan and Robert Bailey. Colston did not seek re-election but returned to Honeywood because his father needed help handing the family's plantations. In the 1820 census, this Edward Colston owned 13 slaves and also farmed with the assistance of one free black boy.1820 U.S. Federal Census for Middletown, Berkeley County, Virginia p. 11 of 18 His father owned more slaves.

After his father's death in 1823, Berkeley County voters again elected Edward Colston as one of their representatives in the House of Delegates, so he served from 1823 to 1828, and then from 1833 to 1835. He lost an attempt to return to the U.S. Congress in 1825 to Democratic-Republican William Armstrong of Hampshire County. Berkeley County voters also elected Colston their High Sheriff in 1844 and 1845. In 1835, Colston built a dam to create slackwater on the upper Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and power a mill. The mill burned several times in the ensuing decades, and the dam also became a strategic site in the American Civil War. It was superseded by a paper mill circa 1900, but the dam exists today as Honeywood Dam (on the National Register of Historic Places and within the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park).

The self-imposed title is derived from previous behaviour at away games where the single-minded involvement in violence against overwhelming odds could be described as suicidal. The name became synonymous with the group during the early 1980s. The Suicide Squad officially disbanded in 2011 when 12 members of the Suicide Squad received prison sentences totalling 32 years, following a high-profile incident with local rivals Blackburn Rovers in 2009. The club and its firm have longstanding rivalries with Blackburn Rovers, Millwall, Plymouth Argyle, Preston North End, Stockport County, and Yeovil Town. History Out of the terrace wars of the 1980s emerged a gang known as the Suicide Squad in a period which also saw Burnley's fall from the First Division to the Fourth Division and the threat of non-league football. This meant that the calculated, disciplined, organised operation that struck fear into opposing fans clashed with just about every rival mob in the country and became world-renowned as one of the fiercest and most dangerous in Britain. Although partially disbanded, a new more menacing group began to emerge. This group, considerably younger, named themselves the Burnley Youth. They would remain associated with the older hooligan group known as the Suicide Squad, but refused to abide by the rules of the game. This group were more determined and less affected by the police tactics, than their older colleagues. The police began to receive intelligence reports from members of the Suicide Squad who were genuinely concerned that their younger brethren were \\"out of control\\" and were travelling to away matches with weapons. The level of violence and the circumstances surrounding these incidents strongly supported these concerns. In November 2002, Burnley police and the football club jointly established Operation Fixture, a scheme aimed at tackling football hooliganism in and around the club's stadium, Turf Moor with more bans, more arrests and quicker convictions. The scheme also aimed to target racists, with the example of a Burnley fan having given a Nazi salute during a League Cup match against Tottenham Hotspur. On 7 December 2002, a 17-year-old Nottingham Forest fan was killed when Burnley fans attacked Forest fans in Burnley town centre. Two days later, a 19-year-old Burnley fan, Andrew McNee, a member of the so-called Suicide Youth Squad was arrested and charged with murder. He was sentenced to seven years in youth custody after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter in July 2003. He was also banned from football matches for ten years. When passing sentence, the trial judge commented that the attack had happened, \\"for absolutely no reason, other than he supported a different football team and had the temerity to visit a public house the defendant and others believed he should have kept away from\\"; adding that football hooliganism was a \\"scourge on the sport\\" and said the courts should make it clear that anyone involved in violence would face harsh sentences. McNee was released from prison in 2006. Within weeks however, he was fined ¬£200 after pleading guilty to breaching his ten-year football banning order. On 22 July 2006 police caught him outside Turf Moor when Burnley were playing Bolton Wanderers, Burnley's first home game since McNee had been released from prison. In July 2007, one of the founding members of the Suicide Squad, Andrew Porter, who wrote a book about his exploits with the firm was coming to the end of a three-year ban from attending both England and domestic matches. However, Burnley police applied for a fresh banning order with the start of the new season only weeks away under Operation Fixture which had been introduced in 2002. In May 2009, another founder member of the Suicide Squad, Philip Holmes, was banned for a further three years from English and Welsh football grounds. The ban follows a steady stream of incidents since Holmes' original ban expired in February 2007, including being the central figure in games against Stoke City and Sheffield United in the 2008‚Äì09 season. The Suicide Squad featured in the television documentary series The Real Football Factories which was first shown on the Bravo Television channel. On 18 October 2009, following the first Premier League derby between Blackburn Rovers and Burnley, members of the Suicide Squad clashed at the Station public house in the Cherry Tree area of the town in a riot described by police officers as \\"like something out of Braveheart\\". Fifteen months later, twelve members of the Suicide Squad received prison sentences totalling 32 years along with lengthy banning orders. Andrew Porter, aged 44, was discovered to have organised the riot, receiving the heaviest sentence; a five-year prison sentence along with a ten-year banning order. Porter had written a book ‚Äî Suicide Squad: The Inside Story of a Football Firm ‚Äî about his experiences as a football hooligan. ReferencesFurther reading * Porter, Andrew (2005).

Largely self-educated, Sheffey pursued classical studies. Apprenticed as a shoemaker in his father's shop, he spent his leisure hours observing nature and the mysteries of astronomy; upon attaining his majority, he walked to Winchester, Virginia and began plying his trade until he built up his resources. He moved to Wytheville, Virginia, in 1791. He worked at his trade, all the while he attained a reputation for quick wit and immense intellect. Finally, he was received as a student into the office of Alexander Smyth, Esq. an eminent lawyer in that part of the state, and afterwards commander of the northern army during the War of 1812 . He was admitted to the bar July 1, 1802, and commenced the practice of his profession in Wytheville. He moved to Staunton, Virginia where he continued the practice of law.

During the American Civil War, although some of his sons enlisted on opposing sides and West Virginia was created, he continued to serve as a federal judge in Union-held territory.CongBioM000352  Early and family life  Born near Pearisburg in Giles County, Virginia in 1795 to Elisha McComas (1770 - 1849) and his wife Ann French McComas (1776 - 1850), McComas was descended from long-established Virginia families who had helped fight in the American Revolutionary War. He had several brothers and sisters. McComas attended local private schools, then Emory and Henry College, in Emory, Virginia. He married twice. His first wife, Mildred Ward McComas (1797 - 1853) bore at least six sons and two daughters who survived to adulthood: Elisha Wesley McComas (1822 - 1890), William Wirt McComas (1826 - 1862), Valeria McComas McComas (1827 - 1854), Hamilton Calhoun McComas (1831 - 1883), Rufus French McComas (1833 - 1891), Benjamin Jefferson McComas (1836 - 1894) and Irene Octavia McComas McKendree (1843 - 1913). After his first wife's death, he married Sarah V. Wentz Derton (1811 - 1880), who survived him.https://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=53948947 Career After graduating from college, McComas became Methodist minister, as well as read law and was admitted to the Virginia bar. He moved his young family westward in Virginia along the Midland Trail, establishing his own farm and legal practice in Cabell County near the confluence of the Mud and Guyandotte Rivers. Political career McComas served one term as member of the Virginia state senate (a part-time position) in 1830‚Äì1833. Elected as a Jacksonian to the Twenty-third Congress, McComas won re-election, but as an Anti-Jacksonian, to the Twenty-fourth Congress (March 4, 1833 ‚Äì March 3, 1837). He then resumed his farming and legal career, and continued his ministry. Although his former district had been eliminated after the post-1840 census redistricting, McComas again ran for Congress in 1848. He lost, and so did not attend the Thirty-first Congress. His eldest son, Elisha W. McComas (1822-1890), who had served in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War, won election as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in the following decade, but resigned because of how Governor John S. Wise handled the aftermath of John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. Elisha McComas then moved to Chicago, Illinois to continue his legal practice, then moved again to Kansas. Meanwhile, as tensions grew concerning slavery, especially after the 1860 U. S. Presidential Election, Cabell County voters elected William McComas as one of their delegates to the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861. Although McComas consistently voted against the secession ordinance, it passed and was approved in a statewide referendum. Some northwestern Virginia delegates then held the Wheeling Convention to prevent secession and eventually established the Restored Government of Virginia and the new state. However, McComas neither attended, nor participated in West Virginia's creation. His family divided. His second son, Dr. William Wirt McComas, who had enlisted in the Confederate artillery, died on April 19, 1862. On September 4, 1862, his third son, Hamilton Calhoun McComas (1831-1883, and another lawyer) enlisted in the Union Army in Illinois, and served for several months before resigning. His youngest son, Benjamin McComas (1836-1894), enlisted in the 30th Virginia Sharpshooters, a Confederate unit, but survived the war. William McComas continued to serve as judge of the United States district court during the Civil War, residing in the portion which remained loyal to the Union (first as the Restored Government of Virginia and then the new state of West Virginia beginning in June 1863). Death and legacy McComas died on his farm near Barboursville, Virginia (now West Virginia) on June 3, 1865.

It was founded by Ken Cheppaikode while he was living in Seattle, Washington, in 1999. He bought Green Noise record store in Portland, Oregon, in 2005 and then ran the label from there. Cheppaikode started the label while working for Mordam Records, distributor of many punk labels and Maximumrocknroll magazine. Naturally, Mordam also distributed Dirtnap's early releases. However, immediately before Mordam merged with Lumberjack Distribution in 2005, Cheppaikode chose to switch to RedEye Distribution. In 2006, Dirtnap agreed to an exclusive licensing deal with Railer Entertainment Music Licensing which immediately led to the inclusion of several Dirtnap bands on the soundtrack of the PlayStation 3 game, Skate. Dirtnap originally focused on regional talent, releasing a number of local 7-inch singles and splits albums. It has since expanded its focus, attracting attention in the early 2000s when it was releasing records by The Briefs, the Epoxies, and The Exploding Hearts. In 2009, the label signed The White Wires from Ottawa. Other notable releases once Dirtnap expanded its focus include several records by groups such as The Marked Men from Denton, Texas and The Ergs! from New Brunswick, New Jersey. In early 2007, Cheppaikode began a vinyl-only sub label called Green Noise, named after the record store, that retains the local focus Dirtnap used to have.

He was perhaps best known for being the host of Any Questions? from its inception in 1948 until 1967. Biography Grisewood was educated at Radley College, and later at Magdalen College, University of Oxford. He first worked for the BBC as an announcer in 1929. In 1932, the Daily Express published his name, along with those of several of his fellow announcers; before that date the BBC had required them to maintain on-air anonymity. In 1937, he was the commentator for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the first-ever BBC live outside television broadcast. The BBC had only taken delivery of its first Outside Broadcast unit which consisted of several vans two days before the Coronation. Despite no-one having any experience of operating it was placed at the top of Constitution Hill to catch the Royal Carriage as it went past. A message was sent to the King asking him to give a special wave for the camera. Grisewood was the commentator though as the number of television sets in homes was still very small, probably less than 1,000, his audience would be minute. He would recount how just as the Royal carriage appeared in the distance, all the equipment failed. The engineer in charge swore, gave it a hefty kick and it all came to life again so the day was saved. He commentated on the first televised broadcast of a tennis match at Wimbledon, on 21 June 1937. In 1938, he hosted the first UK game show, the 15-minute Spelling Bee.Spelling Bee at UKgameshows.com Grisewood was a good cricketer, and played one first-class match: for Worcestershire against Oxford University at The University Parks in June 1908. Although Worcestershire won the game by the wide margin of 332 runs, Grisewood made no significant personal contribution to his side's victory: he scored 1 and 6 not out, and neither bowled nor held a catch. Despite having played against his university at first-class level, he never appeared for it. He continued to work as a freelance broadcaster well into the 1960s. Grisewood was born in Daylesford, Worcestershire; he died aged 84 in Grayshott, Hampshire.

It is also known as \\"Pao Fu Zi\\" or \\"Pao Hu Zhi\\" () in different dialects. Description These cards originated from Leshan, Sichuan during the middle of the Qing dynasty and then spread outwards to other parts of southern China. The special deck has two series of cards numbered from one to ten. One series of cards features numbers written in an \\"ordinary\\" style (), while the other series of cards has numbers written in a \\"formal\\" style (). Every card is quadrupled to bring the total to 80 cards. Numbers 2, 7 and 10 are printed in red, and all others are printed in black. Some decks may have extra cards that act as wild cards. 2-7-10 2-7-10 () is the standard game played with these cards. It is a draw-and-discard type game like Mahjong and Rummy. Usually there are only three players in each game. The winner is the player who reaches 18 points first. Suits ‚Äî There are two suits: big and small () differentiated by both colours and their characters/patterns. The big suit is red and the small suit is black. The cards belonging to the big suit always carry three points more than those of the small suit if the meld (see below) carries points at all. Melds ‚Äî When a player discards a card, any other player may \\"call\\" for it in order to complete a meld (a certain set of three or four cards) in their own hands. When a meld is declared through a discard, the player must state the type of meld to be declared and place the meld face up. The player must then discard a card (with the exception that they are making the second meld of four of a kind), and play continues to the left. The disadvantage of doing this is that the player must now expose the completed meld to the other players, giving them information on the availability of cards left in the deck. * Du√¨ () meaning to make use of a pair) ‚Äî A Du√¨ is a set of three identical cards. If a du√¨ is made by calling a card, a big du√¨ carries three points whilst a small dui carries one point. If it is made in a player's hand during the initial drawing, then they carry six and three points respectively. * KƒÅi () ‚Äî A KƒÅi is a set of four identical cards. A kƒÅi in the big suit carries nine points and six points in the small suit if exposed; or they both gain three extra points for being concealed in a player's hand. If a player is forming a second set of kƒÅi all cards (both concealed in their hands and exposed on the table) considered, they should not discard any cards for that particular turn or they will not be able to win the game. * Chƒ´ () ‚Äî A Chƒ´ is a meld of three suited tiles in sequence or any three cards of the same number. They do not carry any points unless they are formed by the numbers two, seven and ten. When a chƒ´ is formed by calling, any melds that contains the card being called need to be exposed to other players as well. * 2-7-10 The meld 2-7-10 is a special type of chƒ´ which can only be formed if they are of the same suit. A black or small 2-7-10 carries three points when exposed, and six if not; a red or big set carries six or nine points depending on its visibility to other players. * Jiang () ‚Äî The pair, while not a meld (and thus cannot be declared or formed with a discard, except if completing the pair completes the hand), is the final component to the standard hand. It consists of any two identical cards. Gameplay ‚Äî The game starts by a chosen player (if the first game) or the winner (of the previous game) drawing the first two cards. Each player then draws two cards until the lead has 20 cards in their hand and announces the end of the drawing phase by drawing one last card and discarding the first card. So each player has 20 cards to start with.
