Life The son of Endymion Walker, he was baptised at St Kerrian's, Exeter, 21 January 1674. His father was mayor of Exeter in 1682. On 19 November 1691 he matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, he was admitted Fellow on 3 July 1695, and became full Fellow on 4 July 1696 (vacated 1700). On 16 January 1698 he was ordained deacon by Sir Jonathan Trelawny, then bishop of Exeter; he graduated B.A. on 4 July, and was instituted to the rectory of St Mary Major, Exeter, on 22 August 1698. On 13 October 1699 he graduated M.A. (incorporated at Cambridge, 1702). By diploma of 7 December 1714 Walker was made D.D. at Oxford, and on 20 December he was appointed to a prebend at Exeter. On 17 October 1720 he was instituted to the rectory of Upton Pyne, Devon, on the presentation of Hugh Stafford, and here he ended his days. He died in June 1747, and was buried (20 June) in his churchyard, near the east end of the north aisle of the church. He had married at Exeter Cathedral, on 17 November 1704, Martha Brooking, who died on 12 September 1748, aged 67. Sufferings of the Clergy The publication of Edmund Calamy's Account (1702‚Äì1713), on the nonconformist ministers silenced and ejected after the 1660 English Restoration, suggested to Charles Goodall and to Walker a similar work on the deprived and sequestered clergy. Goodall advertised for information in the London Gazette; finding that Walker was engaged on a similar task, he passed on the materials he had collected. Walker gathered particulars by help of query sheets, circulated in various dioceses; those for Exeter and Canterbury were printed by Calamy.Church and Dissenters Compar'd, 1719, pp. 4, 10. Among his helpers was Mary Astell. His manuscript collections were presented to the Bodleian Library in 1754 by Walker's son William, a druggist in Exeter; the lost ‚ÄòMinutes of the Bury Presbyterian Classis‚Äô (Chetham Society, 1896) were edited from the transcript in the Walker manuscripts. Walker's book Sufferings of the Clergy appeared in 1714,An Attempt towards recovering an Account of the Numbers and Sufferings of the Clergy of the Church of England, Heads of Colleges, Fellows, Scholars, &c.;, who were Sequester'd, Harass'd, &c.; in the late Times of the Grand Rebellion: Occasion'd by the Ninth Chapter (now the second volume) of Dr. Calamy's Abridgment of the Life of Mr. Baxter. Together with an Examination of That Chapter. The subscription list contained over thirteen hundred names. The work consists of two parts: * a history of ecclesiastical affairs from 1640 to 1660, the object being to show that the ejection of the Puritans at the Restoration was a just reprisal for their actions when in power; * a catalogue of the deprived clergy with particulars of their sufferings. It does not profess to give biographies; the list of names adds up to 3,334 (Calamy's ejected add up to 2,465), but if all the names of the suffering clergy could be recovered, Walker thinks they might reach ten thousand (i. 200). A third part, announced in the title-page as an examination of Calamy's work, was deferred (pref. p. li), and never appeared; Calamy is plentifully attacked in the preface. Walker tried to distinguish doubtful from authenticated matter, and mentions the charges brought against some of his sufferers; but his tone was counter-productive to his argument. The work was hailed by Thomas Bisse in a sermon before the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy (6 December 1716) as a ‚Äòbook of martyrology‚Äô and ‚Äòa record which ought to be kept in every sanctuary.‚Äô John Lewis disparaged it as ‚Äòa farrago of false and senseless legends.‚Äô It was criticised, from the nonconformist side, by John Withers (died 1729) of Exeter, in an appendix to his ‚ÄòReply,‚Äô 1714, to two pamphlets by John Agate, an Exeter clergyman; and by Calamy in ‚ÄòThe Church and the Dissenters Compar'd as to Persecution,‚Äô 1719. An ‚ÄòEpitome‚Äô of the ‚ÄòAttempt‚Äô was published at Oxford, 1862.

Life and works=Youth (1863‚Äì1900) Caricature of various individuals playing roulette by Sem, 1920 Georges Goursat was born and raised in an upper-middle-class family from P√©rigueux. The wealth inherited from his father at the age of 21 allowed him to sustain a gilded youth. In 1888 he self published in P√©rigueux his first three albums of caricatures, signing some as \\"SEM\\" (Figure, left), allegedly as a tribute to Am√©d√©e de No√© who signed his caricatures for Le Monde illustr√© as \\"Cham\\". From 1890 to 1898, he settled for a few years in Bordeaux. During this period, he published more albums and his first press caricatures in and discovered the work of Leonetto Cappiello. His style matured, becoming both simpler and more precise. During the same period, he made trips to Paris. In 1891, he designed two posters printed in the workshop of Jules Ch√©ret (Figure, right) for the singer . He published his first caricatures of artists in L'Illustration () and Le Rire (Paulus, Polin and Yvette Guilbert). From 1898 to 1900, he lived in Marseille. During this stay, he met Jean Lorrain who convinced him to live in Paris. Caricature women on a boat being sailed by a sailor by Sem, 1925 Belle √âpoque (1900‚Äì1914) Goursat arrived in Paris in March 1900, at the time of the opening of the Universal Exposition. He picked horse races as his way of entry in high society. In June, three months after his arrival, he self-published a new album, Le Turf, with caricatures of many prominent Parisian socialites (Marquess Boni de Castellane, Prince Trubetskoy, Count Clermont-Tonnerre, Baron Alphonse and Gustave de Rothschild, Polaire). The success of this album made him famous overnight. In October of the same year, he published another album, Paris-Trouville, with the same success. Nine others followed until 1913. In 1904, Goursat received the L√©gion d'honneur. In 1909, he exhibited with the painter Auguste Roubille, first in Paris, then in Monte Carlo and London. a diorama, composed of hundreds of wooden figurines \\"of all the merely Paris celebrities\\". World War I (1914‚Äì1918) Aged over 50 at the start of World War I, Goursat was not drafted. He nevertheless involved himself as a war correspondent for Le Journal. Some of his rather \\"chauvinistic\\" articles had an \\"enormous impact\\". Ten were published in 1917 in Un p√©kin sur le front. Two others were incorporated in 1923 in another book, La Ronde de Nuit. In 1916 and 1918 Goursat published two albums of Croquis de Guerre (War sketches). Their style is completely different from his previous work. He also designed posters for war bonds. Ann√©es Folles (1918‚Äì1934) After the war, Goursat came back to the kind of caricatures that made him famous. In 1919, he published Le Grand Monde √† l'envers (High Society upside down). Around 1923, he published 3 albums under the general title of Le Nouveau Monde (The New World). In 1923, he was made an officer of the L√©gion d'honneur. In 1929, he was severely impoverished by the economic crisis. After a heart attack in 1933, he died in 1934.

William Pennoyer was involved in the foundation of free \\"Pennoyer's Schools\\" in the village of Pulham St Mary, Norfolk and at Hay-on-Wye, Brecknockshire (now Powys).

Harvard University  In his will, Pennoyer left a farm in Pulham St Mary to provide, from its income, funds for stipends for two Fellows and two Scholars at Harvard College. Preference was to go to descendants of his younger brother Robert, who lived in Massachusetts, and to candidates from New Haven Colony. By the late 19th century, agricultural depression in England had reduced the annual income and steps were taken to sell \\"Asten's Farm\\", as it had become known. In 1903 US$4,030 was realised and added to the Pennoyer Scholarship Fund. The scholarship continues to be available to qualifying applicants.

She later described it as a \\"glorified junk shop\\". In April 2011, there were 41 shops and concessions in the UK, two in the Republic of Ireland, eleven in Japan and three in Korea. Less than three years later there were 136 outlets, including a flagship store on Piccadilly next to Fortnum & Mason, and four stores in China. Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs programme, she described her shops as provoking a 'Marmite reaction': \\"People either love it and want a little bit of it very much, or want to stab us.\\" The company's profits jumped more than 60 per cent from ¬£2.9m to ¬£4.6m in the year to March 2009. Sales rose to ¬£31.3m during the period, compared with ¬£19.3m the year before, partly due to new store openings. In 2010, Cath Kidston sold a majority stake of the company to private equity investors TA Associates, retaining a minority stake and remaining the company's Creative Director. In October 2016, TA Associates sold its stake to Baring Private Equity Asia for an undisclosed amount. The transaction saw chairman Paul Mason replaced by William Flanz, former chairman and executive of Gucci Group. In April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, the company underwent a \\"pre-pack\\" administration. This resulted in the closure of all 60 UK stores on 21 April, with the loss of over 900 jobs.

Splitting is another defense mechanism prevalent among individuals with narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder ‚Äîseeing people and situations in black and white terms, either as all bad or all good. A narcissistic defense, with the disorder's typical over-valuation of the self, can appear at any stage of development.Wilber K., Engler J., Brown D. (1986). Transformations of Consciousness: Conventional and Contemplative Perspective of Development, Boston: New Science Library, New York City, NY, p. 150 Defence sequences The narcissist typically runs through a sequence of defenses to discharge painful feelings until he or she finds one that works:Thomas D Narcissism: Behind the Mask (2010) # unconscious repression # conscious denial # distortion (including exaggeration and minimization), rationalisation and lies # psychological projection (blaming somebody else) # enlisting the help of one or more of his or her codependent friends who will support his or her distorted view. Freudians Sigmund Freud Sigmund Freud did not focus specifically on narcissistic defenses,Elsa Schmid-Kitsikis, \\"Narcissistic Defenses\\" but did note in On Narcissism how \\"even great criminals and humorists, as they are represented in literature, compel our interest by the narcissistic consistency with which they manage to keep away from their ego anything that would diminish it\\".Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11), p. 83 Freud saw narcissistic regression as a defensive answer to object loss ‚Äì denying the loss of an important object by way of a substitutive identification with it.Freud, Metapsychology, p. 258 Freud also considered social narcissism as a defence mechanism, apparent when communal identifications produce irrational panics at perceived threats to 'Throne and Altar' or 'Free Markets',Sigmund Freud, On Sexuality (PFL 7) p. 352 or in English over-reaction to any questioning of the status and identity of William Shakespeare.James Shapiro, Contested Will (2010) p. 344 Fenichel Otto Fenichel considered that \\"identification, performed by means of introjection, is the most primitive form of relationship to objects\\" a primitive mechanism only used \\"if the ego's function of reality testing is severely damaged by a narcissistic regression.\\"Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946), pp. 147‚Äì48 Fenichel also highlighted \\"eccentrics who have more or less succeeded in regaining the security of primary narcissism and who feel 'Nothing can happen to me'....[failing] to give up the archaic stages of repudiating displeasure and to turn toward reality\\".Fenichel, p. 510 Lacan Jacques Lacan, following out Freud's view of the ego as the result of identifications,Elisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (Oxford 1997), p. 111 came to consider the ego itself as a narcissistic defence, driven by what he called \\"the 'narcissistic passion' ...in the coming-into-being (devenir) of the subject\\".Jacques Lacan, √âcrits: A Selection (London 1997), pp. 21‚Äì22 Kleinians Melanie Klein, emphasised projective identification in narcissism, and the manic defence against becoming aware of the damage done to objects in this way.James S. Grotstein, \\"Foreword\\", in Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 1993), p. xii For Kleinians, at the core of manic defences in narcissism stood what Hanna Segal called \\"a triad of feelings‚Äîcontrol, triumph and contempt\\".Hanna Segal, Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein (London 1964), p. 70 Rosenfeld Herbert Rosenfeld looked at the role of omnipotence, combined with projective identification, as a narcissistic means of defending against awareness of separation between ego and object.Jean- Michel Quinodoz, The Taming of Solitude (2004), p. 168 Object relations theory In the wake of Klein, object relations theory, including particularly the American schools of Otto Kernberg and Heinz Kohut has explored narcissistic defences through analysis of such mechanisms as denial, projective identification, and extreme idealization.Schmid-Kitsikis Kernberg emphasised the role of the splitting apart introjections, and identifications of opposing qualities, as a cause of ego weakness.Otto F. Kernberg, Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism (London 1990) p. 29 Kohut too stressed the fact in narcissism \\"vertical splits are between self-structures (among others)‚Äî'I am grand' and 'I am wretched'‚Äîwith very little communication between them\\".Kohut, quoted in Josephine Klein, Our Need for Others (London 1994) p. 222 Neville Symington however placed greater weight on the way \\"a person dominated by narcissistic currents...survives through being able to sense the emotional tone of the other...wearing the cloaks of others\\";Symington, pp. 52, 88 while for Spotnitz the key element is that the narcissist turns feelings in upon the self in narcissistic defense.James G. Fennessy, \\"The Narcissistic Defense\\" Positive defenses Kernberg emphasised the positive side to narcissistic defenses,Elsa Ronningstam, Disorders of Narcissism (1997) p. 128 while Kohut also stressed the necessity in early life for narcissistic positions to succeed each other in orderly maturational sequences.Heinz Kohut, The Analysis of the Self (Madison 1971) p. 215 Others like Symington would maintain that \\"it is a mistake to split narcissism into positive and negative...we do not get positive narcissism without self-hatred\\".Symington, pp. 58, 113 Stigmatising attitude to psychiatric illness Arikan found that a stigmatising attitude to psychiatric patients is associated with narcissistic defences. 21st century The twenty-first century has seen a distinction drawn between cerebral and somatic narcissists ‚Äì the former building up their self-sense through intellectualism, the latter through an obsession with their bodies,Simon Crompton, All about Me (London 2007) pp. 28‚Äì29 as with the woman who, in bad faith, invests her sense of freedom only in being an object of beauty for others.Jack Reynolds, Understanding Existentialism (2006) p. 143 Literary parallels * Sir Philip Sidney is said to have seen poetry in itself as a narcissistic defense.Jonathan Goldberg, Voice Terminal Echo (1986) p. 47 * Jean-Paul Sartre's aloof, detached protagonists have been seen as crude narcissists who preserve their sense of self only by petrifying it into solid form.J.

Built in 1812 to the design of James Elmes as a proprietary chapel, the octagonal white-brick \\"evangelical preaching house\\" reflects the early 19th-century ideals of the Church of England's evangelical wing before High church movements such as the Cambridge Camden Society changed ideas on church design. The Diocese of Chichester declared it redundant in 1973. Although worship no longer takes place in the building, its theatre-like design has made it a popular venue for concerts and musical events. The church is a Grade I Listed building. History Chichester, the county town of West Sussex, is an ancient settlement at the junction of several Roman and medieval roads. Roman walls encircle the heart of the city, which is divided into quadrants by straight streets with a market at the centre. Its cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of Chichester, makes Chichester a major ecclesiastical centre, as well as an important commercial and administrative centre. There are ground-floor pews and more in the galleries above. The church has a very modest altar. Within the city walls there were eight medieval or older parish churches, including the 13th-century All Saints-in-the-Pallant, St Andrew Oxmarket and St Olave's. The southeastern quarter of the city centre, site of an ancient friary, was mostly developed in the 18th century and became known as New Town. It lacked an Anglican church until the early 19th century. At that time, a combination of urban growth throughout Sussex, the challenge posed by the rise of Protestant Nonconformism, and new ideas about the style of Anglican worship‚Äîwhich were closely linked with different styles of architecture‚Äî\\"gave rise to an unprecedented wave of churchbuilding\\". Many were funded by the government (by way of the Church Building Act), diocesan organisations and national societies; but in some areas, particularly Sussex, private fundraising was a popular alternative method of getting churches built. The proprietary system involved the purchase of shares in the church by private individuals, who received in exchange a \\"sitting\\" (the right to own a pew). The shareholders, known as proprietors, could use this pew for themselves and worship at the church, or sell it or rent it out. In some cases, an admission fee was levied on visitors who were not proprietors of the church. Some of the income from this process would support the curate and any clerks or other ministers. A minority of pews were free: they were kept aside for poor local worshippers. This method was followed in Chichester, where St John the Evangelist's Church was founded in 1812 by a group of trustees who wanted a church in the southeastern quadrant. They commissioned 30-year-old architect James Elmes to design the proprietary chapel. He was ill during the design and building process, so the project was overseen on his behalf by John Haviland, an architect who was at the start of his career and who later became a prominent prison designer in the United States. The chapel was built on an octagonal plan. At the time, ideas about Anglican church design were starting to split along ideological and theological lines. The High church movement demanded formality and ritual, placed central importance of the Eucharist and was less concerned about preaching; its churches reflected this by favouring the Gothic Revival architectural style and features, large central altars and lavish decoration. The Low church or Evangelical wing of Anglicanism emphasised preaching, personal belief and an absence of ritual. St John the Evangelist's Church was designed according to an \\"extreme Low church plan\\" in which an enormous central pulpit was the focus for the congregation and the altar was so insignificant that it \\"dwindled to a kind of kitchen table\\". The height and prominence of the pulpit ensured that the preacher could see all worshippers, and they could see and hear him. The church, an elongated octagon in the Classical style with some Greek Revival features, was built of white brick and cost ¬£7,000 (¬£ in ). It was opened in 1813, and served the local area for more than 160 years thereafter. It later passed into the control of the Diocese of Chichester, the local Anglican diocese; but falling attendances caused the church to be declared redundant in 1973. Three years later, it was transferred into the care of the Redundant Churches Fund‚Äînow the Churches Conservation Trust. It is still consecrated and holds occasional services. Architecture The Low church-style proprietary chapel has a very large wooden pulpit and galleries at first-floor level. St John the Evangelist's Church is a broadly Classical-style building with some Greek Revival and Egyptian Revival elements, and is characteristic of a late Georgian \\"auditory church\\" (one set up for preaching and evangelising) designed according to Low church principles. Sussex church historian David Beevers, writing in 1989, noted that \\"the survival of this typical Georgian Low-church interior from the enthusiasts of the [High church] Cambridge Camden Society [who dominated church design later in the 19th century] is surprising\\". Ian Nairn had the same view, calling its survival a mystery. The \\"severely elegant\\" and simple design is more reminiscent of a Nonconformist chapel than an Anglican church. One of the capitals on the columns supporting the gallery. Each deck of three- decker pulpit was used in a different part of the service. The exterior walls of the elongated octagonal building are of yellowish-white brick covered in parts with stucco. There are some stone dressings as well. A curious external feature is a miniature copy of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates forming a sort of cupola on the roof, and described variously as \\"preposterous\\" and \\"excellent\\". This stone structure is shaped like a cylinder and has a spherical roof set on top of an entablature held up by Corinthian-style columns. Inside is a bell cast in London in 1813 by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The entrance, in the west-facing wall, sits below a stone entablature with a stone-pilastered doorcase. Above this is a round- arched stone-dressed window with mouldings, linked to the entablature by a stone balustrade. Above the window is a stone pediment. Arched windows to a similar design are on each of the other seven walls at first-floor level. The entrance is flanked by two single-storey rooms which accommodate staircases to the first-floor galleries. Inside, the most prominent features are these galleries, which form a rectangle and are held up on Egyptian-style iron columns, and the large pulpit, which \\"towers over everything\\". The layout and these fittings \\"represent a unique survival\\" and a \\"superb example\\" of a late Georgian style which was quite common in the early 19th century, particularly in Nonconformist chapels but also in Anglican churches with a Low church character. The galleries are of American birch and are reached by staircases which have separate entrances in the single-storey wings to the side of the main entrance. Separate entrances were characteristic of churches of this era, which often required the sexes to sit apart; also, at St John the Evangelist's Church, the free pews (on the ground floor) were kept separate from those owned by the proprietors (in the galleries). The pulpit stands centrally in the nave, hiding the small chancel and sanctuary. It has been called the best surviving three-decker pulpit in Sussex. An unusual refinement of the more common two-decker structure, a three-decker allowed different parts of the service to be read from different levels according to their importance. Responses to prayers were read from the lowest deck, usually by the church clerk. The main part of the service, including prayers, came from the middle deck; and the sermon‚Äîthe most important part of a Low church service‚Äîtook place in the circular upper deck. The pulpit is free-standing on a fluted stem with a spiral motif. Like the rest of the internal fittings, it is of American birch. The three sections are now side by side, but originally they were aligned one in front of the other in a tiered formation. The church today St John the Evangelist's Church was designated a Grade I Listed building on 5 July 1950. The Diocese of Chichester declared St John the Evangelist's Church redundant on 22 June 1973. It was placed into the care of the Redundant Churches Fund (now the Churches Conservation Trust) on 17 August 1976, and is now one of five former churches in West Sussex administered by the charity; the others are at Church Norton, North Stoke, Tortington and Warminghurst. The church had a strong musical tradition, which is maintained in the 21st century by its regular use as a concert venue‚Äîespecially during the annual Chichester Festivities arts and music festival.

In Italy and America, it is economically important as one of the vectors of Pierce's Disease (Xylella fastidiosa). Etymology The genus name Philaenus comes from the Greek philein (\\"love\\"), while the species name spumarius is from the Latin spuma (\\"sparkling\\"), referring to the foam nests; the binomial Philaenus spumarius can be translated as \\"foam lover.\\" Varietas Varietas within this species include:Biolib *Philaenus spumarius var. populellus *Philaenus spumarius var. vittatus *Philaenus spumarius var. lateralis *Philaenus spumarius var. fasciatus *Philaenus spumarius var. gibbus Distribution Philaenus spumarius is quite common and widespread. The species' original distribution was restricted to the Palearctic realm. They are present in most of Europe, in North Africa, in part of Russia, in Afghanistan, and in Japan. They have also been introduced in North America.Fauna europaea This is a very eurytopic species, meaning that it can tolerate a wide range of environmental factors and exist in many different habitats (parks, meadows, gardens, etc.). It lives in almost all open land habitats and in open forests. It is absent only in very wet and very dry habitats. Clip of mating pair Identification The species reaches a body length of . Most females are slightly larger than males. In these polymorphic insects, the coloration of the body is very variable (about 20 different colors are known).Selcuk Yurtsever On the Polymorphic Meadow Spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius (L.) (Homoptera: Cercopidae) Usually, they are yellowish, brownish, or black, with brighter patches on a dark background, but also with dark markings on a lighter background.  Locomotion  The most common modes of locomotion are running and flying, but the most striking is their strong jumping ability, which is useful for escaping from predators.Jonathan Amos Garden insect is jump champion When jumping, the hind leg tarsal spines and spine hairs are embedded into the material the animal is jumping from, typically a plant, and provide the purchase needed for a lateral jump - confirmed with scanning electron micrographs. X-ray spectroscopy revealed that the darker coloured sclerotized tips of the spines, the last 6/100ths of a millimetre or so, contain zinc.Goetzke, H.H., Pattrick, J.G, and Federle, W (2019) Froghoppers jump from smooth plant surfaces by piercing them with sharp spines, PNAS, 116:(8) 3012-3017 Life cycle The seasonal nature, the phenology, of the species' life cycle varies because of the wide range of climatic conditions it can tolerate, but remains similar. In a temperate climate, the females lay eggs at the end of the summer. The eggs are laid singly or in groups (1 to 30, average 7 ) on the food plants of the larvae. Egg-laying is triggered by a single female, which can produce up to 350‚Äì400 eggs. In unfavorable climatic periods, froghoppers can survive in the form of eggs. Eggs are white with an orange spot; this spot becomes darker and larger if the egg is fertilised, approximately 1mm long and 0.3mm wide. The larvae, also called nymphs, hatch after about 20 days and develop through five stages, known as instars. The larvae are well known for the self-generated foam nests which can be observed during spring in meadows (especially on cuckoo flowers, Cardamine pratensis, and broom, Genista, species). The larvae in the foam nests are largely protected from predators and also get the necessary moisture for the appropriate development and temperature, so their mortality remains low even in bad weather. The larval stage lasts about 50 days. The adults leave the foam nest only when it is completely dried. This takes about ten days. The females mate soon after. Froghoppers are polyphagous, their host plant specificity is low, so that they can feed on a variety of plants, mainly grasses (Poaceae species), reed plants (Juncaceae species), herbs and sometimes trees (including the olive tree, where the species has been identified as spreading Xylella fastidiosa, the bacterium associated with Olive quick decline syndrome). They have been identified on over 170 host plants.

Life Born in the parish of St. Nicholas, Bristol, on 29 August 1675, he was the eldest son of John Lewis, wine cooper in the city. Francis Lewis, vicar of Worth Matravers, Dorset, was his paternal grandfather. His mother was Mary, eldest daughter of John Eyre, merchant, of Poole. He received his education first under Samuel Conant, rector of Lichet- Matravers, next at Wimborne grammar school, under John Moyle and afterwards under John Russel in the grammar school at Poole. He acted as assistant to Russel, who, after he had moved to Wapping, obtained for Lewis admission to the free school of Ratcliff Cross, belonging to the Coopers' Company. On leaving school Lewis became tutor to the sons of Daniel Wigfall, a Turkey and lead merchant, and afterwards, 30 March 1694, was admitted a batler of Exeter College, Oxford, under the tuition of George Verman, a friend of Conant. While at the university he became assistant in the free school of Poole in 1696. After graduating B.A. on 14 October 1697 he returned to Russel at Wapping, and shortly afterwards was ordained deacon. In April 1698 he became curate of Acrise, Kent, and was collated to the rectory of the parish on 4 September 1699. In 1702, Archbishop Thomas Tenison having ordered the sequestration of the rectory of Hawkinge, near Dover, licensed Lewis to serve the cure, and in 1705 presented him to the vicarage of St. John the Baptist, Margate. The archbishop collated him to the rectory of Saltwood, with the chapel of Hythe, and to the desolate rectory of Eastbridge in 1706, and subsequently removed him to the vicarage of Minster, to which he was instituted on 10 March 1709. Lewis was appointed to preach at the archiepiscopal visitation on 28 May 1712, when his Whiggish and Low Church views excited open hostility from his hearers. He commenced M.A. in 1712 as a member of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In 1714 he offended a former friend, John Johnson of Cranbrook, by attacking, in his 'Bread and Wine in the Holy Eucharist not a proper Material Propitiatory Sacrifice,' Johnson's 'Unbloody Sacrifice & Altar Unvailed,' which presented the high-church position. Archbishop Tenison, Daniel Waterland, and Samuel Bradford approved of Lewis's reply, and when he re- enunciated his views in Canterbury Cathedral on 30 January 1717, Archbishop William Wake rewarded him with the mastership of Eastbridge Hospital, Canterbury. From this time until his death he engaged on works on biography and topography. Dying on 16 January 1747, he was buried in the chancel of his church at Minster. He composed more than a thousand sermons, but he ordered his executor to destroy them, 'lest they might contribute to the laziness of others.' He married Mary, the youngest daughter of Robert Knowler of Herne, Kent. She died in 1720, leaving no issue. Works Gospel of St. John, Wyclif translation from the 14th century, a copy owned by Lewis. Religious biography Lewis is mainly known as a biographer of John Wyclif, William Caxton, Reginald Pecock, and Bishop John Fisher, leaving heavy works of research written with a Protestant slant: * The History of the Life and Sufferings of ‚Ä¶ John Wicliffe. ‚Ä¶ With a Collection of Papers relating to the said History, never before printed, Lond. 1720 and 1723; new edit., corrected and enlarged by the author, Oxford, 1820. * The Life of Mayster Wyllyam Caxton, of the Weald of Kent, the first Printer in England. In which is given an Account of the Rise and Progress of the Art of Prynting in England during his time, till 1493, was first published, Lond. 1737. In this work he was assisted by Sir Peter Thompson and Joseph Ames. Most of it was inserted by Thomas Frognall Dibdin in his edition of Ames's Typographical Antiquities. It was superseded by William Blades's Biography of Caxton. Collections for a history of printing by Lewis, dated 1741, are in British Library Add MS 20035. * The Life of Reynold Pecocke, Bishop of St. Asaph and Chichester; ‚Ä¶ being a sequel of the Life of Dr. J. Wiclif, to an introduction to the history of the English Reformation, appeared in 1744; new edit. Oxford, 1820. * The Life of Dr. John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester. With an Appendix of illustrative Documents and Papers, was first printed in 2 vols. in 1855. With an introduction by Thomas Hudson Turner. Lewis also edited Roper's Life of More, 1729, and he left in manuscript lives of Servetus (written in answer to Sir Benjamin Hodges's biography, Lond. 1724, and formerly in Sir Peter Thompson's possession); of John Wallis, 1735; of George Hickes, 1744‚Äì5; and of John Johnson of Cranbrook. Part of an autobiography by Lewis, which he continued till near his death, is extant in a copy transcribed for Sir Peter Thompson (British Library Add MS 28651). Bible history Lewis also made contributions to religious history and bibliography. Pursuing his study of Wiclif he published in 1731 The New Testament, translated out of the Latin Vulgat by John Wiclif, S.T.P., about 1378: to which is pr√¶fixt a History of the Translations of the Bible and New Testament, &c.; into English, London. The History of Translations was the first history of the English Bible since Miles Smith wrote in 1611;David Daniel, The Bible in English (2003), pp. 505‚Äì6. it was issued separately with additions as A Complete History of the several Translations of the Holy Bible and New Testament into English, both in MS. and in print, 2nd edit., with additions, Lond. 1739; 3rd edit., with an appendix drawn from William Newcome's Historical View of English Biblical Translations, Lond. 1818. In 1738 appeared A brief History of the Rise and Progress of Anabaptism in England; to which is prefixed some account of Dr. John Wicliffe, with a Defence of him from the false Charge of his denying Infant Baptism, London. A Reply to the work, by Thomas Crosby, is dated 1738. Lewis pursued the subject in A Vindication of the Ancient Britons and the Pighards of Bohemia from the false accusation of being Anabaptists, London 1741. Richard Chilton published Some Observations on this work, 1743. Topography Lewis's topographical works deal mainly with Kent.

Over his major league career, Williams batted .263 with 171 runs scored, 367 hits, 58 doubles, 31 triples, 12 home runs, 147 runs batted in (RBIs), and 95 stolen bases in 410 games played. Williams career started out in 1909 with the Monmouth Browns of the Class-D Illinois‚ÄìMissouri League. After playing in the minor leagues for two seasons, Williams made his major league debut in 1911. He had another stint in the majors in 1912. In 1913, Williams served as the Browns regular outfielder. He was a dead-ball era power hitter for the Browns, ranking in the top-10 amongst American League hitters in home runs during the 1913 and 1914 seasons. He led the league in strikeouts in 1914. Williams would make his last appearance in the major leagues during the 1915 season. He would go on to play in the minors with the Toronto Maple Leafs (1915), Nashville Volunteers (1916), Louisville Colonels (1917), and Indianapolis Indians (1918). In the minors, he compiled a career batting average of .293 with 838 hits in 759 games played. Williams also played semi-professional baseball after leaving the professional circuit. He batted and threw left-handed. During his baseball career, Williams stood at and weighed . Early life Gus Williams was born on May 7, 1888 in Omaha, Nebraska to August, Sr. and Clara Williams of Indiana and Illinois, respectively. The two had four other children, Frank, Ross, Reed, and Weston. August Williams, Sr., whose parents hailed from Germany, was a fire chief in Omaha. Gus Williams had five siblings; sisters Mamie, Carie, Louisa, and Theresia; and brother Harry. Harry would go on to play two seasons with the New York Yankees (1913‚Äì14). For much of his adolescent life, he worked in a meat packing plant in Omaha. In 1908, Williams tried out with the Lincoln Railsplitters as a pitcher. He was turned away from their training camp after he was too \\"wild\\". Later in 1908, he signed with the minor league Marion Diggers of the Class-D Ohio State League, again as a pitcher. However, Williams joined a semi-professional league and did not play with the Marion club. Professional career=Early minor league career (1909‚Äì1910) In 1909, Williams signed with the minor league Lincoln Railsplitters, who he had tried out with a year before. Lincoln then farmed Williams out to the Monmouth Browns of the Class-D Illinois‚ÄìMissouri League. He was used as a pitcher for the Browns until June when manager John Corbett converted Williams to an outfielder. In September, a scout from the St. Louis Browns saw Williams play and reported back to the team's management that they should sign him. He was drafted later that month by the Browns in Major League Baseball's (MLB) rule 5 draft. The Browns had to pay Monmouth US$300 in accordance with the draft, but the Lincoln club contested the transaction, since Williams' contract was still owned by the Railsplitters. Baseball's National Commission ruled that Lincoln should receive the compensation from the Browns, since Williams was still under contract with them. Williams finished the season with the Monmouth club. He compiled a .327 batting average with 64 hits, 10 doubles, 15 triples, and two home runs. Williams finished the season first in the Illinois‚ÄìMissouri League in slugging percentage (.555), tied for first in triples, and fourth in batting average. Williams (labeled 2) was a member of the 1910 Monmouth Browns. Williams again played with the Monmouth Browns in 1910, who were now members of the Class-D Central Association. In July, as a member of the Monmouth club, Williams hit a home run during an exhibition game against the MLB Chicago Cubs, which ended in the Cubs favor by a score of 5‚Äìto‚Äì4. By the end of the season, Williams had compiled a .290 batting average with 138 hits, 30 doubles, 11 triples, and seven home runs in 128 games played. Amongst league batters, he was second in triples, third in total bases (211), and fourth in slugging percentage (.443). After the season, the St. Louis Browns stated their intent for Williams to make his MLB debut during the 1911 season. St. Louis Browns (1911‚Äì15) During spring training in 1911, Williams played with the St. Louis Browns. He made his MLB debut on April 12, against the Cleveland Naps. In that game, he had three hits, which included two doubles, in three at-bats. With the Browns that season, he batted .269 with one run scored, seven hits, three doubles, and four runs batted in (RBIs) in nine games played. He was assigned to the Omaha Rourkes of the Class-A Western League in mid-May. In July, Williams was benched due to poor play. The Lincoln Evening News stated that Williams had trouble hitting curveballs. On the season, Williams batted .303 with 149 hits 26 doubles, 15 triples, and 10 home runs in 128 games played. He was third in the league in home runs; and was tied for fifth in triples, and slugging percentage (.478). Williams broke into the majors in 1911, playing with the St. Louis Browns until the 1915 season. Williams joined the Montgomery Rebels of the Class-A Southern Association at the start of the 1912 season. On June 17, Williams quit the Montgomery club after he stated it was too hot to play baseball in the area. He returned to his home-town of Omaha, where he played during the 1911 season where he asked the team for a contract. John Dobbs, the president of the Rebels telegraphed Williams at his home in Omaha that Montgomery would raise his salary if he returned to the team. However, Williams stated he did not want to return to the Montgomery team that season. In 57 games played with the Rebels that season, he batted .286 with 54 hits. Williams joined the St. Louis Browns in July. Williams made his MLB season debut on July 27, against the New York Highlanders. In that game, he got one hit, a double, in three at-bats. In August, Williams replaced Heinie Jantzen as the Browns every-day outfielder. Williams' first career MLB home run came on September 27, against Chicago White Sox pitcher Frank Lange. During the next game on September 28, Williams hit his second career home run, also against Frank Lange. On the season, he batted .292 with 32 runs scored, 63 hits, 13 doubles, seven triples, two home runs, 32 RBIs, and 18 stolen bases in 64 games played. In 1913, Williams played his first full season in the majors. During spring training that season, he reportedly exceeded the expectations of St. Louis Browns manager George Stovall. In May, a syndicated column \\"Ball and Bat Notes\\" had a section calling Williams \\"one of the best fielders in the country\\". Williams batted .273 with 72 runs scored, 147 hits, 21 doubles, 16 triples, five home runs, 51 RBIs, and 31 stolen bases in 148 games played. Amongst American League batters, Williams was second in strikeouts (87); tied for fourth with Ty Cobb in triples; tied for fifth with Rube Oldring, and Danny Moeller in home runs; tied for sixth with Oldring in at-bats per home runs (107.6), and eighth in extra base hits (42). Williams re-signed with the St. Louis Browns in March 1914. The Browns feared that Williams would sign with a Federal League team, since it was reported in February that he was in talks with the Kansas City Packers, however he continued his tenure with St. Louis. Williams led the American League in batting average until the beginning of June. At one point in the season, Williams was sustaining a .452 batting average, with Sam Crawford, and Shoeless Joe Jackson trailing behind that. On June 26, The Washington Post reported that Williams hit one of the longest home runs ever at Sportsman's Park. Sportswriter Charles Bartlett stated that St. Louis manager Branch Rickey was the reason for Williams success that year, writing: \\"Branch Rickey is the man who made a star of Gus Williams. Who ever heard of [Williams] playing the brand of ball he's been exhibiting this year\\". In July, Williams went into a slump, causing manager Rickey to position him at the sixth spot in the Browns batting order. On the season, Williams batted .253 with 51 runs scored, 126 hits, 19 doubles, six triples, four home runs, 47 RBIs, and 35 stolen bases. He led American League hitters in strikeouts that season (120). Williams was also tied for seventh with Howie Shanks, Marty Kavanagh, Tris Speaker, and Jimmy Walsh in home runs; and tied for ninth with Donie Bush, and Ty Cobb in stolen bases. In late-February 1915, Williams re- signed with the St. Louis Browns, and reported to their spring training in Texas. Browns manager Branch Rickey stated before the start of the season that he expected Williams to have a more productive season then 1914. The Kingston Daily Freeman called Williams the \\"best bad ball player\\" that season. With St. Louis that season, he batted .202 with 15 runs scored, 24 hits, two doubles, two triples, one home run, 11 RBIs, and 11 stolen bases in 45 games played. He made his last MLB appearance on June 18. Later career (1915‚Äì18) Williams (labeled 2) signed with the Nashville Volunteers in 1916, leading them to the Southern Association Championship that year. On August 21, 1915 the St. Louis Browns traded Williams to the minor league Toronto Maple Leafs of the Double-A International League in exchange for a pitcher to be named later. On the season with Toronto, Williams batted .285 with 97 hits, 15 doubles, nine triples, and eight home runs in 90 games played. He finished the seasons fifth in the International League in home runs. After the season, Williams wrote Rowdy Elliott, the manager of the Oakland Oaks, requesting a chance to try out for the team. Elliott said that he was not interested in another left-handed hitter, as he already had outfielders Rube Gardner and Robert Middleton, who were also left-handed. Before the start of the 1916 season, Williams signed with the Nashville Volunteers of the Class-A Southern Association. The Volunteers won the Southern Association Championship that year. As a member of the winning team, Williams received a cash reward, and supply of cake from a local Atlanta bakery. With the Volunteers, he batted .298 with 156 hits, 33 doubles, 13 triples, and five home runs in 138 games played. Williams led the league in doubles, was second in hits, tied for second with Joe Harris in total bases (230), and tied for third with Ham Hyatt in triples. At the end of the 1916 season, Williams was selected by the Double-A Louisville Colonels of the American Association in the minor league draft. He played the entire 1917 season with the Colonels, batting .279 with 161 hits, 29 doubles, 24 triples, and seven home runs in 148 games played. Williams led the American Association in triples; was fifth in doubles; and tied for fifth with Dave Altizer, Johnny Beall, Ray Demmitt, Cozy Dolan, and Fred Nicholson in home runs. After the season, Louisville traded Williams, along with Red Corriden, to the Indianapolis Indians, who like the Colonels were members of the American Association. Williams batted in the lead-off spot in the Indians batting order. He primarily played right field for the Indians. The Indians were in talks with the St. Louis Cardinals to send Williams back to the majors, but negotiations fell through, resulting in him staying in Indianapolis. On the season, Williams batted .279 with 19 hits, four doubles, and three triples in 17 games played. That season would prove to be his last in professional baseball. Later life In July 1918, Williams signed with the semi- professional Allegheny Steel team, based out of Pittsburgh. By 1930, Williams was living in Sterling, Illinois with his wife Hazel, and their two daughters. Williams and his wife worked out of their own office as chiropractors. In 1942, Williams was working for a Stewart Warner in Sterling. Williams died on April 16, 1964 at the age of 75 in Sterling. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Sterling.

The first by election was held on 29 April 1961 and the nomination day was held on 11 March 1961 while the second by election was held on 15 July 1961 with the nomination day held on 10 June 1961. April 1961 by-election in Hong Lim Former PAP minister Ong Eng Guan resigned his seat in Hong Lim, filing the famous \\"16 resolutions\\" in the legislative assembly against the government and challenged the PAP to defeat him there after his sacking from the cabinet. Shortly after, he was expelled by the party after making open disputes with his Cabinet colleagues, including over the abolishment of the City Council when he was the last Mayor. Two other PAP members had followed him to join his faction and resigned from the party but did not resign their seats with Ong. July 1961 by-election in Anson It was held to elect a new assembly member after the death of the incumbent PAP member Baharuddin Mohammed Ariff in the constituency of Anson. =Historical significance= The victory of former Labour Front chief minister David Marshall, now Workers' Party (WP) leader, symbolised WP's first presence in the legislature. At the same time, Ong Eng Guan mustered the two former PAP assembly members who resigned with him to form the United People's Party while independent Assembly Speaker A. P. Rajah joined the newly formed Singapore Alliance - an alliance of SPA, UMNO, MCA and MIC. Hence, for the first time since, there were no independent legislators. Results=Hong Lim by election result Ong's landslide victory was attributed to his popularity with Hong Lim voters and his oratory skills. The PAP candidate, Jek Yeun Thong was Ong's secretary during his time as Mayor in the City Council. Jek would be elected to parliament in the 1963 election and serve as a cabinet minister until 1984. Anson by election result As both Ismail from Liberal Socialist Party and Ibrahim from Singapore Congress have failed to secure the minimum 12.5% of the votes, both had their deposits forfeited. Aftermath Two days after the Anson result, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew assumed full responsibility for the two election setbacks and resigned as prime minister to PAP chairman Toh Chin Chye, only for Toh to reject it. Lee then moved a motion of confidence in his own government five days after the Anson by election. The motion was agreed to with 27 \\"Ayes\\", 8 \\"Noes\\" and 16 abstentions. The members who voted \\"No\\" included David Marshall and members of the Singapore People's Alliance. 13 allegedly pro-communist PAP members and 3 members of Ong Eng Guan's UPP abstained. Lee's view was that the PAP members who did not vote for his motion would be expelled for breaking ranks and pulling support away to Communist opponents and he did so, sacking the 13 AMs and reducing his assembly majority to 1. The sacked members formed the far left Barisan Sosialis (BS) with a large number of PAP branches crossing the floor to join BS.

It is a parasitoid of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, family Buprestidae), an invasive species which has destroyed tens of millions of ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against the emerald ash borer (EAB), American scientists in conjunction with the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched since 2003 for its natural enemies in the wild leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, including Oobius agrili which is a solitary egg parasitoid of EAB on ash trees in Jilin province in 2004 and has been recorded to kill up to 60 percent of EAB eggs. Field studies were carried out in 2005 which revealed that Oobius agrili completes at least two generations per year. The peak period for parasitism was during July and August where egg parasitism rates were 56.3 percent and 61.5 percent, respectively. O. agrili is parthenogenic and has a sex ratio of 14.5:1 (female:male). O. agrili achieves synchrony with its host life cycle - part of the O. agrili larvae population in eggs of EAB undergoes diapause within the eggs during winter and emerges the following summer. The USDA carried out paired choice assays with eggs of six different native Agrilus species, two cerambycid beetles, and four lepidopterans. O. agrili ignored eggs of all other species except of three of the Agrilus species of egg size in the same range as that of EAB. O. agrili strongly preferred to oviposit in EAB eggs laid on ash than in eggs of other Agrilus species on their respective host plants. The selectivity shown by O. agrili has led to its being included in the biological control program for controlled releases in selected sites for further research.

It was built in the 13th century and originally served as a broletto (i.e., an administrative building) as well as a judicial seat. As it was the second broletto to be built in Milan, it is also known as the Broletto Nuovo (\\"new broletto\\"). The palace is decorated with a relief representing Oldrado da Tresseno (podest√† of Milan and fierce prosecutor of the Cathar heretics), and the bas relief of the scrofa semilanuta (\\"half-woolly sow\\"), which has been object of much controversy among scholars of the foundation and origins of Milan.Sightseeing in Milan History The building was constructed between 1228 and 1233Piazza Mercanti for podest√† Oldrado da Tresseno. It maintained a central role in the administrative and public life of Milan until the late 18th century. In 1773, under Empress Maria Theresa, it was restored and enlarged to serve as legal archives. The structural changes were designed by architect Francesco Croce, who added a new upper floor with large round windows and restyled the whole building based on Neoclassic canons. Other major modifications of the buildings were done in 1854 by architect Enrico Terzaghi; these included glass panes that closed the ground floor ambulatory, which was reopened between 1905 and 1907. Between 1866 and 1870, the building housed the headquarters of the Banca Popolare di Milano, a major Milanese bank, but thereafter returned to its function as a legal archives seat until 1970. In 1978, Marco Dezzi Bardeschi restored the building again, but he strongly opposed any proposal of structural change, including that of removing the upper floor added by Croce. Palazzo della Ragione inspired the design of another renowned building in the Milanese area, the Arengario of Monza.

He published an extensive bibliography critical of globalization, imperialism, and covert operations implemented by the CIA in Latin America, in particular. Selser was born in Buenos Aires. He earned a degree in Journalism at the University of Buenos Aires, and in 1955, was hired by the Uruguayan weekly journal, Marcha, as its chief Argentine correspondent. That year, he published his first book, a biography on Nicaraguan nationalist Augusto Sandino. He returned to Buenos Aires in 1956, and joined the editorial board of La Prensa. Selser joined the IPS news agency in 1964. He and his family left Argentina following the March 1976 coup, and was hired as researcher by the Latin American Institute of Latin American Studies (ILET). His three daughters, Irene, Gabriela and Claudia Selser, each became journalists in their own right. Selser was recognized by critics as \\"a Latin Americanist committed to freedom and justice.\\" His books covered a wide array of contentious Latin American issues and events, including the 1903 Separation of Panama from Colombia, the installation of the Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua, the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'√©tat, the Alliance for Progress, the 1964 overthrow of Dominican Republic President Juan Bosch and the subsequent U.S. occupation, the 1973 coup in Chile, psy-ops carried out in Latin America, the 1980 Cocaine Coup in Bolivia, the Salvadoran Civil War, the 1989 Operation Just Cause, and other topics.

According to Koetsier,. the generality of algebra principle assumed, roughly, that the algebraic rules that hold for a certain class of expressions can be extended to hold more generally on a larger class of objects, even if the rules are no longer obviously valid. As a consequence, 18th century mathematicians believed that they could derive meaningful results by applying the usual rules of algebra and calculus that hold for finite expansions even when manipulating infinite expansions. In works such as Cours d'Analyse, Cauchy rejected the use of \\"generality of algebra\\" methods and sought a more rigorous foundation for mathematical analysis. An example is Euler's derivation of the series for 0. He first evaluated the identity at r=1 to obtain The infinite series on the right hand side of () diverges for all real x.

It was not consistently spelled any single way during his lifetime, in manuscript or in printed form. After his death the name was spelled variously by editors of his work, and the spelling was not fixed until well into the 20th century. The standard spelling of the surname as \\"Shakespeare\\" was the most common published form in Shakespeare's lifetime, but it was not one used in his own handwritten signatures. It was, however, the spelling used as a printed signature to the dedications of the first editions of his poems Venus and Adonis in 1593 and The Rape of Lucrece in 1594. It is also the spelling used in the First Folio, the definitive collection of his plays published in 1623, after his death. The spelling of the name was later modernised, \\"Shakespear\\" gaining popular usage in the 18th century, which was largely replaced by \\"Shakspeare\\" from the late 18th through the early 19th century. In the Romantic and Victorian eras the spelling \\"Shakspere\\", as used in the poet's own signature, became more widely adopted in the belief that this was the most authentic version. From the mid-19th to the early 20th century, a wide variety of spellings were used for various reasons; although, following the publication of the Cambridge and Globe editions of Shakespeare in the 1860s, \\"Shakespeare\\" began to gain ascendancy. It later became a habit of writers who believed that someone else wrote the plays to use different spellings when they were referring to the \\"real\\" playwright and to the man from Stratford upon Avon. With rare exceptions, the spelling is now standardised in English-speaking countries as \\"Shakespeare\\". Shakespeare's signatures There are six surviving signatures written by Shakespeare himself. These are all attached to legal documents. The six signatures appear on four documents: * a deposition in the Bellott v. Mountjoy case, dated 11 May 1612 * the purchase of a house in Blackfriars, London, dated 10 March 1613 * the mortgage of the same house, dated 11 March 1613 * his Last Will & Testament, which contains three signatures, one on each page, dated 25 March 1616 The signatures appear as follows: * Willm Shakp * William Shaksper * Wm Shakspe * William Shakspere * Willm Shakspere * By me William Shakspeare Most of these are abbreviated versions of the name, using breviographic conventions of the time. This was common practice. For example Edmund Spenser sometimes wrote his name out in full (spelling his first name Edmund or Edmond), but often used the abbreviated forms \\"Ed: spser\\" or \\"Edm: spser\\".Albert Charles Hamilton (ed), The Spenser Encyclopedia, University of Toronto Press, 1990, p. 346. The three signatures on the will were first reproduced by the 18th- century scholar George Steevens, in the form of facsimile engravings. The two relating to the house sale were identified in 1768, and the document itself was acquired by Edmond Malone. Photographs of these five signatures were published by Sidney Lee.Sidney Lee, Shakespeare's Handwriting: Facsimiles of the Five Authentic Autograph Signatures, London, Smith Elder, 1899. The final signature was discovered by 1909 by Charles William Wallace.Wallace, Charles William, \\"Shakespeare and his London Associates,\\" Nebraska University Studies, October 1910. There is also a signature on the fly-leaf of a copy of John Florio's translation of the works of Montaigne, which reads \\"Willm. Shakspere\\". This is no longer considered genuine, but was accepted by some scholars until the late 20th century.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion, 1550‚Äì1950, Funk & Wagnalls, New York, 1952 pp. 209, 424. Another possibly authentic signature appears on a copy of William Lambarde's Archaionomia (1568). Though smudged, the spelling appears to be \\"Shakspere\\".Schoenbaum, Samuel. William Shakespeare: Records and Images. New York: Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 109. Other spellings The memorial plaque on Shakespeare's tomb in the Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon. His name is spelled \\"Shakspeare\\". Next to it, the inscription on the grave of his widow Anne Hathaway calls her the \\"wife of William Shakespeare\\". The writer David Kathman has tabulated the variations in the spelling of Shakespeare's name as reproduced in Samuel Schoenbaum's William Shakespeare: A Documentary Life. He states that of \\"non-literary references\\" in Shakespeare's lifetime (1564‚Äì1616) the spelling \\"Shakespeare\\" appears 71 times, while \\"Shakespere\\" appears second with 27 usages. These are followed by \\"Shakespear\\" (16); \\"Shakspeare\\" (13); \\"Shackspeare\\" (12) and \\"Shakspere\\" (8). There are also many other variations that appear in small numbers or as one-offs. Critics of Kathman's approach have pointed out that it is skewed by repetitions of a spelling in the same document, gives each occurrence the same statistical weight irrespective of context, and does not adequately take historical and chronological factors into account. R.C. Churchill notes that name variations were far from unusual in the Elizabethan era: Kathman notes that the spelling is typically more uniform in printed versions than in manuscript versions, and that there is a greater variety of spelling in provincial documents than in metropolitan ones. Printed spellings The title page of the 1598 edition of Love's Labour's Lost in which the name is spelled \\"Shake≈øpere\\", using a long s in the middle. Fifty-eight quarto (or Q) editions of Shakespeare's plays and five editions of poetry were published before the First Folio. On 20 of the plays, the author is not credited. On 15 title pages, his name is hyphenated, \\"Shakespeare\\", 13 of these spellings being on the title pages of just three plays, Richard II (Q2 1598, Q3 1598, Q4 1608, and Q5 1615), Richard III (Q2 1598, Q3 1602, Q4 1605, Q5 1612, and Q6 1622), and Henry IV, Part 1 (Q2 1599, Q3 1604, Q4 1608, and Q5 1613). A hyphen is also present in the first quarto of Hamlet (1602) and the second of King Lear (1619). The name printed at the end of the poem The Phoenix and the Turtle, which was published in a collection of verse in 1601, is hyphenated, as is the name on the title page and the poem A Lover's Complaint of Shake-speares Sonnets (1609). It is used in the cast list of Ben Jonson's Sejanus His Fall, and in six literary allusions published between 1594 and 1623.John Louis Haney, The Name of William Shakespeare, Egerton, 1906, pp. 27‚Äì30. The un-hyphenated spelling \\"Shakespeare\\" (or Shake≈øpeare, with a long s) appears on 22 of the 58 quartos. It is spelled this way in the first quartos of The Merchant of Venice (1600), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1600), Much Ado About Nothing (1600), The Merry Wives of Windsor (1602), Pericles, Prince of Tyre (1609), Troilus and Cressida (1609), Othello (1622). The second, or \\"good\\", quarto of Hamlet (1604) also uses this spelling. It is also spelled this way on the misattributed quarto of Sir John Oldcastle (1600; 1619) and on the verse collection The Passionate Pilgrim (1599). Rarer spellings are \\"Shakspeare\\" on the first quarto of King Lear (1608), and \\"Shake≈øpere\\", in the first quarto of Love's Labour's Lost (1598). On the misattributed quarto A Yorkshire Tragedy (1608) his name is spelled \\"Shak≈øpeare\\", a spelling that also appears on the quarto of The Two Noble Kinsmen (1634), which was published after the First Folio. James S. Shapiro argues that Shakespeare's name caused difficulties for typesetters, and that is one reason why the form with the \\"e\\" in the centre is most commonly used, and why it is sometimes hyphenated.. Kathman argues that any name that could be divided into two clear parts was liable to be hyphenated, especially if the parts could be interpreted as distinct words. Spellings in later publications English Augustan era. Later editions of Shakespeare's works adopted differing spellings, in accordance with fashions of modernised spelling of the day, or, later, of attempts to adopt what was believed to be the most historically accurate version of the name. When he was referred to in foreign languages, he acquired even more variant spellings. 18th-century French critics were known to use \\"Shakpear, Shakespehar, Shakespeart, or Shakees Pear.\\"R.C. Churchill, Shakespeare and His Betters: A History and a Criticism of the Attempts Which Have Been Made to Prove That Shakespeare's Works Were Written by Others, Max Reinhardt, London, 1958, p. 20. Shakespear A shift from \\"Shakespeare\\" to the modernised spelling \\"Shakespear\\" occurs in the second printing of the Third Folio, published in 1664 by Philip Chetwinde. This retained the original title page, but included a section with additional plays. The title page of this new add-on adopted the new spelling. It was also adopted by other authors of the Restoration Era. John Downes and Nahum Tate both use the spelling.Hazelton Spencer, Shakespeare Improved: The Restoration Versions in Quarto and on the Stage, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1927. This was followed by 18th-century writers. Shakespeare's first biographer, Nicholas Rowe, also spelled the name \\"Shakespear\\", in his book Some Account of the Life &c.; of Mr. William Shakespear (1709) and in his new edition of the works. This spelling was followed by Alexander Pope in his edition of the Works of Shakespear (1725) and George Sewell (The Works of Mr. William Shakespear).Simon Jarvis, Scholars and Gentlemen: Shakespearian Textual Criticism and Representations of Scholarly Labour, 1725‚Äì1765, Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 50. The spelling with an \\"e\\" at the end persisted, however. Pope's rival Lewis Theobald retained it in his edition, Shakespeare Restored (1726), which pointedly rejected attempts to modernise and sanitise the original works.Theobald adopts Pope's spelling in An Answer to Mr. Pope's Preface to Shakespear, Jarvis, p. 93. The \\"Shakespear\\" spelling continued to be used by scholars throughout the 18th century, including William Warburton. However, many, like Theobald, preferred the First Folio spelling, most notably Samuel Johnson. \\"Shakespear\\" was less widely used into the 19th and 20th centuries, increasingly by advocates of rational spelling. William Hazlitt used it in his book Characters of Shakespear's Plays. George Bernard Shaw, a strong advocate of spelling reform, insisted on the use of this spelling in all his publications. Archaising spellingsShakspeare= Edmond Malone used the spelling \\"Shakspeare\\", which was most common in the Georgian era. Archival material relating to Shakespeare was first identified by 18th-century scholars, most notably Edmond Malone, who recorded variations in the spelling of the name. Malone declared a preference for the spelling \\"Shakspeare\\", using it in his major publications including his 1790 sixteen-volume edition of the complete works of the playwright. George Steevens also used this spelling. Steevens and Malone had both examined Shakespeare's will, and were convinced that the final signature was spelled this way, which also conformed to the spelling used on Shakespeare's tomb. However, Malone admitted that the signature was difficult to read and that the others were clearly spelled without the final \\"a\\". This spelling continued to be popular throughout the later Georgian period. Indeed \\"virtually every edition\\" of the playwright's work in the early 19th century before 1840 used this spelling. Even German scholars such as Friedrich Schlegel and Ludwig Tieck adopted it.John Louis Haney, The Name of William Shakespeare: a Study in Orthography, Egerton, 1906, pp. 42‚Äì50 The antiquarian Joseph Hunter was the first to publish all known variations of the spelling of the name, which he did in 1845 in his book Illustrations of the Life, Studies, and Writings of Shakespeare. He gives an account of what was known at the time of the history of the name of Shakespeare, and lists all its variant forms, including the most idiosyncratic instances such as \\"Shagsper\\" and \\"Saxpere\\". He linked this to a history of the Shakespeare family and its descendants, though he was not able to add much to the material already identified by Edmond Malone.Charles F. Johnson, Shakespeare and His Critics, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1909, p. 206. Hunter noted that \\"there has been endless variety in the form in which this name has been written.\\" He criticised Malone and Steevens, writing that \\"in an evil hour they agreed, for no apparent reason, to abolish the e in the first syllable.\\"Joseph Hunter, Illustrations of the Life, Studies, and Writings of Shakespeare, London, Nichols, 1845, pp. 5‚Äì8. Hunter argued that there were probably two pronunciations of the name, a Warwickshire version and a London version, so that \\"the poet himself might be called by his honest neighbours at Stratford and Shottery, Mr. Shaxper, while his friends in London honoured him, as we know historically they did, with the more stately name of Shakespeare.\\" Kathman argues that while it is possible that different pronunciations existed, there is no good reason to think so on the basis of spelling variations. =Shakspere= Title page of Knight's Pictorial Shakspere, 1867 edition. According to Hunter it was in 1785 that the antiquarian John Pinkerton first revived the spelling \\"Shakspere\\" in the belief that this was the correct form as \\"traced by the poet's own hand\\" in his signatures. Pinkerton did so in Letters on Literature, published under the pen-name Robert Heron.Robert Heron, on Literature, London, Robinson, 1785. Pinkerton gives no explanation for his adoption of the spelling. The surmise is Hunter's. However, a later scholar identified a reference in The Gentleman's Magazine in 1784 to the deplorable \\"new fashion of writing Shakespeare's name SHAKSPERE\\", which suggests that the trend had been emerging since Steevens published facsimiles of the signatures in 1778. Nevertheless, Pinkerton gave it wide circulation. The \\"Shakspere\\" spelling was quickly adopted by a number of writers and in 1788 was given official status by the London publisher Bell in its editions of the plays. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who published a large quantity of influential literature on the playwright, used both this and the \\"Shakspeare\\" spelling. His major works were published after his death with the new spelling.Thomas M. Raysor, \\"Coleridge's Manuscript Lectures\\", Modern Philology, 1924, pp. 17‚Äì25. The spelling continued to be preferred by many writers during the Victorian era, including the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in The Germ.The Germ: The Literary Magazine of the Pre-Raphaelites, 1998, facsimile reprint, Ashmoleon Museum, Oxford. The matter was widely debated. The Gentleman's Magazine became the forum for discussion of the topic. There was a heated debate in 1787, followed by another in 1840 when the spelling was promoted in a book by Frederic Madden, who insisted that new manuscript evidence proved that the poet always wrote his name \\"Shakspere\\". Isaac D'Israeli wrote a strongly worded letter condemning this spelling as a \\"barbaric curt shock\\". There followed a lengthy correspondence, mainly between John Bruce, who insisted on \\"Shakspere\\" because \\"a man's own mode of spelling his own name ought to be followed\\" and John William Burgon, who argued that \\"names are to be spelt as they are spelt in the printed books of the majority of well-educated persons\\", insisting that this rule authorised the spelling \\"Shakspeare\\". Various other contributors added to the debate.The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 13, passim. A number of other articles covered the spelling dispute in the 19th century, in which the \\"Shakspere\\" spelling generally was promoted on the grounds that it was the poet's own. Albert Richard Smith in the satirical magazine The Month claimed that the controversy was finally \\"set to rest\\" by the discovery of a manuscript which proved that the spelling changed with the weather, \\"When the sun shone he made his 'A's, / When wet he took his 'E's.\\"Albert Smith & John Leech, The Month, a view of passing subjects and manners, London, 1851, p. 316. In 1879 The New York Times published an article on the dispute, reporting on a pamphlet by James Halliwell-Phillipps attacking the \\"Shakspere\\" trend.New York Times, 27 December 1879. Many of the most important Victorian Shakespeare publishers and scholars used this spelling, including Charles Knight, whose The Pictorial Edition of the Works of Shakspere was very popular, and Edward Dowden, in Shakspere: a critical study of his mind and art. In Britain the New Shakspere Society was founded in 1873 by Frederick James Furnivall and, in America, the Shakspere Society of Philadelphia adopted the spelling. The former folded in 1894, but the latter still exists under its original name.Matt Kozusko, \\"Borrowers and Lenders,\\" The Journal of Shakespeare and Appropriation, The Shakspere Society of Philadelphia, 2007. The spelling was still common in the early to mid 20th century, for example in Brander Matthews', Shakspere as a Playwright (1913),Brander Matthews, Shakspere as a Playwright, Scribner's Sons, New York, 1913 Alwin Thaler's Shakspere to Sheridan (1922),Alwin Thaler, Shakspere to Sheridan: A Book about the Theatre of Yesterday and To-Day, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1922. and T.W. Baldwin's Shakspere's five-act structure (1947).J. M. Nosworthy, review in The Review of English Studies, Oxford, 1949, pp. 359‚Äì361. Shakespeare The spelling \\"Shakespeare\\" was vigorously defended by Isaac D'Israeli in his original letter to the Gentleman's Magazine. Joseph Hunter also expressly stated it to be the most appropriate spelling. D'Israeli argued that the printed spellings of the poems would have been chosen by the author. He also insisted that the spelling represents the proper pronunciation, evidenced by puns on the words \\"shake\\" and \\"spear\\" in Shakespeare's contemporaries. Hunter also argued that the spelling should follow established pronunciation and pointed to the poems, stating that \\"we possess printed evidence tolerably uniform from the person himself\\" supporting \\"Shakespeare\\". Although Dowden, the most influential voice in Shakespearean criticism in the last quarter of the 19th century,. used the spelling \\"Shakspere\\", between 1863 and 1866 the nine-volume The Works of William Shakespeare, edited by William George Clark, John Glover, and William Aldis Wright, all Fellows of Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, had been published by the university. This edition (soon generally known as \\"The Cambridge Shakespeare\\") spelled the name \\"Shakespeare\\". A related edition, including Shakespeare's text from the Cambridge Shakespeare but without the scholarly apparatus, was issued in 1864 as \\"The Globe Edition\\". This became so popular that it remained in print and established itself as a standard text for almost a century.. With the ubiquity and authority of the Cambridge and Globe editions, backed by the impeccable academic credentials of the Cambridge editors, the spelling of the name as \\"Shakespeare\\" soon dominated in publications of works by and about Shakespeare. Although this form had been used occasionally in earlier publications, and other spellings continued to appear, from that point \\"Shakespeare\\" gained the dominance which it retains to this day.. Shakespeare authorship question Title page of the first quarto of King Lear (1608) with a hyphenated spelling of the name. When the advocates of the Shakespeare authorship question began to claim that someone other than Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays, they drew on the fact that variant spellings existed to distinguish between the supposed pseudonym used by the hidden author and the name of the man born in Stratford, who is claimed to have acted as a \\"front man\\".Ironically, the first anti- Stratfordian book uses the \\"Shakspere\\" spelling, Delia Bacon's The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded, London, Groombridge, 1857. The use of different spellings was sometimes simply a convenience, to clarify which \\"Shakespeare\\" was being discussed. In other cases it was linked to an argument about the meaning supposed to be attached to \\"Shakespeare\\" as a pseudonym. In some instances it arose from a belief that different spelling literally implied, as R.C. Churchill puts it, \\"that there must have been two men: one, the actor, whom they mostly call 'Shaksper' or 'Shakspere', the other the real author (Bacon, Derby, Rutland, etc.) whom they call 'Shakespeare' or 'Shake- speare' (with the hyphen).\\" In some cases there were even imagined to be three Shakespeares: the author, the actor and the Stratford man.Percy Allen, Anne Cecil, Elizabeth & Oxford: A Study of Relations between these three, with the Duke of Alencon added; based mainly upon internal evidence, drawn from (Chapman's?) A Lover's Complaint; Lord Oxford's (and others) A Hundreth Sundrie Flowers; Spenser's Faery Queen..., Archer, 1934; Graf Vitzthum, Shakespeare und Shakspere, p. 5ff; Louis P. B√©n√©zet, Shakspere, Shakespeare and de Vere, p. 25. The choice of spelling for the Stratford man varied. Because he is known to have signed his name \\"Shakspere\\" when writing it out in full, this is the spelling sometimes adopted. However, H.N. Gibson notes that outlandish spellings seem sometimes to be chosen purely for the purpose of ridiculing him, by making the name seem vulgar and rustic, a characteristic especially typical of Baconians such as Edwin Durning-Lawrence: Some authors claim that the use of a hyphen in early published versions of the name is an indication that it is a pseudonym.. They argue that fictional descriptive names (such as \\"Master Shoe-tie\\" and \\"Sir Luckless Woo-all\\") were often hyphenated in plays, and pseudonyms such as \\"Tom Tell-truth\\" were also sometimes hyphenated.. Kathman argues that this is not the case, and that real names were as likely to be hyphenated as pseudonyms. He states that the pseudonym \\"Martin Marprelate\\" was sometimes hyphenated, but usually not. Robert Waldegrave, who printed the Marprelate tracts, never hyphenated the name, but did hyphenate his own: \\"If hyphenation was supposed to indicate a pseudonym, it is curious that Waldegrave repeatedly hyphenated his own name while failing to hyphenate an undisputed pseudonym in the same texts.\\" See also * List of Shakespeare plays in quarto * Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, Shakespeare's contemporary, signed his surname as Cerbantes. * Chespirito was a Mexican actor.

The dress and its maker were not formally announced until the bride stepped from her car to enter Westminster Abbey just prior to the service. Noted for its design, symbolism, and expected influence on Western bridal gown trends, the dress was widely anticipated and generated much comment in the media. Replicas of the dress were produced and sold, and the original dress was on display at Buckingham Palace from 23 July 2011 until 3 October 2011 during the annual summer exhibition. Pre-wedding speculation Before the day, there was much speculation as to what Middleton would choose for her dress. On 6 March, The Sunday Times reported on speculation that Middleton had chosen McQueen designer Sarah Burton. Their report stated: \\"A fashion source said that the dress will be a combination of Middleton's own design ideas and Burton's deep knowledge and understanding of high fashion.\\" The label and Burton both denied any involvement. Burton's work came to the notice of Middleton in 2005 when she attended the wedding of Tom Parker Bowles, the son of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Burton had designed the bridal gown for his bride, fashion journalist Sara Buys. Also suggested were Phillipa Lepley, Victoria Beckham, Sophie Cranston's Libelula, Jasper Conran, Elizabeth Emanuel, Daniella Issa Helayel, Marchesa by Keren Craig and Georgina Chapman, Stella McCartney, Bruce Oldfield, and Catherine Walker. Burton emerged as the odds-on favourite to create the dress amongst bookmakers, so much so that the English bookmaker William Hill stopped taking wagers weeks before the event. David Emanuel, co-designer of the wedding dress of Diana, Princess of Wales, commented to the Canadian fashion journalist Jeanne Beker that \\"McQueen is owned by Gucci, an Italian company. If Kate's gone that route, it would be the first time a British-owned house wasn't chosen. And the Italians would have a field day with that.\\"A bet on the train of events. thestar.com (26 April 2011). Retrieved on 1 May 2011. According to Joanna Marschner, Senior Curator of the Historic Royal Palaces, \\"the dresses have had to grow as the media expectation has grown. Television cameras in Westminster Abbey have meant that those dresses are going to have to live up to those venues and indeed be of a design excellence to bear infinite scrutiny.\\" Design A replica of the dress outside a shop in Belfast Official statements noted that Middleton wished to combine tradition and modernity, \\"with the artistic vision that characterises Alexander McQueen's work.\\" She and Burton worked closely together in formulating the dress design. The British tabloid News of the World reported that to maintain secrecy, the embroiderers at the Royal School of Needlework were initially told that the dress was intended to be used in a television costume drama and that cost was no object. As a result, it had been widely reported that the dress cost ¬£250,000, although a Clarence House spokesperson dismissed that claim. The ivory satin bodice was padded slightly at the hips and narrowed at the waist, and was inspired by the Victorian tradition of corsetry that is a particular Alexander McQueen hallmark. The bodice incorporated floral motifs cut from machine-made lace, which were then appliqu√©d on to silk net (tulle) by workers from the Royal School of Needlework, based at Hampton Court Palace. On the back were 58 buttons of gazar and organza, which fasten by means of rouleau loops. The skirt, underskirt trim and bridal train (which measured 270 cm‚Äî110in) also incorporated lace appliqu√©d in a similar manner. The main body of the dress was made in ivory and white satin gazar, using UK fabrics which had been specially sourced by Sarah Burton, with a long, full skirt designed to echo an opening flower, with soft pleats which unfolded to the floor, forming a Victorian-style semi-bustle at the back, and finishing in a short train measuring just under three metres in length. To partially fulfill the 'something blue' portion of the British wedding tradition, a blue ribbon was sewn inside the dress. The design for the bodice of the dress featuring lace in the style of the 19th century was the 'something old'. The British press showed considerable interest in the lace used in the wedding dress, but their published reports are at variance with available documentation, and suggest that they were briefed with common incorrect or misleading information. The facts about the lace are as follows. The effect achieved by the design of the bodice is similar to that of the decorated nets that were popular in the late 19th century, typified by the Limerick and Carrickmacross laces of Ireland. For the latter, machine-made net is used as a basis on which floral and other designs are created by various hand-needlework techniques. The press release from the Royal School of Needlework states that the technique used in Catherine's wedding dress \\"was influenced by\\" traditional Carrickmacross lace technique. However, the technique itself was a completely different and modern device: floral motifs were cut out of lengths of lace produced on large 19th- century machines and stitched to machine net. Three companies are known to have produced lace for the dress: Sophie Hallette and Solstiss in France, and the Cluny Lace Company in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. The majority of the dress is made using the Solstiss lace, specifically the skirt and train. The styles of machine lace go by the names \\"English Cluny\\" and \\"Chantilly\\", but should not be confused with the older hand-made bobbin laces of the same names. The lace was not specially commissioned for the dress, but chosen from stock patterns (what was formerly known only as Sophie Hallette's \\"950264\\" is now known as \\"Kate's lace\\", however, this lace was only used for the bodice of the dress, the skirt and train are made of the Solstiss lace. Grace Kelly's wedding dress was also made from lace by Solstiss, a French company. All the companies involved are known to produce the highest quality of couture lace.) and hence the floral motifs available were those present in the patterns. Although roses and perhaps shamrocks may be discerned on the bodice, the many reports of daffodils and thistles needed to complete a British quartet seem to be embroidery of the truth rather than of the dress. Reception and influence The dress generated much comment in the media from fashion experts and was very well received. It was noted that the design was largely traditional and inspired by dresses from the 1950s. Karl Lagerfeld wrote \\"the dress is classic and goes very well in the Westminster decor. It almost reminds me of Elizabeth's wedding, the royal weddings in the [19]50s. The proportion of the train is good. The lace is very pretty. I like the veil a lot.\\" Antonio Marras, of Kenzo, stated, \\"the choice of the label and the style of the dress was a very clever mix between edgy fashion and tradition ‚Äî all in a very British way. You could see references to Grace Kelly or Queen Elizabeth's dresses, but in a simpler, more modern way.\\" It was noted that the lace bodice of Middleton's dress echoed that worn by Grace Kelly for her marriage to Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, in 1956. Comparisons were also drawn with Princess Margaret's wedding dress. Mark Badgley of Badgley Mischka wrote that \\"it's the kind of gown that will stand the test of time. Not all gowns do. Any bride across the world will want to wear it. It's got a touch of vintage, a classic 1950s ball gown, so timeless that her daughter would look gorgeous in this gown 30 years from now.\\"Simplicity Wears the Crown, The New York Times, 29 April 2011 Meanwhile, Oscar de la Renta stated that it was \\"a very traditional dress for a very traditional wedding...not ostentatious. There was not 50 meters of train, and it was not overembroidered. It was just a very traditional dress for a ravishing girl who doesn't need a lot.\\" Comparisons were also made to the dress worn by Prince William's mother, Lady Diana Spencer. Vera Wang said \\"Diana's dress had a sense of innocence, whimsy, almost storybook romance. In contrast Catherine's gown was about way more than simply the dress. Sarah Burton channelled a new take on classicism for a modern-day bride who will one day be queen.\\" Diana's wedding dress maker, Elizabeth Emanuel, has suggested: \\"Exactly as it happened in 1981, there are going to be people watching as she walks down the aisle with their sketch pads, with the machinists and pattern cutters all ready and waiting. By the next morning you'll see copies in High Street.\\" Emanuel says the dress would fit many body shapes. Chinese replica of the dress offered for sale to the public four weeks after the Royal Wedding There were many suggestions that the style of the dress would influence wedding fashion for the next few years. Alison McGill, the editor-in-chief of Weddingbells Magazine: \\"I think her choice to wear long sleeves signals a big goodbye to strapless wedding gowns.\\" Meanwhile, Veronica Di Santo-Abramowicz, of the Toronto-based Ines Di Santo label opined \\"Kate's dress will influence so much of the bridal style that we will see over the next few years. It always happens that when a person of royalty or high stature gets married, this sets trends for several years. For example, Diana's gown and Carolyn Bessette's gown are two noteworthy brides that come to mind.\\" One British firm's replica, commissioned by The Times as a contest prize, was completed less than five hours after Middleton began her car ride to the Abbey. The firm received numerous inquiries within a day, but expressed that it would have to consult lawyers before replicas could be sold. New Zealand couturist Jane Yeh worked through the night after the wedding to create another copy of the dress. Chinese dressmakers told news reporters they expected to have knock-offs of the dress available one week from the event; one expressed frustration that it was not leaked in advance so that they could have stock prepared earlier. Another suggested a ¬£70 to ¬£90 retail price. The choice of a dress from the fashion house of Alexander McQueen, who had committed suicide in 2010, led Hubert de Givenchy to state \\"It's a lovely thought, a nice tribute.\\" The dress along with other items pertaining to the Royal Wedding were exhibited at Buckingham Palace from 23 July 2011 until 3 October 2011. The method of displaying the dress and tiara (on a headless mannequin lit by white lighting) was reported to have been described as \\"horrid\\" by the Queen during a private tour of the exhibition with the Duchess of Cambridge in July 2011. A microphone overheard the Queen remarking to the Duchess \\"It's made to look very creepy\\" while Catherine responded that it had a \\"3D effect\\". The dress helped attract a record number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the summer months of 2011. It was also reported to have helped raise around ten million pounds towards Middleton's own charity fund as well as the Royal Collection.

It runs daily every hour from 5 am to 9 pm from Wesel via Oberhausen, Duisburg, D√ºsseldorf, Cologne, Bonn, Remagen and Andernach to Koblenz, in the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate. It is the fourth-most used regional express line in the VRR network with approximately 48,000 passengers a day. Until the timetable change in December 2016, the Rhein-Express ran to/from Emmerich. Operations on this section and the additional services provided by Regionalbahn service RB 35 (Der Weseler) have since been operated as part of the Rhein-IJssel-Express (RE 19). History  The Rhein-Express was established in 1998 with the introduction of the integrated regular interval timetable in North Rhine- Westphalia (called NRW-Takt) by combining two services that previously started or finished in Cologne. Originally, the RE 5 service stopped at almost all intermediate stations, as if it were a Regionalbahn service. In December 2002, several intermediate stops and all overtaking by long-distance trains were eliminated, and the scheduled top speed was increased to 160 km/h, shortening the journey time by over 30 minutes between Cologne and Koblenz. The acceleration and the simultaneous thinning of services between Emmerich and Wesel reduced the number of sets of vehicles that was required for the circulation from nine to seven. Hourly services of the Rhein-Express were restored at the timetable change in 2007 between Emmerich and Wesel in order to compensate for the thinning of RB 35 (Der Weseler) services on the Emmerich‚ÄìWesel‚ÄìDuisburg route as a result of reduced funds for regional transport. In order to reach Emmerich in time for the return journey, it was necessary reduce stops at some minor stations to two-hour intervals in the direction of least loading. The problematic section between Emmerich and Wesel was transferred with effect from December 2016 with the letting of the contract for the new Rhine-IJssel-Express (RE 19), since the Rhein-Express now only operates on the Wesel‚ÄìKoblenz section. The Rhein-Express was operated by DB Regio NRW from 1998 to June 2019, based at the depot at Cologne-Deutz. National Express has operated the service as the RE 5 (RRX) since June 2019 Lines  The Rhein-Express uses four different lines with eight different route numbers: *the Oberhausen‚ÄìArnhem railway between Wesel (formerly Emmerich) and Oberhausen (used by regional, long-distance and freight trains), *the Duisburg‚ÄìDortmund railway between Oberhausen and Duisburg (all traffic without stops) *the Cologne‚ÄìDuisburg railway throughout (long distance tracks, see note below) *the Left Rhine line between Cologne and Koblenz (together with regional and intercity services). In the four to six track section between Duisburg and D√ºsseldorf, the Rhein-Express and the NRW-Express (RE 1), use the long-distance tracks. The Rhein-Haard-Express (RE 2), the Rhein- Emscher-Express (RE 3), the Rhein-Weser-Express (RE 6), Rhein-Hellweg-Express (RE 11) and the Rhein-IJssel-Express (RE 19) use the so-called local tracks where they exist or the S-Bahn tracks. Rolling stock  Rhein-Express (RE 5) in Remagen Originally, the Rhein-Express was operated with class 110 locomotives with and six modernised Silberling carriages without control cars. During 2002, the service was converted to push-pull train trains made up of newly delivered class 146 locomotives and five double-deck carriages. Because of flood damage at the manufacturer of the seats, the delivery of the double- deck carriages was delayed, so that until the summer of 2003 two sets of Silberling carriages could still be found on the service. Between August and November 2011, the capacity was increased by another car, which means that each train now includes a first-class only carriage. This first-class car is usually coupled directly to the engine, while the two-class compartment is in the control car at the other end of the train. Contract Four public transport associations are involved in the operation of the Rhein-Express: the Nahverkehrs-Zweckverband Niederrhein (local transport association of the Lower Rhine), the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (Rhine-Ruhr public transport association), Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg (Rhine-Sieg public transport association) and the Zweckverband Schienenpersonennahverkehr Rheinland-Pfalz Nord (Rhineland-Palatinate North rail transport association). Tenders for the RE 5 were called on 31 January 2014 as part of the award of the Rhein-Ruhr- Express for the period for the period from December 2019 to December 2033. National Express won the contract for operating the service. The company began operating Siemens Desiro HC rolling stock in June 2019, the provision and maintenance of which was outsourced to Siemens. Regionalbahn service RB 35, which supplemented the Rhein-Express until December 2016, ran mostly only between Wesel and Duisburg, but in the peak ran between Emmerich and D√ºsseldorf. It was extended from April 2017 across the Dutch border to Arnhem and was renamed, in accordance with its international importance, the Rhine- IJssel Express (RE 19). The line number RB 35 is now being used for what used to be operated as the northern section of the Rhein-Niers-Bahn (RB 33), which has run between M√∂nchengladbach and Gelsenkirchen since 2019. The Wupper- Lippe-Express (RE 49) running between Wesel and Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof via Oberhausen was also established in 2019. As part of the so-called RRX interim contract, services were provided by DB Regio from December 2016 until the commissioning of RRX rolling stock in June 2019. From the beginning of May 2019, single runs of RRX rolling stock were operated in trial mode by National Express.

E-boy thus starts taking the personality of the deceased child. He is obedient and very bright. He is also very intuitive and rarely goes against the wishes of his father. He is very loyal and amused by anything that is human. With an intuitive mind and a keen sense of observation, he can also mimic anyone‚Äîcopying their mannerisms, behaviors, and tendencies. *Andrea Brillantes as Princess - As a street kid, Princess knows the rules of the streets.

Gabriel grew up with his Mother who died before he has come of age‚Äîa reason why he had to go back to his father who nonetheless was a brilliant inventor as well. Gabriel was brought up by his mother to be a positive, caring, and a kind person. He easily sees the goodness in other people and possesses a free and imaginative mind. His attention to detail is also unrivaled. Contrary to what inventors think as science is a set of rigid rules, Gabriel thinks that science is actually like a magical world that needs to be explored. *Agot Isidro as Ria - A smart sophisticated modern woman from a family of doctors, Ria is set to becoming a doctor herself. Everything is set for her until she falls in love with a guy. This is where Ria realizes what is important to her: She is really not about ambition but instead wants to live a simple normal life, with a family that she longs for all her life. Ria is caring and has a very kind spirit. Family is more important to her and she'll do everything for them. She is a strong woman herself especially when it comes to the welfare of her own family. *Jomari Yllana as Miguel Villareal - Miguel is Gabriel's elder half-brother though they have different mothers. Probably because he had such a hard time earning the approval of his father, Miguel is a bit of the rebellious kind unlike Gabriel. Although he may not have the smarts of his brother, Miguel is however, very good strategist. He is charming and many say that he can always talk his way out of things. Miguel is fun, thrilling, and adventurous. But deep inside, he is very sensitive and is actually a jealous person. Though he has learned to love his half brother, he has become the same source of his insecurity. His great ambition for himself is to someday be on top‚Äîwith the belief that everyone will love him unconditionally by then. *Maliksi Morales as Adrian - Adrian is the eldest son of Gabriel and Ria.

He is a bit snooty and snobbish at first impression. Sometimes he's thought to be bitter and volatile. But the truth is, he has a vulnerable heart. He is an artist and is actually very sensitive. If there is one thing he dislikes, it is being told what to do. *Jaime Fabregas as Alfredo Villareal - Alberto is the father of both Gabriel and Miguel as well as the grandfather of Adrian (E-Boy) and Miyo. Still struggling to recover from a massive heart attack, Alberto is now but a shell of his former self. He was once a proud inventor known among the scientific community. Unfortunately after a setback from a prestigious award, everything went downhill for him. This is probably the reason why Alberto has never appeared to be a caring father to his children: He expected too much from himself that he also kept setting unrealistic expectations to his kids as well. often getting disappointed. He is often disappointed of his kids, only because he harbors a dream that one day, one of them shall continue his legacy, etching a mark in history by making a significant invention for the world. *Pen Medina as Tatang - He serves as the father figure of Tinay and Jepoy. The streets formed his hardened life‚ÄîHe was once a well-decorated criminal. Now that he's turned his back from his criminal activities, he has become a jack-of-all-trades, engaging in various legitimate rackets. He is strict because he wants to teach those youngsters under him that the world is harsh and unfair. This emanated from a sense of cynicism that formed throughout his years of living. As he says ‚Äúonly the fittest shall survive.‚Äù He is very fond of Tinay and the youngsters he adopted treating them like real family. *Chinggoy Alonzo as Jaime Mariano - He is a shrewd and ambitious politician who has a way with words. Perceived to be a reformist and a crusader, Jaime is actually a corrupt and deceiving politician. There is only one interest that is important to him and that is how to cling to power. He is capable of doing very bad things and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Thus, people around him are careful not to offend him in any way. He knows deception well enough not to easily trust people around him, including his sons. *Carme Sanchez as Delia Dela Cruz - The loving mother of Ella, she is serene and eternally optimistic. She is very capable when it comes to raising her family. She will do everything for them. Very calm, altruistic, and a woman with wisdom.

The Salt War of 1540 was a result of an insurrection by the city of Perugia against the Papal States during the pontificate of Pope Paul III (Alessandro Farnese). The principal result was the city of Perugia's definitive subordination to papal control. History Perugia had been a free commune until 1370, when it was de jure incorporated into the Papal States. The Perugian elite continued to enjoy a sort of semi-autonomy, including several privileges like trial by a local (not papal-appointed) judge and freedom from paying any taxes on salt, then an important product for preserving food. Beginning in the late 15th century, successive popes attempted to rein in Perugian autonomy, despite resistance by the Perugians. This came to a head after a disastrous harvest in 1539, which drove up prices in Perugia and its rural hinterland. In this already economically difficult situation, Pope Paul III decided to levy a new tax on salt for all his subjects. This violated treaties between Perugia and previous popes, treaties which Paul III had confirmed at the beginning of his pontificate, but Perugian protests were to no avail. The Perugians decided to rebel but on 4 June 1540 papal troops, led by the pope's son Pierluigi Farnese and his condottiere Alessandro da Terni, forced a surrender. Shortly thereafter, an enormous fortress, the Rocca Paolina (Pauline Fortress), was constructed on the plans designed by Antonio and Aristotele da Sangallo. Built not to protect Perugia but, in Julius III's words, \\"to slow down the burning of the Perugians and get rid of the opportunity to rebel against the Holy See,\\" the fort was for centuries a symbol of oppressive papal rule. Despite the fact that a later Pope, Julius III, gave the Perugians back a semblance of local rule in 1559, the city became part of the Papal States and remained so until Italian unification in 1860. One curious note about the war is that Perugian legend holds that as part of a popular protest against the new papal tax in 1540, citizens stopped putting salt in their bread (unsalted bread is the norm to this day). Recent research suggests that this is an urban legend developed after 1860. See also *Papal States *Perugia Bibliography *M. Symonds, The Story of Perugia, J.M. Dent & Sons, London, 1912. *L.

Several ancient sources (including Sidonius Apollinaris, Datius, and, more recently, Andrea Alciato)Claudio Beretta, Letteratura dialettale milanese, Ulrico Hoepli, pp. 21-26; see have argued that the scrofa semilanuta is connected to the etymology of the ancient name of Milan, \\"Mediolanum\\", and this is still occasionally mentioned in modern sources, although this interpretation has long been dismissed by scholars. The adoption of the half-woolly sow as an emblem of Milan is associated to a legend about the foundation of the city. According to this legend (which partially draws from Livy's writings), the founder of Milan was a Gaul prince named Belloveso. Belloveso reached the Po Valley following a vision he had had in a dream, where a goddess showed him the place where the city would rise. In this dream, he saw a sow with unusually long wool on the front half of its body. Other ancient sources (most notably the aforementioned Alciato, who in turns credits Ambrose for his account) report that the half-woolly sow is actually a sort of \\"chimera\\" ‚Äî half boar and half ram ‚Äî and that the emblem came about when the Bituriges and the Aedui, having as their emblems a ram and a boar respectively, joined in the Po Valley. The origin of the legend of scrofa semilanuta and the circumstances of its adoption as an emblem of Milan are a very controversial matter for scholars. A key element of this controversy is a bas relief affixed to the walls of the Palazzo della Ragione, former \\"broletto\\" (administrative building) of the medieval commune of Milan. The bas relief is reportedly a medieval copy of an older one, found during the excavations when the Palazzo was built (1228-1233). It has been argued that the legend of the scrofa semilanuta, in its current form, might have come about as a consequence of that particular finding as well as the patriotic enthusiasm for the newly conquered independence of Milan as a commune, elaborating on the old legends about the etymology of \\"Mediolanum\\".Scrofa semilanuta mediolanense The bas relief itself might just represent a boar, which in turn was a very common emblem in Western Europe. In any case, the \\"scrofa semilanuta\\" was thereafter adopted as the main emblem of Milan, at least until the advent of the biscione of the House of Visconti. Another (more recent) representation of the \\"scrofa semilanuta\\" is found in the internal courtyard of Palazzo Marino (Milan's city hall).

Use Lithium 12-hydroxystearate exhibits high oxidation stability and a dropping point up to around 200 ¬∞C. Most greases used today in motor vehicles, aircraft, and heavy machinery contain lithium stearates, mainly lithium 12-hydroxystearate. Greases can be made with the addition of several different metallic soaps. Some greases are prepared from sodium, barium, lithium, and calcium soaps. Lithium soap greases are preferred for their water resistance, and their oxidative and mechanical stability. Depending on the grease, they also have good performance at high or low temperatures, but not both. Production To produce lithium 12-hydroxystearate, lithium hydroxide and the fatty acid are combined in an aqueous medium. With vigorous stirring, dilute monohydrate lithium hydroxide is gradually added to a dispersion of the fatty acid in water heated to slightly below boiling.Angelo Nora, Alfred Szczepanek, Gunther Koenen, \\"Metallic Soaps\\" in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005 Wiley- VCH, Weinheim. Since these lithium soaps are difficult to filter, they are collected by spray drying.

The synthetic oils are preferred for their greater stability and ability to perform at extreme temperatures. The 12-hydroxystearic acid is prepared by the hydrogenation of castor oil. After primary reaction of the saturation of most of the double bonds, dehydration and reduction of the hydroxyl group leads to the stearic acid.

The main theme of the book is how the American administrations of the 2010s will need to create regional power balances, some of which have been disturbed. Friedman conceptualizes America's successful management of world affairs not by directly enforcing countries, but by creating competing relationships, which offset one another, in the world's different regions. For example, in the past, Iraq balanced Iran, and currently Japan balances China. Friedman asserts this is the decade where the US as a power must mature to manage its power and balance as an unintended empire and republic. Arguments of the book=Europe Friedman argues that confrontation between Russia and NATO, particularly the United States, is inevitable, and that in particular, the US must ally with Poland and try to block an accommodation between Germany and Russia. He argues that the US must essentially abandon the Baltic states and Georgia, as they are liabilities rather than assets, and allow Russia to reassert its influence in exchange for maximum concessions from Russia, allowing Turkey to counterbalance Russia in the Caucasus. According to Friedman, the new confrontation will be nothing like the Cold War, as Russia is vulnerable and cannot sustain a major role in international affairs in the long run due to its population and infrastructural problems. Middle East Friedman advocates that the United States draw back from Israel, which is strategically secure, fully capable of surviving on its own, and is no longer heavily dependent on the US, and slightly re-orient towards Arab states to create a balance of power. He also advocates a deal with Iran which would essentially allow it a secure sphere of influence in the region and an alliance with Turkey to counterbalance Iran and Israel. Friedman argues that while Israel's position is secure due to a balance of power between its Arab neighbors, including alliances with some of them, the main danger it faces is intervention of or alienation from major powers over the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, and that it must manage the conflict prudently. Asia Friedman argues that China faces long-term economic problems due to its having a producer economy that cannot be sustained by its impoverished population, and as other sources of cheap labor arise, it will have to increase internal security, and tax its wealthy coastal regions to transfer the resources to its impoverished interior. The Chinese government will end up being preoccupied with trying to hold the country together and prevent fragmentation, and in the long run, China risks fragmentation into autonomous regions. Meanwhile, Japan will continue its strategic relationship with the United States. At the same time, its aging and declining population, coupled with the social inability of its population to tolerate large-scale immigration, will mean that it will increasingly exploit labor markets in other parts of the world, even in China. According to Friedman, the United States will have to check Japan's rising power, and will do this by providing economic benefits to China to ensure it stays stable and can check Japanese power, in addition to allying with South Korea, and give it generous economic benefits and financial assistance to absorb North Korea when reunification inevitably comes so as to cement ties, while maintaining a cordial relationship with Japan and continue guaranteeing its access to raw materials through the sea lanes to prevent a massive Japanese military buildup. The United States will also need to build up strategic alliances with South Korea, Australia, and Singapore to secure its domination of the western Pacific. In addition, the United States will withdraw from Afghanistan, and the Taliban will regain control of the country. US support for Pakistan will continue. Pakistan will contain the Taliban and counter a rising India. In particular, US military aid to Pakistan will continue, keeping Indian military planners focused on their army and air force rather than the navy, preventing India from building sufficient sea power to replace the US Navy as the dominant naval force in the region. Africa The book argues that Africa will continue to suffer from wars due to the irrationality of its borders, which were drawn by colonial powers, which do not take into account tribal and ethnic loyalties. According to Friedman, Africa will gradually reshape itself into a continent of stable nations, including a few major powers, and that the best policy is to simply leave Africa alone and provide humanitarian assistance, and allow the continent's borders to be gradually rearranged through warfare. The Americas Friedman argues that the United States is secure in its hemisphere, with the only immediate pressing issues being the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants from Mexico, which will continue, and relations with Cuba, which the United States will have to accommodate and cut a deal with. Other than that, what happens in the Americas is of marginal importance, although Brazil has the potential to be a future challenger to the United States.

Columbia River service Otter was built in Portland, Oregon, in 1874 by Fred Congdon. Congdon reused the machinery that had previously been installed in the Mary Belle, which he had dismantled and traded to G.W. Hume for use as a wharf. Congdon made the trial trip of the Otter on March 28, 1874. He intended to run the Otter on the lower Columbia River, in connection with business allies who had built the Teaser to run on the middle Columbia, above the Cascades Rapids. Although both Otter and Teaser were both too small to be very competitive, this plan still was perceived by the Oregon Steam Navigation Company to be threat to the monopoly which they were seeking to maintain on Columbia River transportation, and so they purchased both Otter and Teaser, and arranged to have them sent to Puget Sound in 1875.McCurdy Marine History, p. 25. Transfer to Puget Sound On Puget Sound, Otter was first used to tow barges for the Renton Coal Company, and was later run by the Starr brothers in the upper sound in opposition to the steamers Zephyr and Messenger. In 1877, the Starrs accepted a monthly payment of $500 to refrain from competing with Zephyr and Messenger, and the vessel was as a result reassigned to the run between Olympia and Tacoma, Washington. In 1881, the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, under Henry Villard bought out the Starr Line and all their steamers including Otter.Newell, Inland Sea, pp. 80-83. Otter is reported to have been worked for one season on the Stikine River in British Columbia. Otter was used as a trading steamer until February 1890, when the vessel was involved in a collision in Puget Sound off Des Moines with the sternwheeler Hassalo. Otter sustained substantial damage but was successfully beached with no lives lost. Otter was owned at the time of the collision by Captain T. Cook of Tacoma. Repairs were made however, and Otter was returned to service until 1897, when it was abandoned on the Puyallup River.

The film is a sequel to the 2005 sleeper hit, Kyaa Kool Hai Hum and the second installment of Kyaa Kool Hain Hum film series. The movie stars Ritesh Deshmukh and Tusshar Kapoor from the original cast. It released on 27 July 2012, and received mostly negative to mixed response. With good box office collections, the film was declared \\"Super-Hit\\". Plot The story revolves around Siddharth ‚ÄúSid‚Äù Rana (Riteish Deshmukh) and Aditya ‚ÄúAdi‚Äù Chopra (Tusshar Kapoor) who are roommates and good friends. Adi is a struggling actor, whilst Sid is a struggling DJ who admires his own dog Sakkru more than himself. Adi and Sid manage to meet ends by offering Sakkru for mating in dog breeding centres where Sakkru mates with female dogs of his breed on a specific music played by Sid. Adi falls in love with Simran Singhania (Neha Sharma) who works at a call-center. Adi proposes Simran for marriage but she refuses and lies to him of being a lesbian, while Sid falls for Anuradha ‚ÄúAnu‚Äù Marlo (Sarah Jane Dias) whom he meets at a fashion show. Then Anu and Simran go to Goa to meet Anu's father, Francis Marlo (Anupam Kher) who has gone mad ever since the death of his mother. In Goa, Baba 3G (Chunky Pandey), a conman posing as a priest tells Marlo that his dead mother, Rosemary Marlo, has been reincarnated into a female dog. When Adi and Sid, along with Sakkru, follow the girls to Goa, Sid meets Marlo where Sakkru copulates with the female dog, Rosemary. Marlo then believes that the dog is not his mother as her mother was so pure. However, Baba 3G, who is skeptical to lose his business, tells Marlo that his father, Michael Marlo, has been reincarnated too as Sakkru, and then Sakkru is kidnapped by Marlo. Sid comes to rescue Sakkru where Marlo offers Sid to host the New Year's Eve Party as the DJ and takes Sakkru. Adi mistakes Anu to be the partner of Simran and tells Sid about it. Both get heartbroken and decide to leave Goa with Sakkru. Later, Marlo decides to get Rosemary and Sakkru married. Adi receives a message from Simran that she has a confession to make and wishes to meet him. When Adi and Sid reach Marlo's mansion, they misundertand the message passed by the security and assumes that Simran and Anu are getting married forcefully by Marlo. They both reach the venue of marriage, where Simran tells Adi that she is not a lesbian and loves him resulting in both to reunite. Sid with intent to take Sakkru back plays the music on which Sakkru runs on a mating spree in the function. A police inspector at the venue recognizes Baba 3G as a criminal and arrests him. The film ends with marriage of Adi with Simran, Sid's with Anu and Sakkru's with Rosemary.

One would call the film clumsy, had it not been funny. But humorous it is, even if in parts. Worth a watch, if you're not very high-brow or prudish when it comes to humour.\\" Martin D'Souza of Glamsham gave 3/5 stars, commenting that \\"Ceetis and taalis are bound to accompany a few scenes and the first three days will tell if it has crossed the Rs 100-crore mark, which I'm afraid it might.\\" Madhureeta Mukherjee of Times of India gave the movie 3/5 stars, stating that \\"If you were sex (comedy) starved after Kyaa Kool Hai Hum, this sequel force- feeds you a double dose. This one's for teens who get a 'boner' out of bad jokes, but it may get a rise out of some adults too. Watch at your own 'risque'.\\" Mansha Rastogi of Now Running gave the movie 2.5/5 stars, saying that \\"To sum it up, Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum makes for a time pass one time watch. However, if for a better second half, the film would've worked more!\\" Roshni Devi of Koimoi gave 2.5/5 stars, concluding that \\"Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum has some laughs, which may be enough for the producers to laugh their way to the bank.\\" Vinayak Chakravorthy of India Today gave the movie 2.5/5 stars, stating that \\"Director Sachin Yardi almost deliberately plays dumb with his narrative. His effort is a randy, satirical punch on almost every trick that defines Bollywood's 100-crore club. The film makes you snigger, and then you snigger at yourself for doing as much at something so obviously silly and raunchy. You realise there is reason behind the mindless mayhem that just unfolded before your eyes as the end credits roll. It's called box-office moolah, and this film is going to make lots of it.\\" Kunal Guha of Yahoo! gave the movie 2/5 stars, commenting that \\"'Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum' is surely a school of sickeningly dirty jokes that will shock, disgust and scandalize but ensure that you have a good time. So don't leave your brains (or any other organs) at home, you will need it to dig out the implied meaning in every line.\\" Aniruddha Guha of DNA India gave the movie 2/5 stars, saying that \\"Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum amuses you intermittently but largely leaves your brains in a tangle, and the mind gasping for breath. In other words, dimaag ki macho deta hai.\\" Deboshree Ghosh of Bollywood Life gave the movie 2/5 stars, concluding that \\"We would have had thought of giving this film a thumbs-up if Tusshar Kapoor had not shown off his rear in the film, supposedly imitating John Abraham in Dostana. That simply made us pucker our lips and turn our noses up in extreme distaste. Ew!\\" Shomini Sen of Zee News gave the movie 2/5 stars, stating that \\"KSKHH is an assault to your brain to say the least. But we know you will watch it nevertheless. After all don't we go to the movies to get entertained and not take on more stress? Go on, watch it but do carry a bottle of painkillers with you. Might come in handy later.\\" Anupama Chopra of Hindustan Times gave 1.5/5 stars, commenting that \\"Writer-director Sachin Yardi is too lazy to create a plot, so the film is just a series of gags that allow him to bung in as many puerile sexual innuendos as possible. Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum becomes a drag within the first twenty minutes and then continues for another two hours or so.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 1.5/5 stars, saying that \\"I'm going with one-and-a-half out of five for 'Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum'. It's not that the humor's adult that is the issue here, it's that it doesn't make you laugh!\\" Mayank Shekhar of Daily Bhaskar gave the movie 1.5/5 stars, stating that \\"All the humour is in the lines. The dialogue writer of this film is a decent chutkula writer, suited best for stand-up comedies or hasya kavitas. You know at some point the jokes will dry up. They'll start exhausting you with their only meaning; let alone the double meaning. The film will lose energy too, given there wasn't much of a plot to keep it going for this long.\\" Raja Sen of Rediff gave the movie 1.5/5 stars, stating that \\"Sachin Yardi's Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum is, an A-rated film that feels the need to shy away from swearwords and put big, forbidding 'Adults' stickers onto even copulating canines. The film wants to be racy, but has television-friendliness forced onto its very being: which explains actors dropping their jaws at the (suggested) mention of genitalia and constantly hiding behind clumsy innuendo.\\" Blessy Chettiar of DNA India gave the movie 1/5 stars, commenting that \\"Tawdry innuendos, racial slurs, repugnant gibes at the gay community and overall cheap humour define the 'kool' of KSKHH. Sorry boss, we define our own cool, and KSKHH figures nowhere close.\\" Karan Anshuman of Mumbai Mirror gave 1/5 stars, saying that \\"There are sex comedies. Then there are bad sex comedies. Then there is just bad. And then finally ‚Äì right at the bottom of this pile ‚Äì there is KSKHH. It has innuendos so obvious, swearing so uninhibited, and gestures so lewd, that you can only imagine what must be going on in the writers' minds to distill this from their imaginations.\\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the movie 1/5 stars, concluding that \\"Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum strives very hard indeed to be a worthy adult comedy, a poor Indian country cousin of American Pie, but all it manages to be is a juvenile and clunky ride through unending yards of the kind of laboured gags that went out of vogue with Dada Kondke. The film is ostensibly targeted at the teen segment and it might even find some takers there. But it barely passes muster as a sex comedy. It's crude, crass and completely clueless.\\" Janhavi Samant of Mid-Day gave the movie 0.5/5 stars, stating that \\"The whole film is pretty much avoidable. Neither vulgar enough to denounce, nor gross enough to outrage, nor absurd enough to be funny, just plain indifferent and insipid.\\" Subhash K Jha of Indicine gave the movie 0/5 stars, commenting that \\"So is risque sexy? Is raunchy cool? You decide. As far as I am concerned I am still too numbed by the ceaseless torrent of verbal obscenity to figure out if a barrage of dirty puns and phallic objects being stuck into every conceivable hole, strung together in a succession of gags and episodes can be called a film.\\" Soundtrack \\"Dil Garden Garden Ho Gaya\\" was composed by Sachin - Jigar and written by Mayur Puri, while the rest of all songs are by Meet Bros Anjjan.

Dedicated in 1986, the fountain is a kinetic sculpture, the work of the Israeli artist Yaacov Agam.  Description  The fountain was developed by Agam for ten years and is one of Agam's most famous creations. Agam has gained international recognition as one of the founders of the kinetic art movement. The fountain consists of an illusory dimension and a movement dimension, both typical to works of Kinetic art and Op art, which is achieved by the use of technology and by the observer's movement. The fountain is composed of several big jagged wheels, which were designed in the kinetic style (colored geometric shapes, which are perceived as different images from different angles). A technological mechanism is automatically activated at different times of the day and the night, turning the wheels on their hinges, injecting water upwards in various forms, spitting fire upwards and playing music.

It had an estimated magnitude of between 5 and 6 and a maximum intensity of IX or X on the Mercalli intensity scale. The towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum were severely damaged. The earthquake may have been a precursor to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, which destroyed the same two towns. The contemporary philosopher and dramatist Seneca the Younger wrote an account of the earthquake in the sixth book of his Naturales quaestiones, entitled De Terrae Motu (Concerning Earthquakes). Geological setting The epicentre of the earthquake lies within a zone of active extensional faulting, but close to the southern flank of Vesuvius. Analysis of focal mechanisms from the area around Vesuvius indicates that active faulting in the area involves NW‚ÄìSE and NE‚ÄìSW trending oblique-slip normal faults and E‚ÄìW trending normal faults, part of the zone of active extension that extends the full length of the Apennines mountain chain, associated with continued opening of the Tyrrhenian Sea. An association between earthquakes in the central Apennines and eruptions of Vesuvius has been proposed, but is not yet proven. Characteristics The extent of damage has been used to estimate the magnitude of the earthquake. Estimates lie in the range from about 5 to 6.1. The maximum felt intensity is estimated to have been in the range IX to X, and the area of highest intensity was elongated roughly WNW‚ÄìESE. Shaking was reported to have continued for several days, presumably referring to a sequence of aftershocks. The focal depth is estimated to have been in the range 5‚Äì6 km. Damage The towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum both suffered major damage, with damage to some buildings also reported from Naples and Nuceria. Seneca reported the death of a flock of 600 sheep that he attributed to the effects of poisonous gases. Aftermath The damage caused by the mainshock and the subsequent series of tremors was at least partly repaired in both Pompeii and Herculaneum by the time of the AD 79 eruption. A pair of bas-reliefs, probably from the lararium in the house of Lucius Caecilius Iucundus in Pompeii, are interpreted as depicting the effects of the earthquake on structures including the Temple of Jupiter, the Aquarium of Cesar, and the Vesuvius Gate. The earthquake led Roman philosopher, statesman and dramatist Seneca the Younger to devote the sixth book of his Naturales quaestiones to the subject of earthquakes, describing the event of 5 February and giving the cause of earthquakes as the movement of air.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in the grounds of Knowlton Court. History St Clement's dates from the 14th or the 15th century. It was originally the private chapel to Knowlton Court, and later a parish church. It was restored in 1855 by William White. Most of the windows date from this restoration. The church was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 1 December 1991. It is open daily for visitors. However during July 5th, Richard maintains its existence. Architecture The church is constructed in flint and has a tiled roof. Its plan is simple, consisting of a nave and a chancel. At the west end is a bellcote. On the summits of the gables and the bellcote are cross finials. At the corners of the church, and at the junctions of the nave and chancel, are buttresses. In the west wall is a clock face. Internally there is a plastered barrel roof. On the east wall of the church are a piscina and two niches. The pulpit is in 17th-century style, but probably dates from the 20th century. It is octagonal, and decorated with arcaded panels and a strapwork frieze. The font, the box pews, the corona lucis, the two reading desks, and other fittings date from the 19th century. Monuments Over the north door are the carved and painted royal arms of Charles II. There is a hatchment in the chancel. The stained glass dates from the 1850s and 1860s and is by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake. The church also contains monuments to members of the families who lived in Knowlton Court, including the Peyton Baronets. Later residents of the house were the Narborough family. There is a memorial to Admiral Sir John Narborough who died in 1688, and to his sons John and James who, together with their stepfather Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell, died in a shipwreck off the Scilly Islands in 1707. The latter memorial has been attributed to Grinling Gibbons. External features The churchyard wall, which dates partly from the early 18th century and partly from the early 20th century, is listed at Grade II. It consists of a red brick wall with simple wrought iron gates. On the gate piers are ball finials.

The couple married in 1707, despite the fact that Eberhard thereby committed bigamy, being already married. From 1710, the couple lived in Ludwigsburg, while the wife of Eberhard Louis lived in Stuttgart. Gr√§venitz was politically active and was from 1717 until 1731 a full member of the secret government cabinet, which ruled the state. In 1731 the relationship was ended by Eberhard, and the year after, Gr√§venitz was given a pension and left W√ºrttemberg. Early life Wilhelmine von Gr√§venitz was born on 4 February 1684 in Schwerin into the , a small German noble family with connections all over the Holy Roman Empire. In particular, Wilhelmine's father Hans Friedrich was the Hofmarschall of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow, her sister Eleonore was a confidante of Sophia Louise, Queen of Prussia, and her brother was a councilor to Eberhard Louis, Duke of W√ºrttemberg. As Friedrich Wilhelm had no roots in W√ºrttemberg, his career depended on the Duke's goodwill. To secure his position, he invited Wilhelmine to the court of W√ºrttemberg. Friedrich Wilhelm's desire to pair his sister with the Duke was supported by Hofmeister and by Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of nearby Hohenzollern-Hechingen. Their motives for that support are unknown, though their designs were frustrated when Wilhelmine contracted smallpox and her trip to W√ºrttemberg had to be delayed by a year.  Arrival in W√ºrttemberg  Wilheimine finally arrived in W√ºrttemberg in 1706, escorted by Staffhorst, and received from him the proper attire and accouterments for appearing at court. At the time, Eberhard Louis was pursuing a Madame von Geyling, but Wilhelmine and the Duke would eventually meet and began a relationship. She would not only replace von Geyling, but the Duke's legitimate wife, Duchess Johanna Elisabeth of Baden-Durlach. Eberhard Louis had no love for his wife and viewed his relationship with Wilhelmine as legitimate, but conducted his romance with her publicly and once forced her to respect another of the Duke's extramarital affairs.

The project was started in 2009 and involves the construction of six houses in five countries across Europe. Each building in the project is designed to reflect and respond to the different climatic, cultural and architectural conditions of the countries in which they are built. After completion the houses are open to the public during a test period of 6‚Äì12 months after which they are sold. Each house is monitored during the test period to learn how the experiments turn out in real-life conditions. The learnings will be shared openly with other projects, industry experts and contractors to create synergy effects in the building industry's effort to come up with solutions for sustainable buildings. The houses in Denmark were built in 2009, those in Germany and Austria were built in 2010 and those in the UK and France are scheduled for completion in 2011. Background The Active House Alliancehttp://www.activehouse.info/ has developed a set of principles for \\"active house\\" construction, which focuses on achieving a balance between energy, indoor climate and the environment. The model home 2020 project is in full accordance with the active house principles. The project is backed by the VELUX Group in cooperation with multiple local and regional governments, suppliers, architects, engineers and researchers. The model home 2020 project tests how the active house principles perform under real-life conditions. The knowledge derived from the projects will be documented and used to take an active part in developing sustainable buildings. The projects * Experiment # 1 Home for Life in Denmark built in 2009. Home for Life is a visionary proposal for the family home of the future.https://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/buildings/denmarks-netzeroenergy- home/0 The building is the result of an interdisciplinary project to incorporate the issues of energy consumption, comfort and visual appeal into a holistic entity, with these parameters being mutually complementary and maximising quality of life in the home and the world around it. * Experiment # 2 Green Lighthouse in Denmark built in 2009. Green Lighthouse is Denmark's first public carbon-neutral building. It was developed in a strategic partnership between the University of Copenhagen,http://greenlighthouse.ku.dk/ the VELUX Group, VELFAC, the Danish University and Property Agency and the Municipality of Copenhagen. The underlying vision of the project is to erect a beacon showing the way towards climate-neutral buildings of the future that provide the best indoor climate with masses of daylight and fresh air to the benefit of the residents' health and comfort. * Experiment # 3 Sunlighthouse in Austria built in 2010. Sunlighthouse will be Austria's first carbon- neutral, single-family home. The vision is to build a house with exciting and appealing architecture focusing on the sloping roof. The house must be generally affordable and therefore meet certain specifications of dimensions, material and appearance. Sunlighthouse provides an exceptionally high proportion of daylight and will achieve a positive energy balance by reducing its overall energy consumption and by using renewable energy.http://www.boerse-express.com/cat/pages/856306/fullstory/ * Experiment # 4 LichtAktiv Haus in Germany built in 2010. LichtAktiv Haus is the first CO2-neutral modernisation of a so-called Siedlerhaus, a semi-detached house from the 1950s located in the Wilhelmsburg district of Hamburg http://www.detail.de/artikel_velux-lichtaktiv_27976_De.htm The innovative modernisation strategy combines maximum liveability with optimum energy efficiency. The once tight and closed structure of the building has been transformed into spacious rooms with high levels of daylight, providing occupants with the best living comfort. Natural ventilation ensures a healthy indoor climate. The goal now is self-sufficiency in energy. * Experiment # 5 CarbonLight Homes in UK opened during 2011. CarbonLight homes are the first new home http://www.whatgreenhome.com/news/anatomy_of_a_zero- carbon_home_7.html in the UK designed and built to the new UK Government definition of zero carbon.http://www.zerocarbonhub.org/ They are designed to be real homes for real people with construction techniques suitable for use by mass house builders. CarbonLight Homes use nature in an intelligent way to maximise daylight and encourage a sustainable lifestyle. The design is open plan and incorporates high levels of daylight and natural ventilation intended to minimise energy consumption among residents and generate a sense of community. The homes show that common-sense design can be used to create inspirational sustainable houses that can be easily replicated by UK house builders. * Experiment # 6 Maison Air et Lumi√®re in France opened during 2011. Maison Air et Lumi√®re is a new generation of active homes that puts the quality of life of its inhabitants at the centre of its environmental approach. The unique features of the house lie in intelligent use of the sloping roof to combine well-being and energy efficiency. The architectural concept http://www.construiresamaison.com/maison-ecologique/maison- bbc/bioclimatique-optimiser-sa-construction/toit-actif-velux-a6423/ is based on different roof pitches that increase its ability to capture sunlight, making it an energy-positive home. The challenges The European Union (EU) has adopted a comprehensive package for European energy policy up to 2020.http://ec.europa.eu/energy/index_en.htm It entails EU member states reducing their total energy consumption and CO2 emissions by 20 percent. Moreover, all EU member states must show that 20 percent of their total energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources. According to EU statistics: * People in the EU spend 90 percent of the time indoors. * Buildings consume more than 40 percent of the EU's total energy consumption. * Up to 30 percent of the buildings within the EU do not provide a healthy indoor climate.

On 10 June 2017, Hakkarainen was elected the Second Vice Chairman of the Finns Party. He served in the position until December 2017, when Hakkarainen resigned the post after he had sexually harassed fellow MP.  Views and comments = Sexual minorities  In May 2011, Hakkarainen was talking to junior high school students. When some students asked Hakkarainen's opinion about gay adoptions, he told students that \\"if two gays have a child, the child would become a double gay\\", and said that he did so jokingly because he would rather answer questions regarding government talks. In October 2011, Hakkarainen told the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat that homosexuals, lesbians and Somalis ought to be deported to the √Öland Islands to form their own society.  Death penalty  On 16 December 2015, a member of Finnish Parliament, a member of Finns Party, Hakkarainen inquired Minister of Justice, also member of the same party, if capital punishment could be re-enacted, referring to the court case against two asylum seekers. They were suspected of 11 murders committed with terrorist intent in Iraq, but were released.  Racism  In April 2011, Hakkarainen openly expressed his opinions towards black people and Muslims in an interview with Helsingin Sanomat. During the interview Hakkarainen used a pejorative word neekeriukko (which translates to male \\"negro\\" or \\"nigger\\" and is considered as an offensive racial slur). He also made a mocking imitation of the Islamic call to prayer. The Ombudsman for Minorities of Finland, Eva Biaudet, asked the Prosecutor General of Finland to investigate if Hakkarainen may be guilty in some crimes according to the criminal codex for example incitement to ethnic or racial hatred. Later The Finnish Police announced that they did not feel that comments made by Hakkarainen give cause for a criminal investigation. Police proposed to the Prosecutor General that no criminal investigation should be launched, saying that Hakkarainen‚Äôs comments were an exercise of free speech, and not hate speech. Hakkarainen defended his statements by claiming that he comes from a rural background.http://www.kauppalehti.fi/5/i/mobiili/kl_mobiili/uutinen.jsp?oid=20110572661 In January 2017, Hakkarainen was convicted of incitement against an ethnic group.  2017 sexual harassment case  In December 2017, Hakkarainen assaulted MP Veera Ruoho in the parliament house.

History  The choir was founded as the singing section of a tourist association known as Die Naturfreunde - Vereinigte Kletterabteilungen Sachsen/VKA in Dresden's Keglerheim. Its first director was Kurt Lauterbach and its first concert took place on 14 February 1928. The Saxon Mountaineers' Choir has borne the name Kurt Schlosser since 10 September 1949. Schlosser, born in 1900, was himself a member of the VKA. During the Nazi era the choir was banned and many choir members performed illegally. Several climbers and members of the choir organised the Red Climbers under the direction of Kurt Schlosser in various Dresden factories as part of anti-Fascist resistance. The Red Climbers (roten Bergsteiger) established themselves in Saxon Switzerland in a rock cave near the rock of the Satanskopf as a secret office and hiding place. After being arrested on 3 December 1943 Kurt Schlosser was sentenced to the guillotine on 16 August 1944. Other climbers and choir members also became victims of Nazism.

Discovery and survey The site was discovered in 2004 through finds of Bronze Age and Neolithic materials and three megalithic monuments as part of a survey by a combined project that commenced as a partnership of the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory, Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums in Syria, the Mila and Fontanals Institution of the Higher Council for Scientific Research (Barcelona) and the International Institute for Prehistoric Research in the University of Cantabria (Santander). Scientific direction was carried out jointly by Dr. Michel Al-Maqdisi (Directorate of Antiquities and Museums of Syria), Dr. Maya Ha√Ødar Boustani (Museum Lebanese Prehistory, LSU) and Dr. Juan Jos√© Iba√±ez (Mila and Fontanals Institution). Excavations The site was badly damaged in 2007 by new work done with flattening bulldozers; only the eastern part of one tell mound remained, with another cut in two, one of the megalithic monuments had been completely destroyed in the process. Seven small soundings were taken in total, three hitting bedrock between ten and thirty centimeters, it was suggested that this could have been the result of recent demolition of the land for a plantation by a bulldozer. The four other soundings hit architectural remains. Sounding FC82 revealed a foundation wall almost one meter wide formed by layers of basalt boulders. Similar boulders were found to the west may indicate the existence of another wall perpendicular to the first. Bronze Age pottery along with a serrated sickle were found at this sounding and the walls and blocks suggested a rectangular building. Sounding CA72 was taken in an area of 3 x 1 m where the surface layer suggested a mud wall, almost one meter wide in an east‚Äìwest direction. The wall was preserved to a height of 1 cm. South of the wall was a bed of stones suggested to be a floor. This area was excavated and another floor found ten centimeters lower than the first made of large basalt stones with diameters ranging from twenty to thirty centimeters. The wall and the lower floor were suggested to be different layers of occupation, the walls for the first were not found. Beneath this, sandy black earth was found where the excavation was halted. Bronze Age pottery and flint were collected and a fragment of a bronze object in the first level wall. Sounding BQ97 excavated an area of 4 x 4 m. The surface was covered with a heap of stones which examination suggested was due to clearing of the fields for agriculture. The remains of a wall were found under this rockpile, again approximately one meter wide. This was another foundation wall following a northwest to southeast direction, formed by two layers of large blocks of basalt. The presence of two aligned blocks southwest of the wall may indicate another perpendicular to the first. Pottery recovered was dated to the Bronze Age and obsidian was found in this area including twelve carved pieces. Sounding CQ87 was again a 4 x 4 m excavation which revealed a floor very near the surface that was semi-circular in shape and made of basalt stones with a diameter of approximately 10 cm. No walls were found but beneath these slabs was found another surface formed of flat tiled stones which are suggested to be two separate Bronze Age layers. Bronze Age pottery was found along with a large number of worked flints and some obsidian. Lower still the team found another layer of architecture that they tentatively date to the Neolithic, this consisted of a dirt floor bounded by three walls that had been beaten until leveled. The walls drew a rectangular plan. Some stones formed a circle in the west of the building suggested a post hole in the dirt floor. The structure seemed to be part of a rectangular house oriented in an east‚Äìwest axis. The post hole was an equal distance from both long walls which are built directly on bedrock which is a natural layer of altered basalt. Neolithic pottery of this level is made by hand and is very coarse with simple straight or sometimes ovoid form and notable for its lack of decor. Three parts of a sickle were found and a fragment of an Amuq point arrowhead, showing signs of having been made hastily. One piece of obsidian was found in between the Bronze Age and Neolithic levels. Analysis and conclusions The pottery is quite eroded and the bone is not preserved. The remains of flint evoke a very expeditious technology. There was an abundance of pieces of pressure carved obsidian that were used as tools. In addition, presence of maintenance products and splinters found with pieces indicates that this was worked on site. The relative importance of obsidian as stone tool material suggests the existence of a procurement network and distribution of this material from the Anatolian sources. Neolithic levels have been documented at the bottom of the CQ87 sounding. This has levelled architecture where part of 3 m wide rectangular house was documented, its length was not determined. A layer of stones was found at the base of wall, indoor clay floors and a possible post hole. The archaeological material of this level has some similarities to those of Al Wakara 1 (H122) and Wadi Qawyak (H130), located in the basalt plain further east. Site conservation and potential demolition Tell Ezou is located in a basaltic region with road access from Khirbat Al Hamam, where a well-preserved Bronze Age and Neolithic site awaits a more extensive excavation. It is difficult to classify or schedule as a monument and is situated on private land. The owners were very understanding and the team very well received by the locals during their surveys. They, however, expressed their interest to turn the archaeological site into an olive plantation or wheat field. This may be his choice but he will have to clear the ancient blocks of basalt left over from prehistory, an obvious risk to the site, but at least Doctor Boustani's team has recorded something here for local, regional and global heritage.

Biography  Though born and raised in G√∂rlitz, Foerster never saw himself a Lusatian and felt the strongest allegiance to Silesia, where he studied since winter term 1861 after a semester at Jena. In Breslau he dropped theology and concentrated on classics in a comprehensive way. Apart from Greek and Roman literature (under Jacob Bernays and Martin Hertz) he studied metrics under Rudolf Westphal, archaeology under August Rossbach, Sanskrit under Adolf Friedrich Stenzler. His doctoral thesis was inspired by Friedrich Haase and dealt with a phaenomenon in Greek grammar called attractio casus. From 1866 on Foerster worked as a substitute teacher at the Maria-Magdalenen-Gymnasium in Breslau. After being promoted to Dr. phil. in 1866 and earning the venia legendi via habilitation in 1868, Foerster was granted the Travel Stipend of the German Archaeological Institute. The next two years he spent in Italy, mostly Rome, where he met many foreign scholars, collated manuscripts and laid the foundation for what was to become his life's work: critical editions of the physiognomists and of the works of Libanius. Back at Breslau, Foerster juggled four different tasks: Teaching elementary Latin und Greek at the gymnasium, holding lectures and seminars at the university, proceeding with his scientific studies and propagating ancient culture in the Schlesische Gesellschaft f√ºr vaterl√§ndische Kultur (\\"Silesian Society for Patriotic Culture\\"). He eventually resigned from his school position when he was offered an extraordinary chair at the university in 1873. In 1875, Foerster accepted a chair at the University of Rostock where he worked as third Professor of Classical Philology besides Ludwig Bachmann and Franz Volkmar Fritzsche. Despite being constantly challenged by Fritzsche's difficult personality, Foerster soon came to enjoy his work as professor in Rostock. He was glad about his students which came to admire him in return. His scientific studies were prolongated by the small and outdated library. After acting as Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy in 1879/1880 Foerster went on a research travel to England, Spain, and France (funded by the Prussian Academy of Sciences), where he collated manuscripts and started his third opus magnum, the collection of the orations of Choricius of Gaza which were partly unedited at the time. Soon after his return to Rostock, Foerster was called to a chair at Kiel. In Kiel he had a bigger library at his disposal and more students to teach than in Rostock. Relations to his colleagues Peter Wilhelm Forchhammer and Friedrich Blass were complicated and further strained over the years. In a collegial way he only collaborated with the professores extraordinarii Friedrich Leo and Ivo Bruns. Among the other professors Foerster was revered. In 1885 he was elected Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy, in 1886 he was elected Rector of the University. In his ceremonial speech he talked about Die klassische Philologie der Gegenwart (\\"Classical Philology in the Present\\"), giving his views of the field and of the ideal scientist. In December 1889, Foerster was offered a chair at his alma mater in Breslau. He accepted with great pleasure and went to Breslau in April 1890. For a few years, he worked alongside his old teachers Hertz and Rossbach. After the latter's death, Foerster was put in charge of the Archaeological Museum and made Professor of Philology and Archaeology. He continued teaching and research until his death in 1922, aged 79.  Works  Richard Foerster's academic career spanned from the 1860s to the Interwar period. Educated a philologist and humanist, Foerster early turned to archaeology and later to art history; but he never quit pursuing his philological tasks which were his life's work.  Physiognomy  Philological and archaeological interests met in Foerster's early enterprise to collate and edit the ancient writings on physiognomy, the art of relating a person's appearance to his character and personality. From Aristotle (Physiognomonics) on, ancient philosophers and sophists had dealt with this matter in different ways. Part of their writing was only extant in Latin or Arabic translation, which Foerster also collated and re-translated. After nearly 25 years, Foerster eventually finished his edition Scriptores physiognomonici Graeci et Latini. It was published in 1893 in two volumes and dedicated to August Rossbach, Foerster's former teacher and (now) colleague in Breslau, at his 75th birthday.  Libanius  During his time in Italy, Foerster was inspired by Rudolf Hercher to collate the manuscripts of the late antique orator and sophist Libanius of Antiochia. This was a task of major importance for several reasons: Libanius' orations, declamations and progymnasmata had an immense impact on the Byzantine writers because of their admired Attic. But the only available edition (by Johann Jacob Reiske and his wife Ernestine Christine Reiske, 1784‚Äì1797) did not meet strict philological standards as it was based only on a selection of manuscripts. Also, the approximately 1500 letters of Libanius (preserved and transmitted after his death) were an important historical source for the 4th century A.D. But the most recent edition (by Johann Christoph Wolf, 1738) was outdated, and the authenticity of a number of letters was uncertain. Foerster made it his life's work to collate every available manuscript of Libanius' writings, present a proper text in an all-new edition, trace Libanius' sources as well as his reception by later authors, put his letters into historical context, and resolve the authenticity issue by analysing the history of transmission and reception. He succeeded in all these tasks, but not in every way definitively. Whilst his historical commentary on the letters and the textual constitution was often criticised by other scholars, Foerster's main achievement remains the most reliable edition of all the works of Libanius. After a lot of preliminary work (which had considerable impact in the classics) Foerster published his edition of Libanii opera omnia from 1903 until his death, in 12 volumes. After his death, his pupil Eberhard Richtsteig completed the final volume (published 1927) and created the index (1923).  Choricius of Gaza  While working on Libanius, Foerster was led to the 5th century orator Choricius of Gaza. In Spain he found several manuscripts containing unedited orations by the Gazaean, which Foerster published subsequently in minor magazines and indices. He also prepared a complete edition of the orations in a major publishing house, but during his lifetime never actually published it. It was Eberhard Richtsteig again who, in 1929, brought the edition to publication.

The sailing boat: a description of English and foreign boats (Longmans, Green & Co., 1870) pp. 113-130. James Beeching (1788 ‚Äì 7 June 1858) was an English boat builder. He invented a \\"self-righting lifeboat\\", and designed a type of fishing boat which became characteristic of the port of Great Yarmouth in the 19th century. He also built ships for the smuggling trade. Life and work Beeching was born at Bexhill in Sussex (now East Sussex), in 1788, to a family who had connections with smuggling, and served an apprenticeship in nearby Hastings as a boat builder. In 1809, he married Martha Thwaites (1789‚Äì1831), daughter of shipowner Thomas Thwaites; they went on to have nine children. Beeching and a partner ran a shipbuilding yard in Hastings for several years, until it failed in 1816 and was purchased by Thomas Thwaites. He then went to Flushing in the Netherlands, and built many craft, including several involved in the English smuggling trade such as the cutter known as \\"Big Jane\\", launched in 1819.The history of the first lifeboats at Hastings (Hastings & St. Leonard's observer, 4 April 2008). On leaving Flushing he settled at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk where he introduced a design of fishing-vessel that for a time was characteristic of the port.Beeching family tree. In the first half of the 19th century, Britain's lifeboats were found by the Admiralty to be unsatisfactory. In 1848, of the 100 boats available, only 55 were in good repair, and many of those were of too heavy a construction; and 21 boats were found to be unfit for use. Lifeboat design was not standardised and the boats available, though an improvement on ordinary vessels, were vulnerable to heavy seas, which could lead to capsizing and loss of life.Gilmore, John. Storm warriors: or, Life-boat work on the Goodwin Sands p. 32 ff. Northumberland Model lifeboat. Final design by James Peake based on submissions by James Beeching and others in 1851. In 1851 attempts were made, under the auspices of Albert the Prince Consort, to revive the activity of the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck. A competition was initiated by the Admiralty for a new, improved lifeboat which would meet criteria: (a) being self-righting; (b) being of lighter construction than before and easier to launch and transport; (c) able to free itself of water faster (i.e. self- draining) and (d) of lower cost.Lewis, Richard. History of the Life-Boat, and Its Work (MacMillan & Co., 1874) pp. 27-38. The Duke of Northumberland, president of the Institution, offered to fund a prize of ¬£100 for the best scale model of a new lifeboat, and another ¬£100 towards the cost of building it. Out of 280 models sent in from all parts of the world (a selection of which were displayed at the famous Crystal Palace exhibition of 1851), Beeching's \\"self-righting\\" designSelf-righting lifeboat, 1861. was awarded the prize. With a few slight modifications made by James Peake, who was a master shipwright at Woolwich Dockyard and one of the competition judges, this design became the standard model for the new fleet of lifeboats acquired by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.A new organisation formed from old \\"National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck\\". It was known as the Beeching-Peake SR (self-righting) lifeboat.Bierens, J. J. L. M. Handbook on drowning: prevention, rescue treatment (Birkh√§user, 2005) pp. 7-8. Beeching had built a boat on the same model before the prize was awarded, and it was purchased by the trustees of Ramsgate Harbour in December 1851. \\"The Northumberland\\",Northumberland model lifeboat (The Mechanics Magazine Museum, volume 55, 6 Sep 1851). as it was called, was 36 feet long and had 12 oars; she became the first self-righting lifeboat and was said to have been \\"one of the most frequently used and useful lifeboats in the United Kingdom\\",The Lifeboat, Journal of the National Life-boat Institution, volume 5 (1865) p. 153. saving the lives of several hundred people on the Goodwin Sands. James Beeching died on 7 June 1858, aged 70.

Centered in the region of Gedo, it pits the Somali government and its allies against the al-Qaeda-aligned militant group Al-Shabaab. Timeline= April 27, 2011  The fighting started after Somali forces ambushed Al- Shabaab fighters in Tulo-Barwaqo, near Garbaharey. The spokesman for the Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a paramilitary claimed they killed around 20 fighters from the opposing side. On the road between Elberde and Luuq a roadside mine killed 15 people. The landmine detonated underneath a minibus, killing nine passengers immediately. Six passengers subsequently died from blood loss. In Tulo- Barwaqo, Ahlu Sunna Waljama‚Äôa fighters clashed with Al-Shabaab militants an Ahlu Sunna spokesman, reported that Ahlu Sunna fighters captured ‚Äúassault rifles, pistols, explosive devices and ‚Ä¶ two military vehicles‚Äù and had killed about twenty Al-Shabaab militants. In Luuq, Al-Shabaab attacked Transitional Federal Government troops using hit-and-run tactics, killing four soldiers. In Elwak, Al-Shabaab ambushed government soldiers, killing ten. One military vehicle belonging to Somali military forces was burnt, and two others were damaged by gunshots in the skirmish.  April 28, 2011  Some 36 Al-Shabaab fighters were killed after fighting with Somali army in the village of Tulo Barwaqo just outside Garbaharey town. Al-Shabaab launched an ambush attack on Somali forces in Gedo region. Al-Shabaab are said to have ambushed government forces flanked by military vehicles at the village of Kured just outside Luuq District. At least 5 persons, all the combatants, were killed and dozens more injured during the confrontation. 27 gunmen from pro-government Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a group were killed in the skirmishes this day and 8 transitional government troops.  April 29, 2011  In Luuq, Al-Shabaab fighters ambushed Somali army forces, killing at least 10 people, mostly from the combatants, and injuring dozens more. A total of 24 Somali forces lost their lives and two military vehicles were destroyed that day.  April 30, 2011  A clash erupted in the village of Burgadud near Garbaharey when Somali forces launched premeditated attacks on Al-Shabaab fighters, at last 6 government soldiers were wounded. Somali troops and ASWJ forces took over the cities of Tulo Barwaqo and Garbaharey when Al-Shabaab fighters reportedly abandoned the towns. At the same time Al-Shabaab claim victory in these fighting. At least 10 Al-Shabaab fighters have been killed during the confrontations and two military vehicles from Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a were reported seized.  May 1, 2011  Heavy fighting was still continuing in Gedo. In Af-barwaqo and Buurgudud villages, at least 10 persons were killed and 14 others wounded. The spokesman of Al-Shabaab, Sheikh Abdiaziz abu Mus‚Äôab, said his fighters seized four pick-up cars from government forces including one battle wagon.  May 2, 2011  Early in the morning, Al- Shabaab forces launched an attack on Garbaharey; they tried to seize the city but failed to. At least 75 Al-Shabaab fighters were killed by Somali troops and ASWJ forces. According to the Somali government, Al-Shabaab high-level commander Fuaad Shongole was killed in these clashes. Only Baardheere and Buur Dhuubo are still in Al-Shabaab's hands.  May 3, 2011  Somali troops ambushed Al-Shabaab militias and pushed the insurgents out of a village named Meykaareeb 19 kilometers west from Garbaharey. Government troops killed 15 Al- Shabaab insurgents during these operations and seized two pick-up cars from Al-Shabaab forces. On afternoon Al-Shabaab launched an ambush attack against Somali military killing 8 ASWJ soldiers and at least 10 Al-Shabaab fighters were also killed. In Garbaharey, three persons from one family were killed after a mortar shelling destroyed their home.  May 4, 2011  In Garbaharey, at least 70 people, mainly the combatants, were killed in heavy fighting between Al-Shabaab forces and Somali soldiers.  May 5, 2011  Sheikh Abdi-aziz Abu Mus‚Äôab, the spokesman of Al Ahabaab, claimed that the chairman on ASWJ in Gedo, Sheikh Hassan Sheikh Ahmed (Qoryoley), died from his wounds sustained from an ambush attack in Garbaharey. Sheikh Isaq Hussein, an Ahlu Sunna officer, confirmed the death.  May 6, 2011  Nine people (six children and three adults) were killed by a landmine explosion in the Gedo region in an unspecified city.  May 7, 2011  Somali forces left the Gusar village following a problem on the payment of their salaries. Al-Shabaab forces took over the village after that.  May 10, 2011  Witnesses in Beled Haawo, Garbaharey, Ceelwaaq and Luuq saw Somali troops accompanied by ASWJ forces leaving in the early morning and heading to Al-Shabaab strongholds. Later that day Somali forces seized four villages close to Baardheere, Al-Shabaab's biggest and last stronghold in Gedo. Al-Shabaab did not put up a fight and withdrew once they saw that they were outnumbered by Somali Armed Forces.  May 13, 2011  Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a forces ambushed Al-Shabaab militias in a village near Garbaharey named Kalabeyr, Al-Shabaab fled the village after ASWJ forces killed 3 Al-Shabaab soldiers and seized some weapons from Al-Shabaab. Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a Maxamed Xuseen Al-Qaaddi told radio Shabelle that ASWJ forces are controlling Kalabeyr after Al-Shabaab lost the battle.  May 14, 2011  In the village of Banmudalo near Luuq clashed beginning between Somali interim government troops and Al-Shabaab fighters. At least two people have been killed.  May 15, 2011  Al- Shabaab forces has pounded volleys of mortars to the town of Garbaharey, No deaths or injuries were reported. Some residents started to flee from their home against of back of new more fighting could again renew from the area.  June 13, 2011  Almost 1000 Somali troops finished training in Doolow, these troops will be deployed in Gedo resuming the offensive. October 11, 2012 Columns of armoured vehicles and military pick-up trucks carrying fresh Ethiopian troops have reportedly reached Somalia‚Äôs border town of Luq located in Gedo province. Somali National Army (SNA) commanders in the area say the Ethiopian troops set up military bases on the suburbs of the town, where they are planning major offensive against the remaining towns and locations controlled by al Qaeda-linked militants of Al-Shabaab.  October 15, 2012  Al-Shabaab fighters have been reported to making their last preparation to defend Bardera district of Gedo region in southern Somalia from the allied forces led by the Somali Military.  October 29, 2012  The government has declared Luq town, Gedo region, and its environ safe and secure and urged aid agencies to open their offices in the area. Area district commissioner Abdullahi Kuredow said security in the district has been bolstered and now reliable. He said Somali forces backed by Ethiopian troops and their allied Ahlu Sunna militias are now in full control of the entire district.  November 10, 2012  At least two people have been killed in a fierce battle between Somali National Army (SNA) and Al-Shabaab militants in Gedo province, the latest in surge of attacks in the southwestern region. The violence reportedly erupted after heavily armed Al-Shabaab fighters launched a surprise assault on Somali forces at a checkpoint located on the outskirts of Garbaharey, a town largely controlled by Somali government. Aftermath= January 2, 2013  Reports from Bardhere town of Gedo region indicate the withdrawal of Al-Shabaab leadership from the town Local residents told Bar- kulan that the town is in a state of panic as the Al-Shabaab fighters prepare for an assault from government and allied forces. Among the fleeing leaders are foreigners, the residents told Bar-kulan. Bardhere is remaining stronghold of Al-Shabaab militants. The town is approached by government troops and Kenya Defence Forces.

It is developed by Golaem, a France-based software company (created in Rennes in 2009). It is a tool to generate characters in reachable areas of the scene (e.g. to place an army in a field avoiding trees and rocks) While animators can use Maya tools to make the crowd characters (represented as particle) move in the scene, the plugin provides navigation behaviors to make them go from A to B autonomously. It allows for automatic navigation mesh computation, Roadmap-based path planning and configurable steering behaviors (including reactive collision avoidance). The included animation engine enables to replay previously created motion, even on characters of different morphologies. Golaem Crowd can adapt motions to the ground and automatically compute transitions between motions, for two-legged or four-legged motion. It provides: Automatic and editable skeleton mapping, biped & quadruped dedicated animation engine, automatic motion retargeting, blending & ground adaptation. Animations can be triggered and blended by defining associated behaviors with start/stop trigger conditions. The user interface is based on Maya workaday objects (particles, fields‚Ä¶). Golaem Crowd is based on the standard animation workflow in CGI, and allows users to incrementally build a scene. Steps are validated one by one: assets, flows, population; behaviors; animation.

The major histocompatibility complex in sexual selection concerns how major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules allow for immune system surveillance of the population of protein molecules in a host's cells. In 1976, Yamazaki et al. demonstrated a sexual selection mate choice by male mice for females of a different MHC. Major histocompatibility complex genes, which control the immune response and effective resistance against pathogens, have been able to maintain an extremely high level of allelic diversity throughout time and throughout different populations. Studies suggest that the MHC is involved in mate choice for many vertebrates through olfactory cues. There are several proposed hypotheses that address how MHC-associated mating preferences could be adaptive and how the MHC has maintained its enormous allelic diversity. The vast source of genetic variation affecting an organism's fitness stems from the co-evolutionary arms race between hosts and parasites. There are two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for explaining this. One is that there is selection for the maintenance of a highly diverse set of MHC genes if MHC heterozygotes are more resistant to parasites than homozygotes‚Äîthis is called heterozygote advantage. The second is that there is selection that undergoes a frequency-dependent cycle‚Äîand is called the Red Queen hypothesis. Hypotheses In the first hypothesis, if individuals heterozygous at the MHC are more resistant to parasites than those that are homozygous, then it is beneficial for females to choose mates with MHC genes different from their own, and would result in MHC-heterozygous offspring‚Äîthis is known as disassortative mating. Individuals with a heterozygous MHC would be capable of recognizing a wider range of pathogens and therefore of inciting a specific immune response against a greater number of pathogens‚Äîthus having an immunity advantage. Unfortunately, the MHC-heterozygote advantage hypothesis has not been adequately tested. The second hypothesis for the maintenance of MHC diversity by parasites is the Red Queen hypothesis. If individuals' MHC alleles render different resistances to a particular parasite, then the allele with the highest resistance is favored, selected for, and consequently spread throughout the population. Recombination and mutation cause generation of new variants among offspring, which may facilitate a quick response to rapidly evolving parasites or pathogens with much shorter generation times. However, if this particular allele becomes common, selection pressure on parasites to avoid recognition by this common allele increases. An advantageous characteristic that allows a parasite to escape recognition spreads, and causes selection against what was formerly a resistant allele. This enables the parasite to escape this cycle of frequency- dependent selection, and such a cycle eventually leads to a co-evolutionary arms race that may support the maintenance of MHC diversity. Parasites are in a constant arms race with their host: harvestman suffering from mite pest The inbreeding avoidance hypothesis has less to do with host-parasite relationships than does the heterozygote advantage hypothesis or the Red Queen hypothesis. The extreme diversity in the MHC would cause individuals sharing MHC alleles to be more likely to be related. As a result, one function of MHC- disassortative mating would be to avoid mating with family members and any harmful genetic consequences that could occur as a result. Mating with relatives, or inbreeding, increases the amount of overall homozygosity‚Äînot just locally in the MHC. An increase in genetic homozygosity may be accompanied not only by the expression of recessive diseases and mutations, but by the loss of any potential heterozygote advantage as well. In the course of searching for potential mates, it would benefit females to be able to discriminate against \\"bad\\" genes in order to increase the health and viability of their offspring. If female mate choice occurs for \\"good\\" genes, then it is implied that genetic variation exists among males. Furthermore, one would presume that said difference in genes would impart a difference in fitness as well, which could potentially be chosen or selected for. Generally, the extreme polymorphism of MHC genes is selected for by host-parasite arms races (the Red Queen hypothesis); however, disassortative mate choice may maintain genetic diversity in some species. Depending on how parasites alter selection on MHC alleles, MHC-dependent mate-choice may increase the fitness of the offspring by enhancing its immunity, as mentioned earlier. If this is the case, either through the heterozygote advantage hypothesis or the Red Queen hypothesis, then selection also favors mating practices that are MHC- dependent. The exaggerated, elongated upper tail coverts make up the \\"train\\" of the peacock.Therefore, mate choice‚Äîwith respect to the MHC‚Äîhas probably evolved so that females choose males either based on diverse genes (heterozygote advantage and inbreeding avoidance hypotheses) or \\"good\\" genes. The fact that females choose is naturally selected, as it would be an advantageous trait for females to be able to choose a male that provided either an indirect or direct benefit. As a result of female choice, sexual selection is imposed on males. This is evidenced by genetic \\"advertisement\\"‚Äîan example of this would be the existence of exaggerated traits, such as the elaborate tail-feathers of male peacocks. However, in humans, both sexes exert mate choice.  The relationship between olfaction and MHC  MHC-based sexual selection is known to involve olfactory mechanisms in such vertebrate taxa as fish, mice, humans, primates, birds, and reptiles. At its simplest level, humans have long been acquainted with the sense of olfaction for its use in determining the pleasantness or the unpleasantness of one's resources, food, etc. At a deeper level, it has been predicted that olfaction serves to personally identify individuals based upon the genes of the MHC. Human olfactory system. 1: Olfactory bulb 2: Mitral cells 3: Bone 4: Nasal epithelium 5: Glomerulus (olfaction) 6: Olfactory receptor cells Chemosensation, which is one of the most primitive senses, has evolved into a specialized sensory system. Humans can not only detect, but also assess, and respond to environmental (chemical) olfactory cues‚Äîespecially those used to evoke behavioral and sexual responses from other individuals, also known as pheromones. Pheromones function to communicate one's species, sex, and perhaps most importantly one's genetic identity. The genes of the MHC provide the basis from which a set of unique olfactory coding develops. Although it is not known exactly how MHC-specific odors are recognized, it is currently believed that proteins bound to the peptide-binding groove of the MHC may produce the odorant. Each MHC protein binds to a specific peptide sequence, yielding a set of uniquely bound peptide-MHC complexes for each individual. During cellular turnover, the MHC-peptide complex is shed from the cell surface and the fragments are dispensed in bodily fluids such as blood serum, saliva, and urine. Scientists believe that commensal microflora, microorganisms that line epithelial surfaces open to the external environment such as the gastrointestinal tract and vagina, further degrade these fragments, which are made volatile by this process. Recently, it has been shown that receptors in the vomeronasal organ of mice are activated by peptides having similar characteristics to MHC proteins; further studies may hopefully soon clarify the exact transformation between MHC genotype and an olfactory mechanism.  Empirical evidence = In humans  MHC similarity in humans has been studied in three broad ways: odor, facial attractiveness, and actual mate choice. Studies of odor find MHC-dissimilarity preferences but vary in details, while facial attractiveness favors MHC-similarity and actual mating studies are varied. = Specific studies = Several studies suggest that MHC-related odor preferences and mate choice are demonstrated by humans. However, the role of MHC in human mate choice has been relatively controversial. One study conducted by Ober et al. examined HLA types from 400 couples in the Hutterite community and found dramatically fewer HLA matches between husbands and wives than expected when considering the social structure of their community. On the other hand, there was no evidence of MHC-based mate choice in the same study of 200 couples from South Amerindian tribes. Other studies have approached mate choice based on odor preference. In one study done by Wedekind et al., women were asked to smell male axillary odors collected on T-shirts worn by different males. Women that were ovulating rated the odors of MHC-dissimilar men as more pleasant than those of the MHC-similar men. Furthermore, odors of MHC-dissimilar men often reminded women of current or former partners, suggesting that odor‚Äîspecifically odor for MHC- dissimilarity‚Äîplays a role in mate choice. In another study done by Wedekind et al., 121 women and men were asked to rank the pleasantness of the odors of sweaty T-shirts. Upon smelling the shirts, it was found that men and women who were reminded of their own mate or ex-mate had dramatically fewer MHC alleles in common with the wearer than would be expected by chance. If the selection for shirts was not random, and actually selected for MHC-dissimilar alleles, this suggests that MHC genetic composition does influence mate choice. Furthermore, when the degree of similarity between the wearer and the smeller was statistically accounted for, there was no longer a significant influence of MHC on odor preference. The results show that MHC similarity or dissimilarity certainly plays a role in mate choice. Specifically, MHC- disassortative mate choice and less similar MHC combinations are selected for. One interesting aspect of the Wedekind's experiment was that in contrast to normally cycling women, women taking oral contraceptives preferred odors of MHC-similar men. This would suggest that the pill may interfere with the adaptive preference for dissimilarity.  In primates  There is evidence of MHC-associated mate choice in other primates. In the grey mouse lemur Microcebus murinus, post-copulatory mate-choice is associated with genetic constitution. Fathers are more MHC-dissimilar from the mother than are randomly tested males. Fathers have more differences in amino acid and microsatellite diversity than did randomly tested males. It is hypothesized that this is caused by female cryptic choice.  In other animals  In mice, both males and females choose MHC-dissimilar partners. Mice develop the ability to identify family members during early growth and are known to avoid inbreeding with kin, which would support the MHC-mediated mate choice hypothesis for inbreeding avoidance. Fish are another group of vertebrates shown to display MHC-associated mate choice. Scientists tested the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, by observing effects of MHC upon natural spawning salmon that resided in the river versus artificial crosses that were carried out in hatcheries. Logically, the artificial crosses would be bereft of the benefits of mate choice that would naturally be available. The results showed that the offspring of the artificially bred salmon were more infected with parasites: almost four times more than the naturally-spawned offspring were. In addition, wild offspring were more MHC-heterozygous than the artificially-bred offspring. These results support the Heterozygous Advantage hypothesis of sexual selection for MHC-dissimilar mate choice. In another fish, the three- spined stickleback, it has been shown that females desire MHC diversity in their offspring, which affects their mate choice. Female Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, chose MHC-dissimilar males to mate with. Females are more likely to engage in extra-pair relationships if paired with MHC- similar mates and more dissimilar mates are available. Similarly, MHC diversity in house sparrows, Passer domesticus, suggests that MHC- disassortative mate choice occurs. MHC-mediated mate choice has been shown to exist in Swedish sand lizards, Lacerta agilis. Females preferred to associate with odor samples obtained from males more distantly related at the MHC I loci. Even though many species are socially monogamous, females can accept or actively seek mating outside of the relationship; extra-pair paternity is a mating pattern known to be affiliated with MHC-associated mate choice. Birds are one of the more commonly studied groups of animals to exhibit this sexual behavior. In the scarlet rosefinch Carpocus erythrinus, females engaged in extra-pair paternity much less frequently when their mates were MHC- heterozygous.Promerov√° Vinkler. Occurrence of extra-pair paternity is connected to social male's MHC-variability in the scarlet rosefinch Carpodacus erythrinus. Journal of Avian Biology 42, 5-10(2011). In the Seychelles warbler Acrocephalus sechellensis, there was no evidence of MHC variation between social mates. However, when females' social mates were MHC-similar, they were more likely to participate in extra-pair paternity; in most cases, the extra- pair male was significantly more MHC-dissimilar than the social mate. MHC- mediated mate choice may occur after copulation, at the gametic level, through sperm competition or female cryptic choice. The Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, is one species in which sperm competition is influenced by the variation in the major histocompatibility complex, specifically that of the Class I alleles. Atlantic salmon males have higher rates of successful fertilization when competing for eggs from females genetically similar at the class I genes of the MHC. Another species that exhibits MHC-associated cryptic choice is the Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus. In this case, however, it seems that sperm selection is more dependent on the ovum. MHC-heterozygous males were found to have significantly more fertilization success than MHC-homozygous males; sperm count, motility, and swimming velocity were not shown to significantly co-vary with similarity or dissimilarity at the MHC. It is proposed that there is a chemo-attraction system responsible for the egg itself being able to discriminate and selectively choose between MHC-heterozygous and MHC- homozygous males. Contrary to the Atlantic salmon and the Arctic char, red junglefowl Gallus gallus males instead of females exert cryptic preference. Male junglefowl showed no preference when simultaneously presented with both an MHC-dissimilar and an MHC-similar female. However, they did show a cryptic preference by allocating more sperm to the more MHC-dissimilar of the two. Male sand lizards Lacerta agilis behave similarly to the male junglefowl. Initial copulation between a male and a female without any rivals was shown to be extended when the male sensed a higher female fecundity. However, second males adjusted the duration of their copulation depending on the relatedness between the female and the first male, believed to be determined by the MHC- odor of the copulatory plug. A closer genetic relatedness between a male and a female sand lizard increased the chances for a successful fertilization and rate of paternity for the second male. Abortional selection may be a form of cryptic female choice. Many studies on humans and rodents have found that females may spontaneously abort pregnancies in which the offspring is too MHC- similar. In addition, in vitro fertilizations are more likely to fail when couples have similar MHC genes.  MHC and sexual conflict  If males attempt to thwart female mate choice by mating with a female against her will, sexual conflict may interfere with the choice for compatibility at the MHC genes. In Chinook salmon Oncorhyncus tshawytscha, females act more aggressively towards MHC-similar males than MHC-dissimilar males, suggesting the presence of female mate choice. Furthermore, males directed aggression at MHC-similar females. This was accompanied by male harassment of unreceptive females; however, there was a positive correlation between male aggression and reproductive success. The ability of the males to over-power the females' original mate choice resulted in the offspring of the targets of male aggression having low genetic diversity. Offspring with high genetic diversity seemed to happen only when the operational sex ratio was female-biased, when females were more likely to be able to exert mate choice, and males were less likely to harass females. These results suggest that sexual conflict may interfere with female mate choice for 'good' MHC genes.

He was diocesan surveyor (architect) for the Anglican Diocese of Norwich from 1871‚Äì84, and a county surveyor in the 1860s, though he was active from the 1850s. He restored a large number of churches in East Anglia in the middle and late 19th century: he was \\"fond of big, unexpected figure and foliage carvings\\".Wilson 446‚Äì47.

Notable projects St Mary-le-Tower is the civic church of Ipswich, and \\"the nearest thing the town will ever have to a cathedral. This is Suffolk's Victorian church par excellence. It is full of the spirit of its age, from the Suffolk flushwork to the international gothic of the spire itself. One could no more imagine Ipswich without 'the Tower' than without the Orwell Bridge,\\" according to Simon Knott. There was a medieval church on the site, which was almost entirely demolished in the 1860s, so that the present exterior is largely Phipson's, although the nave arcades and some monuments and fittings inside remain from the original. Phipson replaced the tower and spire at Woolpit after they were destroyed by lightning in the 1850s. Despite his use of a style typical of Northamptonshire, rather than Suffolk, his spire is largely accepted as a success by most authorities.Not Jenkins, p. 667, but Norwich, 609, and Suffolk churches. unlike his one at Great Finborough, sometimes dubbed \\"Thunderbird One\\" after the Supermarionation space rescue vehicle.biography Suffolk Churches He also oversaw the restoration and alteration of the Moot Hall in Aldeburgh in 1854-1855.

Introduction  Governor Shettima is a Muslim from the Kanuri tribe from Borno State and is generally seen as extremely hospitable to other faith and ethnic groups. In the last seven years as Governor, Shettima has maintained amongst his closest aides, an Ibo Christian from Anambra State in the Southeast, an Urhobo Christian from Delta State in the South-South, a Christian from Edo State in the South-South, a Yoruba Christian from the Southwest, a fulani man from Gombe in the northeast and a Hausa man from Zamfara State in the northwest.Governor Shettima speaks very fluent English and Hausa language. Local and International listeners of his public presentations regularly describe Shettima as being very articulate and intelligent.  Personal life  Kashim Shettima was born in Maiduguri, Borno state, Nigeria to the family of Sir Kashim Ibrahim. He is married to Nana Shettima, and they have three children: two females and a male.  Education  Mr Kashim attended Lamisula Primary School in Maiduguri from 1972 to 1978; Government Community Secondary School, Biu in southern part of Borno State from 1978 to 1980; transferred to Government Science Secondary School, Potiskum (now in neighbouring Yobe State) where he completed his secondary education in 1983. He studied at the University of Maiduguri and earned a Degree (BSc) in Agricultural Economics in 1989. He had his one-year compulsory membership of the National Youths Service Corps, NYSC, at the defunct Nigerian Agricultural Cooperative Bank, Calabar, capital of Cross River State in South- South, Nigeria, from 1989 to 1990. He obtained a master's degree (MSc) in Agricultural Economics in 1991 at the University of Ibadan in Southwest, Nigeria. Shettima joined the University of Maiduguri as a Lecturer with the Department of Agricultural Economics and was in the academia from 1991 to 1993. Early career In 1993, he moved into the banking sector and was employed by (now defunct) Commercial Bank of Africa Limited as head of accounts unit at the bank's office in Ikeja, Lagos State, Southwest, Nigeria. Shettima was there from 1993 to 1997. In 1997 he crossed over to the African International Bank Limited as a Deputy Manager and rose to become a Manager in 2001. In 2001, he moved to the Zenith Bank as head of its main branch in Maiduguri. At the Zenith Bank he rose to Senior Manager/Branch Head; Assistant General Manager (AGM)/Zonal Head (North-East), Deputy General Manager/Zonal Head (North-East) before he stepped out of the Zenith Bank as a General Manager in 2007 following his appointment as Commissioner for Finance in Borno State. Shettima worked with the Commercial Bank of Africa as an Agricultural Economist at its Ikeja Office, Lagos State (1993-1997). He then became a deputy manager, later manager, at the African International Bank Limited, Kaduna Branch (1997‚Äì2001), and was appointed Deputy Manager/Branch Head of the Zenith Bank's Maiduguri Office in 2001, becoming General Manager five years later. In mid-2007, Shettima was appointed Commissioner of the Borno State Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. Later he became Commissioner in the Ministries of Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs, Education, Agriculture and later Health under his predecessor as Borno Governor Ali Modu Sheriff.  Political career  From 2007 to 2011, he served as Commissioner in 5 Ministries. In the January 2011 ANPP primaries, Engineer Modu Fannami Gubio was selected as candidate for the governorship. However, Gubio was later shot dead by gunmen, and Shettima was selected in a second primary in February 2011. In the 26 April 2011 elections, Shettima won with 531,147 votes while the People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Muhammed Goni, gained 450,140 votes. He was Commissioner of Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs (2008), Education (2009), Agriculture and Natural Resources and finally to the Ministry of Health from where he contested the Governorship in 2011 which he won under the platform of the now defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party, ANPP and was inaugurated on May 29, 2011. He won reelection in 2015 under the All Progressives Congress, APC and was unambiguously chosen as Chairman of the Northern States Governors' Forum, an umbrella body of Governors in the 19 States located in northern Nigeria. He has so far been driving key changes in the affairs of the forum with focus on promoting northern unity and reviving ailing industries belonging to northern States. As Governor of Borno State, he has efficiently managed challenges arising from the Boko Haram insurgency which he inherited in 2011. With the approval of the National Security Adviser and the Nigerian Army in 2013, his government formalized establishment of youth volunteers called the Civilian JTF. The volunteers have played very significant role in supporting the military in ongoing fight against Boko Haram insurgents. He approves salaries, kits and patrol vehicles for the civilian JTF while at the same time giving so much support to the Nigerian Armed Forces. He leads in mobilization of community based intelligence gathering and the provision of hundreds of patrol vehicles and material logistics to the military in particular and to all other security agencies. In September, 2014, Maiduguri, the seat of Government became very vulnerable to being occupied by insurgents. The fear was so intense that notable residents relocated their families to Abuja. However, amidst such fright, Governor Kashim Shettima who was out of the country for an official assignment, returned to Maiduguri in a show of courage and patriotism. On his return, the Governor mobilized residents towards rising up in defense of their ancestry. Although Maiduguri didn't fall, the insurgents succeeded in occupying 20 out of the 27 local government areas of the State before the Nigerian Armed Forces liberated them between 2015 and 2016. The Governor has been coordinating and leading the temporary accommodation, rehabilitation and resettlement of victims of the Boko Haram insurgents. With peace building, Governor Kashim Shettima has been championing Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Resettlement of victims. He has focused so much attention on expansion and remodeling of existing schools and the building news boarding primary and junior secondary schools to cater for over 50, 000 unaccompanied orphans whose parents were killed by insurgents across the 27 local government areas of the State. Governor Kashim Shettima's leadership credentials have attracted positive recognition within and outside Nigeria. Governor Shettima emerged the 2014 Governor of the Year (Leadership Newspapers), Governor of the Year, 2015, (Nigeria Union of Journalists, national body); Governor of the Year, 2015 (NewsWatchTimes Newspapers); Governor of the Year, 2015 (Vanguard Newspapers); Governor of the Year, 2016 (Tell Magazine); 2017 Zik Prize for Leadership; Kaduna NUJ Award for courage and exceptional leadership (2017), FCT NUJ Merit Award for exceptional Leadership, 2017.

The vedi (plural) were described as male human-like creatures as high as a peasant house, completely covered with hair. They were very strong, able to uproot trees and carry heavy loads, while their chest was so large that they could make storms by blowing. When they spoke or sang, it was heard far away. They lived deep in the forests of Bilogora, where they built their towns, and were divided into tribes.Zvonko Lovrenƒçeviƒá (1970). \\"Mitolo≈°ke predaje Bilo- gore\\". Narodna umjetnost (Zagreb: Institute of Ethonology and Folklore Research) 7 (1). . pp.72‚Äì4. There were good and bad vedi. The latter did not associate with people and stayed in their forests, because of which they were also called the forest vedi. They normally did no harm to people, but if a bad ved encountered a young man in a forest, he would take him to his town and keep him as a slave for some time. The man would be often maltreated by his master, and eventually set free emaciated. The good vedi visited people and helped them in their every-day work or troubles. Each household had its own ved who was very devoted to it, often to the extent that he did harm to other households and their vedi. If people expected a flood, storm, or other calamity, they would pray, \\"Grant, Oh God, that our vedi help us!\\" or \\"Dear God, grant that our vedi help us, and that their vedi do no harm to us!\\" Stories have it that after such prayers the vedi would quickly come to rescue. Last accounts of vedi visiting people date from the mid 19th century. In the end only certain individuals were allegedly able to see them.

Worried about losing control of the engine, Claude traveled first to Paris and then to England in an attempt to further the project.

It is located in the central Charlottenburg district at Bismarckstra√üe No. 110 near Ernst-Reuter-Platz. Opened in 1907, the building served as second venue of the Prussian State Theatre company in the 1920s and 1930s. After post-war rebuilding, it was the main stage of the Berlin State Theatres from 1951 until in 1993 the City Senate decided to close it for financial reasons. Since then, it is rented out for theatre performances and other events, and was used by the Berlin State Opera as an interim venue during extensive renovation work from 2010-2017. History The Schiller Theater was built from 1905 to 1906 according to plans by the Munich architect Max Littmann on behalf of Schiller-Theater company and the then independent city of Charlottenburg. Littmann, founder of the Heilmann & Littmann contracting business, had considerable experience in theatre architecture, having designed and built the Munich Prinzregententheater and Kammerspiele in 1900‚Äì1901. The building complex comprised a theatre hall, a multipurpose room, as well as a restaurant. The sculptural decoration was designed by the sculptors D√ºll and Petzold, the decoration of the auditorium and the painted curtain is from Julius M√∂ssel. Schiller Theater, about 1919 The 1,194-seat theatre was opened on 1 January 1907 with Die R√§uber by Friedrich Schiller, and continued to be run by the Schiller-Theater-Gesellschaft with their own theatre company. Established as part of the \\"People's Theatre\\" (Volksb√ºhne) movement, the slavicist and intellectual Raphael L√∂wenfeld, founding member of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith, was the initiator and manager of the original ensemble. He had already inaugurated a Schiller Theater Ost in Berlin's K√∂nigstadt quarter in 1894 and a Schiller Theater Nord in the Oranienburger Vorstadt in 1896. Likewise, the Charlottenburg venue was meant to provide socially marginalised groups with access to stage plays by Henrik Ibsen, Gerhart Hauptmann, and particularly Leo Tolstoi, whose works L√∂wenfeld himself had translated into German. After World War I, from June 1921, the building was the second venue of the Prussian State Theatre (Preu√üisches Staatstheater Berlin), whose main venue was the present-day Konzerthaus Berlin at Gendarmenmarkt in the Mitte district. After the Nazi seizure of power, the Prussian prime minister Hermann G√∂ring had the Schiller Theater transferred into possession of the City of Berlin in December 1933. From 1937 to 1938, the theatre was extensively rebuilt according to plans designed by Paul Baumgarten. Baumgarten simplified the facade and the auditorium considerably, changing the appearance of the theatre with respect to the New Objectivity of the 1920s, but also in line with the prevailing monumental Nazi architecture trend. A special state box (F√ºhrerloge) was installed in the auditorium. The sculptors Paul Scheurich and Karl Nocke and the painter Albert Birkle were involved in the conversion. From the re-opening with Schiller's Kabale und Liebe in the presence of Adolf Hitler on 15 November 1938, the theatre was run as Schiller-Theater der Reichshauptstadt Berlin. The famous actor Heinrich George was employed as general director, acting under the pseudonym of Heinrich Schmitz. During the bombing of Berlin in World War II, the auditorium was destroyed in a RAF air strike in the night of 22/23 November 1943. Performances continued on a provisional stage until the theatre finally closed in September 1944. Schiller Theater, 1953 After the war, the Schiller Theater was rebuilt from 1950 on behalf of the city of West Berlin, according to plans by the architects Heinz V√∂lker and Rolf Grosse. Some parts of the ruins of the old theatre were re-used for the new construction. The main foyer received a large glass wall and the hallway was adorned with sculptures created by Bernhard Heiliger. The re-opening was solemnly celebrated by a concert of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra under Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler on 5 September 1951, followed by a performance of Schiller's Wilhelm Tell the next evening. The new theatre had 1,067 seats, and served as the Gro√ües Haus, the main venue, for the Berlin State Theatres (Staatlichen Schauspielb√ºhnen Berlin), beside the Schlosspark Theater in the Steglitz district as Kleines Haus, the second venue. The State Theatres also used the Schiller-Theater Werkstatt in the building of the Schiller Theater (now a second venue of the Grips-Theater company), and the Ballhaus Rixdorf in Berlin-Neuk√∂lln as further stages. Under the management of Boleslaw Barlog the Schiller Theater became the leading West Berlin stage, only rivalled by the Schaub√ºhne ensemble around Peter Stein from the 1970s onwards. Among the famous managers of the Berlin State Theatres were Hans Lietzau, Boy Gobert and Heribert Sasse.(‚Ä¶) Gobert-Nachfolger als Schauspielb√ºhnen-Leiter.

George Tabori, Hans Neuenfels, Hans Hollmann and Peter Zadek. After lengthy discussions, the Schiller Theater was closed on 3 October 1993, three years after German reunification, on a decision of the Berlin Senate due to the increasing indebtedness of the city. The last performance of the state theatre there was the premiere of the play Wei√üalles und Dickedumm (Quisaitout et Grob√™ta) by Coline Serreau starring Katharina Thalbach. All permanently employed staff and artists, including Bernhard Minetti, Erich Schellow and Sabine Sinjen, were dismissed. The closure of the largest German-speaking stage sparked protest and resentment, and the Senator for Culture at that time, Ulrich Roloff-Momin, was given the name \\"Schiller-Killer\\". It was then used as a venue for musicals and guest theatre performances. From January to October 2000, the Maxim-Gorki-Theater used the stage of the Schiller Theater.  Replacement venue for the Staatsoper  State Opera in the Schiller Theater, 2012 When the Staatsoper Unter den Linden had to close on 31 May 2010 for renovation, the company and the Staatskapelle Berlin were accommodated in the Schiller Theater. The reconstruction work began in June 2010 and is expected to cost 239 million euros. The Staatsoper was expected to stay at the Schiller Theater for three years, but eventually stayed for seven.

A species of catfish from the genus Parauchenoglanis has been introduced to the lake, and this probably presents a serious threat to the endemic cichlids. The Ejagham cichlids are commonly considered a prime example of sympatric speciation within its two genera. Studies indicate a level of secondary gene flow between the lake's species and relatives from nearby regions, and this likely facilitated the speciation (i.e., the Ejagham species not strictly the result of sympatric speciation).Martin; Cutler; Friel; Touokong; Coop; and Wainwright (2015).

His younger brother was Sir Thomas Haycraft, a judge in the British Colonial Service. He received his medical education at the University of Edinburgh, where he gained an MD on the history, development, and function of the carapace of the chelonia and also a DSc in public health in 1888. He worked for a time in Ludwig's laboratory in Leipzig. In 1880, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Peter Guthrie Tait, William Rutherford, Sir William Turner, and Sir Thomas Richard Fraser. In 1881, he was appointed chair of physiology at Mason College (which later became the University of Birmingham). He taught in Birmingham and attracted many students to the city. During his years in Birmingham and Edinburgh, Haycraft had been actively engaged in research and published papers on the coagulation of blood and in 1884, he discovered that the leech secreted a powerful anticoagulant, which he named hirudin, although it was not isolated until the 1950s, nor its structure fully determined until 1976.

HAMLET is a possible chemotherapeutic agent with the ability to kill cancer cells. Alpha-lactalbumin is the primary protein component of human milk. In a 1995 study, it was discovered by Swedish scientist Anders H√•kansson (Anders Hakansson) that multimeric alpha-lactalbumin (MAL), a compound isolated from a fraction of human milk called casein, induced what appeared to be apoptosis in human lung carcinoma cells, pneumococcus bacteria, and other pathogens, while leaving healthy, differentiated cells unaffected. It has been the perfect cure in this case. The active component responsible for the tumoricidal activity was found in 2000 and found to be a complex of alpha- lactalbumin and oleic acid. Endogenous human alpha-lactalbumin is complexed with a calcium ion and serves as a cofactor in lactose synthesis, but has no tumoricidal properties. The alpha-lactalbumin must be partially unfolded to allow for release of the calcium ion and replacement with an oleic acid molecule. The partially folded conformation is essential to the cytotoxicity of HAMLET, as mutagenesis studies have shown that completely unfolded alpha- lacalbumin does not retain the functional properties of HAMLET. The oleic acid is necessary for stabilizing this molecule in this partially unfolded state. Over the past several years, additional work has further characterized the structure and function of HAMLET and its clinical applications are currently under investigation. However, in order to develop effective therapies, more must be known about the mechanism of action of HAMLET. Mechanism of action HAMLET carries out independent attacks on many distinct cell organelles, including mitochondria, proteasomes, and histones, and interferes with cell processes such as macroautophagy. It has been shown that HAMLET binds to the cell surface and rapidly invades cells, with tumor cells taking up far more protein than healthy, differentiated cells. The mechanism of its entry is poorly understood, but recent studies indicate that the oleic acid in the HAMLET complex interacts with phosphatidylserine and o-glycosylated mucin on the plasma membrane, both of which are expressed in greater amounts on the plasma membrane of tumor cells, possibly providing for HAMLET‚Äôs specificity. One of the most prominent targets of HAMLET once inside the cell is the mitochondrion. Electron microscopy has revealed physical damage to the mitochondrial membranes and assays have found cytochrome c release and activation of the caspase cascade, the most notable ones being caspases 2, 3, and 9. Cell death is not prevented by caspase inhibitors, or by BCL-2 or p53 mutagenesis, indicating that the traditional apoptotic caspase cascade is not the ultimate cause of cell death. Another target of HAMLET is the proteasome. 26S proteasomes are activated in response to large quantities of unfolded HAMLET protein in the cytoplasm, but degradation of HAMLET by the proteasome is unusually slow. Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that HAMLET is capable of binding the catalytic 20S subunit of the proteasome and disabling its enzymatic activity, an effect that has never before been demonstrated for any protein. However, proteasome inhibition alone does not seem to be responsible for HAMLET-induced cell death, as proteasome inhibitors have been shown to reduce the cytotoxicity of HAMLET. HAMLET also targets the nucleus, where it interacts with histones to interfere with transcriptional processes. Studies have shown that HAMLET is mostly localized to the nucleus within one hour of invading a tumor cell. Hamlet has been shown to bind with high affinity to individual histone proteins, to be specific H2a, H2b, H3, and H4, as well as entire nucleosomal units. This interaction irreversibly blocks transcription and leads to activation of p53. This process has been demonstrated to be similar to histone hyperacetylation and it was found that histone de-acetylase inhibitors potentiated the effects of HAMLET. HAMLET cells showed the physiological characteristics of macroautophagy, a process in which cellular components are sequestered in double membrane-bound vesicles that fuse with lysosomes for degradation. Cells also showed decreased levels of mTOR, a known inhibitor of macroautophagy. HAMLET cells and cells under conditions of amino acid starvation (a known initiator of macroautophagy) showed similar expression patterns of autophagocytotic proteins and responded equally well to addition of macroautophagy inhibitors. Research=Antibiotic adjuvant While HAMLET on its own is not active against most bacteria, when present together with antibiotics, HAMLET may help. Specifically, HAMLET can make MRSA bacteria sensitive against methicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin and erythromycin Tumors Research is being conducted to determine if this could be a possible treatment for cancer. Animal models of glioblastoma have been studied with tentative success. The first human trial of the therapy was on benign skin growths known as warts and showed positive outcomes without any side effects. It is being studied in carcinomas of the lung, throat, kidney, colon, bladder, prostate, and ovaries, as well as melanomas, glioblastomas, and leukemias. A study of bladder cancer in a mouse found it caused shedding of TUNEL-positive cancer cells into the urine, with no adverse side-effects on healthy cells.

Versification The poem is written in a series of octaves (huitains in the French) each line of which contains eight syllables (octosyllabes), which is also the style of the poet Fran√ßois Villon in the \\"Ballade des dames du temps jadis\\" written later in the 15th century. In the debate between the Lover and the Lady, the alternating octaves delineate their arguments. The rhyme scheme is ABABBCBC of crossed rhymes (rimes crois√©es). Structure The body of La Belle Dame sans Mercy is composed of 100 stanzas of alternating dialogue between a male lover and the lady he loves (referred to in the French as l'Amant et la Dame). Their dialogue is framed by the observations of the narrator-poet who is mourning the recent death of his lady. The first 24 stanzas describe the mourning poet, the self-described most unhappy lover (\\"le plus dolent des amoureux\\"), as he embarks alone on horseback, driven to wander by Sadness (Tristesse) and divested of his capacity to feel by Death (Mort). After wandering for a time, the narrator- poet finds himself obliged to attend a party with two of his friends. It is at this party that the poet observes the unhappy lover, with whom he can empathize, and his lady. At the end of the twenty-fourth stanza, the narrator- poet takes on the role of silent observer, hiding himself behind a trellis. He listens to and then claims to transcribe the conversation between the melancholy lover and the lady. The lover, in traditional love language, offers multiple reasons for the lady to accept him as her lover; the lady refuses to acquiesce in witty and reasoned ripostes. In the last four stanzas the poet- narrator takes over the narrative to give the moral of the poem.

History = Development and construction  The development of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers began in the mid-1980s when the Finnish National Board of Navigation launched a project to find secondary uses for the new vessels it was planning to build as a replacement for some of the oldest icebreakers. Until then the Finnish icebreakers had been designed solely for escort operations in ice-infested waters and their specialized hull form was not suitable for open water. As a result, the existing icebreakers had an effective operational time of only three to five months per year and spent the summer season moored at Katajanokka in Helsinki. A multipurpose application of the new icebreakers would thus result in a better utilization of the vessels and, assuming they were chartered by a commercial third party during the summer, improve the economics of the state-owned fleet.Tellefsen, T.P.

However, the concept did not become reality until the early 1990s, when the Norwegian company Ugland Offshore AS (later DSND Offshore AS) became involved in the project to develop and construct multipurpose icebreakers that could be used for offshore operations in the oil fields during the summer months. The concept was developed by the Board of Navigation together with a Finnish consulting engineering company ILS and the contract for the construction of the first vessel with an option for a sister ship was signed with Finnyards in October 1991. The second vessel was ordered in June 1992.Sj√∂str√∂m, P-E. From the North Sea to the Arctic: Finstaship combines icebreaking and offshore . Scandinavian Shipping Gazette, 18 October 2006. Retrieved 11 October 2011 The ships had large open aft decks similar to platform supply vessels and their two 7,500 kW diesel-electric Aquamaster Z-drive azimuth thrusters provided dynamic positioning capability. The first Finnish multipurpose icebreaker, Fennica, was delivered in 1993 and her sister ship, Nordica, in the following year. The third multipurpose icebreaker Botnica was designed mainly for Gulf of Finland escort icebreaking. Its summer tasks were planned in cooperation with DSND Offshore AS, and the discussion led to the conclusion that this type of vessel could be used as a cost-effective alternative to semi-submersible platforms for North Sea operators. The new light well intervention and slim hole drilling tasks brought in extra safety requirements, including explosion proof main deck arrangement and A-class bulkhead against deckhouse and lifesaving equipment because of a blow out risk. The vessel was designed into highest redundant DP class, with also machinery, thruster and DP control rooms divided into two independent spaces. A moon pool was designed in the vessel already in an earlier stage of the design, and among needed special equipment was e.g. a removable derrick. Other summer period offshore tasks included e.g. ROV support, hoisting of umbilicals, and offshore construction tasks. Harjula, A., Siiril√§, T.K., Eronen, H., Lohi, P. (1999).

In February 1997 the Finnish National Board of Navigation signed a contract worth FIM 303 million with Finnyards for the construction of a new multipurpose icebreaker. While initially only FIM 280 million was reserved for the new icebreaker, this was later increased by FIM 23 million as the planned vessel proved to be more expensive than expected. While an open call for bids was arranged by the Board of Navigation as dictated by the European Union rules, only Finnyards and Kv√¶rner Masa-Yards, another Finnish shipyard, sent in their tenders, and Finnyards won the contract because of shorter delivery time.

Career  Like the older Finnish multipurpose icebreakers, Botnica was chartered to DSND Offshore AS for 180 days per year, while in the winter months she was employed as a traditional escort icebreaker in the Baltic Sea. Once icebreaker assistance was no longer needed, the offshore construction equipment was re-installed and the vessel left the Baltic Sea for the summer season.

Controversies  In the early 2000s the managing director Ky√∂sti Vesterinen and several other high-ranking members of the Finnish Maritime Administration were caught in a bribery scandal when it was found out that DSND Offshore, the charterer of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers, had offered them several private trips around the world. At the same time the offshore company, which had failed to make payments for the charters in time, was forgiven 153,000 euros of penalty interests. As a result, Vesterinen and two other officials were found guilty for corruption and as a result lost their positions, were given suspended sentences of four to ten months and had to pay back the unlawfully obtained benefits.Merenkulkulaitoksen lahjussyytteet julki.

Retrieved 21 October 2011 The incident ended the co-operation between DSND and the Finnish Maritime Administration and left many people suspicious about the profitability of the multipurpose icebreakers. In December 2003 the Finnish-Swedish ice class of Botnica was unexpectedly downgraded from 1A Super to III, the lowest possible ice class which is mainly used for barges and other vessels unsuitable for navigation in ice. Since the icebreaker is built to DNV's ICE-10 ice class which far exceeds the requirements for the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, this was not due to any technical or structural issue, but a problem with the ship's paperwork. Botnica operates at different draughts depending on her mission, and when returning to Finland from abroad her true main dimensions were found out to be different from those stated in the ship's documentation. As a result, the maritime inspector of the Finnish Maritime Administration had no other choice but to downgrade the ship's ice classification to the lowest possible ice class. The missing documents were delivered and the correct ice class was restored shortly afterwards.Icebreaker Botnica unexpectedly classified among ships unfit for service in ice conditions .

Criticism  The state-owned shipping company Arctia Shipping Oy and its predecessors have been heavily criticized over the years for the financial losses from the offshore business. Due to conflicting design requirements of icebreaking and offshore work, the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers were not competitive against purpose-built offshore vessels. As a result, the ships have been left without contracts and have spent long periods of time in foreign ports even during the Finnish winter navigation season, forcing the Finnish Government to hire icebreakers from the commercial market to keep the ports open.Berglund, M.

However, according to an internal memorandum of the Finnish Maritime Administration, the offshore business, while not profitable, has covered at least some of the expenses from icebreaking during the winter seasons in the late 1990s, resulting in lower overall operating costs for the multipurpose icebreakers than for traditional icebreakers.Muistio: Monitoimimurtajien kannattavuus heikko . Helsingin Sanomat, 23 August 2000. Retrieved 21 October 2011 The Finnish multipurpose icebreakers have also been criticized for their (alleged) lower icebreaking capability when compared to traditional, purpose- built icebreakers such as those built in the 1970s and 1980s particularly in the Bothnian Bay ice conditions. Designed primarily for icebreaking operations in the Gulf of Finland, Botnica is as wide as the older icebreakers but has only two thirds of the propulsion power. As a result, she has been described as \\"underpowered\\" by her crew. In addition there have been problems such as oil leaks with the early Azipod units and the twelve high-speed engines with 144 cylinders have been described as \\"an engineer's nightmare\\". Botnica and the other Finnish multipurpose icebreakers are sometimes jokingly referred to as \\"Moulinex ships\\" after the French brand of household appliances and kitchen equipment.

Galician Literature Day was dedicated to him in 2011.  Biography  He was born in Monforte de Lemos, into a family from O Incio. He studied in the school of the Escolapios, and began to write at 15 years of age. After finalising the COU (pre-university course) he left for Madrid, where he started his university studies of Political Sciences and Sociology. After a stay in Monforte working in the family company, devoted to the glass industry, he returned to Madrid to study English, French and German. There he founded the magazine Loia with , Manuel Rivas and his brother Xos√© Manuel Pereiro. In 1981 he went to live in A Coru√±a, where he joined the magazine La Naval. At that time he came into contact with a group of poets: , and , participating in several anthologies such as De amor e desamor (1984) and De amor e desamor II (1985), and collaborating in magazines like La Naval, Trilateral, Anima+l and Luzes of Galiza. He published in 1997, in the magazine Luzes of Galiza, the eight chapters of the short novel N√°ufragos do Paradiso. Between 1983 and 1987 he travelled with Fernando Saco in Europe. He worked translating German, French and English for cinema dubbing and, especially, in television, dubbing as much conventional series (episodes of Dallas and Kung fu) as pornographic film. He only published two collections of poems in his life, Poemas 1981/1991 (1992) and Poes√≠a √∫ltima de amor e enfermidade (1995). In 1996, the year of his death, Poemas para unha Loia, came to light which collected together works of his Madrid period, published in the magazine Loia, and included the essay Modesta proposici√≥n para renunciar a facer xirar a roda hidr√°ulica dunha c√≠clica historia universal da infamia, published in the 27th volume of Luzes de Galiza. With regard to the cause of the death of Pereiro, in spite of suffering AIDS, it was an accumulation of illnesses that finished with liver failure. Officially and in accordance with a sentence of the Provincial Audience of Lugo, after a lawsuit so that the State paid the burial, the reason of his death was intoxication by denatured rapeseed oil.  Recognition  Over the years he demanded that Galician Literature Day be dedicated to him. To this end a new edition of his poetic work was released translated to the Spanish, Catalan and Basque, together with the original texts in Galician. Finally, on June 26, 2010 the Royal Galician Academy published its decision to devote Galician Literature Day 2011 to him.

The CW announced on August 20, 2011, that the season would be increased to 23 episodes, up one episode from the 22-episode pickup the series had previously received. On January 11, 2012, it was announced by the executive producer of the show, Robert Singer, that there was another cliffhanger ending planned for season seven. Reception Critical reception to the season has generally been positive. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 8.83/10 based on 5 reviews. One criticism from reviewers was of the lack of an emotional link between the Leviathans as a whole and the Winchester brothers, an element which had been present in previous seasons. The lack of threat from the monsters was also noted as a downside to the season, though the portrayal of James Patrick Stuart as Dick Roman, using corporate mannerisms and charm mixed with his own self-confidence, was pointed to as a high point of the story arc. The overturn of Mark Sheppard's character Crowley at the final moments of the season, was very surprising for the critics. Many argued that Crowley's successful separation of the Winchester brothers by taking advantage of Dean's imprisonment in Purgatory and the kidnap of both Kevin and Meg was a good cliffhanger going into the next season, and that it opened up many possibilities and questions. Another well-received point was the return of the Impala at the end of season, much to the appreciation of the fans, and Misha Collins' portrayal of the resurrected and traumatized Castiel, which brought a new element to the chemistry between the brothers.

LICRA vs. Yahoo In 2000, French courts demanded Yahoo! block Nazi material in the case LICRA vs. Yahoo.\\"Yahoo! loses Nazi auction case\\", CNN.com, 20 November 2000 In 2001, a U.S. District Court Judge held that Yahoo cannot be forced to comply with French laws against the expression of pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic views, because doing so would violate its right to free expression under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\\"Judge Dismisses French Case Against Yahoo\\" , Stephen Lawson, IDG News, PCWorld, 9 November 2001 In 2006, a U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, finding either a lack of jurisdiction or an inability to enforce its order in France\\"9th Circuit En Banc Panel Rules Against Yahoo in French Internet Censorship Case\\", Tech Law Journal, 12 January 2006 and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider an appeal.\\"Supreme Court won't hear Yahoo!

The LOPPSI 2 law, brought before Parliament in 2009, will authorize a blacklist of sites providing child pornography, established by the Ministry of the Interior, which Internet service providers will have to block. The Loppsi \\"Bill on direction and planning for the performance of domestic security\\" is a far-reaching security bill that seeks to modernise Internet laws, criminalising online identity theft, allowing police to tap Internet connections as well as phone lines during investigations and targeting child pornography by ordering ISPs to filter Internet connections. In 2010, French parliament opposed all the amendments seeking to minimise the use of filtering Internet sites. This move has stirred controversy throughout French society, as the Internet filtering intended to catch child pornographers could also be extended to censor other material. Critics also warn that filtering URLs will have no effect, as distributors of child pornography and other materials are already using encrypted peer-to-peer systems to deliver their wares. In 2011 the Constitutional Council of France validated Article 4 of the LOPPSI 2 law, thereby allowing filtering the Internet without any justice decision.\\"French Constitutional Council Validates Internet Censorship\\" , 10 March 2011, La Quadrature du Net, Paris\\"Le filtrage administratif des sites p√©dophiles autoris√© (The administrative filtering of the sites paedophiles authorized)\\", Emmanuel Berretta, Le Point.fr, 3 March 2011\\"Loppsi 2 : les \\"sages\\" valident le blocage des sites p√©do-pornographiques (Loppsi 2: \\"sages\\" validate the blocking of the child pornography sites)\\", LeMonde.fr, 11 March 2011 The filtered sites blacklist being under the control of an administrative authority depending directly from the Ministry of the Interior without any independent monitoring.

Any executive order has to be approved by the French Council of State, which will have to decide whether Internet censorship authorization can be extended to such an extent by a mere executive order. In 2013, the Parliament eventually repealed the legislative provision on which the decree was based.Le filtrage administratif du web supprim√© par l'Assembl√©e (in French), 28 June 2013, Numerama. October 2011: Cop-watching site blocked On 14 October 2011 a French court ordered French Internet service providers to block the Copwatch Nord Paris I-D-F website. Copwatch Nord-Paris I-D-F, website, accessed 17 October 2011 The website shows pictures and videos of police officers arresting suspects, taunting protesters and allegedly committing acts of violence against members of ethnic minorities. The police said they were particularly concerned about portions of the site showing identifiable photos of police officers, along with personal data, that could lead to violence against the local authorities. However, free speech advocates reacted with alarm. \\"This court order illustrates an obvious will by the French government to control and censor citizens‚Äô new online public sphere,\\" said J√©r√©mie Zimmermann, spokesman for La Quadrature du Net, a Paris-based organization that campaigns against restrictions on the Internet.\\"Court Orders French Cop-Watching Site Blocked\\", Eric Pfanner, Herald-Tribune, 16 October 2011  Twitter case  Following the posting of an antisemitic and racists posts by anonymous users, Twitter removed those posts from its service. Lawsuits were filed by the Union of Jewish Students (UEJF), a French advocacy group and, on 24 January 2013, Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud ordered Twitter to divulge the Personally identifiable information about the user who posted the antisemitic post, charging that the posts violated French laws against hate speech. Twitter responded by saying that it was \\"reviewing its options\\" regarding the French charges. Twitter was given two weeks to comply with the court order before daily fines of ‚Ç¨1,000 (about US$1,300) would be assessed. Issues over jurisdiction arise, because Twitter has no offices nor employees within France, so it is unclear how a French court could sanction Twitter. Pierre-sur-Haute article deletion The French Intelligence Agency General Directorate for Internal Security (DCRI) contacted the Wikimedia Foundation, who refused to remove a French Wikipedia article about the Military radio station of Pierre-sur-Haute because the article only contained publicly available information, in accordance with Wikipedia's verifiability policy. In April 2013 DCRI forced the deletion of the article when it summoned R√©mi Mathis, a Wikipedia volunteer with administrator's access to the French language Wikipedia and ordered him to take down the article that had been online since 2009. DCRI claimed the article contained classified military information and broke French law. Mathis, who had no connection with the article, explained \\"that's not how Wikipedia works\\" and told them he had no right to interfere with editorial content, but was told he would be held in custody and charged if he failed to comply. The article was subsequently restored by a Swiss Wikipedia contributor. The article became the most viewed page on the French Wikipedia as of April 6, 2013. Christophe Henner, vice-president of Wikimedia France, said \\"if the DCRI comes up with the necessary legal papers we will take down the page. We have absolutely no problem with that and have made it a point of honour to respect legal injunctions; it's the method the DCRI used that is shocking.\\"\\"French secret service accused of censorship over Wikipedia page\\", Kim Willsher, The Guardian, 7 April 2013.

The legislation requires that social media sites operating in France be required to remove offending content within 24 hours of notification, or face an initial fine up to . Continuous and repeated offenses could lead to fines up to 4% of global revenue. Specific illegal content related to child pornography and terrorism is required to be removed within 1 hour of being flagged. Such providers can prematurely remove content before it is flagged as well without penalty. In addition to these provision, additional regulations related to hate speech, including requiring service providers to block access to sites that mirror whole or in part sites with hate speech content. The law is similar to Germany's Network Enforcement Act, which was passed in 2017. While the EU had asked France to hold off on passage of the laws until it had completed the Union's own Digital Services Act, France had gone forward with their own version due to their stronger laws against hate speech. The regulation raised consider about the potential for misuse to censor valid criticism and commentary of topics that are related to those deemed illegal, and thus used as a politic tool. La Quadrature du Net stated that previous laws allowing French police to ask for the removal of terrorist content had already been abused to censor political content, even prior to the new regulation.

Habitat Characteristics Habitat characteristics include sediment type, type of bottoms (sand, silt and clay), structures underlying the water surface, and aquatic community structures. These habitats are essential for fish and ecosystem health. The fundamental habitat structure begins with sediment. Erosion is stabilized by submerged aquatic vegetation. There are two main types of bottoms, hard and soft.DeLong, A. K., J. S. Collie, R. I. S. Grant, and N. S. G. C. Program. 2004. Defining essential fish habitat: a model-based approach. Citeseer A study by Christensen at el. (2004) looked at three bottom habitat types (vegetated marsh edge, submerged aquatic vegetation, and shallow non-vegetated bottom) in relation to juvenile brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus). The results from the study showed that brown shrimp selected vegetated areas in salinities 15-25 ppt and they would select vegetated areas over marsh edges when they co-occurred. Finding the areas that had the highest abundance helped to identify EFH of juvenile brown shrimp.Clark, R., and coauthors. 2004.

Web. 22 September 2014. This community can comprise invertebra, coral, hard coral, bryozoans, polychaete worms, tunicates, a variety of fin-fishes, alga, and sponges. Areas of compacted or sheered mud and sediment are also a form of hard bottom.Peterson, C. H., and coauthors. 2000. Synthesis of linkages between benthic and fish communities as a key to protecting essential fish habitat. Bulletin of marine science 66(3):759-774. Soft bottom consists of unconsolidated sediment and unvegetated areas. In some regions soft bottoms are not protected even though they may be primary nursery areas, anadromous fish spawning areas, and anadromous nursery areas. Characteristics that affect soft bottom in relation to organisms that utilize them include sediment grain size, salinity, dissolved oxygen and flow.Street, M. W. 2005.

He graduated from the Royal Military College in 1900 as a \\"Queen's India cadet\\" and placed on the unattached list as a second lieutenant. In 1901, he was moved from the unattached list to the Indian Staff Corps. In 1902 he was promoted to full lieutenant. The only cricket played by Lyall that is recorded from this period is a single non-first-class three-day match for the North-West Frontier Province against the Punjab cricket team in late 1903, in which Lyall played as a lower order batsman. In 1909, Lyall was promoted to captain attached to the 36th Sikhs regiment of the Indian army. In 1911, he appears to have been in England for some time during the cricket season: he played in one County Championship match against Yorkshire in May, scoring an unbeaten 21 in the first innings and 8 in the second. Two months later, he followed that with a second first-class match, this time against the touring Indian cricket team, in which he scored 15 and 11 not out. That was the extent of his first-class cricket and left him with the odd statistic of a batting average higher (at 27.50 runs per innings) than his highest score. Lyall returned to the Indian army.

Simulation allows to predict the behaviour of gas network systems under different conditions. Such predictions can be effectively used to guide decisions regarding the design and operation of the real system.  Simulation types  Depending on the gas flow characteristics in the system there are two states that can be matter of simulation: * Steady state - the simulation does not take into account the gas flow characteristics' variations over time and described by the system of algebraic equations, in general nonlinear ones. * Unsteady state (transient flow analysis) - described either by a partial differential equation or a system of such equations. Gas flow characteristics are mainly functions of time.  Network topology  Gas Network Topology In the gas networks simulation and analysis, matrices turned out to be the natural way of expressing the problem. Any network can be described by set of matrices based on the network topology. Consider the gas network by the graph below. The network consists of one source node (reference node) L1, four load nodes (2, 3, 4 and 5) and seven pipes or branches. For network analysis it is necessary to select at least one reference node. Mathematically, the reference node is referred to as the independent node and all nodal and branch quantities are dependent on it. The pressure at source node is usually known, and this node is often used as the reference node. However, any node in the network may have its pressure defined and can be used as the reference node. A network may contain several sources or other pressure-defined nodes and these form a set of reference nodes for the network. The load nodes are points in the network where load values are known. These loads may be positive, negative or zero. A negative load represents a demand for gas from the network. This may consist in supplying domestic or commercial consumers, filling gas storage holders, or even accounting for leakage in the network. A positive load represents a supply of gas to the network. This may consist in taking gas from storage, source or from another network. A zero load is placed on nodes that do not have a load but are used to represent a point of change in the network topology, such as the junction of several branches. For steady state conditions, the total load on the network is balanced by the inflow into the network at the source node. The interconnection of a network can produce a closed path of branches, known as a loop. In figure, loop A consists of branches p12-p24-p14, loop B consists of p13-p34-p14, and loop C consists of p24-p25-p35-p34. A fourth loop may be defined as p12-p24-p34-p13, but it is redundant if loops A, B and C are also defined. Loops A, B and C are independent ones but the fourth one is not, as it can be derived from A, B and C by eliminating common branches. To define the network topology completely it is necessary to assign a direction to each branch. Each branch direction is assigned arbitrarily and is assumed to be positive direction of flow in the branch. If the flow has the negative value, then the direction of flow is opposite to branch direction. In the similar way, direction is assigned to each loop and flow in the loop. The solutions of problems involving gas network computation of any topology requires such a representation of the network to be found which enables the calculations to be performed in the most simple way. These requirements are met by the graph theory which permits representation of the network structure by means of the incidence properties of the network components and, in consequence, makes such a representation explicit.  Flow equations  The calculation of the pressure drop along the individual pipes of a gas network requires use of the flow equations. Many gas flow equations have been developed and a number have been used by the gas industry. Most are based on the result of gas flow experiments. The result of the particular formula normally varies because these experiments were conducted over different range of flow conditions, and on varying internal surface roughness. Instead, each formula is applicable to a limited range of flow and pipe surface conditions.  Mathematical methods of simulation = Steady state analysis  A gas network is in the steady state when the values of gas flow characteristics are independent of time and system described by the set of nonlinear equations. The goal of simple simulation of a gas network is usually that of computing the values of nodes' pressures, loads and the values of flows in the individual pipes. The pressures at the nodes and the flow rates in the pipes must satisfy the flow equations, and together with nodes' loads must fulfill the first and second Kirchhoff's laws. There are many methods of analyzing the mathematical models of gas networks but they can be divided into two types as the networks, the solvers for low pressure networks and solvers for high pressure networks. The networks equations are nonlinear and are generally solved by some of Newton iteration; rather than use the full set of variables it is possible to eliminate some of them. Based on the type of elimination we can get solution techniques are termed either nodal or loop methods. = Newton-nodal method = The method is based on the set of the nodal equations which are simply mathematical representation of Kirchhoff's first law which states that the inlet and outlet flow at each node should be equal. Initial approximation is made to the nodal pressures. The approximation is then successively corrected until the final solution is reached.  Disadvantages  * Poor convergence characteristics, the method is extremely sensitive to initial conditions.  Advantages  * Does not require extra computation to produce and optimize a set of loops. * Can easily be adapted for optimization tasks. = Newton-loop method = The method is based on the generated loops and the equations are simply mathematical representation of Kirchhoff's second law which states that the sum of the pressure-drops around any loop should be zero. Before using loops method the fundamental set of loops need to be found. Basically the fundamental set of loops can be found by constructing spanning tree for the network. The standard methods for producing spanning tree is based on a breadth-first search or on a depth-first search which are not so efficient for large networks, because the computing time of these methods is proportional to n2, where n is the number of pipes in the network. More efficient method for large networks is the forest method and its computational time is proportional to n*log2n. The loops that are produced from the spanning tree are not the best set that could be produced. There is often significant overlap between loops with some pipes shared between several loops. This usually slows convergence, therefore the loops' reduction algorithm needs to be applied to minimize the loops overlapping. This is usually performed by replacing the loops in the original fundamental set by smaller loops produced by linear combination of the original set.  Disadvantages  * It requires extra computation to produce and optimize a set of loops. * The dimension of the equations to be solved is smaller but they are much less sparse.  Advantages  * The main advantage is that the equation can be solved very efficiently with an iterative method that avoids the need of matrix factorization and consequently has a minimal requirement for storage; this makes it very attractive for low pressure networks with a large number of pipes. * Fast convergence which is less sensitive to the initial conditions. = Newton loop-node method = The Newton loop-node method is based on Kirchhoff‚Äôs first and second laws. The Newton loop-node method is the combination of the Newton nodal and loop methods and does not solve loop equations explicitly. The loop equations are transformed to an equivalent set of nodal equations, which are then solved to yield the nodal pressures. The nodal pressures are used then to calculate the corrections to the chord flows (which is synonymous to loop flows), and the tree branch flows are obtained from them.  Disadvantages  * Since set of nodal equations are solved nodal Jacobi matrix is used which is more sparse then the equivalent loop Jacobi matrix which may have negative impact on computational efficiency and usability.  Advantages  * Good convergence characteristics of loop method are maintained. * No need to define and optimize the loops.  A Novel Approach of Gas Network Modelling  Having a new reliable method for gas network modelling with fast calculation and precise results can be an option to replace numerical solutions especially for large gas networks, such as those in continental Europe or North America which contain several hundred nodes and pipelines and where large computation power is required. This new approach is a computational method which helps in producing faster results, and when the modelling of NG networks is coupled with other energy systems for example the Electrical Network faster and less computational demanding results are of key importance.  Unsteady state analysis = Computer simulation  The importance of the mathematical methods' efficiency arises from the large scale of simulated network. It is required that the computation costs of the simulation method be low, this is related to the computation time and computer storage. At the same time the accuracy of the computed values must acceptable for the particular model.  References  * * *Ekhtiari,A. Dassios, I. Liu, M. Syron, E.

The Guardian, 18 March 2014. Accessed 2 October 2017Helen S and Wendy, \\"Childcare Vouchers\\". MoneySavingExpert.com. Accessed 2 October 2017 However, as of 4 October 2018, schemes are closed to new members as the system is phased out in favour of the tax-free childcare scheme. The scheme was normally offered as a salary sacrifice scheme, which means that UK parents who are in the scheme are able to sacrifice part of their salary in order to obtain childcare vouchers (of an equal amount). In doing this the parents do not pay any tax or national insurance on the amount contributed to the childcare vouchers scheme up to specified limits. Due to this tax efficiency, the childcare voucher scheme has limits in place, after which you would pay for childcare in the usual taxable fashion. For example, a parent given ¬£55 per week (¬£243 per month) in Childcare Vouchers after taking a salary sacrifice of the same amount, will then benefit by saving up to ¬£933 tax/NIC.  Businesses benefit too  The nature of the scheme has allowed many businesses to benefit from running a scheme too. Although initially aimed at UK working parents, by providing a scheme businesses essentially lowered their own national insurance contributions as the vouchers are exempt from employer's NICs. Businesses also found other benefits in an increase in staff satisfaction and a reduction in staff turnover, saving indirectly on costs such as employing and training staff.  Eligibility  UK working parents are eligible. The scheme is not provided on a per-child basis, but on a per person basis, so both parents can claim under the scheme rules. The scheme can be available at the same time as working tax credits, however, this may not always be beneficial. It is possible to use a calculator to ensure that you are both going to save money and to work out how much you might be able to save.  Obtaining vouchers  Childcare vouchers are provided either by an employer, usually through a childcare voucher scheme provider that an employer chooses. If you would like to know if your company offers childcare vouchers scheme and who your childcare voucher scheme is provided by you should ask your HR or payroll department who your provider is, or encourage them to sign up with a provider. There are many childcare voucher scheme providers available, many of whom offer extra benefits on top of the childcare voucher scheme.  History  The Childcare Voucher Scheme was first introduced by Sue Harvey, Managing Director of the Luncheon Voucher Group in 1989. Since then many people have benefited from using the scheme. In 2009 a petition was started on the \\"Number 10\\" website in order to stop the government from shutting down the scheme. Due to the recession the government had been considering shutting the scheme down and therefore, earning a lot more in tax, however, Gordon Brown the Prime Minister at the time, decided against it. The petition finished with 93,000 signatories on it, and although now closed, is still available for viewing (Wikipedia blocks the word petition so it cannot be included in references). In April 2011, the government did make cuts to the scheme ensuring that high earners benefited less from the scheme. This is achieved by restricting the amounts that higher and additional rate taxpayers can receive tax and NI exempt. * Basic rate taxpayers can have up to ¬£55 a week (¬£243 a month) tax and NI exempt * Higher rate taxpayers can have up to ¬£28 a week (¬£124 a month) tax and NI exempt * Additional rate taxpayers can have up to ¬£25 a week (¬£110 a month) tax and NI exempt The restrictions only apply to those who joined the scheme on or after 6 April 2011. Those who were already receiving childcare vouchers on this date can receive ¬£243 a month tax and NI exempt until they stop receiving vouchers for longer than 12 months, change employer or no longer qualify for the scheme. On 29 March 2018, as part of The Income Tax (Limited Exemptions for Qualifying Childcare Vouchers and other Childcare) (Relevant Day) Regulations 2018 it was announced that Childcare vouchers would close to new members as of 4 October 2018. Those still on a scheme on that date can continue to use childcare vouchers until such time as they change employers or switch to the tax-free childcare scheme.Katie Scott, \\"Government confirms childcare voucher scheme will close in October\\", , Accessed 6 December 2018  References External links * Government better off Calculator Category:Taxation in the United Kingdom Category:Child care ","title":"Childcare voucher scheme"},{"id":"31631124","text":"The 1954 Oregon gubernatorial election took place on November 2, 1954.

Cab, Bob?\\" is the sixth episode of the first season of the animated television series Bob's Burgers. \\"Sheesh! Cab, Bob?\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 6, 2011. The episode was written by Jon Schroeder and directed by Jennifer Coyle. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 4.91 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Kevin Kline, Steve Agee, Andy Kindler, David Herman, Jay Johnston, Jack McBrayer and Oscar Nunez. Plot Tina's 13th birthday is coming up, and Linda suggests to Bob that they should make it extra-special since she will become a teenager. Tina wants to have a party with a smoke machine and streamers and invite people from her class and more. She also wants the party to have a romantic moment with classmate Jimmy Pesto Jr., the eldest son of Bob's business rival, nemesis, and owner of the restaurant across the street, Jimmy Pesto (Jay Johnston). Bob believes they can't afford what Tina wants, but Linda insists they must find a way. Bob asks the restaurant's landlord Mr. Fischoeder (Kevin Kline) for an extension on their rent. He refuses, instead offering Bob one of his side businesses so he can earn extra money as a taxi cab driver. Bob accepts the offer while Louise becomes Tina's kissing coordinator as a birthday present to her to get ready for the expected kissing moment with Jimmy Jr. On the first night of his job, Bob starts to enjoy driving around the city, even befriending three transgender prostitutes: Glitter (Steve Agee), Marbles (Jack McBrayer), and Cha-Cha (Oscar Nunez). Tina starts inviting classmates to her party, including Jimmy Jr., who needs permission from his father for the R.S.V.P.. Unfortunately, Jimmy Sr. forbids Jr. to come because of his rivalry with Bob, and Tina refuses to have a party without Jimmy Jr. Bob tries to talk sense into Jimmy Pesto, but Jimmy refuses unless Bob shaves his mustache and brings it to him as part of his collection. Tina disrespects him for his refusal to shave his mustache since he does not want to negotiate with the Pesto family. After a night out with the sex workers, Bob deliriously comes back to the restaurant (due to drinking alcohol and possibly taking crack). Linda tells Bob that Tina agrees to attend the party, but only for a few minutes. Bob wakes up half an hour late for the party, and finds out it is not going well: the boys and girls aren't dancing, Gene in his role as the DJ and Mort working as the magician are appalling. Bob remembered that he invited not just his regular transgender customers but others, including Marshmallow (David Herman) and a homeless man. Tina is disappointed in Bob for what he's done, and refuses to talk to him. The trans women mention to Tina that Bob worked really hard for the party and remind her that she has a good father who worked two jobs to pay for her party. She apologizes to Bob for what she said to him and lets him know that he already made the party perfect, even without Jimmy Jr. present. However, Bob has already shaved his mustache off. The trans women recognize Jimmy Sr. as one of their dates, known as \\"Baby Num Num\\", a \\"diaper lover.\\" Bob brings the trans women over to Jimmy's restaurant to threaten him about his personal dates. He concedes with Bob's demands; Bob keeps his mustache hair, albeit in a plastic baggie, and Jimmy Jr. is allowed to attend the party. Jimmy Jr. comes to the party, and Tina is grateful to Bob for what he has done. Tina and Jimmy Jr. kiss under the party's disco ball, with Louise's encouragement, and Gene plays the Thompson Twins' song, If You Were Here, creating a reference to the ending of the film Sixteen Candles. The episode finishes with everyone enjoying the party. Reception In its original American broadcasting, \\"Sheesh! Cab, Bob?\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.91 million viewers and received a 2.7 rating/4% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, an improvement from last episode and became the highest rated episode of the season to be aired after the first two episodes. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, saying \\"As funny as the episode is, it's also genuinely sweet by the end, with Bob and Tina bonding over how much work he's done. Of course, that just makes his drunken bender with sex workers that much funnier, as well as Louise acting as Tina's kissing coordinator and sending her to boot camp.\\" References External links  * * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 1) episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes Category:Transgender-related television episodes Category:LGBT-related animation Category:Television episodes about birthdays ","title":"Sheesh!

Typically, the animal is endemic to the west coast shores of the North and South Islands, where wave action is increased. They do not usually inhabit ecosystems that have reduced wave action and calm conditions as they prefer a higher-energy environment. These marine invertebrates range in color from pink to purple, but can also be orange. They typically have eleven arms, but sometimes they may have either ten or twelve. As full-grown adults, they are 8 to 10 cm in diameter. Reproduction The starfish engages in external fertilization in which the female releases the eggs and the male releases the sperm. Fertilization occurs in the water column. Its breeding season is the summer. During this time, male and female starfish can be found extremely close or even on top of one another. Consequently, spawning occurring several times from October through January. Life cycle S. australis, like the majority of other starfish, exhibits two life stages, planktonic and benthic. Once the eggs of the invertebrate are fertilized, bilaterally symmetrical planktonic larvae are formed. At this stage, these larvae are known as bipinnaria. The planktotrophic larval stage for S. australis will last about 6 months, with larvae typically settling any time from May through July. It is during this time that the larvae, now brachiolaria, enters the benthic phase of life. The brachiolaria will settle exclusively on the red algae Mesophyllum insigne, their only source of food until they mature. M. insigne can be found growing on both boulders and reefs located in the lower intertidal zone and subtidal zone. Both M. insigne and the juvenile starfish are limited to the lower levels of the ecosystems as they have low tolerances for desiccation. Growth and maturation The starfish can begin the metamorphosis into an adult once its characteristic radial symmetry is developed. Right after metamorphosis, the critter has a diameter of about 0.85 mm. Initial growth of the starfish is slow until the addition of the 6th arm, but once that happens, the addition of new arms occurs more rapidly. Arm 7 will grow in between arms 6 and 1, arm 8 will grow in between arms 7 and 1, and arm 9 will grow in between arms 8 and 1, and so on. The growth of arms occurs in a clockwise pattern when viewing the animal aborally, the side containing the buttocks of the organism. The sea star will become sexually mature upon reaching size of about 5 to 8 cm in diameter. Diet Juveniles, until reaching about 0.8 cm in diameter, when they are about 7 to 8 months old, feed purely on M. insigne. The starfish will remain at the M. insigne nursery for about a year. This coralline alga is rich in calcium which is beneficial for the young starfish and its skeletal growth. After this stage, the diet of S. australis shifts to include, but is not limited to, P. canaliculus. The starfish, as it increases in size to about 2 to 2.5 cm in diameter and begins to mature, will then solely feed on the mussels. The diet of this starfish during the adult stage consists mainly of Perna canaliculus, the New Zealand green mussel. This carnivorous shift in diet is consistent with a relocation from the nursery algal spaces to close reefs containing dense populations of P. canaliculus. The mussel beds ultimately become the permanent home for this invertebrate. In order to feed on the mussel, Stichaster australis utilizes its tubular feet to tug on the sides of the mussel‚Äôs shell. Once the shell is broken, the starfish inserts its stomach to digest the innards of the prey. Once the sea star is finished digesting its prey, it will swallow its own stomach back into its own body. After feeding, the starfish will leave white marks on the mussel, a remnant of the predatory relationship. S. australis rising from the rock near Auckland Research This predatory relationship between starfish and mussels in this intertidal zone was studied by Robert T. Paine in a paper published in 1971. The scientist removed S. australis from the ecosystem for 9 months. In this time, P. canaliculus, with the removal of its primary predator, was able to proliferate and increase its presence and hold in the ecosystem. When expanding their area within the intertidal, the mussels overgrew and outcompeted the other species, decreasing the species richness in the area from 20 species to 14 species. The mussels expanded its vertical distribution and 40% of the available space in the ecosystem was inhabited by these organisms. Paine proposed that S. australis is a keystone species of the rocky intertidal of New Zealand since it is responsible for maintaining not only the intertidal zonation, but the diversity of species within this ecosystem.

During World War II, she worked on the Manhattan Project at Princeton University and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where she prepared the first sample of pure uranium-235 at the laboratory. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin, she became professor of physics at Milwaukee-Downer College in 1929. After the war, she became interested in health physics. She worked in the Health Physics Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and established the professional certification agency known as the American Board of Health Physics. Early life and education Elda Emma Anderson was born in Green Lake, Wisconsin, on October 5, 1899, to Edwin A. Anderson (born in Wisconsin) and his wife, Lena (n√©e Heller) (born in Germany). Anderson was one of three children. Although she was captivated by numbers at an early age, Anderson actually sought to become a kindergarten teacher. This would shift to an interest in science later, partially due to the influence of her older sister, who was an assistant chemistry instructor. As a whole, although her family had certain lofty expectations for their younger daughter, they all supported her in her academic endeavors. Anderson earned a Bachelor of Arts (AB) degree from Ripon College in 1922, then a master of arts (AM) in physics from the University of Wisconsin in 1924.Personnel Roster, circa 1944-1945, Collection A-84-019, Box 4-8, LANL Archives; \\"Obituaries: Elda E.

From 1924 to 1927, she taught at Estherville Junior College in Iowa, where she was the dean of physics, chemistry and mathematics.Editor. (19 April 1961). Atom Bomb worker Dies, Dr. Elda Anderson. The Milwaukee Journal. Milwaukee, Wisconsin. p. 16. In 1929, she became professor of physics at Milwaukee-Downer College (an elite women's college later absorbed into Lawrence University), then head of the physics department in 1934. Career and research Elda E. Anderson's Los Alamos wartime security badge In 1941 Anderson completed her PhD at the University of Wisconsin, writing her thesis on \\"Low energy levels in the atomic spectra Co VII and Ni VIII\\". Immediately after finishing her PhD, Anderson requested time off from her position at Milwaukee-Downer College, in order to conduct war research related to the Manhattan Project at the Office of Scientific Research and Development at Princeton University. Not long after, Anderson was recruited to continue her work specifically at Los Alamos Laboratory. At her new location, Anderson studied basic fission parameters, including analyzing the time delays associated with the absorption and emission of neutrons. Such work often entailed working upwards of sixteen hours a day. Among other accomplishments at Los Alamos, Anderson prepared the first sample of pure uranium-235 at the laboratory. While there, she lived in a dormitory, and being older than most of the other residents (she was aged fifty), she was put in charge. She often worked at night, wearing jeans and a plaid shirt ‚Äì not the usual attire for a woman at the time. Following the war, in 1947, Anderson left Los Alamos and returned to teaching at Milwaukee-Downer College, but her involvement in atomic physics led to an interest in the health effects of radiation. In 1949, she left teaching to begin a career in health physics. At the Health Physics Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which was only five years old when she joined, she became the first chief of education and training. She spent her career helping to establish the new training program in health physics, teaching and advising graduate fellows in health physics from 1949.Morgan, K. Z. (1965). Graduate Programs for the Health Physicist in the United States. Health Physics. 11(9): 895‚Äì915. In 1949, Anderson moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee to become the first chief of education and training in the Health Physics Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Anderson also worked with faculty members at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, to create a master's degree program in health physics at that institution. In addition, she was responsible for training military personnel, state and federal officers and university professors who are currently the leaders in health physics. Outside of necessary obligations, Anderson was also known for helping students with problems both academic and personal, lending helpful guidance. In some cases, Anderson was known to have given loans to students, as well share a drink in troubling times. Anderson organized the first international course in her field in Stockholm in 1955; she organized similar courses in Belgium in 1957 and Mumbai in 1958.Anderson, Elda E. (1959).

She supported the establishment of the Health Physics Society in 1955, serving as secretary pro tem and then charter secretary, and eventually as president of the Society from 1959 to 1960. In 1960, she established the professional certification agency known as the American Board of Health Physics.Moeller, D. W. (1972). History of the American Board of Health Physics. American Journal of Public Health. 62(2): 247‚Äì251. Despite contracting leukemia in 1956, Anderson remained undeterred in her career and maintained her position for several years until her eventual death in 1961. Death and legacy In 1956, Anderson, who never married and had no children, developed leukemia. She died nearly five years later in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, of breast cancer and leukemia, possibly as the result of her work with radioactive materials, on 17 April 1961. Anderson was buried at Green Lake Cemetery in Green Lake, Wisconsin. She was survived by her sister, Lucille McConnell and niece, Natalie Tarr Millemann.

The history/legend behind the construction of this temple is, the then ruler, His Highness Anizham Thirunal Marthandavarma was surrounded by his enemies, arguably the high profile \\"Ettuveettil Pillamar\\" while he was near the place where the temple is now situated. The king was trying to hide himself in a safe place. At that time, a small boy was seen there and this boy advised the king to hide himself inside the hollow trunk of a huge jack fruit tree nearby. The king heeded to this advice and was saved from his enemies. Later, the king tried to ascertain the identity of the boy, but could not. The king then strongly believed that it was in fact Lord Krishna/Unnikrishna himself who saved his life and he decided to build a temple for Lord Krishna, as a gratitude, at the exact place where he hid inside the jack fruit tree and thus Neyyattinkara Sree Krishna temple came into existence. The huge jack fruit tree which helped the king save his life came to be known as \\"Ammachi Plavu\\" (Mother/Grandmother jack fruit tree, personifying one who protected the king). Until AD 1970-75, the offshoots of the original tree was present bearing a huge amount of jack fruits, but these offshoots had to be cut in order to preserve the actual hollow trunk where the king hid himself. At present, the hollow trunk is in a preserved state (by Archaeological Department) and is visible to all devotees who visit this temple. Temple Complex Neyyattinkara Sreekrishna Temple, situated in a vast land with much greenery, is regarded as the Guruvayur of Trivandrum district. The temple is built in traditional Kerala architecture and is decorated with beautiful artistic sculptures. The main gopuram (gateway) of the temple displays a beautiful scene from Bhagavad Gita - Lord Krishna offering teaching to Arjuna. Entrance Gopura of the temple The sanctum sanctorum is built in the traditional Kerala style. Now the door to the Shri Kovil is painted with gold. There is a huge Gopuram in front of the Shri Kovil. Inside the main complex, there are the deities of Ganesha, and Dharmashashtha. Outside the main complex, Nagaraja is worshipped. Currently, work has been going on to make a nadappanthal all around the main arena, so that pilgrims could avoid extremes of weather. This is done by advisory committee with the help of devotees of Unnikannan. The walls of the Sanctum are painted with various pictures, depicting the life of Shree Krishna and various other Gods. There is an elephant named \\"Neyyattinkara Kannan\\" in the temple. Customs and traditions Ashtami Rohini, Vishu, Navarathri, Mandalapooja are observed with great fervour in this temple. The main festival of the temple is its Annual Festival, which is during Meenam. It commences with the \\"Kodiyett\\", where the main priest of the temple will hoist a Sacred flag atop the gopura, signifying the commencement of the festival. It ends with an \\"Aaraatt\\", which falls on a Rohini star day in the Malayalam month of Meenam, when the deity is taken out of the temple, and is dipped in water, in the nearby Graamam in the Neyyar river. In the midst of the festival, jewels of Unnikkannan will be brought from another temple, where they are ceremoniously kept for safekeeping. The main pooja of that evening has much significance, where hundreds throng to get a glimpse of Unnikkannan, adoring all the divine jewels. During Navarathri, three deities will rest at the temple, on their way to Shri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Trivandrum. They are Shri Kumaraswami, from Kumarakoil temple; Shri Munnuutti Nanga; and Shri Sarawathi Devi. They will stay overnight at the Krishna Temple, and leave for Trivandrum next morning. There will be grand arrangements all along the way and at the temple for welcoming the deities. Deities in the temple The presiding deity is Sreekrishna, in the form of Balakrishna holding butter in both hands. West-facing idol is made of panchaloha. Legend says, the original idol was made of wood but Lord Krishna was not amused of this, and while that idol was being carried in a boat across the Neyyar, the boat got stuck and would not move. In order to keep the time frame intact, another idol was installed at the temple. The Golden Flagmast at the Temple Upadevathas (other deities) in the temple premises include Shri Ganesha, Shri Dharmasastha and Shri Nagaraja. Administration This is one of the major temples under the Travancore Devaswom Board. Every two years, an advisory committee (Kshetra Upadeshaka Samithi) comprising a President, Secretary and members is selected from among the neighborhood people. This committee undertakes the task of organizing the various festivals in this temple.

It is an aromatic compound and a derivative of benzene, where benzene's six hydrogen atoms have each been replaced by a methyl group. In 1929 Kathleen Lonsdale reported the crystal structure of hexamethylbenzene, demonstrating that the central ring is hexagonal and flat and thereby ending an ongoing debate about the physical parameters of the benzene system. This was a historically significant result, both for the field of X-ray crystallography and for understanding aromaticity. The compound can be prepared by reacting phenol with methanol at elevated temperatures over a suitable solid catalyst such as alumina. The mechanism of the process has been studied extensively, with several intermediates having been identified. Alkyne trimerisation of dimethylacetylene also yields hexamethylbenzene in the presence of a suitable catalyst. Hexamethylbenzene can be oxidised to mellitic acid, which is found in nature as its aluminium salt in the rare mineral mellite. Hexamethylbenzene can be used as a ligand in organometallic compounds. An example from organoruthenium chemistry shows structural change in the ligand associated with changes in the oxidation state of the metal centre, though the same change is not observed in the analogous organoiron system. In 2016 the crystal structure of the hexamethylbenzene dication was reported in Angewandte Chemie International Edition, showing a pyramidal structure in which a single carbon atom has a bonding interaction with six other carbon atoms. This structure was \\"unprecedented\\", as the usual maximum valence of carbon is four, and it attracted attention from New Scientist, Chemical & Engineering News, and Science News. The structure does not violate the octet rule since the carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds formed are not two-electron bonds, and is pedagogically valuable for illustrating that a carbon atom \\"can [directly bond] with more than four atoms\\". Steven Bachrach has demonstrated that the compound is hypercoordinated but not hypervalent, and also explained its aromaticity. The idea of describing the bonding in species like this through the lens of organometallic chemistry was proposed in 1975, soon after was first observed. Nomenclature and properties According to the Blue Book, this chemical can be systematically named as 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexamethylbenzene. The locants (the numbers in front of the name) are superfluous, however, as the name hexamethylbenzene uniquely identifies a single substance and thus is the formal IUPAC name for the compound. It is an aromatic compound, with six œÄ electrons (satisfying H√ºckel's rule) delocalised over a cyclic planar system; each of the six ring carbon atoms is sp2 hybridised and displays trigonal planar geometry, while each methyl carbon is tetrahedral with sp3 hybridisation, consistent with the empirical description of its structure. When recrystallised from ethanol, solid hexamethylbenzene occurs as colourless to white crystalline orthorhombic prisms or needles with a melting point of 165‚Äì166 ¬∞C, a boiling point of 268 ¬∞C, and a density of 1.0630 g cm‚àí3. Orthorhombic orange-yellow crystals of a 1:1 mixture of picryl chloride and hexamethylbenzene have been reported to possess alternating stacks of each component, probably due to œÄ-stacking of the aromatic systems. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents including benzene and ethanol. Hexamethylbenzene is sometimes called mellitene, a name derived from mellite, a rare honey-coloured mineral; meli (GEN melitos) is the Greek word for honey.. Mellite is composed of a hydrated aluminium salt of benzenehexacarboxylic acid (mellitic acid), with formula . Mellitic acid itself can be derived from the mineral, and subsequent reduction yields mellitene. Conversely, mellitene can be oxidised to form mellitic acid: center Treatment of hexamethylbenzene with a superelectrophilic mixture of methyl chloride and aluminum trichloride (a source of MeŒ¥‚äïCl---Œ¥‚äñAlCl3) gives heptamethylbenzenium cation, one of the first carbocations to be directly observed. 450x450px Structure In 1927 Kathleen Lonsdale determined the solid structure of hexamethylbenzene from crystals provided by Christopher Kelk Ingold. Her X-ray diffraction analysis was published in Nature and was subsequently described as \\"remarkable ... for that early date\\". Lonsdale described the work in her book Crystals and X-Rays, explaining that she recognised that, though the unit cell was triclinic, the diffraction pattern had pseudo-hexagonal symmetry that allowed the structural possibilities to be restricted sufficiently for a trial-and-error approach to produce a model. This work definitively showed that hexamethylbenzene is flat and that the carbon-to-carbon distances within the ring are the same, providing crucial evidence in understanding the nature of aromaticity. Preparation In 1880 Joseph Achille Le Bel and William H. Greene reported what has been described as an \\"extraordinary\\" zinc chloride- catalysed one-pot synthesis of hexamethylbenzene from methanol. At the catalyst's melting point (283 ¬∞C), the reaction has a Gibbs free energy (ŒîG) of ‚àí1090 kJ mol‚àí1 and can be idealised as: :15 ‚Üí \\\\+ 3 \\\\+ 15 Le Bel and Greene rationalised the process as involving aromatisation by condensation of methylene units, formed by dehydration of methanol molecules, followed by complete Friedel‚ÄìCrafts methylation of the resulting benzene ring with chloromethane generated in situ. The major products were a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons, with hexamethylbenzene as a minor product. Hexamethylbenzene is also produced as a minor product in the Friedel‚ÄìCrafts alkylation synthesis of durene from p-xylene, and can be produced by alkylation in good yield from durene or pentamethylbenzene. Hexamethylbenzene is typically prepared in the gas phase at elevated temperatures over solid catalysts. An early approach to preparing hexamethylbenzene involved reacting a mixture of acetone and methanol vapours over an alumina catalyst at 400 ¬∞C. Combining phenols with methanol over alumina in a dry carbon dioxide atmosphere at 410‚Äì440 ¬∞C also produces hexamethylbenzene, though as part of a complex mixture of anisole (methoxybenzene), cresols (methylphenols), and other methylated phenols. An Organic Syntheses preparation, using methanol and phenol with an alumina catalyst at 530 ¬∞C, gives approximately a 66% yield, though synthesis under different conditions has also been reported. center The mechanisms of such surface-mediated reactions have been investigated, with an eye to achieving greater control over the outcome of the reaction, especially in search of selective and controlled ortho-methylation. Both anisole and pentamethylbenzene have been reported as intermediates in the process. Valentin Koptyug and co-workers found that both hexamethylcyclohexadienone isomers (2,3,4,4,5,6- and 2,3,4,5,6,6-) are intermediates in the process, undergoing methyl migration to form the 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexamethylbenzene carbon skeleton. Trimerisation of three 2-butyne (dimethylacetylene) molecules yields hexamethylbenzene. The reaction is catalyzed by triphenylchromium tri- tetrahydrofuranate or by a complex of triisobutylaluminium and titanium tetrachloride. center Uses Hexamethylbenzene has uses in various areas of chemical research. The oxidation of it to form 2,3,4,5,6,6-hexamethyl-2,4-cyclohexadienone (reportedly an intermediate in its formation from phenol) has been reported in Organic Syntheses using trifluoroperacetic acid or an acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide: center It has also been used as a solvent for 3He-NMR spectroscopy. Just as with benzene itself, the electron-rich aromatic system in hexamethylbenzene allows it to act as a ligand in organometallic chemistry. The electron-donating nature of the methyl groups‚Äîboth that there are six of them individually and that there are six meta pairs among them‚Äîenhance the basicity of the central ring by six to seven orders of magnitude relative to benzene. Examples of such complexes have been reported for a variety of metal centres, including cobalt, chromium, iron, rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium, and titanium. Known cations of sandwich complexes of cobalt and rhodium with hexamethylbenzene take the form (M = Co, Fe, Rh, Ru; n = 1, 2), where the metal centre is bound by the œÄ electrons of the two arene moieties, and can easily be synthesised from appropriate metal salts by ligand exchange, for example: : \\\\+ 2 ‚Üí \\\\+ 2 The complexes can undergo redox reactions. The rhodium and cobalt dications undergo a one-electron reduction with a suitable active metal (aluminium for the cobalt system, zinc for the rhodium), and the equations describing the reactions in the cobalt system are as follows: :3 \\\\+ Al ‚Üí 3 \\\\+ moiety changes with the oxidation state of the metal centre Left: n = 2, [RuII(Œ∑6-C6(CH3)6)2]2+ Right: n = 0, [Ru0(Œ∑4-C6(CH3)6)(Œ∑6-C6(CH3)6)] Methyl groups omitted for clarity. The electron-pairs involved with carbon‚Äìruthenium bonding are in red. In the field of organoruthenium chemistry, the redox interconversion of the analogous two-electron reduction of the dication and its neutral product occurs at ‚àí1.02 V in acetonitrile and is accompanied by a structural change. The hapticity of one of the hexamethylbenzene ligands changes with the oxidation state of the ruthenium centre, the dication [Ru(Œ∑6-C6(CH3)6)2]2+ being reduced to [Ru(Œ∑4-C6(CH3)6)(Œ∑6-C6(CH3)6)], with the structural change allowing each complex to comply with the 18-electron rule and maximise stability. The equivalent iron(II) complex undergoes a reversible one-electron reduction (at ‚àí0.48 V in aqueous ethanol), but the two-electron reduction (at ‚àí1.46 V) is irreversible, suggesting a change in structure different from that found in the ruthenium system. Dication Pyramidal carbocation with composition The isolation of an ion with composition was first reported from investigations of hexamethyl Dewar benzene in the 1960s; a pyramidal structure was suggested based on NMR evidence and subsequently supported by disordered crystal structure data. In the early 1970s theoretical work led by Hepke Hogeveen predicted the existence of a pyramidal dication , and the suggestion was soon supported by experimental evidence. Spectroscopic investigation of the two-electron oxidation of benzene at very low temperatures (below 4 K) shows that a hexagonal dication forms and then rapidly rearranges into a pyramidal structure: 600px Three-dimensional representation of having a rearranged pentagonal-pyramid framework Direct, two-electron oxidation of hexamethylbenzene would be expected to result in a near-identical rearrangement to a pyramidal carbocation, but attempts to synthesise it in bulk by this method have been unsuccessful. However, a modification of the Hogeveen approach was reported in 2016, along with a high-quality crystal structure determination of . The pyramidal core is about 1.18 √•ngstr√∂ms high, and each of the methyl groups on the ring is located slightly above that base plane to give a somewhat inverted tetrahedral geometry for the carbons of the base of the pyramid. The preparation method involved treating the epoxide of hexamethyl Dewar benzene with magic acid, which formally abstracts an oxide anion () to form the dication: 500px Though indirect spectroscopic evidence and theoretical calculations previously pointed to their existence, the isolation and structural determination of a species with a hexacoordinate carbon bound only to other carbon atoms is unprecedented, and has attracted comment in Chemical & Engineering News, New Scientist, Science News, and ZME Science. The carbon atom at the top of the pyramid is bonding with six other atoms, an unusual arrangement as the usual maximum valence for this element is four. The molecule is aromatic and avoids exceeding the octet on carbon by having only a total of six electrons in the five bonds between the base of the pyramid and its apex. That is, each of the vertical edges of the pyramid is only a partial bond rather than a normal covalent bond that would have two electrons shared between two atoms. Although the top carbon does bond to six others, it does so using a total of no more than eight electrons. Computational organic chemist Steven Bachrach discussed the dication, noting that the weak bonds forming the upright edges of the pyramid, shown as dashed lines in the structure he drew, have a Wiberg bond order of about 0.54; it follows that the total bond order is 5 √ó 0.54 + 1 = 3.7 < 4, and thus the species is not hypervalent, though it is hypercoordinate. The differences in bonding in the dication‚Äîthe ring having aromatic character and the vertical edges being weak partial bonds‚Äîare reflected in variations of the carbon‚Äìcarbon bond lengths: the ring bonds are , the bonds to the methyl groups are , and the vertical edges are Bachrach rationalised the three- dimensional aromaticity of the dication by considering it as comprising the ring as a four-electron donor and topped by the fragment, which provides two electrons, for a total of six electrons in the aromatic cage, in line with H√ºckel's rule for n = 1. From the perspective of organometallic chemistry, the species can be viewed as This satisfies the octet rule by binding a carbon(IV) centre () to an aromatic Œ∑5‚Äìpentamethylcyclopentadienyl anion (six-electron donor) and methyl anion (two-electron donor), analogous to the way the gas- phase organozinc monomer having the same ligands bound to a zinc(II) centre () satisfies the 18 electron rule on the metal. Chemist Dean Tantillo from the University of California, Davis, commented to Science News that \\"[i]t's super important that people realize that, although we're taught carbon can only have four friends, carbon can be associated with more than four atoms\\" and added that the \\"carbon isn't making six bonds in the sense that we usually think of a carbon-carbon bond as a two-electron bond.\\" Moritz Malischewski, who carried out the work with Konrad Seppelt, commented on the motivation for undertaking the work, saying: \\"It is all about the challenge and the possibility to astonish chemists about what can be possible.\\"  References  Category:Alkylbenzenes Category:Ligands ","title":"Hexamethylbenzene"},{"id":"31631468","text":"Chuvanna Vithukal () is a 1978 Indian Malayalam socio-political film, directed by P.

It is a parasitoid of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), an invasive species which has destroyed tens of millions of ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against the emerald ash borer (EAB), American scientists in conjunction with the Chinese Academy of Forestry began searching in 2003 for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasp species, including Spathius agrili. S. agrili was discovered in Tianjin, China where it is a prevalent parasitoid of EAB larvae in stands of an introduced ash species (Fraxinus velutina), and an endemic ash species (Fraxinus mandshurica). S. agrili has been recorded to attack and kill up to 90 percent of EAB larvae. This wasp is a gregarious ectoparasitoid, meaning it lays multiple eggs on the surface of its host, and the larva feed externally. The life cycle of S. agrili was found to be synchronized with that of its preferred host stages - the emergence of adult wasps took place when third and fourth-instar larvae of EAB were available. The female wasps oviposit through the tree bark, paralyze the host larva and lay a clutch of eggs on the integument. The eggs hatch and the wasp larvae feed on the paralyzed host. When the larvae mature, they spin a cocoon and pupate within the host gallery. Spathuis overwinter as pupae within their cocoons under the bark of ash trees and emerge as adults in the summer. Biological control S. agrili, and two other species of parasitoid wasps (Tetrastichus planipennisi, and Oobius agrili), were introduced and released into the United States as biological control agents of the EAB. However, of the three, Tetrastichus planipennisi has been the most effective at parasitizing EAB and establishing self- sustaining populations. Detailed research was conducted on the wasps before they were approved for release as biocontrol agents. Laboratory methods have been developed for continuous rearing of this and other species of EAB parasitoid wasps. Extensive tests of the specificity of these parasitoids on native beetles and other insects were carried out. No-choice laboratory assays of larval wood-boring insects from China and North America showed they were capable of attacking other species of Agrilus, although success of parasitism was significantly lower in species other than EAB. S. agrili was only attracted to select species of Fraxinus and to Salix babylonica. In natural settings, S. agrili will be unlikely to encounter and parasitize non-target larvae as it does not search other tree species. This, in addition to other tests of host specificity, led to approval of the wasp for controlled releases in specific study sites in the United States for further research.

The 2004 Complementary Indigenous Survey reported 53,019 Qulla households living in Argentina. They moved freely between the borders of Argentina and Bolivia. Their lands are part of the yungas or high altitude forests at the edge of the Amazon rainforest. History The Qulla have lived in their region for centuries. Sillustani is a prehistoric Qulla cemetery in Peru, with elaborate stone chullpas. Several groups made up the Qulla people, including the Zenta, and Gispira. The Qulla came into contact with Spaniards in 1540. They resisted Spanish invasion for many years but ultimately lost the Santiago Estate to the Spanish. One particularly famous rebel leader was √ëusta Willaq, a female warrior who fought the Spanish in 1780. With Argentinian independence in 1810, the situation of the Qulla people did not improve and they worked for minimal wages. On 31 August 1945, Qulla communities in the northwestern Argentine provinces of Jujuy and Salta, through a group of representatives, sent a note to the National Agrarian Council demanding the restitution of their lands, in compliance with previous laws. On 17 January 1946 President Edelmiro Juli√°n Farrell signed the expropriation decree. But as funds for the necessary land surveys and paperwork were in progress, the direction of the Council passed to other people, who blocked them. In 1946, Qulla people joined the Mal√≥n de la Paz, a march to the capital of Buenos Aires to demand the return of their lands. In the 1950s, Qulla people worked in the timber industry on their ancestral lands. In 1985, the Argentinian government officially recognized the indigenous peoples of that country by Law 23303. A cholera epidemic took a toll on the Qulla population in the late 20th century. In August 1996, many Qulla people occupied and blocked roads to their traditional lands but were violently stopped by the police. On 19 March 1997, the Qulla people finally regained legal possession of the Santiago Estate. Today In the Province of Salta, Northern Argentina, Qullamarka is the Coordinating Platform for five different Qulla organizations, including the Kolla Tinkunaku Community is a grassroots organization, which represents four Qulla communities. Two other organizations represent Qulla rights in Argentina: Centro Kolla in Buenos Aires and the Indianista de los Pueblos Kollas. Because they traditionally held their land in common, the Qulla do not have titles of ownership to their lands, which has resulted in displacement. However, the Qulla participate in Argentinian government and hold local elected positions in their region. The Additional Survey on Indigenous Populations, published by the National Institute for Statistics and Census, gives a total of 600,329 people out of some 40 million in Argentina who see themselves as descending from or belonging to an indigenous people. For a number of reasons the different indigenous organisations do not believe this to be a credible survey. Firstly, the methodology used in the survey was considered inadequate, as a large number of indigenous people live in urban areas, where the survey was not fully conducted. Second, many indigenous people in the country hide their identity for fear of discrimination. Moreover, when the survey was designed in 2001, it was based on the existence of 18 known peoples in the country, but now, there exist more than 31 groups. That increase reflects a growing awareness amongst indigenous people in terms of their ethnic belonging. As many Argentinians believe that the majority of the indigenous have died out or are on the verge of doing or that their descendants have assimilated into Western civilisation many years ago, they hold the idea that there are no indigenous people in their country. The use of pejorative terms likening the indigenous to lazy, idle, dirty, ignorant and savage are part of the everyday language in Argentina. Those stereotypes have forced many indigenous people, over the years, to hide their identity to avoid racial discrimination. Language The Qulla speak Northwest Jujuy Quechua or Qulla, a dialect of South Bolivian Quechua, which is a variety of Southern Quechua, one of the Quechuan languages. The Qulla of the northern Altiplano near Titicaca, however, appear to have originally spoken the Puquina language, also the likely main language of the Tiwanaku culture during the Middle Horizon period.

The combination of text and image enables patients to process their memories and emotions through two different, yet compatible mediums. Comic book therapy can also be used in a psychotherapeutic setting, whereby clients are encouraged to read specific comic books, often surrounding topics similar to their own diagnoses. Clients are encouraged to present their thoughts and feelings they experienced while reading as well as to draw parallels with their own lived experiences based on the events that occur within the books. This is done in an effort to reach a cathartic moment of clarity and understanding of one's own life. Both forms of therapy can be used throughout a patient's treatment process: immediately after diagnosis, throughout rehabilitation, and during the events that follow, including readjustment and general coping. Comic book therapy is currently being applied to a variety of populations, including patients diagnosed with life-altering diagnoses (i.e. cancer, Dementia, Parkinson's Disease, diabetes, etc.), patients and family members experiencing severe illness or death, families undergoing therapy, sexual assault survivors, and soldiers returning from war. One such therapy, originally conceptualized by Captain Russel Shilling, is currently being developed by The United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  Comic Book Therapy and Graphic Medicine  Graphic medicine, originally coined by Ian Williams, is a literary genre that combines the medium of comics and the discourse of medicine. Within the last ten years, graphic stories, which are also referred to as adult themed comics, have slowly become a rising pop- culture trend. It owes its success in part to the rise of medical humanities, an interdisciplinary study of medicine and healthcare related topics. While medical humanities incorporates a variety of language-based subjects (i.e. philosophy, ethics, religion, etc.), graphic medicine strives to analyze the same healthcare-related topics using an artistic lens. The genre combines the conventionality of text with the eccentricity of images to present intimate narratives related to healthcare or medical experiences. These narratives are also sometimes referred to as \\"graphic pathologies\\", as they commonly discuss diagnoses of injury, illness, or disease. Current professionals within the field are striving to develop a collection of novels that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and their loved ones, but that serve as an educational tool for medical students as well. The general concepts of graphic medicine and comic book therapy are often used interchangeably as they both strive to develop healthcare-related stories using both text and graphics. There is however a distinction that should be made. Graphic medicine acts as an umbrella term that encompasses a host of therapeutic techniques. Therefore, comic book therapy comfortably fits under its heading as just one of many therapies that the field of graphic medicine investigates.  History  The foundations of the comics industry began in the early 1920s just after the culmination of the First World War. Initially starting out as small black-and- white strips, comics predominantly acted as entertaining filler space within national and local magazines and newspapers around the country. It was not until 1929 with the publication of The Funnies #1 that the first collection of comics material came about. The years following witnessed a spurt of comics publication that lasted up until present day with children and adults alike still knowing names like Batman, Superman, Peanuts, and Calvin and Hobbes. Professionals within the graphic medicine field trace the history of comics back further than the early 1920s, however. Instead, they claim the origin of their academic field can be traced back to prehistoric cave drawings and man's desire to express himself with pictures. In this light, professors of graphic medicine and clinicians of comic book therapy include Egyptian hieroglyphics, Mayan and Aztecs drawings, and the great art of the Greeks, the Persians, and the Romans within the history of comic books as well. They do, of course, begin the story of comics specifically in 1938 with the publication of Action Comics #1, the first to detail the adventures and heroic efforts of Superman. The development of radio, television, and film only heightened the popularity of comic books and comic book characters; and by 1980, the merchandising of comic books hit an all time peak. Today, comic books have slowly begun to matriculate within select topics of academia, now regarded as significant contributions to literary expression, covering topics of medicine, politics, economy, and social change.  Current Uses in Today's Medical Setting  Since its beginning, graphic medicine as a field of study has steadily become more relevant. As such, the use of comic book therapy as well as its functions have expanded as well. Today, comic books and graphic novels alike are being implemented in a variety of clinical and educational settings, likely due to its efforts in serving a variety of needs for a diverse target audience. Comic book therapies can serve multiple purposes. Some authors hope to relay information, creating a graphic encyclopedia of sorts. Therapists often collaborate with patients in comic book therapy to develop a closer relationship based on the tenants of empathy and understanding. Patients, more often than not, are encouraged to process difficult emotions and memories in the attempt to process, readjust, and engage in healthier coping strategies. Because of its multiple functions, graphic medicine and comic book therapy have been implemented both therapeutically and educationally in the medical field.  Therapeutic Tool  Creating a comic book = One form of comic book therapy involves the creation of a comic strip, a comic book, or a graphic novel. The process by which a patient, family member, caregiver, or practitioner creates a comic book is complex and involves extensive research. In essence, the process of developing a comic book serves as a therapeutic coping mechanism that goes beyond text-based storytelling. Instead, patients are pushed to think through multiple media. The process can sometimes, hopefully frequently, lead to significant cognitive and emotion breakthroughs. These effects are likely due to the sheer versatility of the comic book medium, as they allow for the simultaneous expression of body image, verbal expression, physical action, and emotion. Therapists often encourage patients to develop characters first, as this first step situates the patient in relation to their environment, past and present. Most often, the characters of comic book therapy novels imitate those within the author's own life, developing an autobiography of sorts. Occasionally, their experiences are identical to those of reality; often, an author chooses to reshape the narrative altogether, providing the reader an augmented reality of some kind. Patients take this opportunity to rewrite their story, making choices they didn't or couldn't during their own experiences. The comic book aspect acts as a safe avenue of release, in which a patient can comfortably create a world in which the consequences of actions are limited to panels in which they develop. = Reading a comic book = Another form of comic book therapy encourages patients, their support systems, and their healthcare providers to read already published graphic novels and comic books. As the field of graphic medicine has grown, so too have the collection of comic books and novels. As such, current graphic novels and comic books cover a wide range of topics, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, eating disorders, and so on. Popular novels include Cancer Vixen: a True Story by Marisa Acocella Marchetto, Tangles: A Story About Alzheimer's, My Mother, and Me by Sarah Leavitt, and Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo and Me by Ellen Forney. Therapists recommend novels that discuss similar experiences, similar diagnoses, similar personal histories to those of their own patients. Patients are encouraged to read them critically in the efforts of finding some kind of parallel between their own experiences and those described within the panels. This method of therapy goes beyond just reading a recommended autobiography. The images and graphics within each panel add to the narrative, bridging a gap between words and meaning. The way in which an author chooses to depict their characters, the environment, and the text are all important and contribute largely the reading experience.  Educational Tool  Current professionals within the field are striving to develop a field of study that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and healthcare providers alike, but that can serve as an educational tool for medical students as well. With the advancement of technology and the diversification of the patient population, medical practices has undergone significant change within the last century. On the other hand, the education process prior to medical practice has remained arguably stagnant. Present day medical school programs cover material in three broad categories, including the scientific basis of medicine, patient care, and physicianship. The methods of teaching vary across universities, but the basic curricula remain the same across the board. With the evolution of medical practice arriving so quickly, some argue that medical training should follow in suit. According to the scholars of Graphic Medicine, there are multiple parallels between comic book therapy, when used as educational tool, and the everyday practice of medicine. In this way, having medical students engage in comic book therapy during their medical training could prove significant later on. The hustle and bustle of medical practice can prove stressful, especially for a new doctor fresh out of medical school. In order to prove oneself within the medical field, many believe an individual must possess characteristics like 'competency', 'professionalism', and 'brilliance'; rarely are physicians referred to as 'artistically creative' or 'creative' at all. One professor of graphic medicine believes this could be a problem in the future as it pushes medical students to stay within the limitations of an unoriginal box.

It is common on the north eastern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. Polychaetes, or marine bristle worms, have elongated bodies divided into many segments. Each segment may bear setae (bristles) and parapodia (paddle-like appendages). Some species live freely, either swimming, crawling or burrowing, and these are known as \\"errant\\". Others live permanently in tubes, either calcareous or parchment-like, and these are known as \\"sedentary\\". Distribution This species is found in the Arctic, eastern North Atlantic, the Mediterranean, Adriatic, Black and Red Sea, the English Channel, the North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat the Little and Great Belts and √òresund north east to the Bay of Kiel. Description Pomatoceros triqueter secretes a white calcareous tube about three millimetres wide and up to twenty five millimetres long. It is smooth and usually curved with a single ridge in the middle that ends in a projection over the anterior opening. The operculum has a shallow, dish-shaped plug. The body of the worm is brightly coloured and the crown of radioles is banded with various colours. The body and crown can be withdrawn into the protective tube.Marine Life Information Network It is closely related to, and often confused with, Pomatoceros lamarckii. Biology Pomatoceros triqueter never leaves its tube. The action of cilia creates currents which circulate down the length of the tube. Respiration occurs when dissolved oxygen enters through the surface of the body and through the extended branchial crown. This tube worm is a filter feeder and cilia on the branchial filaments waft particles towards the central mouth. The particles are not sorted and any that are too large are removed from the mouth opening by the tip of a filament. There is a complete digestive system and like other polychaetes, P. triqueter excretes with the help of fully developed nephridia. Pomatoceros triqueter males release spermatogonia or primary spermatocytes into the sea and females release primary oocytes. The larvae form part of the zooplankton for two to three weeks in the summer when the majority of the breeding takes place, but for up to two months in the winter. The larvae then settle on the substrate and build a temporary delicate, semi- transparent tube formed of mucus and calcareous matter.Segrove, F., 1941. The development of the serpulid Pomatoceros triqueter, Quart. J. micr. Sci., Vol. 82, pp. 467-540. This is later hardened by a secretion of calcium carbonate from the collar and grows at the rate of 1.5 millimetres per month. Although it may superficially give the appearance of being formed in bands, this is caused by spurts in growth interspersed with quiescent periods.Tube formation by Pomatoceros triqueter (Polychaeta) References Category:Polychaetes Category:Animals described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Pomatoceros triqueter"},{"id":"31631835","text":"Alpinia conchigera, the lesser alpinia, is a plant species in the genus Alpinia.

This is expressed as being greater than 1 g. Hypergravity conditions are created on Earth for research on human physiology in aerial combat and space flight, as well as testing of materials and equipment for space missions. Manufacturing of titanium aluminide turbine blades in 20 g is being explored by researchers at the European Space Agency (ESA) via an 8-meter wide Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC). Hypergravity as training Researchers calculated from a weight loss experiment that using ankle weights and wrist weights would have a 14% improved NEAT calorie burn while doing household chores. Track and basketball (primarily plyometric) metrics improved by 8‚Äì25% mostly depending upon if the subjects used weighted vests all day or only when training, but the effect disappeared after a month of not using hyper-gravity training. Bacteria NASA scientists looking at meteorite impacts discovered that most strains of bacteria were able to reproduce under pressures exceeding 7,500 g.http://www.universetoday.com/89416/hypergravity/ Recent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria including Escherichia coli and Paracoccus denitrificans being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an ultracentrifuge at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 g. Another study that has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reports that some bacteria can exist even in extreme \\"hypergravity\\". In other words, they can still live and breed despite gravitational forces that are 400,000 times greater than what's felt here on Earth. Paracoccus denitrificans was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of supernovas. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful growth under hypergravity. The research has implications on the feasibility of existence of exobacteria and panspermia. A concern of this practice is rapid spinning. If someone moves their head too quickly while they're inside a fast-moving centrifuge, they might feel uncomfortably like they're tumbling head over heels. This can happen when balance-sensing fluids in the semicircular canals of the inner ear become \\"confused\\". Some experiments using centrifuges often include devices that fix the subjects' heads in place to prevent that illusion. Traveling through space, however, with one's head fixed in place is not practical. Effects on the synthesis of materials High gravity conditions generated by centrifuge is applied in the chemical industry, casting, and material synthesis. The convection and mass transfer are greatly affected by the gravitational condition. Researchers reported that the high-gravity level can effectively affect the phase composition and morphology of the products. Effects on rate of aging of rats Ever since Pearl proposed the rate of living theory of aging, numerous studies have demonstrated its validity in poikilotherms. In mammals, however, satisfactory experimental demonstration is still lacking because an externally imposed increase of basal metabolic rate of these animals (e.g. by placement in the cold) is usually accompanied by general homeostatic disturbance and stress. The present study was based on the finding that rats exposed to slightly increased gravity are able to adapt with little chronic stress but at a higher level of basal metabolic expenditure (increased 'rate of living'). The rate of aging of 17-month-old rats that had been exposed to 3.14 g in an animal centrifuge for 8 months was larger than of controls as shown by apparently elevated lipofuscin content in heart and kidney, reduced numbers and increased size of mitochondria of heart tissue, and inferior liver mitochondria respiration (reduced 'efficiency': 20% larger ADP: 0 ratio, P less than 0.01; reduced 'speed': 8% lower respiratory control ratio, P less than 0.05). Steady-state food intake per day per kg body weight, which is presumably proportional to 'rate of living' or specific basal metabolic expenditure, was about 18% higher than in controls (P less than 0.01) after an initial 2-month adaptation period. Finally, though half of the centrifuged animals lived only a little shorter than controls (average about 343 vs. 364 days on the centrifuge, difference statistically nonsignificant), the remaining half (longest survivors) lived on the centrifuge an average of 520 days (range 483‚Äì572) compared to an average of 574 days (range 502‚Äì615) for controls, computed from onset of centrifugation, or 11% shorter (P less than 0.01). Therefore, these results show that a moderate increase of the level of basal metabolism of young adult rats adapted to hypergravity compared to controls in normal gravity is accompanied by a roughly similar increase in the rate of organ aging and reduction of survival, in agreement with Pearl's rate of living theory of aging, previously experimentally demonstrated only in poikilotherms. Effects on the behavior of adult rats Pups from gestating rats exposed to hypergravity (1.8 g) or to normal gravity at the perinatal period were evaluated. By comparison to controls, the hypergravity group had shorter latencies before choosing a maze arm in a T-maze and fewer exploratory pokes in a hole board. During dyadic encounters, the hypergravity group had a lower number of self-grooming episodes and shorter latencies before crossing under the opposing rat.

The meaning of [a]p\\\\,! is that after performing action a\\\\,! it is necessarily the case that p\\\\,! holds, that is, a\\\\,! must bring about p\\\\,!. The meaning of \\\\langle a \\\\rangle p\\\\,! is that after performing a\\\\,! it is possible that p\\\\,! holds, that is, a\\\\,! might bring about p\\\\,!. These operators are related by [a]p \\\\equiv eg \\\\langle a \\\\rangle eg p\\\\,! and \\\\langle a \\\\rangle p \\\\equiv eg[a] eg p\\\\,!, analogously to the relationship between the universal (\\\\forall\\\\,!) and existential (\\\\exists\\\\,!) quantifiers. Dynamic logic permits compound actions built up from smaller actions. While the basic control operators of any programming language could be used for this purpose, Kleene's regular expression operators are a good match to modal logic. Given actions a\\\\,! and b\\\\,!, the compound action a \\\\cup b\\\\,!, choice, also written a+b\\\\,! or ab\\\\,!, is performed by performing one of a\\\\,! or b\\\\,!. The compound action a\\\\mathbin{;}b\\\\,!, sequence, is performed by performing first a\\\\,! and then b\\\\,!. The compound action a{*}\\\\,!, iteration, is performed by performing a\\\\,! zero or more times, sequentially. The constant action 0\\\\,! or BLOCK does nothing and does not terminate, whereas the constant action 1\\\\,! or SKIP or NOP, definable as 0{*}\\\\,!, does nothing but does terminate. Axioms These operators can be axiomatized in dynamic logic as follows, taking as already given a suitable axiomatization of modal logic including such axioms for modal operators as the above-mentioned axiom [a]p \\\\equiv eg \\\\langle a \\\\rangle eg p\\\\,! and the two inference rules modus ponens (\\\\vdash p and \\\\vdash p \\\\to q implies \\\\vdash q\\\\,) and necessitation (\\\\vdash p implies \\\\vdash [a]p\\\\,). A1. [0]p\\\\,! A2. [1]p \\\\equiv p\\\\,! A3. [a \\\\cup b]p \\\\equiv [a]p \\\\land [b]p\\\\,! A4. [a\\\\mathbin{;}b]p \\\\equiv [a][b]p\\\\,! A5. [a*]p \\\\equiv p \\\\land [a][a*]p\\\\,! A6. p \\\\land [a*](p \\\\to [a]p) \\\\to [a*]p\\\\,! Axiom A1 makes the empty promise that when BLOCK terminates, p\\\\,! will hold, even if p\\\\,! is the proposition false. (Thus BLOCK abstracts the essence of the action of hell freezing over.) A2 says that NOP acts as the identity function on propositions, that is, it transforms p\\\\,! into itself. A3 says that if doing one of a\\\\,! or b\\\\,! must bring about p\\\\,!, then a\\\\,! must bring about p\\\\,! and likewise for b\\\\,!, and conversely. A4 says that if doing a\\\\,! and then b\\\\,! must bring about p\\\\,!, then a\\\\,! must bring about a situation in which b\\\\,! must bring about p\\\\,!. A5 is the evident result of applying A2, A3 and A4 to the equation a{*} = 1 \\\\cup a\\\\mathbin{;}a{*}\\\\,! of Kleene algebra. A6 asserts that if p\\\\,! holds now, and no matter how often we perform a\\\\,! it remains the case that the truth of p\\\\,! after that performance entails its truth after one more performance of a\\\\,!, then p\\\\,! must remain true no matter how often we perform a\\\\,!. A6 is recognizable as mathematical induction with the action n := n+1 of incrementing n generalized to arbitrary actions a\\\\,!. Derivations The modal logic axiom [a]p \\\\equiv eg\\\\langle a \\\\rangle eg p\\\\,! permits the derivation of the following six theorems corresponding to the above: T1. eg \\\\langle 0 \\\\rangle p\\\\,! T2. \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle p \\\\equiv p\\\\,! T3. \\\\langle a \\\\cup b \\\\rangle p \\\\equiv \\\\langle a \\\\rangle p \\\\lor \\\\langle b \\\\rangle p\\\\,! T4. \\\\langle a;b \\\\rangle p \\\\equiv \\\\langle a \\\\rangle \\\\langle b \\\\rangle p\\\\,! T5. \\\\langle a* \\\\rangle p \\\\equiv p \\\\lor \\\\langle a \\\\rangle \\\\langle a* \\\\rangle p\\\\,! T6. \\\\langle a* \\\\rangle p \\\\to p \\\\lor \\\\langle a* \\\\rangle ( eg p \\\\land \\\\langle a \\\\rangle p)\\\\,! T1 asserts the impossibility of bringing anything about by performing BLOCK. T2 notes again that NOP changes nothing, bearing in mind that NOP is both deterministic and terminating whence [1]\\\\,! and \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle\\\\,! have the same force. T3 says that if the choice of a\\\\,! or b\\\\,! could bring about p\\\\,!, then either a\\\\,! or b\\\\,! alone could bring about p\\\\,!. T4 is just like A4. T5 is explained as for A5. T6 asserts that if it is possible to bring about p\\\\,! by performing a\\\\,! sufficiently often, then either p\\\\,! is true now or it is possible to perform a\\\\,! repeatedly to bring about a situation where p\\\\,! is (still) false but one more performance of a\\\\,! could bring about p\\\\,!. Box and diamond are entirely symmetric with regard to which one takes as primitive. An alternative axiomatization would have been to take the theorems T1-T6 as axioms, from which we could then have derived A1-A6 as theorems. The difference between implication and inference is the same in dynamic logic as in any other logic: whereas the implication p \\\\to q\\\\,! asserts that if p\\\\,! is true then so is q\\\\,!, the inference p \\\\vdash q\\\\,! asserts that if p\\\\,! is valid then so is q\\\\,!. However the dynamic nature of dynamic logic moves this distinction out of the realm of abstract axiomatics into the common-sense experience of situations in flux. The inference rule p \\\\vdash [a]p\\\\,!, for example, is sound because its premise asserts that p\\\\,! holds at all times, whence no matter where a\\\\,! might take us, p\\\\,! will be true there. The implication p \\\\to [a]p\\\\,! is not valid, however, because the truth of p\\\\,! at the present moment is no guarantee of its truth after performing a\\\\,!. For example, p \\\\to [a]p\\\\,! will be true in any situation where p\\\\,! is false, or in any situation where [a]p\\\\,! is true, but the assertion (x = 1) \\\\to [x := x+1](x = 1)\\\\,! is false in any situation where x\\\\,! has value 1, and therefore is not valid. Derived rules of inference As for modal logic, the inference rules modus ponens and necessitation suffice also for dynamic logic as the only primitive rules it needs, as noted above. However, as usual in logic, many more rules can be derived from these with the help of the axioms. An example instance of such a derived rule in dynamic logic is that if kicking a broken TV once can't possibly fix it, then repeatedly kicking it can't possibly fix it either. Writing k\\\\,! for the action of kicking the TV, and b\\\\,! for the proposition that the TV is broken, dynamic logic expresses this inference as b \\\\to [k]b \\\\vdash b \\\\to [k*]b\\\\,!, having as premise b \\\\to [k]b\\\\,! and as conclusion b \\\\to [k*]b\\\\,!. The meaning of [k]b\\\\,! is that it is guaranteed that after kicking the TV, it is broken. Hence the premise b \\\\to [k]b\\\\,! means that if the TV is broken, then after kicking it once it will still be broken. k{*}\\\\,! denotes the action of kicking the TV zero or more times. Hence the conclusion b \\\\to [k*]b\\\\,! means that if the TV is broken, then after kicking it zero or more times it will still be broken. For if not, then after the second-to-last kick the TV would be in a state where kicking it once more would fix it, which the premise claims can never happen under any circumstances. The inference b \\\\to [k]b \\\\vdash b \\\\to [k*]b\\\\,! is sound. However the implication (b \\\\to [k]b) \\\\to (b \\\\to [k*]b)\\\\,! is not valid because we can easily find situations in which b \\\\to [k]b\\\\,! holds but b \\\\to [k*]b\\\\,! does not. In any such counterexample situation, b\\\\,! must hold but [k*]b\\\\,! must be false, while [k]b\\\\,! however must be true. But this could happen in any situation where the TV is broken but can be revived with two kicks. The implication fails (is not valid) because it only requires that b \\\\to [k]b\\\\,! hold now, whereas the inference succeeds (is sound) because it requires that b \\\\to [k]b\\\\,! hold in all situations, not just the present one. An example of a valid implication is the proposition (x \\\\ge 3) \\\\to [x := x+1](x \\\\ge 4)\\\\,!. This says that if x\\\\,! is greater or equal to 3, then after incrementing x\\\\,!, x\\\\,! must be greater or equal to 4. In the case of deterministic actions a\\\\,! that are guaranteed to terminate, such as x := x+1\\\\,!, must and might have the same force, that is, [a]\\\\,! and \\\\langle a \\\\rangle\\\\,! have the same meaning. Hence the above proposition is equivalent to (x \\\\ge 3) \\\\to \\\\langle x := x+1 \\\\rangle (x \\\\ge 4)\\\\,! asserting that if x\\\\,! is greater or equal to 3 then after performing x := x+1\\\\,!, x\\\\,! might be greater or equal to 4. Assignment The general form of an assignment statement is x := e\\\\,! where x\\\\,! is a variable and e\\\\,! is an expression built from constants and variables with whatever operations are provided by the language, such as addition and multiplication. The Hoare axiom for assignment is not given as a single axiom but rather as an axiom schema. A7. [x:=e] \\\\Phi(x) \\\\equiv \\\\Phi(e)\\\\,! This is a schema in the sense that \\\\Phi(x)\\\\,! can be instantiated with any formula \\\\Phi\\\\,! containing zero or more instances of a variable x\\\\,!. The meaning of \\\\Phi(e)\\\\,! is \\\\Phi\\\\,! with those occurrences of x\\\\,! that occur free in \\\\Phi\\\\,!, i.e. not bound by some quantifier as in \\\\forall x\\\\,!, replaced by e\\\\,!. For example, we may instantiate A7 with [x:=e](x=y^2) \\\\equiv e=y^2\\\\,!, or with [x:=e](b=c+x) \\\\equiv b=c+e\\\\,!. Such an axiom schema allows infinitely many axioms having a common form to be written as a finite expression connoting that form. The instance [x:=x+1](x \\\\ge 4) \\\\equiv (x+1) \\\\ge 4\\\\,! of A7 allows us to calculate mechanically that the example [x:=x+1]x \\\\ge 4\\\\,! encountered a few paragraphs ago is equivalent to (x+1) \\\\ge 4\\\\,!, which in turn is equivalent to x \\\\ge 3\\\\,! by elementary algebra. An example illustrating assignment in combination with *\\\\,! is the proposition \\\\langle (x:=x+1)*\\\\rangle x=7\\\\,!. This asserts that it is possible, by incrementing x\\\\,! sufficiently often, to make x\\\\,! equal to 7. This of course is not always true, e.g. if x\\\\,! is 8 to begin with, or 6.5, whence this proposition is not a theorem of dynamic logic. If x\\\\,! is of type integer however, then this proposition is true if and only if x\\\\,! is at most 7 to begin with, that is, it is just a roundabout way of saying x \\\\le 7\\\\,!. Mathematical induction can be obtained as the instance of A6 in which the proposition p\\\\,! is instantiated as \\\\Phi(n)\\\\,!, the action a\\\\,! as n:=n+1\\\\,!, and n\\\\,! as 0\\\\,!. The first two of these three instantiations are straightforward, converting A6 to (\\\\Phi(n) \\\\land [(n:=n+1)*](\\\\Phi(n) \\\\to [n:=n+1] \\\\Phi(n))) \\\\to [(n:=n+1)*] \\\\Phi(n)\\\\,!. However, the ostensibly simple substitution of 0\\\\,! for n\\\\,! is not so simple as it brings out the so-called referential opacity of modal logic in the case when a modality can interfere with a substitution. When we substituted \\\\Phi(n)\\\\,! for p\\\\,!, we were thinking of the proposition symbol p\\\\,! as a rigid designator with respect to the modality [n:=n+1]\\\\,!, meaning that it is the same proposition after incrementing n\\\\,! as before, even though incrementing n\\\\,! may impact its truth. Likewise, the action a\\\\,! is still the same action after incrementing n\\\\,!, even though incrementing n\\\\,! will result in its executing in a different environment. However, n\\\\,! itself is not a rigid designator with respect to the modality [n:=n+1]\\\\,!; if it denotes 3 before incrementing n\\\\,!, it denotes 4 after. So we can't just substitute 0\\\\,! for n\\\\,! everywhere in A6. One way of dealing with the opacity of modalities is to eliminate them. To this end, expand [(n:=n+1)*] \\\\Phi(n)\\\\,! as the infinite conjunction [(n:=n+1)^0] \\\\Phi(n) \\\\land [(n:=n+1)^1] \\\\Phi(n) \\\\land [(n:=n+1)^2] \\\\Phi(n) \\\\land \\\\ldots\\\\,!, that is, the conjunction over all i\\\\,! of [(n:=n+1)^i] \\\\Phi(n)\\\\,!. Now apply A4 to turn [(n:=n+1)^i] \\\\Phi(n)\\\\,! into [n:=n+1][n:=n+1]\\\\ldots \\\\Phi(n)\\\\,!, having i\\\\,! modalities. Then apply Hoare's axiom i\\\\,! times to this to produce \\\\Phi(n+i)\\\\,!, then simplify this infinite conjunction to \\\\forall i \\\\Phi(n+i)\\\\,!. This whole reduction should be applied to both instances of [(n:=n+1)*]\\\\,! in A6, yielding (\\\\Phi(n) \\\\land \\\\forall i (\\\\Phi(n+i) \\\\to [n:=n+1] \\\\Phi(n+i))) \\\\to \\\\forall i \\\\Phi(n+i)\\\\,!. The remaining modality can now be eliminated with one more use of Hoare's axiom to give (\\\\Phi(n) \\\\land \\\\forall i (\\\\Phi(n+i) \\\\to \\\\Phi(n+i+1))) \\\\to \\\\forall i \\\\Phi (n+i)\\\\,!. With the opaque modalities now out of the way, we can safely substitute 0\\\\,! for n\\\\,! in the usual manner of first-order logic to obtain Peano's celebrated axiom (\\\\Phi(0) \\\\land \\\\forall i (\\\\Phi(i) \\\\to \\\\Phi(i+1))) \\\\to \\\\forall i \\\\Phi(i)\\\\,!, namely mathematical induction. One subtlety we glossed over here is that \\\\forall i\\\\,! should be understood as ranging over the natural numbers, where i\\\\,! is the superscript in the expansion of a{*}\\\\,! as the union of a^i\\\\,! over all natural numbers i\\\\,!. The importance of keeping this typing information straight becomes apparent if n\\\\,! had been of type integer, or even real, for any of which A6 is perfectly valid as an axiom. As a case in point, if n\\\\,! is a real variable and \\\\Phi(n)\\\\,! is the predicate n\\\\,! is a natural number, then axiom A6 after the first two substitutions, that is, (\\\\Phi(n) \\\\land \\\\forall i (\\\\Phi(n+i) \\\\to \\\\Phi(n+i+1))) \\\\to \\\\forall i \\\\Phi(n+i)\\\\,!, is just as valid, that is, true in every state regardless of the value of n\\\\,! in that state, as when n\\\\,! is of type natural number. If in a given state n\\\\,! is a natural number, then the antecedent of the main implication of A6 holds, but then n+i\\\\,! is also a natural number so the consequent also holds. If n\\\\,! is not a natural number, then the antecedent is false and so A6 remains true regardless of the truth of the consequent. We could strengthen A6 to an equivalence p \\\\land [a*](p \\\\to [a]p) \\\\equiv [a*]p\\\\,! without impacting any of this, the other direction being provable from A5, from which we see that if the antecedent of A6 does happen to be false somewhere, then the consequent must be false. Test Dynamic logic associates to every proposition p\\\\,! an action p?\\\\,! called a test. When p\\\\,! holds, the test p?\\\\,! acts as a NOP, changing nothing while allowing the action to move on. When p\\\\,! is false, p?\\\\,! acts as BLOCK. Tests can be axiomatized as follows. A8. [p?]q \\\\equiv p \\\\to q\\\\,! The corresponding theorem for \\\\langle p? \\\\rangle\\\\,! is: T8. \\\\langle p? \\\\rangle q \\\\equiv p \\\\land q\\\\,! The construct if p then a else b is realized in dynamic logic as (p?;a) \\\\cup ( eg p?;b)\\\\,!. This action expresses a guarded choice: if p\\\\,! holds then p?;a\\\\,! is equivalent to a\\\\,!, whereas eg p?;b\\\\,! is equivalent to BLOCK, and a \\\\cup 0\\\\,! is equivalent to a\\\\,!. Hence when p\\\\,! is true the performer of the action can only take the left branch, and when p\\\\,! is false the right. The construct while p do a is realized as (p?;a)*; eg p?\\\\,!. This performs p?;a\\\\,! zero or more times and then performs eg p?\\\\,!. As long as p\\\\,! remains true, the eg p?\\\\,! at the end blocks the performer from terminating the iteration prematurely, but as soon as it becomes false, further iterations of the body p\\\\,! are blocked and the performer then has no choice but to exit via the test eg p?\\\\,!. Quantification as random assignment The random-assignment statement x:=?\\\\,! denotes the nondeterministic action of setting x\\\\,! to an arbitrary value. [x:=?]p\\\\,! then says that p\\\\,! holds no matter what you set x\\\\,! to, while \\\\langle x:=? \\\\rangle p\\\\,! says that it is possible to set x\\\\,! to a value that makes p\\\\,! true. [x:=?]\\\\,! thus has the same meaning as the universal quantifier \\\\forall x\\\\,!, while \\\\langle x:=? \\\\rangle\\\\,! similarly corresponds to the existential quantifier \\\\exists x\\\\,!. That is, first-order logic can be understood as the dynamic logic of programs of the form x:=?\\\\,!. Dijkstra claimed to show the impossibility of a program that sets the value of variable x to an arbitrary positive integer. However, in dynamic logic with assignment and the * operator, x can be set to an arbitrary positive integer with the dynamic logic program x:=0\\\\mathbin{;} (x:= x+ 1){*}: hence we must either reject Dijkstra's argument or hold that the * operator is not effective. Possible-world semantics Modal logic is most commonly interpreted in terms of possible world semantics or Kripke structures. This semantics carries over naturally to dynamic logic by interpreting worlds as states of a computer in the application to program verification, or states of our environment in applications to linguistics, AI, etc. One role for possible world semantics is to formalize the intuitive notions of truth and validity, which in turn permit the notions of soundness and completeness to be defined for axiom systems. An inference rule is sound when validity of its premises implies validity of its conclusion. An axiom system is sound when all its axioms are valid and its inference rules are sound. An axiom system is complete when every valid formula is derivable as a theorem of that system. These concepts apply to all systems of logic including dynamic logic. Propositional dynamic logic (PDL) Ordinary or first-order logic has two types of terms, respectively assertions and data. As can be seen from the examples above, dynamic logic adds a third type of term denoting actions. The dynamic logic assertion [x:=x+1](x \\\\ge 4)\\\\,! contains all three types: x\\\\,!, x+1\\\\,!, and 4\\\\,! are data, x:=x+1\\\\,! is an action, and x \\\\ge 4\\\\,! and [x:=x+1](x \\\\ge 4)\\\\,! are assertions. Propositional logic is derived from first-order logic by omitting data terms and reasons only about abstract propositions, which may be simple propositional variables or atoms or compound propositions built with such logical connectives as and, or, and not. Propositional dynamic logic, or PDL, was derived from dynamic logic in 1977 by Michael J. Fischer and Richard Ladner. PDL blends the ideas behind propositional logic and dynamic logic by adding actions while omitting data; hence the terms of PDL are actions and propositions. The TV example above is expressed in PDL whereas the next example involving x:=x+1\\\\,! is in first- order DL. PDL is to (first-order) dynamic logic as propositional logic is to first-order logic. Fischer and Ladner showed in their 1977 paper that PDL satisfiability was of computational complexity at most nondeterministic exponential time, and at least deterministic exponential time in the worst case. This gap was closed in 1978 by Vaughan Pratt who showed that PDL was decidable in deterministic exponential time. In 1977, Krister Segerberg proposed a complete axiomatization of PDL, namely any complete axiomatization of modal logic K together with axioms A1-A6 as given above. Completeness proofs for Segerberg's axioms were found by Gabbay (unpublished note), Parikh (1978), Pratt (1979), and Kozen and Parikh (1981). History Dynamic logic was developed by Vaughan Pratt in 1974 in notes for a class on program verification as an approach to assigning meaning to Hoare logic by expressing the Hoare formula p { a } q\\\\,! as p \\\\to [a]q\\\\,!. The approach was later published in 1976 as a logical system in its own right. The system parallels Andrzej Salwicki's system of algorithmic logic and Edsger Dijkstra's notion of weakest-precondition predicate transformer \\\\operatorname{wp}(a,p)\\\\,!, with [a]p\\\\,! corresponding to Dijkstra's \\\\operatorname{wlp}(a,p)\\\\,!, weakest liberal precondition. Those logics however made no connection with either modal logic, Kripke semantics, regular expressions, or the calculus of binary relations; dynamic logic therefore can be viewed as a refinement of algorithmic logic and predicate transformers that connects them up to the axiomatics and Kripke semantics of modal logic as well as to the calculi of binary relations and regular expressions. The concurrency challenge Hoare logic, algorithmic logic, weakest preconditions, and dynamic logic are all well suited to discourse and reasoning about sequential behavior. Extending these logics to concurrent behavior however has proved problematic. There are various approaches but all of them lack the elegance of the sequential case. In contrast Amir Pnueli's 1977 system of temporal logic, another variant of modal logic sharing many common features with dynamic logic, differs from all of the above-mentioned logics by being what Pnueli has characterized as an \\"endogenous\\" logic, the others being \\"exogenous\\" logics. By this Pnueli meant that temporal logic assertions are interpreted within a universal behavioral framework in which a single global situation changes with the passage of time, whereas the assertions of the other logics are made externally to the multiple actions about which they speak. The advantage of the endogenous approach is that it makes no fundamental assumptions about what causes what as the environment changes with time. Instead a temporal logic formula can talk about two unrelated parts of a system, which because they are unrelated tacitly evolve in parallel. In effect ordinary logical conjunction of temporal assertions is the concurrent composition operator of temporal logic. The simplicity of this approach to concurrency has resulted in temporal logic being the modal logic of choice for reasoning about concurrent systems with its aspects of synchronization, interference, independence, deadlock, livelock, fairness, etc. These concerns of concurrency would appear to be less central to linguistics, philosophy, and artificial intelligence, the areas in which dynamic logic is most often encountered nowadays.

In April 2007 he made an unsuccessful bid to be elected governor of Ogun State. He ran for governor again in 2011, and this time was elected on the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) platform. He ran for office for a second term under the All Progressives Congress in 2015 and was re-elected and sworn into office May 29, 2015. Background Amosun was born on 25 January, 1958 to a Muslim family. He attended primary school at African Church Primary school in Abeokuta (1965‚Äì1970), and then African Church Grammar school, Abeokuta (1971 ‚Äì 1977). He then went to Ogun State Polytechnic, graduating with a Higher National Diploma (HND) in 1983. Amosun gained an Associate membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) in 1990. He became a fellow of the Institute in 1996. He also became an Associate member of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (1998). Amosun began his career as an audit trainee with Lanre Aremu & Co. (Chartered Accountants) 1984. Later he joined XtraEdge Consulting as a managing consultant. From 1990, he was Principal partner of Ibikunle Amosun & Co. (Chartered Accountants) in Lagos. Amosun went to the University of Westminster in London, United Kingdom, where he acquired a Master of Arts in International Finance in 2000. Political career In April 2003, Ibikunle Amosun was elected to the senatorial seat of Ogun Central Senatorial district. He was an unsuccessful candidate to become Governor of Ogun State in April 2007, running on the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP) platform, but was defeated by Gbenga Daniel. He disputed the result, but in August 2009 the Ogun State Election Petitions Tribunal dismissed the petition. Amosun was the candidate of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) for April 2011 Ogun State gubernatorial election. A report in the Nigerian Tribune on 12 February, 2011 quoted his media aide as saying he had switched to the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), but this was denied by ACN officials. Amosun won the 26 April election running on the ACN platform with 377,489 votes. Adetunji Olurin of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) polled 188,698 votes and Gboyega Isiaka of the PPN came third with 137,051 votes. In 2015, Amosun stood for a second term as governor. He chose, Yetunde Onanuga, as his running mate of the state governor. He had to find a new running mate as his previous deputy governor had defected to an opposition party. Amosun chose Onanuga who had been working in the Lagos State Ministry of Environment over three other possible candidates.How Amosun‚Äôs running mate emerged, 19 December 2014, VanguardNGR, Retrieved 17 February 2016 On the 29th of May, 2019, Amosun handed over to his successor, Dapo Abiodun after completing the constitutional maximum two terms of eight years as a governor. However he was elected as the senator for the Ogun central senatorial district at the National Assembly. Controversy On June 24, 2019 Premium Times reported in an exclusive story that Ibikunle Amosun illegally purchased and imported four million rounds of ammunition, 1,000 units of AK47 assault rifles, 1,000 units of bulletproof vests and an armoured personnel carrier (APC) into Nigeria as the Governor of Ogun State without obtaining necessary approvals from the Office of the National Security Adviser and in violation of the Nigeria Firearms Act. The report generated a strong reaction from Nigerians with civil society organisations, citizens across the country and Ogun State chapter of his political party calling for his immediate arrest. In a reaction to the report, Ibikunle Amosun stated that he got necessary approval for the arms and ammunitions he imported as well as the end-user certificate from the office of the National Security Adviser, stating that it is a common practice by Governors in Nigeria to have an armoury In a swift response, twenty State Governors in Nigeria denied having an armoury in the Government Office or House In a reaction to the claim of Ibikunle Amosun, the Nigerian Government via the Budget Office of the Federation stated that Amosun only got approval for the importation of Armoured Personnel Carrier and not that of AK-47 rifles and ammunitions.. In another exclusive report by Premium Times showing documents from the offices of National Security Adviser, the Nigeria Customs Service, Federal Ministry of Finance and Ogun State Government, Premium Times reported that Ibikunle Amosun did not get approval for the ammunitions and weapons he brought into Nigeria. Awards and honours His leadership qualities and outstanding achievements have earned him recognition nationally and internationally, some of these include: # In October 2012, he was awarded as the Best Security Conscious State Governor in West Africa by Security Watch Africa in Accra, Ghana.

Life John Nickolls was born in Ware, Hertfordshire, in 1710 or 1711, the son of John Nickolls, a Quaker miller. He was apprenticed to Joseph Wyeth, merchant in London, and, after serving his time, became a partner with his father. Nickolls was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 17 January 1740 and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1744. Collector Nickolls built up an extensive library at his house in Trinity parish, Queenhithe. He also collected from the bookstalls about Moorfields two thousand prints of heads; these later furnished Joseph Ames with material for his Catalogue of English Heads, London, 1748. From Wyeth's widow Nickolls received a number of letters at one time in John Milton's possession; they had since belonged to Milton's secretary, Thomas Ellwood, and had been used by Wyeth in the preparation for publication of Ellwood's Journal, which was issued in 1713.Among them were letters from Sir Harry Vane, Colonels Overton, Harrison, and Venables, John Bradshaw, Andrew Marvell, and others, with numerous addresses from Nonconformist ministers in Norfolk, Suffolk, Bedfordshire, Herefordshire, Kent, Dublin, and elsewhere. William Oldys visited Nickolls at Queenhithe on 22 December 1737, to see this collection of original letters. These documents were issued by Nickolls in 1743.Original Letters and Papers of State, addressed to Oliver Cromwell, concerning the Affairs of Great Britain. From the Year mdcxlix to mdclviii, found among the Political Collections of Mr. John Milton. Now first published from the Originals. Oldys says in his diary that Nickolls allowed Thomas Birch to use some of them in his life of Oliver Cromwell in the General Dictionary, Historical and Critical, 1731‚Äì41. Death and burial Nickolls died of fever on 11 January 1745, and was buried at the Quaker Burying Ground, Bunhill Fields, five days later.

History No. 18 Maintenance Unit RAF, (18 MU) was allotted to No. 41 Group RAF (41 Gp) and became the lodger unit on 17 June 1940. No aircraft were flown in until the end of June when the obstructions placed on the airfield to prevent enemy aircraft from landing were removed. 18 MU reverted to a tenant unit on 13 July 1940 and No. 10 Bombing and Gunnery School RAF (10 B&GS;) of No. 25 Group RAF (25 Gp) (RAF Flying Training Command) relocated from RAF Warmwell, Dorset. 10 B&GS; trained bomb-aimers and gunners in Handley Page H.P.54 Harrows and Fairey Battles before further training at Operational Training Units. The airfield consisted of a grass runway, upgraded to hard surfaces due to the demands of operational training. Whilst this work was being undertaken 10 B&GS; utilised the satellite landing ground at RAF Winterseugh, Annan, Dumfries and Galloway. Due to the numbers of aircraft 18 MU was forced to disperse the aircraft to satellite landing grounds at RAF Low Eldrig near Stranraer, RAF Lennoxlove near Haddington, RAF Wath Head in Cumbria and also RAF Hornby Hall, Cumbria. No. 11 Sub-Ferry Flight was posted to the airfield between April and July 1940. 10 B&GS; was re-designated No. 10 Air Observers School RAF (10 AOS) in September 1940 and began training navigators in Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and Blackburn Botha aircraft. In April 1940 10 AOS was renamed No. 10 (Observers) Advanced Flying Unit RAF (10 (O)AFU) and was re-equipped with Avro Ansons. RAF Dumfries had a moment of danger on 25 March 1943, when a German Dornier Do 217 aircraft shot up the airfield beacon, but crashed shortly afterwards. The pilot, Oberleutnant Martin Piscke was later interred in Troqueer Cemetery in Dumfries town, with full military honours. On the night of 3/4 August 1943 a Vickers Wellington bomber with engine problems diverted to Dumfries but crashed 1 1‚ÅÑ2 miles (2.4 km) short of the runway. Over 400 courses had been conducted during the Second World War at RAF Dumfries. 10 (O)AFU was again renamed No. 10 Air Navigation School RAF (10 ANS) in August 1945 and disbanded in September 1945. 18 MU closed in 1957 having prepared and dispatched almost 5,000 aircraft to units and after the war stored aircraft awaiting disposal.

Along with the Tiffany Club it was one of Los Angeles's premier jazz venues in the 1950s and strongly associated with West Coast jazz. History Author James Lincoln Collier describes the club as \\"the best-known Los Angeles jazz club of the day\\". Located across from the Ambassador Hotel, which housed the famous supper club,The Cocoanut Grove. The Haig club was originally a bungalow home, which was then converted by owner John Bennett into a club. It has been described as looking more like a doll house than a club. In early 1952 Gerry Mulligan walked into the club and found Erroll Garner, Bobby Short and others jamming without amplification. He joined in on an informal Monday night jam. He would later take over the jam night. Mulligan would audition and work with artists such as Chet Baker, Chico Hamilton and Bob Whitlock and many others. In its time, Erroll Garner, Shorty Rogers, Red Norvo, Laurindo Almeida, Ornette Coleman and Bud Shank all played the club. Gerry Mulligan's first California band was formed at The Haig and maintained an eleven-month engagement there beginning in the spring of 1952. This edition of the Gerry Mulligan quartet would help to bring trumpeter Chet Baker to prominence. In its short life the pianoless quartet released several records for Richard Bock's Pacific label.

The castle was first mentioned in the records in 1289. In 1469 Altrathen and Neurathen castles were slighted. In 1888 the industrialist, Eduard Seifert, bought the ruins of the castle and rebuilt it in 1893 in a Neogothic style. Of the medieval castle only the cellars and parts of the spiral staircase of the keep have survived. After 1945 the building acted as a works holiday home for the VEB Brau und Malz in Dresden and later for the East German state bank. In 1995 the site was sold by the Treuhandanstalt to a private owner. Since then the building has been used as a small hotel and restaurant.

Elle came into the beauty and fashion world during the summer of 2008 and convinced Blair to join her. Their videos of makeup tutorials and clothing hauls quickly garnered a large audience and rose in popularity. As of August 2017, Elle's videos on AllThatGlitters21 have been viewed more than 180 million times, while Blair's channel juicystar07 has received over 270 million views. Both sisters previously posted vlogs under the monikers EllesGlitterGossip and otherjuicystar07, allowing subscribers to keep track of their daily lives outside of the YouTube community. Their respective second YouTube channels move away from purely beauty and fashion-related videos and branch into other topics such as health & fitness, their daily musings, and other random interests. In late 2015, it was announced that Blair and the girls' father, Scott, would be cast in The Amazing Race 28, which will be a special edition with social media personalities but their season came to an end in Leg 7 where they placed 7th. Backgrounds The sisters were born to Dr. Scott Fowler, a physician, and Melisa Fowler. Their mother is of Turkish origin and was born in Istanbul, Turkey. \\"Elle\\" was born Lisa Sylvia Fowler on May 25, 1988, and \\"Blair\\" was born Laura Elizabeth Fowler on April 1, 1993, in Augusta, Georgia. Their younger sister, Emily Kaitlin-Rose Fowler, was born on October 15, 2002. After Blair's fifth birthday, the family relocated from New Orleans to Kingsport, Tennessee, where Blair attended Dobyns-Bennett High School. Elle attended Miami University in Ohio where she joined Alpha Chi Omega. They adopted the aliases Elle and Blair as their DBA names when they began their online careers, because their parents did not want them to use their real names. YouTube career The sisters first began posting YouTube videos in 2008. In 2010 their videos received over 75 million views. They were later invited by Seventeen to offer makeup tips and suggestions to readers and in an interview with Good Morning America Blair mentioned that she had to become homeschooled due to a bullying situation in her sophomore year of high school. The two have received criticism over their haul videos potentially fueling shopping addictions and cultural idealizations of consumption and materialism, with an expert in shopping addiction listing the video as an example. In 2012 the Fowlers became the hosts and main judges of the webseries Beauty Vlogger Boot Camp, which revolved around young men and women aspiring to be online gurus. Each episode had the contestants competing in a beauty-related challenge, with one person getting eliminated before the next round begins. They have also been nominated twice for Teen Choice Awards in the \\"Web Star\\" category for 2011 and 2012. They were also nominated for the 2014 Teen Choice Awards under the category \\"Choice Web Star-Beauty/Fashion.\\" The two later released a novel entitled Beneath the Glitter (written by a ghostwriter, as cited at the end of it), with the character supposedly being only loosely based on the sisters. The Fowlers have also released a makeup line, Skylark. It later sparked controversy when they released three sample perfumes (Skylark Memoir Fragrance Collection) while having their audience vote for one of them, which would ultimately be made as a full size perfume. However, they stopped mentioning those samples, leading to frustrated followers contacting the company and being told that there will not be a full size fragrance, and that they can get a refund. The sisters have yet to address this issue. In October 2012 it was announced that they would release a shoe and handbag line in conjunction with online fashion retailer JustFab. In 2015, Elle started an online planner sticker shop called \\"Glam Planner.\\" She created a third YouTube channel in support of this venture that she posts videos to regularly. For a few years, she stopped posting on her channel, but recently started again stating that she will make videos again but not consider it her full-time job.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPnnun5MG8E Bibliography=London Sisters series #Beneath the Glitter (September 1, 2012) #Where Beauty Lies (August 13, 2013) Personal life On July 3, 2015, Elle became engaged to singer and songwriter Alex Goot.

Contemporary description The description published in 1903 by Walter Gilbey, founder and chairman of the London Cart Horse Parade Society and president of the Royal Agricultural Society. :The \\" . . . new State landau built by Messrs Hooper for King Edward VII and first used by him on the day of his coronation procession through London. :This magnificent example of the coachbuilders' art is over 18 feet long. The body is hung upon C springs by strong braces covered with ornamentally stitched morocco; each brace is joined with a massive gilt buckle with oak leaf and crown device. Between the hind springs is a rumble for two footmen; there is no driving seat as the carriage is intended to be drawn only by horses ridden postillion. The panels are painted in purple lake considerably brighter than is usual in order to secure greater effect; marking the contours of the body and the outlines of the rumble are mouldings in wood carved and gilt, the design being one of over- lapping oak leaves. :\\"The door panels, back and front panels, bear the Royal Arms with crown, supporters, mantle, motto, helmet and garter. On the lower quarter panel is the collar of the Order of the Garter, encircling its star and surmounted by the Tudor crown. Springing in a slow graceful curve from the under part of the body over the forecarriage is a \\" splasher \\" of crimson patent leather. Ornamental brass lamps are carried in brackets at each of the four corners of the body. :\\"As regards the interior of this beautiful carriage it is upholstered in crimson satin and laces which were woven in Spitalfields; the hood is lined with silk, as better adapted than satin for folding. The rumble is covered with crimson leather. It is to be observed that with the exception of the pine and mahogany used for the panels, English-grown wood and English-made materials only have been used throughout. :\\"While less ornate than the wonderful \\"gold coach \\" designed by Sir Wm Chambers and Cipriani in 1761, the new State landau, in its build, proportions, and adornment, is probably the most graceful and regal vehicle ever built.\\"Sir Walter Gilbey, Bart.

It is a crosslinking agent for polysulfide polymers and sealants.  Effects of exposure  Humans can be exposed to TCP by inhaling its fumes or through skin contact and ingestion. TCP is recognized in California as a human carcinogen, and extensive animal studies have shown that it causes cancer. Short term exposure to TCP can cause throat and eye irritation and can affect muscle coordination and concentration. Long term exposure can affect body weight and kidney function.  Regulation =United States Proposed federal regulation = TCP was not regulated as a contaminant by the federal government, but research shows that it could have severe health effects; only the state of California had significant regulation of this compound. In a drinking water project proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), TCP was one of sixteen suspected human carcinogens being considered for regulation in 2011. = State regulation = Pre-1980s, agricultural use of chloropropane-containing soil fumigants for use as pesticides and nematicides was prevalent in the United States. Some soil fumigants, which contained a mixture of primarily 1,3-dichloropropene and 1,2-dichloropropane, and in which 1,2,3-TCP was a minor component, e.g., trade name of D-D, were marketed for the cultivation of various crops including citrus fruits, pineapples, soy beans, cotton, tomatoes, and potatoes. D-D was first marketed in 1943, but is no longer available in the United States, and has been replaced with Telone II, which was first available in 1956. Telone II reportedly contains as much as 99 percent 1,3-dichloropropene and up to 0.17 percent by weight 1,2,3-TCP (Zebarth et al., 1998). Before 1978, approximately 55 million pounds/year of 1,3-dichloropropene were produced annually in the United States, and approximately 20 million pounds/year of 1,2-dichloropropane and 1,2,3-TCP were produced as by-products in the production of 1,3-dichloropropene. Over 2 million pounds of pesticides containing 1,3-dichloropropene were used in California alone in 1978. Telone II is still used for vegetables, field crops, fruit and nut trees, grapes, nursery crops, and cotton. The California State Water Resources Control Board's Division of Drinking Water established an enforceable Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 5 ng/L (parts per trillion). The state of Alaska has promulgated standards establishing cleanup levels for 1,2,3-trichloropropane contamination in soils and groundwater. The state of California considers 1,2,3-trichloropropane to be a regulated contaminant that must be monitored. The state of Colorado has also promulgated a groundwater standard although there is no drinking water standard. Although there is not much regulation on this substance, it has proved that TCP is a carcinogen in laboratory mice, and most likely a human carcinogen as well. On a federal scale, there is no MCL for this contaminant. The Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) in occupational setting for air is 50 ppm or 300 mg/m. The concentration in air at which TCP becomes an Immediate Danger to Life and Health (IDLH) is at 100 ppm. These regulations were reviewed in 2009.  TCP as an emerging contaminant  TCP does not contaminate soil. Instead, it leaks down into groundwater and settles at the bottom of the reservoir because TCP is more dense than water. This makes TCP in its pure form a DNAPL (Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquid) and it is, therefore, harder to remove it from groundwater. There is no evidence that TCP can naturally decompose, but it might in favorable conditions. Groundwater remediation of TCP can occur through in situ chemical oxidation, permeable reactive barriers, and other remediation techniques. Several TCP remediation strategies have been studied and/or applied with varying degrees of success. These include extraction with granular activated carbon, in situ chemical oxidation, and in situ chemical reduction. Recent studies suggest that reduction with zerovalent metals, particularly zerovalent zinc, may be particularly effective in TCP remediation. Bioremediation may also be a promising clean-up technique.

The visitors had a penalty in closing minutes of the first half, but failed to convert it as the taker hit the crossbar. Follow-up to the match, Swedish newspaper Idrottsbladet joked that the match ball had to be chosen from two balls ‚Äì one quadrangular and one octangular.

He was elected as a senator in 2019. Background Al-makura was born around 1952 in Lafia, Nasarawa State as a member of the Gwandara ethnic Group. He attended Dunama Primary School, Lafia (1959‚Äì1966), Keffi Teacher‚Äôs College (1967‚Äì1971) and then Government Teachers College of Education, Uyo (1972‚Äì75). For a short period in 1975 he was an Assistant Producer at the Broadcasting Corporation of Northern Nigeria. He then went to Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (1975‚Äì1978), graduating with a Bachelor of Education Degree. For his National Youth Service he was a teacher at the Government College, Makurdi. In 1978 he formed Almakura Nigeria Limited, importing and servicing agricultural and industrial machinery. Later he ventured into real estate and property development as owner and chairman of Ta'al Nigeria Limited, with properties in Abuja, Lagos, Kano and Washington DC, United States. He owns the Ta'al Lake Resort, Abuja and the Ta'al Conference Hotel, Lafia. Political career In 1980, Almakura became the youth leader of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) in the old Plateau State. He was elected to the constitution Assembly of 1988‚Äì89, representing the Lafia‚ÄìObi Federal Constituency of what is now Nasarawa State. He was state secretary of the National Republican Convention (NRC) party in Plateau State from 1990 to 1992. Al-makura was a founding member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in Nasarawa State in 1998. Al-Makura has an estimate net worth of $290 million and he defected from the PDP after losing the primary elections for the Nasarawa Governor competition. Al-Makura was elected Governor of Nasarawa State, Nigeria on 26 April 2011, running on the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) ticket. He defeated the incumbent governor, Aliyu Akwe-Doma of the PDP. Impeachment struggle On 14 July 2014 the Speaker of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly gave a notice of impeachment to the Clerk of the House to serve on Tanko Al-Makura. The Clerk was told to serve the notice on Al-Makura either directly or through the media. The document contained allegations of gross misconduct and was signed by twenty of the twenty four Assembly members. The impeachment was supported by the twenty Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members but opposed by the four All Progressive Congress (APC) members. On 17 July the House of Assembly decided that the impeachment notice would be served via the media, since the governor had been evading personal service. On 20 July 2014 it was reported that the Nasarawa traditional rulers had called on both sides to refrain from holding rallies for or against the impeachment so as to avoid violence. On 23 July four members of the Assembly tried to seize the speaker's mace to delay a motion to ask the Chief Judge of the state to set up a seven-person panel to review the allegations of gross misconduct. The members of the House met twenty minutes later and passed the motion by twenty votes against four.

It is a colorless low-melting solid used in the production of polyester resins. Commercial samples consist of a mixture of cis and trans isomers. It is a di-substituted derivative of cyclohexane and is classified as a diol, meaning that it has two OH functional groups. Commercial CHDM typically has a cis/trans ratio of 30:70. Applications Via the process called polycondensation, CHDM is a precursor to polyesters. It is one of the most important comonomers for production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or polyethylene terephthalic ester (PETE), from which plastic bottles are made. center Thermoplastic polyesters containing CHDM exhibit enhanced strength, clarity, and solvent resistance. The properties of the polyesters vary from the high melting crystalline poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate), PCT, to the non-crystalline copolyesters derived from both ethylene glycol and CHDM. The properties of these polyesters also is affected by the cis/trans ratio of the CHDM monomer. CHDM reduces the degree of crystallinity of PET homopolymer, improving its processability. The copolymer tends to resist degradation, e.g. to acetaldehyde. The copolymer with PET is known as glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate, PETG. PETG is used in many fields, including electronics, automobiles, barrier, and medical, etc. Production CHDM is produced by catalytic hydrogenation of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT).

Size is generally associated with age; however, there are variations in size at any particular age for most fish species making it difficult to estimate one from the other with precision.Helfman et al 1997 Therefore, researchers interested in determining a fish age look for structures which increase incrementally with age. The most commonly used techniques involve counting natural growth rings on the scales, otoliths, vertebrate, fin spines, eye lenses, teeth, or bones of the jaw, pectoral girdle, and opercular series. Even reliable aging techniques may vary among species; often, several different bony structures are compared among a population in order to determine the most accurate method.Polat et al 2001Khan and Khan 2009 History Aristotle (ca. 340 B.C.) may have been the first scientist to speculate on the use of hard parts of fishes to determine age, stating in Historica Animalium that ‚Äúthe age of a scaly fish may be told by the size and hardness of its scales.‚ÄùThompson 1910: Book VIII, Section 30 However, it wasn't until the development of the microscope that more detailed studies were performed on the structure of scales.Jackson 2007 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek developed improved lenses which he went use in his creation of microscopes. He had a wide range of interests including the structure of fish scales from the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and the burbot (Lota lota), species which were previously thought not to have scales. He observed that the scales contained ‚Äúcircular lines‚Äù and that each scale had the same number of these lines, and correctly inferred that the number of lines correlated to the age of the fish. He also correctly associated the darker areas of scale growth to the season of slowed growth, a characteristic he had previously observed in tree trunks. Leeuwenhoek's work went widely undiscovered by fisheries researchers, and the discovery of fish aging structures is widely credited to Hans Hederstr√∂m (e.g., Ricker 1975). Hederstr√∂m examined the vertebrae of pike (Esox lucius) and concluded that each contained growth rings which could then be used to determine the fish's age. In 1859, Robert Bell reported that one could use these growth rings to reliably determine the age of all fish after examination of sucker (Catastomus sp.) vertebrae and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) scales that he raised in a pond for two years showed ‚Äútwo rings or circles.‚Äù In 1898, more than 200 years after Leewenhoek's original insights of scale age structure, this subject was given a thorough review by C. Hoffbauer. Hoffbauer studied commercially grown carp scale growth patterns throughout the year. He noted that during the season of growth, the concentric rings were easily discernible and widely spaced; however, as growth slowed and ceased during the winter months the rings were very compact then resumed normal spacing as the growth season began again. His work convinced other researchers that these aging techniques could be used on marine species. Shortly after Hoffbauer's findings were published, structures other than scales were examined for utility of aging fish. Johannes Reibisch, working for the Commission of Scientific Investigation of German Seas at Kiel, attempted to use Hoffbauer's techniques to age plaice (Plueronectes platessa) but found it difficult to accurately discern annuli. He decided to study a different structure and in 1899 he published the first procedures using otoliths as an aging structure. A fellow scientist also with the German Commission at Kiel, Friedriche Heincke, also frustrated with difficult scale annuli, further studied other structures to age fish. He discovered annuli in the vertebrae, opercula, and pectoral girdle and published his findings in Heicke 1905. The works of Hoffbauer, Reibisch, and Heinke are most often cited as establishing scales, otoliths, and bony structures as viable aging structures. Further, Tereshenko (1913) is credited as the first to use cleithra aging techniques on roach; and Holtzmeyer (1924) with using fin rays to age sturgeon. Analysis of ages Not long after Hoffbauer's and Reibisch's findings were published, aging was used in fishery assessments of the early 1900s. One of the first to focus on the applications of fish aging was the Norwegian fisheries scientist Johan Hjort. Focusing on fish scales, Hjort developed an extensive aging program collecting statistics on birth rate, age-distribution and migration.(Hjort 1914:11) Hjort's research elicited debate from the biomathematician D‚ÄôArcy Wentworth Thompson, who later rescinded his criticisms. His research otherwise received glowing praise and would lead to fundamental changes in the way fish populations were studied and managed. Aging structures and techniques=Scales Scales are the most widely used aging structure in North America because of their non-lethal ease of collection.Al-Absy and Carlander 1988 Counting the number of annuli (rings) on a scale provides the fish age and the spacing between rings is proportional to the growth of the fish. For some examples and uses of scale aging you can go to \\"Fish scales tell a story...\\" from the Delaware Division of Fish & Wildlife. The ease of collection of this aging structure is not without its tradeoffs, as the major bias of scales used as an age estimation structure is their tendency to underestimate the age of older fish.Vandergoot 2008 Otoliths Fish otoliths are the earbones of a teleost (bony) fish and are present in pairs; fish have three pairs, the lapilli, the sagittae, astersci. These three pairs of otoliths in teleost fishes differ in form, function, size, shape, and ultrastructure. Otoliths function in fishes‚Äô hearing, equilibrium, and acceleration. Otolith microstructural studies exist for 50 families and 135 species of fish and squid.Secor et al 1991 The size and shape of otoliths vary widely depending on the species. Without prior experience it is difficult to predict the exact size, shape, and position of a given species. There is also interspecies variation, especially ontogenetic changes as a fish experiences growth. Otoliths are generally easier to read than scales and are more accurate, being internal and never reabsorbing like scales. Often the sagittae are analyzed for growth as they are the largest of the three otoliths and therefore easiest to remove. When preparing to analyze otoliths, generally if the otolith is <300 mm than it can be analyzed intact, when >300 mm otoliths contain too much three-dimensional material and must be sectioned to analyze it more clearly. The steps to preparing otoliths are to 1. Embed or mount the otolith 2. Section and polish 3. Store the otolith section safely. Calcified or bony structures The choice of calcified or bony structures for aging varies among species, a structure used in one species may not be the same structure used in another. Not all bony structures lay down growth rings equally. Such bony structures used for age estimation are vertebrae, opercula, fin rays, pectoral spines, among others. Bony structures are often compared to otoliths as far as accuracy. Some bony structures such as fin rays and pectoral spines may be harvested without sacrificing the specimen, unlike otoliths.Borkholder and Edwards 2001 Preparation for bony parts involves first cleaning by soaking the structure in bleach or boiling to remove soft tissues. Depending on the size, shape, and structure of the calcified aging part it may be examined whole or more likely, sectioned. Estimation of annuli is similar to that of otoliths. Analyzing age class structure Fish ages are often examined along with measurements of length and weight which combined can provide information on stock composition, age at maturity, life span, mortality, and production. Other purposes of performing age structure analysis are growth analysis, population dynamics estimates and resource management. Data from a particular study can delineate individuals into specific age classes. Exploited species often have the older, larger individuals removed from the population because they are the first removed by fishers leaving the younger smaller individuals. This effect may have serious consequences for that population. By performing age analysis studies we can identify these types of effects as well their implications to the status of the population. Age structure analysis can be performed by the above methods which are the most direct, through estimates of length and weight, or a combination of both. Once the data is acquired and individuals are arranged in their respective age classes, one can attempt to attribute trends to the age distribution. For example, in Jaurequizar and Guerrero (2009), the researchers were examining the age structure of a population as a function of a period of four years which experienced varying environmental conditions (two average years to El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a years). The dominant age classes were affected by the environmental conditions. While the age analysis has been around in some form for over 250 years, there has only more recently been a rapid advance in techniques and uses of this information. There are still efforts required to further validate these aging methods and to determine new techniques. As the population of the world's fish continues to decline due to exploitation age structure analysis data will only become more important as we to try understand multiple effects on population dynamics.

AOCOPM consists of three divisions of population-based medicine: Aerospace & Hyperbaric medicine, Occupational & Environmental medicine and Public Health & General Preventive medicine. AOCOPM is an affiliate society of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA),Osteopathic Specialty Colleges, AOA . AOCOPM is currently located in Harrogate, Tennessee, the home of Lincoln Memorial University-DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine. Aerospace Medicine focuses on the clinical care, research, and operational support of the health, safety, and performance of crewmembers and passengers of air and space vehicles, together with the support personnel who assist operation of such vehicles. This population often works and lives in remote, isolated, extreme, or enclosed environments under conditions of physical and psychological stress. Practitioners strive for an optimal human-machine match in occupational settings rich with environmental hazards and engineering countermeasures. Occupational & Environmental Medicine focuses on the health of workers, including the ability to perform work; the physical, chemical, biological, and social environments of the workplace; and the health outcomes of environmental exposures. Practitioners in this field address the promotion of health in the workplace, and the prevention and management of occupational and environmental injury, illness, and disability. Public Health & General Preventive Medicine focuses on promoting health, preventing disease, and managing the health of communities and defined populations. These practitioners combine population-based public health skills with knowledge of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention-oriented clinical practice in a wide variety of settings. History AOCOPM was chartered in 1979 as the American Osteopathic Academy of Public Health & Preventive Medicine. The organization merged in 1984 with the American Osteopathic Occupational Medicine Association to form the American Osteopathic College of Preventive Medicine. In February, 1995, the current name was adopted to better reflect the membership. Continuing medical education The College provides two major conferences each year: one in the spring and one in the fall. The fall conference is part of the AOA Annual Osteopathic Medical Conference and Exposition. AOCOPM also provides a three-part Basic Course in Occupational & Environmental Medicine, designed to provide a basic understanding and expertise in the field, while preparing qualified participants to take the written examination for the AOA-approved Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) offered by the American Osteopathic Board of Preventive Medicine (AOBPM) via the practice pathway. The purpose of a CAQ is to provide credentialing in the field of occupational/environmental medicine for those who already practice in this field and are certified by the AOA in another primary specialty. Publications The College publishes a semi- annual newsletter.

John Ward, portrait by Joseph Samuel Webster. Life Son of John Ward, a Baptist minister, by his wife, Constancy Rayner, he was born in London about 1679. For some years he was a clerk in the navy office, studying in spare time with the assistance of John Ker, who kept an academy, first in Highgate and afterwards in St. John's Square, Clerkenwell. He left the navy office in 1710, and opened a school in Tenter Alley, Moorfields, which he kept for many years. In 1712 he became one of the earliest members of a society composed principally of divines and lawyers, who met periodically in order to read discourses upon the civil law or upon the law of nature and nations. On 1 September 1720 he was chosen Gresham Professor of Rhetoric. Ward was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 30 November 1723. He was often elected a member of the council, and in 1752 he was appointed one of the vice- presidents. In August 1733 he made a journey through Holland and Flanders to Paris. He was elected on 5 February 1736 a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, of which he became director on 15 January 1747. In April 1753 he was appointed vice-president of that society. He also joined another society formed by a number of noblemen and gentlemen for the encouragement of learning. Among the works printed at their expense were John Davies's edition of the Dissertations of Maximus of Tyre, issued under the supervision of Ward, and the De Natura Animalium of Claudius Aelianus, edited by Abraham Gronovius, who acknowledges the assistance he received from Ward. On 20 May 1751 the University of Edinburgh conferred on Ward the degree of LL.D. He afterwards became a member of the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding. On the establishment of the British Museum he was elected one of the trustees. He died in his apartments in Gresham College on 17 October 1758, and his remains were interred in the dissenters' burial-ground, Bunhill Fields. Works His works include: * De ordine, sive de venusta et eleganti tum vocabulorum, tum membrorum sententi√¶ collocatione, London, 1712. * De Asse et partibus ejus commentarius, London, 1719 (anon.); reprinted in Monumenta vetustatis Kempiana, 1720. * Ad Con.

It is delimited Astrid Ridge in the west and the Gunnerus Ridge and the Kainanmaru Bank in the east. It is bordered by the Lazarev Sea to the west and the Cosmonauts Sea to the east, or between 14¬∞E and 30¬∞E. Its northern border is defined to be the 65th parallel south. The name, proposed by the Soviet Union, was never officially approved by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). To the south of this area lies the Princess Astrid Coast and Princess Ragnhild Coast of Queen Maud Land. In the western part is the Lazarev Ice Shelf, and further east are Erskine Iceport and Godel Iceport, and the former Belgian Roi-Baudouin Station. Name dispute The Riiser-Larsen Sea was named in 1962 by the Soviet Antarctic Expedition in honor of Norwegian aviation pioneer and polar explorer Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen (1890‚Äì1965). The IHO 2002 draft was never approved by the IHO (or any other organization), and the 1953 IHO document (which does not contain the name) remains currently in force. Leading geographic authorities and atlases do not use the name, including the 2014 10th edition World Atlas from the United States' National Geographic Society and the 2014 12th edition of the British Times Atlas of the World. But Soviet and Russian-issued maps do. Bathymetry Depths exceed 3,000 meters in most of the waters here. The area is covered with drifting ice almost year-round. It would stretch over an area of 1,138,000 km¬≤. The seafloor of the Riiser- Larsen Sea is relatively flat. The bedrock in the Riiser-Larsen Sea is one of the oldest around Antarctica (145 Ma) and erosion over this long timespan has produced the largest submarine canyons of the continent. The two dozens canyons in the Riiser-Larsen Sea can be divided into two groups: surface canyons and buried canyons. The buried canyons are twice the size and much older (4‚Äì7 Ma) than the surface canyons (younger than 2.4 Ma). The continental shelf of the Riiser-Larsen Sea is relatively narrow and forms rugged terraces at a depth of , probably the maximum extent of seafloor-reaching icebergs. The buried canyons formed during a period of maximum glaciation when grounded icebergs reached the shelf edge which resulted in a peak in sediment transport. As the ice sheet had retreated sediments got trapped on the shelf and the sediment supply to the canyons was cut off. The Riiser-Larsen Sea was one of the first Antarctic marginal basins to be affected by the expanding ice sheet at 34 Ma.The oldest, pre-glacial deposit sequence consists of turbidites and hemipelagic sediments. The expanding ice sheet initially triggered slumps and flows of debris that were deposited on the upper continental rise. Because of progradation later deposits ended up on the lower rise and the abyssal plain. Then large channel-levee complexes developed on the upper rise resulting in an unconformity associated with the Middle Miocene intensification of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Opening of Riiser- Larsen Sea The break-up of Gondwana began in the Early Jurassic between West Antarctica, Africa, and Madagascar following the Karoo eruption () centered on southern Africa. Rifting then spread towards Antarctica and seafloor spreading opened what is now the Mozambique Basin, Riiser-Larsen Sea, West Somali Basin, and Weddell Sea during the Late Jurassic. The oldest identified magnetic anomalies (M25‚ÄìM24) are 154‚Äì152 Ma old, but the break-up coincides with the Jurassic Quiet Zone and the oldest anomaly probably is M40 (166 Ma). As Madagascar had been transferred to the African Plate at M10 (130‚Äì120 Ma) spreading began between Madagascar and Antarctica ‚Äî the birth of the Southwest Indian Ridge that still separates the Mozambique Basin from the Riiser-Larsen Sea.

There are no major sports stadia in Cornwall: the largest capacity ground is the Recreation Ground in Camborne. Football club Truro City and rugby union team Cornish Pirates have both advanced plans for a new stadium, with both clubs requiring new facilities if they are to progress in their respective sports. Cornwall Council is developing a business plan for the stadium; although it initially stated any project would have to be privately funded, in April 2018 councillors voted to provide partial funding of ¬£3m towards the estimated total of ¬£14.3m for the project. History Truro City submitted a planning application for a 16,000-seat stadium, costing ¬£12 million, on the site of their existing Treyew Road ground in June 2005. The plans conceived a stadium that would host the Cornish Pirates rugby union team and music concerts as well as the Truro City football club. At the time these plans were submitted, Truro City played in the South Western Football League, several rungs below the professional football leagues in England. These plans were opposed by local residents, who were concerned that local roads would not cope with increased levels of traffic. After those plans failed, Truro City published plans to build a cheaper new stadium at Kenwyn, while building a hotel and offices on their Treyew Road ground, in May 2006. A planning application was filed by March 2007. Carrick District Council approved this plan, but a referral committee of the Council overturned that decision in September 2007. In response to this rejection, Truro City and Cornish Pirates began developing joint plans for a 16,000 seater stadium on a 50-acre site in Threemilestone. While developing those plans, the two clubs had agreed to share the Treyew Road ground, but Truro City withdrew after they were advised the pitch could not sustain both sports. Truro City continued to progress plans for a new stadium. Cornwall Council commissioned a feasibility study in May 2010, but then announced in December that any new stadium would not be publicly funded. In January 2011, Cornish Pirates owner Dicky Evans offered to underwrite the operating costs of a new stadium for the first 10 years of its operation. Evans also outlined concerns about the use of a pitch for both rugby union and football. The feasibility study commissioned by Cornwall Council was published in March 2011. The study recommended a 10,000 seat stadium at Threemilestone, with construction costs estimated at between ¬£14 million and ¬£24 million. In response to this study, the council approved funding for a business plan. In April 2011, Truro City earned promotion to the Conference South division, just one level below the Conference National. Although their Treyew Road ground is compliant with Conference South requirements, development work - either at Treyew Road or a new stadium - would need to be completed for the club to play in the Conference National. The Cornish Pirates play in the RFU Championship, and would also need a new stadium to play in if they were promoted to the Premiership. On 16 March 2011 the Stadium for Cornwall Group arranged a rally where a petition containing over 11,000 signatures was handed over to Mr Alec Robertson, Leader of Cornwall Council by Chris Davison and Margaret Lyon. Following this the Cabinet of the Cornwall Council met and approved further funding for a new stadium at Langarth, Threemilestone. Outline Planning Permission was granted on 17 November 2011. The project had been on hold until 2015, when following the general election and the Conservative Party's winning every Cornish seat, Chancellor George Osborne said the government intends to comply with the Prime Minister's pre-election promise to deliver a Stadium for Cornwall.http://www.westbriton.co.uk/Chancellor-George-Osborne-says- government/story-26559356-detail/story.html Further planning permission was passed in August 2015 which approved the proposals, subject to final legal contracts including a Section 106 agreement, and in August 2016 permission for a retail outlet at West Langarth was given which will fund the stadium. In August 2018 the Cornish Pirates announced that stadium groundwork was about to begin on 13 August 2018. Cormac Solutions Ltd have been appointed to carry out initial excavation and drilling work to confirm ground conditions at the site. Funding On 1 March 2012, Cornwall Council made a statement that it would not spend public money on a proposed Stadium for Cornwallhttp://www.cornwall.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=30750 and that any funding would come from private sources only. Cornwall Council made another statement on 11 May 2012, saying:http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=31428 Outline planning permission was passed in August 2016 for a retail park which will fund the stadium. By January 2018 work had still not started some 7 years after the idea had been first mooted, the money promised by David Cameron's government had not materialised and Stadium For Cornwall was forced to apply for public funding. There was growing scepticism as to whether the stadium would ever be built, on the back of the continued thought that the stadium was not financially viable. Posts on Facebook from the Stadium seemed to indicate that should it be built they would regard the Stadium first and foremostly a Rugby venue with the local college and Truro City Football Club being tenants, even though a large proportion of the secured funds have been through the sale of the football club's ground which will be developed as a retail park. Truro City have reportedly been researching an alternative solution to the Stadium For Cornwall saga, including ground sharing or an alternative site. The project received a boost in April 2018, when Cornwall council members voted by 69-41 (with seven abstentions) to provide partial funding of ¬£3m towards the estimated total of ¬£14.3m for the project. Members also agreed that the Council will help with preparing, submitting and supporting a bid to the Government for the further ¬£3 million needed to deliver the Stadium for Cornwall. Truro City Football Club, Cornish Pirates and Truro and Penwith College are still expected to each contribute ¬£2m towards the project, although in October 2018 Pete Masters, the Chairman of Truro City, admitted that \\"there is a shadow hanging over the club putting money into the new Stadium for Cornwall\\". Truro and Penwith College and the Cornish Pirates have offered to provide ¬£1m each to cover Truro City's funding if it fails to come through.

The French fleet consisted of a galleon of 500 tons and 30 cannons, 2 of 300 tons with 20 cannons, and the last of 300 tons and 16 cannons. The French fleet was sent filled with provisioneses to help the defenders in the Siege of Tortosa, but the squadron of the Duke of Albuquerque, knowing the enemy's plans, intercepted the French by surprise, achieving a complete victory. This case is almost unique in naval history, 6 galleys with 30 guns in total, completely defeated a squadron of four galleons with 86 guns in total, and whose crew had been reinforced by 500 musketeers. The Spaniards captured all the artillery (2 pieces of artillery of campaign and 4 mortars), ammunition carts, flags, equipment (over 1,000 musketry), and supplies from the enemy.

The initial layout dates from the 13th century, with extensive remodeling in the 19th century. History Originally belonging to the powerful and wealthy Rufolo family who excelled in commerce (a Landolfo Rufolo has been immortalized by Boccaccio in the Decameron), it then passed by inheritance to other owners such as the Confalone, Muscettola and d'Afflitto. Around the middle of the nineteenth century it was sold to the Scotsman Francis Neville Reid who took care of a general restoration, resulting in today's layout. The villa is entered through an opening in the arched entrance tower, and after a short street a clearing is dominated by the Torre Maggiore: the latter facing the bell tower of the cathedral in Ravello, overlooking the terraces (upper and lower) as well as overlooking the Amalfi Coast and the Gulf of Salerno with flower gardens that are in bloom most of the year.Ann Lar√•s, √Öke Lindman, Gardens of Italy, 2005 Of particular interest among the rooms of the villa is a large courtyard elevated like a cloister and some rooms forming a small museum.

The Court reasoned that because the IDEA was enacted under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, the law must ‚Äúunambiguously‚Äù give notice in its statutory text that parents could recover fees.

Statement of Senator Harkin on introduction When Senator Harkin introduced the bill, he explained the reasons for enactment. He said, ‚ÄúThis critical legislation will remove the financial barrier that families, especially low- and middle-income families, face as they pursue their children's rights to the free, appropriate public education they deserve and are entitled to under the Fourteenth Amendment...There are . . .times when schools have not fulfilled their responsibilities to provide an appropriate education. In these cases, IDEA provides parents the right to challenge the schools through mediation and due process. To make their argument, families often need access to expert witnesses who can assess the student's needs and testify about whether the current IEP meets those needs. These expert witnesses are a resource that many families cannot afford, but without access to them, families may be unable to make their case. ‚ÄùCong Rec 2011 Senator Tom Harkin, Congressional Record, March 17, 2011.

It is a true short action 7mm caliber cartridge based on the parent (30 T/C) case necked down to accept 7mm (.284) diameter bullets. The 7mm GPC makes the third addition to the 30 T/C lineage along with the 6.5 mm Creedmoor. The 7mm GPC is capable of producing magnum or near magnum performance, while maintaining a lightweight and compact size. This is achieved through the use of advanced case geometry and the introduction of improved propellants. The 7mm GPC works well with all .284 caliber bullets, however it is particularly effective with 168 grain and similar weight offerings. It was primarily designed as a long range match/hunting cartridge for all North American big game. 7mm (.284) bullets have the highest ballistic coefficients of any caliber in 160-190 grain offerings. This makes it an ideal long distance hunting and match caliber. At 1,000 yards the 7mm GPC (loaded with a 168 grain bullet) has roughly the same energy as a .338 Winchester Magnum (loaded with a 250 grain bullet) while the bullet trajectory is about 100 inches flatter. This is possible because of the higher ballistic coefficient and velocity of the 7mm GPC over the 338 Winchester Magnum. Any short action rifle with a .308 Winchester bolt face can be converted to shoot the 7mm GPC by having a qualified gunsmith chamber and install a new barrel.
