First discovered in 1963, on a roadside west of Lanner, Cornwall by Jean Paton, it has since been found in two other places within Cornwall. It was published as new to science in 1976. Distribution, habitat and conservation In 1963, a local bryologist Jean Paton, found an unknown specimen at a roadside to the west of Lanner, near Redruth, in west Cornwall. It was on mine spoil used to surface a small roadside lay-by. It has not been re-found at Lanner but two years later, in 1965 she found the same species at a disused copper mine on the south-east edge of Bodmin Moor at Minions. In 1997 David Holyoak found another population nearby at Crow's Nest. A small population discovered in west Cork, Ireland is likely to have been an accidental introduction from Cornwall and appears to have disappeared. The entire world population of this species covers only 0.16msq and it currently a focus species within the Back from the Brink conservation project which aims to halt its decline and stop its extinction. Ecology The moss is intolerant of competition from other plants and grows on compacted, sparsely vegetated ground, usually on or besides old paths, along tracks, occasionally on banks, as well as the crevices of old walls. The soils are humic or loamy, well drained and acid with a pH of 5.5 ‚Äì 5.8. It likes a metal-rich substrate with concentrations of copper of 151 ‚Äì 1400 parts per million (ppm). As the metals slowly leach out of the soil by weathering, other mosses can colonise and out-compete D cornubicum. These mosses include Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and Ceratodon purpureus.

He beat out Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the office but left under a cloud of financial impropriety. Before arriving in Arizona, Sippy had been indicted for theft in Parker County, Texas. He fled the state without facing the charges. On November 12, 1880, Sippy beat Virgil Earp by 311 to Earp's 259 votes in an election only two weeks after Earp was appointed to fill the office after Fred White was accidentally killed by Curly Bill Brocius. On January 4, 1881, Sippy stood for election as the permanent City Marshal and beat challenger Howard Lee. On February 28, 1881, at the Oriental Hotel, gamblers Luke Short and Charlie Storms had a verbal altercation which was temporarily defused by Bat Masterson, who was an acquaintance of Storms as well. Storms later returned to the scene and yanked Short off the sidewalk as he and Masterson left the gambling hall. Storms pulled his cut-off Colt .45 pistol, but Short was quicker. Short shot Storms twice before he hit the ground; the first shot fired was so close that it set fire to Storms' shirt. Short was alleged to have then turned to Bat Masterson and stated: \\"You sure pick some of the damnedest friends, Bat.\\" Sippy arrested Short, but the shooting was determined to have been made in self-defense. The city council reprimanded him for being absent without leave. In May, they criticized him for \\"action in regard to releasing certain prisoners\\". He also helped defuse a lot-jumping confrontation in December 1880. Sippy was praised for his handling of the mob intent on lynching Johnny Behind the Deuce, on January 14, 1881, helping to convince them to disperse. But by June 1881 Sippy was in trouble. On June 6, 1881, he asked the city for a two-week leave of absence and Virgil Earp was appointed as acting city marshal. Angry creditors came forward, complaining Sippy owed them money. On June 22, during Sippy's absence, Tombstone was hit by a large fire. Earp ably managed the disarray and kept lot jumpers at bay. Less than a week later, the City of Tombstone discovered $3,000 in financial improprieties in Sippy's records. Earp was appointed as Chief of Police.

After a period in Berlin, from 1886 to 1888 he studied in Paris and Italy. He returned to Leipzig in 1889, and for the next few years, worked for the University of Leipzig, where he produced the marble busts of Anton Springer, Karl Thiersch, Bernhard Windscheid and Carl Ludwig. After J.S. Bach's skull was found in 1894 during the building of , in 1895, Seffner and Wilhelm His were commissioned to produce an anatomical reconstruction.

The Boathouse District offers activities such as recreational and elite rowing and kayaking, fitness facilities, private event spaces and RIVERSPORT Adventures, an outdoor adventure park. The Oklahoma City Boathouse Foundation, which manages the Boathouse District, has been named a U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Training Site by the U.S. Olympic Committee. History The development of the Boathouse District began with the early 1990s revitalization of the seven-mile section of the North Canadian River that runs through Oklahoma City. As rowing gained popularity in Oklahoma City on Lake Overholser, Mike and Tempe Knopp, leaders of the Oklahoma Association for Rowing, discovered that the Oklahoma River would be a perfect waterway for rowing. The Oklahoma Association of Rowing, began a grassroots effort to build a boathouse along the shores of the Oklahoma River. Aubrey McClendon and Clay Bennett soon took interest in the project and helped secured funding for the multimillion-dollar boathouse. The first boathouse in the Boathouse District, the Chesapeake Boathouse, was built in 2006. The Devon Boathouse was completed in 2010, followed by the Chesapeake Finish Line Tower in 2011. The CHKCentral Boathouse is currently under construction and is scheduled to open in spring 2015. Plans for the University of Oklahoma Boathouse are underway. Chesapeake Boathouse The Chesapeake Boathouse, built in 2006, was the first structure on the newly revitalized Oklahoma River. Today it anchors the Boathouse District and serves as the community boathouse on the river. The design is the vision of Oklahoma City architect Rand Elliott with primary funding for the project provided by Chesapeake Energy Corporation. The design of the Chesapeake Boathouse represents a sleek rowing shell with translucent polycarbonate walls offering a dramatic nighttime image of the building ‚Äúfloating‚Äù above the river. Sixteen columns of light representing oars highlight the reflecting pool at the ‚Äúbow‚Äù of the building. Features of the $3.5 million facility include: * Deck, lobby, and event room for receptions and meetings * Boat bays to store up to 124 rowing shells * A panoramic 24-ft. wall of glass overlooking the deck, river, and reflecting pool * Event room with a 62-foot window revealing the boat bays * Fully equipped fitness/training room overlooking the river Devon Boathouse The Devon Boathouse is the home of Oklahoma City University Rowing and Canoe/Kayak and headquarters for the OKC National High Performance Center. The OKC National High Performance Center provides training opportunities for Olympic hopefuls in both rowing and canoe/kayak. Designed for OCU by Rand Elliott, Elliott & Associates Architects, the Devon Boathouse is one in a series of iconic boathouses in the Boathouse District at the Oklahoma River in Oklahoma City. Its dramatic architecture creates a striking image against the backdrop of Oklahoma City‚Äôs downtown skyline and creates the impression of the boathouse‚Äôs ‚Äúprow‚Äù breaking the river‚Äôs edge. Soaring spaces created by glass and polycarbonate walls are flooded with natural light and include a two-story boat bay and the Ann Lacy Event Center. Expansive windows offer unobstructed views of the Oklahoma River and a second story balcony overlooks the boat bay ramps and docks. Blue LED lights accent the exterior of the boathouse at night, adding to the dramatic images of the Chesapeake Boathouse and OGE Together Lightscape on the river. Chesapeake Finish Line Tower The Chesapeake Finish Line Tower was designed by Oklahoma architect Rand Elliott. The 60 foot tower is clearly visible from Interstate 35. The 7,500 square foot building has four levels. These include a welcome center, finish line jury/timing seats, commentary/media/race control and a VIP Viewing Gallery and observation deck. The Chesapeake Finish Line Tower has the newest in race technology and meets the standards for both FISA, the international governing body for rowing, and the International Canoe Federation. The finish line for the Oklahoma River is attached to the tower itself and is graphically represented on nearby sidewalks and inside the building as a continuous red line. Outside, terraced seating is provided for spectators to have an outdoor view of the finish line. CHKCentral Boathouse The CHKCentral Boathouse serves as home to the University of Central Oklahoma‚Äôs women‚Äôs rowing team. It also includes a live music venue and an art gallery, establishing it as a unique presence ‚Äúwhere art meets the river‚Äù in the Boathouse District at the Oklahoma River. The CHKCentral Boathouse opened in April 2015 and is the newest boathouse in the Boathouse District. OU Boathouse Plans for the University of Oklahoma Boathouse, home to the OU Women‚Äôs NCAA Division I program, are underway. The facility has received $2 million in funding as part of a $12.5 million donation to support OU academics and athletics from Aubrey and Kathleen McClendon.

Originally elected in the local elections held on 30 March 2014, the results in Yalova were invalidated by the Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey and the vote was re-held on 1 June, confirming his victory. He is a member of the Republican People's Party (CHP). Early life and career Born in Yalova, Salman graduated from Uludaƒü University as a veterinary surgeon and worked within Yalova for over 20 years. He began writing for the local Haberci newspaper and later served as the editor and owner of the Yalovamƒ±z newspaper for over seven years. Also writing as a columnist for online local news sites, he remains as a representative for his hometown in the ƒ∞stanbul Board of Veterinary Surgeons.http://www.haberturk.com/kisi/vefa-salman/secim-2014/chp-yalova- merkez-belediye-baskan-adayi-163 Early political career He served as a member of the CHP Yalova provincial executive council for two terms, from 2003 to 2004 and from 2008 to 2009. From 2004 to 2007, he served on the executive council for the CHP Yalova district association. From 2004 to 2009, he was a municipal councillor for Yalova and the CHP group spokesperson. Mayor of Yalova, 2014 ‚Äì present Election as mayor Salman was the CHP candidate for the Mayor of Yalova, running against the incumbent Yakup Ko√ßal from the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the local elections of 2014. Initially ahead in the count, the AKP requested a recount, after which the AKP was declared the winner by a single vote. After the CHP requested a recount in 65 ballot boxes, the district electoral council decided to hold recounts in 124 ballot boxes, after which Salman was declared the winner by 6 votes.http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/26136730.asp The Supreme Electoral Council subsequently cancelled the election in Yalova, rescheduling fresh elections for 1 June. Salman subsequently won the election by 228 votes over his AKP rival.http://www.internethaber.com/yalova-secim- sonuclari-1-haziran-679811h.htm?interstitial=true His campaign was actively supported by Yalova Member of Parliament Muharrem ƒ∞nce, who was then a parliamentary group leader for the CHP. Deforestation controversy As a CHP politician, Salman came under scrutiny for authorising the deforestation of several trees in order to make way for a new bridge and road junction. This was especially due to the strong environmentalist approach that the CHP and many party supporters took during the Gezi Park protests in 2013, which had initially began due to government plans to demolish a city park in order to build a shopping mall. In response to criticism, Salman claimed that it had pained him to take the decision, but noted that the trees were not being cut down to make way for a new shopping mall, a thermal power station or new municipal offices. Rather, it was to increase the safety of a dangerous road junction responsible for several road casualties, and that as mayor he needed to prioritise human lives over trees.http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2014/gundem/vefa- salman-ilk-kez-konustu-663716/ Personal life Salman is a fan of Fenerbah√ße sports club, having served as the President of the Yalova Fenerbah√ße Association for two terms. He is also a Poet, with his first book √ñzg√ºnce being published in 2007. His second book was also published, and a third is currently being written. He is married to Dilek Salman, an English teacher. Their only son died in a car crash in 2012.http://www.memurlar.net/haber/272116/ References Category:1965 births Category:People from Yalova Category:Living people Category:Contemporary Republican People's Party (Turkey) politicians ","title":"Vefa Salman"},{"id":"46217722","title":"Rathbarry and Glenview Studs Juvenile Hurdle"},{"id":"46217744","text":"Anatole Bailly (; Orl√©ans, 16 December 1833 ‚Äì 12 December 1911, Orl√©ans) was a French Hellenist, author of the famous Dictionnaire grec-fran√ßais (Greek- French Dictionary), published in 1895.  Biography Anatole Bailly was born at Orleans on 16 December 1833 to a family of moderate wealth - his father was a director of the auditing company L'Orl√©anaise and his mother ran a small store selling groceries, fruit and sewing supplies. He studied at a college in Orleans and obtained a bachelor of letters. He was then sent to Paris to prepare for entry into the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in a private institution, which he graduated from in 1853. Anatole Bailly began his career in education as a substitute at the lyc√©e in Lyons. There he successfully achieved the agr√©gation de grammaire. Named a professor at the lyc√©e in Lyon, he left this city in 1859 for a job at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris. In 1861 he was hired by the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Orleans, his home town. He spent the rest of his career in this post, from which he retired in 1889. A competent and conscientious, but very modest, professor, Bailly authored numerous textbooks, grammars and dictionaries of Greek and Latin which were popular in French schools at the end of the 19th century. He was equally interested in history and wrote many biographical accounts of overlooked people from Orleans. He became a member of Orleans scholarly societies of Orleans: the Soci√©t√© d'Agriculture, Sciences, Belles-lettres et Arts d'Orl√©ans and the Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique et historique de l'Orl√©anais. At a national level, he was a member of the Conseil acad√©mique de Paris and the Association pour l'encouragement des √©tudes grecques en France (from its foundation in 1867), in addition to being appointed a correspondent of the Institut de France in the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres in 1889. Among other roles, Bailly was an officer of the Acad√©mie, a knight of the L√©gion d'honneur, and a knight of the royal order of the Sauveur de Gr√®ce. After the publication in 1885 of the Dictionnaire √©tymologique latin which he co-authored with Michel Br√©al, Bailly completed the Dictionnaire grec-fran√ßais with the assistance of √âmile Egger in 1895. This last work assured his scholarly reputation. The abridged version, which was about half the length of the original, appeared in 1901. He was in the process of producing a revised edition of what would come to be known as Le Bailly, when he died suddenly on 12 December 1911 in his family home, in which he had spent the greater part of his life. A college in Orleans established in June 2008 is named in his honour.  References  * Serge Vannier, Les Hommes c√©l√®bres du XXe dans le Loiret, Romorantin, CPE, 2001. * A. Bouvier, \\"Notice sur M.

Life  Marko Ciciliani was born in 1970 in Zagreb, Croatia. In 1971 his parents emigrated to Germany where he predominantly grew up in Karlsruhe.Mihali, Alexander: Skladatelj treceg milenija, Zagreb: WAM ‚Äì webzine about audio and music, 6/2007 Starting in 1990 he studied composition and music-theory with Ulrich Leyendecker at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Hamburg. From 1993 to 1994 he spent a year in New York City, studying at the Manhattan School of Music with Nils Vigeland. After returning to Hamburg he continued his studies until his graduation with Manfred Stahnke. In 1996 he emigrated to Amsterdam, Netherlands, where he studied until 1998 as a post- graduate student at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. His principal teachers during that time were Clarence Barlow and Louis Andriessen.Hiller Egbert: Einbr√ºche des Unvorhersehbaren, Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, Mainz: Schott Verlag, 4/2010, p.62f Ciciliani remained in Amsterdam until 2010, living primarily as a free-lance composer and playing an active role in the Dutch music scene. Since the early 2000 he was also increasingly active as a sound-engineer and performer of electronic music. He performed with many leading ensembles and orchestras, such as the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Melbourne Symphony Orchestra or the SWR Orchestra, as well as MusikFabrik and ASKO. In 2007 Ciciliani started a PhD at the Brunel University London under supervision of Bob Gilmore and Johannes Birringer. He completed his doctorate studies in 2010 with a thesis on interrelationships between visual media and music, specifically in the context of using light designs as part of compositions. In 2010 he moved to Austria, taking up a teaching position at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna. In 2011 he became guest- professor at the Institute of Electronic Music and Acoustics (IEM) of the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz. In October 2014 he was appointed full professor for computer music composition and sound design at the IEM.  Work   Open Form Period  Already in his early works Ciciliani showed a fascination for works of open forms which formed the center of his works from 1999.‚ÄúVoor het horen geboren‚Äù, CD liner notes, Darmstadt: Coviello Classics, p.3 This interest was partly fed by his fascination for the music of John Cage which was one of the reasons why he went to study in New York City with Nils Vigeland - a former close collaborator of Cage. In order to be able to extend open form and algorithmic principles to the realm of electronic sound synthesis, he started using SuperCollider in 2001. His open form period culminated with the live-installation \\"Map of Marble\\" which was premiered at the Zagreb Biennale in 2005 Oskamp, Jacqueline: Onder Stroom, Amsterdam: Ambo, 2011, p.46f Also in 2005 he released the CD \\"Voor het Hooren Geboren\\" containing open form chamber music played by ensemble Int√©grales.  Improvisation and No-input Mixer  From 2000 Ciciliani started experimenting with electronic improvisation. Between 2001 and 2005 he co-organized the concert series Kraakgeluiden in Amsterdam with Anne LaBerge.Metselaar, Helen: Women and 'Kraakgeluiden': the participation of women improvisers in the Dutch electronic music scene, in: Organised Sound Vol.9, Issue 2, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 199-206 This weekly series featured electronic improvised music and became an important center for the experimental music scene in the Netherlands. As an instrument for improvisation Ciciliani used a no-input mixer, a mixing board in which internal feedbacks are generated by connecting the outputs to the inputs.Simonis, Lukas: Marko Ciciliani, Controleer de Onvoorspelbaarheid, Fake Magazine, June 2003Holmes, Thom: Electronic and Experimental Music, Third Edition, New York: Routledge, 2008, p.187 In 2008 he released the CD \\"81 matters in elemental order\\" which was entirely produced and composed with the no-input mixer. Shortly after this release he stopped performing with the no- input mixer.  Audiovisual Works  Ciciliani started to work with lighting as an important part of his compositions in 2003.Hiller Egbert: Einbr√ºche des Unvorhersehbaren, Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik, Mainz: Schott Verlag, 4/2010, p.63 This became one of his main areas of interest which also led to his dissertation at Brunel University in 2010. In 2005 he founded his own ensemble ‚ÄúBakin Zub‚Äù, which focussed on multimedia works which combine instrumental parts, live-electronics and visuals. Bakin Zub's last public appearance was in 2014, when it premiered Ciciliani's program-length work \\"Suicidal Self Portraits\\" at the festival Forum Neuer Musik Deutschlandfunk in Cologne. More recently, Ciciliani has primarily worked with live-video in his audiovisual works, as for example in his solo compositions \\"Via\\" or \\"Formula minus One\\". After having realized two works using laser in 2007 and 2009, he used this medium again in his \\"Steina\\" for violin, live-electronics, live-video and laser. In 2015 Ciciliani produced a book titled \\"Pop Wall Alphabet\\". It is a transmedia work combining 4.5 hours of music (included as a DVD with the book), roughly 300 pages of digitally generated texts and 27 images. The work is based on condensations of material from publications of pop music, be it as superimpositions of songs, rearranged texts or combined artworks as images. The music was described a \\"monlythic verticalisation of sound\\".Gottschalk Jennie: Experimental Music since 1970, New York: Bloomsbury, 2016, p.160 The focus of this work is a study of perception and acoustic pareidolias. In 2019 Ciciliani's most recent publication was released by ChampDAction in Antwerp titled \\"Transgressions\\". It consist of a book with an integrated USB stick that contains four audiovisual compositions. Furthermore, the book contains a reprint of his text \\"Music in the Expanded Field - on recent Approaches in Interdisciplinary Composition\\", which is based on a lecture he gave at the Darmstadt Summer Courses in 2016.Ciciliani Marko: Transgressions, Antwerp: ChampDAction, 2019, p.7  Game-based compositions  In 2015, Ciciliani has been granted a PEEK project by the Austrian Science Fund with the title \\"GAPPP ‚Äì Gamified Audiovisual Performance and Performance Practice\\" (AR 364). It is a still ongoing artistic research project, which investigates elements from computer games in the context of audiovisual composition and performance for their aesthetic potential. With this project Ciciliani deepens his interest of either ouvertly referencing game culture, or integrating competitive and/or interactive elements from computer games, that can be found in his work already since \\"Homo Ludens\\" that he composed in 2013 for the Ensemble des XX. Jahrhunderts. Through the work with game-elements he is returning to principles of composition that he already thoroughly explored in his numerous open form compositions from the early 2000.Ciciliani Marko and L√ºneburg, Barbara: \\"Gamified Audiovisual Works ‚Äì Composition, Perception, Performance\\", Emille, the Journal of the Korean Electro-Acoustic Music Society, Seoul, 2018  Performances, Residencies and Teaching activities  Ciciliani's music has been performed in more than 45 countries in Europe, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. It has been programmed by festivals and concert series of alternative experimental music like Experimental Intermedia/NYC, Club Transmediale/Berlin, SuperDeluxe/Tokyo, Findars/Kuala Lumpur, Ibrasotope/S√£o Paulo or the NowNow Series/Sydney; just as much as by festivals for post- avantgarde music as Donaueschinger Musiktage, Wien Modern, Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Maerzmusik, Condit and many more. His music has been performed by high ranking ensembles like ICTUS ensemble, ensemble Int√©grales, ASKO, Zeitkratzer, piano possible and many more. In his recent work, however, Ciciliani has focused on works for smaller settings, solo works and works for live-electronics alone. He also regularly performs with a repertoire of audiovisual solo compositions. In 2009 Marko Ciciliani was recipient of the prestigious Villa Aurora Stipend, a three-month artists residency in Los Angeles. Also in 2009 he was composer-in-residence of the 14th Composers Forum in Mittersill/Austria. He received numerous project- residencies at STEIM, ESS, ICST and ZKM. In 2014 Ciciliani has taught at the Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music where he also presented a portrait concert. This invitation took place as part of the IEM's studio residency at the Summer Courses. In 2016 he has also been invited individually as teacher to the Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music, where he offered individual lessons and a.o. a workshop on audiovisual composition, titled \\"Music in the Expanded Field\\". He returned to Darmstadt as tutor in 2018. Since 2013 Ciciliani has regularly participated at the interdisciplinary course LAbO in Antwerp, which is organized by ChampDAction He has been appointed Artistic Director of this summer course for the seasons 2020 and 2021.  Research  Ciciliani has various publications in the field of performance studies and audiovisuality. He has developed a method for the analysis of performance practices in electronic music. Here performance is understood as an audiovisual event which becomes part of the presented work and therefore gains aesthetic relevance. With this method the analysis of a particular performance practice results in a graph on a parametric field, which facilitates the comparison of different performance practices with each other. To regard performance as an audiovisual event is in line with Ciciliani's longer lasting research in the field of audiovisuality which has resulted in his dissertation and other publications. Many publications have resulted from the artistic research project \\"GAPPP ‚Äì Gamified Audiovisual Performance and Performance Practice\\" (AR 364) that Ciciliani is leading since 2016.

Sure to melt any heart.‚Äù Their second album, 2 Guns, has been described by Billboard's Allmusic Guide as \\"a remarkably strong and inspired album, taking cues from past masters but rooted in their own stories and personal flair.\\" 2 Guns also received positive reviews from The Nashville Scene, Pop Matters, and The Vinyl Anachronist, saying \\"it's rare that an album captures this kind of unabashed emotion without resorting to hip distancing devices or a wall of sound.\\" The song \\"Something I Said\\" from their sophomore album 2 Guns was licensed in ABC's hit show Revenge. A music video for the song premiered on American Songwriter and was directed by Allen Clark, famed photographer of Julian Assange. Their debut album, Sweet As Port, was described by AltCountry.NL as \\"Kim and Scott Collins carry on the torch where Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris left off in their day, delivering beautifully produced, sometimes moody, songs with knockout harmonies... A marriage of song and voice that is uniquely their own.\\" Since forming their own label in 2009, The Smoking Flowers have toured consistently, at times performing over 100 shows a year all across the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan. Their live show has a reputation for high energy, intimacy and sensuality, Pop Matters calling them \\"provocative and risky.\\" Skip Anderson, writer for The Nashville Scene, says ‚ÄúThe Smoking Flowers write inspired songs of substance about life, death, and everything in between. Their albums are consistently outstanding. And, better still, their live shows aren't to be missed. I stand amazed that all that music comes from just two people. Their music drips in their love for each other and their thirsty lust for life.‚Äù They met in the summer of 1998, while Scott was visiting his brother in Nashville. Kim was managing the infamous Nashville music venue 12th & Porter and Scott walked in looking for a job. Six months later, the couple was engaged. They have been married for 19 years and have made their home in East Nashville. They are both activists and advocates for holistic and alternative medicine and healing techniques. Kim was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 and healed the dis-ease with holistic and alternative methods only.

A bias incident is different from a hate crime in that it does not necessarily involve criminal activity. Examples include graffiti, verbal abuse, and distribution of hate group literature.  On school campuses  Organizations such as the U.S. Community Relations Service, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Anti-Defamation League recommend that school administrators denounce bias incidents on their campuses regardless of whether a crime is committed. Reasons for having such a policy include preventing minor incidents from escalating into violence and protecting the reputation of the school and its surrounding community. Supporters of such policies say that they help maintain an atmosphere of civility in which people feel free to express themselves without fear of retaliation.Community Relations Service. pg. 19. A response to a bias incident begins with the victim or a bystander reporting it to the school's administration. After receiving the report, a school official (often a campus police officer) may begin to collect evidence and offer physical and emotional support to the victim.Community Relations Service. pg. 13. The institution may issue a public statement in order to dispel rumors, calm tensions, and state that bias incidents are not tolerated. School leadership may hold an open meeting to discuss the incident. Diversity training events may be included during orientation programs in an effort to prevent bias incidents from happening in the future.Wessler & Moss. pp. 11‚Äì13.  Law enforcement  Even if there is no crime to prosecute, some jurisdictions encourage their citizens to report bias incidents to the police. Police officers can provide assistance to the victims, and some police departments are required to keep records of reported bias incidents.

Together with other researchers, Naicker, Vincent and Adams, he identified a number of useful design criteria for educational games. The Game Object Model was developed, which includes abstract attributes, such as pedagogical and theoretical ideas useful in the conceptualisation of the game, and concrete attributes ‚àí the design elements used to construct the game. The main body of Amory's research concentrated on developing frameworks to support the design, construction, evaluation and use of computer games in teaching and learning, but also the development and critical appraisal of other educational technologies. He wrote a number of critiques of the use of information and communication technologies in teaching and learning, challenging the notion of learning from technology, an instructivist position The Vygotskian notion of tool-mediated knowledge construction, a core principle in learning while playing computer games, formed the basis for the development of a framework to include all educational artifacts into a coherent framework to support teaching and learning with technology. This framework is based on three interrelated concepts: Cultural Historical Activity Theory, authentic tasks and technology-mediated knowledge construction and is called the CAT framework.Amory, A.

He was the English agent for the Spanish Carlist cause, and a supporter of Irish Home Rule. He sold off the Ashburnham collection of manuscripts which the 4th Earl had collected. Early life and family Bertram Ashburnham was born on 26 October 1840, the eldest son of Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham. He was educated at Westminster School and in France. He was a convert to Roman Catholicism, and was formally received into the Church in 1872. On the death of his father in 1878, he became the 5th Earl of Ashburnham, Viscount St. Asaph and Baron Ashburnham, and inherited the family property of about 24,000 acres in England and Wales, including the main family seat of Ashburnham Place in Sussex. In 1888 he married Emily Chapman, whose father was a tradesman. Their only child, Lady Mary Catherine Charlotte Ashburnham, was born in 1890. His wife died on 12 February 1900. His daughter became a nun, entering the Sacred Heart Convent at Roehampton in 1912. Sale of the Ashburnham manuscripts Soon after inheriting his titles and property in 1878, the 5th Earl began negotiations for the sale of his father's collection of manuscripts. The 4th Earl of Ashburnham had been a bibliophile who amassed an important collection of books and manuscripts, most of which were acquired in the 1840s in three separate large purchases. The Stowe collection consisted of almost 1,000 items from the auction of the contents of Stowe House in 1847, and the Libri and Barrois collections, numbering 1923 and 702 respectively, had been purchased in 1848. Another group of 250 manuscripts, called the Appendix, was acquired over the course of the 4th Earl's life. The sale was complicated by the fact that many of the items in the Libri and Barrois collections had been stolen from French libraries by Count Libri, who then sold them under false pretences to the 4th Earl. Lord Ashburnham originally offered to sell the whole collection to the British Museum for ¬£160,000 in 1879. He refused to consider lowering the price or selling off part of the collection, and the British Museum trustees declined his offer. When he renewed it in 1883, the French government objected on the grounds that between 160 and 170 of the manuscripts, valued at ¬£24,000, had been stolen from French public libraries and therefore belonged to France. Ashburnham denied that any of the manuscripts were stolen, but was obliged to sell the collections separately, starting with the Stowe collection, which the British government purchased for ¬£45,000 in 1883. The other manuscripts were sold off over the following years, with most going to the French and Italian governments and to the collector Henry Yates Thompson. The last of the Barrois collection was finally sold in 1901. Political activities The 5th Earl of Ashburnham was a leader of the Carlist cause which aimed to restore the Spanish throne to the descendants of Infante Carlos, Count of Molina. He acted as the British agent and spokesman for the claimant Carlos, Duke of Madrid (known as Don Carlos) and later his son Jaime, Duke of Madrid. He was generally an adherent of Jacobite and Legitimist views, and in 1886 he founded the Order of the White Rose, which became \\"the main public face of British Legitimism\\". and started the brief Neo-Jacobite Revival. Carlist activity increased during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898 and its aftermath. With the Spanish government weakened by its defeat in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Carlists hoped to depose the king, by force if necessary, and replace him with Don Carlos. Ashburnham gave his opinion that the Spanish army would not defend the defeated king against the Carlist forces, and that \\"there will not be a real war, but perhaps a little fighting here and there\\". In preparation for the expected hostilities, Ashburnham allowed part of his Welsh estate to be used for military training. Among the recruits who learned to operate a machine gun and rifle and \\"studied drill, tactics and strategy\\" was the young Aleister Crowley. Ashburnham bought a yacht, the Firefly, to carry arms and ammunition to the Carlist rebels in Spain in the summer of 1899. It was seized on 17 June at the southern French port of Arcachon carrying a crew of 15 and a cargo of rifles. In early August the Times reported that the vessel had been \\"allowed to leave on payment of a small deposit\\" but that the 3,664 rifles it had been carrying had been \\"detained as security for the fine which may be imposed upon her\\". Despite Ashburnham's efforts, a Carlist coup d'√©tat did not take place. Lord Ashburnham was also a supporter of Irish Home Rule. He was a founding member and the first president of the British Home Rule Association, which held its first public meeting in London in 1886, the year of William Ewart Gladstone's unsuccessful First Home Rule Bill. According to his obituary in the Times, the meeting which he chaired was \\"one of the earliest public meetings ever held in Great Britain to advocate that policy\\". Later life, death and succession After the failure of the Carlist uprising and the death of his wife in 1900, Lord Ashburnham largely withdrew from public life and spent more time at his country properties. Don Jaime, the Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne, was a frequent guest at Ashburnham Place. Lord Ashburnham died in Paris on 15 January 1913. He was succeeded by his youngest and only remaining brother, Thomas, as 6th Earl of Ashburnham, Viscount St. Asaph and Baron Ashburnham.

Fields, p. 2 The bibliographic database IDEAS/RePEc lists him among the top 5% authors in economics according to a number of metrics, e.g. average rank score and number of citations.Statistics of Gary S. Fields' profile on IDEAS/RePEc His most-cited research article, published in 1975, analyzes the unemployment and underemployment in least developed countries in a quantity adjustment framework by making extensions to the Harris-Todaro model of rural-urban migration, namely (1) allowances for more generalized job search behavior, an urban traditional sector, preferential hiring by educational level, and labor turnover considerations. A predicted unemployment rate much lower than in the initial model and more in line with empirical observations is the result of these modifications, explaining the appeal of Fields' labor market model in development economics.Fields, G.S. (1975). Rural-urban migration, urban unemployment and underemployment, and job-search activity in LDCs. Journal of Development Economics, 2(2), pp. 165-187. In another highly cited article, co-authored with Efe A. Ok and published in 1996, Fields defines the concept of income mobility and develops a measure of income mobility which is additively decomposable into its two sources, namely the transfer of income among individuals within a given structure and the change in total income, e.g. due to economic growth or contraction.Fields, G.S., Ok, E.A. (1996). The Meaning and Measurement of Income Mobility. Journal of Economic Theory, 71(2), pp. 349-377. His most recent work centers on the working poor, defined as individuals working (often as self-employed) but earning less than $2 (PPP) per day, and their attempts to enter wage-paying employment or improve their earnings within self-employment.Gary Fields: The link between jobs, unemployment, and poverty.

The Bodley Survey was a 1609 cadastral survey overseen by Josias Bodley which aimed to study the largely unmapped areas of Ulster in the Kingdom of Ireland. It is also referred to as the Ulster Survey of 1609. The survey covered six counties Armagh, Cavan, Coleraine, Donegal, Fermanagh, and Tyrone. Following the Flight of the Earls, this was land which had been set aside for the Ulster Plantation to be granted to a mixture of English and Scottish settlers and Irish inhabitants. Bodley was a veteran of the Nine Years' War who now held the position of Inspector of Fortifications in Ireland. He had previously overseen a preliminary report of the Ulster terrain, but this was insufficient for the more formal requirements of the Plantation.Bardon p.122 The eight-man team led by Bodley included the cartographer Thomas Raven. One of the problems the surveyors encountered was that Gaelic Ireland had used differing and sometimes irregular units of measurement. Areas were often defined by natural features such as hills or rivers or man-made constructions such as tower houses or burial mounds. Bardon p.123 Because of time constraints, the surveyors mostly had to calculate the landscape on the basis local knowledge. Only occasionally were they able to actually measure in person. The study generally received co-operation from the Gaelic inhabitants. The survey was able to demarcate townlands and baronies which became the basis for later ownership. Some of the errors in the study led to land ownership disputes, and Bodley himself carried out later surveys to clarify the confusion. The survey was part of an increasing effort to use scientific methods to measure terrain in the seventeenth century. A much more comprehensive study of Ireland was undertaken in the 1650s known as the Down Survey. References Bibliography * Bardon, Jonathan. The Plantation of Ulster. Gill & MacMillan, 2012.

It is a sequel to 1994's Valhalla and the Lord of Infinity and 1995's Valhalla: Before the War in which the protagonist King Garamond II has to rescue the kidnapped ladies from an evil witch Eve's castle and find himself a woman of his dreams. Gameplay The third game in the Valhalla series abandoned the top-town view for a pseudo-isometric perspective. The control system was also changed, as the mouse became a primary input device. Plot The young King Garamond II has conquered his wicked uncle, the Lord of Infinity, and now the kingdom of Valhalla is ruled by its rightful heir. However, when Garamond decides to marry, all the eligible ladies in Valhalla are abducted by Queen Eve, an evil ruler of another kingdom and a devotee of Infinity, and imprisoned in her fortress tower as part of her plan to claim the kingdom of Valhalla as her own.

Their products are designed to provide femininity like in mainstream lingerie and other clothing items, with the function required in maternity related products. Cake Maternity was awarded the best UK Maternity brand in 2011 at the UK Lingerie Awards in Mayfair, London. History Tracey Montford founded the company in 2008, following a pregnancy of her own. She felt that maternity bras that were available at the time were often poorly designed and had poor features. After researching the market, Montford created a range of maternity bras, before expanding into other maternity fields. In 2012, the company founder was interviewed on The Morning Show on the Seven Network in Australia. Company founder Montford said during the interview that she focused on three areas when she started the brand. She wanted comfortable and attractive clothing that was also practical. Cake Lingerie in 2014 won the Best Maternity Lingerie Brand at the Junior Design Awards, which was hosted by Junior Magazine. In February 2015, a Cake Maternity model featured on the cover of Creations Lingerie magazine in their February/March edition of the magazine. The edition went on to question why so few mainstream retailers carried maternity lingerie. During the same month, the company featured on the front page of the British magazine, Gurgle. Products The company offers a range of products from maternity lingerie, essential maternity items to maternity nightwear. Made for mums in 2010 stated that their bras were one of the 10 of the best products for breastfeeding. The bras featured on The Morning Show were part of the My Bust range of nursing bras, stating that the bras are designed differently, depending on the cup size of the woman wearing the bra. The B to D Cup is designed in a plunge style and the D to G cup bra is designed in a balcony style. The products demonstrated on the show were nursing bras with drop down cups and extra sling extra support. It was also stated that all bras come with a number of hooks and eyes, allowing the bra to be adapted during a pregnancy as the woman's stomach grows. Cake Maternity also produces a range of nightwear clothing. The nightwear tops provide drop down cups from the straps for added functionality. Cupcake Nursing Pads were first introduced in 2014. Omaha Family Magazine stated that the Cupcake Nursing Pads were the only nursing pads on the market that were adaptable for low, medium and heavy milk flow absorption. This can be achieved by adding in or removing liners. UK Lingerie Awards The company's most notable achievement came in 2011, when they were part of the inaugural UK Lingerie Awards. The event was held in Mayfair, London. The company went on to win the award for best maternity lingerie brand. Cake Maternity went on to be finalists in the same category for the following three years in 2012, 2013 and 2014 at the awards.

The battle Situation in Idlib Governorate, mid-March 2015 On 24 March 2015, the newly established Fattah Army operation room (\\"The Army of Conquest\\") urged people in Idlib city to remain indoors. Later that day, two fighters from Jund al- Aqsa blew themselves up near Army checkpoints, on the eastern side of the city, followed by a three-pronged assault on Idlib. The rebels took control of the Sadkop Factory at the eastern outskirts of the Industrial District and advanced towards the Old Textile Factory before soldiers from the 11th Tank Division arrived to reinforce the NDF and push back rebel fighters to the east, securing the perimeter around the Idlib Public Cemetery. Meanwhile, at the northwestern entrance to Idlib, the rebels attacked a number of NDF checkpoints, reaching the northern side of the Youth Housing. Overall during the day, the rebels captured seven checkpoints, but the Army managed to recapture four of them, including reportedly re-securing the northern perimeter of the Youth Housing. According to a rebel commander, the clashes resulted in the death of many fighters from both sides. The SOHR put the death toll at 20 government fighters and 19 rebels, including three suicide bombers. Two of the bombers were foreigners from Gulf states. According to a military source, 44 rebels and 16 soldiers were killed. Five soldiers were also captured. During the attack, the al-Nusra Front used US-made BGM-71 TOW captured from Western-backed rebel groups. In response to the rebel assault on Idlib, government forces reportedly launched a chlorine bomb attack on the rebel-held town of Binnish, leaving dozens of people hospitalized. The next day, the air force also struck the town of Saraqib, killing 11 civilians. On 25 March, the rebels regained the four checkpoints they lost the previous day, while a fourth suicide car-bombing occurred near the city. Throughout the day, the fighting focused on the eastern entrance to the city. In the evening, according to government sources, more elements of the 11th Tank Division arrived in Idlib and launched a counter-attack in the Industrial District. In the day's fighting, Abu Jamil Yusuf Qutb, the deputy leader of Ahrar ash-Sham, was killed during an attack on an Army checkpoint near Idlib. The Hezbollah commander Al Hajj Walaa was also killed that day. Rebel sources reported that 36 soldiers were executed in Idlib for passing information to the rebels for the offensive. By the end of the second day of fighting, the rebels were in control of 17 checkpoints and military outposts, according to the SOHR. Government sources acknowledged the rebels were in control of the factories to the east of the city, with the Al-Sina‚Äôa (Industrial) Quarter being contested. However, the sources stated the Youth Housing and Al-Mahraab Quarters were declared safe zones after the rebels were driven back to the outskirts, following multiple artillery strikes by the 155th Brigade at the Hama Military Airport. On 26 March, heavy fighting took place around the eastern entrance of Idlib, which lasted into the night, killing 26 rebels and 4 soldiers. According to opposition sources, rebels captured the Al-Sina‚Äôa (Industrial) Quarter and managed to besiege the towns of Kafrayah and al-Fu'ah, after capturing a number of checkpoints connecting these towns with Idlib. The military denied this and stated that the alleged rebel gains were fabricated, but acknowledged the rebels reached the city gates for the first time since the offensive started. On 27 March, clashes in and around Idlib continued, leaving 14 rebels and 6 soldiers dead. One of the rebels killed was a Saudi commander (emir) in the al-Nusra Front. For the first time, the rebels managed to enter the city neighbourhoods, after they advanced from the northwestern and southeastern sides of Idlib. At this point, the city was almost completely encircled by rebel groups, leaving only two exit routes for government forces. The advance into the city came after the NDF retreated from the northern silos, and the opposition fighters captured most of the Hara North district and farms of Hara West. On 28 March, after NDF reinforcements arrived, at 6 A.M., a government counterattack was launched, which forced the rebels to withdraw from inside of Idlib, and government troops recaptured areas on the city outskirts. However, later in the day, rebel forces made new advances into Idlib, and at that point, were in control of up to 24 checkpoints and some neighbourhoods in the city. It was also reported that the rebels captured the pro-government journalist Abdul Ghani Jaruch. Hours later, rebels seized control of most of the city after government forces pulled back, except for the government and security buildings. However, by the end of the day, rebels were in full control of the city, with scanning and mopping-up operations continuing. During the Syrian government's retreat, 15 prisoners who were being held at the military intelligence headquarters were reportedly executed, while the rebels captured six tanks. Rebels managed to free 53 prisoners from the same complex. Syrian government troops regrouped south of the city, and were preparing for a possible attack by rebel forces. Aftermath Situation in Idlib Governorate, late-March 2015 Ahrar al-Sham and Sham Legion field commanders in Idlib after they participated in the battle to capture the city, 30 March 2015 An exodus of thousands of Idlib city civilians to nearby towns and villages was reported a day after rebels took the city. Ahrar ash-Sham issued a statement where it called for a unified Sharia-based management of the city of Idlib by the groups that captured it. Ahrar ash-Sham also threatened to shell the besieged twin Shiite towns al-Fouaa and Kefraya in response to \\"any cowardly shelling carried out against the civilians in Idlib\\". Ajnad al-Sham announced that its military leader, Abu Abdullah Taoum, was killed during clashes around al-Fouaa. Meanwhile, the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition announced in a statement that it would shift its headquarters from Istanbul to Idlib city. The al-Nusra Front refuted this with Abdullah Mohammed al-Mheisnei, a top al-Nusra Islamic cleric, stating on his Twitter account ‚ÄúIt is false that the [SNC] will enter Idlib!‚Äù. Fears had already surfaced that al-Nusra would possibly enforce a harsh religious rule over Idlib. At least one incident happened in the city, right after its capture, where foreign al-Nusra militants killed two Christians after hearing they worked in a liquor store. Consequently, Ahrar ash-Sham fighters rebuked the foreigners and set up checkpoints to protect Christians from them, with the group claiming to had secured 20 Christian families in Idlib. In response to al-Mheisnei, Ahmad Tu'mah, prime minister of the Syrian Interim Government, stated \\"it is not true that Jabhat al-Nusra refused our entry. It is actually a leader who rejected our entry and it is his right to express his opinion. We noticed during our work that not a single faction that currently represents the Army of Conquest attacked us. Moreover, Jabhat al-Nusra did not attack our relief convoys or our education or health work. The person talked about his point of view and did not issue any public statement in this regard. No one told us that it is forbidden for us to enter\\" and added that the Syrian interim government still intended to relocate to Idlib as long as they can be defended from attacks by the Assad government. Still, the question of whether an Islamic emirate would be established in Idlib remained. However, by the end of April, opposition forces established civil councils and public services. Still, an official message from al-Nusra leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani declared that the city would be governed according to Sharia, via Shura and a civil council, but showed no indication of declaring the Idlib the capital of an emirate. In response to this, a Syria expert from the Al-Hayat newspaper believed Sharia implementation would be limited following pressure on Al-Nusra from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. On 30 March, a Syrian military source accused both Turkey and Jordan of supporting the rebels in their Idlib offensive. Military shelling and airstrikes struck the city, leaving 23 civilians dead. The bombardment reportedly included chemical weapons. Overall, between 28 and 30 March, 47 people, including 15 rebels, were killed in the bombardment of Idlib city. It was also reported that Colonel Suheil Al Hassan was sent to oversee a potential operation to recapture Idlib. In contrast, an NDF fighter stationed at Jisr al-Shughour spoke to al-Masdar news and stated government troops around the city were in a state of disarray. On 1 April, the al-Nusra Front stated Idlib would be ruled according to Islamic Sharia law, but the group would not seek to monopolize power there. The next day, rebels launched an attack on the Mastouma military camp, where most of the retreated government forces were positioned, and advanced. Analysis Idlib became the second provincial capital to fall to rebel forces, after Raqqa which was captured by the rebels in March 2013, but were subsequently routed from it by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Rebels also captured the town of Quneitra in August 2014, which is nominally the capital of the Quneitra province, but had been largely destroyed and abandoned since the Six-Day War with Israel in 1967. According to some, it was a major political and strategic defeat for the Syrian government. Stratfor described the battle as a \\"pivotal victory\\" for opposition forces, while The Long War Journal called it \\"the most significant blow\\" to the government in months. Aron Lund of Syria Comment commented the defeat of government defenses in Idlib had \\"punched a gaping hole in the government‚Äôs narrative of approaching victory and boosted the opposition politically as well as militarily, spelling trouble for Bashar al- Assad\\", while Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center, speculated the fall of Idlib would be a big shock to the government and its supporters. According to others, Idlib had little or limited strategic value and was more of a morale boost to opposition forces. Now that the city was captured, rebels would potentially focus on other objectives, such as the Abu Duhour air base, Ariha, Hama, Nubl, Zahra, military supply routes to Aleppo, and potentially striking the government heartland of Latakia. The twin Shia towns of Fouaa and Kefray, now besieged, would face destruction and perhaps a sectarian massacre if they did not agree to a peace settlement with rebel forces, according to a post from Syria Comment, run by Joshua Landis. This was countered by Lina Khatib of the Carnegie Endowment, who stated in a recent report on the al-Nusra Front in northern Syria that ‚ÄúThe vast majority of those who support al-Nusra are not driven by ideology but by anti-Assad sentiment‚Äù. However, others were of the opinion that a potential rebel advance on other fronts as a result of this battle would not happen if government forces launched a counterattack to retake the city. In addition, it was viewed that the fall of Idlib would complicate Turkish efforts to win support for the enforcement of a no-fly zone over northern Syria. Taking into account the role of al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's Syria/Lebanon branch, the possibility of Idlib being the effective capital of al-Nusra-controlled territories was raised. An Ahrar al-Sham member, referring to this possibility, stated ‚ÄúI think al-Nusra is too smart to try that\\". Abu Mohammad al-Julani stated that al-Nusra Front does not \\"want to monopolise rule over Idlib city\\", calling for power sharing and adding that authority \\"does not come from scaring the people, but in protecting them, defeating their oppressor and defending the weak\\". Still, by May 2016, al-Nusra made unilateral attempts to expand its control over both Idlib and other nearby rebel-held towns, with the aim of laying the groundwork for al Qaeda‚Äôs first sovereign state (or Emirate) as Charles Lister described it.

Radner studied at the Robert Schumann Hochschule in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Both Stern magazine and Munich's Abendzeitung described her as an \\"extremely talented interpreter of Wagner's music\\". Possessing the \\"rare pitch of a true alto\\", she frequently appeared as Erda in Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at the Leipzig Opera, Schwertleite in Die Walk√ºre at the Teatro Comunale di Firenze with Zubin Mehta, and in Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (the Resurrection) conducted by Antonio Pappano in Rome and Milan. Her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 2012 in G√∂tterd√§mmerung was part of that company's documentary Wagner's Dream. Early life and education (1981‚Äì2000) Radner was born in D√ºsseldorf and had a brother, Bozidar, and a sister, Anna. Her father Klaus Radner and his wife had immigrated from Austria and started a trading company. They were not particularly interested in music. During long drives to Austria, Maria would sing for hours. At school she was a \\"rather unobtrusive, popular student\\" who enjoyed music lessons but found mathematics difficult. Her talent for singing remained unnoticed at school, but when she was 14, her parents introduced her to voice teacher Angelo Melzani, who told her, \\"I will get you into opera.\\" As a teen she took part in the Rhenish Carnival and the Largest Fair on the Rhine ('). Her father remembered her calling him excitedly after winning first prize in a beer-tent karaoke competition. She attended St. Ursula Gymnasium in D√ºsseldorf, finishing in 2000.Erzbisch√∂fliches St.-Ursula-Gymnasium D√ºsseldorf: Schuljahr 2011/12. Schulnachrichten, Nr. 59, February 2012 , (German) 24 March 2015. Vocal education (2000‚Äì2008) Radner pursued German studies for one semester, but left because she disliked it. She started training in an import‚Äìexport business and had the best grades at the vocational school, but felt that it did not suit her. She applied to the Robert Schumann Hochschule for music in D√ºsseldorf and was one of seven selected from 200 applicants. Her voice teacher, Michaela Kr√§mer, considered her to be a mezzo-soprano. Radner's father obtained additional voice lessons for her with Jeannette Zarou in D√ºsseldorf, and later with mezzo-soprano Marga Schiml, both of whom are experts in early music and Lieder. They recognized that she was really a contralto. Radner's mother died in 2003 after a long illness. Almost a year later, Radner earned her diploma. In the 2006 Bundeswettbewerb Gesang Berlin, she won the ‚Ç¨3,000 third prize in the concert category and a scholarship from the Richard Wagner Society in Bayreuth to attend the 2007 Bayreuth Festival. In the concert division of the 2007 Cantilena Singing Competition, she placed second out of 120 vocalists from 19 countries.Junge Musiker: Maria Friderike Radner Cantilena Gesangswettbewerb 2007, (German) junge-musiker-stiftung.de, 24 March 2015. In 2008 she played Cornelia in Handel's Giulio Cesare in Egitto at the Theater Hagen. It was to be her only engagement as an ensemble member at a theatre. She decided that it was \\"not her world\\", not because it was no fun, but because she wanted to earn more, and she went independent. Radner was still a student in 2008 when she made her first public appearance under Zubin Mehta at the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia in Valencia, singing Martin y Soler's oratorio Philitaei a Jonatha disperse. She gave a recital in June 2008. In August 2008 Radner performed the title role in Handel's Solomon at the Bregenzer Festspiele. Local newspapers praised her as \\"outshining\\" the other, more established British soloists (Vorarlberger Nachrichten, 19 August 2008) and as possessing the \\"rare pitch of a true alto, having an impressive charisma and great musicality\\" (Vorarlberger Neue Tageszeitung, 20 August 2008). In 2009 she performed in a new production of Parsifal under Lorin Maazel in Valencia and in Arthur Honegger's Jeanne d'Arc au b√ªcher under the direction of Antonio Pappano at Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome. Career (2009‚Äì2015) After graduating with distinction, Radner performed Schumann's Faust scenes under Jes√∫s L√≥pez-Cobos at the Teatro Real Madrid. She sang in Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 conducted by Gianandrea Noseda at the Teatro Regio Torino. She performed a recital at Wahnfried on 16 August 2009 with works by Schubert, Brahms, Liszt and Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder. In December 2009 she sang the third lady in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te under Tom√°≈° Netopil at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich in five performances. The conductor Sir Simon Rattle cast her as First Norn and Flosshilde in G√∂tterd√§mmerung at the 2009 Festival d‚ÄôAix-en-Provence and again at the Salzburger Osterfestspiele in 2010. In 2009 and 2010, Radner was part of a new production of Stravinsky's Rossignol by the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto. She then sang Beethoven's Missa Solemnis under Philippe Herreweghe at the Concertgebouw Amsterdam. In 2010, she gave her first performance as Erda in a concert adaptation of Das Rheingold at the Leipzig Opera, a role she performed every year from then until her death. In the same year she sang in Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (the Resurrection) under Pappano in Rome and Milan. In the summer of 2010 she was part of a new production of Elektra at her first summer Salzburg Festival under Daniele Gatti and Die Frau ohne Schatten, conducted by Christian Thielemann. In October 2010 she appeared as Dryad in Ariadne auf Naxos at the Theater an der Wien, conducted by Bertrand de Billy. Radner performed the third lady in Die Zauberfl√∂te at La Scala under Roland B√∂er during March and April 2011, and Rheingold's Erda in Essen conducted by Stefan Soltesz in April. At the Salzburg Festival in July and August she was \\"a voice from above\\" and a servant in Richard Strauss's Die Frau ohne Schatten under Christian Thielemann. She performed Martha in Tchaikovsky's Iolanta and \\"death\\" in Le Rossignol, both under Ivor Bolton. In November 2011 she sang Siegfried's Erda in Leipzig under Ulf Schirmer. In January 2012 Radner made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in G√∂tterd√§mmerung. The production was documented in the film Wagner's Dream by Robert Lepage and the 11 February 2012 performance was recorded and broadcast by radio. In March 2012, she participated in Die Frau ohne Schatten at La Scala under Marc Albrecht. In the fall of 2012, she was at the Royal Opera House in London performing in three Wagner operas conducted by Pappano: the Erda in Siegfried and Rheingold during September and October, and the first norn in G√∂tterd√§mmerung during October and November 2012. She sang in Dvorak's Requiem under Tomas Netopil in Lyon, and in Mahler's Symphony No. 3 under Sebastian Weigle in Frankfurt am Main.

Personal life Scottish mezzo-soprano Karen Cargill summarized \\"Maria Radner, my beloved friend\\" in The Guardian: \\"She was the most generous-spirited person I have ever met. Hysterical laughter, an obsession with all things Burberry, unadulterated passion for Bayern Munich and the warmest of hugs were things you could always be guaranteed of when you were with her. Her son and partner were her whole life.\\" Further down Cargill qualified the latter, in that \\"Music was Maria's entire life until she met her partner and they had their son.\\" The authors of an article in the German weekly Stern echoed this sentiment when they wrote that \\"Radner was a happy mother. Radner had a side, that many internationally successful opera stars are not privy to: her own family.\\" Stern described photos of her private life, published one week prior in Bild, showing the young woman embraced by her partner Sascha Schenk in the soccer stadium with a scarf of FC Bayern Munich, and him holding their infant son, who is sitting on a motorbike. Stern wrote that \\"privately Radner was able to simply be Maria, the wife of insurance specialist Sascha S.\\" According to Opernnetz \\"Radner had moved with him [Schenk] to Wuppertal-Kronenberg.\\" Bild wrote \\"They lived in Mettmann. She was travelling a lot professionally, while he looked after his insurance clients in Wuppertal.\\" Their son Felix Schenk was described as one year old by Bild, and as two years according to the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.  Death  Radner died on 24 March 2015 along with her husband Sascha Schenk, their two- year-old son Felix, and her colleague Oleg Bryjak, when Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed near Prads-Haute-Bl√©one, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France. The First Officer had a history of depression, barricaded himself into the cockpit, and deliberately crashed the plane into the mountains.Tim Hepher France urges tougher pilot checks after Germanwings crash Reuters, March 13, 2016 They were en route to D√ºsseldorf after Radner's and Bryjak's two performances in Wagner's Siegfried at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona. Radner's voice teacher Michaela Kr√§mer said \\"she was a magnificent artist and yet remained unassuming, helpful and natural\\". The Metropolitan Opera issued a brief statement, mourning her \\"untimely and tragic death\\" and calling her \\"a gifted artist who touched the lives of many\\". The Deutsche Oper am Rhein expressed sympathy. Discography *Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin Choir / Wagner ‚Äì Richard Wagner: Das Rheingold. 28 May 2013.

CLOVES syndrome affects people with various symptoms, ranging from mild fatty soft-tissue tumors to vascular malformations encompassing the spine or internal organs. CLOVES syndrome is closely linked to other overgrowth disorders like proteus syndrome, Klippel‚ÄìTr√©naunay syndrome, Sturge‚ÄìWeber syndrome, and hemihypertrophy, to name a few. It can also cause fat to move to the back, and many cases undescended testicles. 'CLOVES' is an acronym for: * C is for congenital. * L is for lipomatous, which means pertaining to or resembling a benign tumor made up of mature fat cells. Most CLOVES patients present with a soft fatty mass at birth, often visible on one or both sides of the back, legs and/or abdomen. * O is for overgrowth, because there is an abnormal increase in the size of the body or a body part that is often noted at birth. Patients with CLOVES may have affected areas of their bodies that grow faster than in other people. Overgrowth of extremities (usually arms or legs) is seen, with large wide hands or feet, large fingers or toes, wide space between fingers, and asymmetry of body parts. * V is for vascular malformations, which are blood vessel abnormalies. Patients with CLOVES have different venous, capillary, and lymphatic channels - typically capillary, venous and lymphatic malformations are known as \\"slow flow\\" lesions. Some patients with CLOVES have combined lesions (which are fast flow) and some have aggressive vascular malformation known as arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The effect of a vascular malformation varies per patient based on the type, size, and location of the malformation, and symptoms can vary. * E is for Epidermal naevi, which are sharply-circumscribed chronic lesions of the skin, and benign. These are often flesh-colored, raised or warty. * S is for Spinal/Skeletal Anomalies or scoliosis. Some patients with CLOVES have tethered spinal cord, vascular malformations in or around their spines, and other spinal differences. High-flow aggressive spinal lesions (like AVM) can cause serious neurological deficits/paralysis. The syndrome was first recognised by Saap and colleagues who recognised the spectrum of symptoms from a set of seven patients. In this initial description the syndrome is named CLOVE syndrome. It is believed that the first description of a case of CLOVES syndrome was written by Hermann Friedberg, a German physician, in 1867. Causes Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA have been identified as a cause of CLOVES syndrome. PIK3CA is a protein involved in the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway. Mutations in other parts of this pathway cause other overgrowth syndromes including Proteus syndrome and hemimegaencephaly.

Early years The theatre initially borrowed space from the local Women's Club, the York Collegiate Institute, and the local YWCA. Its first full-length performance was Lady Windermere's Fan at the Phineas Davis School Auditorium on December 14, 1933. After two unsuccessful attempts at securing its own real estate, the theatre acquired a permanent home at the Elmwood Theatre, a former cinema built and opened in 1949. After a lease-purchase agreement was signed in July 1953, the theatre gained title to the building seven years ahead of schedule in May 1956. Leadership and growth Bert Smith was artistic director from 1953 until 1982. Eric Bradley Long was artistic director until 2010. Lyn Bergdoll became artistic director in 2012. A addition to the theatre was completed in 1997, after more than $1 million was raised under the leadership of Henry Leader, brother of former Pennsylvania governor George M. Leader. After 2012, the theatre recovered from its own major financial crisis suffered in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, paying off debts and making long-overdue improvements to the building and stage equipment. Changes According to the executive director, the theatre was renamed after its street in mid-2016 due to a migration of the former name's meaning. While \\"little theater\\" originally connoted \\"community theater\\", it has more recently been applied to \\"children's theater\\" or \\"smaller productions\\". The theatre's most enduring fundraiser has been an annual food stand at the York Fair, at which steak sandwiches are sold. The stand was started in 1957 by Betty Gerberick and run by volunteers. A partnership with the local Roosevelt Tavern began in 2017 to operate the stand from 2018 onward. Alumni Notable theatre alumni include Rebecca Wisocky and Sam Freed.

The journal was published by Leipziger Dieterich-Verlag until 1944. After a first continuously numbered series of the journal from 1901 to 1923, a \\"New Series\\" was begun in 1925, which restarted at number one and came to an end with number 18 in 1944. In 1959, the first volume of a renewed series was published by Akademie Verlag (East Germany) as number 37 (as if the two previous series had been continuously numbered), although the journal Historia had been founded in 1950 in West Germany as a replacement. A third \\"major\\" journal, Chiron appeared from 1971. However, the importance of the pre-war series ensured that the full set was reprinted at the beginning of the 1960s, although not in the same format or at the same quality as the original publication. Until 1992, Klio was edited by the government-controlled Zentralinstitut f√ºr Alte Geschichte und Arch√§ologie. However, it also published works of Western historians and sometimes included Russian language contributions. Important articles appeared in Klio even after 1959, but the publications of East German scholars at this time were not always up to date or at the level of international research, as a result of the shortage of money and the enforcement of the state's ideological views. In 1993 the journal received a new editorial board. The current editors are Manfred Clauss (Frankfurt am Main), Hans-Joachim Gehrke (Freiburg/Berlin), Peter Funke (M√ºnster) and Christian Mann (Mannheim). From 1903 until 1944 and again since 1999 (in a Neuen Folge - new series) the journal has published Klio-Beihefte (Klio Supplements), consisting of monographs, mostly published doctoral theses.

History It was located on the south bank of the American River, four miles east of Sacramento on a road leading to the gold fields, that later became L Street, in the vicinity of what is now the California State University Sacramento. Norristown was built above the reach of flooding by the river, unlike Sacramento below it. During the flooding of Sacramento in 1852‚Äì53 it began as a settlement called Hoboken, for citizens of Sacramento who fled the inundation of their city. Sam Norris who owned the land tried to make it a permanent settlement, however most of the refugees returned to Sacramento and Norristown failed to grow and soon vanished.

The NDUFA3 protein is a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain.  Structure  The NDUFA3 gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.42, and it has a total span of 4,123 base pairs. The NDUFA3 gene produces a 9.3 kDa protein composed of 84 amino acids. NDUFA3 is a subunit of the enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), the largest of the respiratory complexes. The structure is L-shaped with a long, hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the NADH binding site. NDUFA3 is one of about 31 hydrophobic subunits that form the transmembrane region of Complex I. It has been noted that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of Complex I. The highly conserved two-domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane.  Function  The human NDUFA3 gene codes for a subunit of Complex I of the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. However, NDUFA3 is an accessory subunit of the complex that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Initially, NADH binds to Complex I and transfers two electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic arm to form FMNH2. The electrons are transferred through a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the prosthetic arm and finally to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), which is reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2). The flow of electrons changes the redox state of the protein, resulting in a conformational change and pK shift of the ionizable side chain, which pumps four hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix.  Interactions  NDUFA3 has been shown to interact with ubiquitin C, a polyubiquitin precursor.

VFL career Condon was born in Hamilton, but recruited locally to Geelong, from the St Mary's club. Following a premiership with the seconds in 1948, he made his senior debut for Geelong in the 1949 VFL season as a mature recruit, two weeks shy of his 27th birthday. Condon, who worked off the field as a fireman, quickly became Geelong's regular ruckman. Described as a \\"good battler\\", he won the club's \\"best first year player\\" award for 1949. He played 14 of a possible 19 games that year, with a suspension for attempting to strike Footcray's Dick Wearmouth costing him four weeks. In 1950, Condon made 17 league appearances. He showed his capabilities as a forward when he kicked eight goals in Geelong's 33-point win over Footscray at Kardinia Park in round two. His final game for Geelong was the 1950 preliminary final loss to North Melbourne, when they gave up a 39-point quarter time lead. He kicked two goals in the 17-point loss. Coaching He accepted an offer in the 1951 pre-season to be playing coach of Portland in the Western District Football League. They finished runners-up in Condon's first season as coach, then in 1952 he steered the club to their first premiership in the league, with a six-point grand final win over Hamilton, which were led by former Melbourne player Fred Fanning.

The NDUFA3 protein is a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain. Mutations in the NDUFA4 gene are associated with Leigh's syndrome.  Structure  The NDUFA4 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 7 at position 21.3 with a total length of 8,234 base pairs. The NDUFA4 gene produces a 9.4 kDa protein composed of 81 amino acids. NDUFA4 has traditionally been defined as a subunit of the enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) (Complex I), the largest of the respiratory complexes. The structure of Complex I is L-shaped with a long, hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the NADH binding site. It has been noted that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of Complex I. The highly conserved two-domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane. More recent research has demonstrated that no perturbation of Complex I occurs upon NDUFA4 deletion, calling into question its role in this complex. It has been demonstrated that NDUFA4 plays a role in Complex IV function and biogenesis, however, with some authors suggesting that the NDUFA4 gene be renamed and the structure of both Complex I and Complex IV be re-evaluated.  Function  The human NDUFA1 gene codes for a subunit of Complex I of the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. Mammalian complex I of mitochondrial respiratory chain is composed of 45 different subunits; the protein encoded by this gene belongs to the complex I 9kDa subunit family and it has NADH dehydrogenase activity and oxidoreductase activity. It transfers electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. Initially, NADH binds to Complex I and transfers two electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic arm to form FMNH2. The electrons are transferred through a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the prosthetic arm and finally to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), which is reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2). The flow of electrons changes the redox state of the protein, resulting in a conformational change and pK shift of the ionizable side chain, which pumps four hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the NDUFA4 gene can result in Leigh's syndrome, a severe neurological disorder that typically arises in the first year of life. Disruption of Complex IV, also called cytochrome c oxidase or COX, is the most common cause of Leigh syndrome.

It was erected in 1919 at a site now partly located within today's Gezi Park, near Taksim Square in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire. The monument was located on the premises of the former Pangaltƒ± Armenian Cemetery. In 1922, during the Turkish National Movement, the monument was dismantled and subsequently lost under unknown circumstances. History Background The Armenian Genocide was the Ottoman government's systematic extermination of its minority Armenian subjects from their historic homeland within the territory constituting the present-day Republic of Turkey. The total number of people killed as a result has been estimated at between 1 and 1.5 million . In the aftermath of World War I, with the Ottoman Empire defeated, the Allied forces occupied various parts of the Ottoman Empire; the British seized control of Constantinople and the Bosphorus. During this period, the first commemoration of the Armenian Genocide was organized on 24 April (Rumi calendar: 11 April), the day that marked the beginning of the deportation of Armenian intellectuals. The commemoration, organized by a group of Armenian Genocide survivors, was held in Istanbul in 1919 at the local Holy Trinity Armenian church. Many prominent figures in the Armenian community participated in the commemoration. Following its initial commemoration in 1919, the date became the annual day of remembrance for the Armenian Genocide. Monument's inauguration After the first commemoration, plans were implemented to build a monument dedicated to the victims of the genocide. A committee was formed to carry out the project. It was eventually erected in 1919 and was located on the premises of the Pangaltƒ± Armenian Cemetery. The cemetery, which was to be later demolished and confiscated by the Turkish government in the 1930s, was located in today's Gezi Park near the Taksim Square in Istanbul. The monument became the first memorial dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide. In 1922, during the resurgence of the Turkish National Movement, the monument was dismantled and subsequently lost under unknown circumstances. According to historian Kevork Pamuk√ßuyan, the base of the monument was last seen in the gardens of the Harbiye Military Barracks (which now houses the Istanbul Military Museum). Legacy The monument was featured on the cover of a 1919 book dedicated to the memory of the victims of the genocide written by Teotig, the prominent Armenian writer and publisher. During the Gezi Park protests, various activists demanded that the memorial be rebuilt. Cengiz Algan, a leading member of a NGO called \\"Dur De\\" (Say Stop), expressed his support to having the monument rebuilt by saying: See also * Armenians in Turkey * Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day * List of Armenian Genocide memorials References External links *Full online edition of Teotig's Hushartsan April Tasnemegi (in Armenian) Category:Armenian Genocide memorials Category:Buildings and structures in Istanbul Category:Monuments and memorials in Turkey Category:1919 sculptures ","title":"Istanbul Armenian Genocide memorial"},{"id":"46218891","text":"is a road cyclist from Japan.

Life  On the right side the tombstone of Pierio Valeriano and on the left that of his uncle Urban Bolzanio The epithet \\"Bolzanio\\", by which he is universally known, was never used by Urbano, but was an invention of his nephew Pierio Valeriano which was subsequently extended to his whole family (Urbano is referred to by the sobriquet in his grammatical work's posthumous edition of 1545). It is not inappropriate, however, since the Delle Fosse family was originally from Bolzano, a village near Belluno. Despite the claims of Pierio Valeriano, the Dalle Fosse family was not noble and Urbano himself was the son of a craftsman (a \\"mastro Pietro\\"). In 1450, when he was eight years old, Urbano appears as a novice at the Conventual Franciscan convent of San Pietro di Belluno. In 1465 he was still a student at the monastery, but in 1466 he was in Treviso, perhaps to study theology. In 1472 he spent time in the convent of San Nicol√≤ della Lattuga in Venice, probably in order to further his studies in philosophy and dialectic. Wishing to study eastern languages and learn about eastern civilizations, he travelled by foot to Thrace, Greece, Syria, Arabia, Palestine and Egypt between 1473 and 1489. His account of these travels is lost, but is referenced by many surviving works. Returning to Italy, he climbed Mount Etna twice to study the crater, which Pietro Bembo references in his dialogue De Aetna. He was follower of Constantine Lascaris at Messina, friend of Pietro Bembo, and collaborator of Aldo Manuzio,Lowry Martin, Il mondo di Aldo Manuzio, Roma, Il Veltro Editrice, 1984 for whose circle he published a grammar of Ancient Greek in 1498. Urbano was well integrated into the cultural life of Venice, where he was soon joined by his nephew Pietro Valeriano. In 1484 Urbano moved to Florence at the invitation of Lorenzo de' Medici who appointed him tutor of his son Giovanni, the future Pope Leo X. When Giovanni became a cardinal and was transferred to Pisa, Urbano returned to Venice, where he taught Greek from 1489 to 1497. In 1502, in the company of Andrea Gritti, Urbano travelled to Constantinople. The last journey of which we have record is a trip to Rome in 1515 to visit his former pupil, Pope Leo X. He died in 1525 aged 81 years, as recorded by Pierio Valeriano on his tombstone in the wall of the Basilica Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice.Chi era Costui - Scheda di Urbano Bolzanio (dalle Fosse) Works Bolzanio's most important work is a grammar of Ancient Greek published for the ciricle of Aldo Manuzio and dedicated to Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola.Fratris Urbani bellunensis ordinis minorum institutiones grammaticae.

He designed the first boat shoe and founded Sperry (formerly Sperry Top- Sider), a sportswear company now headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. Early life and family Paul Alling Sperry born in New Haven, Connecticut, the second of three sons born to Nettie Alling Sperry and Sereno Clark Sperry. His younger brother, Armstrong Wells Sperry, was a writer and illustrator of children's literature, best known for his 1941 Newbery Medal-winning book, Call It Courage. Sperry's father was a native of New Haven who served in leadership positions for several companies in the area, including the William Wells Company, the United States Finishing Company and the Pond Lily Company. His grandfather, William Wallace Sperry was a shipbuilder and served as a sergeant major in the 13th Connecticut Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. Sperry spent his early childhood in Stamford, Connecticut, and New York City. Accompanied by their mother, he and his brother Armstrong briefly attended school in Paris, France. Sperry received additional schooling at the Taft School in Connecticut. He spent a single freshman year at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Military service and marriage 1921 advertisement for Sperry's Duck Decoy Sperry worked as a salesman and in the master mechanics office of the United States Finishing Company of New York before joining the naval reserve in 1917. He served as Office Aid for Information, Section 1, 3rd Naval District, USNRF, and was released from duty as Seaman, First Class at the end of the year. Sperry married Pauline Letitia Jacques on December 30, 1922. They shared a love of the outdoors, sailing and traveling. The Sperrys spent their honeymoon on Chincoteague Island, Virginia, hunting ducks in separate duck blinds. Duck decoys An avid outdoorsman and bird hunter, Sperry designed and produced some of the first balsa wood duck decoys in the early 1920s. He started Sperry Natural Decoys, whose buyers included Abercrombie & Fitch and Kirkland Brothers. The company's sole supplier of raw materials, the American Balsa Company, raised its prices, which contributed to Sperry closing the business after fulfillment of its final orders. Sailing In the early 1930s, Paul purchased his first boat, Gilnockie. In 1935, Gilnockie won second prize in the Vineyard Race sponsored by the Stamford Yacht Club. He bought his second boat from Nova Scotia: a schooner named Sirocco after the hot winds of the Libyan deserts. The boat was later damaged during the 1938 New England hurricane at Davis Island in Connecticut. Its replacement, the Sirocco II, arrived in New Haven in 1939. It was during these early sailing years Sperry learned that painted decks were very hazardous. He said, \\"I had the idea of repainting and lightly dusting with fine emery dust, but sandpaper had poor results on skin.\\" Sperry Top-Sider Drawing from the patent for the Sperry Top-Sider, 1937 While sailing on the Long Island Sound, Sperry slipped on the deck and fell overboard. He was able to pull himself back on board, but the experience drove him to develop a non-slip shoe. While experimenting with possibilities for non-slip shoes, he noticed his dogs' ability to run down the icy hill without slipping. The grooves on their paws inspired him to try cutting grooved patterns (siping) in a natural rubber sole. Sperry tried various patterns of siping and settled on a herringbone pattern as the most effective. He cemented the prototype soles to a pair of canvas sneakers and gave them to Leon Burkowski, the young man who looked after his boat. When Sperry and his wife returned, \\"Leon immediately threw a bucket of water on the deck and yelled, 'watch.'\\" He took a running start and stopped dead in his tracks. This was the invention of the first pair of Sperry Top-Siders. In 1937, Sperry applied for a United States patent for his non- skid sole. He first offered the patent to the United States Rubber Company of Connecticut. The company turned him down because the sole would cost $4.50, when an expensive shoe at the time cost $3.75. Sperry then offered the patent to Converse Rubber Company in Boston, Massachusetts, which agreed to make blank rubber soles and ship them to Sperry for siping and then assemble the finished shoes and return them to Sperry for sale. Sperry developed a machine for cutting the non-skid design into the soles and launched the project working in his spare hours while employed full-time at the Pond Lily Company. A friend, Donald White, who worked as an advertising salesman for McGraw-Hill, suggested Sperry sell directly by mail and helped him compose a letter to send to all 500 of Sperry's fellow members of the Cruising Club of America. Sperry received responses and requests for shoes from all 500 members. Confident that he had a winning product, he started a mail order business, while also selling the shoes through the Commonwealth Shoe & Leather Company in Boston and a small direct mail catalog. In the later 1930s, Sperry continued work on developing a more durable and functional boat shoe. He worked with the United States Rubber Company, which developed a rubber compound for traction and wear that could be more easily siped, and with the Commonwealth Shoe & Leather Company on a new leather shoe design made with specially tanned leather. Sperry's new design had a unique \\"saddle\\" through which rawhide laces were pulled‚Äîthe now-familiar Sperry Authentic Original boat shoe. In 1939, the United States War Department specified Sperry Top-Sider as one of the official shoes of the Navy and negotiated the right to manufacture the shoes for its sailors. It became the official footwear of the casual uniform of the United States Naval Academy. In 1940, Sperry sold his business to the United States Rubber Company, which successfully marketed the shoe across the United States. Later career and death Sperry was interested in photography from an early age. His black and white photographs of Cannon Mountain in New Hampshire from 1938 to 1940 were donated by the Sperry Family to the New England Ski Museum in 2007. In 1950, Sperry founded Sirocco Screenprinters in North Haven, Connecticut and served as its president until his death. The company made screenprints of artwork by Josef Albers, Robert Indiana, Roy Lichtenstein, and others, which can be viewed on the websites of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Art Institute of Chicago. Sperry was named corporate secretary of the Pond Lily Company in 1941 and president and director of the Guider Specialty Company in 1955. He held both positions until the late 1970s. He also served as a director of the Echlin Manufacturing Company and president and treasurer of the Sperry Real Estate Corporation. Sperry died on November 7, 1982, in New Haven, Connecticut, at the age of 86.

Aggarwal is an Indian-American biochemist. His research has been in the areas of cytokines, the role of inflammation in cancer, and the anti- cancer effects of spices and herbs, particularly curcumin (a chemical constituent of the spice turmeric). He was a professor in the Department of Clinical Immunology, Bioimmunotherapy, and Experimental Therapeutics at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. In 2012, MD Anderson launched a review of Aggarwal's research after the federal government notified them of allegations of fraud by academic whistleblowers in as many as 65 of Aggarwal's published papers, with the allegations involving images that had been reused and manipulated to represent different results. He retired at the end of 2015; his departure was not made public until February 2016. As of 2020, 29 papers published by Aggarwal have been retracted, ten others have received an expression of concern, and 17 others have been corrected. Career Aggarwal holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Delhi (1970), a Master of Science degree from Banares Hindu University (1972) and a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of California, Berkeley (1977), all in biochemistry. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco and was employed as a scientist at Genentech from 1980 to 1989, where his team characterized the cytokines TNF- alpha and TNF-beta. Aggarwal was Chief of the Cytokine Research Section, Department of Clinical Immunology, Bioimmunotherapy, Experimental Therapeutics at MD Anderson Cancer Center of the University of Texas in Houston from 1989 to 2015. Aggarwal's research has focused on potential anti-cancer properties of herbs and spices, particularly curcumin, which is found in the spice turmeric. In 2004 Aggarwal co-founded the company Curry Pharmaceuticals, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., which was seeking to develop drugs based on synthetic analogs of curcumin. SignPath Pharma, a company seeking to develop liposomal formulations of curcumin, in 2013 licensed three patents from Aggarwal related to that approach. Scientific misconduct In 2012, MD Anderson initiated a review of Aggarwal's research after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Research Integrity notified the institution that academic whistleblowers had found evidence of image manipulation in 65 published papers by Aggarwal. Aggarwal's lawyer proposed in 2013 legal action against the blog Retraction Watch after they reported several of Aggarwal's article corrections and retractions; no such lawsuit was ever realized. In February 2016, the journal Biochemical Pharmacology retracted seven of Aggarwal's research articles, six of which had Aggarwal as senior or first author, because \\"the data integrity has become questionable.\\" Also in February 2016, MD Anderson Cancer Center confirmed that Aggarwal had retired from the Center on December 31, 2015. In June 2016, following an investigation by MD Anderson Cancer Center, the journal Molecular Pharmacology retracted two of Aggarwal's papers, citing ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù or ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù image manipulation. By April 2018, 19 of Aggarwal's articles, published in 7 research journals, had been retracted.

His murals can be found at the Watts Towers, the Capitol Records Building, White Memorial Hospital, the Ontario Airport, the Wilshire and Western Metro station, the Union Station East Portal, and many other locations. Early life Wyatt was born in Lynwood, California and grew up in Compton before moving to Crenshaw, Los Angeles. Wyatt graduated from Fairfax High School. He went on to attend the Chouinard Art Institute from 1966 to 1968 and also studied in a Tutor Art Saturday youth program at the Otis Art Institute. It was at Otis that Wyatt met and studied with Charles White, whose work was a major influence on him, and with John Riddle, who helped him improve his technique and encouraged him to address social themes in his art. Wyatt earned his B.F.A. from UCLA in 1978, and by then he had already established contacts in Los Angeles' mural movement. Career Wyatt showed artistic promise from an early age. When he was twelve, he won $200 at the first Watts Chalk-In, a sidewalk art contest sponsored by the Studio Watts Workshop. At thirteen, he participated in an art show at the Los Angeles Bahai Center, where he exhibited alongside John Outterbridge, who became a mentor and advocate. Other influential early mentors included Cecil Fergerson and Claude Booker, whom he met through his participation in the Watts Summer Festival. At the age of seventeen, Wyatt was selected to be part of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's 1972 \\"Panorama of Black Artists\\" exhibition, which garnered him widespread recognition and effectively launched his career as a member of the city's African American artistic community. Wyatt has worked as a teacher and lecturer, assisting John Outterbridge at the Watts Tower Arts Center from 1974‚Äì1978, and doing part- time, occasional teaching at the University of California, Irvine and at the Otis Art Institute. But since 1989, he has been able to devote himself full- time to his art.

The current building was constructed in 1912 by the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) to replace the previous wood frame structure which had been destroyed by fire. The brick building has granite lintels that give it a more refined look than the earlier stations. The two storey central block has two symmetrical single storeys on either end, which have had dormer windows added more recently. History The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad acquired land in 1848 for their right-of-way through Melbourne Township, which would open up the town of Richmond to business between Portland and Montreal. At the same time the Quebec and Richmond Railway was constructing a line connecting to Quebec City, making Richmond an important railway centre. The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad yard Those two railway companies became part of the newly formed Grand Trunk Railway in 1853, with the Richmond station located between the tracks at the junction of the lines. The Grand Trunk Railway was absorbed by Canadian National Railway (CNR) in 1923, who continued to operate the Portland-Sherbrooke line as its Berlin Subdivision. Richmond remained an important repair and maintenance yard until the 1950s. Passenger service was continued by Via Rail until 1994. Following Canadian deregulation in 1989, short line operator Genesee & Wyoming formed subsidiary St-Laurent & Atlantique Railroad (Quebec) (SLQ) to operate the portion of the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad line from the US border at Norton through to Sainte-Rosalie, where it connects with the CNR main line. This company has facilities beside the station and a rail yard that stretches along the east bank of the Richelieu River. Richmond station has been designated as a Heritage Railway Station of Canada since September 1991. The old station building was converted into La Vieille Gare de Richmond restaurant in the summer of 1999.

The Zeta itself was replaced by the all-new Iveco Eurocargo in 1991. Development It was originally sold with either Fiat or OM badging, with a number indicating the gross tonnage (OM 50-100). The range was thus from . It was essentially just a restyling of the earlier S-series. In France it was marketed by Unic (part of Fiat since 1966 and merged with Iveco in 1975), in Germany as a Magirus-Deutz (with air-cooled Deutz engines), and in Switzerland as a Saurer- OM or Saurer-Fiat, also available with a Saurer engine. The range then gradually began using the unified Iveco name in 1979 (retaining a hyphenated \\"OM\\" or \\"Fiat\\" during the transition). This process was finished by 1982. After Iveco took over Ford's European truck operations in 1986, the Zeta appeared with combined Ford and Iveco badging in the United Kingdom. Even after the Iveco nameplate gained prominency (center grille), secondary \\"Fiat\\" or \\"Magirus\\" or other badging still appeared in the bottom left corner of the grille, depending on the market. The Zeta was issued in a myriad configurations, as it had to replace a variety of existing truck lines from several different producers. Originally three different engines and four different wheelbases were offered. Single or double cabins as well as a number of van models with an available raised roof were available. A tilting cab was offered on the 7.9 ton \\"79\\" and was standard on heavier models. The range received a light facelift and model shuffle in 1979. Later more engines were added, as well as models which were tailored to suit various local markets. Iveco's naming system during the Zeta's production consisted of two sets of numbers divided by a period: the first digits reflected the gross vehicle weight (GVW) in hundreds of kilograms, while the second set reflected the power in tens of horsepower. Thus, a five-tonner with the engine carries 50.10 badging. There was also a tractor unit version of the 50.10 available.Inufa 1982, pp. 120-121 Magirus-Deutz models Versions with the air-cooled Deutz F4L913 engine were called 90D or 90M, with the GVW (in tonnes) following - the range reaching from the 90D5,2 to the 90M7,9. \\"D\\" or \\"M\\" refers to the cab - in most cases, Ulm-developed designs carried a D while external designs such as the Club of Four carry an M. It is unknown why both letters were used concurrently on the Zeta cab. In 1983, the Deutz-engined models were discontinued. TurboZeta Iveco TurboZeta 79-12 In 1987 the turbocharged Iveco TurboZeta arrived. This had turbocharged versions of the 3.9 litre four- cylinder Iveco 8040 engine with either . The TurboZeta was facelifted somewhat and received more aerodynamic, rectangular headlights. These later found their way into the remainder of the range. The TurboZeta and Zeta were also license built by Zastava Kamioni in Kragujevac, in the former Yugoslav republic. Zastava built the truck until at least 2012, and they were exported through Iveco channels to many markets. Since 2004 it has been sold as the EuroZeta, after a facelift and updates to meet the then current Euro III emissions standards. More recent versions (85.14) have a Cummins diesel engine which meets the Euro IV emissions requirements. The Zeta was also built in Turkey, by Otoyol Sanayi from 1990 until 2006. Late, heavier-duty Otoyol Ivecos had their headlight openings blanked and the lamps placed below instead, in the bumper. In the United States, Iveco Trucks of North America offered the TurboZeta under the EuroTurbo name in the 1980s, until they ended North American sales in mid-1991. A range of trucks with GVWRs from were available, sold in Classes 3, 4, 5, and 6. The Class 3 EuroTurbo 12-12 had a four- cylinder turbodiesel engine while the 10-14, 12-14, 15-14, and 18-14 all have a six-cylinder engine. The 23-16 was the only Class 6 model and received a inline-six. The Zeta was gradually replaced from beneath by the heavier versions in the S-series (Daily), and at the top by the lighter duty Ford Cargos (which were sold as Iveco-Fords in some markets, beginning in 1986). In Germany and some other markets, the Iveco-Magirus MK range (Club of Four) also encroached at the top end of the Zeta range. Eventually, in 1991, the all new Eurocargo replaced the remainder of the Zeta range in most Western markets. While large numbers of Zetas were built over a fairly long production life, not many remain in Western Europe. Always built down to a price (and often with indifferent rust protection) they were usually disposed of at the end of their working life. As they look a bit too modern for most classic truck collectors, most remaining European Zetas will likely end up crushed or exported.

Tundra reindeer include the Novaya Zemlya (R.t.pearsoni) and Lapland (R.t. tarandus) subspecies and the Siberian tundra reindeer (R.t. sibiricus). Novaya Zemlya reindeer Novaya Zemlya reindeer R.t.pearsoni The subspecies of reindeer, the Novaya Zemlya (R.t.pearsoni). on the islands of the Novaya Zemlya, were herded by the Nenets. Novaya Zemlya is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean in the North of Russia and the extreme Northeast of Europe, the easternmost point of Europe lying at Cape Flissingsky on the Northern island. The indigenous population (from 1872 to the 1950s when it was resettled to the mainland) consisted of about 50‚Äì300 Nenetses who subsisted mainly on reindeer herding, fishing, trapping, polar bear hunting and seal hunting. Lapland reindeer A subspecies of reindeer, Lapland (R.t. tarandus), a semi-domesticated reindeer are widespread in Lapland. Reindeer herds visit the grasslands of the Kola Peninsula in summer. Sami people and reindeer herding Nomadic Sami people with reindeer skin tents and clothing in 1900-1920. By the end of the 1st millennium CE, the Kola Peninsula was settled only by the Sami people. who were engaged mostly in reindeer herding and fishing. The Sami people, traditionally known in English as Laplanders are one people living in four countries. There are about 2000 Sami in Russia. They are an indigenous Finno- Ugric people inhabiting the Arctic area of S√°pmi, which today encompasses parts of the Kola Peninsula of Russia, far northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and the border area between south and middle Sweden and Norway. Their best- known means of livelihood was semi-nomadic reindeer herding. The Sami are the only indigenous people of Scandinavia recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples, and are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe. By the end of the 19th century, the indigenous Sami population had been mostly forced north by the Russians and the Komi and Nenets people who migrated here to escape a reindeer disease epidemics in their home lands. The Sami peoples were subject to forced collectivization, with more than half of their reindeer herds collectivized in 1928‚Äì1930. The collectivization efforts in the 1930s lead to the concentration of the reindeer herds in kolkhozes (collective farms), which, in turn, were further consolidated into a few large-scale state farms in the late 1950s‚Äìearly 1970s. In addition, the traditional Sami herding practices were phased out in favor of the more economically profitable Komi approach, which emphasized permanent settlements over free herding. Since the Sami culture is strongly tied to the herding practices, this resulted in the Sami people gradually losing their language and traditional herding knowledge. Most Sami were forced to settle in the village of Lovozero; those resisting the collectivization were subject to forced labor or death. Various forms of repression against the Sami continued until Stalin's death in 1953. In the 1990s, 40% of the Sami lived in urbanized areas, although some herd reindeer across much of the region. Siberian tundra reindeer Siberian tundra reindeer (R.t. sibiricus) \\"may be divided further into regional forms: the Taimyr Bulun, Yano-Indigirka and Novosibirsk islands (Egorov, 1971).\\" There are three large herds of migratory tundra wild reindeer in central Siberia's Yakutia region: Lena-Olenek, Yana-Indigirka and Sundrun herds. While the population of the Lena-Olenek herd is stable, the others are declining. Further east again, the Chukotka herd is also in decline. In 1971 there were 587,000 animals. They recovered after a severe decline in 1986 to only 32,200 individuals, but their numbers fell again. According to Kolpashikov, by 2009 there were less than 70,000. Taimyr reindeer herd Putoran Mountains Taimyr reindeer winter taiga pastures The Taimyr reindeer herd, a migrating tundra reindeer (R.t. sibiricus), is the largest reindeer herd in the world. In the 1950s there were 110,000. In 2000 the herd increased to 1,000,000 but by 2009, there were 700,000 animals. The Putorana Nature Reserve, covering , (a World Heritage Site since 2010), was established in 1988 to protect Taimyr reindeer herd as well as snow sheep. The reserve is located on the Putorana Plateau, a mountainous area at the northwestern edge of the Central Siberian Plateau, to the south of Taymyr Peninsula. Taimyr tundra reindeer migrate to winter taiga pastures in Evenkia and Putoran Mountains. in the forest-tundra and taiga from the river Taz in the west and to the Anabar in the east. Forest reindeer \\"Flerov (1952) and Sokolov (1959) divided forest reindeer into Siberian (R.t. valentinae) and Okhotsk (R.t. phylarchus). Egorov (1971), Vodopyanov (1970), Stremilov (1973) and Mukhachev (1981), however, inferred from their studies that the forest reindeer of Evenkia, Trans-Baikal Territory, Southern Yakutia and Far East are the same subspecies.\\" Wild forest reindeer, are similar to the woodland caribou in North America. The male wild forest reindeer weighs - and the female -. As the ice sheets melted 10,000 years ago, wild reindeer reached Fennoscandia from the eastern side of the Baltic Sea. Their range reached its peak in the 1600s-1700s. At that time wild forest reindeer inhabited nearly the \\"entire Eastern Fennoscandian and Northwestern Russian areas all the way to Ilmaj√§rvi.\\" By the eighteenth century their range was being reduced and fragmented. They were \\"hunted to extinction in Finland in the late 1910s, but continued to live in the remote backwoods of Russian Karelia.\\" By the early 2000s \\"the southern boundary of the range of wild forest reindeer in Karelia has retreated to the north, and the population is fragmented.\\" Today the wild forest reindeer is found in Russia, in Kom and Arkhangelsk, as well as Karelia. The wild forest reindeer is an increasingly rare species in most of Russia. Mountain reindeer in the Kirov area are extremely endangered. Many are listed in the Red Book as endangered: Republik of Komi: wild mountain reindeer; Krasnoyarsk area: R. t. valentinae , two subspecies: Angara stock, Altai-Sayan stock; Altai Republic: Siberian forest reindeer, R.t.valentinae; Buryatia Republic: Mountain reindeer; Kamchatka region: Ohota orkamchatka forest reindeer, R. t. phylarchus; Sakhalin area: Ohota forest reindeer, R. t. phylarchus.The site has been made as part of the wild forest reindeer project, partly financed by the Karelia ENPI CBC Programme. The site has been cooperatively prepared by Mets√§hallitus, the Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute (RKTL) and the Institute of Biology at the Karelian Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Maintained by Mets√§hallitus. Other populations are listed as vulnerable and rare including the Republic of Karelia: Wild forest reindeer, Rangifer tarandus fennicus; Tjumen area: Mountain reindeer, Rangifer tarandus; Kemerovo area: R.t. angustifrons; Irkutsk area: Siberian forest reindeer R. t. valentinae, wild forest reindeer subspecies Sayano-Altai stock; Khakassia stock; Tyva Republic: Siberian forest reindeer, R. t. angustifrons; Magadan area: Ohota forest reindeer, R. t. phylarchus. Reindeer husbandry According to Sev‚Äôyan I. Vainshtein, Sayan reindeer herding \\"is the oldest form of reindeer herding\\" and is associated with the \\"earliest domestication of the reindeer by the Samoyedic taiga population\\" of the Sayan Mountains at the \\"turn of the first millenium A.D... The Sayan region was apparently the origin of the economic and cultural complex of reindeer hunters-herdsmen that we now see among the various Evenki groups and the peoples of the Sayan area.\\" The Sayan ethnic groups still live almost exclusively in the area of the Eastern Sayan mountains. There are over two dozen regions where reindeer husbandry has been part of the economy in Russia. Domestic \\"reindeer are sharply distinct in conformation and colouration and their morphological and ecological characteristics vary regionally. Like their wild conspecifics, regional variation in domestic reindeer may be explained by environmental conditions.\\" East Siberian Sea The coast of the East Siberian Sea was inhabited for many centuries by the native peoples of northern Siberia such as Yukaghirs and Chukchi (eastern areas). These tribes were engaged in reindeer husbandry, fishing and hunting and reindeer sledges were essential for transport and hunting. They were joined and absorbed by Evens and Evenks around the 2nd century and later, between 9th and 15th centuries, by much more numerous Yakuts. All those tribes moved north from the Baikal Lake area avoiding confrontations with Mongols. Whereas they all practised shamanism, they spoke different languages.Yukaghirs, Great Soviet Encyclopedia (in Russian)Evenks, Great Soviet Encyclopedia (in Russian)Bella Bychkova Jordan, Terry G.

In 1926, the ethnologist Bernhard Eduardovich Petri, (1884-1937), led the first anthropological expedition into the Soyot reindeer-herding region. Petri described a difficult period in Russian history claiming that Soyot reindeer herding was a \\"dying branch of the economy.\\" Pavlinskaya argued that \\"later research and data collected from Soyot elders show that the herding tradition easily overcame the period‚Äôs difficulties and endured until the middle of the 20th century, when the government interfered.\\" In 2000 reindeer peoples of Mongolia and Russia were working on collaborative efforts to rebuild reindeer-herding. Plumley suggested that the Soyot of Buryatia‚Äôs Okinsky Region, the Tofilar of Irkutsk Oblast, the Todja-Tuvans of the Republic of Tuva in Russia, and the Dukha of Mongolia‚Äôs Hovsgol Province, who are \\"cultures of reindeer-habitat\\" in Central Asia may well \\"have traded, inter-married and related across the breadth and width of the Sayans.\\"  See also  * First Nations * Indigenous peoples  Additional sources  The range of writings on Arctic reindeer herding is quite vast.

One can find early contributions to unitary memory theories in the works of John McGeoch in the 1930s and Benton Underwood, Geoffrey Keppel, and Arthur Melton in the 1950s and 1960s. Robert Crowder argued against a separate short-term store starting in the late 1980s.Cowan, N. (1995). Attention and memory: An integrated framework. Oxford Psychology Series #26. New York: Oxford University Press. James Nairne proposed one of the first unitary theories, which criticized Alan Baddeley's working memory model,Nairne, J. (1990) A feature model of immediate memory. Memory & Cognition 18 (3), 251-269 which is the dominant theory of the functions of short-term memory. Other theories since Nairne have been proposed; they highlight alternative mechanisms that the working memory model initially overlooked. Background Overview Working memory is the system that is responsible for the transient holding and processing of new and already stored information, an important process for reasoning, comprehension, learning and memory updating. Working memory is generally used synonymously with short term memory, but this depends on how the two forms of memory are defined. Working memory includes subsystems that store and manipulate visual images or verbal information, as well as a central executive that coordinates the subsystems. It includes visual representation of the possible moves, and awareness of the flow of information into and out of memory, all stored for a limited amount of time. In 1974, Baddeley and Hitch introduced and made popular the multicomponent model of working memory. This theory proposes a central executive that, among other things, is responsible for directing attention to relevant information, suppressing irrelevant information and inappropriate actions, and for coordinating cognitive processes when more than one task must be done at the same time. The central executive has two \\"slave systems\\" responsible for short-term maintenance of information, and a \\"central executive\\" is responsible for the supervision of information integration and for coordinating the slave systems. One slave system, the phonological loop (PL), stores phonological information (that is, the sound of language) and prevents its decay by continuously articulating its contents, thereby refreshing the information in a rehearsal loop. It can, for example, maintain a seven-digit telephone number for as long as one repeats the number to oneself again and again. The other slave system, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, stores visual and spatial information. It can be used, for example, for constructing and manipulating visual images, and for the representation of mental maps. The sketchpad can be further broken down into a visual subsystem (dealing with, for instance, shape, colour, and texture), and a spatial subsystem (dealing with location). In 2000, Baddeley extended the model by adding a fourth component, the episodic buffer, which holds representations that integrate phonological, visual, and spatial information, and possibly information not covered by the slave systems (e.g., semantic information, musical information). The component is episodic because it is assumed to bind information into a unitary episodic representation. The episodic buffer resembles Tulving's concept of episodic memory, but it differs in that the episodic buffer is a temporary store. Models Feature model The feature model was first described by Nairne (1990) The primary feature of this model is the use of cues for both short term memory and long term memory. Cues become associated with a memory and can later be used to retrieve memories from long term storage. When a memory is formed, cues associated with the formed memory form a constellation of nerve networks in which the memory is stored. While the cues are present, the nerves that form the constellation are active and the memory is being worked on in short term memory. When the cues are no longer present, the constellation is no longer active and is waiting in long term memory storage for when the cues are once again present. Rather than using the theory of decay for explaining how memories get forgotten, the feature model focuses on item based interference instead. This means that other items that use the same or similar constellations of cues get in the way of remembering other memories. For example, if you are trying to remember a fruit from a list of electronics, you will find that the fruit is easy to recall. Recalling a fruit from a list of other fruit, on the other hand, will prove a far more difficult task. This is the theory behind memory loss used in the feature model. OSCAR model The Oscillator Based Associative Recallolation (OSCAR) Model was proposed by Browne, Preece and Hulme in 2000 Brown GDA, Preece T, Hulme C. 2000. Oscillator-based memory for serial order. Psychological Review 107:127-8. The OSCAR Model is another cue driven model of memory. In this model, the cues work as a pointer to a memory‚Äôs position in the mind. Memories themselves are stored as context vectors on what Brown calls the oscillator part of the theory. While a memory is not being used in short term memory, the context vector oscillates further away from the starting position. When a cue becomes present, the context vector that the cue points to gets oscillated back to the starting point, where the memory can then be used in short term memory. There is no theory of decay in this model, so to account for memory loss or fading the theory states that memories move further and further from the starting point, and retrieval becomes more difficult the further the memory is from the gas station (starting position). Furthermore, some memories oscillate faster than others. The theory behind this is that memories frequently accessed and used will move slower away from the starting point since the probability of the memory being retrieved is relatively high. This critics the above model. Differences Unlike the standard models of short term/working memory, unitary theories do not assume a direct connection between activation level and memory success. They also do not propose role rehearsal, and they focus more on item based interference rather than memory decay.Nairne, J. (2002) Remembering Over the Short-Term: The Case Against the Standard Model. Annu. Rev. Psychol. 53:53‚Äì81 Unitary theories also generally have only one loop or no loop at all, whereas the Working Memory model relies on multiple loops to explain the different forms of memory input. Because of the multiple loop theory, Working Memory has a more difficult time explaining how short term memory gets consolidated into long term memory, whereas the Unitary Theories generally explain long term memory using the same single principle that they use to explain short term memory. On the other hand, Unitary Theories have more trouble explaining situations where short term memory differs such as the word length effect,Nairne, J., & Neath, I. (1995) Proactive interference plays a role in the word-length effect. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review December 1997, Volume 4, Issue 4, pp 541-545 which can be more easily explained by the Working Memory model. Criticisms  The most prevalent criticism of the unitary models is that they try to oversimplify many complex processes into a single mechanism. Studies have shown that short-term memory and long-term memory are two distinct processes that emphasize different levels of activation in the brain among different cortical areas. Furthermore, the rate of decay is much faster in short-term memory as opposed to long-term memory. The OSCAR model in particular does not account for this phenomenon. It also makes an assumption that memories are always circulating to different areas of the brain‚Äînever having a definite cortical space that stores the memory. While this transfer of storage is occurring, the rate of decay in the OSCAR model is either constant or non-existent. Both rates are implausible, as a constant rate of decay neglects all external factors that may contribute to a faster rate of decay (e.g. stress, focusing attention on other things). Failing to neglect decay at all is even more implausible as it makes two wrong assertions‚Äîmemories are not forgotten, and when the information is remembered, it is remembered perfectly every time. While the unitary theories of memory may give attention to alternate factors that the working memory model had initially overlooked, new data has surfaced and the model has adapted to new findings. It is still the standard model of how short-term memory works, and it will continue to be the standard model until new evidence overturns it.

It stars Lauren Ashley Carter, Dean Cates, Brian Morvant, Larry Fessenden, and John Weselcouch. Carter and Cates play siblings who stage an intervention for their unstable brother, played by Morvant. As the situation spirals out of control, they begin to wonder if what they had dismissed as their brother's paranoid delusions may be true. Writing was influenced by The Twilight Zone and classic horror films of the 1970s, including the 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which inspired the title. Shooting took place in Maine in winter 2014. It premiered at South by Southwest on March 16, 2015, and was released theatrically on August 28, 2015. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 67% approval rating based on six reviews.  Plot  After receiving a warning not to come to their family lake house in Maine, siblings Lyla and Ed stage an intervention for their brother, Martin, a dishonorably discharged veteran who believes the military has experimented on him. When they arrive, they find that he has descended into apparent paranoid psychosis and claims to have trapped a monster in the basement. Martin explains that he found a pod while hunting in the woods and believes it to be part of a government conspiracy to create artificial, inanimate assassins. Martin subsequently pulled several of his teeth to find what he believes is a tracking device. However, since he destroyed it, he can not prove it to his siblings. When Ed demands to see what is in the basement, Martin refuses to let him and reveals infected scratches across his torso, which he says were made by the trapped creature. Ed, a mental health professional, insists they take Martin back to the VA hospital where he was previously institutionalized after attacking a nurse, though Lyla wants to hear more of Martin's side of the story. Martin overhears Lyla and Ed discuss taking him back to the institution and confronts them with a knife. As they try to talk him down, Martin announces that they are all going to die anyway and slices his throat. As Ed attempts to stop the bleeding, Lyla panics. Ed forces her to go downstairs and call for help, but she discovers Martin has cut the phone's cord. Unknown to them, he has also sabotaged their car. After Martin dies from blood loss, Ed kicks open the barricaded basement door. Lyla begs him not to go down, but Ed says he must check if there is an injured person held captive. Ed initially finds nothing in the darkness, and when he turns on a light, it blows a fuse. Flipping the power back on reveals a humanoid creature, confirming that Martin had actually been telling the truth. The creature immediately attacks Ed. Ed barely escapes back up to the house. After telling Lyla to flee the house, Ed becomes disoriented as he remembers that Martin said the monster had some kind of hallucinatory venom. He slows down the monster by stabbing it with a syringe that contains a mild sedative he had intended to give Martin, then retrieves Martin's rifle. As the monster recovers and tries to rush him, Ed shoots it. Meanwhile, Lyla discovers the car will not start and runs to a nearby house. After banging on the door to no effect, she stops a passing motorist, identified later as Smith. Smith calmly questions her, says the creature is not a government conspiracy, and kills her with a shot to the head. Back at the house, Ed deliriously celebrates his victory against the creature, which he has repeatedly struck with the butt of the rifle to make sure it is dead. Ed calls out to Lyla, saying that it is safe to return; hearing this, Smith shoots and kills him. Smith contacts someone on a walkie-talkie and reports that the creature is dead, though he does not know whether there is a nearby colony of them. After giving his coordinates, Smith hears a noise behind him. The creature, still alive, attacks and kills him as he turns around.  Cast  * Lauren Ashley Carter as Lyla * Dean Cates as Ed * Brian Morvant as Martin * Larry Fessenden as Smith * John Weselcouch as John Boy * Forrest McClain as The Pod  Production  Writer-director Mickey Keating had worked with several of the cast members prior to Pod, but the roles were not written for them specifically. Keating had interned for Fessenden at Glass Eye Pix while he was in college. In relation to his previous film, Ritual, Keating wanted to make a more accessible film that could be enjoyed by wider audiences besides fans of his first film. The title is a reference to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but Keating wanted to use it partially as misdirection, as he wanted to play with audience expectations based on the title. Pod was shot in Round Pond, Maine, in winter 2014. The house used belongs to the stepbrother of William Day Frank, one of the producers. Once Keating heard that the house was available, he was inspired to create a paranoid thriller in the spirit of The Twilight Zone. Besides that, Keating was influenced by paranoid conspiracy thrillers of the 1960s and 1970s; contemporary, dialogue-heavy horror films, like Bug and The Mist; and the costume design of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Keating said that he approached writing the film as he imagined Robert Altman would, as Altman is one of his favorite directors. One of the themes that he wanted to cover was the danger of performing interventions, and the film shows the results of an intervention that goes poorly. Keating said that the film is about \\"people having to deal with a circumstance that's far bigger than themselves, before having to face anything that's necessarily genre\\". Keating enjoyed the freedom of having written his own screenplay, as it allowed him to make changes on the fly when others offered ideas; for example, Morvant came up with the idea to shave his head as a reference to Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver. Keating wanted the first half of the film to be a family drama, and he stressed to the actors that the film should not be focused on the horror elements until later. Keating did not give much direction to Fessenden and let the actor make his own decisions. Fessenden's character was written to be an ambiguous and subtle reference to the men in black UFO conspiracy theory.  Release  Pod premiered at SXSW on March 16, 2015. Vertical Entertainment acquired distribution rights shortly after its premiere, and released it to video on demand and theatrically on August 28, 2015.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 67% of six surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6/10. Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle compared it to \\"the best of The X-Files\\" and said, \\"Morvant furiously pushes the scenario to its limits, making the increasingly dangerous and erratic veteran equally enthralling, terrifying, and tragic.\\" Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Keating leaves much of Pods narrative ambiguous, which works at times but ultimately makes the film feel like an exercise in tension than a fully-fleshed movie.\\" Samuel Zimmerman of Shock Till You Drop called it \\"a jarring, exciting cinematic funhouse\\". Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"Maybe you'll be more forgiving of such a rapid- fire approach to horror filmmaking, but between Layla's borderline unwatchable nature, to a story that doesn't really have time to explain any of the chilling actions taking place, Keating's latest film struggles with being a talky, under-complicated breeze.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film's atmospheric tension is not enough to overcome the derivative storyline. Matt Boiselle of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and praised Morvant's acting, which he called a \\"potent performance\\".

He was portrayed by Bill Cosby. Conception and development Cosby originally proposed that the couple should both have blue-collar jobs, with the father a limousine driver, who owned his own car, and the mother an electricianInterview with Bill Cosby, Forum, KQED, broadcast July 23, 2014 but, with advice from his wife, Camille Cosby, the concept was changed so that the family was well-off financially, with the mother a lawyer and the father a doctor. Role Dr. Heathcliff \\"Cliff\\" Huxtable is known for his comical antics, playful admonishments, and relentless teasing humor. He lives in Brooklyn Heights, New York. He was born in October 1937 in Philadelphia, making him 47 years old at the beginning of the series. Cliff had a brother, James Theodore Huxtable, who died of rheumatic fever at the age of 7. In his high school and college years, he was an athlete who wrestled, played football, and ran track. He later served in the U.S. Navy before going to medical school. He is an OB/GYN who runs a practice from the office annexed to his home. In the show, most characters outside of family and friends refer to him as \\"Dr. Huxtable\\", and he is well-respected in the community. Cliff is married to Clair Huxtable. Both Cliff and Clair attended the fictional historically black college Hillman College. Together, they have five children: Sondra, Denise, Theodore (Theo), Vanessa, and Rudith (Rudy). Cliff enjoys live jazz, has an extensive collection of albums, and tries to eat junk food whenever he can get away with it. He attended Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Cliff is very eccentric and silly to most people around him, especially his family, however he is very kind-hearted and an extremely dedicated father with a strong sense of humor. Although he and his wife fostered a tight-knit, loving family, a running gag throughout the series is his thwarted attempts to get the grown children to leave the house. Even when he succeeded at this, more issues would come, such as Sondra finally leaving to marry her husband Elvin, only to move into a squalid tenement (albeit with Cliff's full support as he and Clair struggled in the early years of their marriage), or Denise eloping with a Navy officer with a child from a prior marriage, and Cliff now acclimating to a blended family. Very playful, Cliff enjoys competition, often making bets with Clair over various things, such as the date a certain jazz song was released, or having a \\"Smooth Contest\\" to see which of them looked more elegant for a night on the town, as judged by the children. He also plays a monthly game of pinochle against his father and some friends, which sometimes gets very passionate. Unfortunately, Cliff often finds himself on the losing end of most of his bets and games, as, for example, he has never beaten his father-in-law at chess. However, Cliff eventually broke his losing streak at pinochle against his father and his friend Homer Dobson with the help of Dr. Foster (portrayed by Roscoe Lee Brown), an expert pinochle player who also happened to be his and Clair's literary professor at Hillman College. In the first episode, Cliff's first name was Clifford, but later was changed to Heathcliff. However, in one episode, Clair calls him \\"Heathclifford\\". Reception Bill Cosby's role as Cliff Huxtable has had a mostly positive reception from critics.

The British Academy Film Awards nominated the picture for six awards, of which it won Best Actor in a Leading Role for Affleck and Best Original Screenplay.  Plot  Lee Chandler, who works as a janitor and lives alone in a basement apartment in Quincy, Massachusetts, is told his brother Joe, a fisherman, has suffered a cardiac arrest; Joe dies before Lee can get to the hospital. Lee insists on being the one to tell Joe's teenage son Patrick about his father's death. While making funeral arrangements, they learn Joe's body cannot be buried until spring when the ground thaws. Lee makes plans to remain in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, in Patrick's home, until the delayed burial. Lee meets with Joe's attorney and is shocked to discover Joe named him as Patrick's legal guardian. A flashback reveals that Lee had once lived in Manchester with his then-wife Randi and their three small children; Lee's negligence while intoxicated led to a house fire that killed the children. No criminal charges were filed against him but, after being questioned at the police station, Lee stole an officer's gun and attempted to shoot himself. He and his wife divorced and Lee left the town. In light of these events, Lee is reluctant to commit to the guardianship and is unwilling to move back to Manchester, where the locals treat him as an outcast in the light of his role in the death of his and Randi's children. Lee begins planning for Patrick to move to Boston with him but Patrick has strong links with the Manchester community and objects to the idea. Lee commits to staying until the end of the school year. Over time, Patrick and Lee re-establish their bond, despite conflicts about Joe's boat, Patrick's girlfriends, and their future living arrangements. Through flashbacks, Patrick's mother Elise is shown to have had substance abuse problems and abandoned the family. Lee is opposed to Patrick reconnecting with her. Patrick emails Elise about Joe's death and she invites him to have lunch with her. She has committed to Christianity and sobriety with her fianc√© Jeffrey but during an awkward meal with them, Patrick finds he is unable to connect with her. He is unsettled further when Jeffrey emails him and insists on being an intermediary in any future communication between Patrick and his mother. Lee's subsequent positive comments about Elise's sobriety lead Patrick to believe his uncle is trying to get rid of him, assertions Lee denies. In response to this strain in their relationship, Lee takes steps to possibly extend his stay in Manchester and seeks to spend more time with Patrick. Lee runs into his ex-wife Randi and her newborn child Dylan. A sobbing Randi expresses remorse for her treatment of Lee during their divorce and asks him to have lunch. Lee deflects her apology, feeling that he does not deserve it. When she insists they reconnect and pleads with him not to \\"just die\\", he leaves to avoid becoming emotional. Distraught, Lee gets drunk at a bar, picks a fight with strangers, and is knocked out. He awakens in the living room of family friend George and breaks down in tears. At home, Patrick shows his uncle deference after seeing his battered state and pictures of his deceased children. Lee arranges for George and his wife to adopt Patrick so that he can remain in Manchester while Lee takes a job in Boston. When Patrick asks Lee why he cannot remain in Manchester, Lee says that he \\"can't beat it.\\" During a walk after Joe's burial service Lee tells Patrick he is searching for a residence in Boston with an extra room so Patrick can visit whenever he wants. In the final scene, Lee and Patrick go fishing on Joe's refurbished boat, which Patrick has inherited.

In an essay in Cineaste, Colin Fleming writes that \\"the question Lonergan invites us to ask ourselves is how on earth would we be able to carry on after an event so tragically full of loss and guilt.\\"Fleming, Colin (Spring 2017), \\"Manchester by the Sea.\\" Cineaste. 42 (2):51‚Äì53 Speaking to the persistence of grief, Film Comment magazine says that \\"Lonergan is telling us that Lee's grief cannot be contained or subdued because his past lives on wherever he goes.\\"Koresky, Michael (November/December 2016), \\"The World is Full of Weeping.\\" Film Comment. 52 (6):48‚Äì52 Remarking on the way flash-backs appear suddenly during the movie, critic Anthony Lane says that Lonergan \\"proceeds on the assumption that things are hard, some irreparably so, and that it's the job of a film not to smooth them over.\\" He also noted the tragedy is juxtaposed with \\"the harsh comedy that colors much of the dialogue, and the near-farcical frequency with which things go wrong.\\" Along those same lines, critic Steven Mears called the film \\"a study of grief and reticence that finds droll humor in those very sources,\\"Mears, Steven (January/February 2017), \\"Manchester by the Sea.\\" Film Comment. 53 (1):47‚Äì49 and Richard Alleva says the loving but tense relationship between Lee and Patrick \\"keeps the story nicely balanced between rough hewn comedy and delicate pathos.\\"Alleva, Richard (February 10, 2017), \\"Character Studies\\".

The film's events take place through the cultural filter of a blue-collar, New England community. John Krasinski and Matt Damon initially approached Lonergan about developing the story in New England.Smart, Jack (November 24, 2016), \\"Kenneth Lonergan, 'Manchester by the Sea'.\\" Back Stage. 57 (47):16 As Lonergan researched the areas surrounding Manchester-by-the-Sea, he sought to include details specific to the area, such as its distance from Quincy, the delayed burial because of the frozen ground in a historical cemetery, and the realities of fishing life. Critic Sam Lansky said the lead character's New England roots make him \\"disinclined to emote\\", and Tom Shone said Lonergan's dialog forces \\"the story‚Äôs heartbreak to peep from behind these tough, flinty New England exteriors.\\"Shone, Tom (December 16, 2016), \\"Drowning, Not Waving.\\" Newsweek Global. 167 (22):63 Production Matt Damon and John Krasinski brainstormed a film about an \\"emotionally crippled\\" handyman, and took the idea to Lonergan for his input, thinking Krasinski would star and Damon would direct. Damon had worked with Lonergan on the 2011 film Margaret. Both actors became occupied with other projects while Lonergan worked on the screenplay for three years. After Damon read a rough draft of the script, he insisted Lonergan should direct the project and that Damon would star in it.Tapley, Kristopher (January 21, 2016), \\"With ‚ÄòMargaret‚Äô Trauma Behind Him, Kenneth Lonergan Returns to Sundance With ‚ÄòManchester by the Sea‚Äô .\\" Variety. Retrieved April 14, 2017. They announced they would collaborate on the project on September 6, 2014, and pre-production began two days later. However, Damon would not have a break in his schedule for another year. In early December 2014, while filming The Finest Hours, Casey Affleck told The Boston Globe he would replace Damon in the lead role. Damon said he \\"wouldn't give this role up to anybody but Casey Affleck.\\" Affleck officially replaced Damon on January 5, 2015. On January 9, Michelle Williams was selected to play the lead character's former wife and Kyle Chandler was cast as Affleck's character's older brother on February 24. In April 2015, Lucas Hedges joined the cast of the film. Lonergan has said Hedges' audition was \\"special\\" but that he was unsure how the young actor would perform \\"because his background is so different [from that of the character]. Ultimately he did a beautiful job.\\" It was later revealed Erica McDermott had also been cast. Coming from a theater background, Lonergan had the actors rehearse table read-style for two weeks before filming.McGrath, Charles (September 16, 2016), \\"This Time, Kenneth Lonergan Has the Last Say\\" . The New York Times. Retrieved April 14, 2017. Principal photography began on March 23, 2015, with scenes filmed in the town Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, and the North Shore at locations in Beverly, Essex, Gloucester, Swampscott, Lynn, Middleton, Tewksbury, and Salem. Filming wrapped on April 30, 2015. In October 2018, Damon said in an interview with The Bill Simmons Podcast Lonergan had originally planned to film a different ending to the film that would have been a retreating drone shot of a flashback of Affleck's and Williams' characters, their children and extended family, on his brother's boat. The scene was determined to be too expensive to film, although Damon said the film's unexpected financial success meant it could have been filmed after all. Initially, Gigi Pritzker was due to produce and finance the film through her company Odd Lot Entertainment. In March 2015, however, it was reported Kimberly Steward, through her company K Period Media, would produce and finance the film with Damon (through his company Pearl Street Films), Chris Moore (through CMP), Kevin J. Walsh (through his company B Story), and Lauren Beck, along with additional financing from Sierra/Affinity. The executive producers were Josh Godfrey, John Krasinski, Declan Baldwin, and Bill Migliore.

Music Lesley Barber was selected to score the film, as she had previously worked on Lonergan's 2000 film You Can Count On Me.Newman, Nick (November 15, 2016), \\"Lesley Barber Discusses Scoring ‚ÄòManchester by the Sea‚Äô and Kenneth Lonergan‚Äôs Precision\\" .

Retrieved April 14, 2017. Once she established the themes, Barber worked with the orchestra to create a sound that emoted the sound of the ocean with \\"underlying tension\\" with lightness, for exterior scenes. Early in the scoring process, Barber took inspiration from New England church music from the 1700s, including Calvinist hymns and other music of the Pilgrims and Colonial era, with its emphasis on a cappella vocals. Barber developed the music to complement her understanding of the essence of the film's scenes based on emails and conversations with Lonergan. To score scenes that reflect Lee's \\"interior landscape,\\" she sent the music to her daughter Jacoba Barber-Rozema, an opera major, then recorded her singing in her dorm room via Skype.\\"Composer Lesley Barber Discusses Her Score For 'Manchester By The Sea'\\" . Variety 411. Retrieved April 14, 2017. Barber said the confined space made for a \\"perfect sound.\\" Orchestration was later added to the track. For the opening flashback of Lee in happier times, Barber recorded her daughter's vocals in a large, spacious auditorium. Instead of giving Lonergan demos, Barber provided him with more-finished pieces earlier in the editing process to allow the director to have a better sense of the music while editing. The film was cut down after the Sundance screening, requiring Barber to rework and simplify some of the music. Critic Steven Mears says the film's score \\"gives form\\" to the feelings of blue-collar Americans. Bobby Finger, writing for Jezebel, called it \\"an elegant white noise... a hypnotic soundtrack to focused thought.\\"Finger, Bobby (February 25, 2017), \\"A Chat With Lesley Barber, the Composer of 2016's Best Film Score (and Why it Won't Win an Oscar)\\" .

Spindle Magazine. Retrieved April 14, 2017. Film score critic Jonathan Broxton said the music \\"dwells in the bitterness of regret\\" and that it has \\"a captivating, dream-like quality that is... dramatically appropriate for the film it accompanies.\\" The use of \\"Adagio in G minor\\" to accompany the reveal of Lee's tragedy received mixed reviews. The New Yorker said, \\"Any piece of music that has been used for Rollerball, Gallipoli, and Flashdance has, by definition, been squeezed dry.\\" Mark Kermode of the BBC said the piece \\"has been overused so much in popular entertainment that when it turns up, it's distracting.\\" According to Koresky, in the montage, \\"Lonergan thickly lays on the Handel, Bach, and Albinoni, making this sequence almost surreally operatic in its horror.\\" In an interview, Lonergan said he originally used the piece as a stand-in track while editing and decided to keep it in. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ruled the film's score ineligible for Oscar consideration due to the volume of music from classical composers in the soundtrack. In a statement Barber released to Variety, she said, \\"While I accept the Academy‚Äôs decision, I also support my director's decision to use these pieces and I'm also very proud of the substantial contribution that the original score made to the film as well.\\" Soundtrack All music was written by Lesley Barber unless otherwise noted.

It was written by the poet Su Hui to her husband. It consists of a 29 by 29 grid of characters, which can be read in different ways to form roughly 3,000 smaller rhyming poems.Hinton, 108 The outer border forms a single circular poem, thought to be both the first and the longest of its kind. Description The Star Gauge consists of 841 characters in a grid. The original was described by contemporary sources as shuttle-woven on brocade. It was composed by Su Hui during a time when the Three-Treatise School was the predominant philosophical school in the area.Chan, 357 The outer border is meant to be read in a circle. The grid is known as a palindrome poem, and can be read in different ways to generate over 3,000 shorter poems, in which the second line of every couplet rhymes with that of the next.Hinton, 108 The largest set of such poems are 2,848 four-liners with seven characters per line. In the image below, the maroon grid is made up of 32 seven-character phrases. These may be read in certain patterns around the perimeter, and in other patterns for the internal grid.Hinton, 108 Other poems can be formed by reading characters from the other colored sections. A Simplified Chinese reduction, and the original, of Su Hui's Xuanji Tu palindrome poem.  History of the poem and its retelling  A xuanji, a jade disc with a serrated edge, used as an astronomical tool, is mentioned in the title of the Star Gauge. A star gauge was a spherical instrument used to calculate and predict the motion of planets and stars. Early sources focused on the circular poem composing the outer border of the grid, consisting of 112 characters. Later sources described the whole grid of 840 characters (not counting the central character , meaning \\"heart\\", which lends meaning to the whole but is not part of any of the smaller poems). The text of the poem was circulated continuously in medieval China and was never lost, but during the Song Dynasty it became scarce. The 112 character version was included in early sources. The earliest surviving excerpts of the entire grid version date from a 10th-century text by Li Fang. By the Tang period, the following story about the poem was current: > Dou Tao of Qinzhou was exiled to the desert, away from his wife Lady Su. > Upon departure from Su, Dou swore that he would not marry another person. > However, as soon as he arrived in the desert region, he married someone. > Lady Su composed a circular poem, wove it into a piece of brocade, and sent > it to him.Wang, 51 Another source, naming the poem as Xuanji Tu (Picture of the Turning Sphere), claims that the grid as a whole was a palindromic poem comprehensible only to Dou (which would explain why none of the Tang sources reprinted it), and that when he read it, he left his desert wife and returned to Su Hui.Wang, 52 Some 13th century copies were attributed to famous women of the Song Dynasty, but falsely so.Wang, 80‚Äì81 The poem was also mentioned in the story Flowers in the Mirror.

Campaign History Organization The 122nd Illinois was organized at Camp Palmer, Carlinville, Illinois, in August 1862, by Colonel John I. Rinaker, and was mustered into the service of the United States 4 September 1862, with 960 enlisted men.Illinois Adjutant General's Report 122nd Illinois Infantry Regiment History. . Accessed 2015-03-25. Archived 2015-03-30. The Regiment remained in camp and was drilled until 8 October, and was then ordered and moved to Columbus, Kentucky. Upon its arrival at that post, it was ordered to go at once to Trenton, Tennessee, and report to General G. M. Dodge. The Regiment arrived at Trenton on 12 October and relieved the First Kansas Infantry, Colonel George W. Deitzler. Colonel Rinaker was assigned to the command of the post, and troops at that place, consisting of the One Hundred and Twenty-second Illinois Infantry, Seventh Tennessee Cavalry, Colonel Isaac R. Hawkins commanding; Fourth Illinois Cavalry, and Captain Sparstroms Battery, Second Illinois Artillery. The Regiment continued on duty at Trenton till 12 November 1862, when Colonel Rinaker was ordered to take the right wing of the Regiment, companies A, D, and F, and proceed to Humboldt, Tennessee, and relieve the Eighty-first Illinois Infantry, and to take command of the post and troops remaining there, consisting of four companies: Fifty-fourth Illinois Infantry, a part of Fourth Illinois Cavalry, Seventh Wisconsin Battery. This order was at once executed. The remainder of the Regiment was left at Trenton under command of Lieutenant Colonel J. F. Drish. The force at Humboldt was to hold the Mobile and Ohio Railroad from Trenton to Jackson, Tennessee, and guard the ordnance, commissary and quartermaster's supplies stored at that place. This service was performed until 18 December, when the Regiment moved to Jackson to aid in defense of that place against an impending attack thereon by heavy forces of cavalry under lieutenant general Nathan Bedford Forrest. From Jackson, the One Hundred and Twenty-second Regiment, with the Forty-third and Sixty-first Illinois, moved out on 19 December, and had a skirmish with the enemy that day and moved on out to Lexington, Tennessee, and returned to Jackson on 21 December. Thence moved to Trenton on the 23d of December, and the same night marched in obedience to orders to a point near Humboldt, to protect a force repairing Mobile and Ohio Railroad, which had just been destroyed by rebel cavalry. During the time that the Regiment had been about Jackson, the rebel cavalry under Forrest had captured the hospital at Trenton, and had made prisoners of the sick and the guards on duty at Trenton, by which the One Hundred and Twenty-second for the time being lost Major James F. Chapman and Captain B. Cowan, W. W. Freeman, Regimental Quartermaster, and 60 enlisted men taken prisoner. Battle of Parker's Cross Roads On 27 December, nine companies of the One Hundred and Twenty-second, nine companies of Thirty-ninth Iowa Infantry, Fiftieth Indiana Infantry, and a part of Seventh Wisconsin Battery, with three pieces of artillery, and 40 men of Eighteenth Illinois Infantry, the latter mounted, whole under command of Colonel Cyrus L. Dunham, Fiftieth Indiana, marched from Trenton to head off the cavalry force under Forrest then moving back from near Columbus, Kentucky, toward the Tennessee River. Moved by way of Huntingdon, Tennessee, and on 30 December a skirmish occurred with the enemy, and on 31 December 1862, at about 11 A.M., the One Hundred and Twenty-second and Fiftieth Indiana and the 40 men of the Eighteenth Illinois Infantry, and a part of the Seventh Wisconsin Battery, constituting a force of 1,540 men, engaged in battle with the enemy under Forrest, numbering over 6,000 men with eighteen pieces of artillery. The fight continued till about 2 o‚Äôclock P.M., when the enemy fell back leaving the field in possession of the little force that had fought them for nearly three hours, and had during that time captured eight pieces of artillery and 500 prisoners, among them Major Strange, Forrest's Adjutant General. The loss of the One Hundred and Twenty-second Regiment in killed were 22 enlisted and 1 officer, Lieutenant Bristow, in wounded 56 enlisted men and 2 officers, Colonel Rinaker, who received a severe wound in his right leg, and Captain William B. Dugger; one man missing, making a total loss of 80 men. On 31 January 1863, the Regiment returned to Trenton, Tennessee, and remained there on duty till 17 February, when it moved to Corinth, Mississippi, and was assigned to the First Brigade, Second Division, XVI Corps, Colonel Mersy, of Ninth Illinois, commanding Brigade, General Sweeney commanding Division; General Dodge commanding left wing of the XVI Corps. The Brigade was composed of Ninth, Twelfth, Sixty-sixth and One Hundred and Twenty-second Illinois, and Eighty-first Ohio Infantry. Battle of Paducah From 15 to 25 April, the Regiment took part in expedition to Major Strange, and was engaged with a rebel force at Town Creek, Alabama. The Regiment was there commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Drish. 25 June, Mersy's Brigade was put in charge of Memphis and Charleston Railroad, from Corinth, Mississippi, to Grand Junction. The One Hundred and Twenty-second had that part from Middleton, Tennessee, to Grand Junction: headquarters of the One Hundred and Twenty-second at Saulsbury, Tennessee. During the ensuing months till 30 October 1863, the men were constantly on duty and often engaged in skirmishes with cavalry forces of the enemy threatening the railroad. Colonel Rinaker was in command of the post at Saulsbury and of the forces at that post, consisting of a part of One Hundred and Twenty-second Regiment, the Eleventh Illinois Cavalry and the Seventh Tennessee Cavalry. On 30 October, the Regiment moved from Saulsbury to Corinth, thence on 1 November, to Iuka, Mississippi. Colonel Rinaker was assigned to the command of post. On 5 November, the Regiment moved with the rest of the right wing, XVI Corps, to Eastport, Mississippi. At that point the One Hundred and Twenty-second was left in charge of that place. A depot of supplies was established there. Colonel Rinaker was assigned to the command of the post and troops, consisting of the First New Jersey Cavalry, Thirty-fourth and Thirty-fifth New Jersey Infantry, and Seventeenth and One Hundred and Seventy-eighth New York Regiment of Infantry. The Regiment remained at Eastport till 8 December 1863, when it moved to Paducah, Kentucky, and thence on 19 January 1864, to Cairo, Illinois, Colonel Rinaker being assigned to the command of the post. On 24 March 1864, a considerable rebel force under Forrest attacked Paducah, and three companies of the One Hundred and Twenty- second, E, H and K, took part in the defense, and aided in repelling the enemy in the three several assaults they made on Fort Anderson at that place. 26 June 1864, the Regiment after the defeat of Sturgis at Guntown, Mississippi, was ordered to join the command of General A. J. Smith, then at LaGrange, Tennessee. Smith's command at that time was the right wing of the XVI Corps. The Regiment proceeded via Memphis, Tennessee, and on the 3d of July 1864, reported to General A. J. Smith at LaGrange, and was assigned to the First Brigade, Second Division. On 4 July, the command started on the march for Okolona, Mississippi, for the purpose of attacking the force then concentrating at that place under the command of Lieutenant General S. D. Lee, of the Confederate army. Cavalry skirmishing took place every day. The march was long, toilsome, the weather was hot; many cases of sun stroke occurred. Battle of Tupelo On the 11th the command reached Pontotoc, Mississippi, remained there till the 13th. Then the Regiment with the rest of the command marched to the village of Tupelo, and thus turned the right flank of the fortified position of the rebels in front of Okolona, compelling them to come out and attack us at Tupelo. On 14 July, about 9 o‚Äôclock A.M., the enemy, under General S. D. Lee, came forward in fine style and attacked General Smith's command posted in the rear of a crest of a ridge fronted by an open field, across which the rebels had to come. The One Hundred and Twenty-second was stationed with its right just covering the road leading into Tupelo. As the enemy advanced across the open plain, covered by a heavy artillery fire, the One Hundred and Twenty-second and the rest of the Brigade moved forward from the opposite side, and met the enemy just at the crest of the ridge, and opened a destructive fire upon them with such effect that their ranks were shattered and the whole force driven back with heavy loss in men and officers. Three times the assault was repeated and repulsed with equally disastrous results to the rebel force. At about 2 P.M., the enemy discomfited, withdrew, leaving the Union forces masters of the field, and in possession of the rebel dead. The loss of the One Hundred Twenty-second were 10 killed and 33 wounded. Among the killed was Captain Burrough, of Company K. Lieutenant J. M. Valentine, of Company A, was severely wounded. The Regiment with the rest of the command returned to Memphis on the 23d of July 1864. Again on 4 August the Regiment marched from Memphis, with the rest of General Smith's command, for Holly Springs, where after being detained a few days, the force moved on to Oxford, Mississippi. Near Abbeville they had a skirmish with the enemy without serious results to the Regiment. Reached Oxford only to find that the enemy had fallen back still farther. Thence marched back to Memphis, reaching there on 31 August. On 8 September, took boats for Cairo, Illinois Thence to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. Thence marched to Ironton, Missouri., to meet a rebel force under General Sterling Price. The foxy old fellow turned aside and we had to return, and thence march into Western Missouri, in the vain attempt to meet the same rebel force. This march covered the distance of 700 miles going and returning to and from the vicinity of Kansas City. The weather was much of the time during the march, cold, and the ground rough and frozen, the shoes of the men worn out and much severe suffering was endured. Battle of Nashville Upon the return of the command to St. Louis on 18 November 1864, the men were supplied with new shoes and clothing. Then the command of General A. J. Smith was ordered to go to the defense of Nashville, Tennessee. This command then consisted of three Divisions of Infantry, and was called the \\"Detachment Army of the Tennessee\\". The One Hundred and Twenty-second Regiment proceeded to Nashville, where, on 15 and 16 December 1864, it took part in the battle of Nashville, capturing four pieces of artillery and a battle flag from the enemy; and losing in killed and wounded 26 men. The conduct of the Regiment in this battle was commended specially in the report of General Garrard, the Division command. The Regiment was commanded in the battle by Lieutenant Colonel James F. Drish. The Regiment took part in the pursuit of General Hood‚Äôs Army from Nashville to Eastport, Miss. Thence on 18 February with residue of the Detachment of the Army of the Tennessee, under General A. J. Smith, proceeded to New Orleans, Louisiana, arriving there on the --- of February. At that place other troops were added to the command, and it became thenceforth the SVI Corps, Army of the Tennessee. Battle of Fort Blakely On 6 March the One Hundred and Twenty-second Regiment with the One Hundred and Nineteenth Illinois, Twenty-first Missouri Infantry, Eighty-ninth Indiana, constituting First Brigade, Second Division, XVI Army Corps, and Fifty-eighth Illinois, under command of Colonel Rinaker, went by ocean steamer to Dauphin Island, Alabama, near mouth of Mobile Bay. On the 23d of March, moved thence with the rest of the XVI Corps to assist in the investment of rebel fortifications at Blakely and Spanish Fort, these constituting the eastern defenses of Mobile. And on 9 April 1865, it occupied the center of the line formed by the First Brigade, General Garrard's Division, XVI Corps of the Army of the Tennessee, in the assault upon the rebel works at Blakely, and materially aided in capturing that place. The Brigade captured 10 pieces of artillery and the rebel General's headquarters, a number of rebel flags, and several hundreds of prisoners, among them Generals Liddell and Thomas and their staff officers. The Regiment was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Drish, who was seriously wounded by a piece of shell. The loss of the Regiment was 20 men killed and wounded. Colonel Rinaker commanded the Brigade in the charge as he had done for a considerable time previous thereto. The Regiment with the rest of the XVI Corps on 12 April, left Blakely and marched thence to Montgomery, Alabama, arriving there on the 26th of that month. Muster Out On 5 June, the Regiment returned to Mobile, Alabama, and on 15 July it was mustered out, and proceeded thence to Springfield, Illinois, where it was paid off and finally discharged at Camp Butler on 4 August 1865. Colonel John I Rinaker promoted brevet brigadier general 13 March 1865, for meritorious service. Total strength and casualties Regiment lost during service 2 Officers and 38 Enlisted men killed and mortally wounded and 121 Enlisted men by disease. Total 161.

The film, a short feature, may be the first fiction film to depict the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Motion Picture Story Magazine (September 1913) published a story version of the screenplay by Henry Albert Phillips. Plot Paul Girard Sr. is horrified to learn that his son, Paul Jr. has fallen in love with Dora Sims, the daughter of his business partner. Upon learning that his son and Dora have married Paul cuts his son off and breaks his business dealings with Sims. Paul Jr. goes to work with his father in law, but unbeknownst to him his father buys shares in the company intending to ruin the company at an opportune moment. Years later after learning that his father is about to sell the shares, Paul Jr. acquiesces to his wishes and temporarily departs from his wife and two children. Paul's boat is shipwrecked and he is presumed dead. A grief-stricken Paul Sr. puts off selling the shares. However an earthquake hits the city killing Sims and destroying his business. Dora sets to work providing for her family but her daughter falls ill. Coming across a picture of his grandchildren, Paul Sr. is moved and asks his friend Pearce to hunt down the children and tell their mother he is willing to take care of them. Hearing the offer Dora is appalled and refuses, only to relent when she realizes how sick her daughter is. The children are taken to their grandfathers where they are spoiled with all the toys and clothes they could want. Overwhelmed Paul Sr. asks Pearce to recommend a governess for him. Pearce advises Dora to disguise herself, which she does, and she goes to work as a governess for her children where she is very well received. Meanwhile, Paul, who managed to survive the wreck of his ship, learns that no one has heard of his wife and children and they are presumed dead. Returning home he goes to see Pearce who brings him to his father. Seeing that her husband has returned Dora reveals her true identity and is welcomed into the family by Paul Sr. who has now had the opportunity to see what a wonderful mother she is.

Most of his work and research focused on perception, with much of it involving the perception of color. His first published work was his doctoral dissertation on Gestalt psychology, which was published in the American Journal of Psychology in 1925 and 1926. Every year at Kansas State University, a graduate student receives the Harry Helson Award recognition of excellence in scholarship and research in cognitive psychology.  Early life and education  Harry Helson was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Helson's parents separated, and he lived with his mother from birth until the age of ten in Chelsea, and then New Bedford, Massachusetts. Because of her ill health, Helson went to live with his father for a year, after which he left to live with his mother's friends until he was an adult.Helson , H. (1967). Harry Helson. In E. G. Boring D. Lindzey (Eds.), A history of psychology in autobiography (pp. 193-220). New York: Appleton- Century-Crofts. Helson struggled with disciplinary issues in school; with the help of a teacher, he began serious studying in ninth grade and took part in extra-curricular activities. Helson attended Bowdoin College, a private, liberal arts school in Brunswick, Maine where he studied philosophy and psychology. Helson worked as a reporter for the college's newspaper and played the violin to fund his schooling. After earning an undergraduate degree at Bowdoin College, Helson attended Harvard University, planning a doctorate in philosophy, but changed his concentration to psychology by his second year after being introduced to Gestalt psychology. Helson wrote his dissertation on a critical review of Gestalt psychology, and received his Ph.D. in 1924.Bevan, W. (1979). Harry Helson: 1898-1977. The American Journal of Psychology, 92(1), 153-160. Career Helson's doctoral dissertation from his time at Harvard University was published in the American Journal of Psychology in 1925 and 1926 and served as an introduction of Gestalt psychology in America, because most of the original research on Gestalt psychology was in German. Helson joined the staff of Kansas State University. There he developed his adaptive- level theory of cognition. Helson also developed the principle of color conversion after working on photography in a darkroom. Although the lighting in the darkroom was red, Helson noticed that the end of his cigarette was green in color. This set off his interest in color conversion and resulted in ten years of experimentation that he would do on the topic. Helson died on October 13, 1977 in Berkeley, California.  The Adaptation-Level Theory  Helson developed the adaptation-level theory of psychology. This theory states that an individual's basis of judgment of a stimulus is based on their prior experiences as well as their recollections of how they perceived similar stimuli in the past.Adaptation-Level Theory. In Oxford Reference. Retrieved from http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095350211. It is a theory used to interpret psychological findings, and it is still used today.Masin, S. C. (1999). Harry Helson, what did you do? In P. R. Killeen & W. R. Uttal (Eds.), Proceedings of the fifteenth annual meeting of the International Society for Psychophysics, Tempe, AZ: International Society for Psychophysics (pp. 302-307). Helson asserted that adaptation levels vary from person to person and in different situations. The adaptation-level theory can be applied to attitudes, sounds, light, and many other concepts, although it began with Helson's experiments involving vision. Helson noticed that stimuli sometimes appeared to be without color when they were in monochromatic lighting, and the way the stimuli was viewed depended on the background. This finding led him to his recognition of how adaptation levels work in vision.  The Harry Helson Award  The Harry Helson Award is given out every year to a graduate student at Kansas State University, where Helson was a professor from 1961 to 1968. The award is given to honor and remember Helson's contributions while at Kansas State University. The award was created by one of Helson's graduate students at the University, Dr. Lloyd Avant. Helson's son, Henry Helson, a retired professor from the University of California Berkeley, is a supporter of this award. The award is presented to a graduate student based on excellence in scholarship and research.The Harry Helson Award.

The band is primarily a desert rock / stoner rock band but over the years, it has ventured into doom, punk rock, experimental, and garage rock. The Huskeys also started their own record label called Dali's Llama Records and have released fourteen Dali's Llama albums, in addition to numerous side projects and solo albums.  Before Dali's Llama  Zach Huskey's early bands were The Sciotics (with Sean Wheeler), Blue Sunday, Cloudy Daze and The Next. All featured Tony Brown from Unsound on drums. In 1986, Huskey graduated from high school then moved to Los Angeles. There, he formed the band Long, Dead and Gone. The band performed for the most part in Los Angeles and collaborated with some punk and metal bands. Occasionally, the band travelled back to the desert to play at a club or a generator party. When Long, Dead and Gone disbanded, Huskey formed a very heavy de-tuned rock band called My Pain. My Pain played with Wool, White Zombie, Rage Against The Machine and The Obsessed. When My Pain disbanded, the Huskeys returned to the desert.  History of Dali's Llama  In 1993, Zach and Erica Huskey formed Dalai's llama after they returned from Los Angeles. In the same year, after creating Dali's Llama Records they self-released the band's first CD, Pre Post Now. Bruce Fessier of The Desert Sun said, \\"Zach Huskey has been an integral player on the desert rock scene since the days of the generator parties in the late 1980s and early '90s. His tuned-down guitar sounds epitomize desert rock as surely as the music of Kyuss, Fatso Jetson and House of Broken Promises. You can hear Huskey's hard rock sound on the many Dali's Llama albums he's produced on his own independent label.\\"Fessier B. Zach Huskey hicks up Dunebilly The Desert Sun June 30, 2014. The following year, Dali's Llama released their second CD entitled Creative Space which took an artistically more aggressive turn. The song Listen was later featured in the 2010 movie I‚Äôm not like that no more featuring Paul Rodriguez and Felipe Esparanza. The band's lineup for both of these early CDs was Zach Huskey (songwriter/vocals/guitar), Erica Huskey (bass) and Johnnie Moreno (drums). The band performed at entertainment venues in Los Angeles, San Diego, and the desert area, including the Rhythm and Brews club owned by Mario and Larry Lalli. Dali's Llama performed with many bands, including Unsound, Well Strung to Hang, Solarfeast, Super Fun Happy Slide, Polyphemus and Sort of Quartet and opened for artists, such as Robin Trower. In 1994, the drummer, Ian Dye replaced Johnnie Moreno. In 1995, Dali's Llama released a third CD, Being. Both ‚ÄúCreative Space‚Äù and ‚ÄúBeing‚Äù were produced by Steve Kravac and recorded at West Beach Recorders, Los Angeles, a studio owned by Brett Gurewitz, guitarist for Bad Religion. Sophia Possidon of Flipside said, \\"\\"Be This Moment\\" impressed from the first ten seconds, as being a serious yet catchy rock tune.\\" After Being, Zach Huskey took the band artistically in a different direction. He wrote songs using elements of his avant-garde compositions. The band had a new drummer, George Rubacava and a second guitar player, Eric Overton. The new experimental improvisational songs were recorded live at a rehearsal in 1995 but were not released until 2001 on The Color Of Apples CD. Phil Lieberts, a musician and composer said, \\"Most jam sessions are far more fun to play than to hear. This is an exception. This collective improvisation really works. What sets it apart is a sense of swing and dynamics. Something special was created out of a void that day in ÃÅ95. There is substance here. Pay close attention. This difficult music is quite rewarding. How much you hear in it depends on your attention span. Happy accidents abound. There is a refreshing lack of nihilistic overkill. (Still, mello it ain ÃÅt.) Hey, call it No Wave blues (with a smile). Give it the good hard listen it deserves - it will never happen again.\\" In 2005, after pursuing other projects (including Primordial Blues) and solo projects, Dali's Llama released a fifth CD, Chordata. Huskey incorporated influences from The Stooges, X, The Cult, MC5 and early 70s Who. He also incorporated elements of the heavy rock sound of Wolfmother and the lyricism of Bad Religion. Alfredo Hernandez said, \\"Way before Kyuss or Queens of the Stone Age, Dali‚Äôs Llama frontman Zach Huskey was a musician to be reckoned with. Today‚Äôs Dali‚Äôs Llama are punchy, powerful and to the point. Dali‚Äôs Llama is one of the best desert rock bands today and the best live desert rock band around!\\" In 2006, Eric Overton left the band. Zach Huskey wrote some slower tempo songs, tuned down, heavy, slow, and sludgy. The Dali Llama's sixth CD, Sweet Sludge was recorded at The Sanctuary and produced by Scott Reeder. Scott Reeder said, \\"They were out here a few weeks ago - tracked and mixed it in only four days! It was good to hang out again with my old pal Zach Huskey, who‚Äôs been a stalwart of the desert music scene since our high school days together. Along with his wife/bassist Erica and drummer Robin, Dali‚Äôs Llama have been working hard - hardcore DIY, and in it for all the right reasons - for the pure joy of making music. Zach‚Äôs always-thought- inspiring lyrics, coupled with epic song structures, are tossed off as if it‚Äôs no big deal. After a few listens, a deep appreciation develops for the love that goes into what they do together.\\" Around this time Dali's Llama performed with Fatso Jetson, Dixie Witch, Sasquatch, House of Broken Promises, SuperGiant, Floating Goat, Putanesca (Joe Baiza's band). They appeared at festivals such as the Stoner Hands of Doom Festival (SHoD VIII) in Mesa, Arizona. The Dali Llama's seventh CD, Full on Dunes presented heavier, thicker, and faster songs. It blended the band's desert punk and heavy rock roots. Jeff Howe, drummer, joined the band. Some of the Huskey's high school friends performed as guests on the CD. They included Mario Lalli (Fatso Jetson, Yawning Man and Desert Sessions), Sean Wheeler (Throw Rag, Sun Trash and Charley Horse), Joe Dillon (from Hot Beat Pussy Fiend) and Scott Reeder.Dali‚Äôs Llama - Full On Dunes Earthdog Hellride.com March 15, 2009 Mike Frame said, \\"Here is another album full of top-notch stoner/desert rock from this great band. This is some of the best of this style in a decade!\\"Dali's Llama, Full On Dunes Razorcake website The band's next CD was entitled Raw is Real. Joe Dillon performed as a second guitarist. Again, the CD was recorded at The Sanctuary with Scott Reeder. This CD had a darker, heavier and angrier sound. The Obelisk website commented, \\"Raw is Real definitely lives up to its name, more ideologically than sonically. It sounds clean but there is a cynical bite to the lyrics of songs like Theocracy and the punkish Grump that, political or not, adds thematic heft.\\"Dali‚Äôs Llama Keep it Raw, Also Real The Obelisk November 24, 2009 The band's 2010 CD, Howl do you Do? was a lighthearted detour for the band with a live unpolished sixties psychedelia sound. It incorporated a garage element and raw blues with hints of The Sonics, Music Machine, Nuggets, The Yardbirds, Fuzztones and The Damned. A new drummer, Craig Brown joined the band and Mikael Jacobson, also the producer, played the organ. It was recorded at Audio Grande studios. Jay Snider said, \\"Nothing wrong with a little trip to the chemistry lab! \\"Howl do you do?\\" is an experiment that works. Not as much of a departure from the band's sound as I expected (riffs are still the trail boss on this wagon train), but the quicker, catchier song structures, heavy organ interplay, and the more jammed- out feel of the material sure do show another side to Dali's Llama.\\"Dali‚Äôs Llama ‚Äì Howl do you do? Hell Rider Music website August 22, 2010. After releasing a CD each year for five years, Dali‚Äôs Llama released Zach Huskey's side project, a heavy sounding CD called Warts and All with a band formed with the name, Ogressa. The line up of the band was Zach Huskey, Trent Ramseyer (vocals), Ian Dye (drums), Mike Jacobson (bass), Scott Reeder (bass) and Joe Dillon (second guitar on some tracks). In 2012, Dali‚Äôs Llama released the album Autumn Woods with influences from doom metal. Joe Wangler, a new second guitarist joined the band. This album was recorded in two and a half days at The Sanctuary. Scott Reeder again engineered and produced the album. Ed and Sally on Doommantia website commented, \\"After so many years together and with so much music recorded already, it is remarkable that Dali's Llama have still yet to make a wrong turn in their recording career.\\"Dali's Llama - Autumn Woods Doomantia website December 19, 2012 Celebrating 20 years together, Dali's Llama released an anthology of some of their better known songs up to that point. \\"...it is a lovingly curated eight song LP that represents the last five years of the band...

Inspired by the atmospheric sounds of bands like Rammstein, Depeche Mode and Deathstars, Rublood created their ownunique mix and a new method to conceive dark and poetic music. One of the band‚Äôs strengths, on the live scene, are the choreographies created by their dancers, the Rubladies, who delight the audience with their magnificent gothic spectacle. In October 2013 they released their first full-length Star Vampire through Bakerteam Records.

January 1944) was a Filipino physician, epidemiologist, guerrilla sympathizer, and martyr. He is best known for providing aid to the Philippine guerrillas in his capacity as Dean of the UST College of Medicinehttp://medicine.ust.edu.ph/about-ustfms/  List of Deans, UST Faculty of Medicine and Surgery during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines ‚Äì an act which led his capture and presumed death at the hands of the occupying forces just before the liberation of Manila. Prior to his term as Dean, he was already notable for having been an early president of the Manila Medical Society (now known as the Philippine Medical Association), and as the first editor in chief of the UST Journal of Medicine.  Service during World War II  Dr. Mencias had been appointed Dean of the College of Medicine at the University of Santo Tomas in 1936, and continued in that capacity when war broke out in December 1941 and when the Japanese forces firmed up their occupation of the Philippines in 1942. Throughout this time and the period of guerrilla resistance which followed, Dr. Mencias aided the resistance by secretly treating wounded guerillas and soldiers, both Filipino and American.  Personal life  Bonifacio Lopez Mencias was born on May 14, 1888, in Villasis, Pangasinan. He graduated from Colegio de San Juan de Letran and was an active alumnus who once served on the 1939 Alumni Board. He was married to Barbara Sacro of Batac, Ilocos Norte, and had six children: Rosario, Eleno, Pilar, Margarita, Bernardita, and Ramon. He bought a parcel of land in San Juan, Rizal, in the 1930s, on the corner of P. Guevarra and A. Luna streets, and raised his family there.  Disappearance and presumed death  When the Japanese Kempeitai (military police) arrested a nephew of Dr. Mencias' who they suspected of being involved with the guerillas, they found Dr. Mencias' identification card in his possession. Dr. Mencias, already suspected to be one of the underground anti-Japanese guerillas preparing for the coming of the American liberation forces, was picked up by the Kempeitai in late January 1944, and was never heard from again. Dr. Mencias is presumed to have been taken to Fort Santiago and then killed. Some accounts of the event specify that Dr. Mencias was beheaded by the Japanese. His body was never found.  Legacy  Norberto V. Ramos, who served as UST's University Registrar from 1930 to 1980 recounts in his book detailing the history of UST: > \\"The UST community laments Dean Mencias' demise especially because of the > way he died. He was a devoted administrator... Those of us who knew him and > had the opportunity to work with him at the University will always remember > him as a kind and simple man, deeply religious; and above all, he was never > found wanting in the conduct of his public relations.\\" Luna Mencias Street, a national road traversing the boundaries of and connecting the cities of San Juan and Mandaluyong in Metro Manila, is partly named after Dr. Mencias. The street had originally been named A Luna Street, after General Antonio Luna of the Philippine revolution. After the second world war, it was renamed in honor of Dr. Mencias.

It is located within the Mount Aspiring National Park, south of Mount Aspiring / Tititea. The glacier covers the steep slopes of the mountains surrounding the head of the Rob Roy Valley. The most prominent part of the glacier is on the northwestern side of the valley on the slopes below the tall Rob Roy Peak. This part of the glacier extends from just below Rob Roy Peak down to a bench high on the valley's side where it abruptly breaks over the cliff's edge at around . The glacier covers most of the headwalls encircling the valley, except the eastern side where the bordering peaks are all just below . The spring melt causes frequent small avalanches, and seracs breaking off the glacier's terminal face on the northwestern side of the valley. Bigger blocks of ice can tumble and crash all the way to the valley floor.Information panel at the lookout at the end of the Rob Roy Valley Track, Department of Conservation NZ  History  In the distant past, Rob Roy Glacier extended not only to fill all of the Rob Roy Valley, but flowed into the large Matukituki Glacier at the peak of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago. The Matukituki Glacier later combined with the Wanaka Glacier, also non-existent anymore, to form a continuous river of ice all the way down the Clutha Valley to close to where Cromwell is now. Now all that remains of Rob Roy Glacier is a hanging glacier at the valley head. The Rob Roy Valley leading out into the Matukituki Valley is now covered with lush beech forest and an open understory of ferns and mosses. The forest supports small birds such as fantail, tomtit and rifleman, while above the tree line kea can be heard and seen regularly. Rob Roy Peak was named after Scottish hero Rob Roy MacGregor when the first Europeans began exploring this area and began farming in the Matukituki Valley in the 1870s. Tourism Rob Roy Glacier has a history of attracting expeditions and tourists for over 100 years. Since the 1920s, access across Mt Aspiring Station into Mount Aspiring National Park has been allowed by four generations of the Aspinall family. The Rob Roy Valley Track is a popular walk of 3-4 hours return and leads to a sub-alpine basin at the valley head and a lookout across the valley to Rob Roy Glacier. Apart from the drive to get there, it is the most easily accessible glacier in the region. About 20,000 people visit Rob Roy Glacier per year. The walking track starts at the Raspberry Creek car park and shelter at the end of the Wanaka Mount Aspiring Road, which is unsealed for the last and a \\"fine weather only\\" road for the very last 10 kilometres, crossing seven fords. The track starts off on farmland and then crosses the Matukituki River via a swing bridge before following Rob Roy Stream to climb Information panel at Matukituki River swing bridge, Department of Conservation NZ up into the Rob Roy Valley. The end point is a lookout just above the tree line overlooking the valley head and across the valley to Rob Roy Glacier dramatically breaking over the rock ledge towering high above on the other side of the valley. 261m tall snowfall (freezing Rob Roy Falls) Avalanches and ice blocks breaking off the glacier's terminal face are a regular sight in spring, and kea can often be heard and seen flying above. Also clearly visible are the tall Rob Roy Falls, free- falling down a sheer cliff face south of Rob Roy Glacier. On cold sunny days, the meltwater from the glacier and snow on the sunlit slopes above can re- freeze as it falls through the cold air in the shade of the cliff, depositing again as ice and snow at the base of the waterfall. The walking track is publicly accessible for independent walking, but can also be done as part of a guided tour from Wanaka. A regular shuttle service for trampers is also available, as Raspberry Creek shelter is also the start of longer hiking trails into Mount Aspiring National Park. In 2015, wingsuit flier David Walden leapt from a cliff at the top of Rob Roy Low Peak (2560 m) and was the first person to fly over Rob Roy Glacier and into the valley below via BASE jumping.

The British Chancellor of the Exchequer and Defence Minister are assassinated. The British Government receives a demand for GBP 12 million to stop the killings. Carter is assigned to assist in the investigation. He is contacted by Augie Fergus ‚Äì an antiques smuggler in Egypt ‚Äì who claims to have information about the assassinations. Fergus is killed before he can pass on the information. Carter contacts Hadiya, Fergus's stepdaughter in Tunisia, who has been authorized to pass on the information in the event of Fergus' death. The information comprises a photograph of Fergus's British Army commando unit in Cairo, 1942. British intelligence identifies the men in the photograph. The only person of significance is Lieutenant John Elmore who became a renowned underworld assassin after the war before being killed in a shootout with police several years previously ‚Äì although his body was never found. Instead, British intelligence links the assassinations to a Russian agent, Boris Novosty, who is currently in the UK. Carter is briefed by the head of Special Operations Executive (SOE) and is assigned a young female agent (Heather York) to assist him. Carter and York are sent to Penzance, Cornwall the location of Novosty‚Äôs last known sighting. They trace Novosty to a farmhouse near Land's End. Novosty escapes after a gunfight but leaves evidence behind that leads to a cottage in Lower Slaughter in the Cotswolds. Carter and York lie in wait for Novosty and his agents inside his cottage. Under interrogation, the Russians reveal that they know nothing of the assassinations. They are trying to steal Ministry of Defence missile blueprints. Returning to London, Carter and York are assigned to protect other senior Cabinet officials. The Foreign Secretary is murdered in his office and Carter almost catches the killer. A note on the body demands GBP 14 million to be sent to Geneva by private plane. The Government prepares to pay the demand. A clue left in the Foreign Secretary's office leads to Jupiter Motors a failing car factory in London. The boss, Elmo Jupiter, is discovered to be Lieutenant John Elmore. Carter and York are captured by Jupiter's henchmen and driven to a large estate near Beaconsfield where they are imprisoned. Jupiter informs them that his ransom has not been paid and that he will kill the Prime Minister in revenge. Carter and York escape and return to London. Carter and York search the rooms where a high- level ministerial meeting will be held expecting Jupiter to infiltrate and assassinate the Prime Minister. Carter spots suspicious activity on the rooftop of a building opposite and goes to investigate. Jupiter is preparing to launch a rocket attack on the meeting.

It is a relatively modern dish, dating to sometime after the introduction of the tomato to Iran at the end of the nineteenth century. Its primary ingredients are cucumber, tomato, onion, olive oil, herbal spices and verjuice, although lime juice is sometimes used in its preparation. In Iran, it is eaten in the summer as a side dish on its own, and year-round as a side dish alongside meat-based foods such as kebab or steak, and as a side dish before and after meals. Shirazi salad is sometimes served as an accompaniment to rice. Cookbook author Jila Dana-Haeri describes it as a refreshing dish during the summer. Shirazi salad has been described as being akin to a national salad in Iran, and it is a common meal accompaniment. It may also be used in a manner similar to that of a condiment, to reduce the spiciness of stews. It typically has a crisp and moist texture, and is somewhat similar to pico de gallo and Israeli salad. Ingredients Iraniain loobia polo (green bean cooked with rice) and Shirazi salad The primary ingredients of Shirazi salad consist of small, finely-diced cucumber, tomato and onion, which is mixed with verjuice (or sometimes fresh lemon or lime juice) and some dried mint. Olive oil, salt, and pepper may be used, and additional ingredients may include chopped mint, parsley, scallions, dill, sumac, and red vinegar. The salad may have a sour and salty flavor, and its flavor may increase after being set for an hour or longer before serving, which allows time for the flavors to intermingle.

Structure  The 32-line poem is divided into 8 stanzas of 4 lines each. Each stanza follows an \\"AABB\\" rhyme scheme. ‚ÄúA Cradle Song‚Äù follows a couplet structure where each pair of lines rhyme. This lends the poem a graceful sound and makes it easy to sing. While writing this poem, Blake drew from the image of a mother sitting over her infant while the baby is in her crib falling sleep. Background Blake was born in London on November 28, 1757. He died on August 12, 1827. \\"Cradle Song.\\" Poets.org. Academy of American Poets, n.d. Web. 29 Mar. 2015. He claimed that in a dream his brother Robert taught him the printing method that he used in Songs of Innocence and other illuminated works. Songs of Innocence includes poems about children and the clash between the corruption of the world and the innocence of youth. He uses imagery throughout Songs of Innocence. Paraphrase In ‚ÄúA Cradle Song‚Äù, a mother sings to her child, asking the infant to stay asleep. The mother asks her child to sleep through the night. While she looks at her infant's face, the mother sees Jesus. When she sees the infant smiling, she sees Jesus smiling at her and the world. At the end of the poem, she states how heaven and earth are at peace and have harmony when she sees her baby smile. Analysis A key theme in ‚ÄúA Cradle Song‚Äù is the mother's love for her child. The mother uses the word ‚Äúsweet‚Äù ten times in the poem. She makes the infant seem angelic by the way she describes the child. The mother claims her child is ‚Äúdovelike‚Äù, using the dove as a symbol for holiness and love. The woman ties the spiritual world to the physical. She notes how she can trace His (Christ's) holy image on her baby. The mother tells the baby to sleep as she cries, representing how the mother is aware of the sinful world her baby will grow up and eventually die in. She claims how Jesus wept for all and wept for her. The mother has faith that her infant will be okay even when she can no longer protect her, but it still saddens her to not be able to shield her from the world. In music There are famous artists that have claimed that they were inspired by William Blake, including Bob Dylan, John Lennon, and The Beatles, Bono and U2, Led Zeppelin, and many more.Burch, Michael R. \\"William Blake: Influence and References in Popular Culture.\\" William Blake: Influence and References in Popular Culture.

Lhuillier Jewelers F.C. was a football club based in Cebu City. The team was known for winning the 1988 PFF National Championship. The Jewelers were the first and only Cebu-based team to win at a national football championship. History The M. Lhuillier Jewelers was formed in 1987 after Cebuano businessman Michel Lhuillier gathered a group of local-based players reinforced by Australian Graeme Mackinnon, Dipolog-resident Albert Regencia, and Jordanian Mike Ahmad. Locals were given academic scholarships by the club's team sponsor. 1988 PFF National Championship The Jewelers participated at the 1988 PFF National Championship then known as the Andres Soriano Memorial Cup as the youngest team in the tournament with an average player age of 22 with most players still in college. Rene Maambong and Edwin Arganza were the youngest at age 17 and playing head coach Graeme Mackinnon was the oldest then at 42 years old. The club played against five other teams. The team was guided by Australian playing coach, Graeme Mackinnon. The Jewelers played four games in the elimination round and managed to place among the top two teams to advance to the finals. The tournament was only contested by five teams due to a typhoon. The team had a scoreless draw with Dumaguete in their first match then won over Negros Occidental-Bacolod 1‚Äì0 in their second game courtesy of Mario Ceniza's lone goal. The team also won over Philippine Navy with the same scoreline where Randy Estremos scored a goal for the Jewelers and goalkeeper Gemini Sitoy saved a penalty. The team scored a much-needed draw with Iloilo, 0‚Äì0 to face against Victorias Milling Company of Bacolod, Negros Occidental in the finals. The finals against Victorias Milling which was held on November 11, 1988 at the Santa Barbara pitch in Iloilo ended in a penalty shoot out after a nil-nil draw to determine the champions of the tournament. There was a lack of lighting and the shootout was delayed due to the crowd entering the field. After the police restored order to the Jewelers won the penalty shootout. Jeweler goalkeeper, Gemini Sitoy was awarded Most Valuable Player of the tournament who ended as the only goalkeeper in the tournament that did not conceded a single goal in the tournament. The 1988 squad later was inducted into the Cebu Sports Hall of Fame as a Special Honoree. Post 1988 The Jewelers again reached the finals of the National Championship at least two times. The team lost to Dumaguete F.C. in the 1990 edition and to the Philippine Navy to 1991. The scoreline of the latter final was 0‚Äì1.

A fourth German victim was shot and killed when he refused to climb into the kidnappers' truck. A unit of the Al-Qaeda's North African branch: al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) abducted the three from a restaurant in Timbuktu, Mali. Because McGown has dual citizenship, South African & British, the group offered a trade to the British Government for Abu Qatada who was to be deported to Jordan, where he had been convicted of involvement in militant plots. Following the kidnapping, several videos were released of the three, offered as proof of life. Rijke was rescued by French forces in April 2015. Gustafsson was released in June 2017, and McGown was released in August 2017.  Sjaak Rijke  Sjaak Rijke () is a Dutch national who was held hostage by a faction of Al Qaeda in the Maghreb region in Mali since 25 November 2011 with Stephen Malcolm McGown from South Africa and Johan Gustafsson from Sweden. He was liberated by French special forces in the north of Mali on 6 April 2015.  Abduction  Rijke, who worked as a train driver in his native the Netherlands, was taken hostage in Timbuktu in northern Mali on 25 November 2011, together with McGown and Gustafsson. They were all in Mali as tourists, despite the recent unrest and insurgencies in the region. Rijke's wife managed to escape the attack by hiding from the perpetrators. A German tourist who refused to cooperate with the attackers was killed at the scene. Rijke, McGown and Gustafsson were subsequently taken to an undisclosed hiding place. After his hostage taking, the Government of the Netherlands issued a negative travel advice for the northern part of Mali.  Aftermath  In a video posted on YouTube on 12 July 2012, Rijke said he had been captured by Al Qaeda and that he was treated well. One month later, in August 2012, Arabic TV news broadcaster Al Jazeera broadcast a report in which Rijke and the other two hostages were featured, urging their respective governments to negotiate with Al Qaeda for their release. In September 2013, almost two years after the kidnapping, AQIM released a video in which Rijke called upon the Dutch government \\"not to forget about him\\". The video was probably recorded in June 2013. It was the first sign of Rijke or any of the other hostages since French military actions in Mali in January 2013 when Islamist radicals had threatened to capture Mali's capital Bamako. On 21 August 2014, on social media the case of Sjaak Rijke caught slight attention with the hashtag #FreeSjaak, commemorating 1000 days of captivity. In November 2014, AQIM released another video in which Rijke addresses the Dutch government and his family. He says he is in pain and in a difficult security situation, and asks in an emotional way to please help him. The video was made on 26 September 2014, according to Rijke. Rijke ultimately survived the kidnapping, having been rescued by soldiers of the BFST in April 2015. In late June 2017, Gustafsson was released and flown to Sweden. No details about the negotiations were made public at the time. In early August 2017, McGown was released and returned to South Africa. South African officials refused to comment on the terms of the negotiations, but The New York Times reported that the South African government paid ‚Ç¨3.5 million (about $4.2 million) to McGown's captors using South African charity Gift of the Givers as an intermediary.

Sivaladapis is an extinct, adapiform primate genus that belongs to the family Sivaladapidae. Two species of Sivaladapis are currently recognized, S. nagrii and S. palaeindicus. Sivaladapis is considered one of the latest surviving genera of adapiform primates, existing well into the Miocene of South Asia. Compared to other adapiform primates, the fossil record of Sivaladapis is limited, lacking any cranial or postcranial fossil material. The genus is known exclusively from isolated fossil teeth and partial dentaries and maxillae recovered from the Chinji Formation (Siwalik Group) of India and Pakistan. Both S. nagrii and S. palaeindicus are considered a fairly large adapiforms, with body-size estimates ranging from 2.6 to 3.4 kilograms. The prominent and well-developed shearing crests on its molars and premolars suggests the genus was adapted to a predominately folivorous diet, subsisting on fibrous leaves. It has been hypothesized that the extinction of Sivaladapis around 8 million years ago was the result of the immigration of leaf-eating colobine monkeys to South Asia, where they directly competed with Sivaladapis. Etymology Sival- refers to the Middle Siwalik deposits of the Indian subcontinent, -adapis referring to the type genus of Aadapiformes. History of discovery and identification The fossiliferous Siwalik deposits of India and Pakistan have been known to paleontologists for decades, producing a plethora of vertebrate fossils since the early 20th Century. In 1932, British paleontologist Guy E. Pilgrim described what he identified as a procyonid carnivore partial dentary collected from Lower Siwalik deposits of Pakistan, naming it Sivanasua palaeindica. In his description, he identified a maximum of two lower molars, which informed his identification of the fossil as having procyonid affinities. Shortly after Pilgrim's description, G.E. Lewis of the Yale Peabody Museum recovered a single lower molar from the Nargi horizon in Middle Siwalik deposits of India. He recognized the morphology of the isolated tooth as having lorisid primate affinity and named it Indraloris lulli; however, he lacked sufficient fossil material to make adequate anatomical comparisons or place it systematically. In the 1960s, Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History recognized the similarity in morphology shared between Sivanasua and Indraloris. Additional fossil material of Sivanasua recovered from Middle Siwalik deposits of India in the 1970s allowed for more direct comparison of Indraloris and Sivanasua. These additional fossils demonstrated that the dental formula of Sivanasua included a maximum of three lower molars, not two as Pilgrim had initially described; a diagnostic feature of procyonid carnivores is the loss of M3, resulting in a lower dental formula including only 2 lower molars. Moreover, additional Indraloris material lacked key synapomorphies aligning it with lorisid primates (e.g., a toothcomb), which pointed to an adapiform affinity instead. Thus, the additional fossils and subsequent anatomical comparisons demonstrated that 1) Sivanasua was not a procyonid carnivore, but rather showed adapiform affinities, and 2) the Sivanasua and Indraloris are closely related but represent two distinct adapiform genera. Acknowledging its adapiform affinities, Gingerich and Sahni renamed the previously identified Sivanasua material as Sivaladapis and recognized two distinct species ‚Äì S. nagrii (formerly Sivanasua nagrii) and S. palaeindicus (formerly Sivanasua palaeindica). Taxonomy In the same year that Gingerich and Sahni recognized the two species of Sivaladapis, Thomas and Verma placed S. narigii, S. palaeindicus, and the species belonging to the genus Indraloris in their own subfamily, Sivaladapinae, which was later promoted to the family level, Sivaladapidae. Gingerich and Sahni assigned S. nagrii as the type species for the genus. The holotype for S. nagrii is represented by a partial right dentary that preserves M1-M3 (GSI 18093) collected from the Middle Siwaliks Nagri formation near Haritalyangar, India. The holotype for S. palaeindicus is represented by a partial right dentary preserving P4 and M2-M3 (GSI D-224) collected from the Lower Siwaliks Chinji formation near Chinji, Pakistan. Roughly 10 million years after the mass extinction event at the Cretaceous- Paleogene boundary that eliminated many organisms, including the non-avian dinosaurs, adapiform primates appear simultaneously in the fossil record of the Holarctic along with many other mammalian lineages that rapidly evolved and diversified. Adapiform and omomyid primates are the first true primates appearing in the earliest Eocene around 55 million years ago. Within the broader adapiform radiation, Sivaladapidae represents a monophyletic group containing several genera and species with synapomorphies distinguishing them from other recognized adapiform families. Key features differentiating sivaladapids from other adapiforms include upper molar shearing crests, the twinning of the hypolconulid and entoconid on the lower molars, and a continuous lingual cingulum on the upper molars. Within Sivaladapidae, three subfamilies are currently recognized: Hoangniinae, Wailekiinae, and Sivaladapinae. While these subfamilies are distinguished by containing sivaladapid genera that exclusively share distinct morphology (inherited from a more recent common ancestor), the subfamilies also follow a general sequence of geologic age. For example, hoanghoniines are restricted to the Eocene, while the sivaladapiines are found exclusively from Miocene deposits. In 1998, Qi and Beard recovered new sivaladapid fossils from the Late Eocene Gongkang Formation in China that they named Guangxilemur, which they described as intermediate in morphology and age. In their phylogenetic analysis, Guangxilemur is recovered in an intermediate position between the Eocene hoanghoniines and the Miocene sivaldapiines. While much research has focused on resolving the evolutionary relationships within Sivaladapidae, the phylogenetic affinities within the broader adapiform radiation are still unclear. Description Derived features of Sivaladapis include the following traits. Sivaladapis has a dental formula of 2.1.3.3/2.1.3.3. The upper premolars become more molarized from front to back, and the cusps become more numerous and complex in their morphology as well. P2 is single rooted, P3 is double rooted, and P4 has three roots. The upper molars display shearing crests with a sharp ectoloph that is supported by well-developed, distinct stylar cusps that are connected via a buccal cingulum. A prominent lingual cingulum surrounds the protocone. There is no hypocone or pericone. Unlike early Eocene hoanghoniines, Sivaladapis is derived in having a fused mandible. Lower incisors are high-crowned and spatulate, and I2 is slightly larger than I1. Size differences between the few preserved lower canines in Sivaladapis suggests possible sexual dimorphism in the genus. P2 is single rooted and caniniform with a honing facet for the upper canine. P3 is double rooted with a prominent protoconid with a paracristid that orients anteriorly. Accessory crests run from the protoconid and curve at the base of the crown to short talonid. P4 is completely molarized but lacks an entoconid and has an open trigonid. The lower molars of Sivaladapis are extremely high-crowned with several prominent crests. The paraconids are reduced but crest-like, while the entoconids take on a pointed shape. Paleoecology Given its dental morphology (i.e., the upper and lower molar cusps and crests that facilitate a combination of puncturing and shearing during occlusion), it has been inferred that Sivaladapis was well-adapted to a highly folivorous diet of fibrous leaves. Moreover, the absence of the hypocone suggests that grinding was not a functional priority for Sivaladapis. Additionally, Sivaladapis fossils have been recovered in association with a gibbon-sized hominoid, suggesting the taxa inhabited a forest community. This faunal association, along with the large body size estimates and dental morphology, suggests that Sivaladapis was an arboreal folivore. Specifically, citing Kay's threshold, in which the upper limit for an insectivorous primate is around 500 grams, the body mass estimates for Sivaladapis falling between 2.6 and 3.4 kg is used as evidence to support the hypothesis that Sivaladapis was a folivore. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested more vigorously with additional fossil material.

He was born at Troyes on December 31, 1912, and died in Paris on February 21, 2006. A large part of his work was on the site of Delphi, excavated by the French School at Athens, of which he was secretary general from 1941-1948 and director from 1969-1981.  Career  He joined the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1933, become a professor in 1937, and was member of the French School at Athens from 1937 to 1941. During this time, he carried out excavations in the sanctuary of Delphi, where he discovered treasure of gold and ivory under the sacred way. The study of these objects led him to be interested in oriental art and, in general, in the relationships between occidental and oriental artistic production, notably in architecture and jewelry. From 1951 to 1969, he taught at the University of Strasbourg. His thesis on La mantique apollinienne √† Delphes (The Apollonic Divination at Delphi) refuted the romantic image of the consultation of the Pythia in favor of a more prosaic function of the Delphic oracle. He is the author of a number of articles concerning the monuments at Delphi, in particular the temple. He was elected to the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1972.

She was a departmental secretary between 2010 and 2020, across multiple departments and portfolios. Life and career Beauchamp was awarded a Bachelor of Economics from the Australian National University in 1977. Beauchamp began her Australian Public Service career as a Graduate in the Industry Commission, an agency that existed between 1990 and 1998 and was responsible for holding public inquiries and reporting on matters referred by the Government; and reporting annually on the economic performance of industry, and the effects of assistance and regulation on industry and the economy. Before 2006, Beauchamp held a number of positions in the ACT Public Service, including Deputy Chief Executive, Department of Disability, Housing and Community Services and Deputy CEO, Department of Health. Beauchamp rejoined the Australian Public Service in 2002, in the Department of Family and Community Services.

Between February and August 2009, Beauchamp was responsible for coordinating a whole of government response to the Victorian bushfires, chairing the Commonwealth Victorian Bushfire Inter- Departmental Committee. In December 2010, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard appointed Beauchamp to the position of Secretary of the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, after Beauchamp had been acting in the position since the Department was established in September 2010. In February 2011, the Australian Government nominated Beauchamp to the board of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. In February 2020 before retiring, Beauchamp destroyed her notebooks that contained meeting notes relating to the Sports rorts affair (2020).

It was first broadcast on 11 April 2015. In each episode two teams of three competed in sports knowledge rounds and physical games to achieve points for their teams, at the end the team with the most points was declared the winner. It was announced on 15 September 2017 that ITV had decided to axe the series after three series due to low ratings. The show was hosted by Holly Willoughby. One team was captained by entertainer, actor and presenter Bradley Walsh and the other team by former professional footballer Frank Lampard. Lampard was joined by comedian Romesh Ranganathan as a regular panellist. Seann Walsh, also a comedian, was the resident scorer. Former professional footballer Jimmy Bullard was the host's assistant in the first series. Willoughby promoted the third and final series as a guest on The One Show on 27/02/17. Production The show was commissioned as part of ITV's endeavour to find a panel show for their flagship channel after other pilot series had aired. The show was made by Hungry Bear Media and the executive producer was Dan Baldwin, Holly Willoughby's husband. Despite the sport theme, ITV said that they were not targeting sports fans specifically but producing the show for the whole family audience. Baldwin stated that the host's lack of sports knowledge would help viewers in the same position. Filming of each episode took place at the Fountain Studios in Wembley in front of a live studio audience. The first two episodes of the first series were recorded on 31 March 2015, the next two on 20 April, one on 27 April and the final two on 3 May. It was revealed in November 2015 that ITV had ordered a second series. Episodes for this series were recorded on 8 January, 15 January and 17 January 2016 with 2 episodes being recorded each day. Willoughby promoted the third and final series as a guest on The One Show on 27/02/17. The show's title came from the phrase used in football; the idea that players should continue with the game, even if they believe play should be stopped for any reason, until the referee has blown his whistle to halt play. In the show Willoughby blew her whistle to conclude the rounds.

Design and development The C.140 was designed in the first half of 1928 to meet a French military call for a multi-purpose aircraft that could train pilots and gunners in gunnery and in photographic and radio reconnaissance work as well as fulfilling a liaison role. It was a single bay, markedly unequal span biplane or sesquiplane. The upper wing was in three parts, with easily detachable, rectangular plan outer panels joined to a central panel which included a broad cut-out over the fuselage to enhance the upward view from the tandem cockpits. The lower wings were similar but with the lower fuselage in place of the central panel. Both wings had two drawn, rectangular section duralumin tube spars drilled for lightness, wooden ribs and round duralumin tube internal drag struts. Parallel pairs of outward-leaning interplane struts, again of round tubular duralumin, linked upper and lower wing spars aided by wire bracing. Similar parallel pairs of outward-leaning cabane struts joined the central panel to the upper fuselage longerons. There was no stagger or dihedral. The C.140 was powered by an uncowled Salmson 9AB nine cylinder radial engine, mounted on duralumin bearers. In the case of a fire, the fuel tank could be jettisoned in flight. Behind the engine the fuselage was of mixed construction and a deep oval in section, with multiple longitudinal members. The pilot sat in the forward, open cockpit under the rear of the wing with the observer was close behind, about half way to the tail where there was a shallow triangular fin with a parallel edged rudder with a tip continuing the upper fin line and a lower edge reaching to the keel. The small tailplane was rectangular in plan and carried larger area, overhanging balanced elevators with a small cut-out for rudder movement. The C.140 had a tail skid undercarriage with its main wheels on a single axle, sprung to two sets of steel V-struts from the lower wing root. For gunnery training the pilot had a camera-gun and the observer a pair of Lewis machine guns. The observer also had a wide angle camera for photographic reconnaissance and radio equipment for immediate reporting. The C.140 was equipped for night flying. The C.140 first flew in the summer of 1928. It did not go into series production.

The Mk 3A of 1961 proved to be the only challengers to Cooper and Lotus in that year. A total of eight Mk 3As were built in addition to the one prototype Mk 3. Mk 4 & Mk 4A The Gemini Mk 4 was developed in 1962. The car was of advanced design and featured inboard suspension, inboard brakes and two small radiators on each side of the car.ML Twight, The World's Racing Cars, Second Edition, 1964, page 28 It was powered by a Cosworth modified Ford engine mated to a Renault Dauphine gearbox.

Principles  The general principal of making a projection with MotionParallax3D displays The image of the object the user sees The projection of a virtual object displayed on the screen MotionParallax3D displays contain one or more flat or curved screens. These screens have different sizes, shapes, and mutual disposition depending on the form factor of the device. The projections of virtual objects are formed so that the virtual image the user sees looks exactly the same as the image that would be seen if the virtual object actually existed. In order to display the correct projections of virtual objects, the virtual reality system requires the current coordinates of the observer's eyes. In contrast with stereo displays involving only binocular vision, the MotionParallax3D displays utilize one of the most important principles of human spatial perception‚Äîmotion parallax. Motion parallax is a displacement of the parts of the image relative to each other with the angular velocity proportional to the distance difference between the parts of the image and a viewer when the relative position of the viewer and the observed object changes. The MotionParallax3D displays use this mechanism of perceiving volume by constantly changing the image displayed based on the current coordinates of the user's eyes. Due to this, the virtual objects are shifted relative to each other and relative to the visible real objects according to the laws and principles applying to the real world's objects. It allows the brain to build the a holistic view of the world containing both real and virtual objects with indistinguishable behavior. Most MotionParallax3D displays are based on stereo displays and display separate images to the left and right eyes. This gives a substantial advantage in building a complete system of virtual reality, but is not necessary for the perception of volume since the motion parallax mechanism alone is enough for the brain to perceive virtual objects as having a definite shape, volume, and a distance from the user's eyes.  Tracking systems  To make the image projection display correctly, the system requires up-to-date and exact coordinates of the user's eyes. The MotionParallax3D displays get these coordinates from the head-tracking systems. The tracking systems for MotionParallax3D displays can be based on different principles: * Optical: ** Based on active markers (NettleBox) ** Based on passive markers (EON ICube) ** Based on face, eye, head contour etc. recognition (Amazon Fire Phone) * Ultrasonic (RUCAP UM-5) * Electromagnetic * Mechanical * Mixed, combining several tracking mechanisms e.g. using gyroscopes and accelerometers in addition to optical markers.  Quality indicators  The quality of MotionParallax3D displays, which is mostly based on how realistically a virtual image can be displayed, is determined by a combination of three main characteristics: * Stereoscopic separation quality (if it is done) * Rendering quality * Geometric accuracy of the projection. Stereoscopic separation quality decreases due to ghosting ‚Äì a phenomenon where each eye, in addition to the image intended for it, perceives the image intended for the other eye. Ghosting can be caused by different factors, e.g. luminophore afterglow in plasma screens or the incomplete matching of the polarization direction during polarization stereoscopic separation. Rendering quality is generally not a problem for modern MotionParallax3D displays, however, the high detalization of rendering and the use of special effects allow psychological mechanisms for volume perception such as texture gradient, shading, etc. and they help increase the reality of the perception. The geometric accuracy of the projection of 3D-scenes is the most important indicator of MotionParallax3D display quality. It is influenced by the accuracy of the head-tracking and the interval between the moment when the tracking starts and the moment when the image is displayed. Tracking accuracy affects the accuracy of the projection. The architecture and geometry of the tracking devices, quality of calibration, and the integrated value of inaccuracy, which is affected by noise, can all contribute to a reduction in projection correctness. The interval between when the user's head-tracking starts, and when the image is displayed, is the primary cause of geometric incorrectness of 3D-scenes projection in MotionParallax3D systems. Latency occurs because operations such as head- tracking, rendering and displaying the projection require time. Modern MotionParallax3D displays use head-tracking forecast technology that compensates for the delay partially, but the accuracy and the forecast horizon are highly dependent on the quality of the initial data (accuracy) and also the quantity of the datasets with the user's position coordinates that the system receives per time unit. The peculiarity of visual perception is that the brain interprets the latency of virtual object images not as latency but as a distortion of the geometry of virtual objects. In this case, the dissonance between the information the user receives from the visual perception and the vestibular apparatus can cause symptoms of virtual reality sickness which include nausea, headache, and ophthalmalgia (eye pain). Higher quality MotionParallax3D displays reduce the chances of these symptoms occurring. However, even in case of a perfect MotionParallax3D display, the symptoms of cybersickness can occur in susceptible individuals due to the dissonance of the focusing and convergence visual mechanisms; if a virtual object is located at a considerable distance from the surface on which the projected image is displayed, an attempt to fix the eyes and focus on the nearby virtual objects can lead to the opposite result.  The Place of MotionParallax3D displays among VR systems  NettleBox virtual reality display Currently all widely used computer virtual reality devices can be divided into two classes: * MotionParallax3D displays * HMD (head-mounted display) displays. In addition to these two classes there are other more exotic variants: e.g. the CastAR system, under development, in which the projection of the correct image onto a surface is achieved by placing the projectors directly on the glasses. However such devices are not so widespread at the moment and exist only as prototypes. Head-mounted displays usually isolate users from the real world, whereas MotionParallax3D displays allow users to keep their orientation in the environment. This also imposes restrictions on MotionParallax3D displays; since the user sees both real and virtual objects, it is necessary to make their behavior identical which is achieved by reducing latency to an acceptable level (no more than 20 ms).  Implementations  Because MotionParallax3D displays are a tracking system connected to devices that form and display the images, there are a lot of form factors with disparities in size: from the smartphones to the virtual reality rooms to full immersion systems. Below are the most common representatives of each class.

It was a part of the popular movement that overthrew dictator Jorge Ubico and began the Guatemalan Revolution. During this period, it was one of the two largest Guatemalan parties, the other being the National Renovation Party (PRN) led by teachers. In Guatemala's first democratic elections in 1944, it joined a broad coalition of revolutionary parties to support the election bid of Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo, but subsequently distanced itself from his government. In November 1945, it merged with the National Renovation Party to form the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR), but split from it eighteen months later. This split was partially the result of ideological differences, and partially the result of manipulations by Ar√©valo, who preferred to deal with a fractured opposition. During the period that it was a part of the PAR, as well as in alliance with the PRN, it enjoyed a majority in the Guatemalan Congress for the entire presidential term of Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo, and until 1949, it was the largest of the parties involved in the Guatemalan Revolution. The FPL was also the most conservative of the revolutionary parties, until 1949. In that year the party split between those who supported the presidential candidacy of Francisco Javier Arana, and those who opposed him. Arana's supporters left to form the \\"FPL Ortodoxo,\\" or the Orthodox FPL. In the 1950 election, the remainder of the FPL formally endorsed V√≠ctor Manuel Giordani, but some party members defected to support Jorge Garc√≠a Granados, another moderate civilian, while still others supported Jacobo √Årbenz, the defence minister and the administration's candidate.

Members of the genus are known as mandrakes. There are between three and five species in the genus. The one or two species found around the Mediterranean constitute the mandrake of ancient writers such as Dioscorides. Two or three further species are found eastwards into China. All are perennial herbaceous plants, with large tap-roots and leaves in the form of a rosette. Individual flowers are bell-shaped, whitish through to violet, and are followed by yellow or orange berries. Like many members of the Solanaceae, species of Mandragora contain highly biologically active alkaloids that make the plants poisonous. Their roots in particular have a long use in traditional medicine. Mandrakes are involved in many myths and superstitions. Description Species of Mandragora are perennial herbaceous plants. They have large vertical tap- roots, sometimes forked. Their stems are short or virtually absent. The leaves form a rosette at the base of the plant. The flowers are sometimes borne on a short stalk (scape), and are solitary, with whorls of five parts. The sepals are joined at the base, as are the petals, both in the shape of a lobed bell. The stamens are shorter than the petals, joined to the floral tube towards the base. The ovary has two chambers (locules). After fertilization, a yellow or orange fruit forms (botanically a berry). Taxonomy Mandragora officinarum with violet flowers The genus Mandragora was first used in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the first edition of Species Plantarum where the Mediterranean species Mandragora officinarum was described, which is thus the type species of the genus. (Linnaeus later changed his mind and in 1759 placed M. officinarum in the genus Atropa as A. mandragora.) Jackson and Berry (1979) and Ungricht et al. (1998) have documented the subsequent confusion over the number of Mediterranean species of Mandragora and their scientific names. Dioscorides was among those who distinguished between \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" mandrakes, a distinction used in 1764 when Garsault published the names Mandragora mas and Mandragora foemina. The size and shape of the fruit and the colour and time of appearance of the flowers have been used to distinguish possible species. In the 1820s, Antonio Bertoloni used flowering time to name two species as Mandragora vernalis, the spring-flowering mandrake, and Mandragora autumnalis, the autumn-flowering mandrake. Identifying the former as Linnaeus's M. officinarum, works such as Flora Europaea listed two Mediterranean species of Mandragora: M. officinarum and M. autumnalis. Using statistical analysis of morphological characters, Ungricht et al. found no distinct clusters among the specimens they examined and concluded that Linnaeus's M. officinarum is a single, variable species. Other sources divide M. officinarum sensu lato differently. Plants from the western Mediterranean, from Turkey westwards to the Iberian peninsula and Morocco, are placed in M. officinarum; plants from the eastern Mediterranean, from Syria to Israel, are placed in M. autumnalis. Classification and phylogeny Traditionally, Mandragora has been considered to be closely related to Atropa and Lycium, being grouped together in the same tribe or subtribe as at least the first of these genera. Molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that the genus belongs in the large subfamily Solanoideae, but that within this subfamily it is one of a number of isolated genera with no immediate relatives. It has thus been placed in its own tribe, Mandragoreae. Within the genus, studies have used different circumscriptions of the Mediterranean mandrakes. Two studies which separate plants found in the Levant (Mandragora autumnalis) from those found in the rest of the Mediterranean area (Mandragora officinarum) suggest that there are two clades in the genus: one based in the Mediterranean and beyond to Turkmenistan and Iran, and one in the Sino-Himalayan region. A simplified cladogram based on these studies is shown below. In one of the studies, M. chinghaiensis was embedded within M. caulescens. The Solanaceae are primarily a New World family. It is suggested that Mandragora originated around 20 million years ago, arriving in Eurasia through the agency of birds, with the main split between the species occurring around 10 million years ago. Species , major online plant databases (such as Tropicos, The Plant List, and GRIN Taxonomy for Plants) accept different numbers of species in the genus Mandragora. Three species are accepted in a 1998 review of the genus and by GRIN. Other sources keep M. autumnalis and M. chinghaiensis as separate species. *Mandragora officinarum L. and Mandragora autumnalis Bertol. Central and southern Portugal and throughout the Mediterranean area, eastwards to Syria and Jordan. Virtually stemless; petals long, greenish white through blue to violet; berry globose to ovoid, yellow to orange when ripe. M. autumnalis may be included within M. officinarum or considered a separate species. Older sources consider M. autumnalis to the main species found in the Mediterranean with M. officinarum confined to northern Italy and parts of the coast of former Yugoslavia. Some more recent sources distinguish plants found in the Levant as Mandragora autumnalis, one difference being that the seeds are more than twice as large as those of M. officinarum. *Mandragora turcomanica Mizg. Turkmenistan, Iran (Golestan Province). Stemless; petals long, violet; berry yellow, strongly aromatic. *Mandragora caulescens C.B.Clarke (including Mandragora chinghaiensis Kuang & A.M.Lu, Mandragora tibetica Grubov) India, Nepal, Bhutan and parts of China (south-east Qinghai, west Sichuan, east Xizang (Tibet), north-west Yunnan). Stems sometimes present; petals dark purple or yellow; berry globose. Considerably variable in size and appearance, possibly justifying dividing the taxon into subspecies or even species. Toxicity Atropine is a mixture of D and L isomers, the L isomer being hyoscyamine Like many members of the Solanaceae, species of Mandragora contain highly biologically active alkaloids, tropane alkaloids in particular. Hanu≈° et al. reviewed the phytochemistry of Mandragora species. More than 80 substances have been identified; their paper gives the detailed chemical structure of 37 of them. The different parts of the plant contain different proportions and concentrations of alkaloids, with the roots having the highest concentration. Alkaloids present include atropine, apoatropine, belladonnine, cuscohygrine, hyoscyamine, scopolamine (hyoscine), 3Œ±-tigloyloxytropane and 3Œ±,6Œ≤-ditigloyloxytropane. M. caulescens and M. turcomanica are also reported to contain anisodamine. Clinical reports of the effects of consumption of plants described as Mandragora autumnalis (Mandragora offinarum s.l.) include severe symptoms similar to those of atropine poisoning, including blurred vision, dilation of the pupils (mydriasis), dryness of the mouth, difficulty in urinating, dizziness, headache, vomiting, blushing and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). Hyperactivity and hallucinations also occurred in the majority of patients. Uses Mandragora species have a long use in traditional medicine, extracts being used for their real or supposed aphrodisiac, hypnotic, emetic, purgative, sedative and pain-killing effects. Tropane alkaloids are known to be effective as analgesics and anaesthetics, and can be used to increase circulation and dilate pupils, among other effects. Hyoscine and anisodamine are used medicinally in China. Continued use of M. autumnalis in folk medicine was reported in Sicily in 2014. M. caulescens (as M. chinghaiensis) has been listed as a Chinese medicinal plant needing conservation. The presence of deliriant and hallucinogenic alkaloids and the sometimes vaguely humanoid shape of their roots have led to mandrakes being associated with a variety of myths and superstitious practices throughout history. However, the plants used in this way are not always species of Mandragora; for example, bryony (Bryonia) is explicitly mentioned as the source of a \\"mandrake\\" or \\"mandragora\\" in some sources.

The trade involved over three million animals in 2011 valued at approximately A$1 billion, of which the majority were cattle and sheep. However, the live export trade only accounts for 0.4% of all Australian exports, . The export of live animals from Australia has generated some controversy, with animal rights organisations such as Animals Australia asking it to be banned on the grounds that certain countries where animals are shipped have no laws to protect them from cruelty. In 2011, the Gillard government briefly suspended the trade and came close to a ban. Exports have since resumed.  Overview  Australia exports live animals to many countries, including Indonesia, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Russia, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Iran, Bahrain, Qatar, Pakistan, Mauritius, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and China. A number of ships, mostly converted container ships, move animals from Australia to these countries.  Statistics  In 2011, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that: * 2,458,448 sheep were exported from Australia, worth $328 million * 694,429 cattle were exported, worth $629.4 million * 63,663 goats were exported, worth $8.5 million According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, exports of live sheep rose 21.4% and live calves increased 9.7% between March 2017 and March 2018. During 2017 alone, Australia exported 2.85 million living animals in shipping containers and airplanes.  Animal rights controversy  In March 2011, Animals Australia conducted an investigation of the treatment of exported Australian cattle in Indonesia. The investigation revealed animals had their throats cut while fully conscious and remained conscious for more than 30 seconds after the initial throat cut. This sparked mass protests across Australia calling for the live export trade to be banned. The sudden decision taking immediate effect by then Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig in May 2011 to ban live animal exports in response to the negative media coverage resulted in significant disruption to the livestock supply chain across northern Australia.

Because cameras were not allowed on board, this was taken as true ‚Äî until a Pakistani crew-member turned whistleblower documented the daily horrors onboard export ships, of sheep dehydrating, being crushed and even cooking alive during voyages to the Middle Eastern summer.

Redding in 1909. Acme-McCrary went on to become the third-largest producer of private label hosiery in the world, with factories in three locations. Its production assets were purchased by Sri Lanka-based MAS Capital in 2017, but Acme-McCrary retained the historic buildings in Asheboro, which by that point only housed its corporate offices.

Barnum's promotion of Jenny Lind created the need for a private railroad car The Jenny Lind private railroad car is the first specifically outfitted private railway coach. It was used on Jenny Lind's singing tour of the United States.  History  The idea of a private railroad car came out of need. P. T. Barnum brought the well known soprano singer Jenny Lind to America from Sweden for a singing concert performance tour. He did much advance publicity even before she arrived in the United States, under the Nom des artes of the \\"Swedish Nightingale.\\" Thousands of people followed her wherever she went. The newspapers coined the term \\"Lind mania\\" because of all the crowds that gather around her.Linkon, Sherry Lee. \\"Reading Lind Mania: Print Culture and the Construction of Nineteenth-Century Audiences\\", Book History, Vol. 1 (1998), pp. 94‚Äì106 She and her husband were much annoyed by the many disrespectful interviewers that wanted to know all about the newly wed couple. To solve the problem Barnum designed a special railroad car for Jenny's comfort so she could tour the nation and escape the crowds of people that wanted to speak to her. The first private railroad car ever made was then born for Jenny Lind and her 1850-52 concert tour across the United States.  Description  Barnum first purchased a normal passenger railroad car and had all of its seats removed to be remodeled for comfort as she requested into a \\"parlor car.\\" Then he had it specially designed as a private living quarters in a drawing-room style with chairs, tables, and parlor style furniture that she and her husband could temporarily live in while traveling. This way then she was able to travel on her singing performance tour from city to city privately without the intrusion of interviewers. Lind was the first person to travel in this unusual method. The private railroad car concept attracted much attention with those of up-scale expensive tastes. The wealthy then mimicked that method of travel and made their own personal private railroad coaches. The concept however was slow in developing. When it did take hold in society it eventually took further form as deluxe palace cars and dining cars. It also developed into the luxury Pullman chair car.

He was a Sterling Professor, Yale's highest level of academic rank, and served as director of the Yale Labor and Management Center from its founding in 1945 until its dissolution in the late 1950s. The author, co-author, or co-editor of thirteen books, Bakke made major contributions to the study of unemployment and organizational theory. Early life and education Bakke was born and raised in Onawa, Iowa. He was of half Norwegian and half English descent; his father worked as a shoe merchant. He went to Onawa High School where he was president of his senior class among other activities. He attended Northwestern University as an undergraduate, where he won a $2,000 national prize in oration. He graduated with a B.A. degree in philosophy in 1926. He was married to the former Mary Sterling in 1926 and they would have three children. He went on to graduate studies at Yale University, first attending Yale Divinity School during 1926‚Äì29 where, although himself a Quaker, he served as an Episcopal pastor. Under the advice of sociologist Albert Galloway Keller he switched from philosophy to social science. In 1931 he studied unemployment in the United Kingdom during the early phase of the Great Depression, living on the dole in a working-class area of Greenwich. He received his Ph.D. from Yale in 1932. Early career Bakke joined the faculty of Yale in 1932 where he became a fellow at the Jonathan Edwards College and taught sociology from 1932 to 1934. He then shifted fields and became an assistant professor of economics in 1934. He subsequently became professor of economics in 1938 then received the Sterling Professor designation in 1940. Within the interdisciplinary Yale Institute of Human Relations he was Director of Unemployment Studies during 1934‚Äì39. He was also the main social economist who consulted to the Social Security Board from 1936 to 1939. His first book, The Unemployed Man (1934), was based on his experiences in England and received praise for his research methods and for the work's depiction of the human effects of unemployment, such as in his quote from one subject: \\"With a job there is a future, without a job there is a slow death of all that makes a man ambitious, industrious and glad to live.\\" The effects highlighted also included the loss of self-esteem to men as their wives and daughters found work but they, as traditional heads of households, did not. He then conducted an eight-year study of the effects of unemployment in local New Haven, Connecticut, and published two works ‚Äì The Unemployed Worker and Citizens Without Work ‚Äì in 1940 from that study. Bakke focused not just on the economic characteristics of unemployment but also on the social and psychological consequences and costs from it. As such, Bakke became known for the sensitivity which he brought to this subject. He emphasized the distaste the unemployed often had in applying for government relief, as illustrated by quotes like \\"I'd rather be dead and buried\\" and, when another was ultimately compelled to do so, \\"I would hide my face in the ground and pound the earth.\\" The 2004 Encyclopedia of the Great Depression states that Bakke's New Haven study stands \\"as a powerful statement of the importance of stable, adequately-paying work opportunities for individual well-being, as well as broader social well-being\\" and that even given his other contributions to sociology, economics, and industrial relations, \\"Bakke's study of Depression-era unemployment remains his most influential and far-reaching work.\\" Alice O'Connor, a professor of history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in 2010 that, \\"Seventy years later, the study's analysis still resonates\\". Updated May 25, 2011. Later career During World War II, Bakke was co-chair of the National War Labor Board's appeals committee. At times during his career he also served as a consultant to the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Labor regarding foreign programs for management retraining. In 1948 during the Truman administration he was appointed to the presidential Bituminous Coal Emergency Board, invoked under the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, which within a week reported that the threat of a coal strike harmful to the public interest had been avoided. In terms of politics, Bakke characterized himself as an independent. As founding director of the Yale Labor and Management Center, Bakke's aim was to establish a scientific approach towards establishing and testing hypotheses about human actions in industrial relations and thereby establish an explanatory theory of behavior that could eventually help find ways to reduce the amount of labor-management conflict. Staging clinical working sessions between labor and management, he was able to bring representatives of both onto campus as one case of his abilities at influencing people. He was publicly passionate about the importance of the work, saying in 1946 that the survival of American democracy itself was at stake and that labor and management must work for \\"mutual survival, not separate survival.\\" Bakke's earlier work as a sociologist before being an economist constituted a varied background that led him to construct an interdisciplinary approach that was beneficial for the field of industrial relations. Much of Bakke's later career was taken up with the study of organizational theory, looking to find a theoretical approach to analysis that would explain not only behavior in businesses but also the same in other entities such as churches or schools. In books such as Bonds of Organization: An Appraisal of Corporate Human Relations (1950) he defined all activities of an organization as to falling into one of five categories: perpetuation, workflow, control, identification, and homeostasis. He devised a fusion process theory as a way of expressing how organizations, and individuals within them, accommodate divergent interests. As such, Bakke was regarding among a group of other eminent organizational theorists active in the 1950s, including Chris Argyris, James G. March, Rensis Likert, Jacob Marschak, Anatol Rapoport, and William Foote Whyte. In 1958 Bakke published a report for the center entitled \\"The Human Resources Function\\". This is credited by Georgia State University professor and industrial relations scholar Bruce E. Kaufman as being the first use of the term \\"human resources\\" in its modern form, although Bakke used in a more pervasive sense to refer to all working relationships within an organization and not just those handled by a personnel department. In addition to his role at Yale, in 1929 Bakke was one of the co-founders of the nearby Connecticut College of Commerce, subsequently holding a life position on its board of trustees and serving as chair of the board. In 1946, when it was known as the Junior College of Commerce, also served as vice president in the college's administration. He remained chair of the board in later years, by which time it was known as Quinnipiac College. In 1953 he received a Fulbright professorship to teach at Copenhagen Business School, where he also set up a pilot study in human relations research in a Danish factory. He served as president of the Industrial Relations Research Association for 1958. In 1964 he received an honorary doctor of laws degree from his alma mater of Northwestern University. His last book, about student activism in the 1960s, was written in collaboration with his wife Mary. He died at his home in Woodbridge, Connecticut, on November 23, 1971, at age sixty-eight.

History The origin of the cocktail is usually credited to Harry MacElhone at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in the 1930s as a derivative of the sidecar. However, competing theories exist that claim the cocktail was created at The Berkeley in approximately 1921, or in French brothels as an ap√©ritif for consumption by the prostitutes. Variations The drink is similar to the sidecar, differing only by using less cognac and adding rum. The Maiden's Prayer is variously known as an alternate name for the Between the Sheets, and as a different drink using gin instead of rum and cognac, and adding orange juice to the lemon juice.

Gedung Antara (\\"Antara Building\\") is a Dutch colonial landmark in Jakarta. It is located in the vicinity of Pasar Baru area. The building is currently Antara's Institute of Journalism. History Office building of Antara in 1971. The building was originally office building for ANETA (Algemeen Nieuws- en Telegraaf-Agentschap, Dutch for \\"General News and Telegraph Agency), the first news agency in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). During the Japanese occupation period, the Antara news agency, which previously occupied a building in Buitentijgerstraat (now Jalan Pinangsia No. 30, Kota), changed its name into Yashima and moved to the building where ANETA was. Yashima changed name again into Domei. The building was considered an important landmark in Indonesian history. After the Indonesian declaration of independence by Sukarno, Adam Malik broadcast the message through Antara radio without passing the Japanese censorship Hondokan. At the time of the first Dutch Military Aggression (1947) after the expulsion of Japan from Indonesia, the Dutch offered the building to Apotheek Van Gorkom until 1961, when it was reused by Antara news agency again. Later, the building was used for Antara's Institute of Journalism (Lembaga Pendidikan Jurnalistik Antara) while the rear side of the building was used for the printing of internal purpose. On April 4, 1959, the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture Wiyono announced the building as Jakarta's heritage building. Architecture A miniature of the building featured in 1923 Pasar Gambir fair. The building was designed in tropical Art Deco. It has a clock face and two prominent towers with lightning rod. The two meter main door is made of iron. Concrete stairs covered in brown ceramic tiles connect the building's three floors. Currently the building deteriorates. With no proper pruning of the surrounding trees, the facade is no longer prominent.

Life See He was born on 2 May 1874 in Accrington in Lancashire, the only son of James Ashworth. He spent most of his early life in Burnley, attending the Carlton Road School there. He appears to have befriended Dr James MacKenzie during his youth, due to MacKenzie's role as the family GP, and his interest in science was awakened. MacKenzie appears to have had a mentoring role during his teenage years. Ashworth was encouraged to train, and went to Manchester to study Chemistry at Owen's College. Here he quickly found a new interest and changed to study Zoology. He then moved to London University where he received a BSc with Honours in Zoology and Botany in 1895. In 1899 he received a Doctorate in the same subject. He obtained a post in Naples in Italy where his interests began to focus upon marine biology. In 1901 he became a lecturer in invertebrate zoology at the University of Edinburgh. In 1905, under his own guidance, the University began a course training for a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Ashworth created the elements focussing upon entomology and parasitology. The course was extended to provide Diplomas in both Public Health and Tropical Veterinary Medicine. In 1909 he was awarded a new chair of Professor of Invertebrate Zoology while Professor James Cossar Ewart continued as the Professor of Vertebrate Zoology. When Ewart retired in 1927 Ashworth succeeded him taking over the overarching chair of Professor of Natural History. With financial help from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1929 he established a major new building on the University's Kings Buildings campus, thereafter known as the Ashworth Laboratories. He died at home on Grange Loan in Edinburgh on 4 February 1936, aged 61. Recognition The Ashworth Building, King's Buildings In 1911 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1917 a Fellow of the Royal Society. The RSE awarded him its Keith Prize 1913-15. From 1923 to 1926, and again 1930 to 1933, he served as Vice President to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and from 1933 until his death in 1936 he served as their General Secretary. The National Portrait Gallery in London hold a print (1931) of Ashworth taken by Walter Stoneman. The Ashworth Building in Edinburgh University's King's Buildings complex is named in his honour. Family He married Clara Hough in 1901 shortly before coming to Edinburgh.

It stars Richard J. Danum and Gillian MacGregor as a married couple who attempt to make their relationship work during the approach of a potentially catastrophic asteroid. It premiered at the Sci-Fi- London film festival on 24 April 2014.  Plot  As Cole shops, an armed robber demands that the cashier, Michael, hand over all the money in the safe. Michael empties the cash register and says that there is no safe in the shop. As the robber becomes increasingly agitated, Cole approaches him, calls him a coward, and dares the robber to shoot him. Michael intercedes and attempts to wrestle the gun away from the robber, only to be shot in the gut. After Cole calls an ambulance, he receives a phone call from a friend who invites him out to drinks. Cole accepts on the condition that it is not a house party. Cole is frustrated to learn that it is a house party, and he goes downstairs to drink alone, where he meets Maya, the host. The two discuss an approaching asteroid. Maya says that modern stress would evaporate in the face of the meaninglessness of certain doom, and Cole says that everything would matter in that circumstance. The two dance to Maya's favorite song and soon begin dating. A series of flashforwards depict life in post-apocalyptic Scotland after the asteroid has arrived as Cole and Maya hide from alien spaceships, mixed with scenes in the present of their relationship leading up to those events. When they discuss children, Cole says he does not want any, and Maya reveals she is incapable. As the asteroid grows closer, Cole asks Maya to marry him. Maya jokingly accepts, and Cole insists that he is serious; now serious, Maya again agrees. Although initially dismissive of the danger, scientists become increasingly worried about a collision. Various missions to divert the asteroid end in failure, putting the world on edge. In the flashforwards, Cole and Maya's relationship deteriorates in the face of their hardship in finding food and shelter. When Maya becomes pregnant, Cole is taken aback and insists that it is cruel to have children in the face of an impending disaster. Maya says that it is a miracle for her to become pregnant, and she keeps the baby despite Cole's insistence that they discuss abortion. In the flashforwards, Cole and Maya's baby is in the care of Maya's parents, and their relationship has become strained over the issue. Cole accuses Maya of blaming him for their hardships and not supporting him, while Maya counters that it is his own self-loathing that is driving them apart. In desperation, they resort to eating baby food they had agreed to save. In the present, Michael expresses his dissatisfaction with Cole's refusal to accept responsibility for his wife's pregnancy. In a flashforward, Maya and Cole encounter a survivor by the name of Keith Novac. Novac explains his theory that the aliens have come to purge Earth of overpopulation and leave it a better place for the survivors. He demonstrates his attempts to contact the aliens, and Cole tells Keith that their missing child is in the care of Maya's parents, whom they suspect to have fled the country. Novac suddenly sneak attacks them both, and the film shifts back to the present time, when Cole and Maya have separated over his opposition to her pregnancy. Maya, who is about to give birth, invites Cole to the hospital. When Cole arrives, Michael confronts him with a pistol and says that Cole has betrayed his own beliefs. In the face of certain death, Michael says that Cole has abdicated all responsibility and treats his life as meaningless. Envious of the potential for hope in Cole's life, Michael shoots him. Novac, a doctor, rushes from the hospital, shoots Michael, and works to save Cole's life. As Cole begins to slip into delirium from his wound, he apparently imagines the various scenes in the flashforwards based on the actions of Novac and Michael. Maya calls Cole on his mobile phone and tells him that the asteroid has missed Earth, and she has given birth to a baby girl. The film ends as Cole lies on a hospital bed, Maya beside him.

Release  Beyond premiered at Sci-Fi-London on 24 April 2014. Due to the film's ending, there was debate as to whether it qualified as science fiction, though it was ultimately allowed to play at the festival. Kaleidoscope Home Entertainment released it on DVD in the UK on 12 January 2015.  Reception  Dominic Cuthbert of Starburst rated it 7/10 stars and called it \\"a low budget treat continuing in the Great British indie tradition.\\" Jeremy Aspinall of Radio Times rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that science fiction fans may be disappointed by the low-key, low-budget focus on a relatable relationship drama. Alex Fitch of Electric Sheep Magazine called it \\"a great new Scottish genre movie\\" that seems like a response to Once. Kevan Farrow of Scream magazine rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Bleak, involving and daring in its restraint, Beyond is perhaps best served as a character- driven drama as opposed to an alien invasion flick. [...] A more likeable and relatable Cole would have made this one a real winner, but tolerate his po- faced gloom and apparent conservatism and you'll be rewarded with a meditative and thoughtful piece of cinema.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:2014 films Category:2014 romantic drama films Category:2010s science fiction films Category:British films Category:British independent films Category:British romantic drama films Category:British science fiction films Category:English-language films Category:Post-apocalyptic films Category:Films set in Scotland Category:Films shot in Scotland Category:2014 drama films Category:2014 independent films ","title":"Beyond (2014 film)"},{"id":"46222896","text":"Janice Parker (born 13 November 1937) is an Australian former cricket player.

Docwra's forces operated out of Derry in alliance with local Gaelic forces opposed to the rebel Earl of Tyrone. Following the Treaty of Mellifont he was appointed to command Culmore Fort an important strategic post close to Derry. Later career In 1608 Sir Cahir O'Doherty launched a rebellion from Burt Castle. O'Doherty had served on the Crown's side during the recent war, and was a natural loyalist, but had been angered at his treatment by Docwra's replacement as Governor of Derry, George Paulet. O'Doherty and Hart were friends, and the night before the rising he invited him and his wife to dinner. O'Doherty then took Hart prisoner and captured Culmore. He used the fort's arsenal to arm his followers.Bardon p.102 O'Doherty then followed up his seizure of Culmore with the Burning of Derry. O'Doherty was subsequently defeated and killed at the Battle of Kilmacrennan and the rebellion collapsed.McCavitt p.136-48 Despite his loss of Culmore, Hart was rewarded as a servitor like other veteran officers.

Early life and farming Generally known simply as \\"Frank Reitz\\", he was born at his family's home on the Heerengracht in Cape Town. He was baptised \\"Francis William\\" only after his parents' chosen name for him (Fran√ßois Guillaume) was rejected by the English Chaplain for sounding too French. He was schooled locally at the Riebeek Instituut, before studying agriculture in Scotland and travelling widely in Europe. He travelled and studied from Scotland to Italy and Germany, over several years, attaining a vast wealth of knowledge and experience - especially in the sciences. Returning to the Cape, he started farming in 1835 at the farm Rhenosterfontein near Swellendam. He was generally more theoretical than practical in his interests, but he was enormously influential in his writing of academic papers on farming as well as starting book clubs and agricultural societies. He also edited journals and gave lectures on agricultural topics, and remained the centre of organised Cape agriculture for most of the remainder of his life. When Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan) founded Het Zuid-Afrikaansche Tijdschrift in 1878, Reitz was unsurprisingly invited to serve as co-editor. Reitz was a close, like-long friend of Dr Henry White, the community's resident doctor who resided at the \\"Klein Huis\\" (the current farm dwelling) on Reitz's Rhenosterfontein estate and also served as a Member of Parliament. Dr White and Frank Reitz were described as a well-known, characterful duo, \\"lovably Dickensian in their ways and appearance\\", prone to \\"parish-pump preoccupation\\", and with a kindly, inclusive approach to all in the community. E.H. Burrows: Overberg Outspan. Maskew Miller. 1952. pp. 164-5. Political career Conflict with the government He was initially only attracted to politics due to the \\"Convict agitation\\" of 1849, where he represented communities of the Overberg region. He first served on the early, weak & nominal Legislative Council from 6 September 1850, when he was elected, together with Andries Stockenstr√∂m, Christoffel Brand and John Fairbairn. The Governor Harry Smith however installed a puppet member, the pro-imperialist Robert Godlonton, as a means of influencing the council. The four \\"popular\\" members attempted to amend the constitution but, being obstructed, they resigned en masse, and drew up the famous \\"Sixteen Articles\\" as the proposed democratic constitution for the country. These were conveyed to London, and a long controversy ensued. Legislative Council (1854-63) When the Cape attained its first real parliament in 1854, Reitz was elected to represent the Western half of the country (which was at the time divided into two \\"Provinces\\"). He served for almost ten years. He became a strong supporter of the \\"Voluntarist\\" movement (separation of Church & State) and of the \\"Responsible government\\" movement (greater democratic independence from Britain) - two allied movements led by Saul Solomon and John Molteno respectively. This made him a hated figure by the clergy and the imperialist establishment, and he gained a reputation as a radical. He was nonetheless extremely popular among ordinary voters of all races. Financial set-backs caused him to withdraw from politics in 1863. He also sold his farm and moved to \\"Kliprivier\\" in Swellendam. Legislative Assembly (1869-73) He was an enormously popular and well-known figure in the Swellendam region, and he was consequently persuaded to stand for election for the Legislative Assembly (lower house), representing his Swellendam District. He continued his support for Voluntarism & Responsible Government, in the lower house now, until both movements finally triumphed. He was also known as a strong advocate for a country-wide irrigation system. He was not a confident public speaker though, and greatly disliked political debates. Upon the successful attainment of Responsible Government, he retired from politics for the second time. He was an extremely popular figure in parliament and his colleagues offered him a title \\"Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod\\" so that he would be able to remain in contact and involved in parliament, even without having political power.Dictionary of South African biography, Vol. 2. 1972. Character and family He was described as a studious and scholarly man with extremely broad, liberal and tolerant views, on everything from religion to race. In 1832 he had married Cornelia Deneys, and the couple had 12 children. His son, Francis William Reitz Jr., was an influential politician and later President of the Orange Free State.

On his return to Italy he was promoted to major general and briefly commanded the \\"Brescia\\" brigade. Before the outbreak of World War I he was director general of personnel at the Ministry of War. Alfieri became Minister of Defence on October 30, 1917, when Vittorio Emanuele Orlando became Prime Minister.John Gooch, The Italian Army and the First World War, Armies of the Great War, Cambridge: Cambridge University, 2014, , p. 362. He knew Armando Diaz from his days at the War College, and urged his appointment as the new field commander to replace Luigi Cadorna following the defeat at Caporetto. He also modernized and improved armaments and organization in the Italian Army. His term as war minister ended on March 20, 1918; since a decisive attack by the Central Powers was feared, he decided to leave politics and return to duty at the front, where he commanded the 26th Army Corps. He contracted the Spanish flu and developed pneumonia; he died on November 8, 1918, shortly after learning that his men had been victorious at Trieste and the war was won.

With an estimated construction date of the 1810s, it is one of the oldest barns in the area, and is architecturally rare as an example of a gambrel-roof barn built using older framing methods associated with traditional English barns. The barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The barn is set on the east side of East Pond Road, on a large parcel of land opposite number 462, in the rural central interior Maine community of Smithfield. This land was probably first settled in 1810 by Benjamin Stevens. Stevens transferred the land, with his \\"homestead farm\\", to Oliver Stevens in 1853. Based on architectural evidence, it is likely that the barn was built early in Stevens' ownership of the property. After several ownership transfers, the land was owned for much of the first half of the 20th century by members of the Kromberg family. The barn is set close to (within about ) the roadway, and is oriented with its gambreled gable roof perpendicular to the road. It measures about , and is set on a foundation of piled fieldstones. Its walls are clad in wooden shingles, and most of its roof is corrugated metal; one steep side has wooden shingles. It is topped by a small louvered cupola with a metal roof, weathervane, and spire. The front facade has a main opening, which has a pair of vertical-board sliding doors, large enough to admit a laden wagon. There are small square windows on either side, and a pedestrian entrance at the far right. At the second level there are two sash windows, with a single sash at the third level near the gable peak. The interior of the barn has three aisles, separating areas used for different functions. The main framing of the barn is hand-hewn timbers with posts that have a gunstock shape, and are connected to transverse beams via plates. This construction method, more normally found in older (or traditionally-built) English barns, is relatively rare in Maine's gambrel- roofed barns, most of which were built later in the 19th or early 20th centuries. This building's gambrel roof is a conventional frame construction that probably replaced the original gable roof in the 1920s during a major renovation that also relocated the posts of the center aisle.

A child receives oral polio vaccine in 1967 in West Germany. Polio (Infantile paralysis or poliomyelitis) epidemics were a concern during the summer months for children globally, with records of polio from the Egyptians and Greeks to the 1950s epidemics. Two U.S. virologists, Jonas Salk of the University of Pittsburgh and Albert B. Sabin of the University of Cincinnati emerged as the most prominent among dozens of American researchers on the quest for a polio vaccine. Salk's vaccine By 1950, Jonas Salk had tested both live attenuated polio vaccines and formaldehyde-killed polio vaccines in monkeys and by 1952, began testing on humans. The killed vaccine, with proper filtration of the biological culture, was found to be effective.Rhodes 2013, p. 133. A problem with this vaccine was the perception that to be adequately protected; a child needed three properly spaced injections and a recommended booster shot every year, which was expensive.Oshinsky 2005, p. 256. However, Jonas Salk stated in interviews that this perception was not true. The Salk vaccine was the first polio vaccine to receive approval of the U.S. government and was used in the United States until 1961, when the Sabin vaccine was recommended to replace it.Rhodes 2013, p. 136.Swanson 2012, p. 67. Sabin's vaccine Albert Sabin, a virologist who publicly disagreed with Salk and his killed vaccine, worked on creating a vaccine with live attenuated vaccines. In January 1956, despite Cold War tensions, Mikhail Chumakov, the director of Moscow's Polio Research Institute, along with his wife virologist Marina Voroshilova, and his colleague Anatoli Smorodentsev, traveled to the U.S. in order to study the Salk vaccine. They also visited the laboratory of Albert Sabin.Swanson 2012, p. 68 With the clearance of the FBI, Sabin flew to Leningrad in June 1956. As a result of the cooperation between Sabin and Chumakov, Sabin was able to test his attenuated vaccine in the USSR when funding in America became unavailable. Sabin's work behind the Iron Curtain led to the determination that the Sabin‚ÄìChumakov vaccine was safe and effective.Rhodes 2013, p. 135 Cold war tensions Cold War tensions caused Western scientists to discount reports from the Russians about the effectiveness of the Sabin vaccine.Swanson 2012, p. 69 However, mass vaccinations of Sabin's vaccine spread throughout Eastern Europe from 1960 to 1963. Just as some Soviet virologists did not trust the American Salk vaccine, Americans had similar reservations about the Sabin vaccine.Vargha 2014, p. 338. However, other Soviet virologists argued that the Salk vaccine could be considered safe because the Americans had tested it on their own people,Vargha 2014, p. 336. and that the Sabin vaccine must be potentially dangerous because the Americans did not want to test it on their own society. Federal licensing The documented achievement of the Sabin‚ÄìChumakov collaboration eventually overcame the ideological differences of the Cold War. Their oral live-virus vaccine became federally licensed in 1962, and was used for over three decades to help eliminate polio globally, replacing the Salk vaccine. Using these vaccines, the threat of polio remains a serious threat only in parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.

Early years Tommy Fallot was born on 4 October 1844 in Fouday, Bas-Rhin. His grandfather was Daniel Legrand (1783‚Äì1859), an industrialist and Christian in Ban de la Roche, Alsace who felt that the gospel message was primarily for the poor and unfortunate, despite their suffering. Fallot earn a doctorate in theology in Strasbourg in 1872. His thesis was on \\"The Poor and the Gospel\\". He spent four years as Lutheran pastor of Wildersbach, near the Ban de la Roche. He then left the Lutheran church and moved to Paris, where the Free Church had offered him a position. Evangelist Tommy Fallot was pastor at the Chapelle du Nord, a church of the Reformed Church of France (√âglise R√©form√©e de France) on the rue des Petits-H√¥tels in Paris. From there he led a program of evangelization among the working people. He was influenced by the work of the English clergyman Robert Whitaker McAll, who held \\"moral conferences\\" to carry the message of the Gospel to the poorest people. This followed the R√©veil movement that had earlier swept 19th century Europe. Fallot founded the French League for the Rehabilitation of Public Morality (Ligue pour le rel√®vement de la moralit√© publique), which gained widespread support in Paris and the provinces. By 1878 the future feminist Jeanne Schmahl had become active in Fallot's League, which was mainly concerned with abolition of alcohol and pornography. From 1882 Fallot also addressed the issue of prostitution. This was the outcome of a meeting with Josephine Butler (1828‚Äì1906), who was undertaking a campaign in England against this scourge. Fallot began to adhere to socialist ideas, although condemning class warfare preached by leaders who \\"dream of revenge and conquest\\". Fallot founded the Cercle socialiste de la libre pens√©e chr√©tienne, which in 1882 became the Soci√©t√© d‚Äôaide fraternelle et d‚Äô√©tudes sociales. In 1887 Fallot and the economist Charles Gide founded the Protestant Association for Practical Study of Social Questions (Association protestante pour l'√©tude pratique des questions sociales). The association considered the social impact of industrialization from the perspective of liberal economics. It took the view that these impacts were unavoidable and had to be treated on a case by case basis. The association published the Journal of Practical Christianity (Revue du Christianisme pratique). Fallot is considered to be the founder of the French \\"Social Christianity\\" movement. Fallot's was concerned with the future of the church. His nephew and disciple Marc Boegner, quoted him as saying \\"The church will be catholic or will not be; the Christian will be protestant or will disappear... I henceforth consider myself a catholic Protestant.\\" Fallot used the word \\"catholic\\" in the broad sense that the Anglicans use it, rather than as a synonym for Roman Catholic as commonly understood in France. By 1890 Fallot, who was in poor health and disappointed at the lack of enthusiasm for his socialist ideas in the Protestant establishment, asked to be given a simple parish in the country. He spent the last ten years of his life as pastor of Sainte-Croix, and then Aouste, near Crest in the Dr√¥me department. Tommy Fallot died in Mirabel-et-Blacons, Dr√¥me on 3 September 1904.

Main cultivations are produced in Europe. The varieties considered to be bicolored include Gala, Champion, Idared, Ligol, Jonagored, Najdared and Gloster.  Color and Taste  Ligol Apple color depends on many factors, which include weather conditions at the time of fruit ripening, temperature fluctuations between the day and night cycles, good insolation, and the soil composition. Bicolored apples that grow in certain regions of Europe, such as Gr√≥jec, are also characterized by a slight note of sourness, which results from the specific weather conditions, namely the ground frost occurring in that area during the autumn crop collection.  Consumer preferences ‚Äì studies  Idared In June 2014, European Fruit Magazine published the results of studies conducted by Katrin Korsten from the Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences in Germany. The object of the research was to determine whether European consumers prefer a specific apple color. Based on that research, bicolored apples proved to be more popular than monocolored ones. However, there was shown to be no difference in preference between apples that are red and green or red and yellow. For example, a combination of red and yellow was associated with such terms as sweetness, freshness, juiciness, natural, and harmony. In contrast, they associated a full dark red color with mealiness and judged them as artificial and unnatural.

The circumstances of his death in 1919 in Westbury, Long Island, resulted in a sensational grand jury proceeding. Family and early life Born in 1868, Jacques Lebaudy was the oldest son of Jules Lebaudy (1828-1892), who with his brother Gustave (1827-1889) owned the family sugar refining business, Lebaudy Fr√®res. Jules also owned property in Paris, including the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville. Jacques' mother Amicie (1847-1917) founded a charity to provide low-cost housing to the working poor which is still in existence. Lebaudy and his three siblings were reported as inheriting 227 million francs each on the death of their father. The death of Jacques' younger brother Max, aged 21, in a military hospital in 1895 after being conscripted for military service despite a serious illness caused a scandal in France. His brother had allegedly attempted to bribe his way out of the service. Jacques' cousins Paul and Pierre Lebaudy were notable builders of airships, such as La R√©publique. by the late 1890s Lebaudy had involved himself in breeding race horses. The Empire of the Sahara The Emperor of the Sahara's Stampage,Throne, Coinage and Flag In June 1903, Lebaudy sailed with his yacht Frasquita and two other boats to an area near Cape Juby on the Moroccan coast and proclaimed the \\"Empire of the Sahara\\". Backed by as many as 400 hired soldiers and sixteen Hotchkiss guns,Current Literature, October 1903, p. 412-3 Lebaudy established a camp and set up a throne for himself in a large tent, and stated he was now to be known as \\"Jacques I, Najin-al-Den, Emperor of the Sahara, Commander of the Faithful, King of Tarfaia, Duke of Arleuf and Prince of Chal-Huin\\". He had various projects for ruling and improving his new domain, but European governments disapproved of his venture, and some of his mercenaries were captured by local Moorish bandits. (They later sued Lebaudy for damages for abandoning them, after being rescued by a French warship). As Spain also had an interest in the area, his attempts at kingdom founding proved politically sensitive to the French government, and in an attempt to put a stop to his ambitions, they issued warrants for his conscription into the French army. He retreated to the Hague to bring his case before an international court. By October 1903 Lebaudy had taken up residence at the Savoy Hotel in London, setting up an imperial court complete with throne and installing his government there, appointing American adventurer George Edward Gouraud as his \\"Governor-General\\".Note: George Gouraud was not closely related to Henri Gouraud, a French officer active at that time in West Africa. Reportedly the orchestra in the Savoy restaurant would play his national anthem whenever he entered to dine under his imperial purple canopy. He also found himself an Empress, former actress Marguerite Augustine Doliere and they produced a daughter, known as \\"the Princess Jaqueline\\" After announcing \\"the throne will remain in the Sahara, with nobody on it; but his Imperial Majesty wishes it to be known that usurpers will be severely dealt with\\" he left Europe. United States About 1908 Lebaudy moved to the United States with his wife Augustine and daughter Jacqueline, residing mostly in expensive New York City hotels, and his behavior became more erratic. In 1915 he was placed in an asylum at the request of his wife; he at first fled the local sheriff on horseback, before surrendering but soon escaped, only to be recaptured after a few days. Lebaudy reportedly tried several times to have his wife and daughter killed, and was finally shot and killed by his wife on January 11, 1919 at her home in Westbury on Long Island. A grand jury refused to indict. He left a large estate, having inherited additional portions of the family money from his brother Max and his mother. He also had the reputation, despite his mental problems, of being at times a shrewd investor in stocks and property; he reportedly made a profit of over $1,000,000 in the stock of the Erie Railroad in 1907 when it became the subject of a takeover. Lebaudy was buried on 17 January 1919 in the Catholic parish cemetery of St. Brigid's, Westbury, now part of the Catholic Cemetery of the Holy Rood. In 1922 his wife remarried a French detective in a double wedding with her daughter, who married his son. In popular culture Lebaudy among a group of world leaders; he is the one peering at the area of the Sahara on the globe. Eug√®ne Og√©, 1904 Lebaudy was the subject of wide public interest, first in France and then worldwide. Caricatures of him include that by Sem above and the 1904 poster of world political figures by Eug√®ne Og√© to the right. He was the subject of several lampoons in London publications by the young P. G. Wodehouse. The Romance of Terence O‚ÄôRourke, Gentleman Adventurer by Louis Joseph Vance, a pulp novel from 1907 probably based on magazine stories published in 1904, is a romanticized version of the \\"Empire of the Sahara\\", with Terence O'Rourke being an American adventurer who is recruited to help a cowardly French millionaire become the \\"Emperor of the Sahara\\". Another work on Lebaudy was English artist John Copley's 1909 collection of lithographs \\"The Fall and Rise of His Imperial Majesty Jacques D√©mod√©\\". The adventures of Lebaudy even inspired a French game-maker to produce a wire puzzle in his honor.

London has always been a centre for the research in and development of most of the platinum group metals. Trade was established in the early 20th century, typically by existing dealers of gold and silver. The LPPM has been involved in fixing the world market prices of platinum and palladium since 1989. History Trading on the London Platinum and Palladium Market has a much shorter history than the trading on the London Bullion Market, which is performed since the 17th century. London has been a historically important centre for platinum and palladium. The trading was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century, alongside the longer-established bullion metals. In 1973, metal dealers established \\"London Platinum and Palladium Quotation\\"‚Äîa forerunner of the fixings. The prices for platinum and palladium were settled twice a day on the spot market. In 1979, leading dealers from London and Zurich signed an agreement to standardize the origin and specifications of the metals of the good delivery quality. On 5 May 1987, the London Platinum and Palladium Market was established with close assistance by the Bank of England, which was the regulator of the precious metals market at that time. Currently, the primary regulatory authority in the UK is the Financial Services Authority. In 1989, the quotations of platinum and palladium were expanded to full-fledged fixings. Price determination Twice per working day, the platinum and palladium fixings are set via telephone calls: *Morning: Monday to Friday, at 9:45 UTC (10:45 CET) *Afternoon: Monday to Friday, at 14:00 UTC (15:00 CET).

The bid price is one at which members of LPPM guarantee that they will buy good delivery metal. The bid prices for the metals are benchmarks for the market and therefore for the industry. The bid prices, in turn, affect the offer prices that customers are asked to pay for metal. The market values of the metals, as is the case for all commodities, ultimately affect manufacturing costs. Unlike a futures exchange, an OTC market offers some flexibility and confidentiality of transactions carried out between two entities. Many transactions are speculative; only a fraction of deals are closed via a physical delivery.

Her writings focus on \\"the many changes of girl hood, and maiden hood\\" before, during, and after the Civil War. Jane's diaries consist of three separate books that span the course of her lifetime: Book I (1837-1862), Book II (1863-1870), and Book III (1872-1882). The diaries were first published in 1908 by the Edwards and Broughton Print Company. In 2007, the Presbyterian Historical Society of Montreat, North Carolina donated the original books to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The diaries are now housed in the Southern Historical Collection at the Louis Round Wilson Library. Life  Jane was born on April 7, 1820 in Fayetteville, North Carolina, likely at Oak Grove, Myrtle Green, or Smithville. Her grandfather, Capt. David Evans, had been given a land grant from King George III. In 1775, David Evans met with several other Cumberland County, North Carolina residents to sign the Liberty Point Resolves in response to the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Colonel Alexander Elliot, Jane Evans Elliot's husband On January 12, 1847, Jane married Alexander Elliot, a lumberman and colonel in the state militia. Alexander previously had served in the North Carolina House of Commons (1824-1825) and the North Carolina Senate (1826-1827). Jane joined her husband at his residence on the Ellerslie Plantation after marrying. The couple had several children together: Mary Eliza, Jennie, Henry, George, Emily (Emmie), Jonothan (Jonnie), and Katie. Around the age of 35, Jane became sick with an unknown illness and was expected to die. The early death of her sister Mollie in 1855 likely exacerbated the illness. Jane would not fully recover until 1859. Jane viewed the outbreak of the Civil War with apprehension, noting how \\"every day brings something sad.\\" She helped other ladies in the Cape Fear River Valley make uniforms and knit socks for volunteers in the 51st North Carolina Infantry Regiment and other Confederate units. Her husband donated sabers and Bowie knives to a local cavalry regiment. Lieut. Alexander (Sandie) Elliot, Jane Evans Elliot's nephew The Elliot family at Ellerslie actively followed news from the front and viewed the Civil War as a war for independence. Although Jane's husband was too old for military service during the war and her children too young, many of her close relatives joined the Confederate Army. Jane's brothers served during the war, and one spent four months in a Union POW camp at Johnson's Island. Jane's nephew, Lieut. Alexander Elliot (Sandie), was killed in action at the Battle of Cold Harbor. Sandie was very close with the Elliot family at Ellerslie. Jane's daughter, Mary Eliza, plucked a plume from her hat to give to Sandie before he left for war. Sandie's fianc√©e, Sophie Mallet, served as a private tutor to the children at Ellerslie. Robert Smith, another family cousin, was also killed in action during the war. During Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's march to Fayetteville, Federal troops raided Jane's home at Ellerslie. The Union soldiers took all the family's blankets, clothes, silverware, and livestock. Jane wrote, \\"We have no way of getting to church as they took our carriage, buggy, wagons & every horse & mule & ox.\\" It is unclear whether the raid was sanctioned by the Union Army. A Union officer later asked Jane's husband if he thought $50,000 would be enough to recuperate the family's losses at Ellerslie. Views on slavery  Jane Evans Elliot's diary is an important historical reference that highlights the dichotomy of many southern women who staunchly supported the Confederacy while secretly disliking slavery. Elliot's views on slavery were likely influenced by her Christian faith. As a young woman, she wrote \\"‚Ä¶I ought to exhibit such deportment as would become a Christian and a Lady. And to servants that do so much for me ought I not to be kind and not censorious.\\" Elliot attached familial names to her family's slaves, such as \\"Brother Bill\\" and \\"Aunt Edy\\", and recorded their deaths with as much grief as she expressed for the deaths of her own relatives. She viewed the word \\"slave\\" as a pejorative and used the euphemism \\"servant\\" in its place. Elliot would not use the word \\"slave\\" until after the war. She reflected in 1865, \\"The war has closed & the slaves all emancipated. We have had many & sore trials to bear growing out of this social change. Let us weekly bow to the Divine will. We rest in the blessed assurance that 'he doeth all things well'‚Ä¶\\" References Category:1820 births Category:1886 deaths Category:American diarists Category:American Civil War memoirs Category:American memoirists Category:People of North Carolina in the American Civil War Category:Women diarists Category:Women in the American Civil War Category:Writers from North Carolina Category:American women memoirists Category:19th-century American women writers Category:19th-century American writers Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:19th-century memoirists ","title":"Jane Evans Elliot"},{"id":"46223703","title":"17th Saturn Awards"},{"id":"46223707","text":"Rosemary Bailey is a British writer.

Pristimantis mutabilis is the first known amphibian species that is able to change skin texture from tuberculate to almost smooth in a few minutes, an extreme example of phenotypic plasticity. The specific epithet mutabilis (changeable) refers to this ability. The physiological mechanism behind the skin texture change remains unknown. Taxonomy and discovery Pristimantis mutabilis was formally described in 2015 in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society; the holotype was collected in 2013. The species was placed in the genus Pristimantis on the basis of genetic studies supported by the morphological analysis. The new species was first spotted in 2006, but only in 2009 the first specimen was collected and its unusual abilities were discovered. Also Pristimantis sobetes, a related species but from a different species group, have been found to display similar skin texture plasticity, suggesting that this trait may be more common in Pristimantis than in other amphibians. Description Males measure about and females in snout‚Äìvent length. In life, males have light brown to pale greyish green dorsum, with bright green marks and grey to dark brown chevrons, outlined by thin cream or white line, with orange dorsolateral folds. The belly is pale grey to brown with darker, diffuse spots, and few small white spots. Females have red flash coloration. Habitat and conservation The species' habitat is arboreal and it is known from both primary and secondary Andean forests at elevations of above sea level. Pristimantis mutabilis is only known from three sites in two separate reserves. Based on the vocalizations during the night, it is abundant, but it is difficult to see because of its arboreal habits. However, the known subpopulations are separated by a dispersal barrier (the dry valley of the Guayllabamba River), and the general area is suffering from habitat destruction and fragmentation. Chytridiomycosis might also be a threat.

It stars Fiona O'Shaughnessy, Abigail Hardingham, and Cian Barry. It premiered at the 2015 SXSW film festival. Fiona O'Shaughnessy plays Nina, a revenant who comes back to life to torment her ex- boyfriend and his new girlfriend whenever they have sex.  Plot  After his girlfriend Nina dies in a car crash, Rob unsuccessfully attempts suicide. As he begins to overcome his grief, he falls in love with a coworker, Holly. Their relationship is complicated when Nina, unable to find rest in the afterlife, comes back to life to sarcastically torment them whenever they have sex. Rob and Holly must find some way to deal with the situation and put Nina to rest.  Cast  * Fiona O'Shaughnessy as Nina * Abigail Hardingham as Holly * Cian Barry as Rob * Elizabeth Elvin as Sally * David Troughton as Dan  Production  The writer-directors wanted to keep the film from descending into camp, so they kept the tone serious enough that people could still relate to the characters and their actions despite the situations. Focus was also put on keeping the metaphor of baggage in a relationship relatable beyond the literal interpretation of supernatural events. Production began in May 2013 in the UK. The Blaine brothers used a Kickstarter campaign to fund aspects of the film. They said that they did not want to ask permission to make a film; instead, they made the film they wanted and invited others to become involved in the process.  Release  Nina Forever premiered at SXSW on 14 March 2015. It was released via video on demand in the United Kingdom on 15 February 2016, followed by a DVD and Blu-ray release on 22 February.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes reports that 97% of 32 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 8/10 with the consensus stating, \\"Nina Forever tests the limit of the rom-com with a decidedly unorthodox triangle that's as diabolically original as it is daringly dark\\". Metacritic rated it 75/100 based on 10 reviews. Wayne Alan Brenner of The Austin Chronicle called it \\"a deftly unnerving collaboration between Lorrie Moore and Clive Barker\\". Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"The Blaine brothers do a superb job of balancing the absurdity of a corpse that's summoned every time they have sex and the tough themes like grief and the possible impossibility of closure.\\" Drew Tinnin of Dread Central rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"Always slowly developing just enough to stay interesting, Nina Forever strikes a fairly unique balance in tone, never winking and becoming too ridiculous given the circumstances while also dealing with loss in a very genuine way.\\" William Bibbiani of CraveOnline rated it 9/10 stars and wrote, \\"It's a unique exploration of horror, love and loss. It's a sexy, funny, morbid and beautiful film for horror lovers with a heart, and romantic audiences with a dark side.\\" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"The Blaine brothers' first feature is twisted, bloody, cheeky fun, but engaging performances from Hardingham and O'Shaughnessy create a combative fireworks show that impresses the most.\\" Oktay Ege Kozak of Indiewire rated it B+ and wrote the film would have been an excellent short but is overlong and episodic as a feature. Commenting on the film's nudity, Kozak wrote, \\"Yet the brothers' goal is far from empty titillation, as they construct an original and surprisingly tender romance.\\" Michael Rechtshaffen of the Los Angeles Times compared it to Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands and said it \\"emerges as a diabolically effective anti-date movie\\". At the British Independent Film Awards 2015, the Blaine brothers were nominated for Best Debut Director, and Abigail Hardingham won Best Newcomer.

Devadasi Culture in Odisha The Orissa Gazette of 1956 mentions some occasions where the devadasis danced. They had two daily rituals. The Bahar Gaaunis would dance at the Sakaala Dhupa. Lord Jagannath, after breakfast, would give Darshan to the bhaktas (the devotees). In the Main hall, a devadasi accompanied by musicians and the Rajguru, the court guru, would dance, standing near the Garuda sthambha (pillar).This dance could be watched by the audience. They would perform only pure dance here. The Bhitar Gaunis would sing at the Badasinghara, the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. Lord Jagannath, at bedtime, would be first served by male Sebaets- they would fan Him and decorate Him with flowers. Death At the age of 92 she left her last breath at Dolamandapa sahi, Puri and was cremated at Swargadwar in Puri, where her foster son Somanath Panda light the funeral pyre brought from the kitchen of Jagannath temple.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/world/asia/sashimani-devi-last-of- indias-jagannath-temple-ritual-dancers-dies-at-92.html?_r=0 References External links *http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11535593/Sashimani-Devi-temple- dancer-obituary.html Category:Articles created or expanded during Women's History Month (India) - 2015 Category:People from Odisha Category:Jagannath Category:2015 deaths ","title":"Sasimani Debi"},{"id":"46223821","text":"The EMD GA18 was an export locomotive built by GM-EMD in 1969.

Its primary objective, besides scientific documentation, mapping, and the mission civilisatrice, was an assessment of the river's navigability in order to link the delta region and the port of Saigon with the riches of southern China and upper Siam (modern day Thailand). Ambitions were to turn Saigon into a successful commercial center such as British controlled Shanghai at the mouth of the Yangtze River. Political objectives were heavily influenced by 19th century Anglo-French geo-strategic rivalries, namely the consolidation and expansion of French colonial possessions, the containment of Britain's colony of Upper Burma and the suppression of British economic interference on the Southeast Asian subcontinent. Over the course of two years the expedition, which came to be known as the Mekong Exploration Commission traversed almost from Saigon through 19th century Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar into China's Yunnan Province, finally arriving in Shanghai and mapping over of previously unknown terrain. Despite its explicit political and economic connotations, long after the classic Age of Discovery and the disappointment over the river's unsuitability as a trade highway, the expedition gained highest acclaim among scholars, in particular the Royal Geographical Society in London and \\"holds a special place in the European annals of discovery\\" as the first to reveal the Mekong valley region, its people, and southern China to Europeans. Background A French map of 1715, incorrectly showing the Chao Phraya River as a branch of the Mekong Having relieved the Siege of Saigon, Admiral L√©onard Charner proclaimed the formal annexation of three provinces of Cochinchina into the French Empire on 31 July 1861. The event marks the beginning of the colonial era of France in Southeast Asia, followed by the founding of French Cochinchina in 1862 and the French protectorate over Cambodia in 1863. The government in Paris maintained a more realistic idea on these acquisitions than most of its colonial entrepreneurs as it became clear that Cochinchina was \\"...not to be a jewel in the French colonial empire.\\" It had rather become a liability and the Ministry of the Colonies pondered options of retreat, strictly based on scholars' reports in French Indochina who measured Saigon's commercial success against British Singapore and Shanghai. Contrary to these sober official conclusions, the lucrative trade of these two ports and the economic links to China via the Yangtze motivated the French colonial community in Saigon to speed up surveying the Mekong. Since 1857 a number of colonial officers seriously voted for a mission \\"into the unknown lands north of the Mekong delta\\", arguing that their \\"government underestimated the importance of such an expedition for the continuance of French colonial power.\\" The eventual conquest and colonisation of northern Vietnam and the establishment of a solely French-controlled trade route to China were considered necessary objectives as the vast Chinese empire with its enormous market was to become a potential source of a great commercial opportunity. Francis Garnier, the most ardent supporter of the expedition wrote \\"For a long time the gaze of the colony had been cast with curiosity and impatience towards the interior of Indo-China which was shrouded in great mystery.\\" Louis de Carn√©, the youngest expedition member also pointed to the unknowns: \\"Uncertainty begins within two degrees of Saigon, the very inexact charts of the great river; beyond that, only misleading geography instead of serving it.\\" An earlier campaign, launched in Burma in 1837 by the British army officer Captain McLeod, who had travelled up the Salween River along the border to Thailand was considered proof of British rivalry and ambition. Only the refusal of Chinese authorities to allow him passage through Chinese- controlled territories ended McLeod's mission. Although unsuccessful, the event spurred fears that the British were about to win the race and close off Chinese trade to the French. Some historians, such as the Dutch author H.Th. Bussemaker have argued that these French colonial undertakings and acquisitions in the region were mere reactions to or counter-measures against British geo-strategy and economic hegemony. \\"For the British, it was obvious that the French were trying to undercut British expansionism in India and China by interposing themselves in Indochina. The reason for this frantic expansionism was the hope that the Mekong river would prove to be navigable to the Chinese frontier, which then would open the immense Chinese market for French industrial goods.\\" The Mekong Exploration Commission Participants of the Mekong Exploration Commission Route of the expedition In 1865, the colonial governor of Saigon, Admiral Pierre-Paul de la Grandiere, won approval for the expedition from a reluctant Ministry of the Navy and the Colonies in Paris. \\"Throughout 1864, the French government had vacillated over whether to sustain their colonial possession in southern Vietnam or to abandon\\" this so far costly venture. On his return to Saigon, the governor appointed the members of the Mekong Exploration Commission (or The Exploration Commission, fr.: Commission d'exploration du M√©kong) on 1 June 1866. * Ernest Doudart de Lagr√©e (captain, expedition leader, member of the Agricultural and Industrial Committee Cochin, entomologist) * Francis Garnier (lieutenant, inspector of Indigenous Affairs, mission leader after Doudart de Lagr√©e's death) * Louis Delaporte (lieutenant, archaeologist, artist, art historian) * Louis de Carn√© (governor de Carn√©'s nephew, aged 23, attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) * Eugene Joubert (geologist, medical assistant 2nd class)http://catalogue.bnf.fr/servlet/autorite?ID=15350021&idNoeud;=1.1&host;=catalogue * Clovis Thorel (botanist, auxiliary 3rd class doctor, member of the Agricultural and Industrial Committee of Cochin) * √âmile Gsell (photographer) The staff of the expedition, around 20 people, consisted of: * marine infantry Sergeant Charbonnier (secretary of the Head of Shipping) * a marine infantryman * two French sailors * two interpreters for Siamese and Annamite languages * Alexis Om, interpreter for Cambodian languages * two Tagalog sailors * an Annamese sergeant and his militiamen Mission The leading members of the Mekong Exploration Commission at Angkor from left to right: Lieutenant Francis Garnier, Lieutenant Louis Delaporte, Clovis Thorel, Captain Ernest Doudart de Lagr√©e, Lucien Joubert and Louis de Carn√© - engraving from photo by √âmile Gsell Author John Keay provides a vivid image of the departing party in \\"The Mekong Exploration Commission, 1866‚Äì68: Anglo-French rivalry in South East Asia\\": \\"In two minuscule steam- driven gunboats, with an inordinate quantity of liquor, flour, guns and trade goods, plus all the trappings of a major scientific expedition, the Commission cast off from the Saigon waterfront and headed upriver into the great green unknown on June 5, 1866.\\" In Cambodia Detouring into the Tonle Sap, the first stop was to be the ancient ruins of Angkor, which Henri Mouhot first had described in his pamphlet in 1861. The temple ruins, \\"a highlight for the expedition's members, served as an important point of remembrance for the expedition as the discovery had created a popular mania around the prospect of a newly-discovered ancient civilization in the Far East.\\" Disappointment soon set in after the expedition left the temple ruins, as only a few days later the men reached the Sambor rapids upstream of Kratie, the Pr√©patang and the Khone Falls in southern Laos, where at the Si Phan Don Islands the river splits into numerous channels with formidable rapids, waterfalls, currents and cataracts. In Laos At the Khone Falls, the men realized that the river was not at all navigable for any merchandise transport vessel and the steamboats had to be left behind. Still, the mission spent a week studying the falls, hoping to find a point where an average-sized river boat might be able to pass the cataracts or otherwise, whether the establishment of a lateral channel would be feasible. In spite of the \\"determination to put the stream to work, the Mekong was not yet a river to be tamed\\". Garnier found himself on a river that \\"would simply not cooperate.\\" He concluded that, \\"The future of rapid commercial relations on this vast river, the natural route from China to Saigon, of which I had happily dreamt the previous evening, appeared seriously compromised to me from this moment on.\\" On top of that, Captain Doudart de Lagr√©e had learned at the Cambodian court, that further upstream was another succession of rapids, between Pak Moun and Kemarat, around a hundred kilometers long, known as the Tang-Ho rapids or the Falls of Kemarat, where the river constitutes the border between modern day Ubon Ratchathani Province of Thailand and Savannakhet Province, Laos. The Khone Falls in Southern Laos In spite of the rapids, which for the moment ended any plans and efforts of establishing a route to China, the expedition continued to ascend upstream into Yunnan, China. The focus had shifted to scientific recordings, surveys and notes on topography, physical geography, demographics and social observations of the river valley. De Carn√© reflects on the shifting of motivations for the expedition: > The principal results which were expected from the exploration of the Mekong > may be summed up in a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps > should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being our > hope that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western > provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we > knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable > difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed > that there was a communication between the Me√Ønam and the Mekong? To gather > information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to > reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would > naturally offer, was the first part of the programme the commission had to > carry out.[sic] In April, the mission arrived in Luang Prabang, where the exhausted men rested for four weeks and obtained their passports for China. However, the difficult territories ahead and the region's politically unstable principalities affected appropriate future travel plans and the men's confidence. After much debate over the further route, the expedition left on 25 May 1867. From Burma to China On 18 June 1867 the men, whose health and condition had begun to seriously deteriorate and among whom malaria was widespread, left Siamese controlled territory and entered the Upper Mekong sector under Burmese rule. Shortly after the expedition left the Mekong and proceeded - on a much slower pace - on foot and oxcarts, that had been hired from local merchants. Progress, though was dragged even more by uncooperative official agents and the unpredictable local lords, who sporadically denied or granted permission to set foot on their lands. In August de Lagr√©e left the by now seriously disease-ridden and feverish men behind at the village of Mong Yawng in order to seek diplomatic support from the influential Shan States who might help with the mission's progress. Reunited after three weeks the expedition progressed and reached the borderlands to China by the end of September. On 7 October 1867 they crossed the Mekong via ferry, seeing the river for the last time. Once in China desperately needed clothes, shoes and equipment could be acquired and herbal remedies improved the men's health. At Ssu-Mao, Yunnan the travellers were yet again halted, this time by the Panthay Rebellion. They now pondered over the dilemma of whether to continue exploring the Mekong, or to conduct a commercial survey of southern China and abandon the river. Carn√© wrote: \\"We were compelled by the Mussulman revolt to leave the Mekong, in order to gain the Sonkoi; to abandon geography, and solve a problem of more practical and immediate importance\\" and \\"At this moment, the commercial question won out as the impracticalities of continuing the scientific mapping of the Mekong became apparent.\\" After several months strenuous march in torrential rains, through thick jungle, over rugged and mountainous terrain on high narrow rocky paths, the men arrived at the Yangtze River in January 1868. At Hui-tse, south of Dali the mission reached a tragic climax in the death of the expedition's leader, de Lagr√©e, who succumbed to an abscess of the liver on 12 March 1868. Francis Garnier took command of the mission after de Lagr√©e's death and safely led the expedition to Shanghai and the Chinese coast via the Yangtze River and finally set sail for the South China Sea towards Saigon, where they arrived on 29 June 1868. Consequences and conclusions French and British colonial expansion in Southeast-Asia Cartoon showing the \\"French wolf\\" looking across the Mekong towards the \\"Siamese lamb\\" Chiang Saen with a rhinoceros roaming the ruins (Delaporte) The records made over the course of two years were published in four large volumes. They \\"filled a thousand pages, and included surveys, observations, logs of food purchases, bottles of wine on board\\" and served as basis for subsequent travels. The Red River and its valley became the focus of renewed reconnaissance activities in order to find a commercial entrance into China for the French colonial empire. Just by accident the mission had discovered the potential of the Red River (Chinese: H·ªìng H√†, Vietnamese: Songkoi or S√¥ng C√°i), which flows from Dali in Yunnan across south-western China and Tonkin and exits via Hanoi and Haiphong into the Gulf of Tonkin. In 1872 de Carn√© wrote, [The Red River] \\"...promises to realize all the hopes and expectations which the Mekong destroyed...\\" Francis Garnier received an award to be shared with David Livingstone at the 1869 Geographical Congress in Antwerp. In 1870 he received the prestigious Patron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in London, the highest award an explorer of any nation could possibly receive. The institution's President Sir Roderick Murchison stated, \\"...France has the fullest right to be proud of these doings of her gallant naval officers...\\" Garnier continued his travels in the service of French Indochina, trying to discover whether the Red River might be the desired route for trade with China. Missions Pavie Colonial civil servant, explorer, and diplomat Auguste Pavie led four missions between 1879 and 1895, covering on foot, by elephant, or down the river on rafts, producing more accurate scientific data, such as the first atlas of the Mekong and at least six volumes of observations. Franco-Siamese War The expedition members cautiously observed the Lao principalities on both sides of the river, recorded political affiliations and noted the strong Siamese influence. The fact, that on the Bolaven Plateau, east of the river a Siamese official collected taxes caused great concern. Jules Hermand was sent to Bangkok in 1881 as \\"consul et commissaire\\" to counter Siam's influence, suppress Siamese-British collaboration and extend French control. Further surveys, military missions and expeditions followed, which helped to create the strategic and logistical framework for the successful French colonial acquisition of Tonkin and Annam in 1884, culminating in the establishment of the Indochinese Union in 1887, territorial losses for Siam, and the Treaty of Bangkok in 1893, which, among other things, resulted in the French protectorate over Laos and Cambodia as the Mekong constituted the border between France and Siam over the course of almost . Narrow gauge railway Passage up the Mekong past the Khone Falls was made in the mid-1890s by specially designed French steamboats, the Massie and the Lagrandi√®re (named after governor Pierre-Paul Grandi√®re). There had been unsuccessful attempts by other steamboats in the early-1890s to go up the falls via the river, but these two new vessels were dismantled and both taken over temporary rails and carried across Khone Island in a \\"prouesse d'acrobatie nautique\\" (\\"a feat of nautical acrobatics\\"). Pierre-Paul Lagrandi√®re's journey up the river in 1895 was ultimately terminated at the Tang-ho rapids (also called Kemarat Falls, of raging white water in the former Shan State, where modern day Myanmar borders Laos), and neither of the two vessels tried to ascend the river again. In 1897 a new railway was built on Khone Island, rendering passage past the Falls of Khone much easier until the line finally fell into disrepair in the 1940s. 19th century Romanticism Plates from Delaporte's drawings, in which certain features‚Äîruins, wild animals and enormous trees‚Äîare exaggerated in order to match and satisfy 19th century European tastes for the romantic helped to keep the commission in the public's mind. The drawings were widely reproduced, even to this day, on prints, postcards, calendars and tourist brochures, as well as gracing the walls of many of the better hotels in Southeast Asia.https://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/2601/10/Chapter%20Five%20pictures%20final%20with%20images.pdf See also References Bibliography  * External links * Pandaw magazine P. 61 * Map of the expedition's route * South_east-Asia - An introductory history * China and Her Neighbours; France in Indo-China, Russia and China, India and Thibet * The Last Emperors of Vietnam: From Tu Duc to Bao Dai * Treaty of Bangkok * Cornell Library * The French Voyages and the Philosophical Background * Cochinchine et Cambodge - Emile Gsell print album * listed works of Gsell at the French National Library * Mekong River map * Mission Pavie, Indo-Chine, 1879-1895 * The Colonization of Indochina * \\"Indochina\\" is a tourism book published in 1910 *Mekong Exploration Commission (Detailed website) Category:Asian expeditions Category:Botanical expeditions Category:1860s in Asia Category:French colonisation in Asia Category:French Indochina Category:Mekong River Category:New Imperialism Category:Second French Empire Category:British rule in Burma Category:1860s in Burma Category:1860s in Cambodia Category:1860s in Laos Category:1860s in Vietnam Category:1860s in Siam Category:1866 in the French colonial empire Category:1867 in the French colonial empire Category:1868 in the French colonial empire Category:1866 in Southeast Asia Category:1867 in Southeast Asia Category:1868 in Southeast Asia ","title":"Mekong expedition of 1866‚Äì1868"},{"id":"46223835","text":"Fahd bin Muqrin (Arabic:ŸÅŸáÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖŸÇÿ±ŸÜ) is a Saudi civic leader, businessman, and member of the House of Saud.

In 1946, he garnered the recognition in basketball and track and field. Early life Lowther was born in Houston, Texas, to Alexander Carswell Lowther and the former Jeanette Pippin. In 1931, he moved with his family to Alexandria in Rapides Parish. He was reared on 13th Street in Alexandria. He and a brother, Buster, and best friend, Ace Higgins, staged mock track meets, which set the stage for his later demonstrations of athletic prowess. He graduated in 1941, while he was still seventeen, from Bolton High School in Alexandria. At LSU, he majored in English and was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. His education at LSU was interrupted by World War II. In 1943 and 1944, he was a United States Army Air Forces B-17 bomber pilot with the rank of lieutenant. Athletic career Because he averaged fifteen points per game as a forward at LSU, Lowther was named to the Helms Athletic Foundation All-America basketball team. He also finished in second and fourth places, respectively, in the javelin and pole vault in the National Collegiate Athletic Association championships. On the occasion in 1995 of his induction into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in Natchitoches, Lowther told The Alexandria Town Talk that his winning in javelin and pole vault was unusual because most athletes can excel at only one of the two competitions. Heavier athletes have an advantage with the javelin, and slimmer ones with the pole vault. He was 6'5\\" and weighed 185 pounds. Upon Lowther's death of a lengthy illness in Alexandria at the age of ninety-one, his long-time friend Frank S. Brian (born May 1923) of Baton Rouge became the lone survivor of the original five starting LSU players in the consecutive winning teams from 1945 to 1947. LSU had its best winning percentage (83.3) in those two seasons. The Tigers won fifty-three of sixty-four games when Lowther was on the court. In 1946, Lowther and four players from the Kentucky Wildcats were named to the five-man All-Southeastern Conference men's basketball first team. In another 1946 triumph, Lowther was named the triple-jump champion at the national Amateur Athletic Union competition. In 1947, he was voted \\"Best All-Around Athlete\\" at LSU, having prevailed over Y. A. Tittle, Al Dark, and Joe Adcock. In 1978, he was inducted into the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the LSU chapter of the National \\"L\\"etterman Club. In 2005, after surviving lung and brain cancer, Lowther was honored as a Southeastern Conference \\"Living Legend\\" for his basketball prowess. Lowther placed third in the 1946 AAU decathlon and would have competed in the Olympics had he not broken a leg at an SEC meet in Birmingham, Alabama. He was still seeded in 1948 ahead of Bob Mathias of California, the Olympic champion in the trials who competed in 1948 and 1952. Lowther could not compete because his leg had yet to heal. For several years, Lowther played professional basketball for the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, now the Atlanta Hawks in Atlanta, Georgia, and the defunct Waterloo Hawks in Waterloo, Iowa. Later years Lowther was a businessman and an inventor of fishing lures and board games. While in his seventies, he worked with youngsters at numerous area high schools and Louisiana College in Pineville to demonstrate his knowledge of athletics. Lowther outlived by a year and a half his namesake son Robert \\"Robby\\" Lowther (1948-2013), who like his father graduated from Bolton High School and LSU, from which he received a basketball scholarship, and was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. The junior Lowther also played baseball and golf. He held a Juris Doctor from Louisiana State University Law Center. For a time while he resided in Many in western Louisiana, he practiced law and owned The Sabine Index weekly newspaper. He established a horse farm, \\"Beau Salael,\\" in Blanchard north of Shreveport in Caddo Parish, where he raised thoroughbreds. He subsequently relocated to Covington in St. Tammany Parish, where he continued to practice law. He and his wife, the former Merriam Hanesworth (born March 1926), have two surviving children, Bradley Hanesworth Lowther (born November 1950) of Baton Rouge, divorced from Cynthia Chaudoir Lowther Cortello, and Martha Merriam Burns (born c. 1956) and husband, Michael Eugene Burns (born c. 1952), of Pearland near Houston, Texas. Lowther died at an Alexandria nursing facility at the age of ninety-one after a lengthy illness of Alzheimer's disease. Memorial services were held on March 27, 2015 at St. Timothy's Episcopal Church in Alexandria. Four months after Lowther's death, his family sustained another loss when grandson Brian Joseph Lowther (1978-2015), died in Metairie at the age of thirty-seven. Lowther's younger brother, Charles A. \\"Buster\\" Lowther (August 27, 1926 - August 26, 2015), was also a Houston native and graduate of Bolton High School, at which like his brother excelled in basketball and track and field. At LSU, from which he graduated in 1949, Buster Lowther was all-SEC in the pole vault and affiliated like his brother with Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He enlisted in the United States Navy in World War II and was an Air Force officer in the Korean War. An insurance agent and member multiple times of the Million Dollar Round Table, Lowther was also an orator, singer, and stage actor, with the ability to voice nearly any accent. He was long involved with the Alexandria Little Theatre. He was the father of five children.

These Articles were subsequently modified by the General Assemblies of Seoul, South Korea, in September 2006, and of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012. AICESIS Presidents (Two years terms) * Mr. Herman H. F. Wijffels: 1999-2001, President of the SER of The Netherlands * Mr. Mohamed Salah Mentouri: 2001-2003, President of the CNES of Algeria * Mr. Jacques Dermagne: 2003-2005, President of the ESEC of France * Mr. Wang Zhongyu: 2005-2007, President of the ESC of China * Mr. Jos√© Mucio Monteiro: 2007-2008, President of the CDES of Brazil * Mr. Janos Tott: 2008-2009, President of the ESC of Hungary * Mr. Antonio Marzano: 2009-2011, President of the CNEL of Italy * Mr. Mohamed Seghir Babes: 2011-2013, President of the CNES of Algeria * Mr. Evgueny Velikhov: 2013-2015, President of the CC of the Russian Federation AICESIS Secretaries-General (Four years terms) * Mr. Bertrand Durufl√© : 1999-2008 * Mr. Patrick Venturini : Since 1 January 2009 Missions Mainly acting as a network, the three main Association's objective is, with full respect towards the independence of each of its members, are: * To develop cooperation between its members, by promoting exchange of experiences and good practices, * To promote social dialogue and participatory democracy at a wider level, * To encourage and support the creation of ESCs in countries which do not yet possess them in accordance with the principles of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the fundamental principles and rights at work endorsed by all members of the International Labour Organization. Functioning Composition To date, the AICESIS has 72 members, including 62 ordinary members, 6 associate members and 4 observers. AICESIS has 4 governing bodies: \\\\- The General Assembly meets once a year in one of the member countries. It is sovereign and takes at an absolute majority all the important decisions for the AICESIS life. \\\\- The Board of Directors manages the Association. It meets as often as the President or two Board members consider it desirable, usually twice a year. The Board of Directors is composed of eighteen members. They are appointed by the General Assembly for 2 years, taking into account a balanced geographical distribution (currently three representatives for Latin America and the Caribbean, six representatives for Africa, five representatives Europe, three representatives for Asia - Eurasia - Middle East). \\\\- The President is the President of a Council or Institution full member of the AICESIS. He is appointed for two years, according to a principle of rotation on a continental basis, by the General Assembly. With the Board of Directors, the President has the responsibility to manage the AICESIS. He represents the Association and chairs the Board of Directors and the General Assembly. \\\\- The General Secretariat is composed by a Secretary-General, elected by the General Assembly on the Board proposal for four years, Deputy Secretaries-General (one per continent) appointed by the Board for two years, an Administrator, and project managers. The Secretary-General is a permanent position at the Association, he manages the day to day AICESIS functioning, as well as the execution of missions and the monitoring of decisions. He prepares the medium term development plan of the Association, implements the decisions taken by the General Assembly and the Board, prepares and manages the budget. Finally, with the President, he ensures the representation of the AICESIS. Funding The AICESIS budget is essentially based on contributions from its members, the amount being determined by the General Assembly. However, the Association also receives in-kind contributions from some members. Thus, according to their means, most of them strive for participating in the AICESIS expenses, for instance by holding and supporting expenditure related to a meeting organisation (conference, working group meetings, general assembly, board, etc.). Works The AICESIS medium-term development plan identifies the following priorities: * Improve the internal governance by increasing information and transparency in the decision making process and the involvement of members; * Develop information and communication; * Strengthen partnerships with international organizations: ILO, United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA); * Improve cooperation and exchange of experiences between members on concrete issues; * Assist in the creation of ESCs in the world. Each year, the AICESIS General Assembly decides the priority working topics for the Association. The working methods, organized by the General Secretariat, ensure that the work is accessible to all members. Every Presidency of the Association suggests to the Assembly a main working theme. Previously, the AICESIS working themes focused on \\"Globalization of world trade and its consequences\\" (2000); \\"Fighting poverty through sustainable development: towards a partnership approach\\" (2003); \\"Creating an environment conducive to generating decent and productive employment and its impact on sustainable development, including sustained economic growth and poverty eradication\\" (2006); \\"Intensifying international cooperation, promoting joint development and building a harmonious world\\" (2007) ; \\"The role of ESCs/SIs in the new economic, social and environmental world governance\\" (2011); \\"Promoting the employment and socio-professional integration of young people: what are the new issues and what role can organized civil society play?\\" (2013); \\"National human capital and new sources of national competitiveness\\" (2015). Since 2007, the AICESIS gives the AICESIS Millennium Development Goals Awards. The first ones were given by the President of Brazil, Mr. Lula Da Silva in November 2007 in Brasilia (Brazil) to pay tribute to civil society organizations and public institutions that have undertaken noteworthy initiatives for Education (MDG 2). The second awards were given in July 2011 in Rome (Italy), with the participation of the President of the Italian Republic, Mr. Giorgio Napolitano, to noteworthy initiatives undertaken for women empowerment (MDG 3). The third awards were be given in September 2013 in Algiers (Algeria) to civil society organizations that have undertaken initiatives for the achievement of the MDGs 1 and 8 ‚Äúfull employment, decent and productive work for poverty reduction‚Äù. The last edition will be organized in September 2015 in Moscow (Russia) to reward ESCs/SIs for their actions promoting the Post-2015 Development Agenda. Since 2009, AICESIS organized every two years, the International Summer School for young people starting their career in an ESC, a SI, a member organization of these institutions, or just involved in the social dialogue in their country. The first edition was held in August 2009 in Noordwijk (Netherlands) on \\"The ESCs in a globalized world.\\" The second edition was held in Shanghai (China) in September 2012 on \\"The ESCs and sustainable development\\". The third one was organized in September 2015 in Kabardino-Balkaria (Russia) on \\"International cooperation between Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions in favor of global development.\\" Moreover, the AICESIS has developed a global database that lists all the economic and social Councils, similar Institutions or social dialogue institutions that exist around the world Also, the AICESIS publishes a monthly electronic newsletter available in six languages: English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Italian and Russian. Relations with other international organisations At its 44th plenary meeting, on 10 October 2001, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC),Decision 2001/318 adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its resumed substantive session of 2001 (10 October 2001) having considered the application of the International Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions, decided, in accordance with rule 79 of the rules of procedure of the Council, that the organization might participate on a continuing basis, without the right to vote, in the deliberations of the Council on questions within the scope of its activities. Thus, the AICESIS has granted permanent observer status with general competences, under intergovernmental organization (IGO).This enables it to intervene, alongside representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), to express the views of ESCs/SIs at the ECOSOC annual high-level segment. In November 2006, the Officers of the Governing Body of the ILODecision GB.297/20/4 adopted by the Governing Body during the 297th session (2‚Äì17 November 2006) have considered the question of the representation of the International Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions at ILO meetings, and vice versa. Having noted that the Director-General has received assurance that the ILO would be invited to all the AICESIS meetings of interest to it, the Officers recommend that the Governing Body permanently authorize the Director-General to invite the AICESIS to be represented at the annual sessions of the Conference and at other ILO meetings in which it has a technical interest, including meetings of the Governing Body at which issues of concern to the AICESIS are to be discussed. Thus each year, the AICESIS intervenes as an IGO, at the International Labour Conference, alongside representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and expresses the views of ESCs/SIs. In May 2012, the AICESIS and the ILO signed a cooperation agreement. The ILO and AICESIS have organized many joint conferences in this context (12‚Äì13 October 2010 in Cotonou, Benin: The role of ESCs in the implementation of the Global Jobs Pact; 12‚Äì14 April 2011 in Dakar, Senegal: The role of ESCs regarding public strategies and policies for employment and implementation of the global jobs pact; 10‚Äì11 November 2011 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic: Latin America regional seminar on \\"The role of ESCs in social dialogue\\"; 8‚Äì9 May 2012 in Geneva, Switzerland: social protection floor; 3‚Äì4 December 2013 in Madrid, Spain: The role of ESCs in the response to the global financial, economic and jobs crisis; 20‚Äì21 November 2014 in Seoul, South Korea: social protection floors for all). Finally, thanks to the experience of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) and the Union of Economic and Social Councils of Africa (UCESA), the AICESIS seeks to promote regional integration process and all forms of dialogue between economic and social actors in the North and South, East and West.

William has been seen in mainstream and religious media as a commentator on the issues surrounding Mars Hill Church and its former pastor Mark Driscoll, Christianity Today and Gospel Herald. The tenor of his comments were focused on the importance of emergency and long-term pastoral succession planning through various examples. Vanderbloemen uses the phrase, \\"all pastors are interim pastors,\\" and talks about a \\"hyper-connected world,\\" rendering the needs for churches to plan well ahead - as all churches will face transition issues.

It comprises the church, ossuary and calvary. Much of the old church was demolished and replaced in the 18th Century and between 1853 and 1856 a major part of the church was rebuilt with designs by the architect Joseph Bigot. The main survivor of the old church was the south porch. Until the French Revolution, the parish of Ploudiry was the largest in the L√©on region and embraced Loc- Eguiner, Ploudiry, La Martyre, La Roche-Maurice and Saint Julien de Landerneau. It was one of the areas in the √âlorn valley to be enriched by participation in the linen trade and much of this wealth was invested in the church and enlargement of the church building. It is a listed historical monument since 1916. Eglise Saint-Pierre The bell tower The existing tower dates to 1854, the original tower collapsing in 1850. A general lack of funds meant that the new tower was much smaller than the earlier tower and limited to one gallery. The south porch The south porch. At the very top we see the three empty niches. We see the arcaded entrance with pillars on either side and the pi√©droits and voussures around the arch. We see the statue of Saint Sebastian on the right. Everywhere we see intricate patterns and decorations Built in 1665 in the Renaissance style and in a mixture of the yellow Logonna stone and Kersanton. The entrance arcade mountings and voissoir are decorated with figures from the Old Testament and the Passion of Jesus Christ, including prophets and church teachers. There is a Kersanton statue of Saint Sebastian in a niche on the right side buttress.The porch at Ploudiry is much lauded and resembles those at Pencran and at Guimiliau although, being built in 1685, is much older. At the base of the arcade and in the \\"pi√©droits\\" ( the individual bricks of the pillars supporting the arch) are six scenes inspired by the book of Genesis and the story of Adam and Eve. In the first pi√©droit at the base of the left hand pillar, Adam and Eve appear in a scene depicting their temptation in Paradise. We see the tree and the snake. The snake has a human head whilst the body is reptilian and wraps itself around part of the pi√©droit. Eve is reaching towards the forbidden fruit. If we then move to the first pi√©droit at the base of the right hand pillar, we see the result of Eve's failure to resist the temptation. Now Adam and Eve are expelled from Eden. They attempt to cover their pubic areas with a flower and their other arms rest on their chests. Above Eve an angel shakes her fist in anger. Now we move back to the left and the second pi√©droit. Eve is now shown as a mother holding a baby and Adam works in the field whilst Cain and Abel make their offerings/sacrifice. Back then to the right side and we see Cain shielding his eye whilst his brother kneels in prayer. If we then return to the third pi√©droit on the left, we see Abel in his death throws whilst his brother, full of regrets, turns towards a small depiction of God who is most unhappy. The final third pi√©droit on the right depicts Noah harvesting his grapes and then, having drunk well, we see Noah clearly intoxicated, whilst Cham tries to cover his father's nudity by drawing together his cloak and another, either Sem or Japhet, struggles to hold Cham back. We then have a sort of sculptural full stop between the final pi√©droits and voussures. Then in the voussures leading to the keystone we have depictions of twelve people led by four prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Isiah and Ezekiel. Then come the four eastern doctors, Jean Chrysostome, Gr√©goire de Naziance, Athanase and Saint Basil and the four western doctors, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, Saint Gregory and Saint Ambrose. In the voussures after the keystone are twelve monks and nuns carrying the instruments of the passion. They hold one instrument in each hand so we see the whip and column of the flagellation, the cross and the nails, Malchus' ear on Saint Peter's knife and his lantern, the crown of thorns and the roseau from the \\"Ecce Homo\\" scene, the bowl used by Pilate to wash his hands, the tools and the ladder used to bring the body down from the cross, Veronica's veil, the lance of the transfixion and the hammer, the sponge and Judas' thirty pieces of silver. The final two figures hold the long bars used to push the crown of thorns down onto Jesus' head. In the porch interior are twelve empty niches.

Six columns divide the altarpiece into three sections and niches hold statues of Saint Guillaume and Saint Francis of Assisi. Further niches a little higher up contain images of a female saint and an \\"Ecce Homo\\". At the front, Saint Anne is shown teaching the Virgin Mary to read and smaller niches hold images of Saint Peter and Saint Paul and the whole composition is crowned by a statue of the crowned Christ. The Rosary altarpiece This altarpiece came from the old church where it had been located in the \\"Rosary\\" chapel (Chapelle du Rosaire). It dates to 1644. In side niches are statues of Saint Dominic and Catherine of Sienna and in the altarpiece painting we see these saints receiving the rosary from the Virgin Mary and Jesus. Under the altarpiece's niches are two panels depicting Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Beneath the painting, a garland contains the traditional fifteen medallions associated with the mysteries of the rosary (five of joy, five of sadness and five glory). Above the front of the altarpiece there is a composition involving the Virgin Mary and her child. The stained glass in the abside depicts the passion and dates from the early 16th Century. Stained glass The main window behind the altar came from the old church and depicts the crucifixion, with Christ on the cross and the two robbers on crosses nearby. Mary Magdalene is placed at the foot of the cross. Near to the good robber are some female saints and the disciples along with the soldier who would pierce Christ's side with a spear. On the other side we see the High Priest and various other people. At the base of the window, and obscured by the altar, are scenes of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, the Last Supper and Jesus' arrest. On each side of this window are statues of Saint Peter and the Virgin Mary with child. The two side windows are modern, date to 1957 and are signed \\"Gu√©vel\\". The left side window shows scenes from Saint Peter's life and the second scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary. The pulpit The pulpit has five panels with palm leaves and flowers decorating the stairway and is itself decorated with three bas-reliefs. In one the risen Christ is seen on a cloud handing the keys of heaven to Saint Peter. Saint Peter is of course the church's patron saint. In the central relief, Christ is shown in discussion with the lawyers and in the third relief, Saint Peter appears again. Above the pulpit there is a dove and at the top of the sounding board there is a carving of the papal crown and Saint Peter's keys. Facing the pulpit is a statue of Christ on the cross and a highly regarded piet√†. The ossuary A rectangular building, it has been listed since 1916. It is called the Saint Joseph chapel and dates to 1635, restored in 1731. The door has a Greek style front with a tympanum containing a bust of Saint Peter. To the left of the door are five bays separated by doric pilasters. Above a frieze is a depiction of the danse macabre featuring a labourer, a noblewoman, a judge, and a warrior, all equal before the \\"Ankou\\" or death. Over the ossuary stoup, an angel carries a banner reading \\"Bones gente qui par icy passez Priez Dieu les Tr√©passez 1635\\", a request to the passerby to respect the dead. Interesting to note is that a royal decree was passed in the early 18th Century which effectively stopped the use of ossuaries. Thereafter many such buildings were used as chapels, some as schools and many are now small museums.

The plants from which the root is obtained are also called \\"mandrakes\\". Mediterranean mandrakes are perennial herbaceous plants with ovate leaves arranged in a rosette, a thick upright root, often branched, and bell-shaped flowers followed by yellow or orange berries. They have been placed in different species by different authors. They are highly variable perennial herbaceous plants with long thick roots (often branched) and almost no stem. The leaves are borne in a basal rosette, and are variable in size and shape, with a maximum length of . They are usually either elliptical in shape or wider towards the end (obovate), with varying degrees of hairiness. Because mandrakes contain deliriant hallucinogenic tropane alkaloids and the shape of their roots often resembles human figures, they have been associated with a variety of superstitious practices throughout history. They have long been used in magic rituals, today also in contemporary pagan traditions such as Wicca and Odinism. The English name of the plant derived from Latin mandragora through French main-de-gloire. Toxicity All species of Mandragora contain highly biologically active alkaloids, tropane alkaloids in particular. The alkaloids make the plant, in particular the root and leaves, poisonous, via anticholinergic, hallucinogenic, and hypnotic effects. Anticholinergic properties can lead to asphyxiation. Accidental poisoning is not uncommon. Ingesting mandrake root is likely to have other adverse effects such as vomiting and diarrhea. The alkaloid concentration varies between plant samples. Clinical reports of the effects of consumption of Mediterranean mandrake include severe symptoms similar to those of atropine poisoning, including blurred vision, dilation of the pupils (mydriasis), dryness of the mouth, difficulty in urinating, dizziness, headache, vomiting, blushing and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). Hyperactivity and hallucinations also occurred in the majority of patients. Folklore The root is hallucinogenic and narcotic. In sufficient quantities, it induces a state of unconsciousness and was used as an anaesthetic for surgery in ancient times. In the past, juice from the finely grated root was applied externally to relieve rheumatic pains. It was also used internally to treat melancholy, convulsions, and mania. When taken internally in large doses, however, it is said to excite delirium and madness. In the past, mandrake was often made into amulets which were believed to bring good fortune, cure sterility, etc. In one superstition, people who pull up this root will be condemned to hell, and the mandrake root would scream and cry as it was pulled from the ground, killing anyone who heard it. Therefore, in the past, people have tied the roots to the bodies of animals and then used these animals to pull the roots from the soil. In the Bible Two references to (duda'im, plural; singular duda)‚Äîliterally meaning \\"love plants\\"‚Äîoccur in the Jewish scriptures. The Septuagint translates as (mandrag√≥ras), and the Vulgate follows the Septuagint. A number of later translations into different languages follow Septuagint (and Vulgate) and use mandrake as the plant as the proper meaning in both the Book of Genesis 30:14‚Äì16 and Song of Songs 7:12-13. Others follow the example of the Luther Bible and provide a more literal translation. In Genesis 30:14, Reuben, the eldest son of Jacob and Leah, finds mandrakes in a field. Rachel, Jacob's infertile second wife and Leah's sister, is desirous of the and barters with Leah for them. The trade offered by Rachel is for Leah to spend that night in Jacob's bed in exchange for Leah's . Leah gives away the plants to her barren sister, but soon after this (Genesis 30:14‚Äì22), Leah, who had previously had four sons but had been infertile for a long while, became pregnant once more and in time gave birth to two more sons, Issachar and Zebulun, and a daughter, Dinah. Only years after this episode of her asking for the mandrakes did Rachel manage to become pregnant. Sir Thomas Browne, in Pseudodoxia Epidemica, ch. VII, suggested the duda'im of Genesis 30:14 is the opium poppy, because the word duda'im may be a reference to a woman's breasts. The final verses of Chapter 7 of Song of Songs (Song of Songs 7:12‚Äì13), are: Magic and witchcraft Mandragora, from Tacuinum Sanitatis (1474). According to the legend, when the root is dug up, it screams and kills all who hear it. Literature includes complex directions for harvesting a mandrake root in relative safety. For example, Josephus (circa 37‚Äì100 AD) of Jerusalem gives the following directions for pulling it up: Excerpt from Chapter XVI, \\"Witchcraft and Spells\\", of Transcendental Magic: Its Doctrine and Ritual by nineteenth-century occultist and ceremonial magician Eliphas Levi. The following is taken from Jean-Baptiste Pitois' The History and Practice of Magic: In Medieval times, mandrake was considered a key ingredient in a multitude of witches' flying ointment recipes as well as a primary component of magical potions and brews.Hansen, Harold A. The Witch's Garden pub. Unity Press 1978 These were entheogenic preparations used in European witchcraft for their mind-altering and hallucinogenic effects. Starting in the Late Middle Ages and thereafter, some believed that witches applied these ointments or ingested these potions to help them fly to gatherings with other witches, meet with the Devil, or to experience bacchanalian carousal.Hansen, Harold A.

It formed in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1972 as a breakaway from Atlanta's Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and Atlanta Women‚Äôs Liberation. The organization dissolved in 1994.  History  In 1972, ALFA was founded in the Little Five Points neighborhood of Atlanta. A group of activists frustrated with the lack of inclusion in the Gay Liberation Front and Atlanta Women's Liberation decided to form their own organization. In an article entitled \\"Lesbians on the Move\\" in the counterculture newspaper The Great Speckled Bird, the organization described their political aims in August 1972: \\"We are a political action group of gay sisters. We are the large coordinating group for smaller consciousness raising groups and an umbrella group for Women's projects and gay Women's projects. We will serve as a communications center for all these groups. We intend to provide alternatives for ourselves and all sisters that will free Women to live outside sexist culture. We aim to reeducate the non- homosexual community, society in general, by being visible and vocal at every opportunity. We aim to reach out to all sisters in order to establish solidarity. We intend to work with gay brothers to further our mutual goals of gay liberation. We intend to initiate demonstrations and public actions to emphasize our demands.\\" By the fall, they had rented a house on 1190 Mansfield Street, which became known as the ALFA house, and they began to collect materials for their lending library and archive. Many of ALFA's early members came out civil rights work, organizing against the Vietnam War, and solidarity projects in Cuba such as the Venceremos Brigade. In 1973, the ALFA moved to McLendon Avenue and became increasingly active in local and regional lesbian organizing. In 1975, ALFA hosted the Great Southeast Lesbian Conference, which hosted 500 attendees. In 1986, ALFA moved to 64 Clay Street.  Activities  In the 1970s, ALFA served as a space for a wide range of activist and community building activities. The organization published a monthly newsletter, Atalanta. It established the Southern Feminist Library and Archives, which held feminist, lesbian and activist periodicals as well as the records of ALFA itself and of many other feminist groups in the South. It also had a circulating library of books. In 1974, ALFA created a softball team and entered Atlanta's City League as an out-lesbian team. The softball team created lesbian cheers and saw sport as a form of political engagement. In 1974, ALFA members formed Georgians for the ERA, began a radio show on WRFG, and picketed The Atlanta Constitution for refusing to report on or advertise lesbian organizational activities. The ALFA house was a space for meetings and events. There were benefits for an ALFA member who was in a legal battle over prior SDS activities and experienced COINTELPRO surveillance. A poetry group was started. ALFA began a political theater group, Red Dyke Theatre. ALFA also founded Dykes Together, an AA group. Events were also regularly held at the Tower Lounge and Charis Books. At the Tower Lounge, ALFA members met women ‚Äúwho had been lesbian in the 1950s and ‚Äò60s, who had come up through the school of hard knocks of lesbian life.‚Äù In 1978, ALFA picketed a public talk being given by Anita Bryant in Atlanta. In the 1980s and 1990s, ALFA continued to be a hub for both lesbian activism and social life.  Archives  The organization established the Southern Feminist Library and Archives, which held feminist, lesbian and activist periodicals as well as the records of ALFA itself and of many other feminist groups in the South. It also had a circulating library of books. When ALFA ceased its activities in 1994, the archives and most of the periodicals were sold to Duke University and are now in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Books & Manuscript Library as part of the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture; books on to feminist theory went to Emory University.

Designed by William Ralph Emerson and built in 1879, it was the first Shingle style house built in Bar Harbor, and is one of the oldest of the style in the nation. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description Redwood is set near the southeastern end of Barberry Lane, south of the main village of Bar Harbor, on a point north of Cromwell Cove that overlooks Frenchman Bay. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a roughly cruciform plan, set on a fieldstone foundation. It has a long north-south axis with roughly centered projections to the east (facing the water) and the west (facing toward the street). The western projection is gabled-roofed, with a second-floor chamber set above a porte- cochere which shelters the main entrance. To its right a tall two-story window rises to a small gabled peak, with an elaborately-decorated brick Queen Anne style chimney to its right. The eastern projection has a polygonal shape, with a semi-pyramidal roofline. The southern elevation has a recessed Palladian window set in a half-timbered upper section. An enclosed single-story polygonal porch projects from the southeast corner of the building. The interior of the house is richly decorated with woodwork. History Bar Harbor began to develop a reputation as a summer resort area in the 1860s, with its early tourist trade served by local residents boarding visitors in their houses, and by hotels that were built to meet the demand. In the 1870s wealthy visitors began building private houses. C. J. Morrill, a wealthy Bostonian, commissioned William Ralph Emerson to design this house, which was completed in 1879. This was the first (of many) residential commission Emerson executed in the Bar Harbor area, and was his first full expression of the Shingle style, whose oldest known example is the 1875 William Watts Sherman House in Newport, Rhode Island, designed by H. H. Richardson. Later owners included J. Howland Auchincloss, whose son Louis Auchincloss was considered one of the inheritors of the Edith Wharton tradition in literature. In the 1940s, Mrs. Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis, then known as Jaqueline Bouvier stayed at Redwood with her step-father Hugh Auchincloss.https://www.portlandmonthly.com/portmag/2016/06/playground-of-the- rich-famous/ \\"Playground of the Rich & Famous\\", Portland Monthly, Summerguide 2016 See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hancock County, Maine References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Shingle Style architecture in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1879 Category:Buildings and structures in Bar Harbor, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hancock County, Maine ","title":"Redwood (Bar Harbor, Maine)"},{"id":"46224138","text":"The Rocca di Novara (also called ‚ÄúRocca di Salvatesta‚Äù and ‚ÄúCervino di Sicilia‚Äù) is a peak in the Peloritani mountains, situated in the northeastern part of Sicily, between the territories of Novara di Sicilia and Fondachelli- Fantina from where trails start to its top.

She had previously served as the associate director of the Duke Methodist campus ministry. During her time at Duke, she published a compilation of sermons written by women and participated as a campus minister in the Silent Vigil at Duke University. Crotwell was the first woman appointed as a district superintendent in the United Methodist Church in North Carolina and one of the first in the Southeast. She served as the chairperson of the Commission on the Status and Role of Women in the United Methodist North Carolina Conference and advocated for inclusivity and female empowerment in the church. Her major interests included women and the church, women and theology, counseling, and the church and social justice.  Early life and education  Helen Crotwell was born on October 8, 1925, in Newberry, South Carolina, the daughter of James Calvin Crotwell and Mary Helen Gray Crotwell. She grew up in Leesburg, Georgia, where she and her family attended Leesburg Methodist, a small rural church. As a young girl, her early involvement in the church led her to dream about being a minister, even though the Methodist churches did not ordain women at the time. Crotwell graduated from high school when she was sixteen years old. She went on to the Georgia State College for Women, now known as Georgia College & State University, in Milledgeville. She attended during World War II, from 1941 through 1945. After graduation, Crotwell moved to upstate New York to join the Lisle Fellowship, an intentional Christian community that exposed her to ethnic and racial diversity and cooperation she had not seen in Georgia.  Early career  After leaving Lisle, Crotwell decided to pursue work in the church. Because the Methodist churches did not ordain women at the time, Crotwell obtained a master's degree in religious education from the Candler School of Theology at Emory University. Upon her graduation from Candler, Crotwell secured a job working in campus ministry in Rock Hill, South Carolina at Winthrop College, at the time a women's college and now the coeducational Winthrop University. There she was director of the Wesley Foundation, the Methodist ministry which served over 300 students. Crotwell found ministry at Winthrop to be dynamic and interesting, and she engaged with her students in discussions linking theology and social justice. Crotwell still felt called to ordained ministry, a vocation she could not pursue, but her first work experience in campus ministry took her a step closer. Crotwell wrote that she picked campus ministry in part because it was more open to women, saying that ‚ÄúIt provided the opportunity to minister and work with people without feeling like I had to be second string.\\" In order to further her career, Crotwell left Winthrop to spend one year at Harvard Divinity School. At Harvard, she took classes with Paul Tillich and Krister Stendahl, whom she later cited as one of her most formative teachers. After Harvard, Crotwell moved back to New York, where she spent two summers at Union Theological Seminary. Eager to continue her studies, she pursued further education in Europe. She studied with the second order of the Taiz√© Community in France and studied German at the Goethe-Institut in Germany, and visited the Iona Community in Scotland. Crotwell decided to return to the United States when a friend taking a leave of absence from his position at Duke University asked if she would like to serve as the associate to the Methodist campus minister there. In 1965, Crotwell moved to Durham, North Carolina to serve as associate director of the Wesley Foundation, the Methodist campus ministry.  Wesley Foundation at Duke University  As the associate director of the Wesley Foundation at Duke University, Crotwell became a leader for students eager to become involved in the civil rights movement. Twice she travelled with students to protests in Washington D.C. After hearing of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, nearly five hundred Duke students marched to President Douglas Knight‚Äôs house. Faculty members joined in, and President Knight invited the crowd into his home. Students called for a campus minister, and so Crotwell joined the sit-in. She stayed the night, sleeping on a landing at the top of a stairwell and offering conversation, counsel, and companionship. The crowd remained in President Knight‚Äôs residence for two days and then marched to the main Duke quadrangle in front of Duke Chapel. The action, later known as the Silent Vigil at Duke University, was one of the earliest of the mass student protests that emerged around the world in the weeks following King‚Äôs assassination. In a matter of days, the demonstrators‚Äô numbers grew to two thousand, nearly half of the undergraduate student body. Students occupied the quad around the clock, bringing the university to a near standstill. They protested university injustices as well as national ones; students pushed for living wages and university recognition of an employee labor union. Crotwell was a faithful presence at the vigil, offering solidarity to students grappling with the pain of their era. Tamela Hultman, one of the student leaders of the silent vigil, recalled, ‚ÄúAmong our most stalwart supporters were campus ministers like Helen Crotwell, whose apartment in the Methodist Student Center had always been a place of nurture and refuge, while she herself was a role model, especially for women students.‚Äù The vigil lasted from April 5 to 11, 1968, and resulted in Duke‚Äôs recognition of a nonacademic employees‚Äô union and a raise in worker‚Äôs salaries. Crotwell was also involved in student action around the Vietnam War. She and her students offered food to activists protesting the war and supervised the burning of draft cards in the basement of their campus ministry. In 1969, along with other religious leaders on campus, she signed a statement, published in the Duke Chronicle, calling for an end to the Vietnam War. She signed a statement written by Duke's Religious Life Council recommending the discontinuation of the university's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), arguing that it perpetuated military interests. Crotwell also aided the Christmas Fund Committee at Duke in 1969, which organized funds to purchase gifts for American draft deserters who were living in Canada.  Ordination  After her work with the Wesley Foundation, Crotwell left Duke and moved to St. Mary‚Äôs College of Maryland, where she was an administrator in the residential halls. She found the work unfulfilling and decided to pursue ordination, a goal she had harbored even before the ordination of women in the United Methodist Church began in 1956. When she left St. Mary's College, administrators from Duke University asked if she would return to Duke in order to become the associate minister to the university. She moved back to Durham in 1973 and pursued ordination in North Carolina. In 1973, Crotwell was ordained as a deacon in the United Methodist Church at a time when over ninety percent of the ministers in the North Carolina Conference were men. The title did not necessarily change Crotwell‚Äôs understanding of her role in the church; she later explained that people had already accepted her as if she were ordained. On June 2, 1975, two years after her ordination as a deacon, Crotwell was ordained as an elder alongside another woman, Gladys R. Williford of Raleigh. She and Crotwell were the first two women ordained as elders in the North Carolina Conference of the United Methodist Church, the highest order of ordained ministers in the church. At the North Carolina Conference, Crotwell used her position as an elder to make gender equality a central concern. She served as the chairperson of the Commission on the Status and Role of Women. During her time on the commission, she worked to prevent what she called a \\"women‚Äôs circuit\\", a practice in which women clergy are only rotated among the churches that seem comfortable with female pastors. She served as a member of the Board of Ordained Ministry as well, and for the general church served on the Curriculum Resource Commission and General Board of Discipleship. She also served on a revision committee of the United Methodist Hymnal, editing it for more gender-inclusive language.  Duke Chapel  Crotwell was asked to become the associate minister of Duke Chapel in 1973. She accepted the position, which included presiding over worship services in the Chapel once a month, and preaching three times a year. She also served as a member to the advisory board of Friends of Duke Chapel, an organization founded in 1974 for those interested in supporting the ministry and programming of the chapel. At the time of her appointment, she was the only woman on the religious life staff at the chapel. At Duke, she also worked with the Duke University Parish Ministry, the Sexuality Counseling Center, and various women‚Äôs groups. She acted as the advisor to the YM-YWCA, and started women‚Äôs theology programs. She supervised a number of service projects at Duke, including an initiative to provide money and fuel to Durham residents who could not afford to heat their homes. Along with teaching classes at the Divinity School, including one called \\"Women and Ministry,\\" she also counseled students and staff members in the Duke community. During her time at Duke, Crotwell also published a compilation of sermons written by a diverse group of both ordained and lay women from a variety of political and theological backgrounds. Her compilation, titled Women and the Word, was published by Fortress Press in 1978. She viewed the book as a refutation of the notion that women in ministry are not suited for the pulpit. She wrote that churches that invite female preachers ‚Äúmay well hear the word of God come to them in a new and different way‚Äù, but also observed that no major pulpit in the country was at that time filled by a woman. Some of Crotwell's sermons are available for perusal in the Duke Archives. Crotwell brought her experiences as a female minister to bear in arenas outside the university as well. In August 1977, she was named as a trustee of the Resource Center for Women and Ministry of the South, founded by her close friend Jeanette Stokes, a Presbyterian minister. She spoke at various events outside of Durham as well. For example, in 1977 she presented a lecture at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke titled \\"What Values Will Have to Change for the American Woman?\\", and in 1978 she participated in a panel in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for the American Association of University Women, in which she discussed her experience as a woman in a traditionally male profession. In 1977, Crotwell also served as a principle speaker at a United Methodist conference at the University of San Diego, where she delivered a talk on gender inclusivity in Christian theology.  Dismissal  In October 1978, the Reverend Robert Young, Duke University minister, informed Crotwell that her contract at Duke Chapel would not be renewed. He explained that the university had recently adopted an \\"unwritten policy in which junior positions are changed regularly to provide new and creative thought.\\" The decision upset faculty and students across the campus. Some felt that Crotwell would not have been dismissed had she been male, and suspected that Young may have felt threatened by her popularity on campus. Crotwell was widely seen as one of the most visible female leaders on campus. A student group called the ‚ÄúCoalition on Chapel Policy‚Äù formed in response and circulated a petition calling for Crotwell‚Äôs reinstatement. They were troubled not just by her dismissal, but also the precedent it set. In the Duke student newspaper, Charlotte Dickson, a member of the Coalition on Chapel Policy, wrote, ‚ÄúIf women are confined to junior positions which are subject to frequent turnover, their chances of advancing are slim.‚Äù Other groups also acted on Crotwell‚Äôs behalf. Members of the Duke Chapel Choir circulated a petition of their own. Female faculty and staff members in a group called ‚ÄúThe Women‚Äôs Network‚Äù partnered with students to petition to have Young reverse his decision and suggest alternate hiring and contractual procedures. They also wrote to several universities to collect information about their associate ministers' contracts. Their efforts prompted Duke's trustees to ask for a plan for a Duke Religious Affairs Council. In response, Duke's president, Terry Sanford, released a statement expressing concern and calling for the creation of an administrative body called the University Council on Religious Life. Young, however, did not revoke the dismissal. In 1980, as per the recommendation of both the network and President Sanford, the university established the Religious Life Council to advise the chapel minister on policy and personnel decisions. After Crotwell's dismissal, the Religious Life Council remained to improve transparency and accountability in chapel administrative procedure. James B. Craven III, Duke class of 1967, wrote in the Chronicle on June 18, 1979, that Crotwell's dismissal ‚ÄúUpset just about everybody connected with Duke‚Äîmen and women, whites and blacks, faculty and students. Helen‚Äôs two new churches are to be congratulated, but Duke has suffered a real loss.‚Äù  Later career  In June 1979, Crotwell was appointed minister of two rural churches in Granville County, North Carolina: Banks Church, and Grove Hill Church. She preached at both churches each Sunday morning. Under her ministry, church attendance and tithing increased. At Banks and Grove Hill, Crotwell instituted small changes to make the institutions more inclusive of women. She incorporated gender- inclusive language, sometimes discarding masculine pronouns for God and encouraging her parishioners to use terms like \\"chairperson\\" rather than \\"chairman\\". In 1983, Crotwell transferred to Wake Forest United Methodist Church in North Carolina, where she served as pastor for three years. On July 1, 1986, Crotwell was appointed Fayetteville District Superintendent in the United Methodist Church while serving as pastor at the Wake Forest United Methodist Church. She was the first woman to be appointed a United Methodist district superintendent in North Carolina, and one of the first in the Southeast United States. As the district superintendent, Crotwell focused much of her efforts on small church communities and the church communities of racial and ethnic minorities. Her reputation began to spread. In December 1990, she was honored with an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree by Methodist University in Fayetteville, North Carolina. In 1992, she was asked to run for the position of bishop by women of the southeastern jurisdiction of the nationwide United Methodist Church governing body. Her candidacy made her the first woman endorsed as a nominee for the episcopacy of the United Methodist Church. Crotwell did not win the election and the bishops remained all-male. After her term as district superintendent, Crotwell returned to Durham in 1992 and for two years served as pastor to Mt. Bethel, a small congregation just outside Durham.  Later life  In 1994, Crotwell retired from the North Carolina Conference of the United Methodist Church. In order to be close to family, she moved to Cordele, Georgia, where she served as the minister of Wenona United Methodist Church for two years. She moved in with her sister and brother-in-law, Neal and Demp Posey. She died in her home on Palm Sunday, April 9, 2006. Her ministry was highlighted at the United Methodist Annual Conference on June 15, 2006, during the celebration of the 50th anniversary of women‚Äôs full ordination in the United Methodist Church.
