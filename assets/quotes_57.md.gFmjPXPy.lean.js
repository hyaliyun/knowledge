The scalpel surface itself cuts through tissue by vibrating in the range of 55,500 Hz. The high frequency vibration of tissue molecules generates stress and friction in tissue, which generates heat and causes protein denaturation. This technique causes minimal energy transfer to surrounding tissue, potentially limiting collateral damage.

History The central area of Kentucky was settled by frontiersmen that received land grants as payment for their military service. In the early days in Kentucky, the area was dangerous because the settlers were frequently attacked by Native Americans that used the land as a buffalo hunting ground. In 1775, John Andrew Miller settled in Kentucky and by 1785 had built a sturdy house on of land in an area now called Scott County, Kentucky. Miller sold the house and of land in 1809 to Jeremiah Tarleton, a new settler from Maryland. William C. Graves bought the property from Tarleton's estate in 1833. Architecture The John Andrew Miller House was constructed with strong materials to provide protection from attacks by Native Americans that occurred in the frontier areas of Virginia. The rugged doors were made of \\"6 panels on the outside and bias batten on the inside\\".

The grove, located in the northwest corner of the park, is accessed by the Muir Grove Trail which begins from the Dorst Creek Campground. Because of its relatively remote location in the park, it is significantly less visited than the more popular groves of large sequoia trees in the park. The isolated atmosphere helps keep Muir Grove untouched and preserved. History and Origin Muir Grove was named after the Scottish-American naturalist and author John Muir. His advocacy for the preservation of wilderness in the United States made him well known among environmentalists and politicians. His writing about nature and conservation efforts helped sway many public and political opinions. His attempts lead to the creation of Sequoia and General Grant National Parks. Vegetation Map showing location of Muir Grove Muir Grove has a total of 629 coniferous trees that scatter the terrain. The giant sequoia reproduction is relatively slim compared to other groves in the California National Parks. The high relative density of mature trees compensates for the lack of young trees. There is an increased reduction of trees between one and five feet in diameter compared to other mature groves. Abies concolor dominates the grove, with 523 trees (83% of the total). The next most important species in the moderate-elevation grove is Pinus lambertiana, with 71 trees (11% of the total). There are 33 specimens of the well-known Sequoiadendron giganteum (5% of the total). There also are Libocedrus decurrens (0.3% of the total), which grow on dry or rocky surfaces. There are 56 different species present in the ground-covered vegetation. It's relatively moist, creating mesic conditions. There is only 16% land without vegetation in Muir Grove. Ground cover includes Chrysolepis sempervirens (covering 2.7% of the ground area), Corylus cornuta var. californica (2.4% of ground area), and Cornus nuttallii (0.2% of ground area). Muir Grove Trail Muir Grove Trail is about a 4.2 mi hike, climbing 530 feet. Beginning from the Dorst Creek Campground, hikers can travel west for 1.9 miles, which leads to the edge of the old-growth sequoia grove. Few travelers take the time to walk this trail to witness the mammoth sequoias. Along the trail itself, there are almost no sequoias, but it has Sierra woodland scenery which people admire. There are two creeks, pinewoods, and other large trees that encompass the scenery. As hikers finally reach Muir Grove, the trail stops and the grove becomes a shallow saddle around the outskirts. There are abundant sequoias that scatter the grove making it an isolated domain.

At the time of the 1920 U.S. Census (January 1920), Karl was living in Los Angeles with his grandmother. In 1938, he married Anna E. van Kleeff (stage name Kita van Cleve), who was then performing the part of Herodias in the Lester Horton non-verbal all-dance production of the play \\"Salome\\" written by Oscar Wilde. At the time of the 1940 U.S. Census (April 1940), the couple was renting a small house in Hollywood; his occupation was listed as a \\"salesman\\" working in a gasoline station. He and Kita were divorced about 1946. Suessdorf was best known for his collaboration with lyricist John Blackburn in composing the jazz standard, \\"Moonlight in Vermont\\", which was first recorded in 1944 by Billy Butterfield's Orchestra featuring Margaret Whiting. He also composed \\"I Wish I Knew' (1945) and \\"Susquehanna\\" (1957) with Blackburn and \\"Sea at Monterey\\" (1957) with Blackburn and Steve Graham (pseud. of Michael H. Goldsen).

It is customarily used in the bridge position.

Inside the EMG89 pickup are both single and dual-coil pickups, each with its own output. The single-coil mode is an Alnico loaded stacked EMG SA. The dual-coil mode consists of two Alnico loaded coils opposite one another creating a pickup similar to the EMG 85. A push/pull volume or tone enables you to switch from the clarity of a single-coil to the fatness of a humbucking. Virtually noiseless in both modes, it can also be used with several EMG accessories such as the SPC, EXG expander, or the PA2 preamp booster. The EMG 89R is exactly the same pickup except that the print-position of the EMG logo is swapped to the side opposite of the single-coil. When the pickup is placed in the neck position of an instrument the single coil has a warmer tone. The same effect can be achieved by mounting a regular EMG 89 pickup upside down, however this method is unpopular for the unfamiliar look this method creates.

Originally ordered as USS Dogwood (YN-3), she was renamed and renumbered to Buckthorn (YN-9) before construction began in December 1940. She was launched in March 1941, and completed in September 1941. Placed in service at that time without being commissioned, she was commissioned in December 1942, and decommissioned in August 1947. She was placed in reserve in 1947 and scrapped in 1976.  Career  The second ship to be so named by the Navy, Buckthorn (YN-9) was laid down on 5 December 1940 at Alameda, California, by the General Engineering & Drydock Co.; launched on 27 March 1941; sponsored by Mrs. Rosalie Benton Day; and placed in service at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 16 September 1941, Lt. Lewis Williams, USNR, in charge. That same day, the ship departed the Mare Island Navy Yard. She arrived at San Pedro, California, on the 20th and reported for duty as a unit of the net defenses and inshore patrol. She spent the next 21 months tending nets and conducting patrols at San Pedro. During that time, on 9 December 1942, Buckthorn's status was changed from in service to in commission. At the end of June 1943, the net tender received orders reassigning her to the 13th Naval District. She departed San Pedro on 14 July 1943 and arrived in Seattle, Washington, on the 21st. On the 22d, the ship entered the Winslow Ship Yards for an overhaul that lasted until 15 August. At that time, Buckthorn began tending nets at Manchester, Washington. On 3 September 1943, she got underway from Manchester, bound for duty in Alaskan waters. The ship arrived at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on the 12th and began service with the net defenses there. At the end of the month, she moved to Adak and, by 5 October, had joined the net defenses at Attu. On 13 October, she participated in what appears to be the only combat action of her career when she fired one round of 3-inch and 120 rounds of 20-millimeter at attacking Japanese bombers. She continued her service at Attu until the spring of 1944. During that time, on 1 January 1944, she was reclassified an auxiliary net tender and redesignated AN-14. On 24 April 1944, she set sail to join the net defenses at Amchitka Island. Her tour of duty at Amchitka lasted from 25 April to 28 June. On 29 June, Buckthorn returned to Adak for almost three months of service. On 23 September, the net tender shaped a course back to Attu where she remained from 25 September to 24 January 1945. She next tended nets at Adak again between 29 January and 16 April. On the latter day, Buckthorn headed back to Amchitka where she served during the period 17 April to 5 June. On 5 and 6 June, she made the voyage between Amchitka and Adak, spending the following 10 weeks at the latter island. On 18 August, Buckthorn departed Adak for Dutch Harbor. Between 20 August and 5 September, she underwent her first overhaul at Dutch Harbor. The ship returned to Adak on 7 September and resumed her duties with the net defenses there. Buckthorn continued to serve at various locations in the Aleutians until March 1946. On 14 March 1946, she arrived in Seattle, Washington, for her second overhaul. The ship entered the Todd Pacific Shipyard on 1 May and emerged again on 16 July. The net tender returned to Alaskan waters at Kodiak on 27 July. She resumed her former duties at the several familiar Aleutian locations until late April 1947. On 23 April, Buckthorn received orders heralding her inactivation. After a leisurely voyage that included lengthy stops at Dutch Harbor, Kodiak, and Seattle, the net tender arrived in San Diego, California, at the end of the first week in August. On 20 August 1947, Buckthorn was decommissioned and berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1963, and she was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration to be berthed with the Suisun Bay facility of its National Defense Reserve Fleet. She was scrapped in 1976.

(\\"Bob\\") Geary is a former officer in the San Francisco Police Department who gained notoriety as the subject of a ballot initiative to allow him to take his ventriloquist's dummy, Brendan O'Smarty, on foot patrol. Early life Geary holds an undergraduate degree in art, and a master's degree in education. He earned four Medals of Valor. He was a member of AFTRA and the Screen Actors' Guild, having worked as a hand model and starring opposite Don Johnson in a 1981 television movie, The Two Lives of Carol Letner. In the 1980s he became a favorite subject of columnist Herb Caen, after he wrote a letter to the editor of the San Francisco Chronicle defending the police department for issuing too many tickets to taxicabs. Officer Geary was found \\"not guilty\\" of writing too many tickets at a public event held in a North Beach theater that featured a stripper in the role of bailiff. Ballot initiatives In 1988, San Francisco police attempted for budgetary reasons to end its historic horse patrol program for which his then-girlfriend served as a mounted police officer. Geary sponsored a ballot initiative to save the program, which passed with 86 percent of the local vote, the highest margin of any to date in the city. In 1991 Geary was assigned to a community policing position in North Beach. The program encouraged officers to be \\"highly visible\\" and use \\"creative and ingenious methods\\" to earn the trust of local civilians. Geary decided to order an expensive wooden dummy out of a ventriloquist catalog. He bought an audiotape program to teach himself to use the dummy, practicing in front of a bathroom mirror. Geary chose the name \\"Smarty\\" as a pun on the word \\"Dummy,\\" and the full name \\"Brendan O'Smarty\\" to add dignity to the doll. Geary took the dummy to entertain children while he was on patrol, dressing it in a police uniform with badge number 1/2 and a water pistol. Despite carrying the dummy, Geary was able to function as an officer, chasing and tackling at least one suspect with dummy in hand. In 1992, San Francisco mayor Frank Jordan named a relatively unknown police officer, Anthony B. (\\"Tony\\") Ribera, to become chief of police. The previous chief, Richard Hongisto, was fired after only six weeks on the job for ordering his officers to destroy copies of the San Francisco Bay Times that had lampooned him over what the paper considered a heavy-handed police response to an outbreak of rioting following the Rodney King police brutality verdict. Whereas Hongisto had tolerated Brendan O'Smarty, Ribera ordered Geary to keep the dummy in his police car while he went out on patrol. Despite an internal appeal and some press coverage, the department refused to rescind the order. The board of supervisors passed resolution urging the mayor to override the police chief, but he refused. In 1993 Geary formed the \\"Committee to Save Puppet Officer Brendan O'Smarty,\\" which collected nearly 10,000 signatures in a self-financed campaign to bring the matter to a local referendum. The measure was designated and certified for the general election in November, 1993, the last of 28 ballot measures. The ballot's wording was: > Shall it be the policy of the people of San Francisco to allow Police > Officer Bob Geary to decide when he may use his puppet Brendan O'Smarty > while on duty? Despite opposition from the police chief and others who considered the referendum an embarrassment, the measure passed by a narrow 51% to 49% margin. Geary continued to use the puppet throughout the 1990s and became, in addition to a local phenomenon, a celebrity at ventriloquist conventions nationwide, and appearing in the 2000 documentary, Dummies! Tax lawsuit Soon after the election Geary attempted to take an $11,500 tax deduction over the funds he spent on the ballot measure, calling them an \\"advertising expense\\" to offset $10,000 paid him by Interscope Communications for work on developing a screenplay over the ballot affair. The Internal Revenue Service objected in 1995, and filed a notice of deficiency in 1997. The case drew nationwide attention, bringing appearances for Geary on Prime Time Live and Comedy Central. In its own public relations effort the IRS issued a number of humorous statements, saying among other things, \\"when it comes to taxes, Officer O'Smarty is a dummy.\\" In 2000 the United States Tax Court ruled against Geary, reversing the deduction and assessing back taxes and \\"accuracy\\" penalties, on the basis that expenditures spent on political causes such as ballot initiatives are disallowed under Internal Revenue Code section 162(e), even if they would otherwise be deductible under other sections of the code. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later upheld that decision but reversed the accuracy penalties because Geary had taken the deductions in good faith. Retirement In 1998 the police department named a horse for Geary. In 2000 Geary sued an advertising agency for using his likeness to promote the Colorado Lottery. Officer Geary and Brendan O'Smarty retired from the police force in 2000. Then-mayor Willie Brown declared the day \\"Officer Geary Day.\\" For his last day Geary went on patrol in a Wells-Fargo stagecoach drawn by four horses.

He later served as a college assistant coach before working in Texas' parole system and finally retiring. Early years Little was born in Corpus Christi, Texas. At the age of 12, his father died. His mother remarried when Jack was a senior in high school and moved to Washington, D.C. Jack and his older brother, Gene, remained in Corpus Christi. His brother received a scholarship to play football at Rice University.(Little In high school, Little was a second-team All-District football player.Burson (2004), p. 27. Playing career Although Little enrolled at the University of Houston as a freshman, he did not attend any classes or played football there. Intimidated by the three-a-day practices that Houston held, Little and a high school friend escaped to Texas A&M.; Little tried out for the football team, only because head coach Harry Stiteler was impressed by his toughness, determination, and intelligence.Burson (2004), pp. 24‚Äì27 Little lettered in football at Texas A&M; from 1950‚Äì52. In 1950, he was part of an A&M; squad that led the Southwest Conference (SWC) in total offense, and played in the Presidential Cup. Little made two All-America first teams during his college years, one as a junior in 1951 and another as a senior in 1952. He also named an All-SWC lineman the same years. He also made the distinguished students list during his senior year for his academic performance. He was ultimately inducted into the Texas A&M; Athletic Hall of Fame in 1982. In the 1953 NFL Draft, Little was selected in the 5th round (50th overall) by the Baltimore Colts. He played two seasons for the Colts before a back injury ended his playing career. Career after the NFL After his brief stint in the NFL, Little became an assistant football coach for Texas A&I; (now Texas A&M;‚ÄìKingsville). He was subsequently offered another assistant job by Baylor University head coach John Bridgers. Little accepted the position in 1963, and helped lead the Bears to an 8‚Äì3‚Äì0 record and a No. 20 finish in the national Coaches Poll. Little served as a coaching assistant at Baylor until 1968, when Bridgers was fired. Little remained for a brief period at Baylor, working in the school's outdoor education program. Little later became an assistant for Sam Houston State University. He quit the coaching profession after another back injury. He then worked for Texas' parole system for 17 years before retiring in 1996.Burson (2004), pp. 29 Personal Little married his wife Nancy in 1950, which was at the end of his freshman year.

She was the daughter of King Hans of Denmark, Norway and Sweden and his spouse, Christina of Saxony.  Biography  As a child, Elizabeth had a close relation with her brother, the later King Christian II of Denmark. She was able to read and write in both Danish and German. On 10 April 1502 she married Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg, in a double wedding alongside her uncle, the future king Frederick I of Denmark, and her sister-in-law Anna of Brandenburg. Elizabeth and Joachim got along quite well during the first twenty years of their marriage and co- existed harmoniously. She received her mother in 1507, attended her brother Christian's wedding in 1515 and received Christian in 1523. Her spouse was a pugnacious adherent of Roman Catholic orthodoxy during the Reformation. In 1523, she visited a sermon of Martin Luther with her brother and her sister- in-law and became a convinced Protestant. In 1527, she received the Protestant communion in public: this meant a public break with the Catholic Church, and caused a conflict with her husband. In 1528, her husband asked a clerical council from the Catholic Church if he should divorce, execute or isolate her if she refused to renounce her new conviction. The church council replied that he should have her imprisoned. Elizabeth escaped to the court of her uncle, John, Elector of Saxony, and a public debate broke out: the Protestant monarchs and her brother supported her, Luther supported her freedom to leave her husband for her religion, and she declared that she would return only if she was allowed to keep her conviction and if her husband renounced his adultery and his interest in astrology. Otherwise, she suggested that they separate, referring to the separation of her own parents in 1504. She was given a residence near Wittenberg. Her husband refused to give her an allowance and forbade her sons to visit her. In 1532, her uncle died and her brother was imprisoned, and she thereby lost her supporters. In 1535, her husband died and her sons asked her to return to Brandenburg, but changed their minds when she made the demand that the parishes in her dowry lands be made Protestant. She finally returned in 1545 and stayed in Spandau. The marriage of her son Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg, to Hedwig Jagiellon did not satisfy Elizabeth. Catholic services were held for Hedwig in her private chapel, and the Dowager Electress was also unhappy because Hedwig could not speak German.  Issue  Elizabeth's children were the following: #Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg #Anna (1507‚Äì1567), in 1524 married Albert VII, Duke of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow, #Elisabeth (1510‚Äì1558), in 1525 married Eric I of Brunswick-Kalenberg, #Margaret (1511‚Äì1577), in 1530 married George I, Duke of Pomerania, #John (1513‚Äì1571), Margrave of Brandenburg- K√ºstrin.

General background  From a holistic perspective, corrosion is the phenomenon of metals returning to the state they are found in nature. The driving force that causes metals to corrode is a consequence of their temporary existence in metallic form. To produce metals starting from naturally occurring minerals and ores, it is necessary to provide a certain amount of energy, e.g. iron ore in a blast furnace. It is therefore thermodynamically inevitable that these metals when exposed to various environments would revert to their state found in nature. Corrosion and corrosion engineering thus involves a study of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics and electrochemistry. Generally related to Metallurgy or Materials Science, corrosion engineering also relates to non-metallics including ceramics, cement, Composite material and conductive materials such as carbon / graphite. Corrosion Engineers often manage other not-strictly- corrosion processes including (but not restricted to) cracking, brittle fracture, crazing, fretting, erosion, and more typically categorized as Infrastructure asset management. In the 1990s, Imperial College London even offered a Master of Science degree entitled \\"The Corrosion of Engineering Materials\\". UMIST - University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology and now part of the University of Manchester also offered a similar course. Corrosion Engineering master's degree courses are available worldwide and the curricula contains study material about the control and understanding of corrosion. In the year 1995, it was reported that the costs of corrosion nationwide in the USA were nearly $300 billion per year. This confirmed earlier reports of damage to the world economy caused by corrosion. Corrosion engineering groups have formed around the world to educate, prevent, slow, and manage corrosion. These include the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE), the European Federation of Corrosion (EFC), and The Institute of Corrosion in the UK. The corrosion engineer's main task is to economically and safely manage the effects of corrosion on materials. Zaki Ahmad in his book \\"Principles of corrosion engineering and corrosion control\\" states that \\"Corrosion engineering is the application of the principles evolved from corrosion science to minimize or prevent corrosion\\". Shreir et al. suggest likewise in their large 2 volume work titled Corrosion. Corrosion engineering involves designing of corrosion prevention schemes and implementation of specific codes and practices. Corrosion prevention measures, including Cathodic protection, designing to prevent corrosion and coating of structures fall within the regime of corrosion engineering. However, corrosion science and engineering go hand-in-hand and they cannot be separated: it is a permanent marriage to produce new and better methods of protection from time to time. This may include the use of Corrosion inhibitors. In the \\"Handbook of corrosion engineering\\", the author Pierre R. Roberge states \\"Corrosion is the destructive attack of a material by reaction with its environment. The serious consequences of the corrosion process have become a problem of worldwide significance\\". Some of the most notable contributors to the Corrosion Engineering discipline include among others: ‚Ä¢Michael Faraday (1791‚Äì1867) ‚Ä¢Marcel Pourbaix (1904‚Äì1998) ‚Ä¢Dr. Herbert H. Uhlig (1907‚Äì1993) ‚Ä¢Ulick Richardson Evans (1889‚Äì1980) ‚Ä¢Mars G. Fontana (1910‚Äì1988) ‚Ä¢Melvin Romanoff ‚Ä¢Pierre R. Roberge  Types of corrosion situations  Corrosion engineers and consultants tend to specialize in Internal or External corrosion scenarios. In both, they may provide corrosion control recommendations, failure analysis investigations, sell corrosion control products, or provide installation or design of corrosion control and monitoring systems. Every material has its weakness. Aluminum, galvanized/zinc coatings, brass, and copper do not survive well in very alkaline or very acidic pH environments. Copper and brasses do not survive well in high nitrate or ammonia environments. Carbon steels and iron do not survive well in low soil resistivity and high chloride environments. High chloride environments can even overcome and attack steel encased in normally protective concrete. Concrete does not survive well in high sulfate and acidic environments. And nothing survives well in high sulfide and low redox potential environments with corrosive bacteria.  External corrosion  Underground soil side corrosion = Underground corrosion control engineers collect soil samples to test soil chemistry for corrosive factors such as pH, minimum soil resistivity, chlorides, sulfates, ammonia, nitrates, sulfide, and redox potential. They collect samples from the depth that infrastructure will occupy, because soil properties may change from strata to strata. The minimum test of in-situ soil resistivity is measured using the Wenner four pin method if often performed to judge a site's corrosivity. However, during a dry period, the test may not show actual corrosivity, since underground condensation can leave soil in contact with buried metal surfaces more moist. This is why measuring a soil's minimum or saturated resistivity is important. Soil resistivity testing alone does not identify corrosive elements. Corrosion engineers can investigate locations experiencing active corrosion using above ground survey methods and design corrosion control systems such as cathodic protection to stop or reduce the rate of corrosion. Geotechnical engineers typically do not practice corrosion engineering, and refer clients to a corrosion engineer if soil resistivity is below 3,000 ohm-cm or less, depending the soil corrosivity categorization table they read. Unfortunately, an old dairy farm can have soil resistivities above 3,000 ohm-cm and still contain corrosive ammonia and nitrate levels that corrode copper piping or grounding rods. A general saying about corrosion is, \\"If the soil is great for farming, it is great for corrosion.\\" = Underwater external corrosion = Underwater corrosion engineers apply the same principals used in underground corrosion control but use specially trained and certified scuba divers for condition assessment, and corrosion control system installation and commissioning. The main difference being in the type of reference cells used to collect voltage readings. = Atmospheric corrosion = Prevention of atmospheric corrosion is typically handled by use of materials selection and coatings specifications. The use of zinc coatings also known as galvanization on steel structures is a form of cathodic protection and also a form of coating. Small scratches are expected to occur in the galvanized coating over time. The zinc being more active in the galvanic series corrodes in preference to the underlying steel and the corrosion products fil the scratch preventing further corrosion. As long as the scratches are fine, condensation moisture should not corrode the underlying steel as long as both the zinc and steel are in contact. As long as there is moisture, the zinc corrodes and eventually disappears.Side view Crow Hall Railway Bridge north of Preston Lancs corroding - general Corroding Steel Electrification Gantry = Humid and splash zone corrosion = bridge pilings to combat the corrosion that occurs when cracks in the pilings allow saltwater to contact internal steel reinforcement rods Structural member Blackpool Promenade at Bispham badly corroded A significant amount of corrosion of fences is due to landscaper tools scratching fence coatings and irrigation sprinklers spraying these damaged fences. Recycled water typically has a higher salt content than potable drinking water, meaning that it is more corrosive than regular tap water. The same risk from damage and water spray exists for above ground piping and backflow preventers. Fiberglass covers, cages, and concrete footings have worked well to keep tools at an arm's length. Even the location where your roof drain splashes down can matter. Drainage from a home's roof valley can fall directly down onto a gas meter causing its piping to corrode at an accelerated rate reaching 50% wall thickness within 4 years. It is the same effect as a splash zone in the ocean, or in a pool with lot of oxygen and agitation that removes material as it corrodes. Tanks or structural tubing such as bench seat supports or amusement park rides can accumulate water and moisture if the structure does not allow for drainage. This humid environment can then lead to internal corrosion of the structure affecting the structural integrity. The same can happen in tropical environments leading to external corrosion. = Galvanic corrosion = See main article Galvanic corrosion Galvanic corrosion (also called bimetallic corrosion) is an electrochemical process in which one metal (more active one) corrodes preferentially when it is in electrical contact with another dissimilar metal, in the presence of an electrolyte. A similar galvanic reaction is exploited in primary cells to generate a useful electrical voltage to power portable devices - a classic example being a cell with zinc and copper electrodes. Galvanic corrosion happens when there are an active metal and a more noble metal in contact in the presence of electrolyte. = Pitting corrosion = See main article Pitting corrosion and Pitting resistance equivalent number Pitting corrosion, or pitting, is extremely localized corrosion that leads to the creation of small holes in the material - nearly always a metal. The failures resulting from this form of corrosion can be catastrophic. With general corrosion it is easier to predict the amount of material that will be lost over time and this can be designed into the engineered structure. Pitting, like crevice corrosion can cause a catastrophic failure with very little loss of material. Pitting corrosion happens for passive materials. = Crevice corrosion = See main article Crevice corrosion Crevice corrosion is a type of localized corrosion with a very similar mechanism to pitting corrosion. = Stress corrosion cracking = See main article Stress corrosion cracking Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is the growth of a crack in a Corrosioncorrosive environment. It requires three conditions to take place: 1)corrosive environment 2)stress 3)susceptible material. SCC can lead to unexpected sudden and hence catastrophic failure of normally ductile metals under tensile stress. This is usually exacerbated at elevated temperature. SCC is highly chemically specific in that certain alloys are likely to undergo SCC only when exposed to a small number of chemical environments. It is common for SCC to go undetected prior to failure. SCC usually quite progresses rapidly after initial crack initiation, and is seen more often in alloys as opposed to pure metals. The corrosion engineer thus must be aware of this phenomenon. = Filiform Corrosion = Filiform corrosion may be considered as a type of crevice corrosion and is sometimes seen on metals coated with an organic coating (paint). Filiform corrosion on painted aluminum = Corrosion fatigue = See main article Corrosion fatigue = Microbial corrosion = See main article Microbial corrosion = High Temperature corrosion = See main article High-temperature corrosion  Internal corrosion  Internal corrosion is occasioned by the combined effects and severity of four modes of material deterioration, namely: general corrosion, pitting corrosion, microbial corrosion, and fluid corrosivity.O. Olabisi, S. Al-Sulaiman, A. Jarragh, & S. Abraham,\\"Ranking Pipeline Leakage Susceptibility\\", Materials Performance, Vol. 57, No. 6, June 2018 The same principals of external corrosion control can be applied to internal corrosion but due to accessibility, the approaches can be different. Thus special instruments for internal corrosion control and inspection are used that are not used in external corrosion control. Video scoping of pipes and high tech smart pigs are used for internal inspections. The smart pigs can be inserted into a pipe system at one point and \\"caught\\" far down the line. The use of corrosion inhibitors, material selection, and internal coatings are mainly used to control corrosion in piping while anodes along with coatings are used to control corrosion in tanks. Internal corrosion challenges apply to the following: \\\\- Water pipe corrosion \\\\- Gas pipe corrosion \\\\- Oil pipe corrosion \\\\- Water tank reservoir corrosion  Good design to prevent corrosion situations  Corrosion engineering involves good design. Using a rounded edge rather than an acute edge reduces corrosion, as does not coupling by welding or other joining method, two dissimilar metals to avoid galvanic corrosion. Avoiding having a small anode (or anodic material) next to a large cathode (or cathodic material) is good practice. As an example, weld material should always be more noble than the surrounding material. Stainless steel should not be used to handle deoxygenated solutions as the stainless steel relies on oxygen to maintain passivation.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Baka≈Çarzewo. It lies approximately west of Suwa≈Çki and north of the regional capital Bia≈Çystok. The village has a population of 820. Bakalarzewo was founded in early 16th century, among dense forests of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. At that time, it was called Dowspuda Bakalarzewska or Bakalarszczyzna, but by the second half of the 16th century, it was commonly called Bakalarzewo. It owes its name to the nickname of Mikolaj ‚ÄúBakalarz‚Äù Michnowicz, royal writer and one of founders of the town. By 1558 Bakalarzewo had already had a town charter, with a mayor, a vogt and a starosta. In 1609, local nobleman Mikolaj Wolski funded an altar for the town church: the altar still exists. In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries Bakalarzewo remained a small, private town. Following the Partitions of Poland it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia (1795), and after the Congress of Vienna (1815) it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, where it remained until World War One. In 1870, as a punishment for the January Uprising, Russian authorities reduced Bakalarzewo to the status of a village. In early 20th century, Bakalarzewo had the population of 2,000, with a large Jewish community. In the Second Polish Republic, the village belonged to Bialystok Voivodeship. In 1927, a complex of a new school was built, in 1936 a new church, and in 1937, office building by the market square. During World War Two nearly 90 % of all Bakalarzewo building were destroyed by 1945, it was an important center of the Home Army, and on May 25, 1944, German soldiers killed 12 Home Army members.

A composite of multiple real-world locations on the historic U.S. Route 66 from Chicago to Los Angeles, it is most prominently featured in the original 2006 film, and is home to a majority of the franchise's characters. A section of the Disney California Adventure theme park is based upon the setting. Vicinity \\"Ramone's\\" is based on the U-Drop Inn in Shamrock, Texas The town of Radiator Springs is situated in northwest Arizona, 87 miles from the state border of California, Nevada and 43 miles from Utah. Radiator Springs' position in relation to I-40, as shown on a map during a flashback in the 2006 film, is similar to that of Peach Springs on Arizona State Route 66. The village is a composite of multiple locations; before making the film, Pixar sent a group of fifteen artists with Carburetor County sheriff and Oklahoma historian Michael Wallis as guide to take photos, talk to Route 66 people and learn the history of tiny towns along more than 1200 miles of road through five states. In one restaurant, John Lasseter ordered one of every item on the menu for the Pixar group and spent four hours talking to the owner, absorbing information on the efforts to rebuild the historic byway to its neon-lit heyday. Lasseter told film critic Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that much of the story is based on the recollections of barber Angel Delgadillo in the Route 66 town of Seligman, Arizona, where business withered soon after the opening of I-40. Much of the film is based on research trips to visit automakers and NASCAR tracks in the United States. Flo's V8 caf√© is designed to look like a V8 engine head on, with a circular air filter, tappet covers, spark plugs, pistons and connecting rods as the supports for the shelter. The blinking neon lights on the spark plugs blink in the firing order of a Ford flathead V8. Route 66 Wigwam Motel in Holbrook, Arizona Many characters and places in the film are directly inspired by real Route 66 places and people. To quote the Pixar crew: : \\"As we traveled on Route 66, we were privileged to visit many places and to meet a number of people who live and work alongside 'The Mother Road'. The following is a list of the places and people we wanted to honor by including their names in our 'Special Thanks' credits at the end of the film.\\" Among the many references to Route 66 landmarks and personalities: * The Cozy Cone Motel's design is based on the two Wigwam Motels along Route 66, in Holbrook, Arizona and Rialto, California. These were once two out of seven built motels, with individual cabins shaped like teepees. Three Wigwam Motels remain; the third (and oldest) is in Cave City, Kentucky, far from Route 66. The recently restored Tee Pee Motel in Wharton, Texas, south of Houston, is of similar design but unrelated. The name \\"Cozy Cone\\" was inspired by the Cozy Dog Drive- In of Springfield, Illinois, which lays claim to being the birthplace of the corn dog. * The character \\"Fillmore\\", referring to the famous San Francisco music venue The Fillmore, was at one time to be named \\"Waldmire\\" after Bob Waldmire, a self-proclaimed hippie artist known to Rt. 66 fans for his detailed pen-and-ink maps and postcards of the route. Though Waldmire's family owns the Cozy Dog Drive-In, Bob, having since become a vegan, preferred not to see his name put on a character that would become a McDonald's Happy Meal toy. * Ramone's House of Body Art is based primarily on the U-Drop Inn in Shamrock, Texas. It opened in 1936 as Tower Conoco (from its distinctive Art Deco spire) with the U-Drop Inn Cafe and a retail building attached. Many other establishments built along Route 66 in its heyday had Art Deco elements that might be reflected in the design of Ramone's. * The mountain is Tucumcari Mountain in Tucumcari, New Mexico with the hand-painted 'T' replaced by 'RS' for Radiator Springs. The neon \\"100% Refrigerated Air\\" on the Cozy Cone Motel is a reference to the Blue Swallow Motel in Tucumcari. * Lizzie's Curio Shop in Radiator Springs resembles the Route 66 jumble of memorabilia and knick- knacks at Hackberry General Store in Hackberry, Arizona and the Sand Hills Curiosity Shop, aka the City Meat Market building in Erick, Oklahoma. The yellow billboard for Lizzie's Curio Shop reading \\"HERE IT IS\\" with an image of a Model T is based on the Jack Rabbit Trading Post signage in Joseph City, Arizona. * Sheriff is voiced by Michael Wallis, an American historian and author of Route 66: The Mother Road. * The characters \\"Flo\\" and \\"Sally\\" are based on Fran Houser of the Midpoint Caf√© and Dawn Welch of the Rock Caf√© respectively. * The bridge that McQueen sees Sally driving on resembles several bridges on Route 66, including the Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge in Tulsa, the Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena, California, and the now-closed bridge over Diablo Canyon at Two Guns, Arizona. *The character Tex Dinoco isn't a Route 66 resident, but was inspired by the Cadillacs horns at The Big Texan Steak Ranch. *Part of the inspiration for Mater was Dean Walker of the Route 66 Association. He is known as the \\"Crazy Backwards Walker\\"; he can twist his feet and walk backwards. Another inspiration for Mater was the 1951 tow truck, now owned by CARS on the ROUTE. The epilogue shows a map of the area of Arizona around Radiator Springs, including car-related place names such as \\"Carburetor County\\" and \\"Cadillac Range\\". The latter is a large north- to-south mountain range with many fin-backed jagged peaks, a reference to the famous Cadillac Ranch sculpture in Amarillo, Texas. Where the main road crosses the Cadillac Range is marked \\"Tailfin Pass 5942\\" (i.e. feet altitude, = 1.8111 kilometers). Continuity There are a few sights of the front page of a newspaper named The Daily Exhaust, which serves primarily as a vehicle to explain the NASCAR history behind the Fabulous Hudson Hornet of the early 1950s. During the 2006 film's closing credits, the characters are at a drive-in watching clips of the Pixar films \\"Toy Car Story\\" (Toy Story), \\"Monster Trucks, Inc.\\" (Monsters, Inc.) and \\"Bug\\" as in Volkswagen Beetle (A Bug's Life), whose characters have been rendered as vehicles in the style of Cars. Mack the red Mack Super-Liner comments that \\"they're just using the same actor over and over\\", an in-joke referring to John Ratzenberger, who voiced Mack and characters featured in the clips. The cinema itself is similar in design to an NRHP-listed 66 Drive-In in Carthage, Missouri, but without the later addition of widescreen and FM radio. The group of small birds from the 2000 Pixar short film For the Birds made a cameo appearance in Cars. As Mack is en route to California at 17:44 in the film, the group of small birds can briefly be seen (and heard) sitting on their familiar telephone wire. In addition, the Pizza Planet truck from Toy Story also makes a cameo outside of the race track, at the final race in the movie. Other settings The rail grade crossing at which Lightning McQueen outruns a freight train on his way to Radiator Springs is protected by a pair of antique \\"upper-quadrant\\" wigwag crossing signals which accurately depict those once made by the Magnetic Signal Company in both appearance and start-up. Few are left in actual operation in the United States, and many have been replaced with modern crossing gates, red lights and bells. \\"Ornament Valley\\" is a reference to Monument Valley. This is not on Route 66, but is a side trip in northern Arizona. Willy's Butte resembles the landmark of Mexican Hat, Utah, but also resembles a classic Pontiac hood ornament. The track on which the opening race (Motor Speedway of the South) takes place is based on an enlarged version of Bristol Motor Speedway. The venue for the Piston Cup tiebreaker race (the Los Angeles International Speedway) is a conglomeration of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena where the Rose Bowl is located, as well as the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana. The sign \\"City of Emeryville ‚Äì Closed for the race\\" is a nod to Pixar's headquarters in Emeryville, California in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Its aim is to promote discussions between prehistorians, archaeologists and anthropologists whose field of research goes from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus, from central Asia to the Persian Gulf, as well as specialists of various disciplines related to the evolution of Man in his natural environment from the Palaeolithic period to the Early Bronze Age. Pal√©orient publishes biannually review papers, information notes and book reviews ‚Äì mainly in English and in French, and some of the issues are thematic. Pal√©orient is an internationally recognized journal presently distributed in over 22 countries, it is the apposite media for presenting and discussing research progress in all the fields of prehistory and protohistory from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus.  History  Pal√©orient was founded in 1973 by Jean Perrot and Bernard Vandermeersch with the help of the Wener Gren Foundation and was first published by Klincksiek Editions (1973) and later by the Association Pal√©orient (1974-1975). In 1975 Pal√©orient became a journal of the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique); it is presently published by CNRS √âditions. Between 1973 and 1992 the Journal was taken in by the Laboratoire de pal√©ontologie des vert√©br√©s et de pal√©ontologie humaine at the Universit√© Paris VI, and from 1997 by the Maison de l‚Äôarch√©ologie et de l‚Äôethnologie Ren√© Ginouv√®s, which was renamed Maison des Sciences de l‚ÄôHomme Mondes in 2020. The idea of founding a journal dedicated to the prehistory and the protohistory of southwestern Asia was spawned among a group of various CNRS researchers exploring common thematics in several parts of the Near and Middle-East since the early sixties. Then, communication difficulties across borders were enhanced by the lack of publication means that could promote discussions between archaeologists and prehistorians, and with biologists, geologists, geophysicists, chemists. Pal√©orient has filled in this gap and continues to overcome these difficulties. For twenty years, researchers from around the world (Europe, Arab countries, Israel, US, central Asia, Australia, Japan) have been consistently publishing the results of their work as well as more theoretical synthetic papers on the most ancient past of this region. Pal√©orient has thus become a media in which various intellectual traditions and scientific trends meet.  Editorial policy  Submitted manuscripts should be original and unpublished. Peer-reviewing is carried out by at least three reviewers (two specialists, one non-specialist) chosen among the Scientific and Editorial Committees and/or specialists of the subject if deemed necessary. Reviewers remain anonymous throughout the editorial process. Evaluation of the manuscript rests on both the reviewers‚Äô expert assessments and Pal√©orient‚Äôs own evaluation grid (on-line). Accepted papers are published within a relatively short time frame given the rigorous and anonymous validation procedure of peer-reviewing which ensures Pal√©orient‚Äôs level of scientific excellence. The entire journal is available online ‚Äì with a two- year moving wall Ã∂Ã∂ through the public free portal Pers√©e that was launched with the help of the French Minist√®re de l‚Äô√âducation nationale, de l‚ÄôEnseignement sup√©rieur et de la Recherche, where the most prestigious French journals in Humanities and Social Sciences can be found. There is also an online access to Pal√©orient through the Jstor platform (also with a two-year moving wall). Pal√©orient is currently awaiting admission to OpenEdition Journals.

He was appointed captain on 13 May 1899.Royal Navy Flag Officers 1904 - 1975 He fought in the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 as flag captain to Rear-Admiral Sir James Andrew Thomas Bruce and commander of HMS Barfleur (1899‚Äì1902). It was announced in the 1902 Coronation Honours that he would be appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) dated 26 June 1902, and he received the actual decoration after his return home, from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902. He was captain of HMS Lancaster in the Mediterranean between 1904 and 1905, followed by the command of HMS Carnavon, also in the Mediterranean from 1905.

He was promoted to Vice-Admiral on 4 June 1913. 1914 Kiel Review In June 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War his squadron visited the German naval port of Kiel, during the annual regatta attended by Kaiser Wilhelm II and senior German admirals. The objective was to show off the modern British ships, and also inspect the German fleet. During the week-long visit, news arrived of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Warrender's final message of farewell, in line with the spirit of the visit and the welcome which they had received, was Friends in the past, friends forever.'Dreadnought' p.849-853 During his tour, a German officer, Lieutenant George von Hase, was selected to accompany Warrender and act as his aide and translator. Hase was required to write a report about Warrender and other British officers he met, and later wrote a book describing the visit. He described Warrender as clean shaven and good looking, with an aristocratic face and fine blue eyes. He seemed around 50 with greying hair, but retained the vigour of a younger man. He appeared self-possessed and decided and was popular amongst his men because of his care for their concerns. Business was handled with short orders and short replies, so that despite an absence of military formalities everything was done professionally. Warrender was noticeably deaf: He could understand his staff without problem, but could sometimes have difficulty with other officers and strangers, particularly in a noisy environment such as a party. At dinner, seated with the Kaiser unfortunately on his deaf side, he had difficulty maintaining the conversation. He was reputed to be a good tennis player and splendid golfer. The Admiral's wife accompanied him on the visit, staying on board the Hamburg- Amerika liner Viktoria Luise, which was customarily berthed in Kiel every year for Kiel week. This ship became the centre of high society for the occasion. There was a hectic round of social engagements, where the admiral had to be whisked between simultaneous events so as to be seen attending. Sporting competitions were arranged between British and German teams. Hase noted that the Germans won most of the events, except for football. He described the British sailors as noticeably small, while 70 men from George V were under 17 and he considered that there was a disproportionate number of older men. German and British ships saluting the Kaiser, 24 June 1914 Hase was instructed by Warrender to convey an invitation to Admiral von Ingenohl for any German officers who wished to visit and inspect the British ships. Ingenohl declined, on the grounds that he was forbidden to show visitors many parts of his ships. Warrender responded that, of course, some parts of British ships would also be off-limits and that he understood such restrictions, so visits were eventually arranged. British officers were only allowed to visit the older Deutschland class battleships, while important installations on British ships were covered. However, Hase reported that he was friendly with Commander Brownrigg, the gunnery officer, was happy to show him around almost all the ship, except for the 'firing director' which was regarded as strictly secret. Lord Brassey, who had arrived at Kiel on his own yacht, managed to become lost, and was found wandering in the secret submarine yard. On the afternoon of 28 June news arrived of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, who had been a friend of the British ambassador to Germany, Edward Goschen, who was also staying on George V. A discussion ensued at which Hase was present, where Warrender warned of the likelihood that many European countries would now be drawn into a war. Social engagements were cancelled, although the regatta events were completed. Early the following morning the Kaiser departed for Vienna. The day continued on a somber note, with lunch on board George V for German admirals. Afterwards these were invited to tour the ship, but only Admiral Ingenohl and his officers accepted, and were given a demonstration of the main guns operating. Later Warrender attended a party given by British sailors for their German counterparts in return for the welcome they had received. Warrender was welcomed by a wave of thunderous stamping, and jumped onto a table to give a speech about friendship between the two nations. Three cheers were given for the German Navy, before Rear Admiral Mauwe climbed on the table to respond and call three cheers for the British. The room once again resounded to stamping approval. In the evening Warrender attended the official Imperial Yacht club dinner, now presided over by Prince Henry, in the Kaiser's absence.Hase p. 55-59 Hase commented on conversations with Warrender about the consequences of submarines on warfare. Although Warrender did not agree with views expressed by Admiral Percy Scott that submarines would bring an end to Britain's control of the seas, he did agree that in future close blockade would be impossible. He observed that the preparation of Scapa Flow as a long range naval base for the blockade of Germany, had been suggested by German officers.Hase p. 59 First World War Shortly after the Kiel visit Warrender temporarily commanded the Grand Fleet ordered to move to Scapa Flow after annual exercises, when a declaration of war was considered imminent. Warrender was considered a good admiral during peacetime, but his reputation suffered as the war proceeded. His squadron was regarded as one of the best trained in gunnery in the fleet. He was described by Commodore William Goodenough as having an imperturbability that no circumstances could ruffle, although others ascribed this stolidity to simply a lack of initiative.'Castles' p.335 citing Goodenough p. 86 One of the battleships in his command, HMS Audacious, sank after striking a mine when at sea for gunnery practice in October 1914. He commanded a British squadron of six battleships, four battlecruisers, cruisers and destroyers which attempted to intercept Admiral Hipper following Hipper's raid on Scarborough. Hipper escaped, some of his ships slipping past Warrender despite being spotted and coming within range of his superior force. First Sea Lord Fisher wanted Warrender replaced for his poor performance, but Warrender was a friend of Admiral John Jellicoe commanding the Grand Fleet, who kept him in his post because of his past experience handling large fleets. Warrender was also suffering from increasing deafness and was replaced in December 1915. He became Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth in March 1916, but asked for retirement in December 1916Admirals.org because of increasingly poor health. He died in January 1917, was cremated at Golders Green on 12 January and his ashes placed at the Church of the Annunciation, Bryanston Street, London. Family One of his sisters, Alice Warrender, founded the Hawthornden Prize. He married Lady Ethel Maud Ashley Cooper, daughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury, on 6 February 1894 at St. Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, London. He had three children, Sir Victor Alexander George Anthony Warrender 8th Bt., 1st Baron Bruntisfield (1942), Harold John Warrender and Violet Helen Marie Warrender.

Halabi's body was found in 2012 on Mount Carmel and he was buried in Isfiya with full military honors.  Background  Halabi was born in 1985 to Nazmi Halabi, an employee at the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, and Fahmiya Halabi, in the Druze village of Daliyat al-Karmel, located on Mount Carmel. Halabi began his mandatory military service in the IDF in the Israeli Air Force at a Be'er sheva campus of the Israeli Air And Space technical college but had difficulties serving at the place and as a result he lowered his Medical Profile and was transferred to serve in a vehicle workshop of the Ordnance Corps, at a maintenance and rehabilitation () base located near Haifa. When Halabi asked to raise his Medical Profile back in order to be transferred back to his old unit he was refused. During his military service Halabi became an absentee several times from the military bases in which he served.  The disappearance and search efforts  Halabi disappeared on Tuesday, May 24, 2005, while he attempted to hitchhike from his village to his Ordnance Corps camp near Tirat Carmel, without carrying any weapons. At the time of his disappearance, he had served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for five months. In his parents testimony given afterwards they claimed that he was last seen in civilian clothes and that he took with him a small bag, in which he presumably carried his IDF uniform. Nevertheless, additional witnesses claimed to have seen him in uniform. A witness from Halabi's village stated that he saw Halabi around 15:30 at the grocery store of the village, buying a beverage can, and further investigation revealed that he had pulled out 50 NIS from an ATM in his village before his disappearance. Various officers involved in the case claimed after the fact that there were a number of contradictions in the testimonies of his family members regarding his apparel, and the day and time he was last seen.http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3092695,00.html Two days after his disappearance, Halabi's commanding officers visited his home in order to inquire about his whereabouts. As a result, and a search was launched by Halabi's family, aided by Halabi's friends and the various residents of Daliyat al-Karmel. Searches were conducted in the village, on nearby beaches, in Haifa and in the Krayot and in the forests of Mount Carmel. The searches were even expanded later on to Tiberias and Eilat, after the family received information that someone similar to Halabi was seen in those cities. Throughout his first week of disappearance the IDF did not assist the family in their searches for Halabi. The local media reported in many occasions about the disappearance and the search efforts, but the matter got almost no exposure in the national media outlets. This fact was later on severely criticized by many officials, among them the head of the Druze community in Israel, Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif. On 30 May 2005, a week after his disappearance, the IDF officially declared Halabi as absent. Halabi's family was furious over the military's delay in announcing that he was his missing, as they requested that he would be declared as such already in the evening in which it was first discovered that had disappeared. Following the declaration, the IDF launched a massive search effort that involved the use of regular and reserve IDF troops, sniffer dogs from the Oketz Unit, and drones equipped with thermal imaging systems. The area where his body was eventually found was combed repeatedly, but it was not found due to the thickness of the forest and mountainous terrain.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4291274,00.html More than one hundred volunteers participated in search efforts in the Mount Carmel area. Halabi was formally declared to be missing in action (MIA) on June 6. Throughout the following years, police established several teams to investigate his disappearance.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4291036,00.html Compared to Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Halabi's disappearance received relatively little coverage in the Israeli media. According to a 2007 article in Israel Today, his case was \\"all but forgotten\\" nationally and internationally. As part of the effort to find any information that would eventually lead to solving the mystery of his absence, his family offered a reward for any information that would be given of his whereabouts, and the organization Born to Freedom Foundation, that aims to accelerate the release of IDF POWs and missing soldiers, began publishing the case widely in order to bring public awareness to Halabi's disappearance. Subsequently, the Born to Freedom Foundation offered a reward of USD10,000,000 for information leading to Halabi's location.  Later developments  On May 24, 2007, the two-year anniversary of Halabi's disappearance, Halabi's family and residents of Carmel City held a gathering to raise awareness of Halabi's case and call for increased efforts to locate him. The event was attended by a large crowd, including many Druze military officers, the Defense Minister Amir Peretz, and Karnit Goldwasser (the wife of the kidnapped IDF soldier Ehud Goldwasser) whom spoke in the event, and Zvi Regev who is the father of the kidnapped soldier Eldad Regev. Defense Minister Amir Peretz stated in the event that he had been in contact with the family on a weekly basis in order to encourage the family.◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™ - ◊ë◊ê◊®◊• nrg - ◊©◊†◊™◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊î◊ô◊¢◊ú◊û◊ï ◊©◊ú ◊û◊í'◊ì◊ô ‚Äì ◊ï◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊ß◊¶◊î ◊ó◊ï◊ò The families of the three IDF soldiers kidnapped in the 2000 Hezbollah cross-border raid, whom also attended the event, also expressed their support of Halabi's family. In a 2007 interview with The Jerusalem Post, Halabi's uncle, Samih Halabi, a retired IDF colonel and chairman of the Campaign to Find Missing Soldier Majdi Halabi, expressed the belief that Halabi had been abducted by an Islamic \\"terrorist organization\\" and was \\"being held in Syria, Lebanon or possibly even in Nablus or Jenin in the West Bank\\". On July 2, 2008, Halabi's family received a telephone call from an inmate in Damon Prison who claimed that Halabi had been abducted and was being held in the vicinity of Nablus in the West Bank. Police officials maintained that the inmate had \\"no substantial information\\" regarding Halabi's disappearance, but the Halabi family disputed this claim. In 2010, the killer of 18-year-old Danna Bennett, Yahya Adwan Farhan (◊ô◊ó◊ô◊ê ◊¢◊ì◊ï◊ê◊ü ◊§◊®◊ó◊ê◊ü), stated in an interview with Ma'ariv that he knows what caused the disappearance of Majdi Halabi, but declined to provide further information. In 2011, Halabi's brother, Adham Nazmi Halabi, 21, was killed in a traffic accident in Daliyat al-Karmel. He had been serving in the Israel Border Police at the time of his death.◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™ 2 - ◊î◊ò◊®◊í◊ì◊ô◊î ◊î◊õ◊§◊ï◊ú◊î ◊©◊ú ◊û◊©◊§◊ó◊™ ◊ó◊ú◊ë◊ô: ◊û◊í'◊ì◊ô ◊†◊¢◊ì◊®, ◊ê◊ì◊î◊ù ◊†◊î◊®◊í In April 2012, it was reported that two prisoners serving sentences for murder and drug-related offenses were negotiating a plea bargain to supply the burial location of Halabi in return for being freed as well as a few hundred thousand shekels. Discovery of body In the aftermath of the 2010 Carmel Fire, Halabi's family asked that the search be resumed, as the forest floor was more exposed. On 10 October 2012, his body was found in a forest near Isfiya. Halabi's childhood friend, Ibrahim Kozly of Daliyat al- Karmel, discovered his body while performing clearing work for the Jewish National Fund as part of the Carmel Forest's rehabilitation project. Halabi's body became visible after he removed tree debris from the area. A knife was discovered near the body.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4291377,00.html The body was transferred to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv, where DNA testing confirmed that it was Halabi's.◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™ 2 - ◊§◊®◊©◊™ ◊î◊ô◊¢◊ú◊û◊ï◊™◊ï ◊©◊ú ◊û◊í'◊ì◊ô ◊ó◊ú◊ë◊ô - ◊©◊ú◊ë ◊ê◊ó◊® ◊©◊ú◊ë Halabi was buried in Isfiya's military cemetery with full military honors on October 12, 2012, in a funeral that saw over 2,000 people in attendance.Israel TV News  Missing soldier Majdi Halabi is laid to rest - JerusalemOnline.com  See also  * Israeli MIAs * Tapuah Junction stabbing (2010)  References  Category:1985 births Category:2000s deaths Category:Druze people of Israeli nationality Category:Israeli soldiers Category:People from Daliyat al-Karmel ","title":"Majdi Halabi"},{"id":"18666113","text":"Agrafin√≥wka is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Filip√≥w, within Suwa≈Çki County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.

His performances fuse comedy, storytelling and magic with writing that led Robert Newman to describe him as \\"a natural performer, witty, inventive, stylish and original\\", and Time Out to comment, \\"Nathan Penlington's fusion of wit, storytelling and visuals are [sic] garnering critics' plaudits and attention.\\" Penlington was co-organiser and resident host of London's weekly spoken word venue Shortfuse, from April 2000 to September 2007, with its reputation for an eclectic fusion of stand-up poetry, performance comedy and music, and presenting up-and-coming performers alongside established names such as John Hegley, Stewart Lee, Kevin Eldon and Simon Munnery, while forging links with performers across the US, Canada and Europe. Shortfuse became renowned for new formats, including Bards in their Eyes, Speed Cabaret, and Poetry Idol. The tongue-in-cheek Poetry Idol helped many up-and-coming poets and performers, including Scroobius Pip, Stephen Howarth, Suzanne Andrade, Joshua Idehen and Musa Okwanga. Penlington has produced and hosted events for various festivals, including the Edinburgh International Film Festival, Brick Lane, Stoke Newington, and Whitstable Arts Biennale. Through September 2007 he was Festival Director for Write to Ignite ‚Äì Hackney Word Festival. In 2005, Penlington gave his d√©but full-length, solo spoken-word show If My Life Hadn't Turned Out Differently at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe at the Pleasance, after previewing it at Chicago's Drinking & Writing Festival, and in various New York venues, including the Bowery Poetry Club. The following year he made his fifth consecutive appearance at the festival, teaming up with two other spoken-word artists, Rhian Edwards and Suzanne Andrade, for a show called Invisible Ink, which fused magic, music, poetry and animation. Penlington's next show ‚Äì Uri & Me, an obsessive deconstruction of the spoon bending cultural icon Uri Geller ‚Äì was described as \\"a thoughtfully constructed, funny, yet litigation avoiding look at the life and work of a global celebrity phenomenon\\" by the Londonist. A combination of stand-up, magic and spoken word, it premi√®red on commission at the London Word Festival in March 2010. It was also shown at the Camden Fringe, The Roundhouse, the Brighton Comedy Festival, the Oxford Literary Festival, Bristol Old Vic, and the Edinburgh Fringe 2011 at The Underbelly. The reviews included a four-star welcome in The Scotsman by Kate Copstick: \\"The best shows are driven by a personal passion\\". The show was twice attended by Geller. In 2013 Penlington started work on Choose Your Own Documentary which is inspired by the Choose Your Own Adventure phenomenon of the 1980s combining film, stand-up, and storytelling the show allows the audience to interact with the performance by using wireless remote controls to decide what happens next. With over 1500 permutations each performance is unique. The show was co-commissioned by the Southbank Centre, and supported by Arts Council England. His work has been broadcast on BBC Radio 3's The Verb, performing a work of 'predictive text poetry ‚Äì a new creative form using the mobile phone'. He has also appeared on BBC Radio 4's 28 Acts in 28 Minutes, and he has hosted three series of the surreal spoken word show Parlour Games on Resonance FM.

The fruits are consumed by humans and have a pleasant apple like flavor. The specific name infausta alludes to the misfortune believed to result from its use as firewood. Description The trees are low-branching and mostly smallish but may reach 8 m in height. They have drooping branchlets and have pale greyish brown, flaky bark. The fairly large, dull leaves have entire margins and are somewhat variable in shape. They have an opposite arrangement and conspicuous net-veining below. Young leaves are boat-shaped and recurved along the central vein. Dense clusters of robust green flowers develop from pointed buds in spring. Each velvety flower is about 4 mm long and 6 mm wide, and are carried on opposite and axillary cymes. The corolla is dropped early. The initially green and glossy fruit appear in summer, and bear the remains of the calyx around their tips. They develop into unevenly shaped, glossy, tan- coloured plums, that contain soft fleshy pulp and fairly large seeds. Range This shrub or small tree occurs in abundance in woodlands, scrub, valleys, stony kopjies, or sandy dunes throughout much of Southern and East Africa, including Madagascar. In Africa it is native to Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. It may be found from 350 to 1,330 m above sea level. Uses The African medlar is a traditional food plant in Africa. This little-known fruit has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable land care. The fruit are consumed raw or the pulp may be dried and stored for later use, while the seeds may be roasted. Goats and game browse on the leaves, while other animals may consume the fruit on the tree, or after they are shed on the ground. The roots and leaves are used by traditional healers. Thin twigs are prone to being populated by spittlebugs.

FGM has challenged the Israeli‚ÄìEgyptian blockade by sailing humanitarian aid ships to Gaza. The group has more than 70 endorsers, including Desmond Tutu and Noam Chomsky. The organizations participating in the Free Gaza Movement include the International Solidarity Movement. The activists participating in the effort include Jeff Halper, Hedy Epstein, Lauren Booth, and members of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religious organizations. Israeli intelligence agencies say that it also includes Islamist organizations that pose a security threat to Israel. Israel says Free Gaza Movement poses threat to Jewish state, Scott Wilson, Washington Post, June 1, 2010. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Turkey and Canada have all publicly opposed the 2011 flotilla.  Founding of the FGM  The Free Gaza Movement was founded in 2006 by Mary Hughes-Thompson, Greta Berlin, and Paul Larudee, all Californian peace activists. The three activists had previously worked for Palestinian human rights and been detained or deported by Israel. The Israel Defense Forces had prohibited Israeli journalists from entering Gaza since 2006. As a result little information was appearing in the Israeli media about the situation in Gaza.  August 2008 sailing  The first sailing took place in early August 2008. It was organized by the Free Gaza Movement and the International Solidarity Movement. Many of the latter's members had been barred from entering Israel on security grounds. According to the Free Gaza Movement's Web site, the group intended for the boat to cross the Israeli- declared \\"special security zone\\" to deliver 100 hearing aids to a Palestinian charity as a form of humanitarian aid. A story in Israel-based Haaretz said the organizers were attempting to provoke a clash with the navy that would end with arrests. A spokesman for the group said, \\"We hope that the Israeli government will have some wisdom. To drag us in and arrest us and say somehow we are a danger is absurd.\\" They raised $300,000 from private donations and purchased two vessels, the S.S. Liberty and the Free Gaza. The group originally planned to depart from Piraeus on August 1, 2008, stopping at several Greek islands, and to then sail from Cyprus to Gaza on August 5. Organizers of Free Gaza told interviewers that they were not attempting to sail from Egypt or via Egyptian waters because they \\"did not want to make a political statement\\" hinting that Egypt disagreed with the plan. Cypriot officials expressed concern about the boat departing from their shores but said they could not prevent it. The Israel Foreign Ministry offered to deliver the FGM's humanitarian aid by way of a land crossing under Israeli control. The FGM rejected the offer as it wanted to demonstrate to the world the control that Israel had over Gaza. On August 23 the two boats arrived in Gaza carrying 46 peace activists including four Israeli citizens. The Israeli Navy did not stop them but both boats had great difficulty with their communications, a problem they blamed on jamming by Israel in an attempt to prevent them from getting to Gaza. They delivered 200 hearing aids for Gaza children and 5,000 balloons. When the boats left Gaza they took seven Palestinians, including a teenage boy who had lost a leg to an Israeli tank shell. The boy could not be fitted with an artificial leg in Gaza as the Israeli siege had created shortages of medicine and medical equipment. The boats had no problem returning to Cyprus.  Consequences  Israeli citizen Jeff Halper did not return to Cyprus on the boats, but traveled into Israel via the Erez crossing. He was arrested and has been told he will be prosecuted for breaking the Israeli law forbidding its citizens from entering the Gaza Strip. Israeli police hold Gaza activist BBC 26 August 2008. A spokeswoman for the Free Gaza Movement believes that Israel‚Äôs foreign and interior ministries had given the boats permission to land in Gaza, and she believed that meant they were all in Gaza legally.Israeli arrested for entering Gaza Jerusalem Post (mirrored by Karmalised.com) 26 August 2008.

October 2008 sailing The second sailing occurred in late October. The movement's 66-foot yacht, named Dignity, arrived at a Gaza port on October 29. The ship carried 26 activists and medical supplies. Although Israeli officials initially announced that they would stop the ship, a last-minute decision was reportedly made to allow the ship to enter Gaza. Among the passengers were 1976 Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Corrigan and Palestinian Legislative Council member Mustafa Barghouti.Gaza activist boat docks , Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA), October 29, 2008. In July 2009, four citizens of the United Kingdom who had decided to stay in Gaza were turned away at both the Israeli and Egyptian border crossings over a period of several weeks when they attempted to leave. December 2008 ‚Äì February 2009 sailings The Free Gaza Movement attempted to reach Gaza twice during the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. On December 29, 2008, Dignity set sail from Cyprus, headed for Gaza, attempting to deliver of medical supplies to its residents. The boat, which was boarded by Caoimhe Butterly, Cynthia McKinney, journalists from Al Jazeera and CNN, three surgeons including Dr. Elena Theoharous, was forced to turn back after being intercepted by Israeli naval vessels off Gaza. According to The Free Gaza Movement, Israeli warships rammed their vessel then fired machine guns in the water. Israel states that the boat had failed to respond to Israeli naval radio contact and was attempting to outmaneuver the warships when the vessels collided. Not having enough fuel to return to Cyprus, the boat docked in Lebanon severely damaged.YNET Navy orders aid boat to Gaza to retreat, December 30, 2008 The Cypriot foreign minister told public radio his country would lodge a formal protest over the incident. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman called the allegation of ramming the Dignity \\"absurd\\" while denying any intent. The Consulate General of Israel to the Southeast USA called McKinney \\"irresponsible\\", accusing her of a \\"provocation\\" that endangered many. In January, the Free Gaza Movement again attempted to bring activists and deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza under the Greek flagged decommissioned ferry called the Arion. The 21 Free Gaza activists, among them several doctors, abandoned their journey after the ship encountered Israeli warships who warned them to leave the area. Greece had informed the Israeli government on its transfer of humanitarian aid days earlier, but also warned the leaders of the expedition about its dangers. The Dignity's final resting spot is in a Cyprian port after sinking during a storm. On February 3, 2009 a ship was sent by the Free Gaza Movement and a Lebanese group, the Palestinian National Committee Against the Siege. The organizers said the Tali, a Togo-registered cargo vessel, was \\"carrying more than 60 tonnes of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.\\" On February 5, shots were fired and Israeli forces boarded the ship. \\"They are pointing guns against us; they are kicking us and beating us. They are threatening our lives,\\" Al-Jazeera's Salam Khoder reported from aboard Tali. The ship was then taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod. According to Haaretz, \\"The IDF said that troops found about 150 bottles of mineral water and a few dozen kilograms of food and medicine on board... plus 10,000 units of human blood plasma which requires constant refrigeration. The IDF found no weapons aboard the ship.  June 2009 sailing  The Spirit of Humanity The Free Gaza Movement returned to Cyprus in March 2009, to begin organizing for the summer sailings. The Arion was renamed Spirit of Humanity and sailed from the port of Larnaca on June 29. The 21 activists on board included former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney and the Nobel Laureate Mairead Maguire. Among the six journalists were two from Al Jazeera and documentary maker Adam Shapiro. They were heading toward Gaza with three tons of medical supplies and a symbolic load of construction materials.Free Gaza boat stopped by Navy June 29, 2009 On June 30, the Israeli Navy commandeered the vessel off the coast of Gaza. The Israeli military later issued a statement saying the boat had attempted to break a blockade of Gaza and was forced to sail to an Israeli port after ignoring a radio message to stay out of Gaza waters. The Spirit of Humanity was towed to Ashdod and the crew was detained pending deportation proceedings. After a security check of the humanitarian supplies, Israel officials promised to deliver them to Gaza by ground. Greta Berlin, a representative of the Free Gaza Movement in Cyprus, said: \\"We are outraged, they just stole our boat and kidnapped our people.\\"Israel to deport peace activists sailing to Gaza (June 01, 2009) Israeli officials blame the group for the controversy, saying they were looking for confrontation to attract publicity. Two additional Israeli activists were released the next day. On July 3, five Bahraini activists were deported. A delegation from Bahrain visited Israel in an official capacity for the first time to accompany the deportees although officials said there was no other significance to the visit. McKinney and the others release was delayed after they refused to sign a document admitting they violated Israel‚Äôs blockade. From the Givon immigration detention center in Ramla, Maguire said that \\"deportation orders aren't appropriate for us, as we were taken to Israel against our will.\\"Mairead: My terror as Israelis seized aid boat, Belfast Telegraph, 3 July 2009. The remaining activists were processed and released between July 5 and July 8. May 2010 sailing Aengus √ì Snodaigh with the Rachel Corrie before departing for the Freedom Flotilla The Free Gaza Movement and the Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH) partnered to send multiple ships to the Gaza Strip in May 2010. Under the coordination of the Free Gaza Movement, numerous human rights organizations, including the Turkish Relief Foundation (IHH), the Perdana Global Peace Organization from Malaysia, the European Campaign to End the Siege of Gaza, and the Swedish and Greek Boat to Gaza initiatives sent three cargo ships loaded with reconstruction, medical and educational supplies. Multiple passenger boats with over 600 people on board accompanied the cargo ships. Passengers included members of Parliament from around the world, U.N., human rights and trade union activists, as well as journalists to document the largest coordinated effort to directly confront Israel‚Äôs blockade of Gaza and take in basic supplies. These include the MV Rachel Corrie. In response to the plans, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said: \\"These people are not supporting the Palestinians and they are not even supporting humanitarian causes. They are engaged in only one thing, and that is to create provocations and to collaborate with Hamas propaganda.\\" The family of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit offered the organizers of the flotilla full support provided that \\"in addition to their demand that Israel lift its blockade they will urge Hamas to allow the soldier to receive letters and food packages from his family and allow international organizations to visit him\\". According to Attorney Nick Kaufman, who approached the Free Gaza Movement on behalf of the kidnapped soldier's family the offer was refused. The group strongly denied this, saying they had always called for the release of all prisoners, including Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and that they had accepted Mr. Kaufman's request but had not heard back from him since. On May 27, 2010, The Jerusalem Post reported that participants included Mahmad Tzoalha and Sahar Albirawi, whom it called Hamas activists, although neither man was on any of the passenger manifests, as well as Sheikh Raed Salah, leader of the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel. Also some 700 pro-Palestinian activists were on the boats, including 1976 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corrigan Maguire of Northern Ireland, European legislators and Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstein, 85. The six-ship flotilla began the journey on May 30, 2010. Before dawn the following morning, the vessels came into contact with the Israeli navy in international waters off the coast of Gaza. The Aljazeera satellite channel reported by telephone from the Turkish ship leading the flotilla that Israeli navy forces fired at the \\"Blue Marmara Ship\\"(Mavi Marmara Gemisi) and boarded it. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says the soldiers were attacked with knives and clubs as they boarded. It says soldiers opened fire after a protester grabbed a weapon from one of the commandos and fired on one or more of the commandos. Organizers of the flotilla said the troops opened fire as soon as they stormed the ships. Reports are of up to 16 people being killed along with dozens of injuries. In August, the Israeli military arrested several Israeli soldiers, accusing them of selling laptops that belonged to the passengers.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3939471,00.html Free Palestine Movement Some organizers went on to found the Free Palestine Movement, notable for being frequently confused with the similarly-named Free Palestine Movement in Lebanon and Syria. Controversy In October 2012, Free Gaza Movement founder, Greta Berlin was accused of being antisemitic following a controversial tweet, originating from her Facebook account, and published under the account of the Free Gaza Movement. The tweet read ‚ÄúZionists operated the concentration camps and helped murder millions of innocent Jews\\" and contained a link to a video of that name, a speech by conspiracy theorist Eustace Mullins asserting that Zionists are responsible for the Holocaust and are admirers of Hitler. The Free Gaza Movement later deleted the tweet.Apology Regarding Tweet , Free Gaza Movement website. Berlin apologized once the post became known to a wider audience. She declared that she had \\"shared it without watching it,\\" and she implied no endorsement of Mullins' antisemitic views. She wrote she intended to post the video and comment in a private Facebook group where she had been participating in a discussion of similar propaganda. Larry Derfner published a statement by sixteen people stating that \\"ours is a small and secret Facebook group, 37 members strong\\" and that the group had been discussing \\"the role of the Zionist movement during the Holocaust\\" when Berlin posted her remarks. In response the Jewish Voice for Peace group, which was co-sponsoring one event with the Free Gaza Movement and Berlin backed out, while LA Jews for peace picked up the LA event and sponsored it.Jewish Voice for Peace Statement on Greta Berlin and Allegations of Anti-Semitism https://www.adl.org/blog/free-gaza-founder-embraced-by-jewish-groups-despite- recent-anti-semitic-tweet Reception Jeffrey Goldberg wrote that the Free Gaza Movement is \\"the leading edge of the international campaign to delegitimize Israel and bring about its end as the national home of the Jewish people,\\" and that they are \\"a hypocritical organization\\" he argues since they protest Israel's part of the blockade but not the Egyptian blockade of Gaza.Nazi Propaganda Makes a Comeback on Twitter References External links  * Free Gaza Website Category:Non-governmental organizations involved in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict Category:Nonviolent resistance movements Category:Gaza flotilla raid Category:Cynthia McKinney ","title":"Free Gaza Movement"},{"id":"18666524","text":"Rudniki is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Raczki, within Suwa≈Çki County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.

A panemone windmill is a type of vertical axis wind turbine. It has a rotating axis positioned vertically, while the wind-catching blades move parallel to the wind. By contrast, the shaft of a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) points into the wind while its blades move at right-angles to the wind's thrust. That is, a panemone primarily uses drag whereas the blades of a HAWT use lift. Historically the earliest known wind machine was made by the Persians and it was the panemone design, consisting of a wall, with slits, surrounding a vertical axle containing four to eight fabric sails. As the wind blew, the sails would turn the axle, which was in turn connected to grain grinders or some form of water transportation device (though little is known of the actual details of such methods). History The Persian horizontal windmill, the first practical windmill. The panemone design used by the Turks & Caicos islanders The earliest recorded windmill design found was Persian in origin, and was invented some time around 700-900 AD. This design was the panemone, with vertical lightweight wooden sails attached by horizontal struts to a central vertical shaft. It was first built to pump water, and subsequently modified to grind grain as well. Wind-powered machines may have been known earlier, but there is no clear evidence of windmills prior to the 9th century. A legendary account of the windmill attributed its invention to Pƒ´r≈´z NahƒÅvandi. Before becoming a slave to Rashidun caliph Umar, NahƒÅvandi was said to have designed and built windmills. In the 9th century, he brought a complaint to Umar about the high tax charged to him by his master Mughirah. Umar wrote to Mughirah and inquired about the tax; Mughirah's reply was satisfactory, but Umar held that the tax charged from Abu Lulu was reasonable, owing to his daily income. Umar then is reported to have asked Abu Lulu to design a windmill for him, in which Pƒ´r≈´z replies, \\"By God, I will build this [wind]mill of which the World will talk\\".RJ Forbes. Studies in ancient technology. Vol. 9. Brill, 1964. However, this account may have been a 10th-century amendment.Dietrich Lohrmann (199786543). \\"Von der √∂stlichen zur westlichen Windm√ºhle\\", Archiv f√ºr Kulturgeschichte 77 (1), p. 1-30 (8). The first clear evidence of vertical- axle windmills are dated to the 9th century, in the Persian region of Sistan (modern Iran and Afghanistan), as described by Muslim geographers.Ahmad Y Hassan, Donald Routledge Hill (1986). Islamic Technology: An illustrated history, p. 54. Cambridge University Press. . The windmill became widespread across the Islamic world, and later spread to India and China. Operation A panemone WEH with 8 airfoils The vanes of a panemone are moved by the wind in a circle to turn the drive shaft. To accomplish this they must move with the wind only while on one side of the circle, and move against the wind on the other side. To prevent the vanes moving upwind from being blown back by the wind, one half of the panemone may be shielded, or else the vanes may be attached so that they can turn edge-on to the wind when the wheel is moving them upwind. Efficiency Adding a windbarrier to one side increases efficiency Wind-harnessing devices which rely on drag reach their maximum efficiency if the collector is pushed away from the wind. Because the wind panels do no work while returning to the upwind side of the device, the rotor in the Persian panemone design can only take energy from wind striking half the collection area (see diagram). The panemone is one of the least efficient types of wind turbine. Despite this it is also one of the most commonly re- invented and patented forms.

The whistle tip is a small metal plate with a central hole that is welded into the inner tip of the exhaust pipe. As exhaust gases are forced through the exhaust system under pressure, they pass through the hole and generate a whistling sound similar to a steam locomotive whistle.

He subsequently attended Harvard University to earn his master's and doctorate degrees, and taught at both Wesleyan and Harvard. Greason began his Bowdoin career in 1952 as an instructor in English, becoming a full professor in 1966 with a specialty in 18th-century English literature. Greason served as both Dean of Students and Dean of the College before stepping down in 1975 to return to full-time teaching. Nevertheless, five years later, following the departure of President Willard F. Enteman, Greason was asked to serve as acting president. In the fall of 1981, he became the third faculty member at Bowdoin to become President of the College. Bowdoin College presidency During Greason's presidency, the college expanded its full-time teaching faculty from 100 to 125 and launched and successfully completed a $56 million capital campaign, the Campaign for Bowdoin. Additionally, the college constructed the Farley Field House, the Bowdoin College Swimming Pool, and the Campus Mall, which transformed the cross-campus access road into a pedestrian-friendly mall with an open-air stage, in response to concerns about through-traffic and parking hazards along that route.Anderson, Patricia McGraw, \\"The Back Campus and Mall,\\" in The Architecture of Bowdoin College (Brunswick, Maine: Bowdoin College Museum of Art, 1988), p. 83. Construction on the Hatch Science Library also began. Greason's curricular achievements included reinstating the course distribution requirements Bowdoin had abolished in 1970, establishing its Department of Computer Science, and instituting its Arctic Studies, Asian Studies and Women's Studies programs. In 1987, Greason asked a special panel to decide whether fraternities should be abolished at Bowdoin. His successor, Robert Hazard Edwards, ultimately effected that change. Honors Greason received honorary degrees from his alma mater, Wesleyan University, and from Bates College, Colby College, the University of New England, and the University of Maine at Presque Isle. After retiring from Bowdoin's presidency in 1990, the college \\"awarded him a Doctor of Humane Letters.\\"http://www.timesrecord.com/articles/2011/08/30/news/doc4e5baba7bc953768488951.txt Remembrance Following Greason's death at age 88, Bowdoin College President Barry Mills remembered him as follows on Bowdoin's website: ‚ÄúDuring his 10-year presidency, he expanded and strengthened academic offerings, increased the size and diversity of the faculty, and established strong ties between the college, alumni and the community... His greatest gift was his ability to find common ground among disparate people and to inspire them to work together. Bowdoin is a stronger, more humane place because of his service.‚ÄùCreamer, Melanie, \\"Feature Obituary: A.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, she was used as a salvage training hulk. Built in Portland, Oregon Buckeye (YN-8) was laid down on 17 March 1941 at Portland, Oregon, by the Commercial Iron Works; launched on 26 July 1941; sponsored by Miss Sara Ann Tefler; and placed in service on 5 September 1941, Lt. Elias Johnson, USNR, in charge. World War II service=North Pacific operations After fitting out at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Buckeye began duty in the 13th Naval District. She tended nets there until the fall of 1942. At that time, the ship was transferred to the Alaska Sector based at Dutch Harbor. While stationed there, she was placed in full commission on 26 December 1942, Lt. Comdr. Elias Johnson, USNR, in command. She continued to tend nets and buoys in the Aleutian Islands, first at Dutch Harbor and, after May 1943, at recently captured Attu. On 1 January 1944, Buckeye was re-designated AN 13. During the summer of 1944, the net layer received orders to Seattle, Washington, for an overhaul that she completed between 24 July and 11 September. West Pacific operations Following a round-trip voyage from the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii and back, Buckeye was stationed at the Naval Net Depot at Tiburon, California, near San Francisco, California, as ready duty ship and standby vessel for emergency repairs. That duty lasted until 27 January 1945 when she was transferred to Service Squadron (ServRon) 6 of the U.S. 7th Fleet. During February and March, the net layer stopped at Pearl Harbor, Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, Manus in the Admiralty Islands, and Hollandia on New Guinea before arriving in the Philippines in April. Initially, she served in Leyte Gulf but, later that summer moved to Luzon where she operated in Manila Bay and Subic Bay.  Post-war activity Buckeye spent the remainder of her active career at Luzon. On 17 July 1946, the ship went aground in Subic Bay. With the assistance of , she was refloated on 29 July and was towed to Alava Dock for repairs. Post-war inactivation She was still undergoing repairs at the end of 1946 and, apparently, they were never completed. She went out of commission at Subic on 4 March 1947. Later transferred to the Pacific Reserve Fleet group berthed at San Diego, California, she remained there until 1963 when she was turned over to the U.S. Maritime Administration for lay up in Suisun Bay, California Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1963. She remained at the Suisun Bay facility until 5 May 1976 at which time she was reacquired by the Navy for use as a salvage training hulk. Her status is unknown.

Her research interest is late Paleolithic fauna of the Zagros Mountains and the domestication of the wild goat in Iran. Research in 2006 focussed on the role of pigs and boars on the ancient Iranian plateau. She has also published new collaborative research onto the origins of the donkey. Recent research has explored the domestication of dogs in the near east. As well as researching the physicality of ancient animals, Mashkour also researches how herds may have behaved in the ancient past. This leads into her wider research on palaeo-diet. This has led to further research looking at coat colour variation in ancient canids.

Built in the Greek Revival style in 1846 as the chapel for the Auburn Female College (today Auburn High School) and moved to the Auburn University campus in 1883, Langdon Hall is the oldest building in the city of Auburn, and today houses an auditorium and office space for Auburn University staff. Before the Civil War, Langdon Hall served as the location for a series of debates on the question of Southern secession, involving William Lowndes Yancey, Alexander Stephens, Benjamin Harvey Hill, and Robert Toombs. Langdon Hall is named for Charles Carter Langdon, a former mayor of Mobile, Alabama, Alabama Secretary of State, and a trustee of Auburn University from 1872-1889\\\\. History=Early history Langdon Hall was built as the chapel for the Auburn Female College (later the Auburn Masonic Female College and today Auburn High School) in 1846.Langdon Hall, retrieved July 31, 2008. Prior to the chapel's construction, public lectures were held in the Methodist church, then town's only public hall. Public feeling was that such lectures were inappropriate for a church, and members of the congregation contributed funds for the building's construction. The chapel was sited across from the Methodist church, on the current northeast corner of Gay Street and Magnolia Avenue ().Leland Cooper, The Early History of Auburn, Thesis (Auburn: s.n., 1907), 5. Upon construction, the chapel held the largest auditorium in east Alabama, and as such served as the regional center for lectures and political debates.Mickey Logue and Jack Simms, Auburn, A Pictorial History of the Lovliest Village (Auburn: s.n., 1996), 16; Mollie Hollifield, Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain (S.l.: s.n., 1955), 12. The lower level of the chapel held the Female College's chemistry laboratory, which was expanded in the 1850s by professor John M. Darby to produce the patent disinfectant Darby's Prophylactic Fluid.Henry Barnard, School architecture; or Contributions to the improvement of school-houses in the United States (New York: A. S. Barnes & Co., 1848), 332; Hollifield, Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain, 73. When the East Alabama Male College (today Auburn University) opened in 1859, Darby taught joint chemistry classes in the chapel jointly with the Female College students.Cooper, The Early History of Auburn, 7. Secession debates By the latter part of the 1850s, the chapel became commonly used for political debates over the question of whether the Southern states should secede from the United States. In May 1859, the chapel held the nominating convention of the Democratic Party for the 3rd Congressional District of Alabama, nominating David Clopton, a States' Rights Democrat, for Congress.\\"The Nomination at Auburn\\", Daily Confederation, May 11, 1859; Cooper, The Early History of Auburn, 7. In 1860, a major debate was held in the chapel involving Clopton, Seaborn Jones, Benjamin Harvey Hill, Alexander Stephens, Robert Toombs, William G. Brownlow, and William Lowndes Yancey. In that day-long debate, Clopton, Jones, and Hill debated in the morning session, with Stephens arguing against secession to open the afternoon. Toombs followed, supporting the states' rights position, but the anti-secession arguments of Brownlow seemed to win the debate for the pro-Union side. Yancey --ill in Montgomery--was not in attendance for most of the day, but as the anti-secessionists gained the upper hand as the day wore on, a special train was sent to bring him to Auburn. As the debate prepared to wrap up in the early evening, Yancey finally arrived, extemporaneously speaking for an hour and a half on the arguments for secession. Yancey's oratory proved sufficient to carry the day for the secessionists, and the country moved one step closer to Civil War.Hollifield, Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain, 14-16. Move and reconstruction The Chapel (now Langdon Hall), as it appeared before being bricked in 1892.During the Civil War, the chapel acted as a hospital for Confederate troops Cooper, The Early History of Auburn, 9. In 1883, the state legislature appropriated $30,000 to the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College--the East Alabama Male College's new name--for improvements to the college's main building and construction of a new building. The \\"new building\\" built was the old chapel, disassembled on site and reassembled on the A&M; college campus. The building was reassembled by the plans of W. D. Wood, an 1881 graduate of the A&M; college. In 1889, the old chapel was renamed Langdon Hall, after Charles Carter Langdon, who was a former mayor and editor in Mobile, Alabama, Alabama secretary of state, and an A&M; college trustee.Hollifield, Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain, 114. The reconstructed Langdon Hall now had woodworking and mechanical engineering laboratories in the old chemistry lab; a dynamo built there allowed the auditorium above to be lit with electric lights in 1888. When the A&M; college's main building burned in 1887, the Langdon auditorium was temporarily divided into four classrooms and an assembly room, and in 1892 the half- century-old tower was removed and the building was bricked.History of Langdon Hall, retrieved July 30, 2008; Mike Jernigan, Auburn Man: The Life and Times of George Petrie (Montgomery: The Donnell Group, 2007), 38. 20th century to today By the early twentieth century, Langdon Hall had become the social center of the campus. Langdon hosted classes, motion pictures, commencement exercises, music performances, and pep rallies. When the engineering department completely moved out of Langdon in 1921, the lower floor housed the Home Economics Department; in 1924, that same floor became a YMCA, and in 1933, the student center. The auditorium was remodeled in 1950, served as the 'free movies' theater in the 1970s through 1990s, and later, the lower floor was converted to offices.History of Langdon Hall, retrieved July 30, 2008 It is included in the Auburn University Historic District.

Established in 1996 it covers 220 square kilometres. The Wetland Reserve is located on the north bank of the River Gambia, approximately 100 km (52 nautical miles) from the river mouth. The name is derived from the Bao Bolon tributary that rises in Senegal and enters the River Gambia. It extends from the River Gambia north to the Senegalese border along the Baobolon tributary.  History  On 1 January 1993, an area of 35 km¬≤ was first declared as Bao Bolong National Reserve. From 16 September 1996 on, it has covered an extended area of 220 km¬≤ (200 km¬≤ according to other sources). It was the first reserve in the Gambia to be acknowledged as a wetland area worthy of protection according to the Ramsar Convention. Since 1975, this convention, whose draft had been initiated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), protects the habitat of water birds and Charadriiformes. For other nature reserves in the country, such as Tanbi Wetland Complex or Niumi National Park (NNP), a Ramsar acknowledgement is also being aimed at by the Gambian authorities. As with NNP, it is intended to extend Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve across the border and to jointly administrate the area with Senegalese authorities.  Geography  The reserve features a length of 22 kilometres and an approximate width of nine km. The western part is located in the Central Baddibu district while the eastern part adheres to Upper Baddibu, both of which belonging to the North Bank Division. Chiefly, the reserve is made up of the river Bao Bolong's estuary, one of the bigger tributaries of the river Gambia. It is located about 100 km away from the Gambia's mouth into Atlantic Ocean. The roughly 100 km long Bao Bolong river's spring is situated in Senegal. Furthermore, BBWR includes the rivers Salokini Bolong, Mandon Bolong, Duntu Malang Bolong, Tanku Bolong and Katchang Bolong. The Gambia river thereby formes the southern boundary of the protected area. Approximately two kilometres away on the opposite bank of the river, the roughly 115 km¬≤ large Kiang West National Park is located. A some two and a half kilometres wide zone of dense mangrove forest adjoines to the river. To the west lies the town of Salikenne (population about 4,000), which is also located near the Dobo Forest Park of 7.32 km¬≤. At the western border, the Jalabiro Forest Park of 0.59 km¬≤ can moreover be found. The northern edge is bordered by the north bank road, Gambia's secondmost important highway. Along this road and the fork to Salikenne, several smaller towns like Nja Kunda, Minti Kunda, Kekuta Kunda, No Kunda, Konti Kunda Sukoto, Konti Kunda Nji and Illiassa are situated. In the east, following a fork of nine km length from the north bank road, the town of Katchang of 1,700 residents can be reached. Farafenni, with a population of more than 30,000 being the division's largest city, lies roughly 18 km outside the outer limits of BBWR to the east. Summed up, there are 25 small townsBao Bolong Wetland Reserve www.prcmarine.org which are situated at the wetland reserve's boundaries, one among them being inside the park limits proper. The inhabitants of these towns conduct fishery for personal requirements and their stock graze inside BBWR. Furthermore, they collect timber and fire wood there. The terrain is flat, the highest elevation is cited with 12 metres above mean sea level.  Flora and fauna = Ecosystems  Sesuvium portulacastrum N√©r√© (Parkia biglobosa) Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve includes a rich fauna and flora within multiple ecosystems. Important, protected tree species are pointed out by the \\"Ramsar Information Sheet\\",Ramsar Information Sheet such as Pterocarpus erinaceus, Parinari macrophylla, the ana tree, wild mango trees (Cordyla africana) and N√©r√© (Parkia biglobosa). = Mangroves = Only in the mangrove forest of Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve the mangrove trees of the Senegambia region reach a height of 20 metres. The species Rhizophora racemosa, red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) are widespread among them. = Salt marshes = In the salt marshes, e.g. the succulent Sesuvium portulacastrum and grasses likeSporobolus spicatus, Paspalum vaginatum as well as Diplachne fusca can be found. In the savanna, which at times is flooded, Phragmites karka, Echinochloa pyramidalis and paper reed are very common. = Savannah = In the savannah, trees like Daniellia oliveri, Terminalia albida, Bombax costatum and others are to be found. Among the shrubs one will encounter several species of figs, Physostigma thonningii, Terminalia avicennoides, Anthostema senegalense and Nauclea latifolia. As of grasses, Andropogon tectorum and Gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus), Beckeropsis uniseta and Pennisetum subangustum are common.  Avifauna  Grey heron (Ardea cinerea) Common sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) Night heron (Nycticorax n. nycticorax) Little egret (Egretta garzetta) Woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis) The Gambia is frequently visited by ornithologists as more than 540 species of birds have been described there in topic literature. Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve is one of the major targets for tourists and scientists who intend to explore the Gambia's manifold avifauna. Among the birds of BBWR, which include 268 species of 62 families, the Ramsar Information Sheet exemplarily lists the following: Typical for a wetland, BBWR is the habitat of many water birds, which also include geese. Among them comb duck (Sarkidiornis melanotos, spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis), white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), garganey (Anas querquedula), northern pintail (Anas acuta), African pygmy goose (Nettapus auritus) and the northern shoveler (Anas clypeata). The order of Ciconiiformes is represented by birds like western reef heron (Egretta gularis), little egret (Egretta garzetta), woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), hammerkop (Scopus umbretta), squacco heron (Ardeola ralloides), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), great egret (Egretta alba, marabou (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) and the sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus). With their long legs, this division of birds searches the river banks for food. The brackish water areas feature Charadriidae. Spur-winged lapwing (Hoplopterus spinosus), little stint (Calidris minuta) and common sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) can be found. Among the colourful family of kingfishers, which preferably occur near open water, the woodland kingfisher, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), swallow- tailed bee-eater (Merops hirundineus), giant kingfisher (Ceryle maxima), malachite kingfisher (Alcedo cristata) and the blue-breasted kingfisher (Halcyon malimbica) are notable. Equally colourful are the west African examples of starlings. Among them, the violet-backed starling (Cinnyricinclus leucogaster) and the long-tailed glossy-starling (Lamprotornis caudatus) can be found inside the Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve. The Coraciiformes include the Abyssinian ground-hornbill (Bucorvus abyssinicus) and the European roller (Coracias garrulus). Also species of parrots can be found in west Africa, among them are the Senegal parrot (Poicephalus senegalus) and the rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri). Inevitably linked to water are also pelicans and darters. The pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) and the African darter (Anhinga rufa) live within the BBWR. The birds of prey include species like African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), red-necked buzzard (Buteo auguralis) and black kite (Milvus migrans) as well as the bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus). Moreover, African mourning doves (Streptopelia decipiens) of the genus Streptopelia and the little swift (Apus affinis) from the swift family have been spotted.  Fish and other water animals  Among BBWR's ichthyofauna, some fish are noted in the \\"Ramsar Information Sheet\\": Ethmalosa fimbriata, barracudas (Sphyraena sp.), Polydactylus quadrifilis, Arius latiscutatus, Pseudotolithus elongatus, Pomadasys perotaei and Pseudotolithus bracygnathus. Also tilapia (Tilapia) and mullets (Mugilidae) occur in these waters. Furthermore, a type of oyster, Crassostrea gasar and blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) can be found. The West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis), a mammal, lives in the water between the mangroves and is categorized as an endangered species. Moreover, the West African Crocodile (Crocodylus suchus) is a common species of reptile.  Mammals  Thirty-two species of mammals are known, the \\"Ramsar Information Sheet\\" lists the African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis), which is common to the area. Several species of antelopes like sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekeii), bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) and the duiker (Cephalophinae) as well as warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus). Among the predators, the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) is common. Also leopards (Panthera pardus) are attributed to the BBWR. The primates, according to the \\"Ramsar Information Sheet\\", include the red colobus (Piliocolobus), the patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas) and green monkeys (Chlorocebus). But also the Guinea baboon (Papio papio) and the Senegal bushbaby (Galago senegalensis) can be found.  Tourism  The area is only moderately used for tourism. Ecotourism, including bird watching and common observations of nature, shall be further developed though. Next to this, boat tours through the mangroves are conducted.

It is not to be confused with the RAF grass strip on the western side of Bury St Edmunds known as RAF Westley, an area now part of the town itself. The airfield, now in private ownership and much reduced in size, is still active and is known as Rougham Airfield. The airfield was originally and is now again known as Rougham as it is located north of that village between the A14 and the main railway line between Bury St Edmunds and Ipswich. It was built during 1941 and 1942 with three intersecting concrete runways. The main runway of 2,000 yards was aligned approximately E‚ÄìW. It saw extensive use during the Second World War. Current use With the end of military control, Bury St Edmunds airfield's concreted areas were broken up with most of the site being returned to agriculture. The old technical site has been developed into the Rougham Industrial Estate. The T2 hangars are still in use, for storage. The control tower, used for many years as a private dwelling, has now been restored and is used as a museum. The airfield, once again known as Rougham, now has two grass runways available for civil use. Gliding and model aircraft flying are frequent and several open-air events are organised each year.
