An opening bowler, he made his debut for Ireland in 2008, aged 26. He took part in Ireland's successful campaign in the 2007-08 ICC Intercontinental Cup. Connell has also represented Ireland in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). In January 2012 he was given a contract with Cricket Ireland. Career =Breakthrough= Peter Connell made his Twenty20 debut on 27 June 2008 in a match for Ireland against Bangladesh A. His three overs conceded twenty runs for no wickets and he opened the bowling with Thinus Fourie. Connell made his first-class debut for Ireland on 9 July 2008 in a match against the Netherlands as part of the 2007-08 ICC Intercontinental Cup. Opening the bowling with Thinus Fourie, Connell took a ten-wicket haul, finishing with figures of 10 wickets for 69 runs (10/69) in the match, and also took a hat-trick as Ireland won by an innings and 67 runs. He was the 16th player in the history of first-class cricket to take a hat-trick on debut and the first to do so in an international match. He is also the only player to have taken a first-class hat-trick for Ireland. With 30 first-class wickets for Ireland, Connell is the 16th highest wicket-taker for Ireland. In the 2007-08 ICC Intercontinental Cup, Connell was Ireland's leading wicket-taker for the tournament. His haul of 28 wickets from 5 matches, at an average of 11.67, was also the fourth highest total of wickets for that year's tournament and was the best average for bowlers with 10 wickets or more. Ireland played in the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifiers in August 2008. On 2 August, the team played their maiden T20 International, beating Scotland by four wickets; Connell made his T20I debut in the match, along with the rest of the Ireland team. Ireland progressed to the final and ended up sharing the trophy with the Netherlands as the match was rained off. Connell finished the tournament with 6 wickets from 4 matches, at an average of 6.00; he was Ireland's second leading wicket-taker - behind Andre Botha with 8, and tied with Alex Cusack who also had 6 - and was the equal fifth leading wicket-taker in the tournament. =2009= Ireland took part in the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy, losing five of their eight matches and two were rained off. In Ireland's only victory of the competition, Connell took career best figures of 5/19; it was his first five-wicket haul in one-day matches, beating his previous best bowling figures of 4/71. Ireland bowled Worcestershire out for 58, their lowest ever one-day total, to win by 94 runs. Playing at New Road, Worcester, Ireland received a standing ovation as they walked off the pitch. Connell finished the competition with 10 wickets at an average of 21.30. In the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in June 2009, Ireland progressed to the super eights. Despite helping Ireland qualify for the tournament the previous year, Connell played just one match in the tournament; opening the bowling, he bowled just one over for fourteen runs in a match Ireland lost to New Zealand. Ireland's campaign in the 2009-10 ICC Intercontinental Cup, in pursuit of their fourth consecutive title in the competition, began in July 2009. Connell played in their first match, which was against Kenya; opening the bowling, he returned match figures of 2/97. Phil Simmons, Ireland's coach, was dissatisfied with Connell's performance and he was dropped for Ireland's next Intercontinental Cup match, which was against Scotland. Simmons cited \\"a drop in attitude\\" for Connell's lack of success and subsequent drop, adding \\"I need to see that he's back to where he was at towards the beginning of last year. I want people to realise just how nice it is to be involved with this squad and not take it for granted.\\" Connell was given an opportunity to prove himself in an Ireland A match against Marylebone Cricket Club. In January 2012 Cricket Ireland increased the number of player contracts to 23 across three categories, and Connell was given a category C contract.

Only those waves that have a frequency of 16Hz to 20kHz are audible to humans. However, this range is an average and will slightly change from individual to individual. Sound waves that have frequencies below 16Hz are called infrasonic and those above 20kHz are called ultrasonic. Sound is a mechanical wave and as such consists physically in oscillatory elastic compression and in oscillatory displacement of a fluid.

He was drafted in the fifth round of the 2007 CFL Draft, 33rd overall, by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, and was later traded that season to the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He has also been a member of the Edmonton Eskimos. Prior to turning pro, Getzlaf played with the junior team Prairie Thunder and the collegiate team Regina Rams in his hometown of Regina, Saskatchewan. Early and personal life Born and raised in Regina, Saskatchewan, Getzlaf grew up playing ice hockey in addition to football with his younger brother, Ryan, an NHL All-Star, two-time Olympic gold medalist and Stanley Cup champion for the Anaheim Ducks. Getzlaf is married to Tia. Professional career = Hamilton Tiger-Cats = Getzlaf was chosen by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the fifth round, 33rd overall, in the 2007 CFL Draft. After dressing for the first two games of the season, he spent the rest of the season on two teams' practice rosters. = Saskatchewan Roughriders = Getzlaf was traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders with Corey Holmes in exchange for Jason Armstead on August 19, 2007. While he was on the practice roster during the Roughriders' 2007 Grey Cup victory, he still shared in the win, meaning that both he and his brother, Ryan, ended up 2007 champions with their respective teams. Getzlaf started the 2008 season on the practice roster, but with a rash of injuries at the receiver position, he was pressed into action, making his Riders debut on Oct 3, 2008. In this game against the Calgary Stampeders, he recorded his first career CFL catch and touchdown, finishing the game with five catches for 47 yards and a touchdown. He dressed for the final five games of the season, finishing with 15 catches for 247 yards and two touchdowns. He also contributed one catch for 13 yards in the Roughriders' loss to the BC Lions in the 2008 West Semi-Final. Heading into the 2009 season, Getzlaf spent the first four weeks as a backup receiver. After Andy Fantuz was injured in a week-4 game against Edmonton, Getzlaf started the week-5 game against the Calgary Stampeders. He had five receptions for 101 yards and two touchdowns including the opening score of the game and a 65-yard touchdown with 1:17 remaining in the game to give the Roughriders a 24‚Äì23 comeback victory. It was the first 100-yard receiving game of his career. Once Fantuz came back from injury in the Banjo Bowl, Getzlaf retained his starter's position, with Jason Clermont being relegated to a backup role; hence, he started 14 games during the regular season. Getzlaf finished with a team-leading six touchdown receptions and was tied with Andy Fantuz for the team lead in two-point conversions with two. Of his nine career touchdowns (including post-season), six have come against the Stampeders. In the 2009 West Final, Getzlaf had three catches for 21 yards and a touchdown, which was part of the 27-17 win over the Stampeders that featured all Roughrider scoring by Canadian players. He had two catches for 15 yards in the 2009 Grey Cup, a 28-27 loss to the Montreal Alouettes. On Jan. 15, 2010, it was formally announced that Getzlaf had re-signed with the Roughriders, rather than becoming a free agent. On June 20, 2012, the Riders announced that Getzlaf had signed a contract extension.https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=398805 Getzlaf was named the Most Valuable Canadian player in the 101st Grey Cup. On December 5, 2013, Getzlaf signed a contract extension with the Roughriders, promising to keep him in Saskatchewan through the 2015 season. After not being re-signed following the 2015 season Getzlaf became a free agent on February 9, 2016. = Edmonton Eskimos = On February 25, 2016, Getzlaf signed with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. Getzlaf's tenure with the club ended after a year and a half, when he was released by the club on September 26, 2017. = Saskatchewan Roughriders (II) = On October 16, 2017, Getzlaf was added to the Saskatchewan Roughriders practice roster. He was promoted to the active roster on November 12. He announced his retirement on January 4, 2018.

It operates Raytheon T-1 Jayhawk, Beechcraft T-6 Texan II and Northrop T-38 Talon aircraft conducting flight training. History =Antisubmarine warfare and heavy bomber training= The squadron was first activated at Langley Field, Virginia, as the 43d Bombardment Squadron in January 1940, one of the original squadrons of the 29th Bombardment Group. Its organization was part of the pre-World War II buildup of the United States Army Air Corps after the breakout of war in Europe. In May, it moved to MacDill Field, Florida, where it was equipped with a mix of pre-production YB-17s and early model Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Douglas B-18 Bolos. The squadron was still at MacDill when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and it began to fly antisubmarine patrol missions in the Gulf of Mexico from January 1942. By the summer of 1942, the U-boat threat in the Gulf began to diminish, with all German submarines being withdrawn from the area by September.Warnock, p. 16 29th Bombardment Group B-24E Liberator in 1944 No longer needed in the Gulf, the squadron moved to Gowen Field, Idaho, where it became an Operational Training Unit (OTU) The OTU program involved the use of an oversized parent unit to provide cadres to \\"satellite groups\\".Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi The 96th, 381st, 384th and 388th Bombardment Groups were all formed at Gowen in the second half of 1942.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 166, 269, 271, 276 In 1943, the squadron exchanged its B-17s for Consolidated B-24 Liberators. The squadron mission also changed as the Army Air Forces' (AAF) need for new units diminished and its need for replacements increased. The squadron became a Replacement Training Unit (RTU). Like OTUs, RTUs were oversized units, but their mission was to train individual pilots and aircrews. However, standard military units, like the 6th Squadron, were based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, and were not proving well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 The 29th Bombardment Group and its squadrons (including the 6th) were inactivated. Its personnel and equipment, along with that of supporting units at Gowen Field were combined into the 212th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training School, Heavy) on 1 April 1944.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 81-82 =Combat in the Pacific= 29th Bombardment Group B-29 Formation 1945 The AAF was organizing new Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment units, and the squadron was activated the same day at Pratt Army Air Field, Kansas. It briefly returned to flying B-17s until B-29s became available for training. It continued training with the Superfortress until December 1944. Training included long range overwater flights to Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico. It deployed to North Field, Guam, where it became a component of the 314th Bombardment Wing of XXI Bomber Command. Its first combat mission was an attack of Tokyo on 25 February 1945. Until March 1945, it engaged primarily in daytime high altitude attacks on strategic targets, such as refineries and factories. The campaign against Japan switched that month and the squadron began to conduct low altitude night raids, using incendiaries against area targets. The squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for a 31 March attack against an airfield at Omura, Japan. The squadron earned a second DUC in June for an attack on an industrial area of Shizuoka Prefecture, which included an aircraft factory operated by Mitsubishi and the Chigusa Arsenal. During Operation Iceberg, the invasion of Okinawa, the squadron was diverted from the strategic campaign against Japanese industry and attacked airfields from which kamikaze attacks were being launched against the landing force. Following VJ Day, the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners of war and participated in several show of force missions over Japan. It also conducted reconnaissance flights over Japanese cities. The squadron remained on Guam until it was inactivated in March 1946. =United States Air Force= It conducted undergraduate pilot training from, 1972‚Äì1977, 1990‚Äì1992, and since 1997. The squadron administers and executes the Air Education and Training Command/Air Force Reserve Command Associate Instructor Pilot (IP) Program and provides Active Guard Reserve (AGR) and Traditional Reserve (TR) IPs to augment the cadre of active duty pilots conducting pilot training. During wartime, or in the event of hostilities, the unit is mobilized to offset anticipated losses of experienced active duty pilot contributions to the instructor pilot training programs.

Considered one of the best batsmen to play for Ireland, Stirling is the opening batsman for the Ireland cricket team and an occasional right arm offbreak bowler. He is one of the top 10 run scorers in T20 internationals. He was one of the eleven cricketers to play in Ireland's first ever Test match, against Pakistan, in May 2018. He was appointed as the vice-captain of the Ireland team in June 2020. He debuted in first-class cricket in March 2008, playing for Ireland in the Intercontinental Cup. The same year Stirling made his debut in One Day Internationals (ODIs). He was also snicked off by George Barlow . Having represented Middlesex's youth sides and Second XI, Stirling signed a contract with the club in December 2009. A month later he was awarded a contract with Cricket Ireland, making him one of six players with a full-time contract with the board. He made his Twenty20 and List A debuts for Middlesex in 2010 and 2011 respectively. In December 2018, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract by Cricket Ireland for the 2019 season. In July 2019, in the second ODI against Zimbabwe, Stirling became the first batsman for Ireland to score 4,000 runs in ODIs. In January 2020, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract from Cricket Ireland, the first year in which all contracts were awarded on a full-time basis. Early career In July 2009, Stirling scored his maiden first-class century. In Ireland's opening match of the 2009‚Äì10 ICC Intercontinental Cup, he opened the batting with Jeremy Bray and in the first innings scored 100. Stirling was a member of the Ireland squad that participated in 2010 Under-19 World Cup hosted by New Zealand in January. The team were runners-up to Bangladesh in the Plate Championship, finishing tenth overall out of 16 teams. Stirling was the team's leading run-scorer, with 209 from five matches. Contracts with Middlesex In December 2009 Stirling signed a three-year contract with Middlesex County Cricket Club, joining former Ireland international Eoin Morgan at the club. According to Angus Fraser, the club's director of cricket, representing Ireland is Stirling's priority; he also stated that \\"Paul has been involved with the Middlesex youth sides and Second XI and we are delighted that he has now signed a contract for the club. His batting for Ireland in 2009 highlighted his potential\\". The following month Cricket Ireland, the governing body for cricket in Ireland, awarded Stirling a full- time contract. He was one of six players to be awarded such contracts with Cricket Ireland, and came just a year after the first professional contracts were awarded to Ireland's cricketers. Before that players were amateurs relying on income from other jobs and playing cricket in their spare time. The contract allowed Stirling and the others to focus on cricket, with the aim of improving ahead of the 2011 World Cup. After the 2011 Cricket World Cup, Stirling broke into Middlesex's one-day side during the 2011 season, making his List A debut for the club on 24 April against Worcestershire. Although Middlesex failed to progress beyond the group stages of the 2011 Clydesdale Bank 40, Stirling enjoyed personal success. Scoring 535 runs from 12 matches, he was Middlesex's leading run-scorer and 7th in the competition. During an innings of 68 against Yorkshire, one of Stirling's two half-centuries in the competition, he passed 2,000 runs in List A cricket. Towards the end of the competition Stirling struck his first century in Middlesex colours, scoring 109 runs from 81 balls to a 34-run win over Derbyshire. Although a full- strength team played against England in an ODI in August 2012, county commitments meant many of Ireland's senior players were unavailable to play in the team's opening match of the 2011‚Äì13 Intercontinental Cup. An attacking half-century from Stirling in the final innings of the match helped secure victory for Ireland. Later that same month Stirling scored his second first- class century. His innings of 107, beating his previous highest score of 100, came off just 79 deliveries and helped Ireland to their second win of the Intercontinental Cup. Acknowledgment In August 2010, Stirling was nominated in the \\"Emerging Player of the Year\\" and \\"Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year\\" categories for the ICC Awards. He was the only associate member to be nominated in the \\"Emerging Player\\" category, the other 15 players coming from Test-playing countries. Ireland's had most nominees in the \\"Associate and Affiliate\\" category, with Trent Johnston and Kevin O'Brien included alongside Stirling. Richard Holdsworth, a representative of the ICC, said \\"I think it's fantastic for Paul Stirling to be nominated in two separate categories and to be recognised alongside some of the leading emerging players in the Full Members, it proves how far the development of Associate cricket has progressed\\". He did not make the short list in either category. International career On 7 September 2010, during a One Day International against Canada, Stirling made his maiden List-A century, scoring 177 runs. In doing so, Stirling made the highest individual score for Ireland in a One Day International. Stirling was selected in Ireland's 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup. Ireland won two out of six matches, which was not sufficient to progress beyond the group stage, but finished on a high by beating the Netherlands. Chasing 307 to win on a batting friendly wicket, Stirling opened the batting with team captain William Porterfield. The pair shared a partnership of 177 runs, setting a new record for Ireland's first wicket in ODIs. Stirling fell for 101, his century coming off 70 deliveries, which made it the fourth-fastest in World Cup history. When Ireland's cricketers have been regulars for English counties, demands from country and club have sometimes come into conflict. Despite this, Stirling played in Ireland's two- match ODI series against Pakistan in May. Ireland lost the series 2-0, but in the second match Stirling scored his first century against a Test nation. Stirling's influence on the team was such that, along with all-round Kevin O'Brien, he was one of two Ireland players shortlisted for Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year at the 2011 ICC Awards in August. A side made up of some of the best players from Associate and Affiliate teams was put together to face England in Dubai in January 2012. The three-day match was part of England's preparation for a series against Pakistan later that month. Stirling was one of four Ireland players included in the 12-man squad. In the ODI series against Afghanistan he along with Rashid Khan became the first pair of bowlers representing different teams to take 6 wickets a piece in a single ODI match In February 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named Stirling as one of the ten players to watch ahead of the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament. In May 2018, he was named in a fourteen-man squad for Ireland's first ever Test match, which was played against Pakistan later the same month. He made his Test debut for Ireland, against Pakistan, on 11 May 2018. He scored 17 runs in the first innings, and became the first Irish batsman to score a boundary in Test cricket. In January 2019, he was named in Ireland's squad for their one-off Test against Afghanistan in India. In September 2019, he was named in Ireland's squad for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the United Arab Emirates. He was the leading run- scorer in the tournament, with 291 runs in eight matches. In June 2020, he was named as the vice-captain of the Ireland cricket team. On 10 July 2020, Stirling was named in Ireland's 21-man squad to travel to England to start training behind closed doors for the ODI series against the England cricket team. T20 franchise career In September 2018, he was named in Kandahar's squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament. The following month, he was named in Paarl Rocks' squad for the first edition of the Mzansi Super League T20 tournament. In July 2019, he was selected to play for the Belfast Titans in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, the following month the tournament was cancelled. He signed a contract with Northamptonshire for the 2020 Vitality t20 Blast on 31 January 2020.

The product  Valour, also called DiskWorks as well as strategic marketing brands chosen by vendors, grew out of a plan to rewrite the aging Westinghouse Disc Utility (WDU) and target the full range of IBM operating systems. Valour runs as a highly privileged CMS task, designed to accommodate any model disc drive or tape drive. The product incorporated a number of unique concepts and technologies. It was one of the earliest products to use a primitive form of windowing, including dialogue boxes capable of real-time updates.Valour User Manual ¬© 1999 The product offered a wide variety of hierarchical backups, data streaming, alternating tape drives, and an ability to defragment minidisks.  Development  Valour, also called DiskWorks, grew out of a joint effort between Westinghouse and III of Orlando, Florida. Original plans called for both VM/CMS and VSE versions led by Dr. Ray Ferguson of Westinghouse and Leigh Lundin of III. John Gaston was selected to lead the VSE team. Part way into development, Westinghouse began to break up the division during the outsourcing thrust of the Reaganomics era. Through badly managed negotiations, Westinghouse ended up with neither developers or outsourcing partners, which spelled the end for one of the industries foremost software groups. The VM product was developed by III (Independent Intelligence Incorporated) of Orlando, Florida. The software designer was Leigh Lundin. Other core developers included Dr. Ray Ferguson, Kevin Beauregard, Mark Woodruff, and Jean-Fran√ßois Groff. Product development occurred at III offices within Westinghouse Automation Intelligence division, Orlando, Florida. Broad range in-depth testing was conducted at IBM's data center in Tampa, Florida and the IBM lab in B√∂blingen, Germany. The team first built an OOPS environment using a combination of procedural Rexx and assembler language. Valour may have been one of the first commercial products that looked to object-oriented programming to underpin its development platform. Development brought new techniques and concepts, including its own hi-speed access method, network hierarchical data structures, windowing, and a buffer block concept referred to as granularity.  Marketing  The product had a feature unique for its time. By changing a table and a splash screen, the product could be re-labeled or re-branded for any distributor in any Roman language. As such, the product was localized for France, Germany, Switzerland, and Netherlands, each with local marketing companies. III contracted with distributors using a non- exclusive license.

Moreover, substitution by O+ is more properly designated by the prefix oxonia. Nevertheless, the authors who first prepared the cation called it oxatriquinane, and the name has been perpetuated in the literature. A semisystematic name in line with standard nomenclature might be 2a1-oxonia-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydroquinacene.) is an alkyl oxonium ion with formula , remarkable for being stable in aqueous solution. It has a cyclononane backbone, with a trivalent oxygen connected to carbon 1, 4, and 7, forming three fused pentagonal rings.  History  Oxatriquinane was first described in 2008, and was obtained after a five-step synthesis starting from 1,4,7-cyclononatriene. At the time it had the longest C‚ÄìO bond lengths (1.54 √Ö, C‚ÄìO bonds in ethers are generally ~1.43 √Ö) and most acute C‚àíO‚àíC angles ever observed in a compound.  Reactions  Oxonium ions normally are strong alkylating agents and are only observed in solution as reactive intermediates or under extreme conditions. Oxatriquinane is an exception: it does not react with boiling water or with alcohols, thiols, halide ions, or amines, although it does react with stronger nucleophiles such as hydroxide, cyanide, and azide. The ability of the oxygen to enter into a fourth covalent bond has been of some theoretical interest and was achieved using carborane acid. Analogues Related species include oxatriquinacene, the tri- unsaturated analogue, which is of interest as a possible precursor to oxaacepentalene, a neutral aromatic species. 1,4,7-tri-tert-butyloxatriquinane has also been synthesised; this compound contains significant amounts of intramolecular steric strain, resulting in further bond elongation to give C‚ÄìO bond lengths of 1.622 √Ö, the longest recorded in any species.

Life Waddington was born in Leeds in Yorkshire on 10 December 1810, to George and Elizabeth Waddington. At the age of fifteen he began to preach in the cottages of the neighbours. Before he was 19 he preached for Airedale College, the demand for student-preachers being greater than the supply. He then entered Airedale College, and, after a brief theological course under William Vint, was ordained pastor of the congregational church in Orchard Street, Stockport, on 23 May 1833. At Stockport he introduced Sunday schools connected with the congregationalist churches. He also conducted a government enquiry into distress and poverty in the town, the results of which were published in a blue-book. In 1846 he moved to Southwark, to Union Street Chapel, the oldest congregational church in the world. He found it in financial difficulties, which at one time threatened to disperse the congregation, but which he eventually overcame. In May 1864, with the support of leading congregationalists such as Thomas Binney and Samuel Morley a new building, under the name The Pilgrim Church. was opened in Buckenham Square; erected as a memorial to the Pilgrim Fathers, several of whom were claimed for the congregation. Works In 1854 he published John Penry: the Pilgrim Martyr (London), and in 1861 a more general treatise on Congregational Martyrs (London) (intended to form part of a series of Historical Papers but these were not continued). The work reached a second edition in the following year. It was followed in 1862 by an essay on Congregational Church History from the Reformation to 1662, London, a popular work which obtained the bicentenary prize offered by the Congregational Union. In 1866 he published Surrey Congregational History, London, in which he dealt with the records of his own congregation. In 1869 he began the issue of his major work on Congregational History, which occupied the latter part of his life. It was completed to 1880 in five volumes, becoming the most comprehensive treatise on any English body of nonconformists. Death and honours Waddington died on 24 September 1880. He received the honorary degree of D.D. from the University of Williamstown, U.S.A.

While working as Assistant Church Historian, he co-authored The Story of the Latter-day Saints with Glen Leonard. After Ezra Taft Benson dismissed the book as secular new history, other events led to the dissolution of the LDS Church History department in 1982. Allen resigned as Assistant Church Historian in 1979, returning to work at Brigham Young University (BYU) full-time. He studied history at Utah State University (USU) for his Bachelor's, at BYU for his master's, and the University of Southern California for his PhD. After working as a seminary teacher and coordinator of seminaries, he joined the history department at BYU in 1964, where he was department chair from 1981‚Äì1987. After his retirement in 1992, he was a senior research fellow at the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History. Early life and education On June 14, 1927, Allen was born in Ogden, Utah. During his childhood, his family lived in Coalville, Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, Fairview, Wyoming, and Afton, Wyoming. His family moved to Logan, Utah when he was ten, to give him and his siblings the opportunity to go to college. After graduating from high school in 1945, he joined the U.S. Navy and became a Navy photographer in Washington, D.C. A member of the LDS Church, he served as a proselyting missionary in the California Mission under Oscar W. McConkie from 1948‚Äì1950, \\"without purse or scrip,\\" depending on the generosity of others for his room and board. As an undergraduate student, Allen attended USU in Logan, receiving a B.A. in history in 1954. George Ellsworth and Eugene Campbell were two of his most influential teachers. During Campbell's graduate history seminar on how to write history, which Allen took as a senior undergraduate, Allen met Leonard J. Arrington, a new economics professor and classmate who greatly influenced Allen's career. Allen's paper from that seminar was published in Utah Historical Quarterly in 1955 and became the basis for his graduate studies. Allen pursued his M.A. in history at BYU, with Dr. Richard D. Poll as his major professor. In 1956, he completed his thesis, The Development of County Government in the Territory of Utah, 1850-1896, which drew from his earlier published article. Allen attended the University of Southern California on a full-tuition scholarship and received a Ph.D. in history in 1963. His dissertation, The Company Town in the American West, was later published as a book by the University of Oklahoma Press. Career Starting in 1954, Allen worked for the Church Educational System (CES) in a variety of roles. In Kaysville, Utah he was a seminary teacher, as well as in Cowley, Wyoming, where he was also the coordinator of seminaries from 1955-7. He taught at LDS Institutes of Religion for nine years, and was director of the institutes in Long Beach and San Bernardino, California while pursuing his doctorate at USC. Allen joined the religion faculty at BYU in 1963, and then the history department in 1964. He taught both religion and history classes. In the early 1970s he was the doctoral major professor and mentor of Ron Esplin, who would become another notable Mormon historian. He was chair of the history department from 1981‚Äì1987, and afterward held the Lemuel Hardison Redd Jr. Chair in Western American History, until his 1992 retirement. From 1992‚Äì2005, he was a senior research fellow with BYU's Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History, and served on its executive committee for a time. In 2002, he taught in the History Department of Brigham Young University‚ÄîHawaii as a volunteer. He co-edited The Joseph Smith Papers, Journals, Vol. 2. Fellow historian Davis Bitton listed James B. Allen as a historian who maintains his church membership while also having a deep understanding of church history, arguing that the existence of faithful historians shows that a knowledge of LDS church history does not necessarily lead to leaving the church. =Mormon History Association= In 1965, Allen was one of the founders of the Mormon History Association (MHA), along with Leonard J. Arrington. He served as its vice-president in 1970 and president in 1972. Representing the MHA, Allen wrote and edited the \\"Historian's Corner,\\" a semi-annual column in the quarterly BYU Studies from 1970‚Äì1982, when he was succeeded by Ronald W. Walker. The Mormon History Association selected Allen to discuss the impact of the Hoffman forgeries, describing Allen as \\"a senior historian whose work has commanded respect among [his] colleagues.\\" =Assistant Church Historian= In 1972, Allen was called to be an Assistant Church Historian for the LDS Church, at the request of Leonard J. Arrington. He served half time in that capacity, continuing his BYU professorship at the same time. Arrington had assembled a team of professional historians to engage in new academic research with use of the church archives. Among the first major publications to emerge was The Story of the Latter-day Saints, a comprehensive single-volume history of the LDS Church written by Allen and Glen M. Leonard, a Senior Historical Associate in the church's Historical Department, and published in 1976. The book was well-received by the general and academic audiences, but some church leaders were uncomfortable. Allen's philosophy was to directly address historical controversies, while casting them against the context of their own time. Ezra Taft Benson denounced the book as new history that was \\"underplaying revelation\\" at a fireside and later, at an address for CES instructors. It was not republished for years, despite its popularity. Spencer W. Kimball and Howard W. Hunter both privately praised the book. In 1979, Allen resigned as Assistant Church Historian and returned full-time to BYU. Around this time, the department's History Division came under greater suspicion and scrutiny, and its staff and programs were curtailed before being transferred to BYU in 1982 as the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History. At BYU, Allen was treated in \\"a scandalous way\\" by some religion faculty who were unhappy with his book. Later, some university trustees had reservations about Allen's 1981 appointment as chair of the history department. However, he retained leadership roles at BYU until his 1992 retirement, when he rejoined the staff and programs from the old History Division, at BYU's Joseph Fielding Smith Institute.  Personal life  Allen served in his church throughout his life, including as a Bishop of a student ward at Brigham Young University (BYU) in the 1960s and a stake high councilor. In politics, he also served for a time as a District Republican committeeman. From 1999-2000, Allen and his wife served as full-time missionaries for the Church Education System at the Boston Institute of Religion. Allen lives in Orem, Utah and is married to Ren√©e Jones. They have five children and twenty grandchildren. One of his daughters married the writer Orson Scott Card. Orson Scott Card cites his admiration for Allen as having \\"the kind of skepticism [...] that is a servant to orthodox faith.\\" Allen's younger brother, John H. Allen, was a Colonel in the United States Army Reserve, the commander over the Judge Advocate General units of the 96th Sustainment Brigade, and a Federal Bankruptcy Judge.

He played for the Central Districts and the Wellington in the State Championship in New Zealand. He bowled left-arm, either fast-medium or slow left arm orthodox, batted left-handed. Despite being born in New Zealand, West qualified to play for Ireland in late 2008 and made his first appearance for the team the same year. In 2011 West, at the age of 31, announced his retirement due to an injury to his left shoulder; his last match for Ireland was in August 2009. Career =New Zealand= Although he would later qualify for Ireland and represent them in international cricket, West began his professional cricketing career in New Zealand, the country of his birth. He made his first-class debut on 22 March 1997, aged 17. In the match, he represented Central Districts in a match against Northern Districts. Though he did not bat, West was line up to come in at number seven. He took 1 wicket in the match for 38 runs (1/38), that of Matthew Hart. West's first taste of international cricket came in early 1998 when he represented New Zealand Under-19s in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He played all of his six Youth ODIs in the tournament. During the World Cup, he played alongside people such as James Franklin who went on to represent New Zealand in Tests and ODIs. From the 1996/97 season to the 2004/05 season, West played 13 first-class matches for Central Districts, scoring 211 runs at an average of 16.23 with a highest score of 44, and took 25 wickets at an average of 43.48. He also played one match for Wellington in the 2000/01 season, but went wicketless in the match. =Ireland= West was a member of Instonians in 2003 and in 2004 he moved to Bangor Cricket Club where he was the team's professional player for two seasons. He moved to Belfast after marrying a girl from Northern Ireland. As early as 2005, when he finished top of the Northern Cricket Union batting averages and was named Northern Ireland Player of the Year, there was speculation that West might play for Ireland. At the end of the 2005 season, West moved back to Instonians where he was a local player rather than a professional, stating \\"I enjoyed my two years at Bangor and made a lot of friends there, however, now that I am working full time [in an accountants' firm] and living in Belfast it seemed a natural move to come back to Instonians\\". During his second stint with Instonians, West was occasionally suffered disciplinary problems, and on his departure from the club to join Civil Service North at the end of 2007, West said \\"I don't want to see another disciplinary committee room. I am sick of it and they are probably sick of me\\". On signing West, the Civil Service North captain said \\"In Regan, we have signed a quality batsman and a quality bowler ‚Äì indeed he is two players in one\\". At the end of the 2008 season, West qualified to play for Ireland through residency. It was his intention to play for Ireland, and although he was not certain of selection he worked in his fitness in the off-season in the hope of being picked. Soon after qualifying, he made his debut for the team 25 August 2008. The match, a One Day International against Kenya, was not only his maiden international match and his first for Ireland, but his list A debut. The match was abandoned due to the weather before Ireland had a chance to bowl. West made his first-class debut for Ireland on 3 October the same year; the match was against Namibia in the 2007‚Äì08 ICC Intercontinental Cup. West did not bowl until Namibia's second innings and then only bowled two overs as Ireland bowled Namibia out cheaply in each innings. He did not bowl in ODIs until his second ODI which was on 18 October 2008, again against Kenya. He took 2/35 from 10 overs and his maiden wicket was that of batsman Rakep Patel. In April 2009, West took his first five-wicket haul in one-day matches during the ICC World Cup Qualifier. In a match against the Oman national cricket team on 2 April, West took 5/26 in Ireland's 116-run victory, beating his previous best bowling figures in one-day matches of 2/35. Ireland won the tournament and West finished with 14 wickets at an average of 22.92 from 10 matches and was Ireland's second highest wicket-taker in the tournament. His haul of 7/88 in the first innings of the 2009 Intercontinental Cup clash against Scotland at Mannonfield in Aberdeen, is a record for Ireland in the competition and the best first-class return since Garfield Harrison's 9/113 against the same opposition in Edinburgh in 1990. West was one of seven Ireland players to be nominated for the 2009 Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year (there were fourteen nominees in all), although he did not make the 4-man short-list. For the summer of 2010, West was unable to play due to injury, and in his absence George Dockrell emerged as Ireland's premier spinner. West announced his retirement from international cricket in April 2011. His decision was caused by a serious injury to his left should; it was believed that he risked damaging it. Reflecting on his time playing for Ireland, West said \\"Being part of the Ireland team has been the highlight and most enjoyable time of my cricket career. I feel very privileged to have had the opportunity to represent Ireland, and it is sad for me that that is now over.\\" References External links * CricketArchive stats * Cricinfo player profile Category:1979 births Category:Irish cricketers Category:Ireland One Day International cricketers Category:Ireland Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Central Districts cricketers Category:Wellington cricketers Category:Cricketers from New Plymouth Category:Living people Category:Instonians cricketers ","title":"Regan West"},{"id":"20068858","title":"Alpine skiing at the 1980 Winter Paralympics"},{"id":"20068907","text":"The New Melville Bridge Club is a contract bridge club situated a little outside the centre of Edinburgh.

In November 2012, the regulator, OFCOM, offered a five-year extension to the licence which will keep the station on air until February 2018. In April 2015,as a result of changes in the law, Phonic.FM, together with 18 other stations previously denied access to either advertising or sponsorship, had their promises of performance altered to allow them to accept either, up to a centrally controlled limit. The Directors of Phonic.FM took the decision NOT to accept paid for advertising, and are considering their position on the question of sponsorship.

It was commissioned by the Berliner Philharmoniker as part of the orchestra's centenary celebrations in 1982. Unlike its immediate predecessors, Henze has stated that this work is very much a 'German' symphony, in the Beethovenian tradition.Henze, Hans Werner (1992) Liner notes to EMI recording CDC 754762 2 Accordingly, it is cast in four movements and is broadly analogous to the 'classical' form: Introduction, slow movement, Scherzo and Finale. However Henze uses even more traditional German motifs across the movements: an allemande (a German dance) in the first and Liedform in the second. For the two final movements he focuses on the eighteenth-century poet Friedrich H√∂lderlin, incarcerated at T√ºbingen where he was subjected to what amounted to torture in the name of medical intervention. The final movement is a deeply lyrical orchestral setting of H√∂lderlin's late poem H√§lfte des Lebens (Half of Life). Performances The premiere was given by the Berliner Philharmoniker under Gianluigi Gelmetti in 1984. In that performance the work took 44 minutes.

It was the third pay-per- view of the In Your House series and consisted of ten professional wrestling matches. The main event of the show featured all three active championships in the WWF at the time being defended. The WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel teamed up with the WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels and they were slated to take on the reigning WWF Tag Team Champions Yokozuna and Owen Hart in a match where the person who was pinned would lose the championship. As part of the storyline the WWF replaced Owen Hart with The British Bulldog, due to Hart's wife being in labor. In the end Owen Hart did appear at the show and was pinned to end the match, but since he was not deemed the legal man in the match, the next night on Raw, the WWF Tag Team Championship was awarded back to Hart and Yokozuna. The PPV portion of the show featured six matches in total and the WWF held four additional matches that were only seen by the people in the arena. With the launch of the WWE Network in 2014 the PPV section became available to subscribers to view on demand. Storylines The professional wrestling matches at In Your House 3 featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Storylines between the characters played out on WWF's primary television programs, Monday Night Raw. Event In the main event, three championships were on the line: Diesel's WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Shawn Michaels' WWF Intercontinental Championship, and Yokozuna and Owen Hart's WWF Tag Team Championship. If Diesel had been pinned, he would have lost the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and if Michaels had been pinned he would have lost the Intercontinental Championship. On the night of the show the WWF announced that The British Bulldog had to replace Owen Hart in the match, as Hart was with his wife at the hospital, as she was giving birth to their second child. Near the end of the match it was revealed that this was just a storyline as Owen Hart rushed to the ring in full wrestling gear and interfered in the match. Moments later Diesel pinned Owen Hart to win the match and supposedly win the tag team championship, but it was later announced that while Diesel and Michaels did win the match they did not win the tag team championship as Owen Hart was not the legal man in the match. Aftermath The following month's In Your House, In Your House 4 or October 22, 1995, saw Diesel successfully defend the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the British Bulldog as they concluded the storyline feud between the two that had been building since the Bulldog turned on Diesel in August of that year. At the same show it was revealed that Shawn Michaels was unable to compete after being in a fight with a number of Marines and he had to forfeit the WWF Intercontinental Championship to Dean Douglas. Yokozuna and Owen Hart were given the tag team championship belts back after In Your House 3, but lost them to The Smoking Gunns (Billy Gunn and Bart Gunn) a short time later.

During the 2004 \\"North Carolina Main Street\\" 24th Annual Awards Banquet, Pigs in the City won Best Downtown Special Event for their first event in 2003. The event drew over 40,000 visitors from all over the state in its first year. It became an annual event after 2006. The cost to \\"sponsor\\" one of the 20 pigs on display was $1,000 during the first exhibition, which paid for the initiative. There was some controversy as the \\"Root for the Troops\\" pig was stolen from its perch in front of the Army & Navy Store on Main Street. The fourth annual \\"Pigs in the City\\" event was held from May 23 through October 23, 2008, and was called \\"Power of the Pig.\\" The pigs were also on display during the 25th Anniversary Lexington Barbecue Festival and during the Official Food Festival of the Piedmont Triad Region of the State of North Carolina, a one-day event that usually draws up to 150,000 visitors from all over the nation to Lexington, a town of about 20,000 residents.

Life Arthur Hildersham was born at Stetchworth, and brought up as a Roman Catholic. He was educated in Saffron Walden and at Christ's College, Cambridge. Through the patronage of Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, he became vicar of St Helen's Church, Ashby-de-la-Zouch. According to Benjamin Brook, the Leicestershire connection was through the good offices of John Ireton, who became vicar of Kegworth, and who offered help to Hildersham when his family objected to his conversion to Protestantism.Benjamin Brook, The Lives of the Puritans (1813), p. 377.

Fragoria is set in a massive, fully realized world based on Slavic fairy tales and legends of the modern world. There are more than 800 quests that can be played and several dungeons that can be explored. There are also a handful of PvP games to become involved in, ranging from simple 1 on 1 duels to full-scale wars with objectives. The game features an advanced pet system, an auction house for players to sell their items, a mail system, an extensive crafting system and four professions to choose from. The game is played on the Adobe Flash engine, in an isometric 3D perspective. It has been praised for its ability to efficiently use the engine. The game principle of the fantasy role-playing game is orientated to the games Diablo and World of Warcraft (WoW). Game Fragoria takes place within a fantasy environment. The expansive game world is inhabited by many creatures. There are PvE and PvP battles in the game. This allows for multiple variations of combat to happen within the world. At the beginning of the game the player needs to create a character which is then born in Heaven. Each player can create up to four characters on each server, of which there are several. Characters evolve mainly by completing quests starting from the first level, however they can kill monsters to loot the bodies. The crafting mechanic is an important part of the game; players are able to create useful items, that are sometimes not available except by buying them with a \\"premium\\" currency that has a real-life exchange rate known as Emeralds. Abilities of the characters can be improved by purchase of books (with in-game currency) or change of class. Starting from the thirteenth level players can go to varying dungeons of three types. There are plenty of communication means among players in the game, including in-game posts and chat box, community is created and evolved within guilds and alliances. Game is imitating a real world society with inequality, wealth classes and interactions. Consequently, the game has a dynamic social and economic environment. = Quests = Civilians always have something helpful to say, they often need help and will end up helping you as well. It is advised that you always talk to them to make sure you are not missing out on anything important. After helping civilians you will get useful items, experience, money, essential information or reputation of various organisations. There are several basic types of quests: * Search for an NPC- Sometimes civilians will ask you to search for their missing friends or strangers. * Find or trade an item - Sometimes civilians need to find something, gather materials, or send a letter. * Kill monsters - Often, civilians encounter annoying beasts and horrific monsters and will need your help getting rid of them. Most quests can be done only once, but there are repeatable quests that you may perform multiple times. Assignments vary in terms of difficulty, and your quest log will show the names of the quests and their icons in different colors accordingly. * Very simple quests appear white, and their icons - gray. * Simple quests are shown in green. * Average quests are shown in yellow. * Difficult quests are shown in orange. = PvP Battles = In Fragoria there are special PvP-locations on which battles between characters are resolved. Basically, it is locations for characters above 15 levels. For convenience of battles between characters there are some PvP -modes: * Peace mode - the character at all does not attack other characters. * Free mode - the character will attack all other characters. * Group mode - the character will attack all other characters except for those who consists in one group with it. * Guild mode - the character will attack all other characters except for those who consists in one guild with it. * Only malicious - the character will attack only Characters. On some locations there is special PvP a zone - Arena. It is presented by the round closed arena on which there is not enough place for movings. On arena two characters having a difference on levels. Having exposed the character on duel and having waited the opponent, you need to make preliminary rates on an outcome of duel. To generate prize-winning fund which is received by the winner. On arena the opportunity to make the rate on \\"death\\" of fights also is given to spectators of fights. \\"Many guilds from different servers fights with each other on special lands and on special boss events. At the same time there are many PVP games like \\"Capture the flag\\", \\"King of the hill\\", \\"Last man standing\\" where players can enjoy the game and get the reward with a short time.\\" = Pets = Characters can have pets. Pet is a character's companion, able to help in a difficult situation, to protect in fight, to strengthen the character or to weaken the opponent. Companions serve as true assistants in fight, both against monsters and against other characters. = Game currency = The game has three kinds of currencies: gold, emeralds and signs. Gold is a game currency, emeralds is a premium currency and signs can be gained in PvP battles. Gold is the most generic currency in the game, and comes in 3 denominations.https://fragoria.subagames.com/cash.aspx =Classes= On the first levels all characters have one class, which combines features of both, a warrior and magician. On levels 8, 15, and 31 players can choose a new class. In total there are 18 classes in the game that determine character's skills and evolution.

He was a monk of the Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg and former chaplain to Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth of Poland, whence he knew the Pomeranian language of the temporarily Polish-subjugated West Slavic population, whereas the Joms Vikings and other Germanic inhabitants of the Pomeranian coast understood his old German language. Life Adalbert participated in the conversion of the pagan inhabitants of Pomerania (Lutici and Slavic Pomeranians) during the missionary expeditions of Otto of Bamberg in 1124 and 1128, when he aided Otto as his assistant and interpreter. Adalbert is assumed to be of Polish origin.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p. 29, The territory was put under the jurisdiction of the archbishopric of Magdeburg by Holy Roman emperor Otto I, King of Germany. In 1133 the Magdeburg archbishop Saint Norbert received verification by the pope of his jurisdiction over a number of dioceses, including those in Pomerania. However, bishop Otto of Bamberg had actually baptized the Pomeranians and therefore thought to add it to his southern Bamberg archdiocese and in order to avoid conflicts, pope Innocent II exempted the Pomeranian bishopric(s). Otto did not succeed during his lifetime in founding a diocese, due to a conflict between the archbishops of Magdeburg and Gniezno about ecclesiastical hegemony in the area.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, 1999, p. 47, : \\"...gelang es ihm nicht, ein pommersches Bistum ins Leben zu rufen ‚Äì vermutlich eine Folge der Kompetenzstreitigkeiten zwischen den Erzbist√ºmern Gnesen und Magdeburg.\\" Pope Innocent II founded the diocese by a papal bull of 14 October 1140, and made the church of St. Adalbert at (Julin (Wollin/Wolin) on Wollin/Wolin island the see of the diocese.PEK History (German) PEK History (Polish)Norbert Buske, Pommern, Schwerin: Helms, 1997, p. 14, In the bull, the new diocese was placed \\"under the protection of the see of the Holy Peter\\", thwarting ambitions of the archbishops of Magdeburg and Gniezno, who both wanted to incorporate the new diocese as suffragan into their archdioceses. Otto had recommended his chaplain Adalbert as bishop, which was supported by Ratibor I, Duke of Pomerania. Adalbert was consecrated bishop at Rome. Adalbert and Ratibor I founded Stolpe Abbey at the side of Wartislaw I's assassination by a pagan in 1153, the first monastery in Pomerania. The new foundation was occupied by monks from Berge Abbey near Magdeburg and all churches to be built in the future were subordinated to it. In 1147, the Wendish Crusade, a campaign of the Northern Crusades, was mounted by bishops and nobles of the Holy Roman Empire. The crusaders pillaged the land and besieged Demmin and Szczecin despite the fact that both towns were (officially) Christian already. Adalbert took part in the negotiations that finally led to the lifting of the Szczecin siege by the crusaders.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.31, After the death of Duke Ratibor I, Adalbert received the same support from his two nephews, Dukes Bogislaw I and Kasimir I. His last act was the confirmation of the richly gifted Grobe Monastery near Usedom, founded by Ratibor I, on 8 June 1159. When Wolin was destroyed by Danes in the late 12th century, the diocese was moved to Cammin (also Kammin, now Kamie≈Ñ Pomorski ); this bishopric became known as the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kammin.

Early years Gord was born in Toronto General Hospital. His parents, Henry and Goldie Gord, were also native Torontonians and Ken was their middle child. Gord graduated from Bathurst Heights Secondary School and then enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts program at the University of Toronto but dropped out after completing the second of three years. He teamed up with two friends and began promoting rock concerts. On October 3, 1969, they successfully brought Johnny Winter to Massey Hall and on October 14, 1969, they brought The Who to the Canadian National Exhibition Colisseum to perform their rock opera, Tommy. Other bands brought to Toronto included The Byrds and Pentangle. Film Gord became involved in the film industry in Toronto, Ontario in the early 1970s. He produced the ultra-low budget Dream On The Run in 1973 and was production manager on another no-budget Canadian feature Point of No Return. In 1977, he produced the low-budget sci-fi film Starship Invasions, which was distributed by Warner Bros. and in 1979, The High Country for Crown International. He continued to production manage and/or line produce other low-budget films and television shows. Some examples include Deadly Eyes, Loose Screws, Recruits, Busted Up, Mr. Nice Guy, The Housekeeper, The Edison Twins and The Brain, through the 1980s. In 1986, he was co-producer on Criminal Law, the first feature directed by Martin Campbell, starring Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon. The movie was produced for Hemdale Film Corporation and distributed by Warner Bros. In 1988, he was the Canadian Executive in Charge of Production on the mini-series Day One, for CBS and Aaron Spelling Productions, which won an Emmy in 1989 for Best Drama Special. In 1991 and 1992, Gord produced two seasons of the CBS late-night crime show Sweating Bullets (aka Tropical Heat) in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and Eilat, Israel. This led him to what he was perhaps best known for, as the producer of the hit syndicated series Highlander: The Series, which filmed six seasons through the 1990s. Mr. Gord was brought in at the beginning of Season 2 and stayed as the creative producer until the last episode was filmed in Paris in 1998. The series was nominated for a Canadian Gemini Award as Best Dramatic Series in 1992. Since then, he has produced other syndicated series, such as the Paris episodes of Relic Hunter and a season of Queen of Swords, shot in Almeria, Spain at Texas Hollywood. He has also produced over twenty mini-series and television movies for CBS, the Fox Network, UPN, Global Television Network, CTV, Lifetime Network, Paramount Television, Paxnet, Sat-1, Turner Broadcasting, and CLT-ufa. These included CBS's Daughter of Darkness, which starred Anthony Perkins and Model By Day, starring Famke Janssen. In 2006, he produced Eight Days to Live, which was the most successful in-house television movie ever broadcast on CTV, and also broke records on the Lifetime Network. It was nominated for a Canadian Gemini Award as Best Television Movie in 2007. In 2007, Gord produced Stuck, directed by Stuart Gordon and starring Mena Suvari and Stephen Rea to critical acclaim. The New York Times called it a \\"...grim, expert little thriller...\\" He produced XIII, a 4-hour mini-series from the graphic novel of the same name, starring Val Kilmer. It aired on NBC and Global Television in Canada during the winter of 2008.

Below is a partial list of activities offered nationally during 2008:  Air Force Careers  As the official auxiliary of the United States Air Force, CAP has access to USAF facilities and personnel. The Air Force sponsors several schools, each of which focuses on a different area of Air Force culture. = Air Force Pararescue Orientation Course = In this physically demanding activity, Cadets work with actual Pararescuemen learning land navigation, wilderness survival, climbing and rappelling and other Pararescue-related skills. This course is often abbreviated PJOC. = Air Force Space Command Familiarization Courses = Designed for Cadets with an interest in space-related careers, this course provides an in-depth look at the capabilities and responsibilities of Air Force Space Command. Cadets learn about missile operations, space command and control, space lift, and orbital mechanics. There are two locations offered for this activity. The first being Peterson AFB, CO which as a focus on space command and operations. In the past, cadets who attend the Peterson AFB location have visited Schriever AFB, the Air Force Academy, Lockheed Martin, and Cheyenne Mountain. The other location offered is Patrick AFB, FL. This location has a focus on launch operations based at the Morrell Operations Center and Cape Canaveral launch site. = Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training Familiarization Courses = A glimpse of the training that makes an Air Force pilot, this school includes heavy academics, flight facilities tours and simulator time. This course was previously known as the Air Education and Training Command Familiarization Course.  Aviation Careers  = Aircraft Maintenance & Manufacturing Orientation Course = Co-sponsored by Cessna, this activity shows aircraft construction and maintenance techniques. Students receive tours of the Cessna Aircraft factory. = Airline Careers Exploration = A hands on activity where cadets learn about careers within the airline industry. Students work with pilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics and flight attendants to better understand how Airlines operate. = National Blue Beret Activity = Participants help conduct EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the world's largest airshow. This is a 'working vacation' and duties include aircraft marshaling, crowd control and ELT deactivation. = National Flight Academy (Powered & Glider) = Cadets who are at least 14 years old for glider and 16 for powered are eligible for the week-long National Flight Academy (NFA). Here, cadets go through high intensity instructive training both on the ground and in the air. Academies for powered flight (operating CAP Cessna 172 models) and glider flight (operating CAP LET L-13 Blan√≠k models) are separate, so students may choose to apply to and attend either or both. Cadets are paired with instructors and take daily flight lessons based on lessons learned in daily ground school sessions, as well as nightly homework readings. In addition, students are required to be prepared for any emergency that may threaten the aircraft or crew. The purpose of NFA is to guarantee 10 hours of quality flight instruction to the students. However, due to the high intensity training, most students, pending their instructors permission, will be given the opportunity to solo, or pre-solo in the case of gliders, the aircraft. Depending on the academy, anywhere from 50-80% of student will graduate with their solo rating. = EAA Air Academy = In addition to orientation flight time, Cadets study the flight, weather, navigation and aircraft construction. = Space Camp = Cadets participate in United States Space Camp, conducted at the United States Space & Rocket Center, this course focuses on space exploration, and features flight simulation, physiology, crew equipment and more. = Aviation Challenge = CAP sponsors cadets to participate in the Aviation Challenge. This activity is not exclusive to CAP members.  Leadership Careers  = Cadet Officer School = Based on the Air Force's Squadron Officer's School, Cadet Officer School is CAP's keystone leadership school. Open to cadet officers, it is held at the Air University at Maxwell AFB and teaches critical thinking, active decision making, operational and strategic leadership, and air power theories, as well as relating the principles learned at the school into real life situations. This activity is prerequisite, along with RCLS, in order to promote to the grade of Cadet Lt. Colonel. = Civic Leadership Academy = Held in Washington, D.C., this course explores the functions of American government and political processes. = Hawk Mountain Ranger School = The Colonel Phillip Neuweiler Ranger Training Facility at Hawk Mountain, Pennsylvania, is the oldest continually operated school of search and rescue in the United States. This activity teaches basic and advanced SAR techniques, such as survival, rope work, first aid and leadership. = Honor Guard Academy = This activity teaches Air Force Honor Guard techniques and provides instruction on creating an Honor Guard at a Cadet's home unit. Cadets are also taught military discipline and protocol of the type required by a Honorguardsman, as well as the four elements of the Honor Guard: the Ceremonial/Demonstration Element, the Colors Element, the Funeral Element and the Drama Element (which involves plays and skits promoting a drug-free lifestyle and depicting the consequences of abusing illegal substances). = National Emergency Services Academy (Commonly referred to as NESA) = An in-depth SAR school teaching all aspects of the CAP Emergency Services mission. This school is organized into three branches, the National Ground Search and Rescue School, the Incident Command Systems School, and the Mission Air School. Each branch runs several schools each year within the two weeks NESA is in session. = IACE = Perhaps the premier National Cadet Special Activity of the Civil Air Patrol, IACE is an opportunity for two weeks of international travel to countries around the world and meet cadets of other cadet aerospace organizations.  Technology Careers  = Advanced Technologies Academy = Cadets gain hands on experience with new technologies being employed by Civil Air Patrol. = Engineering & Technology Academy = Cadets are introduced to several engineering disciplines by completing hands-on projects. Cadets mentor and learn from professors, NASA employees, or Air Force researchers.  Obsolete Activities  = Air Force Weather Agency Familiarization Course = For Cadets interested in meteorology, this provides a chance to work with members of the Air Force Weather Agency and see how weather is forecast and interpreted using state of the art equipment. = National Military Music Academy = An academy based on military music offered from 2000 to 2006.https://www.cap75th.com/history/timeline NMMA was for musically skilled cadets age 12 to 21 and seniors, adults over 18, who are or have been involved in active musical organizations or school music programs. Its objective was to provide music and leadership training and to assist CAP members in introducing a music program into local CAP units and community events, e.g. opening/closing flag ceremonies, protocol functions, Tap‚Äôs, memorial services, parades, etc. While at NMMA, Cadets learned about military music and protocol by performing in and attending several events. The first week was devoted to learning about the musical heritage and preparing to participate in the Connecticut‚Äôs Deep River Ancient Muster Parade playing fifes, bugles and drums. Other performances were a local fireman‚Äôs parade in Arbutus, Md., the Korean War Veterans Armistice Day ceremonies conducted at the National Mall and Arlington National Cemetery.

Background  Li Su was born in 773, during the reign of Emperor Daizong. His father was Li Sheng, who would later rise to prominence as a major general during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong.

His birth mother died early, so he was raised by another concubine of Li Sheng's, Lady Wang, who was created the Lady of Jin. When Lady Wang died, Li Sheng, because she was not his wife, did not have Li Su observe the mourning rites for a mother, but Li Su tearfully requested to be allowed to observe those rituals, and Li Sheng agreed.Old Book of Tang, vol. 133. After Li Sheng died in 793, Li Su and his brother Li Xian () built a tent next to Li Sheng's tomb, intending to observe the mourning period there. Emperor Dezong, believing the conditions were too harsh, ordered them to return to their own mansion, but after they went home for one night, the next day they were at the tomb again, and Emperor Dezong allowed them to continue to observe the mourning period there. After the mourning period was over, Li Su was made a member of the staff of Li Song the Crown Prince. He later served successively as the prefect of Fang (ÂùäÂ∑û, in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi) and then Jin (ÊôâÂ∑û, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) Prefectures, and was given the honorary title Jinzi Guanglu Daifu () on account of his virtues. He later was recalled to again serve on the Crown Prince's staff, and later served as the head of the Crown Prince's household.As the historical accounts do not specify when Li Su was recalled or which emperor recalled him to serve on the Crown Prince's staff, it is unclear which crown prince he served as to this stint.  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  = During the campaign against Wu Yuanji = It was said that Li Su was full of strategies and capable in horsemanship and archery. In 816, during the reign of Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong, imperial troops were conducting a campaign against the warlord Wu Yuanji, who controlled Zhangyi Circuit (ÂΩ∞Áæ©, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan)) without imperial approval, two successive imperial generals put in command of nearby Tangsuideng Circuit (ÂîêÈö®ÈÑß, headquartered in modern Zhumadian) ‚Äî Gao Xiayu () and Yuan Zi ‚Äî had suffered defeats by Zhangyi troops. Li Su volunteered to serve in the campaign, and the chancellor Li Fengji also knew of Li Su's abilities, and therefore recommended him. Emperor Xianzong thus made Li Su the military governor (Jiedushi) of Tangsuideng Circuit, as well as the prefect of its capital Tang Prefecture (), replacing Yuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. When Li Su reached the front in spring 817, it was said that the Tangsuideng soldiers, having suffered many defeats, were fearful of war. Li Su first comforted them by stating that his intentions were not to engage in battles immediately, and further personally attended to the wounded, to try to raise the morale. He also acted as if he was not taking military discipline seriously and not taking precautions toward Zhangyi troops, in order to get Zhangyi's guards down toward him. With Li Su not being well-known and the Zhangyi troops having just defeated Gao and Yuan, Zhangyi did not take particular precautions toward Li Su.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 240. Li Su, meanwhile, requested and received reinforcements from several circuits. He then began to carry out military actions in which he targeted Zhangyi officers, captured them, and then treated them well and incorporated them into his command structure, using their familiarity with Zhangyi's defenses against Zhangyi. Such Zhangyi officers he thus captured included Ding Shiliang (), Chen Guangqia (), Wu Xiulin (), Li Xian (ÊùéÊÜ≤, whose name Li Su changed to Li Zhongyi (), and Li You. His soldiers were particularly displeased at his endearment of Li You, pointing out that Li You had killed many imperial soldiers, and further accused Li You of being an agent of Wu. Li Su, in order to calm the soldiers, delivered Li You to Chang'an, ostensibly for Emperor Xianzong to execute him ‚Äî and instead sent a secret petition to Emperor Xianzong, stating that he could not succeed if Li You were executed. Emperor Xianzong thereafter pardoned Li You and delivered him back to Li Su. Li Su further abolished the former orders that those who took in Zhangyi spies would be executed ‚Äî instead ordering his people that if Zhangyi spies arrived, they were to be treated with kindness. As a result, the Zhangyi spies were turned toward Li Su and informed him about the status of Zhangyi troops. By summer 817, Li Su was formulating the strategy of making a surprise attack on Zhangyi's capital Cai Prefecture with Li You and Li Zhongyi, and he set apart 3,000 elite soldiers, calling them the Tujiang (), and trained them for this purpose. After a battle in which he failed in capturing Langshan (ÊúóÂ±±, in modern Zhumadian), the Tangsuideng troops were depressed, but Li Su stated happily, \\"This fits within my plans.\\" However, he could not launch his attack on Cai Prefecture at that time, with heavy rains drenching the land at that time. In fall 817, in a battle where Li Su attacked Wufang (Âê≥Êàø, in modern Zhumadian), Li Su launched the attack on a day considered to be wangwang (ÂæÄ‰∫°, i.e., a particular inopportune day for military action) on the Chinese calendar, against his officers' reservations, he caught the Wufang defenders unaware and quickly captured the outer city, forcing them to withdraw within the inner city. Li Su then withdrew to try to draw them out. Their commander Sun Xianzhong () thereafter attacked Li Su's rear. When Li Su's own soldiers panicked, Li Su got off his horse and sat on a chair, stating, \\"Anyone who dares to retreat further will be beheaded.\\" His soldiers thereafter fought back and killed Sun. When they then suggested that he attack Wufang's inner city and capture it, he responded, \\"That is not within my plan.\\" He then withdrew back to his own camp. Meanwhile, with another imperial general, Li Guangyan the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), frequently prevailing over Zhangyi forces, the most elite Zhangyi troops were stationed at Huiqu (Ê¥ÑÊõ≤, in modern Luohe, Henan), to defend against a possible Li Guangyan advancement. Li You thus suggested to Li Su that the defenses of Cai Prefecture would be particularly weakened and that the opportunity was right for an attack. Li Su reported his plan to the chancellor Pei Du, who had by this point been put in charge of the operations against Zhangyi, and Pei approved. On November 27, 817, at dusk, Li Su launched the attack, from his then-base of Wencheng Fence (ÊñáÊàêÊüµ, in modern Zhumadian), without informing anyone other than Li You and Li Zhongyi what the intended target was. He had Li You and Li Zhongyi command the 3,000 Tujiang soldiers as first stage troops, with himself and the eunuch monitor of the army commanding 3,000 soldiers as the second stage troops and the officer Li Jincheng () commanding 3,000 soldiers as the third stage troops. He attacked the village Zhangchai () and killed the Zhangyi soldiers stationed there, and then, with 500 soldiers requisitioned from Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) remaining there to block off potential aid troops from Langshan and Ding commanding 500 soldiers to destroy bridges between Cai Prefecture and Huiqu, he continued to advance. After the soldiers had dinner, he announced that the target was Cai Prefecture itself ‚Äî drawing much alarm from the officers and causing the eunuch monitor to cry bitterly, \\"We have fallen into Li You's trap!\\" At that time, there was a heavy snowstorm, such that Li Su's banner was torn, and some of his soldiers and horses were freezing to death, but he ordered continuing march forward. Just before dawn on November 28, Li Su's forces reached the walls of Cai Prefecture. Li You and Li Zhongyi led their soldiers in climbing up the walls, catching the wall defenders in their sleep and killing them. Li You and Li Zhongyi then entered the city and opened the gates to allow the rest of Li Su's forces in. Li Su took over Wu's headquarters and had the inner city, his mansion, where he was, surrounded. Believing that Wu's only hope was if the key Zhangyi commander Dong Chongzhi (), who was in command of the forces at Huiqu, quickly advanced back to save him, he visited Dong's household and comforted Dong's family, sending Dong's son Dong Chuandao () to Huiqu to summon him back. Dong Chongzhi immediately abandoned his troops and returned to Cai Prefecture to surrender to Li Su. Li Su had Li Jincheng attack the inner city, and by this point, the residents of Cai Prefecture were assisting Li Su's attack. On November 29, Wu surrendered, and Li Su arrested him and delivered him to Chang'an. Several days later, Pei arrived with the Zhangyi soldiers at Huiqu, who surrendered after Wu's capture. Li Su waited by the road to be ready to pay proper respect to Pei by military ceremony. Pei initially, in humility, wanted to avoid having Li Su bow to him, but Li Su pointed out that it was proper for them to demonstrate the proper etiquette for the imperial army before the surrendered soldiers and people of Cai Prefecture. Pei thus agreed. Li Su then returned to Wencheng Fence. His officers asked him the reasons why he was not displeased about the failure to capture Langshan, the decision not to capture Wufang, and the decision to march forward in the snowstorm. Li Su responded: = After the campaign against Wu Yuanji = In the aftermaths of the campaign, Li Su's Tangsuideng Circuit was merged back into the circuit that it was split from ‚Äî Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) ‚Äî and he was made the military governor of Shannan East. He was also created the Duke of Liang. At his urging, Emperor Xianzong, who had initially wanted to execute Dong Chongzhi, spared Dong but still exiled Dong to Chun Prefecture (Êò•Â∑û, in modern Yangjiang, Guangdong) to serve as its census officer. When Li Su subsequently submitted a list of 150 officers who contributed to the victory, requesting that Emperor Xianzong promote them, Emperor Xianzong was displeased by the lengthy list, stating to Pei, \\"While Li Su accomplished an uncommonly great achievement, he recommended too many people. Based on this, then, imagine how many people Li Sheng and Hun Jian could have recommended!\\" Emperor Xianzong thus did not act on Li Su's recommendations. Soon thereafter, with Emperor Xianzong considering a campaign on the western border against Tufan, in summer 818, he made Li Su the military governor of Fengxiang (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Longyou (Èö¥Âè≥, then also headquartered in modern Baoji) Circuits. Before Li Su could head to Fengxiang, however, Wu Yuanji's ally Li Shidao the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), who had, in fear after Wu's defeat, initially offered to surrender three of Pinglu's 12 prectures to imperial control, reneged on his offer. Emperor Xianzong, in anger, announced a campaign against Pinglu. Li Su was thereafter swapped in his posting with his brother Li Yuan () the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), which bordered Pinglu to the south, as well as the prefect of Wuning's capital Xu Prefecture (). Once Li Su got to Xu Prefecture, he reorganized the troops into greater efficiency. At Li Su's request, Emperor Xianzong pardoned Dong and recalled him, and Li Su subsequently made Dong a commander in his army. Li Su subsequently engaged in 11 battles with Pinglu forces, prevailing each time. Around the new year 819, he captured the key Pinglu city of Jinxiang (ÈáëÈÑâ, in modern Jining, Shandong), and thereafter continued to capture Pinglu cities.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241. Li Shidao was thereafter killed by his own subordinate Liu Wu, who submitted to imperial authority. While Li Su was still at Wuning, one of his subordinates recommended the physician Zheng Zhu to him, as he was often ill. Li Su's conditions improved after taking Zheng's medication, and he became closely associated with Zheng, such that Zheng became powerful over his staff members and were often interfering with governance. When the eunuch monitor Wang Shoucheng found the situation to be inappropriate and asked Li Su to remove Zheng from his staff, Li Su told him, \\"While Zheng Zhu is frivolous, he is talented. You should try to meet with him. If you really find him to be useless, I will remove him.\\" Wang initially did not want to meet Zheng, but eventually agreed. After he did so, he was also pleased by Zheng's amusing speech, and therefore also became closely associated with Zheng. Zheng, not wanting others to know about how he first became associated with Li Su and Wang, subsequently falsely accused the officer who had initially recommended him, and Li Su executed the officer.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243.  During Emperor Muzong's reign  In spring 820, Emperor Xianzong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong. Soon thereafter, Li Su was given the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). Further, in anticipation of potential further actions against two other circuits governed de facto independently ‚Äî Chengde (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) and Lulong (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) ‚Äî Emperor Muzong made Li Su the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi). Later that year, when Wang Chengzong the military governor of Chengde died, his brother Wang Chengyuan offered to return control of the circuit to the imperial government. Emperor Muzong, in response, moved Tian Hongzheng the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) ‚Äî itself having previously been semi-independent from imperial rule but which had submitted to imperial command during Tian Hongzheng's governance ‚Äî to Chengde, Wang Chengyuan to Yicheng, Liu Wu from Yicheng to Zhaoyi, Li Su from Zhaoyi to Weibo, and Tian Hongzheng's son Tian Bu to Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan). The Chengde soldiers, however, had long resented Tian Hongzheng, as during Emperor Xianzong's reign Chengde and Weibo forces had often battled each other. Initially, with Weibo soldiers accompanying Tian Hongzheng to Chengde and protecting him, they did not act, but as soon as Weibo soldiers returned to Weibo in summer 821, the Chengde officer Wang Tingcou rose in mutiny and killed Tian Hongzheng. Upon hearing of Tian Hongzheng's death, Li Su changed into mourning clothes, and he stated to his soldiers:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 242. The soldiers all wept in sadness. Meanwhile, Niu Yuanyi () the prefect of Shen Prefecture (Ê∑±Â∑û, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), was not willing to follow Wang. Li Su, hearing this, sent his sword and jade belt to Niu, sending a message to him: \\"My father had used this sword to accomplish great things. I have also used this sword to capture Cai Prefecture. Now I give it to you, Lord, and you should use it to destroy Wang Tingcou.\\" Niu was touched, and showed the sword and belt to his soldiers and stated, \\"I am willing to die for the empire.\\" Li Su was then preparing an attack against Wang in conjunction with Niu, but suddenly fell ill again. Emperor Muzong thus made Tian Bu the military governor of Weibo to succeed him. Li Su was given the title of advisor to the Crown Prince,However, as there was no crown prince at the time, the post was entirely honorary. and allowed to return to the eastern capital Luoyang to try to recover from illness. However, he died there in winter 821. He was buried with great honors.

This case was significant as not only was it a rare example of a murder on the islands, but it also called into question the way Stephen was dealt with by social services and led to questions in Parliament and an inquiry. Family William Thomas (Tom) Menheniott\\"Menheniott appeal\\", The Times, 3 February 1978 was born in Cornwall on 26 February 1924. His mother died when he was three months old and his father was apparently blind, so he and his brother George, who was three years older, were brought up in a children's home administered by the Public Assistance Committee. The regime was harsh and corporal punishment was often employed. At the age of fourteen, George ran away and, after working on a farm for a while, enlisted in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry.DHSS Report, p.9 When he reached the age of fourteen, Tom also ran away and joined the Army, where he qualified as a motor mechanic. In the 1940s he married Deirdre Philippa Maddern and they had two children. A girl, Deirdre Ann, was born on 18 January 1948 and taken into care by Cornwall County Council in infancy after Tom had been convicted of neglect, for which he was sent to prison. She was never reunited with her parents and was later fostered and attended a special school for children with learning difficulties. A boy, Christopher, was born on 7 February 1949. He too was taken into care and died from muscular dystrophy at the age of seventeen. In about 1950, Tom separated from his wife and moved in with a woman called Elizabeth Uren. She used the surname Menheniott, although they were never married. They had six children together (the last of which died in infancy), although Elizabeth appears to have already had six children.DHSS Report, p.26 A boy was born on 23 September 1950 and a girl on 14 July 1952. Both children were taken into care by Cornwall County Council in 1953 and both Tom and Elizabeth were convicted and imprisoned for neglect. After their release they began to travel around the country. A second son was born in Kent on 7 January 1955 and was soon afterwards taken into care by Kent County Council due to the family having no suitable accommodation. Tom assaulted the NSPCC inspector who dealt with the case. A second daughter was born on 27 May 1956.DHSS Report, pp.9‚Äì10 Tom also continued fathering children with his estranged wife Deirdre. She had a child named William Thomas Menheniott in around 1952 who was taken into care and later adopted. They also had a child named Walter in July 1953 who took the name Woods from Deirdre's new partner, Leslie Woods. Birth and early years, 1957‚Äì1959 Stephen was born in Redhill County Hospital, Surrey on 4 June 1957. His parents were at that time living in a caravan. The following year they became homeless, and on 13 January 1958 Stephen and his sister were taken into care by Surrey County Council and placed in a residential nursery at Epsom. At the end of January, the Menheniotts found alternative accommodation and their daughter was returned to them, but Stephen was not healthy and was kept in care. He was allowed home in August. His parents soon moved to Hailsham in East Sussex and four months later Stephen was admitted to hospital in Eastbourne in an undernourished condition. An NSPCC inspector described the conditions in which the Menheniotts lived as \\"deplorable\\". On 29 January 1959, the 19-month-old Stephen was taken into care direct from hospital by East Sussex County Council and placed in a residential nursery. Soon afterwards the Council assumed parental rights under Section 2 of the Children Act 1948, to the age of eighteen or until the resolution was rescinded.DHSS Report, p.10 In care, 1959‚Äì1968 In December 1959, at the age of 2¬Ω, Stephen was fostered by a young couple and seemed to be happy and doing well. However, in January 1961 his foster mother became pregnant with her first child, and Stephen's behaviour became highly disturbed. On 18 December 1961 he was readmitted to the residential nursery and it was decided that, due to his behaviour and his now obvious learning difficulties (\\"retardation\\" as it was then described), all contact with his foster parents should be severed. In February 1964 he was transferred to a children's home. From January 1962, he often visited and was visited by two local ladies who had offered to \\"befriend\\" a child as \\"aunties\\", and they became very fond of each other. In 1964, Stephen began attending a special school, but it was determined that he was too intelligent for this school (his IQ was assessed at 89), and in January 1966 he was transferred to the remedial class of the local primary school. He remained at this school and living in the children's home until July 1968, when he was eleven. In 1966, he began to visit his older brother, who was living with a foster family in Kent, but these visits were difficult as the brother (in common with many other people) found him somewhat irritating.DHSS Report, pp.10‚Äì12 The Isles of Scilly In 1962, Tom and Elizabeth Menheniott moved to a tied cottage (i.e. a cottage that comes with a job) in East Sussex and their youngest daughter was returned to them from the foster home in Hastings where she had spent the last eighteen months.DHSS Report, p.11 In 1965, the family moved to the Isles of Scilly.DHSS Report, p.12 The Isles of Scilly are very isolated and had a population at that time of about 2,400. The islands had no social services, although there was a Social Services Committee. By informal arrangement, Cornwall County Council provided any services that the islands could not provide for themselves.DHSS Report, p.21 Tom obtained employment with a daffodil farmer, and a small tied cottage went with the job. It was situated in the lonely hamlet of Holy Vale, at the far side of the main island of St Mary's and rarely visited by locals. The hamlet consisted of only three cottages, one of which was empty and one let to holidaymakers in season, and a farm. Tom was not particularly popular on the island, but he became something of a local 'character' and was seen as useful because of his mechanical skills (which he sometimes practised without charge). An unkempt, powerfully built man, he was known for his temper and bad language, but was also capable of acts of kindness. He was good at his job, got on well with his employer, and had apparently stopped drinking (he had previously been known as a heavy drinker).DHSS Report, pp.21‚Äì22 Return to family, 1968‚Äì1969 Tom Menheniott had been asking for news of his children since 1966 and Stephen appeared to want to see his father (although he rarely mentioned his mother); and in 1967 the children's officer for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly wrote to East Sussex County Council suggesting that, as the family now seemed to be settled, a visit could be arranged. On 15 August 1967, Stephen and his social worker set off for the Isles of Scilly, where the social worker reported that Tom was \\"brusque\\", \\"belligerent\\" and \\"intimidating\\". Stephen stayed with his family for twelve days, then returned to East Sussex. He began to regularly correspond with them and visited again at Christmas 1967 and Easter 1968. The two children in the care of Cornwall and the brother in care in Kent (who had run away from his foster parents in February 1968 and made his own way to the Isles of Scilly) were now living with their parents under \\"home on trial\\" arrangements. No signs of ill- treatment were seen, and after he had stayed with his family over the 1968 summer holidays, Stephen was allowed to stay permanently. He went to the local school with his brother and sister, and at first he seemed happy.DHSS Report, pp.13‚Äì14 The children were apparently always well-dressed and well-fed.DHSS Report, p.22 In care again, 1969‚Äì1972 However, things began to deteriorate. In April 1969, Stephen and his brother were caught stealing. In July 1969, the child care officer recorded that Stephen appeared to be frightened of his father and siblings. In September 1969, it was suggested that Elizabeth wished to leave her common law husband. In November 1969, Stephen confessed to the child care officer that he had probably been happier in care. He was also apparently being bullied by other children at school.DHSS Report, p.14 Things came to a head in November 1969, when the youngest daughter (who was thirteen) became pregnant and Tom was charged with incest. On 24 November 1969, all the children were removed and returned to the mainland. Tom was acquitted, but the pregnant daughter was still taken into care by the Isles of Scilly Council. The 15-year-old brother was found to have a fractured humerus and said that he had no wish to return to his family; he was returned to his foster home in Kent.DHSS Report, pp.14‚Äì15 Several of the children later admitted that they had had arms broken by Tom at one time or another, but were too frightened to report it at the time. Tom's relations with the other islanders deteriorated, as most of them seem to have believed that he was wrongly acquitted. Cornwall County Council proposed placing Stephen in a residential special school, but the educational psychologist who assessed him considered that this would be inappropriate as, although he was currently functioning at below average ability, he was of near average intelligence. Stephen himself expressed a desire to return to East Sussex and on 22 December 1969 his wishes were granted. However, Stephen then expressed a desire to return to his family. He was living in an assessment centre and was isolated, finding it difficult to make friends and being bullied, although he was popular with adults. He was likeable and polite, although he had occasional aggressive outbursts, usually directed at inanimate objects. For some reason, his two \\"aunties\\" were not informed of his return to the county. He was transferred to the centre's long stay unit, but did not attend school. He continued to correspond regularly with his family and began to ask to visit. His mother, however, was now living on the mainland (and was never to return to Tom) and only the oldest sister had returned to live with her father. She and Tom expressed a desire for Stephen's return. The children's officer for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly disagreed, describing Tom as \\"an aggressive psychopath and a morally corrupt man\\". However, social workers in East Sussex decided that Stephen needed his family and he was allowed to visit between 24 December 1971 and 5 January 1972.DHSS Report, pp.15‚Äì18 On 7 August 1972 he once again travelled to the Isles of Scilly, supposedly for a three- week visit. It was, however, obvious at this stage that he would not be expected to return to East Sussex. When the children's officer in Cornwall heard about this, she wrote to the director of social services of East Sussex expressing her deep disapproval and stating that it would be impossible for Cornwall Social Services to arrange any supervision due to the isolation of the location and the aggressive attitude of Tom Menheniott. East Sussex Social Services replied that they did not share her concern. Stephen was allowed to stay with his father and nobody from East Sussex Social Services ever visited him, despite the fact that East Sussex County Council had assumed parental rights until his eighteenth birthday. East Sussex closed their case file on Stephen.DHSS Report, pp.18‚Äì20 The family now consisted of Tom, his 20-year-old oldest daughter, her oldest child (she had two more children in the next two years), and the 17-year-old Stephen. Last years in the Isles of Scilly, 1972‚Äì1976 Stephen obtained employment as a shelf-stacker in a local supermarket, but was dismissed after about six months due to his poor personal hygiene. Shortly before this, the Council of the Isles reported to the children's officer that there seemed to be no problems. However, in April 1973 the youngest daughter and her boyfriend visited Holy Vale and Tom beat her up. Stephen was given employment by a flower farmer, but was reluctantly dismissed after it became obvious that he would never be able to work on his own. He may have later worked casually on the same farm as his father. Few people visited the increasingly squalid cottage and, apart from Tom, the Menheniotts were rarely seen around the island. When the community nurse visited to check up on the young children, she described Stephen as \\"looking like a frightened rabbit\\", but did not see any signs of physical injury.DHSS Report, p.23 However, in October 1975 Stephen visited the island's dentist, a Mr Fairest, where it was found that three of his front teeth were broken beyond repair.\\"Farmer 'buried battered son in corner of field'\\", The Times, 7 December 1977 In 1976, Stephen disappeared. His family claimed that he had gone to the mainland to visit a girlfriend. However, the dentist, Mr Fairest, had been troubled by the injuries he had witnessed, and reported his concerns to the police.DHSS Report, p.29 Some time later, Stephen's body was discovered buried in a shallow grave in California Field, near the cottage, with logs piled on top of it. It is likely that he died during the first week of 1976. The trial Thomas Menheniott was charged with murder, four counts of grievous bodily harm, and preventing an inquest by burying the body. He admitted the last charge, but denied the other five, and was committed for trial at Bodmin Crown Court. The trial began before Mr Justice Willis on 6 December 1977. The prosecutor, David Owen-Thomas QC, alleged that Tom beat his son over a period of years with high tension cables, scaffolding, a shovel, a broomstick, a fence post, and a potato tray. He also threw a knife and hot tea at him and punched him. He was tethered outside the cottage and not allowed to leave. He had five fractures on four ribs, one of which was fractured twice within days of his death. When he died his father put his body in his car and took him to California Field, before putting it in a wheelbarrow, covering it with a tarpaulin, and taking it to the grave he had already dug. On 16 December 1977, the jury of ten men and two women took almost four hours to return a guilty verdict on the murder charge, but were discharged from returning verdicts on the GBH charges. Tom was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, plus five years to run concurrently for concealing the body. The judge criticised the people of the Isles of Scilly (with the notable exception of Mr Fairest, whom he praised) for failing to help Stephen, and also Cornwall and East Sussex County Councils for their lack of supervision,\\"Government inquiry called for by judge after man is sentenced for murdering backward young son\\", The Times, 17 December 1977 although it was accepted by the later inquiry that Cornwall had no legal obligation to provide services to the Isles of Scilly.DHSS Report, p.31 Inquiries On 20 December 1977, an internal inquiry in East Sussex County Council found that the council failed to properly supervise Stephen once he had gone to live with his father.\\"Council criticized over dead boy\\", The Times, 21 December 1977 In January 1978, David Ennals, the Secretary of State for Social Services, instituted a departmental inquiry by Claris Jayne, Joan Acton and Jim Wheatley. This inquiry reported in September 1978. It met Elizabeth Menheniott, her other children, and Stephen's uncle, George Menheniott, now a chauffeur and gardener living in Hampshire, as well as members and employees of Cornwall and East Sussex County Councils and the Council of the Isles of Scilly, employees of the health authorities involved, and officers of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary.

Both countries established diplomatic relations on August 13, 1992. Bulgaria has had an embassy in Zagreb since 1994. Croatia has had an embassy in Sofia since 1992.  History  In the 9th and 10th centuries, when Bulgaria and Croatia shared a border, the two countries fought in the Croatian‚ÄìBulgarian wars. In the Middle Ages, there was commerce between the Bulgarian Empire and the Republic of Ragusa. In the late 19th and early 20th century, there were strong Bulgarian-Croatian relations in politics, culture, education and sport. Stjepan Radiƒá, one of the most prominent Croatian politicians of the era, wrote in his 1917 book that of all Slavs, Bulgarians were closest to Croats. Bulgarian-Croatian relations suffered in the pre-World War II Yugoslav state (1918‚Äì1941), ruled by the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty, due to earlier conflicts between Bulgaria and Serbia. The Kingdom of Bulgaria was one of the first countries to recognize the Independent State of Croatia. The Bulgarian embassy in Zagreb operated from 1941 to 1944. The Croatian Embassy in Sofia operated from 1941 to 1944. For the rest of the period prior to 1992, there had been no special crisis or event that required bilateral diplomacy from Croatians and Bulgarians as self-representing nations. However, as two South Slavic nations in relatively close proximity, both nations have been party to some form of diplomatic mission throughout the centuries, whether between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice (which controlled Croatia's coastal region for some centuries), or during the 20th century when Croatia had been part of Yugoslavia and various attempts were made from within Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to incorporate Bulgaria into the Pan-South Slavic nation.

This means PBC is unaccredited and as such cannot be guaranteed by either the United States Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation to provide quality education. However, PBC has taken positive steps to ensure strong academic standards by holding membership with the Academic Council for Educational Accountability as well as securing several articulation agreements with other accredited seminaries, colleges and universities. In Oregon, The Higher Education Coordinating Commission lists PBC in its Institutions and Programs Approved for Veterans Affairs.

Miss Ellis and her sister had bought the land from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company. As in all the Ellis foundations, at Sts Simon and Jude there is a monthly Mass 'For all who have ever worshipped in this church'. The church, designed by Clement Jackson, was opened in 1905 as the Tulse Hill Mission and Father (later Canon) Rory Fletcher, a former surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital, was appointed as the first Mission Priest. The site of the Church was a cattle pond fed by a stream, which still runs underneath the church. Almost immediately, this stream was the cause of structural weakness, which has continued to give subsidence problems over the years. In the entrance hall to the sacristy, you can see plans for additions to the church which were never built for this reason. By 1985, the whole property was suffering from subsidence, and daylight could be seen through many of the cracks in the walls of the church and house. An extensive and expensive programme of underpinning and repair to the whole structure had to be undertaken as a matter of urgency. At the same time, it was decided to start decorating the interior. The sanctuary was raised up one metre and a new altar of Ancaster stone backed by an oak dossal and damask hangings was installed. Cheshire sandstone was used for the Tabernacle pillar and the pulpit base. The great Cross and two hand-carved angels which came originally from Poland were gilded. A new Ahlborn electric organ was installed at the side of the sanctuary: it has an extra computer which reads and stores what the organist is playing, which means that it can play itself when the organist is not present, a great help when there are multiple Masses on one day. A programme to fill the windows with stained glass was undertaken by the artist Andrew Taylor of Devizes in a mediaeval style with the most recent addition of a central widow on the front of the Church with the image of the Divine Mercy. This is lit in the evening from inside the Church for the benefit of the local people. This window was designed and manufactured by Mrs Susan Ashworth of Blackheath, London. It was installed in 2004 to celebrate the Centenary of the building of the Church.

While the first column delved into the power play in the Sarkozy-Bruni romance, the second questioned the veracity of the Akbar-Jodha hyphenation, the third probed the possible political implications of the Nehru-Edwina romance, while the last one dwelt upon the bond between Hitler and Eva Braun, which still remains shrouded in mystery.

Biography Kenan was born on 26 July 1979. Her father is the late Amos Kenan and her mother is the scholar Nurith Gertz. She was attracted to music at a young age and learned to play the guitar. She graduated from the theater program at Thelma Yellin High School of the Arts, but preferred a musical career. At the age of eighteen she was considered a \\"discovery\\". She has cited the Beatles (particularly the song Blackbird), Leah Goldberg, The Pixies, Pina Bausch and Thelma Yellin as early influences. In 1997 she participated in a song festival called Next, organized by musician Eran Tzur, in which she recomposed and performed songs by poet Yona Wallach. She also performed in an evening commemorating Inbal Perlmutter, a young poets' event, and an evening of Leah Goldberg's poetry. She played with several Israeli musicians, including Tal Gordon, Dana Berger and Asi Levi. In 1999 she and Gordon became a duo and recorded an album titled I Didn't Want It to End: Tal Gordon Hosting Rona Kenan. Kenan co-composed four of the album's songs. The album tour went on until late 2000. In 2001 she started touring solo with a show which included two instrument players beside her. She sang and promoted four songs that came out as a single. She sang mostly in English. In 2002, she kept collecting material for her debut album and started working hard with Izhar Ashdot as producer. In 2003, she began appearing with her trio in Tel Aviv, along with multi-instrumentalist Adam Scheflan and drummer Omri Hanegbi. She released three songs from the album: \\"Transparent Love\\", \\"To Live Right\\" and \\"Flood\\". In 2004, she released her debut, Breathing Down to Zero. The album included eleven original tracks in both Hebrew and English, a cover version of a Yaakov Orland song, and an instrumental track titled \\"Thirst and Hunger\\". The album featured guest appearances by Maya Dunietz, Shlomi Shaban and Berry Sakharof. She said it was a challenge to write in her native language. After the album's release, she entered a state of deep depression. Her health deteriorated and she had to cancel shows. Taking Ashdot's advice, she moved back with her parents to recover. They decided not to share what she was going through with almost anyone. She wrote the music for several of Israeli films and television series, including \\"The Cemetery Club\\", a documentary film directed by Tali Shemesh. In 2006 she released the first single from her second album, the title song Through Foreign Eyes, and in early 2007 the second single from that album The Last Time, came out. The album came out in February. She wrote all ten songs on the album, including a duet with Gidi Gov, \\"Strange Dance of the Heart\\". In 2008 she and Yoni Rechter performed renditions of two poems by author David Grossman ‚Äì \\"End\\", for which Kenan wrote the music, and \\"At a Coffee Shop\\", which Rechter composed ‚Äì at an afternoon honoring Grossman's latest novel at Holon's Mediatech Center. She also performed in London on a boat on the Thames, re-enactment of a Maapilim boat circa 1946, during the British Mandate of Palestine. In 2009 she released her third album, Shirim Leyoel (\\"Songs for Yoel\\"), a concept album inspired by her father's life story. In 2013, she was part of the Asaf Avidan European tour, as guitarist and vocalist and as support band in France. In January 2014 three singles from an album named \\"Af Al Pil\\" were released, Kenan participating in two of them. In \\"Ha'Parpar Ve'Ha'Zahal\\" she sings a duet with Omer Klein; in \\"Ani Ve'Atsmi\\" she's a solo vocalist. The album was composed by Shahar Barbash and translated to Hebrew from Yiddish by Benny Mer. In 2005 she became a \\"chosen artist\\" of the Israel Cultural Excellence Foundation. She is openly gay and is considered an icon in the gay and lesbian community in Israel. In 2007 she was photographed for the Israeli fashion company Comme Il Faut.

Criticism Dec 2015 - Durban - Former transport minister S'bu Ndebele has appeared in a Durban court on charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. Ndebele had been named as the first accused in a corruption, fraud and money-laundering case. He is accused of accepting just over R10m for his direct benefit. Ndebele allegedly accepted the money in order to facilitate tenders worth more than R2bn.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sbu- ndebele-arrested-for-corruption-20151215 Recently he has been heavily criticised for offering 16 500 hectares of land to the Dubai-based company Ruwaad Holdings to build a massive theme park named 'Zulu World'. This will result in the forced eviction of around 10 000 families from the eMacambini clan. The affected community has vowed to resist the evictions and has accused Ndebele of \\"selling\\" them to \\"a new kind of colonialism.\\"http://www.abahlali.org/taxonomy/term/1021 On 4 December 2008, the eMacambini community blockaded the N2 and R102 freeways to protest S'bu Ndebele's non-reply to their memorandum handed over in a previous march. On 16 May 2009, shortly after accepting the position of Minister of Transport, Ndebele received a R1,1-million Mercedes Benz S500 from the Vukuzakhe group of 'emerging contractors', who had received contracts worth more than R400-million in the department. Opposition parties have claimed that the gift could be a conflict of interest and that the Mercedes should be returned. Ndebele explained that he received the gift unannounced, long after he had ceased being MEC for transport, and denies any conflict of interest.Minister of Transport statement, 18 May 2009. Toll Roads There is not enough money available to fix roads, so more toll gates will probably have to be built on national roads, Transport Minister Sbu Ndebele said in a report on Thursday. More than 4 100 km of roads - or 32 percent of the national road network - are in such a bad state that they only have a \\"structural life span\\" of five years left. It would cost more than R35-billion to fix these roads before 2014, Ndebele said in Parliament, according to Beeld newspaper. But his department has only R16,8-billion available to do this. Credit SAPA Departmental Corruption Allegations The North West government said on Wednesday it had been hit by a multimillion-rand scandal related to road projects that might have been improperly and fraudulently awarded. \\"I can confirm that a number of contracts issued by the department for several road projects in the province may have been improperly and fraudulently awarded,\\" said Transport MEC Mahlakeng Mahlakeng in a statement. He said it was estimated that more than R1.5 billion allocated for road capital projects over the next three years - the medium term expenditure framework - had already been committed. Within three months of the current financial year, 2009/10, the roads directorate had already spent its entire capital project budget, he said. Its budget allocation for the year was R525 million. He said the information had emerged from an audit by PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The government was committed to getting the money back. Further details would be released once the government had cleared the legal implications of doing so. Millions of rands' worth of contracts had been issued by the department \\"without following procedure as stipulated by the Public Finance Management Act (PMFA)\\".

The project was begun in 1996 by Mary Gordon, a social entrepreneur and educator. Method The program consists of 27 weekly classes with a Roots of Empathy instructor through the school year. The core of the program is a classroom visit from a neighbourhood baby and parent every three weeks, with nine visits in all. Babies are between two and four months old at the beginning of the program. The children sit around the parent, baby and instructor and observe the baby's development and growth but also how the parent and baby interact. The instructor asks the children to reflect on their own feelings and on their classmates' displays of feeling.  Research and evaluation  The Roots of Empathy program effectiveness has been evaluated multiple times by independent reviewers since 2000. Randomized control trials, qualitative and quantitative, and longitudinal have been done. The results consistently show a decrease in aggression (including bullying) and an increase in sharing/inclusive/helping behavior. Some studies show the decrease in aggression appears to last at least three years. The organization also collects surveys every year from the children, classroom teachers, instructors and parents to evaluate the programs. Growth The program is available in every province of Canada. In 2007, the program expanded internationally to New Zealand and the United States (Seattle, WA). It is now in 11 countries including England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Costa Rica and the Netherlands (fall 2018). The curriculum has been translated into French, German, Spanish and Dutch Funding Roots of Empathy is funded by government grants, foundation funding, corporate and individual donations.

(Note this does not apply in non-inertial frames, indeed between accelerating frames the speed of light cannot be constant. Although it can be applied in non-inertial frames if an observer is confined to making local measurements. Extract of page 193 There have been various alternative formulations of special relativity over the years. Some of these formulations are equivalent to the original formulation whereas others result in modifications. \\"Single postulate\\" approaches Equivalent to the original? Yes. According to some references, the theory of special relativity can be derived from a single postulate: the principle of relativity. This claim can be misleading because actually these formulations rely on various unsaid assumptions such as isotropy and homogeneity of space. The question here is not about the exact number of postulates. The phrase \\"single postulate\\" is just used in comparison with the original \\"two postulate\\" formulation. The real question here is whether universal lightspeed can be deduced rather than assumed. The Lorentz transformations, up to a nonnegative free parameter, can be derived without first postulating the universal lightspeed. Experiment rules out the validity of the Galilean transformations and this means the parameter in the Lorentz transformations is nonzero hence there is a finite maximum speed before anything has been said about light. Combining this with Maxwell's equations shows that light travels at this maximum speed. The numerical value of the parameter in these transformations is determined by experiment, just as the numerical values of the parameter pair c and the permittivity of free space are left to be determined by experiment even when using Einstein's original postulates. When the numerical values in both Einstein's and these other approaches have been found then these different approaches result in the same theory. So the end result of the interlocking trio of theory+Maxwell+experiment is the same either way. This is the sense in which universal lightspeed can be deduced rather than postulated. For some historical information, see: History of special relativity#Spacetime physics and the section \\"Lorentz transformation without second postulate\\" for the approaches of Ignatowski and Frank/Rothe. However, according to Pauli (1921), Resnick (1967), and Miller (1981), those models were insufficient. But the constancy of the speed of light is contained in Maxwell's equations. That section includes the phrase \\"Ignatowski was forced to recourse to electrodynamics to include the speed of light.\\". So, the trio of \\"principle of relativity+Maxwell+numerical values from experiment\\" gives special relativity and this should be compared with \\"principle of relativity+second postulate+Maxwell+numerical values from experiment\\". Since Einstein's 1905 paper is all about electrodynamics he is assuming Maxwell's equations, and the theory isn't practically applicable without numerical values. When compared like with like, from the point of view of asking what is knowable, the second postulate can be deduced. If you restrict your attention to just the standalone theory of relativity then yes you need the postulate. But given all the available knowledge we don't need to postulate it. In other words, different domains of knowledge are overlapping and thus taken together have more information than necessary. This can be summarized as follows: #Experimental results rule out the validity of the Galiliean transformations. #That just leaves the Lorentz transformations with a finite maximal speed V. #Given a maximal speed V, the only consistent way of combining PofR with Maxwell's equations is to identify Maxwell's parameter :c = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\mu_0 \\\\varepsilon_0}} \\\\ . with the aforementioned maximal speed V. #We are now at the same starting point as if we had postulated the constancy of light, so we proceed to develop all the usual results of special relativity. There are references which discuss in more detail the principle of relativity  Lorentz ether theory  Equivalent to the original ? Yes. Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincar√© developed their version of special relativity in a series of papers from about 1900 to 1905. They used Maxwell's equations and the principle of relativity to deduce a theory that is mathematically equivalent to the theory later developed by Einstein. Minkowski spacetime Equivalent to the original ? Yes. Minkowski space (or Minkowski spacetime) is a mathematical setting in which special relativity is conveniently formulated. Minkowski space is named for the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski, who around 1907 realized that the theory of special relativity (previously developed by Poincar√© and Einstein) could be elegantly described using a four-dimensional spacetime, which combines the dimension of time with the three dimensions of space. Mathematically there are a number of ways in which the four-dimensions of Minkowski spacetime are commonly represented: as a four-vector with 4 real coordinates, as a four-vector with 3 real and one complex coordinate, or using tensors. Test theories of special relativity Equivalent to the original ? No. Test theories of special relativity are flat space-time theories which differ from special relativity by having a different postulate about light concerning one-way speed of light vs two-way speed of light. Different postulates on light result in different notions of time simultaneity. There is Robertson's test theory (1949) which predicts different experimental results from Einstein's special relativity, and then there is Edward's theory (1963) which cannot be called a test theory because it is physically equivalent to special relativity, and then there is the Mansouri-Sexl theory (1977) which is equivalent to Robertson's theory. Curvilinear coordinates and non-inertial frames Equivalent to the original ? Curvilinear is a generalization, but the original SR can be applied locally. There can be misunderstandings over the sense in which SR can be applied to accelerating frames. :The confusion here results from trying to describe three different things with just two labels. The three things are: :* A description of physics without gravity using just \\"inertial frames\\", i.e. non-accelerating Cartesian coordinate systems. These coordinate systems are all related to each other by the linear Lorentz transformations. The physical laws may be described more simply in these frames than in the others. This is \\"special relativity\\" as usually understood. :* A description of physics without gravity using arbitrary curvilinear coordinates. This is non- gravitational physics plus general covariance. Here one sets the Riemann- Christoffel tensor to zero instead of using the Einstein field equations. This is the sense in which \\"special relativity\\" can handle accelerated frames. :* A description of physics including gravity governed by the Einstein field equations, i.e. full general relativity. Special relativity cannot be used to describe a global frame for non-inertial i.e. accelerating frames. However general relativity implies that special relativity can be applied locally where the observer is confined to making local measurements. For example, an analysis of Bremsstrahlung does not require general relativity, SR is sufficient. The key point is that you can use special relativity to describe all kinds of accelerated phenomena, and also to predict the measurements made by an accelerated observer who's confined to making measurements at one specific location only. If you try to build a complete frame for such an observer, one that is meant to cover all of spacetime, you'll run into difficulties (there'll be a horizon, for one). The problem is that you cannot derive from the postulates of special relativity that an acceleration will not have a non-trivial effect. E.g. in case of the twin paradox, we know that you can compute the correct answer of the age difference of the twins simply by integrating the formula for time dilation along the trajectory of the travelling twin. This means that one assumes that at any instant, the twin on its trajectory can be replaced by an inertial observer that is moving at the same velocity of the twin. This gives the correct answer, as long as we are computing effects that are local to the travelling twin. The fact that the acceleration that distinguishes the local inertial rest frame of the twin and the true frame of the twin does not have any additional effect follows from general relativity (it has, of course, been verified experimentally). In 1943, Moller obtained a transform between an inertial frame and a frame moving with constant acceleration, based on Einstein's vacuum eq and a certain postulated time-independent metric tensor, although this transform is of limited applicability as it does not reduce to the Lorentz transform when a=0. Throughout the 20th century efforts were made in order to generalize the Lorentz transformations to a set of transformations linking inertial frames to non-inertial frames with uniform acceleration. So far, these efforts failed to produce satisfactory results that are both consistent with 4-dimensional symmetry and to reduce in the limit a=0 to the Lorentz transformations. Hsu and Hsu claim that they have finally come up with suitable transformations for constant linear acceleration (uniform acceleration). They call these transformations: Generalized Moller-Wu-Lee Transformations. They also say: \\"But such a generalization turns out not to be unique from a theoretical viewpoint and there are infinitely many generalizations. So far, no established theoretical principle leads to a simple and unique generalization.\\" de Sitter relativity Equivalent to the original ? No. According to the works of Cacciatori, Gorini and Kamenshchik, and Bacry and L√©vi-Leblond and the references therein, if you take Minkowski's ideas to their logical conclusion then not only are boosts non-commutative but translations are also non-commutative. This means that the symmetry group of space time is a de Sitter group rather than the Poincar√© group. This results in spacetime being slightly curved even in the absence of matter or energy. This residual curvature is caused by a cosmological constant to be determined by observation. Due to the small magnitude of the constant, then special relativity with the Poincar√© group is more than accurate enough for all practical purposes, although near the Big Bang and inflation de Sitter relativity may be more useful due to the cosmological constant being larger back then. Note this is not the same thing as solving Einstein's field equations for general relativity to get a de Sitter Universe, rather the de Sitter relativity is about getting a de Sitter Group for special relativity which neglects gravity. Taiji relativity Equivalent to the original ? Yes. This section is based on the work of Jong-Ping Hsu and Leonardo Hsu. :Erratum They decided to use the word Taiji which is a Chinese word meaning the ultimate principles that existed before the creation of the world. In SI units, time is measured in seconds, but taiji time is measured in units of metres ‚Äî the same units used to measure space. Their arguments about choosing what units to measure time in, lead them to say that they can develop a theory of relativity which is experimentally indistinguishable from special relativity, but without using the second postulate in their derivation. Their claims have been disputed. The transformations that they derive involve the factor \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\beta^2}} where Œ≤ is the velocity measured in metres per metre (a dimensionless quantity). This looks the same as (but should NOT be conceptually confused with) the velocity as a fraction of light v/c that appears in some expressions for the Lorentz transformations. Expressing time in metres has previously been done by other authors: Taylor and Wheeler in Spacetime Physics and Moore in Six Ideas that Shaped Physics. The transformations are derived using just the principle of relativity and have a maximal speed of 1, which is quite unlike \\"single postulate\\" derivations of the Lorentz transformations in which you end up with a parameter that may be zero. So this is not the same as other \\"single postulate\\" derivations. However the relationship of taiji time \\"w\\" to standard time \\"t\\" must still be found, otherwise it would not be clear how an observer would measure taiji time. The taiji transformations are then combined with Maxwell's equations to show that the speed of light is independent of the observer and has the value 1 in taiji speed (i.e. it has the maximal speed). This can be thought of as saying: a time of 1 metre is the time it takes for light to travel 1 metre. Since we can measure the speed of light by experiment in m/s to get the value c, we can use this as a conversion factor. i.e. we have now found an operational definition of taiji time: w=ct. So we have: w metres = (c m/s) * t seconds :Let r = distance. Then taiji speed = r metres / w metres = r/w dimensionless. But it is not just due to the choice of units that there is a maximum speed. It is the principle of relativity, that Hsu & Hsu say, when applied to 4d spacetime, implies the invariance of the 4d-spacetime interval s^2=w^2-r^2 and this leads to the coordinate transformations involving the factor 1\\\\over\\\\sqrt{(1-\\\\beta^2)} where beta is the magnitude of the velocity between two inertial frames. The difference between this and the spacetime interval s^2=c^2t^2-r^2 in Minkowski space is that s^2=w^2-r^2 is invariant purely by the principle of relativity whereas s^2=c^2t^2-r^2 requires both postulates. The \\"principle of relativity\\" in spacetime is taken to mean invariance of laws under 4-dimensional transformations. Hsu & Hsu then explore other relationships between w and t such as w=bt where b is a function. They show that there are versions of relativity which are consistent with experiment but have a definition of time where the \\"speed\\" of light is not constant. They develop one such version called common relativity which is more convenient for performing calculations for \\"relativistic many body problems\\" than using special relativity. Euclidean relativity Equivalent to the original ? yes. Euclidean relativity uses a Euclidean (++++) metric as opposed to the traditional Minkowski (+---) or (-+++) metric which is derived from the Minkowski metric by rewriting (cd\\\\tau)^2=(cdt)^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2 into the equivalent (cdt)^2=dx^2+dy^2+dz^2+(cd\\\\tau)^2. The roles of time t and proper time \\\\tau have switched so that proper time \\\\tau takes the role of the coordinate for the 4th spatial dimension. A universal velocity c for all objects in 4D space-time appears from the regular time derivative c^2=(dx/dt)^2+(dy/dt)^2+(dz/dt)^2+(cd\\\\tau /dt)^2. The approach differs from the so-called Wick rotation or complex Euclidean relativity. In Wick rotation, time t is replaced by it, which also leads to a positive definite metric but it maintains proper time \\\\tau as the Lorentz invariant value whereas in Euclidean relativity \\\\tau becomes a coordinate. Because c^2=(dx/dt)^2+(dy/dt)^2+(dz/dt)^2+(cd\\\\tau /dt)^2 implies that photons travel at the speed of light in the subspace {x, y, z} and baryonic matter that is at rest in {x, y, z} travels normal to photons along {\\\\tau}, a paradox arises on how photons can be propagated in a space-time. The possible existence of parallel space-times or parallel worlds shifted and co-moving along \\\\tau is the approach of Giorgio Fontana. The Euclidean geometry is consistent with classical, Minkowski based relativity. The hyperbolic Minkowski geometry turns into a rotation in 4D circular geometry where length contraction and time dilation result from the geometric projection of 4D properties to 3D space. Very special relativity Equivalent to the original ? No Ignoring gravity, experimental bounds seem to suggest that special relativity with its Lorentz symmetry and Poincar√© symmetry describes spacetime. Surprisingly, Cohen and Glashow have demonstrated that a small subgroup of the Lorentz group is sufficient to explain all the current bounds. The minimal subgroup in question can be described as follows: The stabilizer of a null vector is the special Euclidean group SE(2), which contains T(2) as the subgroup of parabolic transformations. This T(2), when extended to include either parity or time reversal (i.e. subgroups of the orthochronous and time-reversal respectively), is sufficient to give us all the standard predictions. Their new symmetry is called Very Special Relativity (VSR). Doubly special relativity Equivalent to the original ? No. Doubly special relativity (DSR) is a modified theory of special relativity in which there is not only an observer-independent maximum velocity (the speed of light), but an observer-independent minimum length (the Planck length). The motivation to these proposals is mainly theoretical, based on the following observation: The Planck length is expected to play a fundamental role in a theory of Quantum Gravity, setting the scale at which Quantum Gravity effects cannot be neglected and new phenomena are observed. If Special Relativity is to hold up exactly to this scale, different observers would observe Quantum Gravity effects at different scales, due to the Lorentz‚ÄìFitzGerald contraction, in contradiction to the principle that all inertial observers should be able to describe phenomena by the same physical laws. A drawback of the usual doubly special relativity models is that they are valid only at the energy scales where ordinary special relativity is supposed to break down, giving rise to a patchwork relativity. On the other hand, de Sitter relativity is found to be invariant under a simultaneous re- scaling of mass, energy and momentum, and is consequently valid at all energy scales.

The DEA is produced by the Dickinson Editing Collective, with an executive editor, a general editor, two associate editors, a project manager, and a technical editor working collaboratively with one another and with numerous coeditors, staff, and users.  History  The Dickinson Electronic Archives was begun in 1994 by Emily Dickinson scholar and University of Maryland, College Park professor Martha Nell Smith. It was the first online digital repository of its kind and featured a limited number of Dickinson manuscripts and correspondences. In 2000, the DEA received its first major overhaul. This overhaul included the additions of more manuscripts and correspondences, as well as Titanic Operas ‚Äì a section highlighting the responses of contemporary poets to Emily Dickinson ‚Äì and a section of the DEA dedicated to helping teachers utilize digital resources in classroom instruction.  Current  Although originally created to showcase the writings of and scholarship concerning American poet Emily Dickinson, the Dickinson Electronic Archives projects have since expanded to include as well the writings of Emily Dickinson's correspondents, many of whom were family members such as Susan Dickinson and nephew Edward (Ned) Dickinson. The DEA has also grown to feature numerous images of Dickinson‚Äôs manuscripts ‚Äì both poetic manuscripts and letters ‚Äì as well as detailed scholastic analysis by executive editor Martha Nell Smith and other leading Dickinson scholars. One of the primary missions of the Dickinson Electronic Archives is to enhance knowledge surrounding Emily Dickinson, one of the United States' most admired and popular poets and beloved nineteenth-century figures, through the contextual clues of her creative process as discovered in her manuscripts. While casual biographies of Dickinson are likely to describe the poet as isolated, morbid, crazy, humorless, and a writer of \\"little poems,\\" her written records suggest otherwise. Dickinson‚Äôs manuscripts and correspondences, as showcased in the Dickinson Electronic Archives, show that Emily Dickinson sometimes collaborated with another writer, that she sometimes reveled in a bawdy sense of humor, and that letter writing became an artistic form for her, one she exploited for poetic experimentation.  Citations and References  As a leader in Digital humanities and one of the first digital literature projects, the Dickinson Electronic Archives have been at the center of critical discussion for over ten years, appearing at the center of critical discussion in hundreds of scholarly articles, journals, and books.

The tome was one of the first agricultural textbooks, with a preface in rhyme by the author Samuel Purchas.Also attached to the volume is Gervase Markham, who authored the introduction. A poet and writer of somewhat mysterious background, Gervase Markham was buried at St Giles's, Cripplegate, London, on 3 February 1637. Markham and Samuel Purchas were known to each other, so it's not surprising that they would have collaborated with Levett on his discourse. It is among the earliest examples of what later became a flood of literature treating the English love of gardening and horticulture.Gleanings in Old Garden Literature, William Carew Hazlitt, Elliot Stock, London, 1897 John's Levett's identity is unclear. The author of The Ordering of Bees: Or, The True History of Managing Them is thought to have been a clergyman, and possibly the nephew of English explorer Capt. Christopher Levett, Christopher Levett, of York, The Pioneer colonist in Casco Bay, James Phinney Baxter, The Gorges Society, Portland, 1893 one of the earliest explorers of New England.Some beekeeping authorities believe that Levett wrote the book about 1600, although it wasn't actually published until 1634. Whoever Levett was, he clearly had an advanced education. His book is dedicated to a member of the Suffolk gentry, and perhaps Levett was serving there.The fact that Levett is identified in the original of his book as 'Gent.,\\" without any courtesy title such as \\"Rev.,\\" may indicate that Levett was not a clergyman after all. He may be the John Levett who matriculated at age 18 at Magdalen Hall (today's Magdalen College, Oxford) in June 1590. This John Levett's name was sometimes spelled Leavett. He is identified in Oxford's records as \\"John Levett of Sussex, Gent.\\" His book was considered groundbreaking because it combined close observation of bees with field experience in managing beehives. Levett explored the debate over bee gender, and over their means of reproducing.Quidditas, The Journal of the Rocky Mountain Medieval and Renaissance Association, Vol. 20, 1999 Levett's work quickly became the favoured book on the subject.There was controversy in Levett's day, apparently, over the role of the female bees within the hive. Some insisted that the workerbees were male, others that they were female. Much of the debate, apparently, turned on the role of patriarchal societies. Obviously the matter took on a whole new dimension with the ascension to the throne of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Robert Child, the foremost agriculture writer of his day, said of Levett: \\"Hee is the best that ever write of this subject.\\"English Farming, Chapter v: From James I to the Restoration (1603‚Äì1660), Farming under the First Stuarts and the Commonwealth, soilandhealth.org At least part of Levett's appeal, aside from his careful study of his subjects, was his somewhat sly sense of humour. The drones, Levett warned, were \\"necessary and helpfull [sic] to the Bees, so long as they exceed not a due proportion (much like to Our lawyers), but let their number grow to(o) great (as it often doth) and they will indeed devoure the substance of the Bees (as the Lawyers of the Commonwealth) and bring it to destruction.\\"Bee, Clare Preston, Reaktion Books, 2006 In his discourse on bees, Levett drew many parallels to human society. The Master Bee, Levett wrote, had regal authority, \\"correcting the lazie, sloathfull, and disobedient, and giving honour and incouragement to those which are painfull, laborious and diligent.\\" The Master Bees, Levett wrote, \\"are absolute in their authorities and commands,\\" and were essential, Levett believed, in the organising the hierarchy of and ensuring the ultimate success of the hive. The preface to Levett's book was written by \\"S. Purcas\\" in rhyme, who was undoubtedly English author and travel writer Samuel Purchas.John Levett's association with the well-known author Samuel Purchas led Maine historian James Phinney Baxter to conclude that the author Levett was the nephew of the English explorer Capt. Christopher Levett, originally of York. This meant that the author Levett was the son of Percival Levett Jr., a merchant of Beverley and York. \\"Thy selfe, thy self enough, enough thy Booke, Thy book commands, and I, my Levett, leave it, Here in small Bees, God's greatnesse first I looke, And thee thy selfe though dead to live yet.\\" Christopher Levett of York, James Phinney Baxter, The Gorges Society, Portland, 1893 Nor were the results of apian labours limited to simple honey. Bee products, Levett told his readers, could be used in domestic hygiene, physick and surgery. Levett was not troubled by the thought that the bee was placed on earth to serve man. In the sort of thinking that stamped the age of exploration and colonisation, Levett consigned the bee to his role as supporting player. \\"Hath not God given all creatures unto us for our benefit, and to be used accordingly as may seem good unto us for our good?,\\" Levett wrote. \\"We see that many creatures of greater account are daily killed in infinite numbers for our sustenance and often for our pleasure, and is it not lawful for us, to use these silly creatures in such sort as they may be most for our benefit, which I take to be the right use of them and the very end of their creation?\\"The Hive: the Story of the Honeybee and Us, Bee Wilson, Macmillan, New York, 2007 In Levett's worldview, nature was there to serve her master. It fell to man the task of \\"orderinge\\" the bees. Rather than simply observing, the beekeeper's job was to take the honey and kill the bees afterwards so the colony didn't raid honey from other unharvested colonies nearby. Levett dismissed the concerns of those who said it was \\"a pity to kill the bees that have so laboured for us,\\" calling such talk \\"a foolish and fond conceit.\\" Eventually, advances in the study of bees and in agricultural theory would change the conception of the role of the beekeeper, who would eventually come to be seen as a manager of resources, rather than one set out to tame wild nature and bend it to man's purposes. The beekeeper would be turned into part of 'husbandry,' and a mainstay of the rural economy. But in Levett's worldview, what one scholar calls his \\"aggressively patriarchal\\" style, the bees should be driven and made to perform.The Hive: the Story of the Honeybee and Us, Bee Wilson, Macmillan, New York, 2007 \\"Bees might be superior to all other insects,\\" writes Bee Wilson, \\"but they were still of a different estate from men.\\" English beekeeping remained largely unchanged for centuries, until the late nineteenth century when moveable-frame hives were invented.The History of Beekeeping in English Gardens, Penelope Walker, Eva Crane, Garden History, Vol. 28, No. 2, The Garden History Society, pp. 231‚Äì261, JSTOR By that time, the new hives and improved artificial wax foundations, new smokers, even new breeds of bees meant that the beekeepers of John Levett's day became the more dignified 'apiarists'.The Hive, Bee Wilson, Macmillan, New York, 2007 In today's world of collapsing bee populations, the Levett model of 'bee domination,' a mirror of its epoch of exploration and colonisation, seems particularly dated.Beekeepers protest over hive deaths, The Independent, Nov. 5, 2008 References Further reading * The ordering of bees: or, The true history of managing them from time to time, with their hony and waxe, shewing their nature and breed.

The battle ended with the capture of the British post ship Ariel by Amazone. On 11 September 1779, whilst the Ariel was cruising off Charles Town under Captain Thomas Mackenzie, she sighted a strange sail and approached to investigate, unaware that a French fleet under the Admiral comte d'Estaing had entered the theatre from the West Indies. As Mackenzie got closer he realized that the stranger was actually a frigate, accompanied by two brigs and a schooner, and that she was not responding to his signals, he had to retreat for the Georgia shore. The frigate gradually overhauled Ariel and Mackenzie was forced to stand and fight. The enemy vessel was the 36-gun French Amazone. After a ninety-minute flight in which lost her mizzen-mast and all her rigging and sustained casualties of four men dead and another 20 wounded, Mackenzie surrendered Ariel.Hepper (1994), p.56. d'Estaing immediately exchanged the crew of Ariel and , which he had captured the year before, for French prisoners.

The film stars Morgan Sterne, Viveca Lindfors and Rita Gam. Plot The Valet (Manuel Ros√≥n) enters a hotel room with Joseph Garcin (Morgan Sterne) in tow. The windowless room has a single entrance and no mirrors. Two women, In√®s Serrano (Viveca Lindfors) and Estelle Rigault (Rita Gam), are then led in; afterwards, the Valet leaves and locks the door. Realizing that they are in hell, the trio expects to be tortured; however, no torturer is forthcoming. While waiting, they strike up a conversation and discuss each other's sins, desires, and unpleasant memories; they slowly realize that such probing is the form of torture they are meant to receive. It later becomes apparent that Joseph, once a journalist, was executed for cowardice and the betrayal of the French Resistance. Estelle, who has a voracious sexual appetite, was a gold digger and seductress who killed a man. Meanwhile, the lesbian In√®s abused her partner's love for her and eventually killed them both in a murder-suicide. As the story progresses, Garcin becomes increasingly annoyed by In√®s' considering him a coward, while Estelle makes unreciprocated advances on him; In√®s is tempted by Estelle, but crazed by Estelle's heterosexuality. The three at first continue to see events happening on Earth, but eventually, as the living move on, they are left with only their own thoughts and the company of the other two. Towards the end of the film, Garcin demands he be let out; in response, the door opens. However, none leave. They resign themselves to their fate. Production Sartre did not know about the film while it was in production. Viveca Lindfors, at the time married to screenwriter George Tabori, was chosen to play In√®s. Style The film uses dialogue-free flashbacks when the main characters talk about their lives. Alison Darren in the Lesbian Film Guide notes that In√®s is a \\"typical screen lesbian\\" of the early 1960s, both physically attractive and inherently evil. Release and reception After being screened at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival in June 1962, where Rita Gam and Viveca Lindfors shared the Silver Bear for Best Actress award, No Exit received its American release on December 5. Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, found the film \\"antiseptic\\", with emotionless acting and stagy directing; he summarized that the film \\"prove[d] that \\"No Exit\\" is inappropriate material for a full-length [film]\\". Allison Darren calls the film an \\"excellent psychological drama\\" with a \\"surprisingly overt\\" depiction of lesbianism.

The U-10 class as a whole did not have much wartime success, with three of the boats sinking either one or no ships. Only one boat, sank more than of enemy ships.

See: Gardiner, pp. 340‚Äì41. The Navy did have five s under construction in Germany, but a perceived inability to sail the completed submarines past Gibraltar to the naval base at Pola led to a hasty decision to sell them to Germany,In April 1915, some five months after the sale of the U-7 boats, the German U-boat successfully sailed into the Mediterranean via Gibraltar, proving that delivery of the U-7 boats to Austria-Hungary would have been possible.

UB-1 and UB-15 were initially commissioned into the Kaiserliche Marine in January and April, respectively, each with German commanders and crew, but with an Austro-Hungarian Navy officer for piloting and training purposes, but both were commissioned into the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine with Austro-Hungarian crews by July. The other three ships were never manned by German crews and had all been commissioned by early October when each is listed in sources with a commanding officer.  Armament  The U-10-class boats were equipped with two torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. The German Type UB I submarines were additionally equipped with a machine gun, but it is not clear from sources if U-10 and U-11, the former German boats, were either equipped with them or, if so, retained them in Austro-Hungarian service. In October 1916, all the boats except U-11 received 37 mm/23 (1.5 in) quick-firing (QF) guns. U-11 received a /18 gun originally planned for U-14 (which received a larger gun instead). In November 1917, the 37 mm guns were replaced by /33 QF guns.  War activities  All five boats of the U-10 class took part in the war, but, as a class, had limited success. Although UB-1 and UB-15 had each had sunk a single ship while commissioned in the German Imperial Navy during 1915, neither boat sank any ships in Austro-Hungarian service. U-17 torpedoed a single ship, the , which sank on 10 July 1916. U-16 sank two small sailing ships in late 1915 and torpedoed and sank the on 16 October 1916. U-15 was the most successful of the class, sinking six ships for a total of . On a single day, 25 June 1916, U-15 sank the Italian auxiliary cruiser and the in the Strait of Otranto, accounting for almost half of her wartime successes. Of the five boats, only U-16 was sunk during the war, shortly after sinking Nembo. The only other casualty among the class involved U-10, which hit a mine near Caorle and was beached with heavy damage. Although she was looted by Austro- Hungarian Army troops, she was later towed to Trieste for repairs which remained incomplete at the war's end. After the end of fighting in November 1918, the four surviving class members‚ÄîU-10, U-11, U-15, and U-17‚Äîwere all turned over to Italy as war reparations and scrapped at Pola by 1920.

She was laid down on 1 November 1914 in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 22 January 1915. Commissioned one week later as SM UB-1, she sank one Italian torpedo boat in her German service. In July, she was handed over to the Austro-Hungarian Navy and commissioned as SM U-10. She was the target of an unsuccessful torpedo attack by a British submarine in May 1917. In July 1918, U-10 hit a mine and was beached with heavy damage. She was towed to Trieste for repairs which remained unfinished at the war's end. She was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920. = SM U-11 = SM U-11 was also originally a part of the German Imperial Navy, under the name UB-15. She was laid down on 9 November 1914 in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled, launched, and commissioned as SM UB-15 on 11 April 1915. In her only wartime success, she sank an Italian submarine in German service in early June. Shortly thereafter, she was delivered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy and commissioned as SM U-11 on 14 June. In early 1916, U-11 made a torpedo attack on a British submarine but missed.

He became a soldier at the age of 16 and served with distinction in the French army before transferring to the army of Spain, which was allied with France for much of the 18th century. A member of a distinguished military family, he was widely admired for his personal courage, courtesy and chivalry. By the end of his life he had risen to the highest military rank in Spain and it was said that he had served in 68 engagements.Wilkes, p. 360 He participated in many of the major conflicts of the 18th century, including the War of the Polish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War and the Anglo-Spanish War. His most famous achievement was the successful invasion of Minorca in 1781, in which he defeated a British garrison and returned the island to Spain, although his efforts the following year to recapture Gibraltar from the British were a notable failure. He ended his career in the service of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy, which had been allied with France prior to the French Revolution, and died in Madrid. Early life and career Born in Avignon on 22 February 1717, Crillon was a member of a distinguished family that had originated in Chieri, Piedmont. His branch of the family had a long history of military service to the French crown. A descendant of the famous 16th-century general Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon (\\"the brave Crillon\\"), he was the son of the 1st Duke of Crillon, Fran√ßois F√©lix de Berton des Balbes, and Marie-Th√©r√®se de Fabry de Moncault. Louis was the first-born of the couple's six children (four boys and two girls).Saint-Allais, p. 258 Crillon joined the R√©giment du Roi (King's Regiment) in 1734, aged 16, as a lieutenant en second and participated in France's Italian campaign during the War of the Polish Succession. He was soon promoted to lieutenant en premier and took part in a number of notable actions, including the Battle of San Pietro, under the command of the Marshal de Villars.Courcelles, p. 291 He remained with the regiment until 1738 when he was promoted to the rank of colonel in the R√©giment de Bretagne (Regiment of Brittany).Courcelles, p. 292 Service in the War of the Austrian Succession In 1742, he served with distinction in Bavaria under the command of Fran√ßois d'Harcourt, duc d'Harcourt during the War of the Austrian Succession. Crillon won particular renown for his tenacious defence of Landau an der Isar against a 10,000‚Äìstrong attacking force led by the Grand Duke of Tuscany. When he was asked to surrender, Crillon told the enemy general that he could not as he had a name and a personal reputation to defend. The general is said to have replied, \\"Sir, we know and believe [this] since the beginning of the campaign; but give up, brave Crillon, you will be taken.\\" He was captured after a thirteen-hour battle but was released eight days later in a prisoner exchange. Crillon served again under d'Harcourt in 1744 when the latter commanded the Army of the Moselle during its campaigns along the Rhine. He participated in the siege of Fribourg and spent the winter in Swabia under the command of Marshal Coigny as colonel of an infantry regiment. In May 1745, he fought in the major Battle of Fontenoy near Tournai in modern-day Belgium and captured nearly 50 pieces of artillery from the Dutch, British, and Hanoverian alliance opposing the French. The following month he was appointed brigadier. On 10 July, he fought in what the French termed the battle of the M√©sle at Dendermonde near Ghent, leading 8,000 men to victory against a British, Austrian and Dutch force. He then took part in the captures of Ghent, Ostend and Nieuwpoort.Courcelles, p. 293 In 1746 Crillon transferred to the command of the duc de Boufflers to serve in the headquarters of the Army of Flanders during the Siege of Mons and rejoined the royal army following the city's capture. He brought the king news of the capture of the town and castle of Namur in October of that year, and was appointed to the rank of mar√©chal de camp, the junior of the two officer general ranks of the French Army. He took part in the 1747 campaign against the Republic of Genoa, serving in the Army of Italy under the Marshal de Belle-Isle, and was present during the captures of Nice, Villefranche, Montalb√°n and Ventimiglia. Service in the Seven Years' War Schloss Spangenberg, captured by Crillon on 9 November 1758 Almost a decade of peace ended with the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in Europe. Crillon resumed active service with the Army of Germany (Reichsarmee) in 1757, when he first served in a separate corps commanded by the Prince of Soubise on the frontiers of Saxony and then joined the French Grand Army. He defended the city of Wei√üenfels in October 1757, commanding four imperial battalions and 17 companies of French grenadiers. He executed a retreat, but on 5 November he was injured when he had his horse shot out from under him at the Battle of Rossbach.Showalter, pp. 188-190. Transferred to the command of the Marshal de Richelieu, he served for a while in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. He fought at Lutzenburg in October 1758, where he took 400 prisoners, and moved on to take the strategic castle of Spangenberg. Although it was heavily fortified, he took the garrison by surprise on 9 November. Finding that the drawbridge was down, his troops took the garrison prisoner and seized their armoury, including 18 cannon, 307 guns and 44 barrels of powder.Courcelles, p. 294 He returned to Flanders in May 1759 and was appointed to command French forces in Picardy in 1760.Courcelles, p. 295 Service with Spain A 1782 Spanish print commemorating Crillon's victory on Minorca In 1762 Crillon moved to Spain, where he served as a lieutenant-general ‚Äì the highest rank in the Bourbon armies ‚Äì and was made a Knight of the Order of Charles III in 1780. During the Anglo-Spanish War, when Spain and France allied with the Americans to fight Britain, he was given command of a Spanish army tasked with capturing Minorca from the British. The army landed on the island on 19 August 1781 and laid siege to the British garrison in Fort St. Philip at Mahon. The siege was concluded successfully on 5 February 1782 when the British surrendered, for which Crillon was made a grandee of Spain and took the title of Duke of Crillon-Mahon. He was subsequently put in charge of the joint French and Spanish force that had been besieging Gibraltar since 1779. Despite his efforts, Gibraltar proved impregnable and peace was restored in 1783. Crillon's service with Spain was further rewarded in 1783 with the title of Knight of the Golden Fleece. He was appointed captain-general of the kingdoms of Valencia and Murcia. He remained in Spain during the years of the French Revolutionary Wars, writing his memoirs (Memoires militaires de Louis de Berton des Balbes de Quiers), published in 1791.Gorton, p. 572) He took no part in the War of the Pyrenees (1793‚Äì95) between Spain and revolutionary France, but played a significant role in agreeing the peace that terminated the conflict. He died in Madrid in June 1796.Dictionnaire biographique et historique, p. 361 Reputation and family life The courtesy and chivalry of Crillon attracted much admiration during his lifetime and afterwards. As the English anecdotist William Seward put it in 1798, \\"Courtesy, no less than courage, was always the appenage of the family of Crillon\\". During the siege of Gibraltar, he sent his English opponent General George Eliott a gift of fruits, vegetables and game, along with some ice, which he presumed \\"will not be disagreeable in the excessive heat of this climate at this season of the year.\\" He expressed his \\"pleasure to which I look forward of becoming your friend, after I shall have learned to render myself worthy of the honour, by facing you as an enemy.\\"Drinkwater, p. 257 Five years later, when his old adversary Eliott was promoted to the peerage and became Lord Heathfield, Crillon wrote to his \\"dear and respectable enemy\\", whom he now considered a friend, to offer his congratulations.Seward, p. 207 Crillon married three times and had four children. His first wife, whom he married on 1 February 1742, was Fran√ßoise-Marie-Elizabeth Couvay, with whom he had two children: Louis-Alexandre-Nolasque-F√©lix de Balbe Berton, who became the 3rd Duke of Crillon on his father's death and had a distinguished military career in his own right; and Fran√ßois-F√©lix Doroth√©e. His second wife, whom he married on 2 August 1764, was Florence-Radagonde-Louise-El√©onore-Julie Bruneau de la Rabateli√®re, who died without issue. His third wife, Josephe-Anathase-Roman- Garmon Spinosa de Los Monteros, bore him two more children: Louis-Antoine- Fran√ßois de Paule, who became the 2nd Duke of Mahon, and Marie-Th√©r√®se- Virginie-Fran√ßoise de Paul.Saint-Allais, pp. 262‚Äì63 References Bibliography   * * Category:1717 births Category:1796 deaths Category:French military personnel of the Seven Years' War Category:People from Avignon Category:Spanish captain generals Category:French military personnel of the War of the Austrian Succession Category:Spanish military personnel of the American Revolutionary War Category:Dukes of Crillon Category:French military personnel of the War of the Polish Succession Category:Dukes of Mahon Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Spain ","title":"Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, 1st Duke of Mah√≥n"},{"id":"20070208","text":"Bolton's stained glass windows Holy Trinity Church Miriam and Jubal by William Jay Bolton William Jay Bolton (31 August 1816 ‚Äì 28 May 1884) was the first artist in the United States to design and manufacture figural stained glass windows.Clark, p. 40 Bolton was now prepared to undertake a larger project, an impressive array of figural windows which stand today as the first such complex to be made in America, and the first large group to be installed in an American church. Plans for the Church of the Holy Trinity, located on a rise at the northwest corner of Clinton and Montague Streets in Brooklyn Heights, probably commenced in 1843. The cornerstone was laid in August, 1844, and the church opened for services on 25 April 1847. Biography Bolton was born in Bath, Somerset, England and was the second son of a wealthy merchant, Robert Bolton, of Savannah, Georgia, who later became an ordained minister and the founder of Christ Church in Pelham, New York. Robert Bolton married Anne Jay in 1810. She was the daughter of the Evangelical minister William Jay. When Bolton was growing up he often went with his grandfather on summer trips through the countryside making pencil drawings of the stained glass windows of the churches they visited. Bolton probably learned his early appreciation of art due to the guidance by his grandfather, William Jay. Jay was a mason's apprentice during the construction of Fonthill Abbey. He often went with his aunt Arabella Jay to King's College Chapel in Cambridge. Here he saw early sixteenth-century stained glass windows of the church.Clark, p. 34 Bolton attended an Evangelical school in Mill Hill near London until he was 16. He then attended Cambridge University.Marquis Who's Who, 1967 He also briefly joined an engineering firm in Bath where he began painting in earnest. He first painted portraits of his family and friends. Bolton's parents and grandparents knew many famous artists including William Etty. Etty made two chalk drawings of baby Bolton. He also painted other Bolton family portraits. In 1836 the family moved to Westchester County, New York, first to the present Village of Bronxville and then to the town of Pelham. In Pelham Washington Irving, a neighbour and family friend, introduced Bolton to Samuel F. B. Morse. Around 1839 Bolton became a student of Morse at the National Academy of Design. In 1840 Bolton received first prize for his drawing of the Venus de' Medici from the Academy.Clark, p. 35 In 1841 Bolton went to Europe where he saw masterpieces of art, mostly in Italy. Here he did many drawings and sketches of these and bought art for the family home. In 1842 Bolton returned to Pelham where he earnestly began his work in stained glass. Here he had a small shop at the rear of a house near the \\"Pelham Priory,\\" the Gothic Revival family home in Pelham. The equipment he had to work with was sparse. He had a muffle kiln, which was used for firing his work after he painted details on the coloured glass. Bolton's younger brother John (1818‚Äì1898) assisted him in making and designing stained glass. Bolton's first attempts at stained glass were windows for \\"The Priory\\", the family home. His first major window, a large Adoration of the Magi, was for the family church where his father was rector, Christ Church at Pelham. It was completed by the time of its consecration on 15 September 1843 and represents the first figural stained glass window made in the United States. It is similar in design to a subject in a sixteenth-century window at St. Martin's Church in Liege, Belgium, which Bolton most likely had seen in his travels some two years earlier. This work lead up to his finest work, at the Holy Trinity Church in Brooklyn, New York.Clark, p. 36 Bolton went to England around 1845 and opened a glass staining studio in Cambridge. After the death of his first wife, he ceased his stained glass work and became an ordained minister in an Anglican church around 1853. He was vicar of Stratford East church in London from 1866 to 1881. He was also associated with St. James Church in Bath from 1881 to 1884. He died in Bath in 1884.

The club was based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and was a member of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, the first league to openly hire hockey players, from 1900‚Äì1904 and 1907-1909\\\\. The team played all of its games at the Duquesne Gardens, and was involved, in the first known trade of professional hockey players. History =Origins= 1908 Pittsburgh Bankers, WPHL ChampionsThe Bankers consisted of a group of local men from Pittsburgh that were employed by local banks during the early 1900s (decade). The team actually began as the amateur Pittsburgh Bankers League, a local amateur hockey league. According to Stan Fischler, a renowned author and commentator on hockey, \\"In the early 1900s a local league also sprung up, called the Bankers League. Some of the banks started a hockey league as a promotional stunt and brought Canadians down and gave them jobs in the banks. They were down here to play hockey but in order to qualify and play for the bank they had to be an employee of the bank. I don't know what they gave them to do at the bank, but it wasn't much.\\" This led to the Bankers laying partial claim to being one of the first teams to pay athletes. The league later merged into one team which became members of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, in 1900. =First title: 1902= In 1902, the Bankers signed Hod Stuart to a professional contract; this was disputed between the Bankers and the Pittsburgh Victorias, who also claimed him. Eventually the Bankers won the dispute and kept Stuart, who was considered, in certain hockey circles, to be the ‚Äúgreatest hockey player in the world.\\" Hod was offered a salary of US$15‚Äì20 per week, plus steady income from a day job in Pittsburgh. Stuart scored seven goals and had eight assists and was named the best cover-point in the league in 1903. The Bankers claimed their first WPHL title that season and faced off against the Portage Lakes Hockey Club, located in Houghton, Michigan for the title of top professional team in the United States. The winner of that series is unclear since Portage Lakes would win two of the four games and tie a third and the Bankers claimed the edge in total goals, 11-6. Another of the era's stars, Charlie Liffiton, joined the Bankers in 1902 to help the club win its first title. Over his two seasons with the club, Liffiton reportedly scored three goals in four playoff matches. =Consolidated into the IPHL= The following season, the Bankers saw their star player, Hod Stuart, leave the team to join the Portage Lakes Hockey Club. In fact as Portage Lakes continued to play professional exhibition games, the team raided all of the WPHL teams for their key players. The Bankers', Charlie Liffiton, was offered 1350 to play for the Portage Lakes club for the remainder of the season, making him the era's highest paid player. The WPHL and the Bankers disappeared for the following season so that the WPHL could consolidate into the Pittsburgh Professionals and begin playing in the International Professional Hockey League. The idea for the new league was the idea of James R. Dee, a Houghton businessman, who came up with the idea after watching the Bankers and Portage Lakes play in 1904. Several Bankers' players, such as Lorne Campbell and Hod Stuart played for the Pittsburgh Professionals. Meanwhile, other Bankers players, like Charlie Liffiton, played for Portage Lakes. =Revived and quick demise= The WPHL, along with the Pittsburgh Bankers was revived in for the 1907-08 season, once the IPHL folded. On January 28, 1908, the Bankers might have been the first team to trade professional hockey players. According to the deal, the Pittsburgh Pirates sent Jim MacKay, Edgar Dey and Dunc Taylor to the Bankers for Joseph Donnelly, Clint Bennest and a player named \\"McGuire\\".\\"Hockey games for this week\\" The Pittsburgh Press, February 2, 1908. The Bankers would go on to win their second league title in 1907-08. The Bankers then played a \\"World's Series\\" with the Montreal Wanderers. The Wanderers won the series two games to one. The following season saw future Stanley Cup winner Skene Ronan made his professional hockey debut with the Bankers, however Ronan would later break his contract to leave the team and play with the Toronto Professionals. Meanwhile, future Hall of Famer, Alf Smith returned to the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League and played for the Bankers and the Pittsburgh Duquesne before he was suspended from the two teams for rough play. However the defection of star Bankers players such as Ronan, Tommy Smith, Harry Smith and Edgar Dey were now common in the WPHL. The newly revived league, could no longer rely on salaries as novelty to attract Canadian talent, since professionalism had spread into Canada. Many players signed up, particular since the WPHL played on the Duquesne Gardens' artificial ice and was not dependent on cold weather to provide a naturally frozen surface, however as winter began and Canadian rinks became available, the players would just flock north to teams closer to home. This jumping affected all of the league's teams. Once the Pittsburgh Lyceum team folded on December 23, it was decided to discontinue the WPHL after the season.

He served as a Union general during the American Civil War. During the war he was made a brigadier general and after the war was appointed a brevet major general. After the war he was heavily involved in developing farms in the U.S. state of Colorado. Early life and career Cameron was born in Brooklyn, New York. He moved with his parents to Valparaiso, Indiana in the early 1842, where he attended the local public schools.Warner, p. 64. Cameron graduated from Indiana Medical College in 1849,Hubbell, Geary & Wakelyn (1995), p. 80 and also attended Rush Medical College in Chicago, however he soon gave up his medical studies. In 1857, Cameron bought and began publishing the Valparaiso Republican, a local newspaper.Warner, p. 64. \\"Cameron seemingly lost his desire to be a doctor and in 1857 purchased the Valparaiso Republican, which he published for some years...\\" He also served as a Republican delegate to their 1860 convention in Chicago, supporting the campaign of Abraham Lincoln for U.S. President. Civil War service Robert Alexander Cameron When the American Civil War began, Cameron was a doctor in practice at Valparaiso and a member of the Indiana House of Representatives. He enlisted in the 9th Indiana, a three- month regiment, and was elected captain on April 23, 1861. With the 9th, Cameron saw service in the Western Virginia Campaigns.Warner, pp. 64-5. After those three months were up, Cameron re-enlisted for the duration of hostilities and was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 19th Indiana Infantry on July 29.Eicher(2), p. 159. In September 1861, Cameron and the 19th Indiana fought in a skirmish at Chain Bridge, one of the bridges over the Potomac River leading into Washington, D.C. After the action Col. Solomon Meredith, Cameron's brigade commander, thought highly of his performance, stating that he \\"rode the lines giving orders and maintaining a calmness that was not even shattered when the concussion of a shell brought his horse to its knees.\\" Despite this praise, Cameron was not able to get along with Meredith, and asked Indiana governor Oliver Morton to be removed from the 19th and assigned elsewhere. His request would be granted early in the following year. On February 3, 1862, Cameron was transferred to the 34th Indiana, and Cameron and the 34th fought in Missouri at the action near New Madrid and the following Battle of Island Number Ten that February to April. He also participated in the capture of Memphis, Tennessee, on June 6.Warner, p. 65. Cameron was then promoted to colonel and given command of the 34th, both on June 15. With his regiment Cameron participated in the 1863 Vicksburg Campaign, where he was slightly wounded in his eyes during the Battle of Port Gibson on May 1. Cameron was promoted to brigadier general in the Union Army on August 11, 1863. After several stints of brigade command in late 1863 and 1864,Eicher(2), p. 159. 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, XIII Corps on: October 8 - December 6, 1863, February 5 - March 3, 1864, & May 24 - June 11, 1864. he led a division of the XIII Corps during the 1864 Red River Campaign. During the Battle of Mansfield in Louisiana on April 8, Cameron's men attempted to reinforce the crumbling Union line around 5 p.m., but were forced back when it finally broke near 6 p.m.Eicher(1), p. 644.John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1963) , pp. 342-345 Cameron finished the war in district command in the Department of the Gulf at Thibodaux, Louisiana. On March 13, 1865, he was appointed a brevet major general in the Union Army, and he resigned his commission soon after on June 22. Cameron then moved to San Francisco, California, where he stayed there for few years before returning to Colorado to serve as a postal clerk in Denver. From 1885-87, he served as warden of Colorado State Penitentiary. In the spring of 1894 Cameron died on his farm near Ca√±on City, Colorado, and is buried there.

This was one of the founding pieces of legislation in UK labour law, though it has today been superseded by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Background The Conservative Prime Minister, the Earl of Derby, set up a Royal Commission on Trade Unions in 1867. One worker representative was on the commission, Frederic Harrison, who prepared union witnesses. Robert Applegarth from the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners was a union observer of the proceedings. The majority report of the Commission was hostile to the idea of decriminalising trade unions. Frederic Harrison, Thomas Hughes and the Earl of Lichfield produced their own minority report, recommending the following changes in the law: * Combinations of workers should not be liable for conspiracy unless it would be criminal if committed by a single person. * The restraint of trade doctrine in common law should not apply to trade associations. * All existing legislation applying to unions specifically should be repealed. * All unions should receive full legal protection of their funds. When William Ewart Gladstone's new government came to power, the Trade Union Congress campaigned for the minority report, made under the leadership of Sir William Erle, to be adopted. It was successful. In its passage through Parliament, Mr Bruce introduced the First Reading of the Bill, quoting the Minority Report.HC Deb 14 (February 1871) vol 204 cols 257-73 Provisions of the Act *Section 2 provided that the purposes of trade unions should not, although possibly deemed to be in restraint of trade, be deemed unlawful to make any member liable for criminal prosecution. *Section 3 said the restraint of trade doctrine should not make any trade union agreements or trusts void or voidable. *Section 4 stated that any trade union agreements were not directly enforceable or subject to claims for damages for breach. This was designed to ensure that courts did not interfere in union affairs. *Section 6 provided a system of voluntary registration, which carried some small advantages. *It also allowed union members to access the financial records of the union (now ss 28-30, Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992It was temporarily repealed in the 1970s.) Amendments and repeal However the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871 was passed at the same time, which made picketing illegal. This was not repealed until the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875. The Act was fully repealed by the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974.

Biography  Born the fourth boy of an eight-child, old-but-poor family from Normandy, Marigny was destined to an ecclesiastic career; he was soon sent to S√©es seminary. However, his temperament inclined him more to adventure; and at age 14 he escaped the seminary to find refuge with his older brother, Augustin Etienne Gaspard Bernard de Marigny, who was a Garde-Marine in Rochefort. Marigny broke relations with his father and studied to enter the gardes de la marine as well. He was admitted in 1754 and was appointed to the frigate Valeur the next year, for a 14-month campaign. He suffered from acute sea sickness, but he eventually managed to overcome this problem. Promoted to ensign in 1757, Marigny was appointed to the corvette Z√©phir, and later to the 74-gun Actif, taking part in a campaign to India. After 40 months, Marigny returned to France on Zodiaque, and served successively on Glorieux, Minotaure, Union, the frigate L√©g√®re and the fluyt Garonne. He cruised off Hispaniola, off Africa, Portugal, and India. In 1767, he was promoted to lieutenant and sent in a survey mission on the coasts of India. After an eight-month journey, he returned to France with a m√©moire for the Ministry of the Navy. In 1770, Marigny was given command of the scow Dorade, ferrying ammunition from Bayonne to Rochefort. After Dorade was decommissioned, Marigny was appointed to the harbor of Brest. In 1775, Marigny was awarded the Order of Saint Louis and given command of the corvette Serin, and of the station of Windward Islands. Poisoned by sleeping on his freshly repainted ship, Marigny fell ill for one year and had to resign his command. Once cured, he was given command of the corvette √âtourdie, cruising in the English Channel for six months. In late 1777, he was appointed to the frigate Belle Poule and tasked with carrying Benjamin Franklin to North America. Franklin was returning from a trip to France in which he had requested French aid for the American Revolutionary War on behalf of the U.S. Congress. On 7 January 1778, Belle Poulle was intercepted by HMS Hector and HMS Courageux at 45¬∞ 46 N 8¬∞ W. The ships maneuvered as to take Belle Poule in a crossfire and demanded that Marigny put a boat to sea, which he refused. A British ship then sent a boat and asked \\"Who are you, where do you come from, where are you sailing?\\", to which Marigny replied: After some negotiation, the British officer stated that he had confused Belle Poule for a ship of the revolted colonies masquerading as a French ship.

Drulis made his professional debut in the NFL in 1942 with the Chicago Bears but spent the next two-and-a-half seasons in military service during World War II. He returned to the Bears in 1945 and played there until 1949. Drulis spent his final season with the Green Bay Packers. Drulis went on to spend many years as a defensive assistant. During his tenure as secondary coach of the St. Louis Cardinals, Drulis devised a play that called for one of the safeties to take part in a blitz, code-named \\"Wildcat.\\" He believed this would result in severe pressure on the quarterback, since a blitz by a defensive back is not usually anticipated. However, at first he didn't think he had a player with the athleticism to run the play. That changed during training camp in , when the Cardinals signed a cornerback from Utah named Larry Wilson. Drulis believed he'd found the player he needed for his scheme, and persuaded the Cardinals to convert Wilson to free safety. Largely due to the play, Wilson blossomed into one of the greatest defensive players in NFL history, and became so identified with it that \\"Wildcat\\" became his nickname. After Pop Ivy resigned late in the 1961 season, Drulis shared head coaching duties with fellow assistant coaches Ray Prochaska and Ray Willsey.

Her story was romanticized in the cantar de gesta called the Cantar de Mio Cid, and Robert Southey's Chronicle of the Cid. Succession dispute The twelfth-century Chalice of Do√±a Urraca, donated by Urraca to the Basilica of San Isidoro de Le√≥n, where it remains. Before his death in 1065, Ferdinand divided his widespread conquests in central Spain between his five children, charging them to live at peace with one another. Ferdinand's oldest son, Sancho II, received Castile and the tribute from Zaragoza; Alfonso VI received Le√≥n and the tribute from Toledo; and Garc√≠a II received Galicia. His daughters, Elvira and Urraca, received Toro and Zamora respectively. Sancho, however, resolved to rule over his father's entire kingdom and made war on his siblings. By 1072, Sancho had overthrown his youngest brother Garcia, and forced his other brother Alfonso to flee to his Moorish vassal city of Toledo. Toro, the city of Sancho's sister Elvira, fell easily. But in a siege of Urraca's better-defended city of Zamora, King Sancho was stalled, and was then mysteriously assassinated on 7 October 1072. It was widely suspected that the assassination was a result of a pact between Alfonso and Urraca. The Chronicle of the Cid, purportedly written by one of the Cid's followers, states that the assassin was a nobleman of Zamora, who then received sanctuary in the city. The chronicle is careful not to place any direct blame on Alfonso or Urraca, just as it takes pains to stress that the participation of the Cid at the siege of Zamora was involuntary and supposedly forced on him by King Sancho.  Alfonso's reign  The Castilian nobility, highly suspicious of both Urraca and Alfonso, maintained the siege of Zamora for a period after Sancho's death. In the absence of Sancho, however, their siege was pointless. According to the chronicle, the guilt of Zamora was decided by a trial by combat, which proved inconclusive. Urraca sent summonses to the nobles of Sancho's dominions, calling on them to gather, and Alfonso was grudgingly acknowledged as heir to both Castile and Le√≥n. Suspicion, however, remained and, led by the Cid and a dozen \\"oath-helpers\\", the nobles forced Alfonso to swear to his innocence publicly in front of St. Gadea's Church in Burgos. From this incident dated Alfonso's later antagonism to the Cid. The Chronicle of the Cid states that in his early years as king, Alfonso followed Urraca's advice in all respects. There were even rumors of an incestuous relationship between the pair. Urraca maintained her rule over Zamora following Alfonso's succession to the Castilian throne.  Death  In her later years, Urraca gradually gave up her governing duties, finally retiring to a monastery in Leon, where she died in 1101. She is interred in the Chapel of the Kings at the Bas√≠lica of San Isidoro of Le√≥n, along with her siblings Elvira and Garc√≠a. The following epitaph in Latin was carved in her tombstone: > H. R. DOMNA URRACA REGINA DE ZAMORA, FILIA REGIS MAGNI FERDINANDI. HAEC > AMPLIFICAVIT ECCLESIAM ISTAM, ET MULTIS MUNERIBUS DITAVIT. ET QUIA BEATUM > ISIDORUM SUPER OMNIA DILIGEBAT.

AST REGINA FUIT > SANCTIA QUAE GENUIT CENTIES UNDECIES SOL VOLVERAT ET SEMEL ANNUM CARNE QUOD > OBTECTUS SPONTE. Literature and film Urraca of Zamora, nineteenth-century romanticized depiction. In the poetic legend, Dona Urraca is the wronged infanta, watching Sancho and the Cid despoil her lands from the battlements of her castle shortly before Sancho is murdered. Her brother Alfonso is her loyal and chivalrous defender. The Hollywood film El Cid largely follows the narrative of the Chronicle and the poetic epics, adding to the character of the Infanta a spurned woman role scheming against the Cid, once she seems rejected by him; however it omits the story that Urraca and Rodrigo grew up as close companions in Zamora and there may be other omissions. And it stretches the psychological card that as the older and provoking sister she plays off her brothers Alfonso and Sancho's quarrels for her city and herself [it intimates the incestuous rumours that existed about her and Alfonso, though subtly, as befits a '60's film]. Later in the film, after the death of the haughty older brother Sancho, she focuses her favours to extract from Alfonso compensation for her own grudges with Ruy Diaz. For some reason the film wrongly makes Urraca the ruler of Calahorra, rather than Zamora. Urraca is portrayed by the French actress Genevi√®ve Page. References *Del Arco y Garay, Ricardo.

The line began service in 1905 and officially operated on only 11.4 miles of track. The line ran between South Bend and Pine, Indiana, where it met the Wabash Railroad. Up until and through World War I the line offered two passenger trains round trip daily to Detroit. In the 1930s passenger service was discontinued. The Wabash had purchased the line in 1926 but continued to operate it as a separate railroad. The major customers included Singer Manufacturing and The Studebaker Company. The NJI&I; continued in service until 1982 when the Norfork Southern absorbed the line. Despite both manufacturers going out of business in the early 1960s and early 1970s, the line continued to operate for several other smaller customers. The name is derived from the three states Singer had plants in at the time of charter. The railroad was eventually taken over by the Wabash and operated through the Norfolk and Western takeover. The line continued to service several customers until the NS-Conrail takeover allowed NS to access their customers via the former New York Central Chicago line. The line was abandoned and removed in the late 1990s. Rolling stock NJI&I; was a steam railroad until the late 1940s. The line was dieselized with an Alco S1 and a competing EMD switcher, an NW2 Number 2 (ex-Indiana Northern RR), that currently is stored in Ohio. Currently operations are handled by standard Norfolk Southern EMD geeps typical to Class I local power system-wide. Buildings and structures NJI&I; is unique in having most of the main line torn up but many significant structures remaining. The headquarters at 1508 W. Western Avenue in South Bend still stands and is used as a daycare. The two stall roundhouse remains on Olive Street and is easily accessible for pictures, although trespassing is discouraged. The former Singer plant is no longer connected by rail but is still standing as a senior citizen's home on Western Avenue. This plant was the main reason for creation of NJI&I.; As of 10-18-2018, the round house at 1625 South Olive Street has been torn down, as Norfolk Southern built a small yard next to the former site that is being used to house cars. Current operations NS operates locals to customers along the former NYC Kankakee Belt Line and NJI&I; from the office along the Kankakee Belt beneath the overpass at Sample and Olive Streets in South Bend. Customers include Steel Warehouse (steel coils) and an Ethanol plant (corn) as well as a scrap yard. Were the former PRR Vandalia line to be active still (tracks remain) this local would service those customers too. The PRR Vandalia line is remaining from a connection with NJI&I; down to Eckman Street, site of former Sibley Foundry. The spur to Sibley is no longer.

New York: James T. White & Company, 1909. Reprint of 1900 edition. In 1866, Whitney returned to Boston and was appointed agent of the Metropolitan Steamship Company, of which his father was president. This concern operated steamships on the \\"outside line\\" between Boston and New York around Cape Cod. =Metropolitan Steamship Company= Upon his father's death on October 24, 1878, Whitney was elected his successor as president of the Metropolitan Steamship Company, retaining the position of agent at Boston. In June 1890 the Metropolitan Steamship Company placed the new iron steamer in service between Boston and New York. The 2,706-ton, vessel was built by William Cramp & Sons at Philadelphia. H.M. Whitney was flagship of the Metropolitan fleet until she was run down and sunk by the steamer Ottoman in Boston harbor on September 28, 1892. No lives were lost,\\"Sunk in Boston Harbor. The H.M. Whitney Run Down by the Ottoman\\", The New York Times, September 29, 1892. and H.M. Whitney was later refloated and, after reconditioning, returned to service. It had another collision in 1898, with the schooner Ira D. Sturgis, and again on November 5, 1908 when she attempted to avoid a collision with a tugboat and four barges off Hallett's Point and ran aground on the east end of Ward's Island and sank. In both instances, the ship was repaired and continued on its journey. In 1906, Charles W. Morse acquired control of the Company, placing it under the control of the Consolidated Steamship Company in January 1907.\\"Morse Buys Sound Lines From New Haven\\", The New York Times, February 7, 1907. Morse crashed in the Panic of 1907, however. In 1911, the Metropolitan Steamship Company and the Maine Steamship Company (a New York City-Portland, Maine, operator) merged with the Eastern Steamship Company to form the Eastern Steamship Corporation. The line went into receivership in 1914, but emerged in 1917 as Eastern Steamship Lines. Service on Eastern's Metropolitan Line was maintained until 1941.George W. Hilton, The Night Boat, pp. 99-100, 236-237. Berkeley, California: Howell-North Books, 1968. Whitney retired from the board of the Metropolitan Steamship Company in 1909. =West End Street Railway Company= In 1886, Whitney established the West End Street Railway Company, with himself as president, as a combination of the five street railways of the Boston area. By the next year it had consolidated ownership of a number of horse-drawn streetcar lines, composing a fleet of 7,816 horses and 1,480 rail vehicles. As the system grew, Whitney chose to deploy electric propulsion systems after visiting Frank Sprague and witnessing the Richmond, Virginia system in action. A section of track was used to test the Bentley-Knight underground power line, but it was abandoned because of failures and safety concerns (especially after the electrocution of a team of horses in 1889). After competing in operational tests with the Sprague streetcar system, the Thomson-Houston company was chosen for system-wide deployment of overhead wires.History of electrification of the West End Street Railway =Whitney coal syndicate= In 1889, Whitney and Frederick Stark Pearson, chief engineer of the West End Street Railway Company, formed the Whitney coal syndicate with Benjamin Franklin Pearson of the People's Heat and Light Company of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The group purchased one coal mine and obtained options on others south of Sydney in eastern Cape Breton Island. Premier William Stevens Fielding and the Liberal provincial administration favored Whitney's entry into the coal business because his steamships and street-railway electric generators consumed large quantities of coal. The Whitney syndicate was offered an unprecedented 99-year lease at a fixed royalty; the group exercised its options, acquiring most of the existing bituminous coal mines of eastern Cape Breton Island and co-opting such local figures as John Stewart McLennan and David MacKeen. This process took some months, and Whitney was not ready to consolidate operations at Sydney until early 1893. People's Heat and Light after it was incorporated in 1893, with Whitney as president, and B.F. Pearson as secretary. =Dominion Coal Company= On February 1, 1893, the Dominion Coal Company Ltd. (DOMCO) was incorporated with Whitney as president, B.F. Pearson as secretary and F.S. Pearson as chief engineer. Early investors in this enterprise included Whitney's younger brother, William C. Whitney; his brothers-in-law, Henry F. Dimock and Charles T. Barney; and Almeric H. Paget, who later married William's daughter Pauline.\\"Miss Whitney's Engagement. The Daughter of the ex- Secretary of the Navy to Marry Almeric H. Paget, Son of Lord Alfred Paget\\", The New York Times, July 25, 1895. The new company quickly effected numerous efficiencies and improvements, and production was quadrupled within a decade. There were, however, costly mistakes, prominent among them the tendency to become locked into low-price contracts (such as to Whitney's companies), thus missing a large market at higher prices. By 1901, some 90 per cent of its output was committed to such low-price contracts. The company made a large public offering of stock, which tumbled in price when Whitney failed to get the American import duty on coal removed or at least reduced. Whitney expanded operations at Sydney with the organization in March 1899 of the Dominion Iron and Steel Company Ltd. (DISCO), which had financial backing in both Canada and the United States. Whitney was joined in the new enterprise by his long-time business friends - F.S. Pearson, B.F. Pearson, W.C. Whitney, C.T. Barney, H.F. Dimock, A.H. Paget and J.S. McLennan. The promise of federal bounties, together with concessions from the Liberal provincial administration of Premier George Henry Murray, enabled DISCO to begin work in June 1899 on the largest integrated steel mill in the British Empire. Located on the south side of Sydney Harbour, which Whitney said offered more advantages than anywhere else in the world, the mill was completed in 1901. Iron ore was mined by DISCO on Bell Island in Newfoundland and shipped to Sydney. Competitors in Britain, France, Germany and the United States were initially concerned. However, continuing problems of management and cost control led to Whitney's early withdrawal from the project. Later in 1901, Whitney and his associates sold majority control of DOMCO to James Ross of Montreal, and their minority share of DISCO to Ross and several other Canadian interests. Whitney resigned as president of DISCO in 1902, and as a member of the DOMCO board in December 1903. Also in 1903, James H. Plummer of Toronto gained control of DISCO, and later DOMCO in 1910, placing them under the Dominion Steel Corporation in 1910. Although Whitney remained on the DISCO board until 1909, his focus was redirected to New England. =Other companies= Back in Boston, Whitney established the New England Gas and Coke Company for the purpose of manufacturing and distributing illuminating gas and railroad-grade coke. In January 1896, Whitney announced the organization of the Massachusetts Pipe Line Gas Company. The new concern would purchase gas from New England Gas and Coke, which in turn purchased its raw material from DOMCO. A new contract between DOMCO and New England Gas and Coke was signed on September 30, 1897, and by mid-1899, a new gas plant was in operation in Everett, Massachusetts. The arrangement led to the unfortunate public perception that the contract had been intended to enhance the value of the companies' stock. In June 1917, New England Fuel And Transportation, of which J.L. Richards was CEO, took over the assets and liabilities of The New England Gas and Coke Co. as well as Boston Tow Boat Co., Federal Coal and Coke Co., and the New England Coal and Coke Co. Whitney, ca. 1907 Politics In 1904, Whitney was elected president of the Boston Chamber of Commerce. He also became interested in politics, promoting tariff reform and reciprocal trade agreements between Canada and the United States. In 1905, Whitney ran for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts as a Democrat, losing by 1,996 votes to Republican Eben S. Draper, which prompted a recount. Draper succeeded and became the 40th Lt. Governor of Massachusetts, serving under Curtis Guild Jr., the previous Lt. Governor. In November 1905, Whitney had a public battle with President Theodore Roosevelt over duty reciprocity with Canada. In 1907, two years later, Whitney was the Democratic candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in the general election of November 5, 1907. His candidacy caused Grenville MacFarland, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Democratic State Committee of Massachusetts to resign his post and his membership in the State Committee because of Whitney's Democratic nomination for Governor. MacFarland felt that Whitney represented corporate interests over \\"true Democratic principles\\" in his support of the merger of New York, New Haven and Hartford with Boston and Maine railroads. Whitney eventually failed in his bid to unseat the Republican incumbent, Curtis Guild Jr. Eleven days later, he represented the family, along with Harry Payne Whitney, at the funeral in New York City of his brother-in-law, Charles T. Barney, who had shot himself following the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Company in the Panic of 1907. In 1911, Whitney endorsed Senator Henry Cabot Lodge for reelection to the United States Senate in Massachusetts, due to Lodge's interest in tariff reforms, even though Lodge was a Republican. He supported Lodge over Governor elect Eugene Foss's, a fellow Democrat, opposition to Lodge. Personal life On October 3, 1878, Whitney married Margaret Foster Green (1856‚Äì1932) of Brookline, Massachusetts, daughter of Admiral Joseph F. Green. Residing in Brookline, the couple were the parents of one son and four daughters. * Ruth Whitney * Eleanor Whitney, who married J. P. Gardner * Laura Whitney * James S. Whitney, who attended Harvard with the class of 1908. * Josephine Whitney (b. 1891), who married Frank Boott Duveneck (1886‚Äì1985), the only child of painters Frank Duveneck and Elizabeth Boott. Whitney lived in Brookline, where he died on January 25, 1923, at the age of 84. Largely because of the easy success of his younger brother, Whitney was generally supposed to be wealthy, but he had suffered losses from poor investments over a period of years. When the estate of \\"the supposed multi- millionaire\\", as The New York Times put it, was probated, it was found to be worth only $1,221.

Ivory lamp feeder The qulliqInuinnaqtun to EnglishInuktitut Living Dictionary (seal-oil, blubber or soapstone lamp,PRISM - Blubber Lamps , kudlik ; ), is the traditional oil lamp used by Arctic peoples, including the Inuit, the Chukchi and the Yupik peoples.National Museum of the American Indian : Yup'ik (Yupik Eskimo) Lamps This characteristic type of oil lamp provided warmth and light in the harsh Arctic environment where there was no wood and where the sparse inhabitants relied almost entirely on seal oil or on whale blubber. This lamp was the single most important article of furniture for the Inuit peoples in their dwellings.Joyce, T. A. & Dalton, O. M. (1910) Handbook to the ethnographical collections. British Museum. Dept. of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography Joyce, History It is uncertain in which period the seal-oil lamps began to be used. They are part of a series of technological innovations among the Arctic peoples whose introduction and spread has been partly documented. Oil lamps have been found in sites of Paleo-Eskimo communities dating back to the time of the Norton tradition, 3,000 years ago. They were a common implement of the Dorset culture and of the Thule people, the lamps manufactured then showing little changes compared with more recent ones.Far North Traditions In the Inuit religion, one of the stories of the Sun and the Moon, the sun deity Sukh-eh-nukh‚Äîknown as Malina in Greenland‚Äîcarries an oil lamp which gets overturned spilling oil and soot on her hands and she blackens the face of her brother, the moon deity Ahn-ing-ah- neh (Anningan).Inuit: Finding Meaning in the Cosmos Among the Netsilik if the people breached certain taboos, Nuliajuk, the Sea Woman, held the marine animals in the basin of her lamp. When this happened the angakkuq had to visit her to beg for game.Rasmussen 1965:278 In former times, the lamp was a multi- purpose tool. The Arctic peoples used the lamp for illuminating and heating their tents, semi-subterranean houses and igloos, as well as for melting snow, cooking, and drying their clothes. In present times such lamps are mainly used for ceremonial purposes. Owing to its cultural significance, a qulliq is featured on the coat of arms of Nunavut. Description and use The Inuit oil lamps were made mainly of soapstone, but there are also some made of a special kind of pottery.Alaska Native Collections - Oil lamp Sizes and shapes of lamps could be different, but most were either elliptical or half-moon shaped.The Inupiaq and the St. Lawrence Island Yupik Cultures of Alaska The taqquti or wick trimmers, also known as lamp feeders, were made of wood, willow, soapstone, bone or ivory (see illustration). The wick was mostly made of Arctic cottongrass (suputi), common cottongrass and/or dried moss (ijju/maniq )Fact Sheet: Information about the Qulliq It was lit along the edge of the lamp, providing a pleasant light.A woman demonstrates the use of a stone oil lamp, resting on a metal stand. Gambell, 1960. Anchorage Museum A slab of seal blubber could be left to melt over the lamp feeding it with more fat.Eskimos and the Long Winter Darkness These lamps had to be tended continually by trimming the wick in such a way that the lamp would not produce smoke. Although such lamps were usually filled with seal blubber and the English term 'seal-oil lamp' is common in writings about Arctic peoples, they could also be filled with whale blubber in communities where there was whaling. However, the term 'whale-oil lamp' refers to a different kind of lighting device.Antique Whale Oil Lamps - Demonstration Generally reindeer (caribou) fat was a poor choice, as was the fat of other land animals, seal oil being a more efficient fuel for the lamp. Women used to scrape the carcasses, gathering every bit of fat.

The HMSU was originally formed in the then Royal Ulster Constabulary part of Special Branch and was involved in several controversial shootings during The Troubles. Background The Headquarters Mobile Support Unit (HMSU) was a uniformed elite unit established by the Royal Ulster Constabulary, intended to be their equivalent of the Special Air Service. Members of the HMSU were enrolled into Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch and were trained by the Special Air Service to on how to confront Irish Republican Army (IRA) members and other opponents with \\"firepower, speed and aggression\\".Abstracts on Organisations: H, CAIN website, University of Ulster The unit had its prototype in the Bessbrook Support Unit set up in 1977 as part of the scaling-up of the Royal Ulster Constabulary's numbers and capabilities under Chief Constable Kenneth Newman to \\"Ulsterise\\" as far as possible the maintenance of security. The intensively trained and highly armed Bessbrook Support Unit were intended to take over from the Special Air Service the role of deployment along the South Armagh border to intercept IRA active service units. The Bessbrook Support Unit were in 1979 replaced with a Special Patrol Group, which was in turn replaced in 1981 by the Special Support Unit (SSU).Graham Ellison, Jim Smyth (2000), The Crowned Harp: Policing Northern Ireland. London: Pluto Press. . p. 90 The SSU was subsequently renamed the Headquarters Mobile Support Unit (HMSU) as the initials SSU were considered too similar to SAS, suggesting a military-style unit.David Sapsted and Richard Ford, RUC set to cover its elite squad, The Times, 24 October 1986. = \\"Shoot to kill\\" = The SSU were infamously involved in the alleged \\"shoot-to-kill\\" incidents of November and December 1982, when six republican paramilitaries were shot dead in three separate incidents, all of whom turned out to be unarmed. These incidents, and evidence which came out in court of organised falsification of the details of the encounters, led to the setting up of the 1984‚Äì86 Stalker Inquiry. In this period, according to evidence given in court at the time by Royal Ulster Constabulary deputy chief constable Michael McAtamney, officers selected for the unit underwent an immensely tough two-week assessment of fitness, mental ability and endurance under pressure, followed by a four-week course including seven days devoted exclusively to weapons training; with the focus being to \\"eliminate the threat\\" posed to officers. In addition to standard weaponry, the unit additionally used Ingram sub-machine guns; Remington pump-action shotguns and Browning semi-automatic shotguns; the Ruger Mini-14 light semi- automatic rifle; and 14-shot Smith & Wesson Model 59 9mm pistol carried as personal sidearms. According to one subsequent report, at the time of the 1982 shootings, the HMSU that had been active in the constabulary's southern region comprised two dozen men, working in field teams of six, travelling in pairs of specially armoured unmarked Ford Cortinas, the front passenger with a Sterling submachine gun, the rear passenger a Ruger rifle, and all three including the driver were armed with pistols.David Leigh, Jonathan Foster and Paul Lashmar, Ulster death squad secrets exposed, The Observer, 12 October 1986; p.1 The unit was based at Lisnasharrah, East Belfast, and worked closely with the plain-clothes intelligence gathering unit E4A. Many were English and/or ex- soldiers. According to reports, as uncovered by the Stalker Inquiry, the units operated almost as a law unto themselves, taking orders only from a small group at Gough Barracks in Armagh that was in charge of tasking and co- ordination, who in turn answered only to Special Branch at constabulary headquarters at Knock. Members generally refused to recognise the authority of senior officers not in the unit, a constable on one occasion telling a CID detective to leave the site and come back after he had had a meal. According to American writer J. Bowyer Bell there were two such units in all at the time, of 24 members each;J. Bowyer Bell (1997), The secret army: the IRA, 3rd ed. Transaction Publishers. p. 532 although a 1985 newspaper article claimed at least 12 such squads were active.Paul Johnson, Ulster's undercover squads trained to kill, The Guardian, 16 February 1985 The same article explained their rationale: \\"The circumstances of the shootings have to be put into the context of Northern Ireland. In the same period two constabulary officers who approached a car parked outside a County Down post office were shot dead by IRA men about to stage a robbery. Unionists were not slow to claim that if anyone was shooting to kill, it was the Republican paramilitaries.\\" = Post-1982 = Following the 1982 shootings, the HMSU was reined in. Subsequently, the Royal Ulster Constabulary played only a supporting role in such operations, but the active role in intelligence-led covert ambushes was returned to the British Army, in particular the Special Air Service and similarly trained units, under ultimate police operational control.Ellison and Smyth (2000), The Crowned Harp, p. 128. Tasking of these operations was put into the hands of a joint committee that included the Intelligence Corps and MI5 as well as senior police officers, rather than the original exclusive tight control by a close-knit small group of Royal Ulster Constabulary officers reporting to HQ-level Special Branch. Some measures were also taken to make the Special Branch less of a force within a force, with regional assistant chief constables having to be informed of Special Branch operations in their areas, and a single senior assistant chief constable position created, with oversight responsibility for both CID and Special Branch.David Hearst, Kelly faces obstinate questions on trail pioneered by Stalker, The Guardian, 18 February 1988. House of Commons debates, 17 February 1988, 3:30 pm via They Work For You The HMSU continued to take part in \\"rapid reaction\\" duties, including raids on suspected paramilitary properties, and spearheading riot control. The HMSU continued in being throughout the 1980s and 1990s as an operational sub- department of Special Branch department E4.e.g. Report of the Billy Wright Inquiry, section 5.53, 14 September 2010, describing the structure of Special Branch as at December 1997 In this time the unit traced and arrested several IRA members in Northern Ireland. Police Service of Northern Ireland On 4 November 2001, the Royal Ulster Constabulary was reformed and renamed the Police Service of Northern Ireland following recommendations of the 1999 Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland report implementing the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. On 29 April 2003, HMSU officers fatally shot Neil McConville during a vehicle intercept. In March 2004, the command of the HMSU changed to the newly formed Crime Operations Department with the HMSU becoming part of C4 Specialist Operations Branch separating from Special Branch which was renamed the Intelligence Branch. In November 2014, HMSU officers were photographed following an operation at a house in Newry to arrest members of the Continuity IRA. HMSU officers undergo a 26-week training program including firearms, unarmed combat, roping, driving, close personal protection and photography.

Safar, Tell Uqair: Excavations by the Iraq Government Directorate General of Antiquities in 1940 and 1941, in: Journal of Near Eastern Studies, v. 2, no. 2, April, pp 131-58, 1943 The buildings and artifacts discovered were primarily from the Ubaid period, Uruk period, and the Jemdet Nasr period and included four proto-cuneiform tablets. A sounding was done by a team from the Heidelberg University in 1978. Tell Uqair and its environment Tell Uqair is a small mound just north of Tell Ibrahim, the large mound marking the site of ancient Kutha. The topography consists of two sub-mounds separated by what is apparently the bed of an ancient canal. At maximum the hills are above the terrain line. Occupation history The site of Tell Uqair first had significant occupation during the Ubaid period, and grew to its greatest extent during the Jemdet Nasr and Uruk periods. Some Early Dynastic graves and a scattering of Akkadian and Babylonian artifacts indicate the location continued in limited use up through the time of Nebuchadnezzar. Because of clay tablets found at the site, it is believed to be the ancient town of Urum.Robert K. Englund, Proto-Cuneiform Texts from Diverse Collections (Materialien Zu Den Fruhen Schriftzeugnissen Des Vorderen Ori), Gebr. Mann Verlag, 1996, The toponym for Urum is written in cuneiform as √öR√ó√ö.KI (cuneiform: íå±íÜ†), URUM4 = √öR√ó·∏™A (cuneiform: íåØ), besides √öR√óA.·∏™A.KI (cuneiform: íå¨íÜ†), from earlier (pre-Ur III) √öR.A.·∏™A. The most prominent discovery at Tell Uquair was the \\"Painted Temple\\", a large complex similar in design to the \\"White Temple\\" found at Uruk. Some of the original frescos were still visible at the time of the excavation and were copied. Several frescos were recovered intact and sent to the Baghdad Museum. The temple is believed to date to the Uruk or early Jemdet Nasr period. A small adjacent Jemdet Nasr temple was of somewhat later construction and contained large amounts of pottery from that period.

Majority of Eastern Orthodox Christians in Uganda are under ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa. Organization Archdioceses and Dioceses of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa Historically, Uganda was among the first Sub-Saharan countries where Eastern Orthodox Christian communities began to form. Currently there are nine deaneries which are united into a Metropolis headed by Metropolitan Jonah Lwanga. The headquarters is in Namungoona, a neighborhood of the capital Kampala. The clergy consists of 77 priests and 5 deacons. There are over 100 communities, some of which have no priests and are run by catechists. There are 41 brick and mortar churches, 17 medical clinics, and the Holy Cross Mission Hospital. Approximately 30,000 Ugandans claim Orthodox baptism. Many parishes have schools, day and boarding schools. Tuition, accommodation and meals are paid for by parents or by the Church through support of sponsors from outside Uganda. The Church schools are administered by the Church management but follow the Ugandan Education system as by the Ugandan ministry of Education. Orthodox students who have been sponsored through the Church, usually return to teach in Church schools, but others also leave to teach at non-Orthodox schools. One of the more developed parishes is St. Antonios, Monde, near Wobulenzi. Father Antonios Mutyaba is the priest of that parish. At Monde there are a primary and secondary school, a hospital, a church of Saint Anthony the Great, and a female monastery (St. Mary of Egypt) with two sisters. Sister Maria is one of the first four young women who expressed an interest in monasticism in Uganda. The Russian Orthodox Church also has a mission parish, the Annunciation Orthodox Church on Bukasa Island in Lake Victoria. The parish was founded in 1983, and now is under the spiritual Omophore of Metropolitan Hilarion of ROCOR. Father Christopher Walusimbi is the parish priest. He has taken care of orphans and operates an ambulance service and was instrumental in the establishment of a school and a medical clinic. Both the school and clinic were dedicated to Saint Panteleimon of Nicomedia, but the Ugandan government assumed control and secularized them. The clinic which was started by Fr. Gerasimos in 1983 was abandoned after his expulsion from Uganda in 1988, however the use of aid from the Japanese government finished the clinic. Fr. Christopher planned and built the stone church building which is topped by a multi-colored Russian onion dome. History The founders of Orthodoxy in Uganda were four men, one of them Obadia Basajjakitalo. His grandson is Jonah, present Metropolitan of Kampala. Metropolitan Jonah said: \\"Some of the Africans were thinking people. They read books on the history of Christianity and found out that Catholics and Protestants are in opposition to each other in the way unsuitable for true Christians. They began to study thoroughly the Bible hoping to find answers to their questions. Once, one of them, an Anglican follower Rebuen Mukasa, encountered in a dictionary the word 'Orthodoxy' and became interested in its meaning. It was called a 'true Church, Mother Church' there. He showed this to his friends and began to seek for further information on Orthodoxy\\". This went on in the year 1919. They began to send letters all over the world with the questions on Orthodoxy. One came to a US citizen of African ancestry named George Alexander McGuire. He sent them some literature on his non-canonical \\"African Orthodox Church\\". Rebuen Mukasa and his friends then were finally convinced in setting up this religion in Africa. McGuire directed them to a Black Bishop named Daniel William Alexander who lived in South Africa. He came to Uganda and ordained them. Rebuen Mukasa became Father Spartas. But the bishop turned to be an Uniate. This was disclosed later by a Greek businessman. The friends didn't stop their quest here. Father Spartas and his supporters found a priest from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople who traveled through Africa and baptized and chrismated (anointed) Greek children. He came to Uganda and stayed for about 18 months teaching Father Spartas, Irenaeus Magimbi, Theodoros Nankyama and his friends in Orthodox Faith. It was in the beginning of the 1930s. He advised them to place themselves under the Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria in order to be in Canonical Communion. They sent many letters to Alexandria, but there was no answer. In the meantime they baptized people and opened many parishes moving mainly by foot or by bicycles. They gained many followers, but without outside help Father Spartas, and the God loving Orthodox Christians with him, could not manage alone. Eventually they voyaged by foot, by river, by sea, by land until they arrived in the Alexandrian Patriarchate, where they spent several years being taught what Holy Orthodoxy was, ultimately being ordained and sent back to Uganda. =Canonical Orthodoxy= But later in the year 1946 Orthodox communities of Uganda and Kenya were accepted to join the Patriarchal Throne in full canonical contact. In 1959 in Uganda was sent Bishop Nicolas, Metropolitan of Kampala and the entire East Africa. From 1959 the Patriarch of Alexandria began to assume spiritual direction for the Orthodox Churches of Africa. By 1958 for better ruling of Orthodox communities in Eastern Africa the Irinopolis Metropolia was founded with the center in the Tanzania capital Dar es Salaam], which means \\"city of peace\\", in Greek, Irinopolis. The Bishop again ordained Father Spartas and his friends with the accordance to canons of the mother church. Father Spartas and his friends began to create their church. First four of them converted their relatives to Orthodoxy, and spreading of the faith went further. Spartas understood that the Church is in need of educated people. He began teaching English language in the school founded by him which was officially private and belonged to the Church. The colonial authorities (Uganda received independence only in 1969), trying to secure its monopoly on education, issued a law directing to teach English only in state schools. That didn't stop Spartas and he was then sent to prison for 5 years. From 1958, some young Ugandans were sent to Greece and other Orthodox countries, but few of them returned to the motherland. That became one of the problems. those who returned often conflicted with elder priests. In 1959 Father Spartas visited Greece. He made speeches to Christians and called for Greeks to come to Africa for catechization and founding of a mission. It resulted in creation of several groups, mostly youth, of prayer and material support. One of the priests in 1965, while being in the USA, addressed to 75 Greek parishes asking for help. Missionaries in Greece and the USA started to help African Orthodox followers, and still are helping them. The first of the missionaries was Hieromonk Chrysostom Papasarantopulos, who came to Uganda in 1960. He served in Africa till his death in December 1972. One of the most prominent missionaries was Stavritsa Zachariou, an American woman of Greek ancestry who arrived in East Africa in 1971. She painted icons and taught Africans the basics of housekeeping. The help of Greek missionaries was useful, but the principal affairs on apostolic sermon were held by native Africans themselves. In 1972 in Alexandria for the first time in history three native Ugandans were consecrated Orthodox bishops. One of them was the enlightener of Uganda Spartas Rebuen Mukasa, named the bishop Christophor Nilopolian. He died in 1982 as the prelate of this church. By this time they joined the Alexandria Patriarchy there were more than 10 thousand followers of Makasa and Basadjikitalo in Uganda. There is no statistics on this, and exact numbers can hardly be known. Some sources state that in the beginning of 90s there were more than 200 thousand, and in 2004 there were about 1.5 million of Orthodox Christians in Africa. Starting from 1995, the first African became Metropolitan- the Metropolitan of Kampala and all Uganda Theodoros Nankyama. Archbishop Theodoros contributed greatly to the liturgical teaching and development of the Ugandan Church and was beloved by many. Apart from Evangelizing and catechizing people in the Orthodox faith, Bishop Theodoros also had a dream of offering education to the Ugandan children as much as possible, irrespective of gender. In Uganda as also generally in Africa, the girl child education was not a matter taken importantly or given much attention. He always believed that mothers play a big role in the raising and glooming of the children‚Äôs personality, something that makes it very vital to educate the girl child, equipping her with the qualities to gloom the children both in good morals and Christian faith but also in general knowledge. For this he is remembered for having offered many scholarships to male children but also to many girl children. By it time of his death in 1997, his efforts of women education, together with those of the Ugandan government and others, had brought forth many fruits, in that Uganda had acquired the first ever woman Vice President, who actually represented the President (who happened to be out of the nation) at the Bishop‚Äôs funeral ceremony. From 1997, Theodoros was followed by Jonah, grandson of Obadias Basajjakitalo. Under Metropolitan Jonah, the Church has experienced different developments through the years, more parishes opened, more churches built, more priests ordained for the growing mission, and the Church administration organised more with the creation of 9 deaneries. As a result of continuous spiritual and physical growth of the Church in Uganda, on the 26th of November 2018, the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, headed by his Beatitude the Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria Theodoros II, created a new Diocese for North and Eastern Uganda, electing as first Bishop of the New Diocese of Gulu and Eastern Uganda, his Grace Bishop Silvestros (Maxmos kisitu). __See also * Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria * Chrysostomos Papasarantopoulos * Jonah (Lwanga) of Kampala * George Alexander McGuire * African Orthodox Church (non-canonical) * Raphael Morgan References * The original article is based on a translated Russian article –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏–µ –≤ –£–≥–∞–Ω–¥–µ, where sources for the data are stated.

The actor joined the cast shortly after his role in Holby City came to an end. Morgan was a fan of the soap and was pleased to audition for a regular part. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 5 September 2005, and has gone on to become the programme's longest serving cast member. Upon his introduction, Jimmi is portrayed as being recently separated and \\"fairly new to the profession\\". Jimmi has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Morgan carried out his own research into the disorder to help his portrayal. He later admitted that Jimmi's OCD had begun to impact his own life. Producers introduced the character's former wife shortly after his arrival, and later established relationships with Detective Eva Moore (Angela Lonsdale) and Cherry Malone (Sophie Abelson), whom he married. Morgan has received several award nomination for his portrayal of Jimmi, including Best Male Dramatic Performance at The British Soap Awards. Casting Actor Adrian Lewis Morgan joined the cast in 2005, shortly after appearing in Holby City as nurse Liam Evans. He told Kris Green of Digital Spy that he knew some of the casting directors from his time working on Holby City, and admitted that he was a fan of the show before his casting, having watched it during his college years, so he was pleased to audition for a regular part. Comparing it to his previous roles, Morgan said \\"As far as TV's concerned, this is a bigger role for me dialogue-wise. With Holby, I had a smaller part so [now] it's more work and it's very fast. The way we film is very quick so you do spend a lot of the spare time you have off work actually working so it's not really spare time, you're learning scripts but it balances itself out.\\" Morgan is the show's longest serving cast member. Development =Characterisation= Morgan described his character as \\"very charming, fairly new to the profession and just split up with his wife. I would say that he's a good doctor, and he suffers with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).\\" Morgan carried out some research into OCD to help his portrayal, which included watching television documentaries and speaking with his father, who was a senior social worker. Jimmi's backstory also established that he suffered the death of his mother and has claustrophobia. In 2011, Morgan explained to WalesOnline's Rachel Mainwaring that Jimmi's OCD had impacted his own life and he often catches himself checking car door locks and light switches. He commented, \\"But I suppose it's inevitable that I am like him as I've been playing him so long.\\" Morgan also said that he shares some personality traits with his character, but he pointed out that they have very different styles, as he prefers casual clothes, while Jimmi is often seen dressed in a suit. Roz Laws of the Birmingham Mail observed that Jimmi is \\"a favourite with patients and colleagues\\". =Relationships= Producers introduced the character's wife Amanda Clay (played by Emma Samms) in late 2005. Amanda, a complementary therapist, is older than Jimmi, which Samms initially found flattering, until the other characters were scripted to show their disbelief at Jimmi being married to her. Jimmi and Amanda's marriage is strained and she allows him to \\"fool around\\" with other women, as she believes that he will stay with her. Amanda leaves after falsely claiming that she has cancer. Samms reprised the role in 2018. Amanda returns to Letherbridge following the death of her husband. Samms told Inside Soap's Allison Jones that Amanda initially wants to see how Jimmi is doing and does not let him know she is back straight away. She also said, \\"Amanda is actually in a very desperate place, and she needs help.\\" It emerges that she is in \\"a bitter dispute\\" with her late husband's children over the will. In 2007, Jimmi receives a new love interest in Detective Eva Moore (Angela Lonsdale). Series producer Peter Lloyd was a fan of the couple, saying \\"They're so good together; we could never keep them apart for long, could we? Or am I just being soppy? Any excuse to hear that lovely Lewis Morgan voice!\\" He also believed that Morgan and Lonsdale's good working relationship came across well on-screen. Lloyd was keen to explore Jimmi's commitment issues with the relationship and hinted that things would \\"get very dark for Jimmi and Eva. Writers later established a romantic relationship between Jimmi and his colleague Cherry Malone (Sophie Abelson). Jimmi saves Cherry from drowning in a lake and gives her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, leaving her \\"smitten\\" by his selfless act. Cherry has been developing feelings for Jimmi for a number of weeks, so when he visits her in the hospital, she asks him out on a date and he accepts. Abelson and Morgan filmed the lake scenes in a tank at Pinewood Studios. Lloyd named it the year's biggest challenge, and he said he was proud of the way Abelson and Morgan pulled it off. The characters were married two years later. In the lead up to the wedding, Cherry becomes a bridezilla as she wants the perfect wedding, while Jimmi worries about the cost. The day before the wedding, Zara Carmichael (Elisabeth Dermot Walsh) goes into premature labour and Cherry delivers her son, which changes things for couple. Abelson explained, \\"I think it just puts everything into perspective for Cherry and Jimmi. Their main concern is whether Zara and Daniel's baby will survive.\\" The marriage is soon tested by Jimmi's desire to start a family and Cherry's affair with Daniel Granger (Matthew Chambers), which he threatens to reveal. A month later, Abelson departed the cast to pursue new roles. On-screen Cherry and Jimmi's marriage \\"implodes\\", as Jimmi discovers the affair. He initially \\"holds it together\\", but he loses his temper when he learns that Cherry has secretly been taking contraception, despite their plans for a family. Abelson found the scenes \\"quite excruciating\\" to play out, knowing that Jimmi had been innocent throughout the storyline and was unaware of the truth. She said, \\"I felt really sick and uncomfortable, which obviously is how Cherry felt too.\\" Talking to Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, Abelson explained that towards the end Cherry had started to realise that her idea of the perfect marriage was not what it initially was. Abelson also thought that it was interesting that Cherry and Jimmi were put together, saying they were \\"always two very different people\\". Hermione Pitman (Rebekah Manning) became Jimmi's love interest in 2014. After Zara turns down his romantic advances, Jimmi struggles with the compulsion to wash his hands. He attends an OCD support group and meets \\"kindred spirit\\" Hermione. Jimmi likes the \\"outlandish\\" ways she uses to deal with her illness. The relationship ends when Jimmi learns Hermione kissed his friend Al Haskey (Ian Midlane). Still affected by Cherry's betrayal, Jimmi tells Hermione that he cannot forgive any infidelity. He also realises that they making their illnesses worse by being together. =Arrest and imprisonment= Towards the end of 2019, the character was the focus of a major storyline that saw him arrested for heroin possession. Following a shift as forensic medical examiner, Jimmi is approached by the Major Crime Squad who ask to search his car. They find a large amount of heroin and take him into the station for questioning. A show spokesperson told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that Jimmi is left \\"speechless\\" by the discovery, as it is the last thing he was expecting them to find. Jimmi initially waives his right to a solicitor, as he believes the situation is a misunderstanding, but soon accepts that he is in trouble. The spokesperson said, \\"He agrees to a solicitor and tries to be more compliant ‚Äì yet his nightmare is far from over...\\" Meanwhile, Valerie Pitman (Sarah Moyle) has to open The Mill for the police to conduct a search, and Jimmi makes his situation worse by talking to a witness, which is a breach of his bail conditions. The storyline revisited part of the character's past, as he is brought before a judge that he has clashed with before. Morgan explained that he was \\"excited\\" about Jimmi's storyline, as it was very different from what the show usually does. He admitted that things had been quiet for Jimmi storyline-wise, calling it \\"a bit of a lull for him\\", so he hoped the viewers would \\"get on board\\" and enjoy the storyline. Jimmi spends Christmas in prison, and Morgan told Jones that this makes his \\"downward spiral\\" worse. He also commented that \\"he's not doing brilliantly well.\\" Morgan explained that a lack of visitors and being cut off from his friends takes its toll on Jimmi, who begins to feel alone, saying \\"he's lost faith in everyone around him.\\" The prison scenes were filmed on a specially constructed set, which meant Morgan spent a lot of time away from the rest of the cast. He also kept away from The Mill and Campus sets, which helped him to understand Jimmi's feelings of being alone. Storylines In his fictional backstory, Jimmi's mother was killed in a car accident when he was eight, and he was then raised by his father and elder sister. His father was strict, locking Jimmi in the cupboard under the stairs whenever he misbehaved. As a result, Jimmi suffers from claustrophobia and OCD. Jimmi has a romance with receptionist Sarah Finch (Andrea Green) and they become engaged, but the relationship does not last long, as Sarah leaves The Mill to emigrate. Jimmi is romantically involved with Eva Moore (Angela Lonsdale), but when Eva has to go into witness protection and leave Letherbridge, their relationship ends. Jimmi has his own show on Radio Letherbridge and wins \\"The Golden Microphone\\" Award for the show. After being called out to a house in the countryside, Jimmi is kidnapped by siblings Sissy Juggins (Debbie Chazen) and Ivor Juggins (Steven O'Donnell), who are big fans of his radio show. The siblings keep Jimmi drugged and tied up. Julia Parsons (Diane Keen) becomes concerned when Jimmi does not turn up for the Christmas party, but Simon Bond (David Sturzaker) believes that he has gone on holiday early. Julia asks Rob Hollins (Chris Walker) to look for Jimmi, as it is unlike him to leave so suddenly. Ivor hides Jimmi in a shed when Rob visits their home. Sissy gives Jimmi the keys to his chains when he convinces her they can run away together, but Jimmi escapes and manages to beat Ivor off with a house brick. Jimmi recovers in hospital and Julia is shocked at the effect the kidnapping has had on him. He later tells reporters that Sissy and Ivor have mental health problems and need treatment. When Jimmi visits a young patient, he suffers a panic attack when she and her mother appear to be fans of his. He nearly deserts them when he feels that he cannot cope, but changes his mind when the patient's mother reassures him that they will not harm him. Jimmi and Al Haskey (Ian Midlane) take over the local restaurant The Icon, which they turn into a drinking establishment. Jimmi has a counselling session George Kenway (Lewis MacKinnon), who tells Jimmi that he is struggling at work due to having hallucinations of himself being violent. He explains to Jimmi that in his visions, he sees himself falling in love with a male prostitute, getting jealous over his career, and killing him. Jimmi leaves George in his office while he tells Emma Reid (Dido Miles) about George, and later calls Rob Hollins. The police find a body in George's car, and he is arrested. While being put into the police car, he brands Jimmi a liar. Later that year, on the way home from The Icon, Jimmi enters a car park late at night and is mugged by an assailant in a balaclava. However, they do not take anything from him and Jimmi realises it was an attack on him. Later that year, Jimmi is arrested after heroin is found in his car. He is released on bail, but is sent back to prison when he breaks his bail conditions by visiting a security guard who testified against him. While in prison, The Icon struggles to make a profit, and Al sells it. Jimmi hires John Butler (Richard Huw) as his solicitor. After four months of Jimmi being in prison, Al and Daniel uncover that John is the father of George, and that he blames Jimmi for his son's death. John confesses to framing Jimmi, and he is released, with Julia waiting for him. Upon his release, he begins cleaning his house, and Julia worries that he is obsessing. He explains that he does not know what to do, and when Al encourages him to return to work right away, he is unsure. Julia asks him if he would like to move to France with her, to which he agrees. Reception For his portrayal of Jimmi, Morgan was nominated for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards in 2010 and 2015. He was included on the longlist for the Best Actor accolade at the 2015 British Soap Awards. The following year, Morgan was nominated for Best Male Dramatic Performance. In 2019, Morgan and Ian Midlane were nominated for Best On-Screen Partnership. Abelson said there was \\"quite a mixed response\\" from viewers to the pairing of Cherry and Jimmi, as he has a lot of fans, and the female viewers were \\"quite precious\\" about him. Jimmi's kidnap at the hands of two patients was not a popular storyline with viewers, who said the show had \\"lost the plot and it was too ridiculous.\\" However, executive producer Will Trotter revealed that it contributed to a ratings increase.

His survey of Roman sites, the Itinerarium Septentrionale, was considered an essential reference by all Roman antiquaries of his time. Early life and education Gordon was born at Aberdeen, Scotland, not later than 1692. After earning an M.A. at the University of Aberdeen, where he distinguished himself by his classical attainments, he resided for a time in the city, eking out a living as a teacher of languages and music. He also painted portraits in oil. He afterwards visited the continent, at first probably as a tutor, and returned home an excellent French and Italian scholar, and with a good knowledge of art and antiquities. He told William Stukeley that when at Capua with Sir George Byng (afterwards Viscount Torrington) \\"they sav'd the fine amphitheatre there, the 3rd in the world, which the Germans were going to pull down to repair the fortifications, by speaking to the governor & viceroy at Naples.\\" He studied music in Italy, and when in London he occasionally sang in opera, and among his countrymen was known as \\"Singing Sandie.\\" At one time he appears to have been an itinerant teacher of music, more especially while collecting the materials for his Itinerarium, some time before 1720. Survey of Roman ruins Arthur's O'On at Stenhousemuir from Gordon's book. In 1720 Stukeley, in his Account of a Roman Temple [Arthur's Oon] and other antiquities near Graham's Dike in Scotland, expressed his wonder that no Scotsman had hitherto investigated the Roman antiquities of the country. \\"This,\\" says Gordon, \\"was sufficient excitement for me to proceed still more vigorously in collecting what I had begun.\\" During three successive years he visited different parts of Scotland and Northumberland, exploring, drawing, and measuring ancient remains, at much cost and some hardship. Liberal patrons, however, were not wanting, such as the Duke of Queensberry, to whom the work was subsequently dedicated, the Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Findlater, the Earl of Hertford, and Viscount Bateman, whose cabinet of curiosities he was often enabled to enrich during his travels at home and abroad, Edward Chandler, then bishop of Lichfield, and Duncan Forbes of Culloden, at that time lord advocate. His great patron was Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, Edinburghshire. Gordon was a frequent guest at Old Penicuik House, where he had access to a splendid museum of antiquities, and was accompanied by Clerk in his Northumbrian explorations, as well as in others nearer home. The work, which had been largely subscribed for, appeared as Itinerarium Septentrionale; or, a Journey thro' most of the Counties of Scotland, and those in the North of England. . . . Part 1. Containing an Account of all the Monuments of Roman Antiquity. . . . Part 2. An Account of the Danish Invasions on Scotland . . . With sixty-six copperplates [and an appendix]. In this laborious work Gordon proved himself an honest, painstaking antiquary. Though his theories have long since been exploded, he has preserved records of earthworks, inscriptions, and relics of various kinds, of which but for him all knowledge would have been lost. The appendix derived its chief value from a learned correspondence concerning ancient sepulchral rites in Britain between Sir John Clerk and Roger Gale which Gordon here made public, greatly to their annoyance. He apologises for the inelegant illustrations of his Itinerarium. On page 188 of the Itinerarium Gordon announced his intention of issuing in a few days proposals for engraving by subscription A Compleat View of the Roman Walls in Britain. It is much to be regretted that for want of the necessary funds this survey, with drawings of all the inscriptions and altars discovered, should not have appeared. Later life in Scotland and England Gordon now attempted to give practical effect to a project for cutting a navigable canal between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The scheme, however, was not new to the government, who considered that the profits would not answer the charge. Gordon's circumstances, always narrow, were not improved by the prosecution of projects which never repaid him. According to John Whiston, the London bookseller, he was for some time in partnership with John Wilcox, a bookseller in the Strand, \\"but his education, temper, and manners did not suit him for a trade. . . .Poverty tempted him to dishonesty,\\" or perhaps want of business habits may have rendered him careless in regard to money transactions. His next publication was The Lives of Pope Alexander VI and his son C√¶sar Borgia; comprehending the Wars in the Reigns of Charles VIII and Lewis XII, Kings of France, and the chief Transactions and Revolutions in Italy from . . . 1492 to ... 1506. With an Appendix of original Pieces referred to in the book. The volume contains portraits of Alexander VI and of C√¶sar Borgia, the former probably etched by the author. In 1751 a French version appeared at Amsterdam. A solitary dramatic attempt, Lupone, or the Inquisitor: a comedy, was deemed by the managers to be too classical for representation. He was more successful with a translation of the De Amphitheatro of Francesco Scipione, marchese di Maffei, published as A Compleat History of the Ancient Amphitheatres, more peculiarly regarding the Architecture of these Buildings, and in particular that of Verona. . . . Adorned with Sculptures [25 plates]; also, some Account of this learned Work. Between 1731 and 1732 Gordon had made some additions to his Itinerarium Septentrionale, of which a Latin edition was being prepared in Holland. This never appeared, but Gordon printed the supplement he had prepared for it in a separate form, entitled Additions and Corrections by way of Supplement to the Itinerarium Septentrionale, containing several dissertations on, and descriptions of, Roman Antiquities discovered in Scotland since the publishing the said Itinerary. Together with Observations on other Ancient Monuments found in the North of England. Never before publish'd. In 1736 Gordon was appointed secretary to the Society for the Encouragement of Learning, with an annual salary of ¬£50. In the same year he succeeded Stukeley as secretary to the Society of Antiquaries, of which he had been elected a fellow on 17 February 1725. It was probably through Stukeley's influence that he also obtained the secretaryship of the Egyptian Society, of which Stukeley was one of the founders, and thus had a new bent given to his researches. Gordon published two very learned treatises wherein he undertook to solve the mysteries of hieroglyphics and to illustrate \\"all the Egyptian mummies in England.\\" Their titles are An Essay towards explaining the Hieroglyphical Figures on the Coffin of the Ancient Mummy belonging to Capt. William Lethieullier. (An Essay towards explaining the antient Hieroglyphical Figures on the Egyptian Mummy in the Museum of Doctor Mead). The letterpress is explanatory of three only of the twenty-five plates, and the remainder never appeared. The manuscript, along with the drawings, was apparently in the sale of Sir Charles Frederick's library in July 1786. In the second essay the author mentions another work, as \\"nearly ready,\\" An Essay towards illustrating the History, Chronology, and Mythology of the Ancient Egyptians, from the earliest ages on record, till the Dissolution of their Empire, near the Times of Alexander. It was not, however, completed until 6 July 1741. By that time Gordon had resigned his secretaryships. He was married, and no doubt found his income insufficient. Whiston says that Gordon having been found deficient in his accounts was dismissed from the Society for the Encouragement of Learning, and his effects seized on. Life in South Carolina Gordon sailed for South Carolina in August 1741, as secretary to James Glen, F.S.A., the newly appointed governor of that province. There he eventually prospered. From the recorded copy of a deed still extant at Charleston it appears that one Hamerton, the registrar of the province, farmed out his office to Gordon, and by this deed appointed him his attorney to transact all the business and receive all the fees of the office. There is also among the recorded conveyances one of a large lot of land in Charleston to him, dated 28 March 1746; and in his will he devised to his son and daughter a lot of land in Ansonborough, South Carolina, and all the houses erected thereon. He still kept up a desultory correspondence with Sir John Clerk, to whom he confessed himself \\"vastly weary\\" of colonial life. To the Royal Society he sent an elaborate description of the natural history of South Carolina, which was not read until 25 May 1758. Nor was it printed in the Philosophical Transactions. On 22 August 1754 Gordon, \\"being sick and weak of body,\\" made his will at Charleston. To his son, Alexander, an attorney of Charleston, he bequeathed his own portrait, painted by himself, together with other of his paintings. He also strictly enjoined him to publish his manuscript Essay towards illustrating the History of ... the Ancient Egyptians. The essay was never printed, and is preserved in the British Museum, having been purchased in March 1831. Gordon's wife is not mentioned in his will. He died before 23 July 1755, when the devisees under his will executed a conveyance of land in South Carolina. His daughter, Frances Charlotte Gordon, appears to have been married, on 30 May 1763 to John Troup, a Charleston attorney. None of his descendants are now known to survive in South Carolina. The traditions of the Penicuick family represent Gordon as a grave man, of formal habits, tall, lean, and usually taciturn. Beaupr√© Bell made a bust of him after an original given by Gordon to Sir Andrew Fountaine's niece. The Itinerarium, the essential handbook of all Roman antiquaries of that day, was a favourite with Sir Walter Scott, who has immortalised it in The Antiquary as that prized folio which Jonathan Oldbuck undid from its brown paper wrapper in the Hawes fly or Queensferry diligence.

Background Hoop Jr. was a bay horse sired by the French-bred stallion Sir Gallahad, a full brother to Bull Dog, who sired Bull Lea. He was out of the American stakes winning mare One Hour, a daughter of the French bred Snob, who had been purchased for the third highest amount ever paid for a horse imported into the United States for racing purposes. Hoop Jr. was the first Thoroughbred horse Fred W. Hooper, an Alabama and Florida building contractor, ever bought. He paid $10,000 for the colt at the Keeneland Sales and named him after his youngest son, Fred Jr. Hooper was quoted many years later saying, \\"I liked the way he looked, the way he walked, everything, and I said, 'I'm going to own you.'\\"New York Times Racing career At the age of two, Hoop Jr. started in five modest stakes events. He won twice and placed three times (the Bowie Kindergarten Stakes, the Pimlico Nursery Stakes, and the Aberdeen Stakes), then developed osselets, a condition that mostly afflicts young horses. Hooper had his \\"ankles fired\\" (heat applied), then turned him out at his Alabama Farm to save him for the following year's Kentucky Derby. Most considered this ambition overly optimistic.[The History of Thoroughbred Horse Racing in America] But Hooper, who raced Susan's Girl, Precisionist, and Copelan, said, \\"He was the best racehorse I ever owned. He could run as far as races are laid out and as fast as anybody.\\" Trained by Ivan Parke, in his three-year-old debut, Hoop Jr. came in fourth, the only time in his career when more than one rival finished before him. He was beaten by the great filly Gallorette as well. In 1945, the Wood Memorial was run in two divisions. In the first, Gallorette came in second to Jeep. In the second division, Hoop Jr. won, running faster than both Gallorette and Jeep in their division. In the 1945 Kentucky Derby, Eddie Arcaro rode Hoop Jr. over a muddy track against a field of 15. He took the lead going past the grandstand the first time and kept increasing it until he won by six lengths against Pot o' Luck and Darby Dieppe. Hooper had won the Kentucky Derby with his first race horse. He said, \\"I never thought I'd make it this quick.\\" One week later, Hoop Jr. ran in the Preakness Stakes.http://www.thetriplecrownproject.info/career.php?year=1945 Running in third place (although for a time he was pinched in along the rail), he made his move only to suddenly give way. The race was won by Polynesian, and Hoop Jr. came in second with a bowed tendon. Stud record His racing career over, he entered stud in 1946. He died and was buried at Hooper Farm in Ocala, Florida, in 1964. Owner Fred W. Hooper died in August 2000, aged 102.

The section is open to both boys and girls between the ages of 10‚Äì15 years, and are now formed into local Scout Troops. Scout Troops form part of a Scout Group. The Scout section follows on from the Wolf Cub Pack (8-10 year olds) and Scouts move onto the Senior Scout section at the age of 15. A general Scouting programme is adopted by Scout Troops, but it is possible for specialist troops to be formed. Sea Scouts and Air Scouts are example of specialist programme troops. Organisation The Scout Troop forms the core section of most Scout Groups. The Troop is the longest running section within the organisation, although it was originally termed the Scout Patrol when the movement started in 1907. Most Groups will have one Troop, while some others may, rarely, be able to support two more, depending on the numbers of Scouts and adult leaders within the Group. Scout Troops have an adult leadership team consisting of a warranted Scout Master and one or two Assistant Scout Masters. They can also be supported by adult helpers and Senior or Rover Scout Instructors. The Scouts within the Troop are divided into Patrols, ideally of 6-8 members, with a Patrol Leader and an Assistant Patrol Leader. The Patrol Leader is appointed by the adult leaders, with the Assistant Patrol Leader being chosen by the Patrol Leader. Some Troops may also hold a position for a Senior Patrol Leader. Within the Troop, the Patrol Leaders hold a regular council and are able to plan and run activities and deal with matters of discipline under the guidance of the Scout Master. Training Scheme The B-P Scouts follow a development of the original Training Scheme laid down by Baden-Powell: * Tenderfoot :Basic knowledge of Scouting, the Law and promise and Scouting skills. * Second Class :Before qualifying for the Second Class, a Scout is required to have completed three months service with the Scouts, leading to more detailed understanding of Scouting, and to have developed skills including basic First Aid, healthy living, backwoods skills, The Highway Code and completion of a 13km journey on foot.Second Class Award * First Class :This award includes having completed ten nights camping as a Scout, being proficient in First Aid, tracking and estimating, be able to use and maintain equipment, camp in a bivvy, prepare food with and without a camping stove, and have undertaken a 24-hour 25km journey.First Class Award * Scout Cord :To qualify for The Scout Cord a Scout must complete the First Class Award, hold the Citizenship Badge and three proficiency badges from Backwoodsman, Camper, Camp Cook, Explorer, Pioneer, Tracker, Starman, Weatherman or Woodcraftsman.Scout Cord =Proficiency Awards= The Scouts are also able to complete a range of proficiency awards.BPSA Scouts All Scouting activities are properly supervised by qualified instructors for that activity.

History  DIS has been established with law n. 124 of 3 August 2007,, art. 4. published on the Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 187 of 13 August 2007, related to the reform of Italian secret services. Since that period, CESIS (whose functions had been adsorbed by DIS), SISMI and SISDE has been replaced by DIS, AISE and AISI. On 2017, the Gentiloni Cabinet put under the rule of DIS the activities of the Nucleo per la Sicurezza Cibernetica ('Nucleus for Cybernetic Security'), established in 2013 with the task of managing the wide range of activities of prevention and reaction regarding computer security.  Tasks and functions  DIS oversees the activities of AISE and AISI on the correct application of the dispositions issued by the Italian President of the Council of Ministers or a Delegated Authority, as well as in the field of administrative tutelage of classified informations; it manages the promotion activities and the spreading of the culture about security and institutional communication and it addresses for the unitary management of personnel in the various structures. DIS carries out different tasks: it coordinates the information activity for security, verifying also the results collected from the activities of AISE and AISI. It is constantly informed about the competent operations of information services for the security and transmits the informations and reports from these services, armed and police forces, State administrations, public and private research entities to the President of Council. The Department promotes and ensures the informative exchange between AISE, AISI and police forces; it communicates to the Prime Minister about the acquisition from the informative exchanges and the results of periodical reunions. These informations are transmitted, under disposition of the premier and after consulting the Comitato interministeriale per la sicurezza della Repubblica (CISR, 'Inter- ministerial Committee for the Security of the Republic'), to public administrations or entities interested to the acquisition of security informations. It elaborates, along with AISE and AISI, the acquisition plan of human and material resources and of every other resource useful for the intelligence activities, to submit for the approval of the Prime Minister. While leaving intact the exclusive competences of AISE and AISI regarding the elaboration of the related operative research plans, DIS elaborates strategical analysis or related to particular situations, formulates estimations and previsions based on the sectorial analytical contributions of AISE and AISI. Furthermore, DIS elaborates, also according to informations and reports of other agencies or entities, global analysis to submit to al CISR, as well as projects of informative research on which the Prime Minister decides, after consulting CISR.  Structure  The department has general functions compared to the two operative agencies and it works through the following offices: * Ufficio centrale per la segretezza (UCSe, Central Office for Secrecy) ‚Äì it deals specifically with the administrative tutelage of the secret of State and security classifications, releasing or cancelling the security permit which allows people to access to informations with a classification higher than \\"confidential\\" * Ufficio centrale degli archivi (UCA, Central Office of Archives) ‚Äì it coordinates, disciplines and controls the management of data owned by Italian secret services * Ufficio centrale ispettivo (UCI, Central Inspective Office) ‚Äì it controls AISE and AISI through inspectors, verifying the compliance of the information activities for security to laws and regulations, as well as to directives and disposition of the Prime Minister. UCI does also internal investigations on members or former members of the informative organizations under request of COPASIR. Under authorization of the Prime Minister or the Delegate Authority, inspectors do internal investigations about specific episodes or behaviours occurred within AISE or AISI * Scuola di formazione ('Training School') ‚Äì it deals with the training of operators of DIS, AISE and AISI. Established with law 124/2007,, art. 11. it avails of civil teachers and operates on the promotion and spreading of the culture of security, starting collaborations with similar institutes of the public administration, universities, study centers, think net e think tank both in Italy and in other countries.  Organization  DIS directly depends on the President of Council, expecting the case in which the premier delegates his function to a leader of the government, known as Autorit√† delegata per la sicurezza della Repubblica (Delegated Authority for Security of the Republic). Bodies are established by law n. 124 of 3 August 2007.. The regulation of the functioning has been issued with the Decree of the President of Council of Ministers (DPCM) n. 2 of 26 October 2012, while the one related to the juridical and economical status has been issued with DPCM n. 1 of 23 March 2011. Both the Prime Minister and the Delegated Authority, if established, use the DIS in function of their competences, with the purpose of ensuring the full unity in planning the informative research of the Information System for the security, as well as in analysis and operative activities of intelligence services. = General director = The general direction of DIS is entrusted to a first level manager o equated belonging to the State administration, whose nominee and revocation are exclusive made by the President of Council of Ministers, after consulting the CISR. The assignment has a maximum duration of four years and it is renewable for only one time. According to law, DIS director is the direct referent of the Prime Minister and the Delegated Authority, if established. The director is hierarchically and functionally superordinate to DIS staff and offices established within the same department. The Prime Minister, after consulting the DIS general director, appoints one or more deputy directors; the general director entrusts the other tasks in the field of the department, with the exception of the tasks whose assignment is due to the Premier. The director of DIS has also the function of secretary of the CISR. = Inspective office = According to law 124/2007, the regulation guarantees full judgment autonomy and independence for inspectors in the performance of their control duties, and unless a specific authorization from Prime Minister or the Delegated Authority, if established, inspection must not interfere with the ongoing operations., art 4, ¬ß 8. Inspectors are selected according to specific selection tests and an appropriate formation. Furthermore, the transfer of personnel from the inspective office to the Intelligence services is not allowed. Inspectors, after obtaining an authorization from the Prime Minister or the Delegated Authority, can access to all the acts collected by the Intelligence System for the Security and DIS, and they can acquire through the DIS General director other informations from public and private entities. The inspective office can perform, with the authorization of Prime Minister and also under request of DIS General director, internal investigations on specific episodes and conducts occurred within the Intelligence System for the Security.

Construction  The and bridge features three segmental arches with a span to rise ratio of up to c. 3:1. Its spans are 2.80 m, 7.90 m and 11.40; the thickness of the two larger arch ribs is between one and two Roman feet, making the structure one of the few Roman bridges whose ratio for rib thickness to span is lower than the commonly applied ancient standard of 1:20. The bridge was built of local limestone whose shape varies according to its function: the arches consist of voussoirs, the spandrel walls of irregular stonework. The main pier is protected both upstream and downstream by large triangular cutwaters out of rectangular blocks of stone. The paved roadway rises sharply from the left bank to the main arch, and then drops in a gentler gradient to the higher bank on the other side. The parapet, which has been reported as partly removed by O‚ÄôConnor in 1993, has been apparently repaired in the meantime.  Dating  According to the Italian bridge builder Gazzola, the Pont sur la Laye dates from the end of the 1st or beginning of the 2nd century AD, thus belonging to a round dozen known Roman segmental arch bridges.

A matrix differential equation contains more than one function stacked into vector form with a matrix relating the functions to their derivatives. For example, a first-order matrix ordinary differential equation is : \\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{x}}(t) = \\\\mathbf{A}(t)\\\\mathbf{x}(t) where \\\\mathbf{x}(t) is an n \\\\times 1 vector of functions of an underlying variable t, \\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{x}}(t) is the vector of first derivatives of these functions, and \\\\mathbf{A}(t) is an n \\\\times n matrix of coefficients. In the case where \\\\mathbf{A} is constant and has n linearly independent eigenvectors, this differential equation has the following general solution, : \\\\mathbf{x}(t) = c_1 e^{\\\\lambda_1 t} \\\\mathbf{u}_1 + c_2 e^{\\\\lambda_2 t} \\\\mathbf{u}_2 + \\\\cdots + c_n e^{\\\\lambda_n t} \\\\mathbf{u}_n ~, where Œª1, Œª2, ..., Œªn are the eigenvalues of A; u1, u2, ..., un are the respective eigenvectors of A ; and c1, c2, ...., cn are constants. More generally, if \\\\mathbf{A}(t) commutes with its integral \\\\int_a^t \\\\mathbf{A}(s)ds then the general solution to the differential equation is : \\\\mathbf{x}(t)=e^{\\\\int_a^t \\\\mathbf{A}(s) ds} \\\\mathbf{c} ~, where \\\\mathbf{c} is an n \\\\times 1 constant vector. By use of the Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem and Vandermonde-type matrices, this formal matrix exponential solution may be reduced to a simple form. Below, this solution is displayed in terms of Putzer's algorithm. Stability and steady state of the matrix system The matrix equation :\\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{x}}(t) = \\\\mathbf{Ax}(t) + \\\\mathbf{b} with n√ó1 parameter constant vector b is stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the constant matrix A have a negative real part. The steady state x* to which it converges if stable is found by setting :\\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{x}}^* (t)=\\\\mathbf{0}~, thus yielding :\\\\mathbf{x}^* = -\\\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{b}~, assuming A is invertible. Thus, the original equation can be written in homogeneous form in terms of deviations from the steady state, : \\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{x}}(t)=\\\\mathbf{A}[\\\\mathbf{x}(t)-\\\\mathbf{x}^*]~. An equivalent way of expressing this is that x* is a particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation, while all solutions are in the form :\\\\mathbf{x}_h+\\\\mathbf{x}^* ~, with \\\\mathbf{x}_h a solution to the homogeneous equation (b=0). =Stability of the two-state-variable case= In the n = 2 case (with two state variables), the stability conditions that the two eigenvalues of the transition matrix A each have a negative real part are equivalent to the conditions that the trace of A be negative and its determinant be positive. Solution in matrix form The formal solution of \\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{x}}(t)=\\\\mathbf{A}[\\\\mathbf{x}(t)-\\\\mathbf{x}^*] has the matrix exponential form :\\\\mathbf{x}(t)=\\\\mathbf{x}^*+e^{\\\\mathbf{A}t}[\\\\mathbf{x}(0)-\\\\mathbf{x}^*] ~, evaluated using any of a multitude of techniques. =Putzer Algorithm for computing = Given a matrix A with eigenvalues \\\\lambda_1,\\\\lambda_2,\\\\dots,\\\\lambda_n, :e^{\\\\mathbf{A}t} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}r_{j+1}{\\\\left(t\\\\right)}\\\\mathbf{P}_{j} where :\\\\mathbf{P}_0 = \\\\mathbf{I} :\\\\mathbf{P}_j = \\\\prod_{k=1}^{j}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}-\\\\lambda_k \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\right)= \\\\mathbf{P}_{j-1} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}-\\\\lambda_j \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\right), \\\\qquad j=1,2,\\\\dots,n-1 :\\\\dot{r}_1 = \\\\lambda_1 r_1 :r_1{\\\\left(0\\\\right)}=1 :\\\\dot{r}_{j} = \\\\lambda_j r_j + r_{j-1}, \\\\qquad j=2,3,\\\\dots,n :r_j{\\\\left(0\\\\right)}=0, \\\\qquad j=2,3,\\\\dots,n The equations for r_i{\\\\left(t\\\\right)} are simple first order inhomogeneous ODEs. Note the algorithm does not require that the matrix A be diagonalizable and bypasses complexities of the Jordan canonical forms normally utilized.  Deconstructed example of a matrix ordinary differential equation A first-order homogeneous matrix ordinary differential equation in two functions x(t) and y(t), when taken out of matrix form, has the following form: : \\\\frac{dx}{dt}=a_1x+b_1y,\\\\quad\\\\frac{dy}{dt}=a_2x+b_2y where a_1, a_2, b_1 \\\\,! and b_2 \\\\,! may be any arbitrary scalars. Higher order matrix ODE's may possess a much more complicated form.  Solving deconstructed matrix ordinary differential equations  The process of solving the above equations and finding the required functions, of this particular order and form, consists of 3 main steps. Brief descriptions of each of these steps are listed below: *Finding the eigenvalues *Finding the eigenvectors *Finding the needed functions The final, third, step in solving these sorts of ordinary differential equations is usually done by means of plugging in the values, calculated in the two previous steps into a specialized general form equation, mentioned later in this article. Solved example of a matrix ODE To solve a matrix ODE according to the three steps detailed above, using simple matrices in the process, let us find, say, a function and a function both in terms of the single independent variable , in the following homogeneous linear differential equation of the first order, : \\\\frac{dx}{dt}=3x-4y,\\\\quad\\\\frac{dy}{dt}=4x-7y~. To solve this particular ordinary differential equation system, at some point of the solution process we shall need a set of two initial values (corresponding to the two state variables at the starting point). In this case, let us pick (0)=(0)=1. =First step= The first step, already mentioned above, is finding the eigenvalues of A in : \\\\begin{pmatrix} x'\\\\y' \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4\\\\4 & -7 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\y \\\\end{pmatrix}~. The derivative notation x' etc. seen in one of the vectors above is known as Lagrange's notation,(first introduced by Joseph Louis Lagrange. It is equivalent to the derivative notation dx/dt used in the previous equation, known as Leibniz's notation, honouring the name of Gottfried Leibniz.) Once the coefficients of the two variables have been written in the matrix form A displayed above, one may evaluate the eigenvalues. To that end, one finds the determinant of the matrix that is formed when an identity matrix, I_n \\\\,!, multiplied by some constant , is subtracted from the above coefficient matrix to yield the characteristic polynomial of it, : \\\\det\\\\left(\\\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & -4\\\\4 & -7 \\\\end{bmatrix} - \\\\lambda\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\right)~, and solve for its zeroes. Applying further simplification and basic rules of matrix addition yields : \\\\det\\\\begin{bmatrix} 3-\\\\lambda & -4\\\\4 & -7-\\\\lambda \\\\end{bmatrix}~. Applying the rules of finding the determinant of a single 2√ó2 matrix, yields the following elementary quadratic equation, : \\\\det\\\\begin{bmatrix} 3-\\\\lambda & -4\\\\4 & -7-\\\\lambda \\\\end{bmatrix} = 0 : -21 - 3\\\\lambda + 7\\\\lambda + \\\\lambda^2 + 16 = 0 \\\\,! which may be reduced further to get a simpler version of the above, : \\\\lambda^2 + 4\\\\lambda - 5 = 0 ~. Now finding the two roots, \\\\lambda_1 \\\\,! and \\\\lambda_2 \\\\,! of the given quadratic equation by applying the factorization method yields : \\\\lambda^2 + 5\\\\lambda - \\\\lambda - 5 = 0 \\\\,! : \\\\lambda (\\\\lambda + 5) - 1 (\\\\lambda + 5) = 0 \\\\,! : (\\\\lambda - 1)(\\\\lambda + 5) = 0 \\\\,! : \\\\lambda = 1, -5 ~. The values \\\\lambda_1 = 1 \\\\,! and \\\\lambda_2 = -5 \\\\,!, calculated above are the required eigenvalues of A. In some cases, say other matrix ODE's, the eigenvalues may be complex, in which case the following step of the solving process, as well as the final form and the solution, may dramatically change. = Second step = As mentioned above, this step involves finding the eigenvectors of A from the information originally provided. For each of the eigenvalues calculated we have an individual eigenvector. For the first eigenvalue, which is \\\\lambda_1 = 1 \\\\,!, we have : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -4\\\\4 & -7 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha\\\\beta \\\\end{pmatrix} = 1\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha\\\\beta \\\\end{pmatrix}. Simplifying the above expression by applying basic matrix multiplication rules yields : 3\\\\alpha - 4\\\\beta = \\\\alpha : \\\\alpha = 2\\\\beta~. All of these calculations have been done only to obtain the last expression, which in our case is =2. Now taking some arbitrary value, presumably a small insignificant value, which is much easier to work with, for either or (in most cases it does not really matter), we substitute it into =2. Doing so produces a simple vector, which is the required eigenvector for this particular eigenvalue. In our case, we pick =2, which, in turn determines that =1 and, using the standard vector notation, our vector looks like : \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{v}}_1 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\1 \\\\end{pmatrix}. Performing the same operation using the second eigenvalue we calculated, which is \\\\,!\\\\, \\\\lambda = -5, we obtain our second eigenvector. The process of working out this vector is not shown, but the final result is : \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{v}}_2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2 \\\\end{pmatrix}. =Third step= This final step actually finds the required functions that are 'hidden' behind the derivatives given to us originally. There are two functions, because our differential equations deal with two variables. The equation which involves all the pieces of information that we have previously found has the following form: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\y \\\\end{pmatrix} = Ae^{\\\\lambda_1t}\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{v}}_1 + Be^{\\\\lambda_2t}\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{v}}_2. Substituting the values of eigenvalues and eigenvectors yields : \\\\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\y \\\\end{pmatrix} = Ae^{t}\\\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\1 \\\\end{pmatrix} + Be^{-5t}\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\2 \\\\end{pmatrix}. Applying further simplification, : \\\\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\y \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1\\\\1 & 2 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} Ae^{t}\\\\Be^{-5t} \\\\end{pmatrix}. Simplifying further and writing the equations for functions x \\\\,! and y \\\\,! separately, : x = 2Ae^{t} + Be^{-5t} \\\\,! : y = Ae^{t} + 2Be^{-5t}. \\\\,! The above equations are, in fact, the general functions sought, but they are in their general form (with unspecified values of A and B), whilst we want to actually find their exact forms and solutions. So now we consider the problem‚Äôs given initial conditions (the problem including given initial conditions is the so-called initial value problem). Suppose we are given x(0) = y(0) = 1 \\\\,!, which plays the role of starting point for our ordinary differential equation; application of these conditions specifies the constants, and . As we see from the x(0) = y(0) = 1 \\\\,! conditions, when =0, the left sides of the above equations equal 1. Thus we may construct the following system of linear equations, : 1 = 2A + B : 1 = A + 2B~. Solving these equations, we find that both constants and equal 1/3. Therefore substituting these values into the general form of these two functions specifies their exact forms, :: x = \\\\frac{2}{3}e^{t} + \\\\frac{1}{3}e^{-5t} :: y = \\\\frac{1}{3}e^{t} + \\\\frac{2}{3}e^{-5t}~, the two functions sought.

The system has less protection to ensure a secret ballot, in that people cast their vote outside the security of a polling station. In addition the boxes could be tampered with or vandalized, if left unmonitored. Drive-Thru voting can be a way to prevent manipulation of an election through get out the vote efforts, for instance, in state conventions of a society, in which supporters of a cause or candidate bus in their supporters to vote and then bus them back.

Early life O'Neill grew up in Oregon and southern California, where he began body surfing in the late 1930s. He was a Navy pilot during World War II. O'Neill later moved to San Francisco in 1949 and earned a bachelor's degree in liberal arts at San Francisco State University. Career In 1952, he founded the O'Neill brand while opening one of California's first surf shops in a garage on the Great Highway in San Francisco, close to his favorite bodysurfing break at the time. This led to the establishment of a company that deals in wetsuits, surf gear, and clothing. Jack O'Neill's name is attached to surfwear and his brand of surfing equipment. Although O'Neill is widely believed to be the inventor of the wetsuit, an investigation concluded that UC Berkeley physicist Hugh Bradner was most likely the original inventor. In December 1996 he began a non-profit organization called O'Neill Sea Odyssey which provides students with hands-on lessons in marine biology and that teaches the relationship between the oceans and the environment. It has hosted about 100,000 children since it started. Personal life He was married to Marjorie, who died in 1973, and they had six children.

It was based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from around 1895 until 1904 and again from 1907 to 1909. The team was a member of the Pittsburgh Hockey League, which was formed in 1896 and became known as the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League by 1900. History =Origins= Pittsburgh Athletic Club, 1899, 1900 and 1901 WPHL Champions In 1895, Pittsburgh officials, constructed the Schenley Park Casino which featured the first artificial ice-making plant in North America. The 1895-96 winter season also saw the first introduction of hockey in the city. On December 30, 1895, the Pittsburgh Press made mention of a ‚Äúgreat international hockey and polo tournament‚Äù opening game at the Casino. The newspaper reported that a team consisting of ten players from Queen's University played against a group of local players from Western University (today the University of Pittsburgh) and Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost (today Duquesne University) and a half-hour of exhibition of hockey was played before the polo match. The paper noted that 2,500 to 3,000 fans showed up to watch the game, despite claims of bad weather. No score or records were reportedly kept but the paper did note that the team from Queen's University outplayed the Pittsburghers, who had never played the game before. After seeing the excitement and fan appeal of the hockey game, the Casino's management decided to organize a senior league at the rink. The league was strictly amateur and was named the Western Pennsylvania League.Amateur Sport\\". Pittsburg Press: p. 8. December 20, 1896. The league played its first season in 1896‚Äì97 at the Casino, with four teams, the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, the Duquesne Country & Athletic Club (or Pittsburgh Duquesne), Western University of Pennsylvania (the University of Pittsburgh today) and a team known as Pittsburgh, or the 'Casino' team. The Pittsburgh Athletic Club team was managed by Charles S. Miller, who became the league's president. =Championship era: 1899-1901= The Duquesne Gardens on January 19, 1901 The Pittsburgh Athletic Club vs. Queen's University. Queen's won, 1-0, in front of 5,523 at the Gardens. This postcard of the event was published in 1909The league played at the Casino twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday nights. The first \\"big league\\" championship (season) game was November 17, 1896 between Duquesne Country & Athletic Club and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, won by Duquesne 2‚Äì1. However the league's season was cut short on December 16, when the Casino rink was destroyed by fire. The 'Casino' team, Pittsburgh Athletic Club and Western University teams all lost their hockey equipment in the fire.Amateur Sport\\". Pittsburg Press: p. 6. December 17, 1896. A fire at the Casino in December 1896 destroyed the only ice hockey rink in Pittsburgh and the league dissolved without a championship. The team and the league were revived by the construction of an artificial ice rink at the Duquesne Gardens. The league's second season began on January 24, 1899, when the Gardens hosted its first hockey game in a match between the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and Western University of Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Athletic Club would then go on to claim the league‚Äôs first championship. The team then won th next two titles, which resulted in being awarded the $500 Trophy, in 1900 and again in 1901 The 1901-02 season is considered the first season whereby the league and its teams were recognized as professional. The first professional ice hockey league. To fill their team the Pittsburgh Athletic Club lured players from Canada with promises of high-paid employment and small cash incentives, which was around $30 a week. Two of the players signed by the Pittsburgh Athletic Club were George Lamb and Bill Hamilton. In 1904, the Pittsburgh Athletic Club was captained by Alf Smith, a future Hall of Famer, who won four straight Stanley Cup titles as a player and coach with the Ottawa Silver Seven from 1903 to 1906. The WPHL and its teams lasted until the end of the 1903-04 season, when the league pulled their best players to field one Pittsburgh team, the Pittsburgh Professionals, to play in the International Professional Hockey League. =Revive and quick demise= The WPHL, along with the Pittsburgh Athletic Club team was revived in for the 1907-08 season. The team now featured several of Canada's top talent such as Albert Kerr, Ken Mallen, Garnet Sixsmith and Cyclone Taylor. However the WPHL, could no longer rely on salaries as novelty to attract Canadian talent, since professionalism had spread into Canada. Many players signed up, particular since the WPHL played on the Duquesne Gardens' artificial ice and was not dependent on cold weather to provide a naturally frozen surface, however as winter began and Canadian rinks became available, the players would just flock north to teams closer to home. This jumping effected all of the league's teams. The Pittsburgh Athletic Club itself saw the mid-season defections of stars like Cyclone Taylor and Con Corbeau to Canada. Finally, after the 1908-09 season the WPHL and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club team disbanded.

Parties must willingly give an item to participate in the transaction, once they have given an item they are free to choose something of interest from what others have offered. Value does not come into the equation, as swappers do not necessarily get an item of equal value and are free to choose anything that the other person if offering (without having to pay). Swishing is now being more widely practiced throughout the world and has evolved to include other items such as books and furniture. Not only do people hold 'swishing parties' either as a charity event or simply for the enjoyment of it (while recycling and saving money at the same time), but there are several websites where online swishes take place. History Swishing (deriving from the dictionary definition of 'to rustle, as silk' - which in the eyes of the Swishing team means 'to rustle from friends') began in 2000 when Lucy Shea, founder of green PR firm Futerra and her colleagues wanted to come up with a way to combine a love of retail shopping without contributing to increased consumption. It has since been imbursed by fashion model Twiggy in Twiggy's frock exchange, and as a result has become one of the most popular ways of swapping clothes. Practice A Swishing Party usually has a Swishing Host who lays out guests' items at the venue after the guests have arrived. The Host sends one group of guests to look at the items while other groups wait or do an activity. When an allocated amount of time has passed, the groups rotate. When all guests have seen the items, the Host places everyone's name into a hat or bowl and draws them one at a time; when a guest's name is called, he or she claims an item. The Host waits for only a few seconds before calling out the next name. The remainder of the items are them donated to charity by the Host. There are several types of variations. If the Swish is for charity, attendees have their names placed into the bowl along with an extra amount for a donation; Swishes can be focused on specific items like clothes, crockery, shoes, handbags, and accessories; they can be held for family, friends, or workmates; they can be less orderly, as a free-for-all instead of a drawing by name.

The original gardens were established in 1884 from an old quarry site, under the supervision of Charles Curtis, who was the first superintendent. History Entrance to the Penang Botanic Gardens circa 1900 Prior to the establishment of the present gardens, there were two previous botanic gardens on Penang Island. =The spice gardens (1794‚Äì1806)= George Town was established on Penang Island in August 1786; the settlement enabled the East India Company to establish a strategic base to challenge the Dutch spice trade and maritime supremacy in the Straits of Malacca. In 1794, the Company appointed Christopher Smith as botanist to Penang to establish the spice gardens on Penang Island. Smith, who had originally trained at Kew Gardens, planted a small garden of \\"20 orlongs\\" [10.5 ha] in 1794 in the middle Ayer Itam valley and a larger garden, of \\"300 orlongs\\" [158 ha], at Sungai Keluang. The exact location of both gardens is unclear. In 1796, Smith was sent to the Moluccas, to serve as superintendent of their botanic gardens and to collect specimens of nutmeg and clove for planting in the Penang Gardens. By 1800 there were some 1,300 plants in the two Penang gardens, with Sungai Keluang now predominantly growing pepper plants. That year, a delivery of a further 15,000 clove and 1,500 nutmeg trees together with canary nuts and sugar palms arrived from Ambon Island. The size of this delivery led to the enlargement of the Ayer Itam gardens and Residency grounds; as a result, Smith was instructed by Lieutenant Governor Leith to return to supervise this enterprise and cease collecting further specimens in the region. By 1802 Smith reported that there were 19,000 nutmeg and 6,250 clove trees under his supervision. In the 1804‚Äì05 financial year, the Gardens supported 80 \\"coolies\\" and an operational budget of $11,909. Captain James Low (writing in 1836) described the Gardens during this period as: \\"... embracing one hundred and thirty acres of land, lying on the slopes which skirt the base of the hill near Amie's Mills, a romantic spot and well watered by a running stream now called Ayer Putih. This plantation, in some respects a mere nursery, contained in the above year [1802] the number of 19,628 nutmeg plants, varying from one up to four years old, 3,460 being four years of age. There were also 6,259 clove trees, of which 669 were above six, and under seven years old.\\" Following further collecting trips, Smith returned to George Town in 1805, accompanied by 71,266 nutmeg and 55,263 clove plants together with additional canary nut and sugar palm specimens. On his return, Smith was appointed superintendent of the Botanic Gardens, but died unexpectedly in George Town soon afterwards. By now, George Town had been elevated to the status of India's fourth presidency, and Lieutenant Governor Leith had been succeeded in 1803 by Colonel Robert T. Farquhar. Farquhar sold the Gardens' contents at 12 days' notice for $9,656. Most of the specimens were removed and replanted elsewhere by various purchasers. =The kitchen gardens (1822‚Äì1834)= In 1822, the then Governor of Penang, William Edward Phillips, established the second gardens, following the urging of Sir Stamford Raffles, the superintendent of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Raffles' friend, the Danish naturalist Dr. Nathaniel Wallich, recommended the appointment of Penang Free School headmaster and amateur botanist, George Porter, on a salary of $100, to manage these gardens. Porter, formerly a member of the Calcutta Gardens staff, had accompanied Wallich to Singapore in 1822. Wallich had named a dwarf Dracaena, Dracaena porteri, after Porter. While Porter accepted the position of superintendent he was nominally in charge under a local judge, a Mr. Leycester, who was appointed curator. These gardens were also sited in the Ayer Itam valley; possibly on the same government land reserve as the previous gardens. The Gardens were tended until 1834, when the then Governor Kenneth Murchison, \\"who took no interest in gardens or agriculture\\", sold them for 1250 rupees \\"because his wife could not get enough vegetables from the gardens to diminish her cook's bills\\", although the reason may also have been due to Straits Settlements cost-cutting measures executed by the Governor General Lord George Bentinck. Following the sale, Porter apparently returned to his former position as headmaster. The present gardens 200px =Foundation to 1903= In 1884 Nathaniel Cantley, superintendent of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, established the present Botanic Gardens and appointed Charles Curtis as the assistant superintendent. At its inception, the Botanic Gardens Department was administered by the Gardens and Forests Department of the Straits Settlement. It was engaged mainly in the cultivation of commercial plants, inspecting crops and advising the planting community. When the work connected with economic crops and forestry were taken over by the Agriculture and Forestry Departments, Curtis made himself responsible for the layout of the Botanic Gardens and their transformation from an old granite quarry site. Under Curtis three \\"Experimental Gardens\\" were established, including the \\"Waterfall Nursery Gardens\\" (580 m) that was developed into the present Botanic Gardens, the \\"Top Hill Nursery\\" (777 m) later renamed the \\"Government Bungalow Garden\\", and the \\"Plains Nursery\\" later comprising the Government Residency. Located at 579 m, with an average annual rainfall in the 1890s of 381 cm, the site of the Botanic Gardens embraces over 29 ha, comprising a significant middle portion, of the Waterfall River valley below the Waterfall which cascades from a height of over 120 m. The heavy rainfall often resulted in management problems, and land slips in the \\"steepest part of the grounds\\". The third Botanic Gardens were eventually sited in the Waterfall River valley on land acquired by the colonial government in 1884‚Äì85 for this purpose. Curtis records that much of this land was owned by a Mr Hogan. On his appointment as the first superintendent of the Botanic Garden, Curtis was presented with a tropical valley, including a nutmeg plantation with associated structures, and a prominent location on the trail to and at the foot of the \\"Great Waterfall\\". While an avid and acknowledged botanist and plant collector, he proved himself to be a creative landscape designer in crafting the design and development of the Gardens. On accepting the position, Curtis proposed a long term strategy as to the development of the gardens and its potential role as a botanical repository and clearing house. Curtis' immediate actions were to develop a plant nursery and undertake a programme of works to create a pleasurable recreational and botanical garden in the valley. This vision was spelt out in detail in his 1885 annual report to Cantley as part of the Department's Annual Report. This included proposals to extend and develop the existing \\"Waterfall Gardens\\", the construction of road circuits, the erection of plant-houses for the propagation and cultivation of various species, and the provision of recreational venues. His immediate steps in 1885‚Äì86 were focused upon increasing the area of the Gardens in the valley together with improving road and pedestrian access. In his 1885 report, Curtis commented on \\"the poor gravelly soil in the valley\\" which required that considerable attention should be given to the preparation of the ground for tree planting. However, the \\"natural advantages of the surroundings, from a landscape gardening point of view ... in a great measure compensate for this defect.\\" From the outset, Curtis introduced aesthetic considerations into the design of the Gardens, through the strategic placement of trees and the clearance of jungle. The circular road circuits he had constructed carefully weave through the valley opening up views, framing vantage points, and providing surprises to the visitor. Curtis' design was motivated by his objective to take advantage of and exploit the natural landscape in the first instance, and then locate plantings in functional or species family associations. A later supervisor, Frederick Sydney Banfield, observed of the planting design structure established by Curtis that: \\"There is little systematic arrangement even in the botanical sections, the principal aim having been to arrange the plants in such a way as to enhance the natural beauty of the Gardens\\". Curtis suffered from ill-health during his time as superintendent of the gardens, which he attributed to the quality and location of the accommodation made available to him. In March 1903, health problems caused him to take early long service leave and he formally retired on 7 December 1903, to be replaced by Walter Fox. =Since 1903= The orchidarium is nestled within the gardens In 1910, the Gardens were threatened by a proposal to turn the valley in which they were located into a reservoir. The Gardens were handed over to the Municipality for this purpose, but the plan was abandoned and the gardens were returned to the Government in 1912. Only a small reservoir was eventually built, at the foot of the Waterfall. During the period 1912 to 1921, much of the efforts of Curtis and his succeeding Superintendents was left to deteriorate. However, the herbarium collection increased and more time was directed to horticulture and botanical work. In subsequent years the garden matured and took on the visual aesthetic envisaged by Curtis. Several new structures and offices were added to the gardens but its overall structure, path and road configurations, the position and form of older plant houses, and the spatial layout of much of the plantings was little changed from Curtis‚Äô original design. Frederick Flippance, who was appointed assistant supervisor in 1921, was faced with the formidable task of relaying the gardens, in addition to his advisory role on roadside trees and other planting work in the municipal area. The work of the Gardens Department began to extend to ornamental planting of Georgetown, the Governor's Residence as well as the gardens themselves. A fine formal garden was established in 1936 in the Waterfall Gardens. Flippance remained Assistant Supervisor until 1937. The Second World War took its toll on the Gardens. Although some of the Malay staff remained with the Gardens during the Japanese occupation, lack of funds and direction, together with the accumulation of war debris, left the Gardens in a very bad state. The Japanese excavated tunnels near the lily ponds and turned them into ammunition works and storage facilities, and a torpedo assembly station. Upon British reoccupation in 1945, much restoration and cleaning up had to be done. As part of the post war reorganisation, the Penang Botanic Gardens was separated from its parent establishment in Singapore and, in 1946, the Gardens administration passed from Singapore to the Federation of Malay States. Whilst under the direction of Frederick Sydney Banfield, the Botanic Gardens were restored to their original splendour. In 1956, the first Malaysian ‚Äî Cheang Kok Choy ‚Äî was appointed as curator of Gardens, where he had previously worked as a trainee gardener. He continued to carry out the policy laid down by his predecessors until his retirement in 1976. Today, the administration of the Gardens is the responsibility of the Penang State Government under the Pejabat Kebun Bunga (Penang Botanic Gardens Department). The Gardens today A monkey on the branches of a cannonball tree After the handover to the Penang State Government, the Gardens gradually eroded their role in research and botanical activities. Consequently, most of the herbarium collections of Curtis and successive superintendents were transferred to the Singapore Botanic Gardens, since when the Penang Botanic Gardens function more as a park than as botanic gardens. The Gardens' main objectives include \\"conservation programmes, provision of a clean, safe and conducive public recreation environment, education and raising of public awareness in the appreciation of nature and gardening\\". The Gardens continue some research, collaborating with other Botanic Gardens in the development and implementation of botanical and ecological research programmes both nationally and internationally. The Penang Botanic Gardens Department aims to provide visitors with programmes that focus on the historical and cultural heritage of the gardens, the plant collections, natural landscape and rich diversity of flora and fauna. It also aims to provide professional advice related to botany, taxonomy, horticulture and landscaping. The gardens occupy a 29 ha. site in a valley described as \\"an amphitheatre of hills\\" covered with lush tropical rain-forests. Its lush greenery and tranquil setting makes it a favourite park and a popular tourist destination. It is Penang's unique natural heritage, being the only garden of its kind in Malaysia. As well as being a repository of flora and fauna, unique to the country and to the region, it serves as a \\"green lung\\" for metropolitan Penang. As such, the garden is a popular recreational spot; some of the recreational activities include jogging, walking, jungle trekking and aerobics. Amongst the flora in the gardens, most conspicuous are the cannon ball tree (Couroupita guianensis)Simon Gardner, Pindar Sidisunthorn and Lai Ee May, 2011. Heritage Trees of Penang. Penang: Areca Books. and the large buttress roots of the sengkuang tree (Dracontomelon dao). There is also the pinang palm (Areca catechu) that lent its name to the island of Penang, and the black lily (Tacca integrifolia) with its unique purplish-black coloured flowers. The candle tree (Parmentiera cereifera), the endemic slipper orchid (Paphiopedilum barbatum) and the ginger, Geoctachys penangensis, can also be found in the gardens. There are also collections of rare plant species housed in the Fern House, Palm Collection, Aroid Walkway, Orchidarium, Perdana Conservatory, Cactus House, Bromeliad and Begonia House, Herb Garden, Fern Rockery, Sun Rockery, and the Formal Garden. The garden fauna include long-tailed macaques, dusky leaf monkeys, black giant squirrels as well as many insects and butterflies. The path around the Lily Pond offers access to tropical rainforest, a short distance from the Botanic Gardens gate. The walk from the Lower Circular Road passes two prominent groups of palms and bamboo clusters along the Waterfall River. Two orchid houses provide a comparison between cultivated hybrids and wild orchid species. The best time to admire the flowering trees is during the dry season, from February to April, when the Thai bungor (Lagerstroemia loudonii), the Javanese cassia (Cassia javanica) and the rosy trumpet (Tabebuia rosea) are in full flower. From the Lily Pond path there is a climb to the site of Charles Curtis' former house, although only a few bricks can still be seen. Various hiking paths lead from the Botanic Gardens, to Penang Hill and to Mount Olivia at the north. Mount Olivia was the site of the Raffles' home and was named after Raffles' wife, Olivia. Waterfall Aquatint of the 400ft Waterfall at Penang Botanic Gardens in 1818 The waterfall and reservoir are private property although they can be visited by arrangement with the Penang Water Authority (Perbadanan Bekalan Air Pulau Pinang). The Friends of the Penang Botanic Gardens, a non-governmental organisation, organises monthly visits to the waterfall. The Penang waterfall was closed off to the public as a safety measure during the confrontation between the newly independent Malaysia and Indonesia in the 1960s. Early visitors to Penang Island described it as one of the key attractions of the island, including Ibrahim Munshi, son of Munshi Abdullah, who described it in his journal, the \\"Kisah Pelayaran\\". The waterfall was an important source of water for ships calling at Penang port in the early part of the 19th century. In 1804, the first water treatment plant in Malaysia was set up here, to supply the needs of 10,000 people in Penang. In 1805, an aqueduct was constructed to channel water from the fall via Pulau Tikus to a reservoir near the port. The quality of the water, filtered through the aged rocks of Penang Hill, was very high, and was described by the early sailors as \\"sweet\\". The oval-shaped reservoir of the Penang Waterfall was constructed in the gardens in 1892 by British engineer James MacRitchie, who was also responsible for the expansion of MacRitchie Reservoir in Singapore. Around the time he was undertaking the expansion in Singapore, MacRitchie was invited by the Penang Municipal Commission in 1891 to review the options (and high cost tender results) for a proposed reservoir in Penang. He issued a report and recommended a reservoir at the waterfall. He also recommended the municipality acquire the right to draw water from Sungei Ayer Itam for the future. The Penang reservoir was reconstructed in 1950. Today, only a small proportion of the Penang water supply comes from the waterfall reservoir ‚Äî approximately 10‚Äì15% of the population obtain their water from here, while most of the island's water supply comes from Sungai Muda, on the border of Penang and Kedah.

Rugby career Jones played for several rugby clubs but was selected for Welsh international duty while with Newport and Pontypool. His first cap was against the 1912 touring South Africans and although Wales lost the game, he was reselected a few months later to face England in the 1913 Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Tommy Vile, Wales lost on home soil for the first time against England since 1895. The selectors kept faith with Jones, and played in two of the next three games of the tournament, which saw wins for Wales and Jones against Scotland and France. In 1914, Jones was selected to play in all four matches of that year's Championship. Wales only lost one game, narrowly against eventually Grand Slam champions England. Jones was best known during this campaign for the buildup to the match against Ireland. The match was to be played at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on 14 March, and the Welsh team had travelled out to Ireland the day before. Jones and fellow Newport team mate Harry Uzzell decided to visit a local theatre in the night before the match. There they were met by some of the Irish players, where they were approached by Ireland's William Tyrell, later to become Air Vice Marshal Sir William Tyrell, Surgeon to George VI, who challenged Jones to a physical contest on the pitch the next day. What appeared to start as good natured banter turned into a full-blooded contest during the match. Jones took several early knocks, not just from Tyrell but from other members of the Irish pack.Mortimer, David; Classic Rugby Clangers. Robson Books, p 34. At half time Uzzell decided to pay the Irish back and the game descended into running fist fights and the match is remembered as being one of the most violent in international rugby.

W. Murnau. Plot The Grand Duke of Abacco is heir to a small and heavily indebted Mediterranean island. The Grand Duke is trying to hide from usurer Marcowitz who demands debt repayment. One hope to improve the situation would be a wedding with the Russian Grand Duchess Olga who sent him a letter saying she is determined to marry him despite not knowing him and against the opposition of her brother the Crown Prince of Russia. Businessman Bekker offers a substantial sum of money to exploit a sulphur mine but the Grand Duke is worried it would have negative effects on his subjects. Bekker joins with local conspirators to organise a revolution against the Grand Duke. In addition, the letter from Grand Duchess Olga is fraudulently obtained by Marcowitz. Thief-detective Phillip Collin, passing as Professor Pelotard, accepts to retrieve from Markowitz incriminating letters written by Congressman Isaac. In the process, he also finds the letter from Grand Duchess Olga and replaces it with a fake. He asks Isaac for a 50,000 pound loan as his fee and tells him that he will use it to speculate on Abacco's debt. The Grand Duke decides to go secretly to the continent to retrieve Olga's letter. Phillip Collin meets an unknown woman in a caf√©, who asks him to help her hide from her pursuers. He willingly obliges and soon finds out that she is Grand Duchess Olga and that her pursuer is her brother. The newspapers report on the speculation on Abacco's bonds, on the outbreak of a revolution in Abacco and on the disappearance of the Grand Duke. All regular voyages to Abacco are interrupted but Olga, who now passes as Collins' wife, manages to charter a ship to take her to Abacco island. She accepts to take along the Grand Duke, whom she has not recognised, and who introduced himself as a supporter of the Grand Duke. Marcowitz boards the Russian Crown Prince's warship and convinces him to go to Abacco by showing him his sister's (fake) letter. In Abacco the Grand Duke and Collin overcome the self-proclaimed president and his accomplices after a short fight. However further revolutionaries overpower the Grand Duke and start preparing his hanging. Olga now understands who he is and wants to buy him off the revolutionaries, without success. At that moment, the Russian Crown Prince take control of the situation with his sailors. However, he is also inclined to have the Grand Duke hanged, for having sold his sister's letter. However Olga dismisses the letter as clumsy forgery. Collin gives back the authentic letter to the Grand Duke which allows him to refute the accusation. The Crown Prince orders an immediate marriage and Collin celebrates the success of his speculation on Abacco's debt.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film: Cast In alphabetical order * Alfred Abel as Philipp Collins * Mady Christians as Gro√üf√ºrstin Olga von Ru√üland * Adolphe Engers as Don Esteban Paqueno * Julius Falkenstein as Ernst Isaacs * Ilka Gr√ºning as Augustine, die K√∂chin * Guido Herzfeld as Markowitz, ein Wucherer * Georg August Koch as Der gef√§hrliche Verschw√∂rer * Harry Liedtke as Don Roman XX, Gro√üherzog von Abacco * Walter Rilla as Luis Hernandez * Hans Hermann Schaufuss as Der bucklige Verschw√∂rer * Robert Scholtz as Bruder der Gro√üf√ºrstin * Max Schreck as Der unheimliche Verschw√∂rer * Hermann Vallentin as Herr Binzer * Balthasar von Campenhausen as Adjutant Production and release The film is based on the eponymous novel by Swedish author Frank Heller adapted by Thea von Harbou.

Pensis was born on in the Pfaffenthal quarter of Luxembourg City. In 1933, he founded and became the first conductor of the Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra. He moved to the United States in 1940, conducting the New Jersey Philharmonic Orchestra and the Sioux City Symphony Orchestra. He conducted at least three concerts in Carnegie Hall. During Pensis' tenure with the Luxembourg Orchestra the first violin chair was occupied by Ern(e)st Eichel, a Polish violinist who was born in Sambor (Galicia) and had studied in Vienna and Cologne. This violinist who also led occasionally the Luxembourg Orchestra tried after the war to make a career as a conductor. For that purpose Eichel chose the 'nom de plume' of Ernest Borsamsky. Under this pseudonym, created by inverting the syllables of his birth town and adding a Polish \\"sky\\" he made some highly collectable recordings for East German Radio in Berlin and Leipzig. He also conducted once the Berlin Philharmonic in 1949. In 1956 his name can be traced last when he conducted the Dresden Orchestra.

It was the terminus of a branch line from Cresswell and opened in 1901. Facilities The initial station buildings were of a temporary nature and a permanent structure was built in 1910. Later that year, the goods yard was expanded and the goods shed was extended. A new loading dock was also built and a crane was later provided. Cheadle station had a loop but no turntable and so most trains left Cheadle with the locomotive running \\"bunker first\\". The remains in 1983 Later years Passenger services were withdrawn in June 1963, though the closure of the service was not directly due to the Beeching Axe (withdrawal had already been proposed prior to the publication of his report in March of that year). Local sand traffic from nearby quarries continued and a new road-rail loading dock replaced the goods shed in the late 1960s. Approximately 1,200 tons per day was being moved by this time but in the 1970s the amount of traffic reduced and on 6 March 1978 public freight working was withdrawn.

DekaMarkt is a Dutch retail company which operates a chain of supermarkets in the country. DekaMarkt is a member of Superunie, a Dutch purchasing organization for supermarkets. DekaMarkt has stores in North Holland, South Holland, Gelderland, Overijssel and Flevoland.  History  Dutch businessman Dirk Kat opened his first grocery store in Velsen-Noord in 1941, but it had to close in 1944 as a result of the German occupation of the Netherlands. In 1949, under his leadership, the first complete self-service store of the Netherlands opened its doors under the name Kijkgrijp. In 1950, Kat established joint purchasing with other grocers so that together they could guarantee low prices to their customers. In 1952 Kat built a central warehouse, which was the forerunner of the distribution centres. In 1955, the first modern supermarket in the Netherlands was opened in IJmuiden. This supermarket also sold fresh products such as bread, meat and vegetables. From 1969 the name DekaMarkt was introduced at the stores in Wormerveer and Zaandam, and it would eventually be introduced at all stores by 1986. Deka is derived from the initials of Dirk Kat. In 1974, the first liquor store DekaMarkt Slijterij was opened. = Merger with Dirk = Since 2001, the company had been maintaining a close cooperation with Dutch supermarket chain Dirk. In 2008, the supermarket entered a merger with Dirk to form Detailresult Groep. Both supermarket formulas continued to exist side by side. At the beginning of 2013, the DekaMarkt stores were converted to a new formula, which would give them the look and feel of a real market.  Other activities  In addition to the supermarket activities, the company has a wine shop and a garden centre. The Deka Wine Market (Deka Wijnmarkt) opened on 17 October 2007 in Beverwijk. This is now closed and the wine range is in the shop itself. The garden centre, DekaTuin, opened its doors in March 2008 in Heiloo, and later a second location was added in Haarlem. DekaMarkt also has a petrol station on the same site. Furthermore, DekaMarkt has its own production company with bakeries, cattle and agriculture and a butcher's shop and has several distribution centres and fresh produce centres.

After his playing days ended, Floyd became a manager in Minor league baseball, and spent the next thirty years coaching. In and , he was a major league coach with the New York Mets. Early years On top of playing shortstop for the Southern California champion El Segundo High School baseball team, Floyd also quarterbacked El Segundo's football team his senior year. After two years at University of California, Los Angeles on a baseball scholarship, Floyd signed with the Baltimore Orioles as an amateur free agent in August . Over five seasons in the Orioles' farm system, Floyd batted .259 with nineteen home runs and 252 runs batted in. He received his first call up to the majors in September . He went 1-for-9 (a double) with one RBI on a sacrifice fly. Baltimore Orioles Though he spent most of his minor league career at shortstop, Floyd made the Orioles' opening day roster as a back-up infielder, receiving playing time at second and third as well. Floyd batted .219 with seven runs and just one RBI, also coming on a sac fly. The Orioles won a franchise best 109 games to capture the American League East by nineteen games over the Detroit Tigers. While Floyd was on the post season roster, he did not appear in the 1969 American League Championship Series or the 1969 World Series. The 1970 Orioles' bullpen struggled early in the season. With Gold glover Mark Belanger firmly entrenched at short, the Orioles had little use for a light hitting middle infielder. On June 15, , Floyd was traded to the Kansas City Royals for former Orioles pitcher Moe Drabowsky. Kansas City Royals Floyd went 0-for-10 in a brief trial before being demoted to the triple A Omaha Royals. Before the demotion, he collected his first RBI of the season on a ground out. He batted .292 with two home runs and 32 RBIs at Omaha to earn a return to the majors that September. In his first game back, Floyd got his first two hits of the season, and ehad a three RBI game against the Chicago White Sox. The next day, he went 3-for-7 in a doubleheader with the ChiSox. His sixth inning single off Wilbur Wood in the second game drove in the tying and winning runs. Floyd remained the club's regular shortstop over the remainder of the season. Albeit, with just eleven games left. In this short trial, Floyd batted .424 with eight RBIs and four runs scored. During the off season, the Royals traded incumbent shortstop Jackie Hernandez to the Pittsburgh Pirates in a six player deal that netted the Royals shortstop Freddie Patek, whom they intended to use as their everyday shortstop. Floyd began the season in Omaha, but received a call to the majors in late June. He batted .118 Through July, and was optioned back down. He again received a call up when rosters expanded in September, but batted only .163. A stomach disorder suffered by Patek in Spring training landed Floyd starting shortstop duties to start the season. In nine games, Floyd batted .138 with two RBIs and one run scored, and committed two errors in 39 chances on the field. Once Patek was ready to return, Floyd was demoted to Omaha. He came back up in late June, and batted .190 with three RBIs and eight runs over the rest of the season.

Summary Marcuse writes that the western world has reached a new stage of development, in which \\"the defense of the capitalist system requires the organization of counterrevolution at home and abroad.\\" He accuses the west of \\"practicing the horrors of the Nazi regime\\", and of helping to launch massacres in Indochina, Indonesia, the Congo, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Sudan. He discusses the problems of the New Left, as well as other topics such as the political role of ecology. Citing author Murray Bookchin's Post- Scarcity Anarchism (1971), Marcuse argues that ecology must be taken \\"to the point where it is no longer containable within the capitalist framework\\" by \\"extending the drive within the capitalist framework.\\" Marcuse offers a discussion of the role of nature in Marxist philosophy informed by philosopher Alfred Schmidt's The Concept of Nature in Marx (1962). Marcuse also offers a discussion of art, including literature and music, in relation to revolution. He cites Arthur Schopenhauer's observation, in The World as Will and Representation (1818), that music \\"gives the innermost kernel preceding all form, or the heart of things\\". Publication history Counterrevolution and Revolt was first published by Beacon Press in 1972. Reception Counterrevolution and Revolt was reviewed by the gay rights activist Jearld Moldenhauer in The Body Politic. Moldenhauer suggested that Marcuse found the gay liberation movement insignificant, and criticized Marcuse for ignoring it even though \\"many gay activists\\" had been influenced by his earlier book Eros and Civilization (1955). In Theory & Society, the intellectual historian Martin Jay called Counterrevolution and Revolt one of Marcuse's \\"major works\\". He suggested that Marcuse's comments about art reveal his indebtedness to Romanticism. Brian Easlea described Marcuse's view that \\"Marx's notion of a human appropriation of nature is not altogether free from the hubris of domination\\" as courageous. He wrote that Marcuse \\"explicitly adds to his decades of social analysis a dimension that had always been implicit: the male-female relation\\", and that Marcuse's \\"condemnation of the established science and call for a new science would appear to be a condemnation of 'male' science and a call for a new 'female' science.\\" The philosopher Charles Crittenden considered Marcuse's advocacy of \\"working for change within the system\\" to be a retreat from his advocacy, in previous works such as An Essay on Liberation (1969), of revolutionary violence and confrontation as ways of achieving social transformation. Andrew Light compared Marcuse's views to those of Murray Bookchin.

They originate from Cochabamba and are one of the most popular cumbia bands in South America. The press have called this band \\"the box-office record breakers\\" due to its vast popularity among people in Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Ecuador and other countries.  History  The band is composed of six brothers: *First voice: Walter Rodriguez *Keyboards: Ren√°n Rodriguez *First Guitar: Remberto Rodriguez *Bass: H√©ctor Rodriguez (Director) *Drums: Norberto Rodriguez *Sampler and Rhythms: Fernando Rodriguez The live concerts include an animator, German Zambrana being one of them during the late 90s. Los Ronisch, named after the family's old German R√∂nisch piano, started playing in the late 80's, focusing more in a type of Rock that is similar to new wave, with influences from disco, electronic music, and pop. One of their first hits, Isabel, remains a classic of pop music in Bolivia. This type of music regarded as \\"Disco\\" in Bolivia was also practiced by another popular Bolivian band called Maroyu. Towards the end of the 90's the band remained highly popular; however, it shifted the focus of its music towards Cumbia (Los Ronisch played Cumbia and Huay√±o regularly since their start in the late 80's). This shift to a more electronic sound, relying more heavily on the keyboards and the sampler as a backbone, made some people in Peru relate the band's style to Tecnocumbia. This shift can be heard in the \\"Regresa\\" album of 1999. The popularity of the band exponentially increased with the release of \\"Regresa\\" and the singles \\"Amigos Traigan Cerveza\\" and \\"Prefiero Estar Lejos\\", making the band play numerous cities throughout South America, USA and Europe (Spain).

Early life Petherbridge was born in Devonport, Devon in 1927 and was the only child of parents Frederick Petherbridge and Violet Trout. The family relocated to Bristol when George was young, and he was brought up in the city. Football career He joined Bristol Rovers in 1945, and spent his entire professional career with the club, eventually leaving seventeen years later in 1962. He played as a winger and made 457 appearances in the Football League, and 496 in all competitions, scoring 85 league and seven cup goals. Joining the club in time for the resumption of League football after play had been suspended during World War II, Petherbridge achieved the impressive feat of scoring at least one goal in each of the sixteen seasons immediately after the war. He is one of only three men to have played for Rovers for more than fifteen years, and is the fifth most capped player for the club, behind Stuart Taylor, Harry Bamford, Jack Pitt, and Geoff Bradford. His 85 goals in the Football League make him The Pirates' 9th-highest goalscorer. After ending his professional career with Rovers, he dropped out of the Football League to join Salisbury in 1962 and in 1963 had a short spell with Cornish side Falmouth Town in the South Western League. Family life Petherbridge married Rita Walker in 1950, and the couple had three children and eleven grandchildren. Following his retirement from football he worked as a publican, running The Angel in Sherston, and later The Tamar in Cornwall. He also worked as a PE teacher and groundsman at Millfield School and Wells Cathedral School respectively. Petherbridge Way in Bristol is named after Petherbridge. The road lies midway between Bristol Rovers' former home at Eastville Stadium and their current ground, the Memorial Stadium. He died on 4 March 2013, at the age of 85.

Articles 2 to 9 treat of liberty and equality and define these two terms. Articles 10 to 22 treat of safety and property. Article 23 declares a right to elementary instruction. Article 24 treat of public relief. Articles 25 to 30 treat of social security. Articles 31 and 32 treat of resistance to oppression. Article 33, the last one, declares the right of the people to review, reform and modify the constitution.  Constitution  Draft Constitution of 1793 = Territory = The territory of the French Republic keeps the preexisting 85 departments. The departments themselves are divided into large communes, which are in turn divided into municipal sections and primary assemblies. = Citizenship = The quality of citizen is granted to men 21 years old and older, following an uninterrupted residence of one year on French soil, counting from the day of their inscription on the civic table of a primary assembly. All public offices are open to citizens aged 25 years old and older. In addition to the right to vote, citizens enjoy the right to petition, and the right to censure acts emanating from their representatives. = Administration = Each department is managed by an administrative council of 18 members, of which two form the directoire. The communes are led by a municipality administration made up of 12 members and a mayor, who chairs the administration. Communes including more than one section contain agencies subordinated to the municipality. Half of the members of the departments' administrative bodies are renewed every two years, three months after the date of the legislative elections. The mode of the municipal elections is not a constitutional law. = Electoral system = The citizens exert their right to vote in primary assemblies including between 450 and 900 members. Each primary assembly elects a bureau responsible for the citizenship registry, for summoning primary assemblies when the constitution prescribes it, and for examining ballot papers. The elections comprise two polls: a first one used to prepare the list of candidates being presented, and a second one used for the election of the candidates on the list drawn up by the first election. At the time of the first poll, voters receive from the bureau a ballot paper showing their name. On it they write (or have someone write for them in case of illiteracy) as many names as there are offices to elect, and drop their bulletin at the office. The list of presentation is formed from the names that received the most votes, and their number is triple that of the offices needing to be renewed. An equal number of substitutes is added from among those who obtained the most votes after the candidates. The candidates and substitutes have 15 days to desist, after which the list, sorted by the number of votes and without the remaining substitutes, becomes final. At the time of the second poll, the voters receive a bulletin with two columns, one named \\"First Column of Election\\", the other \\"Additional Column\\", each one being divided into as many boxes as there are candidates to elect. If a candidate receives a majority of the votes on the first column, he is immediately elected. If not, the votes of the two columns are added and those who obtain the majority in this way are elected. The others are elected by a plurality of the votes if not all offices have already been filled. = Executive = The executive would be made up of a council of eight members: seven ministers and a secretary. Legislation, war, foreign affairs, the navy, and public contributions would each have their own minister. A sixth minister would be responsible for agriculture, trade and manufactures and a seventh for aids, works, public buildings, and the arts. The presidency of the council would pass from one minister to another every fifteen days. The council would be renewed by half every year and its members were to be elected for two years. Each member of the council was to be elected by a separate poll. The legislative body would have been able to put the members of the council on trial. Three commissaries to the national treasury were to be elected for three years using the same electoral mode as that used to elect the members of the executive council. = Legislative = The legislative body was to be unicameral and renewed during elections held on the first Sunday of May of each year. There was to be one representative per fifty thousand souls and substitutes in equal numbers. The representatives who did not sit at the end of one month would be replaced by a substitute. The representatives would have exercised the functions of president and secretaries of the legislative assembly for one month maximum. The constitutional law would have provided for a distinction, using several examples, between the legislative acts that would be laws and those that would be decrees, and also describe in detail the law making process. A bureau of 13 representatives was to be formed each month to report on all bills and decrees. The members of the bureau would only have been allowed to be elected once during the same legislature. = Judicial = Civil and criminal justice are merged into a uniform code of law for the whole republic. There is at least one Justice of the Peace per commune, elected for one year and rendering justice without fees by conciliation of the parties. In each department there is a civil jury composed of a director, a public rapporteur, a national commissary, and juries. The civil-jury table for a department is made up twice a year by the election of one jury for every 100 citizens registered on the citizenship tables of the primary assemblies. In criminal affairs, capital punishment is abolished for private offences. All citizens have the right to be judged by a court made up of juries. The defendants go before a first jury responsible for declaring whether there are grounds for a lawsuit and if so, a second jury made of at least 12 jurors determines the verdict of the case. Judicial censors are elected every two years and are charged with breaking the rulings rendered by infringement of the law. A national jury renders verdicts on crimes of high treason determined by the penal code. = Military = Citizens in a position to bear arms constitute the military force of the Republic. The executive council appoints generals via commission, for the time of a campaign, and in the event of war only. Citizens of the communes appoint the commanders of the national guard. = Convention = The constitution may be modified by the national convention, convened by the legislative body every twenty years. The convention can also be proposed by any citizen or the legislative body if the majority of the citizens judges it to be necessary and approves of it by a vote in primary assemblies. The members of the legislature cannot be elected to the convention, which cannot sit more than one year. The constitution project must be accepted by the people. = Contributions = The people, by themselves or through their representatives, consent to public contributions, which are deliberated upon annually by the legislative body and cannot continue beyond one year without an explicit renewal. The share of the product of industry or work which each citizen needs to subsist is not taxable. Departments and communes can establish particular public contributions only with the authorization of the legislative body. The accounts of the expenditure are made public. = Foreign relations = The French Republic may make war by arms only \\"for the preservation of its liberty, the conservation of its territory and the defence of its allies\\". War can be decreed only by the legislative body, with the means of a signed poll, whose moment is fixed three days in advance and after \\"having heard the Executive Council on the state of the Republic\\".

In 1971 he was awarded the Blue Water Medal of the Cruising Club of America. He died of lung cancer. Biography =Early life= Hal Roth was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1927. He was an aviator during World War II and the Korean War. During the course of his lifetime, Roth was also an author, sailor, mountaineer, and photographer. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Journalism, and became a free-lance writer and photographer. =Marriage= In 1959, Roth met Margaret Hale-White from Oxford, England who was visiting a friend in San Francisco, California. Margaret was born in Bombay, India and was the daughter of an English engineer. According to Roth, she worked in Paris for six and a half years as a dual language secretary for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). They married in 1960. =Photography and journalism= Roth studied photography with Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. He was a member of the American Society of Magazine Photographers and worked from a base in Sausalito, California, producing imagery of life in the surrounding area of California during the late 1950s and into the late 1960s. Roth's free- lance works of note include magazine titles such as Colliers, Fortune, The Saturday Evening Post, and The New York Times. Themes of his work include: California landscapes and wildlife, San Francisco (including Fisherman's Wharf), Winter Olympics, Dr. Suess, and Native American wildland firefighters of the Southwest. Hal was also engaged in photographic study of human life as represented by his \\"Time and Place\\" album and his Chinatown exhibit. In 1964, the San Francisco Museum of Art exhibited 40 of Roth's black and white photographic images titled \\"The Faces of Chinatown.\\" Roth's first published book, Pathway in the Sky (1965) displays his passion for the John Muir Trail and the Sierra Mountains. The associated images of the John Muir Trail also reflect people enjoying the trail and document its use in the early 1960s. =Sailing and writing= Even though neither was a sailor, their friends shared a love of sailing and introduced them to the sport in 1962. The couple chartered a boat in the West Indies where they learned a great deal from the captain. Later, they chartered another boat in Greece, then took sailing lessons in Scotland. After purchasing a home in Sausalito in 1964, they took a trip (1966) north along the west coast and purchased a fiberglass Spencer 35, built in Vancouver, British Columbia and designed by John Brandlmayr in Seattle, Washington. They named her Whisper, and sailed her home to California. The Roths began sailing on their own in 1966 and completed several voyages in Whisper. Destinations included Japan, Aleutian Islands, Alaska, Canadian islands, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Cape Horn, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Mediterranean, and Canary Islands. The success of his first book, about the John Muir Trail in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, prompted him and his wife to try the precarious worlds of adventuring and writing. They quit their jobs, and began a 19-month voyage around the Pacific in a sloop. Their vast journey culminated in the publication of his first sailing book, Two on a Big Ocean. He and his wife, Margaret, subsequently made a life of sailing and writing about it, including sailing around South America and a circumnavigation via Panama, the Torres Strait, and Suez. In 1978, they relocated to Maine. The couple sold Whisper and purchased the American Flag (later renamed Sebago) and Roth then sailed solo in the Brin's or British Oxygen Company (BOC) Challenge Race of 1986-7. He completed the race 4th in his class of 14, taking 171 days. Chasing the Long Rainbow (1990) is his account of this BOC race. In 1990, he tried the race again in the same Santa Cruz 50 now named Sebago (his sponsor), but due to capsizing, the voyage took 211 days. Chasing the Wind (1994) is his account of the second race. In 1992, they sold Sebago, purchased a Pretorien 35, named her Whisper, and the couple spent two years together tracing Odysseus' voyage through the Mediterranean. We Followed Odysseus, How to Sail Around the World, and Handling Storms at Sea represent books that he wrote based on the couple's final unique voyages. Roth published hundreds of articles in his lifetime. Although, his book publications appear to be his dominate body of work and document the couple's voyages and growing knowledge of sailing. The 1972 account of their first circumnavigation of the Pacific Basin (1967-8) resulted in the publication Two on a Big Ocean. The Blue Water Medal of the Cruising Club of America was awarded to the Hal Roth, and Margaret was noted as the sole crew, for this voyage. After 50,000 Miles (1977) describes technical aspects of sailing. The 1978 book Two against Cape Horn describes their journey from California to Maine via Cape Horn. Always a Distant Anchorage (1988) describes their four-year (1981‚Äì1985) circumnavigation west through the Panama Canal, Torres Strait, the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal. =Death and afterward= Roth recorded reminisces and continued to draft manuscripts throughout his life. His last two works, The Paradise Book and Graf Spee were completed but never published. He worked on these manuscripts during his later years and during his two and half year battle with lung cancer. He died October 18, 2008, while living in Maryland with his wife, Margaret, who survives him. Honours, decorations, awards and distinctions In 1971 Roth was awarded the Blue Water Medal of the Cruising Club of America in recognition of a cruise of around the Pacific Basin, with his wife as crew aboard their sloop, Whisper.

The revised specification was for an aircraft with twice the range and 1 1/2 times the bomb load, with a prototype ready to be submitted for state acceptance trials in July 1952. The Ilyushin design bureau set about designing two versions of the same aircraft, the straight-wing (Il-46) and the swept-wing (Il-46S), with as much as possible common to both aircraft. To meet the schedule for state acceptance trials Ilyushin built only the straight-wing version, fearing that the design, manufacture and flying characteristics of the swept-wing aircraft might cause delays. Design and development The airframe, constructed of aluminium alloy with steel used in highly stressed parts, resembled a large Il-28, the long fuselage having swept tail surfaces, and a similar arrangement of cockpits for the crew of pilot, navigator and rear gunner. The wing, which had moderate taper but straight leading edges, copied the layout of the Il-28, being mounted in the shoulder position at the midpoint of the fuselage. The flying controls consisted of the usual ailerons, elevators and rudder, all fitted with trim tabs for reducing loads on the pilots controls during flight in steady states, as well as \\"reversible\\" hydraulically-powered actuators. Two Lyul'ka AL-5 engines were fitted in long nacelles forward of the wings, exhausting through long jetpipes at the rear of the nacelles, aft of the wing trailing edge. The engines were mounted in this fashion to make room for the retracted main undercarriage legs, two on each side attached to the engine nacelles under the wings. The paired main undercarriage legs, side by side, retracted in opposite directions, inboard forwards and outboard rearwards, with the single mainwheels rotating 90 degrees to lie flat under the long jetpipes of the AL-5 engines. To boost takeoff performance, two JATO bottles could be attached to the rear fuselage. Performance was also improved when Lyulka AL-5F (forseerovannyy - afterburning) engines were fitted. Flight tests and state acceptance trials were successful, with the Il-46 meeting all requirements. Production was not ordered because the Tupolev Tu-88 proved to have better performance, and was ordered into production as the Tu-16. The Il-46S swept-wing version was designed concurrently, but construction was not started, to ensure that resources were not diverted from the Il-46.

Based on a screenplay by John Carlen, the film marked the directorial debut of Nicolas Cage, who makes a cameo appearance. It was co-produced by Cage's production company Saturn Films. Plot Sonny (Franco) is the son of Jewel (Blethyn) who runs a small brothel in New Orleans, Louisiana. Sonny returns home from the army, staying with his mother while waiting to start the job an army buddy of his promised him. Jewel tries to convince Sonny to come back to working for her as he had before the army, saying many of his old clients still miss him and he was the best gigolo she had ever had. Sonny repeatedly turns her down, wanting to leave that life behind. However, the job he was promised never materializes and he is forced to return to working for his mother. Jewel had recently recruited a new girl to the brothel, Carol (Suvari), who meets Sonny and falls in love with him. They talk of getting out together. One of Carol's clients, an older man, proposes to her. She initially declines, hoping to go away with Sonny. She and Sonny fall out as he fails to make an effort to get out of the business, instead becoming increasingly introverted and depressed, with occasional outbursts as he looks for more work. Ultimately, Carol accepts the marriage proposal.

King. Steven Seagal plays Detective Jacob King, a tough cop with a reputation for violent street-justice methods. King investigates murders in Memphis, Tennessee, perpetrated by a serial killer known as Lazerus. The film is also notable for featuring one of the last roles of Isaac Hayes. Plot Steven Seagal stars as a tough cop, Jacob King, whose brutal methods have gained him a legendary reputation among his colleagues. Seemingly indifferent to the fact his twin brother was murdered in front of him as a child, King investigates a series of brutal killings, most involving young, attractive women. The murderer, Lazerus, played by Michael Filipowich, leaves cryptic, astrological clues at the crime scenes. At the same time, another murderer, Billy Joe Hill (Mark Collie), is killing women. King finds him and kicks him out a window, after which Hill seeks revenge by murdering Celine (Karyn Michelle Baltzer), whom he believes to be King's girlfriend. King goes on a brutal rampage through the Memphis underworld with the assistance of his partner, Detective Storm Anderson (Chris Thomas King) and the coroner (Isaac Hayes). King meets FBI agent Frankie Miller (Holly Dignard) but dislikes her because she doesn't approve of his methods. Lazerus attempts to frame King for the murder of a blonde barmaid, and Miller believes the frame and begins to pursue King. Meanwhile, King locates Lazerus and fights him, using a ball-peen hammer to break every bone in his body. He then goes after Billy Joe Hill and kills him after finding Celine dead. King then chooses to exit the scene, leaving Anderson a note explaining he's quitting because no one likes his style of justice. The final scene shows King returning to what appears to be his Russian wife and family.

Early history Francis Tukey was born in Falmouth, Maine in 1814. His family was well established in the area of Falmouth. His father was Benjamin Tukey, as was also the name of his grandfather. His grandfather fought in the Battle of Saratoga during the American Revolution. Upon the town's celebration of the surrender of General Burgoyne, the elder Benjamin Tukey was killed accidentally. As the celebration had commenced around Alice Greele's Tavern, Benjamin was mortally wounded by the premature discharge of a cannon. Benjamin Tukey left behind two children: Benjamin, Francis's father, and William. Francis Tukey is described as \\"5 feet, 9 inches tall, hair black as a raven, eyes large, dark and piercing with a pale face and an infectious smile.\\"(Bungay). Francis Tukey was a mechanic by trade and left Falmouth for Boston, Massachusetts to practice his trade further. After moving to Boston, he decided that he would pursue a career in law instead. Tukey entered the Harvard Law School and graduated after two years in 1843. Francis Tukey was admitted to the Suffolk bar on March 6, 1844. Entering the law enforcement profession would be Tukey's calling and he would become appointed as the City Marshal of Boston by Mayor Josiah Quincy Jr. The position had been more of a revolving political door at the time. During the eight years between 1838 and 1846, there were six men appointed to the seat of city marshal. Francis Tukey was the successor to an office held by Benjamin Pollard, Daniel Parkman, Erza Weston, James Blake and Ira Gibbs. Tukey was appointed to the high-profile position at age 32. Tukey era as City Marshal of Boston The early years of Tukey's era as marshal was relatively quiet compared to what he would encounter close to the end of the decade. He began with the reorganization of the Boston Police Department. Under Tukey, the force increased to 22 officers during the day and 8 at night. They were dispatched throughout the city at $2.00 per day and $1.25 per night. The city was divided into sections and the order was set to clean up the streets of Boston. The increased visibility of officers gave rise to local notoriety to certain constables, such as Derastus Clapp and Samuel Fuller.Amory 219; Athens; Clapp 81; Dempewolff 252; Lane 62 During the 1848 public excavation on Boston Common, Tukey and his people discovered stolen money in front of an eager crowd. The January 7 excavation found $1100.00. This was the beginning of his public image in Boston and he welcomed the publicity. He was in charge of the investigation of the Parkman- Webster murder in 184950. In 1851, he returned runaway slave Thomas Sims to Georgia after a court ordered compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law. Shortly thereafter, Tukey began using raids to clean up the city. Tukey had an eye on vice establishments in the city. The early results of the first raid concluded that nine men and sixty women were arrested for prostitution. The following week's raid is known as the \\"Celebrated Ann Street\\" raid. There were over 150 arrests made in the red-light district of Boston on 23 April 1851. The targets were gamblers and prostitutes, with Tukey finding great success. Again in 1851, Francis Tukey instituted a weekly \\"show-up of rogues.(Friedman)\\" The policy he established was to have known criminals show up and be identified in public as criminals. This was to make sure that the public knew their faces and could identify the criminals if they had to. The first collection brought 76 pickpockets, burglars, thieves and more that were forced to \\"run a gauntlet of crowing citizens who tore their clothing and marked their backs with chalk.\\" The results of Francis Tukey's time as city marshal are varied. During Tukey's reign, it is believed that he neglected the growing number of wandering children in the Boston streets. The children, if taken in, would become apprentices or domestics until they reached adulthood. This was a rather \\"unenlightened attitude toward juvenile delinquency(Lane)\\" in Boston at the time. Francis Tukey would be the city marshal until 1852, a tenure lasting six years. Benjamin Seaver, the mayor, removed Francis Tukey and most of the Boston Police force and replaced him with Gilbert Nourse Esq (1852‚Äì1854). The resignation was forced. Upon his removal, Tukey decided to relocate to Sacramento, California. Move to California Francis Tukey's decision to leave Boston for Sacramento was not an attempt to leave the public realm behind. Here he became a member of the California State Assembly, with a seat in the 16th District legislature beginning in 1863 and also a member of the Board of Levee. During his time on the Board of Levee, he helped decide the length of term and the process for the election of Levee officials. His time in California did encounter other notoriety as he came in front of the Supreme Court of California as an appeal was filed from a verdict rendered against him by the Sixth Judicial District of California. In this appeal, investment in property bought by another man, D. O. Mills, where Tukey was also an investor came before the court. The issue at hand was that Tukey was an investor on real estate property of lot 4 between J and K streets and Fourth and Fifth streets in Sacramento. The third that was in the possession of Judson and George B. Haycock was sold to Mills. During which time, the taxes had not been paid on the property. The sheriff in Sacramento was deeded to sell the property to recoup the money owed. Tukey, in having failed to pay the taxes, forced the property to be sold and left a loan of $4000.00 to Mill's debt. The selling of the property was eventually allowed, having the courts agreed to the original decision that the sheriff did have the right to sell the property to reclaim debts and the owner was now, in fact, D. O. Mills. Legacy Francis Tukey \\"demonstrated the police as a constant, serious, full-time presence into the social spaces of (Boston).\\" He patrolled the streets of Boston with the great efficiency. According to Tukey, \\"there were 227 houses of prostitution known in Boston, along with 26 gambling dens operating and 1500 shops selling liquor, of which 900 were run by Irishmen.(Bungay)\\" He was appointed by the Boston Brahmins to control the growing population of immigrants, especially the Irish who were typically used as scapegoats of the time. Tukey increased the police force and increased the operating budget each year. The police force was so well trained, that it could be brought into \\"service on any emergency, at short notice, with all the uniformity and efficiency of a disciplined army.\\" Tukey helped clean the streets in an obviously busy time for Boston. \\"It may be a question whether Francis Tukey is to the municipality what Fouche\` was to the court of Napoleon.(Loring)\\" He is considered to be the most efficient police officer ever in Boston. Francis Tukey \\"styled himself as Boston's own Eug√®ne Fran√ßois Vidocq, in regards to the vigilant detection of offenders(Roth)\\" by forcing criminals to parade in public and arresting groups of people during police raids. He is also considered by many to be the Napoleon of his time during his reign as city marshal. Death Francis Tukey died in Sacramento, California on November 23, 1868. His burial site is unknown.

Lohse was born in Z√ºrich in 1902. His wish to study in Paris was thwarted due to his difficult economic circumstances. In 1918, he joined the advertising agency Max Dalang, where he trained to become an advertising designer. Lohse, then an autodidact, painted expressive, late-cubist still lifes. In the 1930s, his work as a graphic artist and book designer placed him among the pioneers of modern Swiss graphic design; in paintings of this period, he worked on curved and diagonal constructions. Success eventually allowed him to establish his own graphic design studio in Z√ºrich. He combined art with a political and moral awareness, which led him to be an activist for immigrants. In the 1930s, he was actively involved in protests, which were illegal under the government of the time. He continued to protest until the beginning of World War II. In 1937, Lohse co-founded Allianz, an association of Swiss modern artists, with Leo Leuppi. In 1938, he helped Irmgard Burchard, to whom he was married for a brief time, to organise the London exhibition \\"Twentieth Century German Art\\". His political convictions then led him into the resistance movement, where he met his future wife Ida Alis D√ºrner. The year 1943 marked a breakthrough in Lohse's painting: he standardised the pictorial means and started to develop modular and serial systems. In 1953, he published the book New Design in Exhibitions, and from 1958, he became co-editor of the magazine Neue Grafik.Facsimile reprint Neue Grafik / New Graphic Design / Graphisme actuel 1958 ‚Äì 1965. Lohse's typical classic paintings are nonrepresentational, systematic, two-dimensional laminar planes of interacting colour elements in various logical/mathematical relations visible to the eye, using the structure of colour that we perceive, and in a way that every element plays an equal qualitative role.

Owner Kenny Dreer progressed from restoring and upgrading Norton Commandos to producing whole machines. He modernised the design and in the early 2000s went into production of the VR880. This machine was built on the basis of the original Commando, with upgraded components and a significantly modified engine. Dreer produced 50 of these machines before deciding to build an all-new motorcycle. With funding from Oliver Curme, Dreer hired a small design and development team led by Paul Gaudio (Design and Development Director), Simon-Pierre Smith (Lead Engineer), and Patrick Leyshock (Testing, Sourcing.) The 961 Commando never reached production in America due to lack of funding, and the company closed its doors in April 2006. The Commando 961 SS combined traditional Norton cafe racer styling with new technology. This included carbon fibre wheels to reduce weight, a counterbalanced engine, and a chro-moly tubular steel frame. Future After fifteen years of US ownership the Norton brand was secured by Stuart Garner, a UK businessman and owner of Norton Racing Ltd. Garner setup Norton production at the current Norton factory at Donington Park. The relaunched Norton line includes three new versions of the 961 Commando; the 961 SF, 961 Sport and 961 Caf√© Racer.

The Polish intelligence agency, the Polish Military Organization (PMO) was to carry out the coup d'etat, planned to be implemented in August 1919. The coup was designed to seem to be an initiative by local Lithuanians aiming to free their government of German influence. The PMO hoped to rely on the assistance of sympathetic Lithuanian activists. They were thwarted by the lack of cooperation and the unwillingness of sufficient number of Lithuanians to support the Polish cause. After the Sejny Uprising, a Polish revolt against the Lithuanian authorities in one of the disputed border regions, Lithuanian intelligence intensified its investigation of the Polish minority and sympathizers in Lithuania, and uncovered the planned coup. The Lithuanians, not knowing the membership of the PMO, arrested numerous Polish activists and destabilized the PMO network enough to prevent the coup attempt. Later the full membership list was obtained and the PMO in Lithuania was dissolved. The coup further strained Polish‚ÄìLithuanian relations. Background J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski with Supreme Command of Polish Military Organisation in 1917 Lt. Adam Rudnicki, leader of the Sejny Uprising, and his colleagues. August 1919 Poland and Lithuania formed one state, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, from the Union of Lublin in 1569 to the Third Partition in 1795. Both Poland and Lithuania regained their independence in the aftermath of World War I, but both soon became engaged in territorial disputes over the Suwa≈Çki and Vilnius Regions. During the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, Poland launched an offensive against the Soviet Union and captured Vilnius (Wilno) during the Vilna offensive in April 1919. Lithuanians described Vilnius as their historical capital and an integral part of the ethnographic Lithuania, while to the Poles, because of its large Polish population, it was a Polish city. Poland's Chief of State J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski sought a union with Lithuania in hopes of reviving the old Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (see Miƒôdzymorze federation). The Lithuanians believed they would lose their sovereignty under the proposed federation and wanted their own national state. Although Polish‚ÄìLithuanian relations were not immediately hostile, they grew worse as each side refused to compromise. As tensions rose, Lithuania asked the Allied Supreme Council to intervene, and it proposed two demarcation lines to prevent open hostilities, drawn in June and July 1919 (the second one was known as the Foch Line). However, Poland ignored both lines and advanced deeper into the Lithuanian-controlled territory.Lesƒçius (2004), p. 254 Faced with pressure from the Entente, Polish Chief of State J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who was significantly involved in planning of the coup, did not want open Polish‚ÄìLithuanian hostilities, which could led to much bloodshed and even greater tensions between Poland and Lithuania. Instead, since he thought there were enough Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to stage a coup d'etat, he decided to plan one to topple the Lithuanian government. Preparations The planning began mid-July, 1919. At the time Poland signed a ceasefire in the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War; Lithuania was invaded by the Bermontians from the north and the Saxon Volunteers were leaving the Lithuanian Army. Pi≈Çsudski was planning to use a network of the Polish Military Organization (PMO), an underground organization he created during World War I for diversionary and intelligence operations-like purposes. On July 31, Pi≈Çsudski and Polish diplomat Leon Wasilewski arrived at Vilnius, then controlled by Poland. Pi≈Çsudski's visit had no clear explanation.Senn (1975), p. 167 He later said that he arrived to negotiate with Lithuanians, led by Augustinas Voldemaras,Senn (1975), pp. 167‚Äì168 while Lithuanian historian Vytautas Lesƒçius suggests he was holding talks with pro-Polish estate owners from the Vilnius Region.Lesƒçius (2004), p. 261 On August 3, Wasilewski arrived at Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania, to negotiate with Prime Minister Mykolas Sle≈æeviƒçius. The Polish mission declared that Poland had no plans to annex Lithuania and proposed a plebiscite in the contested territories, allowing local inhabitants to determine their future. The Lithuanians replied that the disputed territories were an integral part of Lithuania and rejected the idea of a plebiscite.≈Åossowski (1995), pp. 56‚Äì57 Negotiations broke down and Wasilewski left Kaunas on August 7. The negotiations were then used to evaluate viability of the coup, the preparedness of the PMO, and the attitude of Lithuanian diplomats towards a union with Poland.Lesƒçius (2004), pp. 261‚Äì262Senn (1966), p. 20 After the failure Wasilewski's diplomatic mission, Polish newspapers increased their anti-Lithuanian propaganda.Senn (1975), p. 147 They said that the Council of Lithuania was a pro-German puppet, ignoring popular wishes for a union with Poland as such union would break German influence in the state.Senn (1975), p. 148 The Polish media further reported on growing anti-government sentiment among the Lithuanians. This information was in line with the Polish plans to present the coup as an initiative by the local population to free Lithuania from German domination. While the plotters counted on military intervention by regular Polish troops,Lesƒçius (2004), pp. 261, 266, 269 the Polish government maintained it had not inspired the coup.Senn (1975), p. 149 The official goal of the Polish plan was to \\"1) create an independent Lithuania, powerful, truly democratic, connected voluntarily with Poland in a union, with as much internal autonomy as possible and 2) acceptance of the Polish minority in Lithuania as a partner in the Lithuanian government and recognition of the Polish language as equal to the Lithuanian language in Lithuania.\\"≈Åossowski (1995), p. 65 The PMO recruited Lithuanian activists Stanis≈Çaw Narutowicz, Juozas Gabrys, Jurgis Auk≈°tuolaitis, and Klemensas Vaitiek≈´nas.≈Åossowski (1995), pp. 60‚Äì61, 64 On August 20‚Äì22, 1919, Wasilewski and Tadeusz Kasprzycki together with Narutowicz and Auk≈°tuolaitis planned out the coup details.Lesƒçius (2004), p. 265 During the coup, scheduled for the night from August 28 to 29, the rebels were to capture Kaunas and hold it until the arrival of the Polish regular units invited to protect the city. The Council of Lithuania and the Lithuanian government was to be deposed and replaced by a pro-Polish cabinet. General Silvestras ≈Ωukauskas was to be installed as a military dictator of the new Lithuanian government, with Auk≈°tuolaitis as his second-in-command and Narutowicz as the head of the civilian government.≈Åossowski (1995), p. 64 General ≈Ωukauskas, then chief commander of the Lithuanian forces, was not aware of the coup, but was known for his generally friendly attitude towards Poland and was expected to support the aftermath.≈Åossowski (1995), p. 61 Other posts were reserved for Mykolas Bir≈æi≈°ka, Jonas Vilei≈°is, Steponas Kairys, Juozas T≈´belis and others, similarly unaware of the coup. Auk≈°tuolaitis was given 800,000 and promised another 300,000 German marks to finance the coup.Lesƒçius (2004), p. 266 Coup discovered Map of demarcation lines of June 18 (light green) and July 26 (dark green) of 1919 between Poland and Lithuania. Poland ignored both lines and continued to advance up to the light orange line. Eventually, the uprising was doomed by poor communication and the overeagerness of some of the PMO activists. Pi≈Çsudski failed to discourage local PMO activists from carrying out the Sejny Uprising in the Suwa≈Çki Region. The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched the uprising, which while locally successful, led to the failure of the nationwide coup. PMO members in Lithuania stated that the Sejny uprising had damaged their reputation, and many of its former supporters rejected calls by PMO recruiters.Lesƒçius (2004), p. 259‚Äì278 The initial coup was postponed to September 1, 1919. However, some PMO units began their actions (cutting telegraph wires, damaging railways, etc.) as scheduled previously ‚Äì on the night of August 27 to 28.Lesƒçius (2004), p. 267 The Lithuanian intelligence intercepted and decoded the order to delay the coup. They had known before that Poles were plotting, but did not know who and when. The Lithuanian government was informed about the cut telegraph wires and intercepted order in the morning of August 28. However, the government did not consider the threat real and did not take appropriate action.Lesƒçius (2004), p. 268 A group of 18 Lithuanian Army officers, with tacit approval from Sle≈æeviƒçius, took the initiative. Afraid that PMO members infiltrated the military, they secretly decided to begin mass arrests of Polish supporters on the night from August 28 to 29. Since they did not know who exactly was behind the conspiracy, the Lithuanians arrested more prominent Polish activists in Kaunas. Several dozen Poles were arrested the first night, including Auk≈°tuolaitis and 23 Polish officers serving in the Lithuanian Army. By the second night the number of arrested Poles grew to 200. Kaunas was declared under a state of siege. The Polish press noted mass arrests of Polish activists \\"to whom no charge can be ascribed other than being Poles\\" and concluded that this was proof of the systematic anti-Polish policies of the German-ridden Lithuanian government. Because the Lithuanians did not have a list of PMO members, they did not arrest the main leaders.Lesƒçius (2004), p. 269 Also, provincial PMO branches remained intact. Therefore, on September 17, 1919, new orders were issued scheduling the second coup attempt for the end of September. This attempt was also discovered. A Lithuanian woman succeeded in convincing Petras Vrubliauskas, PMO deputy commander in Vilnius, to transfer the PMO document archive to the Lithuanians. On September 21, the Lithuanians obtained a full list of PMO members and supporters and arrested them in the following days.Lesƒçius (2004), pp. 269‚Äì270 The PMO branch in Lithuania ceased to function and was liquidated. Aftermath and evaluation The Lithuanians charged 117 persons during a military trial on December 11‚Äì24, 1920. Six leaders received life sentences. Other sentences ranged from 15 years to 8 months in prison. At least 15 individuals were acquitted. By 1928 there were no PMO members in Lithuanian prisons: some were exchanged for Lithuanian prisoners or released early.Lesƒçius (2004), p. 270 General ≈Ωukauskas was removed from his post as the commander of the Lithuanian Army and had to battle the perceived friendliness to Poland for much of his further career.Senn (1966), p. 21 The Polish government initially denied that there was any coup; later it admitted that locals planned an uprising, but claimed it had no part in it. The coup further strained the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian relations, making Lithuanians even more uncompromising and afraid of Polish annexation.Senn (1966), pp. 21‚Äì22 The planned coup was criticized by historians as unrealistic for the following reasons. Pi≈Çsudski's plan was based on false assumptions and faulty intelligence, which incorrectly indicated that the Sle≈æeviƒçius government was deeply unpopular, and that the general Lithuanian population was relatively friendly to Poland.≈Åossowski (1995), pp. 58‚Äì59 No notable ethnic Lithuanian politicians declared support for the plan; the plan relied on support from General ≈Ωukauskas, but his support was never confirmed; Narutowicz, who was to head the civilian government, was a Pole; the PMO was weak and incapable of taking control if the coup met any significant resistance; and intervention of the Polish army would have led to bloodshed and undermined the idea of a voluntary union or alliance with Poland. The only group that supported the coup was the Polish minority in Lithuania, increasingly alienated by Lithuanian government policies.≈Åossowski (1995), pp. 62‚Äì63 However, according to the Lithuanian census of 1923, the minority constituted 3.2% of the population outside the Vilnius Region. On the ground, the uprising was doomed by poor communication and the overeagerness of some of the PMO activists.

The screenplay was co-written by Luc Besson. The film was released in the United States on February 5, 2010.  Plot  A personal aide to the U.S. ambassador in France, James Reese has an enviable life in Paris and a beautiful French girlfriend, but his real passion is his side job as a low-level operative for the CIA. Reese wants to become a higher level agent with more responsibilities. As the result of a shortage of agents in France, he is assigned as a partner to secret agent Charlie Wax. Reese's first test is to have Wax released from airport detention by the French Customs when Wax does not want to surrender the cans of his favorite energy drink. Despite the apparent triviality of an energy drink that Wax could probably purchase in Paris, Wax continues to verbally abuse French Customs until Reese places a Diplomatic Mail sticker on Wax's luggage containing the energy drink, which makes them immune from customs and quarantine requirements. Once in the car, Wax apologizes for his behavior while opening the tins and revealing the concealed pieces of his personal SIG Sauer P226 X-Five Lightweight, which he refers to as \\"Mrs. Jones\\". Wax explains that he has been sent to Paris to investigate a drug ring at least indirectly responsible for the death of a woman who happened to be the niece of the Secretary of Defense. During the investigation, which leads to a French-Chinese Triad run restaurant and eventually a Triad warehouse. Wax reveals that there was no overdose‚Äîtheir goal is to trace the money back to a circle of Pakistani terrorists. Evidence leads them to the terrorists, resulting in an armed confrontation in which most of the terrorists are killed. Wax and Reese learn that the terrorists plan to infiltrate the U.S. embassy with explosives hidden beneath their burkas. As they collect evidence, they find photographs of Agent Reese pinned to a wall. Ultimately, Reese learns that the terrorists are targeting a summit meeting. Wax discovers that Reese's fianc√©e Caroline is a \\"sleeper\\" agent who was assigned to infiltrate them. When confronted, Caroline shoots Reese in the shoulder and escapes through a window. A Volvo picks her up on the street below. Caroline attempts to detonate an explosive vest while the last remaining terrorist in the Volvo threatens a US motorcade traveling to the summit by speeding towards them, wired with explosives. Wax destroys the vehicle with an AT4 rocket launcher just in time. Reese finds Caroline at the summit and attempts to dissuade her from carrying out her mission by professing his love. She attempts to detonate her vest anyway and Reese is ultimately forced to kill her. As the U.S. official from the motorcade arrives at the summit, she berates Reese for inconveniencing her, and Wax reminds Reese of the often ungrateful and ignorant people they protect. As Wax leaves Paris, Reese escorts him to his plane. Wax offers a full-time partnership. The two play a game of chess on the tarmac, placing their handguns on a utility cart, Reese revealing that he is now carrying a Desert Eagle pistol, and Wax welcomes him to the club as his partner.

He first invented the removable cleat, and then went on to invent the first ever plastic suspension helmet in 1939. In 2008, Dan Arment was appointed president of Riddell.

Products  Riddell is widely known for its line of football helmets. In 2002, Riddell released a new helmet design called the Revolution or \\"Revo\\" for shortRiddell Revolution: product details on Riddell website The newer design was released in response to a study on concussions. The design became popular in the NFL and NCAA, being used by notables such as Peyton Manning, Dwight Freeney, Casey Hampton, and Brady Quinn, as well as having been used by Eli Manning during the 2005 season. Riddell is also known for its Revolution IQ HITS helmet (Head Impact Telemetry System). The sensors inside the helmet called MX Encoders store data from each impact and can be transferred to a laptop to be reviewed by coaching staff or physicians. The helmets cost about $999 and are already being used by NCAA football teams.Riddell starts shipping concussion- monitoring football helmets Other helmet styles produced by Riddell include the Revolution Speed and the Revolution IQ. The company also produces a youth line of helmets including the Revolution Speed Youth, Revolution IQ Youth, Revolution Youth, Revolution Little Pro, Attack, VSR-4, VSR2-Y, and Little Pro.  Lawsuits  Riddell has been sued by multiple NFL players.Former Players Sue Football Helmet Manufacturer Riddell by Joseph Hanna, 8 Nov 2018Ex-NFL Players Sue Helmet Maker Riddell, Claim Company Knew About Concussion Risks by Yesha Callahan, 16 Feb 2016 More than 125 former NFL players sued the league and helmet-maker Riddell for not disclosing and, in some instances, allegedly hiding the risks of repeated head injuries. There are \\"at least three\\" personal injury cases pending in California and one more in Pennsylvania. According to the AP, the cases represent the \\"first examples of former players joining together to file concussion-related lawsuits against the NFL.\\" Lawyer Thomas Girardi represents dozens of the players in two of the complaints. He says the goal is to enact \\"necessary changes\\" to protect future generations of players, as well as \\"set[ting] up a medical process so [the plaintiffs] can have medical attention for this injury as long as they need it\\", in addition to financial compensation. The NFL alleged that players knew the risks when they made football their career and that there was \\"no misconduct or liability\\" on the league's part.NFL Unveils Scary New Concussion Poster by Ray Gustini, 27 Jul 2010 Players intended to show there was \\"a history of literature showing that multiple blows to the head can cause long- term damage\\" that got buried by the NFL and that the league also \\"fraudulently concealed the long-term effects of concussions,\\" including the increased risk of dementia. The players appeared to have allies in Washington. A Senate subcommittee held hearings on misleading safety claims made by sports equipment companies. One thing is certain: it's going to be a long slog for both sides, without a clear endgame. For example, the players are seeking judgments \\"in the millions of dollars,\\" though no specific numbers have been listed in the court documents. The consensus from lawyers on both sides is that the lawsuits could take years to be sorted out. Nobody associated with the players, the league, or Riddell was even \\"willing to guess how long it could be\\" during discussions with the AP.

Swenson (February 24, 1816 ‚Äì June 13, 1896) was the founder of the SMS ranches in West Texas. It was through his efforts that Swedish immigration to Texas was begun in 1848.Family History Research (Genealogy News) In 1972, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Biography Svante Magnus Svenson was born at Alarp, Barkeryds Parish, J√∂nk√∂ping County, Sweden. He migrated to America in 1836, where he worked in New York City before traveling to Baltimore, Maryland,Swante Palm papers U Tx Austin and then to Galveston. In 1850 Swenson moved to Austin and established a mercantile business with his uncle Swante Palm. While running the business, Swenson continued to buy Texas Railroad Certificates and to acquire land. Swenson arranged passage for Swedish families principally from Sm√•land, who in turn worked for Swenson to pay off the price of the ticket. Most of the early immigrants also bought land from Swenson.Swenson, Swante Magnus,1816‚Äì1896 (Handbook of Texas) Swenson began shipments of the Texas pecan to the North and East; and in 1850 established himself in the general merchandise and banking business at Austin. In Austin, Swenson also served two terms (in 1852 and 1856) as a Travis County commissioner and in 1853 became the first treasurer of the State Agricultural Society. In 1854 he invested in the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway, which gained him acres of land in northwestern and western Texas. Swenson's greatest interest lay in the accumulation of land. He traded many of the manifold supplies carried by his large frontier trading post for Texas railroad land certificates. Under the privilege then accorded to holders and owners of such certificates to file on any untaken state land, Swenson in 1854 began acquiring acreage of unclaimed properties in Northwest Texas. By 1860 he owned over 128,000 acres around Austin, in addition to his West Texas holdings, which had increased to nearly 500,000 acres.The SMS Ranches (The Handbook of Texas) SMS Ranches eventually became one of the largest landowners in Texas. Swenson leased his ranch holdings to his sons, who operated the ranches under the name of Swenson Brothers Cattle Company from headquarters in Stamford, Texas.Swenson Ranch Commissary ‚Äì Stamford, Jones County, Texas (Texas Historic Landmark)Recognize the Centennial of Stamford, Texas (Congressional Record, Volume 146. 2000, Part 9) Swenson established the banking house of S. M. Swenson and Sons in New York City. Though he lived in New York, he maintained his ties to Texas, operating a clearinghouse for Texas products, continuing his work as a cotton agent, and regularly visiting his extensive land holdings. Swenson died in Brooklyn, New York, and was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York).Swedes In Texas (Williamson County Historical Museum) On September 3, 1850, Swante Magnus Swenson purchased a city lot in Austin. In 1854, he built the Swenson Building on Congress Avenue where the current Piedmont Hotel stands today. Inside the building, on the first floor, were a drug store, a general goods store, a hardware store, and a grocery store; a hotel, (named the Avenue Hotel but locally known as the Stringer‚Äôs Hotel) was located on the upper two levels of the building. The Travis County Deeds Records show that sometime later, Swenson leased the hotel to a John Stringer, giving the hotel its name ‚Äúthe Stringer‚Äôs Hotel.‚Äù An 1885 Austin city Sanborn map of the Swenson Building shows that Swenson had a room built for ‚Äúservants‚Äù in the hotel portion of the building. There is no documentation detailing whether enslaved people stayed in that room since the Sanborn map is dated twenty years after the Civil War. S. M Swenson was born in Sweden and came to New York as an immigrant in 1836 at the age of twenty. A few years after his arrival, Swenson worked as a mercantile trader. Through his trade dealings in the south, he befriended a slaveholder by the name of George Long, who then hired Swenson to work at his newly relocated plantation in Texas. A year later, when Long died due to poor health, Swenson married his widow, who then too died of tuberculosis three years later. By 1843, Swenson became a full-scale slaveholder in Texas through inheriting his now-deceased wife‚Äôs plantation. In 1848, he enlarged his property holdings by purchasing the adjoining plantation and expanding his cotton crop. In 1850, along with purchasing 182 acres a few miles outside of Austin, he bought the lot on Congress Avenue and constructed the Swenson Building and inside, the Stringer‚Äôs Hotel. There are no records that detail the lives of enslaved people at the Stringer‚Äôs Hotel but other sources show that slaveholders expected slaves to fill a variety of roles in running their establishments on Congress Avenue. In his book, a Journey Through Texas, Frederick Olmstead describes his encounter with an enslaved woman who was responsible for tending to the hotel‚Äôs patrons along with upkeep and building maintenance. This encounter was not at the Stringer Hotel, though, and has no real bearing on Swenson, who had divested his short-term slave interest years earlier. At other establishments, slaves were also responsible for running errands and transporting goods. Many slaves also lived and traveled to and from homes and communities that formed on the outskirts of town. Traveling to and from their labor obligations or social engagements in their free time illuminates the various networks of movement created by the enslaved. Hence, given their relative independence, expectations, and responsibilities, it is not impossible to imagine enslaved people taking on leading roles in running hotels other than Stringer's and other establishments in Austin. According to the Texas State Historical Association Handbook of Texas, during the secession crisis, Swenson, who opposed both northern and southern radicalism, agreed to help Governor Sam Houston in an attempt to prevent Texas secession; Swenson was to raise supplies for an independent Texas army and in 1861 was promised a commission as quartermaster-general on Houston's staff, a position with the rank of colonel. When the effort failed, Swenson, who by this time had sold all his slaves, remained in Texas but vowed that he would not aid the South and that he would never take up arms against the United States.

Initially the death of 8 Iranian diplomats was reported, but later two other diplomats and a journalist were also confirmed dead, bringing the total deaths to 11. The killings of the diplomats is speculated to have been carried out by Sipah- e-Sahaba Pakistan. Background Before this incident, Iran was supportive of the Afghan Northern Alliance, and the city of Mazari Sharif was one of the headquarters of the alliance. It is reported that between May and July 1997 Abdul Malik Pahlawan executed thousands of Taliban prisoners as a revenge for the 1995 death of Abdul Ali Mazari. \\"He is widely believed to have been responsible for the brutal massacre of up to 3,000 Taliban prisoners after inviting them into Mazar-i-Sharif.\\" As revenge, Taliban forces captured Mazar- i-Sharif and killed hundreds of Northern Alliance members, particularly members of the Hazara and Uzbek ethnic group as they were accused of being the ones who carried out the killings of Taliban prisoners. Events On August 8, 1998, Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif. After this incident, 11 Iranian diplomats and a correspondent from Iran's state news agency (IRNA) were attacked at the Iranian consulate and subsequently disappeared. Unofficial reports from the city indicated that all these men were killed. Later it was confirmed that 8 of the Iranian diplomats and the IRNA correspondent were killed by the Taliban militia attacking the consulate. The Taliban spokesmen said the Iranians had been killed by renegade forces who had acted without orders. The final death toll was confirmed later to be 11 according to Tehran Times. Aftermath This incident caused a public furor in Iran and many observers were worried Iran would be involved in a military response to the attack. At the time, more than 70,000 Iranian troops were deployed along the Afghan border. Mediation by the United Nations defused the situation and all the hostages were eventually released. Later in February 1999, Iran and Taliban held talks, but Iranian-Taliban relations did not improve. August 8 is named National Journalists' Day in Iran, in memory of Mahmoud Saremi, the IRNA correspondent killed in this attack. Film An Iranian film Mazar Sharif was made on this story in 2015. Abdolhassan Barzideh was the director.

The law allows workers to elect representatives (usually trade union representatives) for almost half of the supervisory board of directors. The legislation is separate from the main German company law Act for public companies, the Aktiengesetz. It applies to public and private companies, so long as there are over 2,000 employees. For companies with 500‚Äì2,000 employees, one third of the supervisory board must be elected. There is also legislation in Germany, known as the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz, whereby workers are entitled to form Works Councils at local shop floor level. Goals of codetermination Views differ on the goals of codetermination in general. Some social reformers maintain that workers are not merely factory parts, but citizens with equal rights. The Prussian state aimed for a conciliatory policy between capital and labour, and worker committees were one way to involve and bind workers into a system, and avoid conflict. In return unions conceded objectives on the establishment of a socialist state. Codetermination aims principally to give workers a voice in the company decisions. This means matters on organisation of the business, the conditions of work and the management of personal and economic decisions affecting the future of the company and jobs. Workers therefore choose Works council representatives and members of the board to represent them. =Interests of workers= On the assumption that the primary goal of employers is to maximize profits in the interests of shareholders, codetermination can reorient the company's goals in the interests of workers. A better balance may be struck so that the company interests are not so one sided. For unions, codetermination is part of democratizing the economy. It is also a way for workers to better the terms and conditions of their contracts in an orderly and regulated way. =Interests of employers= Much economic discussion mentions the thesis that employers also have an interest in codetermination. It can be an instrument for long term increase in productivity of the company. Some economists dispute this on the basis that the losses in efficiency in production outweigh any gains in productivity.Andrea Kuffner: Die Beteiligung der Arbeitnehmer in der Europ√§ischen Aktiengesellschaft, Wiku-Verlag, 2003, S.6 Types of codetermination Three forms of codetermination are distinguished, =Codetermination in job places= According to the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz (BetrVG, Industrial Relations Law) the worker has a claim to codetermination about his own work position. He has to be informed about his position and responsibilities, and the job procedures (see also, the Arbeitsschutzgesetz). He has a right of making suggestions and to inspect certain company documents. =Operational codetermination= Operational codetermination (Betriebliche Mitbestimmung) concerns the organisation of the business, job arrangements, personal planning, guidelines for hiring, social services, time registration and performance assessments. This is found in the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz (BetrVG, Industrial Relations Law). The Betriebsrat or works council is the organ of operational codetermination. In the public sector it is known as the Personalrat (or staff council). =Corporate codetermination= Corporate codetermination (Unternehmensmitbestimmung) concerns private (GmbH) and public limited companies (AktG). The Drittelbeteiligungsgesetz provides for one third of the supervisory board to be elected by workers in companies with more than 500 employees. For companies with more than 2000 employees the Mitbestimmungsgesetz requires half of the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) to be representative of the workers (subject to the chairman of the board being a shareholder appointee). In the coal, mining and steel industry the Montan- Mitbestimmungsgesetz allows complete parity between workers and shareholders for companies with over 1000 workers. In December 2005 there were 729 companies with supervisory boards regulated by the Mitbestimmungsgesetz and around 30 under the Montanmitbestimmungsgesetz. Historical development * 1848 The Frankfurt Parliament processed a minority proposal for industry organisation that included boundaries for corporate power by setting up works councils. * 1850 The first workers' committees were established in four printing houses in Eilenburg, Saxony. * 1891 After the repeal of the Sozialistengesetz workers' committees could be founded freely. However, this happened only where there were active unions. * 1905 In reaction to a strike in the Ruhr coalmines, the Prussian Berggesetz introduced workers' committees in mining companies with more than 100 workers. * 1916 The Auxiliary Services Act (1916) (Gesetz des Vaterl√§ndischen Hilfsdiensts) created workers' committees for all companies producing for the war effort with more than 50 workers. These committees had the right to be consulted in social affairs. * 1920 The Betriebsr√§tegesetz (Works Council Act) mandated consultative bodies for workers in businesses with more than 20 employees. The social and economic interests of workers were to be represented and considered to the management. * 1934 After the Nazis seized power, works councils were abolished and unions were broken up. * 1946/47 The Allied Control Council, through the Kontrollratsgesetz No. 22, allowed works councils as in the Weimar Republic. * 1951 The Montan-Mitbestimmungsgesetz (Coal, Steel and Mining Codetermination Law) required codetermination in businesses with more than 1,000 employees through workers' representatives making up one half of the supervisory boards. * 1952 The Betriebsverfassungsgesetz mandated participation of workers at shopfloor level through works councils. * 1955 The Bundespersonalvertretungsgesetz allowed codetermination among members of the civil services in the Federation and the German states. * 1972 The Betriebsverfassungsgesetz was updated and reissued. * 1976 The Mitbestimmungsgesetz required codetermination in all companies with more than 2,000 employees. Codetermination laws =Coal and Steel Codetermination Act of 1951= After threats of massive strikes by unions the Gesetz √ºber die Mitbestimmung der Arbeitnehmer in den Aufsichtsr√§ten und Vorst√§nden der Unternehmen des Bergbaus und der Eisen- und Stahlerzeugenden Industrie vom 21. Mai 1951 was passed on 7 June 1951. It provided for equal representation on the supervisory board of directors for workers and employers. On the worker side, representatives are to name a \\"further member\\" who acts explicitly in the interests of the community. The purpose was that in the lead up to World War, these companies were seen to openly support the Nazis financially. To prevent a stalemate on the board, a neutral member is to be appointed, which the parties must agree on. On the management board, one member must be a Staff-director (Arbeitsdirecktor) who cannot be appointed against the votes of the worker directors on the supervisory board. Companies attempted to avoid the effects of the law after it was passed. The steel company Mannesmann registered another holding company outside the steel industry, intended to avoid the law. In response the Mitbestimmungserg√§nzungsgesetz (the Codetermination Supplementary Act, known as \\"Lex Mannesmann\\") was passed to prevent the practice. =Works Councils Act of 1952= Passed on the 11 October 1952, this law introduce one third selection of supervisory board directors by workers (¬ß¬ß 76 ff. BetrVG). An exception is made for family companies. For each two shareholder members, the works council can send a third worker representative. They may also participate in committees of the supervisory board. =Works Councils Act of 1972= On 15 January 1972 the Act of 1952 was updated giving more powers for participation in personal and social affairs of company employees. Individual worker rights were strengthened in relation to unions. =Codetermination Act of 1976= =Third Participation Act 2004= On 18 May 2004 the Drittelbeteiligungsgesetz replaced, and made minor amendments to the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz of 1952 which had remained in force even after the new issuing of the most provisions as \\"Betriebsverfassungsgesetz of 1972\\" European law See also *German company law *German labour law *US corporate law *UK company law Notes References *Sarah Bormann, Angriff auf die Mitbestimmung.

It was the largest private telecoms network in Britain, consisting of 17,000 route kilometres of fibre optic and copper cable which connected every major city and town in the country and provided links to continental Europe through the Channel Tunnel. BR also operated its own national trunked radio network, providing dedicated train-to-shore mobile communications, and in the early 1980s BR helped establish Mercury Communications‚Äô (now Vodafone) core infrastructure by laying a resilient figure-of-eight fibre optic network alongside Britain's railway lines, spanning London, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. Realising the enormous commercial potential, BR Telecommunications Limited (BRT) was created in 1992 to exploit its wayleave rights and to take responsibility for the management and maintenance of the industry's voice, data and radio networks associated with the operational running of the railway and its business needs. BRT was bought by Racal Electronics in 1995 and became Racal-BRT. This merged with Racal Network Services (RNS) in 1997 to become Racal Telecom. Two companies, Thales Translink and Thales Fieldforce, evolved from Racal Telecom in 1999 and were merged into Thales Telecommunications Services (TTS) in April 2002. TTS provides specialist telecoms services to the UK transport market. On 1 April 2009, under TUPE employment regulations, around 480 telecoms experts moved from Thales to Network Rail to maintain the telecoms network.  Early history  In May 1837 William Fothergill Cooke (1806‚Äì1879) and Professor Charles Wheatstone (1802‚Äì1875) entered into a partnership, and on 10 June patented a five-needle telegraph for which five wires were necessary. The telegraph worked by deflecting any two of the needles at the same time to point to any one of 20 letters on the grid behind the needle. Sending and receiving messages was a slow process, as each word had to be spelt out. With only 20 letters on the grid, the spelling sometimes contained inaccuracies. On 25 July, Wheatstone's and Cooke's telegraph was demonstrated to the directors of the London and Birmingham Railway between Euston and Camden Town, a distance of just under a mile. In 1839 the world's first commercial telegraph line using the Cooke and Wheatstone five-needle system was commissioned by the Great Western Railway and built between Paddington and West Drayton, a distance of 13 miles. It was working to Hanwell by 6 April and was completed to West Drayton on 9 April. The public could pay one shilling (5p) to view the telegraph and could send their own telegrams. The undertaking marked the first commercial use of electricity. The line was later extended to Slough, but when it was proposed to carry it to Bristol, the Directors of the railway company objected and the agreement with Cooke and Wheatstone was rejected. Eventually, it was agreed that Cooke was allowed to retain the wires in position on condition that he worked the system at his own expense and sent the railway signals free of charge. Assets This section briefly describes the assets that constitute British Rail‚Äôs telecom systems and networks. The fixed bearer network is at the core of railway communications and thus is vital to the operation of the railway. It provides essential circuits for signalling and electrification control systems, train radio systems, lineside communications, level crossing CCTV, and customer information systems as well as more general IT and business telephony needs. The fixed bearer network infrastructure comprises transmission systems and telephone exchanges, linked by a fibre optic and copper cable network that is located mainly within trackside troughing routes. British Rail had several analogue radio networks that supported mobile communication applications for drivers and lineside workers. These radio networks consist of base stations, antenna systems and control equipment. The National Radio Network (NRN) was developed specifically for the operational railway; it provides radio coverage for 98% of the rail network through 500 base stations and 21 radio exchanges. The NRN offers full access to the BRT telephone network; public service telephone network (PSTN) dialling, including international, is also available. It can provide dedicated open channels on talk-through mode for incident management and an override priority facility to ensure that emergency calls are immediately connected to the railway's Train Control Offices (TCO) and Electrical Control Rooms (ECR). The NRN and ORN are based on analogue radio technology and provide a high level of coverage throughout the railway network for mobile communication at the trackside. The ORN offers facilities for driver emergency communication with the local train control office. The RETB system is based on similar technology as the NRN and ORN but provides data communication for signalling token block exchange as well as voice communication. Secure communication between drivers and signallers is provided by the Cab Secure Radio (CSR) systems located in various parts of the country. This application of analogue radio technology is designed to offer complete radio coverage at the trackside within the limits of its deployment. Fixed communication at the trackside is provided by lineside communication systems. These systems are primarily provided for signallers' communication with drivers and the public, through telephones located on signal posts and at level crossings. Signal Post Telephones (SPTs) and other lineside phones are linked to telephone concentrators at the signal box.http://www.samhallas.co.uk/railway/signal_post.htm Special self-monitoring systems (PETS) are also provided for high-risk level crossings.http://www.samhallas.co.uk/railway/pets.htm CCTV systems are provided on platforms where driver-only operation train services call and at some stations with sub-surface platforms. These self-contained systems comprise cameras, monitors, cabling and control equipment. Voice recorders are also classed as telecoms assets. Management and maintenance  In the late 1960s the National Telecoms Plan (NTP) was launched which brought about a centrally managed (BRHQ) project to install a nationwide co-axial cable based 4 MHz system of transmission bearer services for voice and on-line real time data networks. This was completed in 1972. The fixed network as we know it today was installed piecemeal as part of BR's electrification and signalling projects between 1972 and 1993. Fault reporting is localised and system failure is generally only uncovered as a consequence of customer complaint. The fixed telecommunications network consists of a wide variety of mostly old technologies, some of which are obsolete. As a result of the privatisation process, a significant proportion of the fixed telecommunications network is now provided through lease agreements with Global Crossing and it is maintained by the former BRT. GSM-R GSM-R radio systems are being introduced across Europe under EU legislation for interoperability. In the UK, Network Rail has established a stakeholder's board with cross industry representation to drive the UK implementation of GSM-R to replace the National Radio Network (NRN) and Cab Secure Radio (CSR) systems currently in use. The Rail Safety and Standards Board are revising the current train-to-shore radio standard GO/RT3410, renumbering it as GE/RT8080, and developing a new standard GE/RT8081 that contains requirements that are specific to GSM-R. The Railway Group Standards are being developed to support the European Functional Requirements Specification and should be read in conjunction with this document.http://www.consultation.rssb.co.uk The Network Rail National Project for the introduction of GSM-R plans for the radio service to be live nationwide by 2007, with the current radio systems switched off at the end of 2009. Britain's GSM-R network should be fully operational by 2013 at a cost of ¬£1.2 billion. This cost though does not include the West Coast Main Line, where transmission equipment supplied by Marconi is maintained by Telent.http://www.telent.com/?q=node/2257 GSM-R addresses the relevant recommendations from several accident inquiries: *Clapham (1988) *Abbeyhill (1994) *Cowden (1994) *Ais Gill (1995) *Doncaster (1995) *Winsford (1999) *Ladbroke Grove (1999) *Llanbrynmair (2000) *Tregoss Moor (2000) *Hatfield (2001) GSM-R is the bearer for the ERTMS signalling being introduced from 2010.

The red-wart gall is the sexual phase of the same species.  Cause  The gall is caused by the parthenogenetic generation of Cynips divisa, which has been known by the synonyms Diplolepis divisa, Dryophanta divisa and Spathegaster verrucosus.  Appearance In appearance it is glossy and somewhat flattened sphere and from ten to fifteen or so may occur on a single leaf. The average size is and the colouring starts as green, passing to yellow, orange and then red-brown; the season is midsummer onwards. Circular emergence holes appear in the galls.  Life cycle  Many of the agamic imagines emerge in October. After overwintering, Cynips develops eggs parthenogenetically and their eggs develop in live buds as 'red-wart galls'. The infested buds become yellow, orange or a russet colour and are about long. These red-wart galls appear in May and the males and females of the bisexual generation emerge in June and produce the fertilized eggs which undergo development in the red-pea galls.  Gall- forming insects  Some herbivorous insects therefore create their own microhabitats by forming, in this case, a highly distinctive plant structure called a gall, made up of plant tissue, but controlled by the insect. Galls act as both the habitat, and food sources for the maker of the gall. The interior of a bedeguar gall is formed from the bud, and is composed of edible nutritious and structural tissues. Some galls act as \\"physiologic sinks\\", concentrating resources in the gall from the surrounding plant parts. Galls may also provide the insect with some physical protection from predators.

Carmel played in 124 games over all or parts of four seasons in Major League Baseball between 1959 and 1965 for the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets and New York Yankees, primarily as an outfielder. Carmel threw and batted left-handed; he was listed as tall and . A native of New York City, he graduated from Ben Franklin High School in East Harlem. Carmel signed with the Cardinals in 1955, and in his third minor league season, in the Class C Pioneer League, he was selected to the All-Star team after leading the circuit in runs scored (118) and runs batted in (121). He also batted a career-high .324. He received his MLB baptism in September , starting six games as the Cardinals' center fielder, but he collected only three hits and one base on balls in 24 plate appearances. After an additional trial, in September , Carmel spent all of 1961 and 1962 in the minor leagues (including service in the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cleveland Indians organizations) before returning to the major leagues in for his only full season. Beginning the year with the Cardinals, he appeared in 57 games, mostly as a pinch hitter. His first game of 1963, on April 16 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, was a memorable one: as a pinch hitter, he struck a ninth-inning, game-tying home run off Elroy Face, setting the table as the Cardinals scored the winning run two batters later.Retrosheet box score: 1963-04-16 But by July 18, Carmel was batting only .227 with ten hits in 53 at bats. On July 29, he was traded to the Mets for another outfielder, Jacke Davis. Carmel then became the Mets' starting first baseman. With regular play, his offensive performance perked up, and on August 8 at the Polo Grounds he had perhaps his best day as a major leaguer. Playing against his old team, the Cardinals, Carmel went three for four, hitting his second career home run in the eighth inning, facing left-handed relief pitcher Bobby Shantz, to win the game, 3‚Äì2.Retrosheet box score: 1963-08-08 Although Carmel had two more three-hit games, on September 2 and 26, he hit only .175 during that month, dropping his season average to .233, with four home runs and 20 runs batted in. He was then assigned outright to the Buffalo Bisons, the Mets' Triple-A affiliate, for the entire 1964 season. Carmel responded by blasting a career-high 35 homers, four behind league leader Mack Jones' 39. His power display earned Carmel one final MLB trial. Selected by the Yankees in the Rule 5 draft, he began on the Bombers' roster, playing under his old St. Louis manager, Johnny Keane. But he went hitless in eight at bats, and after May 2 he was sent back to Buffalo. He retired after the 1967 minor league season. All told, he collected 48 hits in the majors, with seven doubles, three triples and four home runs, batting .211 lifetime with 23 runs batted in.

Background From 1922 to 1933, and again from 1951 Germany had had board level codetermination laws, inspired by collective agreements between worker unions and management.E McGaughey, 'The Codetermination Bargains: The History of German Corporate and Labour Law' (2016) 23(1) Columbia Journal of European Law 135 The Weimar Constitution 1919 itself said that, ‚ÄúWorks and staff are appointed to participate with equal rights together with the company in the regulation of wages and working conditions, as well as in the complete economic development of the producing powers.‚ÄùWeimar Constitution 1919 article 165 The coal and steel industry had required half worker and half shareholder seats on the company supervisory board, but outside these sectors, the Work Constitution Act 1952 merely required one third representation. By 1976, and given the success of worker participation it was decided that this should be raised. The 1976 Act was passed on May 4 after long consultations and debates in Parliament (the Bundestag). This law was a political compromise between the Social Democrats and Liberal coalition members; it reconciled views of individual employee participation in decision-making with the less conservative view of collective codetermination of labor. The 1976 law applies to all corporations with more than 2,000 employees; a similar law was passed in 1951 but only applied to coal and steel companies. (It remains in force and applies from 1,000 employees on in these branches' companies.) Content It applies to all German capital companies, including public companies (Aktiengesellschaft), cooperatives (eingetragene Genossenschaft), private limited companies (Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung) and partnerships (Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien) if they have over 2000 employees. Employees and national unions have equal representation on the supervisory board with the stockholders, but the board‚Äôs chairman must be a stockholder who has a tie-breaking vote.WALTHER MULLER-JENTSCH ‚ÄúReassessing Codetermination‚Äù p39-56 The Changing Contours of German Industrial Relations. 2003. Paperback. The principle is to have almost equal representation between employee representatives and shareholder representatives on the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat). Germany company law has two levels of boards of directors. The supervisory board then elects a management board which leads the company. The head of the supervisory board is always a shareholder representative who has two votes in case of a deadlock. (Coal and steel industry companies' co- determination goes even further with full parity and a neutral tie-breaking member, instead) Under the Codetermination Act, the supervisory board must have 12, 16 or 20 members depending on the company's size. Two or three seats will usually be reserved for union representatives. the other seats will be workers, officials and appointees of other interest groups. Companies with equal representation on their boards must have a dedicated management board position for labor affairs. Codetermination allows employees and not only unions to influence the operations of firms and their surplus. Effects While this law was in some ways an extension of the codetermination law of 1951, it differed in key ways. Unlike the 1951 law, however, employees choose their representatives rather than being chosen by the national union; this had the effect of weakening union power. However, employees can use codetermination to protect themselves against wage cuts, layoffs and restructuring, and for this reason, it is believed that wage structure in Germany is remarkably stable. Developments Former Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der established a Commission on Codetermination (Mitbestimmungskommission), which in 2005 came to no conclusion about possible reforms of the law. Different members disagreed with one side wanting to reduce worker influence and the other side increase it.

The first use of this expression is earlier than this, but its origin is unknown. The quartets are considered a milestone in the history of composition; in them, Haydn develops compositional techniques that were to define the medium for the next 200 years. The quartets were composed in 1772 at a time of tensions in Haydn's life, and also when Haydn was influenced by new philosophical and political ideas sweeping Europe. Some analysts see the impact of these emotions and ideas on the quartets.See, for example, Geiringer (1982), Tovey (1923). The quartets The set of quartets includes the following (in order of Haydn's own catalog [']Joseph Haydn, String Quartets Book IV op. 20 (Sun Quartets) (Urtext edition published by Henle, editors Sonja Gerlach, Georg Feder, 2009), ISMN M-2018-0208-4. The numbers assigned by the publisher J. J. Hummel and adopted by Hoboken, are not the order of composition. Nor is Haydn's order necessarily the order of the composition.): No. 5 in F minor No. 6 in A Major No. 2 in C major No. 3 in G minor No. 4 in D major No. 1 in E major Composition Aerial photograph of Eszterh√°zaHaydn was 40 years old when he composed the opus 20 quartets and was already well-established as one of the leading composers of Europe.Geiringer (1982), pp. 57‚Äì74 He was Kapellmeister to the Prince Nikolaus Esterh√°zy, a great lover of music. Haydn presided over the busy musical life of the court, producing operas, oratorios, and symphonic and chamber concerts, and writing a steady stream of new music for the prince's amusement. Nikolaus had eight years prior to this date built the Eszterh√°za palace southeast of Vienna (in Hungary), where the court resided for most of the year. While the palace itself was one of the most splendid in Austria, and was dubbed the \\"Hungarian Versailles\\",Robbins Landon and Jones (1988), p. 95 it was built over a large swamp; it was humid throughout the year, with a \\"vexatious, penetrating north wind\\"from a letter by Haydn, quoted in Geiringer (1982), p. 60 from which Haydn and the other musicians in the court suffered. Moreover, it was far from Vienna, and the musicians (Haydn, as Kapellmeister, excepted) had to leave their wives and families behind for many months. Consequently, there was much discontent among the musicians, and Haydn, like the others, suffered from bouts of depression and illness. This atmosphere found its expression in the opus 20 quartets. \\"The designation affettuoso found twice in the directions for the tempo of slow movements can be applied to the whole opus,\\" writes Geiringer.Geiringer (1982), p. 257. Haydn chooses minor keys for two of the quartets, unusual in a time where the minor was rarely used for this ensemble. In particular, the fifth quartet is in the unusual key of F minor, \\"a key that predisposes even Haydn to sombre thoughts,\\" writes Cobbett.Cobbett (1923), p. 546 Joseph Haydn playing string quartets But the sodden air of Eszterh√°za was not the only influence on the emotional character of the quartets. It was a time of ferment: new ideas that were to spur the Romantic movement in another 30 years were taking root. Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau expounded a philosophy of human freedom and a return to nature. Poets Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller espoused the new Sturm und Drang movement, that \\"exalted nature, feeling, and human individualism and sought to overthrow the Enlightenment cult of Rationalism\\".\\"Sturm und Drang\\", Britannica Online For Haydn, this meant the rejection of the galante style, the courtly, simplified, somewhat slender musical style prevalent at the time. Analysts trace specific musical choices in the opus 20 quartets to these new ideas. For example, the minuet movement of the D major quartet (number 4) is replaced by a frenetic gypsy air titled \\"alla zingarese\\", full of offbeat rhythms. \\"Rousseau's 'back to nature' movement resulted in a general reawakening of interest in national folk music. Haydn showed himself in complete sympathy with this tendency,\\" writes Geiringer. Three of the six quartets have fugues as finales. Counterpoint, the densely complex style of the Baroque, had fallen out of favor with the galante composers. \\"To emphasize his rejection of rococo lightness, Haydn reverted to Baroque features,\\" writes Geiringer.Geiringer (1982), p. 258 The opus 20 quartets were the third set of quartets Haydn wrote at Eszterh√°za.See List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn. His dedication to the string quartet form is something of a mystery; there is no record of a string quartet concert performed at the palace during this period. The set became known as the \\"Sun\\" quartets, because of the picture of a rising sun that graced the cover of an early editionGeiringer (1982), p. 256. The first known publication of the quartets was in 1774 by Louis-Balthazar de La Chevardi√®re in Paris and later (undated, probably in the 1780s or 1790s) by Artaria in Vienna. The most commonly used Urtext edition is by Eulenburg, published in the 1880s. Opus 20 and the development of the string quartet When Haydn published his opus 33 quartets, ten years after the opus 20, he wrote that they were composed in \\"an entirely new and particular manner\\".A letter from Haydn to his publisher Artaria, 1782, quoted in Geiringer (1982), p. 285. But, if the opus 33 was the culmination of a process, opus 20 was the proving ground. In this set of quartets, Haydn defined the nature of the string quartet ‚Äì the special interplay of instruments that Goethe called \\"four rational people conversing\\".Christina Bashford, \\"The string quartet and society\\" in Stowell (2003), p. 4. The quote was from a letter to C. F. Zelter, November 9, 1829. Many of the compositional techniques used by composers of string quartets to the present day were tried out and perfected in these works. \\"This cannot be overstated,\\" writes Ron Drummond; \\"the six string quartets of Opus 20 are as important in the history of music, and had as radically a transforming effect on the very field of musical possibility itself, as Beethoven's Third Symphony would 33 years later\\".Ron Drummond, \\"An Essay Inspired by the Quartet for Strings in F Minor, Opus 20, No. 5\\", ClassicalNet (1999) And Sir Donald Tovey writes of the quartets, \\"Every page of the six quartets of op. 20 is of historic and aesthetic importance... there is perhaps no single or sextuple opus in the history of instrumental music which has achieved so much\\".Tovey, in Cobbett (1923), p. 533 Here are some of the innovations of the quartets: = Equality of voices = Section of No. 4 showing interplay between the first violin and cello Prior to opus 20, the first violin, or, sometimes, the two violins, dominated the quartet. The melody was carried by the leader, with the lower voices (viola and cello) accompanying. In opus 20, Haydn gives each instrument, and particularly the cello, its own voice. An outstanding example of this is the second quartet in C major. The quartet opens with a cello solo, accompanied by the viola and second violin. This was virtually unheard of in Haydn's time. Another example is in the slow movement of the fourth quartet, in D major. This movement is a set of variations, written in D minor; the first variation is a duet between viola and second violin, and the third variation is a solo for cello. = Structural innovations = With the opus 20 quartets, Haydn moved forward the development of the sonata form. A movement written in sonata form has an exposition, where the themes and motifs of the movement are presented; a development section, where these themes are transformed; and a recapitulation, where the themes are restated. Traditionally, the restatement closely matched the original exposition. But Haydn, in opus 20, uses the restatement to further develop the material of the movement. For example, in the F minor quartet, Haydn embellishes the original theme, and rearranges the original material, adding to the musical tension as the movement moves to the coda. In the G minor quartet, the recapitulation is hardly a recapitulation at all; while all the original materials are included, they are rearranged and transformed. There are other structural innovations in opus 20. Haydn develops the idea of \\"false reprise\\".Drabkin (2000), p. 125. In the fourth quartet, in D major, for example, Haydn sneaks into the recapitulation of the first movement, treating it dramatically as though it is a continuation of the development. Haydn also experiments with cyclical structure: the reuse of thematic and rhythmic materials in different movements, to give an overall unity to the piece. = Depth of expression = Haydn experiments with expressive techniques in the quartets. An example of this is the G minor quartet, where Haydn defies the standard practice of ending each movement with a cadence played forte. Instead, Haydn ends each movement piano or pianissimo. Another example is the F minor quartet; this quartet, writes Tovey, \\"is the most nearly tragic work Haydn ever wrote; its first movement being of astonishing depth of thought\\".Tovey, in Cobbett (1923), p. 537. = Length and symmetry of phrases = Minuet of opus 20 number 3. The phrase is five measures long.Haydn experiments with asymmetrical phrases and syncopations. The common practice of the time was to write melodies that divided neatly into four- and eight-measure chunks. But the opening phrase of the third quartet, in G minor, is seven measures long, and the minuet of the same quartet has a melody that is divided into two phrases of five measures each. Indeed, in opus 20, most of the minuet movements are minuets in name only. The minuet was a court dance, through-choreographed, built of four groups of four measures in time. The minuets of opus 20, with the exception of numbers 1 and 6, would be impossible to dance to, as they do not have this formal structure. The minuet of the second quartet in C major is built of tied suspensions in the first violin, viola and cello, so that the listener loses all sense of downbeat. The fourth quartet has the off-beat alla zingarese movement. The minuet of the fifth quartet has a first section of 18 measures, divided asymmetrically. So far did Haydn stray from the formal minuet dance structure, that in his next set of quartets, opus 33, he did not call them minuets at all, but rather scherzos. = Use of counterpoint = Fugal finale of opus 20 number 5.The fugal finales of three of the six quartets are Haydn's statement of rejection of the galante. Not only has Haydn rejected the freedom of the rococo style, he has emphasized that rejection by adhering to strict formality and writing comments into the score explaining the fugal structure. \\"Al rovescio\\" he writes at one point in the last movement of quartet number two, where the fugal melody is played in inversion. \\"In canone\\" he writes in the finale of number 5. The finale of number six is a \\"Fuga a 3 Soggetti\\" (a fugue with three fugal subjects). The fugal finales are not mere formalism, however; Haydn clothes them in a dramatic structure suitable for the Sturm und Drang. All three movements start out sotto voce; as the fugue develops formally, the tension mounts, but Haydn does not increase the volume, until a sudden, startling burst of forte. \\"Haydn has, in the quartets of opus 20, a hint of the emotional and dramatic impulse which became so volcanic in Beethoven's fugues,\\" writes Donald Tovey.Tovey, in Cobbett (1923), p. 535. Haydn's fugal finales are not the only use of counterpoint in these quartets. Haydn revives Baroque compositional techniques in other movements as well. The opening of the second quartet is essentially contrapuntal, with the viola and the second violins playing countersubjects to the cello's principal melodic line. Haydn also uses more obscure techniques; in the adagio movement of the fifth quartet, for example, he writes at one point \\"per figuram retardationis\\", meaning that the melodic line in the first violin lags behind the harmonic changes in the accompaniment. \\"Enormous importance lies in these fugues\\", writes Tovey. \\"Besides achieving in themselves the violent reconquest of the ancient kingdom of polyphony for the string quartet, they effectively establish fugue texture from henceforth as a normal resource of sonata style\\".Tovey, in Cobbett (1923), p. 536. Structure of the quartets =No. 1 in E major= Second theme of the first movement of opus 20 number 1. The theme is stated by the cello. While the first movement is in straightforward sonata-allegro form, Haydn nonetheless breaks with the standard quartet model of the period. The second theme of the exposition is presented by the cello, rather than the violin, playing in a high register above the viola accompaniment. Haydn also disguises the return to the recapitulation after the development section of the movement:for an analysis of this and the other opus 20 quartets, see Tovey, in Cobbett (1923), p. 534, or Drabkin (2000). after only three bars of development, Haydn returns to the theme in the tonic, suggesting the beginning of the recapitulation; but instead, deviates into a series of transpositions, finally sneaking back to the main theme when least expected. Haydn uses this trick of a pretended recapitulation in other opus 20 quartets. Third movement of opus 20 number 1, marked Affetuoso e sostenuto The second movement is a minuet, one of two from the set that follow all the rules of the traditional dance (the other is the minuet of number 6). The third movement is marked \\"Affettuoso e sostenuto\\", written in A major as an aria, with the first violin carrying the melody throughout. The finale, marked presto, is built on a six-measure phrase, with extensive use of syncopations in the first violin. In the middle of the movement there is an extended passage where the first violin plays syncopations and the other instruments are playing on the second beat of the bar; no one plays on the downbeat, and toward the end of the passage the listener loses track of the meter, until the main theme returns. =No. 2 in C major= In this quartet, Haydn develops the equal interplay between the instruments, the quartet conversation. The first movement opens with a cello solo, playing above the accompanying instruments. In the course of the movement every instrument gets to play the solo ‚Äì even the viola, who, \\"besides having a vote in the parliament of four... for once [is heard by Haydn] as he hears the cantabile of the 'cello,\\" writes Tovey.Tovey, in Cobbett (1923), p. 534. The movement is markedly chromatic; the development ranges from C major, to A major, dipping into D major, A minor, F major, and even A major.Second movement of opus 20 number 2 The second movement opens with a bold unisono, then the cello states the theme. It is an emotionally charged movement, with dramatic shifts from pianissimo to forte, mixed with cantabile passages with a sextuplet accompaniment in the viola. Minuet movement of opus 20 number 2. The pedal tones recall the sound of a bagpipe. The minuet, like others in the set, defies choreography. In the opening section, all the instruments are tied across the barline, so the sense of downbeat dissipates. The effect recalls the sound of a musette de cour, or other type of bagpipe. This movement, too, is very chromatic, with the melody of the second section built on a descending chromatic scale in the first violin. Finale of opus 20 number 2. Haydn wrote over this passage, \\"\\" (Thus one friend flees another). The finale is a fugue with four subjects. Haydn marks the opening sempre sotto voce. The fugue ripples along in an undertone, through various learned fugal maneuvers ‚Äì a stretto, al rovescio. The texture gradually thins so that only two voices are playing at once, when suddenly the fugue bursts into forte and cascades of sixteenth notes lead to the close of the quartet. In the autograph edition, Haydn wrote over this passage, \\"Laus. Omnip. Deo. Sic fugit amicus amicum\\" (Praise the Lord. Thus one friend flees another friend).Geiringer (1982), p. 258. The remark is not included in the Eulenberg score. =No. 3 in G minor= \\"This quartet is among the more enigmatic pieces in the repertory,\\" writes William Drabkin.Drabkin (2000), p. 105. \\"Indeed, the work is in so many respects unusual that it seems in places to defy interpretation\\". Opening of Opus 20 number 3. The phrase is seven measures long. The enigma begins with the opening theme of the first movement: built of two phrases of seven measures each, it defies the galante practice of carefully balanced four- and eight-measure phrases. It is almost as if Haydn was wagging his tongue at his contemporaries, violating accepted shibboleths of composition. \\"Haydn's compositional freedom seems often defiantly at odds with what textbooks have to say,\\" writes Drabkin. For example, Haydn inserts brief unisono passages in the major key, as a kind of exclamation mark; but, where such passages would normally be played forte, he has marked them piano for a surprisingly different effect. An unisono passage in the development section of the first movement of opus 20 number 3, played piano Haydn continues the odd phrase structure in the minuet, which is built of five- measure units. Aside from its undanceable meter, the minuet is a sombre work, emphatically minor in character. The trio section of the minuet offers a brief respite with a first strain in E major; but the second strain returns to the minor, modulating down through several minor keys. The trio ends with a plagal cadence to G major, for a Baroque-like Picardy third conclusion; but then the minuet recapitulates in G minor. The move from G major back to G minor is so jolting that Drabkin speculates that the trio might possibly have been borrowed from another piece. The third movement, marked Poco Adagio, is a long cantabile aria in G major, dominated by the first violin and the cello. After the first violin states the theme, the cello takes over with a long rippling line of sixteenth notes. The movement includes a haunting viola solo, unusual in Haydn's quartets, and in quartet writing from that period in general. Last movement of opus 20 number 3. The melodic line is frequently interrupted by breaks. The finale is marked Allegro molto. Here, too, Haydn continues to defy accepted practice. Here Haydn makes dramatic use of silence; the opening four- bar theme breaks off suddenly for a half-measure pause. Such pauses recur throughout the movement, giving the movement \\"a mildly disruptive effect\\", according to Drabkin.Drabkin (2000), p. 122. In this movement, Haydn also makes a number of surprising harmonic progressions. He ends the piece in G major, surprisingly, with a descent from piano to pianissimo. =No. 4 in D major= If the third quartet of the set is the most obscure and difficult to understand, the fourth is the most popular. \\"... The D major quartet, opus 20 number 4, has met with more public recognition than the other five,\\" writes Tovey.Tovey, in Cobbett (1929), p. 537. The quartet opens with a quiet, almost hymn-like statement of the theme. Suddenly there is a burst of arpeggio in the first violin, lapsing immediately back to the quiet of the first motive. The juxtaposition of calm and vigor continues through the exposition, to the statement of the second theme, and a short codetta leading to the development. In the development section, Haydn repeatedly offers false reprises: After a section of development, he presents a dominant arpeggio leading back to the first theme. But this is not the reprise, the development goes on. Haydn does this again, and yet again, then sneaks back into the real reprise in a way that the listener does not notice. The movement ends, like several others of the opus 20, in pianissimo. The first variation in the slow movement of opus 20 number 4. This is a concertante duet between second violin and viola. The second movement, a set of variations in D minor, is one of Haydn's most profound, a rejection of the shallowness of the galante. \\"The poignant second movement Adagio moves the string quartet even farther from the concept of courtly entertainment,\\" writes Miller.Miller (2006), p. 147. \\"In this wonderful movement, we have something of three centuries: the seventeenth century Baroque, the eighteenth century Classical, and the nineteenth century Romantic. Haydn's genius encompasses it all\\". The movement is distinguished by the concertante writing for each of the instruments: the second violin and viola in the first variation, the cello in the second variation, and the first violin in the third variation. In the third movement, the Allegretto alla zingarese, the upper and lower voices play complex, interlocking cross- rhythms, confusing all sense of downbeat. Although the meter is in , the pulse is in two, with the strong beats of the upper voices alternating with the strong beats of the lower voices. The trio section of the movement is a cello solo, marching in perfectly regular time, \\"the perfect foil to the Menuet alla zingarese\\".Drabkin (2000), p. 139. The fourth movement continues the gypsy style of the third movement. Chromatic melodies, octave leaps, use of the gypsy scale (a minor scale with raised fourth and raised seventh), and flashy virtuoso embellishments in the first violin make this movement \\"sheer fun for the listener and likewise for the players,\\" writes Miller. The movement ends in pianissimo, \\"an ending that simply evaporates\\". =No. 5 in F minor= This is the most emotionally intense of the opus 20 quartets. In the opening phrase, the violin sets the tone with a haunting melody. \\"Haydn, we might imagine, set out to test the limits of what the minor mode could express in this newly serious instrumental combination,\\" writes Roger Parker.\\"Haydn ‚Äì Quartet in F minor, Op. 20, No 5\\", lecture by Roger Parker, Gresham College, April 8, 2008] The music rolls out almost without interruption; instead of ending each phrase with a cadence before beginning a new phrase, Haydn runs the phrases together, the end of one being the beginning of the next. Throughout the first movement ‚Äì and, indeed, for almost the entire quartet ‚Äì the first violin leads with the concertante part. Even so, the texture is not galante, for the other parts play important and independent roles throughout. Haydn in the recapitulation continues developing the melody with new embellishments, and the coda wanders through strange modulations ‚Äì D major, G minor ‚Äì before returning to the plaintive F minor conclusion. The minuet continues the sombre mood in F minor. The character of the minuet is as far from that of a courtly dance as can be imagined. Again, the structure of the minuet is irregular and undanceable. The trio section, in F major, offers a brief respite from the relentless minor, but even this section is subdued in tone. Siciliana movement of opus 20 number five, featuring a virtuosic first violin part embellishing the main theme The slow movement is a Siciliana, in F major. The theme cycles throughout the movement, constantly transforming itself, while the first violin plays a concertante descant, floating over the theme, sometimes capturing it, then leaving it again. The finale is a fugue with two subjects. The main subject is a standard fugal motif, used frequently in the Baroque (it appears, among other places, in Handel's Messiah). While constructing a fugue in the strict, learned style, Haydn imbues the movement with an intense dramatic structure; like other fugues in the set, the entire first two thirds of the fugue is sotto voce. Out of this quiet the first violin suddenly erupts to a forte, only to fall back into another piano section. The texture thins and the tension descends, until a second burst of fortissimo, with first violin and cello playing the fugal subject in canon, leading to the dramatic finale. =No. 6 in A major= Themes of the opening movement and the minuet of opus 20 number 6. The similarity of the themes gives a unity to the whole quartet. This, the last quartet as published, but the second of the series as Haydn conceived them, is the most conservative of the set. The quartet has the bright, optimistic character often associated with Haydn's music. The key is A major, a key that highlights the highest and brightest tones of the lead violin. Haydn has marked the first movement Allegro di molto e Scherzando. Yet, here, too, Haydn is trying out new ideas. Traditionally, the exposition proceeds from a first theme in the tonic key to a second theme in the dominant. In the first movement, Haydn indeed proceeds to the dominant key of E major, but then shifts to E minor for the second theme. But he stays in that key only half a measure, modulating to C major, then to D major, and on, shifting keys relentlessly until he comes back to the dominant E major. The second movement, marked Adagio, is a variation on sonata form, modeled after a form developed by Haydn's contemporary, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. The violins dominate, with the first violin playing the melody over rippling sixteenth notes in the second, or the second carrying the melody, with the first playing embellishments. Opening of the last movement of opus 20 number 6 The minuet is in strict danceable form. The theme of the minuet is a variation of the first theme of the first movement ‚Äì one of the most explicit examples of cyclic form in Haydn's work. The last movement is a fugue with three subjects. Like the other fugal finales in the set, this proceeds sempre sotto voce until nearly the end, when it breaks into forte. Unlike the other fugues, however, this has none of the Sturm und Drang drama about it, but is predominantly major and upbeat in character. Impact of the quartets The opus 20 quartets changed forever the way composers would write string quartets. \\"When we consider the poor condition\\" of string quartet writing prior to Haydn, writes C. Ferdinand Pohl,Pohl, in Grove's (1946), p. 583. \\"... it is impossible to overrate his creative powers\\". Many great composers acknowledged their debt to Haydn and to these quartets. \\"It was from Haydn that I first learned the true way to write string quartets,\\" wrote Mozart.\\"Joseph Haydn\\" by Raymond L. Knapp, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Mozart's \\"Haydn\\" Quartets are his explicit acknowledgement of that debt. The immediate inspiration for the quartets is believed to be the opus 33 quartets, written by Haydn 10 years after opus 20; but the earlier quartets were the model in many cases. For example, the fugal finale of the first of Mozart's set (K. 387 in G major) takes after the finale fugues of opus 20. The Sturm und Drang character of the second quartet (K. 421 in D minor) recalls the F minor quartet, of Haydn's; not only does the first violin line recall the sombreness of Haydn's quartet, the accompaniment figure of the opening is a close copy of Haydn's. Beethoven also recognized the importance of Haydn's work. Before embarking on his own first set of string quartets, opus 18, Beethoven studied the scores of the Haydn opus 20 quartets, copying them out and scoring the first for string orchestra.Solomon (1980), p. 116. Throughout his life, Beethoven had a love-hate relationship with Haydn: Haydn was one of Beethoven's teachers, and Haydn's criticisms of his early compositions rankled the young composer to the day of the elder composer's death. Yet, in spite of the antagonism, Beethoven spoke of Haydn with reverence. \\"Do not rob Handel, Haydn and Mozart of their laurel wreaths,\\" he wrote in a letter in 1812, three years after Haydn's death. \\"They are entitled to theirs, I am not yet entitled to mine\\".Solomon (1980), p. 120. Brahms was also a devotee of the opus 20 quartets. Brahms owned the autograph manuscript of the quartets, studied them carefully and annotated them. He bequeathed the manuscript to the Society of Friends of Music in Vienna, where it is preserved today.

He is a former Professor of Economics and Finance at Monmouth University in West Long Branch, NJ. He has taught at the University of New Hampshire and Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He has served as co- editor of the Review of Political Economy since 1995, as Associate Editor and Book Review Editor of the Eastern Economic Journal since 1989, and a member of the Editorial Advisory Board of the journal Basic Income Studies since 2005. He has been on the Board of Directors of the Eastern Economic Association from 1994 to the present, and since 1996 he has served as Treasurer of the group. In addition he has been a regular book reviewer for \\"Dollars and Sense\\" since 2010. Biography Pressman is the elder son of Jeffrey and Phyllis Pressman. Pressman and his brother Alan, a bankruptcy attorney on Long Island, attended public school in Queens (New York) and graduated from Francis Lewis High School. Pressman attended Alfred University in upstate New York, where he received a B.A. in philosophy in 1973. He then attended Syracuse University and received an M.A. in philosophy in 1976. He went on to study economics at the New School, working with Robert Heilbroner, Edward J. Nell, David Gordon, and Vivian Walsh. He received his Ph.D. in 1983 for his work on Francois Quesnay's Tableau √âconomique, the first economic model. Work He is known for his contributions to economics, particularly his work on poverty and the middle class, which documents that a thriving middle class and low rates of poverty require substantial redistributive efforts on the part of the government; his work applying the principles of Post Keynesian economics to microeconomic policy issues; his work on tax and redistribution policy and his work on the Tableau √âconomique. Poverty, the Middle Class, and Income Distribution Pressman has published articles (with his colleague at Monmouth University, Robert Scott) arguing that poverty and inequality are greater than measured by government statistics because these measures exclude interest payments on consumer debt and these interest payments cannot be used to support current living standards. This work has estimated that there are more than 4 million debt poor in the United States. They have also estimated that the problem of inequality is worse than estimated by standard measures such as the Gini coefficient. They are currently seeking to identify the debt poor and to devise policies to aid the debt poor, who do not qualify for many government assistance programs that mainly go to households officially considered as poor. Pressman has published several papers using the Luxembourg Income Study to examine poverty, the middle class and government redistribution throughout the world. These papers argue that one main reason poverty rates are so high in the United States is that government tax and government spending policies do little to help those with low earned incomes. In addition, the United States middle class is very small compared to other developed countries mainly because government tax and government spending policies fail to help middle class families. Additionally, Pressman has published articles on income guarantees and edited a book on the notion of Basic Income Guarantees as a solution to poverty. This work argues that a guaranteed income would not have any major negative economic effects, such as creating great work disincentives, as long as the guarantees are kept to a minimal level. Moreover, this minimal level is greater than the current redistributive efforts in the United States, and something close to what other developed countries provide to their citizens. Pressman has published articles on refundable tax credits for children as a solution to child poverty in the United States and as a way to support the middle class in the United States. This work argues that these tax credits could be financed by eliminating tax exemptions for children. He has also published articles on women and poverty. This work argues that the feminization of poverty is due to more female-headed households in the United States and the lack of appropriate tax and spending programs to help female-headed households. Compared to other developed nations throughout the world who do much to help female-headed families, the poverty rate for U.S. female-headed families is much greater. Government Tax and Spending Policy As noted above, Pressman has published work advocating that government tax and spending policy is a main determinant of poverty and the size of the middle class in developed countries. He has then gone on to argue for more progressive fiscal policies to support poor and middle class households in the United States. He has also argued that these redistributive programs would not have many negative effects. He has analyzed the U.S. Current Population Survey, and articulated a policy to eliminate tax deductions for children and convert them into a refundable tax credit. This would essentially give the United States a system of child or family allowances, similar to other developed nations throughout the world. Such a policy change would help low and moderate-income households at no additional cost. It would also greatly reduce child poverty in the U.S. and increase the size of the U.S. middle class. Pressman has published articles articulating how state governments should deal with the dilemmas of taxing e-commerce, arguing that states need to move away from relying on regressive sales taxes and use more progressive forms of taxation. Finally, Pressman has shown that there is little empirical evidence that government deficits crowd out consumption, business investment, or net exports. There is, however, good empirical evidence that, when used appropriately, fiscal policy is able to mitigate business cycles. Physiocracy and the History of Economic Thought Pressman's work has sought to explain the Physiocratic model of the macro- economy (see Physiocracy), and to argue that the Tableau √âconomique is a consistent economic model. He has shown how this model can be used to deal with the contemporary economic problems such as the productivity slowdown and appropriate tax policy. Finally, he has shown how this model is consistent with the models of contemporary schools of thought such as Post-Keynesian economics. His book, 50 Major Economists, 2nd ed. (Routledge, 2006) brings the ideas of key economists from the past to a more general audience. Other Contributions Pressman has written on financial frauds and their causes, including articles on specific frauds such as Charles Ponzi, Martin Frankel, and Health South. He has argued that naive optimism, a human character trait, is one reason that financial frauds are so prevalent. Another reason is herd behavior. Yet another reason is the lack of adequate government controls and insufficient checks and balances on firms and on individuals working for firms. Finally, human laziness comes into play ‚Äì the failure of people to do the simple homework necessary to identify likely fraudulent activity. Pressman has also written on economic methodology, arguing that the voting paradox cannot be resolved by claiming that voting is like clapping or applauding for a candidate. Strong empirical evidence that people engage in strategic voting, and important differences between voting and applause, make this resolution of the voting paradox inadequate. Finally, Pressman has argued that Robert Nozick's position on the justice of government redistribution programs, which is put into concrete terms with his famous Wilt Chamberlain example, is badly flawed for four reasons ‚Äì it ignores actual history, yet purports to be a historical theory of justice, it ignores empirical evidence on justice, it ignores the social nature of production and it ignores the future.

It may be caused by a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor. Signs and symptoms Adult patients have worsening myalgias, bone pains and fatigue which are followed by recurrent fractures. Children present with difficulty in walking, stunted growth and deformities of the skeleton (features of rickets). Cause Tumor-induced osteomalacia is usually referred to as a paraneoplastic phenomenon, however, the tumors are usually benign and the symptomatology is due to osteomalacia or rickets. A benign mesenchymal or mixed connective tissue tumor (usually phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor and hemangiopericytoma) are the most common associated tumors. Association with mesenchymal malignant tumors, such as osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma, has also been reported. Locating the tumor can prove to be difficult and may require whole body MRI. Some of the tumors express somatostatin receptors and may be located by octreotide scanning. A phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor is an extremely rare benign neoplasm of soft tissue and bone that inappropriately produces fibroblast growth factor 23. This tumor may cause tumor-induced osteomalacia, a paraneoplastic syndrome, by the secretion of FGF23, which has phosphaturic activity (by inhibition of renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate and renal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). The paraneoplastic effects can be debilitating and are only reversed on discovery and surgical resection of the tumor. Pathogenesis FGF23 (fibroblast growth factor 23) inhibits phosphate transport in the renal tubule and reduces calcitriol production by the kidney. Tumor production of FGF23, Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) have all been identified as possible causative agents for the hypophosphatemia. Diagnosis Biochemical studies reveal hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate), elevated alkaline phosphatase and low serum 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Routine laboratory tests do not include serum phosphate levels and this can result in considerable delay in diagnosis. Even when low phosphate is measured, its significance is often overlooked. The next most appropriate test is measurement of urine phosphate levels. If there is inappropriately high urine phosphate (phosphaturia) in the setting of low serum phosphate (hypophosphatemia), there should be a high suspicion for tumor-induced osteomalacia. FGF23 (see below) can be measured to confirm the diagnosis but this test is not widely available. Once hypophosphatemia and phosphaturia have been identified, a search for the causative tumor should begin. These are small and difficult to define. Gallium-68 DOTA-Octreotate (DOTA-TATE) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is the best way to locate these tumors. If this scan is not available, other options include Indium-111 Octreotide (Octreoscan) SPECT/CT, whole body CT or MRI imaging. =Differential diagnosis= Serum chemistries are identical in tumor-induced osteomalacia, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XHR) and autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR). A negative family history can be useful in distinguishing tumor induced osteomalacia from XHR and ADHR. If necessary, genetic testing for PHEX (phosphate regulating gene with homologies to endopepetidase on the X-chromosome) can be used to conclusively diagnose XHR and testing for the FGF-23 gene will identify patients with ADHR. Treatment Resection of the tumor is the ideal treatment and results in correction of hypophosphatemia (and low calcitriol levels) within hours of resection. Resolution of skeletal abnormalities may take many months. If the tumor cannot be located, treatment with calcitriol (1-3 ¬µg/day) and phosphorus (1-4 g/day in divided doses) is instituted. Tumors which secrete somatostatin receptors may respond to treatment with octreotide. If hypophosphatemia persists despite calcitriol and phosphate supplementation, administration of cinacalcet has been shown to be useful. Popular culture In season 2 of the USA Network series Royal Pains, Reshma Shetty (as Divya Katdare) diagnoses a storm chaser (Jamie Ray Newman) with recurring fractures to have tumor-induced osteomalacia.

This was the second major change to the show; the first was in April 2009. Cast *Criss Angel: Criss acts as the protagonist of his show, as a Victorian Noble who is on a quest for love and to find his existence in this surreal world. *Crimson: The antagonist of Believe, Crimson is often dressed in reds and blacks to symbolize her evil nature. She fights desperately for both Criss' love and to destroy his life. Crimson acts as the evil force in the show. *Kayala: A foil to Crimson, Kayala is Criss' reciprocating love. She was born out of a large poppy, and acts as the force of good in the show. *Ushers: Maestro, Luigi, Slim and Lars are the four bumbling assistants to Criss, acting as his link between the real world and the world of Believe. Maestro acts as the leader of the four, controlling them, along with performing mediocre magic tricks. *Lucky: Lucky is a white rabbit, appearing during the show only for a short period of time. He is the mascot of Believe, and much of the show's merchandise features him. Acts Before the show opens, the Ushers come out and interact with the audience; most notable are Maestro's simple magic tricks and his obvious desire to be Criss. *Opening *Premonition: Criss comes towards the audience and throws his wristband into the crowd. Once a spectator catches it, Criss has the person tell their name, where they're from, and to pick any word out of the English language. A small, locked box (always within the view of the audience) is then lowered from the top of the stage, where Maestro opens it and brings its contents - a clear plastic jar with a piece of paper in it - to Criss and the selected audience member. Much to the amazement of the audience, the paper contains the name, location, and chosen word of the participant. *Tesla Coil: Criss is suited up in a chainmail outfit as a very large tesla coil is presented onstage. Criss goes to enter the cage surrounding the coil, but Crimson has other plans. She turns the power to the coil all the way on, causing sparks to fly and the theatre lights to go out. A pained shout is heard from Criss, and he writhes on the ground in pain as human-sized rabbits in doctor's coats lift him onto a gurney and roll him offstage. *Lucky and Homage to the Rabbits: A small rabbit appears on a large projection screen, desperately trying to escape. It makes its way out and hops onto a box, taking a small microphone and discussing Cirque du Soleil show rules and how it is now going to take over the show. While assuring the audience that no animals were harmed during the production of the show, a large light burns out and falls from the top of the stage, crushing Lucky and killing him instantly. The Ushers come out to find Lucky, placing him on the front of the stage as multiple rabbits come out to dance for their fallen friend. While they dance, Lucky's corpse is taken away, only to be replaced with Criss' body on a gurney. Crimson, who seems to be leading the dance, rips Criss' form off of the gurney and onto the floor, where all of the rabbits fight over it to get a piece. They then dance around with his limbs, head and torso, before being shooed away by the Ushers. *Humbodik: The Ushers reassemble Criss, before running offstage to get \\"the machine\\". Crimson reappears, dancing for the body of Criss while the machine is brought out. Criss' body is then lifted from the ground, before being engulfed in . After the is blown away, we see Criss, whole again. *The Dolls: Three dolls - Gigi, Taz and Charissa - appear, dancing seductively while they dress Criss. *Doves: Criss does some sleight of hand with doves, before he disappears into a cloud of , reemerging with his own pair of wings. He levitates above the stage for a few moments, before disappearing into the stage. *Poppy: Grit, a rabbit, appears on the stage and performs some contact juggling, while a large rabbit hops onstage to watch him. Two men dressed up as poppies come out and spin around, as a very large poppy is brought onstage. Suddenly, the poppy opens to reveal a beautiful woman clad in a white unitard. She performs some aerial acrobatics as Criss appears through a trapdoor in the middle of the stage. He stands on a platform made of thorns, staring up at the woman in awe, a hand clutching at his heart. The woman descends from her flower into Criss' arms. The two embrace before she gets off of the platform. *Scarecrow: Two men in white, billowy skirts wave large white fans before Criss, hiding him from view. When he is show again, he is shouting in pain, as Crimson is crawling through his body. Kayala hides behind the Ushers, who urge her to save Criss. She goes to run offstage as Crimson exits Criss' body, but Crimson catches her and begins to strangle Kayala. Criss has escaped his thorny prison, and runs over with a large white cloth to protect Kayala. He makes Kayala vanish under the white cloth, as Crimson makes herself vanish under a red cloth. Criss rips the red cloth away to reveal a burning tree. He then runs offstage to follow Kayala. *De Kolta Chair: The four Ushers appear on the dark stage with flashlights, looking for Criss. They come upon many rabbits, before Zangelica appears onstage with a baby carriage. The doll-sized Criss and Kayala appear from the carriage, before Lars picks up the smaller Criss and sits him on a chair. Lars and Maestro then lift a cloth over the chair, allowing Criss to reappear as normal. Maestro then begs him to perform his \\"favourite trick\\", the De Kolta chair. Kayala, a chair, and a large box are then brought onstage. Criss places a purple cape over Kayala, having her move her hands before she disappears. The box is then opened to reveal her. *Danceoff: Multiple Moles appears onstage and begin to dance. Criss and Kayala run offstage as the Ushers begin to play Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide who will dance against the moles. Each dances in turn, the most notable being Lars breakdancing on his head. *Tronik: Criss and Kayala return, and the Ushers begin to haggle them about their romance. Criss only smirks and replays that they \\"can kiss the monster\\", the monster being a lurking Tronik. Kayala runs offstage as Criss and Maestro run into the audience, Lars, Luigi and Slim running offstage to get whips and shields. Criss goes back onstage and defeats Tronik with magic. The creature staggers back for a moment, before regaining itself and heading toward Maestro, who cowers. The creature then removes its arms and torso, revealing Criss inside. *Metamorphosis: Crimson appears onstage and begins to seduce Criss, along with partially undressing him. He is then thrown into a wooden crate, while Crimson and her minions writhe upon the stage, tying up the crate. Crimson then climbs atop it, hidden in a cloud of before a firewall goes off. Criss then appears atop the crate, and begins to open it, revealing a straight-jacketed Crimson inside. *Wedding: Kayala is revealed, wearing a white wedding gown with a huge train following her. The Ushers come out to congratulate her as Criss is seen to appear atop the wall of the train. He then begins to walk down it, marrying Kayala after his descent. The two proceed to kiss as the Ushers pose for photographs. A large pool of blood begins to form on the gown's train, growing large with each flash of the camera. Finally, the gown is ripped from Kayala. A spotlight shines on Crimson and her paparazzi, before Criss is illuminated, Kayala lying on the ground next to him. *Paparazzi: Criss and his Ushers fight to keep the paparazzi away from Kayala's lifeless form, the paparazzi dancing with Crimson before the wind blows them away. Criss mourns for Kayala before the Ushers take her away. A large projection of Crimson appears before Criss, knocking him to the ground. *In Two: A large, mechanical-like table is rolled out, along with figures sharpening chainsaws on it. Criss is chased offstage by a Crowman, before one of the Dolls brings him back on and throws him upon the table. Crimson takes a chainsaw from one of her henchmen as Criss is bound and shackled to the table, before sawing him in half. Blood and gore spill out everywhere, each half of Criss' now-lifeless body pulled in separate directions offstage. *Funeral: The Ushers come out and mourn over Criss, placing red roses on his grave. Crimson walks out with a Crowman and a wheelchair, spitting on Criss' grave before throwing her black rose on the ground. She is then covered by a blanket on the wheelchair and spun around so that she is no longer facing the audience. More mourners bestow roses upon Criss' grave as Kayala comes out in a black mourning gown, placing her white rose gently upon her beloved's grave. A large scrim comes down upon the stage before the wheelchair begins spinning. The figure seated removed the blanket, revealing Criss. He turns around to look at the characters of his surreal adventure, but the lights have gone dark and they are no longer visible. He then turns back to the audience, his whisper of \\"Believe\\" echoing throughout the theatre. Costumes M√©r√©dith Caron, costume designer, drew much inspiration from the 17th through the 19th centuries, including the Victorian era. The fabrics chosen reflected the themes of desire, seduction, and dreams. The many materials for the characters include linen, cotton netting, crushed velvet, jute, hemp, and crinyl. As an example, Kayala wears a bodice of black crinyl and organza train which is highly influenced by 18th-century decadence. The dolls, on the other hand, are inspired by 17th-century paintings and enlarged paisley patterns. Crimson is seen wearing a costume made of leather and \\"Mirror of Holland\\" linen. Her costume's skin effect was created by using two layers of linen covered by black netting which was slashed and sewn back together to give the impression of scars. Music The official soundtrack for the show, by French composer √âric Serra, was released in late November 2010 exclusively through Cirque du Soleil's web store; the soundtrack can also be purchased at the official Believe store. The soundtrack is composed of the songs from the original variation of the show, with track listing as follows: # Homage to the Rabbits (Rabbit Dance) # The Life Factory # Sexy Pet (The Dolls) # Flying with the Birds # Kayala and the Poppies # Sympathy for Crimson # The Magic Door # The Cockroach Dance (The Moles) # In and Out of the Dream # Shadows and Whispers # Being Houdini I (Straight Jacket) # Being Houdini II # Prewed # Blow Me a Tornado # She is Gone to the Sky # The Magic Wedding The song \\"Sexy Pet\\" also appears on the two-disc 25 compilation soundtrack.

As of 2014, he has released fifteen albums, and has also scored all interactive in-game music for the Electronic Arts game Mirror's Edge as well as its sequel, Mirror's Edge Catalyst. His latest album, Origin#03, was released on 1 June 2019.  Biography  Gothenburg-based Swedish composer, sound designer, and multi-instrumentalist Magnus Birgersson created Solar Fields in the late 1990s. Birgersson was raised in a musical family and began playing piano and synthesizers in the 1970s. In the mid-1980s he began combining synthesizers with computers. In addition to his ambient work, he has also been a guitar player in rock bands, a pianist in jazz funk bands, and keyboard player in drum and bass bands.\\" He has collaborated with Vincent Villuis, a.k.a. AES Dana, on H.U.V.A. Network and T.S.R. in the company of Daniel Segerstad and Johannes Hedberg from Carbon Based Lifeforms. Under the moniker Solar Fields he composed 15 albums and appeared on over 60 various compilations. His first solo release was an ambient album named Reflective Frequencies, released on Ultimae in 2001. This was followed two years later by Blue Moon Station, which also included downtempo and trance, and was designed as a single fluid story. In late 2005, Solar Fields composed Leaving Home and Extended, the latter being a limited edition. His fifth album EarthShine, launched in 2007, featured more upbeat soundscapes blending morning trance, progressive, psychedelic, tribal and ambient music. This up- tempo album was warmly received by the progressive and psytrance scenes. This led to Electronic Arts and DICE commissioning Solar Fields for the in-game score for Mirror's Edge, a first-person action adventure video game released worldwide on November 14, 2008. The soundtrack was included in the VGC's \\"Top 20 Original Soundtracks in Gaming\\". The following year, Solar Fields composed Movements. The album was ranked in the top 10 of best albums by Echoes listeners. The album Movements was also used as the soundtrack for the indie game Capsized from the small Canadian studio Alientrap in 2011. It remains his most popular album to date. In 2010, he used the harmonies and melodies of Movements in a remix album titled Altered - Second Movements and started the Origin series, four albums which aim to present archives and unreleased songs. Until We Meet the Sky and Random Friday were composed in parallel. In 2013, he released the second album in the Origin series, Origin #02. He released his demo song \\"Cluster\\" later that year. His song \\"Pulse\\", along with a remix of it by Airwave, was released on June 30, 2014 by Joof Recordings. On September 30, 2015, it was confirmed by DICE and Birgersson that he was creating the in- game score of Mirror's Edge: Catalyst, and that he had been working on said score for twelve months as of the aforementioned date. On March 29, 2018, his album Ourdom was released. It contained 13 tracks. He had reportedly begun working on it during 2016-2017 as a side project to an unnamed upcoming album, eventually turning it into a separate album entirely.

Back, L-R: Ruth Buzzi, Joanne Worley, Alan Sues, Dennis Roy Allen, and Henry Gibson Alan Grigsby Sues (March 7, 1926 ‚Äì December 1, 2011) was an American actor widely known for his roles on the 1968‚Äì1973 television series Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. Alan's on-screen persona was campy and outrageous. Typical of his humor was a skit that found him following a pair of whiskey-drinking cowboys to a Wild West bar and requesting a frozen daiquiri. His recurring characters on the program included \\"Big Al the Sportscaster\\", \\"Uncle Al the Kiddies' Pal\\", and \\"Jo Anne Worley\\", after Worley left the show. Early life Alan Grigsby Sues was born on March 7, 1926, in Ross, California, to Alice (n√©e Murray) and Melvyn Sues, who raised racehorses, requiring the family to move frequently. He served in the U.S. Army in Europe during World War II. Career Sues used his GI Bill benefits to pay for acting lessons at the Pasadena Playhouse, where he performed, later making his Broadway debut in the stage play Tea and Sympathy, directed by Elia Kazan, which had a successful run in New York City beginning in 1953. During this period, he met and married Phyllis Gehrig, a dancer and actress, subsequently starting a vaudevillian nightclub act in Manhattan -- with which they toured North America before divorcing in 1958. After touring the country with his wife, he got more work in stand-up comedy (at Reuben Bleu and Blue Angel, both clubs in Manhattan), worked with Julius Monk, and joined an improv/sketch group with The Mad Show, which led to his being cast in Laugh-In. Outside of Laugh-In, he appeared in the classic Twilight Zone episode \\"The Masks\\", in a non-comedic role. He also had supporting roles in the films Move Over, Darling (1963) and The Americanization of Emily (1964). After Laugh-In, Sues portrayed Professor Moriarty onstage in Sherlock Holmes (opposite John Wood, and later Leonard Nimoy), which, according to Alan, was \\"one of my favorite roles, because it's so against type, and I loved the makeup\\". The makeup for Moriarty was used in several books about makeup as an example of shadowing and technique. Sues appeared in television commercials for Peter Pan Peanut Butter during the 1970s, as a tongue-in-cheek Peter Pan. He toured with Singin' in the Rain, playing the Elocution Instructor. He also appeared in several movies, and provided voiceovers including Oh! Heavenly Dog and Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July. During the 1970s, Sues appeared as a celebrity guest on some popular game shows of the era, including The Movie Game, Celebrity Sweepstakes, The Cross-Wits and Liar's Club. Later years Sues appeared in the short films Lord of the Road (1999) and Artificially Speaking (2009), the latter making its premiere at the 2009 Dances With Films festival in Los Angeles. In 2008, fifty years after their divorce, Sues and his former wife, Phyllis, conducted a lengthy interview at his home for her website. Death Sues died on December 1, 2011, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, where he was taken after suffering an apparent heart attack while watching television with his beloved dog, Doris, according to his partner and accountant, Michael Michaud.

Early career Gouirand was living in Sweden when he met the great trumpeter and composer Don Cherry, who gave him the opportunity to study and work with him in Sweden and Scandinavia and eventually throughout Europe. This experience developed Gouirand's interest in and knowledge of Indian and African music, and World music in general. Cherry's interest in Ornette Coleman led Gouirand to become interested in improvised music as well. Working with Cherry gave Gouirand the opportunity to meet J. M‚ÄôBizo Dyani, Okay Temiz, Trilok Gurtu, Djaya-Deva, Bobo Stenson, and Palle Danielsson, some of whom he worked with later in his career. This musical experience and his Latin and Mediterranean roots inspired Gouirand to meld his Mediterranean culture with contemporary jazz. When Gouirand returned to France in the late 1970s, he worked for a period of time with Okay Temiz's \\"Oriental Wind\\" and Brazilian singer-songwriters Teca and Ricardo. Recording and composing Gouirand then began to compose and record regularly, first for JAM. His first album, Islands (1981), featured Chris Mc Gregor on piano. In 1982, Gouirand appeared on Dyani's album Grand Mother's Teaching, a selection of music with jazz and South African roots. The albums Mouvements Naturels (1982) and Chanting & Dancing (1985) were recorded with his new group World Music Company, and feature Pierre Dorge, Johnny Dyani, Sangoma Everett and Cheikh Tidiane Fall. Gouirand recorded Forgotten Tales (VDS/52¬∞ rue, 1986), an album of original material which features Don Cherry. This record was re-issued in November 2000 by Great Winds/Musea. During the following years, Gouirand explored new directions with Space (VDS/52¬∞ rue), a trio album with Mal Waldron on piano and Michel Marre on trumpet, then La Nuit de Wounded Knee (Blue Line, 1990) with Bobo Stenson, Aldo Romano and Palle Danielsson‚Äîdedicated to native Americans, and Le Matin d'un Fauve (AA/WMD, 1994) again with Mal Waldron and Michel Marre. With the very successful Nino Rota/Fellini album (Deux Z/Harmonia Mundi, 1995), acclaimed arrangement and composition work done around Nino Rota's film music, he explored a more European and typically Mediterranean idiom, while keeping a lot of improvisation. Between 1996 and 1998, he toured in France and Switzerland with \\"Third Dimension\\", a trio with Mal Waldron and vocalist Jeanne Lee. The group did not release any recordings. His album Passages (June 1999, distributed by Harmonia Mundi) features Rita Marcotulli, JJ Avenel, J. Allouche, plus Elise Caron (vocals) and Kevin Davy (trumpet). Gouirand has presented a number of special projects, including one based on the compositions of Nino Rota, a project built around Lapland music with singer Inga Yuuso, and various works with African musicians. Recent activities Les Saisons du Paradis, an ode to Provence with original music and texts from Jean Giono, was produced in 2000-2002. Associated improvisers Garrigues-Sahel, a stage project including traditional African musicians and French jazz improvisers in September 1999, led to the 2000 record project Les Racines du Ciel (BMG, May 2002), with the subsequent stage group \\"Indigo Song\\". In 2006 he issued a record with the group \\"Aumja\\", an attempt to mix creative aspects from Indian and Mediterranean music which included a set of new personal compositions. The group was co-led with sitar player Brigitte Menon. In 2007, he published Boleros, a project that was prepared a year in advance and recorded on his second trip to Santiago de Cuba, where he blends his saxophone with the traditional and modern Bolero and Nueva Trova. Gouirand has performed extensively in concert and at festivals in France and worldwide with Don Cherry, Mal Waldron, Jeanne Lee, J. M‚ÄôBizo Dyani, Pierre Dorge, Palle Danielsson, Bobo Stenson, Aldo Romano, and also with Paul Bley, Jim Pepper, Dino Saluzzi, and Lester Bowie.

Plot Rich orphan Eve Dinant has fallen under the spell of the charming but evil Fred Rice. She becomes his mistress and he induces her to murder his sister. She rapidly understands that she cannot go on living with such a despicable man and decides to leave him. She gives him money to buy his silence. A couple of years later, she meets the famous composer Enric Damor and they get married. Enric's daughter, Claire, meets by chance Fred and falls in love with him. With Enric's approval, Fred proposes marriage and comes frequently to visit his fianc√©e. Eve is determined not to let Fred marry Claire and, as he refuses to listen to her, she tells her husband that the wedding must not take place. Enric does not understand his wife's behaviour and when Fred let him find a letter sent by Claire to him, he asks her whether she is in love with Fred. Rather than confessing her past, Eve tells him that she does love him. Enric is flabbergasted when he hears about his wife's betrayal, but he sublimates his sufferings to create a masterpiece, his Tenth Symphony, on the theme of Women's betrayal. Fred offers Eve not to marry Claire if she comes back to him. She accepts and he writes a curt breakup letter to his fianc√©e. Enric is devastated with his wife's absence and Claire goes to Fred's house, determined to take revenge and have Eve come back. She threatens him with a gun but Eve tries to dissuade her from killing him. While they are arguing, Fred draws his own gun and after pointing it at them, turns it against himself and shoots himself.

On October 8, 1887, Pastor Fogelstrom and others organized the Evangelical Lutheran Immanuel Association for Works for Charity. In December 1890, the hospital was completed and the first four deaconesses began their work at the hospital. The community's needs outpaced the first hospital, located at 36th and Meredith, and a new hospital was opened in 1910 in the same area. The original building became the Nazareth Home, which served people who were elderly and those who had severe disabilities. The need for hospital beds continued to grow and a third hospital was opened on the 36th and Meredith site in 1926. The first two buildings were remodeled and services for the elderly and those with disabilities were expanded. During the 1950s there was a period of growth and reconstruction, and a six-story hospital wing doubled the size of the hospital. Planning for the current Immanuel Medical Center began in the early 1960s when it became apparent that, in order to meet its healthcare commitments, Immanuel would have to expand. The present site at 72nd and Sorensen Parkway was purchased in 1966. The new Immanuel Medical Center opened on June 29, 1974. Recognizing the benefits of alliances in healthcare, Bergan Mercy Health System and Immanuel Medical Center came together to form Alegent Health (now CHI Health) in June 1996.

History After the WPHL was revived for the 1907‚Äì08 season, it was determined that two new teams would be needed so that the league could return to its four team format. That season, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Lyceum entered the league. During their brief time in the WPHL, the Lyceum team included several notable players such as Jack Marks, Tommy Smith and Garnet Sixsmith. Marks however only played in three games for the Lyceum before he jumped to the Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL), eventually playing in the Toronto Professional Hockey Club's Stanley Cup challenge. Meanwhile, Sixsmith reportedly scored 11 goals in a game in Pittsburgh, which is considered to be a record for the Duquesne Gardens. Finally Lyceum player Tommy Smith would later become inducted in the Hockey Hall of Fame. In their first year of play, the Lyceum posted an 11-5-1 record, earning second place in the standings. However midway through their second season, the Lyceum folded on December 23, 1908, because it was impossible for the team to count on a line-up with the league's players constantly jumping contracts. It was decided to discontinue the WPHL after the season and stick with local hockey. The team returned and played in local hockey teams after the initial fold of the WPHL.

The Caps lost in the first round of the 1970 ABA Playoffs to the Denver Rockets, 4 games to 3. For the 1970‚Äì71 season Foreman moved the Caps to Virginia and the team became the Virginia Squires. Strapped for cash due to debts, the Squires traded Warren Armstrong to the Kentucky Colonels for a draft pick and cash, and sold Barry to the New York Nets for $250,000. The Squires finished in first place in the Eastern Division with a 55‚Äì29 record. In the 1971 ABA Playoffs the Squires defeated the New York Nets 4 games to 2 in the first round, but lost the Eastern Division Finals to the Kentucky Colonels 4 games to 2. With the conclusion of the season, on April 6, 1971, the Squires signed future star Julius Erving to a 4-year, $500,000 contract. The Squires finished the 1971‚Äì72 season with a record of 45‚Äì39, good for second place in the Eastern Division. The Squires defeated The Floridians 4 games to 0 in the first round of the 1972 ABA Playoffs but then lost the full seven-game Eastern Division Finals to the New York Nets 4 games to 3. In this season, Johnny Kerr joined the team as administrative vice president. The Squires finished the 1972‚Äì73 season with a 42‚Äì42 record which put them in third place in the Eastern Division. The Squires lost in the 1973 Eastern Division Semifinals 4 games to 1 to the Kentucky Colonels despite Erving's outstanding play. At the conclusion of the season Foreman added George Gervin to the Squires' roster, putting two future Hall of Famers on the same team. In August, 1973, Foreman, again motivated by the Squires' indebtedness, traded Erving and Willie Sojourner to the New York Nets for George Carter, the rights to Kermit Washington and $1 million. Discussing his sales and trades of the Squires' best players, Foreman said, \\"It's not a pleasant thing to hear, but I did what I had to do out of necessity. This is not a public utility. I can't ask for a fare increase when things go bad.\\"Robert W. Creamer, ed., They Said It, Sports Illustrated, February 25, 1974 The Squires signed center Swen Nater but then sold Nater to the San Antonio Spurs for a draft pick and $300,000. Just after Gervin played in the 1974 ABA All-Star Game (which the Squires hosted) it was announced that Foreman had sold Gervin to the San Antonio Spurs for $225,000. Legal action ensued and Gervin ended up with the Spurs. By this point, the constant selling off of the team's star players had a major effect on the Squires' dwindling fan base. The team finished the 1973‚Äì74 season with a record of 28‚Äì56 which was good for fourth place in the Eastern Division, but the Squires lost in the first round of the 1973 ABA Playoffs to the New York Nets, 4 games to 1. During the ensuing off season Barry Parkhill of the Squires, angry about bouncing paychecks, filed suit against Foreman, the Squires and the ABA for $24,000 in back pay and $360,000 for anticipated breach of contract. Jack Ankerson became the Squires' General Manager. The ABA then purchased the Squires franchise. In its last two years the debt-ridden Squires finished 15‚Äì69 both seasons, the worst records in ABA history, and failed to make the playoffs. The team came to an end on May 11, 1976 after its failure to pay a $75,000 league assessment. Because of that, the Squires were not a part of the ABA‚ÄìNBA merger that took place just weeks later. Soccer In 1977 through 1978 Foreman was instrumental in creating the Major Indoor Soccer League. Foreman was commissioner of the MISL from 1978 to 1985, and again in 1989. Personal Earl Foreman died on January 23, 2017. He was survived by his wife, Phyllis (who was the older sister of Ed Snider) and their sons, Scott, Ronald and Stuart.https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/earl-foreman-who-shared- ownership-of-baltimore-bullets-dies- at-92/2017/01/24/ff0f73b2-e246-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html References Category:1924 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Baltimore Category:University System of Maryland alumni Category:University of Maryland School of Law alumni Category:Military personnel from Baltimore Category:Maryland lawyers Category:Lawyers from Washington, D.C.

During this period Cuban music became creolized, and its European and African origins gradually changed to become genuinely Cuban. Instrumentation and music continually developed during this period. The information listed here is in date order, and comes from whatever records survive to the present day.  T√≠picas  For about a hundred years, from early in the nineteenth century to about 1920, the main orchestral format for popular music was the t√≠pica based on wind instruments, usually about 8-10 members. At the same time, there were also itinerant musicians, duos and trios: for them, see trova. = Orquesta Concha de Oro = Founded early in the 19th century by the black violinist and double bass player Claudio Brindis de Salas, it played the dance music of the epoch at the balls of the island's aristocracy: contradanzas, minuets, rigadoons, quadrilles, lancers. It was basically a t√≠pica, or wind orchestra, which was sometimes augmented to 100 players for special occasions such as fiestas. Brindis de Salas, a disciple of maestro Ignacio Calvo, was also a composer of creole danzas and the author of an operetta, Congojas matrimoniales. In 1844 his musical career was interrupted by his involvement in the Escalera Conspiracy, for which whites were absolved, but blacks paid dearly. Brindis de Salas was arrested and tortured.Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. p165 He was banished from the island by the Governor, O'Donnell. Returning in 1848, he was imprisoned for two years, and when he eventually was free to think about reorganizing his band, he found out that most of them had been executed. Apart from the operetta, he is known for a melody dedicated to the General Concha, printed in 1854. His son, Claudio Brindis de Salas Garrido (Havana, 4 August 1852 - Buenos Aires, 1 June 1911) was an even better violinist, of world renown.Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana. La Habana. p60Guill√©n, Nicol√°s 1935. Brindis de Salas: el rey del octavos. La Habana.Giro, Radam√©s 2007. Diccionario encyclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba. vol 1, La Havana. p162 = Orquesta Flor de Cuba = Founded by clarinetist Juan de Dios Alfonso, who moved to Havana, where he played clarinet in Feliciano Ramos's band La Uni√≥n in 1856, and directed La Almendares in 1859. It is not quite clear when he formed La Flor de Cuba, which became one of the most popular in the middle of the 19th century. They played contradanzas, and other dances of the time. The orchestra was a t√≠pica, with cornet, trombone, ophicleide, two clarinets, two violins, double bass, kettle drum, and g√º√≠ro. The ophicleide (ophicleide) was a sort of bass bugle with keys, invented in 1817; the t-bone would be a valve trombone. Orq. La Flor de Cuba, possibly the earliest surviving photograph of a Cuban popular band) They were playing in the Teatro Villanueva in Havana in 1869 when the Spanish Voluntarios attacked the theatre, killing some ten or so patrons who had been watching a bufo (musical satirical comedy), and applauding its revolutionary sentiments. The context was that the Ten Years' War had started the previous year, when Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes had freed his slaves, and declared Cuban independence. Creole sentiments were running high, and the Colonial government and their rich Spanish traders were reacting. Not for the first time, politics and music were closely intertwined, for musicians had been integrated since before 1800, and \\"from 1800 to 1840, blacks were the clear majority of the professional musicians\\".Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN, p161. However, from other passages, such as p153, it is clear that Carpentier means \\"blacks and mulattos\\" because the census data he relies on uses the phrase \\"males of color\\" Bufo theatres were shut down for some years after this tragic event. = Orquesta Valenzuela = The descendant of La Flor de Cuba, led from 1877 by trombonist Raimundo Valenzuela after the death of Juan de Dios Alfonso. We do not know exactly when the name of the orchestra was changed. When Raimundo died in 1905, his brother Pablo became Director. It was, like Flor de Cuba, the most popular t√≠pica of its day.Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. p222 Under cornetist Pablo Valenzuela, the band became one of the earliest to record Cuban music, in 1906 with Edison cylinders (about 40), 1909 with Columbia Records (23) and with Victor (56).The 1909 number Mam√° Teresa, and El garrot√≠n (1913), both Pablo Valenzuela compositions, were reissued on Harlequin LP HQ2025 (HQ CD23).

The last recordings were in 1919; there were about 120 numbers in all, most of which were danzones. The band dispersed after his death. = Orquesta Fa√≠lde = Founded 1871 in Matanzas by Miguel Fa√≠lde, the official originator of the danz√≥n.but see Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. p. 191. His band was composed mainly of wind instruments, and therefore was a t√≠pica. Its initial members were: Miguel Fa√≠lde (cornet); Pascual Carreras (ophicleide); Pancho Morales (1st violin); Juan Cantero (2nd violin); Anselmo 'Frijol√≠n' Casal√≠n (1st clarinet); Eduardo Fa√≠lde (brother, 2nd clarinet); C√°ndido Fa√≠lde (brother, trombone); Eulogio Garrido (double bass); Andr√©s Segovia (timpani); Isidro Acosta (g√º√≠ro).Castillo Fa√≠lde, Osvaldo 1964.

This is the band which played the Alturas de Simpson, the first danz√≥n; it was one of Fa√≠lde's compositions.

Alem√°n was a tailor's cutter in Santiago de Las Vegas and a composer of dance and religious music. He studied music under Pedro √Ålvarez, and became a double bass player, also a good violinist and pianist. He played double bass in the orchestra of Havana Cathedral, and in the orchestra of Juan de Dios Alfonso.Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana. La Habana. p22 Orquesta Alem√°n was a t√≠pica or band based on wind instruments. It included Alejo Carillo (cornet); Pedro Espinosa (trombone); Leobino Zayas (ophicleide); Juli√°n Allende (1st clarinet); Ram√≥n Alem√°n (2nd clarinet); Elias Fuentes (1st violin); Juan T√≥mas Alem√°n (2nd violin); Aniceto Rodr√≠gues (timpanist); Quirino Sastre (g√º√≠ro). On the death of Jos√© Alem√°n in 1924, the orchestra was directed by his brother Ram√≥n, and there were numerous changes of personnel. The band was active until the 1930s. = Orquesta de Perico Rojas = T√≠pica formed in 1884 by the trombonist Pedro Rojas (aka 'Perico'), in G√ºines. Its members at the start of the 20th century included the following: Perico Rojas (trombone); Patricio Vald√©s and Andr√©s Rojas (violin); Mart√≠n Caraballo and Miguel Rojas (clarinet); Jes√∫s Urf√© (cornet); Ambrosio Mar√≠n (trombone); Anacleto Larrondo (ophicleide); Juan R.

La Habana. p283 = Orquesta t√≠pica de Felipe Vald√©s = All that is known of Felipe Vald√©s is that he was a cornetist and composer, who was born in Bolondr√≥n, Matanzas, in the second half of the 19th century. He founded his t√≠pica in 1899, and it became popular in Havana. Its instrumentation in 1916 was: 3 violins; 2 clarinets; cornet; trombone; double bass; saxophone; g√º√≠ro and timbales. Probably it had started with an ophicleide, and later substituted the saxophone. They included a piano by 1929. The group recorded more danzones than any other before 1920. They recorded for Edison (1906), Columbia (starting 1906/7); Victor (starting 1907). The total number of recordings was 315 numbers. Vald√©s composed many numbers, including La Africana, Lamentos and Yey√© Olube. Some of these recordings are available on CD: four numbers from 1907 (Victor), one from 1916 (Columbia) and one from 1929.Arhoolie/Folklyric CD 7032 The Cuban danz√≥n: before there was jazz: 1905-1929.

This was the second band he organized (the first was called La Juventud): the line-up was: Pe√±a (cornet); Antonio Gonz√°lez (trombone); F√©liz Gonz√°lez (ophicleide); Jos√© Bel√©n Puig (1st clarinet); Jos√© Urf√© (2nd clarinet); Juli√°n Barreto (violin); Alfredo S√°enz (violin); Jos√© de los Reyes (tympani); Rufino C√°rdenas (g√º√≠ro) and unknown (double bass). Orquesta Enrique Pe√±a The orchestra started to record in 1908, and became famous for El bomb√≠n de Barreto (Barreto's bowler hat), written by Urf√©, which was supposedly the first danz√≥n to incorporate a syncopated third part, influenced by the son. Several members of the band went on to become well-known later on. The group recorded about 150 numbers,D√≠az Ayala, Crist√≥bal 1994.

The set-up was: Gonz√°lez (ophicleide), Dolores Betancourt (t-bone); Jos√© Bel√©n Puig (first clarinet); Jos√© Urf√© (second clarinet); Miguel √Ångel Mendieta and Benito Moya (violins); Guillermo Maherve (d. bass); Demetrio Pacheco (tympani) and Ulpiano D√≠az (g√ºiro). Despite its old-fashioned format, the orchestra kept in work for 52 years, until the death of its Director in 1967.Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana. La Habana p277. Three of its recordings are available on CD, from 1916, 1925 and 1928.Arhoolie/Folklyric CD 7032 The Cuban danz√≥n: before there was jazz: 1905‚Äì1929.  Charangas  Charangas supplanted the t√≠pica as the standard instrumental line-up for the danz√≥n. Initially called charangas francesas (though they have nothing to do with France), they were 'invented' at the start of the 20th century. The formulation is still going strong, with appropriate adjustments to the instrumentation. The basic idea is to pitch the tone of the orchestra higher and brighter than the t√≠pica, by removing the brass, replacing the clarinet with a flute and replacing the kettle drums with a new invention, the pailas criollas, now called timbales. This metal-cased drum, hit with timbales sticks, and not timpani sticks, produces a distinctive effect. The two timbales drums are pitched differently, and may be supplemented with two timbalitos, pitched even higher, and one or two cencerros (cowbells). Also noteworthy is the use of the sticks on the metal casing to produce a rhythm known as the cascara. From early on these bands also included a piano. The overall effect is to produce a lighter, brighter flavor to the music; who actually originated the idea is not known. = Orquesta Torroella = Founded at the end of the 19th century in Havana, this was the first charanga francesa in the capital, and the first to include a piano. Papaito Torroella and his band Its director was the pianist Antonio 'Papaito' Torroella, and from the start the band included Papaito Torroella (piano); David Rend√≥n (violin); Faustino Vald√©s (flute) and Evaristo Romero (double bass). Under the title Sexteto Torroella, the group recorded eight numbers on Edison cylinders in 1906.Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana. La Habana. p287D√≠az Ayala, Crist√≥bal 1994.

Its line-up at its peak was: Tata Alfonso (flute); Bruno Quijarro (violin); Pablo Bequ√© (double bass); Jes√∫s Lop√©z (piano); Abelardo Vald√©s (g√ºiro); Ulpiano D√≠az (timbales).Orovio, Helio 1981.

La Habana. = Orquesta Romeu = Founded around 1910 by Antonio Mar√≠a Romeu (1876-1955), this was for thirty years the most important charanga in Cuba. Romeu had previously played in Orquesta Cervantes, one of several charangas founded at the beginning of the 1900s, and became one of the most prolific composers of danzones. The orchestra recorded hundreds of numbers over many years, beginning in 1915, and issued a whole series of albums after 1950. It is not clear that Romeu was, as sometimes claimed, the originator of the charanga, but it is clear that his band was for many years the leading danzonera. Orquesta Romeu with singer Fernando Collazo, late 1920s The initial line-up for Orchestra Romeu was: Romeu (piano); Feliciano Facenda (violin); Alfredo Vald√©s (flute); Rafael Calaz√°n (double bass); Remigio Vald√©s (timbal); Juan de la Merced (g√ºiro): quite a small group. Much later the orchestra included Francisco Delabart (flute); Augusto Vald√©s (clarinet); Juan Quevedo (violin); Aurelio Vald√©s and F√©lix V√°squez (g√ºiro); Antonio Ma. Romeu (son, violin); Pedro Hern√°ndez (violin); Dihigo (trumpet); Regueira (trombone) and Jos√© Antonio D√≠az (flute). The singers (introduced after the introduction of the sung danz√≥n, known as the danzonete) were, at two different times, Fernando Collazo and Barbarito D√≠ez. In the thirties it had become a big band, and included two brass instruments. When Romeu died, the orchestra was led for a while by his son, also Antonio Mar√≠a Romeu, then by Barbarito D√≠ez. It still played the traditional danz√≥n, but now was called the Orquesta de Barbarito D√≠ez.Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana. La Habana. p283  Son groups  The son dates back to the latter part of the 19th century. Actual names of players and musical groups appear after the then Cuban President, Jos√© Miguel G√≥mez, sent the battalions of the Ej√©rcito Permanente away from their native provinces. It was the Permanente from Oriente that brought the son to Havana.Blanco, Jes√∫s 1992. 80 a√±os del son y soneros en el Caribe. Caracas. p14 et seq. There are a few early recordings which survive from before the famous sextetos were formed. Some of the theatre music was interesting, for example, the Teatro Alhambra had a group of which Adolfo Colombo was the leading personality. He was a singer and regular recording artist, though few of these recordings have survived. One that has been reissued by Harlequin reveals a funky number which is hard to categorize. Listed as a rumba, it is perhaps best described as a guaracha-son.Harlequin LP HQ2025 (or HQ CD23), Hot dance music from Cuba: first number, side A, Mar√≠a Teresa. Sleeve notes by Crist√≥bal D√≠az Ayala and Richard Spottswood describe the number as \\"an early prototype of the son, dating from the early 1880s\\" The artists singing are Colombo and Claudio Garc√≠a, the guitar probably Alberto Villal√≥n, plus an unknown tres player. All three named players were white, yet the number is creole, almost Afro-Cuban, in style. = Sexteto Bolo√±a = Sexteto Bolo√±a 1926. L>R in photograph: Jos√© Vega Chac√≥n (guitar, 2nd voice), unknown (maracas, 1st voice), Jos√© Manuel Incharte 'El Chino' (bong√≥), Abelardo Barroso (sonero, claves), 'Tabito' (double bass), Alfredo Bolo√±a (tres, leader). In 1915 Alfredo Bolo√±a Jimenez formed a son group in Havana. He played the marimbula, the bong√≥ and the guitar at different times and, despite his physical limitations (dwarfism), he was a force in Cuban music for half a century. His first group was Hortensia Valer√≥n (vocalist), Manuel Menocal (tres), Manuel Corona (guitar), Victoriano Lop√©z (maracas) and Joaqu√≠n Velasqu√©z (bong√≥).Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. In October 1926, the Sexteto Bolo√±a recorded in New York City a set of numbers for Columbia which is available today on the usual media.for instance, La historia del son cubano: Sexteto Bolo√±a, the roots of salsa vol 1. Arhoolie/Folklyric LP 9053. Also Tumbao TCD 060 Sexteto Bolo√±a: Echale candela 1926. The group split up in 1934. = Sexteto Habanero = In 1917 four musicians calling themselves Cuarteto Oriental recorded four numbers for Columbia in Havana. The numbers are listed in a Columbia catalog for 1921, but are probably lost. However, the same group expanded to a sextet in 1918, and were recorded by Victor in a field recording at the Hotel Inglaterra in Havana.details in D√≠az Ayala, Crist√≥bal 1994. Cuba canta y baila: discograf√≠a de la m√∫sica cubana 1898‚Äì1925. Fundaci√≥n Musicalia, San Juan P.R. p319 et seq. At least one of these records has survived, giving two numbers, which are probably the first surviving sones. The new grouping called itself Sexteto Habanero in 1920.Sublette, Ned 2004. Cuba and its music: from the first drums to the mambo. Chicago. p336 Sexteto Habanero 1920. Its line-up was: back, L>R: Guillermo Castillo (guitar and director), Carlos God√≠nez (tres), Gerardo Mart√≠nez (voz prima y claves); front, L>R: Antonio Bacallao (botija), Oscar Sotolongo (square bong√≥) and Felipe Ner√≠ Cabrera (maracas). The instrumental set-up is interesting, because they use some of the original instruments of the son: the botijaOrovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana. p58 and a unique square bong√≥. Soon this (and other) groups appreciated that the double bass was a musically more suitable instrument: they never went back to the botija. Five years later, the group had new members and a different look, including Agust√≠n Gutierrez (bong√≥), Abelardo Barroso (sonero, claves), Felipe Ner√≠ Cabrera (maracas, vocals); Gerardo Mart√≠nez (double bass, vocals, leader); Guillermo Castillo (guitar, vocals), Carlos God√≠nez (tres, vocals).La historia del son: Sexteto Habanero, the roots of salsa 2.

The music is of high quality, considering the technical limitations of the time; the group won first prize in the Concurso de Sones in 1925 and 1926.John Santos in liner notes to Folklyric LP 9054. When the group added a cornet, soon replaced by a trumpet, namely F√©lix Chappott√≠n, it became the Septeto Habanero. This latter line-up lasted until the late 1930s, when sextetos were ousted by conjuntos and big bands. The leader, Gerardo Mart√≠nez then formed a new group, Conjunto T√≠pico Habanero.John Santos in liner notes to Folklyric LP 9054. = Sexteto Occidente = Sexteto Occidente, New York 1926. Back row: Maria Teresa Vera (guitar), Ignacio Pi√±eiro (double bass), Julio Torres Biart (tres). Front row: Miguelito Garcia (clav√©), Manuel Reinoso (bong√≥) and Francisco S√°nchez (maracas). One of the early son sextetos, formed in 1925 by Mar√≠a Teresa Vera and Miguel Garc√≠a, it went to New York and recorded numbers, but lasted only about 18 months.Calderon, Jorge 1983. Maria Teresa Vera. La Habana. Its set-up was typical of the early son groups.Tumbao TCD-087 Sexteto Occidente: Yo no tumbo ca√±a liner notes  Other types  = Orquesta Avil√©s = The group with the longest continuous record, it was founded in 1882 and still in existence. Manuel Avil√©s Lozano (Holgu√≠n, Oriente,Now Province of Holgu√≠n 2 February 1864 - ?) worked as a tailor, and studied music under the Spanish maestro Mag√≠n Torres. Avil√©s, director and clarinetist, formed the orchestra with relatives and other musicians, and, eventually, his thirteen children. Later still, he engaged other younger relatives. He and some of the other band members fought in the Cuban War of Independence in the Ej√©rcito Libertador. The band is unusual in several respects. It started as a t√≠pico, then became a charanga, then became (in the 1940s) what Cubans call a 'jazzband', meaning a big band. The band has always been based in Holgu√≠n, and scarcely ever left Oriente. It is still organized around family members.Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana. La Habana. p38 and 271 It is now called Orquesta Hermanos Avil√©s.The Crist√≥bal D√≠az collection at the library of Florida International University lists only two LPs, both of modern recordings: there were apparently no recordings in the early period of the orchestra. On offer at present is Orquesta Hermanos Aviles CD Virgin-Spain 1999. It contains only recent recordings. = Estudiantina Oriental = This group developed in Santiago de Cuba at the end of the 19th century. It was significantly different from the t√≠picas, both in music, instruments and racial composition (the members were usually white). The genres of music played included danz√≥n, bolero, son and guaracha. The instruments included tres, marimbula, kettle drums or pailas criolla (timbales). This instrumental line-up prefigures that of the sextetos which appeared later, rather than the older t√≠picas. The members would be based on university students, probably reinforced by talent from other quarters. Similar Estudiantina groups were formed in other provincial towns.Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana. La Habana. p274 Giro gives this set-up as characteristic of Estudientinas: two tres, 1st and 2nd; two guitars; one trumpet; botija or double bass; paila (timbal); cencerro (cow-bell); g√ºiro; three singers, 1st, 2nd and falsetto, and maybe both sexes. It is clear that estudientinas in different parts of Cuba had variations in membership, instruments and repertoire.Giro, Radam√©s 2007. Diccionario encyclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba. vol 2, La Havana. p71 = Cuban jazz bands = The history of jazz in Cuba was hidden for many years by the unwillingness of record companies to make recordings available. However, in recent years, it has become clear that its history in Cuba is as long as its history in the USA. The key figure in revealing the early days of Cuban jazz is Leonardo Acosta, musician and musicologist, who has been working on this topic for many years.Acosta, Leonardo 2003. Cubano be, cubano bop: one hundred years of jazz in Cuba. Smithsonian, Washington DC.Giro Radam√©s 2007. Diccionario enciclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba. La Habana. Extensive essay on Cuban jazz in vol 2, p261-269. Others have explored the history of jazz and Latin jazz from the U.S. perspective.Roberts, John Storm 1979.

Schirmer, N.Y..Leymarie, Isabelle 2002. Cuban fire: the story of salsa and latin jazz. Continuum, London.Schuller, Gunther 1986. Early jazz: its roots and musical development. Oxford, N.Y. The pre-history of Cuban jazz includes musicians like Louis Moreau Gottschalk and W.C. Handy, who visited Cuba and brought creole ideas into their music. The Jazz Band Sagua was founded in Sagua la Grande in 1914 by Pedro Stacholy (director & piano). Members: Hip√≥lito Herrera (trumpet); Norberto Fabelo (cornet); Ernesto Ribalta (flute & sax); Humberto Dom√≠nguez (violin); Luciano Galindo (trombone); Antonio Temprano (tuba); Tom√°s Medina (drum kit); Marino Rojo (g√ºiro). For fourteen years they played at the Teatro Principal de Sagua. Stacholy studied under Antonio Fabr√© in Sagua, and completed his studies in New York, where he stayed for three years.Giro Radam√©s 2007. Diccionario enciclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba. La Habana. vol 2, p261. Jazz Band Sagua 1920s The Cuban Jazz Band was founded in 1922 by Jaime Prats in Havana. The personnel included his son Rodrigo Prats on violin, the great flautist Alberto Socarr√°s on flute and saxophone and Pucho Jim√©nez on slide trombone. The line-up would probably have included double bass, kit drum, banjo, cornet at least. Earlier works cited this as the first jazz band in Cuba,Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana. La Habana. p306 but evidently there were earlier groups. In 1924 Mois√©s Simons (piano) founded a group which played on the roof garden of the Plaza Hotel in Havana, and consisted of piano, violin, two saxes, banjo, double bass, drums and timbales. Its members included Virgilio Diego (violin); Alberto Socarr√°s (alto sax, flute); Jos√© Ram√≥n Betancourt (tenor sax); Pablo O'Farrill (d. bass). In 1928, still at the same venue, Simons hired Julio Cueva, a famous trumpeter, and Enrique Santiesteban, a future media star, as vocalist and drummer. These were top instrumentalists, attracted by top fees of $8 a day.Acosta, Leonardo 2003. Cubano be, cubano bop: one hundred years of jazz in Cuba. p28 All these bands no doubt played Cuban music as well as jazz, but there are few recordings of them playing jazz. There can be little doubt that these early ventures built up a stock of Cuban musicians that were at home with both genres. That led eventually to the Latin jazz fusions of later years.

The Duquesne team then played in the first season of the WPHL at the Schenley Park Casino, with three other teams, the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, a club from Western University of Pennsylvania (the University of Pittsburgh today) and a team known as Pittsburgh, or the 'Casino' team. The league played twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday nights. The Duquesne and the WPHL continued play until December 16, when the Casino rink was destroyed by fire. The Duquesne finished the shortened season of league play with a 2-3 record. The league and the Duquesne resumed play in 1898, with its games moved to the new ice rink at the Duquesne Gardens, with league members the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and Western University. Many of the team's players came from Canada, with the Pittsburgh-based club owners luring players to the area with the promise of high paying jobs and a living stipend. The Duquesne did not play in the league in the following season. However, they returned to the league during its final season in 1908-09. Future Hall of Famer Alf Smith played for the Duquesne during their final season in the league, where they posted an 11-5-1 record for second-place finish. The team returned and played in local hockey games after the initial fold of the WPHL. The team later played games inside the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall from 1916-1920\\\\.

The criticism has ranged from minor viewer complaints to serious complaints where broadcasting watchdogs such as Ofcom have been involved. Clarkson's criticism One of the programme's presenters, Jeremy Clarkson, has been critical of the BBC regarding the handling of the programme. In the February 2006 issue of Top Gear Magazine, Clarkson revealed that he thought that the BBC did not take Top Gear seriously, making the length of the series far too long, and often replacing the show with live snooker coverage, despite Top Gear having considerably higher viewing figures. In July 2006, the BBC rejected a variety of complaints regarding the criticism, claiming the producers and presenters choose the way they are covered, and that the BBC do not have any control over it. They argued that the presenters' provocative comments are \\"an integral part of the programme and are not intended to be taken seriously.\\" Regarding offensive remarks traded between presenters and members of the audience, the BBC said \\"this is part of the appeal of the show, and we trust most viewers are familiar enough with the style and tone of the show not to take offence.\\" The BBC pointed out that they would act if such statements and actions were carried out with any degree of seriousness or if the programme breached legal and safety requirements. Studio move Top Gear was in negotiations with the BBC to move to Enstone in north Oxfordshire which was closer to Clarkson's home in Chipping Norton. However, the producers were unable to negotiate a deal, after their initial application was blocked due to opposition by local residents, who feared that Top Gear would create pollution and noise issues. Accusations of homophobia In December 2006, the BBC upheld complaints from four viewers after comments made by Jeremy Clarkson were considered to be homophobic references, had the potential to offend and should not have been broadcast. The complaints regarded comments made by Clarkson in the seventh episode of series six, in which Clarkson agreed with an audience member who described the Daihatsu Copen as \\"a bit gay\\". He later described the vehicle as \\"ginger beer\\", taken to be rhyming slang for the term \\"queer\\". The BBC said there was \\"no editorial purpose\\" for the remarks and the \\"Top Gear team had been reminded of the importance of avoiding such comments about sexual orientation.\\" In December 2009, it was reported that a gay couple had been allegedly denied tickets to see the show being filmed. The context of the situation is unclear. A BBC spokesperson said, \\"We do not ‚Äì absolutely do not ‚Äì discriminate against same sex couples... the whole implication that Top Gear is in any way homophobic is completely wrong.\\" Cultural mockery = Germany = During the first episode of series seven, a news segment featuring BMW's Mini concept from the Tokyo Motor Show showcased a car that Hammond quoted as supposedly being \\"quintessentially British\\", the only added feature being an integrated tea set. Clarkson responded by mocking the car, claiming that they should build a car that is \\"quintessentially German\\". He suggested turn signals that displayed Hitler salutes, \\"a sat-nav that only goes to Poland\\", and \\"ein fanbelt that will last a thousand years\\", a reference to Adolf Hitler's propaganda slogan of \\"the thousand-year Reich\\". These statements gained negative attention from the German government, and led to viewers' complaints reaching the BBC Board of Governors. In July 2006, the BBC Governors‚Äô Programme Complaints Committee rejected the protests: \\"the Committee did not believe that, when looking at the audience as a whole, they would have felt that the comments were anything more than Jeremy Clarkson using outrageous behaviour to amuse his audience, and that the remarks would not have led to anyone entertaining new or different feelings or concerns about Germans or Germany\\". = Romania = During the opening episode of series 14, the presenters were seen taking the Aston Martin DBS Volante, Ferrari California and Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 Spyder on a road trip to Romania. While driving through the Romanian countryside, Clarkson commented on Romania as being \\"Borat country, with gypsies and Russian playboys\\", referring to the 2006 mockumentary starring Sacha Baron Cohen about the fictional journalist from Kazakhstan, which had filmed a few scenes in Romania. The film had already stirred controversy in the country, with a number of local Roma who were involved in the film attempting to sue 20th Century Fox and Cohen. Romanian newspapers claimed that the comments were \\"offensive\\" and \\"bad publicity for their country\\". The Romanian Times also reported that Clarkson called Romania a \\"gypsy land\\". Complaints were also rife regarding Clarkson's actions to don a pork pie hat which he called a \\"gypsy\\" hat, while commenting: \\"I'm wearing this hat so the gypsies think I am [another gypsy].\\" The Romanian ambassador later sent a letter to the producers of Top Gear, in which he showed his appreciation for the show, highlighted the press's freedom of expression, the non-discriminatory spirit, and the fact that 89.5% of the country's population is Romanian, 6.5% is ethnic Hungarians, 2.5% are ethnic Roma and 1.5% are other ethnic groups. He also asked for the show to be re- edited for future showings to exclude the offensive material.\\"Romanian Ambassador in London Asks Top Gear to Re-edit Episode Shot in Romania\\", MediaFax The Daily Telegraph was hacked by a group of Romanians, who stated, \\"We are sick of being mis-represented as Gypsies, and thanks to Top Gear, have been publicly insulted\\". The group took over two pages of the website, covering them in Romanian flags and playing \\"Lonely Shepherd\\" by Gheorghe Zamfir (featured on the soundtrack from the film Kill Bill). = Mexico = During the second episode of series 16, the presenters mocked the Mexican Mastretta MXT sports car on account of it being designed in Mexico. James May introduced the car as \\"The Tortilla\\", then remarked that he did not remember what it was called. Hammond then stated: \\"Cars reflect national characteristics [...] a Mexican car's just going to be a lazy, feckless, flatulent oaf with a moustache, leaning against a fence asleep, looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat\\". This was followed up by James May suggesting that all Mexican food resembles \\"refried sick\\" and \\"sick with cheese on it\\", Richard Hammond remarking, \\"I'm sorry, but just imagine waking up and remembering you're Mexican\\" and Jeremy Clarkson adding, \\"It'd be brilliant because you could just go straight back to sleep again!\\" Clarkson ended the segment by suggesting that the Mexican ambassador to Britain would be too lazy to make any kind of complaint. This prompted the Mexican ambassador, Eduardo Medina Mora, to write to the BBC: \\"The presenters of the program resorted to outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults to stir bigoted feelings against the Mexican people, their culture as well as their official representative in the United Kingdom. These offensive, xenophobic and humiliating remarks only serve to reinforce negative stereotypes and perpetuate prejudice against Mexico and its people\\". BBC issued a letter defending the jokes, stating that national stereotyping was a part of British humour, but apologizing to the Mexican ambassador for the remarks made about him personally. The episode had the Mexican comments cut from its broadcast in the United States. Comedian Steve Coogan, who has appeared on the show three times, criticised the programme for its pitiful apology, suggesting that the usual defence of \\"a bit of a laugh\\", or \\"harmless fun\\" was no longer appropriate, that the insults had gone too far, and described the comments as \\"as funny as a cold sweat followed by shooting pains down the left arm\\". He also criticised the show for what he described as lazy, adolescent humour and \\"casual racism\\" in reference specifically to this episode.\\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/feb/05/top-gear- offensive-steve-coogan Yahoo editor, Richard Evans, described the programme's conduct as another \\"Sachsgate waiting to happen\\". However, Mastretta appeared to brush off the insults, with general director Carlos Mastretta clarifying that the car was simply used as a pretext for the jokes, and that the controversy has increased interest in the MXT. The presenters made repeated reference to the incident in the following episodes of the series: The set of the 41st series of Have I Got News for You, which depicts various recent news stories, includes a mocked-up image of Clarkson dressed like a Mexican in reference to the controversy. Further reference to the incident was made in the India special, where Hammond \\"accidentally\\" painted a Mexican flag on his car after he intended to paint an Indian one. The incident was made reference to yet again in the second episode of series 19, in which the presenters had to race three high-performance cars from Los Angeles to the Mexican border, where the last person to arrive would have to do a review of the MXT in an upcoming episode, which aired as part of the fourth episode of series 19. However the UK broadcast regulator Ofcom cleared the programme due to its \\"comedic intent and the context\\": > In this case, Ofcom took into account that Top Gear is well known for its > irreverent style and sometimes outspoken humour, as well as the regular > format of the studio banter between the three presenters. We considered that > viewers of Top Gear were likely to be aware that the programme frequently > uses national stereotypes as a comedic trope and that there were few, if > any, nationalities that had not at some point been the subject of the > presenters‚Äô mockery throughout the history of this long running programme. > For example, this same episode featured a competition between the UK‚Äôs Top > Gear presenters and their Australian counterparts, throughout which the > Australians were ridiculed for various national traits. In this instance, > therefore, Ofcom considered that the majority of the audience would be > familiar with the presenters‚Äô approach to mocking, playground-style humour, > and would have considered that applying that approach to national > stereotypes was in keeping with the programme‚Äôs usual content, and the > presenters‚Äô typical style. Ofcom was of the view that the majority of the > audience would therefore be likely to have understood that the comments were > being made for comic effect. =Argentina= In September and October 2014, the three presenters and a crew of 29 people were recording the Patagonia Special in Argentina, featuring three cars‚Äîa Porsche 928 GT, a Lotus Esprit and a Ford Mustang Mach I. They had started in Bariloche on 19 September and travelled southward on the trans- Patagonian Route 40, about . On 2 October they had arrived in Ushuaia, at the southern end of Tierra del Fuego. The plan was to film for three more days, and then to continue in Chile. During filming, Twitter comments alleging the number plate \\"H982 FKL\\" on the Porsche was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War began to appear. \\"Top Gear crew 'chased by thousands and ordered out of country'\\", BBC Andy Wilman, executive producer for the show, said on 2 October: \\"Top Gear production purchased three cars for a forthcoming programme; to suggest that this car was either chosen for its number plate, or that an alternative number plate was substituted for the original is completely untrue\\"; Clarkson tweeted: \\"For once, we did nothing wrong\\". \\"H982 FKL\\" has been registered to the Porsche since its manufacture in May 1991. Top Gear did have details of Falklands Porsche number plate before buying it argie bargie foi act request discloses truth behind top gears h982 fkl car/ In the evening, veterans and other Argentinians entered the hotel lobby to confront the team. Clarkson later wrote he \\"had to hide under a bed for a mob howling for his blood\\". Local police then told the team they could not and would not give them any assistance, and in the hostile atmosphere the team decided to leave Argentina. Believing that the presenters were the main targets of the controversy, the crew decided to send Clarkson, May, Hammond and the women from the crew to Buenos Aires, while the rest would drive the cars and their equipment to the border into Chile. May later stated that, prior to flying back to Britain, he and the other presenters had assisted in planning possible airlifts if the journey to the border became too dangerous. The main Route 3 by which they had arrived in Rio Grande a day earlier, was closed to them because the ringway was filled with people, with \\"the mayor in front\\". They drove to the border at Radman by tertiary roads, about . In Tolhuin, after , the convoy was stopped by an intimidating crowd, who threw eggs, rocks, and sticks. The team decided to abandon the three show cars, and reached the border with Chile later that night. At 2 a.m., they had to find a tractor to ford the camera cars through the border river. Pictures show that the abandoned cars had been attacked and damaged with stones. The Porsche had the number plate \\"HI VAE\\". On 31 October 2014, it was announced that the Argentine ambassador Alicia Castro met BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen to demand a formal apology, but the BBC refused to do so, making it clear that they intended to broadcast the special as a fair representation of the events that occurred. The Christmas Special, split into two parts, aired on 27 and 28 December 2014. Tesla Roadster review During episode seven of series 12, Clarkson presented a segment featuring the Tesla Roadster, including a test drive. The segment showed the car's provided batteries running flat after , with Clarkson claiming that the recharge would take 16 hours. Following this, he claimed that the car then broke down. Tesla Motors spokesperson stated that the cars provided never reached less than 20% charge, none needed to be pushed off the track at any point, the recharge time was 3.5 hours, and the brake failure shown in the segment was actually a blown fuse. The BBC responded to these claims with a statement saying, \\"The tested Tesla was filmed being pushed into the shed in order to show what would happen if the Roadster had run out of charge. Top Gear stands by the findings in this film and is content that it offers a fair representation of the Tesla's performance on the day it was tested\\", without addressing the other concerns. The comments were made following Clarkson showing a limp windmill, and complaining that it would take countless hours to recharge the car, using such a source of electricity. A BBC spokeswoman said several times in an interview that Top Gear was \\"an entertainment programme, and should not be taken seriously.\\" After several weeks, Clarkson wrote a blog for The Times, acknowledging that \\"the film we had shot was a bit of a mess\\", but defending the film's claims. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, wrote in a blog on 13 February 2013 that while delivering the vehicle the Tesla team found on a table a prepared script for the segment, demonstrating this was never a fair test. In March 2011 Tesla Motors filed a suit accusing the BBC of libel. In court Tesla Motors lost a major part of its high court libel claim on 19 October 2011. Mr Justice Tugendhat said that no Top Gear viewer would have reasonably compared the car's performance on the show's airfield track to its likely performance on a public road. On 28 October 2011 the carmaker looked set to lose the remaining malicious falsehood claim, Mr Justice Tugendhat saying \\"I shall strike out the claim in this action unless the plea of damage is amended by agreement between the parties, or with the permission of the court.\\" Tesla's court action was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in 2013. Specific criticism =Series 2= After a segment on the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans, the programme received criticism for damaging a historic Jaguar C-Type valued at ¬£1 million. Top Gear responded that they had permission to \\"drive the car hard\\" but Adrian Hamilton, the car's owner, and Top Gear's test driver had different ideas on what that meant.\\"Top Gear 'hooligans' damage classic car\\" London Evening Standard =Series 3= During the fifth episode of series three, Clarkson crashed a Toyota Hilux into a tree, during a segment in which he attempted to prove the sturdiness and reliability of the truck. The tree belonged to the Churchill Parish in Somerset. The villagers presumed that the damage had been accidental, or that someone had vandalised the tree, until the Top Gear episode was broadcast. After the BBC was contacted, the director of Top Gear admitted guilt and the broadcaster paid compensation. =Series 9= The BBC apologised to a number of Top Gear viewers following comments made during the first episode of series nine. Clarkson asked Hammond following his 370 km/h (230 mph) crash, \\"Are you now a mental?\\", which was followed by James May offering Richard Hammond a tissue \\"in case he dribbled\\". The BBC claimed the comments were meant as a joke, but also claimed they saw how the comments could cause offence to mentally disabled and brain-damaged viewers. During the show's American Special, the show received 91 complaints regarding a dead cow being tied to the roof of Jeremy Clarkson's Camaro. It was later revealed by the BBC that the cow had died several days previously and Clarkson had caused no harm or injury to it. Episode five of series nine was criticised for Jeremy Clarkson's reconstruction of a train crash that occurred in Hibaldstow, North Lincolnshire, near Scunthorpe. The incident was mainly criticised due to its insensitivity regarding the Cumbria train crash that occurred only two days earlier. The reconstruction, which was organised by Network Rail as part of its Don't Run The Risk campaign, was criticised by Anthony Smith, chief executive of the rail watchdog Passenger Focus, who said: \\"We need to raise awareness of the issue, but now is not the right time.\\" It was reported that the item had already been delayed several times, due to an earlier fatal level crossing crash. The BBC defended their decision to broadcast the episode, claiming that \\"with only one programme remaining in the series, and the frequency of level crossing accidents, it may have been considered that there was no \\"appropriate\\" time to show the film without it \\"offending\\" somebody. A repeat of the episode was due to be aired on 1 March 2007, but due to the earlier complaints, and another death on a level crossing earlier that morning, was replaced with a new edition of \\"The Best of Top Gear\\". During the show's Polar special at the end of series nine, Jeremy Clarkson was shown drinking gin and tonic while driving through an ice field in the Arctic. Despite the producers' and Clarkson's claims that they were in international waters at the time, the BBC Trust found that the scene could 'glamorise the misuse of alcohol', and that the scene \\"was not editorially justified in the context of a family show pre-watershed\\". =Series 10= During the show's Botswana special, a spokesperson for the Environmental Investigation Agency criticised the BBC for leaving tracks in Botswana's Makgadikgadi salt pan. The BBC denied that they had gone near any conservation areas, and asserted that they had followed the advice of environmental experts. =Series 12= Following the first episode of series 12, Jeremy Clarkson was criticised for making a joke regarding lorry drivers killing prostitutes, thought to be alluding to the Ipswich 2006 serial murders, although it is more likely that Clarkson was referring to the Yorkshire Ripper. Ofcom received over 500 complaints, but say that the remark was not in breach of the broadcasting code. Afterwards, Labour MP Chris Mole wrote a \\"strongly worded\\" letter to the BBC, saying that Clarkson should be sacked regarding the remarks. In response to the complaints on the show, Clarkson announced he would apologise, but later revealed that he was, in fact, apologising for not posting the lap time of a car that was shown on the previous episode. The incident was referenced when Stephen Fry appeared as the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car in July 2009. Clarkson introduced the interview by stating that Fry had \\"begun his career with a Lorry (Laurie), so the one thing we can be certain he hasn't done is killed a prostitute\\". =Series 13= During the final episode of series 13, Clarkson and May were assigned to produce a spoof advert for the new Volkswagen Scirocco. However, one of their spoof ads saw crowds of people leaving Warsaw in terror on buses and trains, because of the imminent German invasion of Poland. At the end of the advert, Clarkson announced \\"Volkswagen Scirocco TDI: Berlin to Warsaw in one tank\\". The advert was uploaded to YouTube minutes after its broadcast, spurring angry comments from Polish viewers. A spokeswoman for the show said that the BBC had only received a handful of complaints, but complaints submitted to national broadcast watchdog Ofcom were expected to be higher. Complaints were also received for three other incidents in the programme: a remake of a VW advertisement, in which a suicide is shown on-screen; Clarkson mocking people who have autism, and the use of the word \\"pikey\\", which Clarkson claims to be someone who sells \\"pegs and heather\\" to describe drivers of the Vauxhall VXR8 Bathurst. =Series 15= In a conversation about women distracting the presenters while driving, Clarkson said he recently saw a woman wearing a burka who \\"tripped over the pavement\\" and revealed a \\"red g-string and stockings\\". Hammond said that this \\"did not happen\\", but Clarkson maintained that it was true. A Mediawatch spokesperson said Clarkson \\"should learn to keep quiet\\". However, one reporter defended Clarkson. =Series 16= The BBC received 600 complaints following the third episode of series 16, following an incident in which the presenters 'murdered' a fat Albanian and attempted to find out which of three car boots he would fit into the best. The episode was also criticised for its stereotypical views on Albania, claiming it is a nest for Albanian mafia car thieves. =Series 17= This episode showed Clarkson and May parking their electric cars in disabled parking spaces. Later the BBC defended its stars, stating that they had permission from the owners to park in the disabled spaces. A later scene showed people pushing the electric Nissan Leaf up a street while Clarkson made jokes about it having run out of charge. Nissan later discovered from onboard data logging that before the \\"test drive\\" its charge had been run down to only 40% capacity. Since then Top Gear has received criticism from electric car enthusiasts, newspapers, celebrities, and Nissan in response to their view on electric cars. =Series 19= In an unaired version of Jeremy Clarkson reviewing the Toyota GT86 and the similar Subaru BRZ, he uses the eeny meeny miny moe rhyme to pick between the two cars, which has historically included the word \\"nigger\\". He mumbles through that part of the rhyme, and the Daily Mirror accused him of mumbling \\"nigger\\". In the aired version of the review, he says the word 'teacher' instead of the racial epithet. After denying the incident, once video evidence surfaced, Clarkson issued the following apology, though maintaining that he did not use the word. > \\"Ordinarily I don't respond to newspaper allegations but on this occasion I > feel I must make an exception. A couple of years ago I recorded an item for > Top Gear in which I quote the rhyme \\"eeny, meeny, miny, moe\\". Of course, I > was well aware that in the best-known version of this rhyme there is a > racist expression that I was extremely keen to avoid. The full rushes show > that I did three takes. In two, I mumbled where the offensive word would > normally occur and in the third I replaced it altogether with the word > teacher. Now when I viewed this footage several weeks later I realised that > in one of the mumbled versions if you listen very carefully with the sound > turned right up it did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying > to obscure. I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe and I > did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in > the programme that was transmitted.\\" \\"I have here the note that was sent at > the time to the production office and it says: \\"I didn't use the N-word here > but I've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like I did. Is > there another take that we could use?\\" \\"Please be assured I did everything > in my power to not use that word, as I'm sitting here begging your > forgiveness for the fact my efforts obviously weren't quite good enough, > thank you.\\" Though this incident happened before the 'slope' comment in the Burma special, it did not surface until afterwards and the combined complaints caused many public figures to call for Clarkson to be fired and ultimately resulted in a 'final warning' from the BBC regarding racist remarks. =Series 21= The Top Gear presenters go across Burma and Thailand in lorries with the goal of building a bridge over the river Kwai. After building a bridge over the Kok River, Clarkson is quoted as saying \\"That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it.\\" as a native crosses the bridge, 'slope' being a pejorative for Asians. Top Gear Executive Producer Andy Wilman responded: > When we used the word slope in the recent Top Gear Burma Special it was a > light-hearted word play joke referencing both the build quality of the > bridge and the local Asian man who was crossing it. We were not aware at the > time, and it has subsequently been brought to our attention, that the word > slope is considered by some to be offensive and although it might not be > widely recognised in the UK, we appreciate that it can be considered > offensive to some here and overseas, for example in Australia and the USA. > If we had known that at the time we would not have broadcast the word in > this context and regret any offence caused. =Series 23= During the first series after Clarkson, May and Hammond's departure, the BBC came under criticism for filming Ken Block speeding and performing doughnuts near the London Cenotaph but defended the decision to film there by saying \\"The filming took place a respectful distance away from the Cenotaph and it was all agreed with Westminster council in advance.\\" Dismissal of Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear In March 2015, the BBC announced Jeremy Clarkson had been suspended for allegedly punching a producer over a confrontation regarding cold food and long filming hours, and that the remaining episodes of the series would not be broadcast. In response to this, over 1,000,000 people signed an online petition to try to get the BBC to reinstate Clarkson. Perry McCarthy, a former Stig, criticised the BBC's decision to pull the next episode from the schedule. On 25 March, the BBC announced that they would not renew Clarkson's contract which finished at the end of March 2015. Following the official decision, James May and Richard Hammond presented their resignation to the BBC in solidarity with their partner and in order to pursue further ventures together. This would lead to the formation of The Grand Tour. The show received widespread criticism after Jeremy Clarkson's contract was not renewed, addressing the importance of the confrontation but remarking the severity of the decision. Subsequently, after the new Series 23 was released and hosted by Chris Evans, the presenter was widely deemed sub-standard.

History of Macedonians in the United Kingdom The majority of Macedonians in Britain arrived after the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia permitted emigration to the West in the 1960s and 1970s. Many Macedonians especially from the Demir Hisar, Bitola and Prilep regions left for Britain during this period. During the 1980s many professionals left Skopje to work in London for the Socialist Republic of Macedonia and for international organisations stationed there. Following the Breakup of Yugoslavia hundreds of ethnic Macedonians left for Britain. After the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s many ethnic Macedonians and Albanians from the newly independent Republic of Macedonia left for Britain as refugees. The 2001 UK Census recorded 1,285 people born in Macedonia. The 2011 UK Census recorded 2,882 Macedonian-born residents in England, 32 in Wales, 56 in Scotland, and 13 in Northern Ireland.

Relatively little is known about this rebellion; its main account is found in Polydore Vergil's Anglica Historia. Prelude Parliament granted Henry VII a subsidy of ¬£100,000 to help defend Brittany, an ally of England in its war against France. King Henry sent Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland to collect taxes to help raise more money for this campaign. However, many of the people in Northumberland and Yorkshire claimed to have already paid their part through local taxes. They were unwilling to give more money to defend a country of no geographical threat to them, as Yorkshire and Northumberland are in Northern England, whereas Brittany is closer to Cornwall and London. The people of the North had also been affected by a poor harvest in 1488, already subjecting them to financial difficulty. After having to pay for military action in Scotland, they were far less able to do so again. Rebellion Rebellion broke out in April 1489. The Earl met with the rebels, but a scuffle broke out and he was killed. The rebels then asked for pardon, but were denied it by the king who sent a large army of 8,000 to the north, led by Thomas, Earl of Surrey. The rebels dispersed and the rebel leader, John √† Chambre, was hanged for treason, so they found a new leader in Sir John Egremont (an illegitimate member of the House of Percy). Unfortunately for the rebels, Egremont proved to be unreliable and fled to the Court of Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, a staunch opposer to Henry's rule. Aftermath The results of this rebellion led the rebels to receive a royal pardon, and no further taxes were collected, thus Henry was unable to get enough money to defend Brittany. He also became aware of the lawless nature of the North of England, which had been loyal to King Richard III, who had spent more time in the North than any previous King of England. Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, who was sent to deal with the Yorkist threat, was made into Henry's Lieutenant in the North. With no estates or interests in the north, Surrey was able to spend many years reconciling the region to Tudor rule. Henry faced no more significant, treason-based problems in the north.

It is thought that he considered their identities sensitive information, and if they were turned over to the UN Secretariat, they could be leaked to the Soviet Union, and reprisals could possibly be taken against their relatives in Hungary. Investigators claim he was found dead of a gunshot wound with the gun in his hand and suicide note in his pocket a park in Queens, New York City, on 26 November 1959 (Thanksgiving Day). Some analysts exclude suicide in spite of the results of the FBI report; for example, the fatal gunshot wound was located on his right temple, but Bang-Jensen was left-handed. Also, cited in W. Cleon Skousen's \\"The Naked Communist\\", a letter to his wife prior to the incident included \\"Under no circumstances whatsoever would I ever commit suicide. This would be contrary to my whole nature and to my religious convictions. If any note was found to the opposite effect in my handwriting, it would be a fake.\\" Also Bang-Jensen had left his home 72 hours earlier to catch a bus. The coroner found he had been dead only a few hours, which indicated possible abduction. His body was incinerated and buried in Denmark. A tombstone was placed in Budapest in Plot #301 of the New Cemetery of R√°koskereszt√∫r, among those for whom he fought.

The 360 MW dual coal- and oil-fired Tilbury A Power Station operated from 1956 until 1981 when it was mothballed, prior to demolition in 1999. The 1,428 MW Tilbury B Power Station operated between 1967 and 2013 and was fueled by coal, as well as co-firing with oil and, from 2011, biomass. Tilbury B was demolished in 2016-19. Since 2013 three other power stations have been proposed or constructed in Tilbury. History Tilbury A and B stations in 1973 =A station= Tilbury A power station was planned from 1947 by the County of London Electricity Supply Company Limited. Following the nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948 the plans were taken forward successively by the British Electricity Authority, the Central Electricity Authority and from 1958 the Central Electricity Generating Board. Construction of Tilbury A was sanctioned in 1950 and began in 1951 and was initially commissioned in 1956 by the Central Electricity Authority. After operating for 25 years the A station was mothballed by the CEGB in 1981 and eventually demolished in 1999, mostly everything including the turbine hall was demolished. The waste water and a small part of the station remained due to being a listed building The site was entirely cleared in 2019 for the construction of the Tilbury2 port. =B station= The CEGB began construction of the larger 1,428 MW Tilbury B station in 1961. This was commissioned in 1968. On privatisation of the electricity industry in 1990 it was assigned to National Power, and was later operated by RWE npower. Conversion to biomass In May 2011, RWE began converting the B station to burn biomass only. They hoped the conversion would allow 750 MW of electricity to be generated from burning wood pellets imported from a pelleting plant in Georgia, USA, and other sources from Europe by the winter of 2011. This conversion made the station the biggest biomass generating site in the world. In July 2013 RWE npower announced they were halting the conversion due to difficulty in converting and financing the plant. It was mothballed after failing to receive a government grant and was decommissioned and subsequently demolished during 2016-9. =C station= In early 2007, npower announced plans to replace the B station with a 1,600 MW 'cleaner' coal-fired power station. The station would have cost ¬£1 billion to build and was hoped to be operational by 2014. The plans were supported by the Port of London Authority. RWE had also planned to build a clean coal power station at Blyth but they have since postponed both schemes. Design and specification = A station = Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners were the civil consulting engineers and architects of Tilbury A; the main consulting engineers were Merz & McLellan. The A station was built on the 226 acre (91.5 hectare) site and was a steel framed construction with elevations in London stock brick. The integrated boiler house and turbine hall were lit by tall rectangular windows, with ancillary buildings by smaller square windows. The A station had two 100 metre high concrete chimneys. Tilbury A had six 60 MW steam turbo-alternators three were manufactured by English Electric and three by Parsons giving a total output of 360 MW. It was designed as a coal-fired station with coal delivered to the jetty on the Thames and stored initially to the east and later to the north of the building. Soon after completion in 1958 the station was adapted to also burn oil. The total steam capacity of the John Thompson boilers was 3,240,000 lb/hr (408 kg/s). The steam pressure and temperature at the turbine stop-valve was 900 psi (62 bar) and 482¬∞C. The alternators generated current at 11.4 kV. Cooling water was drawn from, and returned to, the Thames via caissons in the fueling jetty. The station connected to the National Grid at the nearby 275 kV Tilbury substation. Tilbury A had several railway sidings accessed via a connection to the London, Tilbury and Southend railway between the former Tilbury Riverside and Low Street railway stations. In 1963 Tilbury A was used in experiments by the CEGB on the behaviour of pollutants (principally sulphur dioxide) in flue gas plumes emitted from the power station chimneys. The results showed that the maximum pollutant concentrations occurred 2.4 km downwind of the station in strong winds and 9.6 ‚Äì 13 km downwind in light winds. = B station = The B station was built on the site of coal store to the east of the A station; the coal store for both stations was then relocated to the north of the site. The B station was a steel framed construction with unfenestrated elevations of concrete cladding. The taller boiler house block was orientated north-south to the west of the adjoining turbine hall; control rooms and offices were at the south end. Tilbury B comprised four generating units each of 350 MW. When all four units were available the combined output capacity was 1428 MW, enough power for 1.4 million people, approximately 80% of the population of Essex.Tilbury Power Station, RWE npower The boiler steam pressure was 158.58 bar at a temperature of 566¬∞C. Discharge from the HP turbine was returned to the boilers for reheat to 566¬∞C. The boilers had a capacity of 4 √ó 296 kg/s. The station had two 168 metre high concrete chimneys. One unit was later decommissioned and was used for spare parts for maintenance of the remaining 3 generating units. In addition to the steam generating sets Tilbury power station had auxiliary gas turbines for peak-shaving. This comprised four 17.5 MW gas turbines, the oldest set was commissioned in February 1965. Two 800 tonne coal unloaders were installed on the jetty in 1990. The jetty was enlarged in 2004 to accommodate ships carrying up to 65,000 tons of coal.

The maximum thermal efficiency of the A station was 30.84%; and for the B station was 32.19%. Incidents = 1977 fire = In the early hours of 16 November 1977 a fire broke out at Tilbury B. It spread from the control room along cable ducts and caused severe cracks in the ¬£70 million building. The site was evacuated but three engineers who had stayed behind to shut down the plant were taken to hospital after inhaling fumes. Foam equipment was brought from other power stations and by the evening the fire had been contained.'Power station seriously damaged', The Times, 17 November 1977, p. 2 =2008 boiler incident= On 1 July 2008, an engineer servicing an offline boiler at the station fell from scaffolding into the boiler. Crews used an internal staircase in the boiler to rescue him. =2009 fire= A fire broke out at the power station on 29 July 2009 shortly after 3 pm, with the failure of one of the station's high-pressure turbine units. Workers were evacuated immediately and the fire was reported to be under control by 5:30 pm. There were no casualties. =2012 fire= A major fire broke out in a fuel storage area of the station on the morning of 27 February 2012. Essex County Fire and Rescue Service mobilised over 120 firefighters to the fire, which involved some 4,000 to 6,000 tonnes of fuel in storage cells, two of which were described as \\"well alight\\". Essex Chief Fire Officer David Johnson reported that firefighting operations were hindered by the fact that the blaze was high up in the main structure of the station, which was also heavily smoke-logged. In addition to 15 pumping appliances, crews used three aerial ladder platforms, one major rescue tender, three bulk foam tenders and a thermal-imaging camera in a helicopter to help tackle the fire. Support crews were drafted in from the London Fire Brigade. Despite initial reports, another fire in the adjacent Tilbury docks which started around the same time was not connected to the larger blaze at the power station. It took firefighters several hours to bring the power station fire under control, and relief crews remained at the site for days afterward dousing and removing embers. =Chimneys and power station demolition= The chimneys of the B station were demolished on 28 September 2017. In March 2019, the 14th and final explosive demolition took place.  Ash disposal site  Ash from the boilers at Tilbury power station was deposited on the low lying marshland to the east of the site. The land at Goshems Farm East Tilbury had also been subject to other landfill activity over the years and the fill comprised a mixture of ash and glass bottles. The site had been poorly restored and had little topsoil cover and was uneven and littered with debris. In 2003 a plan was inaugurated to restore the site. This would entail raising the height of the land using soil from civil engineering works along the River Thames and restore the site to high quality arable farmland. Inert construction material is transported in barges to the wharf at Goshems Farm. The first barge was unloaded in 2011 and the restoration works are ongoing. A public footpath will be created along the riverside. Tilbury Ash Disposal Site is operated by Ingrebourne Valley Ltd.  Other power stations in Tilbury  In addition to Tilbury A and B there are three other power stations in Tilbury that are planned or are now operational. = Tilbury Energy Centre = The Tilbury Energy Centre is a planned natural gas Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power station which also includes a peaking plant and a battery energy storage unit. The centre is owned and will be operated by RWE Generation UK plc. It is located on the site of the demolished Tilbury B power station. The Tilbury Energy Centre will comprise three gas-fired CCGT generating units with a total output capacity of 2500 MW; a 300 MW peaking plant comprising open cycle gas turbines (OCGT); and batteries with a capacity of 100 MW. The centre will also have the capability to act as a combined heat and power facility and will be provided with carbon capture readiness capability. The flue stacks of the CCGT will be 95 metres in height and the OCGT stack(s) will 45 metres high. In November 2018 RWE evaluated its UK energy options and decided to freeze the Tilbury Energy Centre development. = Thurrock Flexible Generation Plant = The Thurrock Flexible Generation Plant is a planned natural gas engine and battery energy electricity supply facility. The plant will be developed, owned and operated by Thurrock Power Limited, a subsidiary of Statera Energy. It is located immediately north of the former Tilbury A & B power station site and south of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. The main site occupies an area of 18.5 hectares. The plant will comprise up to 60 fast-starting gas engines fuelled by natural gas connected to electricity generators which will generate a total of 600 MW of electricity. In addition, batteries will store up to 600 MWh and export up to 150 MW of electricity. The engines will not run continuously but will start up for short periods several times a day as the National Grid requires, it is envisaged that they will run for up to 4000 hours per year, i.e. less than half the year. Electrical transformers and switchgear step-up the voltage from the batteries and generators to match the 275 kV National Grid voltage at Tilbury substation. The flue stacks from the engines may be grouped together; the stacks will be 40 metres tall. The engine building will be 20 metres high and the battery building up to 10 metres high. It is envisaged that advance works will start in 2020; main construction work will start in 2021 and take 18 months to six years in total over several phases. The plant will have a design operational life of 35 years. = Tilbury Green Power = The Tilbury Green Power plant is an operational electricity generating facility which uses wood as a fuel source. The plant is owned and operated by Tilbury Green Power Limited. The plant is located within the Port of Tilbury, Essex. There are two phases of development: Phase 1 is a 40 MW waste wood power plant; and Phase 2 is a 20 MW Solid Recovered Fuel power plant. Only Phase 1 has currently been developed; construction started in August 2015 and the plant was commissioned in early 2019. The plant utilises about 270,000 tonnes of waste wood to produce up to 319,000 MWh of renewable electricity each year. Wood is processed onsite to produce wood-chip which is burned in a single travelling grate boiler to produce high pressure steam. This steam passes through a single steam turbine to generate electricity. Electricity (at 132 kV) is supplied to the National Grid via a 4.5 km underground cable to the existing 132 kV substation at Tilbury. Flue gases from the boiler are treated by emissions control technology including Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR), fabric filters, and dry lime and activated carbon injection. Exhaust gases are discharged via a 100 metre high stack. References External links * YouTube - fire at the power station * YouTube - Bill Oddie opens an environmental centre at the power station.

Early life and education Kelly was born at St James's Vicarage, George Street, Manchester, the son of the Rev. James Davenport Kelly and his wife, Margaret Alice Eccles. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School. After army training at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Kelly studied history at Queen's College, Oxford and was ordained in 1884. Retrieved 10 March 2013. Pay-walled As a theologian Kelly was influenced initially by Charles Kingsley, but to more lasting effect by the writing of Frederick Denison Maurice, especially in his two volumes entitled The Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy and The Kingdom of Christ. Kelly sought to explore the way in which a society and culture created \\"propositions\\" about God and then a church \\"system\\" that follows from such propositions. Although identified by others as Anglo-Catholic in his outlook, Kelly often stated that God and religion were not the same, challenging his own students to focus on issues of Faith and practical evangelism rather than the technicalities of church doctrine and administration. Kelly's interest in the ecumenical movement involved him in the Student Christian Movement. SSM founder While training people for missionary service in Korea and Africa, Kelly founded an Anglican religious order, the Society of the Sacred Mission, in Kennington, London in 1893. As the number of students increased, the order first relocated to Mildenhall in Suffolk and then in 1903, to Kelham Hall, Nottinghamshire. Kelly was succeeded as director of the Society by Fr David Jenks in 1910. Academic role in Japan Between 1913 and 1919, at the invitation of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Bishops of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai, Kelly served as Professor of Apologetics at the Anglican Central Theological College, Tokyo, Japan. Kelly's influence on the development of the church in Japan was significant; a number of his students went on to leadership roles and helped to maintain the Nippon Sei Ko Kai's unique Anglican identification and independence through the political turmoil of the 1930s and Second World War. Michael Yashiro, one of Kelly's most loyal students, was elected Presiding Bishop of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai in August 1947.

Located south of Denver, Colorado, the Rio Grande Scenic Railroad operated between Alamosa and La Veta. This route, featuring a climb over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains via Veta Pass, dates back to 1899 and is a successor to the original narrow gauge La Veta Pass line of the Denver and Rio Grande Railway, completed in 1878. In keeping with the Denver & Rio Grande Western slogan Scenic Line of the World (see emblem here), the trip between Alamosa and La Veta offered views of several of Colorado‚Äôs peaks. The railroad ceased operating excursions following a wildfire that damaged some of their facilities, as well as the parent company SLRG entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2019.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200518005770/en/Bankruptcy- Court-Judge-Authorizes-Chapter-11-Trustee  History  The predecessor of the railroad is credited for opening the San Luis Valley to the rest of the world by laying tracks across its borders. The town of Alamosa was literally built in one day with buildings transported by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad in 1878. By 1890, and during the following half-century, Alamosa was the hub for narrow gauge railroading in North America. The railroad departs from the original depot in the heart of downtown Alamosa, where freight trains once delivered ore, lumber, sheep, cattle and farming products, and shipped out agricultural and mining products. Trains from Denver, Durango, Creede, Salida and Santa Fe, New Mexico arrived and departed daily with passengers. Locomotives The Rio Grande Scenic Railroad collection included both vintage steam locomotives and diesel locomotives.

In the immediate wake of the composer's visit to the United States in the summer of 1872, when he conducted several times in Boston and New York, no less than seven publishers issued waltzes supposedly composed by Strauss. Only two from the total of nine compositions that were published are known to have been performed by Strauss during his tour of the United States: the Jubilee Waltz and the Manhattan Waltzes. It is unknown whether or not the other compositions that were published were written by Strauss while he was in America, completed by him after his return to Vienna and sent through the mail, or that some of the publications had nothing to do with Strauss himself, but were compiled by publishers anxious to benefit from Strauss' American tour and the clamour for new Strauss music. Unlike its companion waltz, the Greeting to America,STRAUSS II, J.: Edition, Vol. 51 CD -- Record Jacket, text by Peter Kemp Farewell to America is a potpourri of melodies previously written by Johann Strauss, including: *Introduction‚ÄîIntroduction to Karnevalsbotschafter op. 270 *Waltz 1A ‚Äî theme 1A from Wiener Punschlieder op. 131 *Waltz 1B ‚Äî theme 1B from Spiralen op. 209 *Waltz 2A ‚Äî theme 2B from Gedankenflug op. 215 *Waltz 2B ‚Äî theme 2B from Gedankenflug op. 215 *Waltz 3A ‚Äî theme 1A from Controversen op. 191 *Waltz 3B ‚Äî theme 4B from Controversen op. 191 *Waltz 4A ‚Äî theme 5A from Promotionen op. 221 *Waltz 4B ‚Äî theme 2B from Petitionen op. 153 (composed by Josef Strauss) *Coda ‚Äî 15 bars from Coda of Feuilleton op. 293 (The waltz also has a quotation from The Star Spangled Banner.)

The rough cut of the film coined the 'bootleg' premiere, was screened on October 31, 2008, and November 1, 2008 in Leesburg, VA at the historic Tally Ho Theatre.Horror Society: Ninjas vs. Zombies PREMIERE The film was written and directed by Justin Timpane. Story The film revolves around seven friends, 3 of which are magically granted the use of ninja powers to fight back against hordes of zombies, and their evil leader Eric. The press kit for the film describes the premise as follows: > \\"Seven friends, struggling with late 20s, early 30s life, find themselves in > terrifying danger when a long dead loved one is magically resurrected and > starts devouring souls. To make matters worse, three of them have been > granted the power of the ninja, and now must lead the fight against a power > they cannot hope to vanquish. If they fail, the undead will overrun their > little town, and maybe the world.\\" The script is filled with references to other genre favorites, including but not limited to \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", \\"Lost\\", \\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Ghostbusters\\", \\"Chasing Amy\\", \\"Batman Returns\\", \\"The Incredibles\\", \\"Return of the Jedi\\", \\"Star Trek First Contact\\", \\"Army Of Darkness\\", \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"Dirty Harry\\", and more. The closing credits thank \\"Joss Whedon (Who Doesn't Know We Exist)\\". Soundtrack The film features an eponymous theme song written and performed by Nick Bognar and Michael Roth. The song is also included on Bognar's 2009 album Our Mouths Are Open. Critical reception *The production has been widely anticipated within the horror film community, due in part to its combination of two popular genres‚Äîzombies and ninjas. In a comment typifying the appeal of the hybrid, BD Horror News noted, \\"There are ninjas, and there are zombies, what more do you need?\\" *In February 2009, the film garnered an \\"Award of Merit: Feature Film\\" at \\"The Indie Fest\\". *Another horror genre publication, \\"Fatally Yours,\\" urged its readers to see the film, asking: \\"What? Do we need to send the zombie army to drag you there?\\" The same publication described the film as \\"a homegrown indy filmed right here in Northern VA. Part Evil Dead, part Clerks, part Buffy, part Bourne Identity, with some Harry Potter, a twist of vermouth and a lime chaser - uh, wait ... Funny, Violent, a Rollercoaster; with GOBS of local talent - and international appeal.\\" *On the other hand, the film has been criticized for its thematic similarity to earlier works. One critic, for example, joked that it should not be confused with 1987's singular Ninja vs. Zombie, 1997's Zombie Ninja Gangbangers, or 2004's Vampires vs. Zombies, noting, \\"This is, er, zombieS versus ninjaS. You know, plural?\\" *Before its release, the film's third trailer received the following comments from movie reviewer Chris Beaumont. \\"Seriously, how can you go wrong? It has zombies and ninjas, not to mention magic and blood. This super low-budget outing looks terrible. Terribly good that is. No, the production values are not good and the acting looks even worse, but what they lack in quality and polish, they more than appear to make up for with energy and love for the genre.

Described as \\"the undisputed king of Japanese mature porn\\", Tokuda has inspired many adult industry actors to extend their retirement to a later age. Tokuda has gained international recognition after being profiled by CNN, The Guardian, VICE, and Yahoo. Life and career Tokuda was born on August 18, 1934. He worked as a travel agent until his retirement at about age 60. According to Tokuda, \\"I retired and didn't have anything to do,\\" so he started a second career and life as a porn actor. He had been buying porn videos directly from the production company (he couldn't face getting them at a video store) and had become friendly with a director who suggested he star in a video because \\"old- people porn\\" was becoming popular. By 2008, he had made over 350 videos, and according to one director, \\"In his generation, Tokuda is a superstar.\\" Ruby Productions, which produces his movies, started making \\"mature\\" movies with people in their thirties but the popularity of \\"elder porn\\" has led them to produce a line with people in their seventies, and Tokuda is their star. Tokuda works with both young and older actresses including a number of videos with 72-year-old Fujiko Ito. Given Japan's large elderly population with a lot of time on their hands, mature porn has become a lucrative market, reportedly accounting for 20-30% of sex movie revenue. Male actors are usually anonymous in Japanese porn but Tokuda is now featured in his own branded series of videos for Ruby with actresses of various ages. Another studio specializing in elder porn is Glory Quest which launched the \\"old man\\" series Maniac Training of Lolitas in December 2004 and when that became popular, had Tokuda star with a variety of young AV actresses in the Forbidden Elderly Care (Forbidden Nursing) series beginning in August 2006. An additional series Big Tits Loving Grandfather Erotic Mischief for Glory Quest began in April 2008. Not all of Tokuda's roles involve sex and he enjoys acting different roles. He has said he hopes to be able to continue working in adult videos until he is 80 (with a laugh). Tokuda became a sensation in the West when he was profiled on a CNN report in 2008, and Ruby has plans to release some of his videos in the United States. Personal life Tokuda is married with two children and a grandson. Although he initially kept his work in pornography a secret, Tokuda had to confess after his daughter discovered a fax for a scene he was offered to appear in. He says his wife of 45 years suspects he plays some role in the porn industry but doesn't ask any questions and he has kept his \\"star\\" status a secret.

There was some debate about whether the aim of the boycott was to end segregation in sport, or to end apartheid together. United Nations In 1980, the United Nations began compiling a \\"Register of Sports Contacts with South Africa\\". This was a list of sportspeople and officials who had participated in events within South Africa. It was compiled mainly from reports in South African newspapers. Being listed did not itself result in any punishment, but was regarded as a moral pressure on athletes. Some sports bodies would discipline athletes based on the register. Athletes could have their names deleted from the register by giving a written undertaking not to return to apartheid South Africa to compete. The register is regarded as having been an effective instrument. The UN General Assembly adopted the International Convention against Apartheid in Sports on 10 December 1985. Olympic Games The International Olympic Committee (IOC) withdrew its invitation to South Africa to the 1964 Summer Olympics when interior minister Jan de Klerk insisted the team would not be racially integrated. In 1968, the IOC was prepared to readmit South Africa after assurances that its team would be multi-racial; but a threatened boycott by African nations and others forestalled this. The South African Games of 1969 and 1973 were intended to allow Olympic-level competition for South Africans against foreign athletes. South Africa was formally expelled from the IOC in 1970. In 1976, African nations demanded that New Zealand be suspended by the IOC for continued contacts with South Africa, including a tour by the New Zealand national rugby union team. When the IOC refused, the African teams withdrew from the games. This contributed to the Gleneagles Agreement being adopted by the Commonwealth in 1977. The IOC adopted a declaration against \\"apartheid in sport\\" on 21 June 1988, for the total isolation of apartheid sport. Commonwealth Games The 1934 British Empire Games, originally awarded in 1930 to Johannesburg, was moved to London after the (pre-apartheid) South Africa government refused to allow nonwhite participants. South Africa continued to participate in every Games until it left the Commonwealth in 1961. The Thatcher government's refusal to enforce the Gleneagles Agreement in the UK led Nigeria to initiate a boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, from which 32 of 59 eligible teams withdrew.; ; NCAA The National Collegiate Athletic Association, which governs many North American university sports, permitted South Africans to receive athletic scholarships and compete in its events. Most such student athletes were white; one exception was runner Sydney Maree, who later became a U.S. citizen. By sport The extent of boycotting varied between different sports, in the degree of contact permitted and the severity of punishment of \\"rebels\\" who defied the sanctions. This reflected the different political and social composition of each sport's governing international federation (IF). =Athletics= In track and field athletics, a motion to suspend South Africa from the IAAF was defeated in 1966,Booth (1998), p.87 but had been passed by 1970. Zola Budd's time for the women's 5,000m in January 1984 was not ratified as a world record because it was outside the auspices of the IAAF. =Chess= In the 1970 Chess Olympiad, a number of players and teams protested against South Africa's inclusion, some withdrawing themselves, and the Albanian team forfeited its match against the South African team. South Africa was expelled from FIDE while participating in the 1974 Chess Olympiad, finally returning to international competition in the 1992 Chess Olympiad. =Cricket= Cricket had been organised on racial lines in South Africa from its earliest days with the coloured cricketer Krom Hendricks excluded from provincial and national teams from the 1890s. However, the cricketing boycott was prompted by the reaction of the South African authorities to the selection of Basil D'Oliveira, a \\"Cape Coloured\\" South African, for the England national cricket team in 1968;Booth (1998) see the D'Oliveira affair. The 1970 South African tour of England was called off and replaced by a \\"Rest of the World\\" tour featuring several South African players. The International Cricket Conference (ICC) imposed a moratorium on tours in 1970.Booth (1998), p.99 There were several private tours in the 1970s and \\"rebel\\" tours in the 1980s. Participants in the latter were banned by their national federations upon returning. World Series Cricket, run outside the auspices of the ICC in 1977‚Äì79, included South African players in its \\"Rest of the World\\" team. =Golf= In the World Cup, the Greek government banned South Africa from the 1979 competition in Athens. South Africa competed in the 1980 edition in Bogot√°. The prospect of their appearing in the 1981 edition, due to be staged at Waterville in Ireland, caused it to be cancelled. South Africa did not reappear until the post-apartheid era in 1992. South African golfers continued to play around the world, including PGA Tour, European Tour, and Grand Slam events. Outside golfers competed freely in South African Tour events. The Million Dollar Challenge at the Sun City resort regularly attracted some of the world's top golfers. The Official World Golf Ranking included South African Tour events in its calculations from its instigation in 1986. =Motorsport= South African Jody Scheckter was the 1979 Formula One champion. The South African Formula One Grand Prix and the South African motorcycle Grand Prix were held in 1985 for the final time until the end of apartheid. Various teams boycotted the 1985 Formula One race, some teams in this international motorsport boycotting as part of pressure from their own governments, as part of the mounting pressure against apartheid. =Rugby union= South Africa remained a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB) throughout the apartheid era. Halt All Racist Tours was established in New Zealand in 1969 to oppose continued tours to and from South Africa. Apartheid South Africa's last foreign tour was to New Zealand in 1981. This tour was highly controversial due to the difference of opinions. Though contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 by the British Lions and by France, in 1981 by Ireland, and in 1984 by England. In 1986, though a Lions tour was cancelled, South Africans played in all-star matches in Cardiff and in London marking the IRB centenary. South Africa was excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups, in 1987 and 1991. =Association Football= South Africa was suspended from FIFA in 1963. Stanley Rous, FIFA's President, went to negotiate its reinstatement. The South African FA proposed entering an all-white team in the 1966 World Cup and an all-black team in the 1970 World Cup. This proposal was rejected. =Table tennis= The South African Table Tennis Board (SATTB), a body founded in contravention to the white South African table tennis board, was substituted for the latter by the International Table Tennis Federation. While the SATTB team was able to participate in the world championships held in Stockholm in 1957, team members were immediately refused passports by the government. It ruled that no black could compete internationally except through the white sports body. =Tennis= The South Africa Davis Cup team was ejected from the 1970 Davis Cup, in part thanks to campaigning by Arthur Ashe. It was reinstated in 1973 but placed in the Americas Zone instead of the Europe Zone where other African countries played. It won the 1974 Davis Cup after India refused to travel to South Africa for the final. There were protests at its matches in the United States in 1977 and 1978. In 1977 several countries threatened to withdraw, and in 1978 several did withdraw in protest. In 1979 South Africa was banned again. The South Africa women's team participated in the Federation Cup (now Fed Cup) through to 1977. It hosted and won the 1972 edition in Johannesburg. William Hester, the president of the United States Tennis Association, decided to let a tournament between the United States and South Africa take place in Newport Beach, California in April 1977 in spite of backlash from African nations and protesters due to the apartheid regime. When protesters ran on the court during the match, Tony Trabert, the U.S. manager, \\"hit two protestors with a racket\\" according to The Washington Post. Hester also let another Davis Cup tournament take place at Vanderbilt University's Memorial Gymnasium in Nashville, Tennessee in March 1978 despite protests from civil rights leaders. Hester explained, \\"We do not support or agree with the apartheid policy of the South African government .... But we have entered the draw and, unfortunately, we have to play South Africa - and in the United States.\\" Meanwhile, Joseph E. Carrico, the USTA's first vice president at the time and later president, blamed the low attendance on negative stories published by The Tennessean, even after a reporter was escorted out of the gym by the police. According to The New York Times, the event included \\"more police (150) than protesters (40) outside the gym.\\" South African players continued to compete on the pro tours; Johan Kriek and Kevin Curren reached Grand Slam finals, though both later became naturalised US citizens. Foreign eligibility Some elite South African sportspeople competed internationally for another country, after becoming eligible through naturalization, length of residency, or other criteria applicable by the relevant IF. Examples include runner Zola Budd, whose UK nationality application was fast-tracked in time for the 1984 Summer Olympics; and cricketer Kepler Wessels, who acquired Australian eligibility in the 1980s through residency, before returning to South Africa, for whom he played after the end of apartheid. The 1994 film Muriel's Wedding recounts a fictional 1980s Australian's sham marriage to a South African swimmer seeking Olympic eligibility. End of apartheid With the end of apartheid, sports rapidly ended their boycotts and South Africa was readmitted in the International sports federations. The European Community announced its member governments' ending of the boycott in June 1991. India, which vehemently opposed South Africa's apartheid policy and was at the forefront of isolating the country internationally at all levels, ended its boycott in 1991 by inviting the South African cricket team to the country for an ODI series and subsequently allowed the Indian cricket team to tour South Africa for a Test and ODI series in late 1992. The country's hosting and winning of the 1995 Rugby World Cup was a powerful boost to post-apartheid South Africa's return to the international sporting scene.

He is the president of Lou Engle Ministries. Engle was a senior leader of the International House of Prayer and has assisted in the establishment of several smaller \\"houses\\" of prayer. Ministry Engle has been organizing large prayer rallies since 1999, with hundreds of thousands of people in multiple countries participating. The size of these events, in addition to Engle's political statements, has raised his prominence among the Christian right. Journalist Bruce Wilson referred to Engle as \\"the unofficial prayer leader of the Republican Party.\\" In addition to these meetings, Engle established several small houses of prayer through his Justice House of Prayer ministry. These ministries are often located near prominent landmarks, such as Harvard University or the United States Supreme Court building. The locations of the ministries are strategically chosen, to specifically contend issues such as abortion. In 2008, Engle focused the attention of his prayer groups towards supporting California's Proposition 8 ballot measure. He organized 24-hour protests in front of the United States Supreme Court, whereby the young participants symbolized the powerlessness of terminated fetuses by placing tape over their mouths with the word \\"LIFE\\" written on it. Prayer and politics Engle is strongly pro-life, and encourages his audiences to pray for the overturning of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling and to vote for \\"pro-life\\" political candidates. Taking a firm stand on issues traditionally associated with the Christian Right, Engle's events have drawn support from Evangelical leaders such as Mike Huckabee and Tony Perkins. He criticized other Evangelical leaders regarding the issue of political correctness. Engle maintains that issues such as abortion and homosexuality should remain at the center of the evangelical movement. In keeping with his stance on these issues, Engle has been sharply critical of former U.S. President Barack Obama, claiming that his beliefs \\"counter my convictions and the convictions of masses of believing Americans.\\" Controversy Engle was described by Joe Conason as a \\"radical theocrat\\". The Southern Poverty Law Center says he can occasionally \\"venture into bloodlust.\\" While living in Washington, D.C. Engle was briefly a roommate of then-Senator Sam Brownback. Brownback later spoke at The Call Nashville rally and worked with him while drafting Senate apologies to Native Americans and African-Americans. Brownback's association with Engle became an issue in his successful run for Governor of Kansas. During the campaign, the Kansas Democratic Party ran ads criticizing his association with Engle. Brownback stated that he had not spoken to Engle in several months and that they disagreed on some issues. In May 2010, Engle traveled to Uganda and organized a rally there through The Call. During the rally, he praised the Ugandan government's efforts to combat homosexuality, and praised those promoting the Ugandan anti-homosexuality bill which called for life imprisonment or the death penalty for gays and lesbians with AIDS who engage in sexual relations. Prior to traveling to Uganda, Engle has released a statement condemning the penalties. Engle later stated that he opposes the Ugandan bill and says he was misunderstood while on the platform in Uganda. He called for the church to examine its own sins and to oppose violence against homosexuals. Engle was featured in the 2006 film Jesus Camp, briefly in the 2012 film Call Me Kuchu and in the 2013 film God Loves Uganda. Following anti- Islamic comments by a 2018 Singapore conference hosted by Cornerstone Community Church, the Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs opened an investigation into Engle's inflammatory rhetoric. Organizers apologized to local Muslim leaders, and pledged not to invite Engle back to speak. Personal life Engle and his wife Therese have seven children. He is known for his gravelly voice, cheerful demeanor, and vigorous rocking back and forth while praying and speaking.

For much of its history, it was partnered with another EveryWare product, Tango, that built dynamic database pages from SQL data. The product eventually ended up with Pervasive Software, although it is no longer sold. Butler was introduced to take advantage of new a Mac OS component known as the Data Access Manager (DAM), which was similar in concept to ODBC, allowing end-user client programs to access various data sources. DAM, however, worked at a lower level than ODBC and did not contain any inherent query language. To address the concern that a single DAM program might want to work with different back-end databases, Apple used a second system known as the Data Access Language (DAL), which was a variant of SQL that included additional flow-control and data manipulation instructions. DAL queries were converted to the target database using an adaptor on the server. Butler was written to natively support DAL as its variant of SQL, and use DAM internally to support networking. As such, it avoided several intermediary layers that would be required to use the same queries on other database servers. Butler 2.0, released in May 1996, added direct ODBC links as well. Butler suffered from performance problems due to the single-user nature of the Mac OS. In particular, file access was single-threaded and multitasking was coordinated by the applications, not the operating system.

The order was founded in London in 1874 by Frederick George Lee, Thomas Mossman and John Thomas Seccombe. It is an Anglo- Papalist society, founded to continue the work of the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom (APUC)APUC was formed in 1857. Among its original leaders were Anglicans such as Frederick George Lee and Roman Catholics such as Ambrose de Lisle. Orthodox Christians later became involved in the association. Source: Thomas E.

T. Brandreth, Dr Lee of Lambeth: A Chapter in Parenthesis in the History of the Oxford Movement, London, 1951. The order affirms and supports what is Catholic in Anglicanism and in other Christian churches. It encourages work and prayer for Christian unity, especially the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity celebrated from January 18 to 25. The three founders each claimed to have been consecrated a bishop by an existing bishop standing in a recognised apostolic succession from the original apostles of the first century of the Christian era. However, they did not state in public the names of the bishops who had consecrated them. Now, nearly 150 years afterwards, there are claims on the Internet as to who the original consecrating bishops were.For example the website of the Apostolic Episcopal Church https://www.apostolicepiscopalchurch.org reports who it considers the consecrators of Lee, Mossman and Seccombe were. Click on \\"Intercommunion\\" and then on \\"The Order of Corporate Reunion\\". Retrieved 22 November 2015. However, the veracity of these claims is disputed. The Order of Corporate Reunion regards valid apostolic succession as an essential aspect of the church Catholic. It preserves and protects its own apostolic succession. Following the deaths of its three founders, the order fell dormant. The episcopal succession, however, had been maintained, and in 1912 the order was revived.Revival of the Order of Corporate Reunion was reported in The Torch on 19 June 1912. Prominent members and leaders during the 20th century of the revived order included Arnold Harris Mathew, Arthur Wolfort Brooks and Hugh George de Willmott Newman. The holy orders of the Church of England and of the other Anglican Communion churches had been declared by the Roman Catholic Church to be \\"absolutely null and utterly void\\".Papal Bull Apostolicae Curae issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1896. Some other scholars and commentators also questioned the validity of Anglican orders. During the first half of the 20th century, numerous serving Anglican clergy therefore sought and obtained ordination by OCR bishops as a conditional ordination (reordination), with the aim of receiving holy orders which they could regard as valid, or that others would regard as valid, or of in some way bolstering or improving their claim to be validly ordained. Most of these OCR ordinations took place in secret, though information about some of them became public. It is claimed that some who became very prominent leaders within the Church of England received OCR ordination in addition to their Anglican ordination. The revived Order of Corporate Reunion continues to exist today, or claims to continue, though there have been (and perhaps there still are) rival claims as to which manifestation of the OCR is the genuine and authentic successor to the organisation founded by Lee, Mossman and Seccombe.\\"The Order of Corporate Reunion\\" incorporated 2010 in the State of Missouri has Bp Peter Paul Brennan as its leader (and Bp Bertil Persson as its former leader) and is linked to the Apostolic Episcopal Church; see website https://www.apostolicepiscopalchurch.org and then click on \\"Intercommunion\\" and then on \\"The Order of Corporate Reunion\\".

One of the bodies claiming to be the authentic OCR had Peter Paul Brennan as its primate until his death on 1 August 2016. Bishop Brennan served in succession to Bertil Persson who retired. In the United Kingdom, the OCR is represented by Archbishop John Kersey, leader (from 2015) of the Apostolic Episcopal Church. Some views regarding the identity of the original consecrators In a \\"Pastoral\\" statement drawn up by OCR during its synod in London on 2 July 1877, OCR itself appears to lay claim to three distinct lines of episcopal succession. This \\"Pastoral\\" was published by being read on the steps of St Paul's cathedral on 8 September 1877 and also by being published in an OCR publication \\"Reunion Magazine\\". This 1877 \\"Pastoral\\" describes the work of OCR as being that of \\"recovering .... that which has been forfeited or lost - securing three distinct and independent lines of a new Episcopal Succession, so as to labour corporately, and on no sandy foundation, for the healing of the breach which has been made\\". The \\"pastoral\\" does not name the bishops from whom the three distinct lines of succession had been obtained, nor does it state the particular churches/jurisdictions in which they were serving and whose lines of succession they brought to the OCR. A letter (written by a Revd W Allen Whitworth) published in the \\"Church Review\\" on 28 December 1878 asserts that the OCR lines of succession derived from Roman, Greek and Armenian bishops. OCR's Registrar (a Mr William Grant, a layman) responded to a number of the points in the 28 December 1878 letter but, perhaps significantly, Mr Grant's response does not seek to question, deny or refute Mr Whitworth's assertion that the new OCR succession derives from Roman, Greek and Armenian bishops. Writing in 1947, Henry R T Brandreth (in his book \\"Episcopi Vagantes and the Anglican Church\\", SPCK, page 124) opines that: \\"Certain facts are beyond dispute, namely that a consecration did take place in the summer of 1877; that it took place in Italy; that the bishops consecrated were Lee and Mossman; that the consecrating prelates held Orders accepted as valid at Rome. It is probable that the prelates were in communion with Rome. The remainder of the story is open to question. ..... The whole business was so shrouded in secrecy that it is probably impossible today to arrive at any certainty as to the facts of the case\\". In the year 2000, Bertil Persson wrote a 53 page paper on the origins and history of the Order (\\"The Order of Corporate Reunion\\" by Bertil Persson, 2000 Solna, Sweden). At page 23, having cited and reviewed various items of correspondence and accounts of events, Persson expresses the following conclusions: \\"Based on the accessible facts, we are able to state that: .... Lee was consecrated in June 1877 in Milan by Archbishop Luigi Nazari di Calabiana [Roman Catholic archbishop of Milan] .... Mossmann was consecrated in June 1877 in Milan by Archbishop Luigi Nazari di Calabiana\\". Consecrations by OCR Among those consecrated by the leaders of OCR were Richard Williams Morgan and Charles Isaac Stevens, both of these consecrations being on 6 March 1879. Morgan had previously (1874) been consecrated by Jules Ferrette. Morgan joined in the consecration of Stevens on 6 March 1879, as principal consecrator. Successors to Lee, Mossman and Seccombe Mossman died in 1889, Seccombe in 1895 and Lee in 1902. It was 1912 before the Order was revived. However, prior to their deaths, Lee, Mossman and Seccombe (acting together) had consecrated Henry Arthur Stanton (1839-1913), Percy Dearmer (1867-1936) and Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare (1856-1924). On 1 November 1909, Conybeare, assisted by Stanton and Dearmer, consecrated Arnold Harris Mathew. (Note: Mathew had previously (1908) been consecrated by Gerardus Gul, Old Catholic archbishop of Utrecht).

History =The Great Northern Telegraph Company= Great Northern Telegraph Company building, Kongens Nytorv, Copenhagen, built 1893 The company was founded as The Great Northern Telegraph Company (Det Store Nordiske Telegrafselskab A/S) in Denmark in June 1869. It was set up as a merger of three recently established telegraph companies initiated by Danish industrial mogul Carl Frederik Tietgen. The aim of the firm was to create a worldwide telegraph company. The Bund, Shanghai. The starting point of The Great Northern Telegraph Company (now GN Store Nord) was a concession agreement, which C.F. Tietgen made with the Russian Tzar in 1869. The agreement gave The Great Northern Telegraph Company exclusive rights ‚Äì and obligations ‚Äì to establish and run a telegraph line in Russia. This represented a great pioneer task for the company in establishing connections from Europe to the Far East. The Russian authorities ran the actual construction work in Russia. They had already set up a telegraph line in parts of Siberia but were looking for a business partner to cover China and Japan before continuing the Russian line all the way east to Vladivostok. Thus, The Great Northern Telegraph Company was given the responsibility to establish and run its own telegraph line in Asia, and additionally, assisting the Russians with operations, maintenance, technical assistance and education. In the following years, the telegraph line expanded massively ‚Äì both in Europe and in Asia. First, Oslo, London and Paris were covered. Later, operations took place along the coast of China ranging from Hong Kong to Shanghai and further into Japan where the first telegraph station opened in Nagasaki in 1897. In addition to the telegraph line, telegraph stations and offices opened at several locations. In 1897, negotiations began about a potential connection going from Scotland to the United States through the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland. In 1906, the cable was established, although without the final connection to the United States, which had to wait for almost 60 years to become a reality. When the transatlantic connection was finally established, however, it represented a remarkable expansion, which significantly facilitated communication between people around the world. The beginning of the 20th century was characterized by several wars and disputes, which affected the company's operations. World War I and largely the Russian Revolution changed the map of Europe, but this only meant an increase in demand for telegraphy. Thus, the company succeeded in prolonging its concession agreement in 1921, signed by Lenin. The 1920s and the early 1930s represented great decades for The Great Northern Telegraph Company as it had managed to acquire a reputation as being one of the leading international telecommunication companies in the world. The late 1930s, however, presented great challenges as competition from wireless telegraphy was becoming increasingly severe. In addition, World War II caused great damage to the telegraph lines around the world, which meant that in 1945 the company had only two lines left; the England-Faroes-Iceland line and the Sweden-Finland line. Although broken lines were repaired and re-established after the war the company had to acknowledge that an era was over. Thus, the new strategy was to focus on a broader segment by investing in various companies across sectors. This strategy was initiated in 1939 with the investment in the battery factory Hellesens. Over the following decades, The Great Northern Telegraph Company balanced between investing in the telecommunications industry and other industries. On the industry side, it invested in companies such as Lauritz Knudsen, which produced electrical goods, and in 1947, the radiotelephone production company Storno (a contraction of Store Nordiske (Great Northern)) was founded. Other acquisitions were Telematic which produced telephones, Elmi which produced measuring equipment and Danavox which produced hearing aids. =GN Store Nord= In 1985, The Great Northern Telegraph Company changed its name to GN Store Nord (GN = Great Nordic) with the aim of creating a new group identity and organizing its businesses. In this process, all subsidiaries were renamed to include GN: GN Danavox, GN NetTest, GN Automatic etc. A major change happened in 1991 when GN was assigned the attractive GMS concession from the national Danish telecommunication authorities. In March 1992, GN's new subsidiary Sonofon opened the first private mobile telephone network in Denmark. Although GN was not the only investor in Sonofon, it owned the majority of the shares. With the blossoming of the data communications and telephony industry, and a charismatic CEO J√∏rgen Lindegaard, GN was back on track and enjoyed massive success in the late 1990s. In 2000, the company sold Sonofon to Norwegian telecom operator Telenor for a price of DKK 14,7 billion. A large amount was invested in the GN subsidiary NetTest, which had evolved from the former Elmi and considered GN's prospective core business. It was decided to let NetTest acquire the French company Photonetics for a price of DKK 9,1 billion. The optimistic view of the future was also reflected in the share price which had increased fivefold in only one year from September 1, 1999 to September 1, 2000. The focus and investment in NetTest, however, resulted in a serious downturn since GN had misjudged the market development of NetTest's products. In 2001, net profit ended at DKK -9,2 billion followed by a share price decline equivalent to previous years‚Äô gains. Thereby major parts of the yield from Sonofon was lost within one year, and shareholders were raging in the media and at the annual general meeting. The following years‚Äô turbulence led to the company selling most of its subsidiaries and leaving Tietgen's old headquarters from 1893 at Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. GN Store Nord's headquarter currently resides in Ballerup North of Copenhagen, Denmark. GN continued focusing on its two core businesses; hearing aids and headsets, produced by GN Hearing and GN Audio respectively. On October 2, 2006, GN announced its decision to divest GN Hearing (formerly GN ReSound) and GN Otometrics (a company producing audio measuring equipment) to Swiss competitor Sonova (formerly known as Phonak). The deal, however, was annulled after being blocked by the German Cartel Office. After this, GN announced that it intended to keep the two companies but filed an appeal against the court ruling. The case is still pending. The blocked deal, however, left GN challenged to the extreme with two underperforming businesses, a thin product pipeline, a heavy debt position and facing a highly adverse macroeconomic environment. Nonetheless, with comprehensive restructuring and management efforts the company managed to survive. Since then, GN has gradually fought its way back. In 2009, GN Audio (then GN Netcom) made a decision to globally market all its products under the same brand; Jabra (a company that GN had acquired in 2000). The purpose of consolidating all products under the same brand was to strengthen the company's position as the world's leading supplier of headsets. Today, GN Audio is a world leader in Unified Communications headsets, and within the last couple of years the company has managed to be the first at introducing a number of innovative products on the market. In 2014, the company launched the world's first sports headset with a built-in heart rate monitor. In addition, a series of noise cancellation headsets with a concentration zone has been launched, which are specially designed to improve employees‚Äô ability to concentrate in noisy open offices. GN Hearing also got back on track. In 2010, the company revolutionized the industry by launching the world's first hearing aid with 2.4 GHz technology ‚Äì a new wireless technology that was groundbreaking compared to the previous inductive technology. In 2014, GN Hearing changed the industry once more with the introduction of the world's first Made for iPhone hearing aid, which based on the 2.4 GHz technology enables the streaming of sound directly from an iPhone without any body-worn devices. In October 2016, GN Audio acquired VXi Corporation, the manufacturer of both the VXi and BlueParrott headset brands. Products are to be rebranded Jabra. Since the end of 2008, GN's share price has increased by almost 1200% (December 2014). Business Today, GN Store Nord is a manufacturer of hearing instruments under the GN Hearing brand and a manufacturer of headsets under the Jabra brand in its GN Audio division. Stock listing GN is listed on NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen (ISIN code DK0010272632). Headquarters This company's headquarters is located at Lautrupbjerg 7 in Ballerup near Copenhagen.

Early Life and Bonfire  Deisinger was born in Nuremberg, Germany on 23 April 1966. His pre-teen obsession with learning how to play guitar eventually became a full-fledged pursuit of becoming a rock star. When it became clear he had a genuine chance of realizing his dream, Deisinger quit his apprenticeship as an electrician to devote himself to music full-time.Deisinger, J. & Begai, C. (2008), Fire And Fame, BOD Publishing GmbH, Deisinger joined German hard rock band as a bassist Cacumen in 1985, which would change its name to Bonfire in May 1986 in the interest of having a catchier moniker to push their new album, Don't Touch the Light. The name was suggested by Deisinger and after some consideration replaced Cacumen. He recorded four albums with the band ‚Äì Don't Touch the Light (1986), Fireworks (1987), Point Blank (1989), and Knock Out (1991).http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bio/index.jsp?JSESSIONID=J2kJJJtSFHRmTJzGmkwL0F1ZprwnZBRpJspLhlcYTL09W8cmtzSF!-1987743480&pid;=10190&aid;=163524 During his time with the band touring Europe extensively with acts such as Victory, Krokus, ZZ Top and Judas Priest. They sold almost 750,000 albums over a four-year period even though the North American market failed to embrace Bonfire as Europe had. Deisinger played his last show with Bonfire on 29 July 1994. On 3 July 1996, a one-time one-payment offer was made by Claus Lessmann and original Bonfire guitarist Hans Ziller to buy the band name back from Deisinger, guitarist Angel Schleifer and drummer Edgar Patrik, as the trio had no desire to resurrect Bonfire.  After Bonfire  Deisinger went on to record two albums with Paul Sabu (self-titled ‚Äì 1996, Between The Light ‚Äì 1998). In 1999 he formed Soul Doctor with Fair Warning singer Tommy Heart, and while the band's 2001 self-titled debut held promise, the 2003 follow-up, Systems Go Wild, suffered from creative differences between Deisinger and Heart. Following its release, Deisinger left the band in April 2003. In 2003 Deisinger received a Gold record for Bonfire's Fireworks album, which had officially sold 250,000 copies in Germany alone, since its 1987 release. Deisinger relocated to Thailand in 2004. In addition to doing occasional live gigs as a session player, he opened an English school in Sichon with his girlfriend. In December of that year, the last minute cancellation of a planned Christmas vacation to Koh Phi Phi Don ultimately saved Deisinger's life; the tsunami that decimated parts of Thailand, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia on 26 December 2004 laid waste to the resort where he was supposed to be staying. On 17 March 2005 Deisinger returned to Nuremberg, Germany and started working as a freelance photographer, eventually founding Deisinger Photography, which specializes in wedding, travel and event photographs and portfolios.http://www.joergdeisinger.com  Fire And Fame  In 2005 Deisinger approached Canadian music journalist and writer Carl Begai about co-writing his memoirs, which focused on his Bonfire career.

The two floors that house the collection of jewels have an entrance independent from that of the museum, and can therefore be visited separately. The exhibition, includes the thirty-seven jewels in gold and precious stones from the old Owen Cheatham collection, two jewels made later, and the twenty-seven drawings and paintings on paper that Salvador Dal√≠ made in designing the jewels. The whole forms an extensive collection of works carried out by the artist between 1941 and 1970, providing a perfect illustration of the various phases of his artistic development. With the consultancy and supervision of the Spanish Gemmology Association, the collection was acquired by the Gala-Salvador Dal√≠ Foundation from a Japanese organisation in 1999. Since that time, the Association‚Äôs experts, in collaboration with technicians from the Foundation‚Äôs Conservation Department and the Dal√≠ Study Centre, have been cataloguing each of the pieces and designing a permanent exhibition for them. History The history of these jewels started in 1941. The first 22 were acquired by the US millionaire Cummins Catherwood. Salvador Dal√≠ made the designs for the pieces on paper, with all kinds of details and great precision of shapes, materials and colours, while they were made up in New York by the team of the Argentinean- born silversmith Carlos Alemany under the close supervision of the artist himself. In 1958 they were acquired by The Owen Cheatham Foundation, a prestigious US foundation created in 1934 that lent the jewel collection out so that various charitable, educational and cultural organisations could raise funds by exhibiting it, and finally deposited it at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. Dal√≠, in collaboration with the Dutch American framemaker Henry Heydenryk, Jr. and Alemany, created special settings and illuminated frames for a traveling exhibition of the jewels sponsored by the Cheatham Foundation. The collection of jewels had already been exhibited temporarily at the Dal√≠ Theatre-Museum in Figueres during the months of August and September 1973, a year before the Museum was inaugurated and while the Master was still alive. In 1981 the collection was acquired by a Saudi multimillionaire, and later by three Japanese entities, the last of which agreed to sell it to the Gala-Salvador Dal√≠ Foundation. Collection All the pieces in the collection are unique items, and the combination of materials, dimensions and shapes used by Salvador Dal√≠ make this a one-off set in which the artist managed to express in a unique way the wealth of his singular iconography. Gold, platinum, precious stones (diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, aquamarines, topazes, etc.), pearls, corals and other noble materials combine to form hearts, lips, eyes, plant and animal forms, religious and mythological symbols and anthropomorphic forms. As well as designing the forms of the jewels, Salvador Dal√≠ personally selected each of the materials used, not only for their colours or value but also for their meaning and the symbolic connotations of each and every one of the previous stones and noble metals. Some of the jewels that form part of this collection, such as The Eye of Time (1949), Royal Heart (1953), or The Space Elephant (1961), have become key works and are considered to be as exceptional as some of his paintings.

Daniel was introduced as a general practitioner at The Mill on 9 July 2007. His storylines in the programme have included his relationship with Zara Carmichael (Elisabeth Dermot Walsh), becoming a father, briefly going to prison, and becoming a partner at The Mill. Storylines Daniel arrives hiding dangerous secrets, following the theft of a large sum of money from his former practice partner in London. He uses the money to clear part of a ¬£200,000 debt he had run up as a result of an ongoing gambling addiction. With no intention of facing up to his problem, his addiction continues to spiral out of control, resulting in a confrontation with his criminal debtors. The criminals' actions worsen when they take Melody Bell (Elizabeth Bower) and Joe Fenton (Stephen Boxer) hostage to force Daniel to repay them. Following the ordeal, Daniel comes to terms with his addiction and turns himself in to the police. He is faced with a tribunal. Daniel goes through further turmoil as his mentally ill colleague Ruth Pearce (Selina Chilton) holds him captive in the medical centre's sick bay. Daniel makes an escape attempt and injures his leg, cutting it on the glass from a window. When a new nurse, Cherry Malone (Sophie Abelson), begins working at the practice, Daniel finds himself growing attracted to her, and the pair later have sex, despite Cherry's husband Jimmi (Adrian Lewis Morgan) being a colleague of Daniel's. It was during this time that Daniel discovers that one of his patients, Cybil, has died, leaving him a large amount of money in her will. Daniel spends this money on a high-end sports car and a luxury apartment. Zara Carmichael (Elisabeth Dermot Walsh) comes over to his flat, but she ends the relationship within the same day, stating that they needed to get it out of the way before they could work together. A story is sold to the Letherbridge newspaper about Daniel conning Cybil. Julia Parsons (Diane Keen) sees it and calls a meeting with Lily Hassan (Seeta Indrani) and Heston Carter (Owen Brenman); Daniel claims that he shouldn't have to apologise because the money was a gift; however, Lily insists that he should. With the backing of the partners, Daniel opened the Granger Clinic, a botox clinic which is run within The Mill. Daniel is enrolled on a team building course with Zara by Julia, after she is fed up with constantly seeing Daniel and Zara arguing at the surgery. At the session, he tries his best to comfort Zara when the whole class was assigned to tell each other about their personal lives. She talks emotionally about her father and his imprisonment, and that she is helping him battle to prove his innocence of manslaughter. They got very close and nearly kissed. Zara sleeps with Daniel numerous times, and she pretends to be his girlfriend so Daniel could have access to his daughter. Afterwards, Daniel takes Zara bowling and they become a couple. In October 2010, Zara starts having hot flushes and menopausal symptoms. At first, he asks if she is pregnant, but she lies and said it was probably just premenstrual syndrome. Zara later comes clean about the menopause, thinking Daniel wants to end their relationship. Misreading the situation, she ended it first. Daniel trapped Zara in her office and they got back together. They were seen leaving The Mill holding hands. Daniel later dumps Zara for Lisa Torres (Michelle Lukes), leaving Zara devastated. Daniel does not appear happy with Lisa, and in April 2011, Daniel and Zara get back together. Later that month, Lisa leaves Letherbridge, meaning that Daniel only sees his daughter Izzie Torres (Jasmin and Nicole Parkinson) every other weekend. In 2011, Daniel and Zara try in vitro fertilisation. They are left devastated when they discover it did not work, and Zara is not pregnant. However, she later discovers that she is pregnant. On 13 February 2012, Zara went into early labour at The Mill. Daniel was unaware of this as he had gone to town with Jimmi. Daniel was driven back to The Mill and held his newborn baby boy for the first time. Daniel, his baby and Zara were taken to hospital. Following a phone call from Joe, the couple decided to name their son Joe Granger Carmichael (Emily and Lewis Whitehouse). In 2018, Daniel finds Zara having sex with Sid Vere (Ashley Rice). Daniel attempts to get over it and continue his marriage with Zara, but when Zara slaps Izzie (now Bethan Moore), he ends their relationship. In 2019, he begins a relationship with Practice Manager Becky Clarke (Ali Bastian). However, while attending a medical conference at a hotel alongside Zara, the pair sleep together. Becky later reveals to Daniel that she is pregnant, and he is the father. When she miscarries the baby and expresses an interest in trying again for a child, Daniel tells her that he does not want to have another child. He later tells Becky that he is not over Zara, and confesses that he slept with her at the conference. Becky ends the relationship with Daniel, and finds a new job in order to escape the tension. As a result of the breakup, Jimmi suggests that Daniel should attend therapy, to which he begins attending. One of the issues that is brought up in therapy is that Daniel is worried about the environment for the sake of his children.

Biography Uggla was born in the village of Afverstad in √ñlseruds parish, V√§rmland, the son of Colonel Johan Uggla and Margareta Gyllenm√§rs.Hofberg (1906), p.651 As a young man he was a page at the royal court. During the Torstenson War of 1643-1645 he served as a volunteer in the navy, seeing action in the fleet under the command of Clas Fleming. From 1646 Uggla served in the Swedish army. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Prague in 1648, and was promoted to captain lieutenant. In 1650, he was promoted to captain in the Life Guards, accompanying Charles X during the Second Northern War. When the Dano-Swedish War broke out in 1657 Uggla returned to naval service. He was promoted to major and in November 1658 participated in the Battle of the Sound against the Dutch fleet. In 1660, he was promoted to lieutenant admiral. During a three-year stay in L√ºbeck, he oversaw the construction of warships being built for the Swedish Navy. In 1670 he was promoted to admiral, and in 1676 was elevated to the status of Friherre. When further conflict broke out in 1675 in the Scanian War, Uggla was given command of a squadron under Generalamiral Lorentz Creutz.Hofberg (1906), p.652 =Battle of √ñland= On 1 June 1676, during the Battle of √ñland, against the allied Danish and Dutch fleets under Niels Juel and Cornelis Tromp, Creutz's flagship Kronan capsized, as a result of intemperately turning hard south, even though under full sail with open cannon ports. The Swedish fleet's line of battle was thrown into confusion, and the enemy, taking advantage of the situation, surrounded Uggla's 94-gun flagship Sv√§rdet. He found himself attacked by four enemy vessels simultaneously, including both the Danish and Dutch flagships. After a fierce battle lasting two hours Uggla's ship was dismasted and holed below the waterline. Uggla finally surrendered to Tromp, but a Dutch fire ship failed to recognize that the ship had surrendered and attacked, and Uggla was killed when his ship blew up. Only 51 of the 670 crew survived.

He later served as the Agent for the United States Department of War for the Southwest Territory (later Tennessee) in the 1790s. Life and career Henley was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, the eldest child of Samuel and Elizabeth Cheever Henley.Mary Rothrock, The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), pp. 426-8. On January 8, 1776, he set fire to Charlestown which was occupied by the British. In that same year, he served a brigade-major under General William Heath, and briefly as an adjutant general under General Joseph Spencer. On January 1, 1777, he was made lieutenant colonel of the Fifth Massachusetts Regiment. He was in command at Cambridge, Massachusetts, when the troops that had been captured at Saratoga were brought there. Henley stabbed an insolent but unarmed British prisoner. Court-martial proceedings were held at Cambridge from January 20, 1778, to February 25, 1778, but he was acquitted. British General Burgoyne challenged him to a duel, which was to take place in Bermuda. He accepted the challenge, but the duel never took place. General Washington selected him in November 1778 to be his spymaster, and charged him with compiling information to give him a snapshot of British capabilities. He largely succeeded in that task. Henley retired from the Army the following year. In 1793, Colonel Henley was appointed by President Washington as the Agent of the Department of War for the Southwest Territory, in Knoxville, Tennessee. In this capacity, he was Superintendent of Indian Affairs, as well as quartermaster and paymaster for locally stationed troops and militia. He was known to be a hothead, but was also a strong law-and-order man. Tennessee's Constitutional Convention was held in his office at the corner of what is now Gay Street and Church Avenue in Downtown Knoxville in 1796. He died in Washington, D.C., in 1823, while a clerk in the War Department. Legacy In 1994, the Knoxville Federal Courthouse was proposed the site of his office. However it was later constructed at the northwest corner of Main Street and Gay Street. Both Henley Street and the Henley Street Bridge (or Henley Bridge) in Downtown Knoxville are named after him. A tablet was placed by the state of Tennessee at the location of his office in 1947.

A single- engined biplane, the Gloster IV was a development of the earlier Gloster III intended to compete in the 1927 Schneider Trophy race. One aircraft competed in the race, but retired part way through. The three aircraft built continued to be used as trainers by the High Speed Flight for several years. Design and development To compete for the 1927 Schneider Trophy, Britain's Air Ministry was determined to improve Britain's performance for the last few competitions, with British entries being soundly beaten by American Curtiss floatplanes in 1923 and 1925, and failing to even enter the 1926 competition which was won by the Italian Macchi M.39. To improve on this disappointing state of affairs, the Air Ministry placed orders for designs of high speed floatplanes from Gloster, Supermarine (the S.5) and Shorts (the Crusader).Mondey 1981, p.43. Gloster's design, the Gloster IV was a development of the Gloster III which had finished second in the 1925 race. Henry Folland, the Chief designer of Gloster, redesigned the aircraft to reduce drag. Like its predecessors, the Gloster IV was of wooden construction, with a monocoque fuselage and single bay wings. Both the upper and lower wings were gulled to allow the drag of the wing/fuselage junction to be minimised, while radiators were built into the surfaces of the wings and floats.James 1971, pp.150‚Äì152. Three aircraft were built, differing in the surface area of the wings and the arrangement of the tail. Operational history The three Gloster IVs were first flown in July‚ÄìAugust 1927, with the two short-span aircraft (the Gloster IVA and IVB) being shipped to Venice in August 1927. The Gloster IVB was finally chosen to compete with the two S.5s in the race, the Crusader having crashed due to having its control cables crossed on re- assembly.James 1971, p.153.Mondey 1981, p.40. On the day of the race, 26 September 1927, the Gloster IVB, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Samuel Kinkead was the first aircraft to take off, completing five laps before retiring, with the race being won by Flight Lieutenant Sidney Webster flying the S.5. On inspection, it was found that the Gloster's propeller shaft was seriously cracked and would probably have failed if Kinkead had not retired.James 1971, p.154. Following the race, the Gloster IVA and IVB were returned to the United Kingdom, where they were modified to improve the pilot's view by raising the upper wing and used as high speed trainers. They were used to train pilots for the 1929 race, with the IVB crashing during a landing accident in December 1930 and the IVA used again as a trainer for the 1931 race. The original Gloster IV was meanwhile sold with the intention of being converted to a landplane and used in attempt on the world air speed record but these plans came to nothing.

It grows natively in Pakistan and southwestern China (Yunnan) through tropical Asia to Australia (Queensland and New South Wales) and the Pacific islands of New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Lord Howe Island. Description It grows as a bushy tree to , often with a sparse canopy. The trunk has smooth grey-brown bark and reaches a maximum diameter of with some buttressing. The shiny green ovate to elliptical leaves measure in length, and in width, and have a pointed (acuminate) end. The blue-black fruit are oval and measure 0.8‚Äì1.2 (0.3‚Äì0.5 in) cm long. They are ripe from May to September. It resembles the introduced and weedy African olive Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata, but the latter lacks O. paniculata's small depressions between the main and secondary veins on the back of the leaf. The introduced species is found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waterways. Taxonomy One of many species first described by Robert Brown in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae, it still bears its original binomial name. Other common names include Australian olive, pigeonberry ash, maulwood, and clove berry. In Chinese, it is called ËÖ∫Âè∂Êú®ÁäÄÊ¶Ñ (). The specific name is derived from the Latin panicula \\"tuft\\", from the arrangement of flowers. Distribution and habitat Olea paniculata is found from North East Queensland to the vicinity of the Hunter Region in New South Wales. In Australia it is found near watercourses in dry rainforests. Outside Australia it is found in Yunnan province in southwestern China, where it occurs in sheltered wetter valleys in altitude, as well as India, Indonesia, Kashmir, Malaysia, Nepal, New Guinea, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. On Lord Howe Island it is widespread below around elevation. It is also found on New Caledonia and Vanuatu. Ecology The fruit are consumed by the Australian king parrot, brown cuckoo-dove, topknot pigeon, rose-crowned fruit-dove, wompoo fruit-dove, white-headed pigeon, green catbird and regent bowerbird in Australia.

Presumably constructed in the 4th century AD, it belonged in Ottoman times to the important road to Gallipoli on the Dardanelles. The structure was praised by early European travellers for its fine construction and marble facing, but was plundered for building material during the 19th century.  Exploration  The White Bridge was first mentioned by Edmund Chishull in 1699, who found it still intact. Later visitors included William Turner in 1815, Pyotr Chikhachyov in 1847 and Arthur W. Janke in the 1890s, who all judged the structure to be of ancient origin. Turner described a very magnificent Roman bridge of brick and small stones with retaining walls of fine marble. It consisted of eight arches, the largest four spanning the river, flanked by two smaller openings at each bank. The span of the largest vault was eighteen paces, its width eight. Small arched chambers immediately under the pavement reduced the load of the bridge; similar relieving chambers also appear in neighbouring ancient bridges such as the Makestos Bridge and the Aesepus Bridge, leading Frederick William Hasluck to postulate a common origin under the reign of emperor Constantine (‚Ä† 337 AD). Eighty years later, Janke could still identify several semi-circular arches at the left bank, along with piers featuring polished ashlar of 100 √ó 50 cm, as characteristically for Roman bridge building. Hardly a decade later, however, Hasluck essentially only found a tile-vaulted arch of the western abutment and an adjoining pier, the bridge having been plundered in the meantime for building material for the Karabogha‚ÄìBoghashehr () road.

Tryon gave her support to a number of charities including SANE‚Äîthe mental health charity of which she was the chairman.  Biography  = Early life = Born Dale Elizabeth Harper in Melbourne, Australia, she was the eldest of three children of a wealthy printing magnate. In early childhood Dale was diagnosed with Perthes disease, which affects the hip joint, and from which she suffered until the age of nine, spending time in a children's hospital in irons, from feet to chest. On her graduation, she worked in London as a public relations officer for the airline Qantas. = Marriage and friendship with Prince Charles = An active socialite described by family and friends as having \\"tremendous joie de vivre,\\" within two weeks of arriving in England she had met Anthony Tryon, 3rd Baron Tryon, who was a member of Prince Charles's inner circle. It was through her husband that she first met the Prince of Wales. Dale and Anthony married in 1973, and had four children: Zo√´, Charles, and twins Edward and Victoria. She and Prince Charles both enjoyed fly fishing, which they undertook regularly, and he publicly described Kanga as \\"the only woman who ever understood me.\\" = Businesses = In 1983, Dale started a fashion business called Kanga, located in Beauchamp Place, Knightsbridge. Launched through a personal television appearance on the ITV1 show This Morning (which was hosted by her friends Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan), Dale persuaded Diana to wear a Kanga dress to the Live Aid concert. Kanga quickly became a favourite of the Sloane Ranger set, and became a successful international business. Dale lived in both London and Lord Tryon's family home, the 18th-century Manor House at Great Durnford, near Salisbury. From the early 1980s her clothes were sold in shops in England, America, Australia, France and Spain, and her own boutique in Knightsbridge was later joined by branches in Salisbury, Hong Kong and Dublin. Both \\"Kanga\\" and her couture line named \\"The Dale Tryon Collection\\" were very successful. = Health = Some reports state that after the birth of her twins, Dale suffered from a recurrent bout of spina bifida, during the treatment for which it was discovered she was suffering from cancer of the uterus in 1993. However, spina bifida is a physical deformity of the spine ‚Äì a permanent condition ‚Äì and is not suffered in 'bouts'. It is more likely that her health suffered from her known diagnosis of Legg‚ÄìCalv√©‚ÄìPerthes disease. After this point she travelled for a period with a nurse, a physiotherapist, and her daughter, Zo√´, who would lie next to her as she slept, rolling her over regularly. Soon after she received the 'all clear' from cancer, Tryon underwent treatment at Farm Place, an alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinic in Surrey. She was on a heavy dose of painkillers, and drank excessive quantities of vodka and champagne. While undergoing treatment for addiction at the clinic, she fell (some say she jumped) from a first-floor window, broke her back and was paralysed. Tryon was left a paraplegic from her fall, and even after spending more than a year in spinal rehab she never walked again. = Divorce = Suffering from recurring depression, and after being told by her husband that he wanted a divorce, she was detained on 17 June 1997 under the Mental Health Act for 28 days, after leaving the Black Horse Inn in Great Durnford. After release from the spinal injuries unit at Salisbury District Hospital, she returned home. After her divorce she renounced her title, and moved into The Ritz hotel, from where she gave her last recorded interview with journalist Christopher Wilson.  Death  On her return from a trip to Australia and India, Tryon was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital, Westminster, suffering from complications from severe bed sores. Tryon died there on 15 November 1997 from septicaemia, aged 49. She was buried four days later in England, and in her will left her ¬£1.3 million estate to her children.  Legacy  On 4 November 2008, Tryon was the subject of a documentary, Prince Charles' Other Mistress, aired by Channel 4.

He was born in 1530 and died in Spain in 1585. Baltinglass's family was traditionally associated with the FitzGerald family, the earls of Kildare, but prudently remained loyal to Henry VIII during the \\"Silken Thomas\\" Rebellion of 1534-35. For their loyalty they were granted additional lands. Later in the 1540s Thomas FitzEustace, James's grandfather, was created first Viscount Baltinglass by a grateful king. But like many other old English Pale families, the FitzEustaces later became disillusioned. Baltinglass's circle included Pale families of Plunkett, Dillon, Aylmer, Fitzsimon, Sedgrave and Nugent. Within this circle discontent increased and the Baltinglass revolt was first conceived. Previously for airing his views James had earned a night in jail, a sermon, a fine and the lasting enmity of Archbishop Adam Loftus of Dublin. James Eustace was educated at Grey's Inn, the most prestigious of the Inns of Court in London, and lived in Rome during the 1570s. James had as his tutor an influential priest, Sir Norman Eustace and became a fervent Catholic who regarded Queen Elizabeth I as an illegitimate heretic. Generally the government viewed James as misguided, but not a threat. They were even dismissive of him, which echoed ironically after his revolt broke.  Marriage  He married Mary Travers, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Henry Travers of Monkstown Castle, only child of Sir John Travers, by Genet Preston, but they had no children. Henry predeceased his father. Mary died in 1610, having married secondly, in 1587, Sir Gerald Aylmer, Bart., of Donadea, a Catholic loyalist, repeatedly imprisoned, but finally released and knighted, by Elizabeth I and created baronet by James I of England. Sir John Travers of Monkstown (Carrickbrennan), Co. Dublin, was a connection of the Earl of Kildare. He was Master of the Ordnance and a Groom of the Chambers. He married Genet Preston, and during the period 1545 to 1551 received many grants of land, including Rathmore and part of Haynestown (east of Naas), Tomogue, and estates in Co. Carlow. In 1589 Mary petitioned for the return of part of her lands, which must have been extensive. With the assistance of Sir Gerald Aylmer, whom she later married, she obtained the re- possession of the Preceptory of Killerig, Co. Carlow. Soon after her death in 1610 this estate was shared between several grantees, but mainly Monkstown and its estates in seven counties were left to Henry Cheevers, her sister Katherine's second son.  Rebellion  James Eustace knew that he lacked the necessary military muscle, a suitable operational base and martial experience to be successful. He knew that if he acted independently, his revolt would be crushed easily. Baltinglass's partner in rebellion was Feagh - the son of Hugh Mac Shane O'Byrne who had at one time inflicted defeat on Roland FitzEustace, Baltinglass's father, in a border encounter to be celebrated in verse eulogizing Hugh's military prowess. This did not, however, prevent the alliance of their sons. Feagh O'Byrne and Baltinglass proved useful partners in rebellion, each bringing different qualities and assets beneficial to the rebellion's initial success. Feagh provided the military leadership and drew to his standard much of Gaelic Leinster who viewed him as their protector. Baltinglass's championing of the Catholic cause gave the revolt the extra dimension which the government so feared. Without Baltinglass's involvement and the Catholic element to the revolt, the uprising would have been looked upon purely as a Gaelic outbreak. It would not have received any significant aid from Catholic Palesmen. The coming together of the pragmatic Gaelic malcontent and the idealistic Catholic magnate was a new and dangerous development in the history of rebellion against the Crown in Ireland. What this union symbolized is what frightened the government. It was a sign of things to come. In 1576, before the death of his father, James Eustace lodged complaints against the persecution of Catholics and illegal taxation of the Lord Deputy, Sir Henry Sydney. He and other leading Catholics were imprisoned in 1577, and he was released only just in time to assume his title the next year. Much of their resentment was directed against policies pursued by the Elizabethan officials. To finance military campaigns against Gaelic lords and rebellious Anglo-Irish magnates, the government levied a military tax, known as the cess, upon Palesmen. Troops were also billeted upon their lands. This drew increasingly vociferous complaints from both the Pale's gentry and the towns' merchants. Before Baltinglass's rebellion their discontent was rife. This Pale community opposed government demands on their assets to maintain its military policy. Viscount Roland, James's father, was a prominent leader. With other leaders, he was imprisoned in the closing years of the 1570s by the Elizabethan administration who viewed their opposition as little short of treason. Such action on the government's part only increased its unpopularity. The predominant Pale faith was Catholic. In Catholic eyes there was a growing threat from the Protestant-dominated government, a perception supported by their marked decline in participation within the kingdom's government. English-born Protestants increasingly occupied positions of authority. These government officers found the concept of being Catholic and loyal irreconcilable. Tension was fuelled by Pius V's excommunication of Elizabeth in 1570. With growing regularity sons of Catholic Pale families withdrew from English universities and pursued their education in Catholic Europe. Within the walls of these continental colleges, Catholic Counter-Reformation dogma and doctrine dominated. Young Palesmen were profoundly affected by their exposure. Their education made them more militant on their return. In 1579, Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, took up arms in Munster for a second time against the Queen, who appointed Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond to deal with the rebellion. This he eventually did, but with ruthless and terrible severity. During the summer of 1580, James Eustace, Viscount Baltinglass, apparently prompted almost entirely by religious motives, collected rebel forces in County Wicklow, with the goal to assist Desmond. His allies included many influential Catholics, some of them his own relatives, and large numbers of Irish clansmen led by Fiach McHugh O'Byrne. News of this soon reached the ears of Ormonde, James Eustace‚Äôs brother-in-law, (Edmund Butler, brother of the Earl of Ormonde, had married Eleanor Eustace, Baltinglass's sister) who must have sent him a severe warning, for we have Baltinglass's defiant reply, later produced in evidence against him. At first the revolt was remarkably successful, and on 25 August 1580, a severe defeat was inflicted upon the troops of the Lord Deputy at the Pass of Glenmalure in the Wicklow Mountains on the Baltinglass lands. The Annals of the Four Masters states that \\"the entire extent of country from the Slaney to the Shannon and from the Boyne to the meeting of the Three Waters became one scene of strife and dissension.‚Äù But Baltinglass never coordinated his efforts with those of Desmond, and in any case had started too late. There was desultory fighting for nearly a year, but with no large engagement, and the Baltinglass troops overran a large area doing great damage, but were then hopelessly overpowered. A force of Spaniards and Italians had landed at Smerwick, Co. Kerry, in order to assist the Catholic cause, but when they had completed the long march of 150 miles to Naas were taken prisoner and were massacred. The scene of this massacre, on the southern edge of the town, is still called Spaniards Cross or Foad Spaniagh.  Defeat & Exile  Baltinglass and his followers were outlawed and forty-five of them were hanged in Dublin. James Eustace escaped to Munster, where Desmond was still in revolt, and thence to Spain. He was well received, and only just failed to persuade King Philip II of Spain to provide sufficient troops and ships to invade Ireland. He died there childless in 1585. The fates of his five brothers were as follows: *1.Edmund Eustace had married Frances, daughter of Robert Pipho, and secondly Joan, daughter of Richard Walsh of Carrickmines, who afterwards married Dermot Kavanagh of Knockangary. In 1583 he escaped to Scotland and thence to Spain, where he was created ‚Äú4th Viscount\\" by the Pope. He served against England in the Armada in 1588, and died in Portugal in 1594.http://www.thepeerage.com/p7357.htm#i73566 *2. Thomas Eustace was executed in 1582. *3. William Eustace was certainly believed to have been slain in battle in 1581, for it was officially reported to Sir Francis Walsingham, Secretary of State in London, \\"Head of William Eustace, another of the Baltinglass brethren, taken this morning.\\" It is, possible however that this report was untrue and that he was the ancestor of the Eustaces of Robertstown whose distinguished line will be dealt with later. The Complete Peerage reports that William (4th son) was \\"slain in rebellion, 21 Apr. 1581.\\" Burke's Extinct Peerage1883 reports that William (3rd son) \\"had not been engaged in rebellion ... (and was) ... living as Viscount Baltinglass, in 1610.‚Äù *4.Walter Eustace was captured in 1583 and executed. *5.Richard Eustace was in Paris at the time of the rebellion, engaged in arranging for the dispatch of ammunition and supplies to assist his brothers. He became a priest in Rome. Among the other Eustaces from County Kildare who took part were Maurice of Castlemartin and Thomas of Kerdiffstown (near Sallins), who were both executed, and John of Newland and Oliver of Blackhall, Clane, who were eventually pardoned, as was Maurice FitzGerald of Osberstown, Naas, who was the husband of Baltinglass's aunt Janet. In 1585, the Statute of Baltinglass was passed by Parliament, but against considerable opposition. Under this Act, the title and arms were attainted, and all the vast Baltinglass possessions were forfeited, as was normal then, with retrospective clauses voiding all transfers of property that had taken place during the previous twelve years. The Eustaces of Harristown, once Lords of Portlester, Kilcullen and Baltinglass were thus virtually obliterated. James and his brothers had fought for what they were convinced was right, but they had failed, and for their failure they paid dearly. Whether James Eustace and his followers were traitors or martyrs, they were certainly brave men. At the time of the attainder, the Dowager Viscountess, once a proud Butler, but now the mother of ‚Äúthe six traitorous brethren,\\" petitioned (rather pathetically, and with what result we can well imagine) to be allowed to retain her jointure or alternatively to be granted somewhere to live. Almost all the forfeited estates were granted to Sir Henry Harrington who had been active in quelling the rebellion. He sold them in 1617 to Sir Charles Wilmot, from whom they passed, via Sir James Carroll and Sir Thomas Roper, to the Viscounts (later Earls) of Aldborough. Harristown, Rochestown and Calverstown were granted in about 1590 to John Eustace of Castlemartin. The Baltinglass, house in Dublin and a lease of New Abbey, Kilcullen, were granted to Edmund Spenser, the poet, who was Secretary to the Lord Deputy, Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton. Rathfarnham Castle and much of the land around Rathfarnham also belonged to the Eustace family of Baltinglass. However, this property was also confiscated for their part in the Second Desmond Rebellion of 1579-83. Rathfarnham castle and its lands were then granted to the Loftus family. The title was revived in 1685, when Colonel Richard Talbot, of Carton, was created Viscount Baltinglass, but he died without an heir six years later. It was again revived in 1763, when John Stratford was created Baron of Baltinglass, but he was advanced in 1776 to Viscount Aldborough and this title became extinct in 1875. The Eustaces of Castlemartin and Harristown were connected with his family twice. His father had married (as his second wife) Penelope n√©e Eustace, one of the three co-heiresses of Sir Maurice Eustace, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. His great-great-granddaughter, Louisa Saunders of Saunders Grove, married in 1860 Thomas Tickell, descendant and heir of Clotilda, Penelope's sister and another of the co-heiresses.

Subject to frequent complaints of police brutality, the squad was disbanded in 2006 following an investigation by the Victorian Office of Police Integrity.  Formation  The predecessor of the Armed Offenders Squad was the Armed Robbery Squad, a unit regularly accused of excessive force and violence. The 1979 Beach Inquiry found that the Armed Robbery Squad had committed \\"abuses... so grave as to warrant the most prompt institution of safeguarding reforms.\\".The Victorian Armed Offenders Squad ‚Äì A case study , Office of Police Integrity, 30 October 2008 In 1999 the Armed Robbery Squad, the Special Response Squad, and the Prison Squad were amalgamated to form the Armed Offenders Squad. At the time of its dissolution in 2006, the Squad was made up of 35 detectives.Hagan, Kate. \\"Ex-detectives admit to bashing suspect.\\" Age (Melbourne). 26 February 2008.  Internal culture  The Armed Offenders Squad had their own self-created logo of two golden revolvers with the barrels crossed. When the Squad would submit printed evidence to the Victorian Prosecutor, they superimposed the golden-revolver logo on top of the official Victoria Police badge symbol in contravention of Victorian Police regulations. All Squad members, including the squad's sole female member, adopted a uniform of black suits, white shirts, dark sunglasses and a team-issue black tie featuring the logo. The uniform was based on the clothes worn by the jewel-thieves in the film Reservoir Dogs. Understaffing meant that the Armed Offenders Squad rarely had a permanent supervisor, operating instead under a succession of acting managers and short-term appointees. The Office of Police Integrity's investigation found that \\"informal Squad culture ... gained such strength and impenetrability that the chain of command was effectively reversed, to the point where some Squad members considered themselves immune from managerial accountability or authority.\\" When, in 2003, a newly appointed Inspector drew up a comprehensive and detailed action plan to improve the day-to-day operations of the squad, his proposals were ignored until he was transferred out, at which point they were permanently shelved. When interviewed by the Office of Police Integrity, a former Squad manager said: \\"I‚Äôd rather see someone out getting complaints for working... You‚Äôre going to accumulate complaints if you work... sure you won‚Äôt get any if you just sit around and do nothing.\\" The Office of Police Integrity found that the Armed Offenders Squad were \\"contemptuous of the law\\", \\"divisive, insular, and exclusionary\\", and possessed an attitude of \\"elitist superiority within Victoria Police\\". Covert surveillance revealed that some members still identified with the disbanded Armed Robbery Squad, with Detective Mark Butterfield saying to a suspect \\"Welcome to the Armed Robbery Squad\\" before assaulting him. Armed Offenders Squad detective Graeme Head crashed his car in Mentone in 2001 after a night of drinking with Squad colleagues. When police arrived and attempted to give him a breathalyser test, Head fled the scene twice and was finally captured with the aid of police dogs. Tests revealed that his blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. When Head was found guilty of drink driving offences two years after the crash, Assistant Commissioner Simon Overland said \\"a lot has changed in two years\\" and that the Squad had been reformed since Head's crash.\\"Detective convicted over crash.\\" The Age. 8 March 2003 In October 2005, Detective Inspector Bernie Rankin was appointed to head the Squad. Rankin, former head of the homicide squad and investigator of the Russell Street Bombing, was specifically tasked with reducing the number of complaints the squad was generating. On his appointment, Rankin held a meeting with the Squad members, telling them that their performance had to improve, and that the Inspector had to be notified when prisoners arrived for interrogation. He also warned them that video equipment would be installed in the interview rooms, although this was not arranged for more than two years. Briefings were moved from the informal setting of the Squad kitchen to a new operations room, and new administrative procedures were introduced to make sure that management was informed of the activities of the officers. After this period, there were fewer complaints made against the squad.  Investigation  In July 2005, George Brouwer, the OPI's director, received a letter from a man claiming he had been punched, kicked, elbowed, thrown down a flight of stairs, choked unconscious, and strangled with a plastic bag over his head by three detectives from the Armed Offenders Squad.Hodgson, Shelley. \\"An unfamiliar role for crime fighters.\\" Herald Sun. 23 September 2006. Later that year the OPI began an investigation into the Squad, codenamed \\"Operation Air\\". An initial statistical analysis of complaints indicated an unusually high rate of allegations of violence against the AOS compared to similar squads. Investigators placed covert electronic surveillance equipment in the Armed Offenders Squad's interrogation room at the St Kilda Road Police Station.  Beating of suspect A100  The resulting secret footage revealed one suspect being told, prior to the commencement of a formal interview, that he was not allowed to request a lawyer and that if he did so, the formal audiotape of the interview would be erased and the interview would start afresh. The suspect was codenamed A100 and has been interrogated about the whereabouts of a shotgun used in robberies. A100 was held for six hours, during which he was not given anything to drink or allowed to use the toilet. During the interrogation he was dragged from his chair, assaulted by two officers, and punched and kicked until bloody while the officers yelled, between punches, \\"Fucking... Armed... Robbery... Squad\\". After the first assault on the suspect had already happened, Inspector Rankin entered the room for a supposed \\"welfare check\\". Rankin told the suspect: \\"It‚Äôs going to be a long hard day for you, pal. ... I suggest you listen to some of the advice that the boys are going to give you. It might be a lot less painful.\\" The six-hour detention yielded only fourteen minutes of formally taped interview. Detective Mark Butterfield was secretly taped punching the suspect in his ear, which began to bleed, and threatening that the ear would \\"come off\\" by the end of the interrogation. Towards the conclusion of the interview, the suspect asked whether he could make a telephone call, for which he was beaten with a telephone by Detective Robert Dabb who said: \\"Here it is, here's your fucking phone call... piece of shit.\\"  Dissolution and aftermath  In June 2006, the Squad's offices were raided by the OPI. At the time of the investigation, the powerful police union, the Police Association, was headed by Paul Mullett, a former Armed Robbery Squad detective. After the raid, he called for the OPI to be disbanded, calling the investigation a \\"disgrace\\".\\"Vic Police Association urge OPI shutdown.\\" Lynn Bell. PM ‚Äì Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 6 July 2006. Transcript. On 13 September 2006, Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon called a meeting with the Squad's members to announce that the unit was being disbanded. The meeting was covertly recorded and its content leaked to the Herald Sun. The leaker also supplied the Herald Sun with a poem written by a Squad detective, \\"Ode to the Armed Offenders Squad\\", which ran in part: > They‚Äôve done a good job, the bosses will say, but know that will last but > for a day. Because some have complained a door was broken, a dog was kicked > and neighbours awoken. But the crim is in the A.O.S. say, the bosses are > angry; two complainants today. So long as there‚Äôs bad crooks, they‚Äôll need > us around, if they‚Äôre rid of us then crime will abound. Six days later, at a public hearing, Squad detectives Robert Lachlan Dabb, Mark Harrison Butterfield and Matthew Adrian Franc were shown videotape of themselves beating A100. Dabb collapsed in the witness stand when the video was shown. [Hagan, Kate. \\"Ex-detectives admit to bashing suspect.\\" Age (Melbourne). 26 Feb 2008.] All three claimed not to recognise themselves on the video and denied any involvement in the beating. They were suspended the next day. In response, the Police Association led a rally in Batman Park, which was attended by about 300 police and former members of the Squad, including Dabb, Butterfield, and Franc. The gathering passed resolutions calling for the Squad to be reinstated, for Christine Nixon to resign, and for the OPI to be disbanded. Police Association secretary Paul Mullett told the rally that disbanding the squad would lead to \\"what's currently occurring in NSW: drive-by shootings, ethnic gangs, race gangs, youth gangs, street gangs, gang rapes by the day\\".\\"Sack Nixon, cops demand OPI hearing an \`inquisition'\\" Herald Sun 23 September 2006 Eventually, Victoria Police guaranteed that the Squad members who were not charged would be guaranteed jobs in the Squad's replacement, the Armed Crime Task Force.Armed Offenders Squad officers' jobs guaranteed.\\" ABC Premium News (Australia). 6 October 2006. In May 2007, Detective Inspector Bernie Rankin was charged with counselling or procuring the commission of an assault. Dabb, Butterfield and Franc were charged with unlawful assault and lying to the OPI. The charges against Rankin were later dropped.\\"Vic: Charges dropped against police officer.\\" Australian Associated Press. 9 October 2007. Dabb, Butterfield, and Franc initially seemed likely to fight the charges but later pleaded guilty to assaulting the suspect.\\"Ex- police avoid jail.\\" Herald Sun. 28 May 2008. Dabb and Butterfield received sentences of ten weeks of community service. Franc was sentenced to five weeks. With the criminal proceedings finalised, the OPI published its report on the Armed Offenders Squad in October 2008. The report found that replacing the Armed Offenders Squad with an Armed Crime Task Force had increased the percentage of crimes solved from 47% to 80%, and reduced the average number of annual complaints from 10 to less than 1. The report also recommended that video cameras be placed in all Victoria Police vehicles, due to numerous allegations of assaults taking place while suspects were being transported, and that suspects be videotaped from the moment of their arrival at the police station. It was concluded that the Squad was a \\"cultural relic\\" and that its members had \\"[drawn] comfort from the strong support they received from the Police Association\\". Police Association secretary Paul Mullett would later step down after being charged with perjury and attempting to pervert the course of justice following an unrelated OPI investigation.
