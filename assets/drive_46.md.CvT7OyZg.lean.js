It is one of the first feature films produced in the post-Taliban Afghanistan. In this family, Zolykha is the youngest girl. She is vivacious and curious, and exhibits special psychic powers of extrasensory perception of past events and people whose ghosts haunt their home. Amena and Zalmai are her older siblings, who, in their efforts to decipher the meaning of past tragedies and tribulations (both natural and man-made), convince themselves that a positive future is feasible. However, the eldest daughter of the family questions her destiny, as she had been promised in youth to a man who has since become a cruel and vicious militant. Her father realizes the injustice awaiting his daughter and then protests and fights for his daughter's honour. However, events take a tragic turn. This forces the siblings to flee the countryside to the city with the help of a Taliban convert, who against his strict orders, decides to help them. Production The film, one of the first major Afghani features post 2001, was filmed in Afghanistan entirely with an Afghan 'cast and crew'.

Early life and education She was born in 1909 in Smila, Russian Empire, (now Ukraine). Genia Averbuch's family immigrated to Palestine in 1911 when she was two years old and settled in Tel Aviv. Her father, Zeev Averbuch, was the city's first pharmacist, and her mother Zviya was a sculptor. Averbuch grew up and went to school in Tel Aviv, and in 1926, when she was 17, she went to study architecture in the Regia Scuola di Architettura in Rome where other young people from Palestine studied. After two years in Rome, Averbuch continued her studies in Belgium and in 1930 she received a diploma in architecture from the Royal Academy of Arts of Brussels. Career In 1930 at the age of 21, Averbuch returned to Palestine and launched her professional career. She worked for two years in the technical department of the Jewish Agency under the leadership of Richard Kauffmann. After that she opened an independent firm together with architect Shlomo Ginsburg, nicknamed Sha’ag, a graduate of the first class at the Technion and the first architectural faculty in Palestine. Averbuch was married to Sha'ag for a short period during 1933. Tel Aviv was the urban center and heart of the Jewish community in Palestine. The large immigration wave of middle class German Jews in early 1930s led to a building spurt in the city. Together with Sha'ag, Averbuch designed many apartment buildings and urban villas, and she collaborated with Elsa Gidoni Mandelstamm in designing Café Galina for the Levant Fair in 1934. The structure's white geometry and transparency were typical of the International European style. In 1934 Averbuch won a competition for the design of a municipal plaza, Zina Dizengoff Circle, which became the city's central public space and symbol of its modernization. In 1935 Averbuch married Chaim Alperin, the first commander of the Tel Aviv Police and one of the founders of the Israeli Red Cross (Magen David Adom). Their only son Daniel was born in 1936. From 1935 through the end of the 1930s, Averbuch worked with building engineer I. Greynetz, and together they entered several competitions in Tel Aviv. During World War II Averbuch also worked in the Tel Aviv municipal building department. In 1939 Averbuch won a competition for designing Beit ha-Halutzot (Pioneers House) in Jerusalem, together with engineer Zalman Baron. Winning this competition marked the beginning of Averbuch's long-term professional collaboration with women's organizations in Palestine. Between 1939 and 1955, Averbuch designed social institutions for women and children for all the women's organizations in Palestine (except for Hadassah, which did not work with women architects): WIZO, Leni, Moetzet Ha'poalot, the Mizrahi Women's Organization of America and B'nai B'rith Women. Her work includes pioneers' houses (residences for single women) in Jerusalem (1942) and in Netanya (1950), and agricultural youth villages for children and adolescent Holocaust refugees (Kfar Batya, 1945; Hadassim, 1947). During the 1950s Averbuch continued to design apartment buildings in Tel Aviv, particularly in the booming northern section of the city. In the 1960s she designed two synagogues for the religious Zionist movement and was the second woman to design synagogues in Israel: the synagogue at the first yeshiva high school in Israel, \\"Midrashat Noam\\" in Pardes Hannah (1965), and the synagogue at the religious kibbutz Ein HaNatziv (1966). The partnership between Averbuch and Baron lasted through the mid-1970s. In the 1960s a third partner, Chaim Romem, joined the firm. During the period of the British Mandate, Averbuch participated in architecture competitions and won many prizes and citations. She was well known and well respected in the professional community. In the mid-1940s she began serving as a professional judge for design competitions. Many of the residential buildings she designed in Tel Aviv are situated in the White City area designated as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site and have been chosen for preservation by the Tel Aviv municipality. In 2013, in appreciation of Genia Averbuch's contribution to Tel Aviv's urban landscape, the city decided to name a circle for her.

It is owned by Sun Hung Kai Properties. Mikiki is directly connected to The Latitude (), a private housing estate that was also developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties. Mikiki does not have a Chinese name, and its English name is based on the Japanese word for \\"knowledge\\". Mikiki covers an area of 200,000 square feet and has been opened to the general public since July 2011. Its official opening date was on October the 30th of the same year. The mall is managed by Sun Hung Kai Properties and Hong Yip Service Co Ltd.  Basic information  Mikiki covers an area of 200,000 square feet and the total amount spent on constructing and designing the mall was HK$160 million. The exterior design of Mikiki resembles a glass box. There are 98 stores in the mall, with 35 per cent of them being restaurants, 24 per cent of them being clothing retail stores, 15 per cent of them being supermarkets and convenience stores and 12 per cent of them being furniture, CD and electronic stores. The target audience of the shops of the mall tends to be young customers. According to a press release by Sun Hung Kai Properties, Mikiki means \\"knowledge\\" in Japanese.  Mall design  The public sitting area of the mall was originally situated outside the toilet's entrance. This sitting area was later removed. The design of Mikiki resembles other malls built by Sun Hung Kai Properties with its similar dropped ceiling, exterior walls and floor. The mall's interiors are mainly white in colour without decorations. These walls are used for advertising purposes to generate extra revenue. The mall has an ordinary design for its toilet. Earlier on there was a sitting area near the entrance of the toilets, yet they were removed later on. Nowadays, there's a sitting area on the LG floor at the parking lot where stocks are loaded and unloaded, yet its exact location is undisclosed to the general public.

He had his first child while still at college after which he spent several years of struggle to support his family. This period of his life ‘largely informs his writing, and permeates through his first novel’ TAG which was on the 2009 Wales Book of the Year Long List. The book also won the Media Wales Peoples Choice award. May's second novel, Life! Death! Prizes! was published in 2012 and shortlisted for the 2012 Costa Book Awards. The novel is narrated by Billy, a mixed-up teenager, struggling to raise his little brother after the death of their mother. It earned May comparisons to Dave Eggers and J.D. Salinger. In 2014, May published his latest novel, Wake Up Happy Every Day. The Independent on Sunday's review of the book stated: “He riffs entertainingly on failure … Talk of misspent youth, assassins and obstreperous protagonists belies the emotional core which makes May's books moving”. Interviewed by The Independent in 2014, May commented: “This country’s spirit is in places like Bedford, where I grew up, Kettering and Ipswich. The type of men I write about live outside big cities, lack self- confidence and rarely feature in contemporary fiction. Even Nick Hornby's characters are more sorted than mine.\\" In 2016 it was announced that Sandstone Press will publish his fourth novel Stronger Than Skin in spring 2017.

Headquartered in Germany under the name MEVA Schalungs-System GmbH, the MEVA group has 40 subsidiaries, plants and logistics centers on 5 continents.  Business  MEVA designs, constructs, produces and markets frame formwork systems for all types of in-situ concrete applications in the building industry. MEVA’s product portfolio is completed by the company’s service and consulting packages for formwork users.  History  MEVA was founded in 1970 by Gerhard Dingler. The idea of developing a formwork system that would be re- usable led to the company’s foundation and to the first frame-based panelised formwork system with a facing integrated into a metal frame, the so-called formwork panel. The panels are produced in different sizes and can be freely combined, hence the name modular formwork system. In the course of its history, MEVA developed several innovations, part of which have become standard features in the industry. The milestones:About MEVA *1971 – MEVA presents the first modular panelised formwork system. *1977 – MEVA invents the formwork clamp that connects panels tightly and firmly. *1978 – The frame with hollow profiles and grooves is presented. It is lighter than previous frames, supports a higher fresh concrete pressure and is easier to clean as no dirt can enter the closed hollow profiles.MEVA frame profile *1981 – The first crane-independent formwork system for walls and slabs is marketed. *1982 – MEVA’s Mammut wall formwork system is the first heavy-duty system offering a fresh concrete load capacity of 97 kN/m². *1989 – MEVA develops the aluminium wall formwork system. *1992 – The crane-independent MevaDec slab system offers 3 methods for all types of slabs. *2000 – MEVA presents the first all-plastic facing and is the first formwork producer to use this kind of facing in all formwork systems. Contrary to wooden facing, the all-plastic facing lasts as long as the panel frame, can be cleaned with high-pressure cleaners and repaired with identical material on the construction site and delivers a consistently high-quality concrete surface. MEVA’s all-plastic facing alkus alkus product information comes with a 7-year long term warranty that so far has never been claimed.history of alkus - milestones *2012 – MEVA’s automatic climbing system MAC is used on sites in Europe after several years of use in Australia and the Far East.MEVA Automatic Climbing MAC Product and Service Portfolio MEVA offers standard formwork systems for all types of in-situ concrete applications and also designs and produces special formwork and solutions for special requirements such as irregular building geometries or surfaces without joints.

Consequently, an increasing number of elderly go to neighbor cities in Pearl River Delta, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai for retirement. According to a survey conducted by the Hong Kong government's Census and Statistics Department in September 2011, more than 15,000 people from Hong Kong aged over 60 lived in mainland for one to six months in 2011[5].  Guangdong province's unique conditions  * Geographic factor: Guangdong province is relatively closer to Hong Kong than other provinces and thus is more convenient for the elderly to travel. * Economic factor: The living cost (food, housing, etc.) of Guangdong is lower than Hong Kong. Tse Shun-fa, 75, a Hong Kong pensioner who moved into a care home in Dongguan, describes that he has to spend HK$4,000 per month in Hong Kong while he only has to pay about CNY 4,000 (HK$6,300) for a 25-square- meter retirement room in Dongguan.

Furthermore, according to the reports from Wenweipo's journalists [10], numerous aged people living in Guangzhou were interviewed and they expressed their hope for Hong Kong government to remain and continue the arrangement and let more aged people enjoy the welfare in their later life. Those aged people think that the cost of living is relatively low in Guangdong compared with Hong Kong (although the cost of living in mainland is still increasing).

During the eight-year tenure, he oversaw the publication of many bestsellers: The Master series was the first to introduce authors Milan Kundera, Haruki Murakami, and Italo Calvino to Taiwan. Emotional Intelligence, part of the Next series, reached a record high of 700,000 copies sold, and the Brain Turner series reached six million copies sold. The company's Red Novels and Blue Novels series also included best sellers. In 1989, Rex advocated for and organized the first Taiwan Pavilion exhibit and delegation for the Frankfurt Book Fair. In 1996, as the organizer of the 1996 Taipei International Book Fair (TIBE), he increased the exhibition's scale from the previous year, and established the foundation for future development. Also in 1989, he founded the Sunday Comics. Using the pen name of Ma-Li as the comic playwright, he collaborated with comic artist Chen Uen for the comic, Abi Sword. In 2008, he started publishing the serial novel Abi Sword prelude on his personal website. In addition, during his tenure at China Times Publishing Company, Rex introduced many Japanese comic titles, which included the Complete Manga Works of Tezuka Osamu. How left China Times Publishing Company in 1996 and founded Locus Publishing Company while also taking on the position of President and Editor- in-Chief at The Commercial Press (Taiwan), Ltd. Publications by Locus Publishing Company included Le Scaphandre et le Papillion and Tuesdays With Morrie, which sold 200,000 and 60,000 copies respectively. Starting in 2000, Locus published picture books, A Garden In My Heart, Sound of Colors, and The Moments by illustrator writer Jimmy Liao. Later in 2001, Rex founded the website “Net and Books”. On December 8, 2003, Rex wrote and published an open letter on China Times addressed to Taiwan's publishing industry and the Government Information Office to raise awareness of the importance of Taipei International Book Exhibition. The next year, Taipei Book Fair Foundation (TBFF) was founded and he was appointed the President of the foundation. Rex organized the TIBE from 2005 to 2007. In 2009, Rex was appointed as a National Policy Advisor to the President of Republic of China, Taiwan. After four years of advising on art, cultural, and social issues, he resigned in 2013. ChineseCUBES In 2010, Rex designed a new digital and tactile Chinese language learning system called ChineseCUBES, and founded the company ChineseCUBES. The system uses augmented reality and physical cubes, combined with a holistic approach to learning Chinese.\\"ChineseCubes Are Cubes That Teach You Chinese\\". TechCrunch, Apr 21, 2014 The learning system has won awards in design, education, and technology. New York Chinese Character Festival October 2013 Rex founded and co-organized the first Chinese Character Festival in New York with New York University Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. The festival consisted of a month- long of cultural activities, performances, and online contests to give people the opportunity to explore Chinese Characters and Culture. Awards and honors In 1996, Rex was named Publisher of the Year 1996 by Kingstone Bookstore. In 2004, China Book Business Report named him among the Most Important Chinese Publishers for the Past Decade (1994–2004). In 2006, he was named Man of the Year by the Book Reviews of China Times Daily, and once again Publisher of the Year by the Kingstone Bookstore.

The Marines of the Imperial Guard (French: marins de la Garde Imperiale) formed a naval unit within the Imperial Guard of Napoleon I. The men of the unit not only operated as naval infantrymen but as gunners (after the training they had received in naval gunnery), sailors and engineers. Napoleon himself stated \\"They were good sailors, then they were the best soldiers. And they did everything - they were soldiers, gunners, sappers, everything!\\"Philip Haythornthwaite, The Imperial Guard, Osprey Publishing, 2004 (), page 7  History  When Napoleon was crowned emperor on 2 December 1804, the Marin battalion of the Consular Guard consisted of 820 officers, non-commissioned officers and ratings. Napoleon integrated that battalion into the Imperial Guard in 5 crews totaling 818 officers and men. Its ranks were those of the navy not the army and each crew was commanded by a 'capitaine de frégate' or 'capitaine de vaisseau' and four other officers, with 15 non-commissioned officers and 125 ratings. Drummer of the Marins of the Consular Guard (by Maurice Orange). The new unit's first task to form part of the force at Boulogne for the Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom. They not only built boats for the force, but also served in their primary role as an elite unit to bolster naval crews, which often had little training or experience. When the invasion was called off, part of the unit fought in the 1805 Austrian campaign, fighting at Ulm and Austerlitz. In 1806, 102 men from the unit took part in the Prussian campaign, fighting at Jena and especially in the siege of Danzig, where they formed part of Chasseloup-Laubat's force of engineers. They followed the Grande Armée into Poland, where they were rejoined by the crews who had remained in France. Together they then fought at Eylau and Friedland. After the peace of Tilsit, the unit was sent back to France, but left for the Peninsular War soon afterwards. Under the orders of general Dupont, they took an active part in the battle of Bailen, where they suffered heavy losses. The survivors were taken prisoner and sent to Cadiz on barges, where some of them remained until 1814. The unit had to be re-formed from scratch in March 1809, but was now only a single crew of 150 officers and men, which fought at Wagram under the command of capitaine de vaisseau Baste, mainly as gunners. In September 1810 8 more crews were added, raising the unit's strength to 1,136 officers, NCOs and ratings. It suffered badly in the Invasion of Russia, fighting in several battles and decimated by cold, hunger and disease - only 85 of its officers and men were still alive when the army crossed back into Germany. Reorganised and brought up to strength with new recruits, the unit fought at Leipzig as part of the infantry component of the Young Guard. In 1814 the unit took part in the French campaign, notably the defence of Paris. A small detachment of 21 marines from the unit accompanied Napoleon into exile on Elba.Henry Houssaye, 1815, Paris, Perrin et cie, 1921, p.148 During the Hundred Days one crew of 150 was re- formed,http://www.histoiredumonde.net/Marins-de-la-Garde.html which fought at Ligny and Waterloo - at the latter they covered the retreat of the 1st Grenadier Regiment and 1st Foot Chasseurs of the Old Guard.

The tunic had red cuffs, decorations in the dolman style and scale epaulettes.

Oxyselenides can form a wide range of structures in compounds containing various transition metals, and thus can exhibit a wide range of properties. Most importantly, oxyselenides have a wide range of thermal conductivity, which can be controlled with changes in temperature in order to adjust their thermoelectric performance. Current research on oxyselenides indicates their potential for significant application in electronic materials.  Synthesis  The first oxyselenide to be crystallized was manganese oxyselenide in 1900.Fonzes-Diacon, H. (1990). \\"A synthesized selenide and an oxyselenide of manganese\\". Competes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences 130: 1025: 1025–6. In 1910, oxyselenides containing phosphate were created by treating P2Se5 with metal hydroxides.Ephraim, F., and E. Majler. (1910). \\"Selenophosphates\\". Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft 43: 277–285. Uranium oxyselenide was formed next by treating H2Se with uranium dioxides at 1000 °C.Khodadad, P. (1957) \\"Uranium Oxyselenide. UOSe\\". Compt. Rend. 245: 226: 2286–8. This technique was also utilized in synthesizing oxyselenides of rare-earth elements in the mid-1900s.Guittard, M., Flahaut, J., and Domange, L. \\"The oxyselenide of Yttrium and all the rare earths\\". Acta Crystallographica 21 (5). Synthesis of oxyselenide compounds currently involves treating oxides with aluminum powder and selenium at high temperatures. Figure 2: Some recently discovered oxyselenide structures crystallize in such a way that the metal oxide layers (a) and the metal selenide layers (b) form an alternating pattern (c). Color code: yellow − strontium; pink − cobalt; blue − oxygen; green − selenium; orange − copper Recent discoveries in iron oxyarsenides and their superconductivity have highlighted the importance of mixed anion systems. Mixed copper oxychalcogenides came about when the electronic properties of both chalcogenides and oxides were taken into account. Chemists began pursuing the synthesis of a compound with metallic and charge density wave properties as well as high temperature superconductivity. Upon synthesizing the copper oxyselenide Na1.9Cu2Se2·Cu2O by reacting Na2Se3.6 with Cu2O, they concluded that a new type of oxychalcogenides could be synthesized by reacting metal oxides with polychalcogenide fluxes.  Derivatives  Figure 3: Orthorhombic structure of β-La2O2MnSe2 at low temperatures. New oxyselenides of the formula Sr2AO2M2Se2 (A=Co, Mn; M=Cu, Ag) have been synthesized. They crystallize into structures consisting of alternating perovskite-like (metal oxide) and antifluorite (metal selenide) layers (Figure 2). The optical band gap of each oxyselenide is very narrow, indicating semiconductivity. Another derivative that reveals oxyselenide properties is β-La2O2MSe2 (M= Fe, Mn). This molecule possesses an orthorhombic structure (Figure 3), opening up the possibilities for different packing arrangements of oxyselenides. They are ferromagnetic at low temperatures (~27 K) and show high resistivity at room temperature. The Mn analogue, diluted in NaCl solution, suggests an optical band gap of 1.6 eV at room temperature, making it an insulator. Meanwhile, the band gap for the Fe analogue is approximately 0.7 eV between 150 K and 300 K, making it a semiconductor. In contrast, cobalt oxyselenide La2Co2O3Se2 is antiferromagnetically ordered, suggesting that although the different transition metals are responsible for the changes in an oxyselenide's magnetic property, the molecule's overall lattice structure may also influence its conductivity. Figure 4: Comparison of figure-of-merit ZT compounds Bi1-xMxCuSeO. Higher ZTs indicate more efficient energy conversions. The magnetic and conducting properties of different metal compounds coordinated with oxyselenide are not only affected by the transition metal used, but also by the synthesis conditions. For example, the percentage of aluminium used during the synthesis of Ce2O2ZnSe2 as an oxygen retriever affected the band gaps, indicated by the varying product colours. Various structures allow for many potential configurations. For example, as observed before in La2Co2O3Se2, Sr2F2Mn2Se2O exhibits a frustrated magnetic correlation in the structure resulting in an antiferromagnetic lattice. In 2010, p-type polycrystalline BiCuSeO oxyselenides were reported as possible thermoelectric materials. The weak bonds between the [Cu2Se2]−2 conducting and [Bi2O2]+2 insulating layer, as well as the anharmonic crystal lattice structure, may account for the substance's low thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric performance. Recently, BiCuSeO's ZT value, a dimensionless figure-of-merit indicating thermoelectric performance, has been increased from 0.5 to 1.4. Experiment has shown that Ca doping can improve electrical conductivity, thereby increasing the ZT value. Additionally, replacing 15% of the Bi3+ ions with group 2 metal ions, Ca2+, Sr2+, or Ba2+ (Figure 4), also optimizes the charge carrier concentration.

In 1959 however the Chinese authorities required the British to vacate their location as they wanted to redevelop the land for use as the Supreme People's Court. In January 1959 the British were informed that \\"the centre of Peking was scheduled for reconstruction and that the area occupied by the British Legation was required for the site of a large new building for the Judicial Executive. The staff of the Legation was therefore requested to move out of their quarters by May 31st 1959”. In exchange for vacating their old premises in 1959, the Chinese authorities built and offered the British their current embassy and residence in the diplomatic district. The embassy consists of two two-storey houses set in walled gardens. The consular section is now too large to be accommodated in the embassy building (referred to locally as the 'main building'). It is now housed at the Kerry Centre, 1 kilometer away. Visa applications are handled at a centre shared with the Republic of Ireland at Chaoyangmen.

In 1987, he briefly played for Bærum SK, and in 1989 he was on the roster of sixth-tier club Lommedalens IL. After his active career he pursued a career as a sports administrator, among others managing different golf clubs in the district. He was also a liaison for AC Milan, bringing their AC Milan Junior Camp to Norway. In January 2013 he started to volunteer as managing director of Stabæk Fotball, being formally hired in October the same year. He is married to an Italian woman, has a son and a daughter and settled in Lommedalen. In his younger days, Hjorth was also a national youth player in bandy.

Life Herwig Kipping was born in Meyhen, a hamlet of fewer than 200 people located between Weimar and Leipzig, and some 9 km (4 miles) to the south of Naumburg. His father was a farmer and (since the area was by now part of the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany) became the president of the local Agricultural Production Cooperative shortly after the boy was born. By the time he attended school the Soviet occupation zone had become the German Democratic Republic, a one-party state sponsored by, and in key respects politically modeled on the Soviet Union. Kipping left school in 1964 and started an apprenticeship as a fitter at the vast VEB \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" Leuna chemical plant on the south side of Halle. Unusually, however, before completing his apprenticeship at Leuna he returned to school in order to work for and pass his school final exams In 1967 he moved on to the Humboldt University of Berlin where he started a five-year degree course in Mathematics. However, as he explained in an interview more than twenty years later, university life expanded his intellectual horizons: he became persuaded that he was better suited for Philosophy than Mathematics, and that the mathematics he was being taught was uninspiring and mechanistic. According to another more succinct source, he discovered that he was being prepared for a career in the Central Statistical Office. In any event, after progressing through slightly more than three years of the five year degree course he dropped out of the university. During his time at the Humboldt Kipping developed an intense love for the works of philosopher-poets such as Georg Heym, Trakl, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Baudelaire, Dostoyevsky and, most particularly, Nietzsche. He also wrote his own poetry (which remained unpublished). Having left university at short notice, he now obtained work with the postal service in order to support himself, while still nurturing an ambition to become a philosopher-poet himself. Between 1972 and 1975 he performed his military service, serving in the People's Army as a radio operator stationed at Fünfeichen (Neubrandenburg) in the north-east of the country. On completing his military service, in 1977 he volunteered for an internship with Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF), the national television service. During his internship period he worked as a production assistant for . The next year, by now aged 30, he applied successfully for a study place at the Film and Television Academy in Potsdam-Babelsberg. This time he completed the five year degree course, receiving his degree in 1982. His graduation film, \\"Hommage a Hölderlin\\" (1983) was well received, although an earlier film he had put together during his second year about the postal service, and entitled \\"Bahnpostfahrer\\" (1979), caused a senstation at an intiial screening in Leipzig, but was then suppressed for nine months, earning him a reputation with the authorities as a trouble maker at a time when the rise of the \\"Solidarity\\" movement in neighbouring Poland was making the East German authorities nervous about any hint of sub-optimal worker contentment at home. Later he told an interviewer that the university had wanted to \\"get rid of\\" him following the adverse reaction of the ruling SED (party) to \\"Bahnpostfahrer\\" He remained at the university, but it was now that he also took the precaution of joining the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands), still a believer in the party's stated ideals, while painfully aware of the restrictions imposed on personal freedom by the practical realities of the one-party dictatorship. Following graduation he returned to work with Deutscher Fernsehfunk, initially with a journalistic brief. He provided the reportage for a television programme on Karl Stülpner. The next year he produced a short documentary film with the title \\"Sechs auf dem Dach\\" (1984) about a team of roofers. However, this was modified before release, and Kipping became involved in a furious dispute about the changes made to it. The disagreement escalated, as Kipping launched a general criticism of the broadcaster's \\"information policy\\". He was given a demotion on account of his \\"antisocial activities on a platform of opposition\\"\\"antisozialistischer Tätigkeit auf einer oppositionellen Plattform\\" and responded by resigning from the Deutscher Fernsehfunk. In the end he was also thrown out of the country's ruling SED (party). Between 1984 and 1989 Kipping worked as a free-lance script-writer. He regularly submitted scripts to DEFA, the state-owned film company, but none of his scripts was accepted. It was also during this period, in 1986, that he studied with Heiner Carow at the National Arts Academy. Everything changed in November 1989 when the Berlin Wall was breached by protestors and it became apparent that the fraternal Soviet forces had received no orders to suppress protest, nor to restrain people crossing the hitherto lethal border dividing Berlin. This opened the way to an end for one party dictatorship and indeed, within a year, German reunification. A few years later Kipping would describe himself as a child of \\"Die Wende\\" (the changes triggered in November 1989), while insisting that the many people who encountered the \\"experience of no longer being needed\\" when the German Democratic Republic collapsed also deserved sympathy. It was something he himself knew, in a different context, from the years when his film scripts were routinely rejected by the only film company in town. After 1989 Kipping experienced the freedoms and the disappointments of a career in the newly reunified Germany. DEFA now accepted his film scripts, the first of which, \\"Das Land hinter dem Regenbogen\\", was screened in 1991. He had been working on it since 1986 and the film was well received. Set in a fictional East German town called \\"Stalina\\" in the critical year 1953, the allegorical film deals with a girl called Marie who dreams of another world, beyond the rainbow. Her grandfather at this time speaks to his iconic bust of Stalin and confidently expects the creation of paradise in their hometown. Dreams turn sour and the arrival of Soviet soldiers triggers a cruel dénoument. His next film, ', appeared in 1993. However, in 1992 the old DEFA studios were sold, and an inability to attract further funding proved as effective a block on Kipping's film directing career as the bureaucratic obstruction he had faced in the 1980s.

It was aired by Globo TV from April 5, 1997 to July 28, 2002. Aimed at the family and teenagers, it was initially broadcasting on Saturday afternoons. As of 19 April 1998, the TV show was aired on Sundays due to the transmissions of the 1998 World Cup, remaining on Sundays until its 2002. It was the first Sunday evening program of auditorium hosted by a woman on Brazilian television, because before Xuxa, the dispute was only between men, like Silvio Santos, Faustão and Gugu Liberato. Presenters Márcia Goldschmidt and Eliana followed the footsteps of Xuxa and also appeared on Sunday afternoons on Brazilian TV. The program was an audience success with averages always above 21 points, often surpassing Domingão do Faustão. Planeta Xuxa was being fully re-released by Canal Viva, on Sundays at 7:00 p.m., and its re-run on Mondays at 9:00 p.m. The program was re-released on September 7, 2014, leaving the channel among the 10 most watched on time, recording one of the best pay-TV audiences. After Xuxa signs a contract with Rede Record, Canal Viva ceased to show the program. Concept Planeta Xuxa was focused on the musical performances from contemporary artists and bands. The program had the format of a discotech, had the participation of the public and welcomed famous guests. To animate the auditorium and keep the party mood in the studios, Xuxa counted on Paquitas New Generation, with the group of dancers You Can Dance, with the twins Mariana and Roberta Richard and with the dancer Adriana Bombom. One of the most prominent paintings was Intimidade, in which Xuxa interviewed guests by asking intimate questions. In the premiere program, the interviewee was the actor Marcello Antony. Personalities such as actresses Letícia Sabatella and Arlete Salles, soccer players Ronaldo and Renato Gaúcho, singer Mark Knopfler, British band Dire Straits, Judge Siro Darlan, and others. Madonna is also on the list of celebrities who spoke to the show in an interview in 1998. When it was a year in the air, in April 1998, the Planeta Xuxa won a beauty salon, where the Transformação was happening, a great success. Xuxa selected people from the audience willing to give a reinvigorated look, from haircut to clothes. Weekly, when the time of attraction came, the participants would raise their hands, euphoric, and wave to the hostess, asking them to be the chosen ones. In June of the same year, another picture was implanted in the program: Viagem Surpresa do Planeta, in which the camera focused some participant in the audience that gained a trip of a week for some Brazilian tourist spot. The lucky guy should have immediate availability to board. History On April 19, 1998, the program changed day and time, and it will be shown on Sundays at noon. Still with the general direction of Marlene Mattos, was subordinated to the general direction of creation of Carlos Manga. In July 1998, when the presentress entered maternity leave, several famous singers took turns in the command of the program: Ivete Sangalo; Alexandre Pires; Gabriel, o Pensador; Daniel; Zezé di Camargo & Luciano among others. In August 1999, the Paquitas of the Generation 2000 also happened to be part of the attraction. The team was formed by Monique Alfradique, Daiane Amendola, Lana Rodes, Thalita Ribeiro, Gabriella Ferreira, Leticia Barros, Joana Mineiro and Stephanie Gulin. In April of the year 2000, the Planet Xuxa underwent new modifications. The Paquitas went to Xuxa Park (1994), infantile also presented by Xuxa. The presenter started to count on 15 new helpers, called Garotas do Zodiaco. The group consisted of Marcella Siede (Aries), Fabiana Telles (Aries), Marina Azze (Taurus), Daniele Nabor (Gemini), Ana Cecília Calderon (Gemini), Sabrina Miragaia (Cancer), Bianca Barbosa ), Danah (Virgo), Gisella Prattes (Libra), Fernanda Fontoura (Scorpio), Francine Melo (Sagittarius), Nadja Haddad (Capricorn), Patrícia Marques (Capricorn), Lívia Pais (Aquarius), Fernanda Freitas (Aquarius). Planeta Xuxa also had one more member on his team: journalist Alex Lerner, who had been doing interviews with international music stars. The program also featured new cadres this year, such as Running Behind Damage, which sought to secure extra cash for people with financial difficulties through tasks set by the program. Also in April 2000, Marlene Mattos assumed the direction of a Nucleus of Production, and happened to command entirely Planet Xuxa. At that time, the program had general direction of Marlene Mattos, writing of Vivian Perl, direction of production of Aluizio Augusto and management of production of Jayme Square. In 2001, Xuxa won other stage assistants: the \\"Mano\\" and the \\"Mina\\", a group of four boys and three girls with the task of further animating the audience. In that year, new paintings were inaugurated. In Giro do Planeta, Dudu Miranda, Alex Lerner and Andréa Veiga carried out national and international reports on various subjects; The Redaction of the Planeta was directed by the promoters David Brazil and Amin Khader, and talked about the world of celebrities; in Address of the Heart, the presenter visited the house of famous friends - in the first edition, Xuxa went to Goiás to visit the sertanejo singer Leonardo; and in A Man on the Wheel, a guest answered three types of questions - professional, intimate and indiscreet - by the actresses Mônica Carvalho, Paula Burlamaqui and Juliana Paes. At the beginning of 2002, Planeta Xuxa presented Jogos de Verão, a series of competitions that counted on the participation of special guests. The tests, which included running, climbing, jumping and crawling, among other modalities, were recorded at Marechal Hermes, Campo dos Afonsos, in the western area of Rio de Janeiro. New frames have also been created. Next to the old and successful Intimacy, which received the actress Solange Couto in her re-screening in the new phase, were Entre Amigos and Espertos do Planeta. Planeta Xuxa also hosted two new members, the Scorpio (Rafael) and Ariano (Marcelo). In June 2002, the partnership between Xuxa and Marlene Mattos, her manager and director, ended. While the presenter wanted to work with children, the director preferred the adolescent audience. The two have worked together for 18 years, since Xuxa's debut on the now-defunct TV Manchete in 1984. Marlene is the godmother of Sasha, the hostess's daughter. On July 28, 2002, the last Planeta Xuxa was shown. The presenter started to dedicate herself to the children's project in the Xuxa no Mundo da Imaginação, which debuted on TV Globo in October 2002.

Nepalensis in some sources. It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Tibet and China, with violet or blue-purple flowers. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It has short, rhizomes, that have the tan or brown, fibrous remains of past years leaves.British Iris Society (1997) Below the rhizome are pale brown, thick, fleshy-like roots. It has narrow, linear, grey-green or pale green leaves, that grow up to long and 2–3 mm wide. The leaves taper to a point. The leaves have 2–3 longitudinal veins. It has simple flowering stem, that grow up to long and 2 mm wide. The stems can have 1 branch. The stems have 3 spathes (leaves of the flower bud), that are green, narrow, lanceolate, they end in a point (acuminate) and long and 6–8 mm wide. The stem (and branch) hold between 1 and 2 flowers, which bloom between May to June. The flowers are in diameter, and come in shades of violet, or blue purple. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'.} The falls are obovate, and are long and 1.5 cm wide. In the middle of the falls, is a serrated, crest surrounded by blue and white stripes or blotches. The petals are curved toward centre of flower. The claw (part of the petal closest to the stem) is similar to a gutter. The standards are narrowly, ovate or broadly lanceolate, and are long and 1.5 cm wide. It has broad or flat and wide, style branches, which are long and 1.5 cm wide. It has wide lobes on the end and have toothed edges. They arch up towards the centre of the flower. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, between July to September. The seeds have not been described.  Taxonomy It has the common name of wide- style iris, or wide coloumn iris. It is written as 宽柱鸢尾 in Chinese script and known as kuan zhu yuan wei in Pidgin Chinese. The Latin specific epithet latistyla refers to a combination of 2 words, lati from 'latus' meaning broad and wide and style. It was first published and described by Yu Tang Zhao in 'Acta Phytotaxonomica Sinica' (Acta Phytotax. Sin. in Beijing) Vol.18 Issue1 page61 in 1980. In 1980, Zhao originally placed this species among the crested irises in the Lophiris section, but Brian Mathew and Henry J. Noltie included it with Iris subg. Nepalensis, as it is very similar to Iris decora. Due to the iris being found in China, it is more likely to be a Lophiris crested iris, but a molecular study has supported a position within Iris subg. Nepalensis.Jinyan Guo and Carol A. Wilson.

Life Ancien Régime Daugier began his military career by joining the Gardes de la Marine in October 1782, serving on the corvette Flèche then on the Précieuse the following year. On board the Superbe he took part in several missions to the Indian Ocean before returning to France on board the Brillant in May 1786. In 1787 he joined one of the packet boats intended to ease traffic between France and the Caribbean.Étienne Taillemite, Dictionnaire des marins français, Paris, Tallandier, 2002 (), page 126 On his return in 1789, having risen to lieutenant de vaisseau, he perfected his training in naval tactics. He rejoined the Flèche before switching to the Tourville in the Bay of Biscay on the orders of Morard de Galles. First Republic After several years at sea without a break, his health was badly affected and he had to return to his family to rest. He was elected procurator of Courthezon before being recalled to the navy on the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition. On 5 January 1793 he was made a major général in the squadron defending Belle-Île-en-Mer and Groix from attack by Howe's fleet. Heavily depleted, his crews mutinied under the pretext of sailing to Brest to save the port from the same royalist influence as had allowed the British to take Toulon. This was especially dangerous since his squadron was facing the enemy and so Daugier and his admiral met on one of the mutineers' ships, haranguing the crews and bringing order. The Committee of Public Safety believed Daugier had to be demoted for encouraging popular fanaticism, but he was not out of work long. In March 1795 he was made capitaine de vaisseau and put in command of the frigate Prosperpine, in which he fought the British off the Brittany coast under Villaret de Joyeuse. He took part in the battles of 29 prairial and 5 messidor with this ship before being ordered to Paris to report to the government. Some time later he was put in command of the Nantes and Rochefort convoys, totaling 64 ships. During that command he used his force of four frigates to attack a British force of three frigates and one ship of the line entering the Audierne Bay to give the convoy time to flee into the bay. He then commanded the Fougeux then the Cocarde nationale in the expédition d'Irlande in 1796. In 1797 he took command of the Jupiter and took part in the Bruix' expedition of 1799. Napoleonic Wars In 1800 he was put in command of Rochefort, then of Lorient in 1801 after being made a member of the Tribunat. He supervised the training of the invasion fleet at Boulogne, before taking part in several battles against the British at Le Havre in June 1804. In reward for his services, Napoleon made him a member of the Legion d'Honneur on 1st frimaire year XII, a commander 2nd class on the following 2nd prairial, elector for the Vaucluse department, the first commander of the Sailors of the Imperial Guard and commander of the four main corps of the invasion flotilla at Boulogne. In June 1806 he set off to reconnoitre the Adriatic coast.Étienne Taillemite, Dictionnaire des marins français, Paris, Tallandier, 2002 (), page 127 He also took part in the Prussian and Polish campaigns and commanded 106 men from the Sailors of the Imperial Guard at the battle of Jena. On returning to Paris, he learned that the Sailors posted to the invasion flotilla had been transferred to the Siege of Danzig. He joined them there and after also assisting at the siege of Stralsund and the attack on the island of Rügen Daugier was summoned to Spain to join the force intended for the invasion of Spain. When the popular revolt broke out in Madrid on 2 May 1808, Daugier and the Sailors received ordered to join Dupont's corps in Andalucía. Daugier had his horse killed under him at Baylen the following 19 July. Describing Baylen, general Foy stated that Daugier and his force of Sailors \\"were only 300 men, but 300 men whom fear could not make flinch\\". After the 1809 convention of Andujar, Daugier returned to France to request retirement but could only get temporary leave from Napoleon. He was then made naval prefect of Lorient and was publicly told by Napoleon in the salle des maréchaux \\"I know how enemy generals praise you and the men of iron you command. This praise from an enemy is as good as another, monsieur Daugier.\\" Bourbon Restoration On Napoleon's fall in 1814, Louis XVIII made Daugier a contre-amiral, a count and a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. After the Hundred Days, Daugier was made naval prefect of Lorient in 1814, of Rochefort in 1817 and finally of Toulon. He was also made a commander of the order of Saint Louis on 21 October 1818, then a grand officer of the Légion d'honneur on 28 April 1821. He was elected deputy for Morbihan department in 1815 and defended naval interests in that role as well as gaining preferment for those whose careers had declined in the final years of the First Empire. In 1817 Daugier was elected deputy for Finistère, where he had been president of the electoral college. In the 1817-1818 session he voted with the minority but was still recognized by the ministry as candidate for Vaucluse, which he represented from 1819 to 1827. From the 1819 election onwards he supported the ministry. When Camille Jordan presented an important amendment on 29 June 1820 during the discussion on the electoral law, Daugier and five or six of his colleagues defected, meaning the amendment was rejected.

Life Nosov was born on March 26, 1923, in the town of Sengiley in Ulyanovsk Province (then named Simbirsk Province), into a family of Russian ethnicity. Victor Nosov's father, Peter Ivanovich, worked as a prosecutor. Peter Nosov had started as a court courier at age 14, being appointed secretary of the Simbirsk district court in 1914. In 1918 Peter Nosov married Taisii Vasil, after which he was graduated from college and served as a judge and prosecutor. Since prosecutors were then not allowed to work in one place for more than five years, the family lived in Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk), Ardatov, Novodevichy, and Stavropol-on-Volga (now Tolyatti). Victor had an older sister (Zinaida Petrovna) and a younger brother. In 1939 his family moved to Stavropol-on-Volga where he attended Secondary School #1 and become interested in radio engineering. After being graduated from 8th grade he entered a factory school and worked as a fitter at the radio station. The German invasion of the Soviet Union occurred on June 22, 1941, when Nostov had just turned 18. He was first sent to infantry training, but soon transferred to the aviation school in Stalinabad, and in 1943 was enrolled in the Levanevsky Naval Aviation School, where he earned his pilot's certification. In October 1944 Second Lieutenant Nosov reported to Mine-Torpedo Regiment 51 of the Baltic Fleet air force, equipped with American-made A-20 Boston twin-engined light bombers. He flew his first mission on October 18. From December 1944 he flew anti-shipping missions against German transports in the Baltic Sea and the port of Libau. He and his crew flew six sorties, their role being to fly in advance of the torpedo bombers and lay down suppressive fire on the enemy's anti-aircraft weapons, a dangerous task. Nosov and his crew participated in these sinkings: *December 12, 1944 – in a group of aircraft which attacked Libau and sank a 6,000 ton transport (not fully confirmed) *December 14, 1944 – in a group of aircraft which attacked Libau and sank a patrol boat (reliably confirmed) *December 22, 1944 – near Libau, bombed and sank an enemy patrol boat (not fully confirmed) *February 5, 1944 – Near Danzig Bay, in a group of aircraft which sank a 7,000 ton transport (not fully confirmed) On February 10, 1945, Nosov was made a full lieutenant. Death Nosov memorial in Tolyatti On Nosov's sixth combat mission, on February 13, 1945, his A-20 was in the southern part of the Baltic Sea (at about ) attacking a 6,000 ton transport when it was hit by anti-aircraft fire and burst into flames. Nosov flew his burning plane directly into the transport, which blew up and sank. Besides Nosov, his navigator (Second Lieutenant Alexander Igoshin) and gunner (Sergeant Fedor Dorofeev) perished. This was the war's first deliberate ramming of an enemy ship in the Baltic Sea. Awards *Hero of the Russian Federation *Order of the Red Banner While still alive, Nosov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on January 20, 1945 by order of the commander of the Baltic Fleet \\"For the outstanding performance of combat missions during the Great Patriotic War, and for bravery and heroism\\". In April 1945, December 1947, and June 1953, he was nominated for posthumous award of Hero of the Soviet Union; these petitions were not successful, but he was awarded the post-Soviet equivalent, Hero of the Russian Federation, by Presidential Decree #187 of February 23, 1998. Memorialization Nosov's house in Tolyatti has been preserved Tolyatti has memorialized Nosov in several ways. There is a memorial with a bust of Nosov (by A. I Frolov) in front of Secondary School #4 on Gorky street in the Central District. His image is one of the four bas- reliefs on the Obelisk of Glory in Liberty Square. River Street in the Komsomol District of Tolyatti was renamed to Victor Nosov Street. In front of Secondary School #1 is a stele with the names of alumni who died during the Great Patriotic War (including Nosov) on the front. Nosov's house in Stavropol was preserved when the city was moved prior to the creation of the Kuybyshev Reservoir (which submerged the old city). It is now located at 7 Pioneer Street and bears a memorial plaque. A memorial in his birthplace of Sengiley was dedicated in 1965 and street there is named after him, a street in Kaliningrad is named Victor Nosov Street, and there is a monument to Nosov and his crew on Cape Rozewie in Puck, Poland, north of Gdańsk (the former Danzig). The inscription on the plaque there reads \\"On February 13, 1945, the Soviet airmen Victor Nosov, Alexander Igoshin, and Fedor Dorofeev died for our freedom and yours...\\" (the phrase \\"For our freedom and yours\\" has long been associated with Poland).

Notable are also Serbian families that gained nobility in Russian Empire. With the independence of Serbia in the 19th century, a new aristocracy arose. Middle Ages In the medieval Serbian states, the privileged class consisted of nobility and clergy, distinguished from commoners, part of the feudal society. The nobility () were roughly grouped into magnates (velikaši or velmože) and the lesser nobility (vlasteličići). Serbia followed the Byzantine model. Early Modern period After the Ottoman conquest in the 15th and 16th centuries, large migrations of Serbs followed into the Pannonian Plain. The community in the Kingdom of Hungary, and subsequently Habsburg Monarchy, were known as \\"Rascians\\". Serbs distinguished themselves as warriors and diplomats, and enrolled in Austrian, Transylvanian or Wallachian services.

The initiative takes to form in an annual event on Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israel's Independence Day) in which Christians worldwide are called on and invited by Rabbi Riskin to recite Hallel (Psalms 113–118) with the Jewish People in a celebration to praise God for the State of Israel. Background Hallel consists of six Psalms (113–118), which are recited as a unit, on joyous occasions.Hallel – \\"Praise of G-d\\" – OU.ORG These occasions include the following: The three pilgrim festivals Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot (the \\"bigger\\" Jewish holy days, mentioned in the Torah) and Hanukkah and Rosh Chodesh (beginnings of the new month). Two years after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the Chief Rabbinate in Israel decided that Yom Ha'atzmaut should be given the status of a minor Jewish holiday on which Hallel (Psalms 113–118) be recited. The recitation of the blessing over Hallel was introduced in 1973 by Israeli Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren.  History   Conception  In October 2014, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the Chancellor & Founder of the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC), became the first Orthodox rabbi to invite Christian visitors to Israel to participate in a \\"praise rally\\" with Jewish interfaith leaders at the Center's headquarters during the holiday of Sukkot during which Hallel was recited. This celebratory event would serve as the basis for the eventual conception of the global Day to Praise initiative.  In 2015  The central Day to Praise event at HaZvi Israel Synagogue in Jerusalem, 23 April 2015 The Day to Praise Global initiative was launched in March 2015. In an email sent out to Israel supporters worldwide Rabbi Riskin wrote: As part of the praise worship celebrations, Day to Praise produced songs, inspired by the Hallel Psalms. A portion of the proceeds from these songs go to supporting Heart to Heart, a virtual blood donation program in Israel. The initiative caused an uproar within the Haredi Jewish circles. In a statement, the once chief Sephardi Rabbi of Israel, and the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, Rabbi Shlomo Amar, expressed his \\"stomach churning\\" in light of the joint Hallel prayer of Jews and Christians in a synagogue in Jerusalem being led by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin. In a rebuttal, Rabbi Riskin defended his actions stating, \\"We are talking about a thanksgiving prayer to G-d that would include Christians who worship His actions towards the Jewish people and the Land of Israel ... What could possibly be more appropriate?\\". Later that year, in September, on the eve of Rosh HaShana (the beginning of the Jewish New Year), Riskin's claim was given further backing by Rabbi Pesach Wolicki. In an article written for The Times of Israel, Wolicki wrote, \\"While discomfort is understandable, we dare not assume that what is uncomfortable and new is therefore forbidden.\\" The first annual Day to Praise took place on 23 April 2015 with the central event taking place at HaZvi Israel Synagogue in Jerusalem. The central Day to Praise event was reportedly joined by tens of thousands of worshipers throughout the world, in their own respective groups. Later that year, in 2015, during the festival of Sukkot, CJCUC, together with its founder, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of Efrat, hosted an interfaith event in Efrat in which 200 Christians and Jews came together to sing the praises of God in unity. Riskin said that the event would help usher in the Messianic Age. In 2016 The second annual Day to Praise took place on 12 May 2016 and the central event was held in Gush Etzion, the scene of many past terror attacks. The event consisted of 120 representatives of the Jewish and Christian faiths. The representatives were groups from Israel, The United States, Germany and Brazil and international interfaith organizations such as \\"Bridges for Peace\\" and \\"Christian Friends of Israel\\". During the event, each of the participants read Psalm 117 in their native language, and then read it together in Hebrew. According to co-founder David Nekrutman, this in-gathering was the fulfilment of the biblical prophecy of Zephaniah: \\"For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the LORD to serve Him with one consent.\\" () File:Bishop Armando Cruzem and congregation - Day to Praise 2016.jpgBishop Armando Cruzem and his congregation at their local Day to Praise event in the Philippines, 12 May 2016 File:Bishop Armando Cruzem and wife Joy - Day to Praise 2016.jpgBishop Armando Cruzem and his wife Joy at their local Day to Praise event in the Philippines, 12 May 2016 File:Bridges for Peace - Day to Praise 2016.jpegThe \\"Bridges for Peace\\" branch in Melbourne, Florida at their local Day to Praise event, 12 May 2016 File:Rabbi Alan Yuter - Day to Praise 2016.jpgRabbi Alan Yuter speaking at the central Day to Praise event, 12 May 2016 File:The Portnoy Brothers - Day to Praise 2016.jpgThe Portnoy Brothers at the central Day to Praise event, 12 May 2016 In 2017 The third annual Day to Praise took place on 2 May 2017 and the central event was held in Jerusalem. As per tradition, the Jewish and Christian attendees celebrated by reciting the Psalms 113–118 reportedly joined by hundreds more from around the world. Event co-founder, David Nekrutman, stated that one of the main themes at this year's event was seeing \\"the importance of looking at one another and walking together\\" within the Psalms themselves. This year's event also marked the golden jubilee of the reunification of Jerusalem. A week before celebrations began, a Day to Praise Hallel service was held in Germany by a group of 125 Christians. It was also reported that a few days later, the synagogue in Youngstown, Ohio invited Christians to join them for a Hallel service. In 2018 Attendees at the 4th annual Day to Praise Israel Independence Day event, 18 April 2018 The fourth annual Day to Praise took place on 19 April 2018. The central event was held on the eve of April 18 and began with a Memorial Day ceremony for Israel's fallen soldiers. Jews and Christians joined together in an event which \\"took them from the depths of sadness over Israel’s losses in wars for survival, to the heights of joy on Israel’s 70th anniversary\\". This year's central event was held at the John Hagee Center for Jewish Heritage at the Netanya Academic College where reportedly around 350 Jews and Christians were in attendance. As with every Day to Praise event, attendees recited the Psalms of Praise. Associate director of CJCUC, Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, stated that Christians praising God and praying for Israel is \\"an essential piece of the prophetic puzzle\\" and that without them the prophecies about Israel's future geula (redemption) would not be complete.

David Lambert Lambert was born in Kirkcaldy and came to Alloa in 1831, after working in the USA. The Lamberts were linked by marriage to the great Clackmannan mill owning families, the Archibalds and Patons (later Thomson-Patons and Forrester- Patons). David Fraser Lambert married Mary Ann Archibald (1808-1876) in 1835. Mary was a daughter of John Archibald (d.1832), a mill owner in nearby Menstrie. Her brothers Andrew, William, Peter and John owned mills in Alva and Keilarsbrae, Alloa. David Lambert’s daughter Graeme Haig Lambert (1836-1905) had married John Thomson Paton of Norwood (1831-1910) in 1863. John Thomson Paton, a wealthy director of Paton’s Mill was the grandson of John Paton (1768-1848) founder of Kilncraigs Mill in Alloa. Paton was a major benefactor to Alloa providing, amongst other buildings, the Swimming Baths and Leisure Centre, (now the Spiers Centre), Town Hall and Library. David Lambert died suddenly aged 51 in 1856 and the Mills ownership later passed to his son James Lambert (1836-1874). James Lambert In 1859 Lambert was fined £59 when the HM Inspector of Factories had found 59 workers working after 6pm in contravention of the Act. Robert Ramage, who worked at Gaberston from 1848 to 1858 was an early foreman and manager, with other foreman including John Forfar, foreman weaver William Thomson, foreman tuner Ebenezer Marshall and foreman powerloom weaver Archibald Robertson. Alexander Nicol appears to have been the Manager from 1858 until 1870 when he moved with foreman weaver William Thomson to Devonmills. At this point Andrew Robb (1825-1900), a foreman since at least 1859, became Manager. Other staff included watchman James Stein. When David Bremner collated his survey of the Industries of Scotland in 1869, it had five sets of carding engines and employed around 300 people.The Industries of Scotland - Their rise, progress and current condition, by David Bremner, 1869 In late 1873 James Lambert passed the mill business to his mother Mary Ann Lambert, due to poor health. Despite a visit to the Levant to recover he died the following year aged only 33. He was a good friend of the Mill Manager Andrew Robb, both having served in the Clackmannan Rifle Volunteers. Labor strike The year 1874 saw a destructive dispute between management and workers, leading to a strike, which caused much hardship. The Glasgow Herald of May 9, 1874 records the following; 'Alloa – The weavers strike. Strike of powerloom and handloom weavers still continues in Gaberston Mills, Alloa but without extraneous aid it cannot much longer as the funds at the disposal of the ‘strikers’ have become exhausted. For a number of weeks the men on strike were in receipt of 10s per week each and the females 10s but this week there was no money forthcoming. The lock out at the Hillfoots still continues and there is no hope of a settlement'. And from 29 May 1874, also reported in the Falkirk Herald; 'Alloa –The weavers strike. Although they have no means of support the Alloa Gaberston Mill hands still remain on strike. In the works situated along the foot of the Ochills the disastrous lock out still continues; master and men being seemingly determined to ‘fight it out to the bitter end’. Meanwhile many of the men are seeking work as labourers and subscription sheets are doing the round of the public works for funds to sustain those on strike’ In August 1876 Gaberston Mill's accountant, David Smith, drowned at Fairlie in a boating accident alongside James Mitchell Robb, Andrew's nephew, a millworker at nearby Keilarsbrae. Both were popular members of the Clackmannan Rifle Volunteers and received a military funeral in the town. Closure The mill closed in November 1877. It was for sale that year when it still had 50 power looms and 30 hand looms. Andrew Robb moved to Peebles to become the manager of Tweedside Mills in Peebles. In 'Alloa sixty years ago',Alloa, sixty years ago by James Archibald (1911) Archibald describes the mill and its fate in more detail. 'In 1827 he (David Lambert) started a woollen mill at Gaberston, known for long years as Gaberston Mill, and was a busy hive of industry for many years. The shawl trade was at this period in great demand, and Mr Lambert, by close attention to business, and studying the design and quality of his manufactures, got into a large trade, giving employment to several hundred workers'. and 'The other factory was Gaberston Mill, then and for long after chiefly engaged in the shawl and tartan cloth trade. It had a long period of great prosperity, employing several hundred workers; but, alas, owing to the inexorable decrees of fashion, the wearing of shawls has almost entirely gone out. The works might have been adapted to the tweed trades, as others have done, but owing to the death of the founder, the late Mr David Lambert, and, while still in the prime of life, by the death of his son, the late Mr James Lambert, which unfortunate event was ultimately followed by the work being closed altogether. After closure it was used for several other uses over the next few decades but was finally demolished. Its site, on Whins Road, is remembered by Lambert Avenue and the still extant mill lade. No images are known to survive of the building.

It is currently owned by Investor AB. The company was founded by Ralph Braun, who had spinal muscular atrophy. Braun designed a wheelchair lift and steering controls, which allowed him to drive a 1970 converted full size Dodge van. He began converting vans to sell to others. As sales grew, Braun was able to acquire Independent Mobility Systems. IMS had previously been the largest manufacturer of wheelchair minivans. Braun also acquired the Viewpoint Mobility line of wheelchair minivans. Company sales have grown to $200 million per year.  History  1963: Braun builds his first three-wheel motorized scooter in his cousin's farm shop. He later named this scooter the \\"Tri-Wheeler\\". 1963: Braun begins selling the Tri-Wheeler to others out of his parent's garage under the name Save-A-Step Manufacturing Company. 1966: Ralph's employer relocates further from his home making it impractical to ride his Tri-Wheeler to work. He equips old Post Office Jeep with a hydraulic tailgate lift and homemade hand controls. 1969: Save-A-Step outgrows the Braun's garage and moves to the John Deere/Singer building in downtown Winamac. 1970: Chrysler introduces the full- sze van. Braun builds the precursor to the Lift-A-Way Wheelchair Lift to fit this revolutionary vehicle. 1972: Save-A-Step Manufacturing Company incorporates as The Braun Corporation with five employees. 1974: Braun expands the main production building and additional buildings are constructed to meet the growing demand of lifts and Tri-Wheelers. 1976: A fiberglass operation is purchased to build Tri-Wheeler covers.

The attack  The al-Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques came under suicide attack during midday prayers. The blasts killed 142 people and wounded more than 351, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Yemen's history.\\"Yemen: over 100 dead in suicide bombings at Houthi mosques in Sana'a\\", by The Guardian One suicide bomber blew up outside the gate of al- Badr mosque when he was caught by militia guards, and the second detonated his device among fleeing people inside the mosque. Another pair of bombers blew up at Al-Hashoosh mosque. The targeted mosques are linked to the Houthis, a group of the Zaidiyyah sect of Shia Islam. The Houthis deposed the Yemeni government earlier in 2015 after they took control of Sana'a the previous year.  Responsibility  The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Yemen branch claimed responsibility for the attack. In a recording released by the group, they stated: \\"IS soldiers will not rest until they stop the Safawi [Iranian] operation in Yemen.” According to Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution, the bombings were more likely carried out by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). AQAP denied this, citing instructions from Ayman al-Zawahiri to not attack mosques or markets. If ISIL was responsible, these would be the first attacks it has carried out in Yemen.  Reactions  The U.S. Department of State called for a stop to any military actions, to be followed by a diplomatic solution. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations Secretary General, demanded that all sides \\"immediately cease all hostile actions and exercise maximum restraint.\\" On 23 March, an Iranian Airbus 310 of Mahan Air loaded with 13-ton package of humanitarian aids as well as aid workers of Iranian Red Crescent landed at Sanaa. On its departure from Yemen, 52 wounded people of the bombings were transferred to Tehran to receive treatment. Iran's deputy ambassador Rasai Ebadi said more aid would come soon.

He was the father of Sir John Gladstone and the grandfather of the British prime minister William Ewart Gladstone.  Early life  Born at the farm of Mid Toftcombs in the parish of Biggar, Lanarkshire, Thomas Gladstones was the fourth son of John Gladstones (c.1696–1757), a miller and farmer at Mid Toftcombs. John Gladstones also served as an elder of Biggar Kirk. Thomas's elder brother, James, was a Church of Scotland minister and rector of Leith Academy. In 1746, when he was aged 14, Thomas's father arranged for him to be apprenticed to Alexander Somerville, a wine merchant in Leith. When Thomas completed his apprenticeship he decided that the corn trade offered better prospects than did wine, and he established himself in Leith as a provision merchant and corn dealer, eventually trading at both wholesale and retail.  Marriage and family  On 21 April 1762, Gladstones married Nelly Neilson (1738–1806), the daughter of Walter Neilson, a merchant from Springfield near Edinburgh. They had sixteen children together: # Margaret Gladstones (1763–1814) m.

John Nimmo  Career  Thomas Gladstones' corn business prospered during the 1760s. His business operated from a shop at the front of his house on Coalhill in Leith. Thomas became the lessee of the Dalry paper mill, where he appointed his brother-in-law, James Murray, as superintendent. He also bought and sold grain from the Baltic ports, was an investor in a Leith whaling syndicate, owned a number of trading ships, and had an interest in the sulfuric acid plants at Barrowmuirhead, near Leith. His provisions business focused on provisioning ships with butter, oranges, wine, vinegar and other goods. Thomas Gladstones was a Whig and an elder in the Church of Scotland.

In notable contrast to other Mughal tombs, which are large monuments of Mughal architecture, including the Taj Mahal, at his own direction Aurangzeb is buried in an unmarked grave at the complex of the dargah or shrine of Sheikh Zainuddin. Background Aurangzeb (1658–1707), who was the sixth Mughal emperor, ruled most of the Indian subcontinent for half a century until he died in 1707. According to his wish, he was buried near the dargah of Sheikh Zainuddin, a sufi who was also his \\"spiritual and religious teacher\\".  Location  The tomb is located in the village of Khuldabad, in the district of Aurangabad, from Aurangabad city. It is located in the south-eastern corner of the complex of the dargah of Sheikh Zainuddin. Aurangzeb's Tomb, with marble jaali (latticed screen) around it.  Description  Aurangzeb died in 1707 at Ahmednagar. His body was then carried to Khuldabad after his son Azam Shah and daughter Zinat-un-Nissa came. There is a platform over the tomb made of red stone, less than three yards in length. There is also a \\"cavity\\" in the middle which measures a \\"few fingers\\". The tomb has been covered with soil on which herbs grow. After his burial, he was given the posthumous title of \\"Khuld-Makan\\" (\\"he whose abode is in eternity\\"). Lord Curzon later covered the site with marble and surrounded it with a \\"pierced marble screen\\". The tomb is roofed by \\"the vault of the sky\\". The gateway and the domed porch were added in 1760. It is said that Aurangzeb paid for his burial place by stitching caps during his last years and that it cost only 14 rupees and 12 annas. The tomb is \\"remarkably simple in keeping with Aurangzeb's own wishes\\". Aurangzeb's full name is written on a marble plate located in one of the corners of the tomb. The dargah also houses the tomb of the first Nizam, Asaf Jah I, his son Nasir Jung, and those of Aurangzeb's son Azam Shah and his wife.  In Literature  In her poem, The Tomb of Aurangzebe, Letitia Elizabeth Landon may have been confused by the illustration she was given, as in it she justifies the construction of mighty tombs!

Abram Regional High School. Completed in 1858, it is the only civic building built during the existence of the municipality, which was established in 1823 and disincorporated in 1945. The church-like building is architecturally notable for its Italianate styling, and for its social history as the site of community social and government activity. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The former Salem town house stands on the north side of Maine State Route 142, roughly midway between Phillips and Kingfield, just west of the Mt. Abram Regional High School complex, in the most densely-built area of the former town of Salem. It is a basically rectangulare wood-frame structure, with a square section projecting at the front that provides the entrance vestibule and a tower. The entry is a single door topped by a shallow hood, with flanking narrow sash windows. The walls on either side of the projecting section have larger sash windows. Above the entry the projecting section has a sash window, with a section of roof skirting separating the next stage of the tower, which is topped by an open belfry and a pyramidal roof. The building is otherwise clad in clapboard siding. The right side of the building has a narrow addition with a shed roof whose line begins just below that of the main roof, and there is a single-story addition to the rear. The interior of the building consists of a large open space, with the addition housing a kitchen and restrooms. The area that is now the former town of Salem was first settled in 1814, and successfully petitioned for separation from neighboring Phillips and Freeman in 1823 as \\"North Salem\\". The town was renamed \\"Salem\\" in 1834. The town's population peaked at 561 in 1840. Civic meetings were held in convenient local buildings, including barns, stores, and a starch factory building, before this town house was built in 1857–58. The building was also used for religious services by a variety of local denominations, a fairly common practice of the period. The tower is probably a later addition, because it more closely resembles typical church construction of the 1890s-1910s. At the 1940 census the town's population had declined to 78, and it relinquished its municipal charter to the state in 1945. The town house and adjacent cemetery were sold for $1 to the non-profit Mount Abran Cemetery Association, which has maintained the building as a community hall since.

Her four novels, published between 1928 and 1939, are Phillida, Two Soldiers and a Lady, Emily, and Ashley Hamel. Early life Hilda Reid was the daughter of Sir Arthur Hay Stewart Reid, a judge in the Indian legal service, whose family had served in India for several generations. Sir Arthur and his father, Henry Stewart Reid of the Bengal Civil Service, were both born in India. Hilda Reid's mother, Agnes Imogen Beadon, was the sixteenth child of Sir Cecil Beadon, who was Lieutenant Governor of Bengal from 1862 to 1866. Hilda Reid was born in Lahore, then in India now in Pakistan. Her early childhood was spent in Lahore; she moved to England at the age of nine, where she was cared for by her mother's sister Irene. Education Hilda Reid took her undergraduate degree at Somerville College Oxford, where she was a member of a close-knit group of friends, several of whom went on to have distinguished literary careers. The group included Winifred Holtby, Margaret Kennedy, Vera Brittain, and Sylvia Thompson. Hilda Reid remained particularly close, personally and professionally, to both Winifred Holtby and Vera Brittain. In her autobiography Testament of Youth Vera Brittain describes how Winifred Holtby introduced her to \\"her friend Hilda Reid, the pale, whimiscal second-year student who has since become, as H.S.Reid, the author of exquisite historical novels, delicately etched with the fine pen of a literary drypoint artist\\".Testament of Youth by Vera Brittain. Published 1933 by Victor Gollancz. Page 494. In her review of Hilda Reid's first novel in Time and Tide, Vera Brittain wrote: \\"To the generation that went down from Oxford just seven years ago, Miss H.S.Reid was known as an ardent and fastidious historical scholar, blissfully indifferent to the anxieties and rivalries of an examination system which offers little scope to an imagination so fine and so constructive.\\" Brittain described Phillida in her review as \\"a rare and lovely book\\".Time and Tide, 1 June 1928. In her review of Emily in The Schoolmistress, Winifred Holtby wrote: \\"Her two earlier books, Phillida and Two Soldiers and a Lady, were subtle and scholarly stories of the period after the Civil Wars. But in Emily she looks at the modern world, which is giving so much trouble to statesmen at Geneva. She looks and she laughs\\".The Schoolmistress, 5 October 1933. An article in Time and Tide, describing leading women writers who had emerged from Oxford after the first world war, described Hilda Reid as a Somervillian who \\"was thought much of as a poet by her college, a gentle, dreamy, delicate creature, with fair fluffy hair that would not keep tidy, and a reputation for brilliant and fastidious scholarship that won prizes but could not win alphas in examinations. She forgot lectures, roamed mildly between the Bodleian and Somerville, scattering books; and went down with a fourth in History. But this year when she published Phillida, an exquisite study of the seventeenth century – gay with polished wit and musical phrases, concrete and authentic and vividly imagined, those few who had read the uncommon promise of her frugal essays said 'I told you so. We knew that Hilda Reid could write'\\".Time and Tide, 28 December 1928. In the summer vacation during the first world war Hilda Reid, like other students, undertook agricultural war work. She picked strawberries which she described as \\"an agony of bending\\" and \\"pulled up flax with your bare hands. The Government did supply strong leather gloves, but they were in ribbons after the first 3 days. The flax was needed for making the fabric required for the cockpits and wings of aircraft\\". Novels * 1928 Phillida (published by Chatto & Windus, London) * 1932 Two Soldiers and a Lady (published by Constable & Co Ltd, London) * 1933 Emily (published by Constable & Co, London) * 1939 Ashley Hamel (published by Constable & Co Ltd, London) Selected reviews Phillida The reviewer in The Guardian wrote \\"Rarely have we been so taken with a story of adventure as we were with this chronicle of Richard Carey's thrilling Odyssey in Africa in the seventeenth century and of his belated love-affair with his Phillida.\\" The Guardian, 15 June 1928. The reviewer of Phillida in The Times wrote: \\"Miss Reid contrives to write as a contemporary of the seventeenth century and of the twentieth century at once, and it is to this perhaps that the reader's pleasure is largely due. She is at home in the seventeenth century, and takes it so much for granted that we are soon persuaded to do the same.\\" The review concludes: \\"If this is, as its publishers tell us, the early work of a young writer, it is remarkable as much for its performance as for its promise\\".The Times, 31 May 1928. The reviewer in Country Life wrote: \\"Though this seems to be Miss Reid's first novel, its strange elements are maturely compounded and her use of the seventeenth century idiom is natural and graceful\\".Country Life, 16 June 1928. The reviewer in the Sunday Times wrote: \\"Phillida is a first novel of exceptional merit, and it should not be missed\\".Sunday Times, 5 August 1928. The reviewer in the New York Herald Tribune wrote: \\"In this story, written in a style whose beauty is a certain crystal clarity and appositeness of phrase, a subtle transparence of word in which the underlying thought continually vitalises the changing external picture, the author has achieved an historical novel of peculiar charm and merit.\\"New York Herald Tribune, 30 September 1928. The reviewer in the Liverpool Post and Mercury referred to Hilda Reid's confidence in the historical accuracy of Phillida: \\"She says she dare offer quite a handsome prize to anyone who can find in Phillida an error in historical fact, so assiduous has she been in her researches at the British Museum\\".Liverpool Post and Mercury, 26 May 1928. Two Soldiers and a Lady The reviewer in the Observer wrote: \\"Scene and costume are subordinated to character, for the interest one feels in Miss Reid's two soldiers and the lady whom they served is due to them individually and not their (Cromwellian) period\\". The review concludes: \\"The closely-knit, delicate texture of Miss Reid's story is as satisfying as her sense of character\\".The Observer, 12 September 1932. The reviewer in Country Life wrote: \\"This is a rare book, rare in the historical knowledge and historical sense that informs it, and rare in the perception the reader gains from it.\\"Country Life, 2 April 1932. The reviewer in the Manchester Guardian wrote: \\"A graceful style and an intimate knowledge of seventeenth-century England are the outstanding features of Miss Reid's novel\\".Manchester Guardian, 12 April 1932. The reviewer in the New York Times wrote: \\"The strength of the book lies in its abnegation. By deliberate concentration on what might, at first sight, appear to be historically of least importance the author has succeeded in reproducing the spirit of the period – which determined the events.\\"New York Times, 18 September 1932. Emily The reviewer in the Daily Telegraph wrote: \\"Miss Reid must have been studying life in Bloomsbury, or Chelsea, or one of the more precious of our garden suburbs. The experience has diverted her thoughts for the moment from matters historical, and she has Produced 'Emily' for amusement – hers and ours. The cranks, the nut-eaters, the uplifters, the earnest remakers of post-war Europe are paraded in company with the most comic little group of Balkan intriguers London has ever sheltered\\".Daily Telegraph, 10 October 1933. The reviewer in Time and Tide wrote: \\"It is a relief to come across a book so utterly joyous, irresponsible and deliciously mad as Emily.\\"Time and Tide, 23 September 1933. The Times Literary Supplement reviewer wrote: \\"Miss Reid has taken a holiday from the seventeenth century, and her new book is a modern extravaganza, very wittily performed\\".Times Literary Supplement, 14 September 1933. The reviewer in John O'London's Weekly wrote: \\"Miss H.S.Reid, whose amusing novel Emily has just appeared, went to Somerville College, Oxford, after first studying art. She worked as a nurse and as a schoolmistress before starting to write. She is an authority on witchcraft and village drama.\\" John O'London's Weekly, 30 September 1933. Ashley Hamel The review of Ashley Hamel in the Sunday Times described the novel as \\"a piece of very good work\\" which is \\"both lively and shrewd\\". It describes the novel as marking the changes, social, political, and ecclesiastical, in a Dorsetshire village from the 18th century to the present day.Sunday Times, 30 October 1939. Ashley Hamel was also reviewed in The Times. The review includes: \\"Miss Reid is not a sentimentalist. She records changes without defending or decrying them, and after their moments of grief or joy her characters must insensibly resume the ordinary round\\".The Times, 4 October 1939. The reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement wrote: \\"It is a shrewd piece of work, gracefully carried out, and one takes great pleasure in the reasonable mind behind it\\".Times Literary Supplement, 18 November 1939. The reviewer in the Manchester Guardian wrote: \\"Miss Reid has a keen sense of the general ideas dominating English life at particular periods, and she is particularly successful with her eccentrics, such as Mr.Finch, the curate in charge in the days of pluralism, who, having conceived a boyish devotion to Marie Antoinette, holds himself partly responsible for her death because of his revolutionary opinions\\".Manchester Guardian, 17 October 1939.

Miss Hilda Reid has had not only books and the parish records and magazines for her material but personal memories of parishioners going far back into the nineteenth century. One of them has recalled for her a lady whose pony, after being un- harnessed from his basket carriage at the front door, walked up the steps and through the house to his stable in the garden.\\" The reviewer in the South London Observer of The Story of the County of London Branch wrote: \\"That story is told tersely, economically and factually by Hilda Reid, which recalls the nights of fire and explosion, particularly in south London\\".South London Observer, 10 December 1948. The reviewer in the Evening News wrote of the \\"heroic work\\" of the Red Cross nurses during the war years, and describes Hilda Reid as seeing \\"much of the organisation's work during the war years while working with the Civil Defence.\\"Evening News, 9 December 1948. The book carried a foreword by Mrs Winston Churchill. Later life Hilda Reid never married. During the Second World War Hilda Reid worked as an air raid warden in the Chelsea borough of London, where she lived at 46 Tedworth Square with her sister Lesley (who worked during the war at the secret cryptographic centre at Bletchley Park), and her mother Agnes Imogen Reid. After the war Hilda Reid wrote several unpublished novels and plays, and was for many years secretary of the Chelsea Society. Her unpublished novels include Tolpuddle House, Leaving Briarly, Thel, Egypt End, and Egremont. Her unpublished plays include The Jest of Fame, and The Burning Deck.

It is one of the rare existing ancient remnants in city of Kollam (Quilon) - Commercial Capital of ancient Malabar coast. The Canal is believed to be a key conduit built by the Portuguese some 450 years ago inside their strategic territory, the Fort Thomas. Quilon along with Tangasseri was one among the ancient Portuguese settlements in Asia. History Buckingham Canal was actually built by the Portuguese who were settled in Quilon city before 450 years, inside their strategic territory. This canal inside the Fort was used for safe transportation of personnel and merchandise to and from the ships which called at the port. The Portuguese were settled at Quilon and gained monopoly over the region’s lucrative pepper trade. Old Quilon city was very famous for its fine quality pepper and the name Kollam is believed to have been derived from the Sanskrit word Kollam means pepper. Barges were said to have been used for transportation through the Canal. Thangassery is a projection into the sea and both ends of the Canal originally opened at the Arabian Sea then. After Portuguese, the Dutch have establish their domination in Quilon city & port based pepper trade, attacked and captured the Fort from the Portuguese. By 1662, Tangasseri became an exclusive trade hub of the Dutch. The canal came to be known as the Buckingham Canal, later when Dutch surrendered it to the British East India Company in 1795. Encroachments Various rampant reclamation activities were found out at the Buckingham Canal area many times. A builder have started construction at the adjoining plot in 2012. The main problem with the canal is even people in the neighbourhood are not aware of the exact ownership of the properties alongside the canal. A survey conducted in 1980 by the Kollam West Village Office revealed that Buckingham canal was around 750 metres long and about 100 feet wide. Now it is two feet to 10 feet wide narrow stream and all the other portions got encroached. Tangasseri in Kollam city is the only place mentioned in the Kerala Tourism’s official literature as the place in the State where Anglo-Indian tradition is maintained. But almost all the colonial constructions got erased except the lighthouse built by the British in 1902.

The title is a play on that of the 1957 horror movie, I Was a Teenage Werewolf. The film explores the marked discomfort among many young, progressive women to identify themselves as feminists and how that discomfort came to be. Through personal narrative as well as interviews with feminist icons and everyday women and men, Shechter’s film documents a complex, multi- generational look at feminist identity in today’s world. The film had its television premiere on March 8, 2005 (International Women's Day) Canada's W Network, and it won Best Film at the National Council of Jewish Women Film Festival and Special Mention at the Karachi International Film Festival in 2006. Synopsis I Was A Teenage Feminist examines how and why an uneasiness with the word \\"feminist\\" has developed among modern, young women. Throughout the film, Shechter expresses her own struggle with identity as it relates to modern feminism and past iterations of the feminist movements. To illustrate Shechter’s beginnings as the titular Teenage Feminist, the film uses music and scenes from \\"Free to Be… You and Me\\", archival footage from dated educational movies and home videos of Shechter as a teenager. The film analyzes the history of feminism as well as its impact on modern culture through interviews with well-known academics and activists such as: Gloria Steinem, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Elaine Alvarez, Jennifer Pozner, Jennifer Baumgardner, Nancy Scibilia and the NYC Radical Cheerleaders. I Was A Teenage Feminist also contains on-the-street style interviews with men and women in New York City, capturing candid discussions on the word \\"feminist.\\" Shechter incorporates her own family members and friends, documenting how their opinions of feminism have changed over time. The soundtrack includes music by Ani DiFranco, Lavababy, Gina Young, Moxie Starpark and \\"I Am Woman\\", in versions sung by both Helen Reddy and Farrell Burk. Production Therese Shechter directed and produced the film through her production company, Trixie Films. Other documentaries produced by Trixie Films include the feature How to Lose Your Virginity and the shorts How I Learned to Speak Turkish and #SlutWalkNYC. Trixie Films is currently based in Brooklyn, NY. I Was A Teenage Feminist began production in 2001, originally as part of an assignment for a documentary film course at Union Theological Seminary taught by filmmaker Macky Alston. She filmed the movie over the next 4 years in New York, Washington D.C., Chicago and Toronto. In 2003, she pitched the work-in- progress at Hot Docs' Toronto Documentary Forum, which led to a production and broadcast partnership with UpFront Productions and the W Network. Use in Education & Festival History I Was A Teenage Feminist is frequently screened at colleges across the globe as part of Gender & Women's Studies courses. Notable screenings include Duke University (2005), The American Center of New Delhi (2009) and the New Humanist House of Sydney (2013). In addition, the film has screened at American and international film festivals such as: In Other Words (Portland, 2013), 10th International Women's Film Festival (Seoul, 2008), Cinema Politica Film Series (Dublin, 2010 & 2015), Karachi International Film Festival (Karachi, 2006) and the National Council of Jewish Women Film Festival. Critical reception Bitch Magazine said of the film, \\"Evidence that feminism - whether second wave, third wave or no wave - hasn't ceased to be a vital, many-hued movement with something to offer women of any age.\\" The St. John's International Women's Film Festival wrote, \\"This film should be a primer for every Women’s Studies student, but it is so wise and lively that you should bring along your fathers, brothers and boyfriends.\\" Danielle Kraten of Ms Magazine wrote, \\"The ’50s horror movie-style title of Therese Shechter’s documentary isn’t accidental: The 40-year-old feminist saw younger women all but shriek in fear and run to escape the so-called f-word.\\" John Doyle of The Globe and Mail reviewed the film as \\"cheerful and straightforward.\\" Danielle Devereaux of The Scope wrote that \\"Shecter's quest to find feminism reveals that social movements, like identities, are never simple.\\"  References   External links  * * Official I Was a Teenage Feminist Website * Women Make Movies Film Page Category:2005 films Category:Documentary films about feminism Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Canadian documentary films Category:Canadian films Category:2005 documentary films ","title":"I Was a Teenage Feminist"},{"id":"46178738","text":"Vizeleutnant, short Vzlt (en: Vice lieutenant), is a rank of the higher non- commissioned officers NCO rank group (also rank group: Stabsunteroffiziere) in the Austrian Bundesheer.

This 1-1/2 story Cape style house was built in 1785 for Rev. Peter Powers, the first settled minister of the town, and is the oldest surviving house in the town. It is also architecturally distinctive as a rare regional example of a gambrel-roofed Cape. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Powers House is set on the south side of Sunshine Road, just east of its junction with Maine State Route 15 and about south of the central village of Deer Isle. The house is oriented facing south, away from the road and toward a cove that is connected to the island's Southeast Harbor. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a central chimney, gambrel roof, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. It has very plain exterior styling, with a center entrance flanked by sash windows. A second entry was added c. 1960 to the east side in a projecting single-story gambrel-roofed vestibule. The interior is simple but well-preserved, with two rooms on each floor, and original fireplaces. The First Congregational Church of Deer Isle was organized in 1773, and in 1785 offered its first permanent ministerial position to Peter Powers of Newbury, Vermont. Powers was a prominent Harvard-educated minister who had helped found Dartmouth College in 1769, whose previous parish he had been at odds with over its political leanings toward the British during the recently ended American Revolutionary War. Powers served the community until his death in 1800. The house built for him 1785 is oldest intact house of the period in Deer Isle, and is rare in the state for its use of a gambrel roof, particularly on a Cape style house.

The organisms of this order are characterized by a skeleton cross link with a cone or ring.  Introduction  Nassellaria is an order of Radiolaria under the class Polycystina. These organisms are unicellular eukaryotic heterotrophic plankton typically with a siliceous cone-shaped skeleton. The most common group of radiolarians are the polycystine radiolarians, which are divided into two subgroups: the spumellarians and the nassellarians. Both spumellarians and nassellarians are common chert-forming microfossils and are important in stratigraphical dating, as the oldest radiolarians are Precambrian in age. The nassellarians appear in the fossil record much later than their other polycystine relatives, the spumellarians. spumellarians can be seen as far back as the Precambrian, whereas nassellarians do not begin to appear until the Carboniferous. Nassellarians are believed to be have been increasing in species diversity since the beginning of the Cenozoic. Nassellarians have been and continue to be some of the most remarkable and aesthetically interesting protists both alive and in the fossil record. They occupy an important role ecologically and have done so since the Precambrian. There is still much we do not know about these protists, and discovering more will require the continued interdisciplinary effort of many scientists.  Morphology  The holotype morphology of the Nassellarian order as described by Anderson and Boltovsky et al is of an egg-shaped central capsule (the part of the cell containing one or more nuclei, Golgi bodies, mitochondria, lysosomes, and other bodies important for cellular function) located within a porous conical skeleton made of silica. The central capsule is typically located toward the apical end of the skeleton. The basal end is usually in the shape of a hollow circle, giving the skeleton a conical look. Surrounding the central capsule, but still inside of the skeleton, is the extracapsulum. This material is primarily alveoli, gas- filled bubble-like structures that regulate the buoyancy of the organism. The alveoli are connected by a web of rhizopodia throughout the extracapsulum. Fusules connect the intracapsulum (central capsule) to the extracapsulum. Axopodia and additional fusules extend out of the basal opening and through the pores in the skeleton. These will act as feeding apparatuses for the nassellarian. ; skeletons File:Anthocyrtium hispidum Haeckel - Radiolarian (34986365113).jpg Anthocyrtium hispidum File:Anthocyrtis grossularia Ehrenberg - Radiolarian (34728144180).jpg Anthocyrtis grossularia File:Radiolarie - Radiolaria (fossile) - 250x - Artostrobus sp.

There exist three basic types of nassellarian skeletons. The first is formed from the connection of three elongate spicules at a central point. The three spicules are arranged in a single plane so that they are 120 degrees apart from each other. This is typically referred to as a “tripod” structure. The second skeleton type common in nassellarians is the aforementioned conical, porous skeleton. The third type is of a ring surrounding a latticed shell. These three skeleton types can be mixed and matched to create seven skeleton categories in nassellarians. Even the simplest classifications of nassellarian morphology is complicated because of the wide variety of morphologies in the nassellarian order even when compared with their sister group, the spumellarians. The innate nature of the nassellarian geometry lends itself to diversity, which may be one of the factors leading to the rapid diversification of the nassellarians in comparison to the spumellarians during the Cenozoic. Many nassellarians are segmented, meaning there are circular skeletal divisions that exist equatorially along the skeletal cone. These divisions are called strictures. The strictures divide the organism into segments, typically giving it a more bulbous shape. Some nassellarians also exhibit spines from the apical end or along the lateral sides of the cone. Spines along the basal aperture of the organism are called feet.  Ecology  Many nassellarians house dinoflagellate symbionts within their tests. The nassellarian provides ammonium and carbon dioxide for the dinoflagellate, while the dinoflagellate provides the nassellarian with a mucous membrane useful for hunting and protection against harmful invaders. There is evidence from small subunit ribosomal DNA analysis of these dinoflagellate symbionts that dinoflagellate symbiosis with radiolarians evolved independently of other dinoflagellate symbioses (e.g. foraminifera). Small subunit ribosomal DNA analysis also shows evidence that no coevolution of the dinoflagellates and radiolarians has occurred. Nassellarian feeding is mainly done through extension of pseudopodia out of the basal opening. The axial projection is a very long pseudopodium that extend out of the basal aperture and is surrounded by shorter terminal projections which form a terminal cone around the axial projection. The feeding in segmented Nassellarians is done in three phases: 1) extension, 2) capture, and 3) retraction. The geometry of nasselarians is quite beneficial for this feeding mechanism, as food passes through the basal aperture, which is much larger than the pores in the rest of the skeleton, which is how most spumellarians must transport food. A second variety of nassellarians feed without using an axial projection at all. These organisms instead form a wide terminal cone, which they cast out behind them from the basal aperture like a fishing net. The three phases of feeding used by segmented nassellarians are also evident in these nassellarians. These “fishing net” nassellarians are much easier to see feeding in the wild and present quite a spectacular sight. Nassellarians feed on other plankton such as small algae, bacteria, diatoms, and small zooplankton.  Fossil History  Early Paleozoic radiolarian fossil history is dominated by Spumellaria until the Carboniferous period, during which nassellarian fauna experienced a sharp increase in diversity. Nassellarian and spumellarian diversities have been relatively similar since the Mesozoic, with drops in diversity after mass extinction events and a rise in both spumellarian and nassellarian diversity during the Quaternary. Symbioses between algae and radiolarians is observed frequently in extant species, but the evolution and timing of this symbiosis is currently unknown, as the symbiotic algae do not leave behind hard skeletons to fossilize. It may be possible to answer this question using isotopic analysis, as algal symbionts preferentially uptake carbon-12, so symbiont-bearing calcareous organisms such as Foraminifera become enriched in carbon-13 compared to non symbiont-bearing calcareous organisms. If fossil evidence can be gathered for isotopic ratio analysis, the time window for appearance of algal symbionts with nassellarians and/or spumellarians should be able to be restricted in geologic time.

Cantrell won the talent portion and a $2,000 scholarship during Thursday night's preliminary competition for again singing the aria \\"Tu? tu? Piccolo iddio!\\" from Puccini's Madama Butterfly. In the final round of the competition, Cantrell was asked a question by judge Brett Eldredge: \\"New England quarterback Tom Brady was suspended for his part in the so-called 'Deflategate' scandal. Legalities aside, did Tom Brady cheat?\\" Cantrell, who was given 20 seconds to answer, said: \\"Did he cheat? That's a really good question. I'm not sure. I think I'd have to be there and see the ball and feel it and make sure it was deflated or not deflated. If there was a question there, then yes, I think he cheated.\\" Asked later by a reporter about her response, Cantrell said \\"It was kind of a funky question...I'm not a football player, and I really wasn't there to feel that ball.\\" She beat out first runner-up Miss Mississippi 2015, Hannah Roberts, for the 2016 title and was crowned by Miss America 2015, Kira Kazantsev of New York, on September 13, 2015.

In early 2000, EUROCONTROL started researching Time Based Separation (TBS), a new operating procedure for separating aircraft by time during strong headwind conditions, instead of distance. TBS addresses headwind disruptions by reducing the spacing between pairs of aircraft. As wake decay is more rapid in strong headwinds conditions, wake vortex is quickly dispersed permitting a safe reduction in the spacing between aircraft through TBS preserving runway throughput. NATS joined the TBS research in SESAR and is now preparing its first deployment for spring 2015 at London Heathrow airport. Furthermore, TBS is now a part of the SESAR Deployment Programme. Time Based Separation was successfully implemented at Heathrow by NATS and Leidos working in conjunction with Heathrow Airport on 24 March 2015 and has been in continuous operation since then. In March 2018 it was further enhanced to include Optimised Runway Delivery (ORD), Runway Occupancy Time and RECAT EU Wake categories. Results have been very successful with a c.62% reduction in arrival delays due to headwinds and a marked improvement in overall airport punctuality. Weather dependent Future steps in research linked to TBS will involve Weather Dependent Separations (WDS) on arrival taking into account different parameters such as weather and wind forecasts. WDS will support an increase in runway throughput whilst TBS preserves current runway throughput. Related systems The application of reduced separations in strong headwinds conditions requires the development of a new Air Traffic Controller support tool to optimise delivery of accurate and safe separation at the runway threshold.

First found to be variable in 1965, it is a W Ursae Majoris variable with a maximum apparent magnitude 10.82. It drops by 0.33 magnitudes during primary eclipses with a period of 0.3134 days, while dropping by 0.29 magnitudes during secondary eclipses. The primary star, which is also the cooler star, appears to have a spectral type of F6V, while the secondary is slightly cooler with a spectral type of G5V. With a mass of 1.29 solar masses and a luminosity of 2.71 solar luminosities, it is slightly more massive and luminous than the sun, while the secondary is only around 1/10 as massive and less than half as luminous. With a separation of 2.20 solar radii, the mass transfer of about 2×10−7 solar masses per year from the secondary to the primary is one of the highest known for a system of its type. V1191 Cygni is a W-type W UMa variable, meaning that the primary eclipse occurs when the less-massive component is eclipsed by the larger, more massive component, although the masses are unusually different for such a system. The current period is very short for a system of its spectral type, suggesting that the stars are relatively small for their mass and age, which is likely around 3.85 billion years. The pair's orbital period is increasing at a rate of over 4 days per year, one of the fastest known rates among contact binary systems, likely due to the high rate of mass transfer. In addition to the period increase, there is cyclic period change of 0.023 days over 26.7 years, caused by either a third body with a mass of 0.77 solar masses or magnetic activity cycles. The mass transfer will likely eventually cause the system to evolve into a single star with a very high rotation rate.

The parish includes the hamlets of Foxley and Bremilham (also known as Cowage). The Sherston branch of the Bristol Avon forms the north boundary of the parish. History Bronze Age ring ditches and signs of early medieval or Saxon settlement are in the east of the parish, near Cowage Farm. The Fosse Way Roman road forms the west boundary of the parish, where it is a bridleway. The east-west road between Malmesbury and Sherston passes through Foxley and Bremilham. From the late 17th century until 1756 this was the main route between Oxford and Bristol. Foxley and Bremilham were separate ecclesiastical parishes until 1893 when Bremilham was united with Foxley. In 1934 Foxley (with Bremilham) was transferred to the civil parish of Norton.  Religious sites   Norton  The Anglican Church of All Saints at Norton is Grade II listed. There was probably a church in the 13th century, which was rebuilt in the 15th and restored in 1854 for Joseph Neeld of Grittleton House. A font from the late 12th or early 13th century survives from the earlier church. Today All Saints, together with the churches at Foxham and Bremilham, is part of the Gauzebrook group of churches.  Foxley  Foxley church There was a church at Foxley in the 12th century or earlier, perhaps linked to Malmesbury Abbey. There was a rector by 1300. The small church, which has no dedication, is built of coursed rubble with some herringbone masonry. Thirteenth-century work survives in the north arcade and the font is from the same period. The church was altered and re-roofed in the 15th century, and the tower built or rebuilt. In the 17th century the south aisle and north chapel were demolished, and around 1708 the south porch with stone pediment was added. A clock by Charles Frodsham & Co was installed in the tower in 1873. The interior of the church was renovated in the early 20th century; it was recorded as Grade I listed in 1959. In 1874 the benefice was authorized to be united with Bremilham, and this became effective in 1893; by that time parishioners of Bremilham attended Foxley church. From 1951 the benefice of Foxley with Bremilham was held in plurality with that of Corston with Rodbourne.  Bremilham  The small church at Cowage Farm, Bremilham is the remainder or partial rebuilding of a 15th-century church, used for a time as a mortuary chapel. Manor houses There are two manor houses. Norton Manor is from the early 17th century and is Grade II* listed. Foxley Manor is from a similar date and is Grade II listed. (Not to be confused with Foxley House, next to the church and also Grade II listed). Local government There is no elected parish council, instead an annual Parish meeting is held. The parish is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Amenities Norton has a pub and restaurant, the Vine Tree.

Biography Robert describes himself in the title of his work as \\"Keeper of the Registry of the Court of Canterbury\\". Beyond this fact nothing is known of him. He compiled a history of the \\"mirabilia gesta\\" of Edward III down to 1356; his chief interest is in military history, and especially in the French war. To ecclesiastical and civil affairs he pays little attention. His work opens with a short sketch of the reign of Edward II, and the wars with Scotland are told with comparative brevity. The continental wars from 1339 to 1356 occupy nine- tenths of his narrative. Robert is no more than a painstaking chronicler, but his history has special importance because he incorporated in his text original documents and letters, including those of Michael de Northburgh. There are three manuscripts: Harleian MS. 200 in the British Museum, Douce MS. 128 in the Bodleian Library, and Trinity College MS. R v. 32; the first is the archetype, the two latter are derived from it through an intermediate copy. Robert of Avesbury's chronicle (\\"Historia de Mirabilibus Gestis Edwardi III\\") was published by Thomas Hearne, Oxford, 1720. It has been re-edited by Sir E.

He was named after his aunt Ilana Neeman, who was murdered in the Maalot massacre – the May 1974 terrorist massacre of 22 children and three adults in a Ma'a lot school by armed members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. He is secular. Mayor of Safed Shohat was first elected Mayor of Safed, a city in the Israeli Galilee, in 2008. He was a representative of an independent list identified with Kadima and was supported by Yisrael Beiteinu and the Labor Party. In 2009, he visited Bowling Green, Kentucky, asking for help providing transportable bomb shelters to Israel. In 2010 Shohat was Israel's youngest mayor. In 2012, he was investigated on suspicion of taking a bribe during the 2008 elections, but the Northern District Prosecutor's Office decided to close the case. He was re-elected Mayor easily in 2013. That year, Shohat stirred controversy when he decided that a medical school should be built in the city that would attract many non-Jewish students. In December 2014 he indicated that though he considers \\"the absorption of the wounded Syrians a moral and Jewish obligation of the first degree\\", he wanted the Israeli Health Ministry to, instead of directing wounded Syrians to hospitals in the North of Israel that are facing financial issues, send them to better-equipped hospitals in central Israel. He ran for local office in Safed as a member of the Likud and also ran for the head of Kadima. He joined Yisrael Beiteinu in 2012. Election to the Israeli Knesset Shohat won a seat in the Israeli Knesset in 2015 when he was in the fourth slot on the Yisrael Beiteinu list for the 2015 Knesset elections. His party received six seats in the election. One week after he was elected to the Knesset and days before he was scheduled to be sworn in, Shohat chose not to take his seat.

Digital Surgery is a health tech company shaping the future of surgery through the convergence of surgical expertise and technology. The app was first discussed in 2010.\\"Touch Surgery: the iPad app that teaches surgeons how to operate,\\" by Oliver Wainwright, The Guardian, February 27, 2013, retrieved March 18, 2015. The Touch Surgery mobile app is a mobile surgical training platform designed to simulate surgical procedures.\\"Surgeons develop app to practise surgery,\\" by Parul Agrawal, BBC News, June 15, 2013, retrieved March 19, 2015.\\"Touch Surgery: learning surgery on the operating table,\\" by Joao Mederios, Wired, July 28, 2014, retrieved March 18, 2014. As of October 2019, The Touch Surgery mobile app included surgical instructions for about 200 surgical procedures in 17 different specialties.\\"Touch Surgery Simulations\\", retrieved October 2, 2019.  Validation Studies  Touch Surgery app has been validated by over 19 independent peer-reviewed publications for its innovative approach to training surgeons virtually. The McDougal principles of validation (construct, face and content) have been conducted by 4 research groups. Each of the groups belonged to a different procedures, surgical specialties and institutions. The first paper was from an orthopaedic team in London (UK), followed by a Plastic surgical team at Stanford Hospital in Stanford (USA) an oro-maxillofacial team at Mount Sinai in New York (USA) and a General Surgery team in Heidelberg (Germany). Construct validation tests the ability of the simulator to differentiate between different experience groups. Content validation is the expert opinion of content within the simulations with focus on the accuracy of the anatomy, steps and use of instruments. Face validation is the subjective assessment of the platform as a training tool (face value). Statistical significance was demonstrated in all studies proving repeatability of validation irrespective of procedure, specialty and location. Learning curves and knowledge transfer Participants naive to Intramedullary femoral nailing and Touch Surgery were assessed on an exam paper created to assess their understanding of the surgical procedure. The participants then used the app for learning and regularly tested themselves on the app. Finally they retook the exam-paper to see how much they had learned. Mastery on the app took 6 consecutive repetitions. A significant rise in score was noted and scores rivaled that of the surgeons that validated the exam paper. Training Efficiency The cardiothoracic team at Stanford assessed medical students on their understanding of Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) on a 25 question exam. The exam had been validated by five cardiac surgeons. The medical students were then randomly allocated to use either the text based resources or the Touch Surgery app. The students were allowed to use the resource for 45 minutes and then retook the exam on CPB. Baseline test showed that there was no difference between the two groups before intervention; however there was a statistically significant difference in the two groups after the 45 minute preparation session. This study demonstrated that Touch Surgery could outperform traditional text-based learning tools. In another randomised controlled trial of skills transfer from Touch Surgery to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the Touch Surgery app has proved effective for providing cognitive training in laparoscopic cholecystectomies to medical students.  Microsoft Partnership  In October 2018, Touch Surgery (Digital Surgery) and Microsoft announced their partnership and their aim to make operations safer by using Microsoft Hololens. The company has been made an official Microsoft Mixed Reality Partner and is creating mixed-reality apps and programs for Microsoft HoloLens to help surgeons as they work.  Safe Surgery 2020  In January, 2019 Safe Surgery 2020 and Digital Surgery have launched their simulation training platform, Touch Surgery, in Tanzania to upskill surgical workers in Tanzania and East Africa. Safe Surgery 2020 is a collaboration of foundations, nonprofits, educational institutions and local governments who want to make surgery safe, affordable and accessible across the world. Assist International, Digital Surgery and local health facilities and hospitals, including Kijabe Hospital in Kenya, have been collaborating closely to develop a series of simulation trainings for the most common procedures provided by primary facilities in LMICs, such as C-sections and hysterectomies. The simulations are developed specifically for surgical teams operating in low- resource settings to ensure the procedure is achievable with basic instruments. The simulation integrates the WHO's surgical safety checklist to reinforce the importance of following the checklist to improve patient outcomes. The Safe Surgery 2020 hospitals received in-person and tele- mentoring training and education on the Touch Surgery app as well as practical tools such as tablets in each facility for continuous learning.

The battle began on 25 March 2015, as pro-Saleh troops seized control of Aden International Airport and Hadi fled the country by boat. On 16 July the pro-Hadi forces again seized control of Aden port and were moving into the city's commercial center. On 22 July, pro-Hadi forces had retaken full control of Aden, and the Aden Airport was reopened. In late July, an offensive launched by pro-Hadi forces drove Houthi forces out of the towns neighboring Aden. Background The Houthis, allegedly with the support of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, took control of the Yemeni government in a takeover. President Hadi was placed under virtual house arrest, but after a month, he managed to escape to his hometown of Aden in Yemen's south. After fighting over the airport broke out in Aden on 19 March and Sana'a was hit by a suicide bombing attack the following day, the Houthi Revolutionary Committee formed to govern the country after the coup declared a state of \\"general mobilisation\\". With the support of some army elements, the Houthis launched a military offensive to take control of the south and defeat Hadi's holdouts. Yemen's third city of Taiz fell with little resistance, followed by Lahij and the strategic Al Anad Air Base north of Aden. Battle Fighting begins On 25 March, fighting spread to Aden, as army units loyal to Saleh captured Aden International Airport and a nearby airbase after clashes with pro-Hadi Southern Movement fighters. The airport suspended all flights. Civilians stormed an army base in central Aden in an attempt to seize weapons, leaving five dead and 12 wounded. Houthi fighters pressing from the north reached the outskirts of the port city. Hadi fled Aden by boat. His whereabouts were not known until 26 March, when he landed in Saudi Arabia hours after the kingdom began an air campaign to defeat the Houthis. By 27 March, Houthi and allied army units had encircled Aden, taking control of all land routes into and out of the city. However, warplanes from the Saudi-led coalition began to bedevil the Houthis as they moved their heavy armour and vehicles toward Aden, with airstrikes halting a convoy from Shuqrah early on 28 March. Also on 28 March, several people were killed in a series of explosions at an arms depot in Aden, amid looting by residents after the depot's guards abandoned their posts. By this point, the death toll in Aden, since fighting in the city started, had reached 75 people. Clashes intensify Map of the pro-Houthi attack on Aden Clashes in Aden continued on 29 March, as fighting continued in northern Aden and the Houthis pushed into central Aden. Forces loyal to Hadi reportedly retook Aden International Airport, with nine Houthi fighters and five pro-Hadi fighters among the dead. The Houthis and Saleh-loyal military units continued their attack on Aden on 30 March, firing artillery and rockets against the city near the Alam roundabout and attempting to advance deeper into it. Houthis fighters reportedly came under fire from Egyptian warships, which shelled their positions from off the southern coast. At least two airstrikes forced them to retreat toward Zinjibar, and the Popular Committees loyal to Hadi held their ground. Saudi planes also struck near Aden International Airport. At least 36 were killed by shelling and airstrikes, with 26 dying in artillery fire on the Khormaksar district of Aden, including 10 in a residential building reportedly taken over by fighters loyal to Hadi. Houthi fighters retook parts of Aden International Airport and clashed with pro-Hadi fighters across the city on 1 April. Even so, an aide to Hadi expressed confidence that the Aden government could defeat the ground assault without the help of foreign troops if the Houthis' supply lines were cut. Houthi positions at the airport were reportedly shelled by coalition warships. Later, Houthi and allied Army units advanced in a tank column into Aden's Khormaksar district and the city center, where they battled with pro-Hadi troops and local residents for control. Battle for central districts The following day, Houthi and allied fighters took control of the central Crater neighbourhood, backed by tanks and armored vehicles. They also took control of the presidential palace, although overnight air raids prompted them to make a tactical withdrawal. The Houthis temporarily retreated from the Crater district as well, losing two tanks and 10 fighters. Coalition planes airdropped weapons and medical aid to Aden's defenders. However, on 5 April, the Houthi advance resumed. The group again retook central neighbourhoods and bombarded others, but were pushed back when they attempted to move toward the city's port. According to a pro-Hadi militia, 36 Houthi and allied fighters were killed in clashes in Aden's Mualla district, while 11 pro-Hadi fighters died. A medic said Houthi snipers took up positions on rooftops in the area. On 6 April, the Houthis and allied army units made their largest push yet, attacking holdouts in the Mualla district. Pro-Hadi fighters claimed three hostile tanks destroyed overnight, but the Houthis deployed additional tanks to the area by morning. Medical facilities in the city were reportedly overwhelmed, bodies cluttered the streets, and a number of buildings were set on fire. The Red Cross warned of a \\"catastrophic\\" humanitarian situation as fighting continued. Eighteen died in fighting overnight into 7 April, with 53 killed over the previous 24 hours. Dozens of Houthi fighters and allied troops pushed into the Crater district on 8 April, backed by a tank and two armoured vehicles. Residents said three arms depots under the control of the Houthis or pro-Saleh troops were bombed by aircraft in northern Aden on the same day. Sunni mosques in the city reportedly called residents to jihad against the city's attackers. The push into Crater was reportedly mostly repulsed by mid- afternoon, and Houthi fighters were also cleared from some northern neighbourhoods. As fighting persisted, Saudi-led coalition warships blasted Houthi positions from offshore on 10 April. The extent of the damage from the naval bombardment was not immediately clear. Reuters reported on 11 April that two Quds Force officers from Iran were captured in separate districts by militiamen defending the city from the Houthis. By 13 April, the presidential palace complex was once again under Houthi control, but being hit by air-strikes. On 14 April, after prolonged clashes, Houthi fighters withdrew from Aden's Khormaksar district—the location of the international airport and foreign missions. Coalition warships bombarded Houthi-occupied buildings as fighting raged in the Mualla, Crater, and Buraiga districts on 18 April. Fighting in the Buraiga district centered on control of the city's only refinery. On 17 April, pro-Hadi fighters from Lahj and al-Anad air base launched an assault towards the south and gained ground along the coastline from Houthi and pro-Saleh forces by 19 April, allowing them to assault the airport, which was still in the militants' hands. Pro-Hadi forces also recaptured the Russian consulate and a Hadi residence. As of 20 April, Hadi forces reportedly also seized the airport. On 28 April, Houthi forces, that took up positions at the University of Aden and the hospital in the Khormaksar district, advanced in the area and captured Hadi's family home and the German and Russian consulates. Just north of the peninsula, they also pushed west in an attempt to retake territory previously lost. The next day, the Houthis advanced towards the city center. A large shopping mall in Khormaksar reportedly caught fire amid fighting as the Houthis advanced through the neighbourhood, repulsing counter-attacks there and in the Mualla district. Eyewitnesses told the Associated Press that the Houthi fighters and their allies searched house to house in Khormaksar, dragging some men out onto the street and shooting them, while warning residents by loudspeaker against harbouring anti-Houthi fighters. On 6 May, Houthi forces captured the Tawahi district, but were later reportedly expelled from the area. The fighting killed pro-Hadi Brigadier General Ali Nasser Hadi, who was then replaced by Brigadier General Saif al-Baqri. Houthi shells also struck a boat loaded with refugees attempting to flee Aden on 6 May, killing 40. Anti-Houthi counteroffensive Map of pro-Hadi counterattack On 14 July, pro-Hadi militia in Aden retook Aden International Airport and cleared the Khormaksar district of Houthi rebels following the collapse of a humanitarian truce. As a result, this left the Houthis trapped in the peninsula. By 16 July pro-Hadi forces had retaken large parts of the port area of Mualla near Aden and entered the commercial district of Crater. On July 17, pro-Hadi militias and the government in exile said that they had \\"liberated\\" Aden from the Houthis. Despite that, the Houthis still controlled the Eastern and Northern entrances to the city and pockets of fighting were reported. Anti-Houthi forces continued to press on with their offensive by capturing two military bases, one of them in the Lahij Province and the other in the eastern Shabwa province. According to Medecins Sans Frontieres, retreating Houthis killed about 100 people in a single mortar barrage. After the last Houthi forces were driven from the city, the first aircraft to land at Aden’s reopened airport, on July 22, was a Saudi military transport bringing aid, weapons and the commander of the Saudi navy. Aftermath On 30 July, anti-Houthi forces launched an offensive outside of Aden and drove the Houthis from Muthalath al- Ilm, the Ya'wala, Al-Basateen, and Qariat al-Falahi neighbourhoods, and clashed with Houthi fighters in the Lahij province. The militias captured more territory from the Houthis on the following day, including the town of Houta with support from the Saudi airstrikes. On 3 August, Hadi loyalists, backed by Saudi and UAE ground forces, advanced to the north of Aden and successfully recaptured the Al Anad Air Base. Major General Jaafar Mohammed Saad, who played a prominent role in planning the operation that pushed pro-Houthi fighters out of Aden in July, was appointed as Governor of Aden in October 2015. However, his tenure proved short-lived; he was assassinated in a bombing allegedly perpetrated by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant on 6 December 2015. Combatants As of 10 April, The New York Times reported, most of Aden's defenders were residents who took up arms against the invaders, forming loosely organised militias to protect their own neighbourhoods. The militiamen include supporters of the separatist Southern Movement. Many of Hadi's loyalists deserted earlier in the battle, after their president fled the country. By contrast, the bulk of the attacking force was composed of troops and militiamen loyal to Saleh, with Houthis making up a minority. Many of the Houthi fighters captured during the fighting reportedly had been told they were in Aden to fight al-Qaeda. Foreign role Humanitarian Several countries moved to evacuate their citizens from Aden as the fighting worsened. China's People's Liberation Army Navy evacuated several hundred, including hundreds of non-Chinese citizens, from Aden in early April. A Turkish frigate also evacuated 55 Turks from the city. The INS Mumbai, an Indian Navy destroyer, evacuated 441 Indian and other foreign nationals from Aden to Djibouti on 4 April. On 8 April, Medecins Sans Frontiers and the International Committee of the Red Cross were successful in delivering 2.5 tonnes of medicine and a surgical team, respectively, by boat to Aden. The surgical team was deployed to a local hospital. On 21 July 2015, the first ship carrying aid from the World Food Programme docked in Aden, carrying enough food to last 180,000 people a month. The ship had waited at sea for four months, unable to dock because of fighting in the port area. Military Egyptian warships shelled Houthi positions as they advanced on critical points in Aden, and coalition warplanes repeatedly struck the attackers, as well as installations they seized. Saudi Arabia reportedly inserted special forces troops into Aden, which a Saudi official told CNN were \\"coordinating and guiding\\" resistance to the Houthis and their allies. The Saudi government declined to officially comment on whether it had commandos on the ground in Aden. On 3 May, a small force of no more than 50 fighters from at least three Arab countries reportedly landed near Aden International Airport and took up arms against troops loyal to Saleh. A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition denied that \\"foreign forces\\" were in Aden. Hadi's foreign minister said the fighters were Yemeni special forces troops retrained outside the country and sent back into Aden. Anti-Houthi militiamen claimed to have captured an Iranian colonel and captain in the Quds Force, a special division of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, during fighting in Aden in April. They said the Iranians were working as \\"advisors\\" to the Houthi militias and would be turned over to the coalition.

(in a review he wrote published in the Vancouver Sun), called the book \\"important\\" continuing \\"Schneider has done a fine job with this study, and anyone in Canada who cares about policing, privacy, civil liberties and personal freedom should read it\\". Sandborn, however also lamented that Schneider’s “prose style is unfortunately a bit fusty and mannered, as is so often true of those who write from a faculty office.” Likewise, Maclean’s described the book as “dense with academic terminology”. Tom Sandborn suggests that Schneider misses the mark because “he unfortunately pays more attention to how Canadian police forces use various net platforms to communicate with the public than to how those same cyber entities can be tapped by government spies to illicitly harvest information about Canadians”. While some reviews were positive, others noted some weaknesses with Schneider’s approach. Christopher D. O’Conner noted a “substantial critique of the book is that Schneider’s analysis is limited to texts. At times, the author makes claims regarding police intent without conducting interviews with officers about their own social media use. While text analysis is a completely valid methodological approach, interviewing officers would have provided a more well-rounded picture of the impact social media is having on policing.” https://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/3365/3521 Likewise, Sarah Lageson sounds a note of caution about the book: “Because Schneider relies heavily on qualitative media analysis, readers might sense they are receiving a second-order interpretation of what happened. We don’t get direct ethnographic insight into the internal processes of police departments as they grapple with using social media in their own PR and investigatory work.” Lageson, Sarah (2017) “Review of Policing and Social Media: Social Control in an Era of New Media“ Contemporary Sociology: v47 n2: 217-219.

Gustav Wunderwald (1 January 1882 – 24 June 1945) was a German painter of the New Objectivity style, and a theatrical set designer.  Career  The son of the gunsmith Karl Wunderwald and his wife Adelheid née Hirtz, Gustav Wunderwald was born in Kalk, Cologne in 1882. Beginning his artistic career in 1896, Wunderwald began as an apprentice of the Cologne master painter Wilhelm Kuhn. In 1899 he became a scenery painter under Professor Max Bruckner, and from 1900 to 1904 he worked at G. Hartwig's studio for stage painting in Charlottenburg. From 1904 to 1907 he worked as a set designer at the Royal Opera in Stockholm. Then he joined the Drama and Music Executive Board of the Theatre in Düsseldorf under Louise Dumont and Gustav Lindemann. It was here that he also had the first exhibition of his art, and he met his longtime friend, the Rhenish writer and playwright Wilhelm Schmidtbonn (1876–1952). In May 1908 he married Amalie Minna Gerull (1881–1941). With her and the Schmidtbonns he spent the years 1908 to 1909 in Tegernsee. After leaving his position in Düsseldorf, which had earned him recognition from renowned theatre critics, he decided to live and work for a year \\"in nature\\", as an experiment. But in 1909 he returned to conventional employment, when he worked briefly as a member of the technical staff at the Stadttheater Innsbruck. In 1910 he moved to Freiburg, where he held the position of the Chief Stage Painter at the Municipal Theatre until 1911 . He held an exhibition in the Kunstverein Freiburg in March 1911. In 1912 Wunderwald made the longed-for career move to Berlin: He worked as a decorative painter at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in Charlottenburg until 1915, when he was called up. During World War I he was posted to the Macedonian front. Up to the war, in addition to his stage scenery work, Wunderwald created realistic paintings and drawings of the Rhineland, Tyrol, the Black Forest, Havel and East Prussian landscapes. He also did figure paintings of his wife, family members and fellow soldiers. In 1918 Wunderwald realized his lifelong dream; from that time until his death in 1945 Wunderwald worked as a freelance artist in Charlottenburg. In 1924 the Berlin Art and Landsberg bookshop displayed 20 of his works in his first comprehensive solo exhibition. In 1925 and 1926, Wunderwald was represented at the Great Berlin Art Exhibition, and from 1927 in numerous national exhibitions. His works dealt with industrial landscapes in the Berlin districts of Moabit and Wedding, street canyons of Prenzlauer Berg, tenements, houses and back-to-backs in Spandau. He painted bridges, subways, train stations, billboards, as well as villas in Charlottenburg. Rural subjects included villages in the immediate vicinity of Berlin, Havel, Spree and East Prussia landscapes. People were reduced to the role of anonymous figures seen from behind. Of this period of his creativity he wrote: \\"The saddest things hit me in the stomach. Moabit and Wedding grab me most with their sombreness and desolation\\" (1926). In 1927 on the occasion of the group exhibition \\"The face of Berlin 1926\\" at the Neumann & Nierendorf gallery, the art critic Paul Westheim (1886–1963) devoted a monographic essay to Wunderwald in the January issue of the Art Journal which he edited, in which he described Wunderwald as \\"the Berlin Utrillo\\" a label that Wunderwald felt flattered him. The final Wunderwald exhibition before the Second World War took place at the 1934 Great Berlin Art Exhibition. In the Nazi era, his works were disparaged by the authorities and from 1934 he was not allowed to exhibit or sell work. During this period he made a living tinting advertising films for Ufa and Mars Film, and looked after his wife, a seamstress. After her death, Wunderwald married Bertha Ludwig in 1941. However he himself died on 24 June 1945 in Berlin, as a result of hyponatremia (water poisoning). The rediscovery of Wunderwald after the Second World War was the work of Berlin art chief officer Friedrich Lambart with the 1950 retrospective \\"Images of Berlin\\" in the Zoo in the gardens of the town hall. It was followed by solo exhibitions in Berlin (house Lützowplatz, 1962, and Bassenge Gallery, 1971–72), Munich (Gallery Gunzenhauser, 1972) and from 1965 as a result of the growing interest in the art of New Objectivity participation in numerous national and international group exhibitions. The most comprehensive solo exhibition took place at Berlin Gallery in 1982, followed by the Städtische Galerie, Albstadt in 1982/83 on the occasion of the 100th birthday of the painter. Wunderwald's oeuvre comprises some 180 paintings, which are today located primarily in German private ownership or in the possession of the following museums: Berlin Gallery, Berlin; New National Gallery, Berlin; Berlin City Museum; City Museum, Bonn; Hessian State Museum, Darmstadt; the Theatre Studies Collection at the University of Cologne; Art Forum East German Gallery, Regensburg.

This is the last film of Xuxa to count on the production of Diler Trindade. Starring the Xuxa Meneghel with the participation of Ivete Sangalo, Murilo Rosa, Maria Clara Gueiros, Maria Mariana Azevedo, Eike Duarte, Ary Fontoura, Fabiana Karla, Thiago Martins. In the film, Xuxa serves as the twin identical sisters who were separated when they were still babies. Thirty years later, Elizabeth (Xuxa) is now president of the father's graphic arts empire, while her twin sister, Mel (Xuxa) runs a performing art school involved with a Favela. Of course, their lives intersect when the wicked Elizabeth suspends the company's sponsorship of the school of Mel, who nevertheless does not give up fighting. To complicate the plot there is a diamond that by mistake, falls into the hands of Mel. Still in 1989, Xuxa Meneghel Started working on a screenplay for a movie that would tell the story of two twin sisters and would be released in Mexico. The feature film would be signed by George Lucas, a budgeted co-production of $1.2 million that did not occur due to international commitments of Xuxa at the time. In 2006 Xuxa returned with a film project with similar script. Gemeas showed a good performance at the box office, compared to the previous, with more than 1,007,490 box office, being the last film of Xuxa with more than 1 million viewers. He obtained a gross excess of 5,801,734 reais.  Plot  One family receives a double gift on the same day: two twins who have just been born. One of them, however, very smart, crawls out of the parental car and stops inside a trailer. Created by circus artists and far from the biological family, Mel (Xuxa Meneghel) is a very sweet girl who does everything for the good and the children. But the cold Elizabeth, her sister who does not even know, is absolutely the opposite. Elizabeth (Xuxa Meneghel) inherited a graphic empire from her parents. Rich and evil, she knows her sister by accident. It all starts when the company she runs cuts off the sponsorship of the school where Mel works. On top of that, a precious gem falls into Mel's hands, creating a quarrel between her and the twin. There is still time for passions among so many confusions.

In Brazil, Xuxa had, in the history of the Brazilian cinema, with the successful commercial performance of Lua de Cristal (1989), a double success: musical and cinematographic. Internationally, after the success of his first Spanish- language album Xuxa 1 (1989), Xuxa was about to take another bold step: the launch of his TV Show, in the same vein as Xou da Xuxa, in Spanish. With so many good moments, it was time to also dare in the movies. Xuxa, was planning a vacation for her TV show in early 1991, during which time she was planning to release a film outside Brazil. With script that would tell the story of two Twin sisters. Diler Trindade's expectation was that the film would be seen by an audience similar to that of Lua de Cristal in Brazil and 8 million people in Mexico. The feature film would be signed by George Lucas, who would use a technology created by his company at the time, Industrial Light & Magic, to make the twins interact. In June 1991 she would be participating in the filming of the movie that would be titled \\"Twins,\\" a co-production of Xuxa Productions/Dreamvision and Columbia Pictures, budgeted at $ 1.2 million (about Cr $ million, by parallel exchange). In the cast, the Mexican singer Emmanuel and another Brazilian actor, who has not yet been chosen. Brazilian singer Fábio Júnior was invited but refused because he could not reconcile filming with the preparation of his album at the time. Another name considered was the Brazilian actor Maurício Mattar. However, because Xuxa is devoting himself to his television series El Show de Xuxa and Xuxa Park (in Argentina and Spain respectively), the project has been postponed. Development 2006 was a year of celebration in Xuxa's career. Completing 20 years on Globo TV, For this, the project to make a film with \\"two Xuxas\\" was resumed, but this time, without the international character. On May 4, 2006, Xuxa went to TV show Domingão do Faustão to relanse several projects: the DVD \\"Xuxa, o Show ao Vivo\\" and the project of the movie Gêmeas. The TV hosts reported that there would be a contest, designed by Jayme Praça, director of Domingão, and by the production of Xuxa, to choose a lookalike of the artist. The candidates needed to be between 18 and 35 years old and the winner would have the intention of assisting the filming, especially in the scenes in which the twin sisters counter. Subsequently, while the inscriptions were open, the contest was publicized daily by TV Xuxa and Xuxa's Sunday column in the newspaper EXTRA. The contest was held on August 27, 2006 and the winner was the tourist Isabele Fintelman. With a budget of R$5.2 million reais, Gêmeas came from a questioning of the director Jorge Fernando \\"What I would propose different Xuxa?, What she never did? A villain. How to reconcile Xuxa image with the a villain? The twins have appeared\\" he explains. Xuxa's advisory adds - Jorge is making the star represent and this is unheard of for her. Xuxa commented on the challenge of interpreting an antagonist: In order to play the character Elizabeth, Xuxa had to do a laboratory, to better compose the character, something she had never done for any of her previous films \\"I panicked. The first time I went to Elizabeth, I did not know how to act. Where to put your hand, how to speak. Making Mel, who is the good sister, was easy. I did not have to change anything. I lent my things to Mel and assumed things that were hers in a natural exchange. Already the costumes of Elizabeth ... Nothing, from there, was enough for me. I had to do the stump, wear fake nails, speak in a voice that was not mine. I suffered a lot.\\" The director says he was satisfied with the playfulness of the protagonist on the big screen, but she does not keep good memories of the work. \\"I, who did not even know how to play a right role, made two. It was difficult.\\" Patrícia Travassos, who co-wrote the film with Flávio de Souza, says that The Devil Wears Prada (2006) was a reference to creating Elizabeth. Patricia had not seen the film until that date, She had actually read the book and thought there were elements common among the Elizabeth character, as owner of the graphic empire El Dourado, and the character Miranda of The Devil Wears Prada. Xuxa commented that the intention of the film is to convey positive messages to the public \\"It is a comedy for all kinds of people, age and social class. A movie that speaks of love and tries to convey that money is not responsible for bringing happiness.\\" Another subject covered in the plot is the community of Morro Tavares Bastos, in Rio, where the project Stars of Tomorrow is developed - young people who use music to express their ideas. \\"The interesting thing is that the film shows the favela on its positive side, not the stereotype that society is accustomed to seeing on TV: the dirty and marginal boy, \\"adds the actor Thiago Martins, who plays Tigre. Murilo Rosa, lives the magician Ivan, love interest of Xuxa in the film: \\"She is incredible! We understood each other very well, I think the chemistry worked. It was 28 days of lots of fun and learning. I am very happy to be part of this film dedicated to children.\\" The production also includes comedians such as Leandro Hassum (Zé Mané), Marcius Melhem (Manézinho), Fabiana Karla (nurse practitioner) and Maria Clara Gueiros (Jennifer) - veteran actors Ary Fontoura, Emiliano Queiroz and the young actors Eike Duarte (Byte) and Maria Mariana Azevedo (Poodle). The singer Ivete Sangalo - who makes her debut in the movies - joins the cast as Alice, Mel's great friend. Filming Filming took place in September 2006. The first scenes of Xuxa were filmed on September 10, 2006, in the graphic park of the newspaper O Globo, which simulates the headquarters of the fictional newspaper \\"O Dourado\\". Another location was a favela in Rio de Janeiro called Tavares Bastos. All scenes involving the favela, from different moments of the film, were filmed throughout September 19, 2006. Due to the intense work, both Xuxa and Ivete Sangalo did not speak to the press on the day. Many favela residents crowded around to see the artists. Also scenes were filmed in the circus of Beto Carrero World and in the Museu do Primeiro Reinado (some locations of the museum were used to serve as mansion of the Dourado family). Music The soundtrack only contains two songs: Solidão, sung by Xuxa interpreting its two characters of the film, and Coisas Maravilhosas, sung by Ivete Sangalo at the end of the movie. The instrumental tracks were composed by Ary Sperling. Release Xuxa Gêmeas had two pre-releases. One in São Paulo, on December 9 at Shopping Jardim Sul; and another in Rio de Janeiro, on December 13, at the UCI cinema in Barra. The film debuted on December 15, 2006 in 300 theaters in Brazil. Home media Xuxa Gêmeas took almost a year to be released on DVD. Only from November 21, 2007, the DVD was put on sale for retail. For the rental companies the wait was a little lower, about 4 months before. The DVD brought as a gift an adult passport to the Xuxa World Park, which operated in São Paulo. Reception Critical response The screened audience of Filmow gave the film a rating of 1.6, based on more than 1,522 votes. The screened audience of Filmow gave the film a rating of 1.6, based on more than 1,522 votes. Adudiencia do Adorocinema, gave three stars of five, with a note of 3.1 points to the film. The IMDb audience general gave the film a rating of 1.5 points and a star. One critic of the Cineclick site gave the film a star and a half-five, criticizing the film's script for the film writing that it \\"brings nothing new. It is predictable, shameful most of the time and of course educational messages.\\" In addition, the production bets on singer Ivete Sangalo as actress. Which, believe me, is not the worst.\\" However he praised the performance of actress Maria Clara Gueiros, writing that \\"she is the funniest (or rather the only one who can make her laugh) character as Elizabeth's secretary, Jennifer.\\" He also praised Xuxa's performance by writing that \\"it is the production that most demands of Xuxa in the sense of interpretation, which does not fail to disappoint.\\" and praised TV Hots for abandoning the production of fanciful films, \\"There are no Viking goddesses or Duendes, which makes production more tolerable.\\" Destiny is in charge of all the magic in Xuxa Gêmeas and, among so many evils, it is necessary to see something positive in this production\\". Andy Malafaya writing for CINEMAPLAYERS, also criticized the film, writing that \\"Watching a Xuxa is already displeasing the big ones, imagine two!\\", He also criticized the way that the Favelas of Rio de Janeiro are portrayed in the film \\"Hunger, misery, traffickers? This does not exist in the fantasy world of Xuxa. After all, even Ivete Sangalo (oops, Alice) lives there. Does the blonde want Brazilian children to believe that the favela is the best place in the world to live? After all, they all live singing, dancing, stuffing themselves with honey- filled breads! Too bad that no company was smart enough to do merchandising, as is usual. It is sad to see the distortion of reality, more so from someone who should be educating.\\" The performances were also hard criticized by the critic writing \\"The performances are below the acceptable level - after all, what to expect from singers, models and comedians of the fifth category ?.\\" However, he praised the performance Xuxa, writing that she \\"plays the role of the good-hearted young lady - herself, obviously - and when the shrew enters the scene, the only word that comes to mind is embarrassment.\\" Giving the film a zero rating. Writing for Cinema com Rapadura, Amanda Pontes gave 3 to the film, not recommending it to her voters, writing \\"If you've ever watched any of the classic \\"Xuxa films\\" you will not be surprised by this new production, which follows all the molds of the previous ones. \\"Xuxa Gêmeas\\" comes with all the expected faults, which ends up classifying it as an authentic copy of the trash\\". Writing to the same site, Diego Benevides, he was also critical of Xuxa's new cinematographic production, writing that Gemeas sounds \\"pathetic, totally badly finished and disposable as ever. It might even bring some fun to the kids, we just have to wonder if they can be fooled with so little. Giving one note to the movie. Filmog, considered the film one of the worst of Xuxa, defining the direction of Jorge Fernando \\"crazy and fussy.\\" He wrote that the movie is \\"an old plot, with weak characters and even stupid.\\" She is double in that movie, one moment you see the sound and sweet Mel, in the other, the caricature and evil Elisabeth.\\" A reviewer at Cineweb wrote that \\"Xuxa Meneghel's fans who were disappointed that she appeared little in last year's animation, Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço (2005), can celebrate. In her new film, the former model returns in double dose.\\" and that Xuxa \\"tries to reward the absence in the previous long and to call again part of the public that left her. Like the twins of the soap opera Mulheres de Areia, Xuxa is a bad sister and another good one.\\" Marcelo Forlani writing Omelette, wrote that \\"that worse than a Xuxa, only: TWO XUXAS!. Noting one to the film.

It was first reported in 1997. It is a rare, aggressive large B-cell process that shows ALK expression. It is distinct from anaplastic large cell lymphoma, a T-cell lymphoma. Biology The median age of diagnosis is approximately late thirties to early forties. The estimates of childhood disease vary (8%, 15%, 30%) but it can be seen at any age. The disease usually arises in lymph nodes, particularly the neck, but extranodal involvement, including in the gastrointestinal tract, nasal cavity, ovary and brain, has been described. Morphologically, there are large immunoblast-like cells with large central nucleoli, often cellular clusters, with a predilection for the lymph node sinuses in a cohesive pattern that can suggest carcinoma cells. Upregulation of ALK is mainly due to chromosomal translocation t(2;17), resulting in a fusion gene of CLTC with ALK, but can rarely be due to t(2;5), fusing NPM1 with ALK; the later is the usual finding in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The t(2;17) translocation occurs in less than 1% of cases of ALK+ ALCL, but has been identified in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. There is no association with Epstein–Barr virus or HHV8, or immunosuppression. The cells are CD20 and CD30 negative, showing weak focal expression in 3% and 6% respectively. They are EMA and CD138 positive, showing 100% expression respectively. Treatment Multiagent chemotherapy is given, and can result in long term success, particularly in childhood but prognosis is generally poor, particularly in higher stage disease.

Kozakiewicz is the founder of the Alicia Project, an advocacy group designed to raise awareness about online predators, abduction, and child sexual exploitation. She is also the namesake of \\"Alicia's Law,\\" which provides a dedicated revenue source for child rescue efforts. Kozakiewicz has worked with the television network, Investigation Discovery (ID), to educate the public on, and effect change for, issues such as Internet safety, missing people, human trafficking, and child safety awareness education. At the age of 13, Kozakiewicz was the victim of an internet luring and child abduction that received widespread media attention. Her story and message have been chronicled on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning America, Dr. Phil, CNN, MSNBC, and the A&E; Biography Channel. She has been the subject of an award- winning PBS internet safety documentary, \\"Alicia's Message: I'm Here to Save Your Life,\\" as well as the Emmy award-winning \\"Alicia's Story\\" produced by Enough is Enough. Kozakiewicz has been featured in numerous national and international publications, such as People and Cosmopolitan. Kozakiewicz has addressed Congress on the issue of internet safety for children and Federal child rescue funding. Abduction Alicia Kozakiewicz, age 13, sitting in front of her family computer Kozakiewicz had corresponded online with someone she thought to be a boy of her own age—actually Scott Tyree a 38-year-old man who lived in Herndon, Virginia—who approached her in a Yahoo chat room. Over the course of nearly a year, Tyree groomed the 13-year-old Kozakiewicz. The Kozakiewicz family computer was located in the family room where internet activity could be monitored, but Tyree often contacted her at night while the rest of the family was asleep. On New Year's Day in 2002, Tyree lured Kozakiewicz into meeting him near her Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, address. He coerced her into his vehicle and then drove her back to his home in Virginia. Over the course of four days, she was held captive, shackled, raped, and tortured in Tyree's basement dungeon. Tyree filmed the abuse and broadcast it online, live via streaming video for others to witness. Rescue The missing person flier for Alicia Kozakiewicz from 2002. A viewer in Florida recognized Kozakiewicz from news stories and a missing persons flier from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. He contacted the FBI, anonymously and via a payphone because he feared being charged as an accessory to the crime. The FBI, using the Yahoo username they had learned from the anonymous tip, found Tyree's IP address and hence his street address, at a townhouse in Herndon. When FBI agents stormed the house on January 4, 2002, Kozakiewicz feared that they were men Tyree had sent to kill her. At 4:10 PM on January 4, 2002, agents freed Kozakiewicz. Tyree was arrested half an hour later at his workplace in Herndon. Kidnapper Alicia's kidnapper Scott William Tyree was born in 1963 to Erma Tyree. He graduated from Westmoor High School in 1981, married twice, had a 12-year-old daughter (who was staying with him during winter break and was sent back to her mother on the day Tyree kidnapped Alicia), and was divorced at the time of the kidnapping. His first wife, Sarah Tyree, said her husband was \\"a classic, long-haired computer guy\\" with an interest in science fiction and computer games. She said he had no prior brushes with the law.http://old.post- gazette.com/regionstate/20020105tyreep2.asphttps://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ASqGGa1AyzEJ:https://archive.triblive.com/news/classmates- recall-tyree-as-a-loner/+&cd;=1&ct;=clnk≷=ushttps://antipolygraph.org/cgi- bin/forums/YaBB.pl?num=1562489803 Aftermath After her rescue, Kozakiewicz was examined at a hospital and released to the custody of Fairfax County Child Protective Services. Her parents, Mary and Charles Kozakiewicz, were unable to take a commercial flight to reunite with their daughter due to the heightened media attention. They were privately flown to Virginia by the FBI on the following day. In the aftermath, Kozakiewicz has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and significant memory loss. Much of her life leading up to the abduction is difficult or impossible to recall. She has used counseling as a treatment method. As an adult she said that in 2002 people found it impossible to understand how this had happened and how she had been groomed; they mostly blamed the victim, although some people were supportive. In September 2003, Tyree was sentenced to 19 years and 7 months in federal prison. He was released in February 2019 from the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner.https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/scott-tyree-kidnapping- rape-victim-asks-to-testify-in-relocation-hearing-for- attacker/941433011/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/congress- questions-transfer-of-child-sex-criminal-to-victims- community/3877/https://casetext.com/case/tyree-v-united-states-5 and was assigned to a halfway house in Pittsburgh; protests against the location of his placement eventually involved members of Congress in an unsuccessful effort to pressure the Federal Bureau of Prisons to move him farther away from Kozakiewicz's family. The controversy became moot in October 2019, when Tyree was returned to prison for an additional two years for violating the terms of his parole. Tyree is currently incarcerated in the Federal Correctional Institution in Elkton, Ohio.https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ Advocacy Alicia Kozakiewicz standing before a wall of missing children at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children headquarters. One year after her abduction, at the age of 14, Kozakiewicz founded the Alicia Project. The Alicia Project is an advocacy group that raises awareness and provides education on topics such as internet safety for children, the prevalence of online child predators, and abductions. Kozakiewicz has shared her story at numerous schools and conferences, despite acknowledging that speaking about the incident can be triggering. In 2007, she testified before the House Judiciary Committee in an effort to raise awareness of the importance of internet laws to protect children. She successfully lobbied for the passage of the Protect Our Children Act of 2008 and has been lobbying alongside PROTECT for the passage of Alicia's Law in state legislatures. Alicia's Law provides a stream of state-specific funding to the Internet Crimes Against Children task forces (ICAC). In some cases, state and local agencies are able to pull finances accumulated from misdemeanor and felony convictions, while others employ mechanisms such as unclaimed lottery funding. This money is used for training, task forces, research, and rescue efforts for law enforcement agencies seeking child sexual exploitation victims. Alicia's Law has been passed in 11 states, including Virginia, Texas, California, Hawaii, and Idaho. Kozakiewicz will advocate for its passage in all 50 states. In 2018, it was reported that Alicia's Law has assisted in the arrest of over 1,000 online predators in Wisconsin alone. Additionally, Alicia's Law funding has enabled Wisconsin law enforcement to add a K-9 officer trained to locate hidden electronic devices. He was named \\"Kozak\\" in honor of Kozakiewicz.

After nearly 23 years of judicial work he resigned in January 1822, and was succeeded by William Erskine, Lord Kinneder. The death, under his own roof, of his kinsman, Sir Alexander Boswell, from the effects of a wound received by him in the duel with James Stuart of Dunearn, gave him a shock from which he never entirely recovered. He died at Balmuto on 22 July 1824, in his 83rd year. He was a robust and athletic man, with black hair and beetling eyebrows. His manner was boisterous and his temper passionate.

In 1783 he married Anne Irvine, who, by the death of her brother and grandfather, became the heiress of Kingcussie. They had two daughters and a son.

Previously, he organized Build, a design festival in Belfast, from 2009 until its final year in 2013.  Early career  McMillan attended university at Queen's University Belfast for Music Technology, hoping to make his way into a career in radio production. While managing the university radio station, he taught himself HTML and CSS, leaving before his final year to focus on freelance web design.  Build  McMillan launched Build in 2009, a web design conference held annually in Belfast, Northern Ireland from 2009 to 2013. Starting as a single day of talks, it grew into a week-long festival, including music, film screenings, workshops, evening lectures, and a beer festival. The first Build was held in 2009 at Waterfront Hall, with positive coverage from the BBC and Wired. The Belfast Telegraph said it was a \\"must- attend\\" that \\"provides nourishment for the design geek's soul.\\" In its five- year run, featured speakers included Eric A. Meyer, Erik Spiekermann, Frank Chimero, Dan Cederholm, Jessica Hische, Robin Sloan, Jason Scott, and Scott McCloud, as well as musical performances from Tycho and Chipzel. Rdio lead designer Wilson Miner's \\"When We Build\\" talk from 2011 was the most viewed talk, described by Wired as \\"incredibly inspiring.\\" The fifth and final Build took place in November 2013. In an interview with .net Magazine, McMillan said, \\"Build, like any good story, was always intended to have an ending.\\"  The Manual  In February 2011, McMillan launched a Kickstarter project for The Manual, a new design journal focusing on the \\"why\\" of web design instead of practical \\"how-to\\" articles. The project raised over $53,000 from 825 backers. Each issue is released as a hardcover book containing six essays from six authors, most from the field of web design, each with a two-color illustration. The first three issues of The Manual were published between August 2011 and June 2012. In September 2014, McMillan launched a project to fund the second volume of The Manual, expanding beyond print to include a free web edition, ebooks, and an audiobook narrated by Roman Mars from 99% Invisible. All past articles were released under a Creative Commons license. The project raised £43,220 from over 600 backers, again surpassing its goal. The fourth issue shipped in November 2014. In April 2016, McMillan announced that The Manual would be going on an \\"indefinite hiatus.\\"  XOXO  Andy McMillan and Andy Baio on stage at the end of XOXO 2013 In 2012, McMillan and co-organizer Andy Baio launched XOXO Festival, a four-day conference and festival about independently produced art and technology in Portland, Oregon, described as \\"people using the Internet and technology to bypass the established, big business ways of doing things and pursue their creative passions.\\" Tickets were presold through a Kickstarter project to \\"gauge the appeal of such an event and to raise the money needed to pull it off.\\" The project raised $175,000, selling all 400 tickets in 50 hours. Held annually since 2012, XOXO is held in September and has grown to over 1,000 attendees, using a lottery system to \\"retain its intimacy.\\" Recently, XOXO shifted focus on the difficulties of working independently.

The resulting social media backlash led to a public response and personal apology to McMillan from former PayPal president David A.

Before that she belonged to Rebelión, a group of young and independent socialists that included Navarro Ballesteros and Fernández Checa. They joined the PCE, as did the Party of the Revolutionary and Anti-Imperialist Left of César Falcón and Graco Marsal. Career After completing her academic training in 1933 Fuyola began teaching and also became an official in the auxiliary postal service. During these years she was involved in the Federation of Education Workers (FETE: Federación de Trabajadores de la Enseñanza). Her commitment to Communist ideals and her political abilities led to her being proposed by her comrades as candidate for Huesca and Zaragoza in the election of deputies to the Cortes in November 1933. She did poorly, but became known as a leading Communist in the region. She, Lucía Barón and Irene Falcón launched the publication ¡Compañera!, the organ of working women in the towns and country. In mid-1933 the World Committee Against War and Fascism sent a delegation to Spain to contact women interesting in forming a local branch. Fuyola joined the newly formed National Committee of Women Against War and Fascism, as did Dolores Ibárruri, Lucía Barón and Irene Falcón. They contacted Republican and Socialist women through the Socialist deputy and well-known writer María Lejárraga. In August 1934 the Spanish committee sent a delegation to the World Congress of Women against War and Fascism in Paris. Dolores Ibárruri led the group, which included two Republicans and two Communists, Encarnación Fuyola and Irene Falcón. The Spanish committee was dissolved in October 1934 during the repression that followed the Asturian miners' strike. Encarnación Fuyola, Dolores Ibárruri and others launched the Organization for Workers' Children, from which eventually emerged the Association of Antifascist Women (AMA: Asociación de Mujeres Antifascistas). Fuyola was active in creating this association, and became its secretary-general. She was a member of the board of Mujeres (Women), the official publication of the AMA whose first issue was published on 15 February 1936. She also headed the International Red Aid (Socorro Rojo). In 1936, just before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) she worked in the main postal administration in Madrid. She was arrested and imprisoned several times during this period for her opposition to the government. Civil War Encarnación Fuyola continued her political and propaganda activity after the outbreak of the civil war. She participated in the Madrid Front, and reached the rank of Major. In August 1936 she was appointed spokeswoman for the Child Protection Board in Madrid. In 1937 she published Anti-fascist Women, Work and Organization. She continued to lead the Socorro Rojo, and participated personally and at great risk towards the end of the war in releasing several communists from the concentration camps of Alicante. Later years When the civil war ended Fuyola found work as a maid in Pamplona, then made her way to France. She stayed in Le Mans, then traveled to Paris where the Communist Party of France helped her leave for Mexico on the ship Le Havre. She was prevented from disembarking in Cuba because of her Communist affiliation, and reached Veracruz in November 1939. She spent four years in Zamora, Michoacán, Mexico. In 1942 she moved to Mexico City where she was welcomed by Communist comrades. In 1942 the Francoist authorities proscribed Fuyola, whom they said was more dangerous and important in the Communist Party than the Pasionaria. In October 1942 her first husband, Luis Sendín, was shot in Madrid. In Mexico City Fuyola started a new life with a new partner. Her son was born in Mexico. Her home was open to compatriots such as Pedro Checa (1910–1942), Wenceslao Roces (1897–1992) and Antonio Izcaray. She worked as a proofreader and translator of French texts. She maintained her old connections and interests, and wrote for Communist publications such as Mundo Obrero and España. She was active in the Union of Spanish Women, and between 1948 and 1950 was secretary and president. She died in Mexico City on 8 December 1982.

The B 832 is very similar to its predecessor, the Karosa B 732 city bus, and also unified with city bus model B 841 and with intercity bus C 834. The body is semi-self-supporting with frame and engine with manual gearbox in the rear part. The engine drives only the rear axle. The front axle is independent, rear axle is solid. All axles are mounted on Air suspension. On the right side are three doors (first are narrower than middle doors). Inside are used leatherette seats, plastic Vogelsitze or Fainsa seats. The driver's cab is separated from the rest of the vehicle by a glazed partition. In the middle, or in the rear part is room for a pram or wheelchair.  Production and operation  Because in the states of former Soviet Union were problems with the connivance of the new Karosa 900 series, Karosa decided to continue for these countries with production of modified buses 700 series under new designation – 800 series (it was in the 80s once used). 800 series buses were manufactured since 1997, when was completed production of the 700 series, until 1999, when it was finally replaced by buses of 900th series. B 832 buses produced a total of 102 pieces. B 832 were intended primarily for export to the countries of the former Soviet Union. A few pieces ended in Czech Republic and Slovakia due to insolvency of buyers.

The main summit is high, the West Top 2,143 m high and the East Top 2,060 m. The summit group is located southwest of the Ammer Saddle. The West Top can be climbed either from the Plansee lake or from a small car park on the road linking the Plansee via the Ammer Saddle to Schloss Linderhof (ca. 2 km south of Hotel Ammerwald on the bridge over the Teufelsbach) in about 3½ hours. This is an easy mountain tour; only at a few places just below the summit is there a requirement to use hands as well as feet. The crossing from West Top to the main summit is rather more challenging and requires sure- footedness and a head for heights. The arête walk from the main summit to the East Top requires sure-footed negotiation of schrofen terrain and, at one spot, climbing to grade II standard and is only recommended for experienced mountaineers. The West Top can also be ascended from the Ammer Saddle as an interesting ski tour. Because of the dense belt of mountain pine, however, a high level of snow is needed. The descent from the gully at the exit to the cirque on the north side is sometimes rather tricky. If there is little snow (when it is very steep) or the snow is hard, ice picks and crampons are recommended.

He is most known for his association with the Salzburger emigrants, a group of German-speaking Protestant refugees who migrated to the British colony of Georgia in 1734. They founded the city of Ebenezer, Georgia to escape persecution in the Archbishopric of Salzburg and other Roman Catholic authorities for their religious views. Background Boltzius was born at Forst in Lower Lusatia, a town southeast of Berlin, Germany. His parents, Eva Rosina Muller and Martin Boltzius worked as weavers. He was awarded a scholarship for theology from the University of Halle. During his time at the university, he studied Lutheran Pietism, which emphasized salvation by grace, strong ethics, vigorous pastoral leadership, and social compassion. Upon completing his studies, he served as the inspector at the Latin School of the Francke in Halle providing Protestant education to orphans. Ebenezer settlement Statue in Ebenezer, Georgia, U.S. In 1733, he was chosen by Gotthilf August Francke, son of a co-founder of the school, to serve as a minister to the Salzburg Protestant refugees.Ebel, Carol. \\"Johann Martin Boltzius (1703-1765).\\" New Georgia Encyclopedia. 15 September 2014. Web. 18 February 2015 Boltzius called their journey \\"into danger, but closer to God\\", which sheds light on the harsh conditions that travelers often faced during the eighteenth century. This religiously motivated journey was seen as a chance for the Salzburgers to come closer to God by taking on these hardships in order to follow Christ and therefore, this movement was seen as a pilgrimage more than as emigration. Boltzius envisioned this new community as one where God was the ultimate authority. Although he was chosen and seen as a leader for the Salzburgers, he stressed that the ministers were governed by God and that they would make all of the administrative and disciplinary decisions in His name.Herz, Dietmar & Smith, John D.. \\"'Into Danger but also Closer to God': The Salzburgers' Voyage to Georgia, 1733-1734.\\" The Georgia Historical Quarterly. 80.1 (1996): 1-26. Web. In 1734, the group of Salzburgers who sailed from England to Georgia, arriving first in Charleston, South Carolina before proceeding to Savannah, Georgia. James Oglethorpe, the founder of the Georgia colony, met them upon arrival and assigned them the piece of land that would become Ebenezer. Many of the Salzburgers died due to complications from infectious diseases during the journey, and once they arrived in Georgia. Boltzius insisted that these deaths were due to God's works and that the intervention was only a test of their faith. From his entries in the Detailed Reports of the Salzburger Emigrants Who Settled in America (Ausführliche Nachricht von den saltzburgischen Emigranten compiled by Samuel Urlsperger), there are some signals that Boltzius began to blame James Oglethorpe, as representative of the Trustees of Georgia, for the many deaths because of his poor choice of location for the settlement. In 1736, Ebenezer was moved closer to the Savannah River. Boltzius had demanded that the community be relocated to an area with more fertile land, where the Salzburgers could thrive. After an altercation with Oglethorpe, Boltzius threatened to disband the community if they did not receive permission to relocate. In 1737, Boltzius had several conversations with John Wesley over the issue of episcopacy. Boltzius said, \\"Of this [doctrine] he [Wesley] feels so sure that no argument could be strong enough to sway him in the slightest from his opinion\\". This led to Wesley's declining to serve Boltzius Holy Communion. Boltzius established the Jerusalem Lutheran Church and administered the settlement of Ebenezer with a strong religious element. Boltzius also wanted to share his faith with other communities in Georgia. He rejected the Moravians who came into Georgia, but he was able to form relationships with Anglican and Jewish leaders in the community. He was very outspoken when it came to his views about how political issues were affecting the colonies, and this led to his disassociation with many of the other groups in his area. He was strongly opposed to slavery because he thought that it went against Christian values, but for fear of being killed for his beliefs, in 1740 he determined that he needed to become accepting of slavery for the safety of the Salzburgers. He stated that slavery was a new way to spread Christian faith and later purchased his own slaves. In 1741, Boltzius founded what is now the Lutheran Church of the Ascension in Savannah. Towards the end of his life, Boltzius became sick with malaria and began to lose his eyesight, possibly due to a keratitis. When he died in 1765, the Salzburgers felt his absence, for they had lost their leader and their guide.Urlsperger, Samuel and George F.

Life Urlsperger was born in the Swabian town of Kirchheim unter Teck in Württemberg. He came from a former prestigious and wealthy Hungarian family that, during the Thirty Years' War, was forced to emigrate like many other Protestants in Hungary and Styria due to religious persecution by the Habsburg authorities. He attended the local town school and the gymnasium of Blaubeuren Abbey. Funded by the Dowager Duchess Magdalena Sibylla of Hesse-Darmstadt, Urlsperger completed his theological studies in Tübingen until 1707. He went on to study at the knight academy in Erlangen, at the University of Jena, and with August Hermann Francke (1663–1727) in Halle. A study trip led him to places like Leiden, Utrecht and to the Savoy Chapel in London, where he worked with Anton Wilhelm Böhme (1673–1722). Here he contacted the Anglican \\"Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge\\", whose aspirations resembled the \\"Halle Pietism\\" of Philipp Jacob Spener (1635–1705). Back in Germany, he established the \\"English house for students from England\\" on the premises of the Francke Foundations in Halle. Shortly afterwards, Urlsperger became a preacher in Stetten im Remstal. He was appointed chaplain at the Württemberg court in Stuttgart in 1714 and became a ducal court preacher in 1715. However, from time to time he stayed in prison for openly criticizing the lifestyle of Duke Eberhard Louis of Württemberg, who had rejected his consort Johanna Elisabeth of Baden-Durlach in favour of his mistress Wilhelmine von Grävenitz. In 1720 Urlsperger again became a pastor and superintendent in Herrenberg; three years later he became a pastor of the Main Church of St. Anne in the Imperial City of Augsburg, where he would later be granted the title of Senior of the Evangelical Ministry. Urlsperger also served as a local agent and as a diplomat fully authorized to represent his government. Salzburg emigrants While in Augsburg, Urlsperger from 1735 to 1752 edited the 18 Continuations of the \\"Detailed Reports on the Salzburger emigrants who settled in America\\" which contain the diaries and letters of two pastors, Johann Martin Boltzius and Israel Christian Gronau. These men accompanied and helped Urlsperger to transfer Salzburg Protestants, exiled from their lands by Prince-archbishop Leopold Anton von Firmian, and settle them at Ebenezer near Savannah, Georgia. He edited and published portions of his correspondence with the emigrants' pastors, passages from the pastors' travel diaries, and reports from the Royal British Commissioner, Baron Georg Philipp Friedrich von Reck, a Hanoverian nobleman, who accompanied the emigrants. In 1733, Urlsperger and the English Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge invited a group of Salzburgers to travel to the Colony of Georgia; they accepted the invitation and were then transported under various terms, such as: they would receive free passage from Rotterdam (where they would meet with Boltzius and Gronau) to Georgia; the head of every family would be given fifty acres of land in Georgia; and the Salzburgers would be guaranteed religious liberty and the rights of English citizens. At Rotterdam, Urslperger and the Salzburgers were joined by Boltzius and Gronau. Altogether they traveled to England, where they took the oath of allegiance to the British Government on January 8, 1734 in order to set sail for Georgia on the ship \\"Purisburg\\" under Captain Coram. A great quantity of archives that document the Salzburgers' emigration to America are available. Nevertheless, they do not seem to answer basic questions that still remain regarding their justification for their trans- Atlantic journey. The reasons for the Salzburgers to emigrate to Georgia are unclear, however, Urlsperger believed that convincing the Salzburgers of emigrating to Georgia was of the uttermost importance despite having the opportunity of following the call of the Prussian king to settle in his East Prussian or Lithuanian territories. A text that was published by an anonymous author in 1733 in Frankfurt demonstrated a balance sheet of the advantages and disadvantages of a respective emigration to Prussia or America. Although he tried to refute the arguments favoring Prussia, Urlsperger ultimately admitted that travelling to Georgia would be more dangerous and much less certain of success than the simple journey to the Prussian lands. Urlsperger concluded his apology, however, by emphasizing that religion was the main reason of their emigration to America. \\"If the emigrants were to desert the cross and seek only a good life, they would not be faithful pilgrims,\\" said Urlsperger. Urlsperger died highly honored in Augsburg at the age of 86.  Further reading  *Werner Raupp: Art.: Urlsperger, Gelehrtenfamilie.

Biography  Von Reck was born into nobility and held a land charter for 500 acres in America under certain contingencies of qualification.

However, the drawings and watercolor sketches were made public only in 1977 after they were discovered at the Royal Library in Copenhagen.

They released their debut EP, Count the Seconds Before Your Last Breath, through Slake-less Heart Records. They also released their debut album, On Your Glory We Build Our Empire, in August 2009. Due to their rapid success and a steadily growing fan base, prompted in part because of concerts with bands like Asking Alexandria, Underoath, Motionless in White, Blessthefall, Pierce the Veil, More Than A Thousand, Adam Kills Eve, Dance Gavin Dance, and In Fear and Faith, the American management company The Artery Foundation (including Chelsea Grin, Whitechapel, Woe, Is Me, Impending Doom, Breathe Carolina) became aware of the band and signed a management contract with them. The group toured several times in Italy between March 7, 2009 to 30 May 2009 and between 29 January 2011 to 28 May 2011. The band has also played concerts with: The Electric Diorama, Romantic Emily, Hope, The Burden, One Morning Left, From Dying Skies, Ms. White, Shadows Chasing Ghosts and While She Sleeps. With Adam Kills Eve, the group played their first concert outside Italy in the Swiss town of Bellinzona. In 2010, Matteo Bertizzolo and Nicola Giachellich left Upon This Dawning, and were replaced by Giani Molinari and Carlo Todeschini. Meanwhile, toured the group in Munich, Germany with His Statue Falls. Their second album, To Keep Us Safe, was released on October 23, 2012 through Fearless Records. The album included Chris Motionless, and a cover of the song \\"Call Me Maybe\\", originally recorded by Carly Rae Jepsen, which also appears on the fifth installment of the Fearless Punk Goes Pop series. The group toured more often after signing with Fearless Records. The band was the opening act for For the Fallen Dreams, Alesana, The Color Morale, and Chunk! No, Captain Chunk!. In June 2013, Unclean vocalist, Giani Molinari left Upon This Dawning, along with Luca Orio, Carlo Todeschini, and Andrea Moserle. Giani was replaced by Dani Nelli, and Luca was replaced by Gabriele Magrini, who was then replaced by Chris Deets in 2014. Deets quit the band abruptly in April 2015, due to a dispute between him and other members, causing the band to miss the first three dates in The IX Lives Tour with Ice Nine Kills. Between 22 November 2013 and 11 December 2013, the group toured together with Shoot the Girl First as the opening act for The Browning throughout Europe. They toured throughout the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Austria and Hungary. On February 11, 2014, Upon This Dawning stated that they had left Fearless Records and instead, signed to Artery Recordings. The band announced their third studio album, We Are All Sinners, which was released on April 29, 2014. We Are All Sinners had more influences of doom metal, death metal, and black metal, featuring tremolo picking, harmonic key writing, and themes of sin and hell.

Javier Gutiérrez, written by David Loucka, Jacob Aaron Estes and Akiva Goldsman and starring Matilda Lutz, Alex Roe, Johnny Galecki, Aimee Teegarden, Bonnie Morgan and Vincent D'Onofrio. It is the third installment in The Ring series, following the previous installments The Ring (2002) and The Ring Two (2005), and is based on elements of Spiral by Kôji Suzuki. Paramount Pictures had initially planned a third film, originally titled The Ring 3D, in early 2014, with Gutiérrez signed to direct the film from a screenplay written by Goldsman, Loucka, and Aaron Estes. Principal photography began on March 23, 2015, in Atlanta, and wrapped on May 31, 2015. Reshoots took place in July 2016. Rings was released in the United States on February 3, 2017, and opened #2 in the box office. It has grossed $83million worldwide against its $25million budget.  Plot  In 2013, on an airplane bound for Seattle, a man reveals that he has watched Samara Morgan's cursed videotape. Another passenger reveals she has seen the tape too and asks the man if he made a copy; he replies that he did not. Moments later, Samara causes the airplane to crash. Two years later in 2015, college professor Gabriel Brown buys a VCR, discovering the videotape inside. Elsewhere, student Julia sees her boyfriend Holt off to college but grows concerned when he ghosts her. Soon a panicked girl contacts her: she too is concerned about Holt. When Julia goes looking for her boyfriend, she meets Gabriel and finds a group of people known as the Sevens, who are involved in an experiment involving the cursed video. The group films themselves watching the video before passing the footage to another person called a \\"tail.\\" Julia recognizes group member Skye as the panicked girl on the phone. She goes with Skye to her apartment to unknowingly watch the video. When Skye tries to force her to watch the video, Julia locks herself in the bathroom. Samara kills Skye in the apartment. Julia tries to rush out of the apartment and when finally opening the door, she finds Holt on the other side. Holt reveals that he has watched the tape as well and has 12 hours left. Julia watches his copy and when she picks up the phone, she experiences a vision of a door. The phone burns a mark into her hand. Julia's version of the video cannot be copied and contains additional images of a mysterious woman. She realizes they must cremate Samara's physical remains. Gabriel sends them to Sacramento Valley, where Samara was given a proper burial (the residents of Moesko Island refused to accept the remains). He realizes the mark on Julia's hand is Braille, translates it, and goes to warn them. Julia and Holt find an unmarked tomb, but when they break in, they find it empty. They are caught and taken to a blind man named Galen Burke, who claims Samara's body was entombed by the local priest but a flood came, leading the priest to rebury her in a potter's field outside town. On the way to the field Julia and Holt come upon a car crash and learn that Gabriel was involved. He tries to warn Julia about the Braille message, but he is killed by a falling utility pole. After experiencing a vision of Samara's mother Evelyn, Julia and Holt return to town. Julia goes to the church and discovers a hidden chamber beneath the bell tower. She finds evidence that Evelyn was imprisoned there while pregnant: held in captivity by the priest after being raped. She escaped eight months into the pregnancy. Julia visits Burke and explains her findings. He attacks her, revealing he is the priest as well as Samara's biological father. He blinded himself to escape the reach of her powers. Julia pushes him down the stairs, temporarily incapacitating him. Holt rushes to Burke's house, where he is knocked unconscious. Julia discovers Samara's skeleton behind a wall, and Burke tries to strangle her to prevent her from cremating Samara's remains. He claims the cremation would unleash an unspeakable evil upon the world, and that he has killed several people who previously attempted to do the same. Suddenly, a swarm of cicadas fly in, summoning Samara through Julia's phone. Samara cures Burke's blindness and kills him. Holt recovers and rushes to Julia's aid. That night, he and Julia cremate Samara's corpse, in an attempt to appease her spirit once and for all, and return home. While Julia is in the shower, Holt notices a voicemail from Gabriel, who warns him of the Braille, which Holt begins to translate. In the bathroom, Julia peels away the skin where the mark was, revealing grey skin underneath. She begins to cough up black hair, from which a cicada is born. Meanwhile, Julia's copy of the cursed video is sent to everyone on her contact list, eventually going viral, despite Holt's futile attempts to disconnect the computer. As his computer glitches, the Braille translation is revealed to be \\"rebirth.\\" Samara is reborn in Julia, who sees Samara's face in her mirror instead of her own.

Javier Gutiérrez directing. In August 2014, Paramount was in talks with Akiva Goldsman to write a third draft of the screenplay, which had previously been worked on by David Loucka and Jacob Aaron Estes. In November, Gutiérrez posted an Instagram photo that showed that the title of the sequel had been changed to Rings. Casting On January 16, 2015, Matilda Lutz was cast in the lead role. Alex Roe was cast as the male lead on March 20, 2015. Aimee Teegarden joined the cast on March 27, 2015, and Johnny Galecki signed on to star in the film on April 1, 2015, playing Gabriel, a professor who mentors and helps both Holt and Julia.  Filming  Principal photography on the film began on March 23, 2015, in Atlanta, and wrapped on May 31, 2015. Reshoots took place in July 2016.  Post-production  Post- production began in June 2015 at Paramount Studios and was concluded in November 2016.  Release  Paramount Pictures originally set the film for a November 13, 2015, release, but in September 2015, the film was pulled from the schedule, and in October 2015, Paramount rescheduled the release date to April 1, 2016. On February 17, 2016, the film was rescheduled for release on October 28, 2016, to take the place of Paramount's previous October horror release staple, the Paranormal Activity series, which ended in 2015 with Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension. On September 22, 2016, the film was delayed to February 3, 2017, most likely to avoid competition with Ouija: Origin of Evil, leaving the latter as the only horror film that debuted around Halloween 2016. Marketing The film's first trailer was released on August 24, 2016. The second trailer was released on January 5, 2017, alongside a new international trailer, containing new footage. In January 2017, Paramount released a prank video where an actress dressed as Samara jumped out of a television to scare unwitting patrons at an electronics store. The video garnered 200million views in 24 hours on Facebook. Home media Rings was released on digital HD on April 21 and on Blu-ray and DVD on May 2, 2017. The digital HD and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes interviews with the cast & crew, deleted/extended scenes, and an alternate ending.  Reception  Box office Rings grossed $27.8million in the United States and Canada and $55.3million in other territories for a worldwide total of $83.1million, against a production budget of $25million. In North America, the film was released alongside The Space Between Us and The Comedian, and was projected to gross $12–14million from about 3,000 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $800,000 from its Thursday night previews. It went on to open to $13million, finishing second at the box office behind fellow horror film Split. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 8% based on 112 reviews and an average rating of 3.19/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Rings may offer ardent fans of the franchise a few threadbare thrills, but for everyone else, it may feel like an endless loop of muddled mythology and rehashed plot points.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 25 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C–\\" on an A+ to F scale, lower than the B– and C+ earned by its respective predecessors. Alex Gilyadov of IGN gave the film a score 4.5/10, stating that it \\"opts for lazy jump scares and a convoluted origins story no one asked for or needed\\", though not dismissing that it has \\"some chilling scenes and creepy visuals\\". Hernan Khatchadourian of Diario Popular described the movie as \\"more entertaining than the long movie by Verbinsky,\\" praising the cinematography, direction, and acting. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the movie zero stars and called it a \\"botch job\\" that suffers from \\"demo-worthy awfulness in directing, writing and acting\\". Peter Sobczynski of RogerEbert.com gave a single star, calling it \\"More wearying than frightening\\". A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club commented that the film was a pale imitation of the 2002 American remake in terms of visuals and plot structure. He also dismissed the film's characters as \\"bland nothings\\", citing their lack of development in the story. John Squires from Bloody Disgusting “dug Rings quite a bit”, suggesting that “the movie itself is actually way better than its clearly-intended-for-teen- audiences marketing”, and the reveal of the final scene in the trailer was “completely robbed of suspense by the marketing department.” Other international critics applauded the film. Mike McCahill of The Guardian commented that the film \\"smoothly reinvents the wheel\\", pointing out that \\"the admirably loopy finale, involving blind Vincent d'Onofrio's swarming army of cicadas, is worthy of one of the better Exorcist sequels\\". Javier Jimenez Montoya of Vavel also praised the film, stating that \\"it's a step forward in the horror genre\\" and applauding \\"its strong, surprising ending\\". The final numbers in the global box office pushed Paramount to consider making another film in The Ring Franchise.https://geekvibesnation.com/paramount-looking-to- reboot-the-ring-horror-franchise/ Future Speaking at CinemaCon, Paramount Vice Chairman Rob Moore said that should the film prove successful, more sequels could recur annually, taking the place of Paramount's Paranormal Activity series. These plans were left in doubt following Moore's departure from the company. In a post-release interview, Moore's successor, Megan Colligan, said that \\"time will tell\\" if another sequel is in the cards. Following Colligan's departure, there has been no update on a sequel. In September 2019, The Grudge director Nicolas Pesce expressed interest in a crossover film between The Grudge and the American The Ring film series.https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3584775/nicolas-pesce-confirms-new- grudge-canonical-2004-version-exclusive/  References   External links   Category:2017 films Category:2017 horror films Category:2010s ghost films Category:2010s psychological horror films Category:Alternative sequel films Category:American films Category:American ghost films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American sequel films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Asian-American horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films about spirit possession Category:Films scored by Matthew Margeson Category:Films set in 2013 Category:Films set in 2015 Category:Films set on airplanes Category:Films shot in Atlanta Category:Horror films featuring female antagonists Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Patricide in fiction Category:Rape and revenge films Category:Ringu cycle Category:Films with screenplays by Akiva Goldsman ","title":"Rings (2017 film)"},{"id":"46180951","text":"Anna Jaquez (born 1953) is an American artist, art professor and metalsmith.

A guide shows a suffocated dog to a man and woman tourist. Lake Agnano and the Cave of Dogs in their heyday. Etching by the Sieur de Rogissart, 1706. The Cave of Dogs (in Italian Grotta del Cane, literally \\"Cave of the Dog\\") is a small cave on the eastern side of the Phlegraean Fields near Pozzuoli, Naples. Inside the cave is a fumarole that releases carbon dioxide of volcanic origin. It was a famous, if gruesome, tourist attraction for travellers on the Grand Tour. The carbon dioxide gas, being denser than air, tends to accumulate in the deeper parts of the cave. Local guides, for a fee, would suspend small animals (usually dogs) inside it until they became unconscious. Because humans inhaled air from a higher level they were not affected. The dogs might be revived by submerging them in the cold waters of the nearby Lake Agnano. Tourists who came to see this attraction included Goethe, John Evelyn, Alexandre Dumas père, and Mark Twain. The lake became polluted and it was drained in 1870; the spectacle fell into disuse and the cave was closed. However the area is now being restored by volunteers.Taylor, Alfred Swaine, An Account of the Grotta del Cane; With Remarks Upon Suffocation by Carbonic Acid, The London Medical and Physical Journal, 1832, 278-285.Fleming & Johnson, Toxic Airs: Body, Place, Planet in Historical Perspective, Pittsburgh, 255-256.Kroonenberg, Why Hell Stinks of Sulfur: Mythology and Geology of the Underworld, Chicago, 2013, 41-45.Jeff Matthews, Naples: Life, Death & Miracles: Agnano & the Grotto of the Dog. , visited 26.3.2015. \\"The area degraded terribly after WWII and became an eyesore from shoddy overbuilding and illegal waste dumping.

Vibrational bonds only exist for a few milliseconds. This bond is detectable through modern analytic chemistry and is significant because it affects the rate at which other reactions can occur. History Vibrational bonds were mathematically predicted almost thirty years before they were experimentally observed. The original theoretical calculations had been carried out by D.C. Clary and J.N.L Connor during the early 1980s. Together they hypothesized that with very large atoms and small atoms at high energy states, the elements would stabilize and create temporary bonds for very short periods of time. The vibrational bond would be weaker than any currently known bond, like the commonly known ionic or covalent bonds.D.C. Clary and J.N.L. Connor, 'Isotope and Potential energy surface effects in Vibrational Bonding.' Journal of Physical Chemistry. 1984 One year after the theoretical discovery of vibrational bonds, J. Manz and his team confirmed the calculations that were previously made, and elaborated on them by showing that the vibrational bonds were most likely to occur during symmetric reactions, but stated that vibrational bonds may also be possible with asymmetric reactions.J. Manz, E. Pollak, J. Romelt 'A classical analysis of quantum resonances in isotopic collinear H + H2 Reactions' Chemical Physics letters, 1982. Their team explained that although vibrational bonding theories proved to be correct they found some inconsistencies with the 'classic model' and found that symmetric reactions will show resonance, but only in certain transition states. However, the classic model would still be viable to use to predict vibrational bonds. In 1989, Donald Fleming noticed that a reaction between bromine and muonium slowed down as temperature increased. This phenomenon was known as a \\"vibrational bond\\" and would capture the attention of Donald Fleming again in 2014. In 1989 the technology did not exist to collect sufficient data on the reaction, and Donald Fleming and his team moved away from the research.Donald G. Fleming, Jorn Manz, Kazuma Sato, and Toshiyuki Takayanagi 'Fundamental Change in the Nature of Chemical Bonding by Isotopic Substitution' Angewandte communications 2014 Discovery Donald Fleming and his team recently began their investigation of vibrational bonds, and as they had expected from the results of their experiments in 1989, the BrLBr reaction slowed at high temperatures, now using modern instrumental analysis from photo detachment electron spectroscopy, the vibrational bond was detected but lasted only a few milliseconds.Tibi Puiu 'A new type of chemical bond has been confirmed- the vibrational bond' ZMEscience.com 2015 The vibrational bond acted differently than van der Waals forces reactions because the energy was balanced differently. Bond In chemistry it is known that increased temperature increases the rate or reaction of an experiment, however vibrational bonds are not formed like covalent bonds where electrons are shared between the two bonding atoms. Vibrational bonds are created at high energy where the muonium bounces to and from bromine atoms \\"like a ping pong ball bouncing between two bowling balls,\\" according to Donald Fleming.Amy Nordrum 'Chemists confirm the Existence of New Type of Bond' Scientific American. Jan 20, 2015 This bouncing action lowers the potential energy of the BrMuBr molecule, and therefore slows the rate of the reaction. This type of bond has been confirmed in the BrMuBr molecules but in the heavier isotopes of hydrogen (protium, deuterium, and tritium), the vibrational bonding can only occur as the van der Waals forces are overcome and the vibrational bond is formed. Relevance This discovery changes the understanding of chemical bonds, with van der Waals interactions, and recently discovered vibrational bonding will show that there are different mechanisms and energies for different bonds, and the experimental discovery of the vibrational bonding has the potential to encourage more research in isotopic interactions.

The most common side effects are reactions at the application site (including burning or stinging). Crisaborole is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4) inhibitor, although its specific mechanism of action in atopic dermatitis is not known. Side effects At the site of application, crisaborole may cause burning or stinging. Rarely, there may be an allergic reaction. Medical uses In the US, crisaborole is indicated for topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in people three months of age and older. In the EU, crisaborole is indicated for treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in people two years of age and older with ≤ 40% body surface area (BSA) affected. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Crisaborole is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, mainly acting on phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), which causes inflammation. Chemically, crisaborole is a phenoxybenzoxaborole. Inhibition of PDE4B appears to suppress the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-23 and other cytokines, proteins believed to be involved in the immune response and inflammation. People with atopic dermatitis produce high levels of proteins called cytokines, which can cause the inflammation of the skin seen in dermatitis. Crisaborole blocks the release of certain cytokines involved in the inflammation process such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukins (IL‑2, IL-4, IL-5), and interferon gamma. By blocking their release, crisaborole is expected to ease the inflammation and therefore relieve symptoms of the disease. Chemistry Crisaborole (chemical name: 4-[(1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydro-2,1-benzoxaborol-5-yl)oxy]benzonitrile) is a member of the class of benzoxaboroles characterized by the presence of a boronic acid hemiester with a phenolic ether and a nitrile. Crisaborole crystallizes into two polymorphs that differ in the conformation of the oxaborole ring. A cocrystal with 4,4'-bipyridine has been prepared and studied by X-ray crystallography. History Crisaborole was developed by Anacor Pharmaceuticals for the topical treatment of psoriasis. During preclinical and clinical development, crisaborole was called AN2728 and PF-06930164. The drug was assumed to be potential $2bn-a-year blockbuster, when Pfizer acquired Anacor Pharmaceuticals. However, the drug was commercially not successful, reaching only in sales in 2018, and in sales in 2019. Crisaborole was approved for use in the United States in December 2016 and for use in Canada in June 2018. The safety and efficacy of crisaborole were established in two placebo- controlled trials with a total of 1,522 participants ranging in age from two years of age to 79 years of age, with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. In both trials participants received treatment with either crisaborole or placebo twice daily for 28 days. Neither the participants nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trials were completed. Overall, participants receiving crisaborole achieved greater response with clear or almost clear skin after 28 days of treatment. The trials were conducted in the US. Crisaborole was approved for use in the European Union in March 2020, for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Text was copied from this source which is © European Medicines Agency.

James Stuart of Dunearn WS (1775 – 3 November 1849) was a Scottish politician. He was the target of several personal attacks by opponents and participated in a duel that fatally wounded Sir Alexander Boswell. Biography James was born in 1775 the eldest son of Charles Stuart of Dunearn in Fife, who was for some years minister of the parish of Cramond, and afterwards (1795–1828) a physician in Edinburgh. Charles' father, James' grandfather, was James Stuart of Binend, Lord Provost of Edinburgh.http://www.clanmacfarlanegenealogy.info/genealogy/TNGWebsite/getperson.php?personID=I50293&tree;=CC His mother was Mary Erskine, daughter of Rev John Erskine minister of Greyfriars Kirk. James attended, it is believed, the high school of Edinburgh from 1785 to 1789. Having studied Law at the university of Edinburgh and served an apprenticeship to Mr. Hugh Robertson, W.S. in offices on the east side of George SquareEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1795, James was admitted a member of the Society of Writers to the Signet on 17 August 1798. In 1800 he is listed as having premises at 16 Nicholson Street in Edinburgh's South Side.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1800 He held the office of collector of the widows' fund of the society from 1818 to 1828, but \\"was more attached to agricultural pursuits than to those of his profession\\". As a deputy-lieutenant and justice of the peace he took an active part in county business, but his whig enthusiasm offended the authorities. In December 1815, when a new commission of the peace was issued for Fifeshire, the Earl of Morton, then lord lieutenant, omitted Stuart. On 4 January 1816, however, a meeting of the gentlemen of the western district of the county resolved \\"to take steps for securing the continuance of Mr. Stuart's most important and unremitting services to this district,\\" and he was reappointed. Some years later he had another difficulty with Lord Morton, who censured him for having, contrary to a regimental order, assembled for drill a troop of the Fifeshire yeomanry, in which he was an officer. Stuart, who maintained that he had never seen the order, resigned his commission on 7 January 1821. Controversy Stuart was a keen politician on the whig side. On 28 July 1821 the Beacon, an Edinburgh tory paper, the first number of which had appeared on 6 January 1821, contained a personal attack on him. He demanded an apology from the printer, Duncan Stevenson. This was refused, and on 15 August Stuart, meeting Stevenson in the Parliament Close, assaulted him. Lord Cockburn simply says 'he caned the printer in the street,' but Stevenson and his friends said there was a fight, and that Stuart behaved like a coward. The personal attacks were continued in the Beacon, and Stuart entered on a long correspondence with Sir William Rae, then lord-advocate of Scotland, who in the end expressed his disapproval of the Beacons system of personal attacks, and allowed Stuart to publish the correspondence. Soon after this the Beacon ceased to appear. In the following year (1822) Stuart was involved in another and more serious quarrel with the tory press. The first number of a new paper in Glasgow, The Glasgow Sentinel, appearing on 10 October 1821, contained a virulent attack on Stuart. Similar articles followed in subsequent issues, and it soon appeared that he had been especially singled out by the conductors of the journal for abuse. Stuart raised an action for libel against the publishers, Borthwick & Alexander; but proceedings were stayed owing to a dispute between the two publishers. In the result Borthwick surrendered to Stuart at Glasgow on 11 March 1822 the manuscripts of the obnoxious articles. The author of the most scurrilous among them proved to be Sir Alexander Boswell of Auchinleck. The Earl of Rosslyn, acting in Stuart's behalf, vainly asked Boswell for an explanation. A challenge from Stuart followed on 25 March; but in the course of that night Stuart and Boswell were arrested and taken before the sheriff, who bound them over to keep the peace within the town and county of Edinburgh. It was then arranged that the duel should take place in Fifeshire, and on the following morning the parties met near the village of Auchtertool, Lord Rosslyn acting for Stuart, and the Hon. John Douglas for Boswell. Boswell fired in the air; Stuart, who had never handled a pistol before, fatally wounded his opponent. Boswell died the next day (27 March). Stuart, on the advice of his friends, went to Paris, where he surrendered himself to the British ambassador. Returning to Scotland to stand his trial, he was indicted for wilful murder before the high court of justiciary at Edinburgh on 10 June. He was prosecuted by Sir William Rae, and defended by Jeffrey, James Moncreiff, Cockburn, and other whig members of the Scottish bar. At 5 o'clock on the following morning the jury, without retiring, found Stuart not guilty. \\"No Scotch trial in my time excited such interest,\\" Lord Cockburn says. In the indictment Stuart was also charged with having conspired with Borthwick to steal the manuscripts from the proprietors of the Glasgow Sentinel. Borthwick had been arrested, but was released on the acquittal of Stuart. These proceedings were afterwards discussed at great length in parliament, and the lord-advocate, who had sanctioned them, escaped a vote of censure by a majority of only six. Later life After his acquittal Stuart lived in Edinburgh, at 2 North Charlotte Street off Charlotte SquareEdinburgh Post Office directory 1825and in Fifeshire at Hillside, \\"the grounds of which he greatly beautified\\", until 1828, when, his affairs being embarrassed, he resigned the collectorship of the widows' fund and went to America. Leaving Liverpool on 16 July 1828, he reached New York on 23 August. He sailed from America on 17 April 1831, and landed at Deal on 25 May. In 1833 he published \\"Three Years in North America\\" (2 vols.), an account of his travels, which attracted considerable attention. Two more editions appeared in the following year. Stuart displayed a strong bias in favour of the Americans, and he was involved in a controversy with Sir John Lambert and a Major Pringle regarding his account of the operations and conduct of the British army during the American campaign of 1814–15. Soon after his return Stuart became editor of the (London) \\"Courier\\" newspaper. It was not prosperous at that time, and he tried to increase its popularity by publishing once a week a double number of eight pages, one of which he devoted entirely to reviews. He was editor until 1836, when Lord Melbourne appointed him an inspector of factories. On 3 November 1849 he died of heart disease at Notting Hill, London. Family On 29 April 1802 he married Eleanor Maria Anna, only daughter of Dr. Robert Moubray of Cockairnie in Fife, but left no family.

The fire destroyed 349 buildings in the area between the modern Washington Street and Fort Hill as well as several ships in port, and left over a thousand people homeless.  Background  Since its inception in 1630, the town of Boston was repeatedly damaged by fire, with serious conflagrations taking place in 1653, 1676, 1679, 1682, 1691, 1711, and 1753. Prior to 1760 the term \\"Great Fire\\" had been reserved for the fire of 1711, which had destroyed the First Town-House, but the 1760 blaze proved to be significantly larger and rendered the 1711 one as \\"comparatively unimportant.\\"; . During the month of March 1760, Boston suffered from a series of large fires. On March 17 a blaze damaged several buildings in the West End, including the wooden meeting house which stood on the current site of the Old West Church. On the following day a fire broke out in a building occupied by the Royal Artillery on Griffin's Wharf and soon spread to a quantity of gunpowder and weapons, causing an explosion that destroyed the building and wounded four or five men.; .  The Great Fire  Old State House is marked as \\"a\\" near the top, while the Old South Meeting House is marked as \\"C.\\" At about 2:00 a.m. on March 20, a fire of unknown cause broke out at a dwelling in Cornhill (modern Washington Street, nearly opposite to Pie Alley). Although the blaze was prevented from spreading much to the north or south, it aggressively made its way to the east to Oliver's Dock on the harbor, destroying most of the structures in its path. A veer in the wind caused the fire to change direction toward King (now State) Street, burning the homes on the corner opposite the Bunch-of-Grapes tavern and damaging the warehouses toward the Long Wharf.; . On its southeastern side, the fire expanded from Water Street to Milk Street, where it consumed many of the houses to both the west and east. From there it advanced via Batterymarch to Fort Hill, taking most of the buildings along the way, and reached the South Battery. A panic soon arose over the presence of a large deposit of gunpowder near the battery, but most of the store was hurriedly removed just before the fire reached the area. The remaining powder was ignited by the blaze, however, causing a huge explosion which was heard from as far away as Hampton, New Hampshire.; .  Aftermath  Order of the Connecticut General Assembly, instructing all congregational ministers in the colony to assist in raising donations for the people of Boston following the fire The 1760 fire was described by one contemporary writer as \\"the most terrible Fire that has happened in [Boston]\\" up to that time, although it would later be eclipsed by the Great Boston Fire of 1872.; . 174 houses and 175 warehouses, shops and other buildings were destroyed in the blaze, leaving some two hundred and twenty families homeless − over a thousand people − and the total estimated losses of £53,334 hit especially hard a town that had already \\"borne the extraordinary Expence\\" of the ongoing French and Indian War.; . Earlier estimates of the losses were significantly higher, ranging from £100,000 to £300,000. For an analysis of loss claims, see The human toll of the conflagration, on the other hand, was relatively light, with none reported dead and only a few wounded.; . In the immediate aftermath of the fire, the Massachusetts colonial legislature advanced £3,000 to Boston for relief assistance.; . Over the following months, the town received several donations from throughout the British Empire as news of the disaster spread. The Assemblies of Pennsylvania and New York voted to send relief funds, while in Nova Scotia a significant amount of money was raised for the town, and individuals from as far away as London sent contributions.; . A petition for assistance was also sent to either King George II or George III, but what action was taken as a result is unknown.; . In order to prevent a similar disaster from occurring in the future, the Massachusetts legislature passed new laws and acts that improved fire safety standards in Boston. Any new building more than seven feet high that was made of wood would result in a fine, and a committee was appointed to re-lay the narrow streets of the burnt district. As a result of the new regulations, the homes that were rebuilt in the area were made of brick or slate instead of wood.; .

(Union Oil Co., USA). “Hydrocracking Process with the Use of a Y Type Crystalline Zeolite and a Nitrogen Containing Hydrocarbon Oil”. US Patent 3,269,934 A. 24 Dec. 1963. They eventually began to find use in other industries as the usage of zeolites increased as a whole, such as removal of carbon monoxide from gas.Fuertig, H.; Wolf, F.; Haedicke, U.; Weber, M.; Knoll, H. “Removal of Carbon Monoxide From Gases”. E. Germany Patent DD58736. 20 Nov. 1967. In 1972, a patent was filed describing the production of Cu-Y zeolites from sodium-based zeolites, helping to further spread its use in the industry.Rosback, D. H.(Universal Oil Products Co., USA). “Method For Preparing Copper-Exchanged Type Y Zeolite”. US Patent 3,649,177. 14 Mar. 1972. The first documented use of Cu-Y zeolites for desulfurization was in 1977, in which a variety of zeolites including the Cu-Y variant were used to remove hydrogen sulfide from gases.Phillipe, A.; Mathieu, P.; Tellier, J.; Voirin, R. (Union Oil Co., USA). “Desulfurization of Gases Containing Hydrogen Sulfide”. W. Germany Patent DE2530674 A1. 29 Jan, 1976. (3) From then on, various methods were developed utilizing Cu-Y zeolites in desulfurization of hydrocarbons, reducing their environmental impact when used as fuel. Properties Many experiments have been done to understand the properties of Cu-Y zeolites. The zeolite can act as a catalyst, Brønsted acid, as well as an oxidizing agent. One of the important properties allowing zeolites to act as catalysts is their ability to exchange cations without disturbing the crystalline structure.Ward, J. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1968, 28, 269–278. Cu-Y zeolites have been shown to catalyze the ethylation of benzene due to their acidic properties.Coughlan, B.; Keane, M. Cat. Letters 1990, 5, 113–125. The acidity of these zeolites was determined by infrared spectroscopic studies and comparing the vibrational frequencies of the hydroxyl groups since their Brønsted acidity comes from the hydroxyl groups attached to it. The hydroxyl groups that are more accessible exhibit more acidic properties while the oxygens in the hexagonal prism are less acidic. Copper zeolites also act as oxidizing agents as seen in their ability to ionize anthracene, the electron transfer was proven to happen at the cupric ion.Naccache, C. J. Cat 1971, 22, 171–181. Reaction Mechanisms Possible mechanisms of CuY-zeolite are based on the type of substrate. These mechanisms include π complexation and acid catalysis. 1\\\\. π Complexation The empty s-orbital of cationic copper forms a sigma bond with incoming sulfur and d-orbitals donate electron density to anti-bonding orbitals of sulfur rings. This mechanism is consistent in that pi complexation involves stronger bonds with organo-sulfur molecules than with aromatic sulfur.Hernández-Maldonado, A.; Yang, R. I&E; Chem. Res. 2003, 42, 123–129.Hernández-Maldonado, A.; Yang, R.; Cannella, W. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research 2004, 43, 6142–6149. Copper bonding and reduction sites within a zeolite cage. 2\\\\. Acid Catalysis Although this mechanism is restricted to HY-ZSM5 zeolite, it is essential to note that experiments involving thiophene adsorption have noted saturation uptakes of thiophene to Cu(I) in CuY-zeolite. Adsorption of thiophene then, could be due to a number of acid sites in the CuY-zeolite, specifically Cu(I)Y-zeolite reduced by H+ as compared to HY-zeolite in other studies, which is known to saturate thiophenes specifically.Chica, A.; Strohmaier, K.; Iglesia, E. Langmuir 2004, 20, 10982–10991.King D. L.; Faz C.; Flynn T. Desulfurization of Gasoline Feedstocks for Application in Fuel Reforming. SAE International. [Online early access]. DOI: 10.4271/2000-01-0002. Published Online: Mar 6, 2000. http://papers.sae.org/2000-01-0002/ (accessed Feb 12, 2015). Applications The two most common applications of the Cu(I) Y Zeolite are catalytic decomposition of nitrous oxide to nitrogen and oxygen, and desulfurization of fuels used in the hydrocracking process for petroleum production. The decomposition of nitrous oxide and reducing the emissions into the atmosphere is important to protect the environment. Nitrous oxide reacts with ozone to create nitric oxide, thereby contributing in the destruction of the ozone. Therefore, it must be decomposed into its elements, nitrogen and oxygen, which are inert components of air. The zeolite is used because it uniquely positions the necessary active sites for the decomposition.Li, Y.; Armor, J. Applied Cat. B: Env. 1992, 1. However, Cu(I) Y zeolite is not the most efficient copper exchanged catalyst used for this purpose. Research shows the Cu-ZSM-5 has higher catalytic activity even though the Y zeolite has a larger pore size and higher copper loading.Li, Y. J. Cat. 1991, 129, 202–215. Within gasoline and diesel, the government requires sulfur levels to be reduced from 300 - 500 ppm to 30 ppm and 15 ppm respectively. For fuel cell applications sulfur must be under 1 ppm to avoid poisoning the fuel cell.Yang, R.; Hernandez-Maldonado, A.; Yang, F. Chem. Inform. 2003, 34. Cu(I) Y zeolite catalyst is typically used to reduce the sulfur in both situations. The hydrodesulfurization technique can remove thiols and sulfides, but cannot efficiently remove thiophenes, therefore the catalyst is used because it selectively adsorbs the sulfur compounds at ambient temperature and pressure. They selectively bind to the thiophenic compounds by pi complexation. The pi complexation involves the donation of electron charges from the thiophene pi- orbital to the vacant s orbital of the copper. At the same time, the d-orbitals of the metals donate electron charges to the anti-bonding pi- orbital. This donation to the s orbital of copper is important in adsorbing thiophene. The downfall of using the Cu(I) Y zeolite catalyst for desulfurization is that moisture exhibits strong inhibiting effects on the adsorption process because the water molecule is preferred over sulfur.Li, Y.; Yang, F.; Qi, G.; Yang, R. Catalysis Today 2006, 116, 512–518. This is part of the typical process for desulfurization of natural gas where the catalyst is within the packed bed reactor. The blue molecules represent the catalyst caging in the sulfur molecules (orange) and water molecules (purple) who compete for the active sites.

Work Sayre Gomez works across mediums, namely painting, sculpture and video, to address themes of perception and representation in the face of patriarchal political systems. Recurring metaphors such as windows are often used as a structural approach to investigating the role of context in the distribution and legibility of images in the 21st century. His work references the history of appropriation in tandem with a realist approach to rendering as a way of situating his practice within the traditions of conceptual art as well as pop art and the Pictures Generation. Shortly after graduating from CalArts, Gomez began his early ‘Thief’ paintings. In these combinations of his characteristic trompe l’oeil effect and abstraction, a plane of colours—often a pool of blurred and splattered paint washes—is in the process of being lifted by a pair of covert gloved hands.The imagery was inspired by an illustration that a friend had posted to Gomez’s Facebook wall.

The film is about a young woman (Suki Waterhouse) exiled to a desert where she is attacked by a group of cannibals (led by Jason Momoa), barely escaping alive to a bizarre settlement run by a charismatic leader (Keanu Reeves). Other actors include Jim Carrey, Giovanni Ribisi, and Diego Luna. It was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Special Jury Prize. It was released in theaters on June 23, 2017, by Neon.  Plot  A young woman named Arlen is exiled to a desert outside Texas, where people deemed undesirable by society (the \\"bad batch\\") are forced to fend for themselves. A sign declares the area outside of the US and that American laws and citizenship no longer apply. Arlen is soon kidnapped by two women in a golf cart. When she wakes chained up, a woman cuts off her right arm and leg. Arlen tricks the woman into unchaining her, kills her, observes cannibalism of human limbs, and escapes crawling on a skateboard. She is rescued in the desert by a mute hermit, who takes her to a makeshift settlement named Comfort that has all- night raves. Five months later, Arlen has a prosthetic leg and a home in Comfort. She walks out to the desert with a pistol. Investigating a golf cart similar to the one used by the cannibals, she finds a woman and little girl scavenging in a garbage dump. Accusing the woman of being part of the cannibal community, Arlen shoots her in the head. She takes the girl back to Comfort, observed by the hermit. Miami Man, a leader of the cannibals and the father of the girl, goes looking for her, finding the dead woman, and then the hermit. The hermit, in exchange for a hand-sketched portrait, advises Miami Man to \\"find Comfort\\". In Comfort, Arlen takes a hallucinogen at a rave held by The Dream, the cult-like leader of Comfort, and loses track of the child, who is taken in by The Dream. Hallucinating, Arlen wanders out into the desert, where Miami Man finds her. Upon threat of death, he demands that she find his daughter in Comfort. Arlen and Miami Man grow closer on their journey to Comfort. He kills another cannibal who is looking to trade gasoline for her flesh and reveals that he was put into the lawless territory because he was an illegal immigrant from Cuba. However, another man shoots Miami Man in the chest, and Arlen somewhat reluctantly returns to Comfort. She searches for the girl, eventually discovering she is living in The Dream's mansion, along with his large harem of pregnant young women. Arlen visits The Dream, who explains that Comfort's economy is run on the drugs his concubines make, and that Comfort is free of feces because of the plumbing he provides. Arlen agrees to join his harem but uses a pistol she has hidden inside her prosthetic to hold one of the pregnant concubines hostage. After extracting the girl, they head out of Comfort in a golf cart and reunite with Miami Man, who had been found and healed by the hermit. The child and Miami Man blissfully reunite, and Arlen implies she would rather stay with him in the desert than live in Comfort. Miami Man tries to discourage her, deeming her unable to survive out in the harsh desert, but does not send her away. The daughter asks for spaghetti, as she had grown accustomed to good things in the mansion. Instead, Miami Man takes his daughter's pet rabbit, and later the three of them lounge by a fire eating it. Miami Man rubs his teary daughter's back, and then he and Arlen look into each other's eyes, smiling.

In March 2015, Keanu Reeves, Jim Carrey, Jason Momoa, Suki Waterhouse, and Diego Luna joined the film. Filming Principal photography on the film began on April 8, 2015, in Los Angeles. Film was also shot in Niland and Bombay Beach, California. Release The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on September 6, 2016. Shortly after, Netflix and Screen Media Films acquired SVOD and theatrical distribution rights to the film, respectively. However, Neon later acquired distribution rights to the film. The film also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2016. It was released in a limited release on June 23, 2017 and was made available on Digital HD from Amazon Video and iTunes on June 22, 2017. The Bad Batch DVD and Blu-ray were released on September 19, 2017.

During his athletic career, O'Dwyer holds two senior Irish outdoor (2002 and 2003) and indoor titles (2003 and 2004), and competed in the men's high jump at the 2004 Summer Olympics, representing his nation Ireland. Additionally, he set his own personal best and a remarkable Irish record at 2.30 m at the international meet in Algiers to secure a place on the Olympic team. Indeed, O'Dwyer is one of the tallest athletes in the elite Irish track and field team, standing . Early life O'Dwyer was born in Kilkenny to his sporting parents Paddy O'Dwyer, a judoka who competed for Ireland at the 1975 World Judo Championships in Vienna, Austria, and Gudrun Marx, an East German-born eventing rider. O'Dwyer attended both primary and secondary school at CBS Kilkenny, where he began his athletics career and lettered in the sprint races and long jump. At the age of 13, O'Dwyer grew exceptionally taller and turned his attention to high jump. Since then, O'Dwyer excelled the sport, and had an initial jump of 1.86 m, until he extended it tremendously to 2.01 to establish a high school and junior record in 1999. In 2000, O'Dwyer moved to St Kieran's College to continually pursue his high jump career. While at St Kieran's, he set numerous intermediate high school records and earned more titles in the same discipline at the Irish Schools Athletics Championships. International career After graduating from St Kieran's in early 2003, O'Dwyer trained full-time for Kilkenny City Harriers, under his personal coach Sean Lynch. In June 2003, O'Dwyer overhauled the seven-feet barrier (2.13 m) for the first time in nearly decades to attain a heroic second-place finish on his international debut at the Europa Cup meet in Copenhagen, Denmark. In the 2004 indoor season, O'Dwyer recorded a new career best and a national record of 2.27 m to finish eighth in the final at the World Championships in Budapest, making him the first Irish athlete to reach the top of the world indoor rankings in any field event. Shortly after the Worlds, O'Dwyer broke the Irish under-23 record with a leap of 2.26 m at the high jump meet in Eppingen, Germany, edging closer to the 2.30-metre mark. Upon entering the outdoor season in June 2004, O'Dwyer pulled off a magnificent jump at 2.30 m to trump the home crowd favorite and 2000 Olympic bronze medalist Abderrahmane Hammad for the high jump title at the international meet in Algiers, Algeria. In doing so, he smashed both his personal best and a five-year senior national outdoor record (previously set by Brendan Reilly in 1999) and achieved an Olympic A-standard to book his place on the Irish team to the Games. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, O'Dwyer qualified for the Irish squad, as a lone athlete, in the men's high jump. O'Dwyer had crashed out prematurely of the qualifying round after failing to clear an opening height of 2.10 metres in all three attempts that left him bitterly disappointed by his poor performance. Personal life O'Dwyer currently owns and runs a gym, Leviathan Training in Kilkenny City. He is also co-leader of a top 20 team, CHIMERA, in the Hill Climb Racing 2 game, having previously co-led the KO team to the position of 13 in the world. He holds several world and Irish records in the game and is accepted as the number one Irish player.

Entrance of the renewed building in June 2017  History  In the 1990s, an interreligious society was established in the canton of Zürich to support the foundation of a centre for spiritual and cultural care of Tamil people in Switzerland, as well as to preserve and maintain the Tamil culture of the approximatively 35,000 (around 20,000 in the canton of Zürich) Tamil people of Sri Lankan origin living in Switzerland. So, the Sri Sivasubramaniar Temple in Adliswil and the Arulmiku Sivan Temple in Glattbrugg were founded in 1994 as a non-profit foundation. While some 5,000 Indian Hindus in Switzerland founded their own cultural associations, but not a temple, the Tamil Hindus opened 19 houses of worship since the 1990s.  Location  The temple was established in a pre-existing warehouse at the industry quarter between Glattbrugg and Seebach (Zürich). The Temple is located at Industriestrasse 34, 8152 Glattbrugg.  Cultural and religious life  Poojas are celebrated twice per day, and the temple festivals attract up to 4,000 devotees and visitors.  Chor der gläubigen Bürger  Theater am Neumarkt in Zürich What do people in Zürich believe in? Which prayer rooms, which churches, mosques or temples do they visit? These were the questions at the beginning of a research project in Zürich's religious life. The Neumarkt Theatre developed the play Urban Prayers Zürich from this, which was performed in March 2018 in the midst of the altars and columns of the Glattbrugg Shiva Temple. Five actresses and actors from the Theater am Neumarkt and fifteen members from different religious communities – Muslims, Hindus, Jews, Orthodox, Free Churchers and also atheists – form the Chor der gläubigen Bürger (englisch: Choir of Believing Citizens). But they do not speak with one voice. The ensemble tries, often in vain, to find a voice. But as soon as one of them starts talking, the other one already has his say. They talk to each other with many tongues and then pass each other again.

Accessed via https://www.gbif.org/species/2258118 on 2015-03-27 However, there are some disagreement in the correct taxonomic classification of this genus. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) classifies Aphanipathes as being a genus of the family Aphanipathidae while the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) classifies it as a genus of the family Antipathidae. Most commonly found in subtropic and tropic regions, this genus of coral lives in colonies on the continental slope of the ocean floor or on coral reefs. The colonies exhibit different physical appearances; they can be bushy, fan-shaped or branched like feathers. Most of the Aphanipathes species are found in tropical regions where they thrive and live successfully. They are never found in Arctic or Antarctic regions and are very scarce in temperate areas.  Appearance and morphology  Species can be subdivided into three groups: species with nearly uniform polypar spines, species with slightly irregular polypar spines and normal hypostomal spines and species with slightly irregular polypar spines and reduced hypostomal spines. Comparing four members of the genus, as described by Opresko, Aphanipathes sarothamnoides, Aphanipathes salix, Aphanipathes verticillata, and Aphanipathes pedata all exhibit bushy, irregular branching corallum with mostly straight, elongated, upward branches. Members of this genus tend to have uniserially arranged branches and branchlets, except for A. salix. A. columbiana colonies take a fan-shape that exhibits 9th order and greater branching with colonies growing in height usually less than 12 cm, but as high as 25 cm. Branchlets are ≤0.15mm in diameter, have smooth, needle-like spines usually 25mm tall or shorter and spaced 0.18-0.31 mm apart; polyps are spaced 0.27-0.36mm apart and are 0.55-0.65mm in transverse diameter. Polyps living on branchlets grow on one side, in rows of 9-10 per cm. A. columbiana colonies resemble those of Antipathes expansa, but expansa has spines which are more uniform in size. Compared to two common fan-shaped coral species also in the western Atlantic: Antipathes atlantica and Antipathes gracilis, Aphanipathes colombiana has long, smooth spines, not small (0.1mm) triangular ones. Aphanipathes thyoides, a Caribbean species has similar spines and a similar branching shape, but unlike A. columbiana, its hypostomal spines are smaller or not present. Aphanipathes verticillata is a morphologically plastic species with large colonies branched to the 12th or greater order, with compressed conical spines covered in small conical tubercles, longitudinally arranged in rows. Polypar spines can be as long as 0.3 mm, and abpolypar spines 0.09-0.15 mm. Spines in rows are spaced 0.28-0.36 mm apart usually, but not more than 0.5mm. A. verticillata polyps are typically 1.2-1.5 mm in transverse diameter and are spaced 0.3-0.4 mm apart in single rows on branchlets. Colonies collected in Hawaii range in height from 0.25-1.5m tall. Aphanipathes sarothamnoides has 5-10 cm long branchlets, spaced 1.5-2.5cm apart with 0.2mm long spines, with tubercles covering the top third or half of spines at an average density of 2.3/1000μm2. A. verticillata mauiensis and A. verticillata verticillata (found in Japan) are different only in tubercle density. The Hawaiian subspecies exhibits tubercle density of 2.4/1000μm2 and the Okinawa subspecies exhibits tubercle density of 2.9/1000μm2. Aphanipathes salix has 2-3 cm long branchlets, spaced 0.3-2 cm apart, with 0.22 mm tall polypar and 0.13 mm abpolypar spines. A. salix has few spine tubercles, mostly near the apex with an average density of 2.2/1000μm2.  Distribution  A. columbiana has been found off the coast of Colombia, with colonies off Santa Marta and Isla del Tesoro in the rocky littoral zone and coral reefs in the western Atlantic. Aphanipathes can be found in the southwestern Atlantic, especially off the coast of Brazil (20°10’S). A. pedata and A. salix have been found in the West Indies, A. verticillata in the Indian Ocean and A. pedata off the Atlantic coast of Florida. A. sarothamnoides can be found in the south Pacific and off the coast of Palau in the northwest Pacific. A. verticillata is a species of Aphanipathes originally identified in the Ryukyu Islands and Okinawa Island, Japan, but a subspecies has also been identified in the Au’au Channel between Maui and Lanai, Hawaii.  Relationship to genus Phanopathes  DNA sequencing on Aphanipathes pedata and Aphanipathes sarothamnoides show a close relationship Phanopathes rigida, which is in the same family Aphanipathidae.

Gunkel that discusses the evolution of the theory of human ethical responsibilities toward non-human things and to what extent intelligent, autonomous machines can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and what legitimate claims to moral consideration they can hold. The book was awarded as the 2012 Best Single Authored Book by the Communication Ethics Division of the National Communication Association. Content The book is spread across three chapters, with the first two chapters focusing on an overall review of the history of philosophy and its discussion of moral agency, moral rights, human rights, and animal rights and the third chapter focusing on what defines \\"thingness\\" and why machines have been excluded from moral and ethical consideration due to a misuse of the patient/agent binary. The first chapter, titled Moral Agency, breaks down the history of said agency based on what it included and excluded in various parts of history. Gunkel also raises the conflict between discussing the morality of humans toward objects and the theory of the philosophy of technology that \\"technology is merely a tool: a means to an end\\". The main issue, he explains, in defining what constitutes an appropriate moral agent is that there will be things left outside of what is included, as the definition is based on a set of characteristics that will inherently not be all-encompassing. The subject of consciousness is broached and subsequently derided by Gunkel because of it being one of the main arguments against machine rights, while Gunkel points out that no \\"settled definition\\" of the term exists and that he considers it no better than a synonym used for \\"the occultish soul\\". In addition, the issue of the other minds problem entails that no proper understanding of consciousness can come to pass due to the inability to properly understand the mind of a being that is not oneself. The second chapter, titled Moral Patiency, focuses on the patient end of the topic and discusses the expansion of the field of animal studies and environmental studies. Gunkel describes moral patients as the ones that are to be the object of moral consideration and deserve such consideration even if they lack their own agency, such as animals, thus allowing moral consideration itself to be broader and more inclusive. The topic of other minds is discussed again when examining the question of whether animals can suffer, a question that Gunkel ultimately abandons because it encounters the same problems that the topic of consciousness does. Especially because the subject of animal rights is often only afforded for the animals deemed to be \\"cute\\", but often not including \\"reptiles, insects, or microbes\\". Gunkel continues on to examine environmental ethics and information ethics, but finds them to be too anthropocentric, just as all the other examined models have been. The third chapter, titled Thinking Otherwise, proposes a combination of Heideggerian ontology and Levinasian ethics to properly discuss the otherness of technology and machines, but finds that the patient/agent binary is unable to be properly extended to confine the extent of \\"the machine question\\". In discussing the land ethic philosophy espoused by Aldo Leopold, Gunkel proposes that it is the entire relationship between agent and patient that should have moral consideration and not a specific definition based on either side, as each part contributes to the relationship as a whole and cannot be removed without breaking that relationship. Critical reception Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries writer R. S. Stansbury explained that the book is able to use simple examples to discuss difficult topics and separate ideas and that it would be \\"useful for philosophy students, and for engineering students interested in exploring the ethical implications of their work\\". Dominika Dzwonkowska, writing for International Philosophical Quarterly, stated that the \\"unprecedented value of the book is that Gunkel not only analyzes important aspects of the immediate problem but also that he places his discussion in the context of philosophical discussions on such related issues as rights discourse.\\" Mark Coeckelbergh in Ethics and Information Technology noted that focusing on the question itself of the machine question allows further exploration of machine ethics and the expansion of general ethics and that the book's questions point out that \\"good, critical philosophical reflection on machines is not only about how we should cope with machines, but also about how we (should) think and what role technology plays (and should play) in this thinking.\\" A review in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews by Colin Allen criticized some of Gunkel's methodology and the indecisiveness of his ultimate answer to the machine question, but also acknowledged that the book \\"succeeded in connecting the ethics of robots and AI to a much broader ethical discussion than has been represented in the literature on machine ethics to date\\". Blay Whitby, in a review for AISB Quarterly, lauded The Machine Question for its \\"clear exposition\\" and wide range of references to other works, concluding that the book is \\"essential reading for philosophers interested in AI, robot ethics, or animal ethics\\". In a twin review of The Machine Question and Robot Ethics: The Ethical and Social Implications of Robots by Patrick Lin, Keith Abney, and George A. Bekey, Techné: Research in Philosophy and Technology reviewer Jeff Shaw called Gunkel's book a good introduction to the \\"complex field of robot ethics\\" and that both books are \\"highly recommended to both the general reader as well as to experts in the field of robotics, philosophy, and ethics.\\" See also References External links * The Machine Question, Official website * The Machine Question on the MIT Press, publisher website Category:Ethics literature Category:2012 non-fiction books Category:Philosophy of artificial intelligence ","title":"The Machine Question"},{"id":"46181949","text":"Dido, Queen of Carthage may refer to: * Dido, founder and first queen of Carthage * Dido, Queen of Carthage (play), a play by Christopher Marlowe * Dido, Queen of Carthage (opera), an opera by Stephen Storace See also * Dido (disambiguation) ","title":"Dido, Queen of Carthage"},{"id":"46181952","text":"Matúš Hruška (born 17 September 1994) is a Slovak football goalkeeper who plays for MFK Dukla Banská Bystrica.

Career highlights  ; Research During World War II, she worked in the United States Naval Research Laboratory's Aircraft and Electrical Division. In the early 1950, Harmon worked for the Bureau of Standards and the Naval Research Bureau in Washington, D.C. In 1953, she became chief research printed circuit engineer for the Aerovox Corporation, headquartered at Plant 2 in New Bedford, Massachusetts. At the time, she had the responsibility of directing the research and development, as well as establishing plant procedures for new methods of printed circuitry and printed circuit components. In the 1970s, she was head of Aerovox Corporation's printed circuit activities. She was a member of the American Chemical Society, the Institute of Radio Engineers, and the Texas Academy of Science. One of Harmon's major contributions to the field was the development of a hot die stamp method to create printed circuits in which silver conductors were infused on thermoplastics and thermosetting materials. She and Philip J. Franklin (né Philip Jacquins Franklin; 1909–1979) were awarded a patent in 1953 for this technological breakthrough. Harmon also researched the action of grease and lubricants in high speed bearings and established the pilot plant procedures for an entirely new method of printed circuitry. ; Teaching Harmon taught chemistry, physics, and biology at the Brownsville Junior High School from about 1934 to 1937.

Together with similar structures at Fort Mitchell (Spike Island), Fort Camden (Crosshaven), and Templebreedy Battery (also close to Crosshaven), the fort was built to defend the mouth of Cork Harbour. Though used as a fortification from the early 17th century, the current structures of the 74 acre site date primarily from the 1860s. Originally named Fort Carlisle and operated by the British Armed Forces, the fort was handed-over to the Irish Defence Forces in 1938, and renamed Fort Davis. The facility is owned by the Department of Defence, and is used as a military training site with no public access. History The coastline at Whitegate, north of Roche's Point, is at a strategic position overlooking the entrance to Cork Harbour - one of the world's largest natural harbours, and historically of defensive and naval importance to Ireland and the region. One of the earliest documented fortifications at this point was built prior to 1607, and came to be known as \\"Prince Rupert's Tower\\" (for Prince Rupert of the Rhine). By the period of the Williamite War (1689-1691) additional coastal defence fortifications were in place on the site, and known as \\"King John's Fort\\" (for John, King of England). Together with Fort Camden, this fort fell to Williamite forces under the Duke of Marlborough in the lead- up to the Siege of Cork (1690). Additional construction works were undertaken from the 1790s,A fortified tunnel still bears the date 1797 and some of these tunnels and structures were used during the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) to house French prisoners of war. Fort Meagher (then Fort Camden) By the mid-19th century the defences had been renamed to Fort Carlisle (for Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle a previous Lord Lieutenant of Ireland). In the 1850s, a Royal Commission gave renewed consideration to the strategic importance of the harbour, and proposed enhancements to the defences at Fort Mitchell (Spike Island), Fort Camden (Crosshaven), and Fort Carlisle. During the 1860s Fort Carlisle was therefore redeveloped along the lines of other \\"Palmerston Forts\\" in the region. Some of this development took advantage of 19th century advancements in the use of concrete. During the First World War (1914-1918), the harbour was used as a naval base to cover the \\"Western Approaches\\", and Fort Davis was used to complement the defences of Fort Camden on the opposite side of the harbour entrance. Royal Garrison Artillery Coastal Defence units were stationed in the fort at this time. The fort did not see significant action during the Irish War of Independence - although a number of graves in the fort's military cemetery date from this period. Following the war, under the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the harbour defences remained in the control of British government. These Treaty Port installations, including Fort Carlisle, were handed-over to the Irish authorities in 1938. The fort was renamed Fort Davis for Thomas Davis - who was the chief organiser of the Young Ireland movement. (Similarly, \\"Fort Westmoreland\\" on Spike Island was renamed \\"Fort Mitchell\\", and \\"Fort Camden\\" near Crosshaven was renamed \\"Fort Meagher\\"). During \\"the Emergency\\" (1939-1945), elements of the Coastal Defence Artillery (CDA) of the Irish Artillery Corps operated from the fort. By the mid- to late-20th century the CDA was merged into other artillery regiments of the Irish Army, and the fort primarily used as a training site. The site remains in the ownership of the Department of Defence and is used by the Irish Army for exercises, ceremonial \\"gun salutes\\" and other training purposes. Layout Haulbowline Naval Base, (B) Fort Mitchel/Westmoreland, (C) Fort Meagher/Camden, (D) Fort Davis/Carlisle, (E) Fort Templebreedy The features of the fort date primarily to developments in the 19th century, when - at peak - the fort had upwards of 20 guns. On the landward side, a dry-moat, ramparts, terreplein, caponier and flanking batteries defended the approaches. The dry- moat is deep and wide at points, and was originally crossed by a drawbridge. The star shaped landward defences included three musketry caponiers, and a simple terreplein with movable guns. On the seaward side, land batteries were trained on the harbour from eight gun emplacements. These batteries were built with a number of underground shelters, vaulted magazines, and linked in places by bunkered tunnels. Though changed over time, the batteries were originally constructed to include: * Main emplacement - Dating from the Napoleonic era, this is triangular in layout with one full bastion, two demi-bastions and one semi-circular bastion * Number 1 battery - As with several of the fort's other batteries, this dates from the Victorian reconstruction. Originally it had Moncrieff mountings for four RML 7 inch guns (later reconstructed for three QF 12-pounder guns) * Number 2 battery - Casemated with shields for two RML 10 inch guns * Number 3 battery - Moncrieff mountings for four RML 7 inch guns * Number 4 battery - Casemated for four RML 10 inch guns (later converted to an oil store) * North Battery - Two BL 6 inch coastal defence guns * Rupert's Tower Battery - Two RML 12 inch guns (later rebuilt for two BL 6-inch Mk VII guns) * South Battery - Two BL 9.2 inch guns Other features of the fort include a military cemetery, a waterfront pier for sea-borne access, and a number of over-ground barracks and support buildings. Evidence of torpedo defences were discovered at the fort during clearing works in 2015.

After the January 2015 election, MP Alexis Tsipras named as the Greek Alternate Minister for Combating Unemployment in his cabinet. She remains a Syriza member. On the 5th of September 2018 she was appointed by the Greek Government as the Permanent Representative of Greece (Ambassador) to the OECD in Paris, France, entrusting her to represent the country despite the severe media attack she had been subjected to a few months earlier. Between February and August 2015, she also was a member of the Hellenic Parliament. A former macroeconomic policy adviser for UN Women and consultant UNDP and the ILO, she is specialized in macroeconomic gender issues and job creation in extreme unemployment economic environments. She is Associate Professor of Economics at New York Bard College and a senior scholar of the Levy Economics Institute where she is involved with the Modern Monetary Theory school of post-Keynesian economics. A co-initiator of the Economists for Full Employment project, she has been a long-time supporter of a job guarantee with the state being employer of last resort. Following a successful 2011 pilot project, she has been appointed Alternate Minister for Combatting Unemployment in the Syriza-led Tsipras Government. In her ministerial office, she is specifically tasked with implementing a nationwide program to combat long-term unemployment by creating at least 300,000 new jobs for the unemployed. Education and early career When in 1997 Antonopoulou received her Ph.D. economics from the New School for Social Research, she had already been teaching economics at New York University and in the same year was awarded the university's Teaching Excellence Award. At New York University she taught Economics, a post she would hold until 2006. Working in the fields of feminist economics, international trade, and the economics of globalization, Antonopoulou served as macroeconomic policy adviser for UN Women, and as advising consultant for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Labour Office (ILO). In 2002, she became co-director of the Knowledge Networking Program on Engendering Macroeconomics and International Economics (GEM-IWG) and co-founded GEM-Europe and GEM-Turkey. Academic career Prior to her involvement in politics, Antonopoulou served as Associate Professor of Economics at Bard College she has been affiliated with since 2001. She is also a senior scholar with the associated Levy Economics Institute and director of the Gender Equality and the Economy program. In the last years she has further specialized in linkages of gender and macro economics, in the macroeconomic impact of job guarantee policies, and in the implications of unpaid work on poverty indicators. In line with her heterodox policy oriented research, she continued working on her concept of a \\"Job guarantee\\" which she has been developing at the Levy Institute of Bard College since 2006. This concept turns the state into an Employer of last resort that issues publicly funded jobs at minimum wage level to everybody unable to find a job in the private sector. When job opportunities are scarce, it is argued, public policy must ensure that the institutional means of implementation of the RIGHT TO WORK, that is, of Article 23.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are in place. The huge rise of unemployment following the Greek government-debt crisis and the austerity measures imposed by the Troika led the PASOK-led Ministry of Labour into giving the concept a chance. In 2012, a first pilot program was rolled out for 55,000 unemployed. An extended, translated version of: Minister for Combatting Unemployment When in the January 2015 elections, Antonopoulou was elected a Member of the Hellenic Parliament on Syriza's state list, new Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras appointed her Alternate Minister for Combatting Unemployment. Her portfolio also included the strengthening of the Social and Solidarity Economy sector of the economy and she is credited with the enactment of the SSE law which was voted in parliament in October 2016. Antonopoulou is the second Modern Monetary Theory scholar to assume a high-profile post in a government, following her former colleague at Bard College, Stephanie Kelton, who earlier in January was appointed Chief Economist of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee. In her ministerial office, Antonopoulou is specifically tasked with implementing a nationwide \\"Job guarantee\\" program to combat long-term unemployment, creating at least 300,000 new jobs for the unemployed. The program has been described both by herself and by others as being a centerpiece of a \\"Greek New Deal\\" as proposed by the Syriza government. Outlined in a Levy Institute policy paper from October 2014, the program will be built on the experience of the 2012 pilot project and won't be restricted to reskilling some of the unemployed for the private sector. The program, with precedents only in the Indian Rural Employment Guarantee, is rather set to create publicly funded long-term jobs to allow the unemployed fulfilling socially needed tasks at a minimum wage level. In a February 2015 interview with Deutsche Welle, Antonopoulos pointed out that \\"the main problem in Greece is lack of aggregate demand and consequent lack of jobs, not lack of skills.\\" Results of the 2012 pilot project suggested that some 500,000 of the totaling 1.3 million unemployed in Greece would be willing to take up such a minimum- wage level job. Private life Prior to her arrival in Athens to join the Greek Government's cabinet in September 2015, Antonopoulou lived in New York City since 1977, and is married to her colleague at Bard College, Greek American economist Dimitri B. Papadimitriou. In February 2018, it became public that she had been receiving a rent subsidy of 12.000 Euro each year. Despite the fact that there was no issue of legality ever raised, and, although several other cabinet members of the Syriza administration had been receiving the same subsidy benefit, her media character assassination was based on the argument that she was 'rich and did not need it'. It has wrongfully been reported in the international press that PM Tsipras dismissed her.washingtonpost.com: Greece: Wealthy minister quits after rent subsidy furor She resigned on her own will, as the domestic media power proved unstoppable in diverting the attention of the public away of the Novartis scandal by focusing on the legal yet 'unethical' choice, a Syriza cabinet member had made.

Early life Jones was born in Germany, the youngest son of H. Jones, who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions as commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Battle of Goose Green in the Falklands War of 1982. Rupert Jones attended St. Peter's Preparatory School in Seaford, Sussex and Sherborne School. He later read History at Reading University. Military career Jones joined the British Army as an undergraduate cadet in 1987 and was commissioned into the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, his father's former regiment. He served his early career in Germany, Northern Ireland and Bosnia, and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2001 Birthday Honours. Following company command, he served as Chief of Staff 12th Mechanized Brigade, deploying to Iraq in 2005. He served as commanding officer of 4th Battalion, The Rifles from 2008 to 2010, during which the battalion deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick. In February 2010, he launched the Care for Casualties appeal on behalf of the Rifles. During his career Jones has served in the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on numerous occasions, including as an SO3 in the Directorate of Military Operations with responsibility for Military Aid to the Civil Authorities and Counter Terrorism, as Military Assistant to the MOD's Director of Operations, as the Armed Forces representative advising Lord Levene's Steering Group during Defence Reform, and for a short period as the Chief of the General Staff's Colonel Army Strategy. Jones was promoted to colonel, with seniority, from July 2011. He completed the Higher Command and Staff Course the following year and then took command of 1st Armoured Infantry Brigade, where he commanded Task Force Helmand from April to October 2013. While in Afghanistan, he was promoted to brigadier. In March 2014, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire, following service to the War in Afghanistan. From 2014 to 2016, he served as the Assistant Chief of Staff Operations and the Chief of Staff to the Standing Joint Commander (UK) in the Army HQ. Operation Inherent Resolve Jones speaks with a British explosive ordnance disposal trainer during a visit near left In April 2016 Jones was promoted to major general, becoming, at age 47, the youngest general in the British Army at the time, and was appointed the deputy commander of Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) later that year. In November 2016, he hailed the \\"extraordinary amount of progress\\" made by the international coalition, as result of their daily strikes against Da'esh. In the same month, he commented \\"go and ask your Da'esh commander if they've been hit hard enough\\" in response to Donald Trump's comment that \\"I know more Isis than the generals do, believe me. I would bomb the shit out of them\\" in 2015. In February 2017, during a briefing in London, Jones stated: \\"We as an international coalition have always been very clear: if you are going to take up arms on behalf of Da'esh, and you are going to kill innocent civilians, we will find you and we will kill you. That does not matter whether they are from London, or Paris, or from Baghdad. We will target you under the laws of armed conflict\\". He added that Da'esh fighters were being killed \\"at a rate they simply can't sustain\\". Commenting on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, he said: \\"If we in the international coalition knew where he was, for certain then he wouldn't stay alive for very long. I think if he was dead then there probably would have been an announcement to say he's dead. Most of Baghdadi's lieutenants are dead. He is now frankly in hiding. His narrative of some kind of caliphate, well that's exposed as a lie when you're in hiding yourself.\\" In August 2017, Jones echoed comments made by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in a Pentagon press conference, by giving Da'esh fighters the choice to \\"surrender or die\\". He went on to say that Da'esh \\"are losing on all fronts. They are losing on the battlefield, they are losing financially, the flow of foreign fighters has slowed to a trickle. Their narrative has been significantly discredited\\". Jones handed over to Major General Felix Gedney in late August 2017. Senior staff and command In January 2018, Jones was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff in succession to Major General Nick Welch. The role represents the Chief of the General Staff in Whitehall. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Legion of Merit by the United States in May 2018. On 3 September 2018, his title was renamed as Director Engagement and Communications (D E&C;), assisting in communicating army statements across defence internally and externally.

Early life Sax was born in Los Angeles on April 26, 1936 to Mildred and Remy Sax. While attending Fairfax High School in West LA, Sax played the trumpet alongside trumpeter Herb Alpert. Upon graduation, Sax attended UCLA and then was drafted into the Army where he played trumpet in the 7th Army Symphony from 1959-1961. Career Doug Sax with 4 Lathes From an early age, Sax was interested in recorded sound, and although he had established a career as a symphonic trumpeter, on December 27, 1967, along with Lincoln Mayorga, a friend from junior high who had become a music arranger and pianist for Capitol Records, and Sax's older brother Sherwood (Bert), an engineer, he opened The Mastering Lab. One of the first big albums Sax mastered at The Mastering Lab was The Doors' debut album which was inducted into the Library of Congress on March 25, 2015. The Mastering Lab uses equipment designed by Sherwood, which features handcrafted electronics, from the tape machines to the equalizers, compressors / limiters, A/D - D/A converters, and monitoring amplifiers. That, combined with his ears and expertise, helped Sax forge a long and successful career at The Mastering Lab. In 1970, Sax and Mayorga founded Sheffield Lab Recordings, an audiophile label which produced direct-to-disc classical and jazz albums. In the 1970s he helped establish the audiophile record company Sheffield Lab, with his friend Lincoln Mayorga. Known for their Direct-To-Disk and Live to 2-track recordings, they recorded such artists as Dave Grusin, Thelma Houston, Harry James, James Newton Howard, Michael Ruff, Pat Coil, and Clair Marlo. By 1972, Sax was mastering 20% of the top 100 chart in Billboard magazine. Albums mastered by Sax and released in 1971 included such titles as The Who's Who's Next, Harry Nilsson's Nilsson Schmilsson, The Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers and the Eagles' debut album. During his career, Sax cut thousands of LP masters with his custom designed, all-tube signal path including Pink Floyd's The Wall (and all subsequent Pink Floyd releases up to 2014's The Endless River), the reissue of the Slayer thrash metal group's Vinyl Conflict box set and Pantera vinyl reissues, the Eagles' Greatest Hits, and Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin.

Harris was the club's first president, and under her leadership the club joined the United Golf Association and the Eastern Golf Association. In 1938 the club drafted and sent a petition to Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes seeking to desegregate the public courses of the District of Columbia. In response Ickes approved the construction of a nine-hole golf course on the site of an abandoned trash dump, called Langston Golf Course, which opened in 1939. The Wake-Robin Golf Club and the Royal Golf Club continued to pressure Secretary Ickes, and he issued an order in 1941 opening public courses to all. In 1947 Harris was elected as the first female president of the Eastern Golf Association; she was president for two terms. The Wake-Robin Golf Club was part of the movement to force the Professional Golfers Association to drop its \\"White-only\\" rule for eligibility, which it did in 1961. In 1973 Harris was inducted into the National Afro‐American Golfers Hall of Fame. Harris was also an educator in the Washington, DC school system.

The overlapping nature of their charters of land in Colonial America required numerous attempts at mediation, surveying, and intervention by the king and courts of England to ultimately be resolved. Subsequent questions over these charters have also been adjudicated by American arbitrators and the Supreme Court of the United States. The boundary dispute shaped the eventual borders of five U.S. states: Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia. Background In 1629, Samuel Godin and Samuel Blommaert sent agents of the Dutch West India Company to negotiate with the local Nanticoke tribe to purchase land on Cape Henlopen near present-day Lewes, Delaware. With the support of New Netherland's colonial leadership at New Amsterdam, a new colony named Zwaanendael was established on the purchased land in 1631 by David Pietersz de Vries. The colony proved to be very short-lived, as conflicts with the Nanticoke led to it being wiped out within a year. A second attempt at establishing a colony at that location in 1632 was soon abandoned. The division maintains a monument at the site of the original colony as well as a museum dedicated to interpreting its history. On June 20, 1632, King Charles I granted Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore a charter for land along the Chesapeake Bay. The northern boundary of the charter was the 40th parallel, and the eastern boundary was the Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. However, the charter only granted the Calverts the right to \\"uncultivated\\" lands. The colonists arrived in Maryland in 1634, but made no attempts at surveying the northern border or colonizing the area along the Delaware Bay. See section \\"History of the Boundary Dispute Between the Baltimores and Penns Resulting in the Original Mason and Dixon Line\\" by Edward Bennett Matthews The colony of New Sweden was established north of the Delaware Bay, at Fort Christina near present-day Wilmington, Delaware, in 1638. Viewing this as an incursion into their territory, the Dutch in 1651 established a new outpost, Fort Casimir at present-day New Castle, Delaware, south of Fort Christina. The Swedes conquered Fort Casimir in 1654, but Peter Stuyvesant, the Director-General of New Netherland, retaliated and in 1655, he both took back Fort Casmir and conquered Fort Christina. Stuyvesant renamed Fort Casimir as New Amstel, and placed a deputy there to oversee the entire region, reporting back to Stuyvesant at New Amsterdam. The English objected to the colonization attempts of both Sweden and the Netherlands and Maryland sent a delegate to New Amstel in 1659 protesting their presence on land granted to Lord Baltimore. However, it wasn't until 1664 when the English would formally act against their colonial rivals. That year King Charles II granted his brother James, the Duke of York, all the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers. Fort Amsterdam was captured on September 8, 1664, and Stuyvesant formally surrendered the territories of New Netherland the next day. The colonial outposts along the Delaware Bay surrendered as well soon after, and New Amstel was renamed New Castle by the English—though it was still governed by a deputy reporting to New Amsterdam, now named New York after the Duke, even though the Duke had not received a charter from the king for these lands. In 1681, William Penn was granted a charter for Pennsylvania by Charles II. This charter included the first documentary mention of the carve-out of a twelve mile circle around the town of New Castle. Lord Baltimore (now Cecil's son, Charles Calvert) did not object to the grant, as long as Penn's land was north of Maryland's northern border, the 40th parallel. In addition, James was allowed to retain the lands around New Castle that he had won through conquest, as Charles carved out a Twelve-Mile Circle around New Castle. Penn, who desired ocean access for his colony, convinced James to lease these lands to him as well, and so in August 1682, the Duke of York granted Penn the Twelve Mile Circle around New Castle as well as the lands south, to Cape Henlopen. Though James had deeded these lands to Penn, James himself did not formally receive a charter to the Delaware lands until March 22, 1683. Penn sailed to the colonies and, in May 1683, he met with Calvert in New Castle. The two men disagreed on how the boundaries should be determined, including where the southern boundary of Pennsylvania should be and how the size of the Twelve Mile Circle should be judged. This meeting marked the beginning of the long legal dispute. History of the boundary dispute Penn wanted his new colony to have access to the Chesapeake Bay, while Calvert was adamant that the 40th parallel should serve as the southernmost border of Pennsylvania and he insisted the lands on the Delaware Bay were included in the original 1632 charter for Maryland. Because the two could not agree, Penn decided to go to court. Both Penn and Calvert returned to England to participate in the case. By this time, the Duke of York had ascended to the throne as James II. Penn thought his chances in court were good, as he and James were friends and allies. He invoked the Zwaanendael Colony in making his case: the Maryland charter was only for \\"uncultivated\\" lands, but the Dutch had cultivated the area near the Delaware Bay by founding a colony that predated the charter. This argument had also been made by the Dutch themselves when Maryland protested the colony in 1659. This proved to be the decisive point. The Committee for Trade and Plantations agreed that Baltimore's charter was only for uncultivated land, and the presence of Christians in the disputed territory prior to, and after, his settlement of the region meant it could not be his. On November 7, 1685, James issued a decision which called for a compromise. He ordered that the land between the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays be divided in half, with a line west from Cape Henlopen intersecting with a line drawn south from the 40th parallel. James kept the northern border of Maryland at the 40th parallel. Calvert still did not have the border surveyed, however. In December, 1688, King James gave Penn a new and more defined charter for the Delaware holdings. On July 20, 1701, the people of the Lower Counties (now Delaware) petitioned Penn for a separate legislature and administrative officers from Pennsylvania's. Penn granted the request on August 28, and he commissioned a survey of the Twelve Mile Circle to determine the formal boundaries between Pennsylvania and the Lower Counties. Isaac Taylor of Pennsylvania and Thomas Piersons of New Castle were selected as the surveyors. They began their survey at a dyke in New Castle in September 1701, and ended their survey of the boundary arc in October. There were a number of errors in their survey. This was the first formal attempt to determine the boundaries created by the Twelve-Mile Circle, but far from the last. Charles Calvert petitioned Queen Anne in 1709 to dismiss the portions of the 1683 ruling which had granted Penn land below the 40th parallel. Penn opposed Calvert's petition, and on June 23, 1710, the queen dismissed it. After the queen's ruling, both the Pennsylvania and Delaware assemblies accepted the Taylor-Piersons boundaries. This did not resolve the issue of border disputes on the ground. There were continued instances of the Maryland government granting land to Marylanders within the Delaware borders, and clashes between sheriffs in the two territories over appropriate jurisdiction. Further, the Delaware Assembly repealed its approval of the circular boundaries just one year after approving them. Charles Calvert, the 3rd Lord Baltimore, died in 1715, and William Penn died in 1718. Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore died just two months after his father, so the boundary dispute was carried forth by Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore on Maryland's side, and by Penn's children John, Thomas, and Richard on the Pennsylvania side. The 1732 Agreement 1732 map of Maryland The discovery that the Twelve Mile Circle did not actually intersect with the 40th parallel, and that the parallel was actually north of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's major city, precipitated further disputes over the border. Each side attempted to surreptitiously conduct one-sided surveys of the borders. In 1722, Calvert complained to the Maryland Council that the Chief Justice of Cecil County had been arrested by Pennsylvania for \\"running out some lines\\" in the forest; Maryland, in turn, arrested Isaac Taylor, the surveyor who had earlier worked on the circle, for an incursion into Maryland territory. Conflicts between settlers such as Cresap's War and questions surrounding to which proprietor they owed taxes prompted both sides to desire a settlement. In 1731, Calvert petitioned King George II to force the Penns to agree to a formal demarcation of the boundaries. The matter was referred to the Committee for Trade and Plantations once more. Calvert insisted the boundary should remain the 40th parallel, while the Penns argued it should be placed 20 miles south of Philadelphia. The King and Committee convinced the two sides to come to another compromise. On May 10, 1732, Calvert and the Penns signed an Article of Agreement which reaffirmed much of the 1685 ruling, but adjusted Pennsylvania's southern boundary below the 40th parallel. The agreement stated that the peninsula would be divided by a line running west from Cape Henlopen to the middle of the peninsula, and from that middle point a line would be drawn north to a point tangent to the Twelve Mile Circle. From the tangent point, a line would be drawn along the circle until it was due north of the tangent point, at which point it would go due north again until it was intersected by an east-west line which would be placed 15 miles south of Philadelphia. The map included in the agreement, however, incorrectly labeled Fenwick Island, Delaware as Cape Henlopen. That point was 19 miles south of the actual Cape Henlopen. The cupola of the New Castle Court House was used as the center of the Twelve Mile Circle. The boundary Commissions met here numerous times over the years. The Articles of Agreement also created a new Commission to oversee the implementation of the boundary agreement and the placing of monuments to formally mark the borders. Each party appointed 7 members to the Commission, which was to be led by the governors of the two colonies. The Pennsylvania Commissioners included Governor Patrick Gordon, Isaac Norris, Samuel Preston, James Logan, and Andrew Hamilton. The Maryland Commissioners included Governor Samuel Ogle, former Governor Charles Calvert, and Benjamin Tasker, Sr.. The Commission held its first meeting in Chestertown, Maryland. They subsequently met four times at New Castle's Court House, once in Joppa, Maryland, and once in Philadelphia. The Commission could not agree on several points of contention related to the Twelve Mile Circle. First, the Maryland Commissioners insisted that a circle must have a center point and they were not empowered to determine what the center point was. Second, the Maryland Commissioners insisted the circle should have a circumference of 12 miles, while the Pennsylvania Commissioners insisted it should have a radius of 12 miles. Lord Baltimore had also discovered the mapping error that resulted in Fenwick Island being used as the southernmost boundary point in the Articles of Agreement, rather than Cape Henlopen, and he protested this. Despite being empowered to resolve the conflict, the Commissioners ultimately signed a statement saying they could not come to an accord. Following this failure, Lord Baltimore filed a new petition in the English courts, and the Penns filed a counter-petition. King George II issued a decree on May 4, 1738 barring either proprietor from making any land grants in the disputed territory, and creating temporary boundary lines. The Court of Chancery suit After filing their petitions in court, both sides and their agents began compiling witness depositions in Philadelphia, New Castle, and throughout Maryland. The petitions filed by Calvert and the Penns were finally addressed by the English Court of Chancery in 1750. After reviewing the colonial deeds, the agreements made by the various parties over the decades, and after hearing testimony from both sides, on May 15, 1750, Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, the Lord Chancellor, ruled that the Agreement of 1732 should be binding. He ordered the appointment of new Commissioners to oversee the drawing of the boundaries. He also resolved the questions that had stopped the first round of Commissioners, determining that the center of the circle would be the center of New Castle, the circle would have a 12-mile radius, and Fenwick Island (rather than Cape Henlopen) would be used as the southern boundary as agreed upon in the 1732 agreement. The decision in the case is reported under Penn v Lord Baltimore (1750) 1 Ves Sen 444, and has become an important judicial precedent in its own right, forming a judicial exception to the Moçambique rule. Professor Adrian Briggs of Oxford University has asserted that the judicial precedent is sufficiently important that there should be a similar eponymous rule referring to the case itself. The Transpeninsular Line, the southernmost disputed boundary The new Commission included William Allen, Benjamin Chew, Thomas Hopkinson, Rev. Richard Peters, Ryves Holt, and Tench Francis, Sr. from Pennsylvania and Delaware, and Benedict Calvert, Benjamin Tasker, Jr., George Plater, and Daniel Dulaney Sr. from Maryland. They held their first meeting in the Assembly Room of the New Castle Court House on November 14, 1750. The Commissioners proposed that the Court House should be considered the \\"center\\" of New Castle and so the 12 Mile Circle should be based around the cupola at the top of the building. The Commissioners then hired a survey team (consisting of John Lukens and Archibald McClean from Pennsylvania, and John Riggs and Thomas Garnett from Maryland) to map the line dividing the northern half of the peninsula from the southern half, by going from Fenwick Island west. This survey was named the Transpeninsular Line. The first Transpeninsular Monument was placed at the easternmost point. The team completed the survey by June 1751. However, the Commissioners, meeting in New Castle in October, could not agree if the westernmost point of the line should be the Chesapeake Bay or Slaughter Creek. Since the middle point could not be determined without agreement on the western point, the survey could not be completed. They also disagreed if the measurements for the Twelve Mile Circle should be taken on the ground, which would incorporate hills and valleys (thus making the circle smaller and giving more land to Calvert), or if they should be measured in a straight level (making the radius a full twelve miles and giving more land to the Penns). The Commissioners referred the issues to Lord Hardwicke. Hardwicke ruled that the western point of the Transpeninsular Line should be the Chesapeake Bay. He also approved of the use of the New Castle Court House as the center of the Twelve Mile Circle and determined that the twelve miles should be measured on a level line. Resolution In 1751, Charles Calvert died. His son, Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore, did not wish to be bound by any agreements his father had made. This froze the resolution of the boundary dispute again, and surveying efforts came to a halt. But by 1760, Calvert relented, and he entered into an agreement on July 4 which matched the 1732 agreement and the Chancellor's Decree of 1750. In November of that year, the Commissioners met in New Castle, agreed to the Transpeninsular Survey results, and placed the Middle Point marker. The southernmost boundary was finally completed. The Mason–Dixon line In 1761, the colonial surveyors made an attempt at surveying the Twelve mile circle by laying a chain in a line from the Court House's cupola, but they were unsuccessful due their tools and bad calculations. They tried again in 1763, but the line was still off. The two parties agreed to replace the colonial surveyors with a team from England. A contract between the Penns, Baltimore, and Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon was signed on July 20, 1763. Mason and Dixon arrived in Philadelphia on November 15, 1763, where they met with the boundary Commissioners. Mason and Dixon's first task was to determine the southernmost point of Philadelphia, where they built an observatory. They then proceeded 31 miles west where they set up their headquarters for the project on the Harlan Farm in Embreeville and erected a stone as a reference point. The stone is known now as the Star Gazers' Stone. After doing additional observation and surveying work, they established the east-west boundary line between Pennsylvania and Maryland. In August 1764, they ran a line from the New Castle Court House to determine the correct tangent point. From September 4–25, they surveyed the north-south line down to the Middle Point Marker. In November, Mason and Dixon met with the Commissioners in Christiana, Delaware and the Commissioners approved their results. From December 17, 1765 – January 1, 1766, they placed monument stones under the supervision of one commissioner from each colony. In 1767, they mapped the western line as far as possible before turning back. The surveyors presented their finalized boundaries to the Commissioners at Christiana in November, 1767. They departed America on September 11, 1768. Baltimore and the Penns petitioned King George III for approval of the Mason-Dixon boundaries on August 20, 1768. King George approved the boundaries on January 11, 1769—over eighty-five years after the beginning of the dispute. Both proprietary families subsequently lost their colonies in the American Revolution, just seven years later. Subsequent disputes Though the legal dispute between the Penns and the Calverts ended when the king signed off on their agreed upon boundaries, and when they later lost their proprietary rights to the colonies, there have been numerous additional legal disagreements over the borders and surveying attempts. In 1820, New Jersey disputed Delaware's right to cede Pea Patch Island to the United States government since the island was primarily on the New Jersey side of the river. Secretary of War John C. Calhoun requested a legal opinion from Attorney General William Wirt, who in turn consulted with George Read, Jr. and former Attorney General Caesar A. Rodney. The two wrote a report detailing the history of the colonial deeds and the long-running struggle between the Penns and Calverts in the courts, and stated that the colonial deeds entitled Delaware to the entirety of the Delaware River within the boundaries of the Twelve-Mile Circle. After conflicting opinions from two different circuit courts on the issue, President James K. Polk intervened in 1847 and suggested an arbitrator resolve the disagreement. John Sergeant was appointed arbitrator, and in Independence Hall heard arguments from the United States (represented by Senators John M. Clayton and James A. Bayard, Jr.) and a citizen of New Jersey (represented by former Secretary of War John Eaton and former Secretary of the Treasury George M. Bibb) regarding that same history of colonial deeds. Sergeant's ruling relied in part on Hardwicke's decision in Penn v. Baltimore. New Jersey contested the circle's borders again in 1872, when Delaware arrested several New Jersey fishermen and New Jersey claimed ownership of the Delaware River up to the middle point. The issue has been adjudicated by the United States Supreme Court several times (primarily in 1877, 1934, and 2007) in cases named New Jersey v. Delaware. The extensive history of the circle and border dispute were documented by Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo in the 1934 case, where he cited the decisions by both Lord Chancellor Hardwicke and the arbitrator Sergeant. Legal precedent As one of the earliest attempts by the courts to adjudicate boundary disputes between colonies or states in America, Penn v. Baltimore has also been relied upon as precedent for numerous other cases involving American boundary disputes, particularly Hardwicke's assertion that \\"long possession and enjoyment... is one of the best evidence of title to lands or districts of lands in America.\\" The Supreme Court cited Lord Chancellor Hardwicke's legal reasoning in State of Rhode Island v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 37 U.S. 657 (1838), Commonwealth of Virginia v. State of Tennessee, 148 U.S. 503 (1893), State of Virginia v. State of West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39 (1870), State of Missouri v. State of Illinois, 180 U.S. 208 (1900), and State of Maryland v. State of West Virginia, 217 U.S. 1 (1910), amongst others. New York Attorney General Josiah Ogden Hoffman invoked Penn v. Baltimore in the case of New York v. Connecticut, 4 U.S. 1 (1799), which was the first case heard by the Supreme Court under its original jurisdiction authority to resolve disputes between states. In the case of Hans v. Louisiana, 134 US 1 (1890), the Court noted that while some types of lawsuits were not contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, Penn v. Baltimore \\"shows that some of these unusual subjects of litigation were not unknown to the courts even in colonial times.\\" In his opinion, Hardwicke also established the legal concept that equity judgments can be made in personam. When Lord Baltimore objected to the Court's jurisdiction over foreign soil or royal colonies, Hardwicke dismissed the objection and determined that he could indeed act since he was ruling upon a contractual agreement made in England (the 1732 Agreement), and both parties to the agreement were present before the Court and subject to its powers of contempt and sequestration. The Supreme Court has cited this view in cases such as Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1878).

External economies of scale result from an increase in the productivity of an entire industry, region, or economy due to factors outside of an individual company. There are three sources of external economies of scale: input sharing , labor market pooling, and knowledge spillovers (Marshall, 1920). Localization economies occur when an increase in the size of an industry in a city leads to an increase in productivity of a particular activity.Rosenthal and Strange, 2004 Alfred Marshall (1920) introduced the idea that the localization of industry can increase productivity in his book Principles of Economics. The highly concentrated high tech industry in Silicon Valley exemplifies industrial localization.Rosenthal and Strange, 2004 Although the cost of labor and land in Silicon Valley is very high, high tech firms continue to locate there because of the added benefit they receive from their proximity to a high-skilled labor pool. The size of the high tech industry, creates positive externalities for each firm located in Silicon Valley. Urbanization economies arise when the size of the city leads to an increase in productivity. Los Angeles exemplifies urbanization economies in that it has no single dominant industry, yet continues to grow. Firms which locate in Los Angeles benefit from the common resources and large labor pool found in the city. Common resources such as roads, buildings and power supply benefit firms in cities regardless of their industry. Also, firms have better access to labor by locating in cities. The urban environment creates positive externalities that benefit several different industries. Jane Jacobs is often credited with the idea that urban diversity and a city’s size leads to agglomeration economies.

Modern organisms and cellular organization In 1976, Jiří Komárek defined the prokaryotic cyanobacteria genus Cyanothece as distinct from Synechococcus NAG 1949. Organisms in both genera share characteristics in addition to being oxygenic phototrophs. They are both unicellular, forming aggregates, but not found in mucilaginous colonies. They may have a thin mucilage layer around each cell. Both genera also divide by binary fission along an axis perpendicular to the cell's longitudinal axis. A handful of characteristics distinguish the two genera. While Synechococcus species are usually cylindrical, Cyanothece species are normally oval and longer than 3 μm., Cyanothece’s outer cell wall layer is relatively thick and contains spherical, glassy vesicles whose function has yet to be defined. Cyanothece’s nucleoids are spread loosely throughout the cell, with a net-like appearance. Instead of concentric thylakoid membranes that share a center or axis, Cyanothece’s exhibit short, wavy and radially arranged., All Cyanothece had nitrogenase activity at one time; although some strains have lost the necessary genes. During nitrogen-fixing conditions, Cyanothece creates inclusion storage bodies under the control of a circadian rhythm. Evolutionary history Between 2.5 and 3.0 billion years ago, cyanobacteria started using the energy from light to split water, releasing oxygen into the anaerobic, reducing environment. Parts of this ancient cyanobacterial metabolism are still maintained today. Bandyopadhyay et al. 2011 created a phylogenic tree for cyanobacteria using 226 homolog protein groups. They grouped five of the six major Cyanothece strains (PCC 7424, PCC 7822, ATCC 51142, PCC 8801, PCC 8802) as belonging to a single clade, but had Cyanothece sp PCC 7425 branched off earlier. PCC 7425's nitrogenase cluster is arranged differently from the other five strains and can only fix nitrogen anaerobically. Most other cyanobacteria may have lost their ability to fix nitrogen. As Earth's climate became more oxidated, the process of fixing nitrogen became unfavorable, and natural selection eliminated some of the necessary genes for the nitrogenase protein complex to increase evolutionary fitness. Photosynthesis/pigments Cyanobacteria turn energy from the sun into chemical energy through oxygenic photosynthesis. Their light-harvesting complex that captures the photons usually includes the pigments chlorophyll a and phycocyanin. A cyanobacterium's typical blue-green color is a result of the combination of these two pigments. Three Cyanothece strains, sp. PCC 7424, 7822 and 8801, have the additional pigment phycoerythrin, which expands the wavelengths of light these species use for energy. Phycoerythrin also gives these three species a brownish-green color. The rate of oxygen created by photosystem II is much higher when Cyanothece does not fix nitrogen (when the medium is nitrogen-replete). The genera's circadian rhythm controls photosynthetic oxygen generation by regulating when the proteins for their photosynthetic machinery are produced. This diurnal oscillation occurs even when the organisms are kept in the light continuously or in the dark continuously. Photosynthesis is downregulated when the nitrogen-fixing enzyme, nitrogenase, is upregulated. Decreasing the oxygen in the cell allows the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase to fix nitrogen from the air for the organism's needs. Metabolism, biosynthesis, symbiosis Cyanothece balances the production of oxygen through photosynthesis and oxygen-sensitive nitrogen fixation and fermentation all in one cell. They accomplish this by separating the two processes in time under the control of their circadian rhythm. During the day, they use the energy harnessed from photosynthesis to produce the carbohydrate glycogen, which is stored in granules. At night, the organisms break down the glycogen, providing the energy for nitrogen fixation. In a very energy-intensive process, nitrogenase is first synthesized and then takes N2 from the air, combining it with protons and electrons to produce ammonia and hydrogen gas. The organisms also store cyanophycin, a nitrogen-reserve molecule which is a polymer of arginine and asparagine, for use by the organism during the day. Different Cyanothece species metabolize nitrogen- containing compounds through a variety of pathways; all have an arginine decarboxylase, but vary after that point. To provide the anoxic environment needed by nitrogenase, Cyanothece boosts its respiration as night begins by using its glycogen stores while turning off photosynthesis. In addition, the organisms produce peroxidases and catalases which help scavenge any oxygen left in the cell. The circadian rhythm ensures that this occurs even when the organism is growing in continuous light or continuous darkness. In the dark, the cyanobacteria act as heterotrophs, getting their energy and carbon from the medium. Cyanothece has the genes for the use of a variety of sugar molecules; although glycerol is the only one that has been used successfully to grow Cyanothece in the dark. Many of the genes that are unique to the genera have homologs in anaerobic bacteria, including those responsible for formate production through mixed-acid fermentation and also fermentative lactate production. Some Cyanothece species also are capable of tryptophan degradation, methionine salvage, conversion of stored lipids into carbohydrates, alkane and higher alcohol synthesis, and phosphonate metabolism. They can switch between a photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic metabolism depending on the environmental conditions that maximize their growth, employing the pathways that use the least amount of energy. Genome size, organization, and ploidy options The genomes of many of Cyanothece species have been sequenced, ranging from 4.79 to 7.84 Mbp. Between 4367 and 6642 coding sequences are an amalgamation of genes encoding capabilities for fermentation and aerobic nitrogen fixation (like filamentous cyanobacteria). Unusually, the genes for nitrogen fixation are in a large, contiguous cluster (under the control of multiple promoters), including genes for the uptake hydrogenase, regulators, and transporters. The organism's robust circadian rhythm is apparent in the co-ordination of transcription of correlated processes. Using microarrays, about 30% of 5000 genes tested exhibited diurnal oscillations in 12-hour light/dark conditions, while 10% continued the behavior in continuous light. About 1,705 of the gene groups are >99.5% homologous with other cyanobacteria genera, largely Microcystis and filamentous, nitrogen-fixing strains. Typical GC content is about 40%. Cyanothece species also have three to six plasmids ranging between 10 and 330 kb. Unique to some species of this genus is one to three linear pieces of DNA. The linear DNA encodes enzymes for glucose and pyruvate metabolism (recall that glycerol is the only organic carbon source on which Cyanothece has grown successfully), lactate fermentation, transposons, and CRISPR proteins. Cyanothece species do not typically use homologous recombination, which greatly hinders genetic manipulation; an exception is Cyanothece sp. PCC 7822 in which gene knock-outs can be generated. Cell size, growth patterns, sex Cyanothece species are normally oval and longer than 3 μm. They double in 10 to 14 hours in the presence of nitrate, when they do not need to use energy to fix nitrogen, and 16 to 20 hours when fixing nitrogen. They divide by binary fission in one plane that is perpendicular to their longitudinal axis. Daughter cells remain joined for just a short time after division. Cell division does not proceed until the daughter cells reach their mature size and original shape. Habitat range Cyanothece has been found in a variety of environments all over the world. One point in common is that the pH is usually lower than 7. Typically they are associated with water in benthic marine environments, rice fields, acidic marshes, peaty bogs, intertidal zones, moors and clear lakes, but sometimes are found in mountain soils. Walls and resting cysts Cyanothece species have a thin mucilaginous layer around a thick outer wall that contains spherical, glassy vesicles of unknown function. They have been shown to secrete abundant Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The EPS has been used to sequester metals from industrial waste, with more than 90% of Ni2+, Cu2+, and Co2+ removed. Storage products Cyanothece stores the products of carbon fixation as glycogen granules which they use as an energy source during the \\"night\\". These granules form between the thylakoid membranes. The granules are rapidly consumed to boost respiration, so remove the oxygen from the cell at the onset of nitrogen fixation. The carboxysomes contain the carbon-fixing enzyme rubisco and a carbon-concentrating system to boost the enzyme's efficiency. The nitrogen product, cyanophycin, is stored as a granule during nitrogen fixation and is metabolized during the \\"day\\". Motility Cyanothece species are not flagellated. A twitching motility protein for sp. PCC 8802 is annotated on the protein database UniProtKB. Single-celled vs. multicelled Cyanothece species are unicellular. They can be found as free aggregates, but have never been found as a chain. Hydrogen production Biohydrogen is being investigated as a clean and renewable energy source. Two main enzymes produce hydrogen in microbes, hydrogenase and nitrogenase; Cyanothece has both enzymes. The nitrogenase fixes nitrogen, releasing hydrogen as a byproduct. The two different hydrogenase enzymes are an uptake hydrogenase associated with the nitrogenase and a bidirectional hydrogenase. When cultures are entrained in light-dark cycles, the nitrogenase and uptake hydrogenase are both active during the \\"night\\", with many copies per cell. Western blots show only a few copies of the bidirectional hydrogenase occur at any time. About 300 μmol H2/(mg Chl h) was produced by sp. ATCC 51142 from cultures that were grown in continuous light at 30 μmol photons/(m2s), anaerobic conditions, 50 mM glycerol, and without any nitrate (so the nitrogenase was active). Glycerol in the growth medium reduces the need for carbon fixation, leaving more energy for nitrogen fixation and hydrogen production. It was shown by acetylene reduction that hydrogen generation and nitrogen fixation were directly proportional. A parallel study has demonstrated concomitant and uninterrupted production of both H2 and O2 in continuously illuminated photobioreactor cultures, upon nitrogen-deprivation of ammonium-limited chemostat growth. Further work on improving the supply of protons and electrons to nitrogenase, as well as protecting it from oxygen could stimulate even better rates.

It is sometimes called the plasmablastic form of multicentric Castleman disease. It has sometimes been confused with plasmablastic lymphoma in the literature, although that is a dissimilar specific entity. It has variable CD20 expression and unmutated immunoglobulin variable region genes. Biology Castleman disease (CD) is a lymphoproliferative disorder of unknown cause. CD is associated with an increased risk of B-cell lymphoma. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has been found in some cases of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). The HHV8 can give rise to an increased number of plasmablast cells within the mantle zone of B-cell follicles. These plasmablasts express IgM-immunoglobulin light chains, most often of lambda subtype. These plasmablasts can give rise to a spectrum of abnormalities including progression to microlymphoma (microscopic clusters of plasmablast cells) or clinical lymphoma. This type of lymphoma is predominantly seen in acquired immunodeficiencies, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) but it can also occur in immunosuppression such as with organ transplantation or the elderly. The plasmablasts do not show rearranged immunoglobulin genes, and typically lack EBV infection. The disease predominantly affects lymph nodes and the spleen, a pattern dissimilar to plasmablastic lymphoma of the oral cavity of AIDS which is not associated with HHV-8 infection. Despite traditional chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone, vincristine), and the possible addition of antiviral therapy and inhibition of specific cellular targets including the use of rituximab, the prognosis in this lymphoma has been poor. This lymphoma subtype has sometimes been confused with plasmablastic lymphoma in the literature, although that is a dissimilar specific entity. Similarly, this subtype is considered distinct from other lymphomas which have a plasmablastic immunophenotype such as primary effusion lymphoma, ALK+ large B-cell lymphoma, and extracavitary HHV–8-positive lymphoma.

Known as the Dubnoff Center for Child Development and Educational Therapy, it was located in North Hollywood.  Education  Ena Dubnoff studied for a year at the University of California at Berkeley, but came back to Los Angeles area and enrolled at the University of Southern California (USC). She was the only woman in her class. According to her, many of her classmates were returning Korean War veterans. Dubnoff graduated cum laude, earning a Bachelor of Architecture in 1960. While still at USC she received the AIA Medal for Excellence in Architecture award. In 1966 Dubnoff earned a master's degree in Urban Design from Columbia University. After graduation from Columbia University she traveled widely on the William Kinne Fellows traveling fellowship (1966-1967), and spent a year in India.Ena Dubnoff, interview by Ruth Wallach, April 12, 2013.  Academic teaching  From 1963-1965 Dubnoff taught at the Department of Architecture at Pennsylvania State University] where she joined the faculty at the request of Gregory Ain who was the Chairman of the Department of Architecture there. She also taught at the Southern California Institute of Architecture, (SCI-ARC).from 1973-1976. In 1981 Dubnoff was hired as the first tenure-track female faculty in architecture at USC where she taught until 1986.  Architectural work  After graduating from USC, Dubnoff collaborated with the office of Buff, Straub and Hensman to design a residence for her parents. The residence was widely published and received several awards. It is included in the 2004 book on Buff & Hensman edited by James Steele; according to the description, it was finished in 1961. She spent two years on the office of William Pereira and Associates, working on many projects including the Master Plan for the Irvine Ranch, the Master Plan for Catalina Island, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In addition, she worked for A. Quincy Jones, and in the New York office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. After Dubnoff received her architectural license, she designed the main building for the Dubnoff School in association with former classmates who founded the firm Flores, Gelman and Greenberg in 1965. Dubnoff collaborated with Dolores Hayden forming the firm of Dubnoff and Hayden in 1984 to design Willowbrook Green, and affordable housing and Child Care project in the Willowbrook area of Los Angeles. She later formed ONE Company Architecture (later renamed Ena Dubnoff Architects) when Dolores Hayden withdrew to pursue her teaching career. Dubnoff became a founding member of the four-women collaborative named O.N.E.Company, formed in 1991 for the purpose of developing affordable housing. Later, a spin-off non-profit organization named W.O.R.K.S, Women Organizing Resources, Knowledge, and Services was formed to partner with O.N.E. Company. Ena Dubnoff's Architectural practice continued to design projects for non-profit social service agencies and for developers of housing for low-income families. Dubnoff's design work, particularly earlier in her career and as embodied in the Dubnoff Center, is considered exemplary of mid-century Modernism. In addition to her work in architecture, Dubnoff was the co-founder of Westend Printmakers studio in Santa Monica. She is currently engaged in a second career in woodturning.

John Nephew of Atlas was originally skeptical about producing a licensed game but Atlas Creative Director Jeff Tidball convinced him to give it a try; Atlas then contracted Robin Laws to write the game, and the Rune role-playing game was published in 2001. Gerritsen was later director of product development for Irrational Games.

He is one of the foremost artists from Bangladesh and a student of Zainul Abedin. He naturally drew inspiration from his own surroundings. His first duo show was held in 1961 followed by 17 solo exhibitions and 37 group exhibitions in Pakistan, Bangladesh and different countries of the world. Out of his 54 painting exhibitions, only 14 took place in Bangladesh. He received awards at the Annual Exhibition of Paintings by Karachi Artists, Arts Council, Karachi, Pakistan in 1963, 1964 and 1967. Azim died at Dhaka, when he was at the peak of his artistic career. After his death, two exhibitions of his works were held at Dhaka Club (1976) and Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (1998). The Bangladesh Government holding a world class painting of a renowned Artist as symbol of honor at Sonali Bank Branch in London, UK and one of his masterpiece in the Bangladesh National Museum. On 20 February 2012, Azim was posthumously awarded the most honorable National Award (Ekushey Padak) by the government of Bangladesh for his contribution in the field of fine arts and his involvement through his paintings during the Language Movement in 1952. Early life and education Azim born in 24 November 1934 at Bikrampur. He graduated in fine arts from Bangladesh College of Arts & Crafts (at present Faculty of Fine Arts, Dhaka University) in 1955. Azim who became an artist much against the will of his parents, once spent some months in a sweepers colony to absorb the atmosphere of the place before painting it. Unlike many other artists in the city he has chosen to avoid the corruption of commercial art by not joining any of the advertising firms and instead choosing to teach art. Azim was trying to establish an individual style of painting. He was an artist with multiple techniques. He not only used the brush and the palette knife to paint but also his finger. He was a total experimenter. He not only loved to employ different techniques but also a variety of materials on his canvases, including sand, cement, cloth, nylon net and jute. In some exhibition he had tried to used jute canvases in place of cloth canvases for few of his paintings. He daubs paint with a piece of cloth and in his remarkably successful white \\"Cobweb\\" he had tried yet another technique which was supposed to be a secret. Language Movement In 1952, Azim was involved in the Bengali Language Movement of East Pakistan. At that time, he was a second- year student at the Dhaka Art College (at present Faculty of Fine arts, University of Dhaka). Probably, Bangladeshi are the only nation in the world, who fought to protect their mother language. The exact number of death in the Language Movement and especially on the day of 21 February 1952, has never been recovered. The bodies of those killed were not given to their families. At midnight, soldiers of the Pakistan Army seized some bodies from the Morgue at Dhaka Medical College. The bodies left at the morgue were not counted then and this also included the injured people who died at the hospital later. Azim had organized a few meetings in protest of the firing on the rally on 21 February 1952. He produced many posters and paintings on the Language Movement during that period. Career Azim (2nd from right) at his exhibition in Karachi (1968) Azim worked as a teacher at the Alliance Francaise Karachi, Pakistan. He was also a lecturer at Pak-American Centre, Karachi, Pakistan and Teacher's Training College, Dhaka, Bangladesh. From the early '50s to the '60s, Azim and few painters introduced many forms of modern, abstract, abstract-impressionist and abstract-expressionist art. Their works had an enriching influence on other emerging painters as well. Azim set out as a naturist and figurative painter. In the early stages of his career, nature was the focus of his works. Along with natural elements, the colour was a predominant aspect of his works. The treatment of colour and the composition was exceptional. An interaction between use of space and objects always carried an aesthetic trademark in his works. Still, his paintings, with their unique lucid qualities, have lost none of their appeals. His canvases are marked with pigment and fluidity. He always used a limited number of elements in his canvas. Sometimes his works seem to convey the feeling of solitude. During a certain phase of his career, he focused on boats. He drew forms of boats that resembled the impression of a new moon or crescent. He strived to maintain a good balance between colour and forms. The interplay of darkness and light was another significant characteristic of his works. He continued his quest for novel and fresh elements in his paintings. He took to using oil paints in a style reminiscent of action painting — quite akin to the works of Jackson Pollock. Azim was brilliant in designs and texture. His compositions assumed an expressionistic look as red, blue and other bold colours began dominating his canvas. He produced many paintings, watercolours and sketches in the course of his short career span. Paintings Azim was a prominent figure in the art scene of Pakistan all through the 60s. He moved to Karachi in 1957. His works were exhibited widely. Out of a careful mosaic of detail, environmental and psychological, Azim constructed artistic impression of modern life. He had a passion for detail, naturalistic detail that is selective and expressive of a conscious programme. His art is an affair of impression, built up mentally through observation. His boats, burnt-out landscape, jazz musicians, city buildings are an endless procession of impression. He registered the elegance and squalor, the glamour and disenchantment, the charm and the longings of city life and country life with an impartial brush. He loved to be in the natural setting full of delicate perception and conceived in terms of the individual's surroundings. His compositions are often made on the diagonal, with a horizon line, thus creating a more shallow space and in which decorative elements of design, the play of colour and flat shape and flat colour masses can be expressed in more striking patterns. He used colour in subtle touches as a kind of compositional counterpoint to the play of line and arabesques of movement. Azim taught at an art institute in Karachi and Dhaka (1956 - 1971). However, he always kept in touch with his contemporaries in Dhaka and returned to Dhaka (1973) after the Liberation War. Personal life and death Azim was married to Momtaz Azim. Their two daughters are Humaira Azim and Sumaira Azim. Azim died on 1 November 1975 at Dhaka. He was buried at Banani Graveyard, Dhaka. Mrs Momota Azim has preserved and documented the collections of the book Mubinul Azim - Colours and Dreams (2015). This book is a collection of reports, articles and discussions on Azim and his works. This collection was published by Bengal Publications as a tribute to Azim.

Attributed to William Dering. William Dering (active between 1735 and 1751) was an American dancing master and painter active primarily in Virginia. Very little is known about his life or career; what few details have been established are known primarily from newspaper advertisements, court records, journal entries, and ledgers and from his few surviving paintings. Life Dering is first recorded as a dancing master in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 1735 to 1736. A good conversationalist, he is said to have been respected as well for his talents on the French horn; his school also offered lessons in \\"Reading, Writing, Dancing, Plain Work, Marking, Embroidery, and several other Works: where Likewise young Ladies and Gentlemen may be instructed in the French.\\" He was likely still in Philadelphia in May of the next year, when local papers advertised the loss of his horse. Dering had moved to Gloucester County, Virginia by 1737. With his wife Sarah, he was present on October 8, 1738 at the baptism of their son, also named William, at Abingdon Church. Dering is next found in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he moved in 1742 and continued as a dancing master, opening a school at the College of William and Mary \\"where all Gentlemens Sons may be taught Dancing, according to the newest French Manner, on Fridays and Saturdays once in Three Weeks\\"; he seems to have taken up portrait painting sometime in the mid-1740s. What caused the decision is unknown, although it has been suggested that the return of painter Charles Bridges to England may have served as a prompt; indeed, it has been surmised by some that Dering purchased painting supplies from Bridges prior to the latter's departure. Dering purchased a house from Henry Cary II, the Brush-Everard House, on the Palace Green, near the Governor's Palace; it survives today, preserved by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. Dering is known to have been acquainted with members of some of the more important families in Virginia society; William Byrd II, in his diaries, records many visits by the dancing master to Westover Plantation in 1740 and 1741, and in the latter year records a visit to Henry Cary II at Ampthill, at which Dering was present. The nature of the men's professional relationship is unknown, due to the cryptic nature of the diary; Byrd does mention a visit during which he showed Dering some prints, suggesting that Dering may have come to Westover in furtherance of his artistic pursuits. During another visit he is recorded as having played the French horn. Dering continued in his primary career, arranging balls and assemblies in Williamsburg at least through the spring of 1747. However, he was plagued with debts and other legal issues throughout his time in the town, and as early as 1739 is recorded as a party in numerous lawsuits from residents of Williamsburg and Gloucester and York counties. Furthermore, inventories of his heavily-mortgaged house reveal a surprisingly lavish lifestyle for a person of his profession. Dering had left Williamsburg by December, 1749, heading to Charleston, South Carolina, where he was last recorded with certainty in 1751. He had left his wife behind to settle his debts and auction off the couple's belongings; it is possible that she took in boarders as well. Documentary references to a William Dering being active in Charleston in 1764 have been found; some scholars, believing the two to be one and the same, have suggested a link between the dancing master and the earlier pastelist Henrietta Johnston (whose first marriage was to a man named Dering), who lived in that city until her death. Others believe the link to be dubious at best. Work Fewer than a dozen portraits attributed to Dering survive, suggesting that painting may have merely been a sideline and not a main source of income for him. Only one is signed, that of Mrs. Drury Stith; the others have been linked to him due to their stylistic similarity to this one. His best-known work is a full-length portrait of George Booth of Gloucester County, dating to around 1745; it is currently in the collection of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, along with a portrait of his mother, Mrs. Mordecai Booth; a portrait of Anne Byrd Carter; and the portrait of Mrs. Stith. It is recorded that Dering was possessed, in 1745, of \\"1 large hair Trunk with about 200 prints\\", and his portraits, as with many others painted in the Colonies, suggest a knowledge of pose gleaned from English prints. Most of his paintings have been described as \\"linear and flat\\", and they reveal a limited knowledge of technique.

The production was written and directed by Timothy Hines with consultation from one of Bly's modern biographers, Brooke Kroeger. The film draws from Bly's book, Ten Days in a Mad-House, which led to significant reforms in the treatment of mental health patients. The cast includes Caroline Barry, Christopher Lambert, Kelly Le Brock, Julia Chantrey and Alexandra Callas. Plot The film closely follows Bly's original account, and extracts much of the dialogue from Bly's 1880s exposé. In an interview on Los Angeles talk radio, Caroline Barry described Christopher Lambert bringing authenticity to the part of the antagonist Dr. Dent by portraying his motives as misguided good intent rather than evil, adding to the realism of the film.

Barry recounted in a 2015 interview: \\"The director said he was looking for Nellie Bly's smile and that optimistic spirit, and he felt my audition was the one that really had that smile and the brightness and optimism.\\" Principal photography took place in Salem, Oregon, a location known for another film that shed light on injustices in the mental health world, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The physical location was an abandoned mental institution with no electricity, which meant the actors had to perform in 10 degree temperatures, which Barry suggests added to the depth of the film's performances. Other elements of the film were filmed later on sound stages in Los Angeles with additional cast members Christopher Lambert and Kelly Le Brock. When Kelly Le Brock was cast in the production, she had 12 hours to prepare for her role. To accomplish this, she drew from her experiences dealing with mental illness of her past stalkers, as well as previous roles as a nurse. Release The film was shown May 5, 2015, Bly's 151st birthday, on the opening day of the Bentonville Film Festival (Arkansas), an event founded by actress/activist Geena Davis to highlight women and minorities in the media. The film was released in theatres on . Box office In its opening week the film was domestic box office flop grossing only $12,165 against a reported $12 million production budget. Its final domestic box office receipts totaled $14,616.https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id;=10daysinamadhouse.htm The film has since been released in European and Middle Eastern Markets.http://www.lighthouse-film.com/video/10-days-in-a-madhouse/ Reception A reviewer in Ms. wrote: \\"I can honestly say this movie is a must-see. Nellie Bly's heroism and courage truly come to life on the screen, thanks to the work of talented up-and-coming actor Caroline Barry. Barry is instantly magnetic as Bly, and it's hard not to root for and fall in love with her character as the story progresses.\\" The review ascribed the film's shortcomings as forgivable due to its relatively low budget: \\"And I can hardly blame Hines for the lack of funds to create a slicker product. The problem lies not with him, but with Hollywood.\\" Paste wrote: \\"Bly's life is an intrinsically compelling one, and the failure of 10 Days in a Madhouse is that it never once lives up to the indelible nature of the life it portrays.\\" The review cited the film's \\"B-movie camp\\" and its \\"one-dimensional characters, awkward, hammy acting and clumsy dialogue.\\" See also * Mental illness in film References External links  Category:Films shot in Oregon Category:Culture of Salem, Oregon Category:Biographical films about journalists Category:2010s biographical films Category:American biographical films Category:American films ","title":"10 Days in a Madhouse"},{"id":"46182947","text":"Aulacophora analis is a species of leaf beetle in the genus Aulacophora.

In 1775, William Watts, a plumber, started converting his house, near St Mary Redcliffe Church, into the world's first shot tower, in order to make lead shot by his innovative tower process. He did this by adding a tower atop his house, and by excavating a shaft into the soft sandstone below, achieving a total drop of around .

Signs and symptoms Superior vena cava syndrome occurs in 30–50%, and pleural or pericardial effusions occur in about one-third. Pathophysiology PMLBCL arises from a putative thymic peripheral B cell. It has several distinctive biological features. Molecular analysis shows that PMLBCL is distinct from other types of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). MAL gene expression is seen in 70%, unlike other diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Gene expression profiling shows considerable variance from other DLBCLs and similarity to Hodgkin disease. PMLBCL is CD20 positive, expresses pan-B markers including CD79a, and has clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and mRNA but paradoxically does not express cytoplasmic or cell surface immunoglobulin. Clinically, PMLBCL is unusual in several respects. Despite 80% PMLBCL being stage I or II, the presenting anterior mediastinal mass is often over 10 cm and is locally invasive of lung, chest wall, pleura, and pericardium. At initial presentation, PMLBCL is usually confined to mediastinum, but its bulk, rather than additional adenopathy, can sometimes be palpated at the low neck. Increased LDH is seen in approximately 75%, but unlike other large cell lymphomas, no increase in beta-2 microglobulin is seen even when bulky which may relate to defective major histocompatibility complex expression. Treatment Multiagent chemotherapy is recommended, but the preferred regimen is controversial, as is consolidative radiotherapy.http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/nhl.pdf Epidemiology It affects primarily young adults; the median age is 37 years.

With the vertex ordering shown, the partition of the edges into two subsets looping around the left and right sides of the drawing is a 2-queue layout of this graph. In mathematics, the queue number of a graph is a graph invariant defined analogously to stack number (book thickness) using first-in first-out (queue) orderings in place of last-in first-out (stack) orderings. Definition A queue layout of a given graph is defined by a total ordering of the vertices of the graph together with a partition of the edges into a number of \\"queues\\". The set of edges in each queue is required to avoid edges that are properly nested: if ab and cd are two edges in the same queue, then it should not be possible to have in the vertex ordering. The queue number qn(G) of a graph G is the minimum number of queues in a queue layout.. Equivalently, from a queue layout, one could process the edges in a single queue using a queue data structure, by considering the vertices in their given ordering, and when reaching a vertex, dequeueing all edges for which it is the second endpoint followed by enqueueing all edges for which it is the first endpoint. The nesting condition ensures that, when a vertex is reached, all of the edges for which it is the second endpoint are ready to be dequeued. Another equivalent definition of queue layouts involves embeddings of the given graph onto a cylinder, with the vertices placed on a line in the cylinder and with each edge wrapping once around the cylinder. Edges that are assigned to the same queue are not allowed to cross each other, but crossings are allowed between edges that belong to different queues.. Queue layouts were defined by , by analogy to previous work on book embeddings of graphs, which can be defined in the same way using stacks in place of queues. As they observed, these layouts are also related to earlier work on sorting permutations using systems of parallel queues, and may be motivated by applications in VLSI design and in communications management for distributed algorithms. Graph classes with bounded queue number Every tree has queue number 1, with a vertex ordering given by a breadth-first traversal., Proposition 4.1. Pseudoforests and grid graphs also have queue number 1., Propositions 4.2 and 4.3. Outerplanar graphs have queue number at most 2; the 3-sun graph (a triangle with each of its edges replaced by a triangle) is an example of an outerplanar graph whose queue number is exactly 2.; . Series- parallel graphs have queue number at most 3.. Binary de Bruijn graphs have queue number 2., Proposition 4.6. The d-dimensional hypercube graph has queue number at most d-\\\\lfloor\\\\log_2 d\\\\rfloor. The queue numbers of complete graphs Kn and complete bipartite graphs Ka,b are known exactly: they are \\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor and \\\\min{\\\\lceil a/2\\\\rceil,\\\\lceil b/2\\\\rceil} respectively., Propositions 4.7 and 4.8. Every 1-queue graph is a planar graph, with an \\"arched leveled\\" planar embedding in which the vertices are placed on parallel lines (levels) and each edge either connects vertices on two consecutive levels or forms an arch that connects two vertices on the same level by looping around all previous levels. Conversely, every arched leveled planar graph has a 1-queue layout., Theorem 3.2. In 1992, conjectured that every planar graph has bounded queue number. This conjecture was resolved positively in 2019 by who showed that planar graphs and, more generally, every proper minor-closed class of graphs has bounded queue number. Using a variation of queue number called the strong queue number, the queue number of a graph product can be bounded by a function of the queue numbers and strong queue numbers of the factors in the product.. Related invariants Graphs with low queue number are sparse graphs: 1-queue graphs with n vertices have at most 2n − 3 edges,, Theorem 3.6 and more generally graphs with queue number q have at most edges.. This implies that these graphs also have small chromatic number: in particular 1-queue graphs are 3-colorable, and graphs with queue number q may need at least and at most 4q colors. In the other direction, a bound on the number of edges implies a much weaker bound on the queue number: graphs with n vertices and m edges have queue number at most O().. A polynomial-time algorithm for finding a layout with close to this many queues is given by . improved the constant factor in this bound to e, where e is the base of the natural logarithm. This bound is close to tight, because for random d-regular graphs the queue number is, with high probability, :\\\\Omega\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{dn}}{n^{1/d}}\\\\right).; . Graphs with queue number 1 have book thickness at most 2. For any fixed vertex ordering, the product of the book thickness and queue numbers for that ordering is at least as large as the cutwidth of the graph divided by its maximum degree.. The book thickness may be much larger than the queue number: ternary Hamming graphs have logarithmic queue number but polynomially-large book thickness. It remains unknown whether the book thickness can be bounded by any function of the queue number. conjectured that the queue number is at most a linear function of the book thickness, but no functional bound in this direction is known either. It is known that, if all bipartite graphs with 3-page book embeddings have bounded queue number, then all graphs with bounded book thickness have bounded queue number.. asked whether the queue number of a graph could be bounded as a function of its treewidth, and cited an unpublished Ph.D. dissertation of S. V. Pemmaraju as providing evidence that the answer was no: planar 3-trees appeared from this evidence to have unbounded queue number. However, the queue number was subsequently shown to be bounded by a (doubly exponential) function of the treewidth.; . See for a weaker preliminary result, bounding the queue number by the pathwidth or by a combination of treewidth and degree. Computational complexity It is NP-complete to determine the queue number of a given graph, or even to test whether this number is one., Corollary 3.9. However, if the vertex ordering of a queue layout is given as part of the input, then the optimal number of queues for the layout equals the maximum number of edges in a k-rainbow, a set of k edges each two of which form a nested pair. A partition of edges into queues can be performed by assigning an edge e that is the outer edge of an i-rainbow (and of no larger rainbow) to the ith queue. It is possible to construct an optimal layout in time , where n denotes the number of vertices of the input graph and m denotes the number of edges., Theorem 2.3. Graphs of bounded queue number also have bounded expansion, meaning that their shallow minors are sparse graphs with a ratio of edges to vertices (or equivalently degeneracy or arboricity) that is bounded by a function of the queue number and the depth of the minor. As a consequence, several algorithmic problems including subgraph isomorphism for pattern graphs of bounded size have linear time algorithms for these graphs.; , pp. 321–327. More generally, because of their bounded expansion, it is possible to check whether any sentence in the first-order logic of graphs is valid for a given graph of bounded queue number, in linear time., Theorem 18.2, p. 401. Application in graph drawing Although queue layouts do not necessarily produce good two-dimensional graph drawings, they have been used for three-dimensional graph drawing. In particular, a graph class X has bounded queue number if and only if for every n-vertex graph G in X, it is possible to place the vertices of G in a three-dimensional grid of dimensions so that no two edges (when drawn straight) cross each other.; ; . See for tighter bounds on the grid dimensions for graphs of small queue number. Thus, for instance, de Bruijn graphs, graphs of bounded treewidth, planar graphs, and proper minor-closed graph families have three-dimensional embeddings of linear volume. .

Roanoke was settled in the 1830s, but became a major agricultural trading center in East Alabama following the Civil War. The Central of Georgia Railway extended its line to the town in 1887, soon followed by the Atlanta, Birmingham and Atlantic Railway, and a large cotton warehouse was founded the same year. The commercial district began growing from this time, mostly with one-story brick structures, some of which carry influences from Romanesque Revival, Italianate, and Beaux-Arts details. The W. A. Handley Company built a textile mill in Roanoke in 1901, which would remain the major employer in the town until its closing in the early 1980s. The district consists of 68 contributing properties, covering about 18 acres (7 ha) around the intersection of six streets at the town's center. Although most buildings are one story, notable multi-story buildings include the two-story Bank Building, built in Beaux-Arts style around 1909 in a wedge-shaped lot in the center of the district, and the three-story First National Bank building, built in 1920 in Neoclassical style. Also notable are the Romanesque Old City Hall (1890), the Victorian Gothic First Baptist Church (1901), and the Art Moderne City Hall (1935).

It was built in 1901 by W Anthony. It is also known as St Mark's Anglican Church. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 March 2001.  History  Information board, 2006 Cemetery with Old St Mark's Anglican Church in the background, 2006 The present day St Mark's Anglican Church, 2006 The Winnetts Road property on which St Mark's Anglican church is sited was donated in 1880 by the Gommersall family for use as a community burial ground. Mrs and Mrs Gommersall were the first to be buried in the cemetery and their graves are dated 1883. On Friday 9 March 1900, a committee formed by local families met in the local school building to plan for the building of a church in Slacks Creek and it was agreed to build the church within the site originally set aside for burials. At its meeting on 10 September 1900, the committee decided to call tenders for a church of plain weatherboard, , also a porch to same, which was to accommodate 24 worshippers. Only one tender for a church at Slacks Creek was submitted, and builder W Anthony's price of eight-five pounds and ten shillings was accepted in January 1901. The church of St Mark was dedicated on 21 April 1901 by Bishop William Webber. Later additions to the original building include a vestry added at the north-eastern end and the lining of the ceiling and walls internal walls. Surrounding the church, the cemetery contains the graves of several of the original parish council members who were instrumental in the planning and construction of old St Mark's. The 1901 parish council included Thomas White, Thomas Usher, Robert Gommersall, Frederick Armstrong and William Winnett. The Winnett family graves are located in close proximity to the rear of the church. There are also other well known local families and settlers in the cemetery such as the Ushers, Murrays, Morrows and Shailers. In 1977 when St Marks, Slacks Creek was formed as a separate parish the rectory was built at No 4 Boronia Avenue. By 1978 the church could no longer accommodate the growth in population and from that time services were held in the rectory garage until the second church was built adjacent to the original church. The 1901 church was converted for use as a hall by the parish and the community. To celebrate the church's centenary in conjunction with the Centenary of Federation celebrations, the church was recommissioned on 30 March 2001. As part of this celebration, the church was restored, its early furniture and fittings returned and disabled access provided.  Description  St Mark's Anglican Church is located on a south-west facing slope on overlooking Winnetts Road at Slacks Creek. Located in the grounds of an earlier cemetery, the church is a simple timber building with a steeply pitched painted roof of corrugated iron. It is lowset on concrete stumps and is clad with painted weatherboards. The gabled roof porch at its south-western end has a valance of simple detailing, the vestry is attached at the north-eastern end of the building and has a skillion roof. The roof space is ventilated with timber louvred vents at each end. The original porch roof that extended over a narrow landing and stairs survives but the flooring has been replaced. The recently constructed landing and disabled access ramp replace a later set of stairs and landing. The walls of the interior of the nave are lined vertically with silky oak v-jointed tongue and groove boards and the boards to the ceiling are laid along its length. From the wall the ceiling follows the line of the rafters, then the pitch is reduced up to a central section of flat ceiling. A pair of iron tie rods provide structural stability. All of the joinery is of silky oak and includes a belt rail, pair of doors and six lancet shaped windows, three to each side wall with a nine pane central pivoting sash beneath a fixed sash of six. panes. The whole of the interior of the nave is unpainted and is clear finished. The vestry is unlined and unpainted. Whilst the church is orientated so that it faces the road, the graves within the cemetery are orientated east west with headstones facing east up the hill and away from the church. There are 32 marked graves and 20 unmarked graves with 2 reserved and 15 vacant plots.  Heritage listing  Old St Mark's Anglican Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 March 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Mark's Anglican Church and its cemetery, an early community burial ground donated by a local resident, is a strong focus of the community of Logan City and provides evidence of the efforts of the early pioneers within the locality and the development of the Anglican Church within it. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The siting of St Mark's church within a graveyard is of particular interest as it provides evidence of an uncommon aspect of our cultural heritage. This practice has a long history and is one which has been largely discontinued. The collection of memorials and gravestones in the graveyard at St Mark's Anglican Church records unique documentary information that is of interest to historians, genealogists and relatives of the deceased providing evidence of early settlers and those closely associated with the founding of the church in the local area. Through its unpainted interior linings and its retention of early fixtures and fittings, St Mark's Anglican Church also demonstrates an uncommon example of an intact interior in a timber church. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. St Mark's Anglican Church and its cemetery, an early community burial ground donated by a local resident, is a strong focus of the community of Logan City and provides evidence of the efforts of the early pioneers within the locality and the development of the Anglican Church within it.

It was built on a block that is only 325 yards away from the Cathedral of Saint James on a lot that once belonged to the family of famous chronicler Bernal Díaz del Castillo and had three monastery wings and a church. There were only a maximum of 13 Jesuit priest at any given time in the building, but they also hosted Jesuit brothers and secular students. In the building was the San Lucas School of the Society of Jesus, until the Jesuits were expelled from the Spanish colonies in 1767.  History   Arrival of the Society of Jesus to Guatemala  Society of Jesus church ruins in 1880. In the second half of the 16th Century, the prestige of the Society of Jesus was extraordinary all over Europe, and the Capitanía General of Guatemala requested a group of Jesuits on August 9, 1561. The first petition was denied by King Felipe II as he needed the order member to remain in Spain to lead the Counter Reform efforts. Five years later, however, Felipe II himself asked for twenty four Jesuit priest to be sent to the Americas, but due to several issues this could not be done. In 1580, on his way back from a visit to Peruvian schools, Master Priest Juan de la Plaza stopped by Guatemala and make several petitions to the criollo City Hall such that by 1607 the first Jesuits arrived to Santiago de los Caballeros de Goathemala. At that time, there were several magnificent buildings already in the city - the Cathedral of Saint James, the Royal Palace and the Noble City Hall-; besides, several regular orders had started their complexes as well. Initially, the Jesuits stayed at Lucas Hurtado house. Given that education was the primary goal of the Society, the Jesuits made an effort to open a school; the San Lucas School opened on October 18, 1607. Saint Luke was well respected by the Society of Jesus and therefore the school was named after him.  Church construction  Thanks to the generous donation from Chavarri, the Jesuits bought two lots on the east side of the place. On this side, where eventually the entrance to the church would be built, began the construction of the second church. In August 1655, the Society finally bought the whole lot from the Díaz del Castillo; by then, San Lucas School was well known in the region and it even granted two university degrees before the Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo was authorized by the King and Pope. In 1653, the San Lucas School had a staff of only thirteen priests, a very small number compared to the size of the building; the Jesuits, however, made a major impact on the cultural and educational life in the Capitanía General of Guatemala. The school was the city's most prestigious and from it graduated most of the elite members of society of the time. Most of its students were secular and went on to get the best positions in the country after graduating from the Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos. By 1690, José de Porres began construction of the second church. The actual construction process lasted eight year and was made possible thanks to generous donations from parishioners; Porres' son, Diego, worked in this project as an apprentice and learned the trade so well, that he eventually became the city master builder. The new church was dedicated on October 21, 1698 which at the time was considered one of the most beautiful across the Spanish America.  San Miguel and San Casimiro earthquakes  Ruins of the school yard in 1880. Ruins of the church interior in 1880. On September 29, 1717, the San Miguel earthquake struck the city and destroyed the San Lucas School building; the tremor cracked the tower and destroyed the top part of the main gate. The master builder of Santiago de Guatemala, Diego de Porres, inspected the damage and calculated that it was necessary to invest between five and six thousand pesos to repair it. Three years later, however, the Jesuits had rebuilt the structure, and when the master builder returned to inspect the building, declared it better and prettier than the original. However, on March 4, 1751, the San Casimiro earthquake destroyed the church roof forcing the Jesuits to once again ask for help to the parishioners to rebuild; once again, the building was among the most beautiful of the city when the repairs were completed. A prosperity period began after the San Casimiro earthquake, as the city saw major improvements, such as street embellishment and tap water system introduction. A new City Hall was built in and on July 17, 1753 work on the Jesuit plaza in front of the church was finished.  Bourbon Reforms and expulsion of the Society of Jesus  In 1765 the Spanish King decreed the Bourbon Reforms, which tried to recover the power of the King over the Spanish colonies and increase tax collection for the Crown. Besides administrative redistributions, the Spanish King set a policy aimed to decrease the power of the Catholic Church, which until that moment in time it was absolute over the Spaniards. This policy of diminished church power was based on the Illustration and had six main points: y tenía seis puntos principales: # Decline of the Jesuit cultural legacy # Trend towards a secular culture # Cartesianism # Paying more value to natural science over religious dogma # A severe criticism to the church role within the society. # Royalism The \\"Casa de Ejercicios\\" -\\"House of Spiritual Exercises\\"-, next to the San Lucas School was finished in 1767, but on April 2 of that year king Carlos III signed the Pragmatic Sanction by which he ordered the Society of Jesus to be expelled from all of his kingdom domains. The order members in Guatemala were gathered, their properties confiscated and taken away from San Lucas school in the early hours of July 1, 1767 and then they were sent to the Gulf of Honduras, where there was a ship waiting for them to be taken abroad. The San Lucas school building was closed y the San Borja one was given to another regular order. The properties of the Jesuits were auctioned by a royal commission that took care of temporary real state. By May 22, 1770 it was decided to use the Jesuits properties as seminaries, missions, inns, schools and hospitals.  Santa Marta earthquake  The terrible Santa Marta earthquake, which destroyed the city on June 29, 1773, practically demolished the church and sections of the convent. Its cloisters and towers were in ruins, the walls were at dangerous angles and the \\"Casa de Ejercicios\\" was turned into rubble. By a Royal decree of July 21, 1775, the city move to the \\"Virgin valley\\" was authorized. This was a final order that had to be obeyed by all the people, who started to move slowly, starting on December of that year. In order to build the new city it was necessary to get construction material from the old abandoned churches in Santiago de Guatemala. However, in the case of the Society of Jesus church, there was strong opposition from the neighbors to any possible dismantling of the structure since they considered that it could still be repaired.  After the capital moved to La Ermita  Society of Jesus monastery ruins in 1900. Society of Jesus church interior ruins in 1900. After the independence of Guatemala from Spain in 1821, the Jesuit complex became public property once again and was in several lawsuits that lasted until 1829, when the regular clergy and the conservative Aycinena clan were expelled from Central America after the invasion of liberal general Francisco Morazán and the establishment of a secular government. The new liberal government decreed that all the confiscated Catholic church possessions had to be turned into elementary schools and university classrooms. In 1843, conservative president Rafael Carrera authorized the Society of Jesus to return to Guatemala advised by priest and high rank conservative Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol; however, due to the constant wars against liberal regimes in Central America, the return of the Jesuits could not materialize until 1851, after Carrera was solidly in power. They were given the Trentin School in Guatemala City, but it is not known in they tried to recover their properties in Antigua Guatemala. By 1865, the building was functioning as a vapor activated thread mill, but it was not profitable due to a lack of expert technicians and raw material; and by 1872, the Jesuits were once again expelled from Guatemala by the liberal regime of Justo Rufino Barrios. In 1884 City Hall made an announcement that it intended to transform the old Society of Jesus buildings into a market, in spite of the strong opposition from the neighbors that already had small shops on the plaza. It was until 1912 that a market was placed in the complex. In 1979 it was included among the monuments that were declared \\"Patrimony of Humanity\\" by UNESCO.UNESCO/CLT/WHC  Restoration  Exterior of the old school in 2010, after its restoration following the earthquakes of 1717 thru 1976. Later on, it hosted a Guatemalan handcraft product market until 1992, when the International Cooperation Agency for Development from Spain committed to restore the school building in exchange of being able to use it to create an international educational center, with the blessing of the National Council for Antigua Guatemala Protection.

Career With money he saved from washing dishes and working as a waiter, Lazari studied fashion design in London and set up the Drendie Girl clothing label, which successfully sold in London's high-street retailers. In 1978, using the profits from his fashion business, he moved into property. \\"My father was a builder and I was taught the value of real estate from a very early age.\\" In 2002, it was reported that Lazari owned commercial and residential property in London's Mayfair and Baker Street, as well as along Tottenham Court Road. His company Lazari Investments owned 2.5 million sq ft (230,000 m2) of London property as of 2015, most of which were offices. Six estates formed 92% of the property portfolio, all in the prime West End of London with a seventh property in north London. The most recent acquisition was the Brunswick Centre, purchased for £135 million in 2014, bringing 45 retail shops, a cinema and 408 flats. In 2012 Lazari stated, \\"In my early twenties I began investing in small properties to secure my young family’s financial position with money I earned from my involvement in the fashion business.\\" In May 2014, The Sunday Times estimated his net worth at £1.104 billion. Personal life Lazari and his wife Maritsa had three children and lived in Hampstead, London. His wife Maritza is listed as a co- founder of Lazari Investments, and their three children, Len, Nicholas and Andrie are all directors. The two sons have economics degrees, and Andrie has a property law background. The president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, is a former schoolmate and a close friend. In 2014, Lazari said that if Anastasiades ever needed to use a private jet, then he would pay for it. Lazari died on 27 July 2015 at his home in north London of a heart attack.

Blair Hedges) is Laura H. Carnell Professor of Science and director of the Center for Biodiversity at Temple University where he researches the tree of life and leads conservation efforts in Haiti and elsewhere. He co-founded Haiti National Trust. Career Hedges has a Bachelor of Science undergraduate degree from George Mason University, and a Masters and Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Maryland. Before he joined Temple University in 2014, he was a professor at Penn State. He is also a founding member of the NASA Astrobiology Center. He has published over 296 peer-reviewed works including 10 books and monographs. He was elected as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2009 for \\"revealing connections between biological evolution and Earth history in diverse groups of organisms\\", and was awarded the 2011 Penn State Faculty Scholar Medal for Outstanding Achievement in the Life and Health Sciences. Research Hedges has studied the relationships and timing of major groups in the tree of life using genomic data. This research has led to a number of discoveries including an early origin for the orders of placental mammals and modern birds, estimates of when prokaryotes and eukaryotes first colonized land and its relevance for the planet, and the phylogenetic relationships of reptiles and insectivorous mammals. He has coined the word timetree for a phylogenetic tree scaled to time, co-founded the TimeTree database for exploring the time-scale of the tree of life, and co-edited the book Timetree of Life. Hedges and his team produced a spiral tree of life in 2015 to visualize the relationships over time of 50,000 species, and discovered that diversification and speciation are both relatively constant through time and among groups. Hedges also has a field program in the Caribbean where he has studied the evolution and biogeography of amphibians and reptiles with genetic data and maintained a database of information on these species, CaribHerp. He discovered many new species in his work and has so far named 129 species of reptiles, amphibians, and butterflies. He also described three of the smallest species of reptiles and amphibians, including the Monte Iberia dwarf frog (Eleutherodactylus iberia)https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/03/science/under-cuban-ferns-a-very- small-frog.html, Jaragua gecko (Sphaerodactylus ariasae), and the Barbados threadsnake (Tetracheilostoma carlae). Eleven articles in the New York Times have described his research http://www.hedgeslab.org/pubs_nytnews.php?pubs=nytnews Conservation Work by Hedges and his team in Haiti has defined hot spots of biodiversity leading to the establishment of three national parks in Haiti. He also initiated a captive breeding program to conserve ten endangered species of frog at the Philadelphia Zoo. Together with Haitian CEO Philippe Bayard, he founded Haiti National Trust, an environmental protection NGO. Personal life Hedges is interested in Renaissance art, which led him to conduct several scientific studies of early artwork, including the development of a method for dating old prints and a study on the historical biogeography of beetles based on the holes they bored in old books.

He is the first documented painter known to have worked in Virginia. Life and career Governor's Palace in Williamsburg Bridges was christened in the parish of Barton Seagrave in Northamptonshire, and was the son of John Bridges and Elizabeth Trumbull Bridges. His family was of the gentry, and was well- educated; a brother, John Bridges, was a barrister and well-regarded historian of Northamptonshire. He married Alice Flower on August 4, 1687, at Saint Marylebone, near London; the couple had at least three children, a son and two daughters. Bridges was a member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, having worked for the organization in London from 1699 to 1713 and serving for a time as a liaison to local charity schools. Just when Bridges became a painter is unknown, though it is assumed that he had some training. Only one portrait is firmly documented dating to before his sojourn in Virginia; it depicts Thomas Baker, a fellow of Saint John's College, University of Cambridge, and was painted sometime after 1717. It is today in the collection of the University of Oxford. Bridges contemplated moving to Georgia in 1733; he is likely to have been a widower by that point, as men of his age seldom considered emigrating to the colonies. Nevertheless, he came to Virginia with his children, arriving in Williamsburg in 1735 armed with letters of introduction to James Blair and lieutenant governor William Gooch. Soon he met William Byrd II, with whom he lived for a period at Westover Plantation while painting the Byrd children; family tradition states that Byrd met Bridges in England, in the studio of Sir Godfrey Kneller, but this has not been substantiated. Byrd wrote on his behalf to Alexander Spotswood, describing him as \\"a man of a good family,\\" who was forced \\"either by the frowns of fortune, or his own mismanagement,\\" to work as a painter; the planter further commented that Bridges, though he might \\"have not the Masterly Hand of a Lilly, or a Kneller, yet had he lived so long ago as when places were given to the most Deserving, he might have pretended to be the Sergeant- Painter of Virginia.\\" With Blair and Edmund Gibson (who with Thomas Gooch had provided one of his letters of introduction to the colony), Bridges discussed the possibility of establishing a charity to teach Christianity to Virginia's African-American community. The endeavor came to nothing, likely because Christianity was associated in the minds of many local planters with the notion of freedom, and because Blair and Bridges lacked the energy necessary to see the project through. Bridges remained friendly with Byrd, being mentioned in his diaries as a visitor to Westover twice, in August 1739 and January 1740. He was one of the witnesses to the will of Sir John Randolph in 1735. One of his daughters died in Williamsburg on August 24, 1736; that December, he rented a house in town for the duration of a year. He then moved to Hanover County, where he stayed until returning to England, sometime around 1744. He died in his native Northamptonshire, and is buried in the church of Warkton. Descendants of the painter have been traced in the United States. It has been suggested that Bridges' decision to return to England may have served as a prompt for William Dering to begin portrait painting, and some historians have surmised that Dering purchased painting supplies from Bridges prior to the latter's departure. Work James Blair, c. 1735–43, oil on canvas, in the collection of the College of William and Mary Only a handful of portraits by Bridges are documented with certainty, including a number mentioned by Byrd in his letter to Spotswood, one of William Gooch, and one of Mrs. Mann Page II and Child today owned by the College of William and Mary. Based on these known paintings, a body of work has been developed; there are, however, numerous uncertainties of attribution. Bridges did not sign his work, and other documentation is lacking; this, coupled with the uneven condition of surviving paintings, precludes certain identification of many pieces. Further complicating the problem is the lack of a significant number of works from England to provide stylistic evidence; there are also indications that another painter, hitherto unidentified but stylistically similar, was active in the colony in the 1720s. Bridges' style can be identified by a variety of mannerisms of technique and color. He used broad brushstrokes in the delineation of faces, hair, and fabrics. Features, especially eyes, were drawn carefully and precisely. Colors are usually muted, and red is often used to define shadows. The composition of many portraits is similar, with the heads and figures turned slightly to one side and the subjects looking directly out at the viewer. Besides the aforementioned works, portraits attributed to Bridges on the basis of style include William Prentis, Augustine Moore, Mrs. Augustine Moore and Child, Mann Page II, and John Bolling, Jr. Also attributed to him is the portrait of James Blair hanging in the Wren Building at the College of William and Mary. Paintings attributed to Bridges may also be found in the collections of Washington and Lee University, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, and the Virginia Historical Society. A painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, formerly attributed to him and said to have been a portrait of Maria Taylor Byrd, has since been reassigned to the \\"school of Sir Godfrey Kneller\\". As is the case with many colonial painters, Bridges is known to have done non-portrait work as well, having been recorded in 1740 as being paid by Caroline County for \\"drawing the King's Arms for the use of the County Court\\", an act for which the county was required to sell 1600 pounds of tobacco. The portrait of James Blair is also notable for containing, in its background, one of the earliest depictions of the Wren Building.

She is considered the most famous Tajik ballet dancer. In 1969, she won a gold medal in an international ballet dance competition.  Early life  Sobirova was born in 1942 in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. Her father Ibragim Sabiroo was a musician and her mother Madina Sabirova was a nurse. As a young girl of 8 she was very stubborn and refused to be cowed down to a marriage as per the then prevalent practice, but she pursued her talent in dance. She took her dancing course from Leningrad Choreography Academy, the Vaganova Ballet School, from where she graduated in 1961. It was a tradition among the students of this ballet school to consider themselves incomplete till they performed the Swan dance. She was also keen to learn the complete music of the ballet.  Career  In 1961, after graduating she returned to Dushanbe and joined Onegin Theatre. She also joined People's Artist of the USSR and regularly performed at Tchaikovsky Hall. She was proficient in all classical forms of ballet and won several international awards. As a solo ballet dancer her repertoire included all the classical forms, and performed in ballets like the Leili i Medzhnun (Leili and Medjnun) for which music score was provided by Balasan-ian. She was a popular ballet dancer in the Soviet Union. She was the most popular dancer of the Opera and Ballet theater which was established in 1940.

He was the son of theologian Friedrich Heinrich Ranke (1798-1876) and the brother of anthropologist Johannes Ranke (1836-1916). Famed historian Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886) was his uncle.  Biography  Ranke studied at the Universities of Berlin, Leipzig, Erlangen, and Tübingen. At Erlangen, he was a student of the chemist Eugen von Gorup-Besánez, and at Berlin, he was an assistant to physiologist Johannes Peter Müller (1849–50). In 1851 he obtained his doctorate with a dissertation involving physiological-chemical studies on the behaviour of some organic substances in humans.Plett - Schmidseder by K. G. Saur Verlag GmbH & Company, Walter De Gruyter Incorporatedtranslated biography at Pagel: Biographies excellent doctors of the nineteenth century. Berlin, Vienna 1901 Sp. 1344-1345. From 1853 to 1858, he was associated with the German Hospital in London, during which time, he also served as a civilian physician in the service of the British government in Smyrna and in the Crimea (1855–56). In 1859 he received his habilitation at the University of Munich, becoming an honorary professor in 1863. In 1866 he was appointed director of the children's polyclinic at the Reisingerianum in Munich. Here he worked together with Max Sandreczky who became his assistant, and probably influenced Sandreczky's decision to dedicate his career to the care of children. In 1874 Ranke became an associate professor, and in 1886, was named as director of Hauner's Kinderspital at the university.Ranke at Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB).

The depot was built in 1907 along with the Atlanta, Birmingham, and Atlantic Railroad line as part of an expansion from West Point, Georgia, to Talladega, Alabama. The Callaway Corporation, who operated numerous textile mills along the Chattahoochee River and later founded Callaway Gardens, purchased the land that would later become the town of Wadley, intending to build a mill in the town. The deal fell through before the mill was built, but the town continued as a local agricultural trading hub. The station closed to passenger traffic in 1964, and the line eventually came under the control of CSX Transportation. The depot is one of only four surviving Mission Revival train stations in Alabama (the others being the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Passenger Terminal in Mobile; the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Depot in Cullman; and the Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railroad Depot in the Bridgeport Historic District in Bridgeport). The one-story depot has a clay tile hipped roof, with partially exposed rafter ends and large, bracketed overhangs. The south façade has an arched central opening with a double-leaf door flanked by leaded glass sidelights and topped with an arched transom. The east, track- facing, elevation has a Spanish-style frontone, to the north of which is a raised platform with two sliding wood cargo doors and two passenger door openings. The interior is divided into a passenger lobby and offices at the south end, with a waiting room and ticket office in the center, and a large cargo room at the north. The depot was named to the Alabama Historical Commission's Places in Peril list in 2009, which led to a community effort to preserve the building.

Land War Eviction of the Rice family At the time of the Land War the Kent family, comprising David Kent, his wife Mary (née Rice), and their nine children (seven sons & two daughters), lived in an Irish-speaking household at Bawnard House, Coole, Castlelyons, County Cork (William Kent, \\"For generations our family had farmed 200 acres at Bawnard\\").Irish Bureau of Military History - Witness Statement 57, William Kent David Kent died in 1876 (the year after his youngest child Richard was born); he was 44 years old. Mary Kent (née Rice) had grown up in nearby Towermore and had family living in the locality. In 1887 her nephews Austin and Richard Rice were evicted from their farm for non- payment of rent and this began a series of events which would bring the Kents to national prominence. The Rices had initially leased the farm from the Peard family but in July 1888, it was sold to Orr McCausland, a Belfast-based landowner and their homestead was occupied by a steward and a general manager (Robert Browne, reportedly a native of Scotland). The Kents and their cousins, the Rices, teamed up with Father Jeremiah O’Dwyer, the parish curate, to launch a boycott against Browne. As leading players of the Castlelyons and Coolagown branch of the Irish National League, they organised a meeting at Coolagown. Addressing a crowd of nearly 300 people, Fr. O’Dwyer asked them to ensure that Browne did not lose his life in case things became ‘too hot’ to handle. In the autumn of 1889, four Kent brothers - David, Edmond, Richard, and William – were among ten men hauled into a crowded Fermoy Courthouse, charged with orchestrating a boycott campaign. In court, Browne also told how Edmond Kent, the eldest brother, threatened him on Fermoy bridge, while David Kent had blown horns at him and called him a ‘land-grabber’ outside Coolagown Church. The second oldest Kent brother, Thomas, did not appear in the dock because he was in the USA (he had emigrated to Boston in 1884 and had spent the intervening years working as a church furniture maker and dabbling publishing; had he been present he could have been tried after being accused of throwing eggs at Browne's car). The court took a dim view on the defendants and imposed some harsh sentences; Fr. O’Dwyer was sentenced to six months in prison, Edmond and William were given four months with hard labour and David was given two months with hard labour (Richard was not given a prison sentence). From the dock, Edmond shouted, ‘Death or victory is our war-cry, and then the Saxon chains will break’, while another prisoner called Callaghan McCarthy managed to loose off a few bars of ‘God Save Ireland’ on a flute. The prisoners were handcuffed, taken out to a wagonette and driven to the railway station from where a special carriage transported them to Cork Gaol. Anticipating the crowd of several thousand who gathered to cheer the prisoners, the authorities provided the prisoners with an escort of 200 soldiers of the Royal Warwickshire and West Cork Regiments, with bayonets fixed. The boycott continues The boycott on Browne resumed when the Kents had served their time. At the close of May 1890, Tom (who had returned from Boston) and his brother William were charged, alongside Austin Rice, with intimidating Mary Murphy, an elderly woman who worked for Browne, by making sure she was unable to purchase a pig at the fair. During their trial, Browne, now under police protection, told how horns were continually blown towards his house from the Kent residence. When the magistrate sentenced the brothers to one month's imprisonment, with hard labour, William roared ‘Victory is our cry and our motto no surrender’ while Thomas slammed his fist upon the desk and shouted \\"God save Ireland\\". Uproar followed and the police were ordered to clear the court. As the prisoners were escorted to the railway station, District Inspector Ball became so unnerved by the cheering crowd that he ordered his men to charge with their batons and several people were injured. The army then blocked Fermoy Bridge and cleared the streets. Thomas and William Kent were still in prison when a fresh case came before Fermoy Court in June 1890. They were amongst seven men accused of attempting to ‘compel and induce’ fourteen members of McCausland's workforce to leave his employment. William was described as the ringleader of a campaign to intimidate McCausland's staff when they attempted to attend Mass at Coolagown Chapel. The case was raised at the House of Commons in London where both Kent brothers were named. Arthur Balfour, the Chief Secretary, described \\"the most disgraceful scenes … enacted Sunday after Sunday\\". William Kent was accused of spitting upon the workers and their families, having ‘performed the acrobatic feat of entering the chapel by the window and assisted others to enter the same way.’ There was also much ‘jeering and jibing the police’. Thomas Kent took ‘an active part in the disgraceful proceedings, but was not at all so bad as his brother William.’ Heavy sentences followed - six months hard labour for William, two for Thomas – and once again a cheering crowd followed them to the train station in Fermoy. William Kent later left an account of the whole boycott episode, \\"In 1889 my brothers, Edmond, Richard and David, the local curate, Rev. Father O'Dwyer, and myself were arrested. Owing to his youth, the younger brother, Richard, was acquitted by the resident magistrates, Colonels Gardiner and Caddell. David received six months' hard labour; Edmond and I were each sentenced to four months' hard labour. The charge was conspiracy with others to evade payment of rents. The sentences were served in Cork County Jail. For refusing to enter into bail for our future good behaviour we served an additional three months' imprisonment. A short time after our release, my other brother, Thomas, who had been in America, returned and threw his lot into the fight. Both he and I were arrested under the Balfour Coercion Acts. Another trumped-up charge of conspiracy was brought against us. I was sentenced to six months' hard labour and Thomas was sentenced to two months. These sentences were served in Cork Jail. On our release we were met by thousands of people in Fermoy who escorted us all the way home to Bawnard.\\" Volunteers In January 1899, Tom attended a meeting in Castlelyons to select a Sinn Féin candidate to represent the Fermoy and Castlelyons district on Cork County Council. To loud applause, he told the crowd of the six policies he believed the candidate must be pledged to, namely Home Rule, the establishment of a Catholic University, the release of political prisoners, the reinstatement of evicted tenants and the compulsory sale of land to tenant farmers. When Michael Mackay of Ballyroberts was proposed as the Nationalist candidate, the motion was seconded by David Kent who seized the opportunity to point out to the gathering that the Unionist candidate, Colonel Johnson, had been Hon. Secretary to the Landlord's Association. A show of hands was called for at the end of the evening. Mackay won by a huge majority. Tom became an avid supporter of the Gaelic League and later of Arthur Griffith's Sinn Féin By 1901, Mary Kent (age 60) was living at Bawnard House with five of her bachelor sons and one of her daughters. The Kent home was under constant surveillance by the RIC. In 1913 two of the four Kent brothers, Thomas and David, became active in the Irish Volunteer and they started a Castlelyons Branch of the organisation; William Kent, \\"In 1914 and 1915 Thomas and David took an active part with Terence MacSwiney in the enrolment of the Irish Volunteers. They called a meeting at Clonmult and got the famous Clonmult hurlers to march to the village of Dungourney where a British recruiting meeting was being held. Thomas and David led the men through this meeting, and, halting a short distance away from it, addressed the crowd, advising them to join the Volunteers and have nothing whatever to do with the British Army.\\" The Castleyons branch of the Irish Volunteers was said to be the first teetotal branch of the organization in Ireland and many of their training maneuvers took place in the woods around the Kents home at Bawnard. In August 1915, Thomas Kent attended the funeral of the Fenian leader Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa in Glasnevin, Dublin, at which Patrick Pearse delivered his celebrated oration. William Kent stated, \\"Early in January, 1916, Thomas and Terence MacSwiney were arrested and charged before a bench of magistrates in Cork with making seditious speeches at Ballynoe. They were acquitted. Within a week or two Thomas was again arrested and sentenced to two months imprisonment because arms and ammunition were found in the house.\\" Easter Rising In 1916, during the round-up in the aftermath of the Easter Rising the RIC raided Bawnard House, and Mary Kent and her four sons Thomas, David, William, and Richard resisted arrest. William Kent recounted,\\"Early on the following morning [2 May 1916] we were awakened by loud knocking on the hall door. The house was surrounded by British Crown Forces. I was sleeping in the Eastern side of the house. I jumped out of bed, put my head out of the window and asked \\"Who's there?\\". The answer was \\"Police; come down\\". I immediately awakened Tom, who was sleeping in the Western side of the house, and said, \\"The whole place is surrounded. We are caught like rats in a trap.\\" Tom put some clothes on, armed himself with a rifle, and, without showing himself, called to those below, \\"What do you want?\\". As expected, the answer came, \\"We are police and have orders to arrest the whole family.\\" The reply was given definitely by the whole family, \\"We are soldiers of the Irish Republic, and there is no surrender\\". Our mother, then over eighty years of age, dressed herself, and all during the ensuing fight assisted by loading weapons and with words of encouragement. The police fired a volley to which we replied and a fierce conflict began. We were armed with three shot guns and a rifle. The fight lasted about three hours. Head Constable Rowe was shot dead, while other members of the R.I.C. were wounded. David was also badly wounded, having lost two fingers and received a gaping wound in his side. Military reinforcements arrived and when the last shot was fired from the house we had no alternative but to surrender, Our ammunition was exhausted. The house was wrecked. Not a pane of glass was left unbroken. The interior was tattooed with marks of rifle bullets. The altar and statues in the Oratory alone escaped destruction. All around the altar plaster was knocked off the walls but not one of the statues was struck. At one time the fire of the attackers was attracted to the window of the Oratory where they thought a girl was firing at them. Strange to say, it was the statue of our Lady of Lourdes they saw from outside. The same statue was bought by my brother Tom at the sake of Father Ferris's household effects. Father Ferris had brought it from Lourdes and I attribute to it the fact that our lives and home were saved from complete destruction. The greatest safeguard of all is to have a statue in the house. Following the surrender we were taken out through a window assisted by the military. Thomas was not permitted time to put on his boots. Thomas and I were immediately handcuffed. Richard, a famous athlete, was not immediately handcuffed and in the confusion he attempted to escape by bounding over a hedge nearby. He was fired on and fell, mortally wounded. We were then lined up against a wall of the house by the R.I.C. who prepared to shoot us, when a military officer interposed himself between us and the firing party. Ordering the police to desist, he said, \\"I am in command here. Enough lives have been lost, and I take these men prisoners of war.\\" The following week, Thomas Kent (aged 51) was convicted of the murder of Constable Rowe at court-martial in Victoria Barracks, Cork. On 9 May, he was executed by firing squad at the Barrack's Prison. His nerves were so bad on the morning of his execution that the guards had to bring a chair for him to sit upon. His body was then buried in qucklime in an unmarked plot in the prison yard. Richard Rice Kent died of his injuries on 4 May 1916. David Kent was transferred to Richmond Barracks in Dublin, where he was sentenced to death but this sentence was later commuted to penal servitude for life. Subsequently he was moved to HM Prison Pentonville in England. While there his mother, Mary Rice Kent, died. He was released from prison by amnesty in 1917.Piaras F.

Later years At the 1918 general election, David Kent was elected unopposed as a Sinn Féin MP for the Cork East constituency. After the Irish War of Independence he opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted against it. He was re-elected in Cork East at the 1922 general election and remained a TD until the 1927 general election when his brother William ran in his place. William was elected as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork East constituency at the September 1927 general election but was not reelected in 1932. In the late 1920s, David Kent was sent to the United States to raise money for the Republican cause and he died shortly after his return: William Kent, \\"He was sent to America on a mission of propaganda on behalf of the I.R.A. He returned home after some months far poorer in health, and, after a life of struggle for the freedom of his country, this brave soldier and patriot died at his home at Bawnard on the 16th November, 1930.\\" At the 1933 general election William was elected as a National Centre Party TD and did not run for re-election in 1937. William Kent died in 1957, he was 84 years old and was the \\"last survivor of the band of local Land League fighters\\".

It won the 2015 Documentary Feature Competition Grand Jury award at the South by Southwest Film Festival. It was conceived when co-director Scott Christopherson, an assistant film professor at St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas, met retired police officer William \\"Dub\\" Lawrence at a baseball game and was invited to visit his hangar where he carried out his private investigations into incidents in which people were killed by police. Lawrence, the central figure in the documentary, founded Davis County, Utah's SWAT team, the first in the state, in the 1970s as a sheriff. He was motivated to begin investigating police killings after the same SWAT team he founded killed his son-in-law, Brian Wood, during a 2008 standoff. Much of the film focuses on the history of the SWAT teams that were formed in the United States after the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles and mythologized in popular culture by shows such as S.W.A.T.

Description It is situated about South South East of Alice Springs and East of the Stuart Highway in the Northern Territory just off the Phillipson Stock route. Lying between the MacDonnell Ranges and the Simpson Desert and taking in much of the Ooraminna Ranges, the property is composed of a variety of land types including red sand hills, rocky outcrops and spinifex plains. Deep Well is just east of the former Central Australia Railway which had a stop also called Deep Well. History William Hayes and his wife Mary arrived in Alice Springs in 1884 with steel telegraph poles to replace the original wooden ones used to build the Overland Telegraph. They also worked on other properties in the area such as Mount Burrell and Owen Springs Station. The Hayes established the property in the late 1880s and it has remained in the Hayes family ever since. Billy Hayes, the fifth generation of the Hayes family, was inducted into the Stockman's Hall of Fame in 2009. Hayes was the hero in Turbulence, the bush poem written by Murray Hartin. A drought from 1964 to 1965 resulted in Ted Hayes moving all the stock to Undoolya Station and temporarily leaving Deep Well abandoned. All the Aboriginal workers also left the property and set up camp at Undoolya as well. During the early 1990s the area was struck by drought once more and had large debts. Some 5,000 cattle had been grazing at Deep Well up until the drought started. The Hayeses decided to diversify into tourism and built a lodge on the northern side of the station at Ooraminna. Shortly afterward Ted Egan approached the family asked if he could build a movie set in the same location for a film version of his song The Drover's Boy. The film did not progress but the replica buildings of Newcastle Waters from 1921 remain at Ooraminna and are used for tourist accommodation. The property was again struck by drought starting in 2002 with Billy Hayes destocking the property in 2006 when the last of the dams dried up.

This colorless solid is the caesium salt of bisulfate. It is obtained by combining Cs2SO4 and H2SO4 Properties Above 141 °C, CsHSO4 is a superionic conductor. The rapid ionic conductivity arise especially in the range of these temperatures due to the high activity of protons. Based on the results of X-ray crystallography, the structure consists of tetrahedral sulfate centers that bridge caesium ions. The proton is associated with the oxygen on sulfate. CsHSO4 goes through three crystalline phases that are referred to as phase III, II, and I.Maja Mroczkowska-Szerszeń, Maciej Siekierski, Rafał Letmanowski, Michał Piszcz, Renata Cicha-Szot, Lidia Dudek, Sławomir Falkowicz, Grażyna Żukowska, and Magda Dudek. \\"Spectroscopic Verification of Extended Temperature Stability of Superionic Phase Obtained in Mechanosyntehsis Process for CsHSO4/Phospho-silicate Glass Composite.\\" Oil and Gas Institute, Ul. Lubicz 25a, 31-503 Cracow, Poland/Warsaw University of Technology Faculty of Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry and Solid State Technology Division Ul.Noakowskiego 3, 00-640 Warsaw, Poland 3AGH – University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Fuels and Energy, Al. Mickiewicza 30, 30-059 Cracow, Poland, n.d. Web. CsHSO4 is initially existing in phase III at a room temperature of 21 °C. Phase III ranges from 21 °C to 90 °C with a transition temperature of 90 °C to 100 °C between phase III and phase II. Phase II ranges from 90 °C to 140 °C. At 140 °C, CsHSO4 undergoes a phase shift from phase II to phase I. Phase III (21 °C to 90 °C) and Phase II (90 °C to 140 °C) are referred to as the monoclinic phases, in which CsHSO4 exhibits its lowest proton conductivity. As the crystalline structure’s temperature is raised, it will show variations in the unit cell volume and the arrangement of its hydrogen bonds, which will alter the ability of a CsHSO4 crystalline structure to allow the displacement of protons. At 141 °C, the CsHSO4 crystal structure experiences a structural change from monoclinic phase II to a tetragonal phase, becoming phase I. Phase I has more elevated crystal symmetry and widened lattice dimensions. Phase I is noted as the superprotonic phase (strong conducting phase), which triggers an extreme growth in proton conductivity by four orders of magnitude, reaching 10 mS/cm. This makes the conductivity of CsHSO4 ten-fold stronger than the conductivity of a sodium chloride aqueous solution. In the superprotonic phase, the movement of an SO4 tetrahedron generates a disruption of the hydrogen bond network, which accelerates proton transfer. The tetragonal anions available in the structure are accountable for the arrangement of the hydrogen bonds with the moving protons.Chan, Wing Kee. Structure and dynamics of hydrogen in nanocomposite solid acids for fuel cell applications. TU Delft, Delft University of Technology, 2011. Potential applications The maximum conductivity of pure CsHSO4 is 10 mS/cm, which is too low for practical applications. In composites with SiO2, TiO2, and Al2O3) , the proton conductivity below the phase transition temperature is enhanced by a few orders of magnitude.Hiroki Muroyama, Toshiaki Matsui, Ryuji Kikuchi, and Koichi Eguchi. \\"Composite Effect on the Structure and Proton Conductivity for CsHSO4 Electrolytes at Intermediate Temperatures.\\" (n.d.): n. pag. Department of Energy and Hydrocarbon Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyoto University, Nishikyo-ku, Kyoto 615-8510, Japan, 13 Apr. 2006. Web. Unlike hydrated protonic conductors, the absence of water in CsHSO4 provides thermal and electrochemical stability. Electromotive force (EMF) measurements in a humidified oxygen concentration cell verified the high ionic nature of CsHSO4 in its superprotonic phase.Uda, Tetsuya, Dane A. Boysen, and Sossina M. Haile. \\"Thermodynamic, thermomechanical, and electrochemical evaluation of CsHSO 4.\\" Solid State Ionics 176.1 (2005): 127-133. Based on heat rotation, the voltage stayed the same for over 85 hours during the measurement, particularly at the high temperature. These results, demonstrate the thermal independence from humidity-type environments. Additionally, the crystal structure of CsHSO4 allows for quick transport of smaller charged ions, resulting in efficient energy transfer in electrochemical devices.

It stars Christopher Lloyd, Max Records, Laura Fraser, and Christina Baldwin. Shooting began in Virginia, Minnesota, on 28 February 2015. It premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on 13 March 2016, and received limited theatrical and video on demand release on 26 August. Plot John Wayne Cleaver, a teenager in a small Midwestern town, has been diagnosed as a sociopath and harbors homicidal impulses, which are exacerbated by working at his mother April's funeral home. He controls his urges with strict rules, mental stopgaps, and speaking to his therapist Grant. At the scene of a murder, John sees a puddle of black oil. After an identical murder, talk of a serial killer piques John's interest. While out trick-or-treating with his friend Max, John spots a drifter lurking outside his neighbor Bill Crowley's house. At the high-school Halloween dance, John scares off a bully by threatening to kill him. After discussing this with Grant, John sees the drifter join Crowley on an ice fishing trip, and John follows them. As the drifter is about to attack Crowley, Crowley suddenly kills the man with his bare hand, which morphs into a branch-like shape. Crowley cuts out his own lungs and replaces them with the man's. John creates a serial killer profile, noting every victim had organs removed. While following Crowley and his wife, Kay, on their date night, he comes across his mother and Grant having dinner, upsetting John. John studies fairytales and mystic folklore, and the police connect the recent murders to a missing person named Emmett Openshaw. John follows Crowley to a barbershop owned by Greg, a man who danced with Kay the previous night because Crowley was limping. After seeing Crowley attack Greg, John impulsively sets off the barbershop's alarm, drawing two police officers, who Crowley kills. Afterward, Crowley no longer limps and appears to be rejuvenated. Before leaving, Crowley nonchalantly answers a phone call from Kay. John sees a puddle of black oil and realizes it was Crowley's old leg, which he swapped with Greg's. After leaving Crowley an anonymous note revealing his knowledge, John overhears Kay say Crowley has been housebound for a week. As John visits Crowley at Kay's request, Crowley recites and explains William Blake's poems \\"The Lamb\\" and \\"The Tyger\\". John continues to profile Crowley, who grows weaker. On Christmas Eve, John calls Crowley from a pay phone to ask about the process and what he stole from Openshaw. Crowley gives vague answers, and John realizes Crowley was stalling. Seeing Crowley's car, John flees to Max's house. After John reveals their friendship was merely a coping mechanism, Max throws out John. John stumbles upon Crowley killing Max's father; John, wearing a ski mask, fails to stop Crowley and flees. After Max's father's memorial, April tries to connect with John, who threatens her life when she pushes him. After a conversation with Grant, John waits until Crowley leaves the house and tries to scare him away by threatening what he loves most: Kay. When John believes he has unintentionally killed Kay, he panics and calls Grant. After seeing she is still alive, John leaves the house as Crowley arrives. In Crowley's car, he finds Grant's intact body, which he hides. The next morning, Crowley realizes John has taken the body. At Max's father's funeral, Crowley reveals Grant had been out looking for John. John says Crowley will not try anything in public and observes that Crowley's heart will not last much longer. After the funeral, John realizes his mother did not leave; he finds her unconscious on the embalming table beside Crowley, who demands John return Grant's body. John pretends to agree but knocks out Crowley. After April regains consciousness, they hook Crowley up to the embalming device. When Crowley wakes, the lights flicker, and a large, black, oily monster slides out of his body. Realizing he can no longer be with Kay, he asks John to watch over her and commits suicide. Both Crowley and the monster's corpses melt into black oil. Afterwards, the police find Grant's body, and Crowley is reported missing. John comforts Kay, who tells him the story of how she and Bill fell in love, making John realize he must find happiness, too. John and his mother later have a casual conversation as they embalm Grant's body.
