It comprises the baronies of Burrishoole and Murrisk, essentially all the land adjacent to Clew Bay. The territory was autonomous within the Kingdom of Ireland until 1576, when its Queen Grace O'Malley agreed to the surrender and regrant policy, whereby she would agree to accept English inheritance law, and in return would be given her land back with a new set of official title deeds. On her death the lands were inherited by her son Tibbot \\"ne Long\\". Description Knox says of Murrisk \\"With Burrishoole it forms the kingdom of Aicill and Umall, which comes into history at the battle of Moy Lena. Aicill seems to be a descriptive term applied to mountainous country. Umall means low, and applies in this sense to the country lying east of Clew Bay, as Aicill applies to the parts lying north and south of the bay. The title may be translated as King of Highland and Lowland. Aicill survives in Achill Island and Curraun peninsula. The term was applied to the country between Clew Bay and the Killeries in the thirteenth century. Though at all times an independent kingdom acknowledging supremacy of only the King of Connacht, it was too small to play an independent part, and therefore is rarely mentioned in the annals.\\" (p. 303). Legacy The Gaelic culture and Irish language continued on in the area longer than most other parts of Ireland. Today, Acaill and An Corr√°n are part of the Mayo Gaeltacht. Kings of Umaill Its earliest rulers were the semi-historical Tuath mhac nUmhoir. The Umaill, its early historical rulers, were renamed the U√≠ Bri√∫in Umaill to claim a fictitious relationship with the U√≠ Bri√∫in.

The approach is novel in that it uses a mostly stock aircraft with a modified landing gear \\"pod\\" that carries a separate engine for road propulsion. The PD-1's wings fold along its sides, and the main landing gear and road engine pod slide aft along special rails, creating a driving configuration. The driving configuration compensates for the rearward center of gravity created by the folded wings, and provides additional stability for road travel.  Development  Trey Johnson, an award-winning homebuilt aircraft builder took on the challenge of making a roadable aircraft. The PD-1 is intended to be an aircraft first, and a car second. The vehicle can cruise at a speed of up to 140 mph in normal flight even with the road engine sitting as dead weight.  Design  The engine pod carries a separate engine for road travel with its own fuel tank. The wheels are driven through an automatic transmission with a reverse gear. The lightweight fuselage coupled with a low power engine allows fuel economy with of usable fuel. The aircraft is registered in Washington state as a motorcycle due to its 3-wheel configuration. The wings are hinged to allow them to rotate and fold back against the rear fuselage of the plane. The horizontal stabilizer is also hinged to reduce the width of the vehicle in road travel mode.  Operational history  The prototype was constructed using Glasair's two weeks to taxi program. It was started on March 29, 2010, and the modified prototype was test flown by July 21, 2010. The prototype was displayed at the Experimental Aircraft Association Airventure airshow in 2010. The company's second generation refinement was code named the PD-X, with intention of building a marketable aircraft based on the PD-X test results.  Variants  PD-2 on display PD-2 rear PD-2 pod installation *PD-1 *PD-2 A second generation version of the PD-1 using the same Sportsman airframe as the PD-1. The PD-2 uses two forward mounted wheels with suspension in a conventional landing gear layout. A single rear wheel is mounted aft on the pod containing the second engine for road use. An updated pod was developed using a 50 hp four cycle engine with casters that fits into the baggage compartment. A custom lightweight four-piece carbon-fiber ramp can be used to load the pod without lifting. Gas mileage is 24mpg in ground use.

It is also known as Complement control protein (CCP) modules or short consensus repeats (SCR). The name derives from the visual similarity of the domain to nigiri sushi when the primary structure is drawn showing the loops created by the disulfide bonds. Sushi domains exist in a wide variety of complement and adhesion proteins. The structure is known for this domain; it is based on a beta- sandwich arrangement - one face made up of three Œ≤-strands hydrogen-bonded to form a triple-stranded region at its centre, and the other face formed from two separate Œ≤-strands. CD21 (also called C3d receptor, CR2, Epstein Barr virus receptor or EBV-R) is the receptor for EBV and for C3d, C3dg and iC3b. Complement components may activate B cells through CD21. CD21 is part of a large signal-transduction complex that also involves CD19, CD81, and Leu13. Some of the proteins in this group are responsible for the molecular basis of the blood group antigens, surface markers on the outside of the red blood cell membrane. Most of these markers are proteins, but some are carbohydrates attached to lipids or proteins. Complement decay-accelerating factor (Antigen CD55) belongs to the Cromer blood group system and is associated with Cr(a), Dr(a), Es(a), Tc(a/b/c), Wd(a), WES(a/b), IFC and UMC antigens.

She was one of fifteen legitimate children of Bernab√≤ Visconti, who, along with his brother Galeazzo, was Lord of Milan. Her father negotiated for his infant daughter to marry Louis II of Anjou but Bernab√≤ was deposed and the negotiations dropped. As a teenager, it was then intended that she marry the English noble Henry Bolingbroke, whom she had met as a girl, but after he was banished to France, the marriage negotiations were suspended. She was briefly wedded in 1399 to the future Elector of Saxony Fredrick of Thuringia, before the marriage was annulled. In 1407 she married Edmund Holland, 4th Earl of Kent; there were no children. The relationship was troubled, as Edmund had had an affair shortly before the wedding, and a daughter from that relationship was born after they were married. In September 1408, Edmund was killed in battle. HenryIV guaranteed Visconti a third of the income from her portion of her husband's lands in England, but for the rest of her life she was constantly affected by money problems, as the dowry promised by her family upon her marriage was never paid: reprisals taken against Milanese merchants in London in 1464 and 1489 were probably both related to the unpaid dowry. Lucia, Countess of Kent, died in 1424 and was buried in Austin Friars, London. Early life Bernab√≤ Visconti and his wife Regina della Scala Lucia Visconti was born in Milan in 1380 to Bernab√≤ Visconti, Lord of Milan (ruling jointly with his brother GaleazzoII), and Beatrice Regina della Scala, \\"[Henry] had been in Milan in 1393, when she had been thirteen years old.\\" one of fifteen legitimate children. As was typical of girls born to noble families, she and her nine sisters were expected to marry members of other noble families to form or strengthen alliances. For example, her sister Valentina became the Queen of Cyprus, and another sister Caterina married their cousin Gian Galeazzo (son of GaleazzoII), who became the first Duke of Milan. Marriage arrangements Between 1382 and 1384, Bernab√≤ actively sought marriage negotiations for his infant daughter with LouisII, the Duke of Anjou and the future King of Naples, via Louis's mother, Marie of Blois. A marriage would have cemented Visconti's future as Queen of Sicily. Bernab√≤ remained in close contact with Marie, attempting to come to terms on a marriage contract. At the time, there was discord in the Visconti family. Gian Galeazzo, who succeeded his father in 1378, saw the impending marriage as a threatan alliance which would enhance his uncle's position in the family at the expense of his own. In the spring of 1385, Bernab√≤ was deposed and taken prisoner by his nephew. The marriage contract between LouisII and Lucia Visconti was cancelled and upon Bernab√≤'s death in December 1385, Gian Galeazzo became the sole ruler of Milan, giving him the authority to determine whom Lucia Visconti was to wed. The most notable potential suitor lined up for Visconti was Henry, the Duke of Lancaster (the future King HenryIV of England), who visited Milan in 1393 and had captured her imagination. In 1399, when arrangements between the two of them were being discussed, Henrywhose first wife died in 1394was banished to France for ten years by King RichardII and had his lands taken. For Gian Galeazzo, political security came first and foremost and as such, he put the negotiations on hold, insisting that Henry return to favour at court before any further talks could proceed. Visconti was smitten with Henry and told her sister Caterina that if she could be sure of marrying him, she would wait for Henry \\"to the very end of her life, even if she knew that she would die three days after the marriage\\". Later that year, Henry returned to England and overthrew Richard with the help of the King of France, but the marriage negotiations never resumed. Instead, Gian Galeazzo offered Visconti to Frederick of Thuringia, the future Elector of Saxony, and they were married in 1399, but the marriage was never consummated and she was able to obtain an annulment on the grounds that she was forced into it. A musical piece entitled Pi√π chiar che'l sol by Antonello da Caserta is believed to have been written for the wedding. Edmund Holland The announcement of the marriage between Lucia Visconti and Edmund Holland, in A Chronicle of London (original manuscript in the British Museum) Gian Galeazzo's death in 1402 eliminated the possibility of any future political marriage for Visconti. Meanwhile, Henry remarried in 1403, but had not forgotten about the teenage girl from Milan who had been infatuated with him. He arranged for her to marry Edmund Holland, 4th Earl of Kent, a favourite soldier of his who had fought at the Battle of Shrewsbury. In 1405, Edmund had defended Henry's son in battle which helped solidify his exemplary prominence. In May 1406, a marriage contract was drawn up for the two of them, which called for a dowry of 70,000 florins of which 12,000 were to be paid on consummation of the marriage, followed by annual payments of 8,285 florins until the total amount was paid, which was likely an attraction for Holland as he had great debts resulting from the military support expected of him by Henry and having to support several dowager countesses. The wedding took place on 24 January 1407 at St. Mary Overy in Southwark, making Visconti the Countess of Kent. A record of their marriage was published in 1827 by the English antiquary Sir Nicholas Harris Nicolas, in his A Chronicle of London, 1089‚Äì1483. At the wedding ceremony, it was Henry who gave Visconti away. However, the marriage between the newlywed couple was off to a rocky start. To preface, in 1406, Edmund had had a liaison with Constance of York and the following year, Constance gave birth to Edmund's illegitimate daughter, Eleanor. There is no surviving documentation that indicates Visconti's reaction to either of them, but Edmund's sisters noted that Constance was not an obstacle in their brother's marriage. In September 1408, Visconti was widowed when Edmund was killed in battle in Brittany. The couple did not have any children. Widowhood Unlike other widows of her time period, Visconti was not made to return to her family's home, but was rather able to make a life out of what she had. More specifically, she used her title as the Countess of Kent to her benefit. Since her husband left her with little money (the dowry had not yet been paid), she was to deal with his major debt. She decided to follow in the footsteps of her half-sister Donnina (who had married John Hawkwood, an English soldier) by approaching Henry for financial aid. Henry granted her one-third of the income of her portion of her late husband's land (which was one-fifth of the estate, the remainder was divided among his four sisters), with the remainder used to pay his creditors. This was not enough to balance the accounts, and Visconti petitioned Parliament for letters of marque that would compel Milan to pay the dowry. However, Milan had its own financial problems after Gian Galeazzo's death and payment never came. She petitioned Parliament a second time for debt relief, promising a portion of the dowry to Edmund's creditors. However, the cost of maintaining her estates was too great, and by July 1421, Visconti was residing at the medieval Holy Trinity Minories (she may have been there as early as September 1411), which was similar to a nunnery but was also known as a place where women of high status and money would live together. It is believed that she lived in a townhouse built in 1352 by Elizabeth de Burgh, which had a reputation for housing women who were in tenuous political circumstances. Here, she lived a comfortable and well-kept life, but she was also engaged in business, being listed as an exporter of goods to Italy in 1423. Visconti's will bequeathed a portion of her unpaid dowry to various English nobles and other Italian immigrants, with the remainder (along with personal items) going to her steward, some ladies-in-waiting, her fool, and various religious institutions in Milan and England, including St. Mary Overy, Bourne Abbey in Lincolnshire (where Edmund was buried), and the Minoresses from Holy Trinity, but all of the recipients were equally unable to obtain the money from Milan. The bequests to religious recipients came with conditions to pray for herself and Edmund's souls. She died on 14 April 1424 and was buried in Austin Friars, London, which was a popular resting place for London's Italian immigrants. Her epitaph, written in Latin, focuses on her charm and beauty, her family and Milanese heritage, and does not mention her husband at all. It is preserved in a 16th-century document held in the British Museum, although the last part of it is untranslatable. Legacy As her dowry was never paid, the claims against it continued long after her death. Reprisals taken against Milanese merchants in London in 1464 to recover this sum were probably related to the dowry, and these grew to be so debilitating that the merchants were forced to stop trading with England in 1471, prompting Galeazzo Maria Sforza, the Duke of Milan, to ask his envoy in England to plead for relief. In 1486, a letter to the new Duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Sforza, demanded payment of the dowry. The Duke claimed to be unaware of such a debt at first, and three years later, ultimately declined the request as no documentation had been provided. Further reprisals took place in England in 1489, but the Duke was able to convince Henry to put a stop to them. However, Emperor FrederickIII issued separate letters of marque in 1490, which enabled English agents to detain Milanese traders on the Rhine. Even though Visconti's will was finally produced, the Duke declared it to be a fraud. Eventually, King HenryVII ordered that efforts to enforce the dowry be dropped.

At club level he represented Cambridge University, the Army and most notably Harlequin F.C.. He played international rugby with England and in 1959 he was selected to tour New Zealand and Australia with the British Lions. Personal history Marques was born in Ware, Hertfordshire in 1932, and was educated at Yardley Court and Tonbridge School where he played in the rugby first XV alongside Colin Cowdrey. Marques completed his national service with the Royal Engineers before matriculating to Cambridge University. After retiring from rugby he joined the family firm making street lights. David Marques was the brother of Robin Marques. In 1964 Marques was a member of the 1964 America's Cup challenger team, aboard the Sovereign. He was also a magistrate, a governor for Haileybury College and a church warden for 23 years. He was married with three children. Playing career Marques came to note as a rugby player when he represented Cambridge University, playing in four Varsity Matches. He later played for the Army, but it was his eleven years spent with Harlequins that he was best known. In 1956 he was selected to play for invitational tourists the Barbarians, playing against the 1958 Australians and then travelled with the Barbarians on their tours to Canada and East Africa. 1956 was also the year in which Marques was first selected to play for the England national team, facing Wales as part of the 1956 Five Nations Championship. Marques played a total of 23 matches for England, including two touring parties, the 1958 Australians and the 1961 South Africans. During the 1957 Five Nations Championship and 1958 Five Nations Championship Marques became a member of two Grand Slam winning teams. As a forward player, Marques was never in the position to be a prolific scorer, but he scored his one and only international try in the 1960 encounter with Ireland. In 1959 he was chosen to tour Australia and New Zealand with the British Lions. He played in 18 matches of the tour, including two Tests, the Second Test against Australia and Second Test versus New Zealand. Marques made an impression on the British Lions tour from the moment he arrived. When he stepped off the plane on its arrival at Australia, he was dressed as a stereotypical British gent in white shirt, military tie, dark suit, bowler hat and rolled umbrella. Another event of the tour that showed Marques's personality was when he was kicked in the face during an off-the- ball incident by Albie Pryor. Instead of retaliating, he got to his feet and shook his aggressor's hand; when he was asked by fellow Lion, Bill Mulcahy, why he hadn't punched Pryor, Marques replied, \\"You wouldn‚Äôt understand, Bill.

It is one of the closest known approaches of an asteroid to Earth, at which time the object appeared at a magnitude of 14. It was first observed by of the Catalina Sky Surveys telescopes north of Tucson, Arizona on 9 October 2010. It has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of , which corresponds to 0.0693 lunar distance. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 11 October 2010. The asteroid may have passed from Earth in October 1979, but the nominal orbit suggests it passed millions of kilometres from Earth in 1979.  Physical characteristics  is a stony asteroid, characterized as a Srv subtype.  Rotation period  In November 2010, a rotational lightcurve of was obtained from photometric observations, which showed that the asteroid is a fast rotator. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 0.0229317 hours (1 minute and 23 seconds) with a brightness amplitude of 0.92 magnitude (). A high amplitude typically indicates that the body has an irregular, elongated rather than spherical shape. This result supersedes a previously obtained lightcurve with a shorter period of 0.01167 hours ().  Diameter and albedo  The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of based on an absolute magnitude of 28.9.

It flows through Niassa Province and Cabo Delgado Province, passes near Chai, and flows into the Mozambique Channel of the Indian Ocean at Quiterajo beach at . The Messalo River is in length while the Messalo River Basin is in size. The river flooded its banks in March 2000 during the 2000 Mozambique flood. Floods in Mozambique in 2000 The 247 highway crosses the Messalo River. The major settlements on the river include Natulo and Marere (on the coast). Geography The Messalo River drains a catchment area of . It is the 8th largest river among the 18 major river basins that drain Mozambique. Mesalo River, the second largest river in the Cabo Delgado Province in northern Mozambique, delimits on its south the coastal area, along the Indian Ocean coastal belt, in the Macomia District; other coastal area boundary limits are set by the Diquide to the south and the coast line on the east. The estuary encompasses of pristine mangrove forests unaffected by anthropogenic interference. ;Agriculture Agriculture, which is mostly at the subsistence level, practiced along rivers, swamps and lakes near the villages, covers cultivation of rice, cassava, millet, maize, sweet potatoes, beans and coconuts. Along the Messalo River, alluvial grasslands offer fertile soils that have moisture retaining potential in the dry season. These lands are used for the cultivation of rice and other crops. There are possibilities of rising two crops of rice. Rice plantation is done in Nov/Dec and harvested around May/June. However, there are complaints of crops getting destroyed due to wild life depredations. Fauna and flora The Messalo Wildlife Area, named after the river, is a inland safari area. It is characterized by acacia and palm savannah, coastal forest, and miombo woodland. The river delta of the Messalo and the Zambezi are home to some of the most dense mangrove forests in the region. Lion, leopard and elephant inhabit the area. The Nothobranchius sp. Messalo river MZHL 05-12 MZHL 05-12, a species of killifish endemic to the Messalo River is also an aquarium display species, which spawns on peat or similar spawn substrata and fully adopts to neutral water conditions with water temperature in the range of . In the coastal estuary of the river, its wetlands are a breeding ground for birds, several fish and crustacean species. Alluvial silt is deposited in the estuary. In general, the coastal belt, which subsumes the Messalo estuary (the hot spot of biodiversity), has rich marine vegetation, apart from mangroves, such as sea grass meadows. The wild life, in the mostly uncharted region of the coastal zone, includes marine wildlife comprising turtles and dugongs in large numbers. Wildlife found consists of elephant, buffalo, various antelope (waterbuck, eland, greater kudu, sable, suni, oribi, duiker), pigs and primates, elephant shrew, predators such as hyena, leopard, wild dog (in packs of 20 or more), lion (in large numbers of 2000 or more); African elephant and the wild dog species are categorized as 'endangered' in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. Elephants, black rhinoceros, impala, zebra, Lichtenstein's hartebeest, wildebeest, cheetah and reedbuck, though reported in the past, await reconfirmation. The coastal zone does not have any human population within its limits, except for a few villages along the stretch of main road to Mocimboa de Praia (Macomia-Mocimboa road) bordering the project boundary. Fishing is an important vocation for the people living in the estuary, though \\"Transient fishermen\\" competing with them in this economic activity is a disadvantage. Molluscs and crustaceans are gathered by women in the intertidal zone for their consumption. Sea cucumbers are also harvested and dried for commercial sale. White lime or building material is produced by using specific varieties of gastropods (Chicoreus ramosus, Fasciolaria trapezium).

The bill is named after Katie Sepich, who was brutally attacked outside of her New Mexico home in August 2003. She was raped, strangled, her body set on fire, and abandoned at an old dump site. Summary Katie's attacker's skin and blood were found under her fingernails. This DNA profile was sent to the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) where officials hoped a match would be made. A DNA match identified Gabriel Adrian Avila, who had been arrested in November 2003 for aggravated burglary and was serving time in the New Mexico Corrections System since November 2004. After being confronted with his DNA evidence, Avila subsequently confessed to the murder of Sepich. The experience of Katie's parents, Jayann and Dave Sepich, in bringing Katie's killer to justice motivated them to advocate for legislation that would expand the use of DNA to arrest and convict criminals: > Jayann and Dave Sepich, Katie's parents, began researching the role of DNA > in solving crimes. At first they just wanted to find and punish the person > who had murdered their daughter; but as they learned more about how DNA can > solve crimes, they also learned it could do so much more‚Äìit can prevent > crimes and save lives. The proposed legislation encourages states to collect a sample through DNA profiling from individuals who are: arrested for, charged with or indicted for crimes involving murder, manslaughter, sexual assaults, and kidnapping or abduction. The collected samples are included in CODIS which contains more than 5 million records and used by law enforcement agencies. DNA profiling is not the same as full genome sequencing and contains no genetic information. There are over 3 billion markers in the DNA molecule and only 13 of these markers go into CODIS. Law's expansion Susana Martinez was the attorney who prosecuted and convicted the killer. While she was District Attorney, Martinez worked to pass legislation that would expand Katie's Law, requiring a DNA sample for all felony arrests. While Governor of New Mexico, Martinez signed the expansion bill into law in April 2011. National growth On February 4, 2010 Congressman Harry Teague (D-NM) introduced H.R. 4614. The bill has 11 co-sponsors: * Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) * Rep. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) * Rep. Tim Holden (D-PA) * Rep. Steve Kagen (D-WI) * Rep. Suzanne Kosmas (D-FL) * Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM) * Rep. Betsy Markey (D-CO) * Rep. David Reichert (R-WA) * Rep. Thomas J. Rooney (R-FL) * Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-CA) * Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY) On May 18, the bill was passed in the House by a vote of 357 to 32. In the Senate side, S. 3805 was introduced by Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) on September 20, 2010 and co-sponsored by Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM). As of 2018, no action has been taken on the bill. 25 states have passed Katie's Law or similar programs: * Alabama * Alaska * Arizona * Arkansas * California * Colorado * Florida * Kansas * Louisiana * Maryland * Michigan * Minnesota * Missouri * New Mexico * North Carolina * North Dakota * Ohio * Rhode Island * South Carolina * South Dakota * Tennessee * Texas * Utah * Virginia * Vermont In an interview aired on America's Most Wanted, President Obama expressed his support for the legislation, saying that \\"it is the right thing to do,\\" and that \\"this is where the national registry becomes so important, because what you have is individual states ‚Äî they may have a database, but if they're not sharing it with the state next door, you've got a guy from Illinois driving over into Indiana, and they're not talking to each other.\\" Criticism Some opponents argue that this policy is an invasion of privacy or a violation of civil rights. Others comment that since DNA contains sensitive genetic information it is quite different from fingerprints. A federal district court, in the United States v. Pool,United States v. Pool, 09-015-EJG-GGH, May 27, 2009, https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1147173.html upheld that the federal statute allowing collection of DNA samples prior to conviction for inclusion in the national DNA database does not represent a violation of constitutional rights. In issuing its ruling, the court specifically held that the collection does not represent a violation of Fourth Amendment rights. The court also dismissed claims of violations of Fifth and Eighth amendment rights. High courts in Maryland,State of Maryland v. Charles Raines, 844 A.2d 427, September 2003, http://www.denverda.org/DNA_Documents/Raines.pdf and Virginia,Anderson v Commonwealth of Virginia, 634 S.E.2d 372, September 2007, http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1062051.pdf also ruled that DNA upon arrest does not violate the Fourth Amendment. Maryland later reversed itself.Maryland v. King, 425 Md. 550, 42 A. 3d 549 (2012).

History Yew Tree Farm covered about 18 Cheshire acres on the north side of Sale Lane to the east of Tyldesley. In 1845 George Green of Wharton Hall, Little Hulton, and his brother William, leased it and sank a shaft to prospect for coal. This became Yew Tree Colliery. By about 1851 George Green had built a tramroad to link the colliery to the Bridgewater Canal east of Astley Green. At the Tyldesley end, the tramway was worked by cable down the steep slope of the Tyldesley Banks and horse-drawn wagons completed the journey. The tramway was out of use by 1913 when the tipping plant and sidings by the canal were sold to the Clifton and Kersley Coal Company to be used by its colliery at Astley Green. In 1860 John Holland, a railway contractor from Ireland, joined the company and the Tyldesley Coal Company was formed in 1870. The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) built a line from Eccles to Wigan via Tyldesley and the Tyldesley Loopline via Leigh to Kenyon Junction in 1864 providing the impetus for the exploitation of coal seams in Tyldesley and Greens Sidings were constructed for the company to the east of Tyldesley Station. After the arrival of the railway the company expanded rapidly. It opened Shakerley Colliery near Shakerley Little Common in 1867, which had the first iron headgear in the country but finished operating in 1878. (A different pit belonging to William Ramsden was also named Shakerley Colliery.) Combermere Colliery in Shakerley opened in 1878 and lasted until 1893. The company built a brickworks at Combermere and the railway to it operated until the mid-1930s. Cleworth Hall Colliery was sunk under the Cleworth Hall estate to the east of Yew Tree in 1874. In the early 1890s the shafts at Yew Tree were deepened. Cleworth Hall colliery was modernised before the 1914 and the Arley pit shaft equipped with steel headgear and a washery and coal preparation plant built. The company's coal output in 1871 was 25.825 tons and its highest output was in 1907 at 419.471 tons. In 1920 it was 267.848 tons. In about 1888 miners employed by the Tyldesley Coal Company exceeded the boundaries of the lease and extracted coal south of Well Street which was discovered when colliers of neighbouring Astley and Tyldesley Collieries broke through and found the coal gone. Lengthy litigation followed resulting in a ¬£3,000 fine for Green's company. The colliery's railway expanded at the same time as the pits were developed. The line to Combermere Colliery was extended to Peelwood Colliery, which opened in 1882 next to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Manchester to Southport line and where the company had a siding. A fault caused the company to sink another shaft, the Daisy Pit, to win coal from seams close to the surface. In 1896 Cleworth Hall employed 304 men underground and 46 surface workers. Gas coal, household and manufacturing coal was mined from the Black and White, Six-Foot and Trencherbone, mines.The Yew Tree Colliery was smaller with 118 below ground and 23 above. Steam, household and manufacturing coal were mined from the Seven Foot mine. In 1923 only Cleworth Hall and Peelwood, which together employed over 1,400 workers, were operating. Peelwood closed in 1928. In 1933 Cleworth Hall mined the Trencherbone, Haigh Yard, Cannel, Three Feet, Four Feet and Arley coal seams and employed over 900 workers. The company remained independent until it became part of the National Coal Board's (NCB) North Western Division on nationalisation in January 1947 when 760 men were employed underground and 258 on the surface. In 1961 the area became the NCB's East Lancashire Area. The area mined by this company, Shakerley Collieries and James Roscoe's New Lester Colliery was opencasted after the Second World War, removing all traces of the industry. Disaster The worst mining disaster in Tyldesley occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858. An explosion of firedamp caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives, the youngest 11 and the oldest 35 years of age. Some of the victims are buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Locomotives The locomotives owned by the Tyldesley Coal Company had to pass under the Manchester Road bridge which had restricted headroom and were built to a reduced loading gauge. Its first locomotive was a 4-coupled saddle tank locomotive from the Haigh Foundry in Wigan. It was delivered in 1867 and named Tyldesley. Beatrice, another 4-coupled saddle tank, was bought from Vulcan Foundry in Newton le Willows in 1877, the same year that Jessie was delivered from Walker Brothers in Wigan. In 1897 Victoria, another 4-coupled locomotive, was bought from the Vulcan Foundry and the first 6-coupled engine, Louisa, was built by the Hunslet Engine Company in Leeds in 1902.

He had a dream of giving better living conditions of working-class Latinos Early life Born in Jalcocotan in the Mexican state of Nayarit, Galarza immigrated with his mother and two uncles to California. As recalled in his autobiography, Barrio Boy, the young Man successfully navigated the cultural differences in the public school system, received a scholarship to Occidental College in Los Angeles, and then went on to earn a master's degree in history at Stanford University in 1929. Career Galarza worked with the Pan- American Union (now the Organization of American States) in Washington D.C. from 1936 through 1947 publishing analyses on educational, labor and infrastructure issues in Latin America. In 1947, he completed his doctoral dissertation on the electricity industry in Mexico and earned a Ph.D. from Columbia University.http://departments.oxy.edu/library/geninfo/collections/special/galarza/list%20of%20works.htm accessed 10/11/10 Galarza worked as a labor organizer and a key leader in laying the groundwork for the emergence in California of the farm labor movement. Galarza began organizing farm workers in California in 1948 as research and education director of the American Federation of Labor's short- lived National Farm Labor Union. Galarza organized a 1947 strike against the DiGiorgio Corporation in Arvin, California that lasted 30 months, and entangled the company and the union in suits and counter-suits for the following 15 years. Altogether between 1948 and 1959, Galarza and the union initiated some twenty strikes and labor actions. Although primarily an intellectual and scholar whose weapons were words, Galarza initially played an activist's role with the AFL as the leader of several strikes. But he was completely thwarted by the bracero program and so abandoned the union leader's weapon of direct economic action for the intellectual's weapon of words in hopes of killing the program. A prolific writer, Galarza's best-known work is Merchants of Labor (1964), an expos√© of the abuses within the Bracero Program. The book was instrumental in the ending of the program, which in turn opened the door for Cesar Chavez to begin unionizing immigrant farmworkers in 1965.Dictionary of Latino civil rights history By Francisco Arturo Rosales page 178 In 1956 Galarza was awarded the Bolivian Order of the Condor of the Andes.http://departments.oxy.edu/library/geninfo/collections/special/galarza/timeline.htm accessed 10/11/10 The Ernesto Galarza Applied Research Center at the University of California Riverside and other California elementary and secondary schools bear his name. His many books include: * Barrio Boy, 1971 * Merchants of Labor: The Mexican Bracero Story, 1964 * Spiders in the House and Workers in the Field, 1970 Salinas Valley tragedy In the wake of a bus crash in the Salinas Valley in September 1963 that claimed the lives of 32 braceros, Galarza was appointed to investigate the tragedy by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor of the U.S. House of Representatives. His report, published by the committee in April 1964, found that the accident was directly caused by negligence, exemplifying a practice in which flatbed trucks were illegally converted to buses, driven by poorly trained personnel. With safety officials and regulators indifferent to the situation, and businesses showing disregard for human life, he found that the accident had been imminent. He wrote a book on the accident, Tragedy at Chualar (1977).

It was built in 1762, early in the area's colonial settlement history, and later served as the office of an ice harvesting business. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 7, 1971. Description and history The Bowman- Carney House stands on the eastern bank of the Kennebec River, about north of Maine State Route 197, and a similar distance west of Maine State Route 128. Five of its seven acres are cleared, providing a view overlooking the river. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a hip roof, two interior chimneys, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. Its main facades, facing toward the river and Route 128, are essentially identical, with centered entrances framed by pilasters, entablature, and gabled pediment. A single-story ell, probably of 19th-century construction, extends to one side. The interior retains many 18th-century features, include wide floors of pumpkin pine, wall paneling, and trim. The town of Dresden was originally part of Pownalborough, settled in 1754 and incorporated in 1760, which was the first shire town of Lincoln County. This house was built in 1762 for Jonathan Bowman by Gersham Flagg, a local master builder who had recently completed the Pownalborough Courthouse. Bowman was a leading citizen, serving as a judge of probate, and engaged in a variety of economically important local businesses. In the 19th century it came into the hands of James Carney, a blacksmith whose work supported maritime trade. The property was later adapted for use in the ice harvesting business, with the house converted into an office, and ice storage sheds lining the river. This business peaked in the 1870s, and crashed by the turn of the 20th century. It was then purchased by the daughters of historian Henry S. Burrage, who recognized its historic significance and contributed to its preservation. Ms. Burrage's friend, William Waters, born and raised in Blakely, Georgia, bought the home and spent close to 40 years investing-in, restoring and enjoying the home and property, including tracking down most all of the original furniture built in 1760 for the home by an expert craftsman in Boston. William was an artist (a student of Lamar Dodd), New York designer and owner of a few successful businesses, including The Firehouse and Lilac Antiques. Waters' family originally hailed from Baltimore and for generations the family antiques were handed down, many of which ended up with Waters, including for example a family grandfather clock.

After a year reporting for WPLG-TV in Miami, the ABC affiliate, she worked for NBC News as one of the network's two Latin America correspondents. She later served as a correspondent for the network posted in Beirut and Rome, before joining The Miami News as a columnist. Just prior to joining CNN in 1992, Anderson served a four-year stint with WTVJ in Miami. Her first position at CNN was a national correspondent, where she covered such top breaking news stories as the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Los Angeles earthquake in 1994, Pope John Paul II's 1995 visit to Denver, Hurricane Andrew in South Florida in 1992 and the Branch Davidian stand-off in Waco, Texas, in 1993.

Early life  Bonnie Anderson was born, in Cuba, on October 22, 1955 to Howard and Dorothy Anderson and is the youngest of four children. She lived in Cuba for only five years before her family was moved to Miami, Florida. She was raised primarily in Colombia and is fluent in Spanish and English. In addition to her journalism degree from Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism, she has studied at the University of Barcelona in Spain.  Family history  Howard F. Anderson moved his wife and, at the time, his only child to Cuba in 1947, where he ran a small string of family-owned gas stations, factories and a Jeep distributorship. After Fidel Castro took power of the Cuban government in 1959 anti-American sentiment began to grow as the political climate became increasingly volatile. Charged with smuggling arms into Cuba, Howard Anderson was taken into custody by Cuban military forces in March 1961. His summary trial began on April 17, 1961 ‚Äì the day that the Bay of Pigs invasion was launched. Howard Anderson was sentenced to death less than two hours into his trial, and was the first American to be executed by Fidel Castro‚Äô forces. He died by firing squad on April 19, 1961. He was survived by his wife, Dorothy, and his four children; Gary, Marc, Lee and Bonnie.  Other work  In 2004 she authored the book, ‚ÄúNews Flash ‚Äì Journalism, Infotainment, and the Bottom- Line Business of Broadcast News.‚Äù The book garnered national attention for exposing illegal hiring practices, political cheerleading and ethnocentric coverage in the network news industry. She details how the news networks, in their pursuit of market share and increased profits, favor ‚Äúinfotainment‚Äù programming over substantive journalism. She argues that passing infotainment off as news is detrimental to the American public. She offers that integral journalism enables ‚ÄúAmericans to make well-informed decisions about how to exercise their rights and responsibilities as citizens.‚Äù After leaving CNN, Anderson established The Anderson Media Agency, Inc. which offered a broad range of media-related services for individuals, corporations, government officials and journalists. There, she specialized in coaching in voice control and inflection, pacing, breath control, TelePrompTer reading, confidence building techniques, script writing, anchoring, audio tracking and on-camera performance. An avid angler, Ms. Anderson set a world record on April 4, 2009, when she landed a 151-pound Atlantic Blue Marlin with a 16-pound tippet off the coast of the Dominican Republic.

Its epicenter was offshore from the Valpara√≠so Region, and its intensity was estimated at magnitude 8.2 . Much of Valpara√≠so was destroyed; there was severe damage in central Chile from Illapel to Talca. The earthquake was felt from Tacna, Peru to Puerto Montt. Reports said the earthquake lasted four minutes. A tsunami was also generated. The earthquake killed a reported 3,882 people. The record of previous seismic activity includes major earthquakes in 1647, 1730 and 1822. The 1906 disaster was predicted by Captain Arturo Middleton, Chief of the Chilean Army Meteorological Office, in a letter that was published in El Mercurio, one week before it occurred. Admiral Luis G√≥mez Carre√±o ordered the shooting of at least 15 people, who were caught looting after the earthquake. A Board for Reconstruction was formed some weeks after the earthquake. The Seismological Service of Chile was also created. Background Chile lies above a convergent plate boundary, an area where the Nazca Plate under the Pacific Ocean is subducted or moved beneath the South American Plate. In the region around Valparaiso, the rate of convergence is about 70 mm/yr. As these two plates converge, it drives the Nazca plate with massive movements called megathrust earthquakes. The 1906 event was one of many large earthquakes in Chile along this plate boundary. Earthquakes can originate at the plate interface itself or within either the subducting or overriding plates. Citing the conjunction of Neptune with the moon, Captain Arturo Middleton, Chief of the Chilean Army's Meteorological Office, predicted the earthquake in a letter published in the Valpara√≠so newspaper El Mercurio on August 6. Captain Middleton was severely criticized in the following days, and was described as \\"ignorant and obscurantist.\\"  Earthquake characteristics On August 16, 1906, at 19:55 local time, while most Chileans were dining, a subterraneous sound was heard, and before it ended, the first tremor occurred, lasting about four minutes. The second tremor occurred at 20:06 and, although it lasted only two minutes, was much more violent. There were numerous aftershocks: at least 56 of them occurred during the first 24 hours after the beginning tremors. The magnitude of the earthquake has been estimated to be 8.4 , 8.2 or = 8.2‚Äì8.3. The energy release has been re- evaluated with an estimated seismic moment of 2.8 x 1028, equivalent to a magnitude of 8.26 . The rupture length of the earthquake has been estimated at about 200 km with a focal depth of about 40 km. The focal mechanism has been assessed using contemporary seismograph records from five stations, which were published soon after the earthquake. The data suggest that the earthquake was probably along the subduction interface. Modelling of a tsunami using these source parameters shows that this earthquake was the origin of the transpacific tsunamis recorded that same day in Hawaii and Japan, rather than the almost contemporaneous 1906 Aleutian Islands earthquake. The 30-minute time gap between the Aleutian and Chilean earthquakes is thought to be coincidental, with no causal link between the two. Damage El Mercurio newspaper on 17 August 1906, reporting the earthquake of the day before The earthquake caused damage throughout Central Chile, from Illapel to Talca. There were several destructive fires in El Almendral (from Plaza de la Victoria to Cerro Bar√≥n), Mercado Cardonal, Teatro de la Victoria (Victory Theatre), the Intendencia, the Maritime Government in Sotomayor Square and the Fiscal Dock at the port. The earthquake was also felt in Santiago, the capital of Chile. The newspaper El Mercurio reported in its August 17 edition that \\"the earthquake was produced in a violent way since its beginning, and provoked an indescribable panic through all the four thousands of inhabitants of Santiago and an unprecedented terror in the last years. Two or three-story buildings, even the most solid ones such as the National Congress, were swinging like a vessel in the sea. The shakings were so strong that many people thought the earth was going to open itself in deep and long strips.\\" According to the University of Chile, there were deaths. The earthquake left more than 20,000 injured. On August 19, Admiral Luis G√≥mez Carre√±o was appointed Plaza Port Chief. G√≥mez ordered the distribution of water and food, removal of corpses and demolition of buildings in risk of collapse, from a tent in Plaza de La Victoria. Adm. G√≥mez ordered the shooting of at least 15 people who had committed crimes during the aftermath.

Relief efforts Despite the state of the city, authorities quickly organized themselves into relief groups. Firefighters from other cities of Chile, including Santiago, Concepci√≥n and Talcahuano, moved to Valpara√≠so to help the local Fire Bureau. Physician Jos√© Grossi worked to counteract the plagues that followed the earthquake. On August 25, President Germ√°n Riesco and President-Elect Pedro Montt arrived at Valpara√≠so. They arrived there by train, on foot, or horseback to survey the magnitude of the disaster. Some weeks after the earthquake, a Board for Reconstruction was formed, using money received from other countries.  Aftermath  In 1906, the Seismological Service of Chile (Servicio Sismol√≥gico de Chile) was created. Its first chief executive was Fernand de Montessus de Ballore. The effects of this historic seismic event in the Valpara√≠so rupture zone would be studied and measurable in the context of further seismic activity in this vicinity.Korrat, (1986).

It was designed by Alfred B. Mullett and built in 1869‚Äì1870 by William Hogan of Bath, Maine. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1970. It has been a private residence since purchased by Jack Nelson and his wife Stacy in October 2013. Description and history The former customhouse in Wiscasset stands adjacent to its historic waterfront area, at the northwest corner of Water and Fore Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a hip roof and granite foundation. Its south-facing front facade is three bays wide, the center one projecting slightly and topped by a low-pitch gable with a keystoned half- round window at its center. A porch shelters the center entrance, with square paneled posts rising by an entablature and flat roof with balcony rail. Windows on the ground floor consist of pairs set in segmented-arch openings, while those on the second floor, also paired, are set in round-arch openings. A granite entablature separates the brick wall from the projecting roof cornice. with Postcard ca. 1920 Wiscasset's first customs office was opened in 1791, and was then located in a small building adjacent to the home of the collector, Francis Cook. This building was later moved to Bradford Street and converted to a private residence; it later burned down. Its next customhouse was built in the 1790s, and was destroyed in Wiscasset's 1866 fire. The present building was designed Alfred B. Mullett, the Supervising Architect of the United States Treasury Department, and was completed in 1870 by William Hogan, a local contractor. Hogan at first raided Fort Edgecomb for bricks, until the War Department put a halt to that activity, and also took stones from a family cemetery's enclosing wall. The building at first housed both customs and post office facilities. Wiscasset ceased to be a port of entry in 1913, and parts of the building were occupied by other government offices until the 1960s, when the post office moved to new facilities. The building was then sold into private ownership, and has served a variety of commercial and residential purposes since.

The hillfort is sub-circular in plan, and encloses an area of approximately . It is defined by an earthen rampart up to in height and an external ditch, up to a maximum of in depth. A gap in the southeastern side of the rampart, and a corresponding causeway across the ditch, is thought to be the original entrance and is associated with a small 'D' shaped embanked enclosure, which is apparently visible on aerial photographs. Although the enclosure has subsequently been degraded by ploughing, it is still apparent as a series of low earthworks. Limited archaeological investigation of the interior of the hillfort in the early 20th centuryThe Ancient History of Wiltshire, by Sir Richard Colt Hoare, published 1812, Chapter No. 11 ‚Äì Station 8: Fovant failed to find any direct traces of occupation. However, outside of the fort some Iron Age pottery and a lead spindle whorl were found. In addition, two Roman coins, one of which dated to the reign of Emperor Constantine I, were said to have been found within the central area. An Iron Age sword and scabbard were also found on the nearby trackway which runs along the ridge top. The hillfort is abutted on both its northern and southern sides by embanked ditches or cross dykes. Their precise function is unknown but the manner in which they cut the ridge suggests that they were intended to prevent movement along it. The Northern Cross dyke, in length, ran from the ditch of the hillfort across the top of the ridge before continuing part way down its northern slopes. Although visible in 1928, the section between the hillfort and the edge of the ridge has subsequently been infilled by ploughing, but survives as a buried feature. The Southern Cross dyke, which survives as a discontinuous series of banks and ditches, (sections of which are filled in but survive as buried features) is a total of in length. It travels roughly south-southeast from the 'D' shaped enclosure, down the southern slope of the ridge, and into the base of a valley. An aerial photograph from 1928 clearly shows the southern cross dyke continuing as a buried feature beneath a trackway which runs along the ridge top, indicating that the trackway came into use after the cross dyke was constructed. An Anglo-Saxon charter also mentions 'the ridgeway' suggesting that the trackway was in use by at least the early medieval period. Referred to as the 'Ten Mile Course' by Dr. Stukeley in 1776, in the medieval and post-medieval periods the trackway was the main route from Wilton to Shaftesbury. By the 18th century it had become a turnpike road, and a map dated to 1773 depicts a toll house immediately to the south of it. The remains of the former toll house structure are visible today as a series of earthworks representing a building platform with a small enclosure immediately to its east. The site is a scheduled national monument no.1020262. Today, the site is also famous for the Fovant Badges, which are a number of regimental badges cut into the chalk of the hill on its northern flank. These were created by soldiers garrisoned near Fovant during the First World War, and are clearly visible from the A30 which runs through the village. Location The site is located at , to the southeast of the small village of Fovant, in the county of Wiltshire. The hill has a summit of 201m AOD. There are public footpaths and bridleways to the east and south of the site.

The book is published in Albania and stands as a serious endeavour to document the history of the Albanians and their country since Antiquity. A long-time teacher in Bitola, he was also deeply involved with the Bulgarian movement for independence and was a friend of the Aromanian people, whose schooling he extensively helped during his lifetime. Biography Faveyrial was born on 25 March 1817 in the village of Usson-en-Forez, located west of Saint-√âtienne in the south French province of Auvergne. Prior to joining the Congregation of the Mission in Paris in 1843, he studied in Lyon. Faveyrial moved to the order's Istanbul branch in 1847, two years after he was ordained a priest by the Lazarites. The Roman Catholic Church, \\"Holy Heart of Jesus\\", was Faveyrial's long-time residence in Bitola, the city where he served as an abbot and teacher Faveyrial was strongly supportive of the Bulgarian struggle for independence, and renowned as being among the souls of that movement. From 1867 until his death, 26 years later, he served as a professor at the Romanian high school of Bitola (Monastir), a city in west Macedonia, where he taught French and philosophy. For a year before that, he had served as a priest in Thessaloniki. In Bitola, Favyerial combined his work as a teacher with his religious duties for the Lazarite order as a local abbot. It was in Istanbul that, between 1858 and 1867, Faveyrial started a collection of books with the purpose of building a library that would help write the history of the Albanians, the Bulgarians, and the Aromanians. His scrutiny of the history of these peoples, he thought, would assist them to prepare for their future. Faveyrial visited the Albanian lands in 1884, and along with Apostol MƒÉrgƒÉrit, the general inspector of the Romanian schools of the Ottoman Empire, he founded Romanian-financed schools for the Aromanian population in Berat, Kor√ßa, Prizren, and other settlements. Faveyrial was an acquaintance of folklorist Konstantin Miladinov and public figure Dragan Tsankov. He even served as de facto editor-in-chief of Tsankov's Istanbul-based newspaper Balgaria for several years. Despite their ecclesiastical differences, Bulgarian patriarch Cyril remembered Faveyrial as a \\"kind priest\\". After a life of intense work of teaching and writings, and after having opened many new schools during his last 13 years of life, Jean- Claude Faveyrial died in Manastir on 26 November 1893. History of Albania and other works The History of Albania, written in French, was drafted between 1884 and 1889, and discovered on 20 September 1999, by Father Yves Danjou, responsible of the archives of the House of the Lazarite Missionaries in Paris. The book of 416 pages is more correctly a history of southeastern Europe, as it also details the past of other Balkan peoples. While not necessarily always factually accurate and understandably outdated in its perception, Faveyrial's work is of great historical value, partly because its inclusion of original letters by various Balkan historical figures. During the time that Faveyrial was writing the History of Albania, Le istorie albanesi (The Albanian histories) (Salerno 1886), a work in four volumes by the Arb√´resh√´ Francesco Tajani, was published in Italy. As Faveyrial's work was in French, the first history of Albania written in the Albanian language is considered to be T'nnollunat e Sccypniis prei gni Gheghet ci don v√™nnin e vet () (Alexandria 1898) by Stef√´ Zurani (1865‚Äì1941). Faveyrial is also known for several works in the Bulgarian language, all of which now considered particularly rare, such as the Manual of Politeness (Istanbul 1858), French‚ÄìBulgarian Dialogues (Istanbul 1859), and Great Catechism for the Use of the Uniate Bulgarians (Istanbul 1862). Faveyrial also authored books and articles focused on Balkan history and the Catholic faith, as well as a description of Bitola. However, some of these were lost as the Bitola Lazarite building was torched in 1909.

Early life and education He grew up in Boksburg where he began his education at Pioneer Primary School and matriculated at Voortrekker High School in 1956. He obtained his BSc degree in 1960 from the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education (now North ‚Äì West University) and in 1961 he completed his Transvaal Higher Education degree. During his studies, he played an active role in the Transvaal Education Training College Union. Although the organisation dealt mainly with students and training issues, it could be seen as his first steps into the political arena. He was elected president of the student council, which enabled him to travel abroad to the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium, where he met other student leaders. He also campaigned for the Nationalists in the 1960 referendum. Career=Early career In 1962 he started as a maths teacher at the Helpmekaar Boys School in Johannesburg, and the Johannesburg Technical College. Later, he was appointed as an administrative officer at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). He was next promoted to the data processing unit, where he trained in computer technology. He was promoted and transferred to the office of the Director General as an administrative secretary. After his resignation from the SABC in 1968, he went to work at IBM until 1974. Here he received training in banking and finance, while also attending the IBM Graduate School of Banking Business at Princeton in the United States. Political career Du Plessis's father was an active member of the National Party and a political career was always a part of his aspirations. He had already worked for the National Party during elections and the Republic referendum of 1960. In 1966, he became an official member of the National Party. After entering his first step in community service in 1972 as an elected official to the Johannesburg City Council, he rapidly advanced himself and was chosen as vice mayor in 1974. He also ran as the NP candidate in Florida in the same year and snatched the seat from the United Party. In his capacity as a cabinet minister, he served as a member of the Elected Committee on Public Accounts from 1976 to 1981. He was also elected as secretary of the National Party Study Group on Finance from 1979 to 1981. He was also the information officer for the National Party from 1977 to 1981. In 1982 he was elected chairman of the committee that studied South African Broadcasting, but remained interested in finance and economics and was eventually elected Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Information. Until this appointment, he served as director for twelve companies. As minister, he was concerned with the Government's relationship with the press. In his first few weeks he made the controversial statements regarding the SABC 's broadcasting Conservative Party propaganda and reporting on government affairs. He was also present, along with Pik Botha, Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the negotiations with Angolan leaders. On 23 November 1983 he was appointed as the Minister of Education and Training in P. W. Botha's cabinet, being succeeded the following year by Frederik Willem de Klerk. Here he encountered school boycotts in Atteridgeville, Pretoria, where he personally negotiated with the student leaders to deal to their problems. In an effort to ease tensions after the death of a student during police action, he consulted with Bishop Desmond Tutu, but by May 1984, six Atteridgeville and Saulsville schools closed. He sought to understand the role of the black community and to reorganise schools and points out that any parent or student had a direct communication with him as minister. In 1984, during the budget speech of his department in Parliament senior black teachers attended the debate. He declared that there would be no racial restrictions in the future in the Department of Education. Barend du Plessis was appointed as the Minister of Finance in August 1984. He succeeded Dr. Owen Horwood, inheriting an extremely complex task. South Africa was in financial trouble as a result of various factors including the decline in the gold price. The Rand/Dollar exchange rate was at a low point and the land was shrouded in a general drought, with exports were dropping significantly. In 1985 he was charged with the task of restructuring South African international credit so foreign banks could extend short-term credit to South Africa. He served as Finance Minister in the latter part of P. W. Botha's cabinet and in the first part of F. W. de Klerk 's administration. He later became the chairman of the National Party 's Federal Information Committee and member of the Executive National Party in the Transvaal. After P. W. Botha fell ill in 1989, he successfully contested interim president Chris Heunis and Foreign Minister Pik Botha in the struggle for the leadership of the National Party but was beaten in the final round by De Klerk, son of former interim president Jan de Klerk, by a 69‚Äì61 figure. Du Plessis was recalled to de Klerk's cabinet but left his post in 1992. Personal life He is married to Antoinette van den Berg and has four children.

The main facade faces the river, and has a centered double-door entrance flanked by sidelights, with symmetrically placed windows on either side. A porch extends across this facade, with five arched openings on the first floor, and a large arched opening on the second. Stairs sheltered by the porch provide access between its levels. The interior of the building is simply styled, and little altered since its construction. In 1888, thirteen summer residents of Kennebunkport organized a \\"Lobster, Boat, and Canoe Club\\", which was formally titled the Kennebunk River Club with the start of construction of this building the following year. The building, designed by Frederick W. Stickney of Lowell, Massachusetts, was completed in 1890, and was enlarged by the addition of a canoe shed on the north side in 1908. Canoes were built and hired out to club members by members of the Penobscot tribe who came to Kennebunkport from Old Town each summer. The club's activities have mirrored changing fashions of boating trends over the following decades.

The base is located approximately south of Dubai and is operated by the United Arab Emirates Air Force. It is currently the headquarters of Joint Task Force 633 and supports Australian operations in the Middle East. Facilities The airfield resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway, 09/27 which has an asphalt surface measuring , and a parallel taxiway with a width of . Foreign users Several foreign countries allied to the United Arab Emirates are believed to have made use of Al Minhad Air Base since the early 2000s to support the logistics supply chain for their army operations in Afghanistan. Use of the Al Minhad Air Base is a sensitive matter for the Government of the United Arab Emirates, which imposes a diplomatic agreement stating that the militaries of foreign governments not advertise the host nation nor location of their operations in the United Arab Emirates due to \\"local sensitivities\\" about allowing a foreign military presence within its borders. The British Armed Forces have operations at the base.10ABUDHABI69, 'UAE - Scenesetter for visit of CJCS,' 9 February 2010, Wikileaks, via United States diplomatic cables leak No. 906 Expeditionary Air Wing RAF was stood up at the base on 15 January 2013.British Government, 906 Expeditionary Air Wing Stands Up in the United Arab Emirates, January 2013 906 Wing was an expansion of the RAF's presence; previously, prior to Christmas 2012, No. 6 Squadron RAF had exercised their Eurofighter Typhoons from the UAE. The Canadian Forces operated a forward logistics support facility in the Middle East which they had codenamed Camp Mirage. It is widely believed that Camp Mirage was located at Al Minhad Air Base from its founding in fall 2001 until its closure in fall 2010 due to an unrelated disagreement over securing additional landing rights for UAE's civilian airlines at Canadian airports. The United States military relied on the UAE bases for assistance during the Gulf War and the recent conflict in Iraq. The Australian Defence Force has used Al Minhad as their main transport and logistics hub in the Middle East since the withdrawal of Australian combat forces from Iraq in 2008. The RAAF had operated AP-3C Orions from the base from 2003 to support operations in the region, however it was not until 2008 when an agreement was signed which allowed Australia to command its regional headquarters there. The ADF maintains a facility at Al Minhad, and as part of the military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has deployed Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets, Boeing E-7A Wedgetails and Airbus KC-30As. During early 2015 the Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets were replaced by McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A Hornets. The New Zealand Defence Force and the Armed forces of the Netherlands also have deployed assets here. The Italian Air Force has deployed the Task Force Air (TFA) since July 1, 2015 (previously located to Al Bateen (Abu Dhabi) since 2002) to support operations in the region.

Waymo LLC is an American autonomous driving technology development company. It is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google. Waymo operates a commercial self-driving taxi service in Chandler, Arizona called \\"Waymo One\\"; users in Chandler use an app to request a pick-up. As of February 2020, Waymo offered the only commercial self-driving car service that operated fully autonomously, without safety backup drivers in the vehicle. Waymo is now run by CEO John Krafcik. In May 2020, Waymo announced its first outside funding round of $2.25 billion. On June 25, 2020, Waymo announced a partnership with Volvo to integrate Waymo‚Äôs self-driving technology into their vehicles. In October 2020, the company announced the first commercial robotaxi service available to the public, with the operational domain being areas of the greater Phoenix region with Chandler, Arizona fully mapped. History 510 Systems was Co-founded by Sebastian Thrun and Anthony Levandowski which was later acquired by Google.  Ground work  Google's development of self-driving technology began on January 17, 2009, at the company's secretive X lab run by co-founder Sergey Brin. The project was launched by Sebastian Thrun, the former director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) and Anthony Levandowski, founder of 510 Systems and Anthony's Robots. Before working at Google, Thrun and 15 engineers, including Dmitri Dolgov, Anthony Levandowski, and Mike Montemerlo worked together on a digital mapping technology project for SAIL called VueTool. Many of the team members had met at the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge where both Thrun and Levandowski had teams competing in the robotic, self-driving car challenge. In 2007, Google acqui- hired the entire VueTool team to help advance Google‚Äôs Street View technology. As part of Street View‚Äôs development, 100 Toyota Priuses were purchased and outfitted with the Topcon box, digital mapping hardware developed by Levandowski's company 510 Systems. In 2008, the Street View team launched project Ground Truth, to create accurate road maps by extracting data from satellites and street views. This laid the groundwork for the Google's self- driving car program.https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55a5a07ee4b0d4522cac0322/t/582f48d5f5e23137ed567a3d/1479493848415/GISday16_GoogleMaps.pdf  Pribot  In February 2008, a Discovery Channel producer for the documentary series Prototype This! called Levandowski. The producer requested to borrow Levandowski's Ghost Rider, the autonomous two-wheeled motocycle Levandowski's Berkeley team had built for the 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge. However, in 2007, Levandowski had donated the self-driving bike to the Smithsonian. Since the motorcycle was not available, Levandowski offered to retrofit a Toyota Prius as a self-driving pizza delivery car for the show. As a Google employee, Levandowski asked Larry Page and Sebastian Thrun, if Google was interested in participating in the show. Both declined, citing liability issues. However, they authorized Levandowski to move forward with building the car, given it was clear that it was not associated with Google. Within weeks Levandowski founded Anthony‚Äôs Robots so that he and his team could modify a Toyota Prius without reference to Google. He retrofitted the car with light detection and ranging technology (LiDAR), sensors, camera's, and software from his company 510 Systems and named the prototype, the Pribot. The Pribot was the first self-driving car to drive on public roads. The episode featuring Pribot driving itself and the pizza across the San Francisco Bay Bridge under police escort aired in December 2008. After the broad press coverage of the Pribot, Levandowski and Thrun were greenlit to launch Google's self-driving car program in January 2009. In 2011, Google quietly acquired Levandowski‚Äôs technology - the nucleus of Google's self-driving car project, via his two companies, 510 Systems, co-founded alongside Pierre-Yves Droz and Andrew Schultz, and Anthony‚Äôs Robots for an estimated $20 million. A Waymo self- driving car  Project Chauffeur  Project Chauffeur ran for almost two years undetected, road testing with seven vehicles before the New York Times revealed their existence on October 9, 2010. Google announced its self-driving car initiative via its blog later the same day. Starting in 2010, lawmakers in various states expressed concerns over how to regulate the emerging technology. Nevada passed a law in June 2011 concerning the operation of autonomous cars in Nevada, which went into effect on March 1, 2012. A Toyota Prius modified with Google's experimental driverless technology was licensed by the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in May 2012. The car was \\"driven\\" by Chris Urmson with Anthony Levandowski in the passengers seat. This was the first license issued in the United States for a self-driven car. In late May 2014, Google revealed a new prototype of its driverless car, which had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, being 100% autonomous. In December, they unveiled a fully functioning prototype that they planned to test on San Francisco Bay Area roads beginning in early 2015. Called the Firefly, the car was intended to serve as a platform for experimentation and learning, not mass production. In 2015, co-founder Anthony Levandowski and CTO, Chris Urmson left the project. In August 2015, Google hired former Hyundai Motor executive, John Krafcik, as CEO. In fall 2015, Google provided \\"the world's first fully driverless ride on public roads\\" to a legally blind friend of principal engineer Nathaniel Fairfield. The ride was taken by Steve Mahan, former CEO of the Santa Clara Valley Blind Center, in Austin, Texas. It was the first entirely driverless drive on a public road. It was not accompanied by a test driver or police escort. The car had no steering wheel or floor pedals. By the end of 2015, Project Chauffeur had driven more than a million self-driven miles.  Waymo  In December 2016, the unit was renamed Waymo and spun-off into a new division in Alphabet. The name Waymo was derived from its mission, \\"a new way forward in mobility.\\" Waymo moved to further test its cars on public roads after its spin-out. In 2017, Waymo sued Uber for allegedly stealing trade secrets. A court document revealed Google had spent $1.1 billion on the project between 2009 and 2015. For comparison, the acquisition of Cruise Automation by General Motors in March 2016 was reported at just over $500 million, and Uber's acquisition of Otto in August 2016 was for $680 million. Waymo began testing autonomous minivans without a safety driver on public roads in Chandler, Arizona, in October 2017. In April 2019, Waymo announced plans for vehicle assembly in Detroit at the former American Axle & Manufacturing plant, bringing between 100 and 400 jobs to the area. Waymo will use vehicle assembler Magna to turn Jaguar I-PACE and Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans into Waymo Level 4 autonomous vehicles. Waymo subsequently decided to continue retrofitting existing car models rather than manufacturing a new design like the Firefly. In March 2020, the Alphabet unit formally launched Waymo Via after announcing that it has raised $2.25 billion from a group of investors. In May 2020, Waymo raised an additional $750 million, bringing their total outside investment to $3 billion. In July 2020, they announced an exclusive partnership with auto manufacturer Volvo. Technology A self-driving car with the previous Google branding A Lexus RX450h retrofitted by Google for its self-driving car project In 2017, Waymo unveiled new sensors and chips that are less expensive to manufacture, cameras that improve visibility, and wipers to clear the lidar system. Waymo manufactures a suite of self-driving hardware developed in-house. These sensors and hardware-enhanced vision system, improved radar, and laser-based lidar‚Äîreduce Waymo's dependence on suppliers. The in-house production system allows Waymo to integrate its technology to the hardware efficiently. At the beginning of the self-driving car program, the company spent $75,000 for each lidar system from Velodyne. In 2017, the cost decreased approximately 90 percent, with Waymo designing its own version of lidar. Waymo officials said the cars the company uses are built for full autonomy with sensors that give 360-degree views and lasers that detect objects up to 300 meters away. Short- range lasers detect and focus on objects near the vehicle, while radar is used to see around vehicles and track objects in motion. The interior of these cars includes buttons for riders to control certain functions: \\"help,\\" \\"lock,\\" \\"pull over,\\" and \\"start ride.\\" Waymo engineers have also created a program called Carcraft, a virtual world where Waymo can simulate driving conditions. The simulator was named after the video game World of Warcraft. With Carcraft, 25,000 virtual self-driving cars navigate through models of Austin, Texas, Mountain View, California, Phoenix, Arizona, and other cities. , Waymo has driven more than 5 billion miles in the virtual world. Waymo has created partnerships with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Lyft, AutoNation, Avis, Intel, Jaguar Land Rover, and Volvo. The Waymo project team has equipped various types of cars with the self-driving equipment, including the Toyota Prius, Audi TT, Fiat Chrysler Pacifica, and Lexus RX450h. Google also developed a custom vehicle, approximately 100 of which were assembled by Roush Enterprises with equipment from Bosch, ZF Lenksysteme, LG, and Continental. In May 2016, Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced an order of 100 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to test the self-driving technology. Waymo ordered an additional 500 Pacifica hybrids in 2017, and in late May 2018, Alphabet announced plans to add up to 62,000 Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the fleet. In March 2018, Jaguar Land Rover announced that Waymo had ordered up to 20,000 of its planned electric I-Pace cars at an estimated cost of more than $1 billion. Jaguar is to deliver the first I-Pace prototype later in the year, and the cars are to become part of Waymo's ride-hailing service in 2020. Waymo partnered with Intel to use Intel technologies, such as processors, inside Waymo vehicles. It has deals with Avis and AutoNation for vehicle maintenance. With Lyft, Waymo is partnering on pilot projects and product development. Road testing A Toyota Prius modified to operate as a Google driverless car, navigating a test course By 2018, Waymo had tested its system in six states and 25 cities across the U.S over a span of nine years. In 2009, Google began testing its self-driving cars in the San Francisco Bay Area. Google's vehicles have traversed San Francisco's Lombard Street, famed for its steep hairpin turns, and through city traffic. The cars have driven over the Golden Gate Bridge and around Lake Tahoe. The system operates at the speed limit it has stored on its maps and maintains its distance from other vehicles using its system of sensors.Sheikh, Azzam. \\"Ultrasonic Sensors on Rear Wheels\\", national.co.uk, December 14, 2014 By December 2013, four U.S. states had passed laws permitting autonomous cars: Nevada, Florida, California, and Michigan.Muller, Joann. \\"With Driverless Cars, Once Again It Is California Leading The Way\\", Forbes.com, September 26, 2012 A law proposed in Texas would also allow testing of, \\"autonomous motor vehicles\\".\\"Legislative Session: 83(R) Bill: HB 2932\\", Texas Legislature Online, May 30, 2013Whittington, Mark. \\"Law Proposed in Texas to Require Licensed Driver in Self-Driving Vehicles\\", Yahoo! News, Fri, March 8, 2013 In April 2014, the team announced that their vehicles had logged nearly 700,000 autonomous miles (1.1 million km).The latest chapter for the self-driving car: mastering city street driving, googleblog In June 2015, the team announced that their vehicles had driven over , stating that this was \\"the equivalent of 75 years of typical U.S. adult driving\\", and that in the process they had encountered 200,000 stop signs, 600,000 traffic lights, and 180 million other vehicles. Google also announced its prototype vehicles were being road tested in Mountain View, California.Murphy, Mike. \\"Google's self-driving cars are now on the streets of California\\", Quartz, June 25, 2015 During testing, the prototypes' speed did not exceed and had safety drivers aboard. As a consequence, one of the vehicles was stopped by police for impeding traffic flow. In 2015, Google expanded its road-testing to Texas, where regulations did not prohibit cars without pedals and a steering wheel. Bills were introduced by interested parties to similarly change the legislation in California. Google took its first driverless ride on public roads in October 2015, when Mahan took a 10-minute solo ride around Austin in a Google \\"pod car\\" with no steering wheel or pedals. In 2016, the company expanded its road testing to the dry Phoenix, Arizona, area, and Kirkland, Washington, which has a wet climate. In May 2016, the company opened a 53,000 square foot self-driving technology development center in Novi, Michigan. , Google had test driven its fleet of vehicles, in autonomous mode, a total of . In August 2016 alone, their cars traveled a \\"total of 170,000 miles; of those, 126,000 miles were autonomous (i.e., the car was fully in control)\\". Beginning of 2017, Waymo reported to California DMV a total of 636,868 miles covered by the fleet in autonomous mode, and the associated 124 disengagements, for the period from December 1, 2015, through November 30, 2016.Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement Reports 2016 In November 2017, Waymo altered its Arizona testing by removing safety drivers in the driver position from their autonomous Chrysler Pacificas. The cars were geofenced within a 100 square mile region surrounding Chandler, Arizona. Waymo's early rider program members were the first to take rides using the new technology. Waymo began testing its level 4 autonomous cars in Arizona for several reasons: good weather, simple roads, and lax autonomous vehicle laws. Users hail vehicles through the Waymo app. They also have access to an onboard support system that can connect riders to a Waymo agent. In 2017, Waymo began weather testing in Michigan. Also, in 2017, Waymo unveiled its test facility, Castle, on 91 acres in Central Valley, California. Castle, a former airbase, has served as the project's training course since 2012. According to a Waymo report, as of March 2018, Waymo's self-driving technology had driven more than 5 million miles on public roads and more than 5 billion miles via simulation. Waymo's 25,000 virtual self- driving cars travel 8 million miles per day. By October 2018, Waymo had completed 10 million miles of driving on public roads and over 7 billion simulation miles, and by January 2020, 20 million miles of driving on public roads had been completed. In March 2018, Waymo announced its plans to build additional real-world self-driving experiments with the company's self-driving trucks delivering for sister company Google's data centers located in Atlanta, Georgia. , Waymo was waiting for permits to test the cars in California, hoping to test in Los Altos, Mountain View, Palo Alto, and Sunnyvale. On October 30, 2018, the California Department of Motor Vehicles issued a permit for Waymo to operate fully driverless cars (i.e., cars without human safety drivers). Waymo was the first company to receive a permit, that allows day and night testing on public roads and highways in California. In a blog post, Waymo announced that its fully driverless cars would be restricted to Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Los Altos, and Palo Alto ‚Äî all communities close to parent company Alphabet's headquarters (Googleplex). In July 2019, Waymo was permitted by California regulators to transport passengers in its vehicles. In December 2018, Waymo launched the commercial self-driving car service called \\"Waymo One\\", allowing users in the Phoenix metropolitan area to use an app and request a pick-up. The service uses safety backup drivers who monitor the rides, with a smaller percentage of rides being provided in select areas by fully driverless vehicles. In November 2019, Waymo One was first autonomous service worldwide operating without any safety drivers in the car. The service was paused in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a limited service restarted in June 2020. In September 2020, Waymo announced it had partnered with fellow Alphabet company Verily to provide COVID-19 testing to its front- line employees and partners. Crashes In June 2015, Google confirmed the occurrence of 12 collisions. By July 2015, Google's 23 self-driving cars have been involved in 14 minor collisions on public roads. On February 14, 2016, while creeping forward to a stoplight, a Google self-driving car attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path. During the maneuver, it struck the side of a bus. Google addressed the crash, saying, \\"In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision.\\" Some incomplete video footage of the crash is available. Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. The company also stated, \\"This type of misunderstanding happens between human drivers on the road every day.\\" Google maintained that, in all cases other than the February 2016 incident, the vehicle itself was not at fault because the cars were either being manually driven or the driver of another vehicle was at fault. Google initially maintained monthly reports that include any traffic incidents that its self-driving cars had been involved in. Waymo now publishes its own safety reports. Waymo and other companies are required by the California DMV to report the number of incidents during testing where the human driver took control for safety reasons. Some of these incidents were not reported by Google when simulations indicated the car would have stopped on its own. There is some controversy concerning this distinction between driver- initiated disengagements that Google reports and those that it does not report. Limitations Waymo operates in some of its testing markets, such as Chandler, Arizona, at level 4 autonomy with no one sitting behind the steering wheel, sharing roadways with other drivers and pedestrians. However, more testing is needed. Waymo's earlier testing has focused on areas without harsh weather, extreme density, or complicated road systems, but it has moved on to test under new conditions. As a result, Waymo has begun testing in areas with harsher conditions, such as its winter testing in Michigan. In 2014, a critic wrote in the MIT Technology Review that unmapped stopped lights would cause problems with Waymo's technology and the self-driving technology could not detect potholes. Additionally, the lidar technology cannot spot some potholes or discern when humans, such as a police officers, signal the car to stop, the critic wrote. Waymo has worked to improve how its technology responds in construction zones. Commercialization In 2012, Brin stated that Google Self-Driving cars would be available for the general public in 2017. In 2014, this schedule was updated by project director Chris Urmson to indicate a possible release from 2017 to 2020. In December 2016, Waymo CEO John Krafcik stated in a blog post, \\"We can see our technology being useful in personal vehicles, ridesharing, logistics, or solving last mile problems for public transport. Our next step as Waymo will be to let people use our vehicles to do everyday things like run errands, commute to work, or get safely home after a night on the town.\\" Temporary use of vehicles is known as Transportation as a Service (TaaS). Waymo highlighted four specific business uses for its autonomous tech in 2017: Ridesharing, users can hail cars equipped with Waymo technology via transportation network company apps; trucking and logistics, urban last-mile solutions for public transportation, and passenger cars. In 2017, Waymo was also considering licensing autonomous technology to vehicle manufacturers. In May 2018, Waymo established a subsidiary in Shanghai, Huimo Business Consulting, with $441,000 of funding.  Robo-taxis  In August 2013, news reports surfaced about Robo-Taxi, a proposed driverless vehicle taxicab service from Google. These reports re- appeared again in early 2014, following the granting of a patent to Google for an advertising fee funded transportation service which included autonomous vehicles as a transport method. Google consultant Larry Burns says self- driving, taxi-like vehicles \\"should be viewed as a new form of public transportation\\". In April 2017, Waymo launched an early rider program in Phoenix, Arizona, which signed up 400 users to try out a test edition of Waymo's transportation service. Over the next year, 400 riders used the Waymo service, providing feedback. In May 2018, Waymo announced that it plans to allow everyone in Phoenix to request a driverless ride before the end of the year. On December 5, 2018, the company launched a commercial self-driving car service called \\"Waymo One\\"; users in the Phoenix metropolitan area use an app to request a pick-up. By November 2019, the service was operating autonomous vehicles without a safety backup driver, the first autonomous service worldwide operating without safety drivers in the car.  Trucking and delivery  \\"Waymo Via\\" is the trucking division of Waymo. Using the same sensors and software as Waymo's other autonomous vehicles, Class 8 tractor- trailers began testing Waymo's self-driving technology in California and Arizona in 2017. In 2018, Waymo launched a pilot program with Google to use autonomous trucks to move freight to its sister company's Atlanta-area data centers. According to a Transport Topics news article, \\"Waymo does not intend to get into truck manufacturing or shipping services. Instead, it wants to work with OEMs and motor carriers to get its technology into vehicles.\\" In October 2019, CEO John Krafcik stated that Waymo was fleshing out the trucking side of the business, and that self-driving commercial business vehicles might catch on faster than the ride-hailing robotaxi service. In June 2020, Waymo announced its plans to focus testing efforts on southwest shipping routes including, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. Waymo has also expanded the use of their self-driving technology to commercial delivery vehicles. In January 2020 the company announced a pilot program with United Parcel Service, where Waymo vehicles transfer packages from UPS stores to a UPS sorting facility. This process allows packages at the UPS stores to be moved more rapidly into the UPS delivery system, instead of waiting to pick them up at the end of the day. In March 2020 the company formally launched \\"Waymo Via\\" for trucking and delivery, after raising $2.25 billion from outside investors. In July 2020 Waymo and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced an expansion of their partnership, including the development of level 4 autonomous Ram ProMaster delivery vehicles. In August 2020 the company added a new trucking hub in Dallas, Texas, to test their fleet of Peterbilt trucks in various commercial settings.  Waymo LLC v. Uber Technologies, Inc. et al.  In February 2017, Waymo sued Uber and its subsidiary self-driving trucking company, Otto, for allegedly stealing trade secrets and patent infringment. The company claimed that three ex-Google employees, including Anthony Levandowski, had stolen trade secrets, including thousands of driverless car technology files from Google, before joining Uber. The infringement is related to Waymo's proprietary lidar technology, which could measure the distances between objects using laser and create their three-dimensional representations. Google accused Uber of colluding with Levandowski to obtain information about its lidar and other technologies in its driverless car project. The former Google engineer downloaded 9 gigabytes of data that included over a hundred trade secrets; eight were at stake during the trial. The trial began on February 5, 2018, and was dismissed on February 9, as a settlement was announced with Uber giving Waymo 0.34 percent of Uber's stock, the equivalent of $245 million in Uber equity and agreeing to ensure Uber does not infringe Waymo's intellectual property. Part of the agreement included a guarantee that \\"Waymo confidential information is not being incorporated in Uber Advanced Technologies Group hardware and software.\\"Larson, 2018. In released statements after the settlement, Uber maintained that it received no trade secrets. In May, according to the statement from Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, Uber had fired Levandowski, which resulted in a loss of roughly $250 million of his own equity in Uber and this value almost exactly equalled to the stock value Uber paid to Waymo LLC.

It is one of the most famous and most popular compositions of the Divine Liturgy in Serbian art and is officially recognized as part of the service in the Serbian Orthodox Church. Mokranjac intended to compose a liturgy based on motives of all eight modes of Serbian chant, but he wrote only the Liturgy after the first mode. Written after the Serbian folk chant from the end of the 18th century, it bears witness to the author's ability to form a fine entity by stylizing those tunes. His way of harmonizing them, with frequent use of chords of secondary scale degrees, resulted in an archaic though distinctly Slavonic style, and his ingenious use of polyphonic elements enhanced the expressiveness of each note of the melodic line.

Such organizations have been organized by those who espouse conspiracy theories regarding certain events or the individuals who are accused by the citizen grand jury, and most citizen grand jury applications to official judiciary systems at the federal, state, or local and municipal level tend to be thrown out for lack of evidence. Modern citizen grand juries were organized in the 2000s to accuse government officials of complicity in the September 11 attacks, and others were organized in the late 2000s and early 2010s regarding the accuracy of President Barack Obama's \\"natural birth\\" as a U.S. citizen. 9/11 citizen grand juries World Trade Center Building 7 on fire before its collapse on 9/11 The earliest so-called 9/11 citizen grand jury, the 23-member \\"Los Angeles Citizens' Grand Jury on the Crimes of 9/11/01,\\" was organized in 2004 by activist Lynne Pentz.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Eudo Dapifer is shown as owner of the manor. All Saints' Church, originally built in about 1115 and restored in the 18th century, also lies within the park grounds. The property, recorded as a 'deer park' in 1342,http://www.braxtedpark.co.uk/history.cfm was held by a series of Essex families including those by the names of Anesty, Montchensy, Valence, Hastings, Grey, Montgomery, Ayloff and Maynard. The lands were purchased by Thomas Darcy in 1650 from the estate of the then Countess of Pembroke. Braxted Lodge was built on the property in 1680 by Darcy's son. During his ownership, the property was enlarged and landscaped, with several large man-made ponds being added, including one that is now visible from the main house and is referred to as 'the lake'. In 1745, the estate was purchased from the Darcy family by Peter Du Cane, Sr. of nearby Coggeshall, a wealthy cloth merchant, trader and businessman descended from noble Huguenot ancestors by the name of 'Du Quesne'.note: a branch of the Du Quesne family, being the same family as Louis XIV's famous naval commander and decorated admiral, Abraham Duquesne, Marquis du Bouchet (c. 1610 ‚Äì February 2, 1688), had fled Flanders for England due to religious persecution in 1568. The first arrivals originally settled in Canterbury prior to establishing themselves in London - (see: Jean Du Quesne, the elder) Having moved the family to Essex, where he had become High Sheriff and Member of Parliament for Colchester, Du Cane ultimately settled the family at Braxted Park in 1751. Du Cane, a director of the Bank of England and the East India Company, reconstructed and enlarged the house around 1760, assisted by Isaac Ware, Thomas James and Robert Taylor (architect).http://www.braxtedpark.co.uk/history.cfm Du Cane thoroughly landscaped and upgraded the property, more than doubling its size. The property passed to Peter Du Cane (II), then 62, when his father died at the age of 90 in 1803. He accomplished even more improvements and alterations to the building and grounds, bringing the main house and gardens largely to their present state. Peter Du Cane (III) inherited the property in 1823 and continued to add to the holdings, including the restoration of the church (including the building of the Du Cane Family crypt) and the addition of several other buildings. In 1841, Charles Du Cane acceded to the property on the death of his cousin Peter, who had by then already formally changed its name to 'Braxted Park'. Member of Parliament for Maldon from 1852 to 1854 and for Essex North from 1857 to 1868, Du Cane served as civil Lord of the Admiralty for two years. Sir Charles was appointed Governor of Tasmania from 1868 to 1874 and died on the estate in 1889. Braxted Park was acquired by Sir William Boulton, 1st Baronet, from the Du Cane family in 1919. The Boulton Baronetcy of Braxted Park was created in 1944. The Boulton family sold the estate to The Plessey Company in 1947. Sir Allen George Clark, chairman of the company, and his descendants have been its occupants to the present day. At present there is a disused Victorian school on the Estate.

The company was notable for family films and documentaries, and was purchased by Taft Broadcasting in 1980. History Sunn Classic was located in Park City, Utah, with offices in nearby Salt Lake City; its company name added an extra \\"n\\" to the word \\"Sun\\" for legal reasons. The founder, Rayland Jensen, previously handled distribution of American National Enterprises' 1968 release, Alaskan Safari, which spent five years at the North American box office. In 1971, Jensen began his new company at the request of employees from the Schick razor company, at the time a subsidiary of Warner-Lambert.safetyrazors.net: Schick Injector razors During its tenure, Sunn Classic spent US$85,000 in pre-production research on each of its films, conducting phone surveys and interviews with potential viewers. According to Bruce A. Austin, \\"Sunn identified as its market working-class families who rarely went to the movies more than twice a year\\". In the midst of the research, it released films with an MPAA rating of G, and in heavily marketed limited engagements. Through a process called four wall distribution (or \\"four-walling\\"), the company would rent theaters to show its films, and retained all of the box office receipts. Sunn Classic specialized in family entertainment such as 1974's The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams, and its subsequent spin-off television series on the NBC network. The Outer Space Connection was released in 1975. This documentary was produced by Alan Landsburg but was distributed by Sunn Classic. By 1977, domestic sales for Grizzly Adams reached upwards of US$24 million; another Sunn release, In Search of Noah's Ark, made US$26 million. For 1977's The Lincoln Conspiracy, the company departed from its normal four wall distribution strategy to demand up-front guarantees from theatres. Among its other titles were 1979's In Search of Historic Jesus and 1983's Cujo. The company also ran a television unit in tandem with its film department. Most of the company's 1970's productions were produced by Charles E. Sellier Jr and several were directed by the young (at the time) director James L. Conway and both would go on to long careers in the entertainment industry. In July 1980, the company and two Schick divisions were purchased by Cincinnati-based Taft Enterprises for over US$2.5 million. Eventually, the new owner christened Sunn Classic as Taft International Pictures. However, after Carl Lindner, Jr. purchased Taft in 1987 and restructured it into Great American Broadcasting, the studio ceased operations. By the 2000s, the media and property assets of the original Sunn Classics were under new management. Jensen and another fellow employee, Clair Farley, formed Jensen Farley Pictures; one of their early releases was 1981's Private Lessons. Currently Sunn Classic's library is owned by ViacomCBS subsidiary Paramount Pictures through Melange Pictures. However, very few films from that library have seen a DVD or Blu-ray release; those that have are mostly the later larger-budgeted Taft productions such as Cujo, Hangar 18, and The Boogens although some of their TV shows like The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams have been released on DVD. Like with almost all the Melange Pictures owned films, Olive Films owns the home video rights to the catalog.

Places of interest=New Hope-Lebanon Between New Hope and Lebanon the line passes through a number of small towns that provide basic services and also a variety of interesting historic sites. These include churches in New Hope and St. Francis, and the Maker's Mark Distillery near Loretto. The largest town in this section is Lebanon, which has a restored downtown area with many historic buildings housing shops and restaurants. The railroad right of way passes one block behind the main street and is intact, being used as a parking area. Lebanon-Stanford Between Lebanon and Stanford the rail line passes through several small towns along the border between the Outer Bluegrass and the Knobs. Just west of Stanford the line passes near the site of historic Fort Logan. Though presently undeveloped, there are plans in the county for developing this as a historic site. In Stanford, they have successfully restored the Louisville & Nashville RR depot as a museum and community center. Also at the depot site are a playground, picnic gazebo, restored caboose and maintenance of way car, and a short walking trail on the right way. East of Stanford East of Stanford the line passes through what has become the new lake formed by the impoundment of Cedar Creek. This project was finished in 2002 and will provide boating, fishing, and other recreational opportunities. If a trail were to be developed, it would have to be rerouted from the original right of way, but it could be a vital part of this new recreational and natural area. Just east of this lake is the historic William Whitley house. It is a state historic site and is open as a museum and park with a playground, picnic shelter, and restrooms. The line is intact and fairly clear as it passes this site. Between the Whitley house and Mt. Vernon the line passes through a few small communities that offer restaurants, shops, and convenience stores. There are a number of creek crossings that offer lovely views, however the bridges have been removed. The last thru train passed here in July 1986, after which, the line was ripped out almost overnight from 10 ft west of Main Street, to Popes Creek Rd area, Lebanon KY. Remain trackage was used to serve the grain mill on far east Main St, as well as car storage on downtown sidings near the depot. Track from Stanford to near Mt. Vernon were removed around 1993.

This has been compared to an arms race between sexes. In many cases, male mating behavior is detrimental to the female's fitness. For example, when insects reproduce by means of traumatic insemination, it is very disadvantageous to the female's health. During mating, males will try to inseminate as many females as possible, however, the more times a female's abdomen is punctured, the less likely she is to survive. Females that possess traits to avoid multiple matings will be more likely to survive, resulting in a change in morphology. In males, genitalia is relatively simple and more likely to vary among generations compared to female genitalia. This results in a new trait that females have to avoid in order to survive. Additionally, sexual antagonistic co-evolution can be the cause of rapid evolution, as is thought to be the case in seminal proteins known as Acps in species of Drosophila melanogaster. While Acps facilitate the mutually beneficial outcome of increased progeny production, several Acps have detrimental effects on female fitness as they are toxic and shorten her lifespan. This leads to antagonistic co-evolution, as the female must evolve in order to defend herself. When female Drosophila melanogaster are experimentally prevented from co-evolving with males, males rapidly adapt to the static female phenotype. This male adaptation leads to a reduction in female survivorship, which is mediated by an increased rate of remating and increased toxicity of Acps in seminal fluid. Since non-reproductive proteins do not feel the same evolutionary pressure as Acps, they are not evolving nearly as quickly. Consistent with the arms race theory, DNA analyses reveal a two-fold increase in Acp divergence relative to non-reproductive proteins Female co-evolution For many females, reproduction can be very dangerous and disadvantageous as in the case of bed bugs mentioned previously. Therefore, females who possess traits where they can lessen the impacts of male behavior are the ones who will survive and go on to reproduce. There are many ways a female can \\"defend\\" herself to the onslaught of potential mates. Spermatheca/pseudospermatheca Females have a very complex and an extremely variable reproductive system, commonly known as a spermatheca. Some species do not have a spermatheca in the traditional sense, but do possess pseudospermatheca. Both forms play an essential role in sperm storage and fertilization. In the family Tingidae, pseudospermatheca are located at the base of the oviduct and are hypothesized to have functioned as spermatheca at one point in time. They now serve as storage units for sperm, where a female can introduce the stored sperm to her eggs when she finds it optimal. It is this factor that has put females in the driver seat of evolution. These organs give females the ability to pick and choose which sperm they will use to fertilize their eggs. Males now have another factor they need to overcome. In the case of D. melanogaster, females will mate multiple times and then expel the excess sperm that she does not need. However, neither the first or second mate know if it his sperm that was dispelled, because at any postcopulatory moment a female can store the sperm of more than one male. Enzymes secreted by females Enzymes secreted by female reproductive tracts may also play a role in sexual antagonistic coevolution with males. In Drosophila species, a large group of enzymes known as serine proteases have been associated with female sperm storage organs (most notably, the spermatheca) through genetic sequencing and analysis. It is hypothesized that these proteases break down various proteins in male seminal fluid. This would result in females choosing for males that can overcome these digestive enzymes, whether through genetic variation or physiological ability to produce greater quality or quantity of sperm. Behavior Before a male even has to begin worrying if the female will use his sperm or not, he must mate with her, which can be a problem within itself. Potential mates often play a game of persistence and resistance. In the case of water striders (genus Gerris) males will harass females and try to grasp them by chasing and lunging at them. Females can be extremely evasive and often fend off these aggressive attacks. Even when a female is finally grasped she continues to struggle. However, this type of avoidance is very costly to a female, so she ends up having to balance the cost of mating and the cost of resistance. However, in species with singly mating females like the fly Prochyliza xanthostoma, the cost of resisting mating is low relative to the benefit of evading a low quality male. Male co-evolution Like females, males have developed responses to counter evolutionary adaptations of the opposite sex. Responses in insects can vary in both genitalia and sperm structures, along with variations in behavior. Spiny genitalia Male genitalia evolve more rapidly and divergently in animals. Spiny genitalia can aid in male-male competition. In seed beetles, spiny genitalia help with anchor during copulation and allow a rapid passage to the female's reproductive tract, thus overcoming female barriers to sperm. Females suffer costs as a result of injuries, but males do not benefit directly from harm inflicted on their mates. Damage, such as scarring, increases in the female tract with the number of matings. In seed beetles, a positive correlation exists between the degree of harmfulness of the male's genitalia and the thickness or reinforcement of the wall of the bursa copulatrix in the female's reproductive tract. As a result, females‚Äô connective tissue in the copulatory tract increased in thickness. However, females with a thicker copulatory tract correlated positively to the amount of scarring, suggesting that scarring is a poor measure of costs for females. Females have evolved in other ways such as investing in immunocapacity to help with trauma associated during copulation. Copulation Male bed bugs have a unique way to copulate called traumatic insemination. Males use their intromittent organ to stab and inseminate females through their abdominal wall even though females contain a genital tract. Male bed bugs can also adjust their ejaculate volume and time of copulation through the presence of ejaculates in females to conserve sperm and determine paternity outcomes. Females have evolved a paragenital system to counter traumatic inseminations. The paragenital system contains a mesospermalege where sperm is deposited. The sperm migrates through the blood to the sperm storage site and oviducts, and then to the ovaries to fertilize eggs. Female bed bugs have also evolved physiological by the presence of phagocytic cells in the mesospermalege that ingest sperm after mating. Development time Selection on development time is often sexually antagonistic. In seed beetles, populations differed in development time and growth rate between sexes. Population fitness is not significant to either body size or growth rate, but variation in development time was significantly related to population fitness. In females, genes associated with long development time lead to high fecundity and mate immediately upon eclosion. Males have shorter development time and emerge early (protandry) resulting in greater fertilization opportunities. Sperm tail length Competition between differing male phenotypes also exists at the microscale level. It has been found in Drosophila that there is a positive correlation between the length of male sperm tails and the size of the seminal receptacle found in females. It has been found that females with larger seminal receptacles ‚Äúchoose‚Äù sperm with long tails over sperm with short tails. Although females seem to ‚Äúfavor‚Äù this trait, no reproductive advantage for long tails has been found except for better correspondence to females with large seminal receptacles. This discrimination is reminiscent of the Fisherian runaway model, as females may choose for long tails based solely on inherited desirability, and would want to pass on that trait, which would improve the sexual success of their male progeny. This also could be an example of the ‚Äúgood genes‚Äù model of sexual selection, as correlations have been found between sperm tail length and the physiological condition of the male.  Flexibility of genitalia  In the case of the Neriid fly, Telostylinus angusticollis, males have been observed to have coevolved to have a flexible aedeagus. In this species females have coiled oviducts that lead to the spermatheca that in turn make it hard for males to reach the area needed to release their sperm. Once copulation is initiated the males are able to unfold their aedeagus and use its flexibility to maneuver the coiled oviducts.

Early life Howard left school at the age of fourteen to become a bookbinder. He established his own stationery business at the age of nineteen. He became involved in Conservative politics before the First World War, and was a supporter of the Tariff Reform League. During the war he fought on the Western Front, and was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for conspicuous gallantry at the Battle of Cambrai. He ended the war with the rank of sergeant major. Local elections In 1922 he fought his first election, winning a seat on Finsbury Borough Council, serving until 1925. In 1925 he was elected to the London County Council as one of two councillors representing Islington South. He was a member of the Municipal Reform Party, the Conservative-backed group that held a majority on the county council. He lost his county council seat at the next election in 1928, but regained it in 1931, before being unseated again in 1934. Parliamentary elections Howard first contested an election to the House of Commons in 1924 as Conservative candidate for Islington South. He failed to be elected, and contested the seat in 1929, again without success. On his third attempt he was elected MP for Islington South at the 1931 general election, benefiting from a collapse in the Labour vote. At the next election in 1935 the Labour Party regained the seat. Howard continued to contest elections up to his death: at Islington South in 1945, at a 1947 by-election at Islington West in 1947, and at Islington South West in 1950 and 1951. He was President of the Islington South West Conservative Association at the time of his death, aged 64, in a London hospital in 1953.

He was educated at King Alfred School in North London (1963‚Äì76) and then joined the Economist newspaper, in the distribution department. After two years he left to join the Henson Organisation, working on The Muppet Show and Dark Crystal. Auerbach then worked on the TV film 'Haunted', in the USA before returning to the UK and the editing department of the BBC. After a year in the cutting rooms working on strands such as Arena, Omnibus and Horizon he began to direct items on the arts magazine programme Review. There followed films on rock music, photography, Voodoo, football and major documentaries about London, the art market and filmed portraits of artists. In 1992 he left the BBC to become an independent Producer/Director. Auerbach now runs his own company, Jake Auerbach Films Ltd.

Nidaros was started on 1 May 1902. Its first editor was former Dagsposten editor H√•kon L√∏ken, and with its Liberal Party affiliation Nidaros became the largest newspaper in Trondheim, with a circulation of 20‚Äì30,000. Among the political disputes of the time were electrification of the city's tramway system, establishment of a technical institution in Trondheim, the Norwegian Institute of Technology, and the eventual Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. L√∏ken left in 1909. From 1910 to 1911 Atle √ògaard was editor, and Kr. Aug. Retvedt took over from 1911 to 1917. Hj√∏rvard Torsvik edited the newspaper from 1917 to 1930. Olav R√∏geberg was chief editor from 1930 to 1937, and Fr. L√ºtzow Holm edited Nidaros from 1937 to 1941. A great success was the feuilleton B√∏r B√∏rson, Johan Falkberget's satirical story from the boom period during World War I, which was printed in the newspaper before being released as a book. The newspaper became less popular during and after the city naming controversy, when the name of the city Trondhjem was changed to Nidaros, and then among popular protest changed a second time to Trondheim. The anti-Nidaros activists did not like that the newspaper Nidaros retained its name. The newspaper was stopped on 17 April 1941 during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. After the war it was published as Trondheims-Pressen from 9 May to 12 May. It started again on 14 May 1945. Nidaros was among the three initiators to establish a working committee for the stopped newspapers (), along with Arbeiderbladet and Dagen. The newspapers, which had all been stopped during the war, had suffered significant losses because of this, and claimed compensation. Around sixty Norwegian newspapers eventually joined this initiative. In Trondheim, the newspaper situation had changed dramatically over the war years. Adresseavisen and Dagsposten had continued their publication during the Nazi regime, while Nidaros and Arbeider-Avisa were stopped. K√•re Fasting was chief editor from 1945 to 1950, and Gunnar Garbo edited Nidaros from 1954 to 1957, when Nidaros ceased to appear. Garbo then issued a weekly newspaper S√∏ndagsekspressen, \\"loosely affiliated\\" with Nidaros, from February to August 1957. Nidaros started again on 28 February 1959. It changed its name to Trondheimsavisa in February 1989 before ultimately going bankrupt in 1991.

It is located on the border with Tanzania on the confluence of the Ruvuma River and the Lugenda River. Negomano was the scene of fierce battle between the German Army and the Portuguese Army during World War I, in November/December 1917 when several hundred soldiers were killed. Development initiatives launched subsequent to civil war of 1992 has resulted in economic progress in Negomano, which is part of the Niassa Reserve. Further, a four country initiative of Malawi, Mozambique, the northern and eastern provinces of Zambia, and the southern regions of the United Republic of Tanzania) has resulted in the creation of the long Unity Bridge across the Ruvuma River at Negomano. History The Negomano area was occupied during the Early Iron Age by early hunter-gatherers. Modern tribes in the area can be traced to the southern shores of Lake Malawi who moved into the Rovuma River valley in the medieval period to escape severe drought. Due to its strategical location, a military post was located at Negomano, which was in contact with the town of Meculu. During the Portuguese occupation, two expatriate officers were located in Negomano district to ensure that the local farmers met their quota of cotton production and complied with the standards set by the senior bureaucrats in the capital, Lourenco Marques (Maputo). Germans who had colonial designs on Mozambique, particularly its northern region, by diplomatic coercion had obtained border concessions from Portugal by annexing the mouth of the Rovuma River and even established their commune at Quionga. This ambition got a boost during the World War I when they launched a full- scale war on Mozambique, which resulted in Portuguese getting defeated initially. However, with great investment of manpower and material, the Germans could be eventually defeated by the British and the Portuguese Army. A battle took place at Negomano on November 25, 1917 between the Germans and the Portuguese during World War I. In the river valley and the Nissa Wild Life Preserve enclosed within it, German Army supported by Askaris, under the command of General Paul Erich von Lettow-Vorbeck, crossed the Ruvuma River at Negomano and entered the Portuguese held Mozambique in search of food for his troops. In December 1917, after crossing the river, the general with his army marched south along the Lugenda River and arrived at Metarica. One of the battalions dispatched towards the Mecula Mountain in search of food had to fight a fierce battle with the Portuguese who were led by Major Jo√£o Teixeira Pinto. The Portuguese force was comprehensively defeated. Witness to this battle are seen in the form of a few graves on the hill slopes at Mecula, the district capital of Niassa. The Germans defeated a Portuguese force of some 1200 men at Negomano and seized valuable supplies, including 250,000 rounds, six machine guns and medicine. During this battle known as \\"Battle of Negomano\\", following the defeat of Portuguese Army by the German Army, 550 soldiers were taken prisoners. Negomano was occupied during the war in 1976 when a mine exploded from the village. Two soldiers were seriously wounded and had to be flown out by helicopter. Ethnicity and culture The Makonde ethnic tribe is the dominant tribal group residing in the Cabo Delgado Province where Negomano is a village. Mekondes‚Äô have a strong and unique culture with an innate talent for wood and ivory carving. Ancestral customs of ritual tattooing and teeth filing are still practiced by them., mirror site The historical Namachakole trench (Lilondo suburb) where the tombs of 11 Frelimo fighters killed in combat at Negomano are buried is a tourist attraction in Mueda district. The other attraction is of wild life safaris originating from Negomano. Ecology and community development Following the end of civil war in 1992 in Mozambique, community conservation initiatives were launched involving local communities, NGOs, and private sector. One such initiative instituted by the Government of Mozambique was specific to the Niassa Reserve titled the ‚ÄúNiassa Reserve Community-Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM),‚Äù which covered three villages within the reserve namely, Negomano, Mussoma and Naulala. Investment funds and expertise required over the period of project implementation were provided under a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed in 2001 between the Sociedade para Gest√£o e Desenvolvimento da Reserva do Niassa (SGDRN) and WWF Southern Africa Regional Office (SARPO). The Norwegian Agency for Development and Cooperation (NORAD) funded the project, which was implemented by WWF Norway and the WWF SARPO, through WWF Mozambique in association with SGDRN, over the period from 2001 to 2005. This project has been reportedly assessed as successful in achieving the framework of defined objectives. The achievements reported are: Establishing community-based organizations; addressing the animal human conflicts issues through training and evolving suitable techniques for reducing such conflicts; creating better knowledge base to the staff operating the programmes with due regard to community sensitivities, develop income generating initiatives such as establishing honey and fishing user groups; appraising the community of the stated objectives of the project and creating a trust between the community and the administrators of the reserve. Transport When David Livingstone had visited the area in 1858 it had ended his hopes of building a highway. However, a bridge, known as Unity Bridge has been built in the vicinity connecting Mozambique to Tanzania across the river Mourama. It is one of the development projects planned under the Mtwara Corridor Spatial Development Initiative. This project titled ‚ÄúA new development corridor‚Äù as a four country initiative (to benefit Malawi, Mozambique, the northern and eastern provinces of Zambia, and the southern regions of the United Republic of Tanzania) in the heart of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) was launched in 2004 signed under a legal framework that should make the Mtwara Development Corridor a reality and improve the lives of the people who live in these four countries. The initiative to build this bridge, across the Ruvuma River at Negomano, also known as the \\"Unity Bridge 1\\" began in 1975. However, a formal agreement between Tanzania and Mozambique was signed on October 10, 2005. The bridge, as designed by Norconsult, 750 m long, was finally completed in 2010. It was formally inaugurated on May 12, 2010, by the presidents of Mozambique and Tanzania. This bridge will be a forerunner for the projects planned under the Mtwara Corridor. It also reduces the distance along the Cape to Cairo Road. The main place of entry into Negomano on the Mozambique side is via a dirt road to the south east, which connects to the nearest major town of Mueda, which is linked by air via Mueda Airport. The town of Lugenda is located down river to the southwest of Negomano. Negomano reportedly has one school of about 100 children and a small hospital.

Marriott was born in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York. He currently resides in Seattle, Washington. Biography Pete Marriott is a Brooklyn born record producer and DJ. He surrounded himself with music since youth, with the recording studio becoming a makeshift babysitter when his uncle's reggae band did recording sessions. It was then that Marriott became his uncle's assistant engineer. While merely pushing buttons to communicate between the studio and control room, it widened his curiosity of the recording studio environment. At the age of 15, Marriott was paid for his first music production. His entry into the studio also coincided with many rappers getting into the rap music business for the first time. One of the first records he worked on was The Boogie Boys 1987 track \\"I'm Comin'\\" (Capitol), credited as one of the suppliers of \\"scratches.\\" A year later, he found himself on The Choice MC's \\"Let's Make Some Noise\\" b/w \\"This Is The B-Side\\" (Idlers), the latter featuring a young Chubb Rock. The Marriott-produced \\"This Is The B-Side\\" became an immediate cult favorite among DJ's who would make it an important part of their DJ sets for years because of the sound that many feel was ahead of its time. The song was also sampled by, among others, Moby and Photek. Marriott did not limit himself as a studio mainstay, his history in hip-hop radio is worth a chapter or two. Upon becoming a guest DJ for the DNA/Hank Love show on WMWK 105.9FM, it would lead to having his own show with Merc called H20. The end of that stint lead to another guest DJ spot, this time on Planet Brooklyn with Big Pete and G-Man, before claiming another show on his own, The Hip-Hop Cafe (WKRB). That would lead to doing a show called e Breaking Point (WBCR) with Doug Money, who would later work for Myspace music. By working through the roughs and Tri-State area, Marriott was able to become a tastemaker. The nature of networking would soon change by the mid-1990s, and he soon found a home on the World Wide Web. As the internet and its many music communities grew, Marriott expanded his work, knowledge, and expertise online. Through working with and embracing new studio equipment and technology, he shares his expertise through online video courses. He did these long before the existence of YouTube or Vimeo, allowing fans and studio junkies to see his work from the ground up, one of the first artist/musician/producers to do so on a regular basis. After years of working in various NYC recording studios and producing major and indie releases (including \\"Me Done\\", a song by longtime Slits member Ari Up), Marriott is currently expanding his new Seattle based studio, The Tool Shed, a hybrid studio which incorporates vintage analog and state of the art digital recording technology. The Tool Shed is also headquarters of his production company, Illogical Industries, LLC. Marriott is currently producing and mixing new recording projects through two music outlets: The BRKLYN Collection, and Beat Hollow Records. He also plans to work on sound design projects for other producers as well as creating scores for the television, film, and the gaming industries.

In cryptography, variable-length plaintext messages often have to be padded (expanded) to be compatible with the underlying cryptographic primitive. The attack relies on having a \\"padding oracle\\" who freely responds to queries about whether a message is correctly padded or not. Padding oracle attacks are mostly associated with CBC mode decryption used within block ciphers. Padding modes for asymmetric algorithms such as OAEP may also be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. Symmetric cryptography In symmetric cryptography, the padding oracle attack can be applied to the CBC mode of operation, where the \\"oracle\\" (usually a server) leaks data about whether the padding of an encrypted message is correct or not. Such data can allow attackers to decrypt (and sometimes encrypt) messages through the oracle using the oracle's key, without knowing the encryption key. Padding oracle attack on CBC encryption The standard implementation of CBC decryption in block ciphers is to decrypt all ciphertext blocks, validate the padding, remove the PKCS7 padding, and return the message's plaintext. If the server returns an \\"invalid padding\\" error instead of a generic \\"decryption failed\\" error, the attacker can use the server as a padding oracle to decrypt (and sometimes encrypt) messages. File:CBC decryption.svg The mathematical formula for CBC decryption is :P_i = D_K(C_i) \\\\oplus C_{i-1}, :C_0 = IV. As depicted above, CBC decryption XORs each plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block. As a result, a single-byte modification in block C_1 will make a corresponding change to a single byte in P_2. Suppose the attacker has two ciphertext blocks C_1, C_2 and they want to decrypt the second block to get plaintext P_2. The attacker changes the last byte of C_1 (creating C_1') and sends (IV,C_1',C_2) to the server. The server then returns whether or not the padding of the last decrypted block (P_2') is correct (equal to 0x01). If the padding is correct, the attacker now knows that the last byte of D_K(C_2) \\\\oplus C_1' is \\\\mathrm{0x01}. Therefore, D_K(C_2) = C_1' \\\\oplus \\\\mathrm{0x01}. If the padding is incorrect, the attacker can change the last byte of C_1' to the next possible value. At most, the attacker will need to make 256 attempts (one guess for every possible byte) to find the last byte of P_2. If the decrypted block contains padding information or bytes used for padding then an additional attempt will need to be made to resolve this ambiguity. After determining the last byte of P_2, the attacker can use the same technique to obtain the second-to-last byte of P_2. The attacker sets the last byte of P_2 to \\\\mathrm{0x02} by setting the last byte of C_1 to D_K(C_2) \\\\oplus \\\\mathrm{0x02}. The attacker then uses the same approach described above, this time modifying the second-to-last byte until the padding is correct (0x02, 0x02). If a block consists of 128 bits (AES, for example), which is 16 bytes, the attacker will obtain plaintext P_2 in no more than 255‚ãÖ16 = 4080 attempts. This is significantly faster than the 2^{128} attempts required to bruteforce a 128-bit key. Encrypting messages with Padding oracle attack (CBC-R)  CBC-R turns a decryption oracle into an encryption oracle, and is primarily demonstrated against padding oracles. Using padding oracle to get dK(Ci), and attacker control Ci‚àí1. Attacker can produce any plaintext. To generate a ciphertext that is N blocks long, attacker must perform N numbers of padding oracle attacks. These attacks are chained together so that proper plaintext is constructed in reverse order, from end of message to beginning message (IV). In each step, padding oracle attack is used to construct the IV to the previous choosen ciphertext. CBC-R pseudocode 1\\\\. choose a plaintext message P0...Pn‚àí1 that you want to encrypt. 2\\\\. pick a random Cn‚àí1. 3\\\\. for i = n‚àí1 down to 1: Ci‚àí1 = Pi ‚äï d√∞(Ci) 4\\\\.

Concrete instantiations of the attack were later realised against SSL. and IPSec... It was also applied to several web frameworks, including JavaServer Faces, Ruby on Rails and ASP.NET as well as other software, such as the Steam gaming client. In 2012 it was shown to be effective against some hardened security devices. While these earlier attacks were fixed by most TLS implementors following its public announcement, a new variant, the Lucky Thirteen attack, published in 2013, used a timing side-channel to re-open the vulnerability even in implementations that had previously been fixed. As of early 2014, the attack is no longer considered a threat in real-life operation, though it is still workable in theory (see signal-to-noise ratio) against a certain class of machines. , the most active area of development for attacks upon cryptographic protocols used to secure Internet traffic are downgrade attack, such as Logjam. For further information see https://www.weakdh.org . and Export RSA/FREAK; see https://www.freakattack.com for more information. attacks, which trick clients into using less-secure cryptographic operations provided for compatibility with legacy clients when more secure ones are available. An attack called POODLE; for further information, see https://www.poodle.io (late 2014) combines both a downgrade attack (to SSL 3.0) with a padding oracle attack on the older, insecure protocol to enable compromise of the transmitted data. In May 2016 it has been revealed in that the fix against Lucky Thirteen in OpenSSL introduced another padding oracle.

Saint Patapios‚Äô memory is celebrated on 8 December (main celebration) and also at the Tuesday 2 days after the Sunday of Easter (in memory of the day that his relic was discovered). His relic is kept at the female monastery of Saint Patapios at Loutraki, a spa town near Athens, Greece. Biography Patapios was born in the 4th century A.D. in Thebes, Egypt, to wealthy Christian parents. Patapios, at a young age, lived the life of a hermit in the desert. Many visited him to take his advice and to listen to his preaching. Later in his life, Patapios left Thebes and the desert for Constantinople. There he met two other ascetics, Varas and Ravoulas, who both became saints. Saint Ravoulas was hermit at the gate of Romanos. Saint Varas built the monastery of St John the Baptist at Petrion. Patapios lived at the area of Blachernae at the Xero Oros (dry mountain) and he established a monastery, the Monastery of the Egyptians, where he eventually died. Veneration of his relic Patapios' relic after the destruction of the Monastery of the Egyptians in 536 AD was transferred by Saint Varas to the Monastery of Saint John at Petrion, which during the last centuries of the Byzantine Empire was under the protection of the royal family of Constantinople, the Palaiologoi, and especially the Augusta Helena Draga≈°, the mother of the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos, who became a nun and a saint under the monastic name of Saint Hypomone (\\"patience\\"). After the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Empire in 1453, a relative of the Palailogos emperors and nephew of the Augusta Helena, Aggelis Notaras, in order to protect the relic of Saint Patapios from the Ottomans, transferred it to Mount Geraneia in southern Greece, near the town Thermai (Loutraki). There he hid it in a cave and a hermitage was established, but some centuries later it was abandoned. It has to be mentioned that the cave where the relic of Saint Patapios was transferred had actually functioned as a hermitage since the 11th century AD. It is located at a height of 650 meters (2132 feet). The discovery of the cave and the foundation of the monastery Monastery of Saint Patapios, Loutraki, Greece, September 2006 The cave with the relic of the saint was discovered in 1904 by citizens of Loutraki. In the cave they found also the skull Helena Draga≈°, known as Saint Hypomone. However, some visitors from the cave took pieces of the relics of St Patapios as an amulet, as Sister Patapia mentions. Then, a priest from Loutraki, father Constantinos Susannis, took the relic of Patapios and kept it at home with the permission of the church to keep it away from vandals. Originally they found in the cave an despoiled wooden cross, a membrane and coins which were delivered to the authorities. Later in 1952, Father Nektarios (in the world Kyriakos) Marmarinos, a priest from the Synoikismos (meaning settlement) of Corinth (and later chancellor in the diocese of Corinth), who was originated from Aegina (and was student of St. Jerome), founded at the monastery and the relic returned to the cave where it was found. The official founding of the monastery took place on August 1, 1952, by Metropolitan of Korinth Prokopios Tzavaras. The first abbess in the monastery in 1952, was sister Synglitiki. Sister Patapia helped at the establishment and building of the monastery. She was mother superior from 1963 to 1970, when she resigned because of health problems. The next and current mother superior is sister Isidora. Father Nektarios, the founder of the monastery, is still visiting the monastery. He has a rich Christian work and has established other monasteries as the male monastery The 3 Hierarchs (near the village Perachora) and a summer camp for children (called Bethlehem). He has also created a female nursing home in Loutraki (where nuns serve the elderly women). Today Elder Nektarios has retired. He has received numerous awards from the Church of Corinth which was chancellor. Even today, though in old age, every Sunday in the settlement of Corinth makes it even lectures on Christian content and Sunday school. Journey to the monastery of St. Patapios The monastery includes the hostels, cells for the 40 nuns, a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary, the cemetery (with the chapel of St. Mary of Egypt) and the katholikon of the Holy Trinity. Finally there is an exhibition room for the visitors. The Cave of St. Patapios is beside the church. There they keep the holy relic of the saint, covered with a robe (that changes every year in the day if the saints' celebration). In the cave there are Byzantine icons (including St. Patapios and St. Patience) by an unknown artist, which were painted probably in the 15th century. Many visitors take as a single amulet from the cave a bit of cotton soaked with holy oil (from the hanging oil - lamp burning in the cave of the Saint) and also take holy water from a source adjacent to the cave. The skull of Saint Hypomone, known as Helena Draga≈°, is also kept at Saint Patapios' nunnery. In the monastery of St. Patapios live 40 nuns. It is located in Greece, mountain Gerania at an altitude of 650 meters (2132 feet) and is close to Loutraki (known resort located 1 hour from the capital Athens). The monastery overlooks the sea and Loutraki. Entering the monastery of St. Patapios we encounter the church Virgin Mary. The church was sanctified on August 1, 1968, by the Metropolitan bishop of Korinth Panteleimon. Inside the church we see an icon in center with the saint that celebrates that day. On the right we see the image of St. Patapios which is across the icon of Virgin Mary on the wall, which is full of offerings (from miracles). You can also see the image of St. Hipomoni left which is across the large picture of St. Patapios on the wall who is with Saint Hypomone, known as Helena Draga≈°, and Saint Nikon the New. Adjucent the church of Virgin Mary, is the church of Agioi (Saints) Anargyroi. Miracles Saint Patapios is well known for the miracles that he did in the past and still does nowadays, which are recorded with full details in the historical archives of the monastery which maintains a large library. Celebration of the saint The memory of Patapios is celebrated on December 8; and also Tuesday after Easter (as a remembrance of the day of finding the relic). The holy skull of Saint Hypomone, known as Helena Draga≈°, is also kept in the monastery of St. Patapios.

Her sister Hannah also represents Great Britain in vaulting.http://www.fei.org/media/biographies  Vaulting career = Team  Eccles first began vaulting at the age of eight. Her neighbours were vaulters and invited her to \\"come and try\\". At the time she owned one pony which she shared with her brother and sister, and regularly competed in Highland dancing, but once she began vaulting, she pursued it as her main passion. She vaulted with that club for one year and was then invited to join the Scottish Equestrian Vaulting team. Vaulting as a reserve for most of the year, Eccles traveled with the team to the World Equestrian Games (WEG) in Rome in 1998. In 1999, she became a team flyer and was part of the official team chosen to represent Great Britain at the European Championships. As she became older she also became a \\"prop\\" or \\"base\\", but remained part of the team. As part of the Scottish Equestrian Vaulting Team, she represented Great Britain every year up to and including 2007 (excl. 2001 due to foot and mouth). They placed 4th at the European Championships in 2005, and 5th at WEG in 2006.  Individual  During her team career Eccles was also competing in Individual events, and in 2004 was selected as one of the Individual females to represent Great Britain. It was her first individual championships and she placed 19th as the youngest in her class. She was again selected for the next three years, placing 13th in Europe in 2005; 10th at WEG in 2006; and 4th in Europe in 2007. After 2007, Joanne was faced with the choice of pursuing either individual or team events, as she was too old to compete in both. She eventually decided to continue in individual events, and came 5th at the World Championships that year. In 2008, she was invited to the Masters in Leipzig, which she won, and placed second in Saumar at Easter. At the CVI */** in Ermelo, Eccles won the Senior class ‚Äì a first for Great Britain. She then came 5th at the World Championships, granting her the British Female Individual Champion title. She also won many titles in pairs (pas de deux) with her sister Hannah Eccles.

Origins The Tyous (written in Arabic as ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸäŸàÿ≥ pronounced Tyoos) were quietly formed at the early 1970s in Beirut by one Al Anid, a Christian Maronite rightwing activist who strongly opposed the Cairo Agreement and the presence of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrilla factions in Lebanon. Prior to 1975 Al Anid cultivated close relations with other Christian rightist parties and organizations, which enabled his group to receive funds and military training, namely from the Kataeb Party and the secretive Al-Tanzim. The original members of the TTC were predominantly Maronites but soon began to accept volunteers from the Assyrian Christian community of Iraqi origin, who had migrated illegally to Lebanon in the 1960s to escape persecution and poverty in their home country. The Assyrians were drawn ‚Äì and sworn allegiance ‚Äì to the militias of the Christian-rightist camp by promises of integration and attaining full Lebanese citizenship. The name 'Tyous' was reportedly given to the group by Bashir Gemayel, the commander of the KRF and future supremo of the Lebanese Forces (LF). Structure and organization The Tyous was organized into a 100 men-strong light infantry group roughly equivalent to an understrength infantry company, initially provided with small-arms purchased on the black market. Additional weapons and equipment (including all-terrain vehicles) were acquired after January 1976 from Lebanese Army stocks and Internal Security Forces (ISF) Police stations, which enabled the group to raise a motor force of some gun-trucks equipped with heavy machine guns (HMGs), recoilless rifles and a few anti-aircraft autocannons. They also received covert military assistance from Israel via the Phalange and later the Lebanese Forces. In the late 1970s the Tyous HQ was located at Ashrafieh, in the 'Museum Crossing' area and respective Green Line sector which they usually manned. Personally commanded by Al-Anid, the Tyous was technically answerable to the Phalange KRF War Council, but reported directly to Bashir Gemayel instead. After Bachir Gemayel's assassination in September 1982 however, the TTC was re-organized with Al-Anid never being replaced. However, the Tyous' HQ was placed under the direct orders of Elie Hobeika, and remained so until himself was ousted from the LF command by Samir Geagea in January 1985. War activities and controversies Ferocious fighters, the TTC were notourious for their lack of discipline and restraint, who all too often brutally murdered any hapless non-Christian civilian that came into their hands. They crossed the green line at least once a week completing missions and causing trouble with the Leftists without direct orders from Bachir Gemayel; when asked to stop, they would not answer to their orders (Hence the \\"Tyous\\" or Stubborn ones\\") Although residents around the HQ of the Tyous claim to have attended church Masses in the court behind the building every Sunday morning. Whatever their reputation, residents of Achrafieh still thank the Tyous for protecting the Christian sector in Beirut. Moreover, their combat reputation was tainted by their direct involvement in atrocities against other Christians. This fact was attested in July ‚Äì August 1976, when the Phalangists, the Army of Free Lebanon and other Lebanese Front militias overrun after a long siege the Muslim-populated slum districts and adjacent Palestinian refugee camps located at East Beirut ‚Äì Karantina, al-Maslakh and Tel al-Zaatar ‚Äì the Tyous joined in the respective massacres and expulsion of the remaining Palestinian refugees and Muslims. In June 1978, an attack by a combined force of some 10 Tyous' fighters and about 1,000 Phalangists led by Samir Geagea and Elie Hobeika led to the Ehden massacre; whereby their rival Tony Frangieh responsible for the murder of many Phalangists leaders in North Lebanon, was killed along with his family.Hoy and Ostrovsky, By Way of Deception (1990), p. 302.Katz, Russel, and Volstad, Armies in Lebanon (1985), p. 8.Gordon, The Gemayels (1988), p. 55.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 79. Later in July 1980, the Tyous helped once again Bashir and his Phalange-dominated LF in unifying the Christian militias once and for all, by launching a swift attack against the fighters of NLP Tigers Militia in several locations, mainly in the Safra beach resort.Katz, Russel, and Volstad, Armies in Lebanon (1985), p. 8.Gordon, The Gemayels (1988), p. 58.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 100. Camille Chamoun then disbanded the Tigers and called for a truce, because the Tigers Militia and the Lebanese Forces were \\"brothers\\". The Tyous in the civil war 1975-78 As members of the Lebanese Front since early 1976, the Tyous were committed to the defense of the Christian-held urban and sub-urban eastern districts of the Lebanese Capital from the leftist Lebanese National Movement (LNM) militias. Engaged for the most part in static operations at Beirut's Green Line, the Tyous bore the brunt of the LNM-PLO alliance 'Spring offensive' held at March that year. Attached to Dany Chamoun's Tigers Militia, they successfully rebuffed enemy attempts to penetrate their positions along the Achrafieh sector. Later in February 1978, the Tyous and the Tigers under the command of Bashir Gemayel drove out the Syrian Army from East Beirut during the siege that lasted for a hundred days in a war called the Hundred Days' War. Al-Anid was announced dead at this war, however it was a sniper bullet that cut his ear in half. It was his right-hand man who was killed on the last day of the war.MuqƒÅwamah wa-al-i·∏•tilƒÅl al-S≈´rƒ´ The Lebanese forces' era 1979-1985 Upon the creation of the Lebanese Forces' Command in 1977, the TTC was easily integrated into the ranks of the new LF militia and attained 'elite' status, displacing the old BG Company (Bachir Gemayel Company) of the KRF. Eventually, upon joining the Kataeb Party Al-Anid rose to the post of Commander in the 1st unit of the 'Special Forces' of the Lebanese Forces War Council. He hand picked the fighters to join his unit. , and continued to lead the Tyous in some battles. He ordered seniors to use the Tyous' combat powers achieve their own objectives. The TTC was also deeply involved in the highly controversial 'unification of the Christian rifle' operations launched in the late 1970s by Bashir Gemayel, who used the Tyous as an instrument to eliminate its rival Christian militias and leaders to absorb their forces into the LF, thus consolidating them into a powerbase for himself. In October 1982, just weeks after Bashir Gemayel's death, Al-Anid signed his resignation letter and relieved himself of the command of the Special Forces team in the War Council making it possible for other seniors in the LF to take over command. The next time he was engaged in battle after leaving the LF was when Syrian, Amal Movement and Hobeika's LFEC troops were attacking the defenseless Achrafieh in 1986. With the help of Achrafieh residents and fighters and the Lebanese Army the attack against Achrafieh failed. Decline and disbandment 1985-86 After Hobeika's downfall in 1985 however, the Tyous' fortunes waned ‚Äì the unit was disbanded and little trace remained of them since they had no leader. With exception of their old HQ in Museum area facing the museum which still stands until today. Some unconfirmed reports suggest that former Tyous' members might have joined Hobeika at Zahl√©, playing a role in the formation of its dissident Lebanese Forces ‚Äì Executive Command (LFEC) militia the following year.Other Tyous members were later seen with Michel Aoun in 2005.

After undertaking defensive duties in the United Kingdom from mid-1940 until early 1941, the battalion then fought in the Battles of Greece and Crete where it suffered heavy casualties and lost a large number of men who were taken as prisoners of war. After being rebuilt, the battalion fought in North Africa, fighting in Operation Crusader, before undertaking garrison duties in Syria. It later fought in the First Battle of El Alamein during which they suffered heavy casualties at Ruweisat Ridge. Re-formed, the battalion later fought in the Second Battle of El Alamein. In late 1943, the battalion was transferred to Italy where it fought for the remainder of the war, fighting battles around Cassino and along the Adriatic coast, before entering Trieste in the final days of the war. After the war, it performed occupation duties in Japan until it was disbanded in 1948. History=Formation and garrison duty in the United Kingdom The 22nd Battalion was formed at Trentham Camp in November 1939, as one of several battalions raised for service overseas as part of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force. The first parade was held in mid-January 1940, when the battalion's four rifle companies ‚Äì 'A' through to 'D' ‚Äì were formed. The majority of its personnel were drawn from the Wellington region, with recruits coming from Wellington; the west coast, Hawke's Bay, Wairarapa and Taranaki. The battalion's first commander was Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Andrew, a Victoria Cross recipient from the First World War. He trained his new command hard and quickly earned the nickname of \\"February\\" due to his habit of issuing 28-day detentions for any breaches in discipline. After completing rudimentary training, the battalion embarked for England in May 1940 as part of the 5th Infantry Brigade, 2nd New Zealand Division. Sailing on the transport Empress of Britain, they made port calls at Perth, in Australia, Cape Town, and Freetown before arriving at Gourock, in Scotland, in June. Following this, the battalion spent the remainder of the year on garrison duties in the south of England where they were positioned to respond in case of a cross-Channel invasion by the Germans in the wake of the Fall of France. Greece and Crete In March 1941, as the threat of invasion passed, the battalion was transferred to Egypt and then, after just three weeks, onto Greece, which was already engaged against the Italians in Albania, and where a German attack was expected. Arriving in Athens in early April on board the Hellas, the 22nd Battalion deployed forward to Katerini initially, but just after the German invasion of Greece it was pulled back to the Olympus Pass, where the 5th Brigade established blocking positions. The subsequent fighting was short and the battalion saw little action as the Allied force was quickly pushed back and evacuated by sea around the end of April. Despite the confusion of the evacuation, the battalion managed to keep most of its stores and equipment, although several vitally important radio set were abandoned due to conflicting orders. Lieutenant Colonel Les Andrew and the battalion at Helwan, July 1941, after returning from Crete Evacuated to Crete, the 22nd Battalion was pressed into the defence of the strategically important island which sat on a vital sea lane of communication across the Mediterranean. On 20 May 1941, the Germans launched an airborne invasion of the island, and during the subsequent Battle of Crete the 22nd Battalion was tasked with the defence of Maleme airfield and the overlooking hill, Point 107. Forced to disperse the companies of his battalion widely to cover his positions, Andrew lost contact with most of his units after German paratroopers began landing in the area on 20 May. Failing to receive any support from his brigade commander following a request for assistance, and fearing most of his command overrun after a failed counterattack by his small reserve, he withdrew his remaining units. As it happened, most of his forward companies remained intact and were subsequently able to withdraw after finding they had been abandoned. Andrew was criticised for his withdrawal, which led to the loss of Maleme airfield. This was a significant factor in allowing the German forces to become established on Crete. He and the surviving elements of his battalion were later evacuated from the island. North Africa, Syria and Italy After the battalion's experience on Crete, in June 1941 it was reconstituted at Garawi, a camp outside Alexandria, where a batch of 365 reinforcements arrived from New Zealand to bring it back up to full strength. After a period of training to ease the new arrivals into the battalion, they moved to Kabrit where the rest of the 5th Brigade began more complex collective training. After this, they were sent to the Kaponga Box for a period to undertake garrison duties and construction tasks, before undertaking manoeuvres with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division around Baggush in October in preparation for their deployment to Libya as part of Operation Crusader, which began in mid-November. After taking part in the fighting in the Western Desert, the 22nd Battalion was withdrawn to Kabrit where it received a batch of 200 reinforcements to replace its losses in Libya, and undertook further training. Keith Elliott, who received the Victoria Cross for his actions commanding a platoon from the 22nd Battalion during the disastrous Ruweisat Ridge action In April 1942, the battalion was deployed to Syria along with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division, where they formed part of the Allied garrison that had been established there at the conclusion of the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign. Occupying positions at Alfrine, near Aleppo, the battalion was tasked with constructing defences and garrisoning the area in order to deter an attack through Turkey into Syria. They remained there until June 1942, when the New Zealanders were moved back to Egypt following German successes in the Western Desert. They subsequently took part in the fighting in the First Battle of El Alamein, including a disastrous action at Ruweisat Ridge where, after their anti-tank guns had been knocked out, over 350 members of the battalion were taken prisoner after being surrounded by German armour. Following these heavy losses, the battalion was reconstituted at Maadi, before returning to the line, rejoining the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division around Ruweisat in late August 1942; during this time the battalion was briefly detached to the British 132nd Brigade, before returning to the 5th New Zealand Brigade at the start of September. It subsequently took part in the Second Battle of El Alamein before being withdrawn back to Maadi in November 1942. At Maadi, the battalion was converted to a motor role ‚Äì the only motorised battalion in the 2nd New Zealand Division ‚Äì receiving extra Bren carriers and machine guns for its final campaign of the war: Italy. It was also reorganised at this time, with the four rifle companies being replaced by three numerically designated motor companies, although ultimately, the Italian terrain negated much of the battalion's mobility. Embarking in mid-October 1943, the battalion subsequently fought in a number of battles as it crossed the Sangro River and fought around Cassino, before advancing towards Florence and then up the Adriatic coast. In the final months of the war, the division advanced steadily, pushing over the Senio and then the Santerno Rivers towards the Alps, before being placed into reserve in April 1945 as the Allies pushed towards the Po River. In late April, the 22nd Battalion became the 5th Brigade's main effort, leading the advance towards the Piave River, where they found that all bridges had been destroyed. Improvising, the battalion pressed a local ferry into operation and after establishing a bridgehead on the other side of the river, continued the advance towards Trieste, fighting its final actions of the war against the Germans around Miramare. The battalion lost its final casualties when one of its companies was fired upon by Yugoslav partisans near Opicina after the end of hostilities. The battalion's casualties during the war amounted to 282 men killed in action or died of wounds, 799 wounded and 511 captured as prisoners of war. In the aftermath, the battalion remained in Trieste to counter the presence of Yugoslav partisans until June 1945 before being withdrawn to Perugia and then wintering in a camp near Florence. Occupation duties in Japan After the war, the 22nd Battalion formed part of Jayforce, New Zealand's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Arriving on 22 March 1946, the battalion was assigned to the Yamaguchi province in southern Honshu. While deployed to Japan, the battalion was redesignated as the \\"2nd Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment\\" on 7 August 1947. The battalion was disbanded in 1948. Honours Sergeant Keith Elliott was the 22nd Battalion's sole Victoria Cross recipient during the Second World War, receiving the award for actions around Ruweisat, Egypt, on 15 July 1942. Other decorations bestowed upon members of the 22nd Battalion included two Distinguished Service Orders, seven Distinguished Conduct Medals, one Member of the Order of the British Empire, 12 Military Crosses and one bar, 14 Military Medals and one Greek Military Cross.

His work is in important public collections, including those of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., the Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, FL, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, and the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut, among others. Thomas Chimes Faustroll/Fire 1988, oil on canvas, 34 x 54 inches Background Thomas James Chimes was born to Greek immigrant parents in Philadelphia in 1921. In 1939 he became enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. His studies were interrupted by the US involvement in World War 2, in which he joined the US Air Force. After World War 2, Thomas began studying again, in New York: philosophy at Columbia University and painting and sculpture at Art Students League. While there he painted several portraits that fell in line with the New York trends of the time. However, he decided to move back to Philadelphia in 1953 and became a fellow of the National Endowment of the Arts and established his studio there. In Philadelphia, he would develop his own, more personal style. Stylistic development Throughout the decades Chimes would continue to reinvent his style with four major periods of work. The artist's work also shows a strong penchant for evocative images reflecting his interest in several of the great writers of the early to middle years of the twentieth century, including Alfred Jarry, Antonin Artaud, and James Joyce. In particular, Jarry's concept of \\"pataphysics\\" informs the artist's work. Early works and Crucifixion He painted what came to be known as the Crucifixion paintings from 1958 to 1965 which were both experimentations with his own abstract language and symbolic explorations of his belief in arts natural ability to explore spirituality, consciousness, and the human condition. Metal boxes From 1965 to 1973 Chimes began to experiment with new materials, making mixed media metal box constructions that were typically mounted to the wall. These works are the earliest influences of Chimes's explorations of pataphysics, along with explorations of his interests in rational systems that order the subjective world, erotic references to the body and machines, and embodying cultural icons like Mick Jagger, Marcel Duchamp, John Lennon, and Greta Garbo within their collaged elements. Panel portraits Between 1973 and 1978, Chimes completed a series of 48 portraits in artist-made frames that have been likened to contemporary icons. The portraits are based on both famous and obscure photographs, and began with Alfred Jarry and his literary and cultural circle. Subjects include figures like proto-surrealist playwright Alfred Jarry, poet Arthur Rimbaud, and author Oscar Wilde. Chimes would add satellite contemporary and historic figures that he felt were in dialogue with their symbolist, quasi-surrealist, or pseudoscientific thoughts, making a catalog of references and influences. Late works and white paintings In the 1980s, Chimes began working on a series of white paintings characterized by their minimal clouded surfaces. Many had embedded images in the layers of paint, or raised surfaces of portraits, constellations, and text. Using both Greek, French, and English quotes from alchemical texts and Jarry, he made works that explore 'pataphysics, the human psyche, and Hellenic myth, symbols, and icons. The paintings began as works in oil on canvas and linen but later became increasingly smaller oil on wood panel works that eventually were only three by three inches in size.

The film tells the story of a man who begins to have visions of a young woman dressed in white who is locked behind the gates of a ch√¢teau. The director was \\"forced\\" to shoot the hardcore version as well under the title Suce Moi Vampire.Lips of Blood (1975). www.midnightonly.com Synopsis At a reception for the launch of a new perfume, a man named Fr√©d√©ric sees a photo of the ruins of an old ch√¢teau by the sea. His mind takes him back to when he was a young boy, walking up to the gate of the ch√¢teau and speaking with a girl who appears to be a little older than he is. Young Fr√©d√©ric opens the gate and the girl tells him to go to sleep, and later she returns and wakes him. He leaves her and closes the gate behind him. The girl tells him to open the gate but he promises her that he will be back to free her. Fr√©d√©ric's mind then comes back to reality and he becomes convinced that the meeting between him and the girl actually happened. He tells his mother, who begins to act strangely and tells him he must have imagined it. He does not agree and sets out to find the girl and set her free. Jennifer, the girl from the ch√¢teau, begins to appear to Fr√©d√©ric in a number of visions, but she does not speak to him, which makes it much more difficult to find her at the ch√¢teau. On one of her appearances, Jennifer leads Fr√©d√©ric to a cemetery, where she makes him open up coffins that unleash a hoard of female vampires. Fr√©d√©ric runs off and is soon met by a woman claiming to be Jennifer as she is now. The woman leads him to an abandoned apartment block and locks him in, as the real Jennifer watches from a distance. The woman is then killed by the vampires, who free Fr√©d√©ric. A man with a gun almost kills Fr√©d√©ric, but he manages to escape the gunman and go home, where his mother has him committed to a mental hospital. It is revealed that his mother was behind the attempts by the woman and the gunman to prevent Fr√©d√©ric from finding the ch√¢teau. At the hospital, Jennifer appears to Fr√©d√©ric again, but he begins to doubt his sanity when she doesn't speak. The vampires show up at the hospital and kill his psychiatrist and let him escape. Walking along the streets, Fr√©d√©ric buys a postcard of the ch√¢teau from a blind man; the name of it is Sauveterre Castle. As he boards a train, Jennifer appears once more to him and smiles, knowing that he is on his way to her. Once at the ch√¢teau, he is met by the vampires and then finds Jennifer's coffin, which is surrounded by a shrine,. Before he can open it, his mother appears in the doorway and tells him not to free Jennifer and that he didn't imagine meeting her as a young boy. His mother goes on to explain that Jennifer is a vampire and that she infected several people, including the four female vampires he freed. As daylight sets in, Fr√©d√©ric's mother and a group of men hunt and kill the four vampires. She asks Fr√©d√©ric to kill Jennifer. He brings the head of a doll, which his mother thinks is Jennifer's head, to be burned along with the four other vampires. Fr√©d√©ric and Jennifer go to the beach, and she is happy to see daylight again after 20 years. Jennifer bites Fr√©d√©ric and they climb into the coffin to let the tide take them out into the ocean.

It is the sequel to Dear Ruth, which was based on the Broadway play of the same name by Norman Krasna.  Plot  Miriam Wilkins is a teenage girl going door- to-door, trying to get Bill Seacroft, her brother-in-law, elected to the state senate. However, Bill has no idea that Miriam is doing this, and he has no wish to become a senator. He is a middle-aged war veteran who works at a bank. He feels like a loser and is frustrated by having to live with his wife Ruth's family. Bill wants to be more independent and stand on his own two feet. Ruth's father, the Honorable Judge Harry Wilkins, has already been nominated for state senator. The whole Wilkins family goes into shock when they learn that Bill will run against him in the election. Harry comes to terms with the situation, believing that his chance of winning is considerable. However, Harry becomes very upset by his daughter Miriam's disloyalty when she publishes an article in the local newspaper in which he is described as a political \\"fathead\\". The Wilkins' household faces some serious dissension among its members. As the two campaigns start off, Bill's wife Ruth soon becomes very jealous of Tommy Murphy, a beautiful woman who serves as campaign manager for Bill. Harry hires a man named Albert Krummer, Ruth's former fianc√© and Bill's current boss, as his campaign manager. The conflict between the two campaign camps deepens. Albert, who is still in love with Ruth, pours gasoline on the rising conflict between her and Bill. Bill starts to take his campaign seriously, and publicly airs his views on Harry's policy concerning a new local airport. Bill states that the airport would force many city residents out of their homes. Miriam is secretary of the Civic Betterment Committee, and one day she decides to use her influence to arrange a live radio broadcast from her home, in support of Bill's campaign. The broadcast is a complete disaster and everyone is in conflict. By the end of the broadcast, Bill and Ruth have separated because she stubbornly refuses to join him and move out of the family house. Harry disapproves of the separation, and he later tips off Bill about a duplex that Ruth is showing in her new job as a real estate agent. Taking his father-in-law's advice, Bill rents the duplex, which is located in another district. He and Ruth almost reunite, but she still refuses to move in with him, since she is still too jealous of Bill's campaign manager Tommy. Bill's relationship with Tommy is strictly business, but one day, when the two are alone, Tommy admits to Bill that she has fallen for him. He rejects her advances, but it is too late. Ruth accepts a new job in Chicago, and plans to move there. Miriam decides to reunite her older sister with her husband, and since she has just had a fight with her boyfriend Ziggy, convinces Bill to take her to a dance instead. Ruth, however, is already on her way to the railway station with Albert, who hopes to renew their relationship. Harry decides to help out and arranges for the police to arrest Albert for bad brakes on his car. Albert and Ruth are brought into court, and Harry insists that they remain in town for the trial, which will not be heard until next week. Bill and Albert meet at the dance, and Albert informs Bill that he has been disqualified as a candidate because he moved to another district. Harry's sponsor announces that a piece of land will be donated to any homeowner displaced by the new airport. Since Harry undoubtedly is the victor of the race to the senate, the political conflict is resolved. Bill gets into a fight with Albert at the dance and gives him a black-eye for interfering with his marriage. Meanwhile, Harry gives Ruth a lecture about her wifely duties. After this Ruth and Bill finally reunite. In secret, Miriam starts a new petition to nominate Bill for state senator.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/72607/Dear-Wife/  Cast  * Edward Arnold as Judge Wilkins * Mary Philips as Mrs. Edie Wilkins * Mona Freeman as Miriam Wilkins * Joan Caulfield as Ruth Wilkins then Seacroft * William Holden as Bill Seacroft * Billy De Wolfe as Albert Kummer * Arleen Whelan as Tommy Murphy Production In 1945 Paramount paid a record $400,000 for the film rights to the hit play Dear Ruth.

Cohen (born 1962) is an American political scientist, author, feminist, and social activist, whose work has focused on the African-American experience in politics from a perspective which is underlined by intersectionality. She is currently the David and Mary Winton Green Professor in Political Science and the College at the University of Chicago, and is the former Director of the Center for the Study of Race (2002‚Äì05).  Early life and education  She received her BA from Miami University, Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1993 and began her academic career at Yale University where she received tenure. Cohen joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 2002.  Career and impact  Cohen frequently writes and speaks about gender, sexuality, class, ethnicity, and their interrelatedness and connection to power. This approach puts her in a class of leftist intellectuals who work to have social and public policy influence on the lives of marginalized groups in a positive way. Cohen, a black lesbian and parent, is the principal researcher on the Black Youth Project, a nationwide survey which focuses on factors that influence black youth decision-making, norms, etc., and has a central focus on understanding how black youth feel political challenges significantly impact them. Cohen is the author of Democracy Remixed: Black Youth and The Future of American Politics and Boundaries of Blackness: AIDS and the Breakdown of Black Politics and Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics?. Cohen is also the co-editor of Women Transforming Politics: An Alternative Reader with Kathleen Jones and Joan Tronto and the co-author of a study on New Media and Youth Political Action, which is part of the Youth and Participatory Politics survey project. She was also on the board of Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press as well as the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies (CLAGS) at CUNY. Her book Boundaries of Blackness: AIDS and the Breakdown of Black Politics explores how issues such as age, gender, sexuality and the growing AIDs epidemic shape the acceptance boundaries within the African-American community. In Democracy Remixed: Black Youth and The Future of American Politics, Cohen uses findings from the Black Youth Project to provide a detailed description of what black youth want, how they understand intersecting challenges of opportunity and discrimination, and how we can begin to help transform the lived experiences and future outcomes of African American youth. Cohen is one of the founding board members of the Audre Lorde Project, which focuses on providing adequate representation, community wellness, and efficient economic and social justice for the LGBT+ communities they serve. Cohen is active in a number of organizations working on social justice issues; she has moderated the Applied Research Center's 2010 conference \\"Popularizing Racial Justice\\", and served as secretary of the American Political Science Association.\\"Facing Race in the Tea Party Era\\" Making Contact, produced by National Radio Project. November 30, 2010. Cohen has also been member of the Black Radical Congress, African American Women in Defense of Ourselves and the United Coalition Against Racism. She currently serves as a board member of the Arcus Foundation and of the University of Chicago‚Äôs four charter schools.  Notable works = ‚ÄúPunks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics?‚Äù (1997)  In ‚ÄúPunks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics‚Äù, Cohen brings attention to and problematizes queer theory‚Äôs single- oppression framework. She argues that this single-oppression framework reinforces the binary between queer/non-queer, creating a category to identify with instead of strategically challenging heteronormativity. By heteronormativity, Cohen is referring to the practices and institutions that legitimize and privilege heterosexuality and heterosexual relationships presumed to be ‚Äúnatural‚Äù in society. Heteronormativity is the normalizing power that is at the focus of queer politics. Because ‚Äúqueer‚Äù is taken up in public discourse as a ‚Äúdeviant sexuality‚Äù and is indicative of non- normativity, Cohen argues that queer theory fails to advocate and recognize those who are not queer-identified as sexually marginalized subjects, which in turn, limits the radical potential of queer politics. She suggests that we broaden our understanding of queerness, because as it currently stands, the term ‚Äúqueer‚Äù does not encompass all marginalized identities. She urges that we must recognize the intersections of oppression and understand how multiple identities work to limit the privilege granted to those who conform to heteronormativity. This article is a call for action for queer activism to take an intersectional approach towards transformation.  ‚ÄúThe Radical Potential of Queer? Twenty Years Later‚Äù (2019)  In ‚ÄúThe Radical Potential of Queer? Twenty Years Later‚Äù, Cohen reflected on her article ‚ÄúPunks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens‚Äù saying that it was shaped primarily by three factors: the HIV/AIDS crisis, neoliberal policies and ideologies implemented by Reagan and Clinton that harmed the poor, and hope, which stands in contrast to the first two (she is referring to the emergence of Black feminist and Black gay and lesbians communities between the 70s-90s). The article is primarily focused on hope, as Cohen is afraid of the erasure that happens with re-writing history, especially around Black and gay communities framed as only as response to HIV/AIDS. In fact, she argues that we need to remember that these communities were a radical attack on politics of respectability, and state violence. Cohen articulates that ‚Äúqueer‚Äù and ‚Äúqueerness‚Äù have become politicized identities in and of themselves, which she is suggesting may rob it of the very potentials that queering is supposed to engender. In other words, queerness as a practice is about the ability to create an opposition to dominant norms‚Äîbut increasing to be queer is a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù identity. Thus, it may be weakening as a position of resistance, because it has become part of a range of identities, which is a turn away from being a form of resistance to categorization and heteronormativity. Cohen concludes with a hopeful message that perhaps her vision of queer resistance isn‚Äôt what she thought it would be twenty years ago, but recognizes the potential for contemporary Black feminism and queer activists to make radical change.  Awards and honors  She has received a number of awards, including the Robert Wood Johnson Investigator‚Äôs Award, and the Robert Wood Johnson Scholars in Health Policy Research Fellowship. Cohen is the recipient of two research grants from the Ford Foundation for her work as principal investigator of the Black Youth Project and the Mobilization, Change and Political and Civic Engagement Project. Cohen serves on a number of national and local advisory boards and is the co-editor with Frederick Harris of a book series at Oxford University Press entitled \\"Transgressing Boundaries: Studies in Black Politics and Black Communities\\". In 2004, Cohen was awarded the Race, Politics, and Adolescent Health: Understanding the Health Attitudes and Behaviors of African American Youth Award. In 2004, Cohen was also interviewed for the Global Feminisms Project Comparative Case Studies Of Women's Activism and Scholarships, which is an archive of oral histories given by transnational women scholars and activists. In 2013, Cohen gave the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Lecture, entitled \\"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the Age of Obama: Building a New Movement for the 21st Century\\", at Gustavus Adolphus College.

Ed Kunzelman founded the company in 1967. Petland currently operates 131 stores in the United States, and at least 63 in foreign markets including South Africa, Canada, Japan, China, Mexico, Brazil and El Salvador. The chain is notable for its controversy over documentation from the Humane Society of the United States revealing the purchase of dogs from puppy mills.  History  Petland was started in 1967 when opened up his first store in Chillicothe, Ohio. The company originally owned and operated pet stores in Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky. In the early 1980s, Petland began expanding its presence in Canada and entered foreign markets. By 2008, Petland had become a $50 million company with about 230 stores. Petland sells products and services worth about $300,000,000 in the United States, South Africa, Canada, Japan, and Mexico. The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent public relations issues have drastically affected Petland. Petland currently operates 84 domestic locations, down from over 140 stores just a few years ago. The company currently sells birds, fish, small animals, puppies, and kittens. While Petland has endorsed efforts to raise standards at commercial dog breeding kennels, the company continues to find itself in the middle of animal welfare controversies. In 2018, a delivery vehicle at a Petland store in Florida was searched by authorities. Nearly 2 dozen puppies were seized due to the conditions they were in. The year before, the Henderson, NV Petland store was fined for keeping sick dogs in overcrowded conditions.  Petland South Africa  Petland was introduced to South Africa as a franchise in 1999. They currently have three stores located in Durban in Umhlanga Rocks, Salt Rock and Durban North. Petland stores in South Africa stock animal and pet products such as food and accessories for cats, dogs, birds, reptiles and small animal products as well as holding fish and small animal livestock.  Aquarium Adventure  Aquarium Adventure is a wholly owned subsidiary of Petland. Ed Kunzelman was founded in 1995, after working with Bill Wymard, a Petland franchisee and marine biologist, on developing a concept for an \\"aquatics only\\" store. They both saw that there was demand for a non-Petland branded aquatics-only pet store in major metro markets. Charitable programs=Pets in the Classroom Petland participates in the Pets in the Classroom program of the Pet Care Trust. This program was established to give teachers additional resources to acquire and care for classroom animals. Teachers can get grants for new animals, pet environments, food, and other supplies. This program started in 2010. As of July 2014, 40,111 grants had been issued. Adopt-a-Pet Under the Adopt-a-Pet program started in 1998, Petland staff work with animal shelters, animal rescue groups, and individual activists to place homeless animals including puppies, dogs, kittens, cats, and various small animals in homes. Many Petland locations use their storefronts to display these animals. This program also raises money for animal welfare organizations. This program has homed hundreds of thousands of pets. These pets receive basic veterinary care and vaccinations before being placed. In some cases, adoptive families are charged a small fee for de-sexing. Generally, intact pets are sent home with a certificate good for a free spay or neuter at a local veterinary clinic. Some Petland stores micro-chip all participating animals. Animal welfare controversy Petland claims they do not source from \\"puppy mills.\\" and obtain puppies from USDA-licensed and inspected breeders with clean records, hobby breeders with three or fewer breeding females, and animal rescue organizations. Many Petland locations claim to only offer dogs from animal welfare organizations, however a report from the Humane Society of the United States in 2009 revealed that allegedly ‚Äúalmost every Petland store in the country is buying puppies from large-scale \\"middleman\\" brokers that deal with puppy mills, and some are continuing to buy directly from known puppy mills‚Äù. While Petland has claimed that puppies are sourced from family raised breeders, breeders with clean records, and rescues only, reports have been made public published by the Humane Society of the United States reporting that some parts of the chain have purchased dogs from commercial breeding farms selling ‚Äúover 5,000 puppies a year‚Äù and breeders with animal welfare violations. The credibility of these reports is contested. In addition to investigations conducted by The Humane Society of the United States, a past and current class action lawsuit and over 500 negative reviews on ConsumerAffairs.com also state that Petland receives many dogs from puppy mills. Though seen as controversial Petland is partnered with the AKC (American Kennel Club) who have the very highest standards on canine bloodline and health as well as having all of their puppies registered. Petland does not provide AKC registration documentation on each puppy but does market a paper \\"registration\\", a full health warranty (requires using a Petland authorized Vet), microchipping, breeder information, pedigree (showing significant inbreeding or otherwise), a 25 point inspection of the puppy performed by two separate veterinarians and well as many other reputable attributes. Petland guarantees their animals health and bloodline as well as performing daily exams on each puppy and charting their day to day progress and health. They individualize their care accordingly to each animal specifically.

The film starred Mary Pickford (who also wrote the scenario) as an older woman. Before this film, Pickford was mainly cast in \\"little girl\\" roles which were popular with the public.Brownlow 1968, p. 120. A Girl of Yesterday costarred Pickford's younger brother Jack, Marshall Neilan, Donald Crisp and Frances Marion, who later became a prolific screenwriter. Real life aviation pioneer Glenn L. Martin also made a cameo in the film.Beauchamp 1998, p. 441. Plot Jane Stuart (Mary Pickford), a sweet old-fashioned girl brought up with her brother John (Jack Pickford), by their poor Aunt Angela (Gertrude Norman), suddenly inherits wealth. While she tries to retain her traditional wardrobe, customs and ways, her brother likes the attention that is now being paid to them by people like their neighbours, the Monroes (Donald Crisp), (Lillian Langdon), who previously shunned them. Rosanna Danford (Frances Marion), is ‚Äúthe wicked sophisticate‚Äù who has her eye on Stanley Hudson (Marshall Neilan), Mary's beau. At her first reception, Jane, now wealthy, is still wearing her grandmother's old-fashioned gown. She, however, is dressed more demurely compared to the other girls at the event and attracts a group of male admirers. Jane later tries to fit in with a new crowd, and attempts tennis and golf. She accepts an invitation to go yachting from Stanley, who, hoping to win Jane, has attempted to introduce her to a new luxurious life. Rosanna is jealous and arranges for an pilot to take Jane flying, planning that she will miss the outing and be far away from Stanley. Jane is \\"kidnapped\\" and taken away by an aircraft. Although a misunderstanding follows, Jane later accepts Stanley's belated proposal.

When Mary and Jack Pickford, appeared in roles as brother and sister in this film, it was the first time actual brother and sister were cast. A Girl of Yesterday was notable for the screen debut of famous pioneering aviator Glenn Martin.Farmer 1984, p. 311. He flew a Martin TT biplane, one of his own designs at Griffith Park, where he operated a flying school.Wynne 1987, p. 2. In 1912, Martin built an airplane factory in Los Angeles. To finance this business, he began stunt-flying at fairs and local airfields. In 1915, Martin saw an advertisement for a pilot/aircraft owner to play a role in a film. Sensing an opportunity, he replied to the ad and got the part. Martin would play the role of a dashing hero in A Girl of Yesterday starring Mary Pickford.

(Many filmographies credit Mary with writing the story, but in his memoirs, Mickey Neilan claims that Frances [Marion] wrote it).\\" Further, \\"All those close inner connections simmering in the cast and crew could have wreaked havoc, but everyone involved seemed to enjoy each other and [Allan] Dwan was secure enough in his own abilities to include others in the creative process.\\" The beautiful locales such as Santa Catalina Island were also featured in A Girl of Yesterday. \\"In part it is the thought of seeing all these locations circa 1915 that makes the loss of 'A Girl of Yesterday' such a heartbreak for film fans. Of course it would also be great fun to see Jack Pickford, Mary Pickford, Mickey Neilan and Frances Marion all together on the screen, knowing as we do that Mary, Mickey and Frances would work together often in the years ahead and be lifelong friends.\\"Beauchamp, Cari. \\"A Girl of Yesterday.\\" marypickford.org, 2019.

Those who took part formed the Associate Presbytery and later the United Secession Church. They were often referred to as seceders. The First Secession arose out of an Act of the General Assembly of 1732, which was passed despite the disapproval of the large majority of individual presbyteries. This restricted to Heritors and Elders the right of nominating Ministers to vacancies where the Patron had not nominated within six months.. When Ebenezer Erskine wished to have his dissent recorded, it was found that a previous Act of 1730 had removed the right of recorded dissent,. and so the protests of the dissenters were refused. In the following October, Ebenezer Erskine, minister at Stirling, and, at the time, Moderator of the Synod of Stirling preached a sermon referring to the act as unscriptural and unconstitutional. Members of the synod objected, and he was censured.Knight p. 494. On appeal, the censure was affirmed by the Assembly in May 1733,. but Erskine refused to recant.Fraser, pp. 384 et seq. He was joined in his protest by William Wilson, Alexander Moncrieff and James Fisher. They were regarded by the Assembly as being in contempt. When they still refused to recant, in November the protesting ministers were suspended. They replied by protesting that they still adhered to the principles of the Church, whilst at the same time seceding. Timeline showing the evolution of the churches of Scotland from 1560 In December 1733 they constituted themselves into a new presbytery. In 1734 they published their first testimony, with a statement of the grounds of their secession, which made prominent reference to the doctrinal laxity of previous General Assemblies. In 1736 they proceeded to exercise judicial powers as a church court, published a judicial testimony, and began to organize churches in various parts of the country. Having been joined by four other ministers, including the well-known Ralph Erskine, they appointed Wilson Professor of Divinity. For these acts proceedings were again instituted against them in the General Assembly, and they were in 1740 all deposed and ordered to be ejected from their churches. Meanwhile, the membership of their 'Associate Presbytery' steadily increased, until in 1745 there were forty-five congregations, and it was reconstituted into an 'Associate Synod'. A Second Secession from the Church of Scotland occurred in 1761, with Thomas Gillespie and others. This was called the Presbytery of Relief. In 1847, this denomination united with the United Secession Church (formed in 1820 from the union of the New Licht Burghers and New Licht Anti-Burghers) to form the United Presbyterian Church.

It was located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. It was founded by the Carmelite Order in 1935. The school closed in 1976, and was demolished in 1983. The school was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1979.  History  The school was built in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, and was the first school in Los Angeles constructed subject to the new seismic building code which came about in the aftermath of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. The name of the school is in reference to Mount Carmel, the mountain range in northern Israel where, according to Biblical tradition, the prophet Elijah rebuilt an altar. Although classes had begun in November 1934, the school wasn't officially dedicated until 1935 by Bishop John Cantwell. At one time the school served boys from 40 parishes in the Los Angeles Archdiocese. Father Gus Carter, class of 1942, returned in 1952 and became athletic director. He would leave Mount Carmel in 1959 to found Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino. The Carmelites announced in 1976 that the school would be closed due to declining enrollment. Enrollment had fallen to 276 students from 600 in the early 1960s. Parents organized a petition drive to prevent closure of the school but their efforts proved unsuccessful. The 1979 film Rock 'n' Roll High School, featuring the Ramones, used the school campus as a filming location. The school was blown up at the end of the movie. The Mt. Carmel Alumni Association is still active. It awards scholarships through a foundation to students of Catholic schools in Los Angeles. In addition the association sponsors an annual golf tournament which raises funds for retired Carmelite priests.  Athletics  The Crusaders competed in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF).

It contains the single species Palaeoagaracites antiquus. The genus is solely known from the Lower Cretaceous, Upper Albian stage (about 100 Ma), Burmese amber deposits in Myanmar. Palaeoagaracites is one of only five known agaric fungal species known in the fossil record, the oldest to be described, and only genus from Burmese amber. History and classification The genus is known only from the single holotype, number \\"AB-368\\", a single partial fruiting body specimen. When described the mushroom is part of in the private collection of Ron Buckley of Florence, Kentucky, United States.The collection has been sold and is now owned by Deniz Erin of Istanbul, Turkey.Fossil page of Ron Buckley accessed on 7 December 2010 AB-368 was collected from one of the amber mines in the Hukawng Valley area southwest of Maingkhwan, Kachin State, Northern Myanmar. It was first studied by a pair of researchers led by Dr George Poinar from Oregon State University who worked with Ron Buckley. Poinar and Buckley published their 2007 type description in Mycological Research, a journal of the British Mycological Society. The genus has been assigned the MycoBank number MB510456, and the species number MB510465. The genus name Palaeoagaracites is Greek in derivation and is a combination of the words palaeo meaning \\"old\\" and agaricon, which means \\"fungus\\". The specific epithet \\"antiquus\\" was coined by the authors possibly from the Latin for \\"old\\" in reference to the age of the specimen. When published, Palaeoagaracites antiquus was the fifth species of agaric fungus to be described, and the oldest. The three species Aureofungus yaniguaensis, Coprinites dominicana and Protomycena electra are known from the Burdigalian amber mines of the Dominican Republic, while the fourth species Archaeomarasmius leggeti is from the slightly younger Turonian age New Jersey Amber. Description Palaeoagaricites antiquus and Mycetophagites atrebora. The holotype of Palaeoagaracites is a single, partly decomposed fruit body without any associated structures preserved in a rectangular piece of yellow amber approximately by by . The pileus is in diameter and has a convex shape. The flesh is a bluish-gray color, hairy, and radially furrowed with sixteen grooves visible on the intact section of pileus. The margin is curved slightly inward. The lamellae, or gills, though slightly decomposed, are subdivided into short sections ranging from 85 Œºm to 110 Œºm in length. The stipe was not preserved with the cap. The basidiospores, present as both light and dark colored spores on the gill sides, are smooth and oval. Each basidiospore is approximately 3 to 4.5 Œºm long. While mature light colored spores are present in many agarics, darker colored mature spores are found in some genera. Palaeoagaracites presents the oldest, and only, evidence of fungal parasitism by other fungi in the fossil record. The fossil displays a complex interrelationship between three different fungal genera. The preserved P. antiquus cap is host to both a mycoparasitic fungus and a hypermycoparasitic fungus. The surface of the Palaeoagaracites specimen hosts the extinct necrotroph fungus Mycetophagites atrebora. The mycelia of Mycetophagites are found across the surface of the P. antiquus pileus, and the hyphae penetrate into the P. antiquus tissues themselves forming necrotic areas. Mycetophagites is in turn host to a hypermycoparasitic necrotrophic fungus species Entropezites patricii. Hyphae of Entropezites are preserved penetrating the Mycetophagites hyphae, forming areas of decomposing tissue. Entropezites also displays a range of growth stages for probable zygospores. The combined distinguishable characters of Palaeoagaracites were not enough for Poinar and Buckley to place the genus further than Agaricales incertae sedis. The overall size, shape of the spores, and structure of the cap hint at a relationship to the genera Mycena, Marasmius and Collybia.

Among other things was his coverage of Michael Jackson's child molestation trial in 2005. In April 2009, Friedman was fired by Foxnews.com after he reviewed the film X-Men Origins: Wolverine based on viewing a bootlegged copy of the movie online. (Friedman later told Gawker.com that he had not downloaded the film, but had streamed it after finding a link to it online.) Friedman's column was perceived as an endorsement of film piracy and illegal file sharing, particularly by the film's distributor, 20th Century Fox, which, like Foxnews.com, is a unit of News Corporation. Ironically, Friedman's review of Wolverine was very favorable, including comments such as \\"I am, in fact, amazed about how great Wolverine turned out. It exceeds expectations at every turn.\\" In June 2009, Friedman filed a lawsuit against Fox News Network L.L.C., NewsCorp America, Twentieth Century Fox, and Rupert Murdoch, claiming wrongful termination, tortious interference with his employment contract, and defamation based on statements Fox News and 20th Century Fox made after his firing.

A second specimen was discovered in 2010 by Dzik et al. The feathers of Praeornis likely represent modified tail feathers used for display or balance, similar to those found in some other early avialans. The feathers of Praeornis are unique thanks to their extremely thick central quill (rachis) and stiffened barbs. In 1978, Rautian officially named the feather (cataloged as specimen PIN 2585/32) Praeornis sharovi. He believed it belonged to a bird more primitive than Archaeopteryx, and assigned it to its own sublcass (Praeornithes), order (Praeornithiformes) and family (Praeornithidae).Rautian (1978). \\"A unique bird feather from Jurassic lake deposits in the Karatau.\\" Paleontological Journal, 4: 520-528. However, in 1986, Bock published a paper arguing that the \\"feather\\" was in fact the leaf of a cycad.Bock (1986). \\"The arboreal origin of avian flight.\\" Pp. 57-72 in Padian, K. (ed.). The Origin of Birds and the Evolution of Flight. California Academy of Sciences, Memoir 8. This opinion was followed by Doludenko and colleagues in 1990, who noted that it was similar to the leaves of the cycad species Paracycas harrisii. L.A. Nessov, in 1992, also suggested that it belonged to a cycad, but synonymized it with the species Cycadites saportae. The opinion that it represents a leaf has since been followed by Alan Feduccia in 1996 and Peter Wellnhofer in 2004.Feduccia, A. (1996). The Origin and Evolution of Birds. New Haven: Yale University Press. 420 pp.Wellnhofer, P. (2004). \\"The plumage of Archaeopteryx: Feathers of a dinosaur.\\" Pp. 282-300 in Currie, Koppelhus, Shugar and Wright (eds). Feathered Dragons: Studies on the Transition from Dinosaurs to Birds. Three studies since the original description has supported the identification of Praeornis as a feather, rather than a leaf. In 1991, Glazunova and colleagues examined the specimen using an electron microscope, and found that the microstructure had features in common with the \\"primitive\\" feathers of ratite birds [since ratites are now known to be secondarily flightless paleognathous birds, their feathers are not primitive but degenerate flight and contour feathers].Glazunova, Rautian and Filin (1991). \\"Praeornis sharovi: Bird feather or plant leaf?\\" Materialy 10 Vsesoyuznoi Ornitologicheskoi Konferentzii, Vitebsk, 2(1): 149-150. [in Russian] In a 2001 paper, Kurochkin also accepted its identity as a feather.Kurochkin (2001). \\"Mesozoic birds of Mongolia and the former USSR.\\" Pp. 533-559 in Benton, Shishkin, Unwin and Kurochkin (eds.). The Age of Dinosaurs in Russia and Mongolia. A more comprehensive study was published in 2010 by Dzik et al., in which the authors conducted a biochemical analysis of a Praeornis feather and other fossils from the same site, including plants and fish. The analysis showed that the chemical markers of the Praeornis fossil was more similar to the fish scales than to the plant leaves, supporting the hypothesis that the feathers were animal in origin.Dzik, J., Sulej, T. and Niedzwiedzki, G. (2010). \\"Possible link connecting reptilian scales with avian feathers from the early Late Jurassic of Kazakstan.\\" Historical Biology, 22(4): 394‚Äì402. Besides identifying Praeornis as a feather, Dzik et al. also noticed similarities between the purported feathers of Longisquama and those of Praeornis. In 2017, a fossil of an enantiornith found in Brazil was shown to have a pair of rachis-dominated tail feathers very similar to the type specimen of Praeornis, making it likely that Praeornis represents an enantiornith or similar species.Agnolin, F.L., Rozadilla, S., and Ismar de Souza Carvalho (2017).

History  In 2009, Remy Verreault (ex-GFK, ATM, CP101) and Sonny Letourneau (ex-GFK, Senseless, SonOfaBeat) were looking to start a state of the art punk rock band with the will to bring back this melodic kind of punk seen in the 90's. To do so, they asked long-time friend Bruno Charest (ex-Dual Peak, Crane, Pressure) who joined in to form what will be shortly after known as We Love Danger! The band rehearsed for a while and finally played shows with numerous bands (Propagandhi, Bad Religion and more) in their career debut. After almost a year of work, WLD! realised that they needed another guitar player to enlarge the sound and add melody to their original recipe. A couple of good contacts in Quebec's music scene referenced Alex Bergeron (ex-Twenty Big Mistakes) as a talented guitarist that could greatly fill this position. Alex accepted the challenge and joined in October 2009. His addition helped widen the horizons of We Love Danger! in terms of sound and ideas. The band is into their own studio since April 2010 to record what will be their debut Full-Length album. The name for this album and the official release date will be known at the beginning of 2011. We Love Danger! will go into a European tour kicking off on April 8, 2011. Their first show will take place in London at the Relentless Garage with UK punk legends The Boys.

Vandervis has run for mayor in 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019; finishing second in 2007. He is currently an elected councillor. Personal life Lee Vandervis was born in Balclutha in 1957. He is the second son of Dutch immigrant parents, who settled in New Zealand after the Second World War. He attended Rosebank School (where he was dux), South Otago High School, and Kaikorai Valley High School. Vandervis later acquired a BA in Philosophy from the University of Otago, and has worked as a music technician for many years. In the mid 1970s he went to the United Kingdom and worked as an acoustic engineer for Midas Audio. In 1981, Vandervis returned to Dunedin and set up Vandervision Lighting Audio and Video in the early 1980s. Lee Vandervis was teased at school because of his Dutch name \\"Lieuwe\\", which he later changed to \\"Lee\\" by deed poll. Vandervis is married to Antonie Vandervis. He has eight children with the youngest being severely autistic. He is also an avid listener of classical music and names Johann Sebastian Bach and Jethro Tull as some of his favourite composers. Vandervis also plays the piano, violin, and cello, and was a member of the Dunedin band Prometheus. Vandervis is also a fan of the American author Neal Stephenson's speculative fiction novel Cryptonomicon. Politics In Vandervis had a brief foray into politics standing for Bob Jones' New Zealand Party in the Dunedin North electorate. He polled in third place.New Zealand Official Yearbook ‚Äì 1984, Department of Statistics, Wellington, page 1024, 2004-2013 terms In 2004 Vandervis successfully stood for the Dunedin City as a Council councillor and ran unsuccessfully for Mayor coming third with 9.1% of the vote. In the 2007 election he stood on a platform opposing then proposed replacement stadium for Carisbrook. He was defeated both as a councillor (by a margin of four votes after the counting of the special votes), as well as a mayoral candidate. He came second after the incumbent, Peter Chin, but only gained 17% of the votes. During the 2010 election campaign one of his volunteers installing an election hoarding pierced an 11 kV cable near Mosgiel causing a power outage to 747 consumers. The site had been designated for hoarding by the Council, but no mention of the presence of the cable had been made; the volunteer was unharmed. Vandervis was again third in the Mayoral race with 15.2% of the vote. He was re-elected as a Councillor. As of November 2012, Vandervis is the Chair of the Dunedin City Council Heritage Fund and the Heritage Buildings Re-use Committee. He is also on the Board of the Otago Settlers Museum. Vandervis states that he is focused on challenging misrepresented projects and bureaucratic waste. At times he is controversial. His recent criticism of Community Board's being a waste of time raised their ire. He has also had clashes over bus shelters, criticised Council's financial management ‚Äì especially the $480,000 bailout of the Otago Rugby Union, and faced criticism over his suggestion that Christchurch's earthquake rebuild could be shifted to Dunedin. Vandervis has suggested that Christchurch's proposed stadium would be a waste of money. His comments were based on his experience with Dunedin's Forsyth Barr Stadium. Vandervis supports the rebuild of the Christchurch Cathedral, which was partially destroyed in the earthquakes. 2013-2016 terms Lee Vandervis stood for re-election in the October 2013 local election as a Dunedin City Councillor; he also contested the Dunedin mayoralty for the fourth time. He was elected as to Council and placed third for the mayoralty. The Mayor, Dave Cull, did not appoint Vandervis to any committees, commenting that he had no confidence he could contribute constructively, nor maintain any of the relationships needed to do the work effectively.No leadership role for Vandervis, Debbie Porteous, Otago Daily Times, 24 October 2013 On 16 March 2015, Lee Vandervis was subject to a code of conduct hearing dealing with three complaints against him for his alleged bullying, aggressive, and misleading behaviour. Vandervis has defended his actions. The city councillor had been involved in an argument with the Dunedin City Council's chief executive Dr Sue Bidrose and had criticized the council and the local police's investigation of the illegal sale of 150 the Council's Cityfleet vehicles to local residents. On 1 May 2015, Vandervis was temporarily stripped of his voting rights after failing to apologize for these actions. According to the Otago Daily Times journalist Kim Dungey, Vandervis was well known within Dunedin circles for his acrimonious relationship with Mayor Cull and several city councillors; taking issue with the council's alleged misspending of public money, the Cityfleet fraud case, and property speculation by Council's Delta Utility Services. In addition, Vandervis has also opposed a 3.8% rates increase and has called for the council to cut back on staff numbers and to \\"be run more like a business.\\" 2019 local body election In late August 2019, the Otago Daily Times reported that Vandervis was the subject of 11 complaints of inappropriate behaviour, angry and shouting, insulting, threatening, unsubstantiated allegations of corruption, and intimidating behaviour against several Dunedin City Council staff members and members of the public. Vandervis was also criticised by Mayor Cull and several fellow councillors including Rachel Elder, Aaron Hawkins, and Mike Lord for alleged bullying and intimidating behaviour. In response, Vandervis defended his actions and claimed that he was the victim of a smear campaign timed to coincide with the 2019 Dunedin mayoral election. In early September 2019, Vandervis drew criticism when he made remarks that young voters were ignorant or did not care about candidates during a mayoral debate organised by the Otago University Students' Association. Vandervis subsequently apologised for his remarks. In mid-September 2019, a twelfth complaint was lodged against Vandervis after he allegedly verbally abused some DCC staff members over a parking ticket. Vandervis contested the complaint and uploaded a CCTV video on social media to support his claim that he did not verbally abuse. David Benham, chairman of the Otago Regional Council's audit and risk subcommittee, was tasked with conducting an independent investigation into the matter. On 10 December, Vandervis was censured by his fellow councillors for the parking ticket incident. In response, he alleged that his privacy was breached at a critical time of the election campaign. On 12 October 2019, Vandervis was re- elected to the Dunedin City Council as a councillor but lost the mayoral contest to Greens candidate Aaron Hawkins.

Google Inc. 562 F.3d 123 (2nd Cir. 2009), was a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case in which the court held that recommending a trademark for keyword advertising was a commercial use of the trademark, and could constitute trademark infringement. The case involved Rescuecom, a computer repair and support company, and Google, a web search and advertising company. Prior to the case's resolution, Google recommended the 'Rescuecom' trademark to businesses (including Rescuecom's competitors), that were buying keywords through Google's AdWords product. The case was first heard by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in 2006. The court ruled in favor of Google and held that Google's use of the Rescuecom trademark did not constitute a \\"use\\" under the Lanham Act. As a result, Rescuecom's claims of infringement did not apply. The Second Circuit vacated this ruling in 2009, ruling that Google's actions constituted commercial use and that Rescuecom's claims could not be immediately dismissed. The case was sent back to the district court for reconsideration. Background=Keyword advertising case law The use of trademarks in the United States is governed by the Lanham Act (Title 15, Article 22 of the United States Code). Prior case law in the area of keyword-triggered trademark use consisted at the time of a series of cases involving WhenU (heard by district courts outside the Second Circuit), as well as 1-800 CONTACTS, INC. v. WhenU. com, Inc., a case heard by the Second Circuit appeals court. Both the district and appeals court in Rescuecom discuss these cases extensively. =The WhenU cases= WhenU, an advertising company developed a piece of advertising software called Save Now. When installed on a user's computer, Save Now would respond to a user's actions by generating pop-up advertisements. In particular, when a user browsed to a URL that WhenU possessed advertisements for, WhenU would open a window showing advertisements. Cases were filed against WhenU in 2003 by plaintiffs whose sites were found in WhenU's index. District Courts within the Sixth and Fourth Circuits ruled that WhenU's use of the plaintiff's trademarked URLs did not constitute a use of the plaintiff's trademarks because this use was restricted to the operation of WhenU's software. The Second Circuit in 1-800 Contacts v. WhenU.com Inc. upheld the above line of reasoning, holding that usage of a trademark in an \\"unpublished directory of terms\\" and the appearance of \\"separate, branded ads\\" triggered by a trademark do not constitute \\"use\\" of the trademark as per the Lanham Act. This decision is noteworthy for discussion of Rescuecom due to stare decisis and the binding precedent established by an appellate court. Complaint AdWords is a system used by Google through which advertisers can purchase keywords. When a user searches for a purchased keyword, Google displays the advertiser's ad and link. Google also provides advertisers a \\"Keyword Suggestion Tool\\", a system that recommends additional keywords for an advertiser to purchase. Prior to Rescuecom litigation, Google recommended trademarks, and in particular, the Rescuecom trademark to advertisers. Rescuecom therefore filed suit against Google on six counts: (1) that Google infringed on the Rescuecom trademark, (2) that Google's use causes \\"false designation of origin\\" , (3) federal dilution , (4) common law trademark infringement, (5) state law dilution claim, and (6) tortious interference with economic advantage. Procedural history The district court drew heavily from the Second Circuit's decision in 1-800 and granted Google's motion to dismiss Rescuecom's claims. The court held that Rescuecom had \\"prove[d] no facts in support of its claim ... [of] trademark use\\". Given that a trademark \\"use\\" is required under the Lanham Act for infringement to occur, the district court dismissed Rescuecom's first three claims. The last three counts at issue were viewed by the court as issues of state law. Although the district court had jurisdiction to consider those claims under , it declined to exercise these claims as it had already dismissed Rescuecom's federal law claims. Opinion of the Court=Decision The Second Circuit vacated the district court's decision, holding that Google's use of the \\"Rescuecom\\" trademark constituted a \\"use in commerce\\" under the Lanham Act. The court noted this case as distinct from 1-800, rejecting the argument advanced by Google and accepted by a number of district courts in the Second Circuit, that the inclusion of a trademark in an internal computer directory cannot constitute trademark use. The court proceeds to distinguish that Google had made direct use of the 'Rescuecom' trademark, whereas WhenU did not make direct use of the '1-800 Contacts' trademark (instead it displayed ads that were triggered by the plaintiff's mark): \\"Google‚Äôs recommendation and sale of Rescuecom‚Äôs mark to its advertising customers are not internal uses. Furthermore, 1-800 did not imply that use of a trademark in a software program‚Äôs internal directory precludes a finding of trademark use. Rather, influenced by the fact that the defendant was not using the plaintiff‚Äôs trademark at all... If we were to adopt Google and its amici‚Äôs argument, the operators of search engines would be free to use trademarks in ways designed to deceive and cause consumer confusion. This is surely neither within the intention nor the letter of the Lanham Act.\\" The court further distinguished the appearance of ads in 1-800 Contacts compared to Rescuecom. In 1-800 Contacts, ads were displayed in a different window and did not affect the end-user's ability to access the plaintiff's website (note that the ads appeared in synchrony with the plaintiff's website). The court accepted Rescuecom's assertion that Google's placement of \\"sponsored links\\" above organic search results could lead to user confusion as required under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As a result, Google's argument that a sponsored link is analogous to placement of a generic brand next to a trademarked brand was rejected by the court. Subsequent developments In March 2010, Rescuecom discontinued further proceedings against Google, filing a statement of dismissal and issuing a press release declaring victory in the case. However, Google apparently made no new concessions to Rescuecom to get it to drop the lawsuit; instead, the changes that Rescuecom claimed as victory were made by Google five years earlier.

Biography Elinor Armer was born in Oakland, California but at the age of 2 months moved to Davis, California with her family where she would spend most of her childhood. Armer‚Äôs father worked as an engineer and worked for the Agricultural Engineering Department for the University in Davis, which prompted the family‚Äôs move. Her father was an acoustical engineer and used to set up speakers in the family‚Äôs living room, exposing Elinor to acoustics at a young age. Elinor first began sight-reading music and enjoying four-part harmony because of many hymnals found in the Armer home, due to her father‚Äôs Methodist Evangelist background. Armer comes from a family of California artists, her grandfather was a commercial artist and her grandmother was an author. Her mother was a writer as well and who sang and played the piano. Elinor shared her love of piano with her mother; they frequently sang and played together throughout her childhood. Armer was eight years old when she began playing the piano Though her mother played the piano also, Elinor was taught to play by a neighbor, Fritz Berens, who happened to be a piano teacher. Her early lessons focused on ear training and dictation. These early music lessons fostered her love and influenced her becoming a composer later in life. Armer says that some of the major influences in her life include participating in a rhythm band when she was in kindergarten, the radio, and the records her siblings and parents would play around the house. She studied music under Darius Milhaud and Leon Kirchner for composition and Alexander Libermann for piano. She attended Mills College, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in 1961, the University of California, Berkeley from 1966 to 1968, and California State University, San Francisco, where she received a Master of Arts degree in 1972. She teaches composition and chairs the department at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and has performed and lectured throughout the United States. She helped co-found the organization Composers, Inc. Her papers are housed at UC Berkeley Music Library. Education In 1957, Elinor graduated from Davis High School. While she did not know it then, Elinor would eventually go on to be induced into the Davis Senior High School Hall of Fame. She went on to attend Mills College for her secondary education. While there, she tried out several different majors before deciding on majoring in music composition. Her Piano teacher, Alexander Libermann, had a great deal of influence on her pursuing the piano. Libermann was a very popular professor during his time, and gave a series of lectures on the piano - how to practice, play, and teach. Elinor graduated from Mills college in 1961. From there she continued on to study her masters at UC Berkeley, although she went on to complete her graduate degree in composition from California State, San Francisco.http://www.northworks.net/c_armer.htm Career Elinor Armer has traveled throughout the U.S. as well as abroad to perform.

It followed the Minerals Law of 1953, which established a system for obtaining permits to survey (but not drill) for petroleum. Despite the multiple changes of government and legal framework since its enactment, it remained in effect. It does not contain any provisions for natural gas drilling. In the 2000s, the Libyan government began work on drafting a new petroleum law. The law established a Petroleum Commission, which made decisions on whether or not to grant concessions. Initial drafts of the law stipulated that provincial governors had the power to appoint members of the commission, and also made final decisions on concessions. However, these powers were eliminated in the final version of the law, in what historian Dirk Vandewalle described as a rare example of the national interest overriding that of the provinces. Under the law, a contractor working for the National Oil Corporation is permitted to bring equipment into Libya free of import duties; however, this provision does not apply to contractors working for private oil companies, who are governed by the Administrative Contracts Regulation 2000. Amendments to the law in 1961 and 1965 altered the calculation of royalties. The 1961 amendments in particular meant that independent oil companies paid significantly less in taxes than the major oil companies.

This victory put an end to these raids for some time.Treadgold (1997), pp. 594‚Äì595 In early 1055, as Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (r. 1042‚Äì1055) lay dying, he was persuaded by his councillors, chiefly the logothetes tou dromou John, to pass the throne to the doux of Bulgaria, Nikephoros Proteuon. However, their plans were preempted by Constantine's aged sister-in-law Theodora, the last descendant of the Macedonian dynasty, who was brought out of her retirement in a convent and proclaimed \\"emperor\\" by the imperial guard shortly before Constantine's death.Garland (1999), pp. 165‚Äì166Treadgold (1997), pp. 596‚Äì597 A purge of senior officials and the leadership of the European military units followed.

Although Michael VI restored his rank, he refused to hand over the confiscated estates and fortune.Finlay (1853), p. 533 Ordered in 1057 to take 3,000 men to reinforce the army at Cappadocia, Nikephoros left the capital in a fit of rage and began plotting to overthrow Michael VI. On his arrival, he attacked and beat a representative of the emperor who countermanded Nikephoros's orders before throwing him in prison, which his officers took as a sign that Nikephoros was about to rebel.Finlay (1853), pg. 534 Releasing the imprisoned officer, they captured Nikephoros, blinded him and sent him to Constantinople. His capture precipitated the revolt that brought Isaac I Komnenos to the throne.  Family  Nikephoros Bryennios had one wife, named Anna, who had the rank of kouropalatissa.

It was translated into English by Charles Timothy Brooks in 1862. Titan, I Jean Paul called Titan his \\"cardinal and capital\\" novel. Divided not into chapters but into \\"jubilees\\" and \\"cycles\\",Jean Paul had a habit of using whimsical names for text divisions; in this case the terminology comes from the Lutheran theologian Johann Georg Frank (1705-1784) whose study of Biblical chronology, Novum systema chronologiae fundamentalis (1778), proposed a jubilee-period of 152 cycles, each of 49 years. See the comments after Cycle 9. it comprises some 900 pages and tells the story of the education of the hero Albano de Cesara, his transformation from a passionate youth into the mature man who ascends the throne of the small principality of Pestitz. In language and style the novel differs strikingly from other texts of Jean Paul. The narrative, despite its sentimental and effusive manner, and rich descriptions, is tightly organized and contains fewer digressions and side notes. This is often seen as a temporary approach to the classicism of Weimar, which Jean Paul at this time was subjecting to an intensive and critical examination. The rich imagery and comic misdirections are still present, and the novel remains challenging for today's readers. Jean Paul considered using the title Anti-Titan in order to express more clearly the idea of hubris, of the inevitable doom of the Himmelsst√ºrmer (\\"Heaven-stormers\\") of Romanticism. His aim was also to condemn \\"the indiscipline of the Saeculum\\" and the separation of the self from contemplation. In the characters of the novel (Roquairol, Schoppe, Gaspard, Liane, Linda) Jean Paul crystallizes various European controversies of the year 1800. In the end, all characters but the hero come to grief as a result of their one-sidedness. With Schoppe, the idealistic philosophy of Fichte is criticised; in Roquairol the aesthete and l'art pour l'art (Jean Paul's conception of the Weimar ideal); Gaspard encapsulates cold political calculation; Liane, a fanatical religiosity (pietism, the Moravian Church); in Linda the purportedly unseemly hubris of emancipated women. The contemplation of these examples teaches the hero to be harmonious, a mature concord of strengths rather than an individual of one concentrated power. It has been frequently commented, however, that the doomed characters are perhaps more interesting than the sometimes too smooth and perfect-seeming main character Albano. Gustav Mahler composed a 'tone poem' titled after this novel,Mahler's high regard for Jean Paul is mentioned on p. 119 of the translation of Bruno Walter's biography Gustave Mahler, London, 1958. although in the process of revising the work he dropped the name and the 2nd movement, and the work was transformed into Mahler's First Symphony, with the composer afterwards discouraging any attempt to seek connections. Erich Heckel was inspired by the figure of Roquairol while painting a portrait of his friend Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. NotesBibliography * Dorothea Berger. Jean Paul Frederic Richter.

He distinguished himself as an educator and contributor to post-colonial discourse on African self-government, and Third World non-alignment. He was the grandson of Edward Wilmot Blyden. Early years Picture of Blyden in his student yearsEdward Wilmot Blyden III was born Edward Wilmot Abioseh Blyden- Taylor on 19 May 1918, to Isa Cleopatra Blyden and Joseph Ravensburg Taylor in the \\"Baimbrace\\" neighbourhood of Freetown. As an infant, he suffered the effects of rickets brought on by malnutrition in the wake of the 1918‚Äì19 Spanish flu pandemic. While this affected his ability to walk in early childhood it was not a lasting disability. Edward and his sister Amina were raised by their mother, Isa Cleopatra Blyden and their Liberian grandmother, Anna Espadon Erskine,Stepping Forward: Black Women in Africa and the Americas Catherine Higgs, Barbara A. Moss, Earline Rae Ferguson (eds) Ohio University Press, 2002. who were both headmistresses of primary schools in the Muslim communities of Foulah Town and Fourah Bay even though the family were active members of the Zion Methodist Church, Wilberforce Street. He attended the Ebenezer Amalgamated Primary School. He attended the Wesleyan Methodist Boys High School and, after graduating, matriculated at Fourah Bay College. He worked as a teacher and briefly for the Sierra Leone Railway during the early 1940s. His earliest published essaysBlyden, Edward W.,(under pseudonym Adjai Onike) \\"The Need for Mass Education in Sierra Leone\\" (A review essay in Memorandum on the Education of African Communities) West Africa (London), January 1940. on African education and colonialism date back to these years. Student years in America Edward Wilmot Blyden with Edith Holden.After the Second World War, Blyden, was invited to continue his education at Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) in the United States where his grandfather had received an honorary doctorate. He graduated from Lincoln in 1948 with an A.B. degree and matriculated at Harvard University, where he earned M.A., MEd degrees in Education and began research for a PhD in Political Science. The subject of his doctoral thesisBlyden, Edward Wilmot Abi√≤su \\"Sierra Leone; the pattern of constitutional change, 1924‚Äì1951.\\", Harvard University was the pattern of constitutional change and emergence of African political thought in the twentieth century. During this period, he met with Edith Holden granddaughter of John Pray Knox with whom Blyden's family had longstanding historical connections and with whom he later worked on the definitive biography of his grandfather Edward Wilmot Blyden.Holden, Edith Blyden of Liberia, New York: Vantage Press, 1966. In 1950 he met and married Amelia Elizabeth Kendrick a native of Worcester, Massachusetts, and a graduate of Boston University. Politics and the Sierra Leone Independence Movement Blyden interrupted his graduate studies in 1954 to return to Sierra Leone where he took up a position as head of Extra Mural Studies at Fourah Bay College. He became increasingly active in the politics of independence and after a sensational series of Town-Hall lectures, he formed the Sierra Leone Independence Movement in 1957. Promoting the view that a newly independent Sierra Leone would not be well served by the fractious nature of party politics, he galvanised his followers with the Movement's signature call and response: \\"What's the Word? SLIM!\\" Prominent supporters of SLIM included regional and international Pan-Africanists like Nnamdi Azikiwe, Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore, Eric Williams, Julius Nyerere and John Henrik Clark who viewed the progress towards independence in Sierra LeoneGeorge Padmore, \\"Democratic Advance in Sierra Leone\\", The Crisis, March 1957. as part of a wider effort to forge an independent West Africa united by the same socio-political principles. In 1957, Blyden and Paramount Chief and Member of Parliament Tamba Songou Mbriwa of Fiama Chiefdom, Kono District lodged a formal protest at the Colonial Office in London against the illicit exploitation of Sierra Leone's diamonds, demanding a Royal Commission of Enquiry into serious riots in the Kono District. In the pre-elections of 1957, SLIM won no seats which disappointed Blyden and his supporters within and without the country.Five Elections in Africa: a group of electoral studies by Kenneth Robinson; W. J. M. MacKenzie (eds), Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1961. Blyden and Mbriwa went on to form an alliance, merging their parties to form the Sierra Leone Progressive Independence Movement (SLPIM) Blyden and supporters campaigning for SLIM At the eve of independence, a West Africa Correspondent's Report summed up Blyden and SLIM's impact on pre-independence politics as follows: Academic years in West Africa Blyden and senior academics at Fourah Bay College In 1960, Blyden was invited by Nnamdi Azikiwe to help build the University of Nigeria, Nsukka where he established the Department of Political Science and Diplomacy and the Department of African Studies. He was Dean of Faculties but made his most lasting impact on a generation of West Africans as the University Public Orator. Blyden was able to expose the student body to a wide spectrum of international scholars, including William Leo Hansberry, Arnold Toynbee, Basil Davidson, Leopold Senghor and others. At the outbreak of the Nigerian Civil War in 1966, he and his family moved to Freetown where he became Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and Director of African studies at Fourah Bay College (the University of Sierra Leone). First and foremost, Blyden considered himself a teacher, and strove to imbue a generation of bright young men and women with the knowledge, principles and self-confidence needed to guide Africa in a Post-Colonial world. The careers of notable Africans such as Peter Onu, James Jonah and others he taught or mentored are testament to his success. Non-Alignment and Cold War diplomacy Blyden was a first-hand observer and participant at many key events that would shape the geopolitics in the second half-of the 20th Century. Under the auspices of Harvard University, he was a student observer at the Treaty of San Francisco that formally ended World War II. He toured Asian and Far Eastern Universities as a visiting lecturer, coming in contact with intellectuals involved in Asian independence struggles.The Straits Times (Singapore), 11 January 1953.The China Mail (Hong Kong), 21 January 1953.The Nippon Times (Japan), 25 January 1953. In 1954 he was the sole delegate from colonial Sierra Leone to the Eighth General Assembly of UNESCO in Montevideo, Uruguay.New Nations and the 'Cold War' in The Montevidean (Montevideo, Uruguay), 16 November 1954 (Press Interview). Edward W. Blyden III at the 1954 UNESCO General Assembly in Uruguay Thus by the mid-1950s, Blyden's African perspective on post-colonial nationhood and self-determination was widely known and respected among Africans and Asians seeking to define the roles of post-colonial nations on the world stage. At the 1962 conference on international politics billed \\"New Nations in a Divided World: The international relations of Afro-Asian states\\", Blyden presented the paper African Neutralism and Non Alignment.Blyden, Edward Wilmot \\"African Neutralism and Non Alignment\\" in New Nations in a Divided World. K. L. London (ed.) Praeger, NY & London: 1963. The conference organizers would ultimately publish the conference proceedings in a book of the same name (Praeger, NY) edited by Kurt London, with the following commentary: > Of all current political and ideological concepts, few have stirred more > controversy than that of non-alignment-- the doctrine devised by those Afro- > Asian leaders who are seeking a 'third way' in the East-West struggle. Their > unwillingness to align themselves with either of the two great power blocks > now confronting each other cannot fail to have enormous and far-reaching > effects ‚Äì now and in the future ‚Äì upon the shape of the world. The publisher went on to say: In his contribution, Blyden reviewed the history and origin of African ideas on neutralism and non-alignment from James Aggrey and J. E. Casely Hayford, through Nnamdi Azikiwe and Kwame Nkrumah to the Bandung Conference. Blyden summarised the primacy of Africanism in the policy- making of newly independent nations: > A point that may be obvious but can hardly be overstated in any assessment > of African Policies of non-alignment is that African political leaderships > do not conceive of their policies as Eastern or Western, but as African. > Africanism is the touchstone of the policy-maker in the new African states. > It is noteworthy in this regard that serious writers on Africa have been > struck by the pervasiveness of the pan-African impulse in contemporary > African politics. Leading students like Padmore, Shepperson, Fyfe, > Hargreaves, and Dike have been unanimous in pointing to an intimate > interconnection between the ideas of pan-Africanism and African neutralism > and non-alignment. In 1971, Blyden was again given the chance to put the ideas on which he had built his academic and political careers into practice. Under the presidency of Siaka Stevens, Blyden was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary from Sierra Leone to the Soviet Union, and accredited to Romania, Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. During his first visit to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs to schedule a date for official presentation of his credentials, Blyden met Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and reminded him of their first meeting in 1949 at the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco. What followed was an extended conversation which also broke the protocol of conversations through translators: Blyden returned to his embassy to find an official invitation to present his credentials the following morning. On a later visit to Moscow, Blyden would be presented with a biography of his grandfather Edward Wilmot Blyden, published by the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Africa and Asia under the directorship of Anatoly Gromyko. Another surprise for Blyden was his meeting with former Harvard classmate, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, during President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 visit to Moscow; both of them now on the world stage. While accredited to Eastern Europe, he orchestrated three successful state visits to Sierra Leone by Marshal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, Premier Alexei Kosygin of the Soviet Union, and Nicolae Ceau»ôescu of Romania. Blyden negotiated important agreements between Sierra Leone and Warsaw Pact Countries for trade and development projects in Sierra Leone. From 1974 to 1976 he served as Sierra Leone's Permanent Representative to the United Nations where he was Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization. He was an influential voice of reason in the infamous *Zionism is racism* debateMoynihan, Daniel Patrick, A Dangerous Place, 1978, Chapter 9. that led to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 of 1975, placing Sierra Leone at the center of efforts to table the motion and presenting an Africanist perspective on Zionism first elaborated by his own grandfather in 1898.Blyden, Edward Wilmot, The Jewish Question, Liverpool: Lionel Hart and Co., 1898.Benyamin Neuberger, \\"Early African Nationalism, Judaism and Zionism: Edward Wilmot Blyden\\", Jewish Social Studies Vol. 47, No. 2 (Spring 1985), pp. 151‚Äì66. On his return from the UN, Blyden served as Special Adviser to the President, and played an active role during the 1980 OAU Summit in Sierra Leone, at which he was awarded the United Nations Peace Medal by the visiting U.N. Secretary General. Retirement years He received honorary degrees from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and Lincoln University. He gave the keynote speech at the 100th Anniversary of the University of Liberia (formally Liberia College), an institution at which his grandfather Edward Wilmot Blyden had been a founding Professor. Though much of his career was spent outside of Sierra Leone, Blyden remained deeply attached to the cultural life of his native Freetown. He was a member of the Zion Methodist Church of Wilberforce St. and an important patriarchal figure in the Muslim communities of Fullah Town and Fourah Bay. He was a Freemason and former Grand Master. He was an honorary member of the Akamori Hunting Society. Blyden's character and its lasting impression has been succinctly summarised by the anthropologist Joe Opala: > He was a man of strong opinions, and he was never shy to voice them. And > because he combined a vast amount of knowledge with his strong convictions, > you couldn't forget a conversation with him. Family Edward Blyden was married to Dr. Amelia Elizabeth Blyden (n√©e Kendrick), a retired professor. They have eight children: Edward Walter Babatunde Blyden, a businessman; Isa Jeanette Blyden, a Russian philologist and freelance radio journalist; Bai-Bureh Kendrick Blyden, a Power engineer and engineering consultant; Dr. Fenda Aminata Akiwumi, an assistant professor of environmental geographer and hydrogeologist; Henrietta Cleopatra Blyden, an ESL teacher and freelance writer; Dr. Eluemuno Richard Blyden, a biotechnologist, business-owner and Adviser to the Government of Sierra Leone; Edward Katib Blyden, of ChefBlyden.com; and Dr. Nemata Amelia Blyden- Bickersteth, an Associate Professor of African and African Diasporan History at George Washington University.

OROSA (1892‚Äì1945). Pioneering Food Technologist and Inventor . Retrieved 11 October 2010. She experimented with foods native to the Philippines, and during World War II developed Soyalac (a nutrient rich drink from soybeans) and Darak (rice cookies packed with vitamin B-1, which could also prevent beriberi disease), which she also helped smuggle into Japanese-run internment camps which helped save the lives of thousands of Filipinos, Americans, and other nationals. She introduced to the public the well-known banana ketchup. Orosa completed her bachelor's and master's degrees in pharmaceutical chemistry, as well as an additional degree in food chemistry. She was then offered a position as an assistant chemist for the state of Washington before returning to the Philippines in 1922 to focus on addressing the problem of malnutrition in her homeland. She invented many types of food to minimize the need of imported products to feed Filipinos. She took advantage of the abundant natural resources of the Philippine islands such as native fruits, crops and vegetables to make the Philippines self-sufficient. During World War II, Orosa joined Marking's Guerillas to fight for Philippines freedom. She invented over 700 recipes during her lifetime, including Soyalac and Darak, which saved thousands of lives during the war. She also invented a process for canning goods for the guerilla warriors fighting for the liberation of the Philippines. Without her food inventions, thousands of people would have died in internment camps, hospitals, and on the streets. Early and family life Maria Orosa (Historical Park and Laurel Park, Batangas Provincial Capitol Complex) Orosa was born on November 29, 1892 in Taal, Batangas, and was the fourth among the eight children of Simplicio A. Orosa and Juliana Ylagan- Orosa. Although her father died when she was still a child (and helped her mother in the family's general store), many of her siblings also became distinguished in the Philippines. Her elder brother, Engr. Vicente Ylagan Orosa Sr., became Secretary of Public Works and Communications, and, later, Chairman of the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) during the administration of President Ramon Magsaysay. Her brother, Dr. Sixto Ylagan Orosa Sr., became a pioneering doctor, and her nieces and nephews included banker Sixto L. Orosa, Jr., Philippine National Artist in Dance Leonor Orosa Goqui√±gco, businessman Jos√© R. L. Orosa, award-winning cultural journalist Rosalinda L. Orosa, and her biographer Helen Orosa del Rosario. As a government-sponsored scholar, Orosa earned a bachelor's and master's degrees in pharmaceutical chemistry, and an additional degree in food chemistry from the University of Washington. She worked in fish canneries in Alaska during her summer breaks in college. Career Although offered a job as an assistant chemist by the Washington state government, Orosa returned to the Philippines in 1922. She initially taught home economics at the Centro Escolar University, and later transferred to the Philippine Bureau of Science's food preservation division. Orosa wanted to help the Philippines become self- sufficient, as well as empower Filipino families. She organized 4-H clubs in the islands (which had more than 22,000 members by 1924), and traveled into the barrios to teach women how to raise chickens, preserve local produce, and plan healthy meals. Orosa invented the palayok oven to enable families without access to electricity to bake, and developed recipes for local produce, including cassava, bananas, and coconut. Her banana ketchup became a favorite condiment and cooking ingredient in the archipelago. She also developed wines and calamansi nip, a desiccated and powdered form of a citrus fruit also used to make reconstituted calamansi juice, banana ketchup, and is also used in other recipes. Orosa ultimately became the head of the Home Economics Division and organized its Division of Food Preservation. Using both her local and technical knowledge, Orosa made culinary contributions and taught proper preservation methods for native dishes such as adobo, dinuguan, kilawin and escabeche. During World War II, Orosa used her food science background to invent Soyalac (a protein-rich powdered soybean product) and Darak (a rice bran powder rich in thiamine and other vitamins which could also treat beri- beri). She also became a captain in Marking's Guerrillas, a Filipino guerrilla group organized by Marcos \\"Marking\\" V. August√≠n. The guerrillas helped U.S. forces fight the occupying Japanese troops and employed carpenters to insert Soyalac and Darak into hollow bamboo sticks, which were smuggled to the civilians imprisoned at the University of Santo Tomas and in Japanese-run prisoners of war camps in Capas, Tarlac and Corregidor. The powders saved the lives of many starving imprisoned guerrillas and U.S. soldiers. Her \\"Tiki- Tiki\\" cookies (made using Darak) also saved many civilian lives during wartime food shortages. Death and legacy Although her family and friends urged her to leave Manila for her hometown as American, Filipino, and Japanese forces battled to control the city, Orosa refused, insisting that, as a soldier, she needed to remain at her post. On February 13, 1945, Orosa died of shrapnel wounds after being hit in her government office during an American bombing raid. The hospital to which she had been taken was later also bombed, causing a shrapnel shard to pierce her heart and kill her instantly. The American Red Cross gave Orosa a humanitarian award for her food-smuggling efforts. Her niece Helen Orosa del Rosario in 1970 published Maria Orosa: Her Life and Work, which also included 700 of Orosa's recipes. The Philippines has officially recognized Orosa's contributions. Her home province, Batangas, installed a bust and historical marker in her honor. A street in Ermita, Manila (where the Court of Appeals of the Philippines is located), is named after her, as is a building in the Bureau of Plant Industry. During the 65th anniversary of the Institute of Science and Technology, she became one of 19 scientists who received special recognition. On November 29, 1983, the National Historical Institute installed a marker in her honor at the Bureau of Plant Industry in San Andr√©s, Manila. In commemoration of her centennial birth anniversary, the Philippine Postal Corporation issued a postage stamp in her honor. Her hometown of Taal, Batangas also celebrated the 125th anniversary of her birth on November 29, 2018. On 29 November 2019, Google celebrated her 126th birthday with a Google Doodle. On February 8, 2020, Orosa's tombstone was found at the Malate Catholic School, the site of the Remedios Hospital during the Second World War. The excavation was led by Isabel Picornell. It has been suggested that her body be transferred to the Libingan ng mga Bayani (LNMB) in Taguig.

In Christian theology, Jesus is sometimes referred to as a redeemer. This refers to the salvation he is believed to have accomplished, and is based on the metaphor of redemption, or \\"buying back\\". Although the Gospels do not use the title \\"Redeemer\\", redemption is used in several of Paul's letters. Leon Morris says that \\"Paul uses the concept of redemption primarily to speak of the saving significance of the death of Christ.\\"Leon Morris, 'Redemption' Dictionary of Oxford and his Letters (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1993): 784. Universality Christ the Redeemer by Titian (c. 1534), Palazzo Pitti, Florence. The New Testament speaks of Christ as the one Saviour for all people.On Christ's role as universal Saviour, cf. Gerald O'Collins, Salvation for All: God's Other Peoples, OUP (2008). The First Epistle of John says that Jesus is \\"the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the world\\" (1 John 2:2). Adherents of unlimited atonement interpret this to mean that Jesus' redemptive role is for all people without exception, while adherents of limited atonement interpret it as being for all people without distinction‚Äîfor Gentiles as well as Jews. The first Christians also recognized Jesus' redemptive role to be unique (without parallel), complete (as one who conveys the fullness of salvation), and definitive (beyond any possibility of being equaled, let alone surpassed, in his salvific function). In particular, his universal role means that through him the deadly forces of evil are overcome, sin is forgiven, their contamination purified, and the new existence as God's beloved, adopted children has been made available.For this section, and its respective themes and positions, compare Gerald O'Collins, Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus, OUP (2009), pp. 297‚Äì333. Cf. also O'Collins, Salvation for All: God's Other Peoples, cit.; id., Jesus: A Portrait, Darton, Longman & Todd (2008), Chs 11‚Äì12; id., Incarnation, Continuum (2002), pp. 36‚Äì42; J.A.

Dych, Darton, Longman & Todd (1978), pp. 193‚Äì195, 204‚Äì206, 279‚Äì280, 316‚Äì321. This New Testament sense of Christ's indispensable and necessary role for human salvation could be summarized by a new axiom: extra Christum nulla salus (\\"outside Christ no salvation\\"). This sense of his all-determining role in the whole redemptive drama is suggested by a fact: unlike the Old Testament, where various human beings could be called \\"saviour\\" (e.g., Judges 3: 9, 15, and 31), the New Testament gives the title \\"Saviour\\" only to God (eight times) and to Christ (sixteen times).

Located in the state of New South Wales, the region has played a pivotal role in the history of Australian wine as one of the first wine regions planted in the early 19th century.Johnson, Hugh, and Jancis Robinson. The World Atlas of Wine. London: Mitchell Beazley, 2005. Print. Hunter Valley Semillon is widely considered the iconic wine of the region but the Hunter produces wine from a variety of grapes including Shiraz, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Verdelho. Under Australia's wine appellation system, the Hunter Valley zone Australian Geographical Indication (GI) covers the entire catchment of the Hunter River and its tributaries. Within that, the Hunter region is almost as large, and includes most of the wine-producing areas, excluding the metropolitan area of Newcastle and nearby coastal areas, some national parks, and any land that was in the Mudgee Shire (at the western heights of the catchment). There are three named subregions in the Hunter region. These are the Upper Hunter Valley, Broke Fordwich and Pokolbin subregions. The Lower Hunter Valley is not strictly defined, but in general includes the Pokolbin subregion, along with the districts around Wollombi, Mount View, Cessnock and Lovedale. Much of the history of Hunter was played out in this area and it is generally what is referred as the Hunter Valley wine country. The majority of the Hunter Valley's most prestigious vineyards are located on the southern valley and foothills of the Brokenback Range (part of the Great Dividing Range). The topography of the Hunter includes mostly gently sloping hills with modest gradients. The one notable exception are the vineyards of Mount View just west of the town of Cessnock. The terrain of the Upper Hunter is noticeably flatter as the Goulburn River and other tributaries of the Hunter River dominate the area. The greater river system of the Hunter, which includes the Goulburn and important tributaries such as Giants Creek, do provide needed irrigation for areas such as the Upper Hunter than can be prone to drought condition. The success of the Hunter Valley wine industry has been dominated by its proximity to Sydney with its settlement and plantings in the 19th century fuelled by the trade network that linked the valley to the city. The steady demand of consumers from Sydney continues to drive much of the Hunter Valley wine industry, including a factor in the economy by the tourism industry. Wine zones of Australia. Hunter Valley is the dark green near the east coast. History The wine-making history of Hunter Valley begins with the European settlement of the Sydney and the New South Wales region of Australia in the late 18th century as a penal colony of the British Empire. The Hunter River itself was discovered, by accident, in 1797 by British Lieutenant John Shortland as he searched for escaped convicts. The region soon became a valuable source for timber and coal that fuelled the steamship trade coming out of Sydney.\\"Hunter Valley Wine Country.\\" Hunter Valley Wine Country Tourism 8 May 2010 Grapevines were planted in Sydney soon after its discovery in 1788 and as settlements fanned northward up towards the Hunter, government authorities actively encouraged plantings as a means of promoting both public sobriety and safety. The logic behind the promotion of viticulture and winemaking was that men tend to become more drunk and disorderly when under the influence of highly alcoholic spirits. If enough wine was provided, it was believed, it could be a moderate influence that could tame the \\"savagery\\". It was under these auspices that the grapevine followed land prospector John Howe as he cut a path through the Australian wilderness from Sydney up to the overland area in what is now known as the (Lower) Hunter Valley proper in 1820. Today, the modern Putty Road between the cities of Windsor and Singleton follows Howe's exact path and is a major thoroughfare for wine tourists coming into the Hunter Valley from Sydney. As previous plantings in the coastal areas around Sydney succumbed to the humidity and wetness, and plantings to the west were limited by spring frost damage, northern reaches leading to the Hunter became, almost by default, the wine region of the new colony.Halliday, James. \\"Regional Spotlight ‚Äì Hunter Valley. \\" Wine Pros. 29 October 2001. Web. 25 May 2010. James Busby and further plantings James Busby brought to the Hunter Valley plantings from Europe and South Africa. The first major planting in the Hunter Valley came in 1825 when James Busby, widely considered the father of Australian wine, purchased vineyard land between the settlements of Branxton and Singleton and named it Kirkton after his Scottish birthplace near Edinburgh. In 1831, Busby travelled extensively throughout Europe and South Africa, collected cuttings from over 500 vineyards, including six cuttings of Syrah from the Hermitage hill in the Rh√¥ne. When he returned, many of these cuttings were planted in the Hunter Valley at the Kirkton estate now owned by his brother-in-law William Kelman. In the 1830s, several vineyards were planted in the Hunter Valley, including the first vineyards by George Wyndham of Wyndham Estate, many with cuttings directly provided by Busby at Kirkton. In 1847, the Hunter Valley Viticulture Society was founded with the mission of expanding viticultural knowledge and improving techniques in the region. By the end of the decade, plantings had expanded from to over . Between 1866 and 1876 the region saw further expansion as the acreage of planted vines topped 1800.Halliday, James. Wine Atlas of Australia. Berkeley: University of California, 2007. Print. Most of the early vineyards of the Hunter were located in the northeast section of the valley in the fertile alluvial plains along the Hunter River. The river provided easy transport of the wine down to the seaside port of Newcastle and onto Sydney. By the 1860s, plantings began to move further south and west towards the foothills of the Brokenback range near Pokolbin and Rothbury where many of the most highly esteemed vineyards of the Hunter are now found. Mid-19th century to early 20th century In the mid 19th century, wines from the Hunter Valley began to garner international acclaim. In 1855, at the Paris Exhibition (notable in wine history for the unveiling of the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification), Hunter Valley wines won numerous awards from tasting panel judges. In the official report for the exhibition, the judges wrote \\"The [Hunter Valley's] wines included white wine akin to those of the Rhone; red light wines like those of Burgundy; Mousseux varieties with a bouquet, body and flavor equal to the first Champagnes; Muscat and other sweet wines, rivaling the Montignac of the Cape.\\"Johnson, Hugh. Vintage: the Story of Wine. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1989. Print. A Hunter Valley sparkling wine made from James King of Irrawang Vineyard bested the French Champagnes to win the honour of being served at the table of Emperor Napoleon III during the exhibition's closing ceremonies. The expansive growth of the Hunter Valley in the mid to late 19th century came directly from its monopoly position of the lucrative Sydney market. The provincial government of New South Wales had enacted regulations that placed prohibitive duties on wines from other areas such as Victoria and South Australia. This had the effect of limiting any competition for Hunter Valley winemakers in Sydney. But the turn of the 20th century brought a shifting dynamic to the Hunter Valley wine industry as the provinces on the Australian continent became federated into states and a new constitution was drafted that banned such interstate trade barriers. The opening of the Sydney market to the flux of out of state wine, as well as the changing public tastes from dry wines to sweet, fortified ports, muscats and sherry signalled a period of steep decline for the Hunter Valley. Following World War I, many returning Australian veterans were given land grants in the Hunter Valley. This temporarily produced an up-tick in plantings but the global Great Depression as well as a series of devastating hail storms between 1929‚Äì30 caused many growers to abandon their vineyards. Some of the land was bought up by the growing wine estates of Tyrrell, Elliotts and Wyndham that would later become driving forces behind the Hunter Valley's next boom period.\\"Hunter Valley ‚Äì Australian Wine Regions \\" Wine Diva Australia.\\" Wine Diva. 1 June 2010 Another pivotal figure during this period was Maurice O'Shea of Mount Pleasant vines in the Pokolbin area. While many producers in Australia were focusing on fortified wine, O'Shea continued to espouse the virtue of Australian dry table wines. O'Shea's foresight would pay off as consumer taste shifted towards drier styles of wine in the 1950s and 1960s. A flurry of plantings began in the Hunter, including 1963 establishment of Lake's Folly by a Sydney surgeon, Dr. Max Lake. Along with Rudy Komon, Johnny Walker and wine columnist Len Evans, who all believed in the future of the Australian wine industry, Lake begin to extensively plant red wine varietals, including the reintroduction of Cabernet Sauvignon to the Hunter Valley. 1960s to present-day Chardonnay production in the Hunter Valley was a major part of the Australian wine boom of the 1990s. In the 1960s, a Sydney wine merchant named Leo Buring began marketing the first commercially successful Hunter Valley Semillon under the label \\"Rhine Gold\\". In 1971, Murray Tyrrell released Australia's first commercial bottling of Chardonnay which signalled the beginning of the Australian Chardonnay craze. According to wine experts Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson, Tyrrell's Vat 47 Hunter Valley Chardonnay was the wine that \\"launched a million bottles.\\" From 1956 to 1976, plantings in the Hunter Valley grew from to over . Despite a slight reduction during the global recession of the 1980s, the Australian wine boom of the 1990s pushed plantings even further to over . While the Hunter Valley has been supplanted by the massive Riverina wine region as the largest producer of New South Wales wine, it still accounts for around 3% of Australia's total wine production and is one of the country's most recognisable regions. Today there are over 120 wineries in the Hunter, producing a wide range of wine. Climate While the Hunter Valley is usually grouped in with the rest of Australia as having a Mediterranean climate,MacNeil, Karen. The Wine Bible. New York: Workman Pub., 2001. Print. the climate is actually humid subtropical, with distinctive maritime influences from the Pacific Ocean. With its northerly latitude and close oceanic influences, the Hunter Valley is one of Australia's hottest and wettest wine regions. Flanked by mountains to the west and north the Hunter Valley acts as a funnel, pulling cool ocean breezes into the area. This effect is similar to the cooling that Napa Valley receives from San Pablo Bay in California. Without these cooling breezes, quality wine grape production would be nearly impossible. However, with those cooling breezes also comes heavy rainfall and periodic cyclonic storms in the summer and autumn months. In the summer, the average daily temperature regularly exceeds while during the winter the temperature averages around .http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi- bin/climate/change/averagemaps.cgi?map=tmean&season;=0608 Through the growing year, January tends to be the warmest month while July is usually the coolest. Temperatures during the peak growing month of January average between , with the temperature becoming progressively hotter the further inland you move away from the cooling influence of the sea. During the growing season the Hunter Valley receives an average of 7.3‚Äì7.5 hours of sunshine a day, but with the cloud cover coming in off the ocean the sunlight is slightly diffuse which gives the vines some protection from heat stress. During the growing season the Lower Hunter will average around 2070 degree days (Celsius) with the Upper Hunter having 2170 degree days putting it under the Winkler heat summation scale as a Region IV. Mid-latitude westerly winds bring high pressure weather front that alternate with cold fronts on the winter. This leads to generally drier conditions in the winter months of July and August. In the summer, southeasterly winds bring weather fronts harbouring extensive amounts of moisture. Between October and April more than two thirds of the region's annual rainfall will fall with January and February being the wettest months. As much as of rain can fall during harvest months, creating the Hunter's biggest viticultural hazard, though the inverse problem of winter drought can also be a problem. The rain, coupled with the heat, encourages high relative humidity in the region and subsequent threat of mould. During the growing season months of October‚ÄìApril, the 3pm average for relative humidity in the Lower Hunter is 49%, while it is 43% in the Upper Hunter. Wine regions and subregions The Hunter Valley Wine Zone Australian Geographical Indication was registered on 1 May 1996 and is approximately the entire Hunter River catchment. It contains only one named wine region, Hunter. The Hunter Wine Region Australian Geographical Indication was declared on 18 March 1997. It is not as large as the Hunter Valley zone, but includes most of the significant vineyards. It does not extend east of the Pacific Highway. The Hunter region has three subregions. The three recognised subregions of the Hunter Wine Region are Broke Fordwich (registered 2 September 1997), Pokolbin (registered 29 July 2010) and Upper Hunter Valley (registered 29 July 2010). Broke Fordwich Broke Fordwich surrounds the towns of Broke, Fordwich and Bulga. Some of the oldest vines in the Hunter Valley were planted in 1924 around the village of Fordwich. The Broke Fordwich subregion is between the Upper Hunter Valley to the northwest and the lower Hunter Valley (including Pokolbin) to the east. Broke Fordwich is sheltered on the south side of the valley on the Fordwich Sill volcanic red clay and nearby free-draining alluvial soils and sandy loam. It has lower rainfall and higher diurnal temperature variation than Pokolbin. The Broke Fordwich area is located along the Hunter River tributary of the Wollombi Brook near the suburb of . The area was founded in 1830 by Major Thomas Mitchell who named the region after his fellow Napoleonic War veteran Sir Charles Broke-Vere. The area's location along the \\"convict trail\\" helped it to flourish as convicts were shuttled through to work in the coal mines of Cessnock.\\"About Broke Fordwich Wine Region.\\" Broke Fordwich ‚Äì Hunter Valley 1 June 2010. In September 1997, it was granted official sub- region status of the Hunter Valley. For most of the Hunter Valley's history, Broke Fordwich was noted for the quality of its fruit. Max Lake, of Lake's Folly, noted in 1970 that \\"Much of the reputation of Pokolbin rests with fruit from Fordwich\\". The Broke Fordwich subregion includes the communities of Broke, Bulga, Fordwich and Milbrodale. Many of the vineyards of the area are located on the undulating hills around the villages of Broke and Bulga leading up to the southwestern edge of the Brokenback range. The large Yellow Rock escarpment that border Broke also has numerous vineyards and is the regions dominant geographical feature. The area is one of the warmest in the Lower Hunter with some continental influences due to extenuating foothills of the Brokenback range that particularly encircle the area and block many of the breezes coming off the coast. Broke Fordwich accounts for around 14% of all the Hunter Valley's plantings. More than third-quarter of the vineyard land in the area is dedicated to Chardonnay, Semillon, Verdelho, Shiraz, Pinot noir and Merlot. Other varieties grown in the area include Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Chambourcin, Malbec, Traminer, Barbera, Trebbiano, Viognier, Sangiovese, Tempranillo and Dolcetto. Pokolbin The Pokolbin subregion, which surrounds provides most of the grapes known as \\"Lower Hunter Valley\\". It covers an area including and west of the road between Cessnock and Branxton, but stops short of both of those places. The eastern boundary is Black Creek east of that road, and the western boundary is the Pokolbin State Forest. The area includes numerous wineries, ranging from large multi-national to small family run operations, which are a popular tourist destination. In addition to long-established names like Drayton, Lindeman's, Tulloch, Lake's Folly and Tyrrell, newer plantings from the likes of Brokenwood Wines, Don Francois, Allandale, Petersons and Bimbadgen can be found. Much of the rolling countryside around Pokolbin is under vine with the traditional varieties Shiraz and S√©millon still dominating but extensive plantings of Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and the occasional plot of Pinot noir can be seen. Despite hot summers and freezing winters with frequent frost presenting a constant challenge to vineyard managers and winemakers, the area is a successful wine growing region thanks to mountains that encircle three sides of the valley, the cloud cover, and afternoon easterly sea breezes which, during summer, help to mitigate the blazing sunshine and keep humidity moderated on the valley floor. Soil types vary from rich red volcanic soil from the long-extinct volcano of Mount View and sandy loam which benefits most white varieties. The red volcanic soil is found mostly on the southern ridges. However, it can be found in patches on the valley floor. Over the decades, the style of Hunter whites and reds has changed vastly, from robust, muscular reds exhibiting the famous Hunter Valley \\"sweaty saddle\\" and extraordinarily long-lived Semillon whites to reds showing more fruit, complexity and delicacy and whites exhibiting fruit-driven characters. Upper Hunter Valley The main town in the Upper Hunter Valley subregion is Muswellbrook. The Upper Hunter Valley is the most northern and western subregion of the Hunter region, on higher slopes of the Hunter Valley. The Upper Hunter region was first planted in 1860 by a German settler named Carl Brecht. From his vineyard planted at the junction of Wybong Creek and the Goulburn river, Brecht's wines would win numerous gold medals at international wine competitions in the 1870s. Brecht's success would spur some interest in the area but the same turn of the 20th century events that saw decline throughout the Hunter Valley would compound to virtually extinguish all viticulture in the Upper Hunter. It wasn't until the 1960s when Penfolds purchased land near Brecht's old Wybong estate that significant viticulture interest in the Upper Hunter re-emerged. Through many years of trial and error, the viticulturalists at Penfolds were able to determine that the area was most suitable for white wine grape varieties. In comparison to the Lower Hunter, the Upper Hunter receives less overall rain ( annually to Lower Hunter's ). As the vast majority of this rainfall takes place during the late summer and early autumn, irrigation is a necessity for many vineyards during the early growing season of the spring and summer. Being further inland, the Upper Hunter receives less maritime influence from the cooling sea breezes and has a much hotter heat summation with 2170 degree days (Celsius) to the 2070 degree days generally seen by the Lower Hunter. Several small wineries operate in the region. The Upper Hunter has experienced a decline in vineyard area since the withdrawal of large wine producers Rosemount and Arrowfield from buying large quantities of Upper Hunter grapes early in the 21st century. Viticulture Thin-skinned grapes like Semillon are prone to developing various rots. Some, like Botrytis cinera (pictured), can be desirable and used to produce dessert wines known as \\"stickies\\". Like most New World wine regions, there is little to no government restrictions on the type of viticultural practices used in the Hunter Valley. Growers are free to plant whatever grape variety they wish, use any pruning or vine training system, and harvest as large or small of yields as they wish. To that extent, there is a wide range of viticultural practices seen in the Hunter Valley though some commonality does occur. As with many areas of Australia with labour shortages, viticulture in the Hunter is highly mechanised with machine harvesting the norm and experiments in mechanical pruning and leaf pulling also widely practised. Harvest usually takes place from mid-January to early March. The high humidity and propensity for harvest rains leads many growers to use open canopy management techniques and trellising as well as frequent leaf pulling in order to keep mould and rot at bay. Some examples of vine training systems found in the Hunter including the Scott Henry, Smart-Dyson and V-Trellis. In the Upper Hunter, the Vertical Shoot Positioning (VSP) is often used in areas that have problem with sunburn. Despite the generally wet climate, irrigation is often used in the slightly drier Upper Hunter where the winter and early growing seasons are prone to drought. Hazards The chief viticultural hazard in the Hunter Valley is the threat posed by vintage season rains. Site selection on well drained soils are considered of vital importance and much effort is put into ensuring the canopy is open so air flow can help dry the grapes off.Domin√©, Andr√©, Eckhard Supp, Armin Faber, and Thomas Pothmann. Wein. [K√∂nigswinter,Germany]: Tandem, 2008. Print. Of particular concern is bunch rot often caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea. In the production of late harvest wines, such as Semillon, Botrytis can be desirable and is known as noble rot. But for other grape varieties, particularly red wine grapes, the fungus is unwelcome with its infection described as grey rot.Steel, Christopher C. \\"Fruit Rot Control in Hunter Vineyards. Providing Growers with Tools to Stop the Rot\\" Rep. REGIONAL INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION (RITA) PROJECT. Web. 15 May 2010. In the late 1990s, research in Hunter Valley vineyards discovered that a wide range of pathogens caused various occurrences of bunch rot in the vineyards. These other pathogens included Colletotrichum acutatum (ripe rot), Greeneria uvicola (bitter rot) and other fungi from the genera of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Alternaria. Susceptibility of certain wine grape varieties were found to increase as the grapes reached higher Brix sugar levels. Further research in the 2000s, showed that some of the open canopy techniques used to prevent Botrytis grey rot may actually promote the development of some of these other types of rot. Ripe rot, in particular, seemed to thrive at the higher ultraviolet B (280‚Äì320 nm) light exposure that open canopies allow. To compound the potential problem for Hunter Valley wine growers is that, as of 2010, there wasn't any fungicides registered for use for this disease. =Other concerns= Kangaroos that like to feed on the tender buds and shoots of grapevines can be an occasional vineyard nuisance. The unique environmental pressures of the Hunter Valley also conspire to give growers problem with \\"dieback diseases\\" that damage the wood parts of the vine and eventually lead to death. While the fungus Eutypa lata is present in the Hunter, research in the 2000s indicated that another pathogenic species related to Botryosphaeria is also present in the area. Semillon vines, in particular seem to be susceptible to Botryosphaeria (also known as bot canker) while, conversely, Eutypa dieback is rarely observed in the variety. Vines suffering from Eutypa die-back and bot canker exhibit similar wood symptoms and similarly experiences reduce growth and yields. A major difference between the two is that bot canker do not exhibit the same outward foliage symptoms that Eutypa die-back leave on the leaves and buds of the vine.Creaser, Mette, Sandra Savocchia, Catherine Hitch, and Trevor Wicks. Survey of the Hunter Valley and Mudgee Wine Regions for the Grapevine Trunk Disease Eutypa Dieback. Rep. South Australian Research and Development Institute. Web. 18 May 2010. In addition to the pests noted above, vineyards in the Hunter Valley are usually grafted on phylloxera resistant rootstock to help keep the louse at bay. During the growing season kangaroos are frequent threats to the young buds and shoots of grapevines, requiring tall barb wire fences to keep the hopping creature out. Ever present nuisances near harvest time are the frequent birds that descend upon the area. Grape varieties The most widely planted grape varieties in the Hunter Valley, in descending order, are Chardonnay, Semillon and Verdelho among the whites and Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot among the reds.\\"Hunter Valley Research Foundation \\" Web. 1 June 2010. Prior to the late 1960s, there was very little Chardonnay found in Australia. In the Hunter Valley Penfolds has a small experimental planting. According to Murray Tyrrell of Tyrrell Vineyards, one night he jumped the barb wire fence of Penfolds and pruned a couple cuttings from Penfolds' vine and planted them in his vineyard. Whether or not that story is true is hard to prove but Tyrrell's 1971 Vat 47 Chardonnay is widely credited with ushering in the Australian Chardonnay craze of the late 20th century. Today in the Upper Hunter Valley, Chardonnay account for more than 70% of the areas planted and is sometimes blended with Semillon. Hunter Valley Chardonnay is characterised by its rich, oaky flavours with peaches and cream notes. Shiraz grapes growing in the Hunter. James Busby's collection is the likely origin of Hunter Valley Shiraz and today the Hunter Valley is home to some of the oldest own rooted Shiraz vine in the world with some vineyards boasting vines that are in excess of 120 years of age. Hunter Valley Shiraz is characterised but its astringent, gamy noted but has a tendency to develop in the bottle over 20 to 30 years into a silky, texture earthy wine with notes reminiscent of a Rhone. Traditionally Hunter Shiraz has carried the descriptor of \\"sweaty saddle\\". While this was once thought to be a terroir characteristic of the areas volcanic soils, it is now known to be caused by ethyl-4-phenol that comes from the exposure of the wine to certain strains of yeast in the Brettanomyces family.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" Dorling Kindersley 2005 While there were likely some plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon in the 19th century, Hunter Valley Cabernet seemed to vanish at the turn of the 20th century and didn't regain a footing in the Hunter until Max Lake reintroduced the variety along with the other Bordeaux varietals of Petite Verdot and Malbec in 1963. Today, Hunter Valley Cabernet exhibits more the regional traits of a Hunter Shiraz than it does with the varietal expression of Cabernet exhibited in Bordeaux and California. It tends to be very earthy and is usually cross blended with wine from regions outside the Hunter. Maurice O'Shea of Mountain View pioneered planting of Pinot noir which he used to blend with Shiraz. The Pinot noir grown in the warm Region IV climate of the Hunter exhibits very little varietal similarities with the Pinot noirs of Burgundy and Oregon where it tends to produce a low acid, fruity wine. While an obscure grape mostly associated with the fortified wines of Madeira, Verdelho has developed a niche in the Hunter Valley where its thick skin and high acids tolerate the humidity and heat. Semillon Semillon. Hunter Valley Semillon is widely considered the iconic wine of the region. First planted in the region in 1830, the grape has been produced and variously labelled as Hunter Valley Riesling, Shepherd's Riesling, Hock, Rhine Gold, White Burgundy and Chablis. In its youth it is exhibits austere lemon, grassy notes but with 10 plus years in the bottle it develop into a rich, minerally wine with biscuit notes. The character of the wine changes so much that it often even fools professional tasters of being an oak aged Chardonnay that has gone through malolactic fermentation, this despite the fact that it likely hasn't seen a touch of oak or lactic acid bacteria. In the Upper Hunter there has been some experimentation with oaked aged Semillon but remained more the exception rather than the norm.Robinson, Jancis. The Oxford Companion to Wine. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2006. Print. Described by Oz Clarke as one of the \\"wine world's enigmas\\", the grapes unique profile is attributed to the harsh climate and humidity of the Hunter which coax this low acid grape to higher acid levels than it achieves in the cooler climate of Bordeaux. Typical harvest figures for Hunter Valley Semillon are between 6.8‚Äì7.4 g/l acidity and 2.8-3 pH while in Bordeaux the grape is usually harvested at around 4.8‚Äì5.5 g/l and 3.1‚Äì3.3 pH. It is the unique climateClarke, Oz. Oz Clarke's Australian Wine Companion: an Essential Guide for All Lovers of Australian Wine Orlando, Florida: Harcourt, 2004 that shapes the Hunter Valley's distinctive Semillon. While the textbook profile of Semillon is that of a thin skin, neutral grape that is prone to low acids and fatness in the Hunter it matures over decades into a honeyed wine with toasty biscuit notes and a mineral backbone. Despite almost always being unoaked, a mature Semillon gives the textural impression of spending years in the barrel.Clarke, Oz, and Margaret Rand. Oz Clarke's Encyclopedia of Grapes. New York: Harcourt, 2001. Print. Soils Overall, the Hunter Valley has more soils (mostly hard, acidic patches of poorly draining heavy clay) that are unsuitable for viticulture than they have areas that are ideal for growing grapes. The soils of the Lower Hunter vary widely from sandy alluvial flats (often planted to Semillon), to deep friable loam (often planted with Shiraz) and friable red duplex soils. In the Upper Hunter, the rivers and creeks of the region contribute to the areas black, silty loam soils that are often overlaid on top of alkaline clay loam. Among the hills of the Brokenback range are strips of volcanic basalt that are prized by growers for their tendencies to restrict vigor and concentrate mineral flavours in the grapes. Wine industry A cellar door sign for a winery in the Hunter. A cellar door at a winery in the Hunter. The Hunter Valley wine industry is dominated by its proximity to Sydney. It has also become a significant element in the local economy in the tourism industry. The significance of tourism can be exemplified by the employment of more people in that industry than wine production. In 2008, a total of of wine grapes were planted in the Hunter Valley with dedicated to red grapes and planted to white grapes. At harvest time, 9,263 tonnes of red wine varieties were crushed for an average of 5.5 tonnes/ha. Among white wine varieties, 19,310 tonnes were crushed with an average of 6.9 tonnes/ha. Around 28% of the red grapes and 63% of the white grapes crushed were from estate grown-fruit. Roughly a third of the red grapes and a fifth of the white grapes crushed were imported from outside the Hunter Valley. Many of these imported grapes come from other New South Wales Wine regions such as the Cowra, Mudgee, Orange and Riverina and are labelled under the large Southeast Australia designation. The wine laws for the Hunter Valley follow the same regulations as the rest of Australia, as governed by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. For a grape variety to appear on the wine label as a varietal wine it must account for at least 85% of the wine. If the wine is a multi-grape blend it must list the grapes on the wine in order of importance with the exact percentages of each grape listed somewhere on the wine. If the wine is labelled with a region then at least 85% of the grapes must be sourced from that area.

Alyn Warren. Directed by Frederic Sullivan, nephew of the famous composer Sir Arthur Sullivan, and scripted by Albert Ray, the film is based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1858 poem The Courtship of Miles Standish. No prints of the film are known to exist and it is now presumed lost.Progressive Silent Film List: The Courtship of Miles Standish at silentera.com Background and production Actor Charles Ray had risen to fame in the mid to late 1910s playing young, wholesome fun country bumpkins in silent comedy films directed by Thomas H. Ince for Paramount Pictures. By 1920, Ray was earning $11,000 a week (approximately $ today). He left Paramount in 1920 after Adolph Zukor reportedly refused to give him a substantial raise, and formed his own production company, Charles Ray Productions. The company produced several fairly successful comedy films from 1920 to 1922, several of which were written by (and featured assistant direction from) Albert Ray, Charles Ray's first cousin. By 1922, Ray had grown tired of playing country bumpkin roles and decided to reinvent himself as a dramatic actor in romantic leading man roles. Against the advice of producers and friends, Ray chose to make a historical epic costume drama based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1858 narrative poem The Courtship of Miles Standish. After failing to secure financial backing from a major studio, Ray put up $500,000 of his own money to fund the project. The scenario for the film, taken from Longfellow's poem, was written by Albert Ray, with direction by Frederic Sullivan (although all creative decisions on the film rested entirely with Charles Ray himself). The film was shot in part at the Charles Ray Studio located on Sunset Boulevard (now known as the KCET Studios) in Los Angeles which Ray purchased shortly after leaving Paramount in 1920. On one of the studio's sound stages, Ray had a 180-ton rocking replica of the Mayflower built that cost a reported $65,000 (approximately $ today). Other sequences were shot in Lake Arrowhead, California where Ray had three full sized log cabins built solely for exterior shots. By the end of filming, Ray had spent over $1 million of his own money and the film's budget reportedly rose to a reported $3 million (approximately $ today). CastReception Upon its release, The Courtship of Miles Standish received some favorable reviews from critics, but was not well received by audiences. Frederick James Smith described the film as \\"merely dull\\" and that \\"the acting is not much.\\" Smith wrote, \\"Ray seems oppressed by the historical significance of John, and he allots himself entirely too much film. Enid Bennett makes Priscilla a simpering and almost insufferable ingenue.\\" The film was a box office failure, losing $1 million and effectively ruining Charles Ray's career. Ray's production company went bankrupt and he was forced to declare personal bankruptcy. For his part, Frederic Sullivan never directed another film. Ray's career would never rebound from the failure of The Courtship of Miles Standish. He continued acting, but appeared in smaller budget productions, in supporting roles. During the sound era, Ray appeared in bit parts and filed for bankruptcy a second time in 1934. He died of a systemic infection in November 1943.

The archetypical domain is found in StAR (Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), a mitochondrial protein that is synthesized in steroid-producing cells. StAR initiates steroid production by mediating the delivery of cholesterol to the first enzyme in steroidogenic pathway. The START domain is critical for this activity, perhaps through the binding of cholesterol. Following the discovery of StAR, 15 START-domain- containing proteins (termed STARD1 through STARD15) were subsequently identified in vertebrates as well as other that are related. Thousands of proteins containing at least one START domain have been determined in invertebrates, bacteria and plants to form a larger superfamily, variously known as START, Bet v1-like or SRPBCC (START/RHOalphaC/PITP/Bet v1/CoxG/CalC) domain proteins, all of which bind hydrophobic ligands. In the case of plants, many of the START proteins fall into the category of putative lipid/sterol- binding homeodomain (HD) transcription factors or HD-START proteins. Representatives of the START domain family bind different substances or ligands such as sterols (e.g., StAR or STARD1) and lipids like phosphatidylcholine (phosphatidylcholine transfer protein, also called PCTP or STARD2) and have enzymatic activities. Ligand binding by the START domain in multidomain proteins can also regulate the activities of the other domains, such as the RhoGAP domain, the homeodomain and the thioesterase domain. Structure The crystal structure of START domain of human MLN64 shows an alpha/beta fold built around a U-shaped incomplete beta-barrel. Most importantly, the interior of the protein encompasses a 26 √ó 12 √ó 11-Angstrom hydrophobic tunnel that is apparently large enough to bind a single cholesterol molecule. The START domain structure revealed an unexpected similarity to that of the birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 and to bacterial polyketide cyclases/aromatases. Human proteins containing the START domain  START domain-containing proteins in the human are divided into five subfamilies. An exception is StarD9 whose activity remains unknown. Other proteins also exist in the human with domains that are members of the START- based superfamily such as PITP, but are not part of the START domain itself. Mutations in STAR D9 (KIF16A) have been associated with a syndrome which includes severe ID, characteristic features, epilepsy, acquired microcephaly and blindness.Okamoto N, Tsuchiya Y, Miya F, Tsunoda T, Yamashita K, Boroevich KA, Kato M, Saitoh S, Yamasaki M, Kanemura Y, Kosaki K, Kitagawa D (2017) A novel genetic syndrome with STARD9 mutation and abnormal spindle morphology.

It was first published in the late 1970s, then revived under the same name by a new team from 1983‚Äì1990. The two versions shared personnel and featured roughly the same counter-cultural philosophy, irreverent journalism, strident opinion and fondness for satire, cartoons and popular culture. The editors and contributors of The Cane Toad Times were motivated by opposition to political events and attitudes in Queensland under the Bjelke-Petersen Government (1968‚Äì1987). The first issue of The Cane Toad Times was published in May, 1977 and thereafter more or less quarterly, with 22 issues divided between two collectives. The first collective (1977‚Äì1979) produced 7 issues, while the second collective (1983‚Äì1990) produced a total of 15 issues. First collective (1977‚Äì1979) The first edition appeared in May 1977 ‚Äî the year of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, punk rock and the Sex Pistols‚Äô \\"God Save The Queen‚Äô\\". The first cover featured a cane toad wearing the British royal crown. Originally a stapled quarterfold, the magazine assumed its eventual tabloid size by the fourth issue. \\"Cane Toad Times\\" was chosen as the name of the magazine because the founders wanted a mascot that represented Queensland ... part of the appeal of the toad was the element of repulsion it evoked, the feeling of fear and loathing that typified being young in the Bjelke-Petersen era.Jiggens, John \\"Personal Stories: Media Activism, The Cane Toad Times.\\" Media Information Australia 55 (1990): 65‚Äì74. Key writers in the original collective included John Jiggens, David Richards, Gerard Lee, Mirtek Pasciezny, Bing Di Mucci, Craig Munro, Bill Thorpe, Sue McLeod, Janice Knopke and Landon Watts. They teamed up with a group of cartoonists who produced 4ZZZ-FM's \\"Radio Times\\": Matt Mawson, Terry Murphy, Damien Ledwich and Ross Hinckley. Later additions to the collective included Flark March, Tim Low, Robbie Wyatt and Lillian Rosser. Funds were raised by selling advertisements to local businesses in the counter-cultural scene and benefits featuring Brisbane bands including Razar, The Go-Betweens and The Riptides. The editions of the first collective, not numbered at the time, were: # The Royal Cane Toad (May 1977)http://www.textqueensland.com.au/item/journal/ceb4ebe5516a7eaa98e67732c16d0414 # The Cane Toad goes to Mullumbimby (July 1977) # Giant Mutant Cane Toad (Sept/Oct 1977) # The Incredible Peanut (December 1977) # The Phantoad cover (April 1978) # From Behind the Peanut Curtain: Joh, Howard the Duck and Cane Toad (June 1978) # Juvenile Delinquency (June 1979) The first collective folded after a look-alike news magazine, Time Off, with Matt Mawson doing layout, appeared in 1978. While the core work of the magazine was a sustained satirical attack on Bjelke-Petersen and his police enforcers, it also celebrated seemingly mundane but often surprisingly exotic aspects of Queensland popular culture: giant roadside attractions, local speedway heroes, banana worship.Stockwell, Stephen.

In 1983, while working at the University of Queensland student newspaper Semper Floreat, Matt Mawson and Damien Ledwich teamed with Anne Jones to resurrect The Cane Toad Times. After getting the blessing of the few remaining members of the previous collective, the trio started to build a new group of contributors, many of whom were also involved in radio 4ZZZ and student politics, notably, Stephen Stockwell, Mark Bracken, Andrew Fraser, Ian Cook and David Pyle. A number of top-class illustrators also joined including Michael Barnett, Debbi Brown, Judy Dunn, Lisa Smith and Sasha Middleton. At this time The Cane Toad Times adopted the subtitle: \\"The Eccentric Voice\\". The fifteen issues of the second incarnation of The Cane Toad Times were: # Queensland, September 1983 # Religious Mysteries, Winter 1984 # Sex Leisure and Technology, Spring 1985 # Food and Corruption, Summer 1985 # Death and Style, Winter 1986 # Science Fiction and the Family, Spring 1986 # Hot Summer, January 1987 # Cars and Romance, Winter 1987 # Fear and Clothing, Summer 1988 # Birthday, Autumn 1988 # Music and Money, Spring 1988 # Art and Perversion, Summer 1988‚Äì1989 # Superstition, Autumn 1989 # Sydney Exposure, Summer 1989‚Äì1990 # Green and Bear it, Winter 1990 The return of editor Robert Whyte to Brisbane in 1985 sometime between issues 5 and 6 brought a much-needed injection of enthusiasm and professionalism. By issue 9, the subtitle had changed to \\"Australia‚Äôs Humour Magazine\\" and distribution went Australia-wide. Continuing themes included the corruption of Queensland politics, Big Things, hat-wearing drivers and the other absurdities of life in 'The Sunshine State'.\\"Satire & Social Change: Cane Toad Times\\" by Robert Whyte, pp 36‚Äì39, Social Alternatives, Vol 8, No 3, October 1989 Simon Stocks argued in Queensland Review that in addition to exposing and criticising official corruption in Queensland, The Cane Toad Times had a softer side, representing \\"the affable Queensland\\" in short stories such as \\"Bobby Skurm\\" by Denis Peel set in the late 1950s about the first kid to skateboard down Camp Hill, and \\"Denying the faith\\" by Errol O'Neill about an exchange between a State School kid and two Catholic boys, and Sean Mee's \\"Des ne refuse rien\\" about going to the dump. Stocks suggested these stories were indicative of a sort of \\"ghettoisation\\" of the counter-culture who developed their own cultural views about what was valuable in the Queensland experience.Queensland Review Vol. 5, No. 1, May, 1998 In 1987 The Cane Toad Times found a hero in Tony Fitzgerald QC, who led the Fitzgerald Inquiry. Background of The Fitzgerald Inquiry The Fitzgerald Inquiry, led by Tony Fitzgerald QC, commenced in May 1987 and ended in July 1989. The Inquiry examined the \\"Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct\\" in which Queensland police, including the Police Commissioner, were engaged in illegal gambling and receiving sexual services from brothels in the Fortitude Valley in Brisbane.\\"The Fitzgerald Inquiry (1987‚Äì1989)\\". http://www.cmc.qld.gov.au/asp/index.asp?

The exhibition focussed on Mr Fitzgerald's personal collection of memorabilia and the influence that the Inquiry had upon Griffith University's staff and alumni. Exhibits relating to The Cane Toad Times included: * Issues of The Cane Toad Times (collection of and comments by Professor Steve Stockwell ) * \\"Corruption\\" the Game (collection of ToadShow Pty Ltd, comments by Ms Anne Jones) * Tony Fitzgerald Fan Club T-shirts (collection of ToadShow Pty Ltd, comments by Ms Anne Jones) For the exhibition a giant working version of \\"Corruption\\" was displayed on the floor of the gallery. The display and pieces were designed by Professor Paul Cleveland, Director Queensland College of Art, and staff and students of QCA Liveworm studio. The Corruption Board Game, ‚Äòthe game that gets you rotten‚Äô, appeared in The Cane Toad Times, Spring 1988, issue 11. In an interview with Zenovia Pappas conducted for \\"The Fitzgerald Collection\\" Anne Jones outlined the thinking behind the original design for The Corruption Board Game: \\"The idea came from one of the [Cane Toad Times] editors, Mark Bracken, who wanted to develop a board game that brought in all of the elements that were being investigated by the Fitzgerald Inquiry. so there was Vice, Crime, Gambling ... and Drugs. Although the Fitzgerald Inquiry really didn‚Äôt get into the whole drugs aspect of crime and corruption, which was a bit of a criticism at the time, the nature of the game had to have 4 main areas. So we brought drugs into ours. It brought in all the elements that were being talked about in the Fitzgerald Inquiry.\\" In the same interview The Cane Toad Times editor Anne Jones explained the history and impact of the Tony Fitzgerald Fan Club T-shirt: \\"It became obvious very quickly when the Fitzgerald Inquiry started that it was all gathering momentum, it was like a dam stemmed and Tony Fitzgerald obviously had a mind to get it all out in the open. And of course at The Cane Toad Times we immediately saw a marketing opportunity and we set up the Tony Fitzgerald Fan Club. And it wasn‚Äôt really a fan club, I have to say, it was just a t-shirt. The t-shirt had a drawing by one of The Courier Mail cartoonists Ricardo, that we got him to do. So we basically did up an artwork with Tony Fitzgerald holding a magnifying glass and the words, ‚ÄúOfficial Member Tony Fitzgerald Fan Club.‚Äù [...] Quentin Dempster who was the compere of the local 7:30 Report [...] was photographed in the newspaper wearing one.

The exhibition focussed on the writers, cartoonists and political activists who came together to produce The Cane Toad Times. The magazine, distributed nationally, dealt with popular culture issues including cane toads, Big Things, Bubbles Bathhouse and Queensland corruption. The exhibition drew on the collection of the State Library of Queensland and University of Queensland's Fryer Library's protest march posters, original copies of The Cane Toad Times, photographs, T-shirts and artwork by cartoonists including John Shakespeare, Matt Mawson, and Judy Dunn, in the Philip Bacon Gallery, level 4, State Library, Stanley Place, South Bank, Brisbane.cane Toad Times poking fun in a police state The exhibition documents the birth of The Cane Toad Times in 1977 when Premier of Queensland, Joh Bjelke-Petersen was a decade into his reign. During this period Joh Bjelke-Petersen's government had banned the soundtrack of the musical Hair, declared a state of emergency during the 1971 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia, banned other political demonstrations and arrested of hundreds of street-marching protestors. Joh Bjelke-Petersen believed he was chosen by God to lead Queensland, claiming his 15 years living alone in a converted cow-bail, clearing 40 hectares of brigalow a day, gave him a better education than an Oxford degree. His conservative approach found favour with the prejudice and backwoods suspicion of many Queenslanders, especially outside the towns, where a country vote could be worth up to five times as much as a vote in the city in an electoral mal-apportionment known in Queensland as the gerrymander. Political protests were crushed, cultural and music venues shut down, and young people, considered to be troublemakers, were harassed. Protesters were considered misfits and malcontents, typified by Joh as ‚Äòfriends of the dirt‚Äô, the ‚Äòanti-nuclear lot‚Äô and the ‚Äòeverything for the aborigines crowd‚Äô. By 1983, Joh's Nationals were ruling in their own right with the simple slogan \\"Joh. Queensland.\\".Full catalogue of the exhibition The year of 1977 coincided with the onset of two crucial years of pitched battle on the campuses and streets of Brisbane. The battle was between Joh and his cohorts on one side ‚Äî and on the other a rag-tag alliance of civil liberties lawyers, marxists, students, academics, unionists, musicians, actors and women. Joh presided over an apparently conservative establishment yet below the surface was a deeply corrupt police force in bed with politicians, prostitution racketeers, SP betting, drug laundering, illegal casinos and payoffs. Chris Masters, whose Four Corners expos√© The Moonlight State would help bring down the corrupt regime, explained: \\"Hector Hapeta‚Äôs main brothel Top of the Valley commanded a useful corner position at a major Fortitude Valley junction. It seemed to me that in the tradition of giant pineapples and giant prawns you see at coastal tourist towns, a giant penis would have not been out of place. It would have been no less blatant.\\" In 1983, Anne Jones and Damien Ledwich took the long view with The Cane Toad Times ‚Äî Joh Bjelke- Petersen couldn't last forever. Labor was back in power nationally and was supporting the Queensland political and cultural left with arts funding, notably funding the Popular Theatre Troupe, an agit-prop ensemble satirising Joh's banana republic in factories and shopping centres. Anne Jones and Damien Ledwich were both 4ZZZ and Semper Floreat alumni, equipped with radio and newspaper communication skills. The Cane Toad Times 1983‚Äì1990 was a mixture of hard-hitting journalism, rants, cartoon strips, parodies, lists, short stories, quizzes and bold graphic design. Among The Cane Toad Times editors, it was Damien Ledwich who was most insistent on the need to seize the mainstream publishing tools of mass production and wide circulation. He was not interested in one-off performance, or appealing to the arts ghetto. The Cane Toad Times V.2's finest moment was probably Issue 4's detailed list of everything rotten in the state of Queensland. Compiled by Stephen Stockwell, this built on Kev Hooper's landmark revelations under parliamentary privilege. Phil Dickie‚Äôs subsequent newspaper reports in The Courier-Mail led to the broadcast on Four Corners of The Moonlight State. Having watched the Four Corners expose, acting Premier Bill Gunn ordered an inquiry the following day, 11 May 1987. The Fitzgerald Inquiry, led by Tony Fitzgerald QC, ran from May 1987 and ended in July 1989. These were the halcyon days of The Cane Toad Times. On TV, there were nightly re-enactments of Fitzgerald Inquiry hearings. Still in government, but reeling in the polls, the Nationals in parliament rebelled and deposed Joh, choosing Mike Ahern instead. Joh asked the Governor of Queensland to sack all his ministers so he could continue to rule. The Governor declined. By 2 December 1989, it was all over ‚Äì Wayne Goss and Labor swept to power. Former civil liberties lawyer and Labor Party State Secretary Peter Beattie was given the job of chairman of the parliamentary committee overseeing the Criminal Justice Commission, now the Crime and Misconduct Commission. Beattie went on to be Queensland Premier.

According to most sources, she never lived in the mansion, but chose to reside with her sister in a row house across the street from the mansion. Early life Gertrude was born in New York on May 12, 1842. She was the youngest of seven children born to Bernard Rhinelander (1800‚Äì1844) and Nancy Elizabeth Mary (n√©e Post) Rhinelander (1806‚Äì1895) and was descended from a family that had resided in New York City since the 17th century. Her older siblings included Charles Edward Rhinelander, who married Mathilda Frances Cotheal; Emily Rhinelander, who married Dr. John Watson; and Laura Virginia Rhinelander, who did not marry. Her maternal grandparents were U.S. Representative Jotham Post Jr. and his second wife, Magdalen (n√©e Blaau) Post. Her paternal grandparents were William Rhinelander and Mary (n√©e Robert) Rhinelander. Rhinelander's great- great grandfather, Philip Jacob Rhinelander, was a German-born French Huguenot who immigrated to the United States in 1686 following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, settling in the newly formed French Huguenot community of New Rochelle, where he amassed considerable property holdings which became the basis for the Rhinelander family's wealth. Personal life On June 6, 1876, she married stockbroker Francis William \\"Frank\\" Waldo (1836‚Äì1878), despite the fact that he had been bankrupted during the Panic of 1873. In May 1877, before Frank's untimely death in 1878, she gave birth to: * Rhinelander Waldo (1877‚Äì1927), who became the Fire and Police Commissioner of New York. In 1882, she received an inheritance valued at $360,000 (equivalent to $ today) that consisted largely of real estate. By 1889, she had reportedly been in a relationship with lawyer Charles H. Schieffelin. She sued him in 1899 to reclaim $12,000 (equivalent to $ today) she said he had misappropriated from her that he said he was going to invest the money in various railroad securities. In a counterclaim, Schieffelin said that he had invested the money as directed and that the two of them were going to be married. Waldo responded that she would never have married Schieffelin because of his earlier divorce. Gertrude died of apoplexy on May 27, 1914. After a funeral at the Hotel Netherland, she was buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. In 1915, The New York Times reported that at the time of her death, she was over $135,000 (equivalent to $ today) in debt, consisting primarily of a pair of loans she received from the L. V. Rhinelander Estate. 72nd Street residence The Rhinelander Mansion. She bought a piece of property located at the corner of 72nd Street and Madison Avenue in 1882, announcing plans to construct a home that one journal called \\"quite unique in design\\". However, she did not go ahead with construction and lived with her sister Laura for many years in a row house on the opposite side of 72nd Street. Construction of the mansion was started in 1894 while she was living at the Savoy Hotel. She sold some of the property that she had inherited around 1896 and used the proceeds to cover a portion of the construction costs of two new adjoining homes on the property, which totaled $340,000, with the remaining balance in a $195,000 mortgage. Completed by 1898, the four-story house, which included a ballroom lit by 1,000 light bulbs and furnished at a cost of $1 million, was never occupied during Gertrude Rhinelander Waldo's life. It was assumed Gertrude would move in upon returning from a European trip in 1898 (when construction was nearing completion), but not only did she not move into the residence, much of the rare European furnishings were never unpacked, and remained in the crates on the lower floors, as they came from the steamer. Later, facing financial difficulties including owing large amounts on the two homes, Rhinelander reached an agreement to sell the house through a broker, but reneged on the deal when the papers effecting the transfer were ready to be signed, and said \\"I don't think I'll sell\\" and walked out on the offer. By December 1909, it was announced that the dilapidated structure was to be placed up for auction January 12, 1910, in order to satisfy a $10,000 judgment, $9,221 in unpaid taxes, and a prior $150,000 mortgage. According to available articles, Rhinelander was apparently able to re-purchase the property and two houses at auction and retain ownership for one more year, though they remained unoccupied and non-revenue generating. In September 1911, Rhinelander finally let one of the mansions go at foreclosure, the smaller 72nd Street house, in order to partially cover judgments against her. In exchange for loans to further reduce her obligations, Rhinelander also transferred ownership of the larger Madison Avenue home to her unmarried sister, Laura, along with other property that Waldo owned in Lower Manhattan on Washington Street and Barclay Street. Legacy The Rhinelander Mansion was vacant until 1921 when it was subdivided into commercial use on the street level and two apartments on the four floors above. It now houses the flagship men's clothing store of Polo Ralph Lauren that took 18 months to renovate in 1983 at a published cost of $14‚Äì15 million.

Function = Bactericidal permeability-increasing protein  Bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is a potent antimicrobial protein of 456 amino acids that binds to and neutralises lipopolysaccharides from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. BPI contains two domains that adopt the same structural fold, even though they have little sequence similarity.  Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein  Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) is an endotoxin-binding protein that is closely related to, and functions in a co-ordinated manner with BPI to facilitate an integrated host response to invading Gram-negative bacteria.  Cholesteryl ester transfer protein  Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a glycoprotein that facilitates the transfer of lipids (cholesteryl esters and triglycerides) between the different lipoproteins that transport them through plasma, including HDL, LDL, VLDL and chylomicrons. These lipoproteins shield the lipids from water by encapsulating them within a coating of polar lipids and proteins.  Phospholipid transfer protein  Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) exchanges phospholipids between lipoproteins and remodels high-density lipoproteins (HDLs).  Palate, lung and nasal epithelium carcinoma- associated protein  Palate, lung and nasal epithelium carcinoma-associated protein (PLUNC) is a potential host defensive protein that is secreted from the submucosal gland to the saliva and nasal lavage fluid. PLUNC appears to be a secreted product of neutrophil granules that participates in an aspect of the inflammatory response that contributes to host defence. Short palate, lung and nasal epithelium clone 1 (SPLUNC1) may bind the lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative nanobacteria, thereby playing an important role in the host defence of nasopharyngeal epithelium. Bacterial permeability family member A1 (BPIFA1/SPLUNC1) is an innate protein that is secreted basolaterally from healthy, but not asthmatic, human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs).

A spectacular collection of furniture and wooden artifacts was excavated by the University of Pennsylvania at the site of Gordion (Latin: Gordium), the capital of the ancient kingdom of Phrygia in the early first millennium BC. The best preserved of these works came from three royal burials, surviving nearly intact due to the relatively stable conditions that had prevailed inside the tomb chambers. The Gordion wooden objects are now recognized as the most important collection of wooden finds recovered from the ancient Near East. The group comprises over 100 fine wooden artifacts, including tables, a bed, a throne, serving stands, stools, footstools, plates, spoons, boxes, a parasol, and 12 carved wooden animals. Several pieces of furniture are highly ornate, profusely inlaid with geometric patterns that exhibit sophisticated types of symmetry, and featuring designs that symbolize the Phrygian Mother Goddess Matar (Kybele). The furniture from the largest tomb at Gordion, Tumulus MM, is associated with King Midas, the powerful Phrygian ruler of the eighth century BC. The wood has been conserved over a period of 30 years using innovative methods developed by an international team of conservators; these methods are now considered standard for the treatment of dry archaeological wood. The good state of preservation of the Gordion wooden objects has allowed scientists to identify the woods used and investigate their deterioration. Chemical analyses of the residues from the associated bronze vessels have indicated how the bronzes were used with the furniture - and have even determined the menu of a royal Phrygian funerary feast. Several of the most elaborate pieces have been mounted for display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara, Turkey. Ancient wooden artifacts from Gordion The central Anatolian site of Gordion was first excavated by Gustav and Alfred K√∂rte in 1900 and then by Professor Rodney S. Young of the University of Pennsylvania in a major campaign between 1950 and 1973.K√∂rte and K√∂rte, Gordion. Young, Three Great Early Tumuli. Among the many exceptional Phrygian artifacts recovered were more than one hundred wooden objects dating to the eighth century BC‚Äîa rare find, since organic materials seldom survive in buried conditions. The wood discovered by the K√∂rte brothers consisted mainly of furniture fragments from a tumulus burial (K-III), which were significant but too fragmentary to be well understood. Young‚Äôs excavations, however, produced a spectacular collection of wooden furniture and other types of objects, many of which were in relatively good condition. View of Tumulus MM at sunset. These came mainly from three early royal tumuli (Tumulus MM, Tumulus P, and Tumulus W), along with carbonized remains from the destruction level of the city mound. Young died in 1974, before finishing his final report on the excavation of these tombs, but his monograph, Three Great Early Tumuli, The Gordion Excavations Final Reports, Volume 1, was published posthumously by a group of his colleagues, based on his original notes. Three Great Early Tumuli detailed the excavation of the burials and their grave goods in preliminary interpretations and working drawings. During the production of this volume, many of the early interpretations of the wooden artifacts were found to be incorrect, and a reassessment of the finds was begun by Dr. Elizabeth Simpson, now professor of ancient art and archaeology at the Bard Graduate Center, New York, NY. In 1981, Simpson went to Turkey to photograph and draw the objects and discovered that the wood was deteriorating. lt was believed that the reason for deterioration of wooden objects was the use of pressured water in order to enter the tomb back in 1957. As a result, wooden objects which remained intact for almost 3000 years damaged badly by the excavation team led by Rodney Young. A project to study and conserve the Gordion wooden artifacts was then organized under her direction with the support of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Work has been carried out since that time by the Gordion Furniture Project team in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations (Anadolu Medeniyetleri M√ºzesi), Ankara, Turkey. More than 40 archaeologists, conservators, scientists, and artists have been affiliated with the project since its inception, with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Geographic Society, the 1984 Foundation, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, the Getty Grant Program, and other foundations and individual donors.

Tumulus MM Rodney Young named the largest burial mound at the site Tumulus MM‚Äîfor ‚ÄúMidas Mound,‚Äù after the famous Phrygian king Midas, who ruled at Gordion during the second half of the eighth century B.C.The king buried in Tumulus MM.Young eventually came to believe that the tomb‚Äôs occupant was not Midas but rather his father, although in either case the wooden finds from the burial can be associated with King Midas. When Midas took the throne on the death of his father, he surely would have officiated at the funeral, with the grave goods provided by him for the deposition.Simpson, ‚ÄúCelebrating Midas.‚Äù The historical King Midas was a contemporary of the Assyrian king Sargon II (r. 721‚Äì705 BC) and was also well known to the Greeks. Midas was the first foreigner to make an offering at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi, according to the Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote that the king had dedicated his throne, which was ‚Äúwell worth seeing.‚ÄùHerodotus 1.14. Unfortunately, this tantalizing comment tells us little about the appearance of the throne of Midas. However, the magnificent wooden furniture from Tumulus MM at Gordion suggests that the throne was likely made from beautiful woods with carved and inlaid decoration, including a complex of geometric patterns that reflected the power of the Phrygian royal house and its connection to the Phrygian mother goddess Matar (Kybele).Simpson, ‚ÄúPhrygian Furniture from Gordion,‚Äù 198-201.View of the Tumulus MM grave goods, 1957.Tumulus MM produced an array of priceless artifacts: 170 bronze vessels, some with deposits of organic residues; 10 bronze-and-leather belts; more than 180 bronze fibulae (ancient safety pins); pottery vessels containing the remains of food; and 15 pieces of fine wooden furniture.Young, Three Great Early Tumuli, 100‚Äì190. Simpson and Spirydowicz, Gordion Wooden Furniture, 35‚Äì52. For a detailed discussion, see Simpson, The Furniture from Tumulus MM, and appendices, listed by author under References below. The exact nature of the furniture was not clear to Young and his team when they entered the chamber in 1957, as many of the objects had broken along the lines of the joinery, with their constituent parts dispersed on the tomb floor. The first thing the excavators saw was the skeleton of the king lying on a mass of textiles, covering what Young thought was a four- poster bed. To the east of the ‚Äúbed‚Äù were several furniture legs scattered among remnants of cloth. Leaning against the east wall were two ornate, inlaid objects, called ‚Äúscreens‚Äù by Young and initially identified as ‚Äúthrone backs.‚Äù To the south of these, a fancy inlaid table had collapsed with its frame intact, and nearby were the tops and legs of eight ‚Äúplain‚Äù tables. Most of the bronze vessels found in the tomb had once been hung on the walls or placed on the tables, but all had fallen to the floor. The inlaid table, Tumulus MM The inlaid table, called the ‚ÄúPagoda Table‚Äù by Young because of its exotic design and decoration, was made of 40 major wooden components.Simpson, ‚ÄúReconstructing an Ancient Table.‚Äù Elizabeth Simpson and Nazif Uygur constructing the Plexiglas mount for the inlaid table, 1989.The table had three legs, with lion-paw feet, and three structural supports that rose from the feet to prop up the frame at its corners. The four-sided frame was carved as a series of panels, connected by double bars, and inlaid with geometric patterns such as fields of squares or diamonds, configurations of hooks, rosette-like designs, and mazes. Some of these patterns appear elsewhere as markings on early figurines and clothing, and survive on women‚Äôs dowry textiles and ritual cloths in Europe and Anatolia up to the present. Evidence suggests that these designs were protective and empowering, with connotations of procreation and fertility. The inlaid table was thus decorated with apotropaic and magical imagery, suggesting that it may have had a ritual function. It was also a practical, portable banquet table, with four handles and a tray-shaped top. Boxwood was used for the frame and legs, juniper for the inlay, and walnut for the table top. In 1983, the table was reconstructed for display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, where it could be seen assembled for the first time in 2700 years. The mount was refurbished and the display reinstalled in 1989.Simpson and Payton, ‚ÄúRoyal Wooden Furniture from Gordion,‚Äù 45-46. The plain tables, Tumulus MM The other eight tables found in the tomb were simpler versions of the inlaid table.Simpson, ‚ÄúBanquet Tables at Gordion,‚Äù 136-137. Each had three curved boxwood legs and a tray- shaped top. The tops of seven of the tables were made of walnut; the wood of the top of the eighth table was probably maple or cherry. Contrary to Young‚Äôs earlier supposition, the legs were not steam bent but were made from naturally curved or trained branches. Tenons at the tops of the legs were fit into ‚Äúcollars‚Äù that extended down from the lower surface of the table tops. Research has shown that this system of joinery was widespread in antiquity, attested in the Middle Bronze Age tombs of Jericho and in the Pazyryk burials of the fourth century BC.Simpson, ‚ÄúFurniture in Ancient Western Asia,‚Äù 1654‚Äì1655, 1662‚Äì1666, 1668‚Äì1669. The serving stands, Tumulus MM The Tumulus MM serving stands, 1957.Young's ‚Äúscreens‚Äù were made of boxwood, inlaid with juniper, with walnut top pieces and curved ‚Äúlegs‚Äù set into the front faces. At the center of each face was an inlaid rosette, supported by two curved legs with stylized lion-paw feet. These elements were set within a grid of inlaid square designs surrounded by thousands of tiny diamonds and triangles. Most of the square designs were symmetrical with respect to rotations of 180 degrees, which allowed several basic designs to be turned and flipped to form derivative versions, adding complexity and obscuring the underlying patterns in which the basic designs had been arranged.Simpson, ‚ÄúThe Phrygian Artistic Intellect,‚Äù 29-34. This surprising play with symmetry indicates that the Phrygian woodworkers were clever, imaginative artisans with a pronounced mathematical orientation. Detail of the central rosette, serving stand A.This impression was confirmed by an analysis of the prominent designs at the center of the screen faces, which have now been identified as religious symbols. The rosette represented the Phrygian goddess Matar and the curved legs her two attendant lions, in an abstract version of the figures in the niche of Arslan Kaya, the monumental rock-cut shrine of the Phrygian highlands.Simpson, ‚ÄúPhrygian Furniture from Gordion,‚Äù 198-201. The Tumulus MM screens thus took the form of portable shrines of the goddess Matar. Each ‚Äúscreen‚Äù had a top piece, supported by a back leg and diagonal struts. Research has now shown that the ‚Äúscreens‚Äù were not ‚Äúthrone backs‚Äù but serving stands.Simpson and Spirydowicz, Gordion Wooden Furniture, 41‚Äì42. The top pieces featured large wooden rings that had held small bronze cauldrons, ten of which were found nearby in the tomb. Also found near the stands were two bronze ladles, which had undoubtedly been used to transfer the contents of the cauldrons into other vessels. The Tumulus MM serving stands have been assembled for display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations.Simpson and Payton, ‚ÄúRoyal Wooden Furniture from Gordion,‚Äù 47. Simpson, The Furniture from Tumulus MM, 159‚Äì163. Painting by Greg Harlin of the funeral ceremony before the Tumulus MM burial. The king‚Äôs coffin, Tumulus MM At the north of the chamber was the king‚Äôs ‚Äúbed,‚Äù which has now been identified as an open log coffin, carved from a huge cedar log, with ledges extending out at both ends. Four large pine blocks had braced the coffin body, and inlaid rails were socketed into the sides. This new information led to a fuller understanding of the circumstances of the king‚Äôs burial. The remains of the coffin, as disposed on the tomb floor, showed that a funeral ceremony had taken place before the interment: the coffin had clearly been assembled elsewhere before the burial, then disassembled, and its parts placed in the chamber in something other than their original positions.Simpson, ‚ÄúMidas‚Äô Bed and a Royal Phrygian Funeral.‚Äù The contents of the tomb, which were largely banquet furnishings, must have been used for the ceremony. Analysis of the food and drink residues produced the menu of the funerary banquet. The feast included a spicy stew, made with barbecued sheep or goat, honey, wine, olive oil, and most likely lentils, seasoned with anise or fennel. The small bronze cauldrons that sat in the tops of the serving stands had contained a mixed fermented beverage of grape wine, barley beer, and honey mead.McGovern, Glusker, Moreau, Nu√±ez, Beck, Simpson, Butrym, Exner, and Stout, ‚ÄúA Funerary Feast Fit for King Midas.‚Äù The beverage served at the king‚Äôs funeral has been reconstructed by Dogfish Head Brewery as the award-winning ‚ÄúMidas Touch,‚Äù which is now widely available. This collaborative research allowed the funeral ceremony before the burial to be reconstructed in a painting by Greg Harlin.Simpson, ‚ÄúCelebrating Midas,‚Äù 26. Tumulus P This rather complete picture has aided in the interpretation of the Tumulus P and Tumulus W burials. These tombs produced wonderful wooden finds, but they are largely fragmentary because the roofs of both chambers had collapsed, crushing the contents within. Tumulus P, excavated in 1956, covered the tomb of a small child, who was buried with bronze vessels, fibulae, and belts; iron implements; painted and monochrome pottery; and a glass bowl‚Äîas well as 21 or more pieces of furniture and 49 other wooden objects.Young, Three Great Early Tumuli, 7‚Äì77. Simpson and Spirydowicz, Gordion Wooden Furniture, 52‚Äì67. The serving stand, Tumulus P The wood finds included a ‚Äúscreen,‚Äù which, like its Tumulus MM counterparts, was actually a serving stand. The top piece, back leg, and face of the stand were made of boxwood. The face was carved in openwork and inlaid with juniper and yew in a profusion of geometric patterns. As with the Tumulus MM serving stands, this stand too featured a large rosette at the center supported by abstract lion legs, suggesting that it had also represented a shrine of the Phrygian goddess Matar.Simpson, ‚ÄúPhrygian Furniture from Gordion,‚Äù 198-201. The inlaid, studded stool, Tumulus P The Tumulus P stool reconstructed for display.Found near the stand in the southwest corner of the tomb were pieces of a carved wooden stool, inlaid in geometric patterns and studded with bronze tacks. The stool was a colorful production, assembled from alternating strips of boxwood and yew. The boxwood strips, where inlaid, were inlaid with yew, and one yew strip was inlaid with boxwood. The two faces were joined at the top by undecorated strips, and at the bottom by two stretchers, carved on their top and outer faces. The stool was reconstructed on a Plexiglas mount (1993) and is now on display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations. The design of this stool is unusual, and can only be understood in reference to the Tumulus MM inlaid table. The two faces of the stool were conceived with such a table in mind, representing the main features of the three-dimensional table ‚Äúcollapsed‚Äù into two dimensions in a clever intellectual conceit.Simpson, ‚ÄúThe Phrygian Artistic Intellect,‚Äù 35. Not content with this amusing play with form and dimension, the cabinetmakers then negated the force of the metaphor by alternating the colored woods, producing the impression of a series of dark and light stripes. Other furniture and wooden artifacts from Tumulus P Animal combat, Tumulus P.Many other interesting pieces of furniture were recovered from the Tumulus P burial. The ‚ÄúTripod Tray Table,‚Äù found at the north of the chamber, was named for its massive, boxwood tray- shaped top. The table had three curved legs, each with a stylized lion-paw foot and a large ring at the top. Nearby were the remains of another fancy table, called the ‚ÄúMosaic Table‚Äù by Young because of its boldly inlaid table top. The top was made of boxwood boards, joined edge to edge and inlaid with strips of yew in a pattern of squares and crosses. Also found in the tomb were two plain tables, six or more stools, two footstools, a small chair or throne, and a carved and inlaid bed. Other wooden finds include a parasol, a box, eight spoons or ladles, and 23 plates and bowls. Among the most charming of the wooden objects from Tumulus P are 12 small animals, including two lions, a lion and bull in combat, a griffin eating a fish, two bulls, and a leaping ram or goat‚Äîtoys for the tomb‚Äôs young royal occupant. Tumulus W Tumulus W screen, 1959.The Tumulus W burial, excavated in 1959, contained bronze and pottery vessels, bronze fibulae, a bronze-and-leather belt, and fragments of several wooden objects.Young, Three Great Early Tumuli, 196‚Äì218. Simpson and Spirydowicz, Gordion Wooden Furniture, 68‚Äì71. These included the remnants of a ‚Äúscreen,‚Äù which was apparently a serving stand like those from the Tumulus MM and Tumulus P burials. Its front face was carved in openwork and studded with bronze tacks. Although the ‚Äúscreen‚Äù is only partially preserved, it had clearly been an extraordinary piece of furniture. Five or more wooden plates from the tomb are of particular interest because of their method of manufacture. Close examination has revealed tool marks indicating that the plates were made on an ancient reciprocating lathe‚Äîthe earliest evidence for the lathe from a securely dated archaeological context.Simpson, ‚ÄúEarly Evidence for the Use of the Lathe in Antiquity.‚Äù The City Mound The destruction level of the city mound yielded carbonized fragments of what may be a serving stand, an inlaid table, and other elaborate pieces of furniture, fitted with bronze studs and brackets as well as finely carved ivory plaques.Simpson and Spirydowicz, Gordion Wooden Furniture, 171‚Äì173. Recent scientific advances have allowed the charcoal to be identified, indicating that boxwood, maple, yew, oak, and pine are present. Research into the form of the city mound objects is currently underway; consolidation of the carbonized wood has been deemed unadvisable and will not be undertaken. Research, conservation, and scientific analyses Conservation of the wooden artifacts from Gordion has been ongoing since 1981, initiated by Robert Payton, now conservator at the Museum of London.Payton, ‚ÄúThe Conservation of an Eighth Century B.C. Table from Gordion.‚Äù Since 1990, work has been carried out by a team of conservators, conservation scientists, preparators, and graduate student interns in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara, under the direction of Professor Krysia Spirydowicz, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario. The preservation method developed by Payton was adapted and refined to treat over 40 pieces of furniture and more than 50 wooden objects from the three tumuli at Gordion.Spirydowicz, ‚ÄúThe Conservation of Ancient Phrygian Furniture from Gordion, Turkey.‚Äù Spirydowicz, ‚ÄúConservation of the Wooden Furniture from Tumulus MM.‚Äù Study of the artifacts revealed that the wood was very fragile when handled. Since the wood was very light in weight and retained little of its original cellular structure, consolidation was necessary in order to strengthen the wood, using a dilute solution of Butvar B-98, a synthetic polymer based on polyvinyl butyral. The same polymer was utilized in more concentrated form to carry out repairs; for particularly fragmentary objects, glass microspheres were added to the solution to make a paste for filling gaps and reinforcing joins.Spirydowicz, Simpson, Blanchette, Schniewind, Toutloff, and Murray, ‚ÄúAlvar and Butvar: The Use of Polyvinyl Acetal Resin for the Treatment of the Wooden Artifacts from Gordion, Turkey.‚Äù Conservators Latif √ñzen, Krysia Spirydowicz, and Nancy Love, with the Tumulus P stand in storage, Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara.A wood species analysis was begun in 1983 by Professor Burhan Aytuƒü of Istanbul University, and is now under the direction of Professor Robert Blanchette, Department of Wood Pathology, University of Minnesota.Aytuƒü, ‚ÄúLe Mobilier fun√©raire du roi Midas I.‚Äù Aytuƒü, Blanchette, and Held, ‚ÄúWood Species Analysis.‚Äù Robert Blanchette is also supervising a wood pathology analysis, which aims to understand the types of degradation present in the wood and the causes of the decay.Blanchette, ‚ÄúAssessment of Wood Deterioration in the Furniture and Coffin from Tumulus MM.‚Äù The graffiti on the serving stands from Tumulus MM have been studied by Professor Lynn Roller, University of California, Davis.Roller, ‚ÄúGraffiti on the Wooden Serving Stands from Tumulus MM.‚Äù The textiles associated with the furniture from Tumulus MM are the subject of a collaborative research project carried out at the Museum Conservation Institute, Smithsonian Institution, headed by Mary Ballard.Ballard, Alden, Cunningham, Hopwood, Koles, and Dussubieux, ‚ÄúPreliminary Analyses of Textiles Associated with the Furniture from Tumulus MM.‚Äù The menu of the funerary feast that took place before the Tumulus MM burial was determined by Dr. Patrick McGovern and his colleagues, and the mixed fermented beverage was created through the efforts of Pat McGovern and Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery.McGovern, ‚ÄúChemical Identification of the Beverage and Food Remains in Tumulus MM.‚Äù For a profile of Sam Calagione and his collaboration with McGovern, see Burkhard Bilger, ‚ÄúA Better Brew.‚Äù Research on the wooden objects from the Gordion tombs is the subject of numerous publications (see References below for a selection). Thirty years of study have yielded extensive information about the woods, tools, and techniques used by the royal cabinetmakers, who were surely among the greatest craftsmen of their time.Simpson, ‚ÄúPhrygian Furniture from Gordion,‚Äù 208-209. Simpson, ‚ÄúWoodworking Tools and Techniques.‚Äù The Phrygian artisans, while working well within ancient traditions of wood carving and joinery, were outstanding in their virtuoso use of wood inlay, their abstraction of natural forms, and their elaborate play with symmetry and design. The many fine wooden objects excavated at Gordion may serve to indicate the magnitude of our loss of most wooden artifacts from the archaeological record, and to remind us of the importance of organic materials for an appreciation of the arts of antiquity.

County of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661 (1974), is a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court concerning aboriginal title in the United States. The original suit in this matter was the first modern-day Native American land claim litigated in the federal court system rather than before the Indian Claims Commission. It was also the first to go to final judgement.Vecsey & Starna, 1988, at 148. The Supreme Court held that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for possessory land claims brought by Indian tribes based upon aboriginal title, the Nonintercourse Act, and Indian treaties. In delivering the opinion of the Court, Associate Justice Byron White wrote that jurisdiction for such suits arose both from 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1331, conferring jurisdiction for cases arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States and 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1362, conferring similar jurisdiction to cases brought by Indian tribes regardless of the amount in controversy. The case is often referred to as Oneida I because it is the first of three times the Oneida Indian Nation reached the Supreme Court in litigating its land rights claims. It was followed by County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State (Oneida II) (1985), rejecting all of the affirmative defenses raised by the counties in the same action, and City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (Sherrill) (2005), rejecting the tribe's attempt in a later lawsuit to reassert tribal sovereignty over parcels of land reacquired by the tribe in fee simple. Background=District Court In 1970, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York State and Oneida Indian Nation of Wisconsin filed suit against Oneida County, New York and Madison County, New York in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The Oneidas alleged that vast swathes of tribal lands had been conveyed to the state of New York in violation of the Nonintercourse Act and three Indian treaties: the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784), the Treaty of Fort Harmar (1789), and the Treaty of Canandaigua (1794). Although the complaint named over conveyed in such manner, the suit involved only the portion of that land held by the two counties. As damages, the tribes asked only for the fair rental value of the lands from the period January 1, 1968 through December 31, 1969. The District Court held that the complaint asserted only state law claims, implicating federal law only indirectly, and thus granted the motion to dismiss under the well-pleaded complaint rule. Circuit Court A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal. Chief Judge Henry Friendly, for the Second Circuit, held that the assertion of jurisdiction \\"shatters on the rock of the 'well-pleaded complaint' rule.\\" The Second Circuit placed weight upon Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U.S. 74 (1914), holding that there was no federal jurisdiction for an ejectment action that alleged wrongful alienation of lands allotted to Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians. Opinion of the Court  Supreme Court Associate Justice Byron White, author of the majority opinion in Oneida I The Supreme Court reversed. Justice White noted \\"Accepting the premise of the Court of Appeals that the case was essentially a possessory action, we are of the view that the complaint asserted a current right to possession conferred by federal law, wholly independent of state law.\\"414 U.S. at 666. The Court distinguished Taylor v. Anderson on these grounds > Here, the right to possession itself is claimed to arise under federal law > in the first instance. Allegedly, aboriginal title of an Indian tribe > guaranteed by treaty and protected by statute has never been extinguished. > In Taylor, the plaintiffs were individual Indians, not an Indian tribe; and > the suit concerned lands allocated to individual Indians, not tribal rights > to lands.... > In the present case, however, the assertion of a federal controversy does > not rest solely on the claim of a right to possession derived from a federal > grant of title whose scope will be governed by state law. Rather, it rests > on the not insubstantial claim that federal law now protects, and has > continuously protected from the time of the formation of the United States, > possessory rights to tribal lands, wholly apart from the application of > state law principles which normally and separately protect a valid right of > possession.414 U.S. at 676-77. The majority emphasized the supremacy of federal Indian law to state law: > There has been recurring tension between federal and state law; state > authorities have not easily accepted the notion that federal law and federal > courts must be deemed the controlling considerations in dealing with the > Indians. Fellows v. Blacksmith, The New York Indians, United States v. > Forness, and the Tuscarora litigation are sufficient evidence that the reach > and exclusivity of federal law with respect to reservation lands and > reservation Indians did not go unchallenged; and it may be that they are to > some extent challenged here. But this only underlines the legal reality that > the controversy alleged in the complaint may well depend on what the reach > and impact of the federal law will prove to be in this case.414 U.S. 678-79. Because the District Court had disposed on the case on a motion to dismiss, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. Concurrence Justices Rehnquist and Powell concurred separately, emphasizing their understanding that the majority's holding would not apply to ejectment actions brought by non-Indians. The concurrence concluded: \\"The opinion for the Court today should give no comfort to persons with garden- variety ejectment claims who, for one reason or another, are covetously eyeing the door to the federal courthouse.\\"414 U.S. at 684.  Subsequent developments  On remand, the District Court and Second Circuit rejected the counties' affirmative defenses and awarded money damages. This time, the counties appealed to the Supreme Court, which again granted certiorari. The impact of Oneida I was summed up, in the interpretation of Allan Van Gestal, the lawyer for Oneida County, in his argument in Oneida II: > This case is a test case, having been so designated by the plaintiffs, > having been so tried by the courts below.... The 1974 opinion in this case > has already spawned a vast number of Indian land claims. A number of cases > are pending throughout the eastern states and southern states, citing the > 1974 jurisdictional opinion as if it were an opinion on the merits of the > issues.

Moore, The Neolithic of the Levant, Oxford University, 1978 The site comprises a cave and the small terrace in front of it, which steeply descends towards the wadi floor.A.M.L. Moore, The Neolithic of the Levant, Oxford University, 1978. Chapter 2 (pp. 99-106). The site was first excavated in 1941. Kebaran (Upper Paleolithic), Natufian (Epipaleolithic) and Pre- Pottery Neolithic A and B (PPNA, PPNB) industries were found. Upper PaleolithicGrain Wheat was recovered from the Nahal Oren site, but it was not certain whether it was cultivated or wild. Grain was relatively rare at the site in comparison with other food resources. The age of the emmer wheat grains found there is an indication that the cultivation of grain might have started as early as 16,000 years ago. In 1985 the three spikelets of cultivated emmer found in a Kebaran context in Wadi Oren were seen to be so early as to be considered an anomaly. Neolithic village A PPNA village of some 13 subcircular houses and other structures stood on four artificial, closely set terraces. The buildings were similar to those of PPNA Jericho. Only one human burial was discovered at the PPNA village site. There were no grave goods in the burial pit, and the skeleton was complete with the exception of the skull, which had been removed - an early example of a practice better known from the later Neolithic. The remains of the PPNB village are far more scarce, but seem to be in continuation of the PPNA phase.A.M.L. Moore, The Neolithic of the Levant, Oxford University, 1978. Chapter 4 (pp. 218-221).

File:Basalt Sharpening Stones, Natufian Culture.jpgBasalt sharpening stones, Eynan and Nahal Oren, Natufian Culture, 12500-9500 BC. Domestication of gazelles and goats During Neolithic occupation, the main source of food at the site appears to have been gazelles, and judging from the high incidence of immature gazelle bones, these animals were domesticated. The later shift to goat husbandry may have occurred because goats are less selective in their diets than gazelles, and can graze in areas where the gazelle would not fare well. Repeated occupation Nahal Oren was occupied repeatedly over thousands of years by culture after culture, which means that it was a preferred site for occupation, rather than an occasional one.

It is long with a double set of Queen post trusses on each side. It was built in 1835 as a toll bridge and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Major renovations were completed in 1926 by the Bower Bridge Company and in 1966 by the Kentucky Highway Department. It was raised to the current height by 15-year-old Stock Bower in 1920. The latest renovation took place in 2001. Iron support beams were added to the bridge during the course of these renovations. Many reasons have been offered to explain the construction of covered bridges in Kentucky during the 19th century. Roads across the bridges were kept dry and free of snow in winter. The protection the cover provided against wood deterioration was likely most important. The cover allowed timbered trusses and braces to season properly and kept water out of the joints, prolonging the life by seven to eight times that of an uncovered bridge. The bridge was bypassed in 2005, but remains open to local traffic.

Since 1994, he has played bass in a number of well-known punk/post-hardcore bands including Near Miss and Staring Back.[ Near Miss] at Allmusic Early life Portman was born on October 26, 1979. His younger years were spent living in Madison, WI before moving with his family to Perry, GA upon entering fourth grade. At the age of twelve, Josh received his first guitar and has been writing, recording, and performing ever since. Initially influenced by the glam and thrash metal bands of the '80s, Portman later immersed himself in the post-hardcore and Seattle bands of the early '90s and then the \\"new school\\" punk bands of the mid-'90s. He has been a part of many bands that have explored all of these genres. Music career=Early bands (1994-2005) Portman's first band, Zero Racecar, was formed in 1994 in Perry, GA. He joined the band two years later at the age of fifteen and immediately began playing shows throughout Georgia, as well as Florida and the Carolinas. After graduating in 1998, he formed another band in Atlanta called Lancaster with ex-Tsunami Bomb guitarist/current Nothington vocalist Jay Northington. The post-hardcore outfit disbanded after just a year together. Staring Back (2005) In 2005, Portman joined Santa Barbara- based punk band Staring Back. However, the Lobster Records group split up several months later when their lead guitarist/key songwriter Ryan Mendez joined Yellowcard. Near Miss (2006-2007) In 2006, the post-hardcore band Near Miss asked Josh to join. He relocated to their home of Austin, TX and toured extensively with the band all over the U.S., including a spot on the Vans Warped Tour that same year. Near Miss officially broke up in 2007. Great White Lion Snake (2008) After Yellowcard went on \\"indefinite hiatus\\" in 2008, Josh Portman left his residence in Atlanta to finish his degree in business at Macon State College. Wanting to still continue pursuing music and performing, he put together an '80s hair metal tribute band called Great White Lion Snake at the end of 2008. Portman's stage name for GWLS is Jef Leppard. They can be seen performing all over Georgia. Big If (2009) On September 14, 2009, Ryan Key and Sean O'Donnell made a MySpace blog post that Portman will be playing lead guitar in their side-project, Big If. The side project was discontinued when Key reformed Yellowcard in 2010 with O'Donnell joining. Yellowcard (2007, 2012-2017) Josh Portman Tempe Arizona After Near Miss broke up, Portman was asked to fill the position of bassist for Yellowcard when Pete Mosely and the band parted ways mid-way through the first U.S. tour for \\"Paper Walls.\\" He finished out the tour with Blue October and Shiny Toy Guns, performed on the iTunes only Yellowcard release, \\"Live from Las Vegas at The Palms\\", and continued with the band for a 15-day tour in Japan with Linkin Park. The band's next tour was an acoustic venture. After the acoustic tour, they went on \\"indefinite hiatus\\". Sean O' Donnell of Reeve Oliver became the bassist when Yellowcard reunited in 2010.

From 1932 to 1939 he was in Berlin, where Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler became an active proponent of his work. He returned to Vienna in 1939 and remained there for the rest of his life, with extended stays in Germany and the United States. In later years, although he continued to compose and publish new works, his music was less frequently performed, and he largely withdrew from public musical life. Most of Berger's published music is orchestral. His distinct musical language is characterized by shifting tonalities, complex rhythms, inventive and nuanced orchestration, and innovative structural principles.

On 4 April 1979, the former President and Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was hanged to death in this jail. In 1986, a new Jail was constructed on Adiala Road nearly 13 kilometres away from the District Courts which was named Central Jail Rawalpindi. The old jail was demolished in 1988 on the orders of military dictator Gen. Zia-ul-Haq and the grounds converted into Jinnah Park. Some, especially activists of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party believe that the District Jail Rawalpindi was demolished to destroy tangible reminders of Bhutto i.e. his death cell, execution gallows etc which the Party and his children could use to gain sympathies of the world at large and to launch effective political campaign against Zia-ul-Haq.\\"Pindi Jail Not Too Old to Be Demolished\\" Sadiq Jafri.

She is known for founding the Academie voor Muziek, Theater & Dans in Maasmechelen in 1945 and for several prize-winning compositions.  Biography  Jos√©e Vigneron-Ramackers was born on 25 January 1914, in Leopoldsburg, Limbourg in Belgium. Her father was director of the boys' school of the Coal Mines in Eisden, where she lived from 1921. Her mother was the daughter of lyricist Jean-G. Close, and a soprano singing in charity concerts. She studied at the Zusters Kindsheid Jesu's (Sisters of the Childhood of Jesus) normal school in Hasselt, and at the Limburgse Orgel- en Zangschool under the tuition of Herman and Arthur Meulemans, where she learned harmony and counterpoint. She obtained her organ, piano and teaching diplomas in 1934. Vigneron-Ramackers was then appointed to the Koninkl√øk Atheneum of Eisden and the Atheneum of Maaseik, where she taught singing and drawing from 1934 to 1969. In the meantime, she pursued her studies by correspondence, learning about fugue with Herman Meulemans, and orchestration with Arthur Meulemans and Paul Gilson. In 1945, she founded the free music school Tuinwijk in Eisden, which would become the Gemeentelijke Muziekacademie in 1973, when taken over by the Maasmechelen community, and served as its director until 1979. According to the Vlanderen magazine, this academy was seen as \\"the cradle of musical life in the whole Maasland region.\\" There, great importance was paid to the all-round education of musicians: compulsory Dutch and cultural history courses were introduced, as well as numerous exhibitions and drawing lessons. In 1955, she created the Jeugd en Muziek department in Eisden, and opened a free music course for youth (Jeugdmuziekschool) in her academy, in order to remedy to some extent the pedagogical shortcomings of formal music education. Vigneron-Ramackers also got involved in her father's school orchestra, turning the pre-war amateur band into a full-fledged chamber orchestra, the Kamerorkest van de Muziekacademie. She received the Koopal Prize from the Ministry of Education and Culture in 1961 for five of her compositions. On 8 February 1978, she was awarded the prize for music of the province of Limburg. On 14 March 1981, she was made Officer of the Order of Leopold II by the Governor Vandermeulen.  Musical style  Most of her music was composed with small ensembles in mind. She was at first influenced by the impressionist current, then her work turned out to be more in the neo-classical vein.

Stephen Peace and John DeBello, and directed by John DeBello based upon an original idea by Costa Dillon. The screenplay was written by Dillon, Peace, and DeBello. The film is a spoof of B movies. Made on a budget less than US$ 100,000 the story involves tomatoes becoming sentient by unknown means and revolting against humanity. The box office success of the film led to three sequels, all co-written by the same three writers and directed by DeBello. Plot The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance with which she is covered is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occurs (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that no credible threat exists, the President puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes, led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Adolf Hitler; scuba diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter. Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hotdog and asking if anyone could \\"pass the ketchup.\\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the President sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency Mind Makers, where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys, including a bumper sticker with \\"STP\\" for \\"Stop Tomato Program\\" on it, a satirical reference to both the real \\"whip inflation now\\" campaign with its widely ridiculed \\"WIN\\" slogan and STP motor oil decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s. A human is revealed to be also plotting to stop Dixon when a masked assassin attempts to shoot him, but misses. A senate subcommittee meeting is held where one secret pamphlet is leaked to a newspaper editor, who sends Lois Fairchild on the story. While she tails Finletter, he mistakes her for a spy and trashes a hotel room attempting to kill her. He then chases the assassin as the masked man fails again to kill Dixon, but loses him. Gretta is killed and further regression has led leaders to bring in tanks and soldiers to the West Coast in a battle that leaves the American forces in shambles. Dixon, walking among the rubble, sees a trail of tomato juice and decides to investigate. He ends up being chased by a killer tomato to an apartment where an oblivious child is listening to the radio. The tomato is about to kill Dixon, but suddenly flies out the window. Dixon peers out to see if it has died, and he spots the assassin hijacking his car. He chases the assassin in a \\"slow car chase\\" that has since been copied by other comedies. Dixon is eventually knocked out by his own car. Awakening, Dixon finds himself captured by Richardson. Though he did not create the killer tomatoes, he has discovered how to control them and plans to do so once civilization has collapsed - leaving him in control. He is about to reveal his secret of control to Dixon when Finletter charges in and runs him through with his sword. Dixon, picking up some strewn records, realizes that he has seen the tomatoes retreat at the sound of the song \\"Puberty Love\\", but had not put two and two together until now. He orders Finletter to gather all remaining people and bring them to the stadium. Finletter remarks that \\"only crazy people\\" are left in the nearly deserted city, resulting in a motley assortment of people in costumes facing the attacking tomatoes at the stadium. The tomatoes are cornered in a stadium. \\"Puberty Love\\" is played over the loudspeaker, causing the tomatoes to shrink and allowing the various people at the stadium to squash them by stomping on them repeatedly. Fairchild, meanwhile, is cornered by a giant tomato wearing earmuffs, hence cannot hear the music. Dixon saves her by showing the tomato the sheet music to \\"Puberty Love\\". He professes his love to her, in song. The film ends with a carrot that rises from the soil and says, \\"All right, you guys. They're gone now.\\" Cast *David Miller as Mason Dixon *George Wilson as Jim Richardson *Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild *Stephen Peace as Wilbur Finletter *Ernie Meyers as the President *Eric Christmas as Senator Polk *Ron Shapiro as Newspaper editor *Al Sklar as Ted Swan *Jerry Anderson as Major Mills *Jack Riley as Von Schauer *Gary Smith as Sam Smith *John Qualls as Captain *Geoff Ramsey as the Stapler *Ryan Shields as Tomato *Benita Barton as Gretta Attenbaum *Don Birch as the Old Man *Tom Coleman as the Singing Soldier *Art K.

Production The finished film contains footage of a real helicopter crash. In a scene showing law enforcement officers firing their weapons to ward off tomatoes in a field, a $60,000 Hiller Aircraft UH-12E that had been rented for the production was supposed to have landed in the tomato patch behind the officers, but during the landing, its tail rotor struck the ground, causing the craft to spin out of control near the ground, roll over, and burst into flames. The helicopter pilot escaped without serious injury. The crash was caught on film as the cameras were rolling at the time. The crash was later worked into the film. Music The theme song, written by DeBello, describes the tomatoes' rampages through the world, describing that they have killed a man named Herman Farbage while he was taking out the garbage, that the mayor is on vacation to get out of stopping them, that they have scared off the National Guard, and that they have even eaten the narrator's sister. This theme song is used in different variations over the course of the series, here simply sounding like the score of an old monster movie with lyrics and a more catchy tune. All other music was written by Gordon Goodwin and Paul Sundfor with lyrics by Dillon, DeBello, and Peace. The song \\"Puberty Love\\" was sung by the then-teenaged Matt Cameron, who later became the drummer for Soundgarden and since 1998 has been the drummer for Pearl Jam. Critical reception Upon release, Variety wrote that the film \\"isn't even worthy of sarcasm.\\" Emanuel Levy gave the film a score of 2 out of 5. Time Out called the film a \\"one-joke spoof\\". Eric Henderson, reviewing the DVD edition for Slant Magazine in 2003 opined that \\"even more so than the Samuel Arkoff-like opportunism of the producers, and more so than some of the worst framing this side of Coleman Francis, the really frustrating thing about Tomatoes is the toothlessness of its satire. And that‚Äôs a major missed opportunity, considering that the irony of using a stereotypically foreign genre (Japanese monster movies) against a parody of America‚Äôs jingoistic reliance on military power (the Army is useless against the giant tomatoes) should‚Äôve been a comedic gold mine.\\" Rue Morgue writer Michael Gingold later wrote, in review of the Blu-ray edition in 2018, wrote that \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes may be one of history‚Äôs most misunderstood films. It has often been celebrated as a prime example of ‚Äúso bad it‚Äôs funny‚Äù cinema, when in fact it‚Äôs an attempt at intentional comedy that is, at best, a scattershot success.\\" Legacy Attack of the Killer Tomatoes has become a cult film. A number of sequels and other spin-off material have been done in various media as a result of this movie. They include three movie sequels: * Return of the Killer Tomatoes! (1988) * Killer Tomatoes Strike Back! (1990) * Killer Tomatoes Eat France! (1991) The sequel Return of the Killer Tomatoes picks up the story 10 years later. The film is notable for the casting of George Clooney in one of his first film roles. American composer and orchestrator Gordon Goodwin, one of the original composers for the film, later wrote an Emmy-nominated, big-band piece inspired by the music for this film, to be played with his jazz ensemble Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band. Adaptations, parodies, and spin-offs * The film was adapted in 1990 as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, a cartoon TV series which ran on Fox Kids, but despite the name, it was based on Return of the Killer Tomatoes. * A novel released in 1997, Attack of the Killer Potatoes, pays tribute to the film. * Different video games were developed: a 1986 video game released for 8-bit computers, which was based on the film, and a 1991 video game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy game consoles, which was based on the animated series. * Viper Comics released a comic book adaptation of the film in October 2008.Viper Comics Launches All Horror Imprint \\"Black Mamba Books\\", Comics Bulletin, June 9, 2008 * Kim Harrison's book series The Hollows is based in a world where genetically engineered tomatoes killed off a significant portion of the human population. The author admitted inspiration came from this movie. * A Greek film has also been made as an homage, I epithesi tou gigantiaiou mousaka (The Attack of the Giant Moussaka) (1999). Cancelled remake In 2008, a remake was announced. Kent Nichols and Douglas Sarine, creators of Ask a Ninja, were developing the project. This was to be Nichols' directorial debut. M. Dal Walton III was co-producing along with Emmett/Furla Films. In 2011, John DeBello said that the Ask a Ninja creators were no longer involved. Reboot In July 2018, Steve Peace and Costa Dillon announced a reboot at the San Diego Comic-Con. Filming began in July 2019, directed by Dustin Ferguson.

Football career Davies was born in Talgarth, Breconshire and started his football career with the local village side before moving to the larger towns of Builth Wells and Brecon where he earned a reputation as a \\"star forward\\", being described in one report as \\"a very reliable forward, quick in his movements, accurate in his passes and deadly at goal\\". His form for Brecon earned him his first cap for Wales in a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Ireland at Grosvenor Park, Belfast on 4 March 1899. In the summer of 1899, he was offered professional terms by both the clubs then operating in Hereford, just across the border in England. He rejected the offer from Hereford Thistle (who were to fold later that summer) and signed with Hereford Town, then playing in the Birmingham & District League. Davies injured his knee in his first league match for Hereford, against Shrewsbury, which was to eventually end his career. He made his second international appearance on 24 February 1900 when the Welsh defeated the Irish 2‚Äì0 at The Oval, Llandudno. Despite several comeback attempts, the knee injury forced Davies to retire in October 1900. In 1908, he had recovered sufficiently to enable him to turn out occasionally for his village team.

Service history=Early service and the Far East She commenced service with the East Indies Station in 1874 in the suppression of the slave trade off the East African coast. She paid off in 1878 for conversion to a survey vessel and in 1880 commenced hydrographic surveys in the East Indies. In December 1880 she arrived in Hong Kong to commence surveying duties in East Asia (on the China Station) under the command of Richard F Hoskyn.North China Herald, December 16, 1880, p555. The NCH gave Hoskyn's rank as commander, however, the Navy List for 1881 lists him as a lieutenant. In November 1881, a party of sailors from the ship formed an honour guard for George French, Chief Justice of the British Supreme Court for China and Japan who had died in Kobe.North China Herald, November 29, 1881, p567 Involvement in the Imo incident In July 1882, Flying Fish was involved in the rescue of the Japanese legation which had escaped from Seoul after an armed uprising by mutinous Korean troops there. Flying Fish transported the surviving members of the legation back to Japan. On 17 November, for his part in rescuing the survivors, the Emperor of Japan presented the captain with a pair of bronze vases and some books - including one on the ancient conquest of Korea. It is commonly said (but not proven) that the British sailors on this mission played the first game of football in Korean history and thereby introduced the game to Korea.

She left the Australia Station later in 1886 and returned to England where she paid off. She was sold in 1888. Flying Fish Cove on Christmas Island is named after her. During the visit to this island collections of animal specimens were made by the crew.

A webcron solution enables users to schedule jobs to run within the web server environment on a web host that does not offer a shell account or other means of scheduling jobs.WebCron product documentation, retrieved December 1, 2010  Overview  Many web hosts offer shell accounts or some sort of built-in job scheduler such as cron that makes it easy for users to schedule jobs. Such hosts run jobs as command-line applications that may optionally communicate with the web server. A webcron solution, however, runs entirely within the purview of the web server environment of a web host. This allows a webcron solution to operate on hosts that do not offer a job scheduler such as cron or a shell account. A webcron solution will also run equally well on hosts that do offer users such capabilities but is designed as a substitution or replacement.phpJobScheduler overview documentation, retrieved October 14, 2010 A webcron solution is made up of two pieces. The first piece is a script that will execute the tasks that resides somewhere accessible via a URL. The second piece is to use a scheduling provider that contacts the URL of the script at regular intervals. Before setting up a schedule with a scheduling provider, a user must set up a script that runs on the web server. Most web hosts have restrictions on the length of time a single instance of a script may execute. Many web hosts also have limitations on CPU and RAM resource usage. Users of webcron solutions on shared hosting providers must be careful to not repeatedly exceed their web host's limitations so as to not get kicked off. A script that runs a long time must take into account that it may be terminated at any point by a web server process. Users may implement a state machine, which allows the script to operate across multiple invocations and run within the limitations imposed by a web host.  Scheduling Providers = Third- Party  There are many third-party webcron scheduling providers on the web.SetCron is a task scheduler service/ webcron that allows you to schedule cronjobs.Webcron services These services accept a URL and a frequency schedule to retrieve, or ping, the specified URL. Most providers have restrictions built into their system to avoid overloading their servers and to encourage users to sign up for premium accounts.EasyCron plans Users who set up premium accounts on third-party webcron scheduling providers typically gain additional benefits such as SMS and email notifications, uptime reports and logging, increased timeout limits, schedules won't expire, being able to use HTTP POST method, HTTP cookie support, or fewer restrictions on scheduling frequency.SetCronJob premium pricing page, retrieved October 14, 2010 Some webcron service providers accept CRON expression in web interface to schedule the job executing time.EasyCron accepts cron expressionWhat are the crontab features of SetCron?  Visitor Based  A webcron solution can be contained entirely on a web host by letting visitors trigger a webcron scheduler script on the server. For instance, this can be accomplished by using an 'img' HTML element in the header or footer of the website, an Ajax call in a script or an iFrame. When a visitor views the website, the image loads, which triggers the webcron scheduler. The webcron scheduler runs any tasks that need to run and then outputs an image so the visitor's web browser does not display a broken image on the page. It may alternatively start the task asynchronously such that the HTTP response is not delayed. If there are insufficient visitors to a website using visitor based webcron scheduling, then scheduled tasks will not run on time. Since visitor based webcron scheduling enables the possibility of self-contained webcron solutions, it increases the portability of a website or web-based software product. Some web-based open-source software that have tasks that need to run regularly use a visitor based webcron solution to execute those tasks.  Remote Access  A remote access capable webcron solution is typically bundled with a pair of client and server components. The client runs on a separate computer, such as the user's personal computer. A job schedule is set up on the computer where the client component resides. Then, when the job runs, the client component communicates with the server component. Remote access usually offers capabilities that are impossible with other scheduling providers. The data between the client and server components is typically encrypted even across HTTP. This allows a plugin or module for the client component to talk to the server component to securely request information that is normally restricted. Compression of the data sent and received helps reduce overall bandwidth used.WebCron Site Backup module documentation, retrieved December 1, 2010 A typical implementation of a remote access plugin or module is to incrementally back up files and databases from the web server to the client. Some incremental backup implementations may even offer basic host-based intrusion detection system functionality.  Local Access  A webcron solution can be used on hosts that already have cron available. This is useful when required functionality is only available via the web server. The cron daemon is the scheduling provider and periodically contacts the script using another tool such as Wget. In the case of a remote access capable webcron solution, cron can run the client component to execute the script.  Security Concerns  Since webcron solutions involve availability via a URL, there are several different security concerns that users should address. A webcron solution introduces issues of trust, opportunities for denial-of-service attacks, network or packet sniffing, executing a replay attack, and possible exposure of information. A webcron solution is an ideal entry point for criminal computer hackers. When using a third-party scheduling provider, users trust the third-party to not misuse the URL in any way. Users also have to assume that the connection between the third-party server and the web server is secure from hackers. When using a visitor based scheduling provider, users may inadvertently provide a possible venue for denial-of-service attacks. Also, if a script is written improperly, the script may unintentionally expose information about the server. When using a remote access scheduling provider, users usually have refined control over how communication takes place with the web server. If HTTP is used, the URL is sent in the clear over the wire but the data in the request is typically encrypted. This opens up the possibility of denial-of-service attacks and replay attacks.

The building consists of a ten-story reinforced concrete and terra cotta tower set back from 3rd Avenue but flush with Pine Street, on top of a three-story (originally two- story) base that fills the lot. A large part of the facade consists of large windows bringing natural light into almost every interior space. It was reported at the time of construction that the shopping tower had more glass in proportion to its size than any other building in Seattle.\\"Workers Feel Work Stands Out as Testimonial\\" Seattle Times 24 Oct. 1929. Pg. 11. The building's original purpose was to house retail tenants, one per floor with a tea room on the tenth floor. The building was an early incarnation of the indoor shopping center and the only of its kind in the Pacific Northwest. Also in the original plans, grass was to be planted on the roof of the second floor for a putting green owned by a sporting goods store on the third floor (the base of the tower). By the end of 1932, the retail concept proved to be a failure and the building was converted into offices for the Northwestern Mutual Insurance Company. It later housed the headquarters for the Olympic Savings Bank, after whose closure in 1994 was sold to private investors and converted into office space. The building became a City of Seattle Landmark on May 18, 1987.Landmarks Alphabetical Listing for O, Individual Landmarks, Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle. Accessed 11 October 2010. History=Plans announced In late 1928, the corner of Third Avenue and Pine street in Seattle's burgeoning midtown retail district, then occupied by the aging Melrose Hotel, was purchased from the Gottstein Estate by United Shopping Tower Inc., a company created by the United Pacific Corporation specifically to own the property which was in turn a subsidiary of Drumheller, Ehrlichman & White investment bankers.\\"Pine Street Corner Grows Apace\\" Seattle Times 11 Nov. 1928. Pg. 32. In September 1928, an announcement was made by United Pacific for plans of a $700,000 retail tower on the prominent site that would rise ten, later revised to twelve, stories. Each floor of the building would have one single specialty retail tenant with a tea room at the top. Henry Broderick, Inc. would manage the property. Construction begins Demolition of the old Melrose Hotel began on December 3, 1928. The building, originally a Victorian apartment house at the site of the post office, was moved to the site in 7 pieces in 1901 to make way for its construction where it gained a brick ground floor and became the Federal Hotel. It was later clad completely in brick.\\"Building Will Fall for Shopping Tower\\" Seattle Times 02 Dec. 1928. Pg. 32. Close-up of elaborate terracotta at the tower's 12th floor As the site was cleared, architect Bittman awarded the construction contract to Hendrickson & Alstrom, general contractors. The University Brick & Tile Company once located on E. 40th street in the University District was responsible for much of the building's exterior terracotta. Construction began in January 1929 and was mostly completed by late August. Among the first tenants to sign on for the unique new building was the Shopping Tower Bargain Basement, a newly formed discount department store that would occupy the entire basement. Puget Sound Power and Light Company and Western Union also signed leases for space. Most of the twelfth floor was leased to Gene Hanner for a photography studio.\\"New Store Planned for Shopping Tower\\" Seattle Times 28 Jul. 1929. Pg. 28. A superficial 13th floor located below the roof was used for storage. Building opens to public The grand opening of the Bargain Basement on October 26, 1929, also marked the unofficial opening of the Shopping tower, though still not fully completed. The building soon had more tenants and officially opened to the public on November 2, 1929. The lobby of the building, on Pine Street, was decorated with marble and mahogany trimming and featured display cases for the various retail tenants to display their wares. Two high-speed, micro-leveling, signal controlling Otis elevators that served the building were also decorated with marble and bronze. A unique feature of the building at the time was the inclusion of a rooftop garden: Later in 1929, radio station KPBC, the predecessor to KIRO, opened a new studio in the building.\\"Radio\\" Seattle Times 08 Nov. 1929.

Northwestern Mutual Insurance Building While a novel concept at first, the Great Depression soon revealed that the vertical shopping concept was not good for businesses trying to make themselves as visible as possible to what few people were still spending money. In December 1932, the Northwestern Mutual Fire Association, the nation's biggest fire insurance company at the time, signed a ten-year lease with the Gottstein Estate for the majority of the vacated space in the building and renamed it the Northwestern Mutual Insurance Building. In February 1933, following $40,000 in renovations including remodeling the lobby and the addition of a new scientific sprinkler system, the company moved their offices from the Central Building in the financial district to the former shopping tower where they would occupy the basement, 2nd, 3rd, 10th, 11th and 12th floors.

The lobby was also made smaller by additional retail space. Olympic Tower and later years In 1974, Northwestern Mutual became the Unigard Insurance Group and moved most of their offices to the recently completed Financial Center at Fourth and Seneca Streets but retained a small office in the building until 1976. Following Unigard's departure, the building was briefly retitled the \\"Insurance Building\\" in hopes of attracting other insurance firms but after a brief vacancy in the late 1970s, the building was purchased by Securities Financial, Inc. in 1979. That company was a subsidiary of Olympic Savings & Loan Association, a bank started in Bremerton, Washington in 1964. Olympic carried out an extensive renovation of the interior and exterior of the building. Intrusive additions to the storefronts were removed and the facade was cleaned. Other improvements included updated mechanical systems and the removal of an unused freight elevator. Following the restoration, Securities Financial nominated the building for the National Register of Historic Places, to which it was accepted the following year. In early 1980, the building became the headquarters for Olympic Savings and was officially retitled the Olympic Tower and included a branch bank on the ground floor. Following Olympic Saving's demise in 1993, the tower was purchased by the Singaporean investment corporation, Duchess Properties Ltd., led by Liu Shek Yuen.Godden, Jean \\"Today, It's New York; Next, It's . . .\\" Seattle Times 23 May 1994.

The Taula del S√©nia () or Mancomunitat de la Taula del S√©nia is a commonwealth or free association of municipalities made up of 22 towns, totalling up to 100,000 people, of some of the comarcas that make up the center of the historical region of Ilercavonia (present day southern Aragon and Catalonia, and northern Valencia), Spain. The origin of the name lies in the fact that all municipal terms involved are located within 15 km of the S√©nia River, perceived as the centre of the region in its upper course. Goals The Taula del S√©nia's main purpose is to alleviate the historical neglect of this greater comarca by managing its public municipal resources meaningfully. The organization of the municipalities in a mancomunidad may allow the region to achieve the necessary legal recognition for its administrative development. The main emphasis of the mancomunidad is the promotion of reindustrialization, as much industry fled the area during the last half of the 20th century and the current crisis has forced many key factories to close their doors. The Taula del S√©nia focuses also on sustainable development by presenting the region as a meeting point of three Spanish Autonomous Communities, instead of the gathering of three fringe territories of Aragon, Catalonia and the Valencian Community. The reversal of the latter perception is crucial to the Taula del S√©nia's efforts, for they blame their present status of disinvestment, unemployment and general economic neglect to being far away from the centres of power and decision of each of the three Autonomous Communities in question.

Personal life  Mangkunegara was given the nickname Soul Reaping Prince by Nicolaas Hartingh, because the Prince had brought his enemies to death during the war. Hatingh was Dutch East India Company's Governor of the Northeast Coast of Java, located in Batavia. He was born on 7 April 1726 in Kartasura. Mangkunegara was brought up by his mother, Raden Ayu Wulan and his father, Prince Mangkunegara Kartasura. His maternal grandfather was Prince Sambernyawa Balitar and his paternal grandfather was Amangkurat, King of Mataram. Duke of Mangkunegara Kartasura During the reign of the fourth Amangkurat, the Kingdom of Mataram in Java was not free from the turmoil of civil war. Prince Mangkunegara replaced Pakubuwono I as King of Mataram, when the King had to face the uprising carried out by his two brothers, the Prince and Prince Purbaya Blitar. During this conflict, the Dutch gave full support to Prince Mangkunegara so that the two brothers could no longer carry out their rebellion. The presence of Prince Mangkunegara instead of Pakubuwono had been prepared long before the death of the King. In March 1715, Mangkunegara Prince Arya (son of Pakubuwono I) was officially announced as the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Mataram. In the same year, the appointment of Crown Prince was accompanied by the cannon shots of Gunturgeni, along with the ritual of cutting of the hair of the Crown King. Mangkunegara became the fourth Amangkurat to rule Mataram. The title Mangkunegara was later inherited by the eldest son, R.M. Suro who was then titled Prince Arya Mangkunegara Kartasura. To quarantine the rivals, the King intended to marry his son to Prince Purbaya. The will of the King did not prevail due to resistance by Queen Amangkurat (his wife). His marriage was on condition of divorce from children Prince Prince Mangkunegara Blitar. Amangkurat's story continues with the death due to poisoning and possible successor positions shifted to the younger brother of King RM Prabasuyasa.

Kerr, who lived in East Lothian, was the principal owner of Dick, Kerr, and Company Ltd, which carried out large contracts for the construction of tram and cable lines in London, Edinburgh and other cities. He unsuccessfully contested the 1900 general election in his home area of Haddingtonshire. In April 1903 Robert William Hanbury, the Conservative MP for Preston, died aged 58. In the preceding years, Kerr's company had opened extensive tram and electrical equipment factories in Preston, employing nearly 2,000 people, and he was selected as the Conservative candidate for the resulting by-election in May 1903. The Times newspaper reported that he described himself as a firm supporter of the government and as \\"a thorough Imperialist, believing the maintenance of the Empire as a whole to be essential to the prosperity, if not continued existence, of Britain as an independent Power\\". The Liberal Party backed the Labour candidate, trade unionist John Hodge, who had the support of the local temperance movement and reported the defection of many local working-class Conservatives to the Labour cause. However, Kerr won the seat with a majority of 14% of the votes over Hodge, his sole opponent.Craig, page 173 Kerr held the Preston seat until his defeat at the 1906 general election, after which he did not stand for Parliament again.

Such devices can be classified into two types: impulse voltage generators and impulse current generators. High impulse voltages are used to test the strength of electric power equipment against lightning and switching surges. Also, steep-front impulse voltages are sometimes used in nuclear physics experiments. High impulse currents are needed not only for tests on equipment such as lightning arresters and fuses but also for many other technical applications such as lasers, thermonuclear fusion, and plasma devices.  Jedlik's tubular voltage generator  In 1863 Hungarian physicist √Ånyos Jedlik discovered the possibility of voltage multiplication and in 1868 demonstrated it with a \\"tubular voltage generator\\", which was successfully displayed at the Vienna World Exposition in 1873. It was an early form of the impulse generators now applied in nuclear research. The jury of the World Exhibition of 1873 in Vienna awarded his voltage multiplying condenser of cascade connection with prize \\"For Development\\". Through this condenser, Jedlik framed the principle of surge generator of cascaded connection. (The Cascade connection was another important invention of √Ånyos Jedlik.)  Marx generator  One form is the Marx generator, named after Erwin Otto Marx, who first proposed it in 1923. This consists of multiple capacitors that are first charged in parallel through charging resistors as by a high-voltage, direct- current source and then connected in series and discharged through a test object by a simultaneous spark-over of the spark gaps. The impulse current generator comprises many capacitors that are also charged in parallel by a high-voltage, low-current, direct-current source, but it is discharged in parallel through resistances, inductances, and a test object by a spark gap.

Dungog Film Festival was a not for profit arts organisation that was dedicated to celebrating and promoting Australian screen industry. The festival was committed to education and nurturing the health of the Australian film and TV industry through a range of dynamic initiatives. Some proceeds of the festival have gone towards preserving the James Theatre. The festival aimed to support the Australian Film and TV Industry in a non-competitive environment that exclusively showcased Australian screen content. Dungog Film Festival showcased feature films, short films, television, documentaries, Australian classics and music videos. The festival also ran an extensive education program, including workshops, seminars, master classes with prominent directors, and the In The Raw script readings for television series, miniseries and feature films scripts. It was considered the biggest festival of Australian cinema in the world, as well as the largest short film festival in Australia. Screenings took place in local venues including the iconic James Theatre and the RSL auditorium. The 2010 festival attracted over 9,000 people and national media coverage including Sunrise, NBN News and Network Ten. The Dungog Film Festival has been replaced by the Dungog Festival, an annual event that includes a major film component which in 2016 included a short film competition with $30,000 in cash prizes, an out-of-competition showcase programme of documentaries and feature films and a series of filmmaker workshops and panels with a range of screen industry guest speakers.  History = Inception  The festival was established in 2007 by film- makers Allanah Zitserman (Festival Director) and Stavros Kazantzidis (Managing Director). Their aim was to foster a greater appreciation for Australian films among Australian audiences, strengthen bonds within the Australian film and television communities, and present a cultural experience in a distinctly Australian rural setting. The last film festival was held in 2012. A new event, the Dungog Festival, with a focus on film, food and fresh air, was established in 2014 and is held annually, run by the Dungog Arts Foundation. Over the years, film luminaries, emerging talent, actors, film buffs, students, industry executives, journalists and switched-on audiences have flocked to Dungog in increasing numbers. Film industry professionals have enjoyed the Festival because it offers a truly world-class festival experience with a laid-back vibe and intimate atmosphere, which promotes camaraderie away from the bustle of the city. Attendees love the Festival as it provides the opportunity to immerse in a cultural experience with the rare chance to meet and engage with filmmakers and celebrities.  Dungog  Dungog is located north of Sydney, north of Newcastle and north of Maitland in the Hunter Region of New South Wales. It is historically known for its timber, cattle and dairy produce and is also home to the James Theatre, the oldest still operating purpose-built cinema in Australia. Prior to white settlement the area was populated by the Gringai tribe, who called the region \\"Tunkok\\" or \\"Tungog\\", or \\"the place of thinly wooded hills\\" in the Awabakal dialect. The area is also renowned for its magnificent cedar trees, which were used in the construction of the Sydney Opera House. Every year Dungog transforms during the film festival into a hub of film-makers and tourists.  James Theatre  The James Theatre is the oldest operating purpose-built cinema in Australia. Opened in 1913, the site was originally used as an open-air theatre. Under the control of James Stuart (hence the James Theatre) by 1914 it had been roofed and in 1930 it underwent extensive reconstruction, equipping it for talkies. It is believed that the Spanish-style fa√ßade, which gives the theatre its flair, was also added in the 1930s. In the 1980s the Dungog Shire Council acquired the building as a community centre and the cinema operation continued under the expert care of Ken Reeve, a regional cinema hero, until his retirement in 2007. The cinema is currently operated by the Hopson family. Raising awareness for Australian films Media coverage of the festival generates important public relations for Australian films. Dungog Film Festival acts as a platform for these films to gain much-needed exposure in the market. Road Train (Xavier Samuel, Sophie Lowe, Bob Morley, Georgina Haig) screened at the 2010 Festival and was initially unable to obtain a theatrical release. However, due to the media coverage the festival was able to generate for the film, a distribution deal and funding were secured. In 2009 the Dungog campaign for Unfinished Sky kicked off its national release. The film went on to earn the second highest box office result for an Australian film that year. The Jammed, initially heading straight to DVD, was picked up for a theatrical release at 2007 festival by John L. Simpson Producer and CEO of Titan View. It went on to be a box office hit and won the IF Best Film and Screenplay Awards that year.  Education programs  The Dungog Film Festival's education programs include the Student Program, In The Raw - live script reads, Master Classes, Workshops, Seminars and Meet the Filmmaker sessions (in collaboration with iTunes). Other programs are Speed Auditioning, Rural Schools Program and the Dungog Collection on iTunes. Dungog Film Festival's Rural School's program gives students in regional communities the opportunity to be mentored by industry professionals in screen arts. DFF has also run workshops on film editing, visual effects and postproduction run by volunteers from the University of Newcastle. In 2010, Dungog Film Festival also partnered with Jennifer's Words and managed a mentoring program where students from Dungog High School scripted, filmed and edited an advertisement, which was screened at the closing night of the Festival. In the Raw The festival's In the Raw script development program presents live script readings of some of Australia's most exciting new screenplays, read by professional actors. It offers a unique opportunity for audiences to witness first-hand the development of some of the most promising yet-to-be produced screenplays, as well as the chance to actively take part in a discussion regarding their development. This program allows writers, actors and producers to road test their work on a real audience before heading into production. Two screenplays previously read at \\"In the Raw\\" have gone into production: Pauline Chan's Mei Mei (starring Claudia Karvan and Guy Pearce) and Julia Leigh's Sleeping Beauty (starring Emily Browning, Michael Dorman and Ewen Leslie). Speed auditioning In its inaugural year, 2010, \\"Speed Auditioning\\" had an overwhelming response from young actors around Australia. This program offers budding talent the chance to get their name up in lights, in a \\"so you think you can act\\" competition. Actors brave a two-minute, open, speedy audition, with only ten finalists invited to the festival to compete in the final round. At the festival, the finalists chose a genre and were given a scene to read to camera. They also performed the scene live for the judges. These included Jeremy Hartley Sims, Nadia Tass, Brendan Cowell, Rowan Woods, Denise Roberts, Cameron Daddo and CEO of Paramount Mike Selwyn. This program gives young actors an unparalleled chance to shine in front of the Australian film industry and a wide audience.  Community involvement  Each year young people from the local community join up with the festival's volunteer program. During the 2010 festival over 150 community members aged from 16 to 75 participated in the program. Local businesses along the main street, Dowling Street, become involved in the festival's annual window competition. Retail businesses along the main street dresses their shop-front window to reflect an Australian film. Prizes are awarded to the most creative design. As well as working with students from the local high school on film-making workshops, Dungog Film Festival provides assistance to the Council run visitor information centre in order to deal with the increase of visitors during the festival.  Growth of the festival  The 2010 Festival saw over 9,000 people attend over four days, an increase on the 2009 attendance figure of 6,500. The number of films screened during the festival increased from 57 films in 2007 to 164 films in 2010. The number of venues utilised by the Dungog Film Festival has also increased, and the reach of the Festival has broadened through partnerships with iTunes, AFTRS, NIDA, and Newcastle University.

Tingatinga is one of the most widely represented forms of tourist-oriented paintings in Tanzania, Kenya and neighboring countries. The genre is named after its founder, Tanzanian painter Edward Said Tingatinga. The Tingatinga school of painting sold their work in Oyster Bay, Dar es Salaam. Picture from 1973 Tingatinga is traditionally made on masonite, using several layers of bicycle paint, which makes for a brilliant and highly saturated colors. Many elements of the style are related to requirements of the tourist-oriented market; for example, the paintings are usually small so they can be easily transported, and subjects are intended to appeal to the Europeans and Americans (e.g., the big five and other wild fauna). In this sense, Tingatinga paintings can be considered a form of \\"airport painting\\".Exploring the Tingatinga Art Movement in Tanzania The drawings themselves can be described as both na√Øve and caricatural, and humor and sarcasm are often explicit. History Edward Tingatinga began painting around 1968 in Tanzania (Dar es Salaam). He employed low cost materials such as masonite and bicycle paint and attracted the attention of tourists for their colorful, both na√Øve and surrealistic style. When Tingatinga died in 1972, his style was so popular that it had started a wide movement of imitators and followers, sometimes informally referred to as the \\"Tingatinga school\\".The tingatinga school of painting. This is an informal term (i.e., those who paint after Tingatinga's example) and not to be confused with the Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society, which is a specific organization, although sometimes also referred to as a \\"school\\". The first generation of artists from the Tingatinga school basically reproduced the works of the school's founder. In the 1990s new trends emerged within the Tingatinga style, in response to the transformations that the Tanzanian society was undergoing after independence. New subjects related to the new urban and multi-ethnic society of Dar es Salaam (e.g., crowded and busy streets and squares) were introduced, together with occasional technical novelties (such as the use of perspective). One of the most well known second- generation Tingatinga painters is Edward Tingatinga's brother-in-law, Simon Mpata.Tingatinga first students Because of his short artistic life, Tingatinga left only a relatively small number of paintings, which are sought- after by collectors. Today it is known that fakes were produced from all famous Tingatinga paintings like The lion, Peacock on the Baobab Tree, Antelope, Leopard, Buffalo, or Monkey. Influences Ngapa, the village of E.S.Tingatinga's father na√Øve style that might resemble Tingatinga art It is controversial whether Tingatinga's style is completely original or a derivative of traditional forms of East Africa. In his seminal paper Tingatinga and His Followers, Swedish critic Berit Sahlstr√∂m claimed that Tingatinga was of Mozambican origin and thus suggested that his style might have connections with modern Mozambique. The claim that Tingatinga was of Mozambican descent is nevertheless rejected by most scholars and by the Tingatinga Society. Art trader Yves Goscinny suggested that Edward Tingatinga might have been influenced by Congolese paintings that were sold in Dar es Salaam at his times.\\"Art in Tanzania 2010\\" The source of this claim could be some articles by Merete Teisen, where she also claims that Tingatinga decorated two house walls for payment before he started painting on masonite boards. The claim by Merete Teisen about Tingatinga decorating house walls might also be interpreted as a clue of another origin of Tingatinga's paintings, namely the traditional hut wall decorations of Makua and Makonde people. These paintings were first witnessed by Karl Heule in 1906 and described in his book Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika.K. Weule (1908), Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika, Leipzig. Also ethnologist Jesper Kirknaes and Japanese painting curator Kenji Shiraishi, as well as modern travellers, have seen and documented these paintings in several locations of southern Tanzania, including Ngapa, a village where many relatives of Tingatinga's father still live today. Jesper Kirknaes also documented those painting being done in Dar es Salaam by Makua and Makonde migrants. Shiraishi is one of the scholars who most firmly supported the theory that Tingatinga's art is connected to traditional Makua wall paintings. Among other considerations, Shiraishi observed that it is unlikely that a style emerged and spread so quickly over most East Africa without any connection to traditional art. He claimed that his studies provided evidence for this claim.Kenji Shiraishi, Commentary to Tingatinga II; article: Tinga TingaContemporary African Art and Mural; Tingatinga: Afurikan poppu-ato no sekai / Kenji Shiraishi and Fumiko Yamamoto. Tokyo: Kodansha, 1990) In 2010 Hanne Thorup interviewed Tingatinga student Omari Amonde, who confirmed that Tingatinga used to paint on hut walls as a young boy (around 12 years old).Hanne Thorup and Chitra Sundaram (2010), Tingatinga, Kitsch or Art, p. 22; article: Off the walls to Hard Board and Canvas; What inspired Tingatinga? Further elaborating on the Makua painting hypothesis, Shiraishi also suggested a connection between hut walls, painting and traditional rock paintings, an art form that in Africa has continued past Stone Age to at least the 19th century. Based on this connection, Shiraishi concludes that Tingatinga art might be seen as the \\"longest artist trend ever\\".Kenji Shirashi, Lilanga's Cosmos, Africa Hoy, p. 7 The Tingatinga Cooperative Society After Tingatinga's death, his direct 6 followers Ajaba Abdallah Mtalia, Adeusi Mandu, January Linda, Casper Tedo, Simon Mpata, and Omari AmondeMwasanga, National Arts Council, Mture Publishers, Tingatinga, p 30 tried to organize themselves. Relatives of Tingatinga also joined this group, which would be later called the \\"Tingatinga (or Tinga Tinga) Partnership\\". Not all of Tingatinga followers agreed to be in the partnership; some created a new group at Slipway.Abdellahamani Hasani In 1990, the Tingatinga Partnership constituted itself into a society, renamed to Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society (TACS). The Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society launched their own website in May 2018: www.tingatingaArt.com Tingatinga and George Lilanga Although the internationally acclaimed Tanzanian artist George Lilanga was not a student of the Tingatinga school, nor a member of the Tingatinga Society, he's known to have frequented Tingatinga artists, and some influence of Tingatinga is evident in his work, for what concerns painting (an art form that Lilanga approached in 1974).George Lilanga, Kamphausen This influence has been recognized by Lilanga himself in an interview with Kenji Shiraishi, specifically in reference to the use of enamel paint and square hardboards.See K. Shiraishi, Lilanga's Cosmos, Africa Hoy, p. 7. The book reports Lilanga's words as follow: It was entirely my own idea to incorporate this style. Nobody suggest I do it. In the Tingatinga style, I use enamel paint on hardboard. This board is excellent for achieving vivid color.\\" Besides using materials and techniques originally adopted by Tingatinga painters, Lilanga's art resembles Tingatinga also in its use of vibrant colorsEnrico Masceloni, Catalogue Raisonne, George Lilanga, p. XII and its composition style, that shares the same horror vacui of Tingatinga art. It has been suggested that Lilanga (who was originally a sculptor) actually learned to paint from Tingatinga painters such as Noel Kapanda and later Mchimbi Halfani, who collaborated with him.See also the Lilanga.org and Makonde Carvings websites The collaboration between Lilanga and Kapanda lasted several years.K.

He graduated from the Eastman School of Music. He made his debut at the New York City Opera as The Emperor Altuom in Giacomo Puccini's Turandot, and received a laudatory solo review by Eric Salzman of The New York Times for that small role. Stern progressed from small character parts to the lyric tenor roles of Don Ottavio, Belmonte, The Duke in Rigoletto, Rom√©o, Rodolfo, Pinkerton, and Cavaradossi. He then played great dramatic tenor roles, including Otello, Radames, Canio, Don Jos√©, Calaf, Manrico, Don Alvaro, Andrea Chenier, Samson, Dick Johnson, Bacchus, Lohengrin and Tannh√§user. During his international career, he also studied with Franco Corelli in New York City. Stern performed in opera houses in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe and China. He received critical acclaim for his singing, his acting and character delineation, and his portrait sculpture and works on paper. Stern now performs as a duo with his wife, and continues his work in the visual arts. Life and career=Early studies Stern's vocal training began at age 14 in New York City with Eduardo Battente, a tenor graduate of the Naples Conservatory. Stern learned the roles of The Duke in Rigoletto; Nemorino in Don Pasquale and Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor. Stern attended the High School of Music and Art, now known as Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts. During his years there, he performed regularly as a super (non-singing extra) at the Metropolitan Opera. At 17, Stern performed the leading role of Mr. Scratch (The Devil) in the High School of Music and Art's production of The Devil and Daniel Webster at Hunter College's Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse, with composer Douglas Moore attending. Moore expressed his astonishment that such a young singer could interpret the role so powerfully. Stern received the Voice Award upon graduating. Stern married fellow vocal student Barbara Cagnazzo, an aspiring soul singer. During the Korean War, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and stationed in Germany, where he continued vocal study, gave concerts at the Amerika Haus in Heidelberg.

Stern's parents were European emigrants of varied ethnicity. He speaks five languages. =New York City Opera= After graduating from the Eastman School of Music, Stern and his family returned to New York. He and his wife had a third child, daughter Heidi (1960), in Queens, where they first resided. After marrying his second wife, Rita Loving, an accomplished pianist, singer, and operatic vocal coach, Stern and his children moved to Manhattan's Upper West Side. Maurice became the cantor soloist in a reform synagogue. Also during this period he performed in the popular Viennese and Italian restaurants that featured opera, operetta and Italian songs, such as the Viennese Lantern, Bianchi & Margaritas, and Asti's. Throughout most of the 1960s Stern performed as a tenor soloist with orchestras in many Catskill Hotels, including the famous Concord Hotel where the composer Sholom Secunda was the musical director and conductor. Stern performed in the Catskill Mountains and onstage in New York City in collaboration with his second wife as a duet act called \\"Loving and Stern.\\" In addition, Stern performed as soloist under Secunda at Madison Square Garden. Stern received a scholarship from the Henry Street Settlement to study with the Metropolitan Opera soprano Rose Bampton and her husband, conductor Wilfrid Pelletier. Stern performed the role of Spoleta in an NBC production of Puccini's Tosca with Pelletier conducting. An audition for the New York City Opera, arranged by Bampton, began Stern's operatic career. Among the many roles he sang at New York City Opera were Porcus in Jeanne d'Arc au b√ªcher by Arthur Honegger; Don Basilio in The Marriage of Figaro and Tanchum the Madman in the world premiere of The Golem, by Abraham Ellstein. In the role of Tanchum Miles Kastendieck of the New York Journal-American noted \\"Maurice Stern's madman topped all the characterizations, for he acts and sings with complete conviction.\\" Paul Henry Lang of New York Herald Tribune wrote, \\"Maurice Stern acted and sang the role of the madman with convincing force.\\" Winthrop Sargeant of The New Yorker stated, \\"Maurice Stern, as a ghetto madman, made outstanding contributions ‚Ä¶with his exceptional abilities as an actor.\\" Stern sang the role of Giles Corey in the world premiere of The Crucible (opera) by Robert Ward at the New York City Opera, and also in its first recording. Irving Kolodin noted in The Saturday Review that \\"Maurice Stern was a striking Giles Corey\\". Stern performed regularly with the company through 1963 and later returned as guest in the roles of Robespierre in the American premieres of Danton's Death by Gottfried von Einem and The Inspector General by Werner Egk. He also appeared as the Shepherd in Oedipus Rex by Igor Stravinsky. Further roles in Douglas Moore operas included: An Old Silver Miner in The Ballad of Baby Doe; The Lecturer at the National Gallery in the world premiere of The Wings of the Dove at the New York City Opera, and a repeat performance of Mr. Scratch in The Devil and Daniel Webster at Kansas City Lyric Theater. Stern appeared as Captain James Lee in the world premiere of Deseret, an opera by Leonard Kastle based on an episode in the life of the Mormon prophet Brigham Young. Both the world premiere with the Memphis Opera Theatre and later performances with the Pasadana Opera Company were conducted by Anton Coppola and directed by Leonard Kastle. As character tenor, Stern performed the roles of The Steersman in Der Fliegende Hollander with Birgit Nilsson and Ramon Vinay at the Pittsburgh Opera, directed by Tito Capobianco; Gaston in La Traviata with Joan Sutherland at Philadelphia Lyric Opera; Remendado in Carmen with Jon Vickers at Philadelphia Lyric Opera; Tybalt in Rom√©o et Juliette with Franco Corelli at Philadelphia Lyric Opera; and Trin in La Fanciulla del West with Franco Corelli at Philadelphia Lyric Opera with Anton Guadagno conducting. It was at this time that Maestro Guadagno suggested that Stern change his professional operatic name to \\"Mauro Lampi.\\" Under his newly adopted stage name Stern performed the role of Rustighello at the debut of Montserrat Caball√© in Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia at Carnegie Hall. When Caball√© appeared again at Carnegie Hall later that year in Donizetti's Roberto Devereux, Stern performed the role of Lord Cecil. Both performances at Carnegie Hall were commercially recorded. In 1962 Stern was a recipient of the Ford Foundation Grant for Opera Singers. He began singing leading tenor roles nationally in opera houses around the United States, such as Rodolfo in La Boheme with The Syracuse Opera Company and with Arlington Opera, Rom√©o in Rom√©o et Juliette with Seattle Opera; Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni with Dayton Opera and Toledo Opera; Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly with Connecticut Opera, The Duke in Rigoletto with Hartford Opera, the title role in Faust with Connecticut Opera, and Gabriel von Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus with Dayton Opera, Columbus Opera and the Opera Guild of Greater Miami. =Europe= Stern's second career in Europe began when he was engaged as leading tenor in St√§dtische B√ºhnen Flensburg from 1969 to 1971. Rita and his three children moved with him from New York City to Flensburg, Germany. There, he sang the title roles in Lohengrin and Andrea Chenier, Cavaradossi in Tosca, Radames in Aida, The Duke in Rigoletto and Belmonte in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail. This was followed by an engagement at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden where he sang Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly, Rodolfo in La Boheme, Don Jos√© in Carmen, Alfredo in La Traviata, the title role in Xerxes (Serse), Barinkay in Der Zigeunerbaron, Hans in The Bartered Bride, Belmonte in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, The Singer in Der Rosenkavalier and Rinuccio in Gianni Schicchi. During this time he made guest appearances at the Oper Frankfurt as Rodolfo in La Boheme; at Stadttheater Klagenfurt as Hans in The Bartered Bride; at the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe as Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly and The Duke in Rigoletto; and at Theater der Stadt Koblenz as Cavaradossi in Tosca. =Voice professor at the University of Washington= In 1973, Stern joined the Voice Faculty at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he met his future third wife, Molly Hogan. then a student at the university. He gave many solo concert performances at the University and appeared as tenor soloist in Handel's Messiah with the Detroit Symphony under Paul Freeman, the Verdi Requiem with the Honolulu Symphony under Robert LaMarchina, and in numerous concerts with the University Symphony Orchestra under Samuel Krachmalnick. He appeared as Manrico in Il Trovatore at the Nevada Opera and in the title role of Andrea Chenier at the Houston Grand Opera, indicating that his voice was leaning toward a dramatic tenor. Pupils of Stern have performed as soloists at the opera companies of Houston, San Francisco, and Seattle, and in Europe, of Essen, Flensburg, Linz, Hamburg and Z√ºrich. International careerDramatic tenor roles= In 1979 Stern moved back to Europe using his earlier stage name, Mauro Lampi, to sing the role of Calaf in Turandot and the title role of Tannh√§user at the Landestheater Linz in Linz, Austria. The next season, as Maurice Stern, he became a member of the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in D√ºsseldorf, Germany (Opernhaus D√ºsseldorf) where he premiered the title role of Otello in a new production under the baton of Maestro Alberto Erede.footnote 4 He also performed the role in Theater Duisburg. The Neue Ruhr Zeitung Duisburg noted that \\"Maurice Stern gives OTELLO greatness and stature, in combination with excitement and expressive singability of his dark-toned tenor voice\\". Otello became a staple of Stern's repertoire. He also performed it in the German theaters of Musiktheater im Revier, Theater L√ºbeck and Theater Augsburg. Stern appeared in a production of Otello in Montr√©al. He sang \\"Dio, mi potevi scagliar,\\" which resulted in L'√îp√®ra de Montr√©al engaging Stern to sing seven performances of Otello in a televised production with Alfredo Silipigni conducting and Antoine Vitez directing. Stern was called upon to sing Otello at The Kentucky Opera, replacing James King who withdrew because of illness. Sir Alexander Gibson conducted the performances. The critical response to Stern's portrayal of Otello was enthusiastic: \\"He managed Otello's progress through jealousy to the edge of madness movingly, and his entire performance was heightened by his eager attention to every possibility for emotional nuance.\\" Additional roles that Stern performed at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein included: Don Alvaro in La Forza del Destino, Canio in Pagliacci, Porcus in Jeanne d'Arc au b√ªcher by Arthur Honegger and Alfred in Die Fledermaus under the stage direction of Otto Schenk. Stern sang the role of Canio at the Frankfurt Opera in Germany and in Belgium at De Vlaamse Opera in Antwerp, which then toured the production to Ghent and Brugges. In America, he portrayed Canio at the Michigan Opera Theatre opposite the Nedda of Diana Soviero, again with the Dayton Opera, National Grand Opera, Brevard Festival and in Charleston, West Virginia. Stern's repertoire included Radames in Aida, which he performed in several productions of the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin opposite Anna Tomowa-Sintow as Aida; at De Vlaamse Opera in Antwerp, Belgium opposite Livia Budai as Amneris; followed by performances at the Norwegian National Opera, with Giancarlo del Monaco directing. Other engagements with Stern as Radames followed at the Austin Lyric Opera, Taipei National Opera; Opera/Columbus and the Miami Greater Opera Association with the Aida of Alessandra Marc. Stern appeared as Calaf in Turandot opposite Olivia Stapp as Turandot at the Teatro de la Opera, San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1985 he sang the role of Dick Johnson in Puccini's La Fanciulla del West at Gian Carlo Menotti's Festival dei Due Mondi in Charleston, South Carolina. The opera was directed by Bruce Beresford. The production was then taken to Spoleto, Italy and the premiere was televised by Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI). He later performed the role of Dick Johnson at Opera/Columbus opposite Carol Neblett as Minnie. Stern sang Samson in Samson et Dalila at the Utah Opera in Salt Lake City. He was later engaged by the Metropolitan Opera as a cover for Pl√°cido Domingo for the role of Samson in the Metropolitan's new production of Samson et Dalila. Other roles Stern performed were Manrico in Il Trovatore at the Teatro Teresa Carre√±o in Caracas, Venezuela which was broadcast for television; the same role at the Austin Lyric Opera; Don Jos√© in Carmen in Mexico City, Quer√©taro and Toluca with Enrique Batiz conducting; Turr√≠du in Cavalleria Rusticana in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland; Cavaradossi in Tosca in Winterthur, Switzerland and in the French cities of Perpignan and S√®te; and Gabriel von Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus in the Italian cities of Bolzano, Trieste, Bregenz, and Riva del Garda. In 1991, Stern returned to Seattle to sing Bacchus in a production of Ariadne auf Naxos at the Seattle Opera with Hermann Michael conducting. Sculptor and graphic artist On the long bus tours around the country with New York City Opera, Stern started sculpting busts of fellow singers. Gradually, his repertoire expanded to include other personalities, such as the former director of New York City Opera, John Simon White, and conductor Felix Popper. Between his graduation from Eastman School of Music and his second marriage, Stern's roommates were Dustin Hoffman and Robert Duvall. Stern sculpted portraits of both. Hoffman's sculpture was displayed at the opening of The Graduate and also featured in Life magazine. Stern sculpted continuously and prolifically throughout his career as an opera singer. He sculpted his children, wives, family and friends. His sculpting talent was such that it provided the Stern family with a second income, as Stern was commissioned for portrait work in Germany and the United States. Stern has received awards both for his portrait sculptures and his works on paper. He is a member of Audubon Artists, Allied Artists of America, The American Artists Professional League, The National Sculpture Society, and his work has been featured in \\"The Signature\\" magazine of The American Society of Portrait Artists. He has presented one-man shows at the Cornish Gallery in Seattle; in Germany at the Flensburger Stadtstheater in Flensburg and at the Atelier Moering in Wiesbaden. Stern's three children Robert, Stephen and Heidi Stern, are all musicians, each working in different genres. Stephen has the additional talent of his father, graphic artistry, having attended The Arts Students League in New York City until 1969. Robert, like his father, was accepted into New York City's High School of Music and Art in New York City. Heidi studied violin and music theory at the Juilliard School of Music, and was in the children's orchestra before the family move to Germany in 1969. She later became known as a singer under the name Jennifer Rush. Her 1984 single \\"The Power of Love\\" was a top-10 hit in several European countries. In 1993 Stern became a grandfather to Ariel Stern Rush. He and Molly Stern live in uptown Manhattan, where he maintains a sculpture studio, and participates in local gallery tours.

More than 300 Nevyansk icons of the 18th to the 20th centuries are on display there. Entrance is free for everyone. The museum was opened in 1999 by Evgeny Roizman. According to Chief Curator Maksim Borovik, in its first five years, more than 200,000 persons visited it. The main purpose of the museum is to save the phenomenon of the Nevyansk icon. History The Nevyansk icon is documented as having existed from 1734 (the icon \\"Our Lady of Egypt\\"), until 1919 (\\"The Saviour Pantocrator\\"). In fact there are even earlier Nevyansk icons in the museum, and the last secret icon painters appear to have existed in 1950. The phenomenon that is called \\"High Nevyansk\\" practically didn't outlast the end of the 18th century. With the accession of Alexander I of Russia, the spread of the Common Faith and industrial development in the Urals, Nevyansk icon painting had a new birth. Having orders from rich factory owners, tax farmers and owners of goldmines, Nevyansk masters of Bogatirev's dynasty created magnificent masterpieces until the late 1830s, but the original, authentic, strict Nevyansk icons remained in the 18th century. Origin of name In the 18th century Nevyansk (Ural mountains) was a small Old Believers' center. There were just a few workshops there, the experience of icon painting had been only 100 years. Life wasn't so easy for icon painters: regular roundups, searches. The masters hid in skits. They didn't paint to sell, only when they had orders (if there wasn't any, they didn't paint at all). People respected icon painters, all of them were literate. Their customers were literate too, they were sophisticated and very rich Old Believers. They knew what they wanted to get for their money. Besides all of them were sincere believers and they were ready to do everything for their faith. That's why appeared the phenomenon \\" Nevyansk icon\\". There isn't a great quantity of Nevyansk icons, but each of them is a precious treasure. Sometimes the museum takes icons which cannot be restored, only for the last fragments. Expositions The first exposition of the museum was in May, 2005 in Feropontovo. Then there was another exposition of the icons in Yaroslavl.

It had a major role in the financing of numerous railroads and other infrastructure projects by mobilizing the savings of middle class French investors as capital for vast lending schemes. The Cr√©dit Mobilier investments created vast debts for the countries which accepted these infrastructure loans and was thus indirectly involved in the European occupations of the countries whose governments defaulted on these loans during the worldwide economic depression of the 1870s. It became a powerful and dynamic funding agency for major projects in France, Europe, North Africa and the world at large. As Napoleon III redeveloped Paris, the Cr√©dit Mobilier speculated on real estate with inside information and collaborated with Hausmann to develop neighborhoods such as rue de Rivoli, Op√©ra, and place de l'Etoile. Beyond France, it specialized in mining development; it funded other banks including the Imperial Ottoman Bank and the Austrian Mortgage Bank; it funded railway construction and insurance companies, as well as building contractors. The bank had large investments in transatlantic steamship lines, urban gas lighting, a newspaper and the Paris public transit system. In 1866/7, the bank underwent a severe crisis, and the Pereire brothers were forced to resign at the demand of their enemy, the Banque de France; the Cr√©dit Mobilier never recovered. History and objectives Established in 1852,P.B. Whale -Joint Stock Banking In Germany: A Study Of The German Creditbanks Before And After The War Routledge, 22 Mar 1968 Retrieved 2012-06-02 the French Government sanctioned the statutes of the new bank with the name of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale du Cr√©dit Mobilier, with a capital of 60,000,000 francs. It was permitted to issue obligations up to ten times its assets - 600 million francs of debt for 60 million francs of equity. It was founded by the Pereire brothers with a view to countering James Mayer Rothschild's alliance with the industrialist Paulin Talabot regarding competition for the railway expansion. It was allowed to acquire shares of public companies, and to pay calls made upon it in respect of such shares by its own notes or obligations; also to sell or give in security all shares thus acquired. The operations of the society were conducted upon a very extensive scale. A joint-stock company operating on a principle of limited liability, its initial investments came from large industrialists, but its capital was vastly increased by accepting investments from the general public.Newmarch, William, ‚ÄúOn the Recent History of the Cr√©dit Mobilier,‚Äù Journal of the Statistical Society of London, Vol. 21, No. 4 (December 1858), pp. 444-453 In 1854 it subscribed largely to the war loan of the French government, raised during the Crimean War, to the Grand Central Railway Company, to the General Omnibus Company of Paris, and to various other important projects. The dividend declared for 1854 was 12%. In 1855, it lent two sums to the government‚Äîthe one of 250,000,000 and the other of 375,000,000 francs. Its operations were vast during this year, and the net dividend declared amounted to 40%. The directors then proposed to avail themselves of their privilege of issuing their own obligations, and thought to issue two kinds of notes‚Äîthe one at short dates, the other at long dates, and redeemable by installments. The proposed issue was to amount to 240,000,000 francs, but the public became alarmed at the prospect of so vast an issue of paper money, and in March 1856, the French government deemed it necessary to prohibit the proposed scheme. The prohibition was a severe blow to the institution. In 1856, its dividends did not exceed 22%; in 1857 they were only 5%. Several attempts to resuscitate its credit failed, and finally, in November 1871, it was reorganized with a new board of management. In 1877 its assets were 77,000,000 francs, but its shares, the par value of which was 500 francs, sold for 200 francs only. During 1878‚Äì79 the capital was first reduced to 32,000,000 francs, and then increased to 40,000,000. In 1884 it was a second time reduced to 30,000,000 francs, but the company never regained its losses.

A. Salvatore set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting; it is the first book in the Neverwinter Saga. Released in October 2010, it follows the continued adventures of drow elf renegade, Drizzt Do'Urden. This story is set 24 years after the end of Transitions: The Ghost King.  Plot summary Gauntlgrym begins in the year 1409, DR in the dwarven complex of Mithral Hall. King Bruenor Battlehammer, with Drizzt Do'Urden, sits on his throne and mourns over the loss of his friend Regis and his adoptive daughter Catti-brie nearly 24 years before. Both Companions of the Hall were lost to the deadly effects of the Spellplague. Wulfgar has returned to Icewind Dale and has decided to remain in those most dangerous of lands. In a conversation with his dear friend Drizzt, Bruenor laments over all that has happened since those terrible events. The signing of the Treaty of Garumn's Gorge has brought a lasting peace to the Silver Marches. Obould II has inherited the Kingdom of Many-Arrows from his father Obould I, though he is not nearly as clever or as powerful as his father. Above all, King Bruenor regrets never completing his quest to find the legendary home of the Delzoun dwarves, Gauntlgrym. Meanwhile, Nanfoodle, the gnome inventor famous for his Moment of Elminister - a purposeful explosion that sent gas swarming to the surface during a vicious battle 40 years earlier - and Jessa Dribble-Obould, an orc, hatch a plan to poison Bruenor. Nanfoodle poisons the king's ale. Thibbledorf Pwent the battlerager notices something amiss about Nanfoodle's behavior but cannot quite place it. Bruenor drinks the ale and shortly after the entire population of Mithral Hall goes into mourning at the abrupt death of their king. Banak Brawnanvil is named Eleventh King of Mithral Hall. Pwent, distraught over the death of Bruenor, seeks out Nanfoodle and Jessa for answers in the hills outside of Mithral Hall. Upon finding the traitorous pair, he attempts to attack them for answers. During the fight, Drizzt, as well as a very-much alive Bruenor arrives; the latter demands of Pwent what he is doing here instead of at Banak's side. The ever-loyal Pwent replies that his life and his duty lie with his beloved king. It is then revealed that Bruenor faked his death with the help of Nanfoodle and Jessa in order to continue his quest for Gauntlgrym while leaving Mithral Hall in Banak's good hands. Drizzt, Bruenor, Jessa, Nanfoodle, Pwent, Guenhwyvar, and Andahar then leave on their secret quest. (Andahar is a magical unicorn that can be summoned much like Guenhwyvar, Athrogate's demon boar, or Jarlaxle's nightmare. Andahar was a gift to Drizzt from the ruling council of Silverymoon for his work with both blade and diplomacy during the Third Orc War.) 42 years later in the year 1451 DR the elf warrior Dahlia Sin'felle is engaged in a conversation with her vampire lover, Korvin Dor'crae. Dahlia has been charged by the Red Wizard of Thay lich Zulkir Szass Tam to go to create a Dread Ring. This is an enchanted area that produces countless undead minions. She is charged to go to Luskan in order to investigate possibilities. There are several flashbacks of Dahlia as a child and the cruelties she suffered at the hands of Netherese barbarians and demons. She was raped by the barbarians and impregnated by the tiefling Herzgo Alegni and forced to bear his demon offspring which she killed soon after it was born while she was still a child herself. Dahlia is an exceptionally talented warrior and uses the break staff weapon, Kozah's Needle. This is an eight-foot-long staff that can be broken into four two-foot sections attached by a chain. The break staff can be configured in many ways. It also allows the owner to summon lightning during battle. She also wears diamond studs as a tribute to her lovers. Eight are in her left ear to signify lovers she has murdered and one in her right ear for those who have so far escaped that fate. Before leaving on her mission, she kills her former lover Themerelis, a powerful ranger wielding a greatsword. This angers her rival Sylora Salm as she was also Themerelis' lover. Meanwhile, Drizzt, Bruenor, and Pwent have continued to search for Gauntlgrym with no success. Nanfoodle and Jessa stay with them for many years, but eventually die of old age. While searching for the lost kingdom in Ten-Towns and Icewind Dale, they investigate rumors of a sanctuary inhabited by a beautiful witch and a halfling caretaker. While visiting Clan Battlehammer, Bruenor (traveling under the alias Bonnego) decides to continue his search for more information to the location of Gauntlgrym. Pwent, having reached an age where he is not as agile and mobile as he once was, reluctantly decides to stay in Icewind Dale when Drizzt and Bruenor take their leave. Herzgo Alegni is in the city of Neverwinter working with the Netherese and opposing the Ashmadai. Upset that the city lord will not rename a bridge after him, he recalls his chief assassin Barrabus the Gray from his home in Memnon. Barrabus is described as a dark-haired, dark-eyed, slight but muscular man. Although it is never mentioned, he bears a striking resemblance to Drizzt's former arch- rival Artemis Entreri. Barrabus is armed with a main-gauche and a magic knife. The knife can hold and deliver poison with deadly accuracy. He then instructs Barrabus to convince the lord of the city to change the bridge's name. When Barrabus shows disdain towards Herzgo, the assassin is punished by means of a magical tuning fork on the sword that Herzgo carries. The sword is called Claw and has a blood-red blade. The magic attack causes Barrabus much pain. Barrabus is successful in getting the name of the bridge changed. Dahlia and Dor'crae arrive in Luskan and enter the Illusk (undead section of Luskan). While there, they meet the unstable lich Valindra Shadowmantle. She informs them that the magical disturbances Dahlia has been sent to investigate come from Gauntlgrym. Dor'crae is sent to investigate and returns with news of Gauntlgrym's location. Dahlia realizes that she will need a Delzoun dwarf to access the dwarf kingdom and seeks out Athrogate and his drow friend Jarlaxle and convinces them to accompany her. Herzgo is at odds with the Red Wizards and the Ashmadai, and when he learns of their agents in Luskan he tells Barrabus to go investigate. Dahlia, Dor'crae, Athrogate, Jarlaxle, and Valindra all head towards Gauntlgrym using the tunnels. They find the place and are able to enter because of Athrogate's heritage as a Delzoun. They encounter dwarf ghosts while there. Their goal is the Forge of Gauntlgrym at the center of the city, reputed to have crafted the finest items in its day. Dor'crae uses a magical device that allows Sylora Salm to follow them from afar. The party is attacked along the way by dire corbies. While engaged with the bird men, Sylora arrives with some henchmen and proceeds to attack the party as well. Athrogate is forced to the forge and, under the hypnotic powers of Dor'crae and Sylora, is coerced into believing that the Gauntlgrym ghosts want him to throw the lever that will activate the forge. When this happens a fire primordial (ancient being of almost godlike power) is released. Dor'crae, Valindra, and Sylora make their escape. Jarlaxle, Athrogate, and Dahlia also make their way back to Luskan. Sylora then seeks out Dahlia and commands her to follow her and serve her under threat of death and Szass Tam's displeasure. Barrabus plans to leave Neverwinter for Luskan. Drizzt and Bruenor still travel the country nearby. At this moment the primordial that has been released causes a volcanic explosion. Venting its rage against living beings, it targets Neverwinter and destroys the town. Barrabus is barely able to survive. Eleven years later in 1462 DR the Dread Ring has been completed thanks to the death and destruction caused by the primordial's rage. New types of undead stalk the land. The war between the Thayans, the Ashmadai, and the Netherese escalates. Dahlia is forced to serve Sylora and Barrabus hunts the Ashmadai with great success under orders from Herzgo. Dahlia and Barrabus's efforts culminate in a confrontation between the pair. Dahlia's unorthodox weapon initially grants her an advantage over Barrabus‚Äô two-handed style, yet Barrabus eventually forces Dahlia to go on the defensive and outright flee at one point as Barrabus increases the tempo of combat, suggesting that Barrabus is actually the more skilled of the two combatants. Dahlia takes to the trees for cover as Barrabus pursues but Barrabus uses Dahlia's own trick against her as he takes to the trees as well causing Dahlia to completely lose track of him. Further combat between the two is forgone as Dahlia discovers and joins ranks with an Ashmadai patrol group. Jarlaxle and Athrogate continue to reside in Luskan, still seeking a way to avenge themselves for the events that occurred in Gauntlgrym 11 years before. The ghost dwarves of Gauntlgrym, wanting to reseal the primordial, spread out across the land searching for Delzoun dwarves to help. Eventually they arrive in Icewind Dale and cryptically inform the dwarves of their plight. They also inform Bruenor of the situation. He and Drizzt then take it upon themselves to seal the primordial. Jarlaxle meanwhile returns to Menzoberranzan to seek the help of his brother Gromph in sealing away the primordial. Jarlaxle learns that he will need a dwarf king in addition to other magical devices. Dahlia also searches for a way to get back to Gauntlgrym and to seal off the primordial, hoping this will lead to her freedom from Sylora. Finding the way blocked (the tunnels have collapsed), Dahlia seeks out Jarlaxle. Bruenor, deciding where to go next, is robbed of his maps in the woods by a drow elf. Drizzt, correctly deducing who is behind this, leads Bruenor to Luskan in search of Jarlaxle. Dahlia finds Jarlaxle and accepts a magic ring from him. Bruenor and Drizzt arrive at the Cutlass in Luskan. There they are attacked by Ashmadai led by Dahlia. Jarlaxle and Athrogate enter the fight. The four of them beat back the attackers and Dahlia appears to be captured by Jarlaxle's 'wand of goo'. Instead, Dahlia uses the ring to fake her death. Jarlaxle, Athrogate, Dahlia, Bruenor, and Drizzt decide to travel to Gauntlgrym together in an attempt to stop the primordial and hopefully destroy the Dread Ring in the process. The five proceed to Gauntlygrym overland in search of a cave that will lead them down. They are attacked by a group of Ashmadai near the cave. This battle is observed by Dor'crae and Sylora who follow them. Barrabus also witnesses the fight and upon seeing Drizzt is overcome by emotion and retreats without having been seen by anyone. The five enter Gauntlgrym whereupon Bruenor sits upon the dwarf king's throne and is enchanted with divine power and knowledge from the ancient dwarves. The primordial has attracted many minions from the Elemental Plane of Fire to fight off intruders, powerful salamanders and even a small red dragon. Sylora and Dor'crae enter along with a host of Ashmadai. Valindra uses a magical scepter given to her by Sylora to summon Beealtimatuche, a pit fiend from the Nine Hells. Meanwhile, in order to contain the primordial, the five companions must strategically place 10 bowls that summon water elementals in various places throughout the city. Fighting through waves of salamanders, the five companions begin to set the elemental bowls into the proper alcoves. During the fighting, dwarves from Icewind Dale and Mirabar (who have also been visited by dwarf ghosts) arrive in another part of Gauntlgrym in order to help seal the primordial. The companions are only able to place nine of the ten summoning bowls as one alcove had been destroyed earlier. They then head to the Forge Of Gauntlgrym. In a trance, Bruenor places his axe and shield into the forge and removes them, to find that they are magically enhanced. The shield now provides real potions of heroism to the companions. The Ashmadai, led by the pit fiend, who just killed the red dragon, then enter the forge room. The pit fiend engages the five and manages to kill the consummate survivor Jarlaxle in one blow. While Drizzt and Dahlia hold off the Ashmadai and several legion devils, Athrogate and Bruenor move deeper into the city to seal the primordial, but are intercepted by Beealtimatuche. Athrogate attempts to fight the devil, but is only able to wound the devil before he slapped aside. God-blessed Bruenor engages Beealtimatuche in a titanic battle, but even with his new powers, the devil seizes the upper hand. Thibbledorf Pwent - left behind in Icewind Dale - reappears and goes after Bruenor to protect him. Dahlia and Drizzt gain the upper hand until Valindra arrives. The lich is driven away by Jarlaxle who was not killed but saved by the same ring that allowed Dahlia to fake her own death. Drizzt, Jarlaxle, and Dahlia then go after Bruenor. Bruenor is aided by Pwent, who is nearly killed by the pit fiend. Finally, the grievously-injured King Bruenor cleaves the devil's head in half and throws him in the heart of the primordial. Pwent helps the mortally wounded Bruenor toward the lever. Dahlia enters just in time to see Dor'crae (who has followed them in) tear out Pwent's throat. Dahlia then attacks and drives the vampire off with a wooden spike from her magic ring. Bruenor, with his last ounce of strength manages to pull the lever and. Attempting to escape, Dor'crae is caught in a waterfall created when the lever was pulled, and explodes into black flakes, seemingly destroyed. The primordial is sealed. The Dread Ring is broken. Drizzt manages get to Bruenor and hold him in tender embrace and with his last breath nodded to Drizzt with a look of comfort died in an embrace of friendship. Jarlaxle manages to help Athrogate escape. Bruenor is buried in Gauntlgrym along with Pwent. Dahlia moves the last earring to her left ear, symbolizing the vampire's death. She plans to face Sylora who not only avoided the battle, but was the principal advisor to the plan. Drizzt, with growing feelings toward her, decides to accompany her. In the epilogue, Bruenor wakes up in the forest of the goddess Mielikki. He is met by his dear friend Regis and adoptive son Wulfgar. Regis remarks that Bruenor is indeed dead, and when he motions behind the dwarf king, he turns to see his adopted daughter, Catti-brie, dancing in the woods. The crusty dwarf, who so often hides his feelings from even those closest to him, sinks to his knees and cries. Reception Ryan Van Cleave of California Literary Review stated that Gauntlgrym is a \\"quick read with satisfying fight scenes, and deeply layered with emotional atmosphere.\\" Van Cleave also concluded that it is a solid addition to Drizzt's ongoing story. Gauntlgrym debuted on The New York Times bestseller list at number 13 on October 24, 2010. The book entered the USA Today Top 150 on October 14, 2010, and was on the USA Today Best-Selling Books list for 2 weeks, with #75 as its best week.

His career has spanned the academic world and the BBC, while his books include Kissing Cousins (a comparative study of British and American social attitudes); critical portraits of the Amadeus Quartet and of Pl√°cido Domingo; a study of the cultural impact of The Hitler √âmigr√©s; an anthology of essays about today's leading historians; and The Gilded Stage: A Social History of Opera. Life and career Snowman was born and raised in London, his parents coming from Anglo-Jewish families with roots in 19th-century Eastern Europe. He was educated at Cambridge (Double First-class degree in History) and Cornell (MA in Government) and from 1963‚Äì7 was a lecturer in Politics and American Studies at the University of Sussex. In 1967, he went to the BBC for a 6-month stint as a radio producer, rejoining as a full-time staff member in 1970. In 1967, too, Snowman joined the London Philharmonic Choir, an ensemble with whom he sang for 48 years, and whose history he has written. At the BBC, Snowman was responsible for a wide variety of radio programmes on cultural and historical subjects, working with such established broadcasters as Bernard Crick, Robin Day, Bill Grundy, Lord Hailsham, William Hardcastle and John Vaizey while also helping develop the broadcasting careers of such younger figures as Susan Hill, Aled Jones, Norman Lebrecht, Roy Porter, Edward Seckerson and Lucie Skeaping. Snowman tended to specialize in ambitious series such as The Long March of Everyman, Whatever Happened to Equality?, A World In Common (world development issues), World Powers in the Twentieth Century, Northern Lights (a Radio 4 festival about the Arctic) and Fins de Si√®cle, an attempt to enter and recreate the sound world of the final years of each of the past six centuries. Many of these later appeared as books which Snowman helped edit. After leaving the BBC at the end of 1995, Snowman turned increasingly to writing and lecturing. From 2004 he has held a Senior Research Fellowship at London University's Institute of Historical Research; in 2010 he delivered the IHR Annual Fellows‚Äô Lecture. Personal life Snowman was briefly married to Alice Harris (1964‚Äì66). In 1975, he married Janet Levison and they have two children, Ben and Anna. The marriage ended in divorce in 2014. Publications The Hitler √âmigr√©s: The Cultural Impact on Britain of Refugees from Nazism concerned those who, having escaped the shadow of Nazism, found refuge in Britain and made a lasting mark on the nation's intellectual and cultural life, among them some of Britain's most celebrated artists, architects, musicians, choreographers, film makers, historians, philosophers, scientists, writers, broadcasters and publishers. Historians, based on a long- running series of quarterly essays in the magazine History Today. Snowman examined the so-called ‚ÄòHistory Wave‚Äô, proposed some reasons for this, and suggested that, as people sought a usable ‚ÄòHeritage‚Äô from the past as an aid to their own self-definition, the historian ‚Äì who mediates between past and present ‚Äì took on something of the function of the priest of earlier times. In Historians, he wrote about the life and work of some thirty of the most influential, including Asa Briggs, Peter Burke, David Cannadine, Natalie Zemon Davis, Richard J. Evans, Niall Ferguson, Roy Foster, Antonia Fraser, Eric Hobsbawm, Lisa Jardine, Ian Kershaw, Simon Schama and David Starkey. The Gilded Stage: A Social History of Opera was a pioneering attempt to place the history of opera in its widest historical perspective. Thus, Snowman explored not only the traditional trio of composers, works and artists but also the financing and patronage of opera over the centuries, the changing nature of those in the operatic professions and their audiences, the history of theatrical architecture and of stage design, the impact of new technologies (gas, electric lighting, recording, photography, film etc.), and the globalization of opera in the 20th century. Articles and reviews Articles and reviews by Daniel Snowman have appeared in: BBC History Magazine, BBC Music Magazine, Daily/Sunday Telegraph, Economist, English Historical Review, Gramophone, Guardian, Historical Research, Historically Speaking, History Today, Homes & Gardens, Independent, Jewish Chronicle, Jewish Renaissance, Journal of American Studies, Listener, Literary Review, Living History, Music and Musicians, Musical Times, New Society, New Statesman, Opera, Opera Now, Political Studies, Radio Times, Standard, Sunday Times, Times, Times Literary & Higher Education Supplements, Tribune. His 'Short History of Opera' (and pages about voice types, etc.) was used on the official website of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and in spring 2011 he was commissioned by the ROH to undertake an academic assessment of their Archives and historical Collections. Lectures and public events Snowman is a Frequent Lecturer at British arts festivals, academic and cultural institutions, luncheon clubs etc, and in a typical year delivers some 40‚Äì50 illustrated talks and lectures across the UK and abroad. Since 1999 he has delivered over 600 illustrated lectures to members of The Arts Society (formerly NADFAS).

Founded in 1966 as a luxury shopping complex, it has subsequently become a popular destination for goods aimed at otaku (hobbyists and enthusiasts, particularly those of anime and manga). History Interior of Nakano Broadway Nakano Broadway was developed in the context of the Japanese economic miracle, wherein as Japan rebuilt in the aftermath of the Second World War, multiple megastructures were constructed. Among these were Nakano Broadway and nearby Nakano Sun Plaza, which were designed to be self-contained living and entertainment complexes. The mall opened in 1966 as a shopping and apartment complex housing shops, restaurants, apartments, and a rooftop terrace with a swimming pool and garden. While not a metabolist building, Nakano Broadway is noted as being influenced by metabolist architecture. By the 1980s, Nakano had been eclipsed by Shibuya and Roppongi as districts that catered to luxury commerce, and Nakano Broadway had declined in popularity. As shops in Nakano Broadway are owned by individual retailers and not leased by a central mall administration, young entrepreneurs were able to acquire space in the mall with relatively small amounts of capital. Mandarake, a secondhand manga store, opened in the mall in 1980; Nakano Broadway subsequently shifted to being a destination for otaku-related goods, as stores catering to this demographic opened in the mall following Mandarake's success. Today, Nakano Broadway remains a major destination for both domestic otaku and otaku tourists in Japan, catering to a niche clientele relative to mainstream otaku destinations in Akihabara and Ikebukuro. The physical design of the mall remains largely unchanged from its original 1966 construction and is often cited as an example of Sh≈çwa era architecture. The mall was designated an at-risk building for earthquakes of a magnitude of 6.0 or greater by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in March 2018, as the building was constructed prior to the implementation of contemporary seismic standards in 1981 and has not subsequently been retrofitted to be earthquake-resistant. Features Nakano Broadway contains 3 basement levels and 10 above-ground levels. The first basement to fourth floors of Nakano Broadway contain retail establishments: the basement level contains grocery stores, the ground level contains stores primarily selling clothing and secondhand goods, and the second, third, and fourth floors contain stores selling goods aimed at otaku, including manga, anime goods, figurines, idol merchandise, video games, CDs, and collectables. The remaining above-ground floors of Nakano Broadway contain apartments; Kenji Sawada and Yukio Aoshima are among the notable residents who once lived in Nakano Broadway. Mandarake has operated continuously out of Nakano Broadway since 1980, with twenty-seven individual shops (also known as annexes or kan) at the mall operating under the Mandarake brand; the mall also houses the company's corporate offices. Each annex focuses on a single category of item, such as cosplay costumes or doujinshi, with several annexes once being independent stores that were acquired by the company. Artist Takashi Murakami operates several stores in Nakano Broadway, including the gallery Hidari Zingaro, the caf√© Bar Zingaro, and the souvenir store Tonari No Zingaro. Other notable stores at Nakano Broadway include a branch of the used CD and DVD chain Fujiya Avic, and Taco Ch√©, an independent alternative manga store. The mall is surrounded by a sprawl of pedestrian side streets that house numerous low-rise shops, boutiques, and izakayas. Sun Mall, a glass-covered shotengai (shopping arcade), connects the mall to Nakano Station. Transportation access Nakano Broadway is served by Nakano Station, which connects to the JR Ch≈´≈ç (Rapid) and Ch≈´≈ç-S≈çbu lines, and the Tokyo Metro T≈çzai Line.

She graduated in Chennai from Meenakshi College, Kodambakkam with English literature as her main stream. Mahathi married a surgeon in 2008; the couple have a child. career Mahathi started identifying Classical Ragas at the tender age of 1 ¬Ω years. This talent was identified by the parents during her father's concert at a temple in Palakad. Her parents nurtured her talent by teaching her more and more Ragas. She was able to identify about 75 Carnatic Ragas at the age of 3. To test her talents, her father used to mix up Carnatic Swaras but Mahathi did not hesitate to identify the exact swaras of the Ragas. When she was 3 yrs years old she came to Chennai with her mother for the December Music Season (1988). At the Concert of Mandolin U. Shrinivas at the Mylapore Fine Arts, on December 25, Mahathi, sitting on her mother's lap kept identifying the Ragas played by the musicians on stage. The Secretary of the Sabha, who was sitting next to her mother arranged for a live demonstration of the child's talents, soon after the main item of the concert got over. Mahathi, without the slightest hesitation identified all the Ragas and enthralled the audience. This incident appeared in all the leading news papers at that time. Mahathi underwent her initial musical training from her parents and from Deepa Gayatri of Trivandrum. When Mahathi's family moved to Trichur, she was put under the guidance of Sri. Mangad. K.

It runs from a junction at Chalfont & Latimer station on the Metropolitan line for 3.89 miles (6.26 km) northwest to Chesham. The line was built as part of Edward Watkin's scheme to turn his Metropolitan Railway (MR) into a direct rail route between London and Manchester, and it was envisaged initially that a station outside Chesham would be an intermediate stop on a through route running north to connect with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Deteriorating relations between the MR and LNWR led to the MR instead expanding to the northwest via Aylesbury, and the scheme to connect with the LNWR was abandoned. By this time much of the land needed for the section of line as far as Chesham had been bought. As Chesham was at the time the only significant town near the MR's new route, it was decided to build the route only as far as Chesham, and to complete the connection with the LNWR at a future date if it proved desirable. Local residents were unhappy at the proposed station site outside Chesham, and a public subscription raised the necessary additional funds to extend the railway into the centre of the town. The Chesham branch opened in 1889. While construction of the Chesham line was underway, the Metropolitan Railway was also expanding to the northwest, and in 1892 the extension to Aylesbury and on to Verney Junction opened. Most trains on the branch line were operating as a shuttle service between Chesham and the main line at Little Chalfont rather than as through trains to London. The opening in 1899 of the Great Central Railway at Marylebone station, Edward Watkin's connection between London and Manchester, as well as the highly successful Metro-land campaign encouraging Londoners to move to the rural areas served by the railway, led to an increase in traffic in the area, although the Chesham branch was less affected by development than most other areas served by the railway. In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership and became the Metropolitan line of the London Underground. London Underground aimed to concentrate on their core business of passenger transport in London, and saw the rural and freight lines in Buckinghamshire as an expensive anomaly. The day-to-day operation of the Chesham branch was transferred to the London and North Eastern Railway, although London Transport retained control. In 1960 the line was electrified, and from 1962 on was operated by London Underground A Stock trains. In the 1970s and 1980s decaying infrastructure and the withdrawal of subsidies brought the future of the line into doubt. As one of its last acts the Greater London Council paid for the replacement of two bridges on the line, allowing operations to continue. The centenary of the line in 1989 saw a renewal of interest and an upgrading of the trains between London Marylebone station and Chalfont & Latimer made commuting more practical, and usage of the line stabilised. The introduction of London Underground S Stock in 2010 led to the replacement of the shuttle service with half-hourly through trains to and from London. Background The English county of Buckinghamshire is bisected by the Chiltern Hills, which rise sharply and cross the county from northeast to southwest. Although the fertile soil and good drainage of the Chilterns provides ideal conditions for farming, the steep hills historically made travelling difficult. Few sizeable settlements developed in Buckinghamshire, and what roads existed were of poor quality. The county town of Aylesbury, immediately north of the Chilterns and from the City of London, was an important agricultural centre. As London grew, the significance of Buckinghamshire as a provider of food increased, particularly following the development of the Aylesbury duck in the 18th century. Large numbers of horses, cattle and Aylesbury ducks were herded along the roads to London's huge livestock market at Smithfield. The strain placed on the roads by bulk livestock movements led to the introduction of a network of high quality toll roads in the area in the 18th century. The roads crossing the Chilterns followed the valley of the River Misbourne through Amersham or the River Bulbourne through Berkhamsted. These roads greatly improved travel in the area, reducing the journey time from Aylesbury to Oxford or London to a single day. Between 1793 and 1800 the Grand Junction Canal was built, connecting London to the Midlands. The canal followed the course of the River Bulbourne through the Chilterns, and included a branch to Aylesbury. For the first time the coal and industrial products of northern England and London could be cheaply supplied to Buckinghamshire, and grain and timber from Buckinghamshire's farms could easily be shipped to market. The route taken by the Grand Junction Canal ran through the east of the county, leaving the Chiltern towns of southern Buckinghamshire isolated. When Robert Stephenson's London and Birmingham Railway opened in 1838 it paralleled the route of the canal through Buckinghamshire. Although the short 1839 Aylesbury Railway linked Aylesbury to the London and Birmingham Railway, the rest of central Buckinghamshire remained unconnected to the railway and canal networks. Early Chesham railway schemes alt= The Chiltern market town of Chesham had historically been an important manufacturing centre. In 1853 the town held three flour mills, three sawmills, three breweries, two paper mills and a silk mill, while of the town's 6,000 inhabitants 30 were recognised as master manufacturers. However, the local economy suffered badly from a lack of connections to the new transport networks. In the 1840s coal cost almost three times more to buy in Chesham than to buy in Berkhamsted, and it took over 2 hours for passengers to travel by road from Chesham to the most convenient railway station at Watford. Between 1845, the height of the railway bubble, and the 1880s numerous schemes were put forward for railways to Chesham. The most significant was an 1845 scheme for an orbital railway bypassing London to connect the railways entering London from the north, west and south; this route was to pass through Chesham. The scheme was abandoned, as was an 1853 proposal by railway entrepreneur and former Member of Parliament for Buckingham Harry Verney for a railway line from Watford to Wendover via Rickmansworth and Amersham (around two miles (3 km) from Chesham). Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury, whose Watford and Rickmansworth Railway had opened in 1862, proposed extensions from Rickmansworth to Chesham and Aylesbury, but failed to attract funding and abandoned the scheme. To the north of Chesham, the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) promoted a railway link between the Great Northern Railway station at Harpenden and the LNWR's station at Boxmoor, which would run on to terminate at Chesham. The LNWR baulked at the cost of the earthworks necessary to reach Chesham and the southern stage of the proposal was abandoned; the line between Harpenden and Boxmoor eventually opened in 1877. (The Harpenden‚ÄìBoxmoor section was never completed; trains to Boxmoor terminated nearby at Heath Park Halt, and passengers to and from Boxmoor had to complete their journey by horse or horse-drawn bus.) In 1887 a tramway was proposed, which was to run through the streets of Chesham and on to Boxmoor, but the proposal was abandoned owing to a lack of funds and opposition from the operators of toll roads around Boxmoor. Metropolitan Railway Chiltern schemes In 1837 Euston railway station opened, the first railway station connecting London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London itself, and thus the station was built on what was then the northern boundary of the city. Other main line termini north of London soon followed at Paddington (1838), Bishopsgate (1840), Fenchurch Street (1841), King's Cross (1852) and St Pancras (1868). All were built outside the built-up area of the city, making them inconvenient to reach. Charles Pearson (1793‚Äì1862) had proposed the idea of an underground railway connecting the City of London with the relatively distant London main line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 to promote the scheme he commissioned the first ever traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City of London, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 travelled in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes. Despite concerns about vibrations causing subsidence of nearby buildings, the problems of compensating the many thousands of people whose homes were destroyed during the digging of the tunnel, and fears that the tunnelling might accidentally break through into Hell, construction began in 1860. The new railway was built beneath the existing New Road, running from the Great Western Railway's terminus at Paddington to Farringdon and the meat market of Smithfield. On 9 January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway. The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its own services and acquiring other local railways in the areas north and west of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819‚Äì1901) was appointed as the Metropolitan Railway's Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he had a vision of unifying a string of railway companies to create a single route running from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin entered negotiations to take control of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and a section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway running north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury to join the existing lines and create a direct route from London to the north of England. He also proposed to extend a short rail branch which ran from the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway to the small town of Brill, known as the Brill Tramway, southwest to Oxford, and thus create a through route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London at this time were poor, and although still an extremely roundabout route, had the scheme been completed it would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford upon Avon. The Duke of Buckingham, chairman of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and owner of the Brill Tramway, was enthusiastic, and authorisation for the scheme was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm of Watkin and the Duke, and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did, however, obtain consent to extend the MR to Harrow, roughly northwest of London, an extension which opened in 1880. The Harrow line was further extended to Rickmansworth in 1887. Rickmansworth at this time was a small town with a population of only 1,800; to generate passenger traffic for the new station, a horse bus service between Chesham and Rickmansworth opened on 1 September 1887. 1885 LNWR junction scheme alt= Watkin continued to harbour ambitions of linking his railway companies in the north and south of England, and while the construction of the Rickmansworth extension was underway planned two possible routes north from Rickmansworth across the Chilterns. One proposal envisaged the MR taking over or reaching agreement with the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, building a link between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury, and running over the A&B;'s line to the north. The A&B; had close relations with the Great Western Railway, with whom they shared a station at Aylesbury. Watkin felt it possible that the A&B; would reach agreement with the GWR instead and not cooperate with the MR. In anticipation of the A&B; refusing to cooperate, a tentative agreement was reached with the London and North Western Railway, with whom Watkin was on good terms, for the MR to build a route via Chesham to connect to LNWR mainline. This scheme would provide the LNWR with an alternative route into London when necessary, while providing Watkin with his long-sought connection to the north. The land required for an intermediate station near Chalfont St Giles and a line between there and a site outside Chesham was purchased. Agreement was reached with the LNWR that the costs of building the line would be shared equally by the MR and LNWR in return for the LNWR having running rights to Rickmansworth, and an Act of Parliament authorising the extension was obtained in 1885. After the Act of Parliament had been granted, membership of the board of the LNWR changed, and they abandoned their support for the extension. By this time, the MR had bought most of the land between Rickmansworth and Chesham required for that section of the route. 1888 Aylesbury extension scheme alt= With relations between the MR and the LNWR deteriorating, Watkin turned his attention to the proposal to link to Aylesbury. Negotiations between the A&B; and the GWR had broken down, and Watkin seized an opportunity to agree running rights over the A&B;'s route north from Aylesbury, taking over the line completely in 1891. In 1888 work began on the extension to Aylesbury. While the route to the LNWR via Chesham had been abandoned, much of the land needed for the section south of Chesham had already been bought. As Chesham, with a population in 1882 of 6,500, was the most significant town in the area through which the MR was building, the MR decided to build the section of line between Chalfont and Chesham as a branch line despite Chesham no longer being on the proposed through route to the north. The planned route to the LNWR would have passed to the east of Chesham, and the proposed site of the station was in Millfields, southwest of the town. (Although the extension to the LNWR was abandoned, the MR continued to buy land between Chesham and Tring for some years afterwards, in anticipation of the scheme being revived.) Although work had begun on the Millfields station, including the completion of the station hotel (now the Unicorn pub), the population of Chesham were unhappy at the station being built such a distance from the town. With the extension to meet the LNWR abandoned the railway no longer needed to curve away from the town, and a public subscription raised ¬£2,000 fund a 71-chain (1,562-yd; 1,428 m) extension to a site near the town centre. Construction of the branch to Chesham began in late 1887. Construction and opening alt= The extensions from Rickmansworth to Aylesbury and Chesham were designed by Charles Liddell and built by contractor James Firbank. Rather than follow the valley of the River Chess, which would have been the most convenient route to Chesham, the route out of Rickmansworth was intentionally built on higher ground to reduce the steep climb over the Chilterns towards Aylesbury, and thus rose steadily from Rickmansworth to a hilltop station at Amersham. At Chalfont Road station (renamed Chalfont & Latimer in 1915) the line to Chesham split from the line to Aylesbury. With a total length of 3 miles 56 chains (3 mi 1,232 yd; 5,955 m), the single-track Chesham branch ran alongside the Aylesbury line for a short distance, before curving down the slope of the Chess Valley at a gradient of around 1 in 66. Chalk from the railway's cutting along the Chess Valley was used to build an embankment to bring the railway into the town centre. Bridging the watercress beds of the Chess Valley proved problematic, and the cost of the line exceeded its estimate. Additional costs were incurred by the laying of temporary track in early 1889 to allow the directors of the MR a trial trip along the route. On 15 May 1889 a demonstration train comprising two carriages and two locomotives ran along the newly completed line from Chesham to Rickmansworth, carrying the subscribers who had funded the extension and representatives of the local authorities and School Boards covering the areas through which the new line ran. (As no Metropolitan Railway train had yet run through to Chesham on the finished line, the train from Chesham to Rickmansworth was drawn by two locomotives belonging to the contractors who had built the line, rather than by MR engines. A third engine ran ahead of the demonstration train to act as a pilot.) A second train carried the directors of the Metropolitan Railway from London to Rickmansworth, collected those passengers who had ridden the demonstration train from Chesham to Rickmansworth, and continued to Chesham. As the line had not yet formally been approved for opening by the Railway Inspectorate, the MR requested that the local authorities not celebrate the event. However, public interest was high and schools closed for the day. Large crowds gathered around the station and along the line, and a banner reading \\"Long looked for, come at last\\" was hung across Chesham station. As the train pulled into Chesham, it was greeted by celebratory gunfire as it drew into the town, and a band at the station played See the Conquering Hero Comes. The party alighted at the newly built Chesham goods depot, which had been decorated as a banqueting hall for the occasion, and an opening ceremony was conducted outside by Edward Watkin and local dignitary and railway financier Ferdinand de Rothschild before the group entered the goods depot for a celebratory meal. Watkin gave a speech recollecting George Stephenson's desire, fifty years earlier, to see the first mainline railway built along the route now being taken by the Metropolitan Railway, joked that he hoped the easy access to London would not lead to the rural nature of the area being displaced by \\"a sudden influx of cockneys\\", and spoke of his desire to see the connection northwards to the LNWR completed. The line was formally inspected by the Railway Inspectorate on 1 July 1889, and the first official service on the line left Chesham for London's Baker Street at 6.55 am on 8 July 1889. Throughout the day large crowds flocked to Chesham station to watch the trains, and the arrival and departure of each train at Chesham was greeted with peals of the bells of St. Mary's Church. Over the course of the day 1,500 passengers travelled on the line, and 4,300 used the line in its first week of operations. Following the opening of the line, 17 trains per weekday ran in each direction at intervals of one hour from around 7 am to around 11 pm. The initial trains were drawn by Metropolitan Railway A and B Class locomotives. Most trains stopped at all stations, but a fast trains each morning ran between Chesham and Baker Street, taking 50 minutes from start to finish. On Sundays, trains again ran at hourly intervals, but only 12 trains per day ran and there was a three-hour gap in services in the morning to allow the railway's staff to attend church. The opening of the railway dramatically ended Chesham's isolation. Commuting to London became possible for the first time, as did affordable excursions to the seaside resorts on the south and east coasts. The products of the area's industries and farms could for the first time be shipped cheaply to the markets of London, and London newspapers arrived each morning at 7.28 am, in time for delivery. Stations alt=Long low single storey brick building The station at Chalfont Road was built with almost all facilities on the up side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, was on the other side of the tracks, most passengers travelling to and from the station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London‚ÄìAylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged to push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre. The station was renamed \\"Chalfont & Latimer\\" in 1915, although station signage was inconsistent and on absorption by London Transport in 1933 its roundel signs read simply \\"Chalfont\\". Increased passenger numbers strained the station's minimal facilities, and it was eventually redeveloped with extended shelters and improved waiting rooms in 1927. The platforms were extended during the electrification works of 1957‚Äì60. alt=single storey yellow brick building The Metropolitan Railway Act 1885 had given Watkin permission to extend the line from Chesham to connect with the LNWR at Tring. Thus, although it was the terminus of the line, Chesham station was designed with a revival of the LNWR extension scheme in mind. The small station building was set to one side of the tracks to allow for a possible extension onwards. The station had a single platform, with a run-around loop and turntable alongside, together with a coaling station and water tank. The station was lit by gas light until 1925; the local gas works, which consumed around 5,000 tons of coal each year, threatened to withdraw their coal traffic from the line if the station were fitted with electric lighting. While Chalfont Road station initially served a sparsely populated rural area (the village of Little Chalfont had not yet grown around the station), Chesham station was busy, and at the time of its opening had a full staff of a stationmaster, two ticket inspectors, two clerks, two porters and two collectors. Chesham also had extensive goods facilities, particularly for coal; the goods yard was initially equipped with a mobile 5-ton crane, replaced by a fixed 8-ton crane between 1898‚Äì1900. The outward transport of watercress, a major local industry, also generated significant traffic. During the electrification of the line in 1957‚Äì60 the station was equipped with a bay platform for passenger trains, to allow it to accommodate both through services to and from Baker Street and the Chalfont & Latimer‚ÄìChesham shuttle simultaneously. This bay platform was closed on 29 November 1970 and is now a garden. alt=Railway station platform with a garden on one side and railway tracks on the other The Metropolitan Railway's passenger coaches, dating from 1870 and designed for underground use within London, were not fitted with heating until 1895. Consequently, both stations were also equipped with equipment for heating footwarmers, which would be distributed to passengers during cold weather. Opening of the Aylesbury line As developments on the line from Chalfont Road to Chesham took place, progress continued on the cross-Chiltern link between Chalfont and Aylesbury. On 1 September 1892 work was completed as far as a temporary station south of Aylesbury. (The connection with the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway‚Äîabsorbed by the Metropolitan Railway in 1891‚Äîwas completed in late 1893. From 1 January 1894 MR trains used the A&BR;'s Aylesbury station, and the temporary station was abandoned.) The line to Chesham became a branch line, generally operated by a shuttle service between Chalfont Road and Chesham, although some trains at peak periods continued to run between London and Chesham. The MR had bought a number of Metropolitan Railway C Class locomotives to replace the ageing A and B class engines, but these performed poorly on the London-Aylesbury line and were soon replaced by the Metropolitan Railway D Class. As a consequence, the C class engines were often used on the Chesham shuttle services. While construction of the Chesham and Aylesbury lines was underway Watkin continued to press for the extension from Chesham to the LNWR, as did prominent manufacturers in Chesham. However, construction of the extensions had left the MR seriously exposed financially, forcing the board to cut dividends in July 1889. At a Special General Meeting on 12 February 1890 matters came to a head. Shareholders endorsed the decision to acquire the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and authorised the MR to acquire the moribund Brill Tramway, which connected with the A&BR; at Quainton Road station, but blocked the expensive extension beyond Chesham, as well as Watkin's proposed extension to Moreton Pinkney to the north. (Watkin's Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway was refused consent at the time to build south to connect with the MR at Moreton Pinkney, which would have rendered the Moreton Pinkney branch an inevitably loss-making branch line serving a very lightly populated area. Watkin was determined to build this section as a vital segment in his vision of a London‚ÄìManchester railway, and proposed that if the MR would not build this section, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway would build the line themselves and lease it to the MR. The MR board refused to have anything to do with the scheme. Moreton Pinkney was eventually served by Watkin's railway network in 1899 as Culworth railway station on the Great Central Railway.) In 1894 Edward Watkin suffered a stroke. Although he nominally remained a director of his railway companies, he resigned all his railway chairmanships and his influence was effectively ended. With the connection at Aylesbury complete, the Metropolitan Railway reached northwest of London, and his planned route between London and northern England was almost complete. Watkin's Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway continued to build southwards from its southernmost point at Annesley, reaching Quainton Road station on the former A&BR; in 1899 and completing the north‚Äìsouth link, the Great Central Railway (GCR), in time for Watkin to see his vision completed before his death in 1901. Relations with the Great Central Railway alt= After Watkin's retirement from management, relations between the MR and GCR deteriorated rapidly over shared use of Baker Street station and the congested route into London, and soon broke down completely. On 30 July 1898 John Bell, General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway, took control of the Quainton Road signal box himself and refused to allow a GCR train onto MR-owned tracks on the grounds that it was scheduled to take the Great Western rather than the Metropolitan route south of Aylesbury, while on one occasion in 1901 King Edward VII was travelling home after visiting a friend in Wendover; the MR signalman allowed a slow goods train to run in front of the royal train, causing the King to arrive late back in London. The MR management also refused the GCR permission to install points to connect their engine shed at Aylesbury to the railway line, on the grounds that the land for the shed had been bought clandestinely. Eventually a parallel set of tracks was built for the GCR between Harrow and London, running alongside the MR to a separate terminus at Marylebone, a short distance from Baker Street. The GCR continued to share the less-congested section between Quainton Road and Harrow‚Äîincluding Chalfont Road station‚Äîwith the MR. With the hostile Metropolitan Railway controlling the GCR's only approach to London through Quainton Road and Aylesbury, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway to create a second route into London which bypassed all MR property. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began construction of a new line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR's existing station at Princes Risborough to the new Great Central line. The line ran from Princes Risborough north to meet the Great Central at Grendon Underwood, about three miles (5 km) north of Quainton Road, thus bypassing Quainton Road altogether. (subscription required) Although formally an independent company, in practice the new line was operated as a part of the Great Central Railway. The new route opened in 1906, and a substantial part of the GCR's traffic to and from London was diverted onto the Alternative Route, damaging the profitability of the MR's railway operations. The MR management were horrified at the potential loss of income and restarted negotiations with the GCR, and a 1906 agreement meant that GCR traffic was shared between the old and new routes. Management of the shared route north of Harrow alternated every five years between the MR and GCR. (A proposed link between Marylebone and the sub-surface section of the Metropolitan Railway, which would have allowed GCR trains to run across London via the MR-controlled Thames Tunnel and on to the south coast, was abandoned.) The sharing arrangement meant through trains running from Chesham to Marylebone, as well as the MR terminus at Baker Street, and that the branch was worked by GCR trains as well as the ageing MR rolling stock. Chesham and Metro-land In 1903 Robert Selbie was appointed Secretary of the Metropolitan Railway, working on the electrification of the London sections of the line; by 1905 the route was electrified as far as Harrow, although the sections north of Harrow, including the Chesham branch, continued to be worked by steam power. In 1908 he was appointed General Manager, a position he was to hold until 1930. Selbie realised that Watkin's schemes and the expensive electrification project had left the company with major financial liabilities, and that the MR's core business in central London would come under significant pressure as the use of automobiles increased and as the new Underground Electric Railways of London tube lines improved their services. Selbie set out to reshape the MR as a feeder route for goods and passengers into London. New branches to Uxbridge, Watford and Stanmore were built, and from 1915 the extremely effective Metro-land advertising campaign began, promoting the lightly developed areas along the MR's routes as ideal for commuting to London. Watkin's expansionist schemes had led to the acquisition of huge tracts of near-worthless land in the Buckinghamshire countryside around the MR's routes, as the MR had tried to take control of as much land as possible along every possible route between London and Manchester. With the GCR complete it was no longer necessary for the MR to keep these lands clear for potential railway use, and Selbie began development on a massive scale. By 1939 over 4,600 houses had been built by the MR alone, and entire new towns had grown around the MR's stations between Harrow and Aylesbury. This development not only generated huge amounts of money from property development, but vastly increased use of the railway for passenger and goods traffic. The MR's Baker Street terminus was also redeveloped and a block of 180 luxury apartments known as Chiltern Court was built above the station. With the profits generated, the line was further electrified to Rickmansworth. Again, the Chesham branch was not electrified and remained operated by steam locomotives; the electric locomotives would be uncoupled from their trains at Rickmansworth and a steam locomotive would haul the train to Chesham. By this time, the steam sections of the route were generally worked by the powerful Metropolitan Railway H Class engines, capable of speeds of up to . alt=Purple steam locomotive Selbie also made a conscious effort to attract the wealthy classes to the railway. Stations such as Sandy Lodge (now Moor Park) were built to serve golf courses and hunts along the route, and horse-vans were provided at stations serving hunts and point to points. Two Pullman cars were introduced in 1909 on selected services between the City of London and Chesham, Aylesbury and Verney Junction for the benefit of businessmen travelling to work and theatregoers returning from London. Despite the huge population growth in southern Buckinghamshire caused by the railway, Chesham remained relatively unaffected by development. Although there was extensive development in Chesham Bois, roughly halfway between Chesham and Amersham, between 1889 and 1925 the population of Chesham itself grew by less than 2,000, and between 1925 and 1935‚Äîthe peak of the Metro-land boom‚Äîby only 225. Between 1921 and 1928 the season ticket revenue from Amersham and Chalfont & Latimer stations rose by 134%; that from Chesham by only 6.7%. Although the MR owned large tracts of land around Chesham, bought in anticipation of a revival of the LNWR connection scheme, Selbie chose not to build a housing estate on the site, instead selling much of it to the local council. By this time, service on the Chesham branch was of a relatively poor quality. Improvements to the central London section and the prioritisation of the Aylesbury line had led to ageing surplus stock often being used on the Chesham branch, and the partial electrification caused delays at Rickmansworth as steam locomotives were coupled and uncoupled. As the branch was mainly operated as a shuttle service passengers to and from Chesham were obliged to wait at Chalfont & Latimer station. This had been built to serve a lightly populated area, but the Metro-land development had caused a much larger number of users than it had been designed for, and it had few waiting facilities, poor lighting, inadequate shelter, and dirty toilets. As Amersham grew, more and more of the trains which had previously run direct from London to Chesham instead ran to Amersham, causing further crowding as passengers waited for the shuttle service at Chalfont & Latimer. Improving road transport caused an increasing number of commuters to abandon the Chesham line, which in turn prompted the MR to further reduce passenger services. 1909 accidents Although the short line to Chesham generally had a good safety record, despite its sharp curves and relatively steep gradient, it suffered two significant accidents in this period. On 19 August 1909 the A class engine hauling the 7.53 am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from each end of the branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6 November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on the blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded. London Transport Robert Selbie had fought vigorously for the independence of the Metropolitan Railway, and had successfully preserved the MR's independence during the grouping of 1923, which had merged almost all of Britain's railways into four companies. However, on 17 May 1930 he died suddenly, and his successors acceded to pressure from the Ministry of Transport to merge with London's other underground railways. On 1 July 1933 the merger brought all of London's underground railways aside from the short Waterloo & City Railway, under public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The Metropolitan Railway became the Metropolitan line of the London Underground. Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services, and to concentrate on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. In particular, he saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes. On 30 November 1935 the last train ran on the Brill Tramway between Brill and Quainton Road, and at the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the Tramway to the main line were ceremonially severed. The former Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway between Quainton Road and Verney Junction was closed to passengers on 6 July 1936, and London Transport services north of Aylesbury were withdrawn. London and North Eastern Railway operation The route to Aylesbury and the Chesham branch survived Pick's cutbacks to the Metropolitan line, but the former Metropolitan Railway's routes in Buckinghamshire, and in particular the Chesham line, were increasingly regarded as an expensive anomaly by London Transport. After 1937 the operation of all steam services north of Rickmansworth was passed to the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER). The LNER retained Metropolitan Railway E Class locomotives to work the Chesham branch, but other steam services on the former MR were operated by LNER N5 Class locomotives. alt=Large purple steam locomotive The LNER did not want to take full responsibility for the line, and although they provided the services, ownership remained with the LPTB. In 1935 the LPTB, seeking to abandon steam power as much as possible, drew up a scheme to include electrification of the Amersham line as part of the New Works Programme. It was not planned to electrify the Chesham branch; instead, a diesel-powered GWR railcar was borrowed from the GWR for trials on the branch. Although the railcar performed well on the curves and slopes of the branch, the railcar had a capacity for only 70 passengers and was only able to haul light amounts of goods. The LPTB commissioned its own, larger, railcar design, but by the end of 1936, it decided instead to electrify the Chesham branch, and the railcar schemes were abandoned. The LPTB's plan envisaged electric trains splitting at Chalfont & Latimer, with half of each train continuing to Amersham and half to Chesham. alt=Long wooden railway carriage Although some preparatory work was carried out, the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898. Nationalisation On 1 January 1948, almost all railways in Britain‚Äîincluding the London Transport Passenger Board and the London and North Eastern Railway‚Äîwere nationalised under the Transport Act 1947. The LPTB became the London Transport Executive (LT), and the LNER became a part of British Railways. In the Greater London Plan of 1944 Sir Patrick Abercrombie had strongly recommended a halt to further modern development in Chesham and along the Chess Valley to preserve the sensitive local environment, and there was thus little prospect for growth in passenger numbers on the branch. For the first decade after nationalisation services to Chesham continued much as before, although the unification of the mainline companies meant a wider variety of locomotives operating services on the branch. For two weeks from 13 October 1952 LT experimented with a three-car lightweight diesel train on the route, but the train used had difficulty negotiating the line's sharp bends and the branch reverted to steam operations. A alt=Large dark steam locomotive at a railway station platform, with a steep earth bank behind it By the mid-1950s, British Railways had begun to operate in regional units, and responsibility for services on the former Great Central routes in the Chilterns was transferred to the London Midland Region. Services on the branch were generally hauled by LMS Ivatt Class locomotives, although passenger trains continued to use the 1898 Ashbury cars. British Railways continued to operate goods services on the branch, although these declined steadily owing to competition from road haulage to the point at which coal deliveries were the only significant business. By now the pre-war electrification scheme had been revived. In 1957 electrification between Rickmansworth and Amersham and Chesham began. Chalfont & Latimer's platforms were extended and a second platform was opened at Chesham on 3 July 1960 to prevent through operations to and from Baker Street from interfering with the Chesham‚ÄìChalfont & Latimer shuttle. An electric service using London Underground T Stock began operations between Chesham and Chalfont & Latimer on 16 August 1960, with former MR electric locomotives hauling the through trains to and from London. A steam locomotive was kept on standby in the new second platform at Chesham, in case of a failure of the electric trains. From June 1962 both the T Stock and the locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by the newly introduced London Underground A Stock. alt=Two electric multiple unit trains with large windows The last scheduled London Transport steam passenger train on the branch left Chesham at 12.11 am on 12 September 1960. 1,917 passengers used the line that day, in comparison with a typical Sunday usage of around 100. Earlier on 11 September descendants of the Chesham residents who had attended Watkin's original meeting to promote the railway, along with 86-year-old Albert Wilcox who had been present at the opening of the line, rode the steam shuttle to Chalfont & Latimer and back, and attended a ceremony in Chesham's Council Chamber. (Although the 12.11 am service from Chesham on 12 September 1960 was the last scheduled London Transport steam service to use the line, a steam train left Marylebone for Chesham each morning at 3.55 am to deliver newspapers, returning as the first passenger train from Chesham at 5.58 am. This journey to Marylebone was open to the public but was unadvertised and did not appear in published timetables. This arrangement continued to be operated by steam locomotive until 18 June 1962.) The Ashbury passenger cars, which by now had each covered around , were retired from service. The last steam- powered passenger services on the remaining non-electrified section between Amersham and Aylesbury ran on 9 September 1961. The line between Amersham and Aylesbury was handed over to British Rail, leaving Chesham as the westernmost point of the London Underground network. The goods yard at Chesham was closed in 1966, and a train hauled by a former GWR 5700 Class locomotive removed the track from the goods yard, the last steam service to use the line. On 17 October 1967 the newspaper train service and its return journey to Marylebone, by this time worked by a British Rail diesel multiple unit, was abandoned, leaving the branch exclusively operated by London Transport trains. Closure proposals Although LT had hoped that the electrification would boost revenue, the Chesham branch generated little income. In a period of recession LT was reluctant to continue subsidising a little-used branch line some distance outside its core area. Fares were drastically increased in 1970, leaving a monthly season ticket from Chesham to Baker Street costing ¬£43 (about ¬£ in ). London Transport considered closing the branch, but it survived thanks to subsidies from the Ministry of Transport, Buckinghamshire County Council and the Greater London Council. Sunday services on the branch were abolished as a cost-cutting measure, although this decision was reversed following protests. In 1982 the future of the Chesham line came into serious question, as it became clear that the two bridges carrying the line into Chesham were deteriorating badly and that, unless the bridges were replaced, the branch could not continue to operate after 1986. By this time rail services in Buckinghamshire had been drastically cut back under the Beeching Axe mass rail closure programme of the 1960s. The last passenger trains north of Aylesbury had run on 5 September 1966, The Greater London Council was scheduled for abolition, bringing their subsidy of the Chesham branch to an end. Buckinghamshire County Council was unwilling to pay for replacing the bridges, proposing instead that the station be relocated to the original proposed station site of the 1880s on the south side of the bridges. Safety concerns had led to a speed limit of over the bridges, and the line appeared certain to be closed. Revival Although no part of the Chesham branch was in Greater London, the Greater London Council, as one of its last acts, granted ¬£1,180,000 to replace the bridges. New bridges were built alongside the existing bridges to minimise disruption, and were rolled into place on 24 March 1986 and 14 April 1986. In 1989 the centenary of the branch saw a revival of interest in the line. Over the weekends of 1‚Äì2 and 8‚Äì9 July special services were run between Watford and Chesham, using two preserved Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives and a former MR electric locomotive. The service was a great success, with over 9,000 people travelling on the trains and large numbers of people travelling to the area to watch the trains. The success prompted LT to repeat the Steam on the Met event annually until 2000, although often running to Amersham rather than Chesham. In the early 1990s the number of passengers using the branch stabilised at about 800 people each weekday. In 2009 the Chesham branch saw 427,000 journeys each year. The proposal to close the Aylesbury‚ÄìMarylebone route was dropped, and instead the line was upgraded and equipped with fast British Rail Class 165 trains in the early 1990s. These reduced the travel time between Chalfont & Latimer and Marylebone to 33 minutes, increasing usage of the line as a commuter route. The Chesham branch was proposed as a terminus for the original Crossrail scheme, which would have seen Crossrail trains running from Paddington to serve the stations between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury and the Chesham branch, allowing London Transport to withdraw from Buckinghamshire and cut the Metropolitan line back to serve only the branches to Watford and Uxbridge. The bill proposing the scheme was defeated in Parliament and abandoned in 1995, and the revived scheme authorised by the Crossrail Act 2008 did not include the branches to Aylesbury and Chesham. By this time the little-used Central line branch from Epping to Ongar had closed, with the last services running on 30 September 1994, leaving Chesham‚Äîalready the westernmost point of the London Underground network since 1961's withdrawal from Aylesbury‚Äîas the northernmost point on the London Underground. By the time London Underground operations were transferred to the newly created Transport for London (TfL) in 2000, the A Stock trains were already 40 years old. The C Stock trains used on the Circle line, Hammersmith & City line and sections of the District line and the D Stock used on the remainder of the District line were also ageing, and no plans were in place for their replacement. Following lengthy and expensive negotiations, an order was placed in 2003 with Bombardier Transportation for a fleet of new trains to take over all operations on the Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City and District lines. Restoration of full through service The eight-car configuration of the S Stock design includes open connections between the passenger cars, and thus cannot be split into shorter four-car trains capable of fitting into the bay platform at Chalfont & Latimer station. Consequently, in 2008 TfL announced that the shuttle service was to be abandoned. Instead, the long-standing Metropolitan line service of four trains per hour to and from Amersham was to be reduced to two, with the other two services running as through trains between Aldgate and Chesham.

He is considered one of the most important twentieth-century writers of Catalonia.  Biography = Towards the political commitment  He was born in 1899, the member of an outstanding family of the industrial bourgeoisie of Sabadell. He was the fourth of eleven brothers; he was the only survivor. He took the pseudonym with which he would sign his poetic work: Pere Quart. He studied Law. In year 1919, he formed the Group of Sabadell with the novelist Francesc Trabal and the poet Armand Obiols. In this group the influence of vanguardism was combined with local humor.  The Civil War and the exile  During the Civil War he engaged politically with the republican side. He was nominated president of the Association of Catalan Writers and leader of Generalitat's Ministry of Culture publications. Moreover, he was co-founder and headleader of Institution of the Catalan Letters publications, and author of the Catalan popular army hymn's letter. All this means a definite break with his bourgeois past and the birth of a strong political, ethical and social commitment. In this context he created \\"Ode to Barcelona\\" (of clear nationalistic and revolutionary trend) and the play \\"The Hunger\\" (La Fam, where the problems of the revolution are brought up). At the end of the war, the Republican Generalitat will order him the task of evacuating all the intellectuals. Finished the war will exile first in France, embark towards Buenos Aires and establish definitively in Santiago of Chile, where he will live for eight years. During the exile, he continued his task of intellectual compromised with his time and his country. He collaborated with \\"Catalonia\\" (edited in Buenos Aires) and directed \\"Germanor\\" (Brothehood) (edited in Chile). He set up the collection \\"The pine of the three branches\\" along Xavier Benguerel.  Resistance and transition  In 1948 Joan Oliver came back to Barcelona, where Franco's regime was characterized by authoritarianism and repression. He was imprisoned for three months in the Model prison of Barcelona. Three years later he received the Prize of the French Republic President in the floral games of Paris, for the translation into Catalan of The Misanthrope by Moli√®re. He translated and adapted works of several authors - for example Anton Chekhov. In 1960 his more emblematic work appeared: Vacances Pagades (Paid Holidays). It is a skeptical work, sarcastic too, where a great appointment with the social and political reality of the country is shown. Oliver makes an acid crictisim to the capitalism, the consumer society and the Franco dictatorship. With the death of the dictator and democracy entry, he was especially displeased with the dominant politicians, denouncing the betrayal that meant the transition. In year 1982 he rejected the Cross of Saint George. He became an uncomfortable character for the politicians, who was necessary to corner. Nothing of all this, however, prevented him from being considered one of the five best Catalan poets of the 20th century. In 1986 he died in Barcelona and was buried in his natal city, Sabadell.  Works  Creator of a very diverse work, his poetry is influenced by realism, with a skeptical tone, and influenced by the effects of the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent family's exile. His narrative style is clearly marked by the irony against all the established conventions.  Plays  As a playwright, Oliver helped to make cracks on the Franco's regime to recover the Catalan theater. His most outstanding works in this area were Primera representaci√≥ [First representation] and Ball robat [Stolen Ball], and D'una drecera [a shortcut] was his attempt to approach to public. * Gaireb√© un acte o Joan, Joana i Joanet, 1929 [Almost an Act: or, Joan, Joana, and Joanet] * Una mena d'orgull, 1931 [A Kind of Pride] * Cataclisme [Cataclismus], 1935 Barcelona.

Life Even while Pieter Bout was well known in his time as demonstrated by his frequent collaborations with prominent Flemish painters and his substantial output, the details of his life are not very well established. He was probably born in Brussels somewhere between 1640 and 1658. It is not known with whom he studied. He became a master in the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1671 but his earliest work is dated 1664 and therefore predates his enrolment in the Guild. He got married on 30 November 1667 in Brussels.Pieter Bout at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Although primary sources do not confirm this, it is believed that from c. 1675 to 1677 Bout worked in Paris where he frequently collaborated with Adriaen Frans Boudewyns, a Flemish painter residing in Paris at the time.Manfred Sellink. \\"Bout, Pieter.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 28 January 2015 Bout returned to Brussels in 1677, where he married a second time on 9 August 1695. He remained active in Brussels for the rest of his career although he probably visited the Dutch Republic and Italy. The date of his death is uncertain with some placing it as early as 1689 and others as late as 1719 (based on the date of a painting the dating of which has given rise to some doubt). Work Seascape Pieter Bout was a very prolific artist who worked in many genres. Most of his works include a landscape element and many are views of cities, villages, ports, beaches or rivers. His views are in the tradition of Jan Brueghel the Younger. They also show similarity to the work of David Teniers the Younger and the landscapes of Brussels landscape painters such as Adriaen Frans Boudewyns, Lucas Achtschellinck and Jacques d'Arthois, for whom he also often painted the staffage. He further painted Italianate landscapes in the manner of Nicolaes Berchem. Some of his work is also similar to that of Pieter Casteels II, a Flemish painter known for his Italianizing landscapes and city views.Petrus Casteels, ‚ÄòGezicht op de Seine in Parijs tijdens een regatta (rechts het Louvre en links de Tour de Nesle)‚Äô, formerly attributed to Pieter Bout, at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His paintings often include lively scenes such as village festivals and people having fun on the ice. Pieter Bout collaborated on a beach view with Lucas Smout who painted the staffage. This work referred to as Harbour and Fish Market (Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Quimper) possibly represents a view of the beach and port of Scheveningen as in its composition and figures it closely resembles Pieter Bout's Selling Fish at the Beach of Scheveningen (Van Ham Auctions, 11 May 2012, Lot 518).Visverkoop op het strand van Scheveningen The Rijksmuseum attributes to Bout a religious painting entitled The Adoration of the Shepherds.The Adoration of the Shepherds at the Rijksmuseum His paintings are lively and the brushwork is precise.

D√©bria M. Brown (26 October 1936 ‚Äì 17 December 2001) was an American operatic mezzo-soprano who had an active international career that spanned five decades. She was part of the first generation of black opera singers to achieve wide success and is viewed as part of an instrumental group of performers who helped break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world. She also worked occasionally as a dramatic actress on the stage and on television.  Education and early career  Born in New Orleans, Brown was the daughter of the Reverend Bennett G. and Eunice Brown. She attended Xavier University of Louisiana (Bachelor of Music, 1958), where she sang Cherubino in the only production Norman Treigle directed, Le nozze di Figaro, in 1957. She later studied with Katherine Dunham in New York City through a scholarship provided by the John Hay Whitney Foundation. In 1958, Brown made her professional opera debut with the New York City Opera in the title role of Georges Bizet's Carmen, opposite her mentor, Treigle, as Escamillo. She returned to the City Opera in 1961, when she created the role of Tituba in the world premiere of Robert Ward's The Crucible, opposite Chester Ludgin. In 1958 she made her Carnegie Hall debut singing the role of Amenofi in the American Opera Society's concert presentation of Gioachino Rossini's Mos√® in Egitto with conductor Arnold Gamson, and Boris Christoff in the name part. International success D√©bria Brown From 1962‚Äì1965, Brown was a member of the Stadttheater Aachen, during which time she appeared as a guest artist at numerous opera houses in Germany. She was then committed to the Staatsoper Stuttgart from 1967‚Äì1970. In 1969, she appeared as Bess in George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess at the Vienna Volksoper. In 1971 and 1974, she made appearances at the Bregenzer Festspiele. In 1972‚Äì1973, she was a member of the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe, In 1992, Brown became a Professor of Voice and Artist in Residence at the University of Houston.\\"She's a big heart and a big talent from Big Easy\\" by Ozzie Roberts, The San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 February 1994 She remained in that position until her death nine years later.

Etymology  Nomadic herdsmen of Turkic origin used to call their herding locations by different names depending on the season. Jens Helmstedt:Yayla life in Anatolia Yazlak, yaylak, g√ºzlek and kƒ±≈ülak referred to herding locations of different seasons of the year. But out of the four, yayla and kƒ±≈üla (with the last letter dropped) are more widespread. Kƒ±≈üla (from kƒ±≈ü meaning winter) refers to relatively warmer places in the plains and yayla refers to mountain slopes where the pasturing is easier during the summer. (see Alpine meadow.) Yaylas were temporary settlements.  Traditional yayla as resort  For nomads, yayla was a part of productive economy. For city dwellers however, yayla is a summer resort. During summers most of Turkey, especially Mediterranean coast is quite hot and people seek cooler places to spend the nights. Traditionally, during summer vacation of schools, the families migrate to yaylas. The householders either stay in the cities or they also make daily trips to yayla if the yayla is close by.  Contemparary yayla culture  In the second half of the 20th century because of two factors, the yayla practice is not as popular as it once used to be. Most people prefer beach tourism instead of yayla and the advance in climatization technology makes the hot summers more endurable. On the other hand, highways have been constructed and modern amenities have been introduced to yaylas which can increase their popularity. In contrast to past practices, now most yaylas are not temporary settlements and in fact some yaylas gain the status of town and even district center.

The release of heat can result in the production of light in the form of either glowing or a flame. Fuels of interest often include organic compounds (especially hydrocarbons) in the gas, liquid or solid phase. The major problem of micro-combustion is the high surface to volume ratio. As the surface to volume ratio increases heat loss to walls of combustor increases which leads to flame quenching. The development of miniaturized products such as microrobots, notebook computers, micro-aerial vehicles and other small scale devices is becoming increasingly important in our daily life. There is a growing interest in developing small scale combustors to power these micro-devices due to their inherent advantages of higher energy density, higher heat and mass transfer coefficients and shorter recharge times compared to electrochemical batteries. The energy density of hydrocarbon fuels is 20-50 times higher than the most advanced Li-ion concept based electrochemical batteries. The concept of the micro-heat engine was proposed by Epstein and Senturia in 1997. Since then, substantial amount of work has been done towards the development and application of such small scale devices to generate power through the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. Micro- combustors are an attractive alternate to batteries as they have large surface area to volume ratio, due to which, significant amount of heat is transferred through the walls which leads to flame quenching. However, the increased rate of heat transfer through solid walls is advantageous in the case of steam reformers used for hydrogen production. B. Khandelwal et al. have experimentally studied the flame stability limits and other characteristics in a two staged micro combustor. They found out that staged combustor leads to higher flame stability limits, in addition to that they also offer higher temperature profiles which would be helpful in utilizing the heat produced by combustion. Maruta et al. have experimentally studied the flame propagation characteristics of premixed methane air mixtures in a 2.0 mm diameter straight quartz channel with a positive wall temperature gradient along the flow direction. This was a simple one-dimensional configuration to study flame stabilization characteristics in microchannels. Other researchers have studied the flame stabilization behavior and combustion performance in a Swiss roll combustor, micro-gas turbine engines, a micro-thermo-photovoltaic system, a free piston knock engine, a micro-tube combustor, radial channel combustors, and in various other types of micro-combustor.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1900 until his defeat in 1906. He died whilst a prospective candidate in the 1918 election and he was replaced by his wife, Alice Theresa Lucas.  Early life  Lucas was the son of Sampson Lucas, of Gloucester Square, London. He was educated privately and then at University College London, after which he went into business, becoming a partner in Lucas, Nicholls and Company, a merchants firm with operations in London, Stockport and Manchester. He was a director of both Allied Insurance and Allied Marine Insurance. He was also an actively involved in the Volunteer Force, serving for 35 years as a member of the Artists Rifles, mostly as an officer. He then became Commander of the Harwich Voluntary Infantry Brigade from 1900 to 1906. He was also a governor of Christ's Hospital and of Guy's Hospital, and a Justice of the Peace for Suffolk, where his country residence Easton Park was located near Wickham Market.  Political career  He unsuccessfully contested the Louth division of Lincolnshire at the 1895 general election, and at the 1900 general election he was elected as MP for Lowestoft, with a majority of over 20% of the votes.Craig, 1885‚Äì1918, page 392 However, at the 1906 election, he was defeated by the Liberal candidate Edward Beauchamp, who won the seat with a 14% majority. Noting the scale of Liberal gains in the election, The Times noted the Lowestoft result as evidence that \\"apparently, no Unionist seat is now secure\\". After his defeat in 1906, Lucas did not stand again in Lowestoft. He unsuccessfully contested the Kennington division of Lambeth at both the January 1910 and December 1910 elections,Craig, 1885‚Äì1918, page 30 and at the 1918 general election he stood again in Kennington. However he died on 11 December 1918, aged 68, after he had already been formally nominated, which caused the election to be delayed in Kennington until his wife, Alice Theresa Lucas could be nominated. Alice was nearly elected and she would have been the only woman MP from the 1918 election. His death, at his London residence in Stornoway House, Cleveland Row, St James's, was due to heart failure brought about by influenza.  Family  In 1887 Lucas married Alice who was a hospital administrator.

They are wide, and usually corrugated to let the user's head move about without the tube pinching at kinks. Each end usually has a screw connection. They may contain a one-way valve to keep the air or gas flowing the right way. According to the expected usage, they may be pure rubber, or rubber reinforced with canvas (outside or embedded) or similar. If the canvas layer is outside (as in the Siebe Gorman Salvus and the IDA71 and some old gasmasks, it protects the rubber from damage from scrapes but makes it harder to wash all the salt off after a saltwater dive. Breathing tubes have to be long enough to connect the apparatus to the diver's head in all attitudes of his head, but should not loop about excessively to cause hydrodynamic drag or risk snagging snag on things, or contain excess dead space. In the IDA71 the looping over-the-shoulders breathing tubes can be tethered down to the diver's shoulders. See also in this image of a modern military rebreather. Some early rebreathers had one breathing tube, which the breathed gas went through both ways: this is called the pendulum system; others have two breathing tubes, with one-way valves keeping the gas flowing the right way.

The Shiluv Yeshiva is unique in that it combines two years of Torah study with the full three years of army service. This is in contrast to students from Hesder Yeshivot, which only serve in the army for a year and a half and complete three and a half years of Torah study. The Yeshiva emphasizes a commitment to rigorous Torah study, intellectual openness, intellectual disagreement and social consciousness. History In 1993, the Kibbutz HaDati (Religious Kibbutz) Movement approached and encouraged Rabbi Shmuel Reiner, then Rabbi of Kibbutz Tirat Zvi, to open a Yeshiva in the north of Israel to complement Kibbutz HaDati's (then) decade old Yeshiva in Ein Zurim. Rabbi Reiner approached his friend Rabbi Yehuda Gilad, then as now, Rabbi of Kibbutz Lavi, to join him. They jointly began to recruit both students and staff. Ma'ale Gilboa was chosen to host the Yeshiva not only because of the natural beauty of surrounding area, but to strengthen the slowly diminishing kibbutz community. In 1994, the Yeshiva opened its doors, and, in addition to the Rashei Yeshiva, it attracted a most dedicated staff of educators, including Rabbi Meir Rubinstein and Rabbi David Bigman, who was then Rosh Yeshiva at Ein Zurim and came back to Ma'ale Gilboa to serve as Rosh Yeshiva. At first, the Yeshiva was hosted in the Kibbutz's Synagogue, but quickly outgrew that. Within several years it moved to its current campus opposite the Kibbutz's old headquarters in the 'Migdal' or 'Tower.' New modern dormitories were built to accommodate the increase in enrollment. Later, the Yeshiva took over the management of the local 'inn'-Margoa BaGilboa. Philosophy of the Yeshiva Yeshivat Maale Gilboa is committed to educating a generation of young students who relate to a pluralistic and democratic Israeli society. The Yeshiva's diverse group of educators emphasize a commitment to rigorous Torah study, intellectual openness, and social consciousness. Based on the belief that Talmidei Chachamim have a responsibility to contribute in all branches of society, the teachers at Ma'ale Gilboa have created a broad program that addresses the needs of the contemporary student. As a Shiluv Yeshiva, Ma'ale Gilboa is dedicated to full involvement in modern Israeli life, and therefore obligates its Israeli students to serve a full 3-year tour of military service.\\"Guide to Israel Schools\\". Yeshiva University Center for the Jewish Future. The three main messages of Yeshivat Ma'ale Gilboa are * Openness to various methods of Torah study including techniques and ideas from the academic world. * Integration of the analytic and spiritual sides of Judaism and Torah study. * Sensitivity to the current issues of Am Yisrael and the State of Israel. Curriculum=Classes There are four classes every day on various topics by a variety of rabbis. Most of the shiurim are in Hebrew. 4-5 shiurim a week are given to the overseas students, usually in English. Classes are offered in Tanakh, philosophy of Halacha, general philosophy, Rambam, Literature, Hassidism, Musar and many other topics. There are over 40 different classes offered throughout the week. Students are encouraged to attend around 6-9 classes per week. These classes are all optional and many second year students opt to learn Talmud with a chevruta instead.\\"Guide to Israel Schools\\". Yeshiva University Center for the Jewish Future. http://www.yu.edu/cjf/israel_yeshivot/page1.aspx?id=15916#tuition Talmud study A major part of the day (and often night) is devoted to the study of Gemara. Gemara instruction endows students with competence in classic yeshiva modes of study and carefully opens doors to new insights provided by complementary academic disciplines in Talmud. =Revadim method= The Yeshiva has adopted the Revadim method of learning Talmud. The Revadim method sees the Oral Tradition as a living legal system and not only as written text. Therefore, \\"one should learn the literature of the Oral Tradition in accordance with the dynamic process through which it was formed.\\".The Society for the Advancement of the Oral Tradition in Israel: Frequently Asked Questions, The page of Talmud we study today is composed of various historical Gersaot or manuscripts, which can be broken down into four stages ‚Äì Mishnah, Tannaitic literature, Amoraic literature and Talmudic literature. Understanding the evolution of these documents and the original intent of their authors leads to a whole new perspective on the study of Talmud. Tanakh study Tanakh is studied in light of the position that: \\"A passage does not depart from its simple meaning\\"The Approach of Classic Jewish Exegetes to Peshat and Derash and Its Implications for the Teaching of Bible Today, or the Peshat. Students acquire the skills and ability to study classical commentary and learn to utilize contemporary literary and linguistic methods for deeper insight into Tanakh. Many students follow a Tanakh Yomi or daily Bible class which finishes learning the entire Tanakh in one year. Second and third-year students are exposed to Biblical Criticism to better prepare them for classes in Biblical Criticism offered in universities. Overseas program Yeshivat Ma'ale Gilboa's overseas program is relatively new, yet attracts both post high school and post college students from the United States, England, Australia and more. The Overseas program is fully integrated into the regular Israeli program, other than several English- language classes a week in addition to the Hebrew-language ones. The Overseas students are housed together with Israeli students. The Yeshiva provides certain amenities for the Overseas students, such as laundry service and WiFi, as well as transportation to Jerusalem (two hours south of the Yeshiva). Likewise, the Overseas students are matched with a family living in the Kibbutz, where the students may visit for Shabbat meals and so on. The Yeshiva encourages a broad liberal arts education along with professional education. The overseas students are encouraged to attend universities that have a strong Jewish presence so they will be able to continue learning. Campus The Yeshiva is situated on top of Mount Gilboa with views of the Bet She'an Valley, Jordan River Valley, Jezreal valley, the Lower and Upper Galilee, Golan and Mt. Hermon. The campus contains modern dormitories, computer room, classrooms and an auditorium. In addition to a large Hebrew library, the Yeshiva does have over 1000 English books in its growing library. The kibbutz also houses a mini-market, post office and medical clinic. Affiliated organizations Yeshivat Ma'ale Gilboa is affiliated with Herzog College, a teacher's college in Gush Etzion. Learning at Ma'ale Gilboa can count toward a teacher's degree. The Yeshiva is also affiliated with Yeshiva University. Study at the Yeshiva for one year counts as 36 credits at YU. The Yeshiva is not affiliated with the Jewish Agency for Israel's Masa scholarship program, since the Yeshiva does not offer Ulpan courses.

The company's service allows online publishers to sell ads directly. Rather than using the popular pay per click or cost per mille method of charging advertisers for displaying ads on a website, AdTaily charges per day, per week, or per month. History AdTaily started in September 2008, as an online project from Jakub Krzych and Marcin Ekiert which qualified for the London 2008 final of Saul Klein's funding competition Seedcamp. The beta release version of the AdTaily self-service ad system appeared online about half a year later. As AdTaily wanted to concentrate on the \\"Long Tail\\" of the Internet, the service was made available to only 250 bloggers, who were supposed to test the system on their blogs. For the next two months, the system was available on invitation-only, managing to reach 800 users, before it was publicly available. The company has continued to market the service in Poland since then. In July 2009 the Polish media group Agora SA invested in AdTaily, and started using the AdTaily system across 80 per cent of its portfolio of websites. At the beginning of 2010, Adtaily opened an office in London, and launched an international version of its service. In July 2010, AdTaily was named one of \\"Europe's 25 Most Creative Companies\\" by CNBC Business magazine. CNBC said that AdTaily fulfilled the \\"democratising promise of the internet\\" for advertising, allowing the small advertisers in the \\"long tail\\" of advertising to be able to advertise in a way that is better understood than \\"buying 1,000 impressions that go away in a couple of minutes,\\" which for them \\"can seem like a scam.\\" According to CNBC, the AdTaily system is \\"simple and disruptively cheap to use.\\" By September 2010 16.000 publishers installed the AdTaily widget, generating one billion monthly impressions and 1,5 million clicks. There were 5200 paying customers and 30000 ad units sold monthly. By March 2011 it was among the top 50,000 in Alexa traffic rankings. Self-service advertising system According to AdTaily, all of the people who visit a website are interested in its content, and some of them may also be interested in advertising their business or website to the like-minded audience. The AdTaily self-service advertising widget allows advertisers to buy ads in as few as three clicks, without leaving the publisher's website. It uses the PayPal online payment service both for paying for the ad campaigns, and for charging to sell ads on a website). The service also use a single, 125x125px web banner format, so that advertisers can place the same ad on many websites in the same ad format. Users need to create an account on the AdTaily website, after which they receive the widget code, which they have to paste into their website. The widget \\"auto-fits\\" to the section in which it is placed. The user has to know at least some basic HTML in order to know how and where to paste it. For ads sold directly through the publisher's website, the publisher keeps all of the revenue generated through the AdTaily widget Publishers can also moderate which ads appear on their website.

It is one of the oldest lines in Germany, opened in 1849 by the Magdeburg-Wittenberge Railway Company, which operated it until 1863, when it was taken over by the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway Company. It was nationalised in 1879. Route Regionalbahn train crossing the Elbe bridge at Wittenberge The line starts at Magdeburg Hauptbahnhof and then runs to the north, mostly between the Elbe and the B 189 highway. The line is used by regional trains and as far as Zielitz by S-Bahn Mittelelbe trains. In the middle of the line is Stendal, where it connects with lines to Berlin, Hanover, Tangerm√ºnde and Salzwedel. Leaving Stendal, the line turns north. The line crosses the Elbe just before its end in Wittenberge. The Elbe bridge is the longest railway bridge constructed in East Germany during its existence. In Wittenberge station the line connects to the Berlin‚ÄìHamburg trunk line. The station was originally designed as a wedge station between the two lines, but was rebuilt during the upgrading of the Berlin‚ÄìHamburg line between 2000 and 2004. History Planning of the line began in 1838 with the opening of the Berlin-Potsdam Railway, which initiated the railway age in the Kingdom of Prussia. A continuation of the line to the west was already planned, but without a precise route. The town of Stendal, which had no rail connection, sought a continuation of the line from Potsdam via Genthin and Stendal to Hamburg. From Genthin there would also be a branch line to Magdeburg. This plan was rejected in favour of a direct link between Berlin and Hamburg. At the same time, plans for a continuation of the Berlin- Potsdam Railway developed into a direct link to Magdeburg. Magdeburg was developing into one of the first major railway junctions and by September 1846 there were already three lines: the Magdeburg-Leipzig railway (, MLE) from Leipzig, the Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburg Railway (Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburger Eisenbahngesellschaft, BPME) from Berlin and the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway (Magdeburg-Halberst√§dter Eisenbahngesellschaft, MHE) from Halberstadt. However, the city was not connected to Hamburg, which was especially important for foreign trade. Then, at the initiative of the mayor of Magdeburg, August Wilhelm Francke, a route was defined. This route was adopted by the Prussian government on 29 September 1843 as the shortest and most economic line between Magdeburg and Wittenberg, connecting to the line to Hamburg. The Magdeburg- Wittenberg Magdeburg Railway Company was constituted as the designated operator in the following month. Approval for the construction of the line depended mainly on minimising its impact on the Elbe levees in Altmark. In order for the company to obtain a concession it had to develop concrete plans for the Elbe crossing and to make preparations for work to be carried out on the levees. On 6 July 1845 the Prussian king Frederick William IV made a decree authorising the construction by the joint stock company with a capital of 4,500,000 thalers. The estimated construction costs totalled 4,483,000 thalers as follows: * 3 million thalers for the section from Magdeburg to Seehausen, * 83,000 thalers for the section from Seehausen to the Elbe levee, * 1.4 million thalers for the Elbe bridge and connection in Wittenberge. Construction, when it started in 1846, was found to be relatively straightforward. The chosen route had a maximum gradient of 1 in 210 and its sharpest curve had a radius of 300 Prussian rods (equivalent to about 1,130 metres). About 55 ¬Ω percent of the line was level. Only at each end of the line did construction prove to be problematic. In Wittenberge the construction of the bridge over the Elbe led to postponement of the opening of the entire line. In Magdeburg, the problem was integration with other lines. It was necessary for the line to connect to the west and the south, that is with the MHE and MLE lines. To achieve this, there were two possibilities: the first was for the line to cross the slopes of the fortifications on the western edge of Magdeburg to the MHE station. This was a difficult route that had to cross a ring of hills around the fortifications. This route did not appear feasible as the military authorities prohibited cutting through the ridge. The alternative was to cut through the fortifications and build a station within the city. The line ran from the north along the Elbe and through the city walls. Since there was insufficient room for the line to make a curve to return to the edge of the river, which was to the east, the riverbank had to be excavated to make room for the railway. A terminal station and associated facilities was built inside the city. A line was built to connect with the Magdeburg‚ÄìLeipzig line. Private railway era Wolmirstedt station in 1880 The line was opened in the three phases. On 7 July 1849, the 99 km-long section from Magdeburg to Seehausen was opened. On 5 August 1849 this was followed by the eight km-long section to the Elbe levee. Since the Elbe bridge was under construction, passengers had to cross to Wittenberge by ferry. On 25 October 1851, a wooden, single-track bridge was opened to traffic. To avoid this low-level structure obstructing shipping, part of it was built as a swing bridge. During the construction of the Berlin‚ÄìHamburg line, the terminus had been designed to integrate with the line from Magdeburg. The station building was originally located between the junction of the two lines. As well as a direct line from Magdeburg to Hamburg, the route was initially seen as a route between the coast and central and southern Germany. This service did not prove as profitable as initially suggested to shareholders. In addition, in 1855 a large part of the line had to be rebuilt as a result of several floods in Altmark. In 1863, the company was bought by the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway Company. A direct connection did not exist between the two company‚Äôs lines and trains had to use a short piece of the Leipzig line. In 1867, the MHE received a concession to build the Berlin‚ÄìLehrte railway (also known as the Lehrter Railway or Lehrter Bahn). A direct line already existed via Magdeburg, but the new route via Stendal was more direct and thus services would be quicker. The railway facilities in Stendal had to be rebuilt to make it easy for passengers to change trains. The Lehrter Railway runs south of the old town of Wittenberg from east to west, while the old line ran on the eastern edge of the town. The new Lehrter Railway has a connection with a relocated line from Wittenberge to the west of Stendal. This allowed two routes to share the new Stendal station. The diverted line to Wittenberge passes around the town along the north western boundary and then returns to its old route to the north. In addition to the Lehrter Railway, which opened through Stendal in 1871, the so-called America Line opened in 1873 from Stendal via Uelzen to Bremen. In subsequent years operations in Magdeburg became increasingly unsatisfactory. The transfer of trains to the Leipzig railway was difficult and the Elbe river prevented the expansion of the rail facilities. Hence the old idea of a common route through the ring of forts was taken up again. As the urban area was growing and the area outside the walls were being settled, the fortifications were increasingly seen as a nuisance. There still had to be lengthy negotiations with the Prussian military before the railways were offered a suitable site along the northern and western moat. The line was built jointly by the MHE, BPME and MLE. The new Magdeburg Central station was built as an island station (with the main station building between the tracks) because the three railway companies were still working separately. The eastern station tracks were built and operated by the MLE and the western tracks by the BPME and the MHE. The first train ran on 15 May 1873 to Burg; work continued, however, until 1893. During this period, in 1876, the MLE was taken over by the MHE. Three years later the MHE was nationalised. Prussian state railways era Facade of Magdeburg Hauptbahnhof Osterburg station class 425 (left) waits in Magdeburg on its way to Wittenberge After the takeover of the MHE, the Prussian state railways acquired other companies. The state railways established royal railway divisions, each called a K√∂niglichen Eisenbahndirektion (KED). The Magdeburg-Wittenberge Railway came under the new Magdeburg KED. North of Stendal the line came under the Hanover KED. A new Wittenberge Elbe bridge was built between 1883 and 1884. Most of the old wooden bridge was dilapidated and was replaced by a wrought iron truss bridge. The swing bridge was retained, but was replaced in a second reconstruction by a steel structure between 1905 and 1910. At this time, the bridge was widened to include a second track on its northern or eastern side. The southern track also adapted to permit road vehicles to cross, as there was no road bridge in Wittenberge. After the founding of Deutsche Reichsbahn (German State Railways) in 1920, the divisions were rearranged. The Magdeburg‚ÄìStendal section was assigned to the newly established Hanover railway division (Reichsbahndirektion, RBD); the Stendal‚ÄìWittenberge section was assigned to the Hamburg RBD. In addition to local rail services in the Prussian Province of Saxony, the line was also used by mainline services connecting Dresden, Leipzig, Magdeburg, Wittenberge and Hamburg. Towards the end of the Second World War, the Wittenberg Elbe bridge was blown up. By the autumn of 1945 Soviet pioneers had temporarily restored the southern track of the bridge. The bridge was reduced to a single track line as, as during the Soviet occupation the second track was removed as reparations to the Soviet Union. The northern track of the bridge was restored temporarily in 1947. Due to the lack of a rail track, however, only road traffic ran along this track. In 1950, the second track was re-commissioned and road traffic returned to the southern track. The route was developed in the coming years as the most important north-south link in East German, bypassing Berlin. The second track was quickly restored. Because operations over the bridge, despite its two tracks, was restricted to a speed of 30 km/h, it became a bottleneck. In 1957, the superstructure of the bridge was replaced using its old pillars. In 1969 the Magdeburg S-Bahn was established. This involved adapting all the lines' infrastructure as far as Zielitz, which was selected as the northern terminus, to support a mixed operation of S-Bahn, regional, long-distance and freight traffic. Similarly, overhead lines were installed to support electric operations. North of the village of Zielitz, a four-track Zielitz station was built, letting S-Bahn trains reverse and freight trains continue without obstruction. Continuing towards Magdeburg a pair of tracks was built for the S-Bahn from the junction with the line from Oebisfelde, bypassing the Magdeburg-Rothensee marshalling yard. From Magdeburg-Neustadt the S-Bahn shared the common line with other train traffic. S-Bahn operations commenced on 29 September 1974. Further electrification was carried out in the 1980s. Electric operations were extended to Stendal in 1982 and to Wittenberge in 1987. The East Germany Railways built a new bridge over the Elbe without obstructing operations. The new bridge was the longest railway bridge built during the existence of East Germany. Current situation  Today the line is served by line S1, the only service of the S-Bahn Mittelelbe, between Magdeburg and Wittenberge. In the summer it is served by an InterCity pair of trains called Warnow (2238/2239) from Leipzig via Magdeburg, Wittenberge, Schwerin and Rostock to Warnem√ºnde. Between Magdeburg and Stendal there is also the Regional-Express service RE20 from/to Uelzen via Salzwedel. In 2012, a new electronic interlocking was put into operation in Wolmirstedt, this is connected to the sub-centre in Biederitz. The new railway tunnel under the Mittelland Canal was completed at the end of 2013.

The Visitation to the Dioceses was carried out in the four Metropolitan Sees (or Archdioceses) during the first few months of 2011. In addition, Timothy Cardinal Dolan of New York was appointed to conduct visits to four seminaries to review their formation programs. Members of Religious institutes were appointed to visit various congregations. The Visitation was essentially pastoral. Background The Murphy Report, issued in 2009, documented widespread child abuse by priests in the Dublin archdiocese between 1975 and 2004 and said that the Church in Ireland had concealed the abuse. The report said one priest admitted abusing children every two weeks for more than 25 years. On March 19, 2010, following a meeting with the Bishops of Ireland, Pope Benedict XVI issued a Pastoral Letter to the Catholics in Ireland. The Letter expressed sorrow and regret regarding abuse perpetrated by priests and religious and the way in which such cases had been responded to in the past, and called for an Apostolic Visitation of certain dioceses in Ireland, as well as seminaries and religious congregations. A number of Vatican departments including the Secretariat of State, the Congregation for the Clergy, the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life as well as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith were involved in the planning of the visitation which will be co-ordinated by the Congregation for Bishops. In a three-way process, the Curia met separately with the visitors and the Irish bishops, while the visitors may well take the opportunity to meet with the bishops to whose diocese they have been assigned. \\"It is important to remember that the Visitators are not expected to receive allegations of new or old cases of abuse. If any were to arise, such allegations must be reported to the respective Ordinaries or Major Superiors who have the duty to inform the competent civil and ecclesiastical authorities, in conformity with the current civil and ecclesiastical laws. Reporter Paddy Agnew likened the visitation \\"To a certain extent, ...equivalent to HQ at a multi-national sending a taskforce delegation of trouble shooters to check out what went wrong at the local branch. November 2010 press release On 12 November 2010, the Press Office of the Holy See announced that > \\"The Visitation will identify whether the mutual relationship of the various > components of the local Church, seminaries and religious communities is now > in place, in order to sustain them on the path of profound spiritual renewal > already being pursued by the Church in Ireland. It also has the goal of > verifying the effectiveness of the present processes used in responding to > cases of abuse and of the current forms of assistance provided to the > victims. It will not be an investigation into individual cases of abuse nor > a trial to judge past events. The Visitators will have to identify the > explicit problems which may require some assistance from the Holy See\\".Press > Release of the Holy See at the Beginning of the Apostolic Visitation in > Ireland Importantly the press release noted that \\"The Visitation will in no way interfere with the ordinary activity of local magistrates, nor with the activity of the Commissions of Investigation established by the Irish Parliament nor with the work of any legislative authority, which has competence in the area of prevention of abuse of minors. The Visitation does not seek to replace the legitimate authority of the local Bishops or Religious Superiors, who maintain responsibility in the handling of cases of abuse\\". This was seen to be in response to some complaints that canon law was seen to override civil law, which some argued led to greater cover up and further abuse. The release made clear that the visitors would \\"monitor how well the guidelines of \\"Safeguarding Children, Standards and Guidance Document for the Catholic Church in Ireland\\", commissioned and produced in February 2009 by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church, are functioning and how they may be better implemented and improved.\\" On 7 October 2010, Cardinal Marc Ouellet and Archbishop Manuel Monteiro de Castro, with representatives of the Holy See, held a preparatory meeting with the Apostolic Visitators named by Pope Benedict. At the meeting were Archbishop Michael Neary of Tuam, along with Cardinal Brady, Archbishops Diarmuid Martin of Dublin and Dermot Clifford of Cashel and Emly for high-level talks with heads of Vatican congregations about the visitation, and met the investigators appointed by Pope Benedict to examine the four Irish archdioceses and \\"some other as yet unspecified dioceses\\". Scope It was believed that Vatican personnel wanted a broader investigation and not just a look at child abuse.Bishops seek to limit Vatican visitation The Congregations for Bishops, for Institutes of Consecrated Life and for Catholic Education concurred with the Secretariat of State that the first phase of the Visitation ‚Äì the inquiry concerning the four metropolitan archdioceses, religious houses and seminaries ‚Äì should be completed by Easter 2011. Visitors The Visitation to the Dioceses was carried out in the four Metropolitan Sees during the first few months of 2011. Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the Cardinal-Archbishop Emeritus of Westminster, was to inspect Cardinal Brady's archdiocese of Armagh, and Sean O'Malley, Cardinal Archbishop of Boston, the Dublin archdiocese. Toronto's Archbishop Thomas Christopher Collins investigated Cashel, while Ottawa's Archbishop Terrence Prendergast looked at the west of Ireland archdiocese of Tuam. Each of the archdioceses is a metropolitan see. The authority of a Latin Church metropolitan over the other sees within his province is however, somewhat limited. A metropolitan generally presides at the installation and consecration of new bishops in the province, and the tribunal of the metropolitan see generally serves as the first court of appeal regarding canonical matters of provincial diocesan tribunals. Boudinhon, Auguste. \\"Metropolitan.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 13 February 2020 The Visitators were to give particular attention to victims of abuse and their families, but also to meet with and listen to a variety of people, including ecclesiastical authorities, lay faithful and those involved with the crucial work of safeguarding of children. Cardinal Brady said he hoped that people would see in time that the apostolic visitation was a genuine attempt to renew the trust of people who had been abused. An investigation of the state of Irish seminaries was conducted by Archbishop Timothy Dolan of New York. The investigators, known as apostolic visitors, were to report their findings directly to Pope Benedict XVI. Seminaries and religious houses The Apostolic Visitator for the Irish Seminaries was the Most Reverend Timothy M. Dolan, Archbishop of New York. The Visitator examined all aspects of priestly formation. Dolan visited four institutions: St. Patrick's College, Maynooth; the Pontifical Irish College, Rome; Saint Malachy's College, Belfast; and Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy, Dublin, which is more an academic centre than a seminary, was examined only with regard to the theological formation offered to future priests. will be visited only in regard to its academic programmes. (All Hallows College, Dublin no longer offers a programme of priestly formation.)\\"Summary of the Findings of the Apostolic Visitation in Ireland\\" Dolan was assisted by some clerics, approved by the Congregation for Catholic Education, whose main duty was to help to conduct private one-to-one interviews with the seminarians, and staff members. Each priest graduated from the seminary in the previous three years was also given the opportunity for a private interview. Sr. Sharon Holland, I.H.M., Fr. Robert Maloney, C.M., Sister M√°irin McDonagh, R.J.M. and Fr. Gero McLoughlin, S.J. were appointed to serve as Apostolic Visitators of those Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life with houses in Ireland. The first phase of this Visitation consisted of in a Questionnaire soliciting information regarding the involvement of Institutes in cases of abuse, the responses offered to victims, and the compliance of the Institute with the protocols contained in \\"Safeguarding Children, Standards and Guidance Document for the Catholic Church in Ireland\\". The Questionnaire also sought to ascertain how each community is dealing with the revelations and their consequences. The Visitators then had the opportunity to conduct extended visits to 31 religious institutes. 2011 documentary film In 1996 the Irish bishops had devised a new set of policies for handling such allegations, including a mandate to inform law-enforcement officials of all credible reports of abuse. However, in January 1997 Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland Luciano Storero sent a letter to the Irish bishops, conveying the decision of the Congregation for Clergy that the policies should not be carried out. Sterero stated that procedures and policies contrary to canon law \\"could invalidate the acts of the same Bishops who are attempting to put a stop to these problems.\\"Letter text Archbishop Storero indicated that priests might successfully appeal to the Congregation for the Clergy against disciplinary action taken in line with the policies. The papal nuncio said that since the policies in the English speaking world appear similar in a number of respects, Congregation was conducting a \\"global study\\" would \\"at the appropriate time\\" provide more complete directions on handling sex-abuse complaints. On 17 January 2011, an Irish television documentary said that in 1997, Cardinal Dar√≠o Castrill√≥n Hoyos, then Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, directed the Irish bishops not to enforce their new policy calling for mandatory reporting of priests who molested children, as likely to lead to successful appeals by priests disciplined without due canonical process. The documentary also offers strong support for an Irish prelate who has been the target of savage criticism, and who attempted to resign in protest at the Vatican's policies, and puts a new perspective on the efforts of the Irish hierarchy in general. \\"In view of the shortage of personnel trained in canon law, the Visitators insisted on the need for a reorganization of Ireland‚Äôs ecclesiastical tribunals, to be carried out in cooperation with the competent bodies of the Holy See, so that the various cases still awaiting definitive resolution can be adequately processed.\\" June 2011 communique On 6 June 2011 the Press Office of the Holy See released a communique restating the aims of the visitation examining \\"whether the mutual relationship of the various components of the local Church, seminaries and religious communities is now in place, in order to sustain them on the path of profound spiritual renewal already being pursued by the Church in Ireland\\"; \\"the effectiveness of the present processes used in responding to cases of abuse\\" and \\"the current forms of assistance provided to the victims\\".COMMUNIQU√â AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE APOSTOLIC VISITATION IN IRELAND It further stated that the reports of the visitors had been presented to the competent departments of the Roman Curia. It noted that, \\"as far as the Irish dioceses and seminaries are concerned, the Congregation for Bishops and the Congregation for Catholic Education do not envisage further Apostolic Visitations\\". The Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life had analysed the responses to the questionnaires that were sent to all institutes with houses in Ireland. In line with the method previously adopted, visits in loco to some religious communities were to follow. Indications to the bishops and religious houses for the spiritual renewal were to follow shortly. Finally, the communique stated that the final report would be published in early 2012. Conclusion On 20 March 2012, the Press Office of the Holy See released a summary of the report, and at the same time a press conference was held in Maynooth, with participation by Nuncio Charles John Brown, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin and Cardinal Brady. > The Visitators have been able to establish that, over and above the > suffering of the victims, the painful events of recent years have also > opened many wounds within the Irish Catholic community. Many lay persons > have experienced a loss of trust in their Pastors. Many good priests and > Religious have felt unjustly tainted by association with the accused in the > court of public opinion; some have not felt sufficiently defended by their > Bishops and Superiors. Those same Bishops and Superiors have often felt > isolated as they sought to confront the waves of indignation and at times > they have found it difficult to agree on a common line of action. The summary of the report stated \\"...it must be acknowledged that within the Christian community innocent young people were abused by clerics and Religious to whose care they had been entrusted, while those who should have exercised vigilance often failed to do so effectively.\\" It encouraged bishops to continue to meet with and support victims of abuse in an effort \\"to understand better various aspects of the problem of the sexual abuse of minors\\" and prevent future occurrence. While acknowledging that \\"the current norms of Safeguarding Children: Standards and Guidance Document for the Catholic Church in Ireland (Guidelines) are being followed\\", it recommended regular audits to ensure continued compliance. Furthermore, the norms should be upgraded and revised as needed. With regard to seminary formation programs, the Visitators recommended more consistent admission criteria and to include in the academic programme in-depth formation on matters of child protection, with increased pastoral attention to victims of sexual abuse and their families. Regarding Religious institutes, the Holy See directed \\"All Institutes should perform an audit of their personnel files, if such an audit has not yet been carried out.\\" It further directed bishops and Superiors to formulating guidelines for: handling the varied cases of those who have been accused, but in whose case the Director of Public Prosecution has decided not to proceed; policies regarding the falsely accused and their return to ministry; and policies regarding those who are convicted of abuse: the appropriate settings and the conditions under which such offenders should live.
