Life and career Herbst was born in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and was almost 35 by the time (as officially identified) of German reunification. Between 1977 and 1982 he studied Historical Sciences at Berlin's Humboldt University. After obtaining his degree he worked as a research assistant at the Museum for German History (Museum f√ºr Deutsche Geschichte) in Berlin.

He was the second son of Henry II, Duke of Austria. His lands spanned from Liesing to Piesting and Bruck an der Leitha. His first known use of the title 'Duke of M√∂dling' was from 1205.  Life  Henry was knighted with his brother Leopold V in 1174. On the death of their father, Henry II, Duke of Austria, he received the lands of M√∂dling from his brother, Leopold V, Duke of Austria around 1177. The castle of the same name became his Seat of Power. He went to Vienna on the 25 August 1190 to see his brother off to join the Third Crusade, while he traveled to Italy to act as a representative of the Babenbergs and to attend the coronation of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor in Spring 1191. He is known to have taken part in the German Crusade of 1197 with his nephew, Frederick I of Austria and Wolfger, Bishop of Passau. By 6 June 1197, he was at the Imperial court encampment at Castro St. Giovanni and a few days later, at the same time with Duke Frederick in Linaria. When they left Apulia to reach Sicily, they were encouraged further, after two ships sunk at sea, with the Abbots of Werd and Beuern.Juritsch 1894, pp. 353 The Emperor now took full command and instructed Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz & Chancellor of Germany to lead the fleet over the Mediterranean. They sailed in early September 1197 and arrived in Acre a few weeks later.Juritsch 1894, pp. 354 His branch of the Babenberg line did not focus on matters of war, but became mostly interested in arts. His surname is somewhat confusing, as M√∂dling was not a separate duchy, but a subordinate- duchy ruled by the Babenbergs in Vienna. His territory, under his reign, experienced a marginal prosperity. During his government, he built M√∂dling castle in the 12th century. The most prominent guest was the minstrel Walther von der Vogelweide in 1219. He married Richeza of Bohemia (‚Ä† 19 April 1182 ), daughter of Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia and had one son, Henry III, Duke of M√∂dling called the Younger.

It now receives notoriety as the \\"Oldest Continuing\\" church in Harlem. The church‚Äôs first house of worship was erected on East 117th Street, between 2nd and 3rd Avenues in 1843.  History  Greater Hood Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church is the 1st black church to be established in the Harlem and now the oldest church to be exclusively located in Harlem, having been in Harlem long before Harlem itself became a predominantly black community. The first name of the congregation was the Harlem A.M.E. Zion Church, nicknamed, \\"Little Zion.\\" It was given the nickname because the church was started as the uptown branch of Mother A.M.E. Zion Church, the mother church of the A.M.E. Zion denomination (located then in lower Manhattan), to serve those African Americans who were working as servants on the estates that occupied Harlem in the early and mid-nineteenth century. Subsequent names of this congregation have been Rush Memorial, Hood Memorial and now Greater Hood Memorial. The church‚Äôs founding date is confirmed in a letter from the 1st Bishop, James Varick, dated 1825 in which he states the founding date of March 25, 1820. That letter also notes the founder, Rev. VanHas, as ‚Äúthe minister in charge of the aforesaid church in Harlem. Years later, under the leadership of the Rev. J.A. King, the 66-member congregation of Harlem A.M.E. Zion Church erected its first structure, a small brick building, in the early part of 1843. Tension arose between \\"Little Zion\\" and Mother Zion over who had control of the property at 117th Street. The Trustees of Mother Zion claimed title to the property. The issue would not be resolved until 1910 when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of \\"Little Zion.\\" As early as 1909, there was a clamoring for a new edifice. The migration of African Americans from the South had brought an increase in membership. A building fund was started, but a new location was not secured until 1911. Upon completion, the church was to be renamed the Rush Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church in honor of Christopher, the second Bishop of the denomination. On October 15, 1911, the cornerstone was laid at the new site, 58-60 West 138th Street, near Lenox Avenue. Bishops Walters, Clinton, and Caldwell were in attendance for the ceremonies, The Rev. Beverly C. Ransom, Pastor of Bethel A.M.E. Church in Manhattan, delivered the dedicatory sermon. During the 1920s, the church increased in esteem among its peers. It was one of the most respected churches in New York City. Bishops who presided over the various Episcopal Districts within the A.M.E. Zion Church graced Rush Memorial's pulpit regularly. Under the leadership of Dr. G.M. Oliver, the church experienced phenomenal growth, taking in 600 new members between 1920 and 1925. One hundred seventy-five new members alone joined between 1924 and 1925. During this time the church's auditorium and vestry were renovated at the cost of $25,000 and many of the church's debts were paid off. Rush Memorial, like the nation, was caught in the grips of the Great Depression during the 1930s. As the income of the membership began to decline and others lost their jobs completely, the church began to fall into arrears in its mortgage payments. As a result, the congregation lost their building in 1935. The congregation was forced to rely on the largess of other churches to hold their worship services. One of the earliest churches to lend a hand was Rev. T.J.B. Harris and the congregation of Rendall Memorial Presbyterian Church, 65 West 137th Street. At the 114th Session of the New York Annual Conference, held at the Ralph Avenue A.M.E. Zion Church in Brooklyn in June 1935, Bishop Kyles appointed then pastor Rev. W. W. Prime to pastor in Mt. Kisco, NY and brought Rev. B.J, McClellan from South Carolina to pastor the beleaguered congregation. At the New York Annual Conference held at Mother Zion in 1936, Rev. McClellan was returned to the congregation, which was worshipping at 57-61 West 137th Street. It is in the official minutes of this conference that the name of the congregation is listed as Hood Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church. The Church had been renamed in honor of Bishop James Walker Hood. By 1937, Rev McClellan was actively searching for larger quarters for the church. During the same year, a four-story building was purchased at 229 Lenox Avenue. Not willing to lose another edifice, the congregation burned the mortgage by 1947. In the early part of 1938 dedicatory services were held at the new church edifice. Celebratory services were held during the entire month of March. Although some of the members had scattered since losing the Rush Memorial building in 1935, 200 people had joined the congregation since Rev. McClellan took over as pastor. In June of that year, Hood Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church played host to the 117th Session of the New York Annual Conference. The congregation was highly praised for its progress and the hospitality it demonstrated as host. According to Bishop Kyles, who presided over the conference, it was one of the best sessions he had ever held. The congregation was assured of not losing its edifice, having burned the mortgage in 1947, but by then it had also outgrown the 229 Lenox Avenue site. Rev. McClellan had passed during the same year. Thus, upon appointment to the church, it became the task of the Rev. James W. Wactor (who became a bishop in 1972) to secure a new edifice for the growing congregation. The former Lido Pool, a dance hall and recreation center, at 160 West 146th Street was purchased between the end of 1949 and early part of 1950 at a price of $122,000. It cost $50,000 for alterations to make the building ready for worship. The completed remodeling work pushed the total expenditure for the building to nearly $200.000. On July 22, 1951, following a parade through the streets of Harlem to celebrate the church's move, Greater Hood Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church was dedicated to the glory of God by the late Bishop William J. Walls, the presiding Bishop over the New York Conference. The services began at 4 pm with a capacity crowd of 1,500 people in attendance. From its humble beginnings, the congregation had moved from being \\"Little\\" to truly being \\"Great.\\" There were, however, several members who did not leave the work at 229 Lenox Avenue. The New York Conference purchased the building and the remaining members began Walter's Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. They enjoyed many years of success as they continued the work their sister Church left for them to do. Greater Hood Memorial has had their share of Pastors after Rev. Wactor. Rev. Churchill was assigned to continue the work after Rev, Wactor, and continued to have the congregation to grow. Others who followed to take the helm of this great church include Rev. David Pharr who was later appointed Presiding Elder of the Long Island District of the New York Conference; Rev. George Miller, Rev. Madison J. McRae, Rev. Albert Pitts, Rev, David Hoffman, Rev.

Mulford. It was syndicated via electrical transcription, beginning in 1948 and continuing into 1950. Its network broadcasts began on Mutual January 1, 1950, and ended on CBS December 27, 1952. Background CBS produced an audition episode of a Hopalong Cassidy program that was broadcast in the summer of 1941 as part of Forecast, a series of pilots for potential programs. After that, little, if anything, was heard about a Hopalong Cassidy radio production until five years later. An item in Radio Life in 1946 commented, \\"Radio's gone western with a vengeance, as if you didn't know!\\" and reported that a radio version of the Cassidy movies would be heard \\"in the near future.\\" That \\"near future\\" turned out to be two years. Format The program has been classified as both a \\"juvenile adventure program\\"Reinehr, Robert C. and Swartz, Jon D. (2008). The A to Z of Old-Time Radio. Scarecrow Press, Inc. . P. 129. and a \\"western adventure drama.\\" As was true of the movies and television programs featuring Hopalong Cassidy, \\"the character was much more civilized than the rough-cut character portrayed in the novels\\" by Clarence E. Mulford. In contrast, the revised Cassidy was described by radio historian John Dunning as \\"a knight of the range, a man of morals.\\" A newspaper story about the program's debut on Mutual commented, \\"The radio broadcasts will be specially scripted to highlight the personality, mannerisms and unusual adventures of the steely- eyed, justice-dealing, gun-toting cowboy hero.\\" Characters and cast William Boyd played Hopalong Cassidy, as he had in the movies featuring that character. Dunning wrote: \\"Boyd had one of radio's perfect voices. His voice could do anything -- comfort a bereaved widow one moment, scare the boots off her husband's killer the next. It was strong, virile, and straight to the point. And that Hoppy belly-laugh became famous. It was one of his trademarks.\\"Dunning, John. (1976). Tune in Yesterday: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, 1925-1976. Prentice-Hall, Inc. . Pp. 289-290. Andy Clyde, \\"the resident old coot sidekick from the later movies\\" had his same role in the radio program. Each episode's opening referred to Clyde's character, California Carlson, as \\"'the same California you've laughed at a million times.'\\" Synergy of media After a slow start (when producers Walter and Shirley White \\"were paying production costs for new episodes as money came in from initial clients\\"), the popularity of Hopalong Cassidy on radio began to increase. In 1948, a Hopalong Cassidy television series began, first shown on KTLA in Los Angeles, California. That series included both edited versions of Cassidy's movies and new episodes made for TV. \\"One medium fed on the other,\\" Dunning wrote, and \\"for two years [Boyd] was as big a media hero as the nation had seen.\\" Both the radio and the television versions of Hopalong Cassidy benefited from the existing popularity the Cassidy character had developed through movies. The producers made good use of that popularity in promoting the syndicated program to stations and advertisers. An ad in the 1949 issue of Broadcasting Yearbook proclaimed: > \\"THIRTEEN YEARS OF MOTION PICTURE POPULARITY BEHIND IT! (NO OTHER RADIO > SERIES CAN MAKE THIS CLAIM!) An action-packed film trailer will be shown in > over 10,000 theatres announcing the radio series! \\"HOPALONG CASSIDY\\" comes > to radio with a fabulous following ... a ready made audience for sponsors!

Pietro's father wished him to study law, but he arranged to have some training locally under Giuseppe Baldrighi in design, and then Benigno Bossi. In 1761, he won a prize at the Academy of Fine Arts of Parma. In 1769, with the patronage of the minister of the Duchy du Tillot and perhaps under the encouragement of the court architect Petitot, Pietro went to Paris to learn engraving working with Jacques-Philippe Le Bas.Dizionario biografico dei Parmigiani illustri o benemeriti nelle scienze, nelle lettere, e nelle arti, by Giovanni Battista Janelli, Genoa, 1877, pages 244-245. With the dismissal of du Tillot in 1771, his subsidy stopped, but he demurred in returning to Parma to settle, since he was no longer assured a post as professor of engraving in the Parmesan Academy of Fin Arts. He set forth on traveling through Italy, then up to Netherlands, and finally London. In 1787, he had a prominent exhibition of his prints. In 1792, he was awarded the position of Academic Professor of the Parmesan Academy, but continued to travel, until the French Revolution prompted him to return to Parma.Dizionario biografico dei Parmigiani illustri o benemeriti nelle scienze, nelle lettere, e nelle arti, by Giovanni Battista Janelli, Genoa, 1877, pages 242-243.

She was the first African-American Roman Catholic Mother Superior. She was a member of the Healy family. Family history Born in 1846 in Macon, Georgia, Eliza Healy was the youngest daughter of Michael Morris Healy, an Irish immigrant and successful plantation owner, and Mary Eliza Clarke, a biracial slave. Born in County Roscommon, Ireland, Michael Morris Healy traveled to Canada as a member of the British army. He then migrated to Jones County, near Macon, Georgia. The couple lived together from 1829 until their deaths in 1850 and raised 10 children, nine of whom survived to adulthood. Due to the partus sequitur ventrem principle, Eliza and her siblings (James, Hugh, Patrick, Sherwood (Alexander), Michael, Martha, Josephine (Amanda) and Eugene) were legally considered slaves, even though their father was a free white man and they had three fourths white ancestry. Georgia state law at the time prohibited slaves from receiving an education and prohibited manumission, so the Healy children were sent to the North to have an education and higher quality of life than what slaves in the South were accorded. When Eliza's parents died within months of each other in 1850, her five older brothers and one older sister were already living in the North. The three youngest Healy children, including Eliza, left Georgia after their parents' death and relocated to New York. Early life Even though Michael was Catholic, his children were not baptized Catholics. Eliza and her two younger siblings, Josephine (Amanda) and Eugene, were baptized Catholic in New York in 1851. Eliza and Josephine both attended schools operated by the Congregation of Notre-Dame in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and in Montreal, Quebec. Eliza and Josephine joined their siblings in Boston, Massachusetts when Eliza finished her secondary education in 1861. She lived for a time with her brother, Eugene, in Boston, and then moved to Newton, to live with her brother James, who had been ordained to the priesthood. He would go on to become the first African-American bishop in the United States. Eliza traveled with James to Europe and the Middle East in 1868. She continued living in the West Netwton family home until 1874. In the wake of the panic of 1873, which destroyed much of James' financial resources, Eliza made the decision to enter the religious life. Religious life On May 1, 1874, at the age of 27, Eliza entered the novitiate of the Congregation of Notre Dame in Montreal, Canada, and, in December of that same year, received the habit and her new religious name. She pronounced her first vows on July 19, 1876, at twenty-nine years of age, and took her final vows six years later. Despite the customs of the times, the fact that she was black was not a hindrance to her admission by Mother Saint- Victor and her council. In fact, some twenty years earlier, Eliza's older sister, Martha Ann, entered the Congregation as professed Sister Sainte-Lucie from 1855 to 1863. Martha Ann then received a dispensation from her vows. Sister Saint Mary Magdalen began teaching at Saint-Patrick's Academy in Montreal. Two years later, in 1878, she was among the three sisters who opened the CND mission in Brockville, Ontario. She also taught at Sherbrooke, Quebec (1881-86), and at St-Anthony's in Montreal (1886-88, 1890-94). After a year as assistant superior in Ottawa, she was appointed superior of a convent in Huntingdon, Quebec (1895-97). The order was struggling with debt and financial instability, and her strong administrative skills enabled her to return the convent to solvency. From 1897-98, she served as the superior at St-Denis's Academy. The two following years she was dean of English studies at the congregation's sixth motherHouse in Montreal, and, from 1900-03, she taught at the √âcole Normale Jacques-Cartier, section pour filles (also in Montreal). From 1903-18, Sister Saint Mary Magdalen was Mother Superior and headmistress of the Villa Barlow in St. Albans, Vermont. She was the first African American woman to be appointed Mother Superior. Villa Barlow was a well-known and prestigious girls school, and many of its students came from wealthy New England families. But it had fallen into disarray and was burdened with debt. Over her fifteen years in leadership, Sister Saint Mary Magdalen reorganized the school and its community, and restored a high level of academic and administrative excellence. It was a challenging task. She \\"had to struggle against the parish and even the diocesan authorities. Her wisdom enabled her to unravel the complicated problems, to assure the resources, to pay the debts, and to make this...mission one of our most prosperous houses in the United States.\\" She also managed the health and hygiene practices of her fellow religious sisters and pupils in her charge. In 1918, her fifteen years as superior came to an end when the new Code of Canon Law set limits to terms for religious superiors. Sadly but obediently, Sister Saint Mary Magdalen accepted a new challenge as superior of Notre Dame Academy, Staten Island, New York, where in a short time, she improved the academy's financial situation. After eight months, due to health reasons, she had to leave this position, returning to the Mother House in Montreal. She died on September 13, 1919 from heart disease. Her funeral was held at the Mother House on Friday, September 19, 1919. Legacy Archives written by Eliza's community members describe her as having business and organizational acumen, an optimistic disposition and high expectations for her Congregation. They particularly noted her leadership skills and devotion to prayer. They described her as \\"so attractive, so upright! . . . She reserved the heaviest tasks for herself . . . in the kitchen, in the garden in the housework . . . She listened to everyone . . . was equal to everything . . . spared herself nothing . . . so that nothing was lacking to make the family (of the community) perfect.\\" All three of the Healy daughters were professed nuns, though Martha left religious life in 1863. Four of the six Healy sons devoted their lives to Catholic religious orders. No surviving documents written by the Healy siblings ever address the issue of race, even though the issue of race lies at the core of their family history. Her brothers James and Alexander were described as visibly black, but Patrick's racial identity was not known outside of his Jesuit community. No surviving documents indicate that any of the Healy siblings engaged in the black Catholic community.

It is located south of Rogersville along the Holston River (Cherokee Lake). History A post office called Austin's Mills was established in 1866, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1892. The origin of the name is uncertain, though J.H. McCrary, an early-20th century resident, suggested the name is derived from a flour mill constructed by the Austin family about a mile upstream from the community. The mill was still in operation in the early 1900s, and a plant at the mill provided electricity to Rogersville. The community thrived as a transloading station during this period, where lumber was gathered and loaded onto boats (and later trains) for transport out of the region. The mill, lumber yard, and numerous other structures were demolished and a large portion of the community was inundated when the Tennessee Valley Authority completed Cherokee Dam in the 1940s.J.H.

Over the years, millions of Indians mostly working class have migrated to the Persian Gulf region looking for jobs and they account for a sizeable share in the total remittances received from abroad. Indian External Affairs Ministry refers the region as West Asia and not as Middle East which is a more popular attribution, particularly in the Western countries. Link West policy In an attempt to strengthen ties with India's western neighbours, especially the Persian Gulf countries, Modi proposed this policy to complement his Act East policy concerning East Asia. Although it is called \\"Link West\\" (west of India) which gives it a bigger geographical connotation, it is most likely to focus on the middle-east and some of the India's strategic thinkers are calling it as Modi's middle-east policy. Bahrain Swaraj choose Manama, Bahrain for her first visit to the Persian Gulf. The visit marked the first high level exchange from Modi govt to any Arab states following apprehension of less priority given to the Indo-Arab relation under Modi administration. The island country with a significant population of Indian origin people has extensive trade and business ties with India. There addressing at a business meet the minister reiterated \\"Our government is firmly committed to bring back growth, have clear policies which will facilitate business environment, transparency and speed, well thought out decisions\\". In order to boost maritime cooperation with the Persian Gulf countries India sent ICGS Vijit, a Vishwast class offshore patrol vessel, to a 4 nations friendly visit including Bahrain in late December 2014. Iraq =Iraqi Kurdistan= Prior to the Modi administration, there had been limited diplomatic relations between India and Iraqi Kurdistan. India purchases Kurdish crude oil sold through Turkish companies. Several Indian citizens work in Iraqi Kurdistan. Many Kurds travel to India for educational or medical purposes. In July 2014, Hemin Hawrani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party's international relations wing, told The Hindu that he hoped for deeper political and economic ties with India, describing the country as \\"an important partner\\". Hawrani also expressed his desire to see the Indian government open a consulate in Erbil, and invited Indian companies to invest in Kurdistan.http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/kurdish- leadership-calls-for-better-india-ties/article6170941.ece In November 2014, the Indian government sent special envoy Ambassador Suresh K. Reddy to visit Kurdistan and meet Kurdish government officials. Reddy stated that India \\"fully supports the Kurdistan Region during this difficult time\\", and expressed confidence in the Kurdish government and the Peshmerga forces to preserve the stability and security of the region. The Ambassador also praised the role of Peshmerga forces in fighting ISIL, and announced that the Indian government would open a consulate in Kurdistan.http://dfr.gov.krd/a/d.aspx?l=12&a;=44267  Israel Israel is one of India's most important strategic partner and major source of its military hardware. Relation is expected to flourish with Modi government as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is known for its pro-Israeli stands and in favor of strengthening ties with Israel. Sushma Swaraj, who was chairperson of the 'India-Israel parliamentary friendship group', visited Israel earlier and called Israel a \\"reliable partner\\" besides expressing her admiration for former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. In September 2014, Modi met his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu in the first interaction between the premiers of the two countries in 11 years with the leader of the Jewish state saying that \\"sky is the limit\\" for bilateral relations. Later on India has decided to buy Israeli anti-tank Spike missile instead of Javelin missile offered by the US which signifies the depth of Israel-India bilateral relation specially with BJP government in New Delhi. The contract is expected to be worth $525 million, with this Israel is India's second largest arm supplier after Russia. Home Minister Rajnath Singh became the first Minister of Modi govt to visit Israel. His trip featured a series of high level meetings with top Israeli leadership including Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon, National Security Adviser Yossi Cohenand, Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich and the Prime Minister following which Netanyahu said \\"Indians and Israelis share the combination of ingenuity and continuity.\\" It was the first visit of an Indian Home Minister to Israel since June 2000 when L K Advani visited Jerusalem, marking an upsurge in bilateral cooperation. On the same day Modi met former Israeli President and Nobel laureate Shimon Peres in New Delhi. In the meeting Modi informed Peres about his strong desire to further expand and strengthen India's relations with Israel, both in traditional areas as well as in new areas of cooperation. ;2014 Israel-Hamas conflict At the height of the tension between Israel and Hamas in July India offered a rhetorical condemnation holding both sides responsible for erupting violence and asked Israel to stop \\"disproportionate use of force\\" in Gaza which was read by many as departure from tradition of more vocal supports for the Palestinian cause. External Affairs Minister Swaraj insisted that \\"there is absolutely no change in India's policy towards Palestine, which is that we fully support the Palestinian cause while maintaining good relations with Israel. \\" clarifying India's current position on the issue. That might sound like fence-sitting, but it's a policy shared by all Indian governments of the past 20 years following the establishment of formal diplomatic relation in 1992. Sushma Swaraj, a seasoned parliamentarian, had herself blocked the opposition demand in Rajya Sabha for passing a resolution condemning Israel for 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict by saying that \\"India has friendly relation with both Israel and Palestine and therefore any such move may impact its friendship negatively\\". Although later in a symbolic gesture India joined others BRICS nations in voting at the United Nations Human Rights Council for a probe into the alleged human rights violation in Gaza. Which generated mixed response among media and analysts in India. Oman External Affairs Minister Swaraj made a two-day visit to Oman, her maiden visit to the oil-rich Persian Gulf country, on 17 February 2015 where she met her counterpart Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah and discussed bilateral issues of mutual interests. The Omani top leadership expressed their interests in developing a strong political, economic and strategic relation with India. Swaraj had said that the welfare of the diaspora is among her top priority in the Persian Gulf region which host more than 7 million Indian workers. United Arab Emirates Economic cooperation defines the bilateral relations between India and the Arab Emirates, the UAE is one of the largest trading partners of India. Foreign Minister Swaraj during her maiden trip to Abu Dhabi tried to win the confidence of potential UAE investors and welcomed them to join the new Indian govt effort to build world class infrastructure in India which is expected to require foreign investments up to US$1 trillion in next five years. She had also held discussion with her counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during the meeting, both sides reviewed the existing bilateral relations and took stock of progress and development in joint cooperation in many areas and looked into the ways of enhancing them for common interests.

Even before becoming the Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinted that his foreign policy will actively focus on improving ties with India's immediate neighbours which is being termed as neighbourhood first policy in the media and he started well by inviting all heads of state/heads of government of South Asian countries in his inauguration and on the second day on office he held bilateral talks with all of them individually which was dubbed as a mini SAARC summit by the media. Later during a launch event at ISRO he has asked Indian scientists to take the endeavour to develop a dedicated SAARC satellite to share the fruits of the technology like tele- medicine, e-learning etc. with the people across South Asia to complement the currently operating Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme program in the region. Bhutan Narendra Modi made his first foreign visit to Bhutan following an invitation by King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Tobgay. The visit was called by the media as a \\"charm offensive\\" that would also seek to check Bhutan-China relations that had recently been formalised. He also sought to build business ties, including a hydro-electric deal, and inaugurated the India-funded Supreme Court of Bhutan building. While talking about the visit, Modi said that Bhutan was a \\"natural choice\\" for his first foreign destination because of the \\"unique and special relationship\\" the two countries shared. He added that he was looking forward to nurture and further strengthen India's special relations with Bhutan. His entourage included Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh. He was further set to discuss the insurgency in Northeast India, and China. Nepal Modi in a meeting with the Prime Minister of Nepal Sushil Koirala. Modi chose Nepal as one of the first few countries to visit since he assumes office which signifies the importance of Nepal in the overall neighbourhood policy of the Modi govt. He visited Kathmandu on 3‚Äì4 August 2014, the first Indian PM to visit in 17 years, where he was received by the Nepalese PM himself at the airport going against protocol. The visit generated unprecedented enthusiasm among Nepali public and politicians as he addressed the constituent assembly of Nepal, first world leaders to do so, where pledged for US$1 billion line of credit to Nepal to support the infrastructure projects and said \\"Nepal can free India of its darkness with its electricity. But we don't want free electricity, we want to buy it. Just by selling electricity to India, Nepal can find a place in the developed countries of the world\\". He also told Nepali MPs he wanted to turn India's \\"hostile borders benign and ultimately gateways for free trade and commerce...borders must be bridges not barriers\\". The Kathmandu Post reacted in writing: \\"Modi mantra warms Nepal's hearts.\\" The Western medias too read it as a shift in foreign affairs for India, as well as a Nepal policy shift. The New York Times also suggested the lack of a meeting with former King Gyanendra signified that India would not support a return to monarchy despite the lack of a new constitution of Nepal. The bilateral talks were focused on reviewing the 1950s Treaty of Peace and Friendship, India-funded 'hydroelectricity projects' in Nepal and other infrastructure projects in Nepal and enhancing people-to-people contacts. The commonality of a majority Hindu heritage was also played up. He also participated in puja at the fifth century Hindu temple of Pashupatinath where he donated Rs. 25 crores and the head priest, Mool Bhatta Ganesh Bhatta, said: \\"I told him that we see him as a mascot for Hinduism, and appreciate his efforts in saving Hindu culture\\". Further he pledged not to interfere in Nepal's internal affairs (following controversy of appointment of Indian priests at a Nepali temple. Prior to Modi's visit, Swaraj made a three-day visit to Nepal from 27 July 2014 and co-chaired the Indo-Nepal Joint Commission meeting and also prepared the ground for Modi's scheduled visit. The last visit by a foreign minister of India to Nepal was made 23 years before this. Later the two sides signed the much awaited Indo- Nepal power trade agreement (PTA) which could not get signed earlier during Modi's visit due to technical problem in the draft agreement. This will allow Indian private and public sector investment in hydro power development in Nepal and future power trade and transmission to India. To attend his maiden SAARC summit Modi visited Nepal for the second time in 2014. Where he inaugurated an India funded high tech trauma-care centre as part of a goodwill measure and also flagged-off the Kathmandu-Delhi bus service. In order to deepen ties with the Himalayan neighbour Modi presented a HAL Dhruv advanced helicopter to the Nepalese armed force in a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Sushil Koirala. He also held bilateral talks with his Nepalese counterpart in Kathmandu where two sides inked 10 agreements and memorandum of understanding including important ones regarding power trade and transmission. Once again Modi urged Nepalese law makers to adhere the January 2015 dateline for Constitution writing on the basis of consensus to accommodate views of all sections of people but this time his comments were received with mixed responses. The Nepali daily Kantipur on its editorial remarked that Narendra Modi breached diplomatic Lanshman rekha (red line) by calling it an interference in Nepal's internal mater although the English daily The Kathmandu Post described it as a well-intended advice. Bangladesh There was scepticism during election campaign about Bangladeshi illegal immigrants in India which raised concern in Bangladesh but it was Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who made a remark: \\"I am delighted to see a great friend of Bangladesh leading an extremely friendly country, India, in the coming days.\\" following Modi's victory in the general election. And the new Indian govt too were quick to realize the immense geo-strategic importance of Bangladesh in India's security paradigm and therefore Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj chose Dhaka for her first stand-alone foreign visit on 26‚Äì27 June 2014, where she met her counterpart Abul Hassan Mahmood and also called on Sheikh Hasina. Discussions were held regarding the land boundary agreement (LBA), the proposed Teesta water sharing pact, cooperation in eliminating extremist groups from North- East taking refuge in Bangladesh and illegal immigration. And taking a lesson from the previous UPA govt experience Swaraj had discussed contentious issues of Bengal with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee before leaving for Dhaka, indicating a federal style of foreign policy. In September 2014 at the sidelines of United Nations general assembly Modi met Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for the first time in New York City. The two leaders have discussed mechanism to stop terrorist trespassing through the porous Indo-Bangla border and the stability of democracy in Bangladesh apart from regular water sharing and land boundary issues. Afghanistan The first challenge before the new govt had come from Herat, Afghanistan where the Indian consulate was attacked by the ISI backed terrorist organisation days before Modi's inauguration. Visiting the war-torn country on 10 September Swaraj called \\"India Afghanistan's first strategic partner\\". and has committed to play a greater role in capacity building by strengthening the Afghan National Army but sighed away from possibility of sending troops or direct export of military hardware from India instead according to an arrangement made earlier India would pay for purchase of arms and ammunitions from Russia. Potential re-emergence of the Taliban and al-Qaeda in the subcontinent following NATO withdrawal from the country by end of 2014 have raised concerns among Indian security establishments. Hamid Ansari, Vice-President of India attended the inauguration ceremony of new Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Abdullah Abdullah on 29 September 2014 in Kabul and the Indian side welcomes the move of new Afghan govt to sign bilateral security agreement (BSA) with the US which will eventually pave the way for around 10,000 US soldier to remain in Afghanistan beyond 2014 NATO withdrawal. India is also in the process of reviving an old agreement for modernising the Chabahar Port in Iran. This is to provide an alternative sea access to Afghanistan which will help further the Indian investment in the country and bilateral trade which is so far restricted by Pakistan's hostile transit policy through Karachi Port. Sri Lanka Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena at Hyderabad House Despite India being Sri Lanka's primary neighbour the India- Sri Lanka relations faced stagnation in the last decade due to several reasons including the large scale civilian casualties in civil war in the Tamil dominated north of the island country and a growing Chinese influence in Sri Lanka. Modi invited President Mahinda Rajapaksa to his inauguration in Delhi, overcoming domestic pressures from Tamil Nadu based political parties, in a bid to renew the ties. The primary concerns of New Delhi is the excessive Chinese investment and military presence in the island country strategically located off the South Indian coast. In fact in November 2014 a second nuclear powered Chinese submarine was allowed by the Sri Lankan authority to dock in Colombo Port despite India expressed its displeasure following a similar incident in September 2014 coinciding with the stand-off between PLA and Indian troops in the Chumar sector of Himalayas. Although later both Sri Lanka and China have clarified it as mere refueling and crew refreshment halt on the way to gulf of Aden as part of anti-piracy deployment. Things started changing however with the 2015 presidential election where Maithripala Sirisena, an old ally and Minister in the Rajapakshe's cabinet, defeated the veteran leader to become Sri Lanka's President. There were allegation of external factors (particularly India) involved in promoting the regime change in Colombo. On 9 January 2015 even before the formal announcement of election result, Modi became the first foreign leader to call and congratulate Sirisena on his victory. Sirisena's election is expected to balance the island's tilt toward China in recent years, who had earlier proposed a foreign policy catering Indian sensitivities. Sirisena chose India for his first state visit (15‚Äì18 February) signalling a fresh-start in the bilateral relations. During Sirisena's visit to New Delhi the two countries signed a bilateral civil nuclear agreement, which is believed to be for sending a strong message towards China. They also signed three more agreements which includes a tripartite maritime cooperation pact involving Maldives. Although one irritant remained with the new administration's go ahead of a US$1.4b Chinese project for developing a 'port-city' off the Colombo harbor undermining India's security concerns. Indian Prime Minister visited Sri Lanka at the invitation of President Maithripala Sirisena and concluded his two-day official visit on Saturday 14 March 2015. Modi's visit is the first time in 28 years that an Indian prime minister has visited Sri Lanka. Pakistan Modi has long been considered as a hardliner nationalist against enemy forces across the border sponsoring terrorist attacks in India while he was Chief Minister of Gujarat, a state bordering Pakistan, but post-election things have changed substantially when he decided to invite Nawaz Sharif in the swearing-in ceremony. Even his strongest critics could not resist to laud this initiative, Sharif and Modi had cordial discussion on 27 May 2014 day after Modi's inauguration where the two sides agreed to look forward with Foreign Secretary level talk to start with. But Foreign Secretary level talk scheduled on 25 August in Islamabad was called off last minute by India following Pakistani high commissioner's meeting with secessionist leaders from Jammu & Kashmir at high commission in Delhi. Which further jeopardized a potential Modi-Sharif meeting in New York at the sidelines of UNGA. Later External Affairs Minister Swaraj said that \\"there is no full stop in diplomacy\\" referring the future course of action in Indo-Pak relation. Meanwhile the two sides got engaged into an ugly gun-firing along the International border and the line of control as well with India accusing Pakistan of violating cease-fire agreement which had further damaged the already shaky bilateral ties. Later Pakistan tried to internationalize the issue by seeking United Nations intervention but the world body refused to interfere and asked the two party to settle the dispute. India accused Pakistan not following Simla Agreement where both sides agreed to resolve the Kashmir issue only through bilateral means. Now the two leaders will be in Kathmandu, Nepal to attend the 18th SAARC summit scheduled for 26‚Äì27 November. But experts anticipate the success of the upcoming summit depending upon how India and Pakistan will manage their differences. Maldives Maldivian President was one of the seven SAARC leaders to attend Modi's inauguration in Delhi. Strategically located in the Indian Ocean region Maldives plays critical role in India's maritime security architecture and being part of SAARC bilateral relations with Maldives become important as per the new neighbourhood policy. Foreign Minister Swaraj during her maiden trip to Male on 3 November 2014 held discussion with her counterpart Dunya Maumoon on bilateral and regional issues of mutual interests and also reiterated India's strong commitment towards prosperity, stability and security of Maldives. The two sides also plans to celebrate 50 years of establishment of bilateral relation. ;Drinking-water crisis in Male In the wake of a drinking water crisis in Male on 4 December 2014, following collapse of the island's only water treatment plant, Maldives urged India for immediate help. India came to rescue by sending its heavy lift transporters like C-17 Globemaster III, Il-76 carrying bottled water. The navy also sent her ships like , and others which can produce fresh water using their onboard desalination plants. The humanitarian relief efforts by the Indian side was widely appreciated in Male across all sections of people even the Vice-President of Maldives thanked the Indian ambassador for swift action.

Whatever the truth of the matter, years later when she was acting as Regent in England for William the Conqueror, she used her authority to confiscate Brictric's lands and threw him into prison, where he died.Edward Augustus Freeman, The History of the Norman Conquest of England, Vol. IV (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1871), pp. 761‚Äì64 Most of Matilda's landholdings, including Clovelly, descended to the Honour of Gloucester.Thorn & Thorn, Part 2 (notes), chapter 25 Feudal barony of Gloucester Brictric's lands were granted after the death of Matilda in 1083 by her eldest son King William Rufus (1087‚Äì1100) to Robert FitzHamon (died 1107),Round, J.

His mural monument survives on the south chancel wall of Clovelly Church, erected by his 2nd son and eventual heir George (who erected a similar one also opposite on the north chancel wall to his elder brother Sir Robert),Prince, p.189 inscribed as follows: :\\"In memory of William Cary Esqr who served his king and country in ye office of a Justice of Peace under three princes, Q.

The arms top centre are Cary; the arms top left and right are: Lozengy or and azure, a chevron gules (Gorges (modern)), for his second wife Dorothy Gorges (died 1622), mother of the erector of the monument. These arms were the subject of one of the earliest and most famous heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, Warbelton v Gorges in 1347. The final sentence in Latin Omnis Caro Foenum, is from Isiah 40:6 (\\"All flesh is grass\\") and is a pun on the name Cary, but was commonly used on monuments elsewhere, for example on the monumental brass coffin plate of Richard Duke (1567‚Äì1641) of Otterton, in Otterton Church, Devon.see :File:RichardDuke MargaretBasset Brass OttertonChurch Devon.JPG Sir Robert Cary (1610‚Äì1675) Mural monument to Sir Robert Cary (1610‚Äì1675), All Saints Church, Clovelly, north wall of chancel Sir Robert Cary (1610‚Äì1675), eldest son and heir, a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to King Charles II.

However that would have made him his father's eldest son and heir of Clovelly before his brother Sir Robert Cary (1610‚Äì1675), which was not the case. Vivian gives his date of birth as 1611. Prince, who transcribed his monumental inscription otherwise entirely accurately, appears to have deliberately mis-transcribed the last line as \\"MDCLXXX\\" (i.e. 1680) in place of \\"1680\\" and \\"LXIX\\" (i.e. 69) in place of \\"72\\"-1680), younger brother, was a Professor (Doctor) of Divinity, Dean of Exeter (amongst other duties responsible for the maintenance and decoration of the cathedral building) and Rector of Shobrooke in Devon. He was one of the Worthies of Devon of John Prince (died 1723).Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London He married Anne Hancock, daughter of William Hancock (died 1625), lord of the manor of Combe Martin, Devon, by whom he had numerous children.Vivian, p.441, pedigree of Hancock; given erroneously on p.159 as \\"John\\" Handcock (sic) He was educated at Exeter Grammar School and in 1628 entered Queens College, Oxford but later moved to Exeter College, Oxford, much frequented by Devonians. His first clerical appointment was by his father as Rector of Clovelly. Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, he was appointed Chaplain in Ordinary to King Charles II, after which he received the honour of a Doctorate in Divinity from Oxford University. At the bequest of the Lord Chamberlain he preached a Lent sermon before the king, for which was much thanked by the Archbishop of Canterbury.Prince, p.188 During most of his career he lived about 44 miles south-east of Clovelly, at Exeter, and at Shobrooke, near Crediton, 9 miles to the north-west of Exeter. Indeed it appears that until about 1702 Clovelly was occupied by his second cousins, the three brothers John Cary, George Cary (died 1702) and Anthony Cary (died 1694), sons of Robert Cary of Yeo Vale, Alwington,Vivian, p.158, refers to the brothers George Cary (died 1702) and Anthony Cary (died 1694) (sons of Robert Cary of Yeo Vale, Alwington) as \\"of Clovelly\\", and notes that the infant son of their eldest brother John Cary was buried at Clovelly near Clovelly. He rebuilt the rectory house at Shobrooke, which he found in a dilapidated state and made it \\"a commodious and gentile dwelling\\".Prince, p.188 He also rebuilt the \\"ruinous,...filthy and loathsome\\" Dean's House in Exeter, which during the Civil War had been let to negligent tenants by the See of Exeter, and \\"in a short time so well repaired, so thoroughly cleansed and so richly furnished this house that it became a fit receptacle for princes\\".Prince, p.189 As the Emperor Augustus with the City of Rome, so did Dean Cary with the Dean's House in Exeter \\"found it ruines but he left it a palace\\", as Prince suggests.Prince, p.189 Indeed King Charles II stayed there on the night of 23 July 1670, having visited the newly built Citadel in Plymouth. It was also the chosen abode of Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle, Lord lieutenant of Devon, for three weeks in 1675 and again during the Monmouth Rebellion. He was a liberal benefactor in assisting the Corporation of Exeter in the completion in 1699 of the cutting of a leat between Exeter Quay and Topsham, which fed into a pool which could shelter 100 ships. He twice refused offers of the Bishopric of Exeter made by King Charles II, on vacancies arising in 1666 and 1676. The reason for his first refusal, or profession of Nolo Episcopari, is unknown, but he refused the second time due to age and infirmity which would prevent him attending Parliament as would be required.Prince, p.188 He died at Shobrooke but was buried in Cloveely Church. His mural monument survives in Clovelly Church, erected by his eldest son Sir George Cary (1654‚Äì1685),Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, p.190, states it was erected by his second son William Cary (c. 1661 ‚Äì 1710), apparently incorrect on the basis of the armorials the armorials of the latter's two wives appearing on the top of the monument as follows: dexter: Azure, a chevron between three mullets pierced or (Davie of Canonteign, Christow); sinister: Or, a lion reguardant sable langued gules (Jenkyn of Cornwall).

Commercial tensions over the slavery Asiento granted to Britain by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, and alleged smuggling of British goods into the Spanish Americas led to the War of Jenkins Ear in 1739. This was followed by the War of the Austrian Succession, ended by the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In addition to the asiento, there was also a substantial import and export trade between Spain and Britain, carried out by British merchants based in Cadiz. Due to an error by negotiators at Aix-la-Chapelle, the treaty failed to renew their trading privileges, which were treated as cancelled by the Spanish. Both sides also claimed they were owed large sums of money in regards to the asiento. However, the trade through Cadiz was equally important to Spain, while Ferdinand VI, who succeeded as king in 1746, was more pro-British than his predecessor. This allowed the two sides to reach agreement on a new treaty, which restored trading privileges, while the asiento was cancelled in return for a one time payment of ¬£100,000 to the British. Background The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht awarded Britain limited access to the closed markets of Spanish Americas; these included the Asiento de Negros to supply 5,000 slaves a year and a Navio de Permiso, permitting limited direct sales in Porto Bello and Veracruz. The South Sea Company established to hold these rights went bankrupt in the 1720 'South Sea Bubble', and became a state enterprise, owned by the British government. Cover of the English translation of the Asiento contract, 1713. The heavy taxes imposed on all goods officially imported into Spanish America created a large and profitable black market for smugglers, many of whom were British. The asiento itself was marginally profitable and has been described as a 'commercial illusion'; between 1717 and 1733, only eight ships were sent from Britain to the Americas. The real benefit was that its ships were allowed to import goods customs-free. However, the Spanish tended to arrest any vessels caught with illegal goods, regardless of whether they were technically chartered by the South Sea Company, while other traders smuggled slaves, undermining the monopoly granted by the asiento. The result was a series of claims and counter-claims; by 1748, the British argued they were owed nearly ¬£2 million by the Spanish Crown, which claimed equally large amounts the other way. These commercial issues led to the outbreak of the War of Jenkins Ear in 1739, which became part of the wider War of the Austrian Succession in 1740, and the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle largely failed to remedy them. Although the asiento was renewed for four years, the South Sea Company had neither the desire or capacity to continue; of far greater importance was the import and export trade carried out by British merchants based in Cadiz. British goods were imported for re-sale locally or re-exported to the colonies, Spanish dye and wool going the other way; one City of London merchant called the trade 'the best flower in our garden.' Lord Sandwich, lead British negotiator at Aix-la-Chapelle, failed to include the Utrecht terms in the list of Anglo-Spanish agreements renewed in the Preliminaries to the treaty. When he tried to amend the final version, the Spanish refused to approve it, threatening the lucrative import and export trade between the two countries. However, both sides wanted to resolve the problem, since the trade was equally valuable to Spain, while Ferdinand VI was more pro-British than his French-born predecessor Philip V. Jos√© de Carvajal y Lanc√°ster, the Foreign Minister negotiated directly with Sir Benjamin Keene, the experienced British Ambassador to Spain; draft terms were agreed on 5 October 1749, it was not formally ratified until a year later. The asiento was cancelled and all claims settled in exchange for a payment of ¬£100,000 to the South Sea Company, the Cadiz merchants were allowed to resume operations, and Britain received favourable terms for trading with Spanish America. Provisions The Treaty contained ten separate articles: Article 1: Britain renounced its claim to the asiento and the Navio de Permiso; Article 2: Spain paid compensation of ¬£100,000, and in return, Britain cancelled any claim to further payments; Article 3: Spain also cancelled claims relating to the asiento and the Navio de Permiso; Article 4: British subjects would not pay higher (or other) duties in Spanish ports than those prevailing during the reign of Charles II of England; Article 5: British subjects would be permitted to gather salt at Tortudos, as they had in the time of Charles II, allowing them to resume fishing operations by using it to preserve fish exported to Britain; Article 6: British subjects would not pay higher duties than Spanish subjects; Article 7: Subjects of both nations would pay the same duties, when bringing merchandise into each other's country by land, as they would by sea; Article 8: Both countries would abolish all \\"innovations\\" that had been introduced into commerce; Article 9: Arrangements were made to integrate the Treaty into the existing treaty system; Article 10: An undertaking was made to execute the provisions of the Treaty promptly. Aftermath Settlement of these issues helped the Duke of Newcastle pursue his policy of improving relations between the two countries, while Keene helped ensure the appointment of a succession of Anglophile ministers, including Jos√© de Carvajal and Ricardo Wall. Although Keene died in 1757, while Charles III of Spain succeeded Ferdinand in 1759, as a result Spain remained neutral in the Seven Years' War between Britain and France until 1762.

According to the historian R. C. Majumdar, he was the first notable king of the Vardhana dynasty but the fourth ruler from the family, who are also referred to as the Pushpabhutis. He had been preceded by his father, Adityavardhana, grandfather Rajyavardhana I and great-grandfather, Naravardhana, but inscriptions suggest that Banabhatta, the seventh-century bard and chronicler of the Vardhanas, may have been wrong to call these earlier rulers kings and that they may instead have been mere feudatory rulers of minor significance. Prabhakaravardhana's father, Adityavardhana, had formed an alliance with Mahasenagupta of Magadha against the Maukhari dynasty. He was married to Mahasenagupta, who was probably the sister of this Gupta king who bore the same name. Through these arrangements he had much enlarged the family's estates. It is because of this territorial expansion that, while Adityavardhana bore the title of maharaja, his son was able to use the higher rank of maharajadhiraja. In turn, Prabhakaravardhana further extended Vardhana control, using aggressive tactics that resulted in him probably ruling over the Punjab and part of Malwa. Aside from defeating rulers in Gujarat, Gandhara and Sind, he also resisted the invasion of the Hunas, as reported by the 7th century writer BƒÅ·πáabha·π≠·π≠a.BƒÅ·πáabha·π≠·π≠a credits Prabhakaravardhana with a strong stance against the Hunas, describing him as:\\"A lion to the Huna deer, a burning fever to the king of the Indus land, a troubler of the sleep of Gujarat king, a billious plague to that scent-elephant, the lord of Gandhara, a destroyer of the skill of the Latas.\\", Ancient Indian History and Civilization by Sailendra Nath Sen p.253The Cambridge Shorter History of India p.105 The date of death of Prabhakaravardhana is variously stated: according to Majumdar, it was in 604 CE but some sources, such as the military historian Kaushik Roy, say 606 CE, and others state 605. He was married to Yasomati, who became sati. Prabhakaravardhana and Yasomati had three children. Their eldest son, Rajyavardhana, succeeded to the throne and was in turn succeeded by the younger son, Harsha; their daughter, Rajyashri, married Grahavarman of the Maukhari dynasty that ruled Kannauj.

At around the time of its founding, Millman became the director of CAP. Millman served as director of CAP for 30 years. In his role at CAP, he oversaw the efforts to assist private lawyers representing the more than 700 people on California's death row. He had a close, direct relationship with the California Supreme Court for more than 25 years in his role as the Executive Director of CAP.

He was Booker T. Washington's closest adviser at the Tuskegee Institute. He was responsible for maintaining Washington's nationwide \\"machine,\\" with its close links to the black business leadership, white philanthropists, and Republican politicians from the local level to the White House. After Washington job he lost his Tuskegee connection but moved to Washington as Special Adviser of Black Affairs to Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Scott was the highest-ranking African-American in President Woodrow Wilson's administration. After 1919, he was less and less visible in national affairs, with the NAACP taking the leadership role that Booker T. Washington had dominated. Biography =Early life and education= Emmett Jay Scott was born in Houston, Texas in 1873, the son of former slaves Horace Lacy Scott and Emma Kyle. He began his studies at Wiley College in 1887, but left 3 years later to pursue a career in journalism. =Journalism= Scott worked at the white-owned The Houston Post as a janitor before working his way up to messenger and eventually reporter. He and friends knew that the city's African-American community was not receiving adequate coverage. Scott joined Charles N. Love and Jack Tibbitto in founding Houston's first African-American newspaper, the Texas Freeman. Scott became editor soon after the newspaper began circulation. His leadership expanded the Texas Freeman's presence in the Houston region, making it a prominent publication throughout Texas. =Tuskegee Institute activities= In Houston Scott promoted Booker T. Washington, who was developing the Tuskegee Institute. Washington was impressed and in 1897 hired Scott as his personal secretary, publicity chief and top advisor. Scott had a major role in management of the college, fundraising, and building Washington's national networks of black businessmen and white philanthropists. Indeed he was known as the ‚ÄúArchitect of the Tuskegee Machine.‚ÄùSmith, \\"Emmett Jay Scott,\\" 1998. On the side Scott was a real estate investor with ties to the banking and insurance industries. He was a founder of the National Negro Business League in 1900 and served as Secretary of that organization from its establishment until 1922.Robert A. Hill (ed.), The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers: Volume 1: 1826-August 1919. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1983; pp. 173-174, fn. 1. In 1909 Scott was tapped by President William Howard Taft as one of three American commissioners to Liberia. Scott served as Secretary of the Tuskegee Institute from 1912 until 1917. Scott was also selected as Secretary of the International Congress of the Negro, a conference hosted by the Tuskegee Institute in 1912. Although he was heir apparent to take the helm as principal of Tuskegee Institute following Washington's death in 1915, the trustees passed over Scott to name Robert Russa Moton, formerly of the Hampton Institute, to the position. =Liberia= Scott at the docks, New York City, 1909 Scott reported as part of a group sent to the country from the U.S. government. He worked with Booker T. Washington and took his place after Washington determined travel to Liberia would take him away from his other work for too long. =World War I activity= After the election of President Woodrow Wilson, as the United States moved closer to war, Scott was appointed as Special Assistant for Negro Affairs to the Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Scott was the highest-ranking African-American in the administration. He selected William Henry Davis to serve as his own assistant and staff manager, helping to ensure blacks were treated fairly by the War Department. In June 1918 Scott organized a meeting of African-American journalists and business leaders to recommend a Black journalist to the U.S. War Department for reporting on the Negro troops in World War I. Ralph Waldo Tyler was selected to report on the Black troops at the front, and he became the first African-American foreign war correspondent. Tyler's reports were screened by the U.S. Committee on Public Information, then they were reviewed by Scott. He selected letters to be syndicated through the Black press. After the war, Scott wrote his own history of this period, Scott's Official History of the American Negro in the World War (1919) featuring a preface by Secretary Baker and foreword by General John Pershing. =Later career= After leaving the War Department in 1919, Scott was named Secretary-Treasurer of Howard University, a position he held until 1933, at which time the Treasurer position was split off. He quarreled with the president and was forced out in 1938, Scott was active in Republican politics as a liaison with the black community. He served as an advisor to the public relations staff for every Republican national convention from 1928 through 1948. He was a paid assistant publicity director of the Republican National Committee 1939 to 1942. During World War II, Scott was director of employment and personnel relations for Shipyard No. 4 of the Sun Ship Co. in Chester, Pennsylvania. He was a joined who served on many committees, such as the United States Liberian Commission. He also authored several books. https://books.google.com/books?id=LtvEAQAACAAJ&dq;=\\"Emmett+j.+Scott\\"&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjbvufd9LnZAhUJgK0KHcPOD_QQ6AEIKTAA Morgan State College has a collection of his papers. His letters to various parties are a valuable historical resource cited in many works. Historian Eugene Berwanger argues that Scott was in line to succeed Booker T. Washington as the nation's leading African-American spokesman after Washington's death in 1915. Scott failed to take advantage of that opportunity and instead the NAACP filled that leadership role. Scott's visibility gradually faded out, apart from black educational circles. Berwanger suggests the cause was in large part because he insisted on adhering to Washington's accommodation philosophy and refused to support issues popular in the Black leadership community, especially national anti-lynching legislation. He lacked Washington's optimism and drive and broad vision, instead Scott demonstrated expertise in public relations when Washington called the tune, but was unable to take the initiate after Washington was gone.Eugene H.

Biography House was born a slave in Rutherford County, near Nashville, Tennessee. At the age of 22, she married William House. They had six children, five of which survived. After William died, House supported her family by being a washerwoman. National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty, and Pension Association House and Isaiah H. Dickerson traveled ex-slave states to gather support for the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association (MRB&PA;). They visited black churches‚Äîone of the few places blacks could organize without white interference. MRB&PA; was chartered August 7, 1897, with the goal of providing compensation to ex-slaves, mutual aid, and burial costs. At its peak, it claimed membership in the hundreds of thousands. Despite lack of evidence, the federal Post Office Department accused slavery reparation organizations like MRB&PA; of frauding their members. In 1899, the MRB&PA; was forbidden to send mail or cash money orders. The Department of Justice opened an investigation of the MRB&PA.; In 1901, Dickerson was found guilty of \\"swindling\\" but the conviction was later overturned. Upon Dickerson's death in 1909, House became the leader of the MRB&PA.; Despite interference with mails, the MRB&PA; struggled on under House's leadership. The US Postal Service's accusations of fraud culminated in 1916 with House's arrest and subsequent sentencing to one year in prison in Jefferson City, Missouri. House's arrest dampened the national reparations movement, which struggled on through local branches until the 1930s.

He is best known for his arrangements of Negro spirituals, many of which he performed as accompanist for Paul Robeson, performing on piano and singing harmony. Early life Lawrence was raised by his father, Clark Benjamin Brown, and his stepmother, Cenia Brown. Lawrence's birth mother died when he was three years old. Clark and his father were formerly enslaved. Education and early career Brown's first music teacher was William Riddick, and was sent to study his principal instrument, piano, in Boston, Massachusetts. He worked as an elevator operator to make up for the costs his scholarships did not cover. He made is debut as a concert accompanist for tenor Sydney Woodward, and from there was discovered by tenor Roland Hayes, with whom he toured from 1918 to 1923, including a performance at Buckingham Palace in 1921. While in England, he attended Trinity College for advanced training, where he received education in composition from Amanda Aldridge. In addition to piano and vocal arrangements, he performed string arrangements with cellist Beatrice Harrison at Wigmore Hall. Folk songs and spirituals Following the publication of some of his arrangements of Negro spirituals in James Weldon Johnson's Book of American Negro Spirituals, Brown published his own Negro Folk Songs in 1930. His arrangements were performed by Paul Robeson in concert in 1925 at the Greenwich Village Theatre, and he continued a professional relationship and friendship with Robeson for the next 40 years, Brown accompanying Robeson in concert during tours of Show Boat, with Brown harmonizing with his tenor voice. They toured internationally, including in Paris, London, Ireland, for the King of Spain and the Prince of Wales. Recordings with Paul Robeson Robeson and Brown recorded many of Brown's arrangements on RCA Victor Records, including \\"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\\", \\"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\\", and \\"Joe Hill\\". \\"Ballad for Americans\\" was an international success for the team. The two toured together with the USO during World War II. Brown did significant research for Robeson's projects, and actively sought folk music from around the world. He was frequently contacted by conductors seeking obscure folk music. He also had relationships with writers Lloyd Louis Brown and Langston Hughes. His friendship with Robeson and his wife, Eslanda (\\"Essie\\") Cardozo Goode Robeson, was challenged when Paul was blacklisted. Brown retired in 1963 after Robeson's career ended. Personal life Brown never married, and lived in Harlem for the last 47 years of his life. Saint Martin's Episcopal Church in Harlem honored Brown with a memorial concert in February 1973.

It was built between 1923 and 1924 and was designed by Frederick Walters. It is situated on the London Road, to the north of the town, next to The Atrium Shopping Centre. It is a Grade II listed building. History =Foundation= In 1869, a priest, Fr Thomas Purcell would come from Aldershot, to say Mass for the local Catholic population in various people's houses. For the next four years, Catholics would travel to St Joseph's Church, Aldershot for Mass. On 25 January 1873, a site was bought for ¬£120 for a school. In 1874, a priest, Fr McKenna, was permanently appointed to serve the Catholics in Camberley. In 1879, Lady Southwell gave a plot of land, the present site, for the construction of St Tarcisius Church. In 1884, a temporary iron church was built to accommodate the congregation. In 1888, the priest's house was built and in 1896 the school was expanded.History from CBParish.co.uk. Retrieved 6 February 2015 =Construction= In 1906, Fr Patrick Twomey came to Camberley and started to plan to build a new permanent church. On 12 September 1923, the foundation stone of the church was laid by the Bishop of Southwark, Peter Amigo. On 18 November 1924, the church was opened. The church was designed by Frederick Walters as a War Memorial for fallen British Catholic military officers in the First World War. It served as the chaplaincy for Catholics at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. On 26 June 1926, the church was consecrated by Cardinal Francis Bourne. In 1935, stained-glass windows, designed by Paul Woodroffe, were installed in the church. Architecture =Exterior= There is a tower on the north west side of the church and the church is made of Bargate stone. The top of the tower is crenellated and there is a porch under the tower. There is a traceried window above the entrance. The transepts are gabled and also have traceried windows. Above the chancel is a five-bay traceried window. =Interior= There are memorial plaques made of marble in the porch. The nave has a pine ceiling. The arcade in the nave and the arches inside the transepts are made of Bath stone. The original pews, made of oak, that were installed when the church was built, are still present. Parish Since 2007, the church has been part of the parish of Camberley & Bagshot along with Christ the King Church in Bagshot and St Peter & St John Church in Old Dean, so the Mass times of the churches do not conflict. St Tarcisius Church has Sunday Mass at 9:15 am, Christ the King Church has its Sunday Mass at 11:15 am and the Sunday Mass for St Peter & St John Church is on Saturday afternoon at 5:30 pm.

The party was opposed to NATO membership from the 1980s until its 2012 conference.  Background  Members of the SNP have long been divided on the party's long-standing opposition to NATO membership, which began in the early 1980s. Gordon Wilson tried to persuade the party to adopt a pro-Nato stance in 1983, but failed. The first signs of a policy change appeared in April 2012, when it emerged the party's policy-making national council would be considering their position at its June meeting. A University of Strathclyde poll carried out in May found that 52% of SNP members surveyed wanted to remain in NATO, and it was reported in June that the SNP leadership had decided to change their position following talks with Denmark and Norway, which are full NATO members. Afterwards, two SNP MPs Angus Robertson and Angus MacNeil sought to formalise this position by submitting a motion to the SNP conference in October 2012 which included the line: \\"An SNP Government will maintain NATO membership subject to an agreement that Scotland will not host nuclear weapons and NATO continues to respect the right of members to only take part in UN sanctioned operations.\\" By August, SNP leader Alex Salmond faced rebellion from party MSPs. The party had already begun advising MSPs to avoid speaking about NATO in public, but a number went on to send amendments to conference backing continued NATO opposition.  2012 conference debate  Map of NATO member states in 2012 (shown in blue) At the party's Autumn conference in Perth on 19 October 2012, the SNP hosted an open debate on their policy towards NATO. Much of the debate was broadcast live on TV by the BBC. The party leadership, including Salmond, backed the pro-NATO side. A number of MSPs opposed the policy change. Grassroots activists also took part in the debate, with high-profile figures like Natalie McGarry arguing against a policy change. After the debate, SNP members voted 426-332 to overturn their policy of opposition to NATO.  Aftermath  MSPs John Finnie and Jean Urquhart immediately resigned from the SNP over the policy change. Fellow MSP John Wilson was initially persuaded to keep the party whip, but resigned after the subsequent Scottish independence referendum defeat. The youth wing of the SNP, Young Scots for Independence, opposed the change in party policy \\"on the basis that [NATO] is a nuclear alliance\\". This opposition was reaffirmed in 2016.

The media also referred to them as the Blood Brothers. Their arrests and subsequent trial stemmed from their connection with an incident known as the Little Fruit Stand Riot, which was followed twelve days later by an attack on a couple who owned a used clothing store in Harlem: Margit Sugar was fatally stabbed, and her husband Frank Sugar was injured. The Harlem Six were Wallace Baker, Daniel Hamm, William Craig, Ronald Felder, Walter Thomas, and Robert Rice. All but one of the men were eventually released. Robert Rice remains incarcerated, serving a life sentence. The Little Fruit Stand Riot On April 17, 1964, a fruit stand was knocked over and the owner blew a whistle to stop children taking his spilled fruit. The whistle alerted members of a special tactical patrol stationed in various basements throughout the community. The children tried to run away, but were beaten by the police. Several adults attempting to intervene were also beaten. Frank Stafford, a black salesman, sought to halt the attack and was battered so severely that he lost an eye. Frank Stafford, Wallace Baker, and Daniel Hamm were all taken to the hospital following the riot. The owner of the fruit stand told police that Wallace Baker and Daniel Hamm had nothing to do with the fruit stand incident. They had only been involved in their attempt to protect children from the brutality of the police. Murder of Margit Sugar, stabbing of Frank Sugar, and arrests On April 29, 1964 Margit and Frank Sugar were stabbed in their used clothing store. They were both taken to the hospital, but Margit Sugar did not survive and died from the stabbing. Frank Sugar survived after receiving emergency surgery. Four individuals whom police identified at the scene of \\"the Little Fruit Stand Riot\\" were taken in for questioning (Perlstein‚Äôs Justice, Justice claims three of the six). Along with the members , Robert Barnes was taken in, as was Wallace Baker, who had been recently released from Harlem Hospital. Daniel Hamm, William Craig, Ronald Felder, Walter Thomas, and Robert Rice, all teenagers, were also arrested. The NAACP found the case too controversial and assembled a defense team to handle the trials of those arrested, including William Kunstler who would later become famous for arguing for the defendants of the Attica Prison riot. The judge, reading from a precedent established in 1901, decided that \\"indigent paupers, such as these boys, and most Negroes now appearing in white courts can have no part in selecting the counsel authorized to be assigned to him by the court and paid for by the county.\\" The teenagers were assigned public defenders they neither wanted nor trusted. The teenagers went so far as to ask their mothers to request different lawyers than had been assigned to them. An investigative article by the New York Times claimed a connection between the Fruit Stand Riot and militant bands of anti-white youth gangs \\"trained to maim and kill\\" and \\"roam the streets of Harlem attacking white people.\\" While awaiting trial, the Harlem Six were regularly beaten by guards. The prison elevators would be stopped between floors so the guards could administer beatings and seek confessions. Some of the court-appointed lawyers urged the defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges, leading the defendants to claim to the judge that they could not get justice in \\"white man‚Äôs court.\\" After that statement, the judge sent the accused to a mental hospital to question their sanity. Court case and retrial In March 1965, the court case begins for the Harlem Six. The Harlem Six were found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Three years after the conviction prominent black civil rights lawyer Conrad Lynn along with William Kunstler and others mounted an appeal. The convictions were reversed, and new trials were ordered. The court overturned the convictions of the six defendants because the confessions of two of the defendants had been obtained and used at their first trial in violation of constitutional standards. Two of the original six were tried separately and found guilty again. The other four went on trial in February 1971. The trial ended with a deadlocked jury and so the judge declared a mistrial. Bail was set at $75,000 for each defendant. The men could not afford the bail, and at this point had spent eight years in prison. Ultimately, all but one of the men were found not guilty. Robert Rice was again convicted of first degree murder on May 7, 1970, and is currently still incarcerated. Response from community Malcolm X, in his autobiography, documents his response when a young doctor asked him if he knew that press in New York City was upset about a recent killing in Harlem‚Äîfor which many were blaming him, at least indirectly. Malcolm informed the man that he had not heard of the incident, but that none of the violence came as a surprise to him. When he returned to New York, he was confronted by press, but seized it as an opportunity to excoriate white supremacy and the pervasiveness of racism in America. Ossie Davis and James Baldwin, among other Black artists and activists played a role in the release of the Harlem Six. James Baldwin's piece \\"A Report from Occupied Territory\\" outlines the racial tensions surrounding the arrest and trial of the Harlem Six.

He was a leading figure in the development of Britain's distinctive school of political science. Political historians have cited his influential works on representation, the British government, federalism, nationalism, and national integration extensively.  Early life  Birch was born in North London and attended the William Ellis Grammar School in Gospel Oak.\\"Lord Trevor Smith pays tribute to Anthony H. Birch\\" After graduating from William Ellis Grammar School, he earned an economics degree at the University College, Nottingham graduating with first class honors in 1945. He was unable to serve in the Second World War due to poor health. After the war, he joined the Board of Trade as an assistant principal and remained there for two years. His passion for scholarship motivated him to enroll in the London School of Economics to pursue a PhD. under Harold Laski. His doctoral work was a comparative study of federalism and public finance in Canada, Australia, and the United States. He obtained his doctorate in 1951. Shortly thereafter, he was awarded a scholarship from the Commonwealth Fund to pursue further studies in the United States as a Harkness Fellow at Harvard University and the University of Chicago. He subsequently revised his dissertation and it was published in 1955 in his first book: Federalism, Finance and Social Legislation in Canada, Australia and the United States (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955).  Academic career  Birch took up his first teaching position in 1947 at the University of Manchester, first as a lecturer in the Economics Department, and later in the new Department of Government, established by W.J.M. (Bill) Mackenzie.International Political Science Association: https://www.ipsa.org/news/news/anthony-harold-birch-1924-2014 In 1959, he published his second book, Small Town Politics: A Study of Political Life in Glossop (London: Oxford University Press), a study of local politics in a town located in Derbyshire. The study was influenced by the contemporaneous studies of local power politics in the United States. The book viewed Glossop as a microcosm of wider changes in British politics and society in the 1950s. In a review of this work, the American Robert A. Dahl, a pioneer in studies of community power politics, wrote: \\"Anyone interested in the political life of modern communities will find this a useful book, and an American will not be disappointed in his search for significant parallels and differences\\".Robert A. Dahl, Review of \\"Small Town Politics,\\" American Sociological Review (1959) 24: 723-24 This work cemented Birch's reputation as a creative and eclectic scholar. In 1961, Birch worked at the University of Hull in the new Department of Political Studies. While working in the department, he appointed a number of young scholars, many of whom went on to have influential careers as political scientists, including: Robert Benewick, Robert Berki, Howard Elcock, Dennis Kavanagh, Stephen Kirby, Michael Leifer, Jeremy Noakes, Bhikhu Parekh, and (Lord) Trevor Smith.Lord Trevor Smith pays tribute to Anthony H. Birch While at Hull, Birch published what has become his most widely cited work, Representative and Responsible Government: An Essay on the Constitution (London: Allen and Unwin, 1964). This text examines the tensions between responsibility and representation in the Constitution in the British historical tradition and in 18th and 19th century political thought. 'The book is about governmental theory but its conceptual framework never gets between the reader and the examples. It could be given painlessly to relative beginners, but raises issues in a way which could spark off the more advanced student'.Geoffrey Marshall, Review of \\"Representative and Responsible Government,\\" Political Studies (1964), 12: 268-69. In a review of this book, Geoffrey Marshall stated: \\"Professor Birch's book is of a kind which is rare and extremely useful\\". Bhikhu Parekh commented that it is: \\"Pioneered a way of looking at democracy, combining both abstract theory and political rhetoric\\".Bhikhu Parekh, \\"Tribute on death of Anthony H. Birch: http://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/professor-anthony-h-birch-1924-2014 In 1967, Birch published his third book, The British System of Government (London: Allen and Unwin, 1967, first edition), which became essential reading for anyone looking for a concise overview of the operation of British political institutions in the late 20th century and was republished in 10 editions. In 1970, Birch became chair of the Politics Department at Exeter University. During this decade, his focus shifted to questions of nationalism and regional integration, a relevant issue at the time when the question of the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales was at the forefront of political attention. In 1971, Birch published another widely read text, Representation, a brief introduction to the key concept of representation (London: Pall Mall Press and Macmillan, 1971). He published Political Integration and Disintegration in the British Isles (London: Allen and Unwin) in 1977. That year, he moved to Canada, and took up a position as professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Victoria on Vancouver Island, British Columbia where he worked and taught until his retirement in 1989. It was in Victoria where he wrote his final two works, Nationalism and National Integration (New York: Routledge, 1989) and The Concepts and Theories of Modern Democracy (London: Routledge, 1993) which was republished as a third edition in 2007. By this time, Birch was well into his 80s. Birch's approach to political science was wide-ranging. He worked across many of the divisions in the field, including those that separate \\"theory\\" from empirical work, \\"domestic\\" from comparative politics, or \\"science\\" from engaged political commentary. His eclectic approach is apparent from the wide range of theoretical and empirical subjects upon which Birch wrote articles and reviews within the major political science journals, including World Politics,Anthony H. Birch, \\"Minority Nationalist Movements and Theories of Political Integration,\\" World Politics (1978) 30: 325-344 the British Journal of Political Science,Anthony H.

He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1988, and was the recipient of the prestigious Sir Isaiah Berlin award for Lifetime Contribution to Political Studies from the Political Studies Association in 2002.Political Studies Association, 50th Anniversary: http://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Awards2000.pdf Birch died in Victoria on December 13, 2014 at the age of 90.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-anthony-birch- political-scientist-and-noted-authority-on-the-workings-of-government- democracy-and-britains-constitution-10092280.html On the day of his death, several former colleagues paid tribute to his work. Robert Benewick commented that: \\"Tony Birch's Representative and Responsible Government along with Samuel Beer's Modern British Politics were perhaps the most influential commentaries on British politics published in the 1960s. They challenged the more quantitative and behavioral approaches that were beginning to dominate political science\\". Lord Trevor Smith praised him as: \\"one of the most productive and innovative British political scientists in the past sixty years. Although widely read and respected, he never received the recognition that he merited. Invariably his publications were pioneering; he was a true lateral thinker\\". Wyn Grant described him as: \\"One of the pioneering figures in the establishment of an academic discipline of politics in Britain\\".

Construction of Tims Ford Dam on the Elk River began in 1966 and was completed in 1970. Graves were relocated to the New Awalt Cemetery on the ridge, and all persons living in Awalt were displaced. All structures were removed before the filling of the lake which took nearly two years. Several roads which are now used as boat access ramps were once roads down into the town of Awalt which sat in the bottom of a hollow in one of the lowest points of the current lake.

It is also known as the starry-eye parrotfish, stareye parrotfish, bucktooth parrotfish, Christmas parrotfish or marbled parrotfish. Description Female specimen The species is about long. The species changes its appearance greatly during the transition to adulthood. Juveniles of the species are typically a mottled orangish-brown, with some pink shading. Adult males of the species are shades of blue or green, and have pink lines radiating from their eyes. Adult females are mottled brown and their eyes bulge out slightly. Its jaws consist of pebble-like teeth fused into a beak for eating seaweed, but in juveniles the teeth are not yet fully fused and are visible on the outside of the dental plate. Distribution Calotomus carolinus has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution from the coast of East Africa, although not in the Red Sea where it is replaced by Calotomus viridescens, through the Indian Ocean to the eastern Pacific Ocean around the Revillagigedo and the Galapagos Islands. Habitat and biology Calotomus carolinus can typically be found as a single fish or in small groups, in shallow reefs or lagoons. It occurs in subtidal reef flats, lagoons and seaward reefs down to depths of , or more. Within the wider habitat this species can be found in areas of coral, rubble, seagrass and weeds. It feeds on a variety of benthic encrusting algae, Padina and seagrasses. It is a protogynous hermaphrodite and it may have no initial phase males and there might only be terminal phase males. Naming and taxonomy Calotomus carolinus was first formally described as Callyodon carolinus in 1840 by the French zoologist Achille Valenciennes (1795-1865) with the type locality given as the Caroline Islands. When Charles Henry Gilbert described the genus Calotomus in 1890 he designated Calotomus xenodon as its type species, thinking that the genus was monotypic, this was later shown to be a synonyms of C. carolinus.

The mode of operation of the activists is to film offenses and their conversations and confrontations with offenders and subsequently edit and upload the gathered footage to video-sharing websites such as YouTube.The official YouTube-channel of the organization. One of the popular strategies is to place big stickers with the phrase \\"I spit on everyone, I park where I want\\" (), attributed to the 'Federal Programme Against Arrogance on Roads', on car windshields of non-cooperative traffic offenders. The name of the organization derives from the Russian slang term —Ö–∞–º (kham), referring to a boor or lout but more abusive; a person who behaves in a crude disgusting way without respect for him/herself or others; the closest English term would be scumbag. The term is a reference to the Biblical Ham. A number of incidents involving activists of the movement have garnered significant public attention. On 21 March 2016, by the Moscow City Court's decision the organization was liquidated. However, on 2 September 2016, the Supreme Court of Russia cancelled the decision. History The project was founded in 2010 as one of the federal programs of the Nashi youth movement that existed in the NASHI-2.0 project, under the leadership of movement commissar Dmitry Chugunov. In July of the same year, the project was first presented at the Seliger forum and verbally approved by Russian Minister of Internal Affairs Rashid Nurgaliev. The main goal of the public movement is the fight against traffic violations and neglect of others by its participants: parking in the wrong place, seizing urban land for parking lots, using sidewalks to travel by car, etc. Activists are looking for improperly parked cars that interfere with others, and, if there is a driver in the car, they turn to him with a request to park the car in accordance with traffic rules. in case of refusal or in the absence of a driver, a round sticker with the text \\"I don't care about anyone, I can park wherever I want\\" is glued to the windshield of a car with a passenger or driver‚Äôs, and often to the side or rear windows. The process, which is often accompanied by insults and attempts by drivers to fight with activists demanding to stop the offense, is filmed on video media (telephones, cameras), after which the project activists mount videos and upload them to the Internet: on YouTube, VKontakte and on the official website of the movement. On May 31, 2014, the project manager of StopHam, the commander of the Nashi movement Dmitry Chugunov, in the direction of developing public control, was elected a member of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation of the 5th composition, having received 21,883 votes in Internet voting.Chugunov Dmitry Alexandrovich candidate for membership of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation of the 5th compositionNames of winners of the 5th Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Chugunov, direction for the development of public control Subsequently, the project management was temporarily assigned to his supporter Kirill Bunin, but at the moment Chugunov again returned to the post of direct supervisor. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has repeatedly evaluated the actions of StopHam activists. According to this assessment, the actions of the StopHam activists can be regarded as a violation of applicable law and fall under the responsibility stipulated by the articles of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation: 7.17 (destruction or property damage) 19.1 (arbitrariness) 20.1 (hooliganism) The Minister of Internal Affairs of Karelia Vasily Kukushkin also notes that activists film their actions and post reports on the Internet without the consent of car owners, which \\"may carry signs of a crime under Article 137 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation\\" Violation of privacy ‚Äù.Ministry of Internal Affairs of Karelia: StopHam actions can be regarded as hooliganism and property damageStopHam is allowedStopham activists officially recognized as hooligans. We put them in jail? = Liquidation of a legal entity = The StopHam civil society organization promoting cultural cooperation in civil society was liquidated on March 21, 2016 by a decision of the Moscow City Court at the request of the Ministry of Justice. During federal state control, the State Department revealed repeated gross violations of the law in terms of reporting in the organization‚Äôs activities, after which in 2015 it applied to the Moscow City Court with a statement on the liquidation of the organization and the deletion of information about it from the Register of Legal Entities. On October 12, 2015, the court granted the claims of the State Institution. The decision was not appealed. In this regard, in the manner prescribed by applicable law, information about the organization 03/21/2016 was excluded from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities.

The conflict ended in a brawl, during which Madina and Islam Mingaev tried to force operators to destroy the record, and also threatened them and their families with physical harm. However, the record hit the Internet, and as of April 2014 has been viewed on YouTube more than seven million times. Scandal erupted, criminal case on hooliganism was instituted. On May 5, 2012, Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov officially announced the dismissal of Mingaev in connection with the unacceptable public actions of his wife. However, Kadyrov also condemned the actions of the activists of the movement, calling them ‚Äúprovocative‚Äù, and did not comment on the actions of Islam Mingaev. * In April 2013, activists blocked the car of a 24-year-old Margaret Arakelyan, consultant to the legal department of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, at the moment when the girl was trying to park at a pedestrian crossing on Maroseyka Street. After verbal bickering, Arakelyan directed her car at the activists, almost crushing one of them. After that, the traffic violator got out of the car and rudely announced that she had the right to park the car at the crossing. At the same time, the activists were threatened with troubles if compromising videos were published. Nevertheless, the video was published by news agencies, which entailed the apology of the head of the Central Election Committee of the Russian Federation Vladimir Churov. * In July 2013, StopHam activists blocked the Range Rover car on the sidewalk, driven by Tatyana Smoryakova, the acting head of the Maryino District Council. Smoryakova brought down two activists and continued to move in a traffic jam. To the requests of the traffic police officers to stop, Smoryakova refused and laid out the prefecture's pass on the dashboard. Alexander Smoryakov, who arrived at the scene of an accident at the request of his wife, wrote a statement on a minor cyclist standing on the sidewalk and accused him of hitting himself. Arriving parents of this cyclist wrote a counter statement to give false evidence. The traffic police drew up a report on Tatyana Smoryakova on the fact of collision with pedestrians. The prefecture of South-Eastern Administrative Okrug later published an official statement that the prefecture does not issue permits for any right to the privileged movement of personal vehicles, and that issues related to the personal behavior of family members of civil servants are not related to the activities of the prefecture. The day after the conflict, Alexander Smoryakov submitted his resignation from his post as head of the district, which was accepted by Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin. *In mid-October 2014, StopHam activists became accomplices in the fight against organized demolition of garages in the Timiryazevsky district of Moscow associated with the construction of a 35-story elite residential complex ‚ÄúDIHANIE‚Äù. So, one of the district's Garage Complexes underwent mechanized demolition by people in balaclavas without prior warning. Activists who came to the defense were brutally beaten and injured as a result of the use of pepper spray. Chugunov himself received six injuries and was hospitalized. According to the final data, the Garage Complexes were demolished. *On February 10, 2015, seven StopHam activists were brutally beaten and robbed by a group of people who arrived at the crime scene in four cars in St. Petersburg. The incident occurred near the house number 26/1 on Dachny Avenue. As a result of the attack, activists needed medical attention, and three of them - two young people and one girl - were hospitalized with moderate injuries. The attack was filmed on camera by a nearby car. On that fact, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of St. Petersburg opened a criminal case under Part 2 of Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. *On February 26, 2016 in Petrozavodsk, as a result of the StopHam raid, one of the drivers on whose car the project sticker was pasted attacked activists with a knife, wounded one in the shoulder, and then fled the scene. The police quickly detained a suspect who, having traveled a short distance, tore the sticker off the windshield with the same knife. On the fact of the attack on the activist, a criminal case was instituted under part 2 of article 115 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation: ‚ÄúIntentionally causing minor harm to health from hooligan motives‚Äù.

Most of the French Army of the Rhine had retreated to the west bank of the Rhine River, leaving the division of Antoine Laroche Dubouscat to hold Mannheim on the east bank. Despite assistance by Michel Ney, Laroche's division was beaten and driven out of the city when attacked by Charles and a much superior force. The War of the Second Coalition action occurred in the city of Mannheim, located in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in southwest Germany about south of Frankfurt. In the summer of 1799, Muller's 18,000-man army had the mission of drawing Charles' Austrian army away from Switzerland, the central and western portions of which were held by Andr√© Mass√©na's army. Moving south from Mannheim, the Army of the Rhine laid siege to Philippsburg. Provoked by this threat to his strategic rear, Charles and 30,000 troops moved north against Muller, who quickly withdrew. Muller erred in leaving Laroche to be mauled by Charles, but his campaign became a strategic success when Mass√©na severely defeated a Russian army at the Second Battle of Zurich on 25 and 26 September. Background On 4 June 1799, the First Battle of Zurich was fought between Andr√© Mass√©na's 45,000-strong Army of the Danube and a 53,000-man Austrian army led by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. Austrian casualties numbered 2,400 and eight guns while the French lost 4,400 men and 28 guns. Though the French held their ground, Mass√©na evacuated Z√ºrich the next day and withdrew to a strong position overlooking the city. Altogether, Mass√©na commanded 76,781 troops. In Switzerland were infantry divisions under Claude Lecourbe (1st), Joseph Chabran (2nd), Jean-de-Dieu Soult (3rd), Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge (4th), Jean Victor Tharreau (5th), Fran√ßois Goullus (6th), Joseph Souham (7th) and Louis Marie Turreau (Valais), a cavalry division under Louis Klein and an infantry reserve under Jean Joseph Amable Humbert, plus occupation troops. The 6th and 7th Divisions were supervised by Pierre Marie Barth√©lemy Ferino while Lecourbe controlled the 1st and 2nd. Included in Mass√©na's command were Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand with 6,186 men and Claude-Sylvestre Colaud with 5,106 men watching the Rhine north of Strasbourg. Opposed to the French were 85,000 troops led by Charles, including a force watching the French divisions on the Rhine to the north and eight battalions under Gottfried von Strauch near the Saint Gotthard Pass in the south. Archduke Charles The Army of the Rhine was formed on 5 July 1799 by Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, who was the Minister of War. The army was responsible for an area along the Rhine River from Neuf- Brisach on the south to D√ºsseldorf on the north, including the fortresses of Breisach, Kehl, Strasbourg, Landau, Mannheim, Mainz, Ehrenbreitstein and Luxembourg.Phipps (2011), p. 112. The French reported the strength of the army as 40,000 to 60,000 men, but this was a ruse to trick the Austrians. In fact, much of the army's strength was tied up in garrisons and it is unlikely that the number of troops available for field operations exceeded 18,000.Phipps (2011), p. 113. The purpose of the Army of the Rhine was to lure the Austrian army away from Mass√©na. This could be achieved by menacing Archduke Charles' supply line, which ran northeast from Switzerland to Ulm on the Danube River. The army was too weak to fight the Austrians in a pitched battle, but it was enough of a threat that it could not be ignored.Phipps (2011), p. 114. Meanwhile, an Austro-Russian army under Alexander Suvorov had cleared most of Italy of its French occupiers. In the Battle of Novi on 15 August 1799, the Allies suffered 8,200 casualties, mostly Austrian, but chased the French army back into its last narrow slice of Italian territory near Genoa. During this time, the Austrians were very successful in reducing the French-held fortresses in Italy. By 11 September, the only Piedmont fortress that remained in French hands was Cuneo.Duffy (1999), p. 126. At this time there was a major change in Allied strategy which apparently originated with William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, the British foreign minister. According to the plan, Suvorov was to march north into Switzerland with 20,000 Russians to join 45,000 newly arrived Russians under Alexander Korsakov near Z√ºrich. These soldiers would be assisted by 18,000 Austrians led by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze. Meanwhile, the British agent William Wickham would raise an army of 20,000 Swiss. The mostly-Russian force was supposed to invade France across the Jura Mountains. As soon as Korsakov's army was situated, Charles was to move north into southern Germany with 60,000 Austrians and invade France across the upper Rhine. Tsar Paul I of Russia and Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor approved this plan and issued the necessary orders which arrived at Charles' headquarters on 7 August. In fact, the archduke was reluctant to carry out the plan, since he believed that splitting up the Coalition armies was a mistake. In the end, bad timing ruined the new scheme; Charles would leave Switzerland too early and Suvorov would arrive in Switzerland too late.Duffy (1999), pp. 150‚Äì154. However, Archduke Charles was not quite finished with Switzerland. The Austrian general tried to gain a bridgehead across the Aare River at D√∂ttingen. Success here would drive a wedge between Mass√©na's left wing and his center, compelling the French commander to withdraw from his position facing Z√ºrich. On the morning of 17 August, Charles massed 35,000 troops and battery of 40 cannons opposite his intended crossing place. The Austrians were favored by good luck because Mass√©na was visiting his right wing that day and the defending 5th Division was under a temporary commander, √âtienne Heudelet de Bierre. Also, there was an early fog to hide the bridge builders from French view. As it happened, Michel Ney was nearby and by noon he and Heudelet assembled 12,000 men in the vicinity. The Austrian engineers blundered by selecting a poor site for their bridge and there was no covering force to protect the crews from French snipers. By 6:30 pm the effort failed and the Austrians asked for a truce so they could take up their bridge, which Ney granted. On 22 August, Ney transferred to the Army of the Rhine.Phipps (2011), pp. 117‚Äì118. Campaign and Battle Marshal Michel Ney At the end of August 1799, Army of the Rhine was organized into three infantry divisions under Colaud, Antoine Laroche Dubouscat and Jean Fran√ßois Leval and a cavalry reserve led by Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul. On 24 August a review was ordered at Oggersheim but it rained and the troops got drenched instead. It was rumored that the review was a cover for Muller's chief of staff Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers to carry out on a raid to Frankfurt in order to mulct the city for funds. The 6,000 troops allotted to this mission were drawn from all the infantry divisions. Hilliers would rejoin the army at Heidelberg. On the 25th Ney came to the army as a freshly-minted general of division. Muller created an advance guard of 1,400 infantry, 200 cavalry and three field pieces for Ney.Phipps (2011), pp. 122‚Äì123. Map of Mannheim and vicinity showing the siege works of 1795 On 26 August 1799, Muller's 18,000-strong army moved out with Leval's division marching south through Schwetzingen, Colaud occupying Wiesloch and Sinsheim, Laroche on Colaud's left and Hautpoul bringing up the rear. Ney was reinforced by a cavalry regiment and sent out ahead up the Neckar River valley where he seized Heilbronn on 29 August and Lauffen am Neckar on the 30th. A false report caused the army to retreat on 1 September, but the advance soon resumed. Ney's patrols reached Ludwigsburg. Leval's division invested Philippsburg and its 2,239-man garrison. The French threatened to burn down the town unless it surrendered, but its governor Count Salm refused, saying if his enemies captured the town all they would get would be its ashes. The bombardment started on 6 September. The French were also opposed by an Austrian force led by Anton Szt√°ray which was supplemented by a local militia that its commander Count Albini styled the \\"German National Guard\\". These partisans later managed to recapture Frankfurt.Phipps (2011), p. 124. Archduke Charles was loath to get too far from Mass√©na and hovered near Donaueschingen for a while. However, the Austrian general began to move north when Philippsburg was attacked. On 5 September reports came in from Hautpoul's cavalry and infantry brigadier Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen that Charles was coming closer.Phipps (2011), p. 125. Though Philippsburg had only been under siege for a few days, the French inflicted 94 casualties on the garrison of Philippsburg and caused serious damage to its defenses. Nevertheless, Muller abandoned the siege and began falling back on Mannheim. By 13 September, most of the Army of the Rhine was safely on the west bank of the Rhine. Leval's division covered the northern stretch between Worms and Koblenz, Colaud was south near Speyer and Ney defended the river between them with a newly formed division composed of six elite companies, one infantry regiment and three cavalry regiments. In a remarkable mistake, Muller left Laroche's division at Mannheim on the east bank. Laroche understood very well that his division was badly exposed. He would have liked to defend the position of Neckerau but it had no bridge, while Mannheim had a bridge. He finally turned to Ney for advice, who suggested moving the bridge to Neckerau. On 18 September, Charles with 22,000 troops assaulted Laroche who had only 5,200 soldiers. Even so, the French resisted stoutly. Ney brought some of his troops to help, but the Austrians overran Neckerau on Laroche's right and drove for the bridge. In the end, the Austrians almost managed to cross to the west bank by the bridge, but were finally stopped.Phipps (2011), p. 126. According to another source, the archduke had 18,000 soldiers available. The regular foot soldiers forming the Austrian force included the Bojakowsky, Fitz-Gibbons, R√ºffer, Sebottendorf and Tegetthof Grenadier battalions, three battalions each of Infantry Regiments Archduke Ferdinand Nr. 2, Archduke Charles Nr. 3 and Oliver Wallis Nr. 29 and two companies of Carl Schr√∂der Nr. 7. The Grenz Infantry contingent was made up of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of Broder Nr. 7 and the 1st Battalion of Deutsch-Banater Nr. 12. The cavalry consisted of six squadrons each of the Kaiser Cuirassier Nr. 1, Lothringen Cuirassier Nr. 7, Anspach Dragoon Nr. 11, Kinsky Dragoon Nr. 12 and V√©csey Hussar Nr. 4 Regiments.Smith (1998), p. 166. Results Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers At Mannheim, the French sustained losses of 1,600 killed and wounded, while their enemies captured 1,900 soldiers, 23 artillery pieces, 20 vehicles and two colors. Austrian casualties numbered 1,300 killed, wounded and missing. Ney was bruised in two places, by a case shot on his left leg and by a musket ball in the chest. Laroche's division was nearly destroyed. Recriminations soon followed. Hilliers wrote to Bernadotte blaming Muller for retreating without a pitched battle. Decaen was another critic of Muller for advancing too slowly. Both Ney and Laroche were \\"disgusted\\" at having been left in the lurch. In fact, Muller's 18,000 were considerably outnumbered by Charles' 30,000 or more and it would have been foolish to risk battle. Muller successfully fulfilled his mission as a decoy in drawing Charles away from Switzerland.Phipps (2011), p. 127. Friedrich von Hotze Korsakov left Russia in May 1799 and arrived at Z√ºrich with 29,463 men and 60 guns. The Russians irritated their allies by boasting that where the Austrians posted one battalion, they only needed one company. On Korsakov's right was Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf with 5,400 Austrians near Basel while Hotze was on his left with 23,000 Austrians holding the line of the Linth River. On Hotze's left was Franz Jellacic with a force near Chur. Seeing Charles move away from Switzerland, Mass√©na prepared to strike with 49,098 troops.Phipps (2011), pp. 128‚Äì129. On 25 September, Mass√©na defeated Korsakov in the Second Battle of Zurich. The French suffered 4,000 casualties but inflicted losses of 6,000 killed and wounded on the Russians. The French also seized 2,000 prisoners, 26 guns, 407 wagons and 10 colors. On the same day, Soult launched a surprise crossing the Linth River and defeated Hotze who was killed. Soult's force sustained 1,100 casualties while capturing 3,500 Austrians and allied Swiss, 20 guns, 33 munition wagons, two colors and many supplies.Smith (1998), pp. 167‚Äì168. By the end of the day, the Russians had been driven back into Z√ºrich. When news arrived of Hotze's defeat and death, Korsakov panicked and ordered a retreat to the north the next day.Phipps (2011), p. 134 Hotze's successor Franz Petrasch also abandoned the area between Lake Zurich and the Rhine.Phipps (2011), p. 139. On 24 September Suvorov's column seized the Saint Gotthard Pass from Lecourbe's troops and entered Switzerland from the south.Duffy (1999), pp. 171‚Äì172. As soon as he disposed of Korsakov and Petrasch, Mass√©na turned to deal with Suvorov. After a remarkable campaign in the Alps, followed by a harrowing march across Panix Pass in which some of the survivors were \\"spitting blood\\", Suvorov's Russian army escaped the French. On 21 September, 21,285 Russians began the campaign and by 8 October their reported losses were 3,884. Since several units never submitted returns, the actual losses were probably closer to 4,400.Duffy (1999), pp. 257‚Äì258. Unhappy with Muller, the French government appointed Lecourbe the new commander of the Army of the Rhine on 25 September 1799. Since Lecourbe was fighting Suvorov at the time, Massena did not release him until early October. Muller desired to get away from the army, so the temporary command was offered to the senior general Colaud, who refused it. Finally, Ney reluctantly accepted the acting command.Phipps (2011), p. 164.

It was built in the eighteenth century by the Grankowscy family. History The construction of the palace was initiated by Francis Jerome Granowsky some time prior to 1735 and was completed by his son, Casmir Granowsky, in 1756. It had many owners, most importantly John of Nepomuk, who in the 1820s replaced the late Baroque window frames with Classical ones, and decorated the first floor living room with molding divisions. A hundred years later, in the interwar period, further renovation took place. The roof truss that had been damaged in the First World War was rebuilt. As a result, the roof silhouette dropped significantly, negatively impacting the visual composition of the building. In 1930, a driveway that ran in front of the building and was covered by a first floor terrace supported by columns was replaced with a balcony supported by simple corbels. Moreover, the balcony in the garden was replaced with a terrace supported by Tuscan columns. After the end of the Second World War, the palace was converted into a high school. During that time, the granary was used as a boarding house for students and for illegal tenants who dwelled in the coach house and stables. In 1965 the building was converted into a summer camp for the children of the workers of Lodz's Industries. At the beginning of the 1990s a major renovation of the palace founded by the Regional Conservation Office and local authorities began. This renovation was interrupted in 1995 when the legal heirs to the building began an effort to reclaim their ownership. Design  The palace was designed in the late Baroque style. It consists of one story of plastered brick, built in a rectangular plan, with three avant-corps that protrude slightly above floors. It is topped by a mansard roof covered with sheet metal. The central front avant-corps is crowned with a semicircular gable. The garden has a semicircular avant-corps, crowned with a semicircular Baroque attic. The wall is flanked with columns on both sides decorated with conifer cones. The two avant-corps on both sides of the front of the palace extend far beyond the fa√ßade. The fa√ßades are stressed by vertical plaster strips. Only in the garden does the central avant-corps have decorative Ionic pilasters. The palace interior is divided into two sections: a hallway with a staircase and a living room. Interwar period During the interwar period, two buildings stood on both sides of the palace driveway. On the western side stood a two-story granary with thick walls, probably a remnant of the court belonging to the previous owners of the property. The stables and a coach house were on the eastern side of the driveway.

The group is directed by founder, writer and director Azeem Hamid. It is the youngest theatre company in continuous production to have performed both internationally and domestically from Pakistan. Since their inception, the group has performed over twenty-five theatrical productions. The group primarily performs in Urdu language but has also done theatrical productions in English and Punjabi languages. They have extensively focused on the revival of Urdu literature in Pakistan. Independent Theatre Pakistan aims to work for the development of youth in Pakistan through the creative and performing arts. Independent Theatre Pakistan have produced original theatrical productions such as Awaaz (literal translation: Voice), a psychological thriller play and the satirical short-play Kuttay (literal translation: Dogs). Also, they have adapted the works of progressive South Asian writers like Saadat Hassan Manto, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Krishan Chander, Imtiaz Ali Taj, Ashfaq Ahmed and Meerza Adeeb. History =Formation (2012)= Manto's Hatak (Insult) directed by Azeem Hamid at Alhamra Arts Council, Lahore, in 2012 The company was founded in 2012 by Azeem Hamid and Danyaal Syed and now operates all across theatres in Lahore: Alhamra Arts Council and Ali Auditorium (for classical Urdu & Broadway plays and musicals) and different educational institutes (for theatre workshops & short plays). Their first theatrical production Hatak (literal meaning: Insult), featured fashion model and actress Zara Peerzada in the lead role, was based on the short-story of famous Urdu writer Saadat Hassan Manto, staged in November 2012 at Alhamra Arts Council and received positive reviews from critics. This was followed by the group collaborating with Beaconhouse School Liberty for a theatrical performance Dareecha, based loosely on the writings of the play Qurtaba Ka Qazi written by Imtiaz Ali Taj. =Early years (2013)= In 2013, the group initiated their year with two short-length plays; Dastak (The Knock), a play written by Meerza Adeeb and an original, Awaaz (Voice), in collaboration with Lahore Grammar School, the latter winning two-awards at Colors & Humour 2013 for the best actress & supporting actor roles. This success was later followed by a sold-out performance of Ashfaq Ahmed's tele- play stage adaptation Fehmida Ki Kahani, Ustaani Rahat Ki Zubani in March, the performance was praised by many literature writers including Ayub Khawar. The group went on to perform Rajinder Singh Bedi's classical satire Naql-e-Makani (Moving to a New House) from 4th till 6 October, which was well received by critics and the audiences. In the same month, Azeem Hamid directed Kuttay, a satirical performance based on the writings of Nadeem F. Paracha's article Dog Gone as a mock to society. The performance won the Imtiaz Ali Taj award at a festival held in Lahore, Pakistan. =International success (2014‚Äì2015)= The following year, it produced several performances, which included Jhelum Mein Naupar (The Sailing Boat in Jhelum) featuring stage actress Amtul Baweja and an adaptation of Reginald Rose's famous film Twelve Angry Men as Twelve Angry Jurors at different venues in Lahore. In summers, the group went on their first international tour at the 2nd International SPIC MACAY Convention held in Chennai, Madras, India where they collaborated with Koodiyattam master Margi Madhu from the Chakyar clan for the classical Sanskrit theatre performance of Anguliyankam (The Golden Ring) in June 2014.

Visible from left to right: Faizan Naveed as \\"Nasir\\", Namwar Ayaz as \\"Zamaan\\" and Zoya Uzair as \\"Shireen\\". In December, the company went on to produce their best known theatrical performance Kamra No. 9 (Room No. 9) a radio play written by Saadat Hasan Manto and directed by Azeem Hamid. The performance was well received by critics and audiences, the Daily Times wrote \\"Kamra #9 ... mystery musical is an example of Urdu theatre at its finest.\\" Shoaib Ahmed of Dawn Newspaper wrote \\"The 60-minute three-act play had such a strong production value that it kept glued the audience to their seats till the end. The literary piece was deeply and meaningfully tailored for the play.\\", while during an interview to The Express Tribune, director Azeem Hamid said, \\"Visualising and creating a 1930s Delhi feel for a radio play was an immense challenge; we walked around Jalander, India to get inspiration for Kamra #9‚Äôs set design.\\" The Mani-Nama blog reviewed the performance saying, \\"The set was quite modest- a realistic one with an old radio, telephone and chairs. After sometime I witnessed some quality lighting which was done by Shakeel Siddique, who literally set the pace of play with classic lights.\\" and The News on Sunday wrote, \\"Kamra #9 provided insight into human complexities.\\" Aleeza Rasool, writer and critic, of Youlin Magazine reported praising the performance as she wrote, \\"Firstly, a radio play by Manto was a refreshing choice, for it is one of the lesser-known genres that Manto composed during his brief lifetime. Secondly, the play was very well-acted, and most importantly, the direction was even-tempered, making the play engaging.\\", adding that, \\"It is unusual to come across the genus of anticipation and suspense in Pakistani stage plays, which is why Azeem Hamid, actor and director of the play, deserves a pat on the back for putting up a wonderful performance on Manto‚Äôs radio play.\\" After the success in Pakistan, the company went on to perform Kamra No. 9 in West Bengal, India to promote peace between the two bordering nations. During an interview with The Telegraph, \\"For the past few years, the theatre and cultural activists have been protesting in various ways against fanaticism, trying their best to educate people in rural areas, organising workshops in schools and colleges and staging street theatres. We were hopeful that a peaceful atmosphere would gradually emerge. The Peshawar killings have come as an eye-opener,\\" Zoya Uzair, who played the lead role of 'Shireen', said. The company's director Azeem Hamid received an 'Address of Honour' from MLA Ajoy Dey of the Santipur Municipality for staging and directing Kamra No. 9 in West Bengal.

The Pakistan Today reported that 3 Kahaniyan received a mixed reception from critics, while Faizan Javed of The Nation praised the performance writing \\"The immediate response of the audience determines the quality of play being stage. And when it comes to social message for the audience the impact is everlasting. The play 3 Kahaniyan being staged at Alhamra Hall on Mall Road is an example.\\" =Rise to fame (2016)= In March, the company produced the theatrical adaptation of Neil Simon's farcical play Rumors, which was praised and supported by well known celebrities and film stars like Agha Ali, Cybil Chowdhry, Poonam Anwar, Rachel Gill and comedian Ali Sufian Wasif. The performance was a sold-out show. Soon after, team members from the company participated and lead a delegation to 4th International Convention of SPIC MACAY held in IIT Guwahati, Assam, India. In September, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences hosted a three-days theatrical workshops program called 'Dramaship', which featured lectures from the group team members including Azeem Hamid and Faiz Rasool. The objective of the workshop focused to gather talented students at a single platform and develop their theatrical skills so that they can explore and learn basic concepts of theatre in a new medium to translate their expression. On 20 October, Hamid announced that the company will be directing and producing three full-length comedy theatrical performances which includes Arsenic and Old Lace, Run for Your Wife and Around the World in 80 Days. In an interview with Daily Pakistan, \\"I‚Äôm excited and looking forward to November.

Jam-packed audiences were delving deeply into the story, and the suspense & humour was one to not have missed.\\" In December, the group founded the ASSITEJ Pakistan National Center in alliance with professionals involved in theatre for children and young people in Pakistan, with the aim of hosting a performing arts festival the following year in Lahore. =Continued success (2017‚Äì2018)= The Odd Couple directed by Azeem Hamid at Ali Auditorium, Lahore, in 2017.

There was nothing but a garden with a hut. But then it was a significant experience in my life and I learnt a great deal from it. We should appreciate the young talent because these young people are our future\\". The Nation newspaper reported on the second day of Tamasha Festival, saying \\"thought provoking panel discussions explored the creativity to entertain and educate children...What‚Äôs theatre for children?

The session held at Alhamra Arts Council - Hall 1, highlighted the importance of theatre and arts for children. Director of Polyglot Theatre, Sue Giles said that through theatre, we achieve an opportunity to present space and time to subjective experience and nourish the child‚Äôs brain power. ‚ÄúThe idea of ‚Äòvalue for money‚Äô is another issue how people perceive the place and power of children in our midst. We neglect our children's physical freedoms we once had,‚Äù Sue added. While the session ‚ÄòSociety and Drama‚Äô highlighted the issues of theatre industry in both countries Pakistan and Korea.

The drama follows from Shaw's longstanding need to reimagine Shakespeare's work, epitomised by his play Caesar and Cleopatra and his late squib Shakes versus Shav. Creation The play was written \\"as a lark\\" after the committee of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre were looking for a way to market a staging of Cymbeline as part of a plan to fund a memorial to Shakespeare.Lenker, Lagretta Tallent, Fathers and Daughters in Shakespeare and Shaw, Greenwood, 2001, p.174. The ending of Cymbeline had been ridiculed in the nineteenth century, but the play was just beginning to be reconsidered as an \\"experimental romance\\".Hart, Jonathan, Shakespeare and His Contemporaries, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011, p.170. Shaw was consciously engaging in a long tradition of rewriting Shakespeare for modern values and tastes. Shaw had expressed the standard Victorian view of the play in 1896 when he wrote that it was \\"stagey trash of the lowest melodramatic order\\". After altering the ending, Shaw changed his mind about the bulk of the play, but remained convinced that the last act was a disaster, writing in 1946 that it was \\"one of the finest of Shakespeare's later plays\\" but \\"goes to pieces in the final act\\". Plot Shaw removed many of the revelations that accumulate in the final act, cutting its length by more than half.Bernard F. Dukore, Bernard Shaw, Playwright: Aspects of Shavian Drama, University of Missouri Press, 1973, p.212 He minimises the discovery that Polydore and Cadwal are Imogen's long lost brothers. In the end they decide to return to rural life in Wales rather than join the royal court. The deus ex machina scene in which Jupiter descends from the heavens is also dropped. Shaw removes the implausible account of the British victory over the Roman legions, which in the original is achieved purely by the superhuman heroism of Posthumus, Polydore and Cadwal. He replaces it with a conversation in which the Romans discuss the possibility that the Britons recalled Belarius, a general who \\"knew his job\\", to command their forces. Shaw also makes Imogen a much more assertive figure, in line with his feminist views. He creates a scene in which Iachimo confesses to Posthumus. Imogen recognises Posthumus' voice and actively uncovers his identity. After Posthumus repents, she continues to point out the immorality of his actions, and resents the suggestion that she should accept her husband back unconditionally, but in the end accepts that \\"I must go home and make the best of it, as other women must.\\" 89 lines of the original play were retained in Shaw's version. Critical views Paradoxically Shaw offered his own alternative ending as challenge to producers to restore Shakespeare's original, which had been crudely cut in many productions. The act is written in blank verse, but C.B. Young notes that there is \\"a violent change of tone from the fairy-tale and romantic atmosphere of the original acts to the Shavian wit with a touch of cynicism, of the end.\\"Young, C. B (ed), Introduction, Cymbeline, Cambridge University Press, p.liii. Bernard F. Dukore says that \\"Shaw's refinishing of Cymbeline's last act reveals such features of Shavian comedy as his typical treatment of exposition; his focus, not on the resolution of a situation, but on the response of the characters to that resolution; and broad comedy with a realistic base.\\" References Category:1937 plays Category:Plays by George Bernard Shaw Category:Adaptations of works by William Shakespeare ","title":"Cymbeline Refinished"},{"id":"45334947","text":"In algebraic geometry, a Newton‚ÄìOkounkov body, also called an Okounkov body, is a convex body in Euclidean space associated to a divisor (or more generally a linear system) on a variety.

May-Rychter was born in Regensburg, Bavaria, in 1864; the daughter of Henry von May, who held an appointment of personal physician for Prince of Thurn and Taxis. During her childhood, Karl Theodor, Duke in Bavaria brought the physician and his family to Munich, where she was educated by Catholic nuns and went on to study at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. There, Nikolaos Gyzis was one of her teachers. Known unofficially as May-Rychter (May was Anna maiden name) she was the long- term partner of Polish artist, Tadeusz Rychter. The two did not marry because the Catholic Church did not recognize divorce and Tadeusz had been previously wed, to Cracovian artist Bronis≈Çawa Janowska.

The film is noteworthy for its inception as a class project and for using student interns from John Paul the Great Catholic University as a majority of the production crew.  Plot  Terrified subway passengers fight for their lives after a terrorist bombing leaves them trapped underground in Los Angeles' subway tunnels. With another bomb ticking down and the perpetrator among them, it's a race against time for survival.  Cast  * Nicole Gale Anderson as Tori * John Billingsley as Sam * Kunal Sharma as Al * Kevin Sizemore as Jared * Joe Williamson as Mason * Mark Saul as Boyd * Keena Ferguson as Rubina * Renee Sly as Dillon * Kym Jackson as Kristine * Anna Maganini as Yolanda * Jamie Nieto as Adam  Production  =Pre- production= Red Line began as a \\"real-world experience\\" senior project for film students at John Paul the Great Catholic University. In 2010, producers Chris Riley and Dominic Iocco, both professors at the University, challenged the school's film students to generate story concepts that could potentially be filmed in the school's soundstage. The staff knew that they wanted it to be a contained space thriller due to limited budget and resources. Screenwriting student Tara Stone pitched a World War II period thriller about people who are trapped together in a wine cellar during the London Blitz and begin to suspect that a Nazi spy is among them. Upon the advice of Chris Riley and director Rob Kirbyson, also a professor at the school, the script was changed during the writing process to become a contemporary piece set in the subway system of Los Angeles. The change was both to reduce costs and to make the piece more relevant to modern audiences. Leveraging the faculty's connections in the film industry, the students and professors then recruited professional crew to head up various departments, including Beverly Holloway for casting, Toby Lamm for the makeup department, David Barnaby for sound design, and Glen Hall for production design. Nicole Gale Anderson signed on as a lead actress, accompanied by John Billingsley. = Filming = Filming of Red Line occurred over 25 days in summer 2011. While the movie incorporated on-location shooting at Hollywood and Highland subway station, most of the film was shot in a 1,200 square foot soundstage at John Paul the Great Catholic University's initial campus in Scripps Ranch, San Diego, California. The film was noteworthy for using a large number of students from the University as production crew; about 60-70% of the school's 120 student population were involved in some way. When it came to building the set of a bombed out subway car and tunnel, the project was able to maintain a low budget by using students and faculty for all of the construction labor.  Release  Red Line premiered at the San Diego Film Festival on September 29, 2012, where it won the U-T San Diego Award. Red Line received a domestic release in July 2013, through DVD and digital distribution. The film was released in Red Box on July 9. The film became available to purchase on DVD at Walmart, Target, and Amazon on July 23. It also became available on Netflix and various Video on Demand channels in domestic and international markets. The film received an MPAA rating of \\"R for some violence.\\" Reception Nav Qateel of 1nfluxMagazine said, \\"the direction by Robert Kirbyson was also solid, as he managed a decent pace, keeping it interesting and edge-or-your-seat from pretty much the getgo, not letting up till the very end,\\" and called it \\"a fine example of what can be achieved by small studios on a budget, when they are determined enough to get the job done.\\" References External links  Category:2012 films Category:2012 thriller films Category:American films Category:American thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Student films Category:Rail transport films Category:Underground railways in fiction Category:Films about terrorism Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in San Diego ","title":"Red Line (2012 film)"},{"id":"45335045","text":"Joseph Edmund Sterrett (June 17, 1870 - March 22, 1934) was an American accountant, known as one of \\"accountancy's most active pioneers\\"Merino, Barbara Dubis. \\"Joseph E.

Accessed 06.02.2015.  Biography  Born in Brockway, Pennsylvania to minister Ezekiel Sterrett and Martha Jane McCurdy Sterrett, Sterrett started working for a coal company in Beechtree, Pennsylvania at the age of 17, and moved into accountancy work. In 1899 he obtained his Certified Public Accountant license for the state of Pennsylvania. At the age of 21 in 1891 Sterrett joined the public accountancy office of John W. Francis, where he became a partner in 1893. Their firm Francis & Sterrett merged into Price Waterhouse & Co. in 1907, whereby Sterrett became and remained senior partner. Sterrett was member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and served as its president from 1908 to 1910, its treasurer from 1919 to 1922, and its counsel member in 1916-18 and 1927-33. He was also one of the founding members of the Pennsylvania Institute of CPAs in 1897, where he also served in several functions. Since the 1910s Sterrett was involved in public serves for the Federal Government, started with his participation in the Commission on Economy and Efficiency in 1911 and in the Excess profits tax during World War I. Merino (2014) summarized that \\"his work after World War I would bring him international recognition. In 1920 he set up the administration of the Repatriation Commission in France. In 1924 he was called back to Europe, where he spent two years as the American member of the Transfer Committee that managed reparation payments under the Dawes Plan. He received decorations from four countries, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy, for his work on this committee.\\"Barbara D. Merino \\"Sterrett, Joseph Edmund (1870-1934)\\" in: M. Chatfield & R. Vangermeersch (eds.) History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia: An International Encyclopedia. (2014). p. 563-4  Work  = Professional ethics, 1907 = In the 1922 article Ethics of Accountancy, Edward P. Moxey explained, that the subject of ethics for the accountant is one which has engaged the attention of the members of that profession for quite a number of years. In fact, the subject was one of those presented before the Congress of Accountants, meeting at St. Louis in September, 1904. Prior to that time, however, definite rules of professional conduct had been formulated by the accounting societies of England for their members. In the latter part of 1905 a bill was introduced into Parliament by the Government of Tasmania for the regulation of the profession of accountancy. This bill made mention specifically of certain actions on the part of accountants which were to be regarded as unprofessional, and the practice of which should render them liable to fine, suspension or expulsion.Edward P. Moxey, Jr. \\"Ethics of Accountancy,\\" in: Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. Vol. 101, The Ethics of the Professions and of Business (May, 1922), pp. 196-202 Moxey (1922) further told, that at the Convention of the American Association of Public Accountants (now American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) held at St. Paul, Minnesota, in October, 1907, Sterrett presented a paper on \\"Professional Ethics\\" which became the standard treatise in the decades to come. This paper was characterized at that time by Robert Hiester Montgomery, as one \\"which bids fair to become a classic.\\" Sterrett called attention to the fact that the older professions of law and medicine had even at that time (1907) made considerable progress in the development of systems of professional ethics, and called attention also to the work being accomplished along that line by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. In measuring the distinction between the accountant as a member of one of the newer professions, as contrasted with the lawyer or physician, Sterrett stated: > A lawyer's real opinion of another lawyer, or that of one physician > concerning another, is usually a much more accurate judgment of the man's > character and ability than is indicated by the reputation which he bears in > the community at large. > It may be that the opinion of the public and that of those who know the man > from the inside, as it were, will coincide. This is likely to be the case > with men of good ability and fine character, but the sham and the trickster > are likely to be weighed and labeled by their professional brethren long > before their real character is discovered by outsiders. > Under ordinary circumstances regard for the good name of his profession > seals the lips of the professional man about matters concerning others in > his own profession. The physician considers it quite unethical to pass harsh > judgment upon his brother physician, except under the most urgent > conditions. As accountants endeavoring to build up professional ideals, we > should feel that the good name of -our profession requires us to avoid all > needless reference to the weaknesses or imperfections of other > accountants.Sterrett (1907, cited in Moxey (1922) Moxey (1922) commented, that while since that time there have been more or less serious infringements of the rules of ethics as laid down for the guidance of accountants, yet these have been dealt with fairly and impartially by committees on professional conduct of the American Association of Public Accountants and of its successor, the American Institute of Accountants. The work of these committees has always tended towards the improvement and development of the profession, to the end that there shall be a recognition on the part of its practitioners as well as on the part of the general public, that all who are its members not only are those of high professional attainment, but those in whom the moral ideal exists in more than name only. In recognition of Sterrett's contributions to the accounting profession, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants recognizes donors who give $1,000 or more to the Pennsylvania CPA Foundation with the Joseph E. Sterrett Award. The Pennsylvania CPA Foundation's mission is to inspire students to pursue a career in accounting and provide educational, motivational, and financial support to those looking to earn the CPA credential. https://www.picpa.org/cpa-foundation/ways-to-donate  Selected publications  * Sterrett, Joseph Edmund.

Founded in 1908 from the amalgamation of three older Japanese Anglican seminaries it has trained more than 600 lay and ordained graduates for work in the Anglican Church in Japan. History Prior to the formal opening of the college in 1912, graduate level study and clergy training in the Anglican Church in Japan was divided between three separate schools; the Trinity Divinity School in Tsukiji, Tokyo established by the Episcopal Church mission in 1877; the CMS sponsored Holy Trinity School in Osaka in established in 1884 and the SPG sponsored school at St. Andrew's Church, Shiba Koen, Tokyo established in 1886. The idea of a central theological college in Tokyo to train all Japanese clergy was first mooted by Bishop William Awdry. Initial funding for the college came from a grant approved at the Pan-Anglican Congress held in London in 1908. The first buildings of the college were located at Ikebukuro opposite the main campus of Rikkyo University. The intention being that students would spend three years in the college department of the university studying a broad liberal arts curriculum, and then three years focused on ministry training in the theological college. Initial staffing of the college was drawn from the ranks of the Episcopal, SPG and CMS missions each contributing one overseas missionary and one experienced Japanese clergy. The first college Principal was the Rev. John Toshimichi Imai. Between 1913 and 1919 British theologian Fr. Herbert Kelly SSM served as Professor of Apologetics at the college. The college buildings and library were destroyed by Allied incendiary bombing in the closing stages of the Second World War. The college relocated to its current suburban location at Y≈çga, Setagaya, in 1953. Daily life All resident students are expected to attend Matins and Evensong in the college chapel. Sundays, students are expected to join local parish churches as part of their pastoral formation. Both single and married full-time students are given the opportunity to live in accommodation on the college grounds. The college also provides on site housing for faculty. Programmes The college offers the following degree programmes: * Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.) Normally a three-year full-time residential program as a pathway to ordination in the Anglican Church in Japan. * Master of Theology (M.Th) On submission of a graduating thesis usually one year full-time or two years part-time. Available for ordination candidates and external lay students. The college also serves as a center for lay ministry training. All courses at the college are taught in Japanese. Through grants made available from overseas mission societies, English- language library resources are also available on site.

Kolesnikoff was born in a peasant family in a southern province of the Russian Empire. His artistic potentials were recognized early. In 1897 he started attending an artistic school in Odessa, one of the topmost of its kind in the country. In 1903, Kolesnikoff was accepted into the Imperial Academy of Arts, where his paintings regularly won prizes in the annual Spring exhibitions. His prolific work in oil and especially in gouache won him the highest regards from the foremost Russian artist of his day Ilya Repin, as evidenced from the contents of their correspondence, now in the Russian archives. In 1919 he and his family emigrated to the Balkans, and in 1920 he settled in Belgrade, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, (Yugoslavia after 1929) where he spent the rest of his life as an immigrant. Kolesnikoff was promptly welcomed in the royal court of his new country. Among others, he was given a state assignment to lead the restoration works on numerous paintings and frescoes.

They are based on the story of the seduction of Antiope by the god Zeus in Greek mythology, later imported into Roman mythology and told of the god Jupiter. According to this myth, Antiope, the beautiful daughter of King Nycteus of Thebes, was surprised and seduced by Zeus in the form of a satyr. She became pregnant and bore the twins Amphion and Zethus, who later killed Nycteus' brother Lycus in revenge for his treatment of Antiope and took over the city of Thebes.  Satyr and Nymph  Agostino Carracci: Le Satyre et la Nymphe Satyrs and nymphs form two extremes in Greek mythology, which are united only by their instinctive natures. While the nymph was the source of the psychological term nymphomania (now hypersexuality), the satyr was the source of the once common but now outdated term satyriasis and can be understood as the nymph's male equivalent. Accordingly, both nymphs and satyrs are very regularly depicted in mythology - and thence also in their subsequent artistic reception - in erotic contexts and are accordingly favoured topics of art. In addition there is a clear aesthetic contrast between the two stereotypes. The nymph is in general very beautiful and physically perfect. They were mostly depicted with ivory, light and very delicate colours and an idealised female form, having close similarities with depictions of Venus. On the other hand, the satyrs, who are the followers of Bacchus, are very ugly, with the horns, legs and sometimes the tail of a goat. They are also strong, muscular, and tanned. Thus nymphs and satyrs present an optical contrast, which could hardly be any stronger and which makes them a perfect pair for artistic purposes.Section derived from Eva Gesine Baur, Meisterwerke der erotischen Kunst.

Many Vietnamese achieved proficiency in the medical, scientific, and computer science fields.Guillon, Michelle. \\"The Chinese and Chinese Districts in Paris\\" (Chapter 11).

History The first Vietnamese settlers to France consisted of diplomats and officials of the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty following the establishment of political relations between Vietnam and France in the latter half of the 18th century.Nguyen Quy Dao, La diaspora vietnamienne et sa coop√©ration avec le Vietnam, 2013 (in French) Following the colonization of Vietnam by France in 1862, Paris became a destination for Vietnamese students to study at the city's numerous educational institutions, as well as intellectuals and artists. Returners to Vietnam among this group of migrants would play significant roles in shaping Vietnam's political and social scene during the colonial era and up until the end of the Vietnam War.Goebel, Michael. Vietnamese Migrants in Interwar Paris and Global Anti-Imperialism, June 2014. During World War I, roughly 50,000 Vietnamese were recruited as soldiers or workers by France to help with the war effort in the ruling country. Following the conflict, a large number of these migrants opted to stay in France, with a majority settling in Paris and working as factory laborers or in service jobs. The presence of this group formed the first significant Asian community in Paris and France.La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier (in French) A 1927 estimate counted about 3,000 Vietnamese in Paris, with a majority of students from southern Vietnam (Cochinchina) and a majority of workers from northern Vietnam (Tonkin). The interwar period saw a continuation of Vietnamese students, intellectuals and expatriates arriving in Paris. A number of important figures in modern Vietnamese history would study, work or live in Paris during this era. For instance, Ho Chi Minh returned to France in 1919 after an earlier sojourn and studied politics in the city, where he also drafted works demanding greater civil rights for Vietnamese in the Indochina colony.\\"Ho Chi Minh, 1890‚Äì1969, half length, standing, facing left; as member of French Socialist Party at Versailles Peace Conference, 1919\\", Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Online Catalog. Another major Vietnamese figurehead studying in Paris during this time was B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, who would become the last emperor of Vietnam. Numerous others who would also later play major political roles in Vietnam also studied in Paris up to Vietnamese independence in 1954, including Phan Chu Trinh and Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu. Paris was also a prime destination for Vietnamese artists and professionals. Major Vietnamese musicians, artists and intellectuals who expatriated to Paris or immigrated to the city from the 1920s to 1970s include: Ph·∫°m Duy, Lam Ph∆∞∆°ng, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Kh√™ and Tr·∫ßn Thanh V√¢n, among others. By the 1930s, a number of professionals had created community organizations to help serve the Vietnamese community, including Vietnamese Chinese who chose to associate themselves with the Vietnamese population rather than with Chinese settlers from mainland China. Following Vietnam's independence from France in 1954, the former colonial ruler was still an important destination for Vietnamese seeking educational and economic opportunities abroad. However, due to the partition of Vietnam and the isolationism imposed by the North, the vast majority of Vietnamese coming to France during this time were from the South. In 1964, in response to the significant number of Vietnamese students in Paris and lack of representation, the Association G√©n√©rale des Etudiants Vietnamiens de Paris (AGEVP, General Association for Vietnamese Students of Paris) was founded as the oldest overseas Vietnamese youth association.Bousquet p. 155 After the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and end of the Vietnam War, the majority of Vietnamese refugees to France were settled in Paris and the surrounding √éle-de-France metropolitan region. The first wave of these refugees actually consisted of those who were exiled or evacuated shortly before the war ended, and consisted almost entirely of South Vietnamese politicians and their families, including Madame Nhu and Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh. From this period and into the 1980s, the area of the 13th arrondissement developed into a Little Vietnam, with a commercial district and community institutions created to serve the new Vietnamese immigrants, along with expanded services provided by established organizations such as the AGEVP. Demographics As the Institut national de la statistique et des √©tudes √©conomiques does not provide race and ethnicity in its census estimates, it is difficult to determine the precise number of French citizens of Vietnamese descent in France and Paris. As of 2018, estimates for the Vietnamese population in Paris place the number at about 70,000. Such a figure places Paris as one of the cities with the largest number of ethnic Vietnamese living outside Vietnam. Furthermore, an additional 100,000 ethnic Vietnamese are estimated to live around the √éle-de-France area. This number also puts the region as having the largest number of ethnic Vietnamese in the world outside of Vietnam itself. Meanwhile, a 2011 estimate counted over 30,000 Vietnamese in Paris who were either permanent French residents born in Vietnam or who were Vietnamese citizens. Geographic distribution Unlike other Asian communities in Paris, the Vietnamese community's well-established presence in the city has resulted in the majority of the community being scattered around the city and surrounding suburbs, rather than in ethnic enclaves such as the Chinese or North Africans. For the first decade or so after refugee arrivals began in 1975, the 13th arrondissement and specifically its Quartier Asiatique, was the hub of the Vietnamese community. However, the quick integration of the immigrants due to linguistic and cultural knowledge of the host country led to a suburbanization of the Vietnamese and a movement to wealthier areas of Paris, while still maintaining a significant commercial and cultural presence in the neighborhood. Besides the 13th arrondissement, significant Vietnamese concentrations are also found in the 18th and 19th arrondissement of Paris. Numerous Vietnamese cultural institutions and Buddhist temples are also found in the 17th arrondissement. In regards to the suburbs of Paris, the communes of Ivry-sur-Seine, Lognes, Torcy, Bussy-Saint- Georges and Les Essarts-le-Roi contain the highest concentrations of Vietnamese in France, with a share of over 20% of each commune's population. Additionally, the commune of √âvry is the site of the (Pagode Kh√°nh-Anh), a Vietnamese Buddhist temple that is also the largest Buddhist place of worship in Europe. Media There are a small number of Vietnamese language media broadcasters and newspapers in Paris and the surrounding √éle-de-France region, most notably Radio France Internationale, which broadcasts a station in Vietnamese. Paris has not only played a major role in modern Vietnamese culture, but is also host or the origin city to the entertainment industry serving other overseas Vietnamese communities. The most notable overseas Vietnamese production, Th√∫y Nga, producer of the popular Vietnamese language variety program Paris by Night, was restructured and headquartered in Paris following its move from South Vietnam post-1975.

He serves as the Non Executive Chair of the Marshall Institute at the London School of Economics and the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. He promotes philanthropy, and argues for more ethical engagement within the City of London. Early life Thomas Michael Sydney Hughes-Hallett was born on 28 August 1954.Debrett's He was educated at Eton College, a private boarding school in Berkshire, England.Maxine Boersma, Sir Thomas Hughes-Hallett: from the bar to banking ‚Äì and on to philanthropy, Financial Times, 13 November 2013Rosie Murray-West, Taking on a giving concern, The Daily Telegraph, 7 December 2002 He then went on to read History at the University of Oxford.Imperial College London: Improving Health Outcomes: The Role of Institutes for Global Health In an interview, he stated to have taught mathematics, music and hockey in Zimbabwe at the age of twenty-one.Mini Profile ‚Äì Sir Tom Hughes-Hallett, Imperial College London, 3 October 2012 He then received a law degree from The College of Law. Career Sir Thomas first trained as a barrister, but quit soon thereafter as he felt the job was \\"lonely\\". In another interview, he stated that his image of being a barrister was shattered when his first case was an eleven-week incest trial. After facing a retrial that would take another eleven weeks, Sir Thomas is quoted as saying that \\"I just couldn't face going through that again so I left.\\" He subsequently worked as an investment banker for Schroders for five years. In the late 1980s, he founded an investment bank, Enskilda Securities, earning him the nickname \\"Thomas Huge-Wallet\\". For the next eighteen years, he was the Chief Executive of Enskilda Corporate and later the Chairman of Robert Fleming Securities. A major shareholder in Flemings, he retired from finance shortly after its merger with Chase in 2000.Angela Jameson, First stop trustee, next stop Ned: Helping to oversee a charity gives young professionals skills needed for the boardroom, The Sunday Times, 9 November 2014  Philanthropy  Sir Thomas became first involved in charities during the 1990s, during which he was first a trustee and later the Chairman of the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering Children, as well as Chairman of the English Churches Housing Group. In 1999, Sir Thomas suffered an apparent heart attack, which he hinted was the result of a stressful life style in his capacity as an investment executive. This health scare caused him to re-evaluate his priorities in life. In 2000, he left investment banking to do charity work instead. From 2000 to 2012, he served as the Chairman of the Marie Curie Cancer Care Trust.Happy Birthday: Sir Thomas Hughes- Hallett, 58, The Times, 28 August 2012 To raise his salary of ¬£90,000, in 2002 he cycled across Vietnam for the Marie Curie Cancer Care to be able to keep him. According to a report, he seeks to cover his salary cost through similar fund-raising challenges every year. Sir Thomas serves or has served in leading positions of various charitable organisations. He served as the Executive Chair of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London. Additionally, he served as the Chairman of the End of Life Care Implementation Advisory Board and as Chair of the Palliative Care Funding Review. Furthermore, he is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation.Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation: Board of Trustees He is the Chairman of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the King's Fund.King's Fund: Sir Thomas Hughes-Hallett In 2013, he became Chairman of Cause4, an organisation that assists charities in their fundraising. = Views on Banking and Charity = Hughes-Hallett has called for more bankers and investors from the City of London to be involved in philanthropy and donate not only time and talent, but also money. In a 2002 interview, Hughes-Hallet expressed his surprise when he realised that the people who can afford to donate money usually don't. Speaking at the Close Brothers Trustee Leadership Programme, a seminar organised by Close Brothers Asset Management, an investment firm based in the City of London, in 2014, he argued that serving on the Board of Trustees of a philanthropic organisation was a valuable work experience to then serve on a corporate board. In the past, he has expressed the sentiment that his own generation of bankers was far too concerned about making money, but that he believes the younger generation has realised the importance of philanthropy. He also expressed hopes that the younger generation of bankers in the City is more generous that his own. Sir Thomas has expressed doubts regarding the utility of \\"social investments\\", considered sometimes as a sustainable alternative to philanthropy. Specifically, he criticised how social investments are portrayed as a charitable activity, but can often lead to unethical practices, especially in the health sector. = Call for NHS reform = In 2013, he called for a reform of the National Health Service, arguing that people's expectation of the NHS to provide all health services for free is setting it up for a breakdown.NHS charges: Hughes-Hallett on paying for health services, BBC, 30 October 2013 He called for making greater use of British society in health care. = Marshall Institute = In 2015, Hughes- Hallet together will investment banker Sir Paul Marshall established the Marshall Institute for Philanthropy and Social Entrepreneurship at the London School of Economics, supported by a ¬£30 million investment by Paul Marshall. The Institute's student body is expected to consist of people who have \\"reached the age of 50, a partner in an international firm, who've decided they've made their money and want to put something back.\\"  Accolades  He was knighted by the Queen for his philanthropic work during her 2012 Birthday Honours. As a result, he is styled Sir Thomas Hughes-Hallett. In 2013, he was the recipient of the Beacon Fellowship from the UK Community Foundations. Anglia Ruskin University awarded Hughes-Hallett with an Honorary Doctor of Arts in 2015. Personal life He is married to Jules (Lady Hughes-Hallett), whom he met immediately after leaving Oxford and who is a former fashion editor of Vogue. She also is the Chair of Smart Works, a non-profit organisation which gives free clothes and job interview advice to women who are unemployed.Emma Barnett, Dress for Success: the charity quietly getting British women back into work, The Daily Telegraph, 18 October 2012 The couple have three children, two of whom are sons.

It existed from 1878 to 1936. It was located in the far southeastern corner of the Choctaw Nation in Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma. The original location was in the southwest corner of Section 27 near the present-day Valliant, Oklahoma. But in 1902 it was rebuilt in the northeast quarter of section 29 near the western line of McCurtain County, Indian Territory.Flickinger (1914), pp 220‚Äì221 The school closed in 1936, and no evidence of it other than a historical marker remains. Curriculum Oak Hill, Hen House Oak Hill was developed to provide training in farming and domestic trades, and to teach Christianity to the former Choctaw slave children.Flickinger (1914), p 135 According to the school's founders, \\"[These young people] are transplanted for a time, where they may receive Bible instruction, industrial training and a foretaste of the privileges of an enlightened christian civilization\\".Flickinger (1914), p 152 As was typical of American Indian boarding schools the farming model was implemented, where students both learned agricultural and animal husbandry skills and grew their own food. The students cultivated land, hauled water (as their well had run dry), and tended large herds of pigs and cattle.Flickinger (1914), pp 136‚Äì140 In the early days, focus was on vocational training and the educational portion was minimal, as schooling beyond an eighth grade education was not offered. Shortly after Oklahoma's statehood, the school implemented a public school model for classes which included algebra, arithmetic, astronomy, bookkeeping, botany, chemistry, civics, composition, economics, geography, geology, geometry, grammar, history, literature, rhetoric, stenography, surveying, telegraphy, trigonometry, typewriting and zoology. In addition to the classroom studies, technical trades offered included agriculture, animal husbandry, apiculture, carpentry, cobbling, concrete work, domestics, gardening, laundry work, poultry raising, and sewing.Flickinger (1914), p 270 Though standardization of education was required, so was segregation. State laws passed in 1907 (the same year as statehood), provided that any person who included any quantum of African blood had to attend a colored school and imposed fines for anyone who allowed students of different racial mixtures to attend the same schools. All students without negro blood were to be considered white and identical separate but equal facilities were to be maintained. Oak Hill, Cattle Stanchions By 1912, the school was offering to 7 hours of classroom study followed by 3 hours in the fields, sawing and splitting wood, or in the shop for boys and in the kitchen, laundry or sewing room for girls.Flickinger (1914), pp 162‚Äì166 Bible study was required and students were expected to memorize one verse and read one chapter daily. Between 1908 and 1912, of land had been acquired and was under cultivationFlickinger (1914), p 203 and academic instruction was being offered up to the 12th grade. In the early period of Oklahoma schooling there were few high schools and Elliott was listed as the only institution offering high school education to Choctaw freedmen's children. History After the Civil War, Presbyterians established a church to do mission work among the Choctaw at Oak Hill around 1869, expanding it to include Sunday School in 1876. When the Choctaw Nation freed their slaves and offered them citizenship, children of freedmen were entitled to benefit from the tribe's education fund.Flickinger (1914), p 103 The Choctaw nation allocated $2 for each Indian or Freedman student who \\"actually\\" attended school at least 15 days of every month. School attendance was mandatory and their system imposed fines of 10 cents per day on parents who did not send their children to school. The Nation provided all supplies and books and paid full or partial board for students who had to attend school away from their home communities. White students were barred from attending the Indian schools and if, because of necessity, they attended the neighborhood schools (as opposed to agency assisted schools), they were charged full tuition.Wellemeyer (1914), p 26 Original Building for Oak Hill School, former home of Choctaw Chief LeFlore In 1878, a carpenter, George M. Dallas, was hired by the Presbyterian Board of Missions for Freedmen to build a schoolhouse and upon its completion began teaching a day school in the building. In 1884, because there was an inadequate water supply, the school was transferred to a log house in section 29, about a mile and a half northwest of the original location.Flickinger (1914), p 104 In 1886, the Mission Board hired a teacher, Eliza Hartford from Steubenville, Ohio to take over instruction at the school. Hartford had previously taught in Cedar City, Utah from 1881‚Äì1885. With her arrival, the school relocated yet again to a log home which had formerly been the home of Chief LeFlore. Rather than stay with a church member and make the 3-mile journey to and from the school daily, Hartford moved into the school with 24 students on 15 April 1886, beginning the boarding school.Flickinger (1914), pp 107‚Äì110 Due to illness Hartford resigned in 1889Flickinger (1914), p 112 but the girl's hall she had advocated for was completed.Flickinger (1914), p 132 In 1893 a boy's hall was completed and by 1895 both a laundry and smokehouse were built. In 1902, the schoolhouse was moved and a second story was added, so that it would be nearer the railway and water would not have to be hauled the miles from the nearest water source,Flickinger (1914), pp 135‚Äì136 Clear Creek, as the well on the property had run dry.Flickinger (1914), p 139 In 1904, the school was closed during the Choctaw allotment and an arrangement made to secure 80 acres, 40 acres from two allottees, to reopen the school the following term.Flickinger (1914), p 154 When the school reopened in February 1905, in addition to the newly painted dorms, there were farm buildings supporting cattle, a dairy, a hen house, a farm, a garden, an orchard, and a piggery, which had been built and were maintained by the students.Flickinger (1914), pp 158‚Äì159 In preparation for statehood, the Curtis Act of 1898 had provided that all tribal laws were to be abolished by 4 March 1906; however, as the state was not prepared to take over the educational system, Congress passed an Act on 26 April 1906 known as the Five Civilized Tribes Act, which effectively transferred supervision of all tribal schools to the Secretary of the Interior.Wellemeyer (1914), p 44 Effectively, this created a system whereby the eastern and western parts of the state continued to develop differently. In the east, the Five Civilized Tribes, including the Choctaw, did not have a ready means to tax land as the state education provisions required.Wellemeyer (1914), pp 52‚Äì55 Due to this funding difference, missionary schools were phased out in western Indian schools by the time of statehood, but continued in the eastern part of the state for many years. On 8 November 1908, the boy's dormitory was lost to fire and a temporary replacement was built by the students in 1909. In 1910, construction began on the permanent replacement building. The students and superintendent built the first steel reinforced concrete foundation in the territory, using sand from a nearby creek, rocks and bricks from previously burned buildings and iron from the \\"scrap pile\\".Flickinger (1914), p 208 On 13 March 1910, the girl's dormitory also burned and the students were forced to relocate to the original log house, which had been the first home of the boarding school. A donation of $5,000 was made by David ElliottFlickinger (1914), pp 210‚Äì215 a prominent farmer from Lafayette, Indiana for the replacement of the school buildings in the name of his deceased wife Alice Lee Elliott. Upon completion of Elliott Hall, the school was renamed the Alice Lee Elliott Memorial Academy, commonly called Elliott Academy, and was dedicated on 13 June 1912. That same year, the first black administrator of the institution, William H. Carroll, was appointed superintendent. A Department of the Interior Bulletin published in 1916 lists the Academy as a private school, at that time being wholly funded by the Presbyterian Mission Board. The school had 120 students, of whom 60 were boarders and 1 was above the 8th grade. It was also noted that of the 300 acres of land, only part of it was under cultivation for commercial purposes only and that it was not being used for educational purposes. By the 1920 census there were 58 students under the age of 20 boarding at the school but by 1930 only 10 boarding students remained. Though the federal government's management of schools in the eastern part of the state was supposed to continue for only a few years, it did not fully cease for schools with Indian attendance until 1948.Jackson (1951), p 208 The school was closed in 1936 and no evidence of it other than a historical marker remains.

The high school opened in 1994 and the middle school opened in 2003. It is currently one of four junior and senior high schools affiliated with Ritsumeikan University. The Ritsumeikan family of schools also includes Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, located in Beppu, and Ritsumeikan Primary School, located in north Kyoto. The school is noted for its English language education programs and athletic achievement. The school introduced English immersion education in 2000, and in 2002, was designated a Super English Language (SEL) high school by the Japanese government. In 2009, the school was authorized by the IBO as the first Article 1 (government approved) Japanese institution in the Kansai region to provide the IB Diploma Program (IBDP). In 2014, the school was selected as a Super Global High School by the Japanese government, and in 2019 a World-Wide Learning (WWL) Hub School, both of which earned the school sizable supplementary grants. In athletics, the school has a rich history of success in women's Ekiden relays, including multiple national championships. It also has had national level success in men's soccer, American football, baton twirling, baseball, and other sports. Overview School's front gate Junior high school The junior high school consists of five home rooms per grade year and has between 160 and 170 students per grade. Like the high school, the junior high school is known for its English language achievement and international-friendly environment. Roughly a quarter of all students have experience studying abroad and/or have English as a native language. The school offers four levels of English A1, A2, A3, and Regular. Most of the A1 students take part in the International Preparatory Stream (IPS), which prepares students to matriculate to the school's English language IBDP course. Junior high school students are expected to take part in one of the school's many sports and culture clubs so as to experience a full school life of study and club. While the majority of students are Japanese, the school welcomes students with Japanese as a second language and offers JSL classes to students who require such support. High school B Building The high school was the second affiliated high school established within the Ritsumeikan Academy. In each grade, there are approximately 350 to 360 students. Students select one of three courses, the Integrated Global Course (IG), the Immersion Course (IM), or the International Baccalaureate Course (IB). =IG Course= The IG Course is the largest course in the school. The language of instruction is Japanese. All students also take English classes according to their level, and French, German, and Chinese language classes are also available. IG students select either the Science Career Stream or the Global Career Stream. The majority of students in the IG Course matriculate to one of the Ritsumeikan University campuses, though a minority matriculate to other schools in Japan. Therefore, the IG Course is a primarily a feeder course for Ritsumeikan University and Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University. =IM Course= The IM course offers blended English and Japanese instruction and is designed for students who wish to become fluent in English in high school. First year coursework is in both languages, and from midway through their first year students go abroad to study for a whole academic year either in either Canada, USA, or New Zealand. For their senior year, the bulk of classes are in English. Many IM students matriculate at Ritsumeikan University, while others chose schools in the Tokyo region. A small number of students from the IM Course elect to study overseas for university. =IB Course= Authorized by the IBO in 2009, the IB course has around 25 to 30 students per grade. All classes are taught in English by native-level speakers with the exception of Japanese language and literature classes. First-year classes prepare students for the challenge of the IB Diploma, and in the second and third year students study IB Diploma classes of their choice. The IB Course offers students the opportunity to earn a dual degree: the universally recognized IB Diploma as well as a standard Japanese high school diploma. Around half of the students matriculate internally from the junior high school, and the other half enter from other Japanese junior high schools or schools overseas. The majority of students in the IB course chose typically choose to study at universities other than Ritsumeikan University. Historically, approximately half of the graduates have gone to study overseas and half have remained in Japan. The IB Course regularly achieves marks well above the world norm, with multiple students earning outstanding scores of over 40 (out of 45) in the IBDP. In 2012, one student achieved a rare perfect 45.http://globaledu.jp/ujc-ritsumei-892.html IB Diploma subjects include: * Group 1: Japanese A Literature SL/HL, English Literature SL/HL, English Language and Literature SL/HL * Group 2: Japanese B SL/HL, English B SL/HL * Group 3: Global Issues SL/HL, Business SL/HL, Economics SL/HL * Group 4: Physics SL/HL, Chemistry SL/HL, Biology SL/HL * Group 5: Mathematics SL/HL * Group 6: Art SL/HL =High School Dorm-Firits House= High school students can choose to live in the school's dormitory, known as Firits House. The dormitory is fully equipped for student living and is located 15 minutes from the school by bus in the town of Uji. The dormitory has the capacity to house 380 students. Many of the students in the dormitory are either in athletics or the IB Course, as students come from around the country and the world for the school's outstanding offerings in these areas. School Events =Sports FestivalÔºà‰ΩìËÇ≤Á•≠Ôºâ= The school holds a traditional Japanese sports festivals every May. The entire school population participates in either the junior high or high school festival, which this is one of the most exciting and memorable events of the school year. =Kofusai(ËààÈ¢®Á•≠)= The school holds a culture festival, known as Kofusai every September over several days. This festival showcases student creativity in many areas such as song and dance, calligraphy, and dramatic performance. All students decorate their home room according to a theme they choose, and Kofusai is well attended by parents and friends. =Choir Copmetition= The choir competition is held in November, and features all classes competing against each other the school auditorium. Students prepare for weeks for this big event, which is well attended by parents. Academic Achievements =Matriculation= As noted above, the majority of students from Ritsumeikan Uji matriculate at either Ritsumeikan University or Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, while a healthy minority attend other Japanese private, public, and national universities, as well American, British, Canadian, Australian and other overseas universities. The school has placed students at leading universities and colleges around the world including Brown University, Dartmouth College, Amherst College, Imperial College London, King's College London, Leiden University, the University of Melbourne, the University of British Columbia, the University of Toronto, Waseda University, Sophia University, Osaka University, and many others.

Aircraft The City of Canberra, registered VH-OJA, named after Australia's capital city, was the first Boeing 747-400 delivered to Qantas.The aircraft is a Boeing 747-400 model; Boeing assigns a unique code for each company that buys one of its aircraft, which is applied as an infix to the model number at the time the aircraft is built. Boeing's code for Qantas is 38, hence \\"747-438\\". It was not modified for the flight in any way - such as by the installation of extra fuel tanks - but some items of equipment were removed from the galleys and cargo compartments to save weight. Record-breaking flight The 747-438 took 20 hours and 9 minutes to fly a distance of 9,720 nautical miles (18,001 km) from London Heathrow to Sydney. The elapsed time was six minutes longer than the quickest non-stop England to Australia flight, which was made by an Avro Vulcan of the Royal Air Force in 1961.Jacobs (2011), p.96 The City of Canberra set a record for the longest un-refuelled flight by a commercial aircraft, as the Vulcan was a military aircraft and had to be refuelled in flight several times while flying from RAF Scampton to RAAF Base Richmond near Sydney.

The last commercial flight was from Johannesburg to Sydney. It was subsequently donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society at the Illawarra Regional Airport via a delivery flight on 8 March 2015. Pilots trained on simulators for the landing and reduced the aircraft's weight including reducing the tyre pressure to 120 pounds per square inch from the typical 208, and carrying 25,400 litres of fuel, versus the maximum of 217,000 litres.

He fought in World War I, Polish‚ÄìSoviet War and the Invasion of Poland, and was a member of the Home Army. Endel-Ragis (nom de guerre Slaski) was born on November 11, 1894 in ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew, Austrian Galicia (currently Zhovkva, Ukraine). He attended a high school in Lw√≥w, joining the Riflemen's Association Strzelec. In 1912, he completed an officer course there, and before the outbreak of World War I joined Polish Legions commanded by Jozef Pilsudski. He served in the 5th Legions Infantry Regiment from August 8, 1914 until October 13, 1917. After the Oath crisis, Endel-Ragis was forced into the Austro-Hungarian army, in which he served from October 15, 1917 until May 10, 1918. On November 1, 1918, he was named commandant of 4th District of Polish Military Organisation (POW) at Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski. On November 22 of the same year, Endel-Ragis was appointed commandant of 2nd POW Battalion, which was on December 10 turned into 26th Infantry Regiment. With this unit, Endel-Ragis served in distinction in the Polish-Soviet War, fighting in Volhynia and other areas. In the early 1920s, Endel-Ragis attended military courses at Warsaw‚Äôs Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Wojenna: on October 1, 1924 he was named officer of Polish General Staff, serving under Colonel Franciszek Wlad. At the same time, he remained officer at 26th Infantry Regiment. On December 1, 1924, President Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski, upon request of Minister of Military Affairs Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski, promoted Endel-Ragis to the rank of Podpolkovnik (Sub-Colonel). From February 12, 1925, until April 1, 1927, Endel-Ragis was chief of staff of the 7th Infantry Division, which was located in Czƒôstochowa. He then commanded 8th Legions Infantry Regiment in Lublin, and on December 24, 1929, President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki promoted him to Polkovnik (Colonel). On December 1, 1930, Endel-Ragis was appointed chief of staff of the Second Military District in Lublin. In December 1934 he was transferred to the 9th Infantry Division, located at Siedlce, remaining there until March 1939. Endel-Ragis was then named commandant of the 22nd Mountain Infantry Division (Przemy≈õl), replacing General Mieczys≈Çaw Boruta-Spiechowicz, who was moved to Bielsko Operational Group of Krak√≥w Army. According to Polish Polish General Staff planners, 22nd Mountain Infantry Division was to join ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army (General Juliusz R√≥mmel) as its reserve unit. Due to the destruction of Polish rail lines, caused by the Luftwaffe, the division did not reach its positions in Central Poland. On September 1, 1939, while 22nd Mountain Infantry Division was in the area of Sandomierz en route to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, it was turned back and transported towards Krak√≥w, following the request of General Antoni Szylling (commandant of Krak√≥w Army), who was aware of rapid advance of German armored forces near Czƒôstochowa. In the night of September 2/3, 22nd Mountain Infantry Division unloaded from trains near Olkusz, and took its defensive positions, awaiting the units of Operational Group Slask (General Jan Jagmin-Sadowski). Soon afterwards, German units of attacked the division, forcing it into retreat. After heavy fighting, Colonel Endel-Ragis with his soldiers reached Stasz√≥w, where he faced German 5th Panzer Division. Endel-Ragis then divided the division into smaller units, ordering them to fight their way east. In the night of September 9/10, 1939, Colonel Ragis, convinced that 22nd Mountain Infantry Division was completely destroyed, tried to commit suicide and shot himself in the head. He survived due to efforts of military doctors, both Polish and German, and settled in the area of Kielce, joining the Home Army. Leopold Endel-Ragis died on February 19, 1943 in Warsaw.

The case exemplifies a tradition in early 19th century United States patent caselaw in which patents were regarded specifically as an absolute property right to exclusive use of the invention,Adam Mossoff, Exclusion and Exclusive Use in Patent Law, 22 Harv. J.L. & Tech. 321, 351-52 (2009). rather than requiring a balancing between public and private interests.Michael J. Meurer & Craig Allen Nard, Invention, Refinement and Patent Claim Scope: A New Perspective on the Doctrine of Equivalents, 93 Geo. L.J. 1947, 1957 (2005). Background Jethro Wood's moldboard plow. In 1819, Jethro Wood patented a cast-iron moldboard plow with replaceable parts, which revolutionized American agriculture and laid the foundation for the later John Deere plow. His patent issued on September 1, 1819. But despite his invention's success, and although he was born to a wealthy Quaker family, he would die impoverished in 1834, having exhausted his funds on patent infringement suits. Among those suits was the action at issue here, in which Wood brought suit against Charles Wood and Gilbert Brundage in the Southern District of New York to invalidate their later patent on a similar plow, which had been issued on November 9, 1820. (Because of the Patent Office fire of 1836, the actual patents at issue here are not extant.) The Patent Act of 1793 allowed a suit for invalidity to be brought within three years of the contested patent being issued. The district court issued a rule nisi, ordering Charles Wood and Gilbert Brundage to appear and show cause why their patent should not be invalidated. They did so, but their arguments were not satisfactory to the court, which ordered the patent repealed immediately by a rule absolute. They moved for a scire facias proceeding, to have a jury trial on the validity of their patent, but the judge denied their motion. Charles Wood and Gilbert Brundage then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to require the district court to issue a scire facias and try the question by jury. Opinion of the Court The principal language at issue was section 10 of the Patent Act of 1793: > That upon oath or affirmation being made, before the judge of the district > court, where the patentee, his executors, administrators or assigns reside, > that any patent, which shall be issued in pursuance of this act, was > obtained surreptitiously, or upon false suggestion, and motion made to the > said court, within three years after issuing the said patent, but not > afterwards, it shall and may be lawful for the judge of the said district > court, if the matter alleged shall appear to him to be sufficient, to grant > a rule, that the patentee, or his executor, administrator or assign show > cause, why process should not issue against him to repeal such patent. And > if sufficient cause shall not be shown to the contrary, the rule shall be > made absolute, and thereupon the said judge shall order process to be issued > against such patentee, or his executors, administrators or assigns, with > costs of suit. And in case no sufficient cause shall be shown to the > contrary, or if it shall appear that the patentee was not the true inventor > or discoverer, judgment shall be rendered by such court for the repeal of > such patent; and if the party, at whose complaint, the process issued, shall > have judgment given against him, he shall pay all such costs, as the > defendant shall be put to, in defending the suit, to be taxed by the court, > and recovered in due course of law.1 Stat. 323. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the \\"process\\" that the statute described being issued after the summary proceedings was simply a process to repeal the patent, or a process for a jury trial (or bench trial if the issue was a question of law rather than fact). Justice Story held that the process had to be for a jury trial. In so doing, he relied heavily on the importance of the patent as a property right, requiring due process of law before it can be taken away, and on the importance of jury trials in the Anglo-American system. He reasoned that even if it might be constitutional for Congress to allow patents to be revoked by summary proceedings, that could not be assumed to be the case unless it was spelled out in the statute. Wrote Justice Story: > The securing to inventors of an exclusive right to their inventions, was > deemed of so much importance, as a means of promoting the progress of > science and the useful arts, that the constitution has expressly delegated > to Congress the power to secure such rights to them for a limited period. > The inventor has, during this period, a property in his inventions; a > property which is often of very great value, and of which the law intended > to give him the absolute enjoyment and possession. In suits at common law, > where the value in controversy exceeds 20 dollars, the constitution has > secured to the citizens a trial by jury. [....] It is not lightly to be > presumed, therefore, that Congress, in a class of cases placed peculiarly > within its patronage and protection, involving some of the dearest and most > valuable rights which society acknowledges, and the constitution itself > means to favour, would institute a new and summary process, which should > finally adjudge upon those rights, without a trial by jury, without a right > of appeal, and without any of those guards with which, in equity suits, it > has fenced round the general administration of justice.22 U.S. at 608. Even if the statute was ambiguous, therefore, that ambiguity could not support eliminating the jury trial right on questions of patent validity.22 U.S. at 610. However, on close reading of the statute Justice Story found it was not ambiguous, because the phrase regarding the \\"process\\" was followed by another about a subsequent judgment: \\"in case no sufficient cause shall be shown to the contrary, or if it shall appear that the patentee was not the true inventor or discoverer, judgment shall be rendered by such Court for the repeal of the patent.\\" Thus, Justice Story reasoned, Congress could not have intended the initial show-cause proceedings to allow for the summary invalidation of the patent; this invalidation could take place only after a proper trial. The Supreme Court therefore granted Wood and Brundage's petition, and ordered the trial court to issue a scire facias for a trial on whether their patent was valid. Subsequent developments The specific statutory interpretation performed by Justice Story became obsolete when the Patent Act of 1836 took effect, Ex parte Wood has never been cited in a Supreme Court opinion. It has however resurfaced in recent debates over the jury trial right in patent cases. In the 1995 case of In re Lockwood, the Federal Circuit used it to distinguish invalidity proceedings from inequitable conduct proceedings, arguing that the proceedings under section 10 of the Patent Act of 1793 were more similar to proceedings of the inequitable conduct kind, and therefore the jury-trial right did not extend to modern invalidity proceedings.Andrew W. Bateman, Reconsidering in Re Technology Licensing Corporation and the Right to Jury Trial in Patent Invalidity Suits, 82 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 933, 948 (2007). In re Lockwood, 50 F.3d 966, 975 (Fed.

The game was released on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 on February 3, 2015 and on OS X and Linux on February 10, 2015. Apotheon is Alientrap's second commercial game and utilizes a unique art style based on ancient Greek pottery, particularly in the black-figure pottery style.  Gameplay  Apotheon is a fast and brutal 2D action game with an art style and heroic narrative based on Ancient Greek mythology. The player controls Nikandreos, a young warrior who, with the help of Hera, fights the Olympian gods. Nikandreos can use his fists but, also, different weapons of the ancient world, including xiphos, battle axes, clubs, spears, bows, knives and more. Apotheon can be played in three different difficulty settings.  Plot  In the times of Ancient Greece, the Gods have begun to punish the humans of Earth, resenting their arrogance and defiance among their societies. Zeus, the father of all the Gods, has forced his children to stop giving their gifts of life to the Earth, so that all humans are soon deprived of animals, food, and even daylight. With most of the Earth cast in darkness, man begins to fall prey to the savage destruction of their cities. Meanwhile, in the Village of Dion, invaders ransack the entire area and lay waste to most of the village. A young warrior named Nikandreos awakens to find his home destroyed and many of the raiders killing Dion soldiers and citizens. Arming himself up and with the help of the surviving soldiers, Nikandreos is able to cast away the invading forces and slay their leader. In the temple, Nikandreos meets face-to-face with Hera, the wife of Zeus, who congratulates him for his victory in saving the village. Hera informs Nikandreos of Zeus' anger with the humans, as well as her hatred for his many affairs with other Gods and mortals. Wanting revenge as well as way to help Nikandreos save his people, Hera tasks him to slay Zeus and his siblings so that Nikandreos might bring back their gifts and save humanity. Nikandreos agrees and ascends to Mount Olympus to begin his hunt against the Gods of Greece. Nikandreos first enters the Agora of Olympus, where he must find and take the gifts from the gods Artemis, Demeter, and Apollo. Heading into the Forest of Artemis, Nikandreos completes many hunts of fantastical creatures to gain her attention, and soon kills her afterward to gain her magical Bow. Nikandreos attempts to slay Apollo, but is knocked unconscious and imprisoned within a cell. With the help of the god Helios who was also imprisoned by Apollo, Nikandreos escapes and is able to slay all of Apollo's captains and save Daphne from her own imprisonment as a tree. Nikandreos then slays Apollo for his lyre. However, in trying to find Demeter, she reveals she cannot give her sheaf, feeling sorrow for the taking of her daughter Persephone. Nikandreos finally descends into the lair of Hades to find Persephone, his wife, who instead of fighting back, rightfully gives her seeds to him so that he may bring life back to Earth. In return, Demeter sympathizes with Nikandreos and hands over her sheaf too. While attempting to head back to his village though, Zeus halts Nikandreos and accuses him of his arrogance and attempt at becoming a god, and thrusts him back to Earth. A screenshot of Apotheon, with the player character Nikandreos on the right. Nikandreos lands to find Dion in more ruin then before, with the wrath of the Gods now extending to physical aggression on Earth. Hera apologizes for her earlier refusal to help, but warns Nikandreos that Zeus has now tasked the remaining powerful gods Poseidon, Ares, and Athena to bring fury and destroy all of humanity. Heading toward the Acropolis of Olympus, Nikandreos goes to slay each of the final gods, and in return becoming more and more powerful from stripping them of their powers. However, upon returning once more to Dion, Nikandreos finds his home and his entire people annihilated and in waste. Hera tells him though that the time to strike Zeus is now, with most of his children and brethren slain and the power now in Nikandreos' hands. In a final single raid on the Fortress of Zeus, Nikandreos boldly ascends to the heavens of Olympus. He finds Hera chained with Zeus knowing her betrayal, leading to a final battle between the man and the god. Nikandreos successfully slays Zeus, gaining the right to power from Zeus' thunderbolt. Hera boasts at her victory and demands Nikandreos to free her. However, Nikandreos is sick of the rule of Gods and Hera's manipulations. At this point the player can choose to leave Hera or to kill her with Zeus' thunderbolt. Descending back to Earth, Nikandreos finds a giant-sized Zeus bragging and roaring of his own victories as a God, refusing to believe his own defeat from a mere mortal. With all of the powers of the Gods within him now however, Nikandreos also grows to the size of a God, and brutally fights and kills Zeus finally. Seeing the Earth in sad ruins, Nikandreos roams the desolate landscape. In finding some clay and rubble, Nikandreos forms a human being and gives it life, signaling the rebirth of humanity and the fall of the Gods. It is left open if Nikandreos will be a loving god himself, or grow disillusioned with his creation like the gods before him. The name Apotheon means \\"exalted to the state of godhood\\",https://www.pcinvasion.com/apotheon- reviewhttp://www.gamespot.com/reviews/apotheon-review/1900-6416025/ which reflects the deification of Nikandreos, the protagonist, at the end of the game.  Release  In August 2015, Alientrap joined forces with IndieBox, a monthly subscription box service, to produce an exclusive, custom-designed, physical release of Apotheon. This limited, individually-numbered collector's included a flash-drive with a DRM-free copy of the game, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual and Steam key, and several custom-made collectible items.  Reception  Apotheon received generally favorable reviews from critics, with a score on review aggregator Metacritic of 78/100 and 76/100 for the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 versions respectively. Critics generally praised the game's aesthetic and entertaining combat. Writing for Game Informer, Bryan Vore called Apotheon a \\"damn fun game and one of my surprise early favorites of 2015\\". Patrick Hancock of Destructoid felt it \\"more than backs up its aesthetic prowess with rewarding combat and exploration systems in place\\". Many reviewers noticed a Metroidvania influence, John-Paul Jones of GameWatcher applauded its \\"homage to the engrossing Castlevania and Metroid games pioneered back in the 8-bit days\\". Nicholas Plouffe of Canadian Online Gamers also recommended the game to fans of the Metroidvania genre. Writing for Hardcore Gamer, Alex Carlson felt the gameplay mechanics were shallow. He concluded \\"Apotheon is a classic case of style over substance\\". Philippa Warr of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described Apotheon as \\"an attractive but shallow game whose more interesting ideas are marred by an unwieldy control system\\". Other reviewers of the PlayStation 4 version noted crashes and bugs that hampered their experience. = Soundtrack = Push Square has named Apotheon's soundtrack as the 2nd best PlayStation soundtrack of 2015.Feature: The Best PlayStation Soundtracks of 2015 Paste Magazine placed it in number 3,The 15 Best Videogame Soundtracks of 2015 while Fact MagazineThe 15 Best Video Game Soundtracks of 2015 and IGRTOP 10 INDIE VIDEO GAME SOUNDTRACKS OF 2015 placed it in number 6.Praise for Apotheon Soundtrack  References  ; Notes ; Footnotes  External links  * * Apotheon Launch Trailer Category:2015 video games Category:Metroidvania games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Action video games Category:Platform games Category:Video games set in Greece Category:Video games set in antiquity Category:Video games with silhouette graphics Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games based on Greek mythology ","title":"Apotheon"},{"id":"45335864","text":"The Church of St. Francis Xavier () is a church in Malacca City, Malacca, Malaysia.

Evangelical Anglicanism or evangelical Episcopalianism is a tradition or church party within Anglicanism that shares affinity with broader evangelicalism. Evangelical Anglicans share with other evangelicals the attributes of \\"conversionism, activism, biblicism and crucicentrism\\" identified by historian David Bebbington as central to evangelical identity. The emergence of evangelical churchmanship can be traced back to the First Great Awakening in America and the Evangelical Revival in Britain in the 18th century. In the 20th century, prominent figures have included John Stott and J. I. Packer. In contrast to the high-church party, evangelicals emphasize experiential religion of the heart over the importance of liturgical forms. As a result, evangelicals are often described as being low church, but these terms are not always interchangeable because low church can also describe individuals or groups that are not evangelical. Description In contrast to Anglo-Catholics, evangelical Anglicans stress the Reformed, Protestant nature of Anglicanism. Historically, evangelicals have come from both moderate Calvinist as well as Arminian backgrounds. Evangelicals stress the need for a conversion experience and the importance of evangelism; they have a high view of biblical inspiration and biblical authority; and the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ is the focus of their preaching. Evangelical Anglicans have been particularly fierce critics of ritualism and sacerdotalism. With respect to baptismal regeneration, evangelicals hold baptism to be \\"part of a process of regeneration, a step before eventual 'rebirth'.\\": \\"When the infant grew to adulthood and experienced spiritual regeneration, then baptismal regeneration would be made effective.\\" Evangelical Anglicans hold a Reformed view of baptism understood in light of covenant theology in which baptism seals or pledges the blessings of the New Covenant to the individual Christian. However, regeneration is not simultaneous with baptism. In the case of infant baptism, the sacrament \\"signifies and seals to them graces which they still need to receive later by faith.\\" Evangelicals maintain a Reformed view of Holy Communion, believing that Christ is spiritually present in the Eucharist, rather than corporeally present.: \\"For example, many evangelical Anglicans acknowledge the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.\\": \\"Bishop Ryle was clear that there is 'a spiritual presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper to every faithful communicant, but no local corporal presence in the bread and wine to any communicant'. This, he went on to assert, 'is evidently the uniform doctrine of the Church of England'. Ryle was quite specific as to the meaning of 'a spiritual presence'. He spelt it out as follows: 'But we by the real spiritual presence of Christ do understand Christ to be present, as the Spirit of God is present, in the hearts of the faithful by blessing and grace; and this is all which we mean'\\". According to this view, known as receptionism, the body and blood of Christ are received spiritually by faith. By region =Church of England= 19th century Evangelicalism emerged from the religious revivals of the 18th century. While previous movements in the Church of England had revolved around issues of church order and authority, evangelicals stressed lifestyle, doctrine and conduct. Evangelicals emphasized domestic religion, especially family prayer. Evangelical concern for the moral reform of society manifested itself in large scale support for missions, schools, charitable societies for the poor, and the formation of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. It was also demonstrated by political campaigns in the British Parliament, the most important being the movement to abolish slavery led by William Wilberforce. Wilberforce was a prominent figure in a network of evangelical social reformers nicknamed the Clapham Sect. Charles Simeon (1759‚Äì1836) was a leading evangelical clergyman. Charles Simeon was the most influential leader of evangelical Anglicanism. He established the Simeon Trust, a fund that became a major source of evangelical patronage. By the time of his death, the Trust controlled the livings of 42 churches, including Bath Abbey. He also helped to found the Church Missionary Society in 1799, which was meant to be an evangelical alternative to the high-church Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. The society sponsored mission work in India, Africa, and Australia. In 1804, the British and Foreign Bible Society was founded to provide Bibles in different languages to accompany the missionary work. Nineteenth-century evangelicals were fascinated with biblical prophecy as it related to future events, and they also promoted Christian Zionism, the belief in the restoration of the Jews to Palestine. The London Society for Promotion of Christianity Amongst the Jews (now the Church's Ministry Among Jewish People) was created in 1809. In the 1830s, the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, a leading evangelical, helped persuade Lord Palmerston, the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to sponsor Jewish settlement. In 1841, Edward Bickersteth published The Restoration of the Jews to Their Own Land and the Final Blessedness of the Earth. The first evangelical bishop, Henry Ryder, was appointed to Gloucester in 1815 by the Earl of Liverpool after initial objections that he was a \\"religious bishop\\". The second evangelical bishop, Charles Sumner, Bishop of Winchester, was not appointed until 1826, over ten years later. His brother John later became Bishop of Chester and was elevated to Archbishop of Canterbury in 1848. The number of evangelical bishops grew afterwards, especially during Lord Palmerston's time as Prime Minister since he relied on Shaftesbury's advice when making appointments. In the latter half of the 19th century, the leading evangelical was J. C. Ryle, first Bishop of Liverpool. Ryle helped to found evangelical theological institutions such as Wycliffe Hall at the University of Oxford and Ridley Hall as alternatives to the diocesan-run colleges, which by this time were dominated by the ritualists. Evangelical insistence on the necessity of conversion provoked controversy within the Church of England over the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. Evangelicals rejected this doctrine, a position summarized by the Bishop of Winchester, who wrote, \\"I must look, notwithstanding his baptism, for the Scriptural evidence of his being a child of God.\\" The controversy came to a head in the late 1840s in what became known as the Gorham Judgment. In 1847, Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter, refused to induct George Cornelius Gorham as vicar of a parish in Devon on the grounds that Gorham did not believe in baptismal regeneration. Gorham appealed the case all the way to the Privy Council, which in 1850 ruled in Gorham's favour. In 1844, a number of congregations separated from the Church of England. They formed the Free Church of England, a protestant and reformed body, as a reaction to the ritualist movement. 20th century From the 1870s into the early 20th century, evangelicals came to feel increasingly marginalized as ritualism became more commonplace within the Church of England. As evangelicalism continued to lose ground to the high-church party, a split became apparent between conservative evangelicals and liberal evangelicals. Liberal evangelicals led by Vernon Storr coalesced into the Anglican Evangelical Group Movement. Their position was outlined in the 1923 collection of essays Liberal Evangelicalism, which argued that evangelicalism had been discredited and needed to move away from strict notions of penal substitutionary atonement and scriptural infallibility. Conservatives accused liberal evangelicals of being no different from the older broad church liberals that evangelicals had always opposed. In 1922, disaffected evangelicals left the Church Missionary Society over moves to broaden the society's theological boundaries and established the Bible Churchmen's Missionary Society (now known as Crosslinks). Soon, there were BCMS missionaries in Africa, Burma, and among the Inuit peoples. In 1925, what would become Trinity College in Bristol was established by the BCMS to train missionaries. Trinity, then known as Tyndale Hall, would maintain a conservative position, while other evangelical colleges like Ridley Hall would go in a more theologically open direction. Beginning in the 1960s, evangelicals began to emerge from isolation. In response to Congregationalist minister Martyn Lloyd-Jones' call for the formation of a pan-evangelical denomination, John Stott of All Souls, Langham Place delivered a strong assertion of Anglican identity at the National Evangelical Anglican Congress in 1967. This produced a greater willingness to remain within the Church of England and to change it from within. Influential organizations include the Reform network and the Proclamation Trust, which have worked to oppose women's ordination and permissive attitudes toward homosexuality in the Church of England. Churchman, published by the Church Society, is an important journal for conservative evangelicals. The think tank Fulcrum and the journal Anvil represent the open evangelical perspective. 21st century As other church parties experienced decline in the 21st century, evangelicalism has seen a rise in influence and popularity within the Church of England. According to Peter Brierley, a researcher on church statistics, 40 per cent of Anglicans attended evangelical parishes. As of 2016, 70 percent of ordinands were reported to be evangelical, and 18 out of 42 dioceses had evangelical bishops. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury since 2013, is evangelical with connections to Holy Trinity Brompton in London. Evangelical growth in recent years has been aided by aggressive church planting and urban evangelization. However, some liberals within the church have criticized the growing influence of evangelicalism as a threat to the inclusive, broad church values of the Church of England. In December 2014, it was announced that the suffragan see of Maidstone would be filled again in order to provide alternative episcopal oversight for particular members of the Church of England who take the conservative evangelical view on male \\"headship\\" and object to the ordination of female bishops. On September 23, 2015, Rod Thomas was consecrated Bishop of Maidstone. =Episcopal Church in the United States= 19th century Old St. Paul's Church in Philadelphia (now Episcopal Community Services) was a prominent evangelical Episcopal church in the 19th century. Its ministers included Stephen Tyng. In the 19th century, the newly organized Episcopal Church was divided between two competing church parties, the high-church party led by John Henry Hobart and the evangelical party (also simply called the low-church party). The evangelical party was influenced by their counterparts in England and included Wesleyans who chose to remain in the Episcopal Church rather than joining the Methodist Episcopal Church.: \\"... most Wesleyans became members of the Methodist Church, but some remained within the Episcopal Church to form an influential group, the Evangelicals or the low-church party.\\" Evangelical Anglicans, however, did not share the strong \\"sacramental emphasis\\" of the Methodists, who were also evangelicals.: \\"Evangelical Anglicans in the main did not follow the sacramental emphasis of the Wesleys but tended to be Cranmerian in their eucharistic theology...They were also content with the 1662 rite as agreeable to Christ's institution, understanding consecration as the setting aside of the elements for holy use.\\" Like evangelicals in other Protestant denominations, they stressed the need for a conversion experience and participated in the revivalism of the Second Great Awakening, holding revival meetings and prayer meetings. They also tended to disapprove of social amusements such as dancing, card-playing, and the theatre. While the high- church party disapproved of participation in inter-denominational voluntary societies, evangelical Episcopalians strongly supported them. Leaders such as Alexander Viets Griswold, William Meade, James Milnor, Stephen Tyng and Charles McIlvaine participated in societies such as the American Bible Society, the American Tract Society, the American Sunday School Union, the American Colonization Society, the American Temperance Society and the American Seaman Friends Society. According to church historian William Manross, evangelicals often preached to the \\"outcast and the underprivileged\\", which made them more aware of social problems and, therefore, more enthusiastic supporters of efforts to reform antebellum America. Participation in voluntary societies reflected evangelical Episcopalians' beliefs that every Christian had a responsibility to spread the gospel and righteousness in preparation for the millennial reign of Christ on earth. Like their English counterparts, millennial expectation fuelled an interest in biblical prophecy among evangelical Episcopalians. Bishop John P. K. Henshaw, Benjamin Allen (rector of Old St. Paul's in Philadelphia) and other Episcopal ministers published books or magazines dedicated to millennialism. By 1844, two-thirds of Episcopal clergy were evangelical. Nevertheless, the growing influence of the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement on Episcopal Church leaders worried evangelicals. They experienced a loss of confidence in the church's institutions after 1844 when the church's General Convention refused to label the Oxford Movement a heresy. Their own attempts to stem the tide through heresy trials ultimately failed as well. In response, evangelicals chose to form their own distinctly evangelical Episcopal voluntary societies to promote education and evangelism, such as the Protestant Episcopal Society for the Promotion of Evangelical Knowledge (which later merged with what is now known as the Episcopal Evangelism Society) and the American Church Missionary Society (which was modelled on the English society). After the American Civil War, the breach between evangelicals and high churchmen had deepened. While an older generation of evangelical leaders, such as McIlvaine, tried to preserve evangelical loyalty to the Episcopal Church, a younger generation was calling for schism and the creation of a distinctly evangelical church. In 1874, some of these evangelicals led by George David Cummins and Charles E. Cheney organized the Reformed Episcopal Church. Towards the end of the 19th century, the old evangelical party would evolve into broad church liberalism. Broad church Episcopalians sought to promote theological openness and tolerance, as well as social ministry and higher criticism of the Bible. Bishop Thomas M. Clark is an example of a leading 19th-century evangelical who had become a broad churchman by the time of his death in 1903. However, it was younger evangelicals, those from evangelical families or who had been educated in evangelical Episcopal seminaries, who were most susceptible to liberalism. This was the case of leading broad churchman Bishop Phillips Brooks, who was educated at the evangelical Virginia Theological Seminary. Broad churchmen like Brooks preserved the old evangelical emphases on liturgical and ecumenical liberty and personal religious experience, but they rejected the core teachings of evangelical theology. 20th century The Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s had less of an impact on the Episcopal Church than in other Protestant denominations. Nevertheless, it did lead to a reconfiguration of Episcopal church parties. Broad churchmen with more evangelical leanings, such as Walter Russell Bowie and Bishop Edward L. Parsons began to identify as liberal evangelicals. These liberal evangelicals sought to embrace modern science while also having a personal relationship with God. Liberal evangelicals also advocated for closer ecumenical relationships and union with other Protestant churches. Liberal evangelicals in the United States were influenced by liberal evangelicals in the Church of England. The difference between the American and English movements was that in the Episcopal Church the liberal evangelicals were the only evangelicals, whereas in England the liberals were countered by the conservative evangelicals. By mid-century, there was no living memory of the 19th-century evangelicals, and Episcopalians were \\"reluctant\\" to acknowledge that they had ever existed. Beginning in the 1960s, however, conservative evangelicalism would re-emerge as an important force within the Episcopal Church. The evangelical revival in the Episcopal Church was part of a larger postwar evangelical resurgence known in North America as neo-evangelicalism, and it was promoted and supported by Anglicans from England, where evangelical Anglicanism had remained a vibrant tradition throughout the 20th century. The most influential voice from England was John Stott. The new evangelicals would provide the strongest opposition to the liberal trajectory of the Episcopal Church, especially regarding progressive views on homosexuality. In the late 1980s, evangelicals began to form organizations aimed at promoting and defending their understanding of Anglican orthodoxy and changing liberal church policies. In 1996, Alden Hathaway, the Bishop of Pittsburgh, founded the American Anglican Council to represent evangelicals at the national level. Unable to alter the liberal program of the Episcopal Church, evangelical Episcopalians and their Anglo-Catholic allies looked to Anglican churches in the Global South for help in a process called Anglican realignment. =Anglican Church of Australia= In the Anglican Church of Australia, Calvinist evangelicalism is the dominant theological orientation of these dioceses: * Anglican Diocese of Sydney * Anglican Diocese of Tasmania * Anglican Diocese of North West Australia * Anglican Diocese of Armidale Additionally, the following non-evangelical dioceses have evangelical bishops: * Anglican Diocese of Bathurst (Mark Calder) * Anglican Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn (Stuart Robinson, Mark Short) * Anglican Diocese of the Northern Territory (Greg Anderson) * Anglican Diocese of Bendigo (Matthew Brain) Two of Australia's largest theological colleges are Anglican and Evangelical: Moore Theological College in Sydney, and Ridley College in Melbourne. =Africa= In Africa, evangelicalism is the primary theological orientation of the Church of Uganda, and it is low church in liturgical style. This is due largely to the fact that in much of East Africa Anglicanism was introduced by the evangelical Church Missionary Society. The evangelical character of the Anglican church in Uganda, as well as in the Anglican Church of Rwanda, was strengthened by the East African Revival of the 1930s and 1940s. The growth of Pentecostalism in Africa has pushed the church in a more charismatic direction. It is not unusual for church services to feature spontaneous prayer, greater leadership from lay people, and praise and worship music.

MacLehose Trail Stage 8 is visible on the ridge of the mountain on the right. Tai Mo Shan is the highest peak in Hong Kong, with an elevation of . It is also the tallest coastal peak in Southern China and second tallest coastal peak in China after Mount Lao, and located at approximately the geographical centre of the New Territories. The Tai Mo Shan Country Park covers an area of around Tai Mo Shan. It is located to the north of Tai Lam Country Park. The Long Falls is the highest waterfall in Hong Kong. Geography The whole Tai Mo Shan mountain range, known as Guan Fu Mountain (ÂÆòÂØåÂ±±, named after the salt field Kwun Fu Cheung (ÂÆòÂØåÂ†¥) in present-day Kowloon Bay) in Ming and Qing dynasties, covers over 350 square km, and stretches from Tai Lam Chung Reservoir in the West near Tuen Mun and Ma On Shan in the east and the mountains of Kowloon and Clear Water Bay in the south. Two other significant coastal peaks, the Lantau Peak (934m) on Lantau Island and Mount Wutong in Shenzhen (943.7m) are approximately 27 km to the southwest and 21.5 km to the northeast respectively. =Subpeaks= There are a few subpeaks that are given names in the Tai Mo Shan area, including: * Sze Fong Shan () * Wo Yang Shan () * Miu Ko Toi () * Wo Tong Kong () *Lin Fa Shan, Tsuen Wan () *Shek Lung Kung, Tsuen Wan () *Tin Fu Tsai Shan () *Ha Fa Shan, Tsuen Wan () Geology Tai Mo Shan is an inactive volcano dating from the Jurassic period. A small hill known as \\"Kwun Yam Shan\\" near the mountain still vents warm air though cracks in the rocks that lead all the way to the mantle. The holes that exhale warm air are known as \\"hot pots\\". When the surface temperature is cold, and the warmth of the expelled air is clearly discernible, this phenomenon is referred to by locals as \\"dragon's breath\\". If the air temperature at the summit is 6 degrees Celsius, then the air emerging from the interior of Kwun Yum Shan is somewhere between 13 and 21 degrees Celsius. These \\"hot pots\\" are remnants of the active volcano's superheated steam vents. The area's volcanic rocks are mainly coarse ash crystal tuff.alt= Climate Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Tai Mo Shan features a humid subtropical climate (Cwa), bordering a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). Due to the height of the mountain, Tai Mo Shan is claimed to be Hong Kong's most misty area, as it is often covered in clouds. In summer it is frequently covered with cumulus clouds, especially on rainy days, and in winter stratus clouds and fog often cover the peak. It is not uncommon for temperatures to drop below freezing point during the winter. Vegetation In the past, Tai Mo Shan was famous for a type of green tea, called mist or cloud tea, which grew wild on the mountain side. Occasionally, local people can still be seen picking the tea shoots for brewing green tea. More than 1,500 species of plants have been recorded in Tai Mo Shan including 27 species of native wild orchids, the protected Chinese Lily (Lilium brownii) which mostly grows on the east side of the Mountain, 24 species of native ferns, including tree ferns, of which a total of only 4 tree ferns species have been recorded around the entire mountain, 19 species of native grasses, and 7 species of native bamboos. Camellia sinensis var. waldenae (formerly Camellia waldenae) are also found on the mountain. A few types of wild orchids also grow in the streams of Tai Mo Shan including the Chinese pholidota orchid, Hong Kong's most common orchid, and the bamboo orchid, so called because of a distinct stem that looks like bamboo, which also grows in the streams of Tai Mo Shan. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in World War II, most of the trees in the park were cut down and extensive reforestation was carried out after the war. Trees that were planted are mostly non-native such as Pinus massoniana, Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, and paper bark tree. The area has now become one of the major forest plantations in Hong Kong. Wildlife Local wildlife comprises birds, snakes and butterflies. There are also freshwater crabs, feral dogs, feral cats, oxen and wild boar. History In 1986, a 34-hour blaze destroyed 282,500 trees at Shing Mun and Tai Mo Shan and ravaged 7.40 km¬≤ of countryside. Access It is rather easy to hike to the peak as there is a road all the way at a comfortable gradient. Visitors cannot access the highest point on Tai Mo Shan, as it is occupied by a Hong Kong Observatory (ex-RAF) weather radar station. It was reported in July 2014 that the station additionally houses facilities of the People's Liberation Army.

The school colours are blue and white. History =Foundation= Founded as a boys' secondary school at the end of the 19th century by members of the Presbyterian community, St Andrew's College celebrated its centenary in 1994. It was on 8 January 1894 that the College opened its doors at 21 St Stephen's Green in the centre of Dublin. This was to be the first of its three locations. The school grew rapidly from its original intake of 69 students. By the end of 1894 there were 203 boys in the school. =Wellington Place= At the beginning of 1937 a move to new premises in Wellington Place, Clyde Road, along with a determined effort by past pupils and parents to stave off closure or amalgamation saw a revival in the fortunes of the College. In 1973, the school became co-educational and moved to a new site in Booterstown. Structure St Andrew's College has both a primary and secondary school. The secondary school offers both the Leaving Certificate (Ireland) and the International Baccalaureate programme. =Accreditations= Since 1984, St Andrew's is the only school in Ireland fully accredited by both the European Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. =International Baccalaureate= St Andrew's is one of three schools in Ireland to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme. A small number (usually around 70) of the school's students are in the IB programme. = Model United Nations = St Andrew's organises St Andrew's Model United Nations (SAIMUN).

In Western countries, the lecture circuit has become a way for ex-politicians to earn an income after leaving office or to raise money and their public profile in advance of a run for higher office. The Oxford Dictionary defines the term simply as, \\"A regular itinerary of venues or events for touring lecturers or public speakers\\". In the United States, the modern lecture circuit was preceded by the Lyceum movement, popular during the 19th century. It encouraged local organisations and institutions to sponsor lectures, debates and instructional talks as a form of adult education and entertainment. The subsequent 20th century formalisation of the lecture circuit as a genuine and accepted vocation has led to the establishment of agencies and the employment of agents dedicated to identifying and filling lucrative speaking engagements; creating a specific media market where speakers are able to put their message to an audience uninterrupted and without challenge.  Examples  In an article about the lucrative nature of the Canadian lecture circuit, National Post columnist Tristin Hopper noted; Having stepped down as United States Secretary of State in 2013, Hillary Clinton has received more than $200,000, in some instances, to deliver lectures to industry associations, universities and other groups. She delivered 14 such speeches in the five months after leaving office. While still a Member of Parliament, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has declared significant income from the lecture circuit. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, too, is said to have declared approximately ¬£12 million in lecture circuit income per year since leaving office, receiving almost ¬£400,000, in one instance, for two half-hour speeches in the Philippines.  In popular culture  *In the television series The West Wing, Alan Alda's character Arnold Vinick is urged to go on the lecture circuit after his unsuccessful campaign for the office of President of the United States in order to maintain the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed as a member of the United States Senate. *The US version of the television series The Office includes a two-part episode titled Lecture Circuit.

Trueworthy, operating in southeastern California, western Arizona Territory, and northwestern Mexico. It was an opposition steamboat company to the George A. Johnson & Company on the Colorado River from 1864‚Äì1865. It was the first to use towed barges on the Colorado. Establishment of the Union Line Merchants and miners held a protest meeting at La Paz, Arizona on December 1, 1863, fed up with shortages, delayed and slow deliveries of freight to their stores and mines, by Johnson & Company, who owned the Colorado River's only two steamboats. They condemned the Johnson Company as a monopoly, that was trying to drive the miners out in order to gain control of the mines. The meeting voted to send a representative to San Francisco with a petition calling for the establishment of an opposition steamboat line on the Colorado River. In San Francisco, their representative Samuel \\"Steamboat\\" Adams convinced the Chamber of Commerce to endorse an opposition line. Merchants of the city raised $25,000 by subscription, and Adams persuaded Captain Thomas E. Trueworthy, to send the Sacramento River steamboat Esmerelda under Captain Charles C. Overman and the Victoria, a four-masted schooner converted from a barge, to the Colorado River to establish the Union Line there. Union Line on the Colorado River The Victoria was to be a store ship at the mouth of the river, but she was soon broken up by the tidal bore soon after it reached the mouth of the river at the Colorado River Delta in March 1864. Richard E. Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 After Overman arrived at the river in March 1864, he built the Black Crook, first tow barge to be used on the Colorado River. From May 1864, its success in delivering large amounts of cargo up river forced the Johnson Company to lower rates, build another steamboat and to add tow barges to his steamboats in 1864. =Union Line Consolidated= In the summer of 1865, with the steamboats Esmerelda of the Union Line and Nina Tilden of the Philadelphia Silver and Copper Mining Company (the other opposition line to the Johnson Company), was consolidated into the Pacific and Colorado Steam Navigation Company, also headed by Thomas E. Trueworthy, with backing from San Francisco financiers.

Follett & Co., drapers of Murray Street, Gawler. He showed an interest in painting, so his uncle F. B. Whinnen, a Murray Street grocer, made him a gift of a set of paints. His family moved to Willaston, then to Broken Hill, where he worked for Don Tailors and took night classes in painting at the technical school. He took further classes at the East Sydney Technical School. He was a champion rifle marksman, winner of the Galway Cup. When he left Broken Hill for Adelaide around the end of 1924 a trophy for rifle marksmanship was named for him. A few years later he was able to make art his full-time occupation. He studied under Fred Britton and attended life classes at the Adelaide School of Art. He won the Melrose Prize for portraiture in 1929 and 1932, also won prizes for landscapes and seascapes, much of which was painted around Victor Harbor. He created a furore in 1940 when he removed a still life from an exhibition run by the R.S.A.S.A. in a protest against the judges. He was president of the Royal South Australian Society of Arts 1940‚Äì1950. Also in 1940 he was appointed by the Education Department as teacher of drawing and painting from Life and Still Life.

Joe Marshall has been trained by the masters in Japan and speaks fluent Japanese, but dresses like a commoner. An attempted bust meets with failure after a bizarre car chase leads to multiple deaths and the only witness burned and unable to testify. Katana boss Fuj Fujiyama orders the injured Katana member to be executed and his head displayed on a piano to remind all remaining Katana members of their code of silence. Joe and his partner Frank confront the Katana at the Carlos'n Charlie's restaurant on Sunset Boulevard and attempt to reprimand them into obeying the law. When that fails, Fujiyama's right-hand man Yamashita wages war in the parking lot, executing his own men who fail to subdue Joe and Frank, thus maintaining the code of silence. Joe then stalks Fujiyama's girlfriend Jennifer and seduces her. They become intimate while several of his police comrades are tortured and killed by the Katana gang who are looking for him. Unable to contain his anger any longer, commanding officer Captain Roma sanctions an assassination of every single Katana gang member. Joe and Frank head to Fujiyama's compound and gun down every living person and a final sword battle between Joe and Yamashita ends the Katanas' reign of terror. To celebrate, Joe and Jennifer again have intercourse. Cast * Mathew Karedas as Joe Marshall (as Matt Hannon) * Robert Z'Dar as Yamashita * Mark Frazer as Frank Washington * Cranston Komuro as Fuj Fujiyama * Janis Farley as Jennifer * Gerald Okamura as Okamura * Dale Cummings as Captain Roma * Melissa Moore as Peggy Production The film moved swiftly into production, within a week of Amir Shervan and Matt Hannon's first meeting. Upon walking into Shervan's office for the first time, Matt Hannon was told that he was perfect and was immediately handed the full script to the film. Despite the film being titled Samurai Cop, Hannon had no experience with weapons training, and all of his formal practice would be classified as MMA. As a result of Hannon's lack of experience and Shervan's inability to direct, all of the combat scenes were choreographed by martial arts expert Gerald Okamura, or were planned out by the actors themselves, sometimes only fifteen minutes before the scene in question was filmed. Filming took place over several months, starting in June 1990. When actor Hannon had considered shooting to be finished, he had his hair cut short, only to be told that further shooting was to be done. Director Shervan obtained a lady's wig for the actor, which can be seen in several close up shots throughout the film. Lead actor Hannon stated that he and several other actors became frustrated with the dialogue in the film, while also expressing frustration at the lack of multiple takes. Hannon admitted to intentionally ruining takes due to his frustration assuming that Shervan would not put them in the film, but these takes ended up in the film. A reflective Hannon was able to laugh at this, stating \\"so shame on me\\" in a 2014 interview with Red Letter Media. The shooting schedule was also poorly planned as Hannon and Mark Frazer both assumed the film was finished before Shrevan called them in for reshoots in early 1991. Amir Shervan could not afford lighting to shoot at night so the entire film is set during the day. Actors also wore their own clothes and drove their own cars. Much of the film was shot without sound and done with single takes. Shervan had to dub voices months after production but could not get many of the bit part actors to return. Choosing to use his own voice, he warped it in post-production to sound different. His lack of ability to do this correctly resulted in ADR with a heavily robotic sound. Both lead actors, Hannon and Frazer, also supplied much of the voice over in the looping process. Hannon has stated in an interview with Red Letter Media that, \\"Amir did about 80% of the ADR voices.\\" During these ADR sessions, Amir would film much of the necessary pick up shots, all from within the office. This is why many of the inserts of Frazer and Hannon in the film seem to be shot from the same corner of an office, which doesn't match with the rest of the location for any given scene. Release Director/Producer Amir Shervan took the film to the American Film Market (AFM) in the hopes of finding a distributor to buy the final product and give it a proper release. The film was never given a proper theatrical release, however Polish distributor Demel International Corporation released it in Europe on VHS. It was released on DVD by Media Blasters in 2004 and on DVD in 2013 and Blu-ray in 2014 by Cinema Epoch. There were rumors that the initial released cut of Samurai Cop was a print that had been found in a castle. Gregory Hatanaka, the founder of Cinema Epoch, and the one who owns the rights to the initial Samurai Cop film, claimed that this story was only partially true. The original 35 mm print of the film was discovered by an employee of Hatanaka's in a vault that was specifically meant to store reels of film and preserve them. It was assumed that Shervan had stored the print for Samurai Cop as well as a few of his other films in this vault where they were happened upon by chance. On March 25, 2016, Samurai Cop was released as a VOD title by RiffTrax. The RiffTrax edition received a two- day theatrical release in April 2017, provided by Fathom Events. Reception Samurai Cop began its ascent into cult status when what would become known as \\"The Horny Nurse Scene\\" began circulating the internet. This was thanks to Youtube and also being sent around by action-movie fans, believing that they had found what they could consider the next greatest \\"so bad it's good\\" film since The Room. Since its release, the film has developed a cult following. The staff of Ain't It Cool News wrote that \\"it might be amongst the worst films ever released to market, but therein lies every reason why its so...fun to watch.\\" Oktay Ege Kozak of DVD Talk referred to it as a \\"'so bad it's good'\\" movie, calling it \\"ineptly made yet unintentionally hilarious and fascinating from the first frame to the last. [...] Every scene in Samurai Cop is chock full of mistakes and baffling decisions that extra nitpicky fans of bad movies should have a field day exploring.\\" Jim Vorel of Paste wrote that the film is \\"rightfully hailed as [Amir Shervan's] terrible magnum opus\\", and concluded: \\"The whole thing looks like a movie aliens would make if they were lacking some sort of crucial understanding of how human beings communicated with one another.\\" Sequel Gregory Hatanaka, founder of Cinema Epoch, has produced and directed a sequel, Samurai Cop 2: Deadly Vengeance, which was released in 2015. The lead actor of Samurai Cop, Mathew Karedas, (who is credited as Matt Hannon) was believed by many fans of the cult hit to have died in the early 2000s, around the same time that Shervan had died. Karedas' daughter, who was a film student at the time Samurai Cop was reaching its peak cult status, had done some internet digging and had realized that fans had started the rumor that her father had died. She convinced Karedas to make a video where he informed the world that he was still alive. He disclosed in an Interview with Red Letter Media that he had sent her a video of him explaining his real thoughts on Samurai Cop and that he was in fact still alive. She then immediately took that video and posted it online, where the internet began to buzz with articles and videos of countless reactions to the fact that the Samurai Cop was alive and well. Hatanaka, who owned the rights to the original film, was already working on a sequel, Samurai Cop 2: Deadly Vengeance, prior to the revelation that Hannon was still alive. Upon finding out that Hannon was still alive, Hatanaka quickly got him on board the project and production was ready to begin.

A set enumerated by some enumerator is said to be recursively enumerable. Formal definition An enumerator E is usually represented as a 2-tape Turing machine. One working tape, and one print tape. It can be defined by a 7-tuple, following the notation of a Turing machine: E = \\\\langle Q, \\\\Sigma, \\\\Gamma, \\\\delta, q_0, q_{print}, q_{reject}\\\\rangle where * Q is a finite, non-empty set of states. * \\\\Sigma is a finite, non-empty set of the output / print alphabet * \\\\Gamma is a finite, non-empty set of the working tape alphabet * \\\\delta is the transition function. \\\\delta: Q \\\\times \\\\Gamma \\\\rightarrow Q \\\\times \\\\Gamma \\\\times {L,R} \\\\times \\\\Sigma_\\\\epsilon * q_0 \\\\in Q is the start state * q_{print} \\\\in Q is the print state. * q_{reject} is the reject state with q_{print} eq q_{reject} Equivalence of Enumerator and Turing Machines A language over a finite alphabet is Turing Recognizable if and only if it can be enumerated by an enumerator. This shows Turing recognizable languages are also recursively enumerable. Proof A Turing Recognizable language can be Enumerated by an Enumerator Consider a Turing Machine M and the language accepted by it be L(M). Since the set of all possible strings over the input alphabet \\\\Sigma i.e. the Kleene Closure \\\\Sigma^{*} is a countable set, we can enumerate the strings in it as s_{1},s_{2},\\\\dots ,s_{i}, etc. Then the Enumerator enumerating the language L(M) will follow the steps: 1 for i = 1,2,3,... 2 Run M with input strings s_{1}, s_{2}, \\\\dots, s_{i} for i-steps 3 If any string is accepted, then print it. Now the question comes whether every string in the language L(M) will be printed by the Enumerator we constructed. For any string w in the language L(M) the TM M will run finite number of steps(let it be k for w) to accept it. Then in the k-th step of the Enumerator w will be printed. Thus the Enumerator will print every string M recognizes but a single string may be printed several times. An Enumerable Language is Turing Recognizable It's very easy to construct a Turing Machine M that recognizes the enumerable language L. We can have two tapes. On one tape we take the input string and on the other tape, we run the enumerator to enumerate the strings in the language one after another. Once a string is printed in the second tape we compare it with the input in the first tape. If its a match, then we accept the input, else reject.

The Rocca Meli Lupi, also called Rocca di Soragna, is a castle-palace located in the town of Soragna, Province of Parma, region of Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy. It has a rough, unfinished exteriors and highly decorated interior rooms. History A first fortress was built here by marquis Adalbert I of Milan in 985, who had received Soragna and Busseto by emperor Otto I. The area was acquired in the 12th century by the Pallacivino. In 1186 the castle was stormed by combined Guelph troops of Piacenza and Cremona. The lordship however was confirmed to the Pallavicino by emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1189. A few years later, however, the Lupi acquired the castle through marriage and started a reconstruction program. Built in 1361, the castle once belonged to the princes of the Meli Lupi family of Soragna. The castle had corner towers. In 1446, ornamental grapevine frescoes were painted in the ceilings of the courtyard portico. In 1513 the Meli inherited all the Lupi fiefs, including the castle. Further reconstructions and expansions occurred through the centuries. The castle is still inhabited by descendants of the Meli Lupi family. Ground-floor courtyard portico frescoes, depicting grapevines. Donna Cenerina is the nickname attached to Cassandra Marinoni of Milan, wife of marquis Diofebo II Meli Lupi, who was assassinated in this castle by her brother-in-law Giulio Anguissola in 1573. Legend claims her ghost still haunts the castle.Legend of Donna Cenerina , castle official website. Description The castle has a symmetrical, roughly squared plan. At the four corners are quadrangular towers. Another, narrower tower (added in the 17th century) is located at the entrance. A moat, now waterless, protects the three frontal sides. A structure in the rear area connects a tower to the S. Croce Chapel, in turn connected at a smaller fortress, the Fortino Neogotico. The latter is accompanied by a small lake surrounded by grottoes and Baroque statues. The main fa√ßade, in brickwork, is accessed through a small bridge build in the 17th century replace the former drawbridge. Two lions are placed at the side of the bridge's side walls. The central tower has a large window and balcony, above which is a small arch featuring the Meli Lupi coat of arms.

The book details Warren's life from her upbringing in Oklahoma City to her unexpectedly successful bid for the United States Senate in 2012. Content The main theme of Warren's book centers on the values of hard work and the benefits to be reaped from never giving up. In it, she describes how her experiences as a child affected her worldview of things, especially in regards to the financial status of middle class America. Warren also discusses how, over the decades, big banks and transnational corporations have managed to control almost every corridor of Washington \\"with armies of lobbyists and lawyers\\" at their beck and call. Sales Warren's book has garnered praise from a number of sources and sold better than some of her Republican counterparts. The release of the book prompted pundits to say that she is leaving open the possibility to run for president in 2016 or even 2020, in spite of the fact that she repeatedly declared that she is not running. More than 65,000 copies were sold by the third quarter of 2014, eventually leading to a paperback release one year later. Critical reception her 2020 presidential campaign, Warren signs a supporter's copy of A Fighting Chance A Fighting Chance was praised by Amy Chozick of The New York Times, who wrote, \\"The book is a potent mix of memoir and policy that makes politics seem like a necessary evil, and yet it's impossible to read Warren's story without thinking about her meteoric rise in the Democratic Party and those Warren groupies on Connecticut Avenue. That makes the aw-shucks, I-just-stumbled-into-the-Senate anecdotes that propel her narrative feel inevitably like the savvy (critics would say self-serving) story lines that would play so well at an Elks Club in Iowa.\\" Maura J. Casey of The Washington Post observed that \\"the book's message is that one person can make a difference, but change is painfully slow, uneven and the work of a lifetime. After reading this book, it is comforting to know that Elizabeth Warren, with her passion, anger and bluntness, will not be silenced.\\" A Fighting Chance was also praised by John Cassidy of The New York Review of Books, who remarked, \\"If Warren has a big idea, this is it: the conception of society as an organic, mutually dependent whole.\\" Writing for The New Yorker, the historian Jill Lepore compared the book favorably to Louis Brandeis's 1914 book Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It, writing: A Fighting Chance was similarly praised by Michael Jonas of The Boston Globe and David Lauter of the Los Angeles Times. Conversely, Mary Kissel of The Wall Street Journal was heavily critical of the book, describing it as \\"the story of how a middle-class girl rose to the Senate‚Äîand came to see the market economy that gave her the chance as 'rigged.'\\" The book was similarly attacked by Christopher Bedford for the conservative magazine National Review, who perceived it as a campaign book for Warren's anticipated entry into the 2016 presidential election. Ultimately however, Warren ended up endorsing Hillary Clinton during the last week of the Democratic primary.

History  By 1947, the Santa Fe Province starts with the proceedings for the installation of a medicine plant, to supply the Hospital Pharmacies, which became part of the Ministry of Health National Policies. It was called: Pharmaceutical Industrial Laboratory. By 1987 The Honorable Legislature of the Province passed the 10.069 Law. This Law states the official creation of the Medicinal Drugs Producing Laboratory (MDPL). By 1989 The MDPL starts its role as General Direction of Medicinal Drugs Production. It has its own staff, including a Functional Organic Structure and it takes part in the budget of the Ministry of Health as an independent program. The 11.657 Law authorizes the Executive to transform the MDPL into a State Society. By 2007 Tha last transformation of MDPL takes place during year 2007. It becomes again the Pharmaceutical Industrial Laboratory. On April 2008, the Ministry of Health passes the 286 Resolution to create the National Program for the Public Production of Medicines, Vaccines and Medical Products. In this context LIF SE became the first Public Laboratory to provide the Nation with the beta lactam antibiotic Cefalexin Tablets 500 mg. This was carried through the REMEDIAR Program. Continuity in supplying the Nation with Cefalexin during year 2009 was established, as well as the incorporation of the anti diabetics Glibenclamide 5 mg and the Amoxicillin 500 mg. The constant evolution in building- technological matters, as well as in staff training, makes LIF SE to be prepared to answer to the demands of the Provincial and National Ministry of Health. Actual LIFSE management focuses on a policy to potentiate production and make itself a variant to solve the many difficulties that may arise on Public Provincial Health. A good example of this is that the Province of Santa Fe is the only one in Argentina that will have a state trademark of its own on contraceptives and that will distribute them for free in Hospitals and to affiliated to provincial social security IAPOS.

He was Bishop of Hildesheim (1194‚Äì1199) and Bishop of W√ºrzburg (1198‚Äì1202) and served two kings as Chancellor (1194-1201).  Rise and origin  Conrad was a son of the Magdeburg Burggrave Burchard II of Querfurt and Matilda of Gleichen, a daughter of Count Lambert I zu Tonna. Conrad attended the Cathedral School in Hildesheim and later studied with Lothar of Segni in Paris, who later became Pope Innocent III. In 1182, he received a Canon position in Magdeburg. In 1188, he became a member of the royal chapel and a Provost in Goslar. In 1190, he became Provost in Magdeburg and then in 1194 in St Mary's Cathedral in Aachen.  Chancellor of Henry VI  On the Sicilian expedition of Henry VI in 1194, the Chancellor Sigelo had died and Conrad, once one of the educators of the Emperor, was appointed as his successor. The following year, Conrad was elected as Bishop of Hildesheim. In 1196, the Emperor appointed him General Legate for Apulia, Italy and Sicily. In the enforcement of Hohenstaufen rule in Southern Italy and Sicily, he played a key role. At Conrad's instigation, Peter of Eboli wrote his Liber ad honorem Augusti, that illustrated verse epic in which represented the events and appropriately recognized the merits of Conrad.  Crusade  In 1197, Conrad was with Emperor Henry's Imperial Marshal, Henry of Kalden, one of the leaders of the German Crusade of 1197. He influenced King Amalrich of Cyprus to marry Isabella I of Jerusalem and take the crown of Jerusalem.Juritsch 1894, pp. 354 Then during the siege of Toron, Conrad received news of the Emperor's and Pope Celestine III's deaths. He broke the siege, fearing the throne was disputed because of the young age of Henry's son, Frederick. Before leaving, Conrad was involved in the transformation of the hospital cooperative in the camp of Acre on 5 March 1198, into the Teutonic Order. Pope Innocent III gave this transformation of the Hospital cooperative his consent in 1198.

The school integrates teaching and research programs in the disciplines of petroleum geoscience, engineering and management and was formed in 2003. It is housed in the purpose-built Santos Petroleum Engineering Building on the University's North Terrace campus. As of 2015 the Head of the school is Steve Begg. Prior to his appointment at the university in 2002, he worked for 19 years in the oil and gas industry; for 13 of those for BP.  History  The University of Adelaide established the National Centre for Petroleum Geology and Geophysics (NCPGG) on campus in 1986. The School of Petroleum Engineering and Management (SPEM) was also established in 2000. The latter development was facilitated by a commitment to the University of AU $25 million made by oil and gas company, Santos Limited in 1999. At the time it was believed to be 'the largest single industry sponsorship ever given to a public university in Australia.' On 1 August 2001, Professor Peter Behrenbruch was appointed as the first Head of SPEM. He had been previously employed as Chief Reservoir Engineer with BHP Billiton, and a partnership between the school and his former employer soon followed. In July 2003, the NCPGG and the SPEM merged to form the Australian School of Petroleum.  Partnerships  BHP Billiton became the first corporate partner to follow Santos' original commitment of AU $25 million. The multi-national resource company committed $100,000 to funding research at the school, to be dispensed across 2002 and 2003. During a visit in 2001, Keith Hunter from BHP Billiton said of the relationship: > \\"We are looking forward to employing graduates from the School in four years > time... We have also asked Professor Behrenbruch to develop some in-house > courses for engineers already employed in BHP Billiton.\\" The University's Vice-Chancellor Cliff Blake said of the school's relationship with corporate sponsors: > \\"The company (Santos Ltd) and the University intended the School to operate > as a major resource for the benefit of the entire oil and gas industry.\\"  Scholarships and prizes  The school offers scholarships and presents prizes annually to undergraduate and postgraduate students.

The story details a convict who is being sent to prison when the train is wrecked and the sheriff escorting him is killed. The convict frees himself, but halts his escape to save the life of a little girl. As he returns the girl to her nurse, a policeman identifies and recaptures him. Later the little girl accompanies her father, the governor, on a tour of the prison and the father pardons the hero-convict. The film included scenes of a real train wreck and the scenario was written around the filming of the disaster. The film received praise for the before and after scenes which were described as shocking to The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer. The film was released on June 24, 1910, and was shown as far away as Australia. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from June 25, 1910. It states: \\"Bill Raymond, a convict, sentenced to a long term, is on his way to prison, in custody of the sheriff. A little girl [Nell] is a passenger in the same train. She shows that she feels sorry for the man. He in turn appreciates her sympathy. The train is wrecked, and the sheriff, who is handcuffed to Bill, is killed. Bill takes the key of the handcuffs from the pocket of the dead man, frees himself, and is about to escape, when he notices that the little girl, abandoned by her nurse, is lying unconscious in the car, which is now on fire. The convict risks his life to save the child, and carries her out in his arms. He takes her to her nurse and is recognized by a policeman and taken in custody, his chance for freedom lost. The child, who is the daughter of the governor, although Bill does not know it, is restored to her parent. The nurse fears to mention the incident, and the governor does not know how his darling's life was saved. Later the governor goes to the state prison on a tour of inspection, and Nell accompanies him. She has some flowers which she wants to give to the prisoners. In her tour of the prison, she recognizes Bill. She tells her father about it, and he pardons the hero-convict on the spot....\\"  Production  The impetus to produce this film appears to have been the ability of the Thanhouser crew to capture a disaster on film. Film historian Q. David Bowers writes, \\"What was one company's misfortune was another's gain, and from time to time during the next few years Thanhouser cameramen hurried to film scenes of disasters so that they could be featured as film episodes in scenarios which were written after the fact.\\" It is unknown what particular rail disaster was filmed, but a possible that the accident depicted was in the Bronx on the night of June 1, 1910. That night one stalled train, concealed in smoke from a fire, was struck by another train near the Mott Avenue subway station. One of the composite cars was shredded by the steel cars behind it; there were no fatalities in the accident. Other accidents prior to the film debut occurred in January and February. The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The only credit known for the cast is that of Marie Eline as Nell. Other members cast may have included the leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company. Crane was also involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser.  Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 985 feet long, was released on June 24, 1910. Advertisements played up the wreck of the $40,000 train car while a positive review in The Moving Picture World praised the well-managed production's prison and track wreck scenes, but remarked that the improbable story was purely fantastical. One of the more dramatic articles to appear in The Moving Picture World included reference to the film while playing up the dramatic element describe the footage and the filming of the wreck. It states: \\"... The scenes were portrayals of a train crash and they give you startling before-and-after wreck views. They made you shiver when they showed you the fate that came to a car full of passengers ‚Äì sudden, cruel and without warning. They made you shiver; ... And you thanked God that the thing before you was only a picture on the screen!\\" Known advertisements for the film included theaters in Rhode Island and Indiana. Records show that film made it to Australia, with one Launceston, Tasmania newspaper showing an advertisement on January 30, 1911. The film was still in circulation years after its production, with the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures approving this film for viewing without censorship in a May 21, 1915 decision.

Active in politics, he was a fierce advocate of public education, which was then a core part of the Republican party platform. In the 1850s, he taught at Cornell College in Iowa and Shimer College in Illinois. He later taught at Northwestern University, where he served as interim president from 1868 to 1869. He subsequently became president of Allegheny College, serving from 1883 to 1888 and again from 1890 to 1893. In addition to his educational and political work, he was known for his writings on Italian history, including Brigandage in South Italy . Early life and education Wheeler was born in Ithaca, New York in 1829; his parents moved the family to Illinois in 1846. He entered the Rock River Seminary in 1848, completing his studies in 1851. Career Wheeler first joined the staff of Cornell College in 1853, as an instructor in Greek. Because of his wife's connections to Mount Carroll, Illinois, Wheeler early joined the faculty of the Mount Carroll Seminary (which later became Shimer College). He is listed in the school's first and second catalogs, issued in 1855 and 1856, as a professor of elocution. He also served for a time as editor of the town newspaper, the Carroll County Republican, and was active in working for educational reform and the formation of a union school in the community. Wheeler returned to Cornell in 1857, and continued to teach there until receiving the ambassadorship to Italy in 1861. He received an honorary M.A. from Cornell in 1858, which was later followed by an honorary doctor of divinity in 1867. Wheeler obtained the Italian ambassadorship due to his effective service to the 1860 presidential campaign of Abraham Lincoln. In Italy, he published a two-volume study of Italian brigandage and a translation of The Conspiracy of Gianluigi Fieschi. For a time after leaving the ambassadorship, he served as a foreign correspondent for the Chicago Tribune and New York Tribune. In 1867, he returned to the United States, not wishing to raise his children overseas, and took a position as a professor of English literature at Northwestern University. Wheeler obtained his first taste of administrative grandeur when he assumed the presidency of Northwestern University on an interim basis in 1868. He stepped down from the post in 1869, but continued at Northwestern as a professor until 1875. From 1875 to 1883 he worked as editor of The Methodist magazine. From 1883 to 1888, and again from 1890 to 1893, Wheeler served as president of Allegheny College in Pennsylvania. There he saw the college through a difficult period of internal dissension, and oversaw administrative and curricular changes that included the start of postgraduate education at Allegheny. Exhaustion compelled him to retire in 1893. Wheeler died of apoplexy at his home in Meadville, Pennsylvania in 1902.

The game has only recently been developed in the country since its independence in 2006. The governing body is the Montenegrin Rugby Union which was accepted as a member of Rugby Europe (previously FIRA-AER) at the 2014 convention held in Split, Croatia. It is not yet affiliated with World Rugby but is applying for membership. History Traditionally, international rugby matches were played as FR Yugoslavia until 2003, and then as Serbia and Montenegro from 2003 to 2006. In 2011, the Porto Montenegro company started playing organised touch rugby games. Participation numbers grew and the players progressed to rugby sevens. By 2013 there were four rugby clubs in Montenegro. This was started by Beckett Tucker, Oliver Corlette and Malcolm Blaxall and coached by Milos Kucancanin, Rambo Morrison Tavana Faaletino, David Lowe and Marty Lusty A regional league began in 2014 and fixtures were also arranged with other teams around the former Yugoslavian countries. Rugby has competition from other popular sports such as water polo, soccer, handball and mixed martial arts in Montenegro. Due to the small population of the country, the country is often competing against nations who have a larger population and larger player pool. The biggest rivalry in Montenegro is currently between the clubs Podgorica and Nik≈°iƒá. An official international sevens squad was named and sent to Greece for the ENC Division B competition in 2014 this was the first time an official national rugby team was sent by Montenegro. The sport of rugby union really kicked off with the annual European Nation's Cup tournament in 2015 where the first official national side played their first match against Estonia in Bar, Montenegro. This was Montenegro first stint as an independent nation competing in rugby union and the first time the country played at home. The match ended as a win for Montenegro. The following match was a final against Slovakia and unfortunately ended in defeat. Montenegro hosted the ENC 3 competition on 15 to 21 May 2017. (Attended by Bulgaria and Slovakia to make it a three way tournament) http://www.rugbyeurope.eu/upload/file/1479558493_161118%20RE%20Staff%20Planning%20Rugby%20Europe%20Competitions%202017%20v6.PDF The tournament ended with a loss to Slovakia and a win to Bulgaria which are World Rugby ranked opposition. Montenegro is likely to play Turkey and Bulgaria in ENC 3 2018, with one game being at home and one being away. Montenegro lost to Bulgaria at home convincingly and put on a strong showing in Turkey narrowly losing buy a few points. At the sevens Montenegro put on a good showing but were unlucky not to win many games. In the 2019 season Montenegro failed to take part in the ENC 3 against Turkey and Estonia but did well to secure a 12th place finish (out of 16 teams) at the sevens conference 1 held in Belgrade for 2019 and remain in the conference. As well two kids rugby programs were started in Podgorica and in Tivat. Which is a positive sign for the future that kids will be playing rugby earlier.https://www.facebook.com/montenegrorugby/ As well positive news that rugby sevens will be making its debut at the GSSE in 2023 which is a stepping stone forward for smaller nations rugby programs.https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/rugby-sevens-to-make-its-gsse- debut-in-malta-2023.711221# Clubs As of 2017, the following clubs participate actively rugby in Montenegro: Inactive/defunct clubs *RK Buduƒánost *RK Krsta≈°i *RK Lovƒáen The club's above are currently inactive due to the failure to partake in regular matches this season. National team Montenegro's national teams are known as the Wolves (Vukovi). The country's first international rugby sevens matches were played in 2014 at the ENC Division B championship in Greece. The first match was against the favorites Switzerland, with the game ending with a final score of 15-36 to Switzerland. The team managed to win the bowl and get Montenegro's first achievement in rugby sevens. After a poor 2015 season where the team finished second to last the 2016 team had plenty to make up for. With that the team finished in the cup final with Malta and achieved promotion into Conference 1. The Montenegro national 15-a-side team first played in April 2015 when the country hosted the European Nations Cup Division 3 Competition. On 10 April 2015 The Wolves played the first international match in the country's history, winning a thrilling encounter 29‚Äì27 against Estonia in Bar. In the Final Montenegro lost 31‚Äì3 against Slovakia in Budva. And since then the team played in the second leg of that tournament by travelling up to Estonia to play the hosts Estonia in an all or nothing match. Unfortunately the Estonians edged it by 3 in a grueling contest ending hope for promotion. The team defeated Belarus for their biggest ever victory in an international competition For women's rugby it started off by an invitation to the Rugby Europe Division B tournament after the withdrawal of one of the teams in the tournament. They competed against favourites Denmark for their first match and lost heavily and were unlucky to not get a win in their debut tournament.http://www.rugbyeurope.eu/match-4147.htm The women's side got their first win against Bosnia and Herzegovina with the side finishing 12th of 16 teams. This was the first real result for the women's team.http://zeragbi.blogspot.ba/2016/07/rugby-europe-sevens-womens- conference-1_18.html Montenegro Men's XV played a 15's international test against Gibraltar. It was a poor performance from the men's side as they were heavily defeated 55-7. National caps were awarded. In the 2017 ENC hosted by Montenegro they unfortunately the team lost the first match against Slovakia and won the following against Bulgaria. Each team had a victory and even though Montenegro had scored the most tries and had a better points difference Slovakia had gotten promotion through due to changes in Rugby Europe's tie breaker rules earlier in the year. Montenegro sevens competed in Rugby Europe rugby sevens conference 1 in 2017 with a poor set of results due to external factors. With loses in all group matches and small margins in their playoff matches to stay in the conference, it ended a disappointing year for rugby in Montenegro. In the 2018 season the national team played and lost their fixtures against Bulgaria and Turkey respectfully.

The game is a parody of arcade shooters in a vein similar to the Parodius series. It was followed up with a sequel, Gun Bare! Game Tengoku 2. An updated port of the Sega Saturn version for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows, titled Game Tengoku CruisnMix, was released on November 29, 2017. Although it received a worldwide release, the developers are still working on an English translation for it, with blog updates happening occasionally.https://gameparadise2017.com/en/info.html#info20180626 The official English localization was released on November 29, 2018. A port for Nintendo Switch was released in Japan on December 19, 2019. It was released in North America and Europe on May 28, 2020. Plot Game Tengoku stands out quite notably from other arcade shooters in that its sole plot revolves around being inside several arcade games; effectively breaking the fourth wall several times. According to the official OVA surrounding the video game, the plot revolves around an employee at an arcade store about to close shop, only for a half-naked man to come in and attempt to abduct her. She is saved by a little girl (of Momoko 120% fame) whom jumps out of one of the arcade cabinets and takes her into the arcade world. From there, the adventure begins of trying to stop the evil villain from taking over all of the arcade cabinets in the world. Saturn Version The SEGA Saturn port of Game Tengoku has notable changes from the arcade original. These changes include: *New Arrange Mode. In this mode, there are two extra levels, three extra bosses, a storyline that is complete with 32-bit sprite cut-scenes that are fully voiced and a new playable character to select. The Saturn version also features a co-op 2 Player mode. *Revamped soundtrack that replaces the original, although there is no option to revert to the arcade tracks; even in Arcade Mode. *Horizontal Mode that acts as a simulation to the original Arcade Mode view on Game Tengoku cabinets. If the television can not be propped to its side to play the new view, then the directional controls can be altered as an alternative. *History of the games that the playable characters appear from. In a limited edition bundle, a VHS Tape is included that contains a sixteen-minute OVA, as well as a forty-one-minute interview of the voice cast.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Game Tengoku on their February 1, 1996 issue as being the sixteenth most-successful arcade game of the year.

Her older brother Stanis≈Çaw Janowski (1866‚Äì1942), a second husband of famous dramatist Gabriela Zapolska, was also a painter; he taught her the basics of art-making. Bronis≈Çawa studied painting in Munich from 1896 to 1902. In 1900 she married Tadeusz Rychter, a painter like herself, the son of a Lw√≥w professor. She rejected a marriage proposal from renowned Cracovian actor Ludwik Solski, even though they loved each other, because Solski was divorced and a Catholic church wedding would be out of the question. Incidentally, her subsequent marriage to Rychter was childless and openly unhappy. It lasted only for eight years. Artistic career Dames in front of a manor house, oil on canvas Bronis≈Çawa left her husband in 1908 and relocated to Stary SƒÖcz with her mother. She opened an art school, where she sparked controversy with a display of nude studies, leading to the closure of the school a year later. She traveled to Italy, North Africa, and Turkey, and stayed in Rome, Naples, and Sicily, painting landscapes, street scenes, and figurative studies. She became an active member of the Zielony Balonik Cabaret at Jama Michalika in Krak√≥w as well as art cabarets in Lw√≥w, designing and producing political puppets for widely popular shows against imperial censorship. She settled in Krak√≥w at A. Dunajewskiego 1 Street in 1917, towards the end of World War I, and continued her artistic journey in sovereign Poland.

BW Rofe Pty Ltd was a shareholder in Marra Developments, which had declared a dividend. When the time came for the payment of the dividend, the directors of Marra declined to make payment. Marra had profits available when it declared the dividend. However, between the declaration of the dividend and the date upon which it was to be paid, the assets of Marra were revalued. The revaluation caused a diminution in the book value of Marra's assets which wiped out the company's profit for the year. Marra obtained a declaration from the Supreme Court that the shareholder was not to payment of the dividend,Marra Developments Ltd v BW Rofe Pty Ltd [1977] 1 NSWLR 162; 2 ACLR 298. Supreme Court. and the shareholder appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal, Moffitt P, Hutley and Mahoney , unanimously upheld the appeal, holding that profits need only be available at the time the dividend is declared, not at the time when it is to be paid. Hutley JA held that an interim dividend was entirely provisional and anticipates the profits to be disclosed in the final accounts. In relation to a final dividend, as the dividend became payable on declaration, each shareholder became entitled to be paid the debt thereby created. Marra had argued that the subsequent events meant the dividend would not be payable out of profits. Hutley JA held that: > If from the profit and loss account ... there is sufficient to permit the > declaration of the dividend, the losses between the end of the financial > year in which these accounts are produced cannot be used to prevent, on > legal grounds, the declaration and payment of a dividend, unless the > subsequent revealed losses invalidate the accounts themselves.

He was the son of Hydarnes I, satrap of the Persian empire and one of the seven conspirators against Gaumata. During the reign of Xerxes I, Hydarnes was one of the commanders for the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC. He was appointed as the leader of the 10,000-man contingent of \\"Immortals\\", while his brother Sisamnes commanded the levy of the Aryans.Herodotus:Histories VII, 66 and 83 On the first day of the Battle of Thermopylae, Hydarnes led the Immortals against the phalanx of Spartans under Leonidas I, but an attempt to break through failed.Herodotus: Histories. VII, 211 On the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by telling the Persians about a hidden goat path around Thermopylae. This enabled Hydarnes and his Immortals to pass behind the Spartans, Thespians and Thebans and, as a result, defeat them.Herodotus: Histories. VII, 215 and 218. After the Persians were defeated at the Battle of Salamis, Xerxes I decided to return to Asia leaving a large army under Mardonius which wintered in Thessaly. Hydarnes wanted to stay at the side of the king and go back with him to Asia. So Xerxes tasked Hydarnes with the responsibility of getting the Persian army back over the Hellespont to Asia.Herodotus: Histories. VIII, 113. Herodotus: Histories.

The Long Truss style bridge with double lanes, triple covered spans and one 70 foot draw span was built by Hirem Bishop in 1852-53 and destroyed by electric cutting wire in 1899. History =Construction= This is the \\"1/2\\" bridge of Parke County. It crossed the Wabash River at Clinton, In, located in Vermillion County, Indiana. The bridge had originally been proposed by the Wabash and Erie Canal to connect Clinton with Clinton Locks, now Lyford. Canal Engineer T.L. Williams had estimated that the bridge would cost between $25,000 and $30,000, the Wabash & Erie Canal even gave $16,700 towards the bridge with the balance to be paid by the farms and citizens of Clinton. In a letter dated September 10, 1851 to Joseph J. Daniels there is indication that he and A.B. Condit intended to bid on the contract for the bridge under the name of Daniels and Condit Bridge Builders. However, in 1852 the contract was awarded to a Mr. Bishop; this could be the same C.W. Bishop that is credited with building Irishman's Bridge in Vigo County in 1845. He in turn hired his brother, Hirem Bishop, as foreman. Hirem was also credited as the builder. Bishop purchased two lots located north of the bridge site which he used to build the bridge frames starting in 1852. In June 1853 the frames were dismantled and reassembled on the piers already built in the Wabash River. It can be noted that the two lots stayed in the Bishop family for years with Hirem building a \\"home place\\" on one lot with his son building a house on the other lot. Today these lots are occupied by Mike's Motors. =Use= To partially recover the costs of construction and maintenance, also to earn a profit, the Clinton Covered Bridge was a toll bridge, because of this it would also be considered a private bridge. The toll keepers lived and worked out of the toll house located on the north corner of the Clinton side of the bridge. Francis Cunningham would be the toll keeper from around 1870 until his death in 1880. A.T. Patterson, who worked for J.J. Daniels building the Terra Haute Ohio Street Covered Bridge and Hirem Bishop building the Clinton Covered Bridge, worked as a toll keeper in his retirement years. There is a source that claims a Mr. Weber was the last toll keeper, but another source states that John H. Birt was actually the last toll keeper. Mr. Birt lived in the toll house and maintained a shoe shop there where he made and repaired shoes. Dr. J.H. Bogart was the last private owner of the bridge. In February 1892 he sold it to the Vermillion County Commissions for $4,500 with a few stipulations. First, he wanted to retain possession and continue collecting tolls until the bridge was destroyed, and, second, he would be the one to destroy it, in a safe and acceptable manner. =Destruction= It was felt by the newly formed Businessmen's Association of Clinton that the bridge needed to be replaced by a free bridge because Clinton had transformed from pork packing houses on the river to a downtown business financed and frequented by coal miners from Parke County. The association claimed that the toll bridge was keeping the miners out of Clinton and keeping them from spending money in their stores. It's claimed that the deadline for the original contract to dismantle the bridge was not met and that the idea for the eventual destruction of the bridge came to Dr. Bogart while he sat on his Mulberry Street office's porch in August 1899. Seeing a bolt of lightning convinced Dr. Bogart that electricity could be used. There was a young electrician across the street named Henry Mills, along with Roscoe Russel and Carl F. Balmer, that would wire the bridge for electrocution. According to Balmer they drilled holes through the spans and threaded the wires through, they then hung weights on the wires to pull them through the timbers and drop the spans into the Wabash River below. Using this method would avoid the dangers of a dynamite blast or dismantling the bridge piece by piece and allow the lumber to be reused. The town generator, later to be owned by [Public Service of Indiana], was run by Balmer, but only capable of 1100 volts. Because of this they \\"reversed the currant to increase the amperage\\"(sic). No details were published the day of the demolition and the whole town had turned out by early morning to watch. By lunch time nothing had happened and they began to laugh and make fun of Dr. Bogart. The draw span had already been removed and the east end was wired to burn first. It wasn't until the afternoon that a thin smoke without any noticeable flame was finally seen. Then pieces of the spans began to drop into the water below which men in boats began to gather. With the success the remaining spans were wired and dismantled in the same way. The amazing method was talked about all over the county.

Ly6 are cysteine-rich proteins that form disulfide bridges and contain a LU domain. These proteins are GPI-anchored to the cell membrane or are secreted. A total of 35 human and 61 mouse Ly6 family members have been identified. Depending on which tissues they are expressed in, LY6 family members have different roles. They are expressed in various types of tissues and their expression dependent on the stage of cell differentiation. For example, they are involved in cell proliferation, cell migration, cell‚Äìcell interactions, immune cell maturation, macrophage activation, and cytokine production. Their overexpression or dysregulation, for example due to point mutations, is associated with tumorogenesis and autoimmune diseases. This family was discovered in the 1970s, and these proteins are still used as markers of distinct stage of leukocyte differentiation.  Gene organization  Genes encoding human Ly6 family members are located in clusters on chromosomes 6, 8, 11 and 19. In the murine genome family members are located on chromosomes 17, 15, 9 and 7, respectively. Genes encoding Ly6 proteins with one LU domain consist of 3 exons and 2 introns. The first exon encodes the signal peptide, Exons 2 and 3 encode the LU domain, and exon 3 also encodes the GPI anchor.  Protein structure  Ly6 proteins are characterized by the LU domain. Typically, they contain one LU domain, but some members of the family have multiple LU domains. The LU domain consists of 60-80 AA and contains 10 cysteines arranged in a specific pattern that allows the creation of 5 disulfide bridges which in turn allow the formation of a three-fingered (3F) structural motif. Based on their subcellular localization, these proteins are classified as GPI-anchored to the cell membrane or secreted.  Expression  Although the Ly6 family members share a common structure, their expression varies in different tissues and is regulated depending on the stage of cell differentiation. Many Ly6 family members are expressed in hematopoietic precursors and differentiated hematopoietic cells in a lineage-specific manner and making them useful cell surface markers for leukocytes, facilitating identification of distinct leukocyte sub-population. Further, the Ly6 family proteins are also expressed, for example, by sperm, neurons, keratinocytes and epithelial cells.  Function  Ly6 family proteins have different functions depending on expression in different tissues. They play an important role in the immune response to infection and maintaining homeostasis in response to varying environmental conditions. It is involved in cell proliferation, cell migration, cell‚Äìcell interactions, immune cell maturation, macrophage activation, and cytokine production. It is also involved in complement activity, neuronal activity, angiogenesis, tumorogenesis and wound healing.  Clinical relevance  Many Ly6 family proteins (with the notable exception of SLURP1) are over-expressed in inflamed tissues and in tumors. They are therefore used as tumor markers and are also potential therapeutic targets. Some point mutations in Ly6 family proteins are associated with autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis vulgaris.
