Buildings LEMS has a total of three buildings, two permanent and one temporary. The main building was originally constructed in 1955 and has been given additions ever since. The most recent of these is a 6¬Ω million dollar addition completed in April 2008. The one remaining temporary building is now set to be torn down to make way for a new gymnasium, raising the total number of gymnasiums to three. Accreditation LEMS is fully accredited by the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCA CASI).Institution Summary, AdvancED, Retrieved 2012-07-08 Every five years the school is visited by the NCA CASI to assess the success of the school's individual school improvement plan. The professional and auxiliary staff members at school complete an in-depth report which addresses one affective and one cognitive area that the school has chosen to address in an outcomes based school improvement plan. This self-study is submitted to the NCA CASI for their review and evaluation. In addition to the accreditation visits, annual reports are submitted to the NCA CASI, which serves as an update for the original self-study. The process of self-evaluation is continuous. Extracurricular activities LEMS offers a various number of clubs for students to join. *Technology Club *Junior Leadership Seminar (JLS) *Foreign Language Club *Story Hour *Brain Bowl *Student Council *military history club *National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) *Jazz Band *Drama Club *Math Counts *German Study Club *Yearbook Club Student government The student government of LEMS is made up entirely of LEMS students grades 6-8 and one adult sponsor. In the student council (or STUCO), the entire 6-8 student body (the middle school) selects a STUCO president from the eighth grade class. They then select a vice president from either the seventh or eighth grade class. Each grade also selects one student from their own grade to represent their grade as a whole, who becomes that grade's senator. Each seminar then selects a representative from their class to act as their seminar class representative. Additional student representatives are the secretary and the parliamentarian. All of their offices are elected by use of secret ballots. Once one is elected, the elected person holds the office for the duration of the year except for special circumstances, such as an unexpected move or promotion. If one so wishes, one may run again the next year, as STUCO offices are open to all LEMS students grades 6-8. The student council supports the students in such ways as organizing dances, spirit weeks, and other miscellaneous events during the school year.

Life and career Born in Sonoma County, Calif., and raised in Petaluma, Kelly set his sights on working at Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) at age five when the movie Star Wars hit the big screen. Under the tutelage of animators Bill Hennes and John Root, he studied drawing and computer software throughout high school, attended community college, and Academy of Art University in San Francisco. A summer internship at ILM introduced Kelly to another influential mentor, animation director Wayne Gilbert. It was through Gilbert that Kelly realized that he wasn‚Äôt learning what he needed at school. Kelly left the academy in 1996 for a job as a character animator at former video game and educational company Presage Software, but continued his studies with Gilbert twice a week. In 1998, Kelly fulfilled his lifelong dream and landed a job at ILM. Since that time, he has worked on numerous films including War of the Worlds, for which he animated tripods and probes; Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, where he helped develop and animate the vulture droids and animated Yoda in a pivotal sword fight; and Rango, where he was the Lead Animator for both the Mayor of Dirt and the Spirit of the West. Kelly also worked as Lead Animator on all five Transformers movies. Kelly‚Äôs credits feature 29 films including Hulk, the Star Wars prequels, AI: Artificial Intelligence, and The Avengers. Because Kelly realized his dream to animate films with the help of three mentors who took a personal interest in his career, he became convinced that animation lovers everywhere should have the same opportunity, and he co-founded Animation Mentor, an online animation school with student/mentor relationships at its core. Kelly works with Bobby Beck, Animation Mentor‚Äôs CEO and President, and cofounder Carlos Baena to help define and shape the school‚Äôs overall direction.

It was directed by Nicholas Ray, with Robert Wagner portraying Jesse James and Jeffrey Hunter starring as Frank James. Filming took place during 1955. Originally titled The James Brothers in the United Kingdom, the film focused on the relationship between the two James brothers during the last 18 years of Jesse James' life. Plot Jesse (Robert Wagner) and Frank James (Jeffrey Hunter) ride with their gang into Northfield, Minnesota for a raid. While robbing a bank, gun fighting breaks out and two of the gang are killed. The James brothers and another gang member head out of town and hide out while investigators from the Remington Detective Agency search for James to receive a $30,000 reward. While the three are hiding, the film tells the story of how the James brothers came to be criminals in flashback.

He had only one movie left under his contract with 20th Century Fox, before he would depart for Europe and film Bitter Victory. The studio suggested a remake of King's 1939 biography of Jesse James. It is speculated that had James Dean not died in a car crash before production began, he would have starred in this film as Jesse James. In place of Dean, director Ray hoped to cast Elvis Presley, who had successfully completed his first film, Love Me Tender. Ray's son Tony also was cast in the film as Bob Younger, the first time he appeared in one of his father's films. Hope Lange, a contract player for 20th Century Fox, was hired for the role of Jesse's wife after her Academy Award-nominated success with Peyton Place. John Carradine had appeared in the first Jesse James film as Bob Ford and appears in the 1957 version as Rev. Jethro Bailey. Ray shot the film using CinemaScope, a new technology at that time. The movie was shot in 1956. Stock footage that had previously been used on the earlier James film which inspired this one was re- used and reconfigured for CinemaScope. Characterizations In the film, Jesse James is portrayed as a \\"Nicholas Ray hero\\"‚Äîa consistent type of character seen throughout Ray's films and thought to be based on Ray himself. Ray's similar characters include Jim Stark (James Dean) in Rebel Without a Cause and Jesus Christ in King of Kings.

The project by Meridian Energy was expected to cost $300 million. In April 2010, resource consents to dam the M≈çkihinui River were granted to Meridian. In May 2010 the Department of Conservation lodged an appeal with the Environment Court. On 22 May 2012 Meridian Energy cancelled the project, withdrawing it from the Environment Court. The project was withdrawn due to high costs and environmental concerns and the project's risks and uncertainties. Description The power station was expected to generate up to a year, or 14 percent more than the annual electricity consumption of the entire West Coast region (). It would also provide much needed electricity generation to the Upper South Island, as local generation is well short of local demand and most of the electricity has to be transmitted from the Waitaki Valley, over away. The dam was proposed to be high and the resulting long lake would have covered of native forest. Consultation In 2007, Meridian Energy Limited consulted affected parties about its proposal to place a hydro-electric dam on the M≈çhikinui River. The dam would have been located upstream from Seddonville, between it and the M≈çkihinui River Forks. Meridian Energy began investigating the proposal in 2006, following from similar studies conducted by the New Zealand Ministry of Works in the 1960s and 1970s. On 15 March 2008, the West Coast Regional Council called for public submissions on Meridian's applications for resource consents. Forest and Bird opposed the dam and accused Meridian of not making public a report from Landcare Research that advised that the hydro scheme would cause significant adverse environmental effects. Recreational use after construction Meridian Energy stated that there would be recreational benefits with the lake formed by the proposed dam. Boat ramps would be provided for access onto the new lake. A local trust was planned that would have an access track, called the Old Ghost Road, pushed through to Lyell, following a historic gold miners' route. Opposition Opposition to the proposal had been expressed by a number of conservation, recreational, environmental and fishing organisations including: *Buller Conservation Group *Council of Outdoor Recreation Associations of NZ *Department of Conservation *Federated Mountain Clubs *Fish and Game New Zealand *Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand *Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand *NZ Federation of Freshwater anglers *New Zealand Historic Places Trust *NZ Rafting Association *NZ Recreational Canoeing Association *West Coast Environmental Network *West Coast Tai Poutini Conservation Board *West Coast Waitbaiter's Association *World Wildlife Fund NZ The opposition was due to number of reasons: the river and the of forest that would be inundated has high intrinsic natural values, it is regarded as a scenic river, and it has valued recreational use for whitewater activities and tramping. In April 2010, the Department of Conservation stated that it had lodged an appeal with the Environment Court of the decision to grant the resource consents to Meridian Energy.

The title of the book is taken from a passage in Chapter 13 (on page 218 of the first printing of the hardcover edition). The sentence reads \\"I turned my head and saw, beyond the shoulder of my beloved, the empty copper sea, hushed and waiting, as if the world had paused between breaths.\\" The novel was adapted as the television movie Travis McGee (1983), starring Sam Elliott. The film abandoned the Florida locales in favor of California. Plot summary A wealthy landowner/investor named Hub Lawless has disappeared off the west coast of Florida; supposedly fallen overboard during a storm and drowned. The captain of the boat, Van Harder, is blamed, having been found drunk and passed out when the boat returned to shore. But all is not as it appears and it's possible that the dead man faked his own death and is, instead, living in Mexico with a lover, avoiding the eventual failure of his businesses. Harder comes to McGee, asking him to salvage his reputation as a boat captain. He has placed a value of $20,000 on his \\"good name\\" and has offered $10,000 to McGee in payments over time to find out the truth of what happened. McGee and Meyer travel to the Gulf Coast of Florida, undercover as investors, to find out the truth of what happened.

He was the head of the southern Russian republic of Ingushetia, appointed by President Dmitry Medvedev, from 31 October 2008 to 24 June 2019. The following day, the People's Assembly of the Republic of Ingushetia, the republic's regional parliament, voted in favor of Yevkurov's appointment, making him the third Head of Ingushetia. He is a career soldier, paratrooper, and Hero of the Russian Federation who was involved in numerous conflicts where Russia played a key role, including Kosovo (1999) and Chechnya. On 22 June 2009, Yevkurov was seriously injured following a car-bomb attack on his motorcade in the city of Nazran. On 23 October 2011, Yevkurov was again a target of an attack whilst on a national holiday. As head of Ingushetia, Yevkurov claimed he had succeeded in stabilising the crime situation and bringing about positive social changes within the Russian republic. Since September 2018, he faced opposition at home, following the controversial land transfer deal with the neighboring Republic of Chechnya. He was appointed as a Deputy Defence Minister by President Putin on 8 July. Early life Yevkurov, an ethnic Ingush, was born on 23 July 1963 into a peasant family of 12 children, consisting of five sisters and six brothers. He graduated from the same school that was later the scene of the Beslan massacre. Military service Yevkurov was conscripted by the Soviet Army in 1982, serving in the Naval Infantry of the Pacific Fleet. In 1989, he graduated from the Ryazan Guards Higher Airborne Command School. Yevkurov continued his military education, graduating from the Frunze Military Academy in 1997 and from the General Staff Academy in 2004. In June 1999, Yevkurov was stationed in the Bosnian town of Ugljevik with the Russian peacekeepers under the auspices of SFOR. On 12 June, he led a task force on a swift 500-km-long march, which aimed to secure the Pristina International Airport ahead of the NATO troops, thus ensuring a Russian presence in Kosovo after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. This led to a standoff with NATO troops. Yevkurov has had various positions of command within the Russian Airborne Troops and has participated in counterterrorist operations in the North Caucasus. During the course of the Second Chechen War in 2000, he was in command of the 217th Guards Airborne Regiment (98th Guards Airborne Division). While on a reconnaissance mission, Yevkurov's team discovered a house where a group of captured Russian soldiers was held. Having neutralized the guards and infiltrated the building, the team was surrounded by Chechen reinforcements, resulting in armed combat. The Russian troops were able to break through the encirclement while Yevkurov was providing cover for the evacuation of the wounded. He personally carried a soldier to safety despite sustaining an injury himself. Twelve imprisoned soldiers were rescued. On 13 April 2000, Yevkurov, for his courage, was presented with the Hero of Russia award, the country's highest title of honor. In 2004, Yevkurov was appointed to be the Intelligence Division Deputy Commander of the Volga-Urals Military District. Political career On 30 October 2008, Yevkurov replaced the highly unpopular Murat Zyazikov as the head of Ingushetia. Zyazikov's dismissal and Yevkurov's appointment were received with much enthusiasm from the Ingush population. =Assassination attempt= On 22 June 2009, Yevkurov was seriously injured following a car- bomb attack on his motorcade in the city of Nazran at roughly 08:20 local time (04:20 GMT). In the incident, a Toyota Camry filled with explosives rammed the Yevkurov's convoy in what is believed to be a suicide bomb attack. One escorting policeman died on the spot; Yevkurov's driver and cousin Ramzan died a few days later in a hospital. Yevkurov's brother Uvais was among the injured. Yevkurov suffered a ruptured liver, a severe concussion, and several cracked ribs, but was expected to survive following surgery. Yevkurov was then airlifted to a hospital in Moscow and was sent to intensive care with damage to his skull and internal organs, according to the New York Times. Though no group has yet claimed responsibility, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev accused Islamist militants of carrying out the attack, condemning the \\"terrorist attack\\". Speaking on Russian television, Medvedev claimed that Yevkurov \\"did a lot to restore order ... and the bandits obviously didn't like that kind of activity\\". Russian news agency RIAN, quoting an unnamed Kremlin source, reported that executive authority in Ingushetia has been temporarily transferred to the prime minister, Rashid Gaisanov, who became acting Head by Russian presidential decree. The source claimed that \\"President Medvedev authorized Gaysanov to take operative management of the republic, and he has all the required authority for that\\". Gaisanov remained the acting head of Ingushetia until Yevkurov returned to office. The attack followed other attacks on republic officials in June 2009. On 10 June, the deputy chief justice of the Ingushetian Supreme Court, Aza Gazgireyeva, was gunned down in Nazran shortly after dropping her children off at school, and on 13 June the former deputy prime minister, Bashir Aushev, was shot dead outside his home. After the attack, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov claimed the Kremlin had ordered him to fight insurgents in Ingushetia, and during his subsequent visit to Ingushetia on 24 June pledged to revenge ruthlessly. On 4 July, a convoy of Chechen troops sent by Kadyrov into Ingushetia in response to the suicide bombing was ambushed by militants. The attack caused nine Chechen deaths, with 10 others severely wounded. On 9 July, Ingushetia's Interior Ministry announced the arrest of several suspects, including the Chechen rebel commander Rustaman Makhauri, allegedly involved in the attack on Yevkurov.Suspects Arrested In Attack On Ingushetian President. RFE/RL. 9 July 2009 Yevkurov regained consciousness from a coma two weeks after the attack. Yevkurov was released from the hospital in Moscow on 12 August 2009, more than seven weeks after the attack, but continued to receive rehabilitation. Speaking to reports upon leaving the hospital, Yevkurov warned that \\"those who refuse to lay down their arms and surrender will be killed.\\" By September, 2009, Yevkurov had returned to his position of head of the republic. =Till resignation= On July 2013, he announced his own resignation following the upcoming elections to the Ingush presidency, though he remained the acting head until the elections. He was re-elected in the 2013 Ingush Head election.

Netsvetov chose a life with the Church and enrolled in the Irkutsk Theological Seminary.\\"Repose of St Jacob Netsvetov the Enlightener of the Peoples of Alaska\\", Orthodox Church in America Missionary work On October 1, 1825, Netsvetov was tonsured a sub- deacon. He married Anna Simeonovna, a Russian woman perhaps of a Creole background as was he, and then in 1826 he graduated from the seminary with certificates in history and theology. With graduation he was ordained a deacon on October 31, 1826 and assigned to the Holy Trinity-St. Peter Church in Irkutsk. Two years later, Archbishop Michael ordained Netsvetov to the holy priesthood on March 4, 1828. Netsvetov was the first native Alaskan to be ordained to the priesthood.\\"Saint Jacob Netsvetov\\", Orthodox Christian Network Archbishop Michael had earlier ordained John Veniaminov (St. Innocent) to the priesthood. With his elevation to the priesthood, Netsvetov began to yearn to return to his native Alaska to preach the Word of God. Upon departing, Archbishop Michael gave Netsvetov two antimensia, one for use in the new church that Netsvetov planned to build on Atka, and the other for use in Netsvetov's missionary travels. After a molieben, Netsvetov and his party set off for Alaska on May 1, 1828. The travelers included Netsvetov, Anna his wife, and his father Yegor who had been tonsured reader for the new Atka Church. This journey, which was always hard, took over a year to complete, and was completed on June 15, 1829. Netsvetov's new parish was a challenge. The Atka \\"parish\\" covered most of the islands and land surrounding the Bering Sea: Amchitka, Attu, Copper, Bering, and Kurile Islands. But, he was to meet the challenge as clothed in his priestly garments, he actively pursued his sacred ministry. To his parishioners, his love for God and them was evident in everything he did as he made his appearances while enduring the harsh weather, illness, hunger, and exhaustion. Being bi-lingual and bi-cultural, Netsvetov was uniquely able to care for the souls of his community. Since St. Nicholas Church was not yet available, Netsvetov used a large tent in which to hold his services, and after the church was completed he took the tent with him on his missionary travels. By the end of 1829, six months after arriving at Akta Netsvetov had recorded 16 baptisms, 442 chrismations, 53 marriages, and eight funerals. With the completion of the church on Atka, Netsvetov turned to education of the children, teaching them to read and write both Russian and Unangan Aleut. Initially the Russian-American Company helped support the school, but in 1841 the school was re-organized as a parish school. Many of his students would prove to be distinguished Aleut leaders. While living in the north areas was difficult, Netsvetov was active in the intellectual life as well; in addition to his own subsistence needs, he was active in collecting and preparing fish and marine animal specimens for the museums in Moscow and St. Petersburg. He corresponded with St Innocent on linguistics and translation matters. He worked on an adequate Unangan-Aleut alphabet and translations of the Holy Scriptures\\"St. Jacob (Netsvetov) ‚Äì The Enlightener of peoples of Alaska\\", Russian Orthodox church Outside of Russia, New York City deanery and other church publications. In addition to praises from St. Innocent he began to receive awards for his services. In time he was elevated to Archpriest and received the Order of St. Anna. Netsvetov's life was not without its personal sufferings. 1836 and 1837 were to bring successively the death of his beloved wife Anna in March 1836, the destruction by fire of his home in July 1836, and the death of his father, Yegor, in 1837. After considering the message of these misfortunes, he petitioned his bishop to return to Irkutsk so that he could enter a monastic life. A year later his request was granted contingent on the arrival of his replacement. But none came. Soon Bishop Innocent arrived and invited Netsvetov to accompany him on a trip to Kamchatka. During the voyage Bishop Innocent seemed to have accomplished three things with Netsvetov: with the healing salve of the Holy Spirit provided words of comfort, dissuaded Netsvetov from entering a monastery, and revealed to the saintly priest the Savior's true plan for his life that was for him to preach Christ to those deep in the Alaskan interior. On December 30, 1844, St. Innocent appointed him head of the new Kvikhpak Mission to bring the light of Christ to the people along the Yukon River. With two young Creole assistants, Innokentii Shayashnikov and Konstantin Lukin, and his nephew Vasili Netsvetov, Netsvetov established his headquarters in the Yup'ik Eskimo village of Ikogmiute. From there, now known as Russian Mission, he traveled to the settlements for hundreds of miles along the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers, visiting the inhabitants of settlements along the way. For the next twenty years he learned new languages, met new people and cultures, invented another alphabet, and built more churches and communities. At the invitation of the native leaders he traveled as far as the Innoko River baptizing hundreds from many, and often formerly hostile, tribes. He continued even as his health deteriorated. An assistant lodged spurious and slanderous charges against him in 1863. To clear the air his Bishop Peter called him to Sitka where he was cleared of all the charges. As his health worsened he remained in Sitka serving at the Tlingit chapel until his death on July 26, 1864. He was 60 years old. Netsvetov was buried at the entrance to the chapel.\\"St. Jacob Netsvetov, Enlightener of the Peoples of Alaska\\", St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church, Boston, Massachusetts During his last missionary travels in the Kuskokwim/Yukon delta region he is remembered for baptizing 1,320 people and for distinguishing himself as the evangelizer of the Yup'k Eskimo and Athabascan peoples.

He was active in establishing parishes and aiding communities, mainly in the Midwest. After returning to Russia he was assigned to Estonia where he put into action the teaching skills he learned in America before he was assigned in 1916 to Tsarskoe Selo. Here he was killed during the early days of the Bolshevik revolution. His feast day is celebrated on October 31. He is also commemorated on the feast of the New Martyrs and Confessors of Russia, celebrated on the Sunday nearest to January 25, which was the date of the martyrdom of Metropolitan Vladimir of Kiev, the first of the new martyrs. Early years  John Kochurov was born on June 13, 1871. His father was a priest. His education included attendance at the Ryazan Theological Seminary before continuing at the St. Petersburg Theological Academy. He excelled at his studies at both the seminary and academy. After graduating in 1895, Fr. John married and then entered his life's work when he was ordained deacon. On August 27, 1895, he was ordained a priest at the St. Alexander Nevsky Lavra in St. Petersburg by Bishop Nicholas (Ziorov) of the Diocese of the Aleutians and Alaska. America The Rt. Rev Weller as an Anglican bishop at the Cathedral of St. Paul the Apostle in the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac, with the Rt. Rev. Anthony Kozlowski of the Polish National Catholic Church and Saint Tikhon of Moscow (along with his chaplains Fr. John Kochurov and Fr. Sebastian Dabovich) of the Russian Orthodox Church present Having expressed the desire to be a missionary priest in the United States, Fr. John was soon transferred and became the first permanent priest at St. Vladimir's Church in Chicago. This parish was later to become the Holy Trinity Cathedral. As St. Vladimir's parish did not yet have their own building, his first major project was construction of the church building. Under the guidance of Bishop Tikhon, later Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow and saint, Fr. John enlisted the services of the noted architect Louis Sullivan to design the church. To finance the project, Fr. John sought and obtained donations from Tsar Nicholas II as well as from a few Americans, notably Harold McCormick and Charles R. Crane who was the American ambassador to China. Construction of the church began in April 1902 and was completed the next year for the consecration by Bishop Tikhon. Fr. John devoted much effort to aiding the establishment of other parishes in the Chicago area. He performed the first service for the future Archangel Michael Orthodox Church in southwest Chicago. In the Chicago area he was active in the formation of the parishes in Madison, Streator, and Joliet (all in Illinois), as well as aiding the parishes in Buffalo, NY, and Hartshorn, OK. On the social side of parish life, he, with Fr. Alexis Toth, future Saint Alexis of Wilkes-Barre, was influential in the establishment of a major Orthodox mutual aid society that provided support for the many newly arrived immigrants. He also translated religious texts into English, looking to the time when the church in America would consist of English-speaking members. Before his return to Russia, Fr. John helped to organize the first All- American Council that was held in Mayfield, Pennsylvania, in 1907. Russia and martyrdom Fr, John returned to Russia in 1907 where he was assigned to Narva (now Estonia). Here he put to use the skills he had learned in the United States teaching catechism in the schools. Then in 1916, he was transferred to St. Catherine's Cathedral in Tsarskoye Selo, just outside St. Petersburg. At St. Catherine's, he established himself as a popular priest who was skilled in presenting moving sermons. Then in October 1917 the Bolshevik uprising in St. Petersburg spilled over quickly into Tsarskoye Selo as the town was attacked by Bolshevik elements. The people thronged to the churches where the clergy held prayer services and led processions throughout the town praying for peace. On October 31, 1917 (Old Style), the Bolsheviks entered Tsarskoe Selo in force and arrested Fr. John. He was taken by the Bolsheviks out of town where he was summarily shot. By this act, Fr. John became the proto-hieromartyr of the Bolshevik revolution and the Soviet yoke. Fr. John was buried several days later in the crypt of St. Catherine's Cathedral. On December 1994, Fr. John was glorified by the Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church, in session at St. Daniel's Monastery, Moscow, Russia, as the first of the new martyrs of the 20th century. In the United States he is also honored as a missionary and inspired preacher.

He came to the United States as a monk in the early twentieth century and was instrumental in the founding of St Tikhon's Monastery in South Canaan, Pennsylvania. He was administrator of the Canadian parishes under Abp. Platon (Rozhdestvensky) before returning in 1910 to Russia where he stayed until after the Russian Civil War. In 1926, he was elected Bishop of Winnipeg. He retired to St. Tikhon's Monastery where he established the Pastoral School. Life Andrew Lvovich Chagovstov was born on March 10, 1866, into the family of a village church reader in the Kharkov Eparchy. As a young boy he tended his father's sheep, but his intelligence and love for school did not go unnoticed. When his father died, leaving him as the eldest of five children, he was sent to a school for clergy children for eleven years. From there he was admitted to the Kharkov Theological Seminary from which he graduated with distinction in 1887. The same year he was ordained a deacon and then priest. His years in the seminary and thereafter are only vaguely known. He apparently married while in the seminary and was assigned as a priest to a village church in Kharkov. There is a question as to whether he had a son, but soon his wife died, probably about 1890, of an unknown cause. At some point later he was tonsured a monk with the name Arseny, in honor of St. Arsenius of Konevits. But, his journey from his wife's death to his tonsure was a time of great anguish as he related in his elevation speech as Bishop of Winnipeg. In 1900, he was appointed Igumen (Abbot) of Kuriansk Monastery. Two years later he joined Bp. Tikhon in America as he was a natural preacher with fluency in many Russian dialects, and thus, well suited to the American missionary scene. He was active among those returning from the Unia and served many communities after his arrival, including Troy, New York, and Mayfield and Simpson, Pennsylvania. While he was active among the people, a dream of his came true when with the blessing of the then Abp. Tikhon, Hieromonk Arseny founded the St. Tikhon's Monastery and orphanage in the rural countryside near Carbondale and Mayfield, Pennsylvania at South Canaan. The Wagner farm was purchased for $2,580 during the summer of 1905. On the day of its dedication, July 31, 1905, a crowd on foot formed a pilgrimage walk of the ten miles through the mountains from Mayfield to the site of the new monastery. On the following May 30, 1906, at the dedication of the chapel at the partially finished monastery building with Abp. Tikhon present, Bp. Raphael spoke of the hard work by Fr. Igumen Arseny for the realization of the monastery. When Fr. Arseny was named the superior of the monastery, the crowd answered loudly, \\"He is worthy.\\" The anniversary of this dedication has become an annual Memorial Day pilgrimage to the monastery. Then, in 1908, Fr. Arseny was appointed by then Abp. Platon to the position of dean and administrator of the Canadian parishes. With his knowledge of the many dialects of the Carpatho-Russian/Galician area and his ability to preach in them, the Canadian faithful (who mainly hailed from those areas) almost immediately fell in love with him. With these rare missionary talents, he had great success with receiving back Uniats as well as welcoming many Galicians and Bukovinians who were arriving in numbers to Canada. His preaching produced for him the affectionate title \\"The Canadian Chrysostom.\\" After only two years, however, he returned to Russia in 1910. Little is known for certain of why he returned to Russia or his activities while there. In his request to the Synod, he wrote: :In January of this year, I completed seven years of service in the American Orthodox Mission. I worked, by the mercy of God, as I could, attempting not to be lazy, to carry on the high calling of a missionary, to make a steady effort, not operating solely from rationality/intellect. In the last two years of my service, heavy afflictions and laborious work in the Canadian wilds had taken their toll on my health, and material lack have repeatedly brought my spirit to full despondency. In the last while I have been fully invalided with a terrible hernia, which from the constant journeying creates horrible pain; doctors are trying to force me towards a surgery, but I am afraid to lie beneath a knife, lest I die in this foreign land.–ü—Ä–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–º–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∏—Ç–∞ –ê—Ä—Å–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ—Ç 20 –Ø–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è 1910 –≥–æ–¥–∞, No 25.

Translated and quoted in Detailed Timeline Vita of Archbishop Arseny by The Canonization Committee of the Orthodox Church in Canada, section 35, pp. 20-21. Upon his return to Russia, there are some reports are that he was involved in the training of missionary-priests and that he headed a monastery in the Crimea. After the October Revolution, he served with the White Army to comfort the soldiers. In 1920, he was able to get to Yugoslavia and entered a monastery. Some of his old Canadian flock learned that he was still alive and petitioned Metropolitan Platon to return him to Canada as a bishop. Thus, the holy synod under Platon elected him Bishop of Winnipeg and requested his consecration, which took place on June 6, 1926, in Yugoslavia. Bishop Arseny traveled to New York to meet with the metropolitan, visit his beloved St Tikhon's Monastery, and then continue on to his new cathedral. It was, however, a different place from that which he left sixteen years before. The seeds of violence from the Red Revolution, Ukrainian nationalism, and the Living Church made his task difficult, even to the point of being injured by gun fire. In 1936, he was assigned briefly to Detroit and Cleveland before retiring to St Tikhon's Monastery where he was appointed archbishop. Yet, in retirement he did not cease his service. In 1937, he applied to the holy synod of the Metropolia for blessing to establish a Pastoral School at the monastery in South Canaan. With the blessing of the synod, the approval of the Sixth All-American Sobor, and great effort on his part, Abp. Arseny opened on October 24, 1938, the first classes of the St Tikhon's Pastoral School, later to become St. Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary. He continued actively visiting the local parishes and traveling for special occasions. Then at the age of 79, illness overcame him and Abp. Arseny died on October 4, 1945, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. His funeral and interment at St. Tikhon's Monastery took place on October 9, 1945, attended by many hierarchs, priests, and faithful. Glorification inquiry During its October 2004 holy synod meeting, bishops of the OCA established a glorification commission to inquire into the possibility for adding Abp. Arseny to the calendar of saints.http://www.oca.org/news.asp?ID=680&SID;=19 Abp. Arseny already enjoys veneration in the OCA's Archdiocese of Canada.

It was first published in hardcover by Charles Scribner's Sons in February, 1904. It was Wright's second published novel and third published book. Plot The story takes place in the college town of Genoa in the Middle West. The heroine, Alice Lindell, secretary to Senator Winchester, is engaged to the senator's son Tom. She attempts to wean Tom away from his weakness for liquor by prematurely giving in to his desire for her, with disastrous results; Tom backslides, and while drunk falls victim to the wiles of another admirer, the unscrupulous Harriet, who marries him. Repenting his folly, he resolves to leave Harriet and run away with Alice, but is persuaded by the latter to fulfill his marriage vows and henceforth conduct himself honorably. Alice courageously faces the shame of bearing and rearing their illegitimate daughter Anna alone. This ordeal is the test of the title‚Äîof herself, her family, and her community. Her story is paralleled in a subplot involving Sallie, a sinner of a lower sort. Over the years Alice is supported by some, notably the senator, but vilified by most of the small- minded townsfolk, including her own mother. Her sister Gertrude, engaged to the priggish clergyman John Prescott, also suffers, her intended suddenly developing cold feet at the news of Alice's indiscretion. Perhaps the height of Alice's suffering is reached when Harriet, having lost her own child, importunes her to let her have Anna instead; persuaded it would be in the best interest of her daughter, Alice finally complies. In time her enduring patience effects her moral recovery in the eyes of the town, and her example succeeds in inspiring Tom to complete his own personal regeneration. In the conclusion Harriet's death frees them to marry each other, and the two depart Genoa to begin a new life together. Reception Reaction to the novel was mixed among reviewers. The New York Times \\"found some difficulty in getting at the [author's] purpose, ethical or artistic,\\" concluding that it was \\"as a study of the human conscience, its powers and its limitations,\\" that the novel was to be regarded. Finding the story unpleasant and its characters \\"generally unlikable,\\" it yet declared it \\"a book distinctly well written, if to write well, in making fiction, is to so write as to hold the attention of even an unwilling reader and compel him to note with something like admiration the skillful development of the traits of personages for whom he feels no liking whatever.\\" In spite of this dislike, the reviewer noted that Wright \\"knows her trade as novelist. As novelists go she is one among ten thousand. ‚Ä¶ [She] has a keen sense of humor, good descriptive powers, a good working knowledge of human nature, an effective style. She can tell a story well.\\"\\"A Study of Conscience.\\" - review in The New York Times, April 30, 1904, p. BR296. A harsher opinion was expressed in The Critic, which declared the book \\"one of the most unconvincing novels that the present reviewer has ever read ‚Ä¶ psychologically false from beginning to end in respect of the main situations.\\" It allowed \\"one good chapter, in which Alice imagines her marriage day and restrains her impulse to drown herself, knowing that she is to become a mother; but as a whole, the book is exasperating in the extreme, because it does not ring true.\\"\\"An Unconvincing Novel.\\" - review in The Critic, September 1904, p. 279. Other critiques were much more positive. The Springfield Republican felt it \\"takes a bold subject and treats it in a daring way, yet with such honest of purpose as to take away all offense,\\" finding \\"much of the skillful exposition of character that appeared in 'Aliens,' while [suggesting] in dramatic intensity . . . some of Mrs. Wright's striking short stories.\\"\\"Some of the Recent Novels\\" ‚Äì review in the Springfield Sunday Republican, April 10, 1904, p. 19.

The Lamp, after briefly praising the \\"place for herself among the novelists whose work demands serious consideration\\" the author had made with Aliens, declared that \\"'The Test' strengthens her position, fulfills much promise, [and] justifies more expectation. The author has made of the sin of a man and a woman a test for all the folk who figure in her book‚Äîa test of individual, of family, of community. The story is simple enough and it is told simply, clearly, forcibly, with a certain fine reserve and freedom from hysteria [painting] the life of a little town, the souls and deeds of its people with keen insight, wide human sympathy, relentless logic.\\" It also noted \\"a leaven of humor to lighten her soul study.

Serving her community not only as a priest's wife, but also as a midwife, Matushka Olga gave birth to and raised several children, many of whom she gave birth to without the aid of a midwife of her own. Matushka Olga was known for her empathy and caring for those who had suffered abuse of all kinds, especially sexual abuse. While her family was poor, she was generous to those who were poorer, often giving away her children's clothes to the needy. She was also known for her ability to tell when a woman was pregnant, even before the woman herself had missed her period. When Matushka Olga reposed, many people from miles around wanted to come to her funeral, but since it was November, the winter weather made it impossible. But a wind from the south brought warm weather, thawing the ice and snow to make the trek to Kwethluk possible. When the mourners exited the church to take her body to the graveyard, a flock of birds followed. The ones who dug her grave found that the ground, too, had thawed. The evening after her funeral, the normal harsh winter weather returned.

He developed Yoruba culture, especially folk opera (drama that combines Christian themes with traditional Yoruba folklore, music and dancing, and music popular in urban culture) into a serious theatre form through his work with his Ogunmola Travelling Theatre (founded c. 1948). They produced an early stage musical version of Amos Tutuola's The Palm Wine Drinkard, which was performed at the First Pan-African Cultural Congress (Algiers, 1969). Ogunmola is regarded as one of the most brilliant actors in Africa in the 1950s and ‚Äô60s. He produced Ife Owo in 1965. It was a satire on marriage and wealth. He used Mime and singing as well as drumming to convey his message. He also produced the dramatic version of Tutuola's The Palmwine Drinker. He also exhibited great ability in acting and directing. He married numerous wives and had many children. Among his children are notable Nollywood Stars, such as Abayomi Ogunmola and Peju Ogunmola Omobolanle. Life and career Elijah Kolawole Ogunmola was born to the family of George Ogunmola and Aina Ogunmola in the town of Okemesi-Ekiti on November 11, 1925. Before his start in professional theatre, Ogunmola was a schoolmaster in Ado- Ekiti.Beier, Ulli. \\"Yoruba Folk Operas.\\" African Music 1.1 (1954): 32-34. Web. At Emmanuel School, Ado-Ekiti, Ogunmola created school plays performed by students inside and sometimes outside the school. He formed his drama troupe, Ogunmola's Theatre Party around some of the pupils and his fellow teachers. The troupe was modeled after Ogunde's Theatre Party and some of his early operas like \\"Reign of the Mighty\\", one of his early plays reveal a Christian influence. Ogunmola's early performances were staged in the Ekiti region of Nigeria. He was known as a performer who was sensitive to the quality of the acting on stage. Like Ogunde, most of his early work were Yoruba folk operas. The rhythm is provided by drums played in the background, the songs are in Yoruba language and dancing was an integral part of the play. In the 1950s, Ogunmola's theatre traveled extensively throughout the Western region of Nigeria, performing in schools, churches and halls. Though the group performed the same set of plays in every city, the audience can get a unique feeling from seeing each play. Ogunmola's plays allowed for improvisational acting on stage and with each performance, he left room for the unexpected. His acting is also influenced by the feelings of the moment while his knowledge of Yoruba culture and human nature grew with each performance. One of his popular plays, \\"Love for Money\\", is a story about a wealthy man who fell for a temptress and as a result separated from his wife. However, his relationship with the temptress ruined him. In 1955, he moved to Oshogbo from the Ekiti region. In 1962, University of Ibadan established a drama school and Ogunmola was offered a grant to become a resident artist. The artist in residence program was sponsored by Rockefeller Foundation and it provided Ogunmola funds to buy equipment that soon allowed him to go fully professional. Ogunmola's most famous play, a loose adaptation of Amos Tutuola's the Palmwine Drinkard was a result of his collaboration with the School of Drama at Ibadan. When Ogunmola was at Ibadan, he was given a script written by Tutuola to translate into a Yoruba drama. The results was\\"Lanke Omuti\\" also known as Palmwine Drinkard.Armstrong, Robert G. \\"Amos Tutuola and Kola Ogunmola: A Comparison of Two Versions of The Palmwine Drinkard.\\" Callaloo 8/10 (1980): 165-74. We The premier of the play was at the university, Ogunmola was assisted by Demas Nwoko in the production and stage design of the play. In the 1960s, Palmwine Drinkard received recognition in Nigeria and abroad. He became more popular after his six months residency at Ibadan partly due to the success of Palmwine Drinkard. The play was a serious contender with ·ªåba k√≤ so, the eventual nominee for Nigeria's nomination to the Commonwealth arts festival in 1965. Ogunmola suffered a stroke in 1970 and his health continued to decline until he died in 1973 at the age of 48.

The company, named after Diana, the mythological goddess of the hunt, is best known for producing quality air rifles. History =Establishment= Mayer & Grammelspacher GmbH was founded in Rastatt in 1890 by 24-year old toolmaker Jakob Mayer and financier Josef Grammelspacher, initially focusing on household metal goods. Two years later they introduced their first air gun, a pistol, based on the Haviland & Gunn model of 1872. The first rifle, a break barrel design, followed in 1895. Early products were marked \\"MGR\\" (for Mayer, Grammelspacher and Rastatt) before the introduction of the now-famous \\"Diana\\" brand name. In 1901 Grammelspacher left the company for reasons unknown, whilst Mayer was awarded his first patent. =Initial success= A steady stream of improved designs characterized the first decade of the 20th century, culminating in the classic Model 27. This successful model was produced in various forms from 1910 up to 1987. The popularity of shooting as a leisure activity prompted development of a range of children's toy guns (firing arrows tipped with suction cups) under the Eureka brand. =WW2 and aftermath= The Second World War stymied Diana's early success, with sanctions imposed on the Nazi government severely limiting export opportunities. By 1940 civilian production was halted and the factory was commandeered to produce parts for Mauser, which led to heavy Allied bombing. After the fall of Germany in 1945, the production of arms was outlawed. The occupying forces decommissioned the factory and sold the company lock, stock and barrel to England's Millard Brothers (Milbro), who moved production to Scotland. The sale included all assets, even the trademark \\"Diana\\". =Not Diana= The company formerly known as Diana was allowed to restart production of air guns in 1950, during the reconstruction of Germany. Due to the loss of their trademark, their products were sold under various other names including \\"Original\\" in Germany, \\"Diana Original\\" in England, Beeman, Hy-Score and Winchester in the USA and \\"GECADO\\" in the Common Wealth countries. In 1963 they introduced an innovative recoilless air rifle, the Model 60. =Restoration= In 1984, after almost 40 years, the company finally regained their trademark when Milbro went bust. At the 1988 Summer Olympics a silver medal was won by Silvia Sperber in the Women's 10 metre air rifle event using a Diana rifle.

His most noted work was World History for Children and Teachers of Children () which was widely used and much edited and revised by other noted historians after Becker's death. Biography Becker was a native of Berlin. He studied history and philosophy at the University of Halle, and after finishing his studies, worked as a tutor in Cottbus. From 1798 to 1800 he was a schoolteacher in Berlin, but due to poor health had to resign from teaching and devote his time to literary and historical work. Becker died on 15 March 1806 at the age of 29. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof I der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor. Works Becker is remembered today as author of the nine-volume Weltgeschichte f√ºr Kinder und Kinderlehrer. This work was published in Berlin between 1801 and 1805, and after his death was continued, edited and revised by numerous authors.

Early life and background Gurdon was born in Balham, Surrey, the son of John Gurdon and Mary Gray Rattray, and attended Tonbridge School in Kent. From September 1916 he attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst,Shores et.al. (1990), p.179. as a \\"Gentlemen Cadet\\", and after passing out (graduating), he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Suffolk Regiment on 1 May 1917. First World War service Gurdon was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in May 1917, and was confirmed in his rank of the General List on 10 August 1917. He completed his pilot training at Central Flying School and was sent to No. 22 Squadron in 1918, flying Bristol F.2 Fighters. The Shuttleworth Collection's Bristol F.2B Fighter Gurdon achieved all twenty-eight of his victories between 2 April and 13 August 1918 while flying the Bristol Fighter aircraft, seventeen of them using the front gun. On 7 May he was involved in an historic engagement known as the \\"Two versus Twenty\\". Gurdon, together with his observer 2nd Lt. John Thornton, in partnership with one other Bristol Fighter aircraft, piloted by Alfred Atkey with his observer Charles George Gass engaged twenty enemy aircraft. Gurdon and Thornton shot down three enemy aircraft; Atkey and Gass shot down five. As a result of this action he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was gazetted on 2 August. His citation read: :Lt. John Everard Gurdon. ::This officer is a brilliant fighting pilot who on all occasions shows great determination with entire disregard of personal danger. He has personally destroyed nine enemy machines. On a recent date when on offensive patrol with another Bristol fighter he attacked a formation of seven enemy machines; one of these he shot down in flames. The enemy were then reinforced by two other formations, which brought their number up to twenty. Fighting continued for about half an hour when the Bristols broke off the engagement, their ammunition being exhausted. Only seven enemy machines remained, many having been seen to spin away, and one was shot down by this officer. On 10 July his aircraft was badly shot up, Gurdon being hit by a bullet in the left arm, and his gunner, Lt. J. J. Scaramaga, being killed. He was appointed a flight commander with the rank of temporary captain on 23 July, but in August he received a concussion from an anti- aircraft shell near-miss. He was returned to the UK in September and relinquished his commission owing to his injuries on 21 December, but was permitted to retain the rank of captain. His confirmed claims, in conjunction with his gunners, consisted of 13 and one shared aircraft destroyed, and 14 driven down 'out of control'. Interwar career After the war Gurdon pursued a career as a journalist and author, publishing his first novel Over and Above in 1919, republished in 2018. He then translated Georg Paul Neumann's Die Deutschen Luftstreitkr√§fte im Weltkriege, an official history, which was published in English as The German Air Force in the Great War in 1921. Another novel Feeding The Wind was published in 1924. However, in December 1925 he was declared bankrupt. and over the next fifteen years, to pay off his creditors, Gurdon wrote several novels, and numerous short stories, mainly adventure stories aimed at young adults, and published in such magazines as The Modern Boy and Air Stories. He finally gained his discharge from bankruptcy in late 1937, but continued to publish regularly up to the outbreak of the Second World War. Second World War service Despite being blinded in one eye after a car crash in 1935 and suffering a hip problem following an aircraft landing accident, Gurdon joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, and was granted a commission \\"for the duration of hostilities\\" as a pilot officer (on probation) on 20 September 1940. He served as an instructor and managed to fly on several bombing operations unofficially as a front gunner on Wellingtons, but after a landing accident aggravated his existing hip problem he was forced to relinquish his commission on 29 September 1941. Later life He published two more novels in the early 1950s. John Gurdon died on 14 April 1973 in Alassio, Italy. Personal life Gurdon married Florence M. Pleming in 1920 at Kensington, London. They had three sons, John (known as Robin), Philip, and David. The eldest, Sergeant John Robert Gurdon, was killed in action in April 1943 flying Wellingtons of No. 166 Squadron. Philip Gurdon was a member of No. 273 Squadron, flying Spitfires in Burma.

It is located on the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) approximately northwest of Medicine Hat, and just south of CFB Suffield.  History  Established by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1884, Suffield was named after Charles Harbord, 5th Baron Suffield who married in 1854, Cecilia Annetta, the sister of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke, who assisted in financing the railway.Geographic Board of Canada, Place-Names of Alberta, published for the Geographic Board by the Department of the Interior, 1928 Near the beginning of the 20th century, Suffield experienced rapid growth arising from the construction of the CPR. One of the larger building in the area at the time, the 32-room Alamo Hotel was constructed in 1910 by W.R. Martin, superintendent of CPR oil and gas exploration, A.M. Grace, chief engineer of the Southern Alberta Land Company, and A.P. Phillips at a cost of $30,000.D.C. Jones, Empire of Dust, University of Calgary Press, 2002 A reporter from the Medicine Hat News wrote on 20 Oct 1910, \\"The most beautiful hotel alongside the CPR from Winnipeg to Calgary, stands on the prairie within a stone's throw of one of the biggest gas wells in the Medicine Hat district in what promises to be, in the near future, the city of Suffield\\".J.

Hard times hit with the First World War and with the introduction of Prohibition in 1915. In 1926, the hotel was sold to the Calgary Brewing and Malting Company and moved to Sylvan Lake in 1927 to replace a hotel that burnt down. = Railway = In 1913, a branch line of the CPR was constructed between Suffield and Retlaw. In 1914, the Suffield-Retlaw was extended to Lomond, completing the 84-mile branch.J.Blue,\\"Alberta Past and Present: historical and biographical\\", 1924 The Suffield-Lomond line was extended to Arrowwood in 1925.

The stops on the line were Suffield, Agatha, Hlingworth, Ronolane, Cecil, Armelgra, Scope, Grantham, Vauxhall, Retlaw, Enchant, Travers, Lomond, Armada, Pageant, Milo, Qeenstown, Shouldice and Arrowwood. The coach fare in 1948 was $3.75.Waghorn's Guide, May 1948 The line has since been abandoned and the rails removed.

It was located on the bank of the Patuxent River in the city of Laurel, Prince George's County, Maryland. It was constructed in 1844-1845 for Captain William Mason & Son of Baltimore. It was complemented by the neighboring Laurel Mill built in 1811 S.D. Heath's machine shop and Richard Israel's flouring mill. At that time it was provided with the machinery for the manufacture of fine cloth, running as many as 1,500 cotton spindles with 150 employees. In 1845, industrialist Peter Gorman was responsible for the first macadamized (paved) road in Laurel, Avondale Street next to the new Mill. The mill was sold for $10,000 with a $13,000 ground rent in 1850 to S.P. Heath and James Arthur (Webb Heath & Co.). In the mid-1850s, it was converted to a gristmill. The waters of the Patuxent provided an 8‚Äì9 foot fall and gave the mill 60-70 horsepower to use, along with steam power fueled by coal from Cumberland as early as 1854. George William Brown purchased the 21.7 acre property and outbuildings from Benjamin F. Crabbs, but sold his holdings in a mortgage auction on 20 October 1897. By 1904, the mill employed only 4 people, but produced $10,400 in product annually. Commissioner of Labor and Statistics, Maryland. State Board of Labor and Statistics, Maryland. Bureau of Industrial Statistics Avondale Mill was the only one of Laurel's 19th century mills to have survived into the late 20th century. A devastating fire on December 19, 1991, destroyed the mill. The remains were then demolished and the site cleared for use as a community park. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

He was a member of the German parliament during the Weimar Republic. During World War II, P√ºckler-Burghauss was chief of the Waffen-SS units in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and also temporarily commanded the Latvian Division of the Waffen-SS.  Life  Born in Upper Silesia, P√ºckler-Burghauss was the son of Count Friedrich von P√ºckler-Burghaus, a retired major in the Prussian Army, and his wife, Countess Ella von K√∂ppen. At the time, his father was district governor in Friedland. Carl Friedrich attended the high school in Breslau and later studied law in Bonn. On 20 May 1913, he married Princess Olga-Elisabeth of the House of Wettin, daughter of Prince Albert of Saxe-Altenburg and Princess Marie of Prussia. They had two daughters and one son, who died shortly after his birth.  Career  P√ºckler-Burghauss entered the Cuirassier Regiment in Breslau in 1908. The following year, he was promoted to second lieutenant. He served in the infantry during World War I and won the Iron Cross 1st Class. He left the army in 1919 as a captain and served with reserve Freikorps units until 1931, when he joined the Nazi Party and the SA. From the election in March 1933 until November 1933, he was a member of the German Parliament, representing District 9 (Oppeln). After other political parties were banned in July 1933, new elections were held in November 1933, but P√ºckler-Burghauss was not nominated. He joined the SS in 1940 and, after finishing the police course, became adjutant to the SS and police leader Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski in the Army Group Centre Rear Area. In 1942, he was appointed chief of the Waffen-SS units in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. From 1943 to 1944, he also commanded the newly created Latvian Division, but was replaced before the division went into combat. During the Prague uprising in May 1945, P√ºckler-Burghauss represented the hardline of the SS. During negotiations with the Czech National Council (cs), he often threatened the complete destruction of Prague.  Death  Contravening the terms of Germany's capitulation taking effect 8 May, P√ºckler-Burghauss moved west in an attempt to surrender to the Americans. Their refusal resulted in the Battle of Slivice, in which the Germans were defeated. He signed a capitulation on 12 May, the last document of surrender of World War II in Europe. Shortly afterwards, he shot himself along with some of his staff.

Obtaining a Law Degree at the prestigious National University of La Plata, he joined the Socialist Party of Argentina, and later aligned himself with the dissident Independent Socialists. This party split from the Socialist Party to seek an alliance with conservatives sharing their distaste for the populist Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen for the 1928 elections (which Yrigoyen won).Una rosa de cobre Noble was a vocal advocate for the overthrow of President Yrigoyen, whose high- handed style of governing put him in a precarious situation following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The regime that deposed the aging Yrigoyen in a coup in September, 1930, gave way to elections the following year, for which the new regime organized the Concordance, a coalition of the National Autonomist Party (the conservative party in power during most of the 1880-1916 era) with centrist Radical Civic Union figures opposed to Yrigoyen and amenable Socialists. Having been part of the latter group since 1927, Noble joined the ticket and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies (lower house of congress). Representing the city of Buenos Aires until 1936, he introduced a number of progressive bills that became law, including needed anti-abuse reforms to rural Argentina's Justice of the Peace system and the landmark Law 11723, the basis for Argentina's Law of Intellectual and Artistic Property. These accomplishments brought him to the attention of the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Manuel Fresco, who appointed Noble second vice-president of the body. Elected governor of the Province of Buenos Aires in November, 1935, on the Corcordance ticket through fraud, as many Concordance lawmakers were during the \\"Infamous Decade,\\" Fresco initiated a number of needed housing and highway projects, among other public works. He appointed Noble minister of government, a prominent post which drew ire from Fresco's more conservative colleagues within the party. Noble's encouragement of the governor's relatively progressive social policy (particularly land reform) also convinced many in the Concordance that Fresco had clear presidential ambitions. Forcing Noble to resign his post and Fresco to step aside, the party rigged the 1940 elections in favor of a staunchly reactionary candidate, Alberto Barcel√≥.Walter, Richard. The Province of Buenos Aires and Argentine Politics, 1912-1943. Cambridge University Press, 2002. This disappointment led Noble to renounce direct political involvement in the future. He turned to the promotion of cultural activities and was appointed head of the National Commission for Culture, a body he helped create during his days in the lower house. Seeking an alternative to Buenos Aires's three principal newsdailies, La Naci√≥n, La Prensa and La Raz√≥n (all of a decidedly conservative bent), Noble sold and the bulk of his estate (including his prized pampas ranch) for US$1.6 million and, printing an initial distribution of 60,000 copies, he inaugurated Clar√≠n (the \\"Clarion\\") on Tuesday, August 28, 1945.Funding Universe: Clar√≠n =Clar√≠n= \\"A touch of Argentine attention to Argentine problems,\\" as he billed Clar√≠n, the daily's tabloid format stood out in newsstands from its broadsheet competitors and sold out on its first day in Buenos Aires newsstands. It also stood out for its innovative front page layout. Sporting large headlines, relatively brief introductory text below each, and copious illustrations, the front page served primarily as a table of contents inviting the reader to look inside for more. The iconic title, moreover, was placed to accommodate the layout and could be found anywhere on the top half of the paper's smaller, more manageable front page, giving the daily a whimsical touch. This design, a novelty in 1945, made Clar√≠n more \\"reader-friendly\\" than other local dailies and later influenced newspaper front pages around the world, including British tabloids and news dailies such as USA Today. Funeral procession for First Lady Eva Per√≥n on a 30 July 1952 Clar√≠n front page. The daily's well-illustrated layout and smaller \\"Berliner\\" format became influential to the medium. The attention-catching paper soon developed a loyal contingent of readers, however, because of its professed neutrality. Inaugurated two months before the birth of the Peronist movement, arguably the central political development in Argentina since 1945, Clar√≠n provoked few conflicts with the imposing new President Juan Per√≥n, whose opposition Democratic Union he had endorsed; whereas La Naci√≥n and La Prensa personally accused Per√≥n and, particularly, the first lady, Eva Per√≥n (whom La Prensa only referred to as \\"the wife of the president\\") of the day's problems, Clar√≠n focused on issues of social and economic development (particularly Argentina's budding industrialization, a concern it shared with the Per√≥n administration), offering articles rich in facts, figures and anecdotes with limited editorials. It also benefited from Per√≥n's hostility towards some competing magazines and dailies, particularly La Prensa, which Per√≥n expropriated in April, 1951 (on the eve of his reelection campaign). The tireless Noble met Ernestina Herrera while on one of his rare vacations, in 1950. He and the 25-year-old Flamenco dancer, who had little in common, soon developed a relationship. The confirmed bachelor, however, also enjoyed a relationship with Guadalupe Zapata, a Chilean divorc√©e, whom he married in 1958 (the couple had a girl, Guadalupe, in 1959). The matrimony was an unhappy one, however, leading to their separation a few years later.Not√≠cias Noble holds his daughter, Guadalupe, during a visit to President Arturo Frondizi. Earning renown as both a businessman and journalist, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Malta in 1951 and Columbia University's prestigious Maria Moors Cabot prize in 1955. Noble, a supporter of developmentalism, endorsed Arturo Frondizi who, during his 1958-62 presidency promulgated the Law of Foreign Investment and other incentives which, together, resulted in sharp increases in energy and industrial production (leading to the elimination of Argentina's stubborn trade deficits of the 1950s). Clar√≠n's support of these measures helped lead to its widespread preference by the Argentine middle class (Latin America's largest, proportionately)Statistical Abstract of Latin America. UCLA Press. and, by 1965, Clar√≠n enjoyed the largest circulation in Argentina, a trend reinforced by innovations such as weekly color supplements and thematic inserts (firsts in the Argentine newspaper industry).Universidad Nacional de La Matanza blog Noble resisted the drive towards unionization being felt across Argentina's vast publishing industry during the 1960s, a development primarily a result of publishing workers' union leader Raimundo Ongaro, whose Socialist ideology put him at odds with the paramount CGT labor federation. Interviewed at the time regarding his career, Noble described his own early Socialist affiliations as a \\"youthful indiscretion.\\" Attempts on the part of Clar√≠n employees to organize were likewise met with swift dismissals, a policy facilitated by Argentina's return to military dictatorship in 1966. Noble had, however, not supported the 1966 coup against the moderate Arturo Illia. Close to President Illia's War Secretary, General Ignacio √Åvalos, he supported √Åvalos' efforts to persuade Illia to remove the Head of the Armed Forces Joint Chiefs, Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, whom √Åvalos suspected of plotting a coup despite the wily Ongan√≠a's protestations of loyalty.Potash, Robert.

Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS), Morristown sailed from New York City on 27 October 1918 in convoy for Europe, arriving at La Pallice, France, on 15 November 1918 to debark her cargo of United States Army supplies and airplanes. She made two more runs to European ports with ammunition and general cargo before departing Dartmouth, England, for the United States East Coast on 25 May 1919. Arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, on 9 June 1919, Morristown decommissioned on 13 June 1919 and was delivered to the United States Shipping Board (USSB).

The assessment tools utilized in computer-supported collaborative learning settings are used to measure groups' knowledge learning processes, the quality of groups' products and individuals' collaborative learning skills. Perspective Traditional assessment is equated with individualized exams and evaluations. However, in online collaborative learning, assessment requires a broader perspective as it encompasses the collaborative interactions using asynchronous and synchronous communications between group members. Assessment has been found to have a significant effect on CSCL by motivating learners through accountability and constructive feedback. It supports students in growing familiar with the course content through discourse and effectively encourages the participation of students.Macdonald, (2003)  Four metaphors of CLCS  There are four metaphors of Assessment of (Computer-Supported) Collaborative Learning such as: a.acquisition metaphor b.the participation metaphor c. the knowledge creation metaphor d.a sociocultural-based group cognition metaphor. The usage of the acquisition metaphor during the learning process is directly connected to the accumulation of knowledge in the students\`mind. Learning is evaluated based on the individual gain. The participation metaphor emphasis that the learning process does not only happen in an individual or isolated environment but in an interactive socio-cultural environment where the students participate and collaborate with each-other. The knowledge creation metaphor focuses mostly on the collaborative activities. There are cases when the individual activities are stressed as well in terms of students as individuals who collaborate and interact actively during the learning process. A socio- cultural-based group cognition metaphor refers to the individuals\`participation during the learning process who share meaning, ideas and opinions to the other members of the group.Assessment of (Computer- Supported) Collaborative Learning Instructor's role in CSCL assessment A paradigm shift occurs in the assessment of the products and processes in CSCL. In the traditional educational setting, final assessment is performed exclusively by the instructor.McConnell (1999)(p. 232) In CSCL, the instructor designs, facilitates, direct instruction and provide technical guidance.Anderson, et al.2001 The participants take an active role in setting the standard criteria for assessing individual and group learning.  Intelligent Support For CSCL Assessment  The teacher\`s assessment should include its function(summative or formative), type(peer assessment, portfolio\`s, learning journals), format( rating scales,rubrics,feedback), focus(cognitive/social or motivational processes) and degree of student involvement(self,peer,co-.teacher assessment) are very essential. Technology use in CSCL assessment Various technologies may provide information that may be used for assessment purposes. For example, email, computer conferencing systems, bulletin boards, and hypermedia can be used as media for communication between group members in CSCL classrooms.Hoare, V (2007)(p. 13). This technology can be used to keep a record of the students' interactions. This interaction record enables the instructor and students in assessing a learner's participation and collaboration with the group.Suther, D. (2007)(p. 664). Process assessment vs. product assessment In CSCL settings, the relative value of the collaborative process and the product must be appropriately balanced. The pedagogical principle in CSCL environments is the assumption that knowledge is constructed through social negotiation and discussion with others. This social interaction encourages critical thinking and understanding.Pozzi, Manca, Persico and Sarti (2007)(p. 309) When learning occurs through social interaction, knowledge building can also be observed through text analysis or discourse analysis. One way to assess knowledge construction in online collaborative settings is by collecting and analyzing the discursive events recorded and kept as history in computer conferencing systems in the form of virtual artifact. Transcripts can be used to determine the quantity and quality of interactions in negotiating meaning of the course material.Macdonald (2003)(p. 379) The instructor evaluates the messages exchanged by the students for meaningfulness and pertinence in regards to the target content. Assessment of the process Instructors can use discourse analysis to assess the students' learning of the collaborative process itself. The instructor can make use of the dialogue to look for cues of collaboration: support and respect in their criticisms, consideration of other teammates' opinions, negotiation of meaning, demonstration of mutual understanding, achievement of consensus, problem-solving, and time and task management issues. Another consideration in assessing students' collaborative skills, is the students' competence in online collaboration. As proficiency develops in progressive stages, the instructor can design the assessment to account for the students' developing competence in progressive steps throughout the online collaborative process.(p. 378) Assessment of the product Collaborative products can be used to assess learners' knowledge acquisition. The products can be: a concept map, a report, a research paper, an essay, a wiki, a website, etc. Two assessable elements of collaborative product are the overall quality of the collaborative product and the contributions of each individual.Pozzi et al. (2007)(p. 386) Each member of the group must participate in the collaborative activities. The products created by groups of students in CSCL contexts cannot be used as the sole evidence of knowledge acquisition. Although a quality product may be important, it is the process that generates the actual learning.\\"(p. 170) Self and peer assessment Self assessment in CSCL, students taking responsibility of learning by evaluating and judging aspects of their own learning activity.Falchikov, (1986) In peer assessment, individuals take into account the quantity and quality of their own product or performance.Lee, (2006) In CSCL, these two types of assessments are dynamically interrelated. The aim of self and peer assessments in CSCL is to improve students' learning, and develop individual learning skills as well as grading individual learning outcomes. Self and peer assessment: # drives students' learning; # aids students in recognizing individual potential and sharing collaborative work effectively and efficiently; # enables instructors to perceive the effect of individual learning through discourse; # informs the instructor of the students' opinion change and skill improvement that occurs through adversity in the online collaborative process; # develops students as retrospective thinkers.Knight, (1995) Group work assessment Group work assessment in CSCL measures the quantity and quality of students' learning as a team. Group work or teamwork is a collaborative learning situation in which students share the task of developing a product presented at the end of the course.De Hoyos(2004) Group work is not measured and interpreted independently but evaluated with other assessment tools, and plays a role in assisting learners' to reflect on their learning process. Group work assessment: # diagnoses the collaborative learning process and shows the instructor what works and what does not; # identifies and corrects destructive conflict in collaborative learning; # facilitates learners' reflection making the collaborative task effective and efficient; # allows the instructor to monitor the collaborative learning processes and gather the information about individual performance and contributions to product quality. E-portfolio assessment E-portfolio can be used in assessment of CSCL activities by showing students' growth or proficiency in learning. Organizing information about individual students, the instructor keeps track of the student's learning process. These portfolios are managed online and are referred to as electronic portfolio, digital portfolio, or web-portfolio. In using E-portfolios in CSCL assessment an instructor determines: # purpose; # type; # choice of items to include; # guidelines or criteria; # impact on the teacher and students; # self-reflection component.Butler & McMunn, (2006) Collaborative Learning Collaborative Learning (CL) is a useful practice which is common at all levels of education. The latest developments in the field of Technology lead to a new discipline which is known as ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning (CSCL).The usage of computers during the Collaborative Learning (CL) established a shift in the methodology that the teachers used to have during their learning processes as well as an understanding of how group work affects individual and group cognition. Assessment in Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments is shaped by: a.what is measured b.its purpose. The entire process distinguishes two important purposes: 1.formative 2.summative. Summative assessment(assessment of learning) is described as individualistic and decontextualized which is realized in an isolated way from the learning process. It is used at the end of the course and its main purpose is to check the students\`progression throughout the entire learning process. In other words how well the students performed. Summative assessment focuses mostly on the cognitive approaches which are used to educate the students. It is designed by the teacher who uses only a single performance score. On the other hand,Formative assessment (assessment for learning) is contextualized and represents a picture of the learners\` features. It is the most essential part of the learning process which is used by the teacher several times to evaluate the students\` knowledge. Formative assessment is not used only at the end of the course. It comprises motivational, social and cognitive aspects of the learning process. Also, this type of assessment doesn\`t use only a single score but creates a profile for each student.Assessment of (Computer- Supported) Collaborative Learning Notes References *Anderson, T., Rourke, L., Garrison, D.

Geography  The reserve is in size, and lies in the catchment of the River Kelvin at 50m above sea level, adjacent to High Possil and Lambhill on the north side of Glasgow. Occupying a natural basin of fluvio-glacial origin between the River Clyde and the Kelvin, the site is roughly triangular in shape. Its northern border is bounded by Lochfauld Farm, whilst the south and eastern borders are protected from direct contact with industrial and residential areas by the Forth and Clyde Canal, as is the western border by the A879 and Lambhill Cemetery.  Status  Possil Marsh has been under the custodianship of the Scottish Wildlife Trust since 1982, when it was acquired as a gift. Prior to this it had been managed by the Scottish Society for the Protection of Wild Birds, on behalf of the Scottish Wild Birds Sanctuaries Trust, since 1950. This management, and subsequent protection, has resulted in little alteration within the site in the past 50 years. Due to its importance, the marsh was first notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1954. Subsequently, it was then designated a bird sanctuary under Wild Bird Statutory Instrument 1956 No 333 (S10). Following the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the bird sanctuary was redesignated under Wild Birds (Possil Marsh Sanctuary Glasgow) Amendment Order 1983. At present the reserve has multiple occupation ‚Äì 4 owners, 2 occupiers, 1 owner/occupier. It also has British Trust for Ornithology status and district importance for wintering wildfowl, and its diversity of wintering birds, supporting up to 150 bird species, with 22 species recorded breeding. In addition to this it also contains a diverse number of invertebrate fauna, including 2 nationally scarce species and a number of locally scarce species, as well as many important plant species. Important habitats The reserve consists of a shallow mesotrophic loch, covering roughly 15% of the total site, with extensive fen () and swamp () 45-50%, damp grassland 15%, dry meadow 10%, and birch and willow scrubland 15%. Within the site there are a number of vegetation communities including Typha latifolia beds, Potentilla palustris meadows and Carex rostrata swamps. These fen/swamp habitat communities are the largest remaining areas of their type within the district,and also include limited areas of Carex diandra fen (locally rare). Other notable areas of interest include the dry grassland/heath habitat and the central birch island which contains an important number of sphagnum species. =Notable flora= Plants that are of local and/or national importance include: Lysimachia thyrsiflora (nationally scarce), Sphagnum riparium (nationally scarce), Sphagnum magellanicum (locally rare), C.diandra (locally rare), and Lemna triscula (rare in Scotland). Many of the species which are firmly established within the reserve have either been deliberately introduced, such as Berula erecta, Chamerion angustifolium, and Ranunculus bulbosus, or have been accidentally introduced, such as L. thyrsiflora, Mimulus luteus, Urtricularia minor, and Elodea canadensis, from the adjacent canal. Other species, such as Ranunculus scleratus, entered the marsh due to material being brought in to level up the ground for a cottage that once stood within the reserve. =Species lost= Past land use, natural succession and human activities have played a role in changing the reserve's vegetation. This has resulted in the loss of species such as Agrostemma githago, Apium inundatum, Armoracia rusticana, Asplenium adainatum-nigrum, Astrantia major, Baldellia ranunculoides, Barbarea verna, Campanula rotundifolia, Ceratophylum demersum, Ceterach Officinarum, Drosera rotundifolia, Gnaphalium sylvaticum, Humulus lupulus, Hypericum humifusum, Lemna gibba, Mimulus luteus, Narthecium ossifragum, Oenanthe crocata, Ophioglossum vulgatum, Parnassia palustris, Pyrola minor, Radiola linoides, Ranunculus ficaria, R. hederaceus, Rorippa amphibia, Sagina nodosa, Sagittaria sagittifolia, Salix repans, Utricularia intermedia, and U. vulgaris, all of which are now believed to be absent.

In 1917, McDonogh #35 was established as the first public high school for Black children in Louisiana.\\" History McDonogh School 13 circa 1900; in 1917 this building would be repurposed as the first home of McDonogh 35. Prior to 1917, during the era of segregated school systems in the Southern U.S., no public high school existed in New Orleans for African-American pupils. Those interested in pursuing an education beyond the eighth grade had to attend one of the city's three private secondary schools for blacks: Leland College, New Orleans University, or Straight College. In 1917, a group of citizens met to petition the Orleans Parish School System to convert McDonogh 13 Boys' School from a white elementary school to a secondary educational facility for black pupils. The petition was granted and in the fall of 1917, McDonogh 35 Senior High School became recognized as a four-year high school. McDonogh 35 remained the only public four-year high school for African Americans until the L. B. Landry transitioned from an elementary into a high school in 1942. Booker T. Washington also opened its doors in 1942 for African Americans. Over the years, McDonogh 35 has changed its location four times. The original building at 655 South Rampart Street was destroyed when Hurricane Betsy struck New Orleans in 1965, and for the next four years the school was temporarily located in the former United States Federal Court House Building at 600 Camp Street. In 1969, students and faculty were moved into the school facility at 133 St. Ann Street that formerly housed McDonogh 41 Elementary School. In September 1972, the facility relocated to 1331 Kerlerec Street in the Trem√© neighborhood. During the 1992-1993 school year, McDonogh 35 was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the United States Department of Education. By April 13, 2006, McDonogh 35 was one of six public high schools that had re-opened since Katrina. Of them, it was the only one in a Downtown neighborhood. According to Philip White, the principal, initially the administration had plans to accommodate 800 students but found fewer due to the effects of the hurricane. One month later, the enrollment went over 1,000 students and the administration was forced to stop accepting students.Troeh, Eve. \\"Many Children Still Lack Schools in New Orleans.\\" National Public Radio. Retrieved on March 16, 2013. The current facility which opened on August 20, 2015 is located on 16 acres in the Bayou District at 4000 Cadillac Street, the former Phillips/Waters school site. The Louisiana Recovery School District allocated $55 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency recovery funds tied to this site to construct the new state of the art McDonogh 35 College Preparatory High School. On December 20, 2018, the Orleans Parish School Board awarded the InspireNOLA charter group a two-year management contract to operate McDonogh 35 College Preparatory High School, which will only have eleventh and twelfth grades. Once the students graduate, that school will close. The school board also announced that InspireNOLA was awarded a contract to create a charter high school on the same campus. In 2019, McDonogh 35 College Preparatory Charter High School will start with ninth grade and add a grade each year until it reaches twelfth grade.

In the US some 80 percent of the fresh water withdrawn from rivers and groundwater is used to produce food and other agricultural products. Farm water may include water used in the irrigation of crops or the watering of livestock. Water is one of the most fundamental parts of the global economy. It has been shown that in areas without healthy water resources or sanitation services, economic growth cannot be sustained. Without access to clean water, nearly every industry would suffer, most notably, would be agriculture. As water scarcity grows as a global concern, food security is also brought into consideration. A recent example of this could be the drought in California‚Äîit is projected that for every $100 spent on foods from this state, a consumer should expect to pay up to $15 additionally. Livestock water use Livestock and meat production have one of the largest water footprints of the agricultural industry. Taking nearly 1,800 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef and 576 gallons for pork. For reference, it only takes about 108 gallons of water to harvest one pound of corn. Livestock production is also one of the most resource intensive agricultural outputs. This is largely due to their large feed conversion ratio. Livestock's large water consumption may also be attributed to the amount of time it takes to raise an animal to slaughter. Again, in contrast to corn, which grows to maturity in about 100 days. This adds an extra 995 days of water to grow cattle. The global \\"food animal\\" population is just over 20 billion creatures, with 7+ billion humans, this equates to about 2.85 animals per human. =Cattle= The beef and dairy industries are the most lucrative branches of the U.S. agricultural industry, however, they are also the most resource intensive. To date, beef is the most popular of the meats; the U.S. alone produced 25.8 billion pounds in 2013. In this same year, 201.2 billion pounds of milk were produced. These cattle are mostly raised in centralized animal feeding operations, or CAFOs. On average, a mature cow will consume anywhere from seven to twenty-four gallons of water a day; cows that are lactating require about twice as much water. The amount of water that cattle may drink in a day also depends upon the temperature. Cattle have a feed conversion ratio of 6:1, for every six pounds of food consumed, the animal should gain one pound. Thus, there is also a substantial \\"indirect\\" need for water in order to grow the feed for the livestock. Growing the amount of feed grains necessary for raising livestock accounts for 56 percent of the U.S water consumption. Of a 1,000 pound cow, only 430 pounds make it to the retail markets. This 18 percent loss, creates an even greater demand for cattle, being that CAFOs must make up for this lost profitable weight, by increasing the number of cows that they raise. Water scarcity is not necessarily a new issue, however, cattle ranchers in America have been cutting herd sizes since the 1950s in efforts to curb water and manufacturing costs. This shift has led to more efficient feeding and health methods, allowing ranchers to harvest more beef per animal. The rising popularity of these CAFOs are creating a larger demand for water, however. Grass-fed or grazing cows consume about twelve percent more water through the ingestion of live plants, than those cows who are fed dried grains. Chickens in industrial coops = Poultry and fowl = Water is one of the most crucial aspects of poultry raising, as they use this to carry food through their system, and assist in digestion. Additionally, farmers monitor flock water consumption to measure the overall health of their birds. As birds grow older they should be consuming more feed and about three times as much water. In just three weeks a 1000 bird flock's water consumption should increase by about 10 gallons a day. Water consumption is also influenced by temperature. When it is hot outside bird will pant to keep cool, thus losing much of their water. A study based in Ohio showed that 67 percent of water sampled near poultry farms contained antibiotics.Campagnolo, E.R., Kammy, R., Johnson, A.K., Rubin C.S., Kolpin, D.W., Meyer, M.T., Esteban, E.J., Currier, R.W., Smith, K., Thu, K.M., & McGeehin, M. (2002). Antimicrobial residues in animal waste and water resources proximal to large-scale swine and poultry feeding operations. The Science of the Total Environment.  Horticulture water use  A newly planted tomato plant on a tomato farm in North Queensland, Australia With modern advancements, crops are being cultivated year round in countries all around the world. As water usage becomes a more pervasive global issue, irrigation practices for crops are being refined and becoming more sustainable. While there are a variety of irrigation systems, these may be grouped into two types: high flow and low flow. These systems must be managed precisely to prevent runoff, over spray, or low-head drainage. Scarcity of water in agriculture years ago, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At that time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. Affluence was not as high, individuals consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for water resources is much more intense. This is because there are now nearly eight billion people on the planet, their consumption of meat and vegetables is rising. Competition for water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel crops is rising congruently. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to make strides to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.Chartres, C. and Varma, S. Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World‚Äôs Water Problems FT Press (USA), 2010 Successful agriculture is dependent upon farmers having sufficient access to water. However, water scarcity is already a critical constraint to farming in many parts of the world. Physical water scarcity is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed. This can happen where there is over development of hydraulic infrastructure, usually for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Economic scarcity, meanwhile, is caused by a lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. Symptoms of economic water scarcity include a lack of infrastructure, with people often having to fetch water from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Some 2.8 billion people currently live in water-scarce areas.Molden, D. (Ed). Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture. Earthscan/IWMI, 2007. File:Agricultural water as a share of total water withdrawals, OWID.svgAgricultural water as a share of total water withdrawals File:Agricultural water withdrawals, OWID.svgAgricultural water withdrawals in 2010  Sustainable water use  A rooftop rainwater harvesting system in Trinidad, 2003 While it is evident that water use affects environmental degradation and economic growth, it is also sparking innovation regarding new irrigation methods. In 2006, the USDA predicted that if the agricultural sector improved water efficiency by just 10 percent farms could annually save upwards of $200 million per year.USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. (2006). Energy Management. Conservation Resource Brief. Many of the practices which cut water use are cost effective. Farmers who use straw, compost, or mulch around their crops will reduce evaporation by about 75 percent. This would also reduce the number of weeds and save a farmer from using herbicides. Mulches or ground covers also allow the soils to absorb more water by reducing compaction. The use of white or pale gravel is also practiced, as it reduces evaporation and keeps soil temperatures low by reflecting sunlight. In addition to reducing water loss at the sink, there are also more sustainable ways to harvest water. Many modern small (non industrial) farmers are using rain barrels to collect the water needed for their crops and livestock. On average, rainwater harvesting reduces the cost of water per cubic meter in half. This would also greatly reduce the stress on local aquifers and wells. Because farmers use the roofs of their buildings to gather this water, this also reduced rainwater runoff and soil erosion on and around their farm.

He remains especially famous as author of the book Hitler‚Äôs Youth. Life and work After graduating from school, Jetzinger studied at the theological faculty of the university of Salzburg. He became a Jesuit priest and professor at the philosophic- theological academy in Linz. In this capacity he visited, amongst other places, Palestine in 1908. During the First World War, Jetzinger served as a military chaplain. In 1918 he began an intensive political career: first in the German People‚Äôs Party (electoral district Ried) and from 1919 on in the Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei (Socialdemocratic Worker-party). On 14 February 1921 the Catholic Church excommunicated him. From 1919 until 1934, Jetzinger served as social democratic assemblyman in the federal state Diet (electoral district Innviertel). From 1920 until 1930 he was editor at Tagesblatt. After he had worked as deputy for two years, Jetzinger became District Administrator in 1932 and therefore member of the Upper Austrian federal state government in Linz. After the ban to take mandates on 12 February 1934, Jetzinger, being a social democrat, was arrested by Dollfu√ü for five weeks. Afterwards he worked as insurance appointee for the Viennese local government. In 1935 he re-entered the Catholic Church and worked as librarian in the student‚Äôs library in Linz. Having been a member of the federal state government, Jetzinger had secured for himself the Austrian military file of Adolf Hitler, which included details on Hitler‚Äôs arrest in 1914, which took place because he fled from military conscription. After Hitler had annexed Austria in 1938, he repeatedly tried to have the Gestapo locate and secure the compromising file, but Jetzinger successfully hid it in his attic until 1945, despite his arrest by the Gestapo on 22 April 1944. In 1956, Jetzinger, who hated Hitler and the National Socialist regime, wrote the book Hitler's Jugend (Hitler‚Äôs Youth), in which he also published the contents of Hitler‚Äôs military file. Hitler‚Äôs Youth Jetzinger gained fame in 1958 through the English version of his book Hitler‚Äôs Youth, in which he could refute many of Hitler‚Äôs statements about his early years. Moreover, Jetzinger attracted attention by attacking an earlier published book The Young Hitler I Knew by August Kubizek, whom Jetzinger accused of spreading falsehoods. While earlier Hitler biographers like Joachim Fest or Werner Maser adopted Jetzinger‚Äôs criticism as their own, Jetzinger‚Äôs crushing judgment of Kubizek‚Äôs credibility has been challenged by Brigitte Hamann, author of Hitlers Wien. 'Jetzinger's scholarship is, in fact, not invariably superior to Kubizek's vivid pen- picture of the young Hitler, and contains some weaknesses of its own, both factual and interpretative.' (August Kubizek, The Young Hitler I Knew: The Memoirs of Hitler‚Äôs Childhood Friend (Yorkshire, UK, 2011, ¬© 1953, Translation Lionel Leventhal Ltd., 2006, Introduction ¬© Ian Kershaw, 2006), 13) Jetzinger's work remains relevant: In 2007, the BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio play titled Dr Freud Will See You Now, Mr Hitler, a largely counter-factual work written by a pair of established Jewish screenwriters who credit Hitler's Youth for the factual basis which launched their enterprise a decade earlier.

The WSC is home to a large collection of Native American artifacts and Ice Age fossils that were unearthed at Diamond Valley Lake, including \\"Max\\", the largest mastodon found in the western United States, and \\"Xena\\", a Columbian mammoth. Opened in 2006, the museum has been designed to provide world-class facilities for the research, curation, and presentation of the nearly one million specimens discovered during the development of Diamond Valley Lake in Hemet. The Campus The building was designed to be among the most eco-friendly museums in the United States. Its special environmental features include solar panels on the roof, cold-water pipelines run below the floor to reduce air conditioning, landscaping with low-irrigation native foliage, and extensive water reclamation. In 2008, it was awarded LEED Platinum Status by the US Green Building Council, their highest rating, and was the first museum in the United States to receive the recognition. The museum's public displays are housed in the permanent gallery, with another gallery housing temporary and traveling exhibits. The collections are held in the repository, not open to the public, which features , fully motorized compactor shelving units. The Collections Repository holds many paleontological and archaeological collections of Riverside County projects. Exhibits Harlan's ground sloth at WSC The museum features a long exterior walkway that holds a life-on-Earth time line. The welcome lobby features high walls with re-created paleontological strata and reproduction fossils projecting from the walls. The tour of the permanent gallery begins with interactive exhibits on the natural history of Domenigoni and Diamond Valleys, continuing through displays on European and Native American culture and history from the area. Among the artifacts on display are pieces donated by the Domenigoni family, the original settlers of the valley, and the Soboba band of Luise√±o Indians that inhabited the area before them. Visitors can view two movies on the construction of Diamond Valley Lake, and the fauna of the Pleistocene in the Diamond and Domenigoni Valleys, shown in a 270 degree immersive theater that shakes with the movies. From there, visitors proceed to the paleontology gallery, replete with fossils recovered and studied by scientists from the San Bernardino County Museum. The highlights of this gallery are the skeletons of \\"Max\\", the largest mastodon ever discovered in the western United States, and \\"Xena\\", a Columbian mammoth. Also featured in the gallery is \\"Li'l Stevie\\", one of the most complete mastodons known from the western United States, who is displayed unreconstructed and still partially buried as found when it was first uncovered. The gallery also features the skeletons of a Harlan's ground sloth, and interactive displays on the disciplines of archaeology and paleontology. Visitors can also visit temporary traveling exhibits in the temporary exhibit area. The museum also features a full-scale simulated archaeology and paleontology dig site, which opened for its first student excavations in the spring of 2009. It is currently being used by WSC staff, in association with local K-12 schools and colleges, to teach proper excavation methodology to students. It is also open for museum visitors to view an active dig site in process. Affiliations In November 2008 the Smithsonian Institution granted Affiliate status to WSC.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History East Sutton Park Prison is based in and around an Elizabethan brick house, East Sutton Park, dating from 1570Brickwork in Kent - Here's History - Kent website and overlooking the Weald of Kent. The building was requisitioned at the start of World War II, first opened as a borstal in 1946, then was re- registered to take juvenile and adult females some years later. In 2001 East Sutton Park was praised by the Director General of the Prison Service for its caring regime and humane standards of treatment for prisoners. However, in a report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons in 2003, East Sutton Park was criticised for not focusing enough on resettlement of prisoners and also for having a \\"disrespectful culture\\", including failing to issue proper toiletries and only offering plain glass shower cubicles which did not afford privacy to the inmates. According to the report, inmates were also subject to such unnecessary rules as \\"not being able to walk across the main hall, having to use plastic cutlery and fixed bed times.\\" The management of East Sutton Park Prison amalgamated with that of Blantyre House Prison in 2007. The prison today Accommodation at the prison is divided into 21 dormitories of varying sizes. Work at the prison for inmates includes farming, gardening, and catering. East Sutton Park also offers training courses and physical education. The prison plans to place 50 prisoners for employment in the community and has currently placed 25.

Chuck Suber (n√© Charles Harry Suber; 1921‚Äì2015), former editor of Down Beat, averred that the GI Bill following World War II was a key impetus for the jazz education movement in higher education. During the WWII, the U.S. Armed Forces had been the nation's largest employer of musicians ‚Äì including women musicians.

The Nubian Giraffe, by Jacques-Laurent Agasse (c.1827), depicts one of the three giraffes sent to Europe by Mehmet Ali Pasha, and its attendants. The gentleman in the top hat is Edward Cross. Edward Cross (baptised 3 February 1774 ‚Äì 26 September 1854) was an English zoo proprietor and dealer in animals. Cross was born in London and baptised at St Andrew's, Holborn, presumably within days of his birth. Apart from the names of his parents, Walter Cross and Jane (n√©e Callow), his early life remains obscure. Cross worked for Stephen Polito, the owner of the menagerie at Exeter Exchange in the Strand. Cross's daughter married Polito's brother, and Cross bought the menagerie after Polito's death in 1814. The menagerie had been operated at that site from 1773 in competition with the Royal Menagerie at the Tower of London with lions, tigers, monkeys, and other exotic species, all confined in iron cages in small rooms. The menagerie was primarily a visitor attraction open to the general public. It was visited by Wordsworth and Byron - who records watching the \\"tigers sup\\", being amused by a hyena's affection for its keeper, and the tricks played by an elephant with its trunk.The Works of Lord Byron: Letters and Journals, George Gordon Byron, Adamant Media Corporation, 2002, , page 319. Animals in the collection were painted by Edwin Landseer and Jacques-Laurent Agasse. It was also visited by scientists such as Joshua Brookes and J. E. Gray. Gray named the Rhinoceros crossii in his honour (now as a synonym for the Sumatran Rhinoceros, Dicerorhinus sumatrensis).Sumatran Rhino Scientific names, The Rhino Resource Center. Engraving of Exeter Exchange from 1829, viewed from the east, looking west down the Strand. Cross renamed the collection the Royal Grand National Menagerie, and employed a doorkeeper who was dressed as a Yeoman of the Guard. The living conditions for the animals were so poor that negative comments were made even in the early 19th century. The situation became untenable after his bad-tempered elephant, Chunee, was put down by a firing squad of soldiers from Somerset House in March 1826. Cross attempted to sell the collection to the new Zoological Society of London in 1826 and 1828, but the offer was refused on both occasions. The Exeter Exchange was demolished in 1829, as part of general improvements to the Strand, and Cross moved the menagerie to the King's Mews near Trafalgar Square (now the site of the National Gallery). Some of the animals were sold to the new London Zoo in Regent's Park. In 1831, he sold the remaining animals to the Surrey Literary, Scientific and Zoological Institution - an institution that he had founded - for ¬£3,500. Cross became superintendent of the new Surrey Zoological Gardens, and the animals were moved to Royal Surrey Gardens, in the grounds of Walworth Manor House in Kennington. Many of the exotic animals were housed in a large circular domed glass conservatory, in circumference with more than of glass. The collection expanded in the following years to include lions, tigers, an Indian rhinoceros, an orang-utan, and several giraffes. Cross retired in 1844, and he died in Kennington in 1854. His wife, Mary, predeceased him. The zoo became run down after Cross retired, and the animals were sold off in 1856, to be replaced by Surrey Music Hall. References * J. C.

Early life  Aerial view for Nile River where the Egyptian Museum and the British barracks appear to the lower right side. Spelterini was born in Bazenheid in the Toggenburg area in Switzerland as Eduard Schweizer.Degen, p. 39. His father, Sigmund Schweizer, was an innkeeper.Capus, p. 38. When he was eight years old, the family reportedly moved to northern Italy, to a place near the Swiss-Italian border in the province of Como. Eduard is said to have attended the schools in Lugano.Degen, p. 41. At the age of eighteen, Eduard allegedly went first to Milan and then to Paris to be trained as an opera singer. During this time, he chose the name \\"Spelterini\\", because to him it sound fancier than \\"Schweizer\\". His singing career was cut short by a severe case of pneumonia.Capus, p. 38, wrote in 2007 that he could not verify this sequence of events, but he couldn't disprove it either. He mentions an alternate version, based on the oral account of another balloon pilot who had known Spelterini personally, in which Spelterini left his home at Bazenheid when he was eighteen for Hamburg. However, Heim reports the version where Spelterini studied music in Milan and Paris in his introduction to Spelterini's illustrated book of 1928, and Spelterini is also reported (even by Capus himself) as frequently having sung arias upon launches of his balloon. In any case, Spelterini turned up in the mid-1870s in Paris, and in 1877 he was licensed by the Acad√©mie d'A√©rostation m√©t√©orologique de France as a ballon pilot.Degen, p. 42.  Ascents around the world  Announcement of Spelterini's ascents with Leona Dare In the 1880s, after having successfully made 17 ascents by himself, Spelterini began to offer commercial rides with passengers. In 1887, he had his first own balloon made by the Surcouf company in Paris, a gas balloon with a volume of 1,500 cubic meters, which he named \\"Urania\\". The first voyage with this ballon was on October 5, 1887, starting in Vienna. Subsequently, Spelterini moved to the United Kingdom, where he performed together with an American aerial acrobat going by the name of Leona Dare who would perform acrobatic acts suspended under the basket of Spelterini's balloon during the flights. The spectacle, but also Spelterini's often taking journalists for a ride for free ensured them favourable publicity. Together, they toured eastwards through Europe until Moscow, where they parted.Capus, p. 44. Spelterini turned southwards, making ascents in Bucharest, Saloniki, and Athens, before moving to Cairo. After his ascents in spring 1890 over the pyramids of Giza he continued touring, first to Naples, then to Istanbul. Limmatquai and Quaianlagen in Z√ºrich: Bellevueplatz and B√ºrkliplatz, Quaibr√ºcke, M√ºnsterbr√ºcke and M√ºnsterhof, and Rathausbr√ºcke‚ÄìWeinplatz, probably mid-1890s. In 1891, Spelterini returned to Switzerland. By that time, he was famous for his ballooning adventures. On July 26, 1891, Spelterini made his first ascent in Switzerland, starting at the Heimplatz in Zurich.Degen, p. 44. The initial skepticism of the people vanished quickly, and his starts soon attracted crowds wherever he turned up: Zurich, Winterthur, St. Gall, Interlaken, Vevey, ... His endeavours also caught the attention of scientists. On various occasions, Spelterini made ascents with scientists solely for the purpose of conducting experiments: with physicists to study the atmosphere, with physicians to study human blood cells at low atmospheric pressure, with geologists to study the earth from above.Degen, p. 46. A view of Les Diablerets from the balloon \\"Wega\\" on October 3, 1898, at 11:40 local time. Geologist Albert Heim had once proposed to Spelterini to try crossing the Alps by balloon. But he needed a larger balloon for such an endeavour. With the help of sponsors, he was able to buy the \\"Wega\\", twice as large as \\"Urania\\" with a volume of 3,260 cubic meters. With it, Heim and Spelterini planned to travel from Sion in the Valais across Uri into the Grisons. But the winds decided otherwise. Despite unfavourable wind conditions, they started on October 3, 1898. The winds drove the balloon across Les Diablerets and then further westwards, across Lake Neuchatel and the Jura Mountains, until they descended near Besan√ßon in France. Much of the trip was made at altitudes between 5000 and 6000 meters above sea level.Heim In the following years, Spelterini crossed the Alps numerous times with his balloons, in all directions. In 1904, he spent several months in Egypt, and in 1911, he even travelled to South Africa, yet he returned each time to Switzerland.  Aerial photography  Around 1893, Spelterini had begun to take a camera aboard his balloon and started to take pictures on his flights. It was certainly not easy to photograph with this equipment, weighing between 40 and 60 kilograms, and with a minimum exposure time of 1/30th of a second. But Spelterini brought back stunning photographs of the landscape seen from above that won awards repeatedly at aeronautical expositions in Milan, Paris, Brussels, or Frankfurt. For Albert Heim his photos provided whole new insights about the relief of the Alps. Spelterini presented his photos in slide shows wherever he went, from Stockholm to Cape Town, fascinating his audiences and winning the general acclaim of the press, who reviewed his presentations favorably.Capus, p. 47.Degen, p. 47f.

Image:Spelterini Desert.jpgDesert south-east of Cairo, January 31, 1904.  Decline of ballooning  The Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, photographed from Spelterini's balloon on June 22, 1922. The outbreak of World War I put an end to Spelterini's travels. Borders were closed, and Spelterini's balloons remained grounded. He retired as an independent gentleman to Coppet near Geneva with his wife Emma (n√©e Karpf), whom he had married on January 28, 1914 in the church of St Martin-in-the- Fields in London.Capus, p.49. But although he was well off financially, his savings diminished in the war years, and what was left of it was eaten up by the post-war inflation. The airplane had surpassed ballooning, nobody cared anymore about his pre-war exploits, and Spelterini was all but forgotten. In 1922, he hired out as a showman at the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, posing for photos and taking people for short rides in a captive balloon. He detested it.Degen, p.55f. Disappointed, he retired to Zipf near V√∂cklabruck in Austria, where he had bought a small house and lived from the sale of the eggs of his 300 chickens. In 1926, he tried a last time to revive his old ballooning adventures. With the financial help of some friends, he started from Zurich in a rented balloon. But he fell unconscious during the voyage; his passengers just barely managed to crash-land the balloon in Vorarlberg. Spelterini returned to Zipf, where he died impoverished and largely unknown in 1931.  References   Further reading  *Capus, A.: \\"Geschenke des Himmels\\", p. 36-50 in Das Magazin 38/2007.

From left to right, the metal disks are the insulated charge receiver A, the insulated charge transferrer B, the insulated charge accumulator C, and the earthed disk D. An earthing pin E makes contact with a wire F connected to B. Cavallo's multiplier was an early electrostatic influence machine, invented in 1795 by the Anglo-Italian natural philosopher Tiberius Cavallo. Its purpose was to multiply, or amplify, a small electric charge to a level where it was detectable by the insensitive electroscopes of the day. Repeated operation of the device could produce voltages high enough to generate sparks. Description Cavallo described his machine in his 1795 Treatise on Electricity. He had examined Bennet's charge doubler of 1787 and found it wanting in several regards, notably in its inconsistent operation and tendency to retain the charge from an earlier experiment. Cavallo resolved to build a better device. His machine consisted of four metal plates supported on a wooden board by posts, of which three were insulating and one conducting. The charge to be multiplied was applied to the first of these (plate A), which stood on an insulating post. A moveable insulated metal plate (B) was brought close to A (though not permitted to touch it), and then grounded. The charge on A caused charge separation on B due to electrostatic induction. Plate B was then moved away, breaking its earth connection. Since B was insulated, it acquired and retained a small charge opposite in sign to the charge on A. Plate B was transferred by means of an insulating rod to be brought into electrical contact with the third metal plate C which was insulated. Since both B and C were conducting, B would transfer a portion of its charge to C. To maximise the transferred charge, C was placed in close proximity to a final metal plate D, which was earthed. The experimenter would move Plate B repeatedly back and forth, placing it near to A and earthed at one end of its motion, and then into contact with C at the other. With each cycle, charge was drawn from the Earth and added to C. After a suitable number of cycles, the grounded plate D would be removed, and the electrostatic potential on C would rise to approximately the potential of A multiplied by the number of operations. Cavallo termed his device a multiplier, though 'addition' was perhaps a more accurate description of its operation, as the charge on C was accumulated by successive additions.  Wilson's machine  Wilson's machine, described by its inventor in Nicholson's Journal in August 1804, was a development on this concept which simultaneously operated two Cavallo's multipliers by means of a pair of reciprocating levers. One side would accumulate the charge of the other, and since the two accumulating plates were connected together by means of a wire, Wilson's machine was a true multiplier, rather than an addition machine. The charge would thus accumulate more rapidly than Cavallo's multiplier and the machine could generate high voltages in a short period of time. It moreover was self- exciting, needing no initial charge to operate, as the small initial charge acquired from contact electrification was enough to start the accumulation process.

The rescued will never forget the rescuers.\\" Old postcard from Ceran√≥w, Masovian Voivodeship, Poland Alfreda was a well-educated woman, who spoke four languages including German, which was very helpful during the war, when she had to prevent the Nazi Germans from searching through their property. Her husband was raised with a patriotic spirit; his father participated in the January Uprising at the age of 17, and his brother Marian died as a volunteer in the Polish-Soviet War.Alfreda i Boleslaw Pietraszkowie, Webpage of the Treblinka Concentration Camp Museum Their birthdates are unknown, it has only been established that they were married in 1920. According to the testimony of their relative, Jolanta Okulicz-Kozaryn, their decision to hide the Jews was a conscious one. During the war, Alfreda and Boles≈Çaw Pietraszek, a childless couple ‚Äî both 60 years old ‚Äî lived on a farm in Ceran√≥w village (pictured) in Soko≈Ç√≥w County in east-central Poland. For two years, around their farm, they harbored several Jewish families consisting of 18 people: hiding in their barn, in their basements, and in pig pens. Collective rescue To feed the people they sheltered, Alfreda and Boles≈Çaw Pietraszek relied on assistance from their neighbors and other inhabitants of the village. \\"Odznaczenia dla Sprawiedliwych,\\" Magazyn Internetowy Forum September 26, 2007. The rescuers and the rescued were never betrayed, and only one person did not survive ‚Äî a child ‚Äî smothered by his own mother with a pillow in order to stop the crying when the German patrol was in the house. \\"Even now, I can't quite believe this was a true story regardless of how well documented it is\\" ‚Äî said Gra≈ºyna Panfil-Rogi≈Ñska, daughter of Zofia Panfil, remembering the telephone call from the elated Bencion Sela from Israel ‚Äî \\"he was so moved. Until today, over his own bed he has a portrait of his savior. He sent it to me via email\\" ‚Äî she said. Rogi≈Ñska received a call also from Szaul Kopyto living in Washington, who confessed that he kept silent for years only because he needed to forget the experience. The Jews, harbored by Pietraszek couple between 1941‚Äì1943 managed to escape from the ghetto in nearby Soko≈Ç√≥w Podlaski, a home to a large population of Jews before the invasion. The ghetto was eventually liquidated by the Nazis with all its inhabitants sent to Treblinka extermination camp. Among those rescued was the whole family of Bencian Sela (his name also spelled as Ben Cjon Sela) including his grandparents. Sela's family, after the war, wanted to present the Pietraszeks with gold and other valuables, but the Poles refused saying that the Selas would need it more. Alfreda and Boleslaw Pietraszek, Treblinka Concentration Camp Museum After the war, the Pietraszeks lost most of their 100-hectare farm to an agrarian reform in the new communist Poland. The couple was eventually forced to leave the village after being subjected to over two dozen assaults and robberies. Local thieves, aware that the couple had sheltered Jews on their property, believed that there were Jewish valuables there, unaware that Pietraszeks refused any financial help from the rescued. Boles≈Çaw Pietraszek was injured by a hand grenade in one of the assaults. They both died in abject poverty in 1965. The ceremony at which the Yad Vashem titles were granted to Alfreda and Boles≈Çaw Pietraszek took place during the inauguration of the Festival of the Jewish Culture in Olsztyn, popularized by Gazeta Wyborcza and other Polish media.

The author may distribute copies of their list to family, friends, and other stakeholders who are likely to purchase gifts for the would-be recipient, or to offer some of the listed items for sale. The goal of a wish list is to facilitate communication between the gift receiver and the gift giver. Wish lists often contain items that a gift purchaser can obtain from a variety of retailers. Some wish lists are specialized for particular purposes or concentrated at individual retailers, such as gift registries (e.g., bridal registries). Occasions In some cultures, people often exchange wish lists before major holidays that include gift giving, such as Christmas and birthdays. Other common occasions for issuing wish lists include baby showers, housewarmings, weddings, and charity drives.  Types  * A gift registry is a type of wish list that contains only items that can be purchased at the store which manages the registry. * An online wish list is a type of wish list that is hosted on the Internet. Online wish lists can be associated with a retailer or universal. * A product wish list is similar to a list of functional requirements. The difference is mainly the importance of the requested functionality. Items that might be on the wish list at one time may be expected to be requirements later. * A software user wishlist is a type of wish list that is created by the software manufacturer (such as the software development company or the website owner) or by user groups. * A bucket list is a type of personal wish list consisting of things a person wishes to do before they die (e.g. \\"kick the bucket\\") or before they reach a life stage milestone (e.g., the end of childhood; the end of High School, etc.) Online An online wish list typically allows a registered user to create a wish list, add wishes to it and then spread a link to the wish list via email or social media like Facebook and Twitter. Visitors to the published wish list can in most cases comment wishes and reserve them. This adds a collaborative perspective among the viewers that would be much harder to achieve for analog wish lists. Online wish lists on retailer websites allow you to save items you prefer from that retailer's site for future reference. Universal online wish lists allow you to add items from multiple retailers and even non-retail ideas. Software users Software user wish lists are a compilation of user suggestions for requested features. Many enterprise websites and software packages offer users the option to add a \\"wish\\" - a suggestion for improvement or change - and to vote on the importance of suggestions supplied by the publisher or author of the website or software, and they attempt to give a quick response to the suggestions. For example, Microsoft Visual Studio has a \\"community\\" menu, and Facebook has a \\"suggestions\\" section. In many cases, when a company fails to supply such a framework, users create their own lists, in Internet forums or in blogs. When such a list becomes popular, the company must respond to the common requests. Having software user wish lists has become popular since 2007 when a football gaming community FIFPlay started collecting fans wishlist for Electronic Arts for pre-development of FIFA (video game series) and it has collected over 10,000 ideas and suggestions for FIFA 08.

Job performance is no longer considered to consist strictly of performance on a task. Rather, with an increasingly competitive job market, employees are expected to go above and beyond the requirements listed in their job descriptions. Contextual performance, which is defined as activities that contribute to the social and psychological core of the organization, is beginning to be viewed as equally important to task performance.Borman, W., & Motowildo, S. (1997). Task performance and contextual performance: The meaning for personnel selection research. Human Performance, 10(2), 99-109. Examples of contextual performance include volunteering for additional work, following organizational rules and procedures even when personally inconvenient, assisting and cooperating with coworkers, and various other discretionary behaviors. By strengthening the viability of social networks, these activities are posited to enhance the psychological climate in which the technical core is nested.  Overview  This construct was first identified in the industrial and organizational psychology research world by Borman & Motowidlo. Since that time, contextual performance has become an increasingly important research topic. Because of increased research efforts being focused on contextual performance, actual organizations have begun utilizing this concept by both rewarding it and incorporating it into performance appraisals. With the rise of the knowledge economy, the expectations for employees have expanded. Employees who exhibit voluntary effort and spontaneous, innovative behavior are increasingly important for organizations' competitive advantage. While the construct of contextual performance is very similar to organizational citizenship behavior (OCBs) and prosocial behavior, various Industrial/Organizational psychologists contend that contextual performance is in fact a construct in its own right. The counterpart to contextual performance is task performance. Task performance is defined as the work activities that contribute to an organization's technical core. Contextual performance is more likely to be voluntary in nature, whereas task performance is more likely to be prescribed by the formal job role. Despite the fact that contextual performance is more discretionary in nature, research indicates that managers include these behaviors when conducting performance evaluations. This highlights the fact that these behaviors are becoming more and more a requirement on the job.Johnson, J. (2001). The relative importance of task and contextual performance dimensions to supervisor judgments of overall performance. Journal of Applied Psychology, 86(5), 984-996. While conceptually different, these two types of performance have moderately high correlations, indicating that they share some of the same properties or those employees who are good task performers also are good contextual performers. These findings suggest that the two constructs are distinct yet related, which is important because this overlap may be influenced during performance evaluations.Dalal, R. S. (2007). Contextual performance / prosocial behavior / organizational citizenship behavior. In S. G. Rogelberg (Ed.) Encyclopedia of industrial/organizational psychology (Vol. 1, pp.103-106). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage  Taxonomy  Research has yielded several taxonomies of contextual performance and organizational citizenship behavior. Borman & Motowildo describe contextual performance as encompassing both OCB's and prosocial work behaviors. The following is Borman & Motowildo's taxonomy: *Persisting with enthusiasm and extra effort as necessary to complete own task activities successfully *Volunteering to carry out task activities that are not formally part of own job *Helping and cooperating with others *Following organizational rules and procedures *Endorsing, supporting, and defending organizational objectives *Interpersonal facilitation *Job dedication In order to garner information regarding an employee's contextual performance, researchers generally adapt items from the previous taxonomy. Items are generally measured by supervisors on a Likert Scale, from one to five. A few sample items that capture the construct of contextual performance are: * The employee voluntarily does more than the job requires to help others or contribute to organizational effectiveness * The employee tackles a difficult work assignment enthusiastically * The employee volunteers for additional dutyMotowidlo, S., & Van Scotter, J. (1994). Evidence that task performance should be distinguished from contextual performance. Journal of Applied Psychology, 79(4), 475-480.  Dispositional predictors In order to select employees who will engage in contextual performance, employers need to identify what traits of prospective employees predict contextual performance. Researchers believe that there are different traits and abilities that predict task and contextual performance. Intelligence has been found to be a significant predictor of task performance. Intelligence, or general mental ability, was also found to predict procedural knowledge, or knowledge of how to do a task, which in turn predicts contextual performance.Bergman, M., Donovan, M., Drasgow, F., Overton, R., & Henning, J. (2008). Test of Motowildo et al.‚Äôs (1997) theory of individual differences in task and contextual performance. Human Performance, 21, 227-253. Otherwise, there is limited support for the relationship between intelligence and contextual performance. Because of this, research has also explored non- cognitive predictors of performance such as personality.Motowildo, S., Borman, W, & Schmit, M. (1997). A Theory of Individual Differences in Task and Contextual Performance. Human Performance, 10(2), 71-83. Research findings show that the personality trait of conscientiousness does indeed have a weak to moderate positive relationship with contextual performance. Openness to experience and extraversion, however, was found to have a weak correlation at most.Dalal, R. S. (2007). Contextual performance / prosocial behavior / organizational citizenship behavior. In S. G. Rogelberg (Ed.)Encyclopedia of industrial/organizational psychology (Vol. 1, pp.103-106). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. As contextual performance is sometimes directed at other employees, it is important to note that in a team setting, the personality traits of conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness predict contextual performance.Morgeson, F. P., Reider, M. H., & Campion, M. A. (2005). Selecting individuals in team settings: The importance of social skills, personality characteristics, and teamwork knowledge. Personnel Psychology, 58(3), 583-612. Other personality traits, besides the Big Five, have also been researched. It was found that the relationship between dependability, work orientation, and cooperativeness and contextual performance is significantly larger than their relationship with task performance.  Situational and job-related predictors  Along with personality and dispositional traits, the job-related characteristics and attitudes of organizational justice, job satisfaction, and leader supportiveness are all antecedents of contextual performance. Specifically, if an individual perceives that he/she is being treated fairly, if they are satisfied with their job, and if they feel that their supervisor or leader provides support, their contextual performance is expected to increase. These antecedents are important because they are potentially under the control of organizations. By improving upon certain job-related characteristics, organizations may be able to increase the amount of contextual performance done by employees. Procedural justice describes the fairness used in the allocation process and was found to be positively related to two dimension of contextual performance, interpersonal facilitation and job dedication.Aryee, S., Chen, Z., & Budhwar, P. (2004). Exchange fairness and employee performance: An examination of the relationship between organizational politics and procedural justice. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 94, 1-14. Although the correlations are weak-to- moderate, summary findings imply that when individuals are satisfied with their job and that their supervisor or leader provides support to them; their contextual performance is expected to increase. As evidenced by the finding that the interaction of politics at the workplace and agreeableness predicted interpersonal facilitation, organizations need to recognize that both individual differences and situational constraints influence contextual performance.Witt, L., Kacmar, K., Carlson, D., & Zivnuska, S. (2002). Interactive effects of personality and organizational politics on contextual performance. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 23, 911-926.  Outcomes  Contextual performance has been found to be related to overall employee job performance. A significant portion of supervisor ratings can be accounted for by not just task performance, but contextual performance as well. Other organizational outcomes such as turnover (employment) have been found to be related to contextual performance. Indeed, research shows that contextual performance is a significant predictor of turnover over and above task performance.Van Scotter, J. (2000). Relationships of task performance and contextual performance with turnover, job satisfaction, and affective commitment. Human Resource Management Review, 10(1), 79-95. Employees displaying more contextual performance behaviors were less likely to turnover than those engaging in less contextual performance behaviors. While also touted as a predictor of contextual performance, organizational commitment has been found to be an outcome of contextual performance. The facet of interpersonal facilitation significantly predicts organizational commitment. Research generally supports that contextual performance does indeed relate to overall organization performance as measured by quality, quantity, financial measures, and customer service measures.  Theoretical implications  Many conceptualizations of employee performance focus only on task performance, and may thus be deficient because they lack the contextual performance construct.Werner, J. (2000). Implications of OCB and contextual performance for human resource management. Human Resource Management Review, 10(1), 3-24. Performance is multi-dimensional, and since evidence indicates that supervisor ratings include contextual performance, a holistic conceptualization of performance should include both task and contextual performance. Another theoretical implication is the overlapping nature of contextual performance with both OCB and prosocial behavior. Some researchers argue that OCB clearly overlaps with contextual performance and should be redefined as the same construct.Organ, D. (1997) Organizational citizenship behavior: It‚Äôs construct clean-up time. Human Performance, 10(2), 85-97. Future theoretical and empirical work should address these discrepancies and adjust the way it is conceptualized and operationalized as such. There is also a conceptual distinction between in-role and extra-role behaviors. Contextual performance is considered to be extra-role behaviors that are not necessarily expected or rewarded by the organization. However, this conceptualization may not be accurate.  Practical implications  If contextual performance is a fundamental part of the employee performance criteria, then contextual performance should be considered in all aspects of the employment process, this includes selection, performance appraisal, and rewards. Selection procedures should take into account the predictors of both task and contextual performance. Therefore, when conducting performance appraisals, organizations may want to explicate that they take into account facets of both contextual and task performance. Lastly, rewards and incentives should be set up to address employees who perform helping behaviors that contribute to the overall goals of an organization as well as behaviors that contribute strictly to individuals‚Äô projects.

The organization derives its name from the name of the continent of Africa and from the former Malagasy Republic, now Madagascar. The organization went defunct in 1985. History The organization was founded on 12 September 1961 in Antananarivo by members of the Brazzaville Group of French-Speaking States developing out of a meeting held in Brazzaville in December 1960. Twelve francophone countries agreed to maintain close relationships but also a special relationship with the former colonial power, France. The original aims were both economic and political: to adopt common stands on international issues, to promote economic and culture cooperation, and to maintain a common defense organization. However, this caused a problem: the organization would have to depend on France. The diversity, geography, and post-colonial problems of the different countries stopped the organization from ever becoming significant. In March 1964 the UAM changed its name to the Afro-Malagasy Union for Economic Cooperation (Union Africaine et Malgache de Coop√©ration √âconomique; UAMCE).Milutin Tomanoviƒá (1965) Hronika meƒëunarodnih dogaƒëaja 1964, Institute of International Politics and Economics, p224 (in Serbo- Croatian) Moktar Ould Daddah was elected as the president of the organisation while the city of Yaound√© was selected as the headquarters seat. Subsequently, it confined itself to economic affairs and by 1966 had become inactive. The African and Malagasy Common Organization (Organization Commune Africaine et Malgache; OCAM) was the successor to the UAMCE. It was set up at Nouakchott in February 1965 and comprised the original 12 members of the UAM with the addition of Togo. In May 1965 its membership was increased by the admission of the former Belgian colonies of Congo (Kinshasa) and Rwanda. In June 1965, however, Mauritania withdrew. The remaining 14 then signed the new OCAM charter on 27 June at a meeting in Antananarivo, Madagascar. The aims of the organization were economic, social, technical, and cultural cooperation. OCAM dropped the political and defense objectives that its predecessor, the UAM, had attempted to embrace. It created the structures of an international organization: a Conference of Heads of State and Government, a Council of Ministers, a Secretariat and Secretary-General, and established its headquarters at Bangui in the Central African Republic. It developed a number of joint services and of these the most successful and most well known is the multinational airline Air Afrique. In 1979 the airline was separated from OCAM. The organization's later history became increasingly troubled. Mauritius joined in 1970. Congo (Kinshasa), by then renamed Zaire, withdrew in 1972; Congo (Brazzaville) in 1973; Cameroon, Chad and Madagascar in 1974; Gabon in 1977. However, some of these countries retained their links with OCAM's various agencies. In 1982 OCAM held a summit at Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire; it had then changed its name, though only to substitute Mauritius for Madagascar, to Organization Commune Africaine et Mauricienne. OCAM, also, has ceased to operate. The organization officially became extinct in 1985.

Description Typically, when a recipient compiles a list of items they wish to receive and then distributes it to family and friends, they have created a wish list. A registry, on the other hand, is made public, and the retailer or registry system provider removes items from the list as they are purchased. Registry managers will often not divulge who has purchased the registered items. In the United Kingdom, a gift registry is frequently referred to as a \\"gift list\\" and has become an established part of British weddings, with the service often provided by most department stores. Retailer-specific versus multiple retailers Traditionally, registries were limited to the stock of a given retailer, which maintained the list for the registrant and ensured that items were removed from the list as they were purchased. However, online gift registries that are not specific to any retailer have become an increasingly popular alternative to retailer-specific registries, as the former offers more flexible means of adding gifts and coordinating purchases, as well as social networking capabilities. In 2004, North American shopping centers (notably Galleria Edina) began to extend this concept by offering registries that had access to multiple shops within individual centers. Goals  A managed registry system has several goals: #It facilitates communication between gift givers and receivers. Recipients can compile a gift registry and make it available to anyone who will present them with a gift. Gift givers can then be certain they are purchasing items the receiver will appreciate. #An efficiently-managed registry can prevent gift givers from giving duplicating gifts. To accomplish this, the retailer should remove each item from the registry as it is purchased. #The registry process should allow gift purchasers to be discreet about what they have bought. This is so the gift's recipient will not know who purchased which items until they are surprised at the time of gift giving. #The registry system should benefit the retailer by bringing customers to their store or website, to purchase products the merchant carries. #The store is often able to deliver all of the gifts to the recipients at a mutually convenient time before or after the event, for the convenience of both the givers and the recipient. Examples Gift registries are often used for a variety of occasions, such as anniversaries, baby showers, birthdays, civil ceremonies, graduations, and housewarming parties. * For example, engaged couples use a bridal registry to indicate the pattern(s) and item(s) they desire for such product lines as china and silverware, so gift-givers will know which items to buy as wedding gifts. * Similarly, those purchasing a new home may register the furniture and domestic items, such as appliances, they desire for their housewarming.

They then refer to the Independence War, which resulted in the separation of the Thirteen Colonies from the British Empire, as the First American Civil War.Eric Herschthal.

A significant number of American colonists stayed loyal to the British Crown and as Loyalists fought on the British side while opposite were a significant amount of colonists called Patriots who fought on the American side. In some localities, there was fierce fighting between Americans including gruesome instances of hanging, drawing, and quartering on both sides.Thomas Allen.

According to Armitage, \\"The renaming can happen relatively quickly: for example, the transatlantic conflict of the 1770s that many contemporaries saw as a British \\"civil war\\" or even \\"the American Civil War\\" was first called \\"the American Revolution\\" in 1776 by the chief justice of South Carolina, William Henry Drayton.\\" As Canadian historian William Stewart Wallace noted: As early as 1789, David Ramsay, an American patriot historian, wrote in his History of the American Revolution that, \\"Many circumstances concurred to make the American war particularly calamitous. It was originally a civil war in the estimation of both parties.\\"David Ramsay. The History of the American Revolution . 1789.

Due to severity of the social, political and constitutional challenges and conflicts of the Reconstruction Era, the Reconstruction is sometimes called the Second Civil War.Howell, Kenneth W.

The term was cemented by the American Experience episode \\"Reconstruction: The Second Civil War\\" and made its way to the school curriculum.Reconstruction (1865‚Äì1877): \\"The Second Civil War\\" , Bellows Free Academy =Culture war as Second American Civil War= In the 21st century, during an ongoing culture war between American conservatives and liberals over opposing cultural, moral, and religious ideals, some political commentators have characterized the polarized political discourse as either an actual Second Civil War or a potential prelude for one. According to one 2018 Rasmussen poll, 31 percent of American voters feared that the intense partisanship following the 2016 presidential election and the victory of Donald Trump would cause a Second Civil War within five years. In 2019, the national bipartisan Battleground Civility Poll by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service revealed that \\"the average voter believes the U.S. is two-thirds of the way to the edge of a civil war.\\"NEW POLL: Voters Find Political Divisions So Bad, Believe U.S. Is Two-Thirds Of The Way To ‚ÄúEdge Of A Civil War‚Äù, Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service * In 2017, conservative Dennis Prager claimed that Americans are actually in the midst of the Second Civil War, albeit not necessarily violent.Dennis Prager. Yes, America Is in the Midst of a Civil War , The Daily Signal, June 6, 2017. In March 2019, investigative journalist Carl Bernstein said in an interview that the U.S. was in a \\"cold civil war\\" and that Trump was every day bringing it closer to ignition. Later that year conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh stated that the United States had entered a \\"Cold Civil War\\" after the start of a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump during the 2019 Trump-Ukraine scandal. Far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website InfoWars made multiple claims that the Democratic Party planned to launch a civil war, most famously in 2018 when he claimed that the Democrats would launch a coup d'√©tat against President Trump on Independence Day. During the Special Counsel investigation by Robert Mueller, Sean Hannity claimed on his radio show that an attempt to remove President Trump from office would result in a civil war \\"fighting and dividing this country at a level we‚Äôve never seen\\" between \\"those that stand for truth and those that literally buy into the corrupt deep state attacks against a duly elected president.\\" * Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich similarly argued that deep-state theories could serve as an ideological justification for an insurgency supported by the U.S. Armed Forces . After the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the American political scientist and specialist in civil wars Barbara F. Walter argued that the recent increase in domestic terrorism and high rate of gun violence in the United States could be indicators of an impending second civil war. In January 2019, Dmitry Rogozin, the Administrator of Roscosmos, cancelled a visit to the United States due to the effects of the 2018‚Äì19 United States federal government shutdown on NASA and claimed to TASS that \\"I think that America is actually engulfed by its second civil war now.\\" * On March 19, 2019, Representative Steve King posted an Internet meme reading \\"Folks keep talking about another civil war. One side has about 8 trillion bullets, while the other side doesn‚Äôt know which bathroom to use,‚Äù and was met with intense criticism. * In a response to a series of comments by President Trump perceived by critics as racist about a group of female Democratic congresswomen of color (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib) known as \\"the Squad,\\" journalist Susan B. Glaser described the political atmosphere of the United States as a \\"political civil war\\" in an article for The New Yorker. * Writing for the National Review, Victor Davis Hanson blamed the policies of President Barack Obama, the Digital Revolution, \\"campus radicalism,\\" and globalization for bringing the United States to \\"the brink of a veritable civil war.\\" * Thomas E. Ricks argued in a 2017 article for Foreign Policy that the current political tensions of the United States could escalate to asymmetric or irregular warfare with the help of increasing radicalization and digital propaganda, and speculated that \\"the likelihood of a second U.S. civil war in the next five years is between 20 and 40 percent but trending upward significantly.\\" * After the opening of the impeachment inquiry, President Trump made a Twitter post paraphrasing an evangelical Christian pastor and Fox News contributor, Robert Jeffress: \\"If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\\" Trump's statement was criticized as incitement to violence by political leaders on both sides of the aisle. Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) posted in response \\"I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @RealDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.\\" Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) backed up Kinzinger's stance saying \\"I agree with Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger that @realDonaldTrump's tweet about a civil war over impeachment is beyond repugnant.\\"https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/1178561698157883393 Meghan McCain, daughter of the late Senator John McCain, criticized Trump's comments on The View.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LWd797gjLM #CivilWar2 and #CivilWarSignup soon trended on Twitter after Trump's tweets. * In the podcast series It Could Happen Here Robert Evans discussed reasons for a potential conflict, how one may breakout, potential government response, and possible outcomes to a civil war. He draws upon his experiences in war-torn places like Ukraine and Syria in order to make comparisons with contemporary American society and discourse. * During the George Floyd protests, some former CIA analysts expressed fear that President Donald Trump would commence a military crackdown against protesters and possibly risking a violent national collapse. This came particularly after his administration ordered tear gas to be used against nonviolent protesters in Lafayette Square for a photo op at St. John's Episcopal Church and called for the U.S. Armed Forces to be deployed against protesters across the country under the Insurrection Act. King University professor Gail Helt wrote \\"I've seen this kind of violence.... This is what autocrats do. This is what happens in countries before a collapse. It really does unnerve me.\\" Marc Polymeropoulos compared President Trump to Bashar al-Assad, Saddam Hussein, and Muammar Gaddafi. Other analysts accused the Trump administration as describing American urban centers as foreign war zones, or criticized his intent to declare the antifa movement a terrorist organization as a pretext for a crackdown. Additionally, a U.S. intelligence report claimed that the Boogaloo movement, a far right extremist movement, was active in the protests. This included both radical anti- government activists, and white-supremacists who seek to cause a second Civil War by undermining race relations. * In June 2020, an audio tape leaked in which three police officers from Wilmington, North Carolina, were caught using derogatory remarks to describe black Americans, saying that they should be slaughtered and that \\"there should be another civil war to wipe them off the fucking map.\\" The three officers involved were fired after an investigation. On his first day of the job, Wilmington Police Chief Donny Williams condemned the incident and advocated for police reform. It was later revealed that two of the officers had prior disciplinary issues, including some which occurred in the 1990s. * In October 2020, according to a federal indictment, 14 members of a group called Wolverine Watchmen, who were arrested for plotting the kidnapping of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, were planning to start a second civil war \\"leading to societal collapse\\".https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/520319-militia-group-plan- to-kidnap-whitmer-was-part-of-attempt-to-start-civil Other political and social commentators acknowledge that extreme partisan politics on Capitol Hill, accompanied by related commonplace verbal and occasional physical acts of aggression in the streets, are tearing apart the fabric of American society,Alex Zakrzewski.

The Columbus Dispatch, June 15, 2017. In popular culture =Literature= * In the semi- satirical 1935 political novel by American author Sinclair Lewis, It Can't Happen Here, a second civil war breaks out due to the tyrannical policies of fictional President Berzelius \\"Buzz\\" Windrip. Published during the rise of fascism in Europe, the novel describes the rise of Windrip, a politician who defeats Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) and is elected President of the United States, after fomenting fear and promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and \\"traditional\\" values. After his election, Windrip takes complete control of the government and imposes a plutocratic/totalitarian rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force, in the manner of Adolf Hitler and the SS. The novel's plot centers on journalist Doremus Jessup's opposition to the new regime and his subsequent struggle against it as part of a liberal rebellion. Reviewers at the time, and literary critics since, have emphasized the connection with Louisiana politician Huey Long, who was preparing to run for president in the 1936 election when he was assassinated in 1935 just prior to the novel's publication. * Philip K. Dick's 1974 novel, Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said is set in a futuristic dystopia, where the United States has become a police state in the aftermath of a Second Civil War. The story follows a genetically enhanced pop singer and television star who wakes up in a world where he has never existed. * In Canadian author Margaret Atwood's 1985 dystopian novel, The Handmaid's Tale, a secretive group of religious fundamentalists called \\"The Sons of Jacob\\" stages an attack that kills the U.S. President and most of Congress. In the ensuing political and social upheaval, the group launches a hostile revolution and suspends the United States Constitution under the pretext of restoring order. Within this autocratic new system, the group is quickly able to curtail or take away human, civil, and in particular women's rights. Under their newfound authority, The Sons of Jacob declare the establishment of The Republic of Gilead ‚Äî a theocratic military dictatorship within the borders of what was formerly the United States of America. The new regime moves quickly to consolidate its power and reorganize society with an Old Testament-inspired social and religious fanaticism, and enshrines in law a militarized, hierarchical system of newly-created societal classes and cultural castes. At the same time, the Gileadian army continues to fight a Second American Civil War against various factions who oppose the new regime. The novel primarily takes place 16 years after the events that occurred during the establishment of Gilead, and depicts a grim picture of society, where pollution caused by nuclear and biological issues have caused near-universal infertility and a sharp rise in birth defects, where women are subjugated and valued only for their reproductive capacities, and where minorities of every stripe are persecuted. * In the 1995 alternate history/time travel novel ARC Riders by David Drake and Janet Morris, the United States is on the verge of collapse and possible nuclear civil war due to over two decades of harsh military rule as a result of the ARC Raiders meddling with the Vietnam War. * In the 1997 alternate history novel Back in the USSA by Eugene Byrne and Kim Newman, a Second American Civil War and a Second American Revolution occur as a result of the corrupt presidency of Charles Foster Kane, who becomes the 28th president after former president and Progressive Party candidate Theodore Roosevelt wins the 1912 presidential election, but is assassinated on December 19, 1912 before taking office by the sharpshooter and exhibition shooter Annie Oakley when he personally attempts to break up a labor strike at the Chicago Union Stock Yards with the help of the Rough Riders. Due to his being Roosevelt's running mate, Kane becomes president on March 4, 1913. By 1917, the U.S. becomes unstable politically and socially. That year, the Socialist Party led by Eugene Debs gains increasing support and both a Second American Civil War and Second American Revolution (both based on the Russian Civil War and Russian Revolution, respectively) breaks out, following which Kane is ousted from the White House, overthrown, and executed for treason. The United States becomes the United Socialist States of America (USSA) with Debs as its president, surviving until his death in 1926. * In the 2002 short story \\"Southern Strategy\\" by Michael F. Flynn that is collected in the anthology Alternate Generals II by Harry Turtledove, a shortened World War I leaves the German Empire a world power in the 20th century, while the United States all but collapses during a genocide-based second civil war. * In the 2002 novel A Disturbance of Fate by Mitchell J. Freedman, Barry Sadler gets elected President of the United States in 1984 and causes a second civil war due to his conservative politics. After much destruction of the nation, Sadler is arrested and a new Constitution is put into place, which abolishes the office of the presidency. * In one of the timelines in the 2003 novel Fuzzy Dice by Paul Di Filippo, George McGovern is narrowly elected president in 1972 after incumbent Richard Nixon had undergone an assassination attempt and become completely paranoid, waging a crackdown on real and imagined domestic foes as well as a huge escalation of the Vietnam War, and setting off a huge explosion of countrywide riots. The riots continue and even increase after McGovern's election and a call by the new president for a return to calm proves completely ineffective. McGovern rejects a call in Congress to use the Army to quell the riots, leading to an attempted impeachment. Some military commanders try repression on their own, killing civilians and only adding to the ferocity of the riots. Eventually, the country is plunged into chaos, an all-out Second American Civil War, and eventually the total collapse of the Old Order. When the book's protagonist arrives some decades later, he finds a \\"Hippie-style\\" dictatorship presided over by the monstrous Lady Sunshine and with Hells Angels acting as the police, and the final fate of McGovern is unknown. * Empire by Orson Scott Card is a 2006 novel set in a near-future US (implied to be 2008) where after the President and Vice President are assassinated civil war breaks out. A left-wing group called the Progressive Restoration rises up, seeking to reverse change since George W. Bush's election, with the main characters becoming involved in the conflict. The novel is a tie-in to the Shadow Complex video game, with Hidden Empire following in 2009. * In the 2012 novel by Billy Bennett titled By Force of Arms (part of a series by the author focusing on a victorious Confederacy), the United States (led by William Tecumseh Sherman) and the Confederate States (led by Robert E. Lee) fight \\"The Second American Civil War\\" in 1869 due to Confederate and French military involvement in Mexico, with fighting spreading across the two countries from ironclads firing at each other in the Gulf of California, trench warfare in the Confederate state of Virginia, Buffalo Soldiers fighting in the west, pro- Confederate bushwacker partisans in the Union state of Missouri made even more deadly by the usage of the introduction of breech-loading rifles and Gatling guns. * The 2013 novel Pulse by Patrick Carman depicts a Second Civil War, escalating into a nuclear disaster, leaving only one area of land habitable, divided into 2 states constantly at war. * American War, the 2017 debut novel by Omar El Akkad, is told from the viewpoint of members of the Chestnut family who have experienced the War first-hand. The War begins in 2074, when anthropogenic climate change has led to a ban on fossil fuels, leading to the secession of several Southern states. The events of the novel themselves are influenced by widespread plagues, and culture wars over increased immigration of Muslims. * Tropic of Kansas, the 2017 debut novel by Christopher Brown, is told from the points of view of Sig, an orphan running from the law, and Tania, a government investigator forced to hunt him.

He immigrated to the United States when he was 25.James Corcoran in the New York, Passenger and Immigration Lists, 1820-1850 He worked as a laborer in New Orleans for a time and also lived in Cold- Spring-on-the-Hudson (present-day Cold Spring, New York) before settling in New York City prior to the American Civil War. He found work as a truckman and, experiencing some prejudice, Corcoran made a home in a squatter colony in Dutch Hill. The colony was constructed on an earth mound near 40th Street and the First Avenue and was considered a high-crime poverty-stricken area of the city. Corcoran was the first to organize neighboring squatters to build a permanent shanty community. By the 1860s, he had become acknowledged as head of the colony. During its early years, residents feuded with neighboring squatters on Clara's Hill, founded and named by immigrants who had lived in the area of the same name in Mountmellick, County Laois. Frequent fighting led to altercations with police, whom the squatters often turn against to the amusement of onlookers, and Corcoran would often put up bail for offenders and was reputed to have \\"a caustic tongue and a ready wit\\" when he arrived at the local station house. The Corcoran family eventually left the colony and moved to a nearby brick house on East 40th Street but remained involved in the shanty's affairs for another two decades. In May 1899, he offered the deed to Corcoran's Roost as security to release Robert Dougherty on bail from Yorkville Court.\\"James Corcoran In Court; Ruler of Corcoran's Roost Goes Bail for a Man After His Own Heart\\".New York Times.

It lies on , northeast of Inangahua. Lyell was named by the geologist Julius von Haast after the British geologist Charles Lyell, a friend of Sir George Grey, whose writings had influenced Charles Darwin. The gold rush in Lyell began in 1862 when MƒÅori prospectors found gold in Lyell Creek, a tributary of the Buller River. In 1869 two Italian miners, Antonio Zala and Giorgio Zanetti, discovered gold in quartz veins in the Lyell Creek area. The mine in this quartz reef was worked from 1872 until 1912. The settlement grew quickly with a population of about 100 in 1863, despite the area being inaccessible, difficult to work and prone to flooding. In the 1870s Lyell had a main street, Cliff St, with banks, newspaper offices and hotels. The population grew to more than 2000 in the late 1880s. By 1901 the population was 90 with 40 children at the school and in 1905 the Alpine Extended Gold Mining Co Ltd still employed 60 people. Local newspapers were published during the height of settlement: the Lyell Argus and Matakitaki Advertiser from 1873 to 1882 and the Lyell Times and Central Buller Gazette from 1881 to 1898. The newspaper office and other buildings in Cliff St were destroyed by a fire in 1896. One of the miners who worked at Lyell in the 1880s and 1890s was the Irish woman Bridget Goodwin, known as Biddy. The Italian miners later turned to dairy farming in the Lyell area. A small settlement at Lyell continued until the 1960s. The ghost town is now a campsite maintained by the Department of Conservation. None of the original buildings remain but a track from the campsite leads to a cemetery and an old stamping battery. A dray road that was built at the time of the gold working towards the Lyell Saddle is now the start of the Old Ghost Road, a mountain biking and walking trail, in length, that finishes at Seddonville.

Medical use Cyclofenil is used to treat menstrual disturbances and anovulatory infertility caused by insufficiency of the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis in women. It has also been used to treat menopausal symptoms. The medication is generally used at a dosage of 400 to 600 mg per day. =Available forms= Cyclofenil has been available in the form of 100, 200, and 400 mg oral tablets. Non-medical use Cyclofenil has been used by male athletes to increase testosterone levels. It is not effective for this purpose in women. Contraindications Cyclofenil is contraindicated during pregnancy and in those with severe liver disease and unexplained uterine bleeding. Side effects Cyclofenil is associated with a relatively high incidence of hepatotoxicity. Biochemical signs of undesirable liver changes have been observed in 35% or more of individuals and 1% of individuals experience overt hepatitis. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Cyclofenil is a SERM, or a mixed agonist and antagonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It is described as a relatively weak/mild SERM. The medication is generally less effective than other SERMs. The medication is an \\"impeded estrogen\\" and is thought to work as a progonadotropin by blocking the actions of estrogens in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, thereby disinhibiting release of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. In men, cyclofenil can increase testosterone levels due its progonadotropic effects. =Pharmacokinetics= In terms of distribution, cyclofenil acts both centrally and peripherally. The elimination half-life of cyclofenil after a single 200 mg dose is 18 to 29 hours. Chemistry Cyclofenil is a nonsteroidal SERM and is closely related structurally to triphenylethylene SERMs like clomifene and tamoxifen. It has been referred to as a diphenylethylene derivative, differing from triphenylethylenes only by the replacement of one of the phenyl rings with a cyclohexane ring. History Cyclofenil was first introduced for medical use in 1970 under the brand name Ondogyne in France. Subsequently, it was introduced throughout the world under a variety of other brand names, including its most well-known brand name Sexovid. Society and culture =Generic names= Cyclofenil is the English generic name of the drug and its , , and . =Brand names= Cyclofenil has been marketed under a variety of brand names including Ciclifen, Fertodur, Gyneuro, Klofenil, Menoferil, Menopax, Neoclym, Oginex, Ondonid, Ondogyne, Rehibin, Sexadieno, Sexovar, and Sexovid.https://www.micromedexsolutions.com/ =Availability= Cyclofenil remains available today only in Brazil, Italy, and Japan. In the past, it has also been available in France, Germany, Mexico, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. =Regulation= Clomifene is included on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of illegal doping agents in sport. Research Cyclofenil was investigated as a possible treatment for scleroderma in the 1980s, but was found to be ineffective. Later study of its efficacy in treating Raynaud's phenomenon in people with scleroderma also found no significant benefit.

An acylated derivative, melengestrol acetate, is used as a growth promoter in animals. While melengestrol is sometimes used as a synonym for melengestrol acetate, what is usually being referred to is melengestrol acetate and not melengestrol. Synthesis 6-Methyl-16-dehydropregnenolone acetate (5) is the key intermediate to the preparation of both melengesterol acetate and medrogestone. Petrov and his collaborators have devised several interesting schemes that go back to diosgenin as the starting point. These schemes perform the necessary modifications in rings A and B with the sapogenin side chain still in place. In essence this approach employs this side chain as a protecting group for the future 16-dehydro-20-ketone function. In one of these routes, diosgenin is first converted to the 3-toluenesulfonate (1). Solvolysis of this homoallylic alcohol derivative affords the 3,5-cyclosteroid (2), via the cyclopropyl carbinyl ion (carbenium ion) (not shown). (This general reaction was probably first found in the steroids and bore the name of \\"i-steroid rearrangement.\\") Oxidation of the product by means of PCC affords the ketone. Reaction of this with methylmagnesium iodide affords two isomeric carbinols with the Œ±-isomer predominating (3). Solvolysis in the presence of a nucleophile such as acetic acid reverses the cyclopropylcarbinyl transformation to afford homoallylic acetate. Removal of the sapogenin side chain leads to the desired product (5). Melengesterol synthesis: Substitution at the 16 position was found to lead to further potentiation of progestational activity. Reaction with diazomethane at the conjugated double bond at 16 gives first the pyrazole (6). This heterocycle affords the 16 methyl enone on pyrolysis (7). Selective epoxidation of the conjugated double bond to the 16,17Œ±-epoxide over that at 5,6 is achieved by oxidation with basic hydrogen peroxide (8). Opening of this tetrasubstituted oxirane ring in acid proceeds with loss of a proton from the Œ≤ position (16 methyl) (9) to afford the desired 16-methylene-17Œ±-hydroxy-20-ketone functionality in the D ring (10). The product is saponified and then the subject of an Oppenauer oxidation, which is then dehydrogenated to the 4,6-diene with chloranil (11). Acetylation under forcing conditions completes the synthesis of melengesterol acetate.

It is the fifth and final novel of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series and serves as the direct sequel to The Battle of the Labyrinth. The Last Olympian revolves around the demigod Percy Jackson as he leads his friends in a last stand to protect Mount Olympus. Upon release, the book received highly positive reviews from various critics. It was also the #1 USA Today bestseller, the #1 Wall Street Journal bestseller, and #1 Los Angeles Times bestseller.  Plot  While Percy Jackson is on a drive with Rachel Dare, he is approached by Charles Beckendorf, and the two head off to attack Luke's ship, The Princess Andromeda. Kronos, hosted in the mortal body of Luke, is not caught off guard because of a spy at Camp Half- Blood, and Beckendorf is killed. Percy awakens later in his father Poseidon's underwater palace, which is under siege by the Titan Oceanus. Percy wants to help fight, but Poseidon sends Percy back to Camp Half-Blood to hear the \\"Great Prophecy.\\" Once there, Percy informs the camp of the spy and learns that the Olympians are fighting Typhon. That night, Percy leaves with Nico di Angelo, son of Hades, following a lead on how to defeat Kronos. After visiting Luke's mother in Westport, Connecticut, and talking with Hestia, Percy procures a blessing from his mother. He then descends into the underworld to bathe in the River Styx and take on the curse of Achilles. Despite being betrayed by Nico in exchange for information on the boy's mother, Percy is successful and uses his new invulnerability to defeat a small army of Hades's minions. Percy emerges from the Underworld in New York City, leaving Nico behind to convince his father to join the fight against Kronos. Percy calls the campers to help defend Olympus, as the gods refuse to end their struggle with Typhon. Just before the battle begins, New York City is affected by a powerful sleeping spell from Morpheus, Hecate, and Kronos himself. Despite being joined by Thalia's Hunters of Artemis, the Party Ponies, and a few other allies, the Olympian army struggles to hold back repeated assaults by the Titan army. Camp Half-Blood suffers approximately 16 casualties, out of an original 40 campers. Annabeth herself is badly injured when she saves Percy from an attack by Ethan Nakamura that would have hit Percy in his Achilles point. Even after these setbacks, Percy refuses a chance to surrender offered by Prometheus, and entrusts the titan's gift of Pandora's pithos to Hestia. The campers successfully defeat Hyperion, further enraging Kronos. Rachel Dare, who has been experiencing inexplicable moments of prophecy, arrives to warn Percy of a drakon that can only be killed by a child of Ares. The campers do poorly against the drakon until Silena Beauregard arrives disguised as Ares's head counselor Clarisse and breaks the cabin's boycott of the war, getting badly injured in the process. The real Clarisse arrives in a fury and kills the drakon by herself. As Silena lies dying, the campers learn that she was the camp's spy, but chose to right her wrongs after her boyfriend Beckendorf's death. Percy contacts his father and asks Poseidon to join the fight against Typhon; he reluctantly agrees. Driven back to the blocks surrounding the Empire State building, Percy and his friends make their last stand to protect Mount Olympus. Even when Hades arrives with Nico and an army, Kronos still manages to enter Olympus. Percy attacks Kronos, without either side gaining a significant advantage. In an Iris message-vision, the combatants are able to see Typhon approaching New York, only to be defeated with the aid of Poseidon and his cyclopes. Ethan Nakamura also rebels against Kronos's expectations but is killed. When Kronos attacks Annabeth, Luke is able to regain control of his body and, with Percy's help, he injures himself at his mortal point and successfully banishes Kronos to the void. As he dies, Luke tells Percy that Ethan had the right idea; the war was caused by the resentment of unrecognized gods and unclaimed children. He dies peacefully, and the Fates themselves carry his body away. The gods grant rewards to several heroes who were instrumental in defeating the Titans, including Thalia, Grover, Annabeth, Tyson, Clarisse, and Nico. Finally, Percy is called forward. Zeus offers him the greatest gift of all time: immortal godhood. Much to the Olympians' shock, Percy instead asks the gods to swear on the River Styx that they will claim all demigods by the time they turn thirteen, have cabins and thrones built for all minor gods and Hades, and give amnesty to innocent Titans and their former allies. Percy also relieves Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades of their oath to not have demigod children. After the meeting, Percy discovers Rachel plans to become the new Oracle, and he rushes to camp with Annabeth and Nico. With Apollo's supervision, Rachel safely becomes the new Oracle and speaks the next Great Prophecy. The novel ends shortly after Annabeth celebrates Percy's birthday and the two begin dating. The gods are keeping to their new promises, and Camp Half-Blood is slowly returning to normal. The many fallen demigods are honored with the end-of-summer's bead. Reception The New York Times called the novel \\"both exciting and entertaining.\\" While the review notes that the pace sometimes bordered on \\"frantic,\\" distracting from weaker plot points, the book as a whole remains \\"clever\\" and \\"enjoyably hair-raising.\\"Devereaux, Elizabeth (May 28, 2009). \\"The Gods Must Be Crazy.\\" NYTimes.com. Retrieved July 24, 2018. The non-profit Common Sense Media warned parents that this final book in the series contains more violence than the previous entries, but praised the book overall, giving it five out of five stars. Kirkus Reviews reviewed the book positively, observing that \\"Riordan masterfully orchestrates the huge cast of characters and manages a coherent, powerful tale at once exciting, philosophical and tear-jerking.\\" Main characters * Percy Jackson - The protagonist and narrator of Percy Jackson & the Olympians. He is aged fifteen in The Last Olympian, the son of Poseidon. Like Luke and Achilles he bathes in the River Styx and become invincible. He begins a romantic relationship with Annabeth Chase on his sixteenth birthday near the end of the book. * Luke Castellan - A 23-year-old demigod son of Hermes who willingly gave his body to Kronos out of hatred for the Olympian gods. Although he is an antagonist throughout the series, he sacrifices himself in order to destroy Kronos at the end of the book and is, in a way, the actual hero of the Great Prophecy. * Kronos - The former king of the Titans, bent on restoring his rule and taking revenge on the gods who deposed him. * Annabeth Chase - Daughter of Athena, Percy's close friend, and an aspiring architect. * Ethan Nakamura - An ally of Kronos and son of Nemesis, without whom Kronos's rise to power would not have been possible. Like Luke, he too feels betrayed by the Greek gods for their refusal to acknowledge his mother as a goddess equal in importance to the twelve Olympians. * Grover Underwood - Percy's best friend, a satyr, and a new member of the Council of Cloven Elders. He is also a kind of ambassador for the power of the god Pan in the world. * Thalia Grace - A daughter of Zeus and leader of a group of Artemis's followers, previously believed to be the demigod of the Great Prophecy. She is immortal but physically aged to nearly sixteen. * Nico di Angelo - A son of Hades who is instrumental in convincing his father, Demeter, and Persephone to fight against the Titans. * Charles Beckendorf and Silena Beauregard - A couple who both give their lives in defense of Olympus; Beckendorf's death at Luke's hands convinces Silena to renounce her role as Kronos's spy. They are the son of Hephaestus and the daughter of Aphrodite, respectively. * Clarisse La Rue - A daughter of Ares. At first, due to a disagreement with Apollo's cabin at Camp Half-Blood, she and her brethren refuse to fight in the war. Her friend Silena Beauregard's death, in part because of her refusal to fight, changes her mind. Sequel Another Camp Half-Blood series has been released, titled The Heroes of Olympus. The Lost Hero is the first book in this series by Riordan, and was released on October 12, 2010. Though it is not directly related to Percy and friends, there are many references and appearances of these characters and it still serves as a sequel. Its sequel, The Son of Neptune, portrays Percy as one of the main protagonists. The Son of Neptune is followed by The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades, and The Blood of Olympus.

It was found in 1960 by Nico Valentinus Franssen (1926-1979), a Dutch physicist and inventor. There are two classical experiments, which are related to the Franssen effect, called Franssen effect F1 and Franssen effect F2. Franssen effect F1 =Setup= There are two speakers to the left and right of the listener. Each is about 1 meter in distance from the listener, at approximately 45¬∞ angles. =Producing the illusion= The left speaker suddenly begins to produce a sharp pure tone. The two speakers are complementary to each other: i.e., as one increases, the other decreases. The left one is decreased exponentially, and the right speaker becomes the main source of the sound. The interesting illusion achieved here is that the listener perceives the sound as only coming from the left speaker, although the right speaker has been on most of the time. Franssen effect F2 =Experiment= Inside a room (auditorium) there are two loudspeakers at different positions. At the beginning of the presentation, loudspeaker 1 emits a pure tone with a steep attacking slope. Subsequently the power of this loudspeaker remains constant. The listeners can localize this loudspeaker easily. During the stationary part of the envelope the signal is very smoothly faded over from loudspeaker 1 to loudspeaker 2. Although loudspeaker 2 emits all the sound at the end, the listener's auditory events remain at the position of loudspeaker 1. This mislocalization remains, even if the test supervisor plugs off the cables of loudspeaker 1 demonstratively. =Conclusions= This effect gives some information about the capabilities of the human auditory system to localize sound sources in enclosed rooms:Slatky, Harald (1992): Algorithms for direction specific Processing of Sound Signals - the Realization of a binaural Cocktail-Party-Processor-System, Dissertation, Ruhr-University Bochum, chapter 8 * The human auditory system is able to localize a sound source in reverberant sound fields, if there are fast signal changes or signal onsets. (Loudspeaker 1 was correctly localized at the beginning of the experiment.) * The human auditory system is not able to localize signals with a constant amplitude and spectrum in reverberant sound fields. (The fade over to loudspeaker 2 was not recognized by the listeners.) * As long as no sound source can be localized, the direction of the last localized sound source remains as the perceived direction. (The auditory event remained at loudspeaker 1, although loudspeaker 2 emitted all the sound at the end of the experiment.) When looking at the sound, which arrives at the listener's ears, the following situation appears: * At the beginning of the experiment, when loudspeaker 1 started to emit sound, there was a short time period, where only the direct sound of loudspeaker 1 arrived at the listener's ears. In this time period the localization of loudspeaker 1 was surely possible, because it was not yet disturbed by wall reflections. * Some milliseconds later the sound of the wall reflections arrived and disturbed the localization of sound sources. * During the fade over the level and the spectrum of the emitted sound remained constant. This fade over was overlaid by many wall reflections from the sound situation before. Obviously no sound source localization was possible during this phase. * At the end, when only loudspeaker 2 emitted sound, the situation was quite similar, the sound of the wall reflections, which arrived simultaneously, prevented a localization of this sound source. As a consequence the auditory system seems only to be able to localize sound sources in reverberant environment at sound onsets or at bigger spectral changes. Then the direct sound of the sound source prevails at least in some frequency ranges and the direction of the sound source can be determined. Some milliseconds later, when the sound of the wall reflections arrives, a sound source localization seems no more to be possible. As long as no new localization is possible, the auditory systems seems to keep the last localized direction as perceived sound source direction.

Biography DeBatt was born to first generation Calabrian emigrant Mackie DeBatt in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn who grew up in the same neighborhood as future friends and criminal associates Sammy Gravano and Frank DeCicco. He had one sister named Rosanna DeBatt-Massa. He was very close to his sister over the years. Mackie is perceived to have been a \\"connected guy\\" with the Gambino crime family but never officially inducted into the organization. He performed various tasks for Sammy Gravano and others throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Mackie was the successful owner of Tali's Restaurant and Lounge located at 6205 18th Avenue in Gravesend, Brooklyn. It is also suggested that his father Mackie suffered from the psychological disorder of being a pathological gambling addict. DeBatt did not inherit his father's gambling addiction. Although he had a steady source of legitimate income from his restaurant, he became indebted to many loansharks and bookmakers around Brooklyn. It is also shown that Mackie was able to afford to pay for his son's tuition and send him off to university. After his death the mobsters started to threaten and muscle his wife to settle his outstanding debts. Although his father did not want his son to become involved in organized crime, DeBatt became a close childhood friend and acquaintance of budding Gambino crime family mob associate Nicholas Mormando, with whom he became involved in joint ventures after returning from his failed studies at Wake Forest University. Close friend, mob wife Lynda Milito, the widow of murdered Gambino crime family mobster Liborio Milito said in her biography, \\"Michael DeBatt wasn't being allowed to earn with Sammy. So Louis Milito took Mike under his wing and made him a bouncer at The Plaza Suite. He was a lost soul after the death of his father ... He told everyone he was taking over the bar out of the kindness in his heart for the family, because of the debts and by taking over he was wiping out the debts.\\" He later worked at a short-lived restaurant called The Golden Gate Restaurant on Knapp Street in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn as a ma√Ætre d', a restaurant owned by Sammy Gravano and Louis Milito. DeBatt was a huge and intimidating man. His life remained financially unstable, along with Sammy Gravano's until he took over ownership of his father's restaurant and settled his late father's loanshark and bookmaker debts. Sammy Gravano later said, \\"For one week he (himself) would be flush with cash, but two weeks later he would be broke. He never saved any money. He shopped for clothes, picked up tabs at restaurants and night clubs, handed out huge tips and dined on champagne and filet mignon at the Copacabana. Sammy later said of himself, Michael and his young aspiring mob associates, \\"Fucking kids, all dressed up like jerk-offs, running around, doing a little gambling, doing a little this and that \\"and then broke again and it's \\"macaroni and ricotta at home or spaghetti, past e olio, with the oil and garlic.\\" In the 1970s, DeBatt married an Italian-American woman after returning from university. They had a daughter in 1983. He moved into a home and lived with his wife and daughter at 1774 58th Street, not far from his restaurant and lounge, which he still operated. In 2001, when Sammy Gravano was brought to trial for being the ringleader of an ecstasy trafficking ring, his sister showed up in Federal District Court and told reporters, \\"I wanted to give him a little agita\\" and \\"I'm happy to see him in jail clothes. Anything he gets is a plus. It's better than the five years he got.\\" His father Mackie was a close friend of Sammy Gravano and Gambino crime family mob associate who became indebted to loansharks and bookmakers including and Sammy Gravano. Mackie died in December 1981 of natural causes leaving his wife, his son Michael and daughter Rosanna under financial strain and heavily indebted. His son Michael later stood up for his family and confronted the loansharks and bookmakers to protect his elderly mother and took on the sole responsibility of handling his late father's debts. Michael DeBatt's mother approached Sammy Gravano and pleaded with him, \\"Sammy, please help us.\\" His father's friend and later personal mentor, became involved in the DeBatt family financial affairs at that point. He got rid of the threatening loansharks and bookmakers. He took over Mackie's bar to help settle the debt that DeBatt still had outstanding with himself. Along with working at Tali's Restaurant and Lounge he worked as a bouncer at Sammy Gravano's classy nightclub, the Plaza Suite throughout the 1970s to 1985 when The Plaza Suite closed. Eventually with the help of Sammy Gravano and working on his own criminal endeavours, DeBatt was able to settle his father's outstanding debts to the loansharks and bookmakers.He closed the bar down and remodelled before opening it up as his own with Michael as the \\"front man\\" and manager of the lease. Michael DeBatt later became a habitu√© of Sammy Gravano's other after-hours club, the Bus Stop also located in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. He became a prot√©g√© of Gravano's along with Joseph (Stymie) D'Angelo Sr.'s son, Joseph Jr. =Varsity football career= DeBatt's physical stature, endurance and strength earned him the reputation as an excellent athlete. During high school, he was a varsity football player who showed tremendous skill on the field. Unlike many of his criminal associates he successfully graduated from high school and had been awarded an athletic scholarship to Wake Forest University in North Carolina to play for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team. The Wake Forest Demon Deacons is an NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. While at the university he was trained and coached by Chuck Mills. It seemed that DeBatt would pursue a career as a professional athlete and not become involved in organized crime like his father. He successfully played on the team for a while as a linebacker but eventually left before earning his certificate or diploma and returned to New York City where he pursued a life as a career criminal in organized crime like his father had. It is unknown why he left Wake Forest University, whether it was from financial, academic or behavioral issues. He never discussed his failed university education among his criminal associates. It is unknown what field of study Michael had interest in pursuing at the university. As an avid football fan he would attend the minor league football games played by Frank Gotti, the son of Gambino crime family boss John Gotti along with Junior Gotti, Victoria Gotti and Peter Gotti. =Married life and fatherhood= DeBatt married an Italian- American woman from the neighborhood in the 1970s after returning from his failed tenure at Wake Forest University. His wife bore him a daughter in 1984. He moved into a home and lived with his wife and daughter home at 1774 58th Street, not far from his restaurant and lounge which he still operated. In 1985 his marriage and Tali's Restaurant and Lounge began to suffer after DeBatt became addicted to cocaine and later crack cocaine. From the potent narcotic he fell into a paranoid schizoid state and did not want to go to work anymore. It is unknown if his wife knew about his addiction to cocaine and crack. He suffered from delusions that people were after him and he began to fear for his life and suffer from agoraphobia and hardly left his house at 1774 58th Street. At the trial of Sammy Gravano in 2003 his wife was too distraught to attend, along with her daughter. =Cocaine and crack addiction= Like his friend Nicholas Mormando, DeBatt became addicted to crack cocaine sometime during the Crack epidemic in 1984. He suffered from a paranoid psychosis brought on by the effects of the drugs. Gravano later surmised that his friend Nicholas Mormando got DeBatt addicted to the potent narcotic. He later became involved in murder and committing robberies to support his habit. He became estranged from his wife and children. Gravano later said, \\"He went crazy. He didn't come down for days. And when he does, he's sweating, he's all jumpy. His wife came to me (Gravano) crying, \\"I don't know what happened to him. He sits in the house behind a window with the blinds down, and he's got a rifle.\\" She also stated that he told her, \\"If they come, I'm gonna battle it out.\\" While Sammy Gravano and his crew did not approve of drug use, they did not have problems channeling the tasks of dealing to associates. It is unknown exactly who supplied Michael, or if it was Nicholas Mormando. =Career as a restaurateur= After his father died in 1981 he focused entirely on working on the restaurant business, taking over ownership management of his father's restaurant and working as the night-shift bartender. The restaurant would provide him with a legal means of income and keep him out of the public eye and being scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service for his illicit gains as a criminal. Tali's eventually became the main criminal headquarters for rising Gambino crime family capo Sammy Gravano in the mid-1970s until DeBatt's murder. After his murder, his sister sold the family's business. While the restaurant served as a meeting place and headquarters for the crew of then-capo Sammy Gravano and his associates, no murders were performed on the premises. In 1985 Tali's Restaurant and Lounge began to suffer after DeBatt started using drugs. He began to suffer from delusions that people were after him and began to fear for his life, always keeping a gun on him. To support his habit he began pulling home invasions. While this was well known to Sammy Gravano and fellow criminal associates he was never arrested or convicted of burglary. =The slaying of Frank Fiala= Frank Fiala was a drug trafficker and a powerful and wealthy Gambino crime family associate. He is not to be mistaken as a relative of Gambino crime family capo James Failla. He wanted to rent out The Plaza Suite to throw himself a birthday party. Fiala started to act very strange and unstable. He took DeBatt and other Plaza Suite employees on rides on his private Lear jet. He was in the nightclub all the time, consuming cocaine in large quantities and handing out bags of cocaine to patrons of the club. At one point in time, DeBatt confronted Fiala who at the time was armed with an Uzi submachine gun and told him calmly and politely that there were no firearms allowed inside the nightclub. Later to keep a close observation of Fiala, Gravano told DeBatt to keep a close eye on him. He told DeBatt to get closer to Fiala and told him that he wanted to continue working as a bouncer after Fiala purchased the Plaza Suite, and told him Gravano always underpaid him. Fiala later told DeBatt in confidence, \\"Fuck this Sammy. Fuck this punk. When I take over, I'm doing this, that.\\" After Fiala waved an Uzi at Gravano, Sammy was so enraged that he wanted him murdered immediately on June 27, 1982. He instructed Edward Garafola to round up Joseph D'Angelo, Liborio (Louie) Milito, Joseph Paruta, Thomas (Huck) Carbonaro, Nicholas Mormando and himself and rendezvous at D'Angelo's bar, Doc's. Sammy stationed his fellow associates in locations outside The Plaza Suite ready to ambush Fiala. To not arouse suspicion from Fiala or anyone in his group of partiers, DeBatt stayed positioned at the front door of the club maintaining the ruse of being a bouncer. At a prearranged signal from DeBatt, Joseph D'Angelo and Louis Milito leaped out from where they sat in a parked car at the corner around from the club on 86th Street and shot him. As Louis and Joseph D'Angelo heard Sammy Gravano call out his name, they ran out of the alley shooting. After the shooting, pandemonium broke out on the street. Some people were trying to get off the street and back into the disco in fear of being shot. DeBatt stood by the door and acted like he was one of the panicking party goers yelling, \\"Get down! Get down! Somebody's shooting\\". He held the door shut so nobody could get in or out of the Plaza Suite. When interviewed by homicide detectives DeBatt told them that he did not know who owned the Plaza Suite and had never seen or met the owners in person. Gravano congratulated DeBatt, his friend Nicholas Mormando and the others on a \\"beautiful piece of work.\\" Since this was not a sanctioned murder by their boss Paul Castellano, it could not go down that Mormando could be eligible to become a \\"made man\\" in the Gambino crime family for his involvement. He was never indicted or convicted for being accessory to the murder of Frank Fiala. After the murder of Fiala, Castellano was angry. He had DeBatt, Mormando and the others stay up at his New Jersey farm to lie low. After hearing the news that Castellano might order their executions over the unsanctioned murder, when given the chance by Sammy to leave, DeBatt and the others all said, \\"Sammy, we'll load up. We're ready.\\" This shows that Michael displayed extreme devotion in following Gravano even when his own life was threatened. The murder of Fiala was never solved until Sammy Gravano became a stool pigeon and testified in court on the murder during the trial of John Gotti. =The murder of Nicholas Mormando= Sammy Gravano would later say about DeBatt's childhood friend and acquaintance, Nicholas Mormando: DeBatt continued to serve in the crew of Sammy Gravano after Mormando's murder. He continued to work with his friend's executioners until his own murder in 1987. It is thought that he was so far plagued by the effects of consuming copious amounts of cocaine and crack cocaine that he did not care. =Falling out with Gravano crew and murder= Regarding the pinnacle of DeBatt's drug addictions, Gravano stated: Gravano hoped that as a result, nobody would think the murder was related to the Gambino crime family or organized crime in general. After a Mafia family wedding, Michael had gone back to Tali's with Thomas Carbonaro and Eddie Garafola, expecting the wedding party to join them as usual. \\"But the only ones who went back there were four murderers\\", says his sister Rosanna. Thomas (Huck) Carbonaro shot Michael while he was stationed behind the bar counter at Tali's. He was shot several times in the head and neck with a handgun on November 3, 1987. He left behind a wife and several children. Michael's lifeless body was found face up on the floor in front of the restaurant's juke box by the night shift manager who was coming in to work. His pockets were emptied, his jewellery removed and the cash register cleaned out. Police investigators stated that while DeBatt had no criminal record, he was reputed to have associated with members of the Gambino crime family. Sammy's brother-in-law Eddie Garafola and Louis Vallario were present when the murder was fulfilled. Gravano waited at The Brown Derby, in Brooklyn with John Gotti when Edward came in and advised them both that the murder of Michael DeBatt had been carried out. His murder remained unsolved until Sammy Gravano agreed to become an informer and testify against John Gotti to avoid prosecution for numerous crimes. He was the thirteenth victim of nineteen that Gravano confessed to the authorities of having orchestrated their murder or personally carried it out. In 1982 Gravano's close friend and criminal associate Joseph (Stymie) D'Angelo, who helped DeBatt murder Frank Faila would be murdered in the same restaurant. Before the murder of DeBatt, Gravano arranged to have Nicholas (Nicky Boy) Mormando murdered for the same reasons. He had become heavily addicted to crack cocaine among other things, and was a liability to become a stool pigeon like DeBatt. In fifteen years since the murder of Michael, no one has been formally charged with the murder. He is survived by a wife and daughter who was four years old at the time of his death. Wrongful death suit In November 1998, a wrongful death suit was filed by the surviving relatives of Michael, Nicholas Mormando, and Joseph Colucci. According to court documents Sammy Gravano admitted to playing a direct or indirect role in their murders in the plea agreement that he made with the government when agreeing to become an informant. Along with Gravano, DeBatt's family and the others filed suits against the author of his autobiography Peter Maas, Maas' literary agency I.C.M., the publisher of the autobiography, Harper Collins, and 20th Century Fox that was allegedly preparing a film adaptation of the book. In the complaint it stated that the plaintiffs were seeking, \\"\\"monetary and punitive damages from all defendants for their intentional failure to comply with New York's Son of Sam Law ... and their deliberate scheme to circumvent same.\\" Previously during the spring of 1997, the State Crime Victims Board and State Attorney General Dennis Vacco launched a similar lawsuit against Sammy Gravano and many of the same co- defendants during their criminal trial. Reputed haunted murder location Tali's Restaurant and Lounge, later went under new management and became Danza's. The bullet marks left from the DeBatt and D'Angelo gangland slaying still remain in the restaurant's brick wall as of 2008. In the March 10, 2002 issue of The New York Post, it was reported that the current restaurant owners and staff have witnessed figures seated at tables or heading down to the restaurant's basement, but then the mysterious figures vanish. These are allegedly the ghosts of DeBatt and Joseph D'Angelo. They also report hearing voices and the sound of a chainsaw. They say they can smell foul odors and they had the feeling that they were being watched by someone. A cousin of the current restaurant owner, Angela Perrone stated, \\"The place is definitely haunted. There's a creepiness, as if someone's always watching you. It's a sinister energy.\\" Perrone called in Frances Bennett, a parapsychologist. She conducted interviews with all the staff, and set up infrared video cameras, tape recorders and an electro-magnetic field meter for four hours to observe these mysterious happenings. Bennett said her probe recorded voices of the dead, repeating the name \\"Mike\\" and saying, \\"I'll kill you.\\" A man's face reflected in glass at the bar and another image seen at the entrance, an apparition of a man crouched down near the bar, and orbs of light said to be \\"a sign of individual spirits\\" moving around the restaurant along with tablecloths fluffing up and dropping back down on their own. Roseanne Massa has told reporters that she believes her brother may be haunting Danza's because Gravano spent less than five years in jail after confessing to orchestrating his gangland execution and eighteen others as part of a deal with federal prosecutors for testifying against Gambino crime family mob boss John Gotti. In popular culture Michael DeBatt and the gangland slaying of DeBatt are mentioned briefly in the made for television HBO movie Gotti, but DeBatt is never actually seen in the film. In the NBC miniseries Witness to the Mob Mickey DeBatt is portrayed by actor Vincent Pastore. In this movie they do not show his relationship with Nicholas Mormando.

In recognition of these services and to ensure continuation of the Portuguese nobility the titles of Duke de Laf√µes and Marquis de Arronches were created. Following the death of D. Jo√£o Carlos de Bragan√ßa e Ligne de Sousa Tavares Mascarenhas da Silva (1719-1806), 2¬∫ Duke de Laf√µes e 8¬∫ Count de Miranda do Corvo, his eccentric, hedonistic life and his spending habits led to sale of most of the family's properties and goods. Following payment of family debts, the title fell into disuse due to stigma associated with it, as well as the creation of the Portuguese Republic which ended legal recognition of titles of nobility. Recent usage Following an extensive review of the history of the Miranda/Tavares clan by the family the title has been brought back into usage by the present holder, D. Aires Manuel Tavares Marques, 10¬∫ Marquis de Arronches, as well as his mother, Dowager Countess Isabel Miranda. Aires is a senior civil servant at the Ministry of Defence, following in the footsteps of his father, a former commander in the Portuguese Air Force who died in an airplane crash during his son's youth. Although the title has not been formally recognised by the Duke of Braganza, due to dispute over the Dukes' authority to do so, the title has been used informally by the family for certain purposes. The direct heir to the title (as D. Aires has two daughters but no sons) is found in D. Paulo Augusto Tavares Milhinhos, Visconde de Miranda de Corvo, who is a first cousin of D.Aires. He has made it known that he intends to cede his right to this title in favour of his only son, D. Pedro Miguel Vasques Milhinhos, therefore making him D.Aires' direct successor. Born in May 1996, D. Pedro Miguel is the first heir presumptive to the Marquis de Arronches and the Count de Miranda de Corvo titles who does not have Miranda or Tavares in his surname (both of which are the original names of the family). Following completion of his studies in Portugal and at Harrow School in London, D. Pedro Miguel has undertaken study at the University of Leeds and the London School of Economics in the United Kingdom. Successors ;Titleholders/heirs # D.

The story, told by a struggling writer and set among the expatriate community in 1920s Paris, deals with a failed sculptor named Beano Walsh, who claims he cannot create his art since the anatomy books are all wrong. Plot summary The narrator, a struggling writer, knows that to be accepted among American expatriates in Paris in the 1920s, he has to exhibit a certain madness. Since all the obvious forms of craziness have become pass√©, he decides to exaggerate normality: He is an instant hit and gets invited to all the parties. At one event he meets Beano Walsh, who worked on a coal barge in the East River before he got a scholarship from Oscar Hahn to study sculpture in Paris. Since the narrator is broke, Beano invites him to live in his studio, which he shares with a Belgian prostitute who was left by the previous tenant. Beano constantly fails at drawing, which sends him into a rage, until he decides to work straight from marble, but fails at that too, smashing a whole truckload in frustration. He studies many anatomy books, but is unable to replicate the images and so destroys them and goes on a binge. An impending visit by one of Hahn's scouts to check on Beano's progress troubles him and he resolves to present an explanation for his inability to create: he argues all the anatomy books are wrong because they all used models that were five foot ten or less, while the ideal modern man is six feet tall. Beano's solution is to create a new book, and he begins frequenting the morgue in search of a perfect model. One night, as the narrator and three friends sit among the Americans at the Dome, Beano pulls up in a cab and excitedly tells them he has found his perfect specimen, the corpse of a sailor, which he has brought with him, wrapped in brown paper. The group goes up to the cab to look and are repulsed while Beano boasts loudly, causing a crowd to gather, and tears at the paper until the body is naked. A woman trying to get into the cab sees the corpse and screams, causing policemen to come over. Beano knocks one of the policemen into the gutter and is taken away with the corpse, with the narrator and their friends in tow. At the station Beano is brought before a magistrate and claims he was defending his property, refusing to be separated from the corpse and claiming that to do so would impede the progress of art. The magistrate is amused and says that he, like all the French, loves art and would not stand in its way, and sends Beano to his cell with the corpse. He also instructs the narrator to inform Hahn's agent, and send drawing paper. The narrator calls the agent who promises to bring a French lawyer to the trial. A crowd gathers for the trial, and the narrator accompanies the turnkey and a few others to fetch Beano. At first they don't see anyone in the cell, and the turnkey sounds the alarm. They find the corpse torn and broken, with one arm skinned, lying on a bench and the floor covered with Beano's crude drawings of the arm. They finally find Beano huddled under the bench with his face to the wall. He won't move or speak and the turnkey and cops have to drag him out. The narrator thinks Beano winks at him, but isn't sure. Beano isn't arraigned and sent to a hospital in the country by Hahn's agent. The narrator visits him a week later, but can't get him to speak, and goes to the doctor in charge to tell him that Beano is only pretending to be crazy to fool the police. The doctor says that he thought so at first too, but later decided that Beano is truly insane, but since he knew it all along he was able to control what he showed the outside world, until he finally went too far. On the train back to Paris, the narrator suspects that the doctor himself might be crazy, but later decides he must have been right since Beano is still in an asylum.West, Nathanael. Novels & Other Writings. Ed. Sacvan Bercovitch. New York: The Library of America, 1997. pages 411-424. Early versions The story was discovered among West's papers after his death in two typescript versions. The first is 22 pages long and was originally titled \\"The Fake,\\" then retitled \\"L'Affaire Beano\\"; the second, an incomplete revision of the first version, is 14 pages long and was titled \\"L'Affaire Beano\\" before being retitled \\"The Imposter.\\" The published version is made up of the revised second typescript, with the conclusion from the original typescript.West, page 816. Links to West's life and other works Though West spent a few weeks in Paris in 1926 and met various artists and writers including Max Ernst and Henry Miller, he would later claim that he had in fact lived in poverty there for several years, much like the narrator of this story. The specific \\"madness\\" the narrator tries to feign by exaggerating normality is also similar to West's perceived persona while he was a student at Brown University, where he often wore Brooks Brothers suits and was considered a \\"dandy\\" by his schoolmates.West, pages 804-805. The theme of failure, which appears in all of West's novels and seems to infect all of his protagonists, occurs here as well. All of West's characters, including Beano Walsh, fail consistently and regularly, as in the short story \\"Western Union Boy\\", where the title implies a certain class of people who cannot help but fail: \\"What they are doing is failing, mechanically, yet desperately and seriously, they are failing. The mechanical part of it is very important.\\"West, page 425. The twin themes of art and the deception which may lay at its core link this story to The Dream Life of Balso Snell, where the title character comes across countless artists and writers, who try to present themselves a certain way but may all be charlatans.

Mining by Europeans began in the latter half of the 19th century. New Zealand has abundant resources of coal, silver, iron ore, limestone and gold. It ranked 22 in the world in terms of iron ore production and 29th in gold production. The total value of mineral production in New Zealand was $1.5 billion in 2006 (excluding oil and gas). The most important metallic minerals produced are gold (10.62 tonnes), silver (27.2 tonnes) and titanomagnetite ironsand (2.15 million tonnes). A 2008 report estimated that the unexploited resources of just seven core minerals (including gold, copper, iron and molybdenum) totalled around $140 billion in worth. The mining sector makes a significant contribution to the New Zealand economy. In 2004 the value of production from mining (excluding oil and gas) was $1,142 million, or just under 1% of gross domestic product. In 2017 mining contributed $3,079m (1.3%) to a GDP of $235,945m. In 2009 there were 6,800 people employed directly in mining, and 8,000 people, indirectly, flowing from the economic activity of the 6,800. The median wage for a mining employee was $57,320 in 2008, compared to the New Zealand median of $33,530. In 2017 mining employed 5,300 (0.2%), out of a total workforce of 2,593,000. In 2015 miners' earnings average hourly earnings were $39.86 and median hourly earnings $31.33, though the number of miners had fallen to 6,300, compared to nationwide figures of $27.49, $22.92 and 2,004,100 (3%). These figures may though need to be treated with caution, as miners appear to have been earning 5% of total income (average earnings x employees), though GDP contribution in 2015 was only 1.6%. The latter decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century saw opposition to mining on environmental grounds. The Crown Minerals Act 1991 is a major piece of legislation relating to mining, and a review of Schedule 4 of the Act provoked considerable controversy late in the first decade of the 2000s. Gold mining in Otago History Iron made from Taranaki ironsand was displayed at The Great Exhibition, London in 1851. In 1865, the Alpha well was drilled near Mikotahi at New Plymouth. This was the first oil well in what is now the Commonwealth and one of the first in the world. A petroleum industry developed at Moturoa, including producing wells and refineries. The last refinery there was closed in 1972. Resources =Coal= New Zealand Coal Production, 1878 - 2014. Coal mining produced almost 4 million tonnes of coal in 2014, of which 44% was exported. In 2016 it was down to 2,834,956 tonnes. New Zealand coal reserves are in excess of 15 billion tonnes, mainly in Waikato, Taranaki, West Coast, Otago and Southland. Over 80% of the reserves are in Southland lignite deposits worth $100 billion. Coal is produced from four underground and 21 opencast mines. The largest coal mining company was Solid Energy, a state-owned enterprise. =Gold= Gold rush tents and digs in Gabriel Gully, Clutha District, Otago, 1862. Prospectors discovered gold in the Coromandel Peninsula in 1852, sparking the Coromandel Gold Rush, the Otago Gold Rush and the West Coast Gold Rush in the 1860s. Initially alluvial gold was recovered, but then mining for gold in quartz veins which was recovered using stamper batteries took over. From the 1890s Otago rivers were dredged for gold, using New Zealand-developed floating dredges.Dredging for Gold from Te Ara, Encyclopaedia of New Zealand Mining for gold has a long history in areas like the Coromandel Peninsula. Up to 2003 an estimated 998.71 tonnes of gold had been mined in New Zealand, a little under one percent all the gold mined worldwide. Available figures suggest that to that time a minimum of 312 tonnes had come from the Coromandel Peninsula, 274 tonnes from the West Coast, and 265 tonnes from Otago. Production peaked in 1866 at some 22.9 tonnes.\\"NZ Gold History ,\\" New Zealand Gold Merchants Ltd., retrieved 5 February 2014. Gold worth $250M in 2006 was produced from two large hard-rock mines (Martha Mine and Macraes Mine), several medium-sized alluvial operations, and a large number of small alluvial mines. =Ironsands= The Waikato North Head ironsand mine produces up to 1.2 million tonnes of ironsand a year, for use in the New Zealand Steel mill at Glenbrook. The deposit is estimated to contain more than 150 million tonnes in total. Rather more is produced at TahƒÅroa, all of which is exported. Environmental issues Environmental issues with mining include acid mine drainage and large scale modifications to landscapes. Acid mine drainage from coal mining is a serious problem in New Zealand. It is estimated to adversely affect 125 kilometres of streams mainly in the Buller District of the West Coast Region of the South Island. There has been very little remediation of acid mine drainage. Regulation of AMD has been vague and enforcement is lacking. AMD from mines that were established before the Resource Management Act 1991 has been allowed to continue. The Tui mine in the Kaimai Range which closed in 1973 is considered one of the worst toxic waste sites in New Zealand and the government has allocated almost $10 million for cleaning up the site. Structural failure of historic underground mine workings have led to subsidence, cracking and collapse on properties in Waihi, a township that has built up around the current open pit. The Stockton Mine on the West Coast of the South Island, has historically been responsible for acid mine drainage in adjoining waterways, and has since built a comprehensive water treatment plant on the Stockton plateau. Stockton poses a threat to some native species, although has carried out significant biodiversity conservation work in the region, and mountaintop removal mining has happened on the site in recent years. Over a one hundred-year period Mount Smart in Auckland was mined to such an extent that it is now level with the surrounding land. Several other Auckland volcanoes have suffered a similar fate. In 2011 arsenic laden soil was discovered in the suburb of Moanataiari in Thames. The area had been reclaimed from the Firth of Thames using mine tailings, mine waste and rubble. Funding from the government was given towards the cost of soil testing. New frontiers Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is attracting funding in the billions of dollars as part of global efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions. CCS may well have a vital role to play in the portfolio of technologies to be deployed. The New Zealand Government is a partner with the Australian Government in the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) for research to support commercial-scale CCS. However, in the New Zealand context, University of Canterbury researchers authored a 2009 paper on CCS published in the peer-reviewed journal Energy Policy. The paper considered the permanence of CO2 storage was uncertain and that CCS was unlikely to significantly reduce carbon emissions. The paper concluded that further investment in CCS was seriously questionable as a policy. Coal Seam Gas (CSG) is a form of natural gas occurring naturally in deep coal seams that could potentially add to New Zealand's gas supply. In 2008, Solid Energy trialled CSG extraction at the Waikato coal fields, for use in electricity generation. Deep-sea metallic mineral deposits in the Kermadec volcanic arc are attracting research into how they are formed and how they influence the surrounding undersea biodiversity. Mineral-rich fluids coming out of seafloor hot springs contact cold sea water and precipitate out high-grade ore deposits containing gold, copper, lead, zinc, iron, manganese and other metals. In one sense, these are renewable resources because they are constantly being formed. Discovering these deposits is one matter; mining them in an economic and environmentally appropriate way is another. Extraction of these resources is viewed as a long-term prospect. A proposal for the protection of part of the Kermadec volcanoes is being developed by the Pew Environmental Group. Geothermal energy is experiencing a renaissance in New Zealand. This renewable source of energy could contribute to 20% of New Zealand's electricity needs after the next decade. Current research led by the GNS Science and the University of Auckland is tipped to enable cheaper geothermal energy, and identify new systems in the Central North Island for development. Ironsands offshore of New Zealand from Northland south to Whanganui, and off the South Island's West Coast is estimated to hold some billions of tonnes of titanomagnetite resource. Titanium and vanadium are the main by-products. The resource is in the stage of being prospected and explored, and assessed for its economic potential. Low-temperature geothermal energy can be used potentially for space heating, hot pools, heat pumps in the home, heating greenhouses and aquaculture. The heat may be sourced from hot spring systems, disused petroleum wells, heated waters in flooded underground coal and mineral mines, heat in underground aquifers, and heat in rocks. Research in this field in New Zealand is led by GNS Science. Methane hydrates (fire ice) are a crystalline form of methane trapped in water, occurring in deep-water continental shelf sediments in many parts of the world, including New Zealand. This resource may furnish a future source of natural gas. Work is underway in New Zealand to determine economically viable deposits, and technologies for safe extraction. In New Zealand, methane hydrates are found in shallower waters than elsewhere in the world. Underground coal gasification (UCG) is a way of accessing energy from coal deposits that lie too deep underground or are too dangerous to be mined or are otherwise uneconomic. Air, oxygen or steam is injected at high temperatures, to burn the coal underground. Separate wells are drilled to capture the resulting \\"coal gas\\" which is in essence a form of natural gas. When combined with CCS, this offers a low-emissions route to generating electricity from coal. Opposition Denniston The Coromandel Watchdog lobby group has been active in lobbying against gold mining on the Coromandel Peninsula since the 1970s. It has recently begun to work against proposals to restart mining in some areas of the Coromandel Peninsula which have been off-limits to mining for a long time, and has argued that any claim of \\"surgical\\" mining operations being possible is farcical, when one realises that even for such mining, roads would have to be built into the areas, ore processing plants constructed, as well as tailings and chemical byproducts of the ore separation process disposed of. Sand mining from both beaches and the seabed has encountered opposition. Kiwis Against Seabed Mining, an environmental lobby group, formed when plans were revealed for the mining of the seabed off the West Coast of the North Island. There are numerous coal mines on the West Coast of the South Island. The Cypress Mine, planned for the Westport area, is opposed by the Save Happy Valley Coalition due to effects on landscape values, biodiversity and climate change. A speech by the Minister for Economic Development Gerry Brownlee to the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy in August 2009 provoked a reaction from environmental groups. In the speech Brownlee announced a review of Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act. The Schedule lists conservation land such as national parks and reserves as off-limits to mining. Advocacy for the NZ resource sector In 2008 a number of mainly gold and coal producing companies in New Zealand set up Straterra, an incorporated society, to provide a collective voice for the NZ resource sector. Staterra's members and affiliates represent 88% of the value of NZ production of all minerals, except oil & gas and geothermal resources. Straterra also works closely with the petroleum sector and has links to the geothermal sector. Straterra participates in government policy processes, carries out government and industry relations, and provides advocacy for the NZ resource sector including via the media. A key focus for the NZ resource sector is to promote mature, well-informed debate on mineral and energy issues. Straterra believes that properly managed and encouraged the NZ resource sector can make a significant contribution to the New Zealand economy, and can be managed in environmentally responsible ways, with the passing of the Resource Management Act and the Crown Minerals Act in 1991. Accidents In earlier years, coal mining had a high rate of injuries and death, most of them individual deaths. Between just 1900 and 1914 there were 141 men killed, of which 98 were individual deaths. The largest-scale accidents are: * 21 February 1879, Kaitangata coal mine disaster, 34 miners died when candles caused an underground explosion * 26 March 1896, Brunner coal mine disaster, 65 miners killed by an explosion or by poisonous gases following the explosion. As of 2017 this is New Zealand's largest death toll from an industrial accident. * 12 September 1914, Ralph Mine, Huntly, a naked light caused an explosion that killed 43 coal miners * 3 December 1926, Dobson coal mine, nine killed due to an explosion * 24 September 1939, Glen Afton coal mine, Huntly, 11 asphyxiated by carbon monoxide * 19 January 1967, Strongman coal mine, 19 miners killed by explosion * 19 November 2010, Pike River mine accident, 29 dead Mining towns =Current= *Huntly *Rotowaro *Waihi *Ohai *Kaitangata *Ross *Whangarei *Stockton, New Zealand *Nightcaps, New Zealand =Historic= *Brunner *Denniston *Lawrence *Lyell *Millerton *Okarito *Reefton *Thames *Waiuta See also *Waihi miners' strike *Oil and gas industry in New Zealand *Hydraulic fracturing in New Zealand References Further reading  * External links *Coal and Coal Mining - Te Ara; The Encyclopedia of New Zealand *Gold and Gold Mining - Te Ara; The Encyclopedia of New Zealand *New Zealand Petroleum & Minerals (NZP&M;) *New Zealand Petroleum & Minerals - Web map of minerals mining permits *Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment - Minerals page *Straterra - Natural Resources of New Zealand *Paydirt - New Zealand gold mining permits map page *Permit Watch - Service for monitoring minerals mining permits issued by NZP&M; ","title":"Mining in New Zealand"},{"id":"20007545","title":"Pennsylvania House of Representatives, District 75"},{"id":"20007569","text":"Tuaheni Point is a promontory on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand.

Entered as a candidate to become the SHA-3 standard, the successor of SHA-1 and SHA-2, it ultimately lost to NIST hash candidate Keccak. The name Skein refers to how the Skein function intertwines the input, similar to a skein of yarn.  History  Skein was created by Bruce Schneier, Niels Ferguson, Stefan Lucks, Doug Whiting, Mihir Bellare, Tadayoshi Kohno, Jon Callas and Jesse Walker. Skein is based on the Threefish tweakable block cipher compressed using Unique Block Iteration (UBI) chaining mode, a variant of the Matyas‚ÄìMeyer‚ÄìOseas hash mode,http://www.skein-hash.info/sites/default/files/skein1.3.pdf p. 6 while leveraging an optional low-overhead argument-system for flexibility.

Source code author: Doug Whiting, 2008. This algorithm and source code is released to the public domain.\\"  Functionality  Skein supports internal state sizes of 256, 512 and 1024 bits, and arbitrary output sizes. The authors claim 6.1 cycles per byte for any output size on an Intel Core 2 Duo in 64-bit mode.Paper describing the hash function, Version 1.3 (2010-10-01) The core of Threefish is based on a MIX function that transforms 2 64-bit words using a single addition, rotation by a constant and XOR. The UBI chaining mode combines an input chaining value with an arbitrary length input string and produces a fixed size output. Threefish's nonlinearity comes entirely from the combination of addition operations and exclusive-ORs; it does not use S-boxes. The function is optimized for 64-bit processors, and the Skein paper defines optional features such as randomized hashing, parallelizable tree hashing, a stream cipher, personalization, and a key derivation function. Cryptanalysis In October 2010, an attack that combines rotational cryptanalysis with the rebound attack was published. The attack finds rotational collisions for 53 of 72 rounds in Threefish-256, and 57 of 72 rounds in Threefish-512. It also affects the Skein hash function. This is a follow-up to the earlier attack published in February, which breaks 39 and 42 rounds respectively. The Skein team tweaked the key schedule constant for round 3 of the NIST hash function competition, to make this attack less effective, even though they believe the hash would still be secure without these tweaks.

It is also used to treat tinnitus in India. Chemically, it is a quinoxalinedione and is available in both a base and hydrochloric acid forms. Pharmacologically, it has been described as a nonspecific calcium channel blocker and as an antagonist of both non-NMDA and NMDA glutamate receptors. It was discovered in Austria in the 1950s and was developed by Austrian company Phafag AG. Its INN name, caroverine, was proposed in 1972. An intravenous formulation was tested in a single-blinded study in tinnitus that published in 1997 and had positive results; an effort to replicate those results failed to show any effect, and more people had their condition worsen than experienced benefit. Pilot studies using a spray formulation for tinnitus published in 2005. In 2010 Phafag licensed rights to caroverine to the Indian company, Lincoln Pharmaceuticals, to develop the drug for tinnitus in India. Lincoln first marketed it for that purpose in India in 2011. As of 2016 it had been studied in a small clinical trial in people with loss of the sense of smell. As of 2018 it was marketed under the brand names Spasmium and Tinnitin in Austria, and under the brand Tinnex in India.

Alverine is a smooth muscle relaxant. Smooth muscle is a type of muscle that is not under voluntary control; it is the muscle present in places such as the gut and uterus. Adverse effects The side effects of alverine include: *Difficulties in breathing or shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the face or other parts of the body (associated with serious allergic reaction *Yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin, due to liver inflammation * A feeling of nausea or dizziness * Headache * Minor allergic reaction (skin rash/itching) It was reported that alverine may induce toxic hepatitis. Mechanism of action Alverine acts directly on the muscle in the gut, causing it to relax. This prevents the muscle spasms which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Diverticular disease is a condition in which small pouches form in the gut lining. These pouches can trap particles of food and become inflamed and painful. In irritable bowel syndrome, the normal activity of the gut muscle is lost. The muscle spasms result in symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating, constipation or diarrhoea. By relaxing the gut muscle, alverine citrate relieves the symptoms of this condition. Alverine also relaxes the smooth muscle in the womb (uterus). It is therefore also used to treat painful menstruation, which is caused by muscle spasms in the uterus (dysmenorrhea). Alverine capsules are now available in the market. There are two strengths of capsule - 60 mg and 120 mg. The common dosage for adults and children over 12 years is 60‚Äì120 mg taken one, two or three a day, either before or after meals. Alverine is not suitable for those aged under 12 years. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should follow the instruction of doctors for the drug. Development and marketing A combination of alverine citrate and simeticone (ACS) has been combined for irritable bowel syndrome therapy, relating to safety and efficacy in the Clinical Trial Phase IV. At week 4, alverine citrate and simeticone group had lower VAS scores of abdominal pain‚ÅÑdiscomfort (median: 40 mm vs. 50 mm, P = 0.047) and higher responder rate (46.8% vs. 34.3%, OR = 1.3; P = 0.01) as compared with the placebo group.

The two have traditionally been placed in the genus Garrulax. It is a medium-sized bird with a strong bill and legs and a fairly long tail. It is 24‚Äì25 cm long with a bill length of 25‚Äì27 mm, a wing length of 83‚Äì92 mm and a tail length of 88‚Äì100 mm. It is mostly plain brown apart from an orange stripe over the eye, a black throat and an orange breast with black streaks. It has a loud, melodious song. The spot-breasted laughingthrush is similar but has a pale throat and breast with dark spots and a pale stripe above the eye. It is endemic to Vietnam where it occurs in the Da Lat Plateau in southern Annam. It inhabits montane forest between 915 and 1510 m above sea-level and can survive in degraded habitats such as secondary forest and cultivated land close to forested areas. It is most often seen in pairs. Although it only has a small range, it appears to be tolerant of habitat degradation and is classed as Least Concern by BirdLife International.

It is now abandoned and considered a ghost Located 58 km north of Greymouth and 21 km south of Reefton in Ikamatua, New Zealand, it was the site of a gold mine until 1951 when the collapse of the mine made it uneconomic. A number of buildings remain and there are still residents in what remains of the town. Nowadays Waiuta has become a tourist attraction, with few of the original buildings still intact that include the former police station, three cottages and the old barber shop.  History  Blackwater Mine bush railway The town of Waiuta was developed to provide accommodation for workers in the goldmine. The Birthday Quartz Reef was named after the date it was found: 9 November 1905 was King Edward VII‚Äôs birthday . The first mineshaft operated in 1908 called the Blackwater Shaft and was 563 m in depth. The mine was extended in 1926 with the acquisition of the adjacent Blackwater North claim, which was renamed the Prohibition. The Prohibition shaft took over in 1938 and reached 879 m deep. The mine eventually produced almost 750,000 ounces of gold. Because of the expansion of the mine, more workers began to settle in the area. At first, people kept wanting to rent houses as they were unsure how long the mine was last. However, when the mine was well established by the early 1920s, workers were more willing to build houses and own shops. The area had eventually turned from a mine to a prosperous, growing town. Waiuta started to look less like a mining camp. Even though Waiuta had few residents, many people enjoyed playing outdoor sports, with rugby being the main sport.  Prospering Town  By 1936, there was a record 601 people living in Waiuta. Of those, many were from other countries, like Yugoslavia, Italy and Australia. It was in that year that the town had become the most ethnically diverse, more than most other parts of New Zealand. By 1910, a miners' hall was built, for social gatherings and meetings. Waiuta‚Äôs first school was also built, and by 1933, there was a total of 113 children. The last major building to be built was the cottage hospital in 1916.  Sudden Decline  The Second World War triggered a gradual decline in the number of miners. Between 1939 and 1946, men employed by the company fell from 240 to 113. The amount of gold eventually reduced to less than one third of the pre-war amount, making it difficult to recruit miners after the war. On July 9, 1951 the Blackwater Shaft collapsed and the flooded mine was abandoned. With no alternative employment in Waiuta, many people left to settle elsewhere. Buildings were dismantled, and within a couple of months Waiuta became a ghost town, with nothing to offer.  Waiuta Today  Nowadays, Waiuta is managed as a historic site for many tourists to visit, as very few buildings still remain. Waiuta offers overnight stays at the Waiuta lodge, where families can stay for as long as they wish. Tour guides are part of a group called ‚ÄúFriends of Waiuta‚Äù which was formed in 1985 to teach tourists the town‚Äôs history, ecology of the area, and promote it as a tourist destination. They work with the Department of Conservation who manage the historic town and gold mines. The group includes over 120 working members and holds meetings three times a year. In 2020 Whispers of Gold: a tale of boom and bust and a West Coast Town that refused to die, a documentary film about Waiuta was released. On 13 December 2019 it A $15 million commercial loan was announced the NZ government to Tasman Mining from the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) to re-establish the Blackwater gold mine.

In September 1998 the Chief inspector of Prisons issued a report warning that Eastwood Park Prison was keeping a number of inmates in cells that were below the nationally recommended standard size.https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60864766 In May 2002 a further inspection of Eastwood Park found that inmates were at serious risk of suicide and self-harm. Referring to Eastwood as \\"an establishment in crisis\\", the inspection report noted that staff were having trouble creating decent conditions for its inmates, among whom 56 women had been identified as suicide risks in a single month. In that same month, the report said, 47 separate cases of self-harm had occurred. A further report in March 2004 stated that the prison was still facing \\"major challenges\\". However the report also noted that prisoners felt safer at Eastwood Park than in women's prisons generally. On 24 December 2014, it was announced that Prisoners are being allowed to smoke e-cigarettes as part of a pilot scheme that could lead to a jail smoking ban. The e-cigarette brand, Bull, is available in the prison shop in the jail and in other prison shops in the men's prisons HMP Preston in Lancashire and HMP Stocken in Rutland. In May 2016 Jessica Whitchurch killed herself in Eastwood Park Prison. Other prisoners had been bullying Whitchurch and goading her to take her own life. Prison officers did not challenge the other prisoners and failed to prevent the bullying. On the 18th May 2016 Whitchurch was found distressed with a ligature round her neck. Whitchurch was put under observation but the observation was insufficient and hours later Whitchurch was found unconscious with a ligature round her neck, she died later in hospital. An inquest jury was unsure if the death was suicide or extreme self harm that went wrong. The jury found that Whitchurch received inadequate care by prison staff and there were organizational failings within the prison.Inmate who died after bullying was let down by prison, inquest finds The Guardian The prison today Eastwood Park Prison offers education courses in Basic Skills, wider Key Skills, Information Technology, Cookery, Diversity, Salon Services, Manicure, Preparation for Work, Drug and Alcohol Awareness and Industrial Cleaning. The prison also offers employment with work-based qualifications. In addition Eastwood Park has a gym for physical education as well as recreational gym. Prisoners also have access to a Health Bar where they can purchase various health and beauty products from waxing strips to tooth whitening products. The Family and Friends Centre is the visitors centre at Eastwood Park Prison, and has facilities including toilets, a refreshments counter, information points and a small play area for children. The prison, like many others, has a big issue around the concealment of tradeable medicines such as pregabalin, quetiapine and gabapentin. These medicines are highly desirable in prison and inmates will trade them for things such as vape re-fills, cigarettes or illicit drugs. Inmates are sometimes bullied for their medicines. Methadone is sometimes concealed by the placement of cotton wool or a tampon in their mouth before they take their methadone, which they then squeeze out once out of sight. There is also the famous 'sick meth' which as the name suggests is regurgitated methadone.

Miller (born 1934) is one of two black motor racing pioneers living in the United States.African American auto racing pioneer Leonard W. Miller  Early life  Miller was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and raised in its suburbs. His lifelong love of automobiles began at age five in 1939, and he began secretly tinkering with his family‚Äôs 1937 Ford in 1948. He built an advanced 1940 Ford club coupe hotrod convertible in 1953. As a charter member of George Barris‚Äôs Kustoms of America based in Southern California, he ordered custom parts from Barris to complete his project in Pennsylvania. Because of his knowledge of automobiles, Miller was assigned to the United States Third Army‚Äôs 45th Ordnance Battalion, Direct Automotive Support Company in 1957. This one-of-a-kind company was trained to repair jeeps and trucks under battlefield conditions and consisted of hot-rodders, drag racers, United Auto Workers assembly line workers and NASCAR racers. Miller was mentored by Mel Leighton and Sumner ‚ÄúRed‚Äù Oliver, two black racing pioneers of the 1920s-1940s. These relationships, and friendships with Wendell Scott and Malcolm Durham, helped propel Miller and African American driver Benny Scott to many achievements racing under the Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR) and Vanguard Racing, Inc. banners in the 1970s.  Indy Car owner  Malcolm Durham, Leonard W. Miller, Wendell Scott, and Ronald Hines (l-r) of the Black American Racers AssociationIn 1972, Vanguard Racing became the first black- owned team to enter a car in the Indianapolis 500, with John Mahler as the driver. Vanguard‚Äôs concept was to employ Mahler as a development coach to help prepare Benny Scott for the Indianapolis 500 in subsequent years. Scott drove Vanguard‚Äôs Formula A, in a McLaren M10-A, powered with a 500-horsepower Chevrolet V-8 in the L & M Continental 5000 Championship and Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) events. Scott won the CSCC-SCCA Southern Pacific Division Championship in 1972, outperforming drivers traveling from as far away as Australia to compete. Vanguard‚Äôs board of directors consisted of Paul Jackson, president of Jackson & Sanders Construction Company; Robert Sargent Shriver, Jr., first head of the Peace Corps and former Ambassador to France, who would be the Democratic Party's candidate for Vice President of the United States in 1972; Washington Redskins defensive halfback Brig Owens; and Richard Deutsch, board chairman of Harbor Oil Corporation. Unfortunately for the team's ambitions, Vanguard‚Äôs stockholders were euphoric with John Mahler‚Äôs performance at the 1972 Indianapolis 500, and as a result they lost their patience and ambition to groom Benny Scott.  Organizing black racers  Miller was also the founder, in 1972, of the Black American Racers Association (BARA). At its height, BARA boasted 5,000 members from 20 states. Wendell Scott was the first honorary chairman. Ron Hines, a University of Pennsylvania-trained mechanical engineer, served as secretary and race team mechanic. Today, former BARA members from Maryland, Washington, DC, and Virginia are carrying on the original objectives as the Quartermasters Drag Racing Team.  Black American Racers  In 1973, Miller formed Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR) from his offices on West State Street in Trenton, New Jersey. BAR secured sponsorship from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation (Viceroy Cigarettes), as part of an initiative called ‚ÄúRoad To Indy.‚Äù This stairstep scheme put Scott in Formula Super Vee (FSV) competition in SCCA, International Motor Sports Association (IMSA), and the Robert Bosch Gold Cup series on road circuits from coast to coast including Watkins Glen International, Lime Rock Park, Mid-Ohio, Laguna Seca Raceway, Road America, and Pocono Raceway. Scott achieved several podium finishes in Lola T-324 FSV‚Äôs purchased from legendary Carl Haas Automobile Imports. At Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, California on May 4, 1975, he was the fastest qualifier, but on the final lap of the race itself Scott was barely beaten in a photo finish by Fred Phillips in his Eldon Mk 14B.  BAR driver development  In 1973 Miller and Scott devised a driver development program for BAR, before it became widespread in American motor racing, motivated by a question Miller was asked often by potential sponsors in corporate America: What if your primary black driver is killed? To eliminate this dilemma, Miller signed Coyle Peek, a 23-year-old African American driver from Long Island, New York. Peek was a Formula Ford (FF) driver. Miller placed Peek with S.H.A.R.P Racing Limited in the United Kingdom to aid his development in the most competitive entry-level road racing series in the world: British Formula Ford. Under the BAR banner, Peek competed in a British-manufactured Royale RP16 chassis powered by a 1600cc engine at world-famous British circuits such as Brands Hatch, the Silverstone Circuit, and Mallory Park. Peek competed against FF chassis types such as Meryln 17a and 20a, Macon MR6, Lotus 51, 61, 61M, Van Diemen FA73, and the Bradley FF. Coyle Peek progressed rapidly, finishing in the top 10 in most races, with a second-place finish as his highest. He quickly earned the post as a reserve driver in case Benny Scott were to be injured or killed competing for BAR in FSV. After he returned to the US, Peek attended many of BAR‚Äôs events. Miller tried to acquire a companion race car and sponsorship for Peek, but it was denied in corporate boardrooms. Miller is the first documented African American team principal to dispatch an African American driver across the North Atlantic for professional race car driving development supported by his own means.  Long Beach Grand Prix  Brown & Williamson Tobacco expedited BAR‚Äôs promotion into Formula 5000 events, with Benny Scott competing at speeds over 200 mph with racing legends such as Great Britain‚Äôs Brian Redman, South Africa‚Äôs Jody Scheckter, Mario Andretti, and Chris Amon of New Zealand. BAR qualified for the inaugural Long Beach Grand Prix (LBGP) on September 28, 1975, an invitation-only event for the top 60 race teams in the world. Scott qualified the BAR‚Äôs Lola T332 entry 24th out of the 30 teams that qualified for the race. Scott finished the race in 11th place. Grant King was BAR‚Äôs chief mechanic for all the Formula 5000 races the team entered in 1975. Although BAR‚Äôs LBGP performance demonstrated its ability to qualify the first African American driver for the Indianapolis 500 in the mid-1970s, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation terminated all of its motor racing sponsorships in November 1975 for business reasons. BAR approached several other Fortune 500 companies to continue its ‚ÄúFast Road to Indianapolis‚Äù effort, without success. Willy T. Ribbs, who was inspired to become a professional race car driver by his father‚Äôs interaction with Miller's and Scott's trailblazing accomplishments at California race tracks, qualified for the Indianapolis 500 in 1991 and 1993, but was also challenged by insufficient corporate sponsorship to sustain his efforts. The sponsorship challenge continues to plague all African American motor racing efforts, into the 21st century.  Hall of Fame  In 1976, Leonard W. Miller and Benny Scott were inducted into the Black Athletes Hall of Fame at the New York Hilton in Manhattan for their achievements in motor racing. A host of sports notables and entertainers were in attendance, including NFL star Frank Gifford, ABC Sports broadcaster Howard Cosell, legendary soul singer James Brown, boxing promoter Don King, and New York Knicks basketball player Earl \\"the Pearl\\" Monroe. Actor Bill Cosby was the master of ceremonies. Over 1000 patrons and icons attended the black-tie ceremony.  Mini-Indy tragedy  African American driver Tommy Thompson approached Miller in 1977 to continue the BAR effort with personal funds in FSV (called Mini-Indy cars at that time). Miller‚Äôs longtime friend Ken Wright (auto racing mechanic) joined Ron Hines to perform mechanical duties on the Lola T-324 and T-620. BAR garnered some wins with Thompson, including the SCCA Northeast Division championship.Tommy Thompson, Leonard W. Miller and Ron Hines at the Milwaukee Mile, September 1978 Unfortunately, in September 1978, Thompson was killed in a crash at the Trenton Speedway in Trenton, New Jersey. Benny Scott finished the 1978 season for BAR.  Recent accomplishments  Miller formed several NASCAR grassroots efforts based from his shop in Concord, North Carolina from 1994-1999, resulting in many successes with his son, Leonard T. Miller. The team at this time was named Miller Racing Group and had General Motors and Dr Pepper as sponsors. In 2005, Miller and his son were the first African American team owners to win a track championship in NASCAR history. They won the stock car championship at Old Dominion Speedway in Manassas, Virginia and was acknowledged as one of the top 10 teams in the middle Atlantic division. Franklin Butler was the driver. Paul Newman called Miller's autobiography, Silent Thunder: Breaking Through Cultural, Racial, and Class Barriers in Motorsports (2004), \\"an extraordinary book that is refreshingly honest,\\" and Mario Andretti praised it as \\"eye-opening\\". In its 50th Anniversary Edition in July 2008, AutoWeek magazine named Silent Thunder one of the top 50 automobile books of the previous 50 years. Miller's son has also written a book about the Miller Racing Group and NASCAR, titled Racing While Black, published in 2010 by Seven Stories Press.

It premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. It is being distributed internationally by ContentFilm. Plot Four individuals sign up for a psychological research study only to discover that they are now subjects of a brutal, modern version of the Project MKULTRA indoctrination program. One by one, the subjects are brought into a large, white room, in which the tables and chairs have been bolted to the floor. They are each given a questionnaire to fill out. In the meantime, a researcher enters the room, ostensibly to give an overview of the study. He indicates to the subjects‚Äîthree men and a woman‚Äîthat the study will take approximately eight hours to complete, at which time they will each be paid $250. Upon completing his introduction, the researcher shoots the female subject in the head with a gun and promptly leaves the room. Over the next few hours, the remaining three male subjects will be subjected to additional physical and psychological brutality. Only one subject will survive the ordeal. This subject manages to escape into the building. The loudspeaker gives details of where the subject is in the building. It is then realized that the subject is going where he is supposed to be. He ends up in a room with two other males tied to their chairs. The loudspeaker then states that phase 2 is to begin. It is revealed, during the last subject's escape attempt, that the goal of the covert program is to achieve in human civilians a phenomenon similar to apoptosis in cells (a comparison noted in the film), by developing \\"civilian weapons\\" akin to suicide bombers.

Stam is an acronym denoting these writings, as indicated by the gershayim (◊¥) punctuation mark. One who writes such articles is called a Sofer Stam. The writing is done by means of a feather, and ink (known as D'yo) onto special parchment called klaf. There exist two primary traditions in respect to the formation of the letters, Ktav HaAshkenazi and Ktav HaSefardi, however the differences between them are slight. Parchment Klaf is the material on which a sofer writes certain Jewish liturgical and ritual documents, the kosher form of parchment or vellum. The writing material can be made of the specially prepared skin of a kosher animal - goat, cattle, or deer. The hide can consist of: * Gevil (), the full, un-split hide; * Klaf (), the outer, hairy layer; or * Duchsustus () Only gevil and klaf can be used for holy writings. Duchsustus is not permitted. However, duchsustus is used for writing a mezuzah. Writing device (kulmus) The () is the feather or reed used for the writing. The original source of the word stems from the Greek () The feathers need to be obtained from a large bird and today the feathers of turkeys are most often used for this purpose. There is some debate however, as to whether feathers need be obtained from a kosher bird species or not. Ink (deyo) The special ink prepared for the writing is called d'yo (). Maimonides wrote that the d'yo is prepared in the following way: Ktav Stam > One collects the soot of oils, of tar, of wax, or the like, and kneads it > together with sap from a tree and a drop of honey. It is moistened > extensively, crushed until it is formed into flat cakes, dried, and then > stored. When one desires to write with it, one soaks it in gallnut juice or > the like and writes with it. Thus, if one attempts to rub it out, he would > be able to. This is the ink with which it is most preferable to write > scrolls, tefillin, and mezuzot. If however one wrote any of the three with > gallnut juice or vitriol, which remains without being rubbed out, it is > acceptable.Mishneh Torah, Laws of Tefillin 1:4 Sirtut Sirtut () are straight lines that the sofer must, by Torah law, etch into the klaf. The obligation primarily pertains to Sifrei Torah, Mezuza, and Meggila, however there are those who are similarly accustomed to placing sirtut on the Arba Parshiyot for tefillin. This helps the sofer write in neat straight lines. Spiritual attitude (ketiva lishma) Every aspect of the process must be done lishma (), which is to say for its own sake with pure motives. The sofer must also be particularly concentrated upon the writing of any of the Divine Names. At many junctures in the process he is obligated to verbalize the fact that he is performing his action lishma. Form of the letters The K'tav Ashuri is the only permissible Hebrew script, however over the centuries in Exile some minor variations have developed. The two primary traditions are Ktav HaAshkenazi and Ktav HaSefardi. Ketav Ashkenazi is split into two categories: * Ketav Bet Yosef ‚Äì which is the standard Ashkenaz tradition. * Ketav HaAri ‚Äì which is the Hasidic tradition. Ktav Sefardi (also known as Vellish) ‚Äì is the standard utilized by Mizrahi Jews, and Yemenite Jews. Serifs (tagin) A sample of the Ashuri alphabet (, written, with according to the Ashkenaz scribal custom on parchment ( ) (or ; Hebrew and Aramaic: , , ; also Hebrew: , , , ) are the distinct crown-like serifs affixed atop the letters. If the are absent, the writing is not invalidated. According to Rabbi Akiva in the Talmud, not only can one learn something from every letter in the Torah, but one can also learn something from the placement of the . On the letters there are three , on the letters there is one , and on the letters there are none. Errors Some errors are inevitable in the course of production. If the error involves a word other than a Divine Name, the mistaken letter may be removed from the scroll by scraping the letter off the scroll with a sharp object. If the Divine Name is written in error, the entire page, if written in a Torah, must be cut from the scroll and a new page added, and the page written anew from the beginning. The new page is sewn into the scroll to maintain continuity of the document. The old page is treated with appropriate respect, and is either buried, or stored away with respect rather than otherwise destroyed or discarded. In tefillin and mezuzot all the letters, the words and the parashot are required to be written in the order they appear in the Torah. Within any of the parashot if an error or an invalidated letter is discovered, or a missing letter was discovered after the completion of the writing, the rest of the document must be erased from the end all the way back to the error, to fix it, and write it anew.

The album was released in Europe on October 20, 2008, by EmArcy and in the U.S. on February 3, 2009, by Heads Up. This is the first Bad Plus album to include a vocalist, as well as the first to feature no original songs. Although the Bad Plus are known for playing cover versions of rock songs, this is their first album with nothing but cover songs, including a few 20th-century classical pieces. David King explained to Star Tribune that the main inspiration for the record was the seminal 1963 album John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman. As he mentioned, \\"The band still played like it was the John Coltrane Quartet, with or without Hartman. That's what we really aimed for.\\" Reception At Metacritic, that assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 68, based on 11 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The album was extensively screened by musical critics. Fred Kaplan of Stereophile wrote, \\"...the band‚Äôs new album, For All I Care [...], resolves the question: The Bad Plus, it‚Äôs now clear, can go on for as long as they want; their resourcefulness seems to be limitless. This is their most ambitious, and most accomplished, album, the one that should persuade the final doubters that there‚Äôs serious‚Äînot brow-furrowed, in fact still quite playful, but in the best sense of the word serious‚Äîmusic going on here.\\" A reviewer of DownBeat stated, \\"The album marks the first Bad Plus recording to include a guest vocalist, alt-rock singer Wendy Lewis, as the fourth instrument in its sonic arsenal. In the midst of The Bad Plus‚Äô characteristically unconventional approach, Lewis strove to avoid theatrics and let the lyrics and melodies speak for themselves.\\" Michael J. West of JazzTimes commented, \\"The Bad Plus maintains that this facet of their work is not a gimmick or novelty. They play the rock-era songs with humor and irreverence, but no more than on originals and jazz compositions. This music is simply the soundtrack to their time and place...\\" In his review for All About Jazz, Jeff Vrabel stated, \\"With For All I Care, The Bad Plus opted to keep things as simple as possible within the new set of sonic guidelines.\\" John Fordham of The Guardian commented, \\"There's less jazz improv, but it's a set that's going to find the Bad Plus a lot of new friends, and recover some old ones.\\" Corey duBrowa of Paste mentioned, \\"...for all of The Bad Plus‚Äô instrumental prowess and fearless exploration, it's Lewis‚Äô voice that stars here, bending notes and emotion to her will like so many coat hangers left outside in a tornado.\\" Aaron Lafont of OffBeat wrote, \\"For too long has post-modern jazz been preoccupied with making the strange, stranger. Here‚Äôs to the Bad Plus and Wendy Lewis for eroding the borders that separate jazz and rock.\\" Evan Sawdey of PopMatters gave the album a negative review, stating, \\"In the end, For All I Care isn't a bad album. It's just a very unremarkable effort from a band that we've grown to expect so much more from.\\" Peter Hum of Ottawa Citizen wrote, \\"The Bad Plus pushes its marriage of jazz‚Äôs improvisatory zeal and rock‚Äôs energy and attitude even further with For All I Care.\\" Jeff Tamarkin writing for East Bay Express added, \\"though it inches the Bad Plus closer to the pop mainstream, it never loses the particular rhythmic and harmonic quirks that have defined them so far.\\" Track listing Listed next to each track is the most known performer of each piece, followed by the writers (except for the classical tradition pieces). #\\"Lithium\\" - 4:46 (Nirvana; Kurt Cobain) #\\"Comfortably Numb\\" - 6:41 (Pink Floyd; David Gilmour/Roger Waters) #\\"F√©m (Etude No. 8)\\" - 3:20 (Gy√∂rgy Ligeti) #\\"Radio Cure\\" - 6:40 (Wilco; Jay Bennett/Jeff Tweedy) #\\"Long Distance Runaround\\" - 3:43 (Yes; Jon Anderson) #\\"Semi-Simple Variations\\" - 3:32 (Milton Babbitt) #\\"How Deep Is Your Love\\" - 3:39 (The Bee Gees; Barry Gibb/Maurice Gibb/Robin Gibb) #\\"Barracuda\\" - 3:21 (Heart; Ann Wilson/Michael DeRosier/Nancy Wilson/Roger Fisher) #\\"Lock, Stock and Teardrops\\" - 4:08 (Roger Miller) #\\"Variation d'Apollon\\" - 4:33 (Igor Stravinsky) #\\"Feeling Yourself Disintegrate\\" - 4:47 (The Flaming Lips; Michael Ivins/Steven Drozd/Wayne Coyne) #\\"Semi-Simple Variations (Alternate Version)\\" - 1:11 (Milton Babbitt) Personnel * Ethan Iverson ‚Äì piano, bells * Reid Anderson ‚Äì bass, vocals * David King ‚Äì drums, vocals * Wendy Lewis ‚Äì vocals * The Bad Plus ‚Äì producer * Tchad Blake ‚Äì mixing * Brent Sigmeth ‚Äì recording References  External links  * Review at The Guardian newspaper Category:2008 albums Category:The Bad Plus albums Category:Heads Up International albums ","title":"For All I Care"},{"id":"20008258","text":"Jesse Randhawa (born 11 August 1975) is an Indian model and actress.

He attended gymnasium in Aix-la-Chappelle to the east (now called Aachen and within modern day Germany). He lost his right arm in an accident at the age of 10, but nonetheless excelled academically. He studied at the University of Bonn, where he earned a PhD, and was in particular influenced by Barthold Georg Niebuhr; Schmitz later published in England a collection of notes taken from Niebuhr's lectures as Lectures on Roman History (1844). He became associated with a number of scholars there, writing many of the mythological entries for classicist William Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, and serving as \\"a key figure in the transmission of German classical scholarship to Victorian Britain\\".

Description  The Lectron kit consisted of electronic components installed within individual \\"building blocks\\" with a clear plastic base, an opaque white top with the component's schematic symbol and permanent magnets attached to the leads of the enclosed components. Each building block was magnetically attached to a metal plate serving both as a work surface and ground, eliminating the need for soldering, spring terminals or a breadboard. This gave the benefit of safety as well as the ability to rearrange the blocks to determine the effect on the circuit. The instruction manual gave instruction on the proper arrangement of the blocks as well as the function of each individual component's contribution to the final circuit. Experiments began with simple circuits such as a basic electric lamp circuit with switch and worked its way to a three-transistor radio with loudspeaker. The Raytheon models have not been officially sold in the US since 1969. The Lectron product is still being manufactured in Frankfurt, Germany and is available for sale with shipping world wide. However, all the manuals are in German, with no plans for translation into English or any other language.  History  = Europe = Braun Lectron Elements; Exhibition Systems design : The Ulm school at Museu del Disseny (DHUB) in Barcelona; September 21, 2011 ‚Äì May 20, 2012 The Lectron electronic blocks system and product was the exclusive and unique invention of Georg Greger in the early 1960s. He applied for a patent of his Electronik-baukasten (electronic building blocks) on May 7, 1965. He was issued a German patent #1228081 on May 18, 1967, and the American patent #3,447,249 was issued on June 3, 1969. The American patent filing of May 5, 1966 is particularly interesting because it includes additional drawings (e.g. the speaker and deluxe base plate) which the German patent did not have. There is also quite a bit more detail on how everything works. The Lectron was introduced in the German market by model train manufacturer Egger-Bahn. In 1967 Egger Bahn dissolved, and the Lectron product was moved to Deutsche Lectron GmbH, which became the sole manufacturer until 1972. Deutsche Lectron GmbH licensed the system worldwide to Braun, except for North America. In the United States, the Macalaster Scientific subsidiary of Raytheon became the licensee. In 1967, Braun acquired the original Egger-Bahn line from Deutsche Lectron GmbH. While the basic block design and the styrofoam storage case were retained, Dieter Rams and his team produced new outer packaging and a complete redesign of all manuals. They also supervised all expansions during the Braun era. Dietrich Lubs, designer of the iconic \\"round button\\" pocket calculator ET66, created the symbols for several new Demonstrations-System elements (classroom system using oversize blocks) like the logic gates of box 1300. In 1972, Braun spun off the Lectron business and joined it with Deutsche Lectron GmbH into Lectron GmbH. Manfred Walter, former head of the Lectron department at Braun, became the sole owner and continued development. In 2001, he donated the business, all stock, and all manufacturing tools to Reha Werkstatt Oberrad, a not-for-profit business creating adequate workplaces for the disabled. RWO continues to develop Lectron up to the present. From 1967 until 1972, Italian company INELCO (Industria Elettronica Comense SrI, Tavernerio, Como) operated as local distributor for Braun. Beginning in 1972 a set of eight products (Book System plus seven extensions) were sold as Sistema Lectron Serie 2000. From 1968 until 2001 INELCO provided translation for Braun and Lectron GmbH from German into seven languages (Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, Italian and Swedish). = North America = Raytheon marketed the Lectron in two versions. The first version was called \\"Electronic Dominoes\\" and featured two models: the 800 and the 820. The second version, which began in May 1968, was sold as \\"Lectron\\" and saw an expansion of the product family to three new sets initially (the 800 and 820 model sets were repurposed as the Series 2 and Series 3 sets, with the packaging completely redesigned). This version included the Series 1 - 5 models and the Add-On Kits 1 - 5 which could be used to upgrade, for example, a Series 1 model into a Series 2 model. The \\"Electronic Dominoes\\" moniker was also dropped. The styrofoam molds were reused from the Egger packaging (although the Raytheon production packaging used white styrofoam instead of black), and the blocks themselves continued to be made in (West) Germany. The Series 3A reached the marketplace later, and offered 64 experiments. Add-On Kits 6 - 7 were added at the same time of the Series 3A's release. Raytheon also marketed a Series 3 model for Creative Playthings of Princeton, NJ which was sold as the 'S822 Lectron SCIII'.

History Prior to 1981, telecommunications in Macau fell mainly under the purview of Macau Post and Telecommunications. Residents in Macau had to wait many months simply to have a telephone connected. To make a telephone call to Hong Kong was a lengthy procedure which had to be placed through an operator. On 29 September 1981, an agreement was reached between the then Portuguese Macau government and the British telecommunications company Cable & Wireless plc to set up the new company Companhia de Telecomunica√ß√µes de Macau S.A.R.L.. Shareholders included Marconi Comunica√ß√µes Internacionais (the Portuguese operations of the UK-based Marconi Company, acquired by Portugal Telecom (now Altice Portugal) in 2002), CITIC Pacific (later transferred to subsidiary CITIC Telecom International in 2010) and Macau Post.

At low tide its intertidal mudflats provide important feeding habitat for migratory waders. It is also an important area for recreational fishing. It is named after Samuel Anderson pioneer explorer the first European to settle in the area.About Inverloch Anderson Inlet Boating Area Tourism Inverloch is an important tourist town, with visitor numbers swelling in the summer months due to the coastal lifestyle and proximity to Melbourne. Anderson Inlet's popularity is hinged on the almost-enclosed bay, making it a protected beach with safe swimming. At low tide the surf beach can be accessed on foot around the western headland. Anderson Inlet is also a popular recreational boating area with a boat ramp jetty. Because of its tidal nature, the areas where vessels can operate is restricted for the safety of the tourists as the depth of the water varies. Knowledge of the inlet is a must to cross the bar and the operators of vessels are required to carry tide tables while going out in the water. Anderson Inlet is also a base for many walking and cycling trails including the Screw Creek Nature Trail and the Bass Coast Rail Trail which is Victoria's only coastal rail trail. The inlet is close to national parks including the Anderson Inlet Coastal Reserve and the Bunurong Marine and Coastal Park.

The GVP reports on current eruptions from around the world as well as maintaining a database repository on active volcanoes and their eruptions. In this way, a global context for the planet's active volcanism is presented. Smithsonian reporting on current volcanic activity dates back to 1968, with the Center for Short-Lived Phenomena (CSLP). The GVP is housed in the Department of Mineral Sciences, part of the National Museum of Natural History, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. During the early stages of an eruption, the GVP acts as a clearing house of reports, data, and imagery which are accumulated from a global network of contributors. The early flow of information is managed such that the right people are contacted as well as helping to sort out vague and contradictory aspects that typically arise during the early days of an eruption. The Weekly Volcanic Activity Report is a cooperative project between the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Program and the United States Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Program. Notices of volcanic activity posted on the report website are preliminary and subject to change as events are studied in more detail. Detailed reports on various volcanoes are published monthly in the Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network The GVP also documents the last 10,000 years of Earth's volcanism. The historic activity can guide perspectives on possible future events and on volcanoes showing activity.

As of 2018 the South Florida Council had a membership of more than 43,000 youth and adults. History In 1911, the Miami Council was formed. It merged with the Dade County Council (#084) in 1921. In 1927, the Broward County Council was formed. It merged with the Dade County Council in 1933 and the Council's current geographical boundaries had been formed, consisting of Broward, Dade, and Monroe Counties. In 1945, the Dade County Council changed its name to the South Florida Council (#084). A year after Scouting began in Miami, the tradition of an annual recognition banquet began. In May, 1912, newspaper accounts reported that Scouts were called upon at the banquet to recount the \\"good turns\\" they had performed. Their deeds ranged from the prosaic, such as picking up debris from roads and running errands, to the bygone (\\"holding someone's horse\\") and the dramatic (rescuing a person who fell into a river). Also in 1912, the auditorium of a former school building in Miami was converted into a gymnasium for Boy Scouts to use. As 1913 drew to a close, a highlight for Miami Scouts was a visit to Villa Serena, the winter home of then-U.S. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan. Introduced as \\"one of America's greatest Scouts and citizens\\", Bryan spoke to the youths from his front porch as they stood at attention and rendered the Scout Salute. As early as the 1920s, there were more than 300 Scouts in Key West, the southernmost point of the United States. In 1938, a gala council-wide gathering was held in Key West, headlined on page one of the Key West Citizen as an \\"impressive Scout campfire rally\\". Key West mayor William Albury addressed the assemblage, preceded by a parade. A highlight for the South Florida Council in later years was the youth encampment held on Lammas Island in 1976 as part of the United States Bicentennial celebration that year. A joint effort with the City of Miami and the U.S. Coast Guard 7th District, it was called the 1976 Bicentennial Project for the Youth of Miami. Upon completion of a permanent dock on the island, it was dubbed \\"Miami Scouting World\\" and marked with a bronze plaque. Islamorada Memorial dedication, 1937 Hurricanes have been a significant part of the Council's history. In the aftermath of the catastrophic 1935 Labor Day hurricane which devastated the Florida Keys and killed hundreds, Boy Scouts from the Dade County Council, as it was then known, were part of the clean-up efforts and participated in the ceremonies dedicating the Islamorada Memorial in November, 1937. When Hurricane Andrew struck the Homestead area in 1992, the Council organized Scout troops outside the ravaged area to help distribute emergency food and clothing. The Council's own archived records were lost in 2005 when Hurricane Wilma tore the roof off of a storage building and inundated the vicinity with flood waters. Severe damage was also sustained by Camp Seminole, the Council's principal reservation, resulting in its closure for seven years until it was eventually rebuilt and re-opened in 2012 as Camp Elmore (below). More recently, Hurricane Irma in 2017 damaged the Council's camp on Scout Key. Organization Thomas L. Tatham council office The Council's headquarters are located in Miami Lakes and are named after a former council president, Thomas L. Tatham. He was a prominent attorney and land developer in Florida who was active in Scouting, both as a youth and Council leader. In 1995, Tatham donated $2.5 million to the Council. As of 2017, almost 90% of the non- profit's revenues were allocated to its programs and Charity Navigator gave it a 100 percent rating that year for \\"accountability and transparency\\". The council is divided into nine districts: * Buccaneer District serves Monroe County. * Fireball District serves Medley, Miami Lakes, Miami Springs, Hialeah, Hialeah Gardens and Virginia Gardens. * Hurricane District serves south-central Miami-Dade County. * Lighthouse District serves Coconut Creek, Coral Springs, Deerfield Beach, Hillsboro Beach, Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Lauderdale Lakes, Lauderhill, Lighthouse Point, Margate, North Lauderdale, Oakland Park, Parkland, Pompano Beach, Sea Ranch Lakes and Tamarac. *Pine Island District serves Broward County in the area between Oakland Park Boulevard and Griffin Road. * Biscayne Bay District serves Aventura, Bay Harbor Islands, Biscayne Park, Miami Beach, Miami Shores, El Portal, Norland, North Bay Village, North Miami, North Miami Beach, Ojus, Opa-Locka, Sunny Isles Beach and Surfside. * Seminole District serves southern Broward County. * Tequesta District serves Central Miami-Dade County. * Thunderbird District serves Cutler Bay, Goulds, Homestead, Leisure City, Naranja, Perrine, and South Miami Heights, Florida In 2003, the Council became embroiled in controversy when the United Way of Miami-Date discontinued its $480,400 annual funding apportionment, representing approximately 20% of the Council's total budget. The issue arose over demands that the Scout program include sexual orientation training for its members. The United Way Miami-Dade's CEO, Harve Mogul, said of its decision, \\"The fact that they're doing business in a diverse community carries with it a responsibility to that diverse community\\". The South Florida Council Executive at the time, Jeff Herrmann, told a reporter that, \\"Sex education and sexual orientation are not part of our program, and we're unwilling to make them part of our program\\". Programs thumb The Council conducts a program called \\"Drive a Scout to School\\", to encourage greater bicycle and pedestrian safety awareness. The activity features NASCAR driver Scott Lagasse Jr., a former Scout himself, who partnered with the Florida Department of Transportation‚Äôs Alert Today Alive Tomorrow, campaign. Selected Scouts are given a demonstration ride in a NASCAR car driven by Lagasse. Other activities for the public include Memorial Day ceremonies and a parade, organized in conjunction with the City of Davie at the Bergeron Rodeo Grounds. =Camps= The South Florida Council owns and operates three camps serving thousands of youth annually: : ;Camp Elmore: Located in Davie, Florida, the Council received the land parcel as a gift from the Board of County Commissioners of Broward County in 1958 and developed it as Camp Seminole. It was devastated by Hurricane Wilma on October 24, 2005, which caused extensive damage to 80% of the buildings and infrastructure. In the wake of the tropical cyclone's destruction, the camp was closed for the next seven years. A master plan was formulated for extensive re-development, resulting in a new 300-seat dining hall, swimming pool and lake, along with upgrades to utilities and other recreational facilities. By the time the camp re-opened in 2012, the reconstruction cost $10 million, much of which was underwritten by various philanthropists and corporate donors. Road paving contractor Robert Elmore donated $1 million towards the rebuilding and the camp was renamed in his honor. A similar donation for clearing and in-kind engineering work was provided by Downrite Engineering, which also rebuilt the camp's lake to a depth of , making the water body \\"now swimmable, which it wasn't before\\", the Council Executive said to a reporter. In recognition of the Miami-based engineering firm's contributions, the Council now titles the facility \\"Camp Elmore at Downrite Engineering Scout Reservation\\". Other area corporate contributions towards the re-building of the Council's principal camp included the Huizenga Family Foundation's funding of the chapel and Publix Supermarkets' donation for construction of the amphitheater. Ten campsites are available at the property. Nine are named for the Council's Order of the Arrow O-Shot-Caw Lodge chapters: Elgixin, Gokhos, Paldani, Pooca Tooka, O-Shot-Co-Chee, Tomoka, Hnu-Ra-Con, To Hopki Lagi, and Nok Su. One of the campsites within Camp Elmore is named Camp Seminole, in remembrance of the past, when many South Florida Scouts and Scouters spent their time at Camp Seminole. : ;Camp Everglades: Camp Everglades is primarily pine rockland forest with eight primitive campsites, a main campfire arena, a main covered shelter, and pitcher pump wells. The campground is located within the Everglades National Park. The pine forest is fire dependent, and the flora and fauna have adapted to the frequent fires ignited by summer lightning storms. : ;Camp Sawyer: Camp Sawyer on Scout Key in 1987 A site located on Scout Key in the lower Florida Keys, with the Atlantic Ocean on the east shore and the Gulf of Mexico directly to the west, Camp Sawyer shares the island with Camp Wesumkee of the Girl Scouts. The Camp is now part of the larger Edward B. Knight Scout Reservation, named for a philanthropist and Rotarian by that name. Activities include: swimming, snorkeling, fishing and boating. There are four tropical campsites right on the Atlantic Ocean. The camp was heavily damaged in September, 2017, by the 140-mph winds and storm surge from Hurricane Irma. =Former camps= The South Florida Council also formerly owned and operated the old McGregor Smith Scout Reservation in Inverness, Florida. The vast tract on the Withlacoochee River was purchased for $1 million in 1969 with the intention that it would be utilized as a Scout camp by Councils throughout Florida. The envisaged statewide usage never developed, however, and its almost distance from Miami discouraged large numbers of troops from attending. Facing deficits and minimal attendance, the Council sold the property to the Southwest Florida Water Management District in 2005 for $13.5 million. Thereafter, the Council continued to operate the camp for Scouting activities by agreement with the Water Management District until 2012, when the Council discontinued use of the property altogether. In 2017, former Scout camp structures on the property, such as cabins, were auctioned off with future use of the land planned as a nature preserve and recreational area. =Order of the Arrow= O-Shot-Caw Lodge #265 is the South Florida Council's Order of the Arrow lodge, one of eight in Section S-4 covering the state of Florida (except the Panhandle). On June 20, 1944, the Council's first Order of the Arrow Lodge was started as Ala-paw-tah 265 but was subsequently discontinued on September 8, 1949. On June 28, 1955, the council's current Order of the Arrow lodge, O-Shot-Caw 265, was chartered, using the great white heron as its \\"totem\\". Within a year, the lodge had grown to more than 125 members. In the years since, the lodge has hosted numerous statewide conferences and seminars for Section S-4 at Camp Seminole (now Camp Elmore). The lodge is organized into nine Chapters, corresponding to the Council's Districts: * Hurricane District - Hnu-Ra-Con Chapter * Tequesta District - O-Shot-Co-Chee Chapter * Thunderbird District - To-Hopki-Logi Chapter * Buccaneer District - Nok Su Chapter * Biscayne Bay District - Tomoka Chapter * Fireball District - Pooca Tooka Chapter * Seminole District - Paldani Chapter * Pine Island District - Gokhos Chapter * Lighthouse District - Elgixin Chapter See also *Scouting in Florida *Gulf Stream Council (North) *Southwest Florida Council (Northwest) References Category:Local councils of the Boy Scouts of America Category:Southern Region (Boy Scouts of America) Category:Youth organizations based in Florida Category:1911 establishments in Florida ","title":"South Florida Council"},{"id":"20008609","text":"The Florida Greyhound Lines (called also FGL), a highway-coach carrier, was a Greyhound regional operating company, based in Jacksonville, Florida, USA, from 1946 until 1957, when it was merged into the Southeastern Greyhound Lines, a neighboring operating company. Origin The immediate predecessor of the Florida Greyhound Lines (GL) was the Florida Motor Lines (called also FML), which began in January 1926 - when the firm of Stone and Webster, a multistate public-utility management-service company, established a headquarters in Orlando for the FML and consolidated several properties which it had bought and operated in the Sunshine State. The FML then owned 150 coaches and ran them along 1,290 route miles. The largest and strongest of those subsidiaries was the Florida Motor Transportation (FMT) Company, based in Miami, which had begun in 1919 - as a result of a merger between two other firms, each likewise based in Miami, and each of which had started in 1914 - the Clyde Passenger Express, running southward to Homestead, and the White Star Auto Line, running northward to West Palm Beach. The FMT Company extended northward along the East Coast to Jacksonville in 1921. The second largest firm was the White Stage Line Company, which had begun in 1918 as the White Bus Line, running between Tampa and Saint Petersburg - eventually, starting in 1924, along US highway 92 (US-92) on the new Gandy Bridge across Tampa Bay, which shortened the distance from to 19 (30 km) ‚Äì and which extended to Orlando in 1924 and to West Palm Beach in 1925. In 1927 the Florida Motor Lines (FML) also began to provide tour and sightseeing services in Miami, Miami Beach, Jacksonville, Saint Augustine, and Daytona Beach. In 1933 the FML moved its head office from Orlando to Jacksonville. The FML made connections to the north (in Jacksonville) with the Atlantic GL and to the north and northwest (in Jacksonville, Lake City, and Tallahassee) with the Consolidated Coach Corporation (which in 1936 became renamed as the Southeastern Greyhound Lines) and the Union Bus Company (which in 1941 was bought by and merged into the Southeastern GL). The FML continued to grow and expand within the Sunshine State, mostly by acquiring other pre-existing firms. However, in one notable instance (among others), the FML obtained a certificate (of public necessity and convenience) for a new route extending from Homestead (near the tip of the mainland on US Route 1, the Dixie Highway) and continuing to Key West on US-1 along the Overseas Highway. The FML began operating that route in 1936, while the road was still under construction, at first relying in part on two ferry- boat rides which spanned two gaps among the islands until 1938, when the last bridge became complete and open for traffic. Purchase by The Greyhound Corporation On the first day of 1946 The Greyhound Corporation bought the Florida Motor Lines (FML), then in the next month Greyhound renamed it as the Florida Greyhound Lines (FGL). The FGL was first a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent Greyhound firm, then on the last day of 1949 it became a division of The Greyhound Corporation (with an uppercase T, because the word \\"the\\" was an integral part of the legal name of the corporate entity). When Greyhound took over the FML (in 1946), FML ran along 2,750 route miles throughout the Sunshine State - from Jacksonville, Lake City, and Tallahassee - through Orlando, Tampa, and Saint Petersburg - to Miami and Key West - especially along US-1 on the East Coast between Jacksonville and Miami via Saint Augustine, Daytona Beach, Titusville, Melbourne, Vero Beach, Fort Pierce, Stuart, West Palm Beach, and Fort Lauderdale - including local suburban commuter service from Miami to Fort Lauderdale and to Homestead - throughout Florida along all the major routes - except one (in the southwest part of the peninsula), which was the exclusive territory of the Tamiami Trail Tours (a member of the Trailways trade association, then named as the National Trailways Bus System, and thus called also the Tamiami Trailways) - along US-41, the Tamiami Trail, from Tampa via Fort Myers and Naples to Fort Lauderdale and to Miami. By 1957 the Florida GL took part in major interlined through-routes (using pooled equipment in cooperation with other Greyhound companies) - that is, the use of through-coaches on through-routes running through the territories of two or more Greyhound regional operating companies - connecting Miami and Saint Petersburg with Los Angeles, Houston, New Orleans, Saint Louis, Chicago, Louisville, Nashville, Memphis, Birmingham, Atlanta, Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Toronto, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Boston, New York City, and Washington. Merger into Southeastern GL In October 1957 The Greyhound Corporation merged the Florida GL into the Southeastern GL (called also Southeastern, SEG, SEGL, or the SEG Lines), a neighboring operating company, based in Lexington, Kentucky. Thus ended the Florida GL. Beyond Florida GL After that merger the newly expanded SEG Lines served 12 states - from Cincinnati, Saint Louis, Memphis, and Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and Lake Charles (all three in Louisiana) - to Savannah (in Georgia) and Jacksonville and to Miami and Key West - from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Ohio River to and into the Gulf of Mexico. In November 1960 The Greyhound Corporation further merged the Atlantic GL (called also Atlantic or AGL), based in Charleston, West Virginia, yet another neighboring regional company, with - not into but rather with - the Southeastern GL - thereby creating the Southern Division of The Greyhound Corporation (called also the Southern GL), the third of four huge new divisions (along with Central, Eastern, and Western). Thus ended the Southeastern GL and the Atlantic GL, and thus began the Southern GL. Later (about 1966) The Greyhound Corporation reorganized again, into just two humongous divisions, named as the Greyhound Lines East (GLE) and the Greyhound Lines West (GLW); even later (about -70) it eliminated those two divisions, thereby leaving a single gargantuan undivided nationwide fleet. When the Southern GL came into existence, the headquarters functions became gradually transferred from Lexington, Kentucky, and Charleston, West Virginia, to Atlanta, Georgia; when GLE arose, many of those administrative functions became shifted from Atlanta to Cleveland, Ohio; eventually those functions migrated to Chicago, Illinois, then to Phoenix, Arizona, when (in 1971) The Greyhound Corporation moved its corporate headquarters from Chicago to a new building in Phoenix. In 1987 The Greyhound Corporation (the original Greyhound umbrella firm), which had become widely diversified far beyond transportation, sold its entire highway-coach operating business (its core bus business), to a new company, named as the Greyhound Lines, Inc., called also GLI, based in Dallas, Texas - a separate, independent, unrelated firm, which was the property of a group of private investors under the promotion of Fred Currey, a former executive of the Continental Trailways (later renamed as the Trailways, Inc., called also TWI, also based in Dallas), which was by far the largest member company in the National Trailways trade association. Later in 1987 the Greyhound Lines, Inc., the GLI, the new firm based in Dallas, further bought the Trailways, Inc., the TWI, its largest competitor, and merged it into the GLI. The lenders and the other investors of the GLI ousted Fred Currey (as the chief executive officer) after the firm went into bankruptcy in 1990. The GLI has continued to experience difficulties and lackluster performance under a succession of new owners and new executives - while continuing to reduce its level of service - by hauling fewer passengers aboard fewer coaches on fewer trips along fewer routes with fewer stops in fewer communities in fewer states - and by doing so on fewer days - that is, increasingly operating some trips less often than every day (fewer than seven days per week) - and by using fewer through-coaches, thereby requiring passengers to make more transfers (from one coach to another). After the sale to the GLI, The Greyhound Corporation changed its name to the Greyhound-Dial Corporation, then the Dial Corporation, then the Viad Corporation. [The contrived name Viad appears to be a curious respelling of the former name Dial - if one scrambles the letters D, I, and A, then turns the V upside down and regards it as the Greek letter lambda - Œõ - that is, the Greek equivalent of the Roman or Latin letter L.] The website of the Viad Corporation (http://www.viad.com) in September 2008 makes no mention of its corporate history or its past relationship to Greyhound (that is, its origin as The Greyhound Corporation).

Their sound was based in industrial rock and electronic pop, but with a hard edge and intensity similar to that of Nine Inch Nails or The Smashing Pumpkins. Massivivid was founded as a live side project to Deitiphobia. They released BrightBlur to critical acclaim, garnering a Dove Award. Background The band was born in 1996 as a project of Michael Knott's record label Ear Candy. They produced an EP that year and held their first show at the 1997 Cornerstone Festival. After producing a demo for the label they were picked up by Tattoo Records and produced their first album, BrightBlur. The name of the album refers to a line in C. S. Lewis's Letters to Malcolm where Lewis describes God as a \\"bright blur becoming brighter and blurier\\". Several other Lewis references appear on the album: to The Space Trilogy in \\"Deep Heaven\\", and quotes from Mere Christianity in \\"Unmade\\". Lyrically BrightBlur is centered on the struggles faced by humanity, specifically the contrasts that technology introduces to society. The album propelled Massivivid to take the 1998 Dove Award for \\"Hard Music Album.\\" The band toured heavily throughout 1999. The follow-up record, Dressed To The Nines...Armed To The Teeth, was released in 2002 on Accidental Sirens, an indie label partially owned by Allan Aguirre of Scaterd Few. A review in HM Magazine was heavily critical of the album, stating that its \\"fuzz-tone guitar based electro industrial\\" sound had at best the quality of a demo.

He was also the second Indian to be appointed a member of the Madras Legislative Council, succeeding V. Sadagopacharlu on his death. Gazulu Chetty was born in 1806 to a wealthy indigo merchant Sidhulu Chetty in Madras and was closely related to T. R. A. Thumboo Chetty and was a gajula balija chetty merchant. On completion of his initial education, Chetty entered the family trade and succeeded as a businessman. He entered politics and devoted money for social and philanthropic causes.  Early life  Gazulu Lakshminarasu Chetty was born in Periamet, Madras. His father, Sidhulu Chetty, owned a large indigo, dye, and cloth business, and was the first Indian member of the Madras Chamber of Commerce. Due to the poor schooling facilities available in India at the time, Chetty had little formal education. However, even as a boy, Chetty was interested in politics and took part in Debating Societies.  Business  On completion of his education, Chetty worked as an apprentice under his father, whose business was soon afterwards renamed Sidhulu Chetty and Co. The firm mainly dealt in handkerchiefs and soon grew into a thriving corporation. After Sidhulu Chetty's death, Gazulu Chetty inherited the firm and expanded its network. When the American Civil War broke out, cotton trade was temporarily suspended between the United States of America and other countries. Chetty took advantage of the situation and made huge profits by speculating on the price of cotton.  Anti-proselytization activities  During the mid-19th century, Christian missionaries indulged in open proselytisation in public institutions in the Madras Presidency. Their proselytisation activities were allegedly favoured by officials of the British government, who preferred native Christians to Hindus in higher appointments in order to entice Hindu Indians to embrace Christianity. The religious stance of the Madras government was frequently condemned by the Hindu population. Chetty supported their cause, and launched agitations against conversions. On 02 October 1844, Chetty founded the Crescent, the first Indian-owned newspaper in the Madras Presidency for the \\"amelioration of the condition of Hindus\\". But right from the beginning, the newspaper faced strict government opposition. An advertisement sent to the Madras government for insertion into the government publication Fort St George Gazette was rejected. Further, the government resolved to enact a law wherein a Hindu convert to Christianity would not lose his ancestral right to own property. This was severely condemned by the Hindu community of Madras who, under the leadership of Chetty, presented a memorial to the Governor on 09 April 1845. The government eventually withdrew its plans after prolonged discussions with the agitators. Around this time, the Madras government tried to introduce the Bible as a standard textbook for the students of the Madras University.Madras Tercentenary Commemoration Volume, Pg 348 Students were often questioned on points connected to Christian theology and were denied government posts if their knowledge of Christian texts was found wanting. Hindus of the Madras Presidency protested against these measures. Chetty presided over a protest meeting at the Pachaiyappa's College on 07 October 1846 in which it was resolved to send a memorandum to the Court of Directors of the British East India Company. Their efforts were successful and moves to introduce Christian theology in the curriculum were disbanded. In 1853, the government once again tried to introduce the Bible into the educational curriculum, but its efforts were thwarted by George and John Bruce Norton and Chetty.  Torture Commission  Peasants in various parts of the Madras Presidency were often subjected to cruel punishments if they failed to pay taxes on time. In 1854, with the assistance of H. Danby Seymour, a member of the British House of Commons, Chetty tried to induce the British authorities to investigate the methods of torture inflicted by the revenue collectors. In July 1854, Seymour tried to introduce a motion in the British Parliament. Sir Charles Wood, President of the India Board, responded by appointing a Torture Commission in September 1854, to investigate the conduct of revenue officials. Further pressure was induced by a petition signed by Chetty and other Indians, which was presented in the House of Lords on 14 April 1856.  Madras Native Association  Chetty established Madras Native Association in 1852 as a platform for educated Indians to protest against any injustice on the part of the British. It was the first Indian political organization in the Madras Presidency. Chetty served as its first president. Initially, his plans had been to establish a branch of the British Indian Association in Madras; however, a separate organisation was formed instead of a branch. P. Somasundaram Chettiar, a close associate of Chetty, served as the Secretary of the organization. The organization frequently locked horns with Christian missionaries. In 1852, the Madras Native Association presented a detailed list of grievances to the British Parliament. It was read out at the House of Lords on 25 February 1853 by the Earl of Ellenborough along with a petition from the inhabitants of Manchester that a minister and council for India be appointed and that they be made responsible directly to the British monarch. Chetty followed it up with another petition in 1855. This petition signed by over 14,000 people beseached the British Crown to take the administration of India directly under its control. These petitions resulted in the curtailment of the powers of the British East India Company eventually culminating in the transfer of sovereignty over India to the British Crown. The organisation was dissolved in 1867, one year before Chetty's death.  Honours  In 1861, Chetty was created Companion of the Star of India. Two years later, in 1863, he was nominated to the Madras Legislative Council on the death of V. Sadagopacharlu, the first Indian nominated to the Madras Legislative Council as per the Indian Councils Act 1861.  Death  Chetty died in poverty in 1868, having spent all his money in his social and political activities.

Under the supervision of president, publisher, and editor Bill Marks, Vortex was known for such titles as Dean Motter's Mister X, Howard Chaykin's Black Kiss, and Chester Brown's Yummy Fur, the last of which was a pioneer of alternative comics.Grant, Steven. \\"Permanent Damage,\\" Comic Book Resources (July 2, 2008). Accessed Nov. 1, 2008. Vortex also earned a reputation for publishing Canadian comic book creators such as Brown, Ty Templeton, Ken Steacy, and Jeffrey Morgan.  History Vortex was founded by 20-year-old high school dropout William P. \\"Bill\\" Marks of Toronto in 1982, with its first title being an anthology comic of the same name. Marks recalled, \\"[Comic books] had a lot of potential for growth that I could see. I could see a revolution happening. By this time Cerebus was doing extremely well. Elfquest was a runaway success in the bookstores and on the best-seller lists. Eclipse was just starting up and shortly thereafter Pacific Comics started to get quite big.\\" Vortex received good distribution in both the U.S. and Canada, and the company proved to be a major force in Canadian comics publishing throughout the 1980s. Vortex president Bill Marks in a 1986 promo photo. Early issues of Vortex were edited by Marks himself (who later described them as \\"quite primitive\\") and received limited exposure. In 1983 Vortex redesigned their approach, employed Ken Steacy as editor, and added new titles like Mister X and Templeton's Stig's Inferno, as well as Templeton & Klaus Schoenefeld's Kelvin Mace and Matt Howarth's Those Annoying Post Bros. The first four issues of Mister X featured work by the Los Bros Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez. In 1986‚Äì1987, Vortex again expanded, adding titles such as Ted McKeever's Transit, Bill White's Kaptain Keen & Kompany, Howarth's Savage Henry, and the two-issue Peter Milligan series Paradax. More significantly, Vortex began publishing a full-sized version of Chester Brown's mini-comic Yummy Fur, bringing Brown's surreal, black-humor stories to a wider audience. In 1990, Yummy Fur was nominated for a Harvey Award (Special Award for Humor category). Around this time Vortex also began publishing book-length graphic novels and compilations. Hard times hit the comics industry in 1988, however, and Vortex, like many other small publishers, suffered. The company was able to launch a few new titles in 1988, most notably Howard Chaykin's erotic thriller Black Kiss. Black Kiss became one of the most controversial North American comics of the late 1980s, due to the comic having the sort of explicit scenes of sex and violence unseen in most comics published at the time. In addition, Vortex's printer at the time, Ronald's Printing, refused to print the book due to its content.\\"Ronald's Printing Drops Black Kiss,\\" The Comics Journal #126 (January 1989), p. 32. To help retailers who had worries over selling what could be described as pornography, Vortex released the series sealed in a plastic bag. (This meant that casual browsers could not open the comic, or obviously see the internal content.) The publicity over Black Kiss didn't necessarily lead to strong sales, however, and by the end of 1988 Vortex's publishing schedule was erratic. Nonetheless, in January 1989, Vortex declared itself the third largest North American independent comic book publisher.\\"Vortex Pronounces Itself 3rd Largest Independent,\\" The Comics Journal #126 (Jan. 1989), p. 32. Reflecting publisher Marks' interest in car racing, Vortex survived until 1994 with an odd mixture of alternative titles and NASCAR-themed comics. (In 1991 and 1992 Vortex sponsored the 'Rookie of the Year' award in NASCAR's Grand National series; the 1991 prize was won by future superstar Jeff Gordon.) In May 1994 Matt Howarth officially moved Those Annoying Post Bros. to rival publisher Aeon.\\"Post Bros. Moves to √Üon,\\" The Comics Journal #168 (May 1994), p. 39. Shakeups in the comics industry that year hit the small press hard, and Vortex was no exception.\\"Comics Publishers Suffer Tough Summer: Body Count Rises in Market Shakedown,\\" The Comics Journal #172 (Nov. 1994), pp. 13‚Äì18. The last comic published by the company was Nocturnal Emissions #4, in March 1994. = Vortex Words + Pictures = After a brief career as a race car driver, publisher Marks went on to produce and direct numerous feature films. Vortex was re-branded by Marks in 2009 as Vortex Words + Pictures, and most recently Vortex has produced the George Hickenlooper film Casino Jack, starring Kevin Spacey, A Dark Truth with Andy Garcia and Forest Whitaker, Compulsion, starring Heather Graham (with cinematography by the legendary Vilmos Zsigmond), as well as Trailer Park Boys, and the indy hit Wolfcop.

More than 2,000 artists live there. Originally representing the avant-garde, the area now accommodates artists who paint in varying styles, ranging from the avant-garde to the academic. Sculptors and photographers also call the area home. The character of Songzhuang art colony The previously institutionalized and socially motivated art system produced many of the initial artists of the Chinese avant-garde. Were it not for the breakaway radicals of the last two decades, there simply would be no artistic community in Songzhuang, even if its present concerns are perhaps more of a monetary rather than a sociological nature. With a shift catering more towards the foreign market occurring in the 1980s, and the rise of the nouveau-riche at the beginning of the new century, today it is both the growing upper middle class in the cosmopolitan cities as well as foreign collectors and galleries that have become the prominent collectors of contemporary art in China, though one would have to be √ºber-cynical to suppose that the creative process has become wholly money-orientated to the modern artist living here. Far from it, in fact, a spirit of idealism, a ‚ÄúSongzhuang spirit‚Äù well and truly exists, and can even be examined from a historical perspective, where the roots of the artistic community can be traced back to Yuanmingyuan, the grounds of the Old Summer Palace in the north-east of Beijing. It was there that in the 1980s, like-minded free spirits congregated, living relatively poorly, though freely, escaping from the rat race and pressures of modern society. Artists arrived from all over China, celebrating a creative community and period of intense artistic exploration. Searching for tranquility A trend was established for artists to migrate away from the cities and to form their own communities such as the famous Beijing East Village. It brought far-reaching consequences for the Chinese avant-garde scene, as focus shifted away from the emerging capitalistic distractions and political pressures and opportunity was given in a tranquil environment for inner reflection and deep contemplation. However, problems arose once the community began attracting attention/notoriety from the media, gallery owners and other quarters, making artistic life more difficult as the once relaxed and free atmosphere came under closer scrutiny. The 1993 documentary ‚ÄòSeeking Dreams on the Verge‚Äô, by the director Zhang Jiarui, explores these issues. In an effort to preserve the spirit of the avant-garde, Fang Lijun, Zhang Huiping and Yue Minjun took the bold initiative in the spring of 1994 to relocate from Yuanmingyuan to the farming area of Songzhuang Township, located between the Chaobai and Wenyue rivers in Tong County, 20 km away from central Beijing. Liu Wei, Zhang Huiping, Wang Qiang and Gao Huijun were also in this first wave of artists to move. By the end of the year Yang Shaobin, Ma Ziheng, Zhang Jianqiang, Shao Zhenpeng, Liu Fenghua, Zhang Mingqiang, Wang Qiuren and Yao Junzhong joined them. With the accompaniment of renowned art critic Li Xianting, who later became known as ‚Äú the Godfather of Songzhuang ‚Äù, a quite formidable group of talent had succeeded in keeping the flame burning for Chinese avant-garde art. Here, the old style farmhouses, many with a small front courtyards or gardens, proved an ideal living and working space for the artists, more of whom would subsequently arrive following the official closure of the Yuanmingyuan community in 1995, this being in some part due to the latter‚Äôs proximity to Beijing‚Äôs university district. The communal artistic lifestyle and essence of the avant-garde was preserved and remained intact amongst the tribulations, albeit by transplantation to Songzhuang. Today About present day Songzhuang, native artist Cheng Da Qing said, ‚Äú The future of Chinese fine art is in Songzhuang ‚Äù. The artistic community now has over one thousand artists, centered mainly in the village of Xiaopu and spreading throughout Tuanli, Liuhe, Daxing, Xindian, Lamazhuang, Renzhuang, Beisi, Baimiao and Xiaoyang. Painters, sculptors, photographers, writers, conceptual/new media artists and dreamers live side-by-side, the largest gathering of contemporary artists certainly in China if not in the world. October 2005 saw the successful inauguration of an annual Songzhuang Art Festival, under the sponsorship of the Ministry of Culture, the Songzhuang Township Government, and the Songzhuang Art Promotion Society, when over six hundred works were shown along the 2 km main road in Xiaopu. The subsequent year‚Äôs festival used the newly constructed Songzhuang Art Museum and the East District Artistic Centre, strengthening Songzhuang's reputation as an arts community. Travel to and from Beijing is convenient with local transport or taxi capable of making the journey in under an hour.

It is fed by 13 tributary creeks and is long.  History  Weber Canyon is, historically, one of the more important canyons in Utah. The many streams that feed into the Weber River made the area attractive to prehistoric nomadic Native Americans, including the Shoshone and Ute tribes. The river and canyon were named for fur trapper John Henry Weber. Early explorers also included √âtienne Provost. In 1825, near the present-day community of Mountain Green, trappers of the British Hudson's Bay Company Snake Country Expedition, under the leadership of Peter Skene Ogden, had a confrontation with competing American trappers, under the leadership of Johnson Gardner. Gardner insisted that the British group was trespassing in United States Territory. Ogden kept the situation from becoming an international incident, although some of his men, including Canadian Antoine Godin, left his group to join Gardner. Emigrants travelling to California, including the Hudspeth, Bryant-Russell, and Young and Harlan parties, took the first wagons through Weber Canyon in 1846. The first road through the canyon was completed in 1855 by a group led by Thomas J. Thurston. In 1868, Brigham Young contracted with the Union Pacific Railroad to build part of the transcontinental railroad though Weber Canyon.PBS Article Attractions I-84 1000 Mile Tree in 1869 Interstate 84 now travels through Weber Canyon.

Written in the early 1950s but not published until four decades later, the book is a volume in the series of Oz books by L. Frank Baum and his successors.Paul Nathanson, Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America, Albany, NY, State University of New York Press, 1991.Suzanne Rahn, The Wizard of Oz: Shaping an Imaginary World, New York, Twayne, 1998.Michael O'Neal Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, Lawrence, KS, University Press of Kansas, 1997. Cosgrove Payes had published her first Oz book, The Hidden Valley of Oz, in 1951 with Reilly & Lee, the publisher of the Oz series since the time of Baum. The Wicked Witch of Oz would have been the next book in the series, and was intended for publication in 1954 but Reilly & Lee cancelled the project, since the Oz books were no longer selling well. The book remained unpublished until the International Wizard of Oz Club brought out the first edition in 1993, with illustrations by Eric Shanower.Eric Shanower, \\"The Wicked Witch, the Runaway, and Me,\\" The Baum Bugle, Vol.45 No. 3 (Winter 2001), pp. 13-23. The club declared it book 45 in the series. In the documentary, Oz: The American Fairyland, Payes states that she refused all requests to read her manuscript with \\"not 'til it's a book.\\" The Wicked Witch of Oz is followed by The Emerald Wand of Oz, a 2005 book by Sherwood Smith which was commissioned by the Baum Family Trust. Synopsis The title character is Singra, the Wicked Witch of the South. She awakens after sleeping for a century; her Magical Musical Snuffbox informs her of all the events she has missed in the last hundred years. Armed with this knowledge, Singra sets out to brew a spell of revenge against Dorothy Gale, the main agent of unwelcome change. Grudgingly rescuing a water nymph along the way, she is granted her wish to become impervious to water so that she will not melt like her late cousin, the Wicked Witch of the West. Singra waylays the Scarecrow, and tricks the girl she thinks is Dorothy into drinking her potion. Singra, however, has blundered: she has mistaken Trot for Dorothy, turning the little girl into a piece of green cheese. Dorothy sets out to rescue Trot, while Singra continues to seek her vengeance. Dorothy is aided by Percy, a giant talking white rat -- a character that Cosgrove Payes introduced in The Hidden Valley of Oz. In their efforts, they encounter a rubber band (that is, a band of rubber musicians), and an animated neon man named Leon -- Leon the Neon. The trio of Dorothy, Percy, and Leon confront a giant beehive, and Dorothy and Percy take flight on hummingbird wings. Singra enchants Dorothy into a statue, but her friends, Ozma, the Wizard, Jellia Jamb, and the rest, manage to unravel Singra's scheme. Singra drinks from the Forbidden Fountain, and is purged of her malicious intent along with her memory. Good triumphs in the end.

He was one of the New York City's more notorious career criminals to be arrested and convicted during the New York Police Department's four-year campaign against Manhattan's street gangs and other underworld figures between 1910 and 1914. In June 1911, he was tried and convicted for second-degree murder of two fellow Gas Housers during a gunfight at one of their hangouts at a saloon between Twenty-Second Street and Third Avenue. He had arrived at Pickett's saloon bringing a young woman with him, this having been generally prohibited in case of members being identified, and was quickly confronted by fellow members William Lysaght, John Tivnan and John Stephenson. He denied having a weapon when asked, the three men not finding one on him when searched, and began arguing over his violation of the gang's orders. All four went outside when asked by the bartender and, once out of the bar, the three men apparently attacked Jones. Falling to the ground, Jones pulled out a revolver he had concealed under his arm and fired at his attackers. Lysaght was shot and died at the scene while Tivnan was shot in the shoulder. Jones was arrested soon after, Lysaght identifying him as the man who shot before dying of his wounds at a nearby hospital. This was a rare occurrence for a gang member, even underworld rivals, to name the men responsible to authorities. After making his statement, Lysaght reportedly turned to a nurse and said \\"Just watch that bum suffer. He deserves it.\\" Jones immediately became one of several gang members and underworld figures to be prosecuted by Frank Moss and Edward R. O'Malley of the District Attorney's office. In the same week Jones was sentenced, high-profile criminals such as Albert Rooney, Biff Ellison, and Johnny Spanish were also on trial. While Jones was awaiting trial at The Tombs, he composed two letters which he sent to another gang member whose name was withheld. The first said simply, \\"You know I did the shooting. Rosa was there and saw me when the gang beat me up. I am only sorry I did not drop a few more of them.\\" The second was a love letter apparently written to the unidentified Rosa. It was the last letter that resulted in his conviction, particularly the line \\"I am getting along fine. There is nothing like a vacation to brace you up.\\" While on the stand, angrily swore that he would kill the man responsible for turning the letters over to the District Attorney's office if he ever got out of prison. Among the witnesses he threatened during the trial, he also called out to John Tivnan when he appeared in court and said \\"If I had gotten you, I would have been better satisfied.\\" Jones was reprimanded by Judge Warren W. Foster and sentenced to serve between 20 years to life imprisonment.

Early life Wachs was born in New York City and raised in Brooklyn and Queens. She attended Queens College (part of the City University of New York), and played on the school's tennis team. She later attended Columbia University, where she wrote a thesis on women's antiwar poetry for her master's degree in English literature. She married Stanley Wachs while in her 20s, and moved to Boston in the late 1960s; the two divorced after 16 years. Wachs had always had an interest in music, but her serious passion for the field started after her husband had signed up for recorder lessons but could not participate and Wachs took his place to avoid wasting the money that had been laid out for the course. Music career It was through happenstance that Wachs first discovered Sephardic music in the late 1970s, when she heard the Sephardic folk song \\"Skalerika de Oro\\", and realized that this was part of a tradition of Jewish music that she had never heard before, despite the fact that she had spent her whole life listening to Jewish music from around the world. Wachs told The Boston Globe in the 1990s that \\"It was entirely Spanish, unlike anything I had ever heard, and yet it was unmistakably Jewish and totally reminiscent of everything I had ever heard\\". The centuries-old tunes of the Jews of Spain became her focus for the subsequent three decades, as she sought to share her love of Sephardi music with people worldwide through the Boston-based quartet Voice of the Turtle that she founded in 1978(together with Derek Burrows, Lisle Kulbach, and Jay Rosenberg) and led as its artistic director. The New York Times reviewed Voice of the Turtle's 1990 release From the Shores of the Golden Horn: Music of the Spanish Jews of Turkey, describing the album's 19 songs as a \\"fascinating cultural blend\\" of Arabic, Spanish and (close to) Eastern European music, with a \\"powerfully expressive repertory will leave no one unmoved.\\"Staff. \\"HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES\\", The New York Times, February 18, 1990.

Early years  Priyadarshi was born into a Hindu Bhumihar Brahmin family in Vaishali district, Bihar, India. He comes from a family of bureaucrats, political leaders, and eminent scholars. He has two sisters, one is an attorney and the other, Shilpa Shukla, is a famed actress in the Indian film industry. He entered the monastery at the age of ten in Rajgir, India near the ancient Nalanda University at his own volition. He is a Buddhist monk from India ordained by the Dalai Lama, who is his preceptor and mentor. He also studied under the guidance of Sakya Trizin, Drikung Chhetsang, Kushok Bakula Rinpoche and Samdhong Rinpoche, and received meditation training from Drubwang Rinpoche. Priyadarshi trained in India, Nepal, and Japan in Indo-Tibetan and Japanese Buddhism, and is known for his love of Sanskrit Buddhist literature. He also spent several years studying Vedanta and Kashmir Shaivism in Kolkata, and maintained close relations with the Ramakrishna Mission Ashram. He attended Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies and the Sanskrit University in Varanasi, India, and graduated from Le Moyne College, Summa Cum Laude, with a bachelor's degree as an integral honors scholar studying philosophy, physics, and religious studies with minors in international relations and Japanese. In 2003 he completed his graduate studies in comparative philosophy of religion at Harvard University. In 2002 he was appointed as the first Buddhist chaplain at MIT.  Teaching career  Priyadarshi lectures internationally on Buddhist philosophy, ethics, leadership, and socio-political issues. In 2009, Priyadarshi founded the Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT to design and disseminate innovative programs on teaching secular ethics and human values. The decision to name this center was based on the Dalai Lama's commitment to human wellbeing and the fact that he was named as a top global leader in a survey in 2008. The Center for Ethics has 6 Nobel Peace Laureates as its founding members and its programs run in 5 countries while poised for a global reach. Priyadarshi was also involved with designing a Vocal Vibrations exhibit with Tod Machover, Neri Oxman, and David Edwards. Tenzin Priyadarshi at Dalai Lama's visit to Boston 2012 He is regarded as an influential teacher in the Rim√© (non-sectarian) movement within Tibetan Buddhism, like his predecessor. He founded the Prajnopaya Institute to create an avenue for critical study and practice of Buddhist philosophy within Europe and North America. To promote contemplative programs in North America, he founded Bodhimarga, a CyberDharma community with satellite locations in various parts of North America and Asia.  Ethics and Empathy Efforts  In 2015, Priyadarshi became a Directors' Fellow at MIT Media Lab and directed the ethics initiative (2015-2019) to help foster critical conversations on ethics and emerging technologies with focus on AI and CRISPR in particular. Through this he made efforts to promote research and program design to facilitate broader and deeper understanding of ethics and empathy adherence. He coined the expression \\"ethics as optimization\\" to convey a distinctive approach to ethics learning. Turing Prize winner Edward Feigenbaum said that he was encouraged by this novel \\"ethics as optimization\\" approach to Cognitive Computing and AI as presented by Priyadarshi at a summit in Napa, California. Priyadarshi along with Joi Ito and Reid Hoffman commenced plans to create Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund to promote ethical framework and transparency in AI related developments. The fund also explores AI for Social Good models. The fund is also supported by Pierre Omidyar and the Knight Foundation and others. Primary institutions overseeing this work are MIT Media Lab and the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. Speaking during a private gathering of lawmakers and business leaders, Priyadarshi suggested \\"lack of empathy as a public health issue.\\" He encouraged the audience to begin thinking of nurturing ethics and empathy (as well as its \\"upgraded forms\\" such as kindness and compassion) as civic responsibility without which any democratic system is at threat. \\"Any systems thinker working on wellbeing of the individual, organizations and societies cannot ignore ethics and empathy framework,\\" he proposed.  Conflict resolution and peace efforts  Having been exposed to the dangers of religious fanaticism and violence early on, Priyadarshi has been instrumental in conflict resolution processes in India and Sri Lanka. He has been actively involved in inter-religious dialogue with religious leaders such as Pope John Paul II, Desmond Tutu, and Pope Benedict XVI. He has made his admiration for Francis of Assisi quite public and travels to Italy frequently to engage in spiritual dialogue with Christian monastic communities. He actively promotes contemplative learning beyond religious boundaries and talks frequently with Thomas Keating, founder of Contemplative Outreach. He received a Felicitation for his work at the 2007 SAARC Interfaith Conclave in New Delhi, India. He delivered the Reverend Daniel Berrigan SJ Peace Makers Lecture in 2013 at Le Moyne College, New York. He also received the Distinguished Alumni Honors from Harvard University in April 2013 recognizing his contributions.  Humanitarian projects  Following the disasters caused by the 2005 tsunami, Priyadarshi founded the Prajnopaya Foundation to develop innovative and sustainable ways to alleviate suffering in developing countries. The foundation has been active in health care endeavors in India, including systematic methods to curtail tuberculosis and bring health care to rural areas. He was a project advisor to a team of architects from MIT, Harvard Graduate School of Design, and University of Cambridge to develop Tsunami Safe(r) Houses, low cost high resistant homes for families in Sri Lanka. In December 2009, Priyadarshi was felicitated as \\"Icon of Bihar\\" at the Bihar Conclave. He is the youngest person to receive this honor.  Other activities  Priyadarshi is a Tribeca Disruptive Fellow. He was a 2018 Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. He served as the founding member and director of the Vishwa Shanti Stupa (World Peace Pagoda Projects) in New Delhi and Sarnath (Varanasi), India. He serves as trustee for The National Shrine of Saint Francis of Assisi and an advisor to the Renaissance Project in San Francisco, California. He is also actively involved in ongoing dialogue between Buddhism, meditation and neuroscience.  Media and Publication  Priyadarshi released an album of select Buddhist prayers in Sanskrit at the request of his students. The collection entitled \\"Revival: Sanskrit Buddhist Chants\\" was done in collaboration with a symphony in Mexico. Priyadarshi said \\"it was an impromptu fun collaboration to expose people to the power of Sanskrit language and chants. It has no entertainment value.\\" This collection is now available on YouTube and other channels. Flutist and Musician Paul Horn said \\"The Venerable Tenzin Priyadarshi's soft powerful chanting, in a warm lush instrumental setting, offers a deep spiritual experience for the listener. A beautiful recording.\\" Krishna Das adds \\"With a great depth of Devotion that is lit with Wisdom, Tenzin Priyadarshi creates a beautiful offering of Ancient Buddhist Prayers.\\" In 2020, Priyadarshi released his book \\"Running Toward Mystery: The Adventure of an Unconventional Life\\" with Random House US. Sting calls it \\"a necessary and captivating narrative of spiritual courage and truth seeking far beyond the veil of our contemporary delusions.\\" Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning author of The Emperor of All Maladies, Siddhartha Mukherjee says ‚ÄúRunning Toward Mystery is not merely a book, but an experience, a biography, a formula for living, and a manifesto for a new kind of exploration of life. Tenzin Priyadarshi writes with the extraordinary conviction and grace that can only come from fulfillment. This book produces a kind of joy‚Äîand a nudge towards curiosity‚Äîthat only few books can provide. It is, at the same time, a pathway and a journey. I could not put it down.‚Äù  References   External links  * The Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT * Tsunami Safe(r) Houses * Prajnopaya * Bodhimarga * The website of Venerable Tenzin Priyadarshi * Vishwa Shanti Stupa Project * The National Shrine of Saint Fransis of Assisi Category:Tibetan Buddhist teachers Category:Rim√© Lamas Category:Tibetan Buddhists from India Category:People from Bihar Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Le Moyne College alumni Category:Indian Buddhists Category:Indian chief executives ","title":"Tenzin Priyadarshi"},{"id":"20009396","text":"Artau I ( or Artaldus, or Artaldo) was the Count of Pallars Sobir√† from 1049 until his death in or around 1081.{{efnArtaus sometimes referred to himself as \\"margrave\\", as in comes et marchio (count and margrave) in a charter of 1059. His reign was characterised by ceaseless wars and litigations with his more powerful cousin and neighbour Raymond IV of Pallars Juss√†. Artau was the second son of William II of Pallars Sobir√† and his wife Stephanie, a daughter of Ermengol I of Urgell and Tetberga, who was related to either the Counts of Provence or Forez. His father died in 1035 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Bernard II. When he died in 1049, Artau became count. Artau married twice. Before September 1050, he married Constance, whose parentage is unknown. On or before 27 January 1058,Artau took as his second wife, Lucia (Ll√∫cia), daughter of Bernard I of La Marche and thus a sister of Almodis, the wife of Raymond Berengar I of Barcelona. He granted control of two castles to the count of Barcelona and four to his new wife on top of her dowry. She bore him three sons: Artau II, his eldest son and heir; Ot, who became Bishop of Urgell; and William. She and Artau could also have been the parents of daughter named Maria. In relation to his military operations both defensive and offensive directed against the county of Pallars Juss√†, Artau constructed several new castles: Montcort√©s, Peramea, Bresca, and Ba√©n. In 1064 Artau and Raymond of Pallars Juss√† reached their first of several convenientia (agreements). Artau was forced to grant a castle to Raymond as a pledge to hold future negotiations. A second agreement of this sort was reached on 30 May 1067: Artau ceded the monastery of Santa Maria de Lavaix and quitclaimed several villages (villae) to Raymond. Around 1080 a series of convenientia were made between Raymond and either Artau I or Artau II. This time Raymond gave up the right to control (potestas) the castle of Talarn to two of his chief magnates, Pere Ramon I d'Erill and Mir Guirreta II de Bellera, while Artau granted the same of his castle of Sal√°s to two of his men, Guillem Guitard de Vallferrera and Ramon Bernat. Both castles stood not far apart on opposite sides of the Noguera Pallaresa where it defined the border of the two counties.The final settlement and exchange of castles took place in the presence of Sancho Ram√≠rez, King of Aragon. At the same time this Artau, whether father or son, came to an agreement with the king over a prior dispute. Artau was a patron of the monastery of Santa Maria de Gerri. In a surviving pre-1070 charter dated to 18 June, Artau donated property to Santa Maria.Condes de Pallars-Subir√† at Foundations for Medieval Genealogy: Medieval Lands Project. In September 1050 he and Constance made a donation; on 22 June 1059 he and Lucia; and he and Lucia again on 22 April 1068. Two further donations, of 8 July 1081 and 13 April 1082, throw into question the date of Artau's death and the succession of his son; the second donation was witnessed by another Artau, but this may be Artau III. Artau II was using the comital title as early as 1080.).

As a replacement for the team's M1Bs from 1966, the Chevrolet-powered M6A's improved design earned Bruce McLaren and his team their first of multiple Can-Am championships. After the M6As were replaced by the M8A in preparation for 1968, McLaren and technical partner Trojan‚ÄìTauranac Racing developed the M6B which was sold to customers for use in Can-Am as well as other racing series. The M6 name was later used in the development of a closed-cockpit sports car for the 24 Hours of Le Mans and known as the M6GT. The company's plan to homologate it for the FIA's Group 4 regulations was, however, never completed, and only a few M6GT prototypes were finished by McLaren and Trojan. Two M6GTs were later converted to road cars, one of which became Bruce McLaren's personal transport. Development Bruce McLaren gathered several designers to develop the M6A during the off-season in early 1967. Along with McLaren himself, Robin Herd, Gordon Coppuck, Tyler Alexander, and Don Beresford all worked on the layout of the M6A's chassis and bodywork. The car featured the first monocoque chassis constructed by McLaren, while the bodywork was specifically shaped to increase downforce suited for the Can-Am circuits. McLaren's team also expanded into engine development, creating a fuel injection system for their Chevrolet V8s. Another addition to the team was a new tire supplier, with Goodyear replacing Firestone in exchange for a testing and development program. The first M6A was completed in spring 1967, and brought to the nearby Goodwood Circuit for testing. Bruce McLaren Motor Racing carried out over 2000 miles of testing at the circuit in preparation for the upcoming Can-Am season, tuning the car as well as gathering data for Goodyear's use. As two further M6As were completed, the team shipped the cars to North America to prepare for the opening race of the season. A final addition to the cars was a coat of orange paint. This new McLaren Orange color scheme would eventually become synonymous with Bruce McLaren and the team. A McLaren M6GT coup√© After the retirement of the M6As, McLaren entrusted Trojan with constructing duplicates which could be sold to customers. These M6Bs were nearly identical to the M6As but were sold without an engine. Several other M6Bs were also modified to fit closed-cockpit bodywork. Racing history The 1967 Can-Am season began in September at Road America. Bruce McLaren's M6A qualified on pole position with a new track record, while teammate Denny Hulme's car led once the race began. Although McLaren's car suffered an oil leak and failed to finish, Hulme was able to earn the car's first victory. The next two events had the team running away from the opposition, with Hulme and McLaren finishing first and second consecutively. The roles were, however, swapped over the next two races as it was McLaren who won on both occasions, but problems with Hulme's car allowed McLaren to take the lead in the points standings going into the final round. For the finale at the Stardust Grand Prix, problems with the Chevrolet motors led to blown engines and neither car reaching the finish. However, with their performance over the season, Bruce McLaren secured the 1967 Can-Am Challenge Cup, while Hulme was ranked second only three points behind. As Bruce McLaren Motor Racing moved to developing the M8A, the M6Bs began to be delivered to customers for the 1968 season. Several of the M6As were also sold with Roger Penske purchasing one car for defending United States Road Racing Championship (USRRC) champion Mark Donohue. Donohue won several USRRC events that season and earned his second championship. Donohue also later won a race in Can-Am, beating the newer McLaren M8As. After the cancellation of the USRRC after 1968, the M6As and M6Bs continued to be used into the early 1970s but none were able to achieve victory against their newer competitors. The M6A and M6B also featured prominently in the early years of the Australian Sports Car Championship (ASCC). Driving a McLaren M6B fitted with a 5.0 litre Repco V8 engine, John Harvey won the 1971 and 1972 championships.

They were the most westerly band of those that hunted in southern Victoria Island. They were generally located on the north shore of Dolphin and Union Strait, north of Cape Bexley, and south of Prince Albert Sound, on Victoria Island. Though they migrated seasonally both north and south for hunting, fishing, and trade, they were unaware that Victoria Island was an island. Ethnology Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered the Hanergmiut on May 17, 1910. At the time, the Haneragmiut numbered approximately 40 people. Seasonally, a few Haneragmiut hunted and traded to the south on the mainland with another Cape Bexley subgroup, the Akuliakattagmiut, while other Haneragmiut migrated as far north as Tahiryuak Lake to hunt caribou with the Kanianermiut. The Ekalluktogmiut were situated to the east of the Haneragmiut. After his return to Seattle and New York City in 1912, Stefansson made the Haneragmiut, Kanhirgmiut and Nuwukpagmiut famous, referring to them as \\"Blond Eskimos\\". Later studies by anthropologist Diamond Jenness showed that the subgroups of Akuliakattagmiut, Haneragmiut, Kogluktogmiut, Pallirmiut, Puiplirmiut, and Uallirgmiut {also known as the Kanianermiut} were mixed through intermarriage and by family shifting.

Written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, the title is retrospectively applied; the episodes were not originally identified separately. The episode is a parody of the 1957 film 12 Angry Men. Plot Hancock and Sid are members of a jury in the trial of a man - John Harrison Peabody - accused of stealing some jewellery. Hancock has been elected jury foreman and continually interrupts the proceedings. He asks if the jury can see the evidence for a second time, to which the judge agrees. Hancock tries on one of the exhibits - a diamond ring - but is unable to remove it. Numerous attempts to remove the ring prove futile, so he and the other jury members have to retire for their deliberations with the ring still stuck on Hancock's finger. In the jury room, Hancock finds he is the only jury member voting for a not guilty verdict, the other members being keen to bring the case to a conclusion as quickly as possible. Sid is also in favour of finding the accused guilty, before changing his mind when Hancock mentions that the jurors are being paid 30 shillings a day for their services. By using appeals to sentiment, emotional blackmail and talk of the fine tradition of British justice (\\"Does Magna Carta mean nothing to you? Did she die in vain?\\") Hancock gradually manages to persuade all the other jurors to change their minds in favour of a not guilty verdict. One of the last jurors to be persuaded only reluctantly follows the consensus, and in doing so warns Hancock that the freed man - if he is actually guilty - might once again embark on a life of burgling houses, possibly including Hancock's. The juror's words give Hancock second thoughts, and he has an abrupt change of opinion in favour of finding the accused guilty. The rest of the jury immediately do likewise (though Sid only does so on condition of being paid 30 shillings compensation by each of the other jury members, to compensate for \\"lost earnings\\") and they leave to deliver their verdict to the court, reflecting on how the values of British justice have triumphed. Back in the courtroom, Hancock announces the jury's verdict. As they are about to leave, the judge reminds Hancock that he has still not returned the diamond ring that was stuck on his finger. Hancock realises he has lost the ring, possibly when he shook hands with the other jurors. The episode ends with all twelve jury members appearing in the dock accused of theft, with Hancock - still acting as spokesperson for the ex-jurors - pleading guilty on behalf of all of them.

Description Bridal Veil Falls are a two-pronged waterfall.\\"Bridal Veil Falls in Telluride, Colorado\\". AmazingColorado.com. Retrieved on 17 November 2008. The area around Bridal Veil Falls is subject to avalanche and controlled shelling to create controlled slides is an event popular with spectators and photographers. Reaching the top of the falls in winter can be a precarious venture, even for the experienced family that lives there. A hiking trail continues on past the falls to mountain meadows and mountain lakes above . History In 1978, Jeff Lowe and Mike Wiess became the first to summit the falls, the effort having been broadcast on ABC‚Äôs Wide World of Sports. The falls were opened briefly in the 1990s to ice climbers, but the area is private property so climbing has been legally prohibited since. Referred to as a \\"mega classic\\" and \\"the most difficult waterfall ice climb in North America\\", some climbers have trespassed to take a crack at the imposing and dangerous climb, but a land purchase proposal and an insurance deal may change the situation. Climbers were excited by the proposal in 2008 that would reopen the falls to climbers. =Electric power generation= The AC electric generator at Bridal Veil Falls is one of the oldest still operating in the US A hydro-electric alternating current power plant, the Smuggler-Union Hydroelectric Power Plant built in 1907, sits on top of the falls, originally used to power the Smuggler-Union Mine. It was eventually owned by the Idarado Mining Company who decommissioned it in 1953. It was leased from Idarado by local resident Eric Jacobson in 1988 who restored the power house to operation in 1991 and lived in the residence with his family until 2010 when he gave up the lease. The Idarado Mining Company now owns and operates the power plant and sells the power. The power generated provides about 25 percent of Telluride's demand for electricity and the plant still contains its original 2300 volt Westinghouse Electric AC generator, one of the oldest AC generators still in operation. In 1979 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The island trevally is common through the tropical regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging from Mozambique and the Seychelles in the west to Hawaii and the Revillagigedo Islands in the central and eastern Pacific. The species is almost completely absent from the continental shelves, instead inhabiting offshore islands, where it is found in lagoons and on reef systems. It is a moderately large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 75 cm and 6.6 kg in weight, and is distinguishable by its angular snout and yellow spots, as well as more detailed anatomical features. The island trevally often moves in small schools, preying on a variety of small fishes and crustaceans. It is of moderate importance to fisheries throughout its range, often taken by trawls, hook-and-line, and various inshore netting methods, and is sold fresh or salted at market. Taxonomy and naming The island trevally is classified within the genus Carangoides, a group of fish commonly called jacks and trevallies. Carangoides falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, the Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. The species was first scientifically described by the American ichthyologists Jordan and Gilbert in 1881 based on a specimen taken from the Revillagigedo Islands, which was designated to be the holotype. They named this new species Caranx orthogrammus, placing the species in a closely related genus of jacks, but this was later changed to Carangoides after further revision of the family had occurred. The species was independently redescribed a number of times, with the fish placed in subspecies status twice. John Treadwell Nichols considered his C. ferdau jordani to be separate from C. orthogrammus, or possibly a subspecies of the blue trevally, C. ferdau, and was later treansferred to C. jordani. It was also considered a subspecies or a synonym of the bludger, C. gymnostethoides, and was also renamed as C. nitidus. The fish is now considered a separate species, with the subspecies names and the later names rendered invalid under the ICZN naming rules. The species is commonly known as island trevally in reference to its preferred offshore habitat, with the names thicklip trevally and false bluefin trevally also used as descriptive names. The specific epithet means \\"straight lined\\" in Greek. Description The fleshy lips of the island trevally are a distinguishing feature.The island trevally is a moderately large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 75 cm and 6.61 kg in weight. The species is quite similar to C. ferdau, although the prominent yellow spots serve as a quick identifying feature. The island trevally has a compressed oblong shaped body with the dorsal profile more convex than the ventral profile and the snout usually being slightly rounded. The dorsal fin is in two sections, the first consisting of eight spines and the second of one spine and 28 to 31 soft rays, with the lobe of the second dorsal fin being slightly falcate in younger individuals, but is always shorter than the head length. The anal fin has two detached spines followed by one spine attached to 24 to 26 soft rays, while the pelvic fin has one spine attached to 21 or 22 soft rays. The lateral line has a very slight anterior arch, with the intersection of the straight and curved sections between the 15th and 19th soft rays of the dorsal fin. The curved section contains 96 to 106 scales, while the straight section contains 20 to 30 scales and 21 to 28 scutes. The breast is scaleless ventrally until the origin of pelvic fins, often with a small patch of prepelvic scales. Laterally, this naked area of the breast is separated from the naked base of the pectoral fins by a moderate band of scales. The lips are notably fleshy in adults, with both jaws containing narrow bands of villiform teeth which become obsolescent with age. There are 28 to 32 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae. The island trevally is a pale blue-green above, becoming more silvery below, with adults having several quite large, elliptical, yellow to brassy spots scattered on their bodies close to the midline. Nine 9 or 10 dark vertical bars may be on the body from the head to the caudal peduncle. The soft dorsal, anal, and caudal fins are a pale brownish- to brilliant-blue, with all other fins being pale green to hyaline in colour. Distribution and habitat Anglers catch of island trevally The island trevally is distributed throughout the offshore waters of the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, it ranges from Mozambique on the east coast of Africa north to the Gulf of Aden, but has not been recorded further north until India and Sri Lanka. Its range extends throughout Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and northern Australia in the eastern Indian Ocean. In the Pacific, the species has been recorded from Taiwan, Japan, and Hawaii to the Revillagigedo Islands off Mexico in the eastern Pacific, as well as many Pacific islands. As the species common name partly suggests, the island trevally very rarely is found on the continental shelves, instead living around offshore islands formed by volcanic activity or isolated slivers of continental material remaining from continental drifting. These islands are often quite large, and have most of the geographical features of the continental environment, including beaches, reefs, lagoons, and even estuaries. The island trevally is known from all of these habitats, as well as slightly deeper seaward reefs up to 50 m deep. In Hawaii, the species is less frequently found inside protected bays, and more often slightly further offshore presumably due to competition with other species. The island trevally is one of a number of carangid species known to be attracted to man-made fish- attracting devices, which are installed to aggregate fish for anglers. Biology and fishery The island trevally moves both as a solitary individual or in small schools through its habitat, with the species often accounting for large proportions of an areas immediate biomass when moving in schools. The species' diet consists of small fish species and crustaceans, with studies on their exact diet composition finding these fish take different species and different ratios of prey throughout their range. A study conducted in New Caledonia found the species consumed 98% fish, with only 1% crabs and shrimp, while a large study in Hawaii found it took 64.7% crustaceans including crabs, shrimp, and stomatopods, while taking only 32.3% fish consisting of gobies and benthic fishes of the order Scorpaeniformes, as well as 2% cephalopods. In this setting, the major carangid species in the region apparently alter their diets to reduce interspecific competition, but change this partitioning elsewhere in their range where they co-occur. Reproduction and growth are poorly studied in the species, with only a general estimate of spawning timing of March in the Solomon Islands. The island trevally is of moderate importance to fisheries throughout its range, often taken by hook and line, trawls, and various types of artisanal gear. The species is generally only caught as bycatch, with catch numbers often very small in comparison to the target species of the fishery. Throughout most of its range, catch statistics are not kept. The species is marketed fresh, dry, or salted, and is considered a good table fish.

He was a long-time essayist for Time magazine and PBS NewsHour. He is currently the Distinguished Professor of English and Writing at Stony Brook University. Career Roger Rosenblatt began writing professionally in his mid-30s, when he became literary editor and a columnist for The New Republic. Before that, he taught at Harvard, where he earned his Ph.D. In 1965‚Äì66 he was a Fulbright Scholar in Ireland. At age 25, he became the director of Harvard's freshman writing department. At age 28, he held the Briggs‚ÄìCopeland appointment in the teaching of writing, and was Allston‚ÄìBurr Senior Tutor, and later, Master of Dunster House. At age 29 he was the youngest House Master in Harvard's history. At Harvard, apart from creative writing, he taught Irish drama, modern poetry, and the university's first course in African American literature. In 2005 he was the Edward R. Murrow visiting professor at Harvard. Before turning solely to literary work, he was a columnist on The Washington Post, during which time Washingtonian Magazine named him Best Columnist in Washington, and an essayist for the NewsHour on PBS. With Jim Lehrer and Robert MacNeil, he created the first essays ever done on television. In 1979 he became an essayist for Time magazine, a post that he held on and off until 2006. He continued to do TV essays for the NewsHour until that same year. His essays for Time won two George Polk Awards, awards from the Overseas Press Club, the American Bar Association, and others. His NewsHour essays won the Peabody Award and the Emmy. His Time cover essay, \\"A Letter to the Year 2086\\" was chosen for the time capsule placed inside the Statue of Liberty at its centennial. He argued in a 1999 article for Time that guns should be banned. In 2006 Rosenblatt left his positions at Time and the NewsHour and gave up journalism to devote his time to the writing of memoirs, novels and extended essays. His first novel, Lapham Rising, was a national bestseller. Making Toast was a New York Times bestseller. The memoir was a book-length version of an essay he wrote for the New Yorker magazine, on the death of his daughter, in 2008. He followed Making Toast with Unless It Moves the Human Heart, a book on the art and craft of writing, which was also a New York Times bestseller, as was Kayak Morning, a meditation on grief. The Boy Detective: A New York Childhood was published in 2013. The Book of Love: Improvisations on That Crazy Little Thing was published in January 2015. His most recent novel, Thomas Murphy, was published in January, 2016. In total, he is the author of 19 books, which have been published in 14 languages. They include the national bestseller Rules for Aging; three collections of essays; and Children of War, which won the Robert F. Kennedy Book Prize and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. He has also written six off-Broadway plays, including Ashley Montana Goes Ashore in the Caicos, and The Oldsmobiles, both produced at the Flea Theater. His comic one-man show, Free Speech in America, which he performed at the American Place Theater, was cited by the New York Times as one of the 10 best plays of 1991. In 2017, it was announced that his bestselling novel, Lapham Rising, would be adapted for the screen, with Rosenblatt penning the script. The film, to be directed by Charlie Kessler, is set to begin production in 2019. In his recent books, Rosenblatt has experimented with a form of narrative that connects section to section, without chapter demarcations, dismissing chronological time, and mixing fact and fiction. The effect he seeks is akin to movements in music. In his review of The Boy Detective in the New York Times Book Review, Pete Hamill compared Rosenblatt's style to that of \\"a great jazz musician...moving from one emotion to another, playing some with a dose of irony, others with joy, and a few with pain and melancholy (the blues, of course). Alone with the instrument of his art, he seems to be hoping only to surprise himself.\\" In 2008 he was appointed Distinguished Professor of English and Writing at Stony Brook University, where he currently teaches. In 2009 he was selected as one of three finalists for the Robert Cherry Award, given to the best university teacher in the country. Seven universities have awarded him honorary doctorates. In November 2015, Rosenblatt received the 2015 Kenyon Review Award for Literary Achievement. In June, 2016, he was awarded the President's Medal of the Chautauqua Institution for the artistic and moral quality of his body of work.

The road connects South Dakota on the east with Yellowstone National Park on the west. It is mostly a two lane surface road except for several sections that it shares with Interstate 90.  Route description  US 14 north towards Devils Tower While the official western terminus of the road is at the Eastern gate of Yellowstone National Park there is an unsigned section within the park itself starting at a junction with U.S. Route 89 and U.S. Route 287 at West Thumb and following the northern shore of Yellowstone Lake. From the park US 14 is co-signed with U.S. Route 16 and U.S. Route 20. The roads lead east out of the Absaroka Range and down the Shoshone River valley to Cody. Here, U.S. Route 14 Alternate (US 14A) splits north toward Powell, while US 14/16/20 continues east across the Bighorn Basin to Greybull. At Greybull, US 16 and US 20 go south, while US 14 travels east to Shell, and the western slope of the Big Horn Mountains. The road ascends a windy path through steep Shell Canyon and rejoins US 14A at the top of the range at Burgess Junction. The road is designated as Bighorn Scenic Byway between Shell and Dayton on the eastern side of the mountain range. On the east side of the Bighorns, the road merges with Interstate 90 and travels southeast to Sheridan, Wyoming. From Sheridan, the road continues east, rejoining with US Route 16 near Clearmont. The roads travel across the Powder River Country to Gillette, Wyoming where it joins again with Interstate 90 to Moorcroft. From here, it diverges north from Interstate 90 briefly to junction with Wyoming Highway 24 with access to Devils Tower National Monument. US 14 turns south and rejoins Interstate 90 which it follows to the eastern border of Wyoming and South Dakota.  History  US 14 was originally planned to stop in Wall, South Dakota. In 1936, the road was extended to the Wyoming border and US 16 was rerouted through Newcastle and the old US 16 was re designated as US 14. Prior to 1940, US 14 followed the route currently serviced by US 14A through Lovell and Powell. In 1940, the highway took over Wyoming Highway 520 between Burgess Junction and Greybull, and the old road was renamed Wyoming Highway 14. Due to confusion, it was recommissioned as US 14A in 1965. In the 1960s portions of the highway in the eastern part of the state became Interstate 90.  Major intersections   Related route  U.S. Highway 14 Alternate is an alternate route for U.S. Highway 14 between Cody and Burgess Junction. At its west end in Cody, US 14 is concurrent with U.S. Highway 16 and U.S. Highway 20. West of Burgess Junction, US 14A passes through the Big Horn Mountains, reaching a maximum elevation of . This portion of the road is closed during the winter months. The total length of US 14A is approximately . Intermediate towns on the highway include Powell and Lovell. At Lovell, US 14A is concurrent with U.S. Highway 310 for approximately . In the initial 1925 plan, roughly the west half of present US 14 Alternate, from Cody to U.S. Highway 310 in Deaver, was assigned the number U.S. Highway 220.Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925 However, two spurs of US 20 were added in Pennsylvania, and so US 220 became U.S. Highway 420 in the final 1926 plan. Around 1933, U.S. Highway 116 was extended west from Sheridan to Deaver, then absorbing US 420 to end at Cody. Soon after, it became part of an extended US 14\\\\. US 14 was shifted south to its present alignment in 1940, and the old alignment became Wyoming 14 for a while, and was recommissioned as US 14 Alternate around 1965.

It enrolled secondary-school students from a number of countries in a programme aimed at fostering internationalist sentiments in its pupils. Its official name was the London College of the International Education Society, and it was also known as the Spring Grove School, from its location in the Spring Grove area of Isleworth, London. History The International Education Society was organized in 1863, primarily by Liberal politician and industrialist Richard Cobden, who hoped international education could help eliminate war and promote free trade (an idea that had been discussed by a number of like-minded individuals at the 1855 Paris Exposition). Cobden died before the school opened, but William Ellis provided funding to complete the school's construction. The College's buildings were completed in 1866, and it officially opened in 1867, with classicist Leonhard Schmitz as the first headmaster. It engaged in a number of other educational experiments besides the focus on internationalism: it eliminated corporal punishment, and instituted an unusually science-focused curriculum, developed with noted scientists Thomas Henry Huxley and John Tyndall on its board of directors. In addition, Latin and Greek instruction was delayed to a later age than was then common, and instead instruction in modern languages was emphasized. The college enrolled 10 day students and 58 boarders in its first year, rising to 100 students by the 1880s, many of whom came from other countries. Student Maurice Hewlett would become one of school's notable students as he went on to become a famous author and poet. The school operated until 1889, when it was closed for unclear reasons, and the premises sold to Borough Road College. The ornately decorated main building survives and is noted in architectural guides. It was made a Grade II listed building in 2000.

He is a professor for Materials Research Scientist and professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Early life He received his master degree in Physical Engineering from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MFTI) in 1960 on the subject of low temperature physics. He then pursued graduate studies in high energy physics at the Kapitza Institute in Moscow and at the Institute of Thermophysics in Novosibirsk Academgorodok. In 1963, he defended his PhD thesis on Quantum Field Theory at the Novosibirsk Scientific Center (scientific advisor Lev Landau). Career He was a scientist at the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, at the Institute of Thermal Physics (1960-1968) and the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (1968-1997). He was also employed as a professor of Physics and Mathematics at Novosibirsk State University (1974-1992). In 1992, he became a materials research scientist/professor at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. His work on nonequilibrium critical phenomena was supported by research grants from NASA and his studies of polymeric materials were supported by Dow Chemical Company. His areas of research are quantum mechanics, statistical physics, condensed matter theory, high energy physics, general relativity, turbulence theory, theory of liquids and glasses. He is best known for his pioneering and fundamental contributions to the modern theory of phase transitions in collaboration with Valery Pokrovsky, as well as the collective tube model in the theory of hadron-nuclei collisions at high energies, applications of the pattern recognition theory to local structure in liquids, and liquid-liquid phase transitions. Honours and awards Awards to Patashinski include the Order of Labor Glory (USSR, 1990), Scientific Achievement Diploma (USSR, 1986) and the Landau Prize of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1983. The announcement for the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to Kenneth G. Wilson, acknowledges Patashinski , Valery Pokrovsky, and Leo Kadanoff for important contributions to the theory of critical phenomena. He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2003. Work In 1962 and 1963, Patashinski, Valery Pokrovsky and Isaak Khalatnikov solved the problem of quasi-classical scattering in three dimensions . In 1963-1965, together with Valery Pokrovsky, Patashinski developed the fluctuating theory of phase transitions. This theory was then applied to a wide range of phase transition problems, including critical slowdown of chemical reactions, brownian motion, electric conductivity near the magnetic ordering point, nucleation in near-critical systems. Other contributions of Patashinski include the theory of gravitational collapse in non-spherically- symmetric systems, the collective tube model for hadron-nucleus collisions at high-energies, nonequilibrium critical phenomena. From 1970, Patashinski and his students B. Shumilo, A.

In 1938 he was seconded to go on a joint collecting trip of four months with Swedish botanist Adolf Hjalmar Frederick Hafstr√∂m between Cape Town and Victoria Falls.  Early life and education  He was born in Cape Town to John Martin Acocks and Sarah Phoebe Petty. Matriculated from the South African College Schools (SACS) and attended the University of Cape Town between 1929‚Äì35 obtaining a B.A. and M.Sc.. He studied under Robert Stephen Adamson (1885‚Äì1965) and Margaret Levyns (1890‚Äì1975).Aluka  Career  His first appointment was in January 1936 as pasture ecologist at the Pasture Research Section, part of the Division of Plant Industry. He set out to do botanical surveys of new pasture research stations. In 1945 he was transferred to Estcourt to the Botanical Survey Section of the Division of Botany and Plant Pathology which later became the Botanical Research Institute. From 1948 he was permanently posted at the Grootfontein College of Agriculture in Middelburg. Acocks contributed greatly to South African botany in three distinct areas. Firstly, his treatment of the vegetation regions (Veld Types) of South Africa, in which he classifies vegetation into 75 classes, continues to be a valuable reference work for researchers and is an outstanding achievement for a single individual. Secondly, his analysis of the impact of humans on vegetation has largely been revised by current research insights, specifically with regard to the effect of fire on grasslands, savannas and forests. There is, though, ample evidence showing considerable changes in Karoo fauna and flora over the last three centuries. Finally, his pioneering views on veld rehabilitation and management remain important guidelines for the farming communities of South Africa.South African Journal of Botany, Volume 69, Number 1, 1 March 2003 , pp. 1-6(6) He was President of Section C of the SA Assoc. for the Advancement of Science in 1963, and awarded the Senior Capt. Scott Medal by the SA Biol. Soc. in 1977. Acocks worked on a revised version of the Veld Types, which he completed shortly before his death, and which is lodged in the archives of the National Botanical Institute (NBG).

In the Netherlands he finished his studies, carried out various activities and was involved in various actions for foreigners' rights, including the so-called 182 Moroccans church after asylum-seekers were threatened to be expelled by the then State Secretary of Justice in the First Van Agt cabinet. In 1983 he was director of the Dutch Center Foreigners (NCB). At the 1994 Dutch general election, he became an MP for the political party GreenLeft. For the elections of that year he was one of the two top candidates, along with Ina Brouwer. During the campaign, in an interview with NRC Handelsblad, Rabbae expressed understanding for people who wanted the book The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie banned.

She is thought to have been descended from the Red Pyle color variation of the Old English Game breed. She was a pet of Keith and Donna Barton of Bessemer, Alabama, a suburb of Birmingham. Matilda's name was taken from \\"Waltzing Matilda\\", an old Australian folk song, and given to her as a result of her penchant for stepping side to side (as if she were waltzing) against the wire panels on the sides of her cage. Unlike most hens, Matilda never produced eggs. Her veterinarians believed Matilda's lack of egg production contributed significantly to her extraordinarily long lifespan of sixteen years. Another contributing factor to Matilda's longevity was her having lived the majority of her life indoors, inside a large wire cage, where she enjoyed a stable, protected environment year-round. Magic career On October 19, 1990, Keith and Donna went to the Alabama State Fairgrounds in Fairfield, Alabama, and paid $10 () to purchase Matilda from Steve Shaffield of Warrior, Alabama. Under the stage names of Mort The Mystifying and Donna, Keith and Donna were pursuing their goal of becoming professional magicians, and Matilda was part of their plan. On June 5, 1991, she made her debut performance in Keith's and Donna's magic show. To make Matilda magically appear, Keith would produce an egg from two cardboard tubes, which were shown empty and then nested one inside the other. After cracking the egg, dropping its contents into an empty pan, and adding a few drops of hot sauce, Keith would place the lid on the pan and immediately lift the lid to reveal Matilda in all her glory. Her magic career would span well over a decade. Celebrity status =World's Oldest Living Chicken= Guinness World Records (London, England) Considering that the average lifespan of a chicken is generally no more than seven to eight years, Keith and Donna contacted Guinness World Records on July 30, 2001, to make them aware that Matilda was eleven years old and still in excellent health. Guinness World Records responded that Matilda's age had to be substantiated. Keith and Donna began completing forms and gathering documentation, which were forwarded directly to Guinness World Records. On April 27, 2004, Guinness World Records proclaimed fourteen-year-old Matilda to be World's Oldest Living Chicken. Keith and Donna were presented with a congratulatory letter and official certificate from Guinness World Records. Matilda's title of World's Oldest Living Chicken is recorded in the data banks at Guinness World Records, but has not been included in their books or on their website. =The Tonight Show= Following their appearance on The Tonight Show; Keith, Donna, and Matilda pose with Jay Leno. (September 2004) NBC Universal Studios (Burbank, California) As a direct result of Matilda's receiving the title of World's Oldest Living Chicken; she, Keith, and Donna were guests of Jay Leno on The Tonight Show in an episode that taped and aired on September 9, 2004. Also appearing on the show were Terry Bradshaw, Jim Brown and Howie Long. Musical guests were Kirk Franklin and Yolanda Adams. A veteran of the stage, Matilda was perfectly at ease in front of the studio audience. Much to their delight, she strutted on top of Jay's desk, nibbled breadcrumbs, played with her favorite toy, and did a well-received impersonation of the NBC peacock. Ambassador of good will After returning home from The Tonight Show, Matilda began putting her celebrity status to use by becoming an ambassador of good will and appearing as an honored guest at numerous charitable events in Birmingham, Alabama, including: *Blessing of the Animals at St. Martin's in the Pines (October 3, 2004) (October 2, 2005) *Tails and Art Benefit for the Alabama Animal Foundation (October 17, 2004) *Wet Nose Ball for TEARS (The Emergency Animal Rescue Service) (May 14, 2005) * Picasso Pets for Hand-in-Paw (August 28, 2005) =Olivia Bearden Award= Greater Birmingham Humane Society (Birmingham, Alabama) On September 22, 2005, the Greater Birmingham Humane Society held their annual awards luncheon at The Club in Birmingham, Alabama.

Magically appearing to accept her award, Matilda perched proudly on top of the plaque as it was held by Keith. Declining health and demise Due to age-related health problems, Matilda retired from show business on October 17, 2005, and died, at the age of sixteen, on February 11, 2006. From the time she received the title of World's Oldest Living Chicken, Matilda lived one year, nine months, and fifteen days. =Final resting place= Locating a final resting place for Matilda has proven a challenge. Keith and Donna would prefer Matilda be interred in a place of honor in Alabama, but none has yet been located. Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York is being considered. Until a decision is reached, Matilda is being kept in frozen storage. Posthumous honors =Broken Perch Ceremony= Southeastern Association of Magicians Ring 35 of the International Brotherhood of Magicians (Birmingham, Alabama) To honor Matilda's contributions to the world of magic, a Broken Perch Ceremony was conducted on Saturday, August 5, 2006. The ceremony, which was held at the Hilton Birmingham Perimeter Park Hotel in Birmingham, Alabama, was hosted by the Southeastern Association of Magicians and Ring 35 of the International Brotherhood of Magicians. Ring 35 is also known as the Magic City Magic Club and Judge Arnold Drennen Ring. Based on the Broken Wand Ceremony, which was initially performed in 1926 at the funeral of Harry Houdini, the Broken Perch Ceremony for Matilda was a first in magic. Never before had a magician's animal been formally recognized and honored by the magic community. Bob Sanders, President of Ring 35, officiated at the ceremony; Jacque Meyer, Executive Director of the Greater Birmingham Humane Society, delivered the eulogy; and Bill Pitts, Past President of the International Brotherhood Of Magicians, conducted the Broken Perch ritual. In honor of Matilda's many accomplishments, Bob Sanders presented Keith and Donna with a Commendation, which had been drafted by Alabama Governor Bob Riley. =Alabama Animal Hall of Fame= Alabama Veterinary Medical Association (Montgomery, Alabama) The Alabama Veterinary Medical Association inducted Matilda into the Alabama Animal Hall of Fame on September 9, 2006, at a black tie dinner, which was held at Embassy Suites Montgomery Hotel in Montgomery, Alabama. The ceremony was exactly two years to the date on which Matilda had appeared on The Tonight Show. Two dogs, Gucci and Muffin, were also inducted.

History Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá had found no historical documents on Petar Mrkonjiƒá. Folklorist Stjepan Grƒçiƒá did not believe Petar Mrkonjiƒá was a historical figure. According to Anƒëelko Mijatoviƒá, it is generally believed that the epic personality of Petar Mrkonjiƒá is a historical figure, and that he was born in Imotski; he is possibly the same person as Petar Imoƒáanin (\\"Petar from Imotski\\"), who lived in the mid-17th century and is said to have greatly damaged properties of the Republic of Ragusa, after which the Ragusans urged the Venetians to stop him, as he was a Venetian subject. Legacy Mrkonjiƒá has become the subject of poems and Croatian patriotic songs. One of the earliest mentions of Mrkonjiƒá were written by the Venetian-Croatian friar and poet Andrija Kaƒçiƒá Mio≈°iƒá (1704-1760) in Vitezovi Imotske krajine., excerpt from In Serbian epic poetry, he has a hero status along with other hajduks such as Starac Vujadin, Pecija, Golub, Starina Novak, Bajo Pivljanin, and others. He is also the subject of a poem by Serbian linguist Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá (1787-1864) in Jaut-beg i Pero Mrkonjiƒá. During the Great Eastern Crisis, set off by a Serb uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1875 in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Herzegovina Uprising (1875‚Äì77)), Prince Peter adopted the nom de guerre of hajduk Petar Mrkonjiƒá of Ragusa, and joined the Bosnian Serb insurgents as a leader of a guerilla unit. In 1925 the \\"Organization of Serbian Chetniks - Petar Mrkonjiƒá\\" was founded, though it was banned by King Alexander I of Yugoslavia four years later when he instituted a dictatorship. In World War II, there was a Chetnik command named \\"Petar Mrkonjiƒá\\", with 700 fighters. Babiƒá formed the paramilitary Petar Mrkonjiƒá-brigade in April 1992. The \\"Medal of Petar Mrkonjiƒá\\" was also given by Republika Srpska.

Biography He was born in the village of Bri≈°nik near Tomislavgrad. Although his exact birth date is uncertain, Mijat is said to have lost his parents at a young age, and by 1640, was known to have had at least two brothers and two sisters. As a child, Mijat was reputed to have been physically strong, a characteristic that was later proven in future battles. One legend states that he won while competing in some games popular with the local Muslim population. The defeat did not sit well with the Muslims and they decided that he should be killed. Mijat then fled to the mountain Vran, marking the beginning of his life as a hajduk.Profile, zurnalizam.blogspot.ca; accessed 30 November 2015. Facts about the life of Mijat Tomiƒá were published in the 18th century book Cvit razgovora naroda i jezika iliriƒçkoga aliti rvackoga (1747) by Franciscan priest, Filip Grabovac. In reference to Tomiƒá, Grabovac claimed that, following his death, \\"never existed a real hajduk like him nor will there ever be one\\".Grabovac, Filip.

Many poems and legends are in the agreement that he was betrayed by his godfather, Ilija Bobovac.

B. Tylor in 1865 to refer to certain rituals in several cultures that fathers adopt during pregnancy. Couvade can be traced to Ancient Egypt as a \\"sacred birth custom, of when a child is born, the man experiences the ritual of \\"labor\\" in which he takes to his bed, and undergoes periods of fasting and purification, and the observance of certain taboos\\".Mami Wata: Africa's Ancient God/dess Unveiled Vol. I p. 71 The term \\"couvade\\" is borrowed from French (where it is derived from the verb couver \\"to brood, hatch\\"); the use in the modern sense derives from a misunderstanding of an earlier idiom faire la couvade, which meant \\"to sit doing nothing.\\"New Oxford American Dictionary (OUP, 2nd ed., 2005), p. 390. An example of couvade is that the Cantabri people had a custom in which the father, during or immediately after the birth of a child, took to bed, complained of having labour pains, and was accorded the treatment usually shown to women during pregnancy or after childbirth. Similarly, in Papua New Guinea, fathers built a hut outside the village and mimicked the pains of labour until the baby is born. Similar rituals occur in other cultural groups in Thailand, Russia, China, India and many indigenous groups in the Americas. In some cultures, \\"sympathetic pregnancy\\" is attributed to efforts to ward off demons or spirits from the mother or seek favour of supernatural beings for the child. Couvade has been reported by travelers throughout history, including the Greek geographer Strabo (3.4.17). According to Claude Levi- Strauss, the custom of couvade reinforces the institution of the family in some societies by \\"welding\\" together men and their wives and future children. Conflict, Order and Action (Chapter 33), Edward Ksenych & David Liu, 2001 Couvade has been interpreted by some as a manifestation of male womb envy, with the ritual serving as a psychological defense mechanism in which men appropriate or attempt to compensate for women's innate ability to produce offspring.

He was born in Dumfries, Scotland where his father was a merchant. When his father's business failed, Robert and his brothers, William and Thomas, travelled to Canada to work for their cousin Robert Hamilton. While Robert's brothers made careers for themselves in Newark and the Niagara peninsula, Robert found routine office work tedious, and was sent to Mackinac Island in 1786 to trade on his own. He spent many years trading among Indian tribes to the west. In 1797, he married Ista Towin or Totowin (Helen Elizabeth), the daughter of chief Wakinyanduta (Red Thunder) of the Cuthead band of the Yanktonai Dakota. During the years preceding the War of 1812, Dickson and other British and Canadian traders were angered by American encroachments into the area where they previously enjoyed a monopoly. As war appeared imminent, Dickson recruited over 100 warriors from the \\"Western Indians\\" (from the present-day states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois) and gathered them at the British military outpost at Fort St. Joseph. When news of the outbreak of war arrived, Dickson led a total of 400 Indians in an expedition led by Captain Charles Roberts, which captured Mackinac Island from its unwary American garrison. He subsequently led the Western Indians south to join the British army at Amherstburg, where they took part in the Siege of Detroit, which caused the surrender of an American army. In the autumn following these victories, Dickson travelled to Montreal, where he was appointed to the Indian Department as Agent and Superintendent for the Western Indian tribes. During 1813, he led contingents of Indians at the unsuccessful Siege of Fort Meigs and Battle of Fort Stephenson. In 1814, he recruited fresh contingents of the Western Indians and led them at the successful defence of Mackinac Island and the Engagement on Lake Huron. He ended the war at the captured post of Prairie du Chien, where he quarreled with Andrew Bulger, the post's commandant. After the war, he retired from the Indian Department although, while on a visit to Scotland in 1816, he applied unsuccessfully to be the Indian Department agent at Amherstburg. The war had ruined Dickson's fur trading business. He nevertheless resumed trading, but died unexpectedly at Drummond Island in 1823.

She was an abbess of the Convent for Noble Ladies in Innsbr√ºck from 1780 until 1806. Early life Maria Elisabeth in her childhood Maria Elisabeth was known in the family as \\"Liesl\\". She was given the customary education of the daughters of the empress, with a focus on accomplishments designed to make her an attractive consort of a royal court and with only shallow and the most basic instruction in academic subjects. As a person, she was described as somewhat unstable in her character and without any particular interests. She was considered to be the most beautiful of all the daughters of Maria Theresa, was regarded a beauty already by the age of twelve and was reportedly very well aware of this fact. Her mother the empress referred to her as childish and immature and called her eine Kokette der Sch√∂nheit (\\"a pretty coquette\\") and observed: \\"It mattered not if the look of admiration came from a prince or a Swiss Guard, Elisabeth was satisfied.\\" At the wedding of her brother Joseph in 1765, she played the part of Apollo in the operetta Il Parnasso Confuso by Gluck.Fraser, Antonia, Marie Antoinette: The Journey ORION, London 2002, Dynastic policy Her beauty was considered a valuable asset in the dynastic marriage politics of her mother and made her a subject of marriage speculations on the dynastic marriage market early on. However, her marriage was delayed because of the high expectations of the status of her future groom. When Charles III of Spain was widowed in 1761, there were negotiations between Spain and Austria about a marriage between Charles III and Maria Elisabeth, but these ultimately ended in a failure. A marriage with King Stanislaw of Poland was suggested after his succession to the throne in 1764, but nothing came of it after empress Catherine the Great had made her discontent over the proposal clear. A marriage to her cousin Prince Benedetto, Duke of Chablais was proposed, which Maria Elisabeth declared herself very willing to enter, but ultimately, her brother Joseph II did not find such a match to be of enough political advantage, as he considered her to be a great asset in dynastic policy and wished to secure a marriage with the highest possible status. When Maria Elisabeth turned 24 in 1767, this was considered late to be unmarried by the standards of an 18th-century princess. In 1768, simultaneously with the discussions of a marriage between her younger sister Maria Antonia (later Marie Antoinette) and the heir to the French throne, a suggestion was made to engage Maria Elisabeth to the widowed king Louis XV of France, which would have resulted in a double marriage alliance between France and Austria. A marriage contract was prepared and the negotiations were almost completed. Before the negotiations could be finalized, however, Maria Elisabeth fell ill with smallpox. Although she made a full recovery, it was reported that the illness had terribly scarred her face and destroyed her beauty, and thus all plans of a marriage were disrupted.Brigitte Hamann (Hrsg.): Die Habsburger: Ein biographisches Lexikon. Wien 1988, S. 320. Additionally, the Choiseul party at the French coyrt opposed a re-marriage of the king, and according to the reports of the Austrian ambassador Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau: \\"Persons in power, imagine that a queen, judicious and amiable, who would succeed in gaining the affection of her husband, might open his eyes to the irregularities and the enormous abuses which exist in all departments here, and cause much embarrassment to those who direct them. They are consequently of opinion that it behoves them to divert the mind of the King from ideas of marriage; and I have very strong proofs that Madame de Gramont, more interested than any one in the mamtenance of the present abuses, has succeeded in persuading M. de Choiseul to renounce his own predilections in this affair.\\"Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 Abbess Liesl (left) with her older sister, Marianne Maria Elisabeth was appointed canoness of the Convent for Noble Ladies in Innsbruck by her mother, but like her sister Maria Anna, who had a similar position, she did not in fact live in the convent but continued to share her time with the Imperial Court at Hofburg and Sch√∂nbrunn. After the death of her mother empress Maria Theresa in 1780, Maria Elisabeth and her sisters Maria Anna and Maria Christina were asked by their brother emperor Joseph II, to leave court, because he shunned the presence of women there and wanted to put an end to what he referred to as his sister's Weiberwirtschaft or Women's Republic. He confirmed his mother's appointment of Maria Christina and her husband as governors of the Austrian Netherlands, after which they left for Brussels, while Maria Elisabeth and her sister Maria Anna left to join their respective convents. Maria Elisabeth left for the Convent of Noble Ladies in Innsbruck, which had been established by her mother in 1765 to pray for the soul of her late spouse, the father of Maria Elisabeth. Maria Elisabeth resided in Innsbruck as abbess of the Convent of Noble Ladies for about fifteen years. Here - or rather in Innsbruck's Imperial Castle - Maria Elisabeth resided from May 1781 until January 1806. Her position did not, in fact, resemble monastic life much, as the terms of the convent gave its members high rank, a personal allowance, a suite suitable for a noblewoman and the freedom to participate in public life and high society. Maria Elisabeth did not live a secluded life but entertained much in her apartments, received guests and often arranged family receptions. During her years as abbess, she was described as greatly overweight, was referred to as \\"Kropferte Liesl\\" (\\"Kropf\\" = struma) because of her pock marks, and became known and feared for her sharp wit. Her friends described her as a popular society person with a fiery personality. Sir John Swinburne described her sharp wit and humorous self irony upon his visit. When her younger brother Leopold succeeded as emperor in 1790, he involved her more in state affairs. He gave her representational tasks, and in 1790, she ceremoniously opened the Provincial Assembly (Landtag) at Innsbruck in his place, and she often acted as his representative in ceremonial occasions at Innsbruck. She often received important guests such as princes, but also entertained artists such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. She was allowed to travel again and visited the Puster Valley on several occasions with her chamberlain Count Spaur, and spent the winter of 1800-1801 in Brunico. Death In January 1806, Maria Elisabeth fled from Innsbruck to Vienna and then to Linz, when the province of Tyrol was taken over by Napoleon Bonaparte's ally, the Kingdom of Bavaria. She spent her last years in Linz, where she died on 22 September 1808. She was buried in the Jesuit Church of Linz.

It is a volume in the series of fictional works about the Land of Oz, by L.

Frank Baum, Lawrence, KS, University Press of Kansas, 1997. The Rundelstone of Oz was originally the opening section of McGraw's The Forbidden Fountain of Oz. Extracted from that book, the Rundelstone story remained unpublished until it was included in the sixth and final issue of Oz-story Magazine, the annual periodical issued by David Maxine and Eric Shanower from 1995 to 2000. The novel was then published in a hardback edition the next year.Eloise Jarvis McGraw,The Rundelstone of Oz, San Diego, Hungry Tiger Press, 2001. The Forbidden Fountain of Oz was originally intended to be illustrated by Lauren Lynn McGraw, the author's daughter and credited co-author. In Oz-story, The Rundelstone of Oz was published with Shanower's illustrations, along with Lauren McGraw's design sketches for the characters from the earlier form of the story. (Since McGraw died in 2000, the 2001 edition was published posthumously; it featured an Introduction by Lauren Lynn.) Synopsis The Troopadours are travelling entertainers -- not human ones, but living marionettes. When they reach the village of Whitherwood in the Gillikin Country, they are enchanted by a malicious magician called Slyddwyn. Most are transformed into inanimate objects -- though Slyddwyn leaves the humblest member of the troupe, Pocotristi Sostenuto, free to serve as a menial servant in his castle. (This plot device, of magically turning \\"people\\" into inanimate ornaments, reaches back to Baum's third Oz book, Ozma of Oz.) To work his transformations, Slyddwyn uses the Rundelstone, a fist-sized rock with a \\"rundel\\" (a rhyming riddle, in this case also an enchantment) carved on it in \\"flarns\\" (runes). Puppet protagonist Poco must figure out what has happened to his companions, then obtain the Rundelstone and learn to work its magic. With the help of a young boy named Rolly, and eventually with the aid of Dorothy Gale, Princess Ozma and other familiar denizens of Oz, Poco succeeds in restoring his friends, defeating the villain, and ensuring that Good triumphs.

Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds is a 1972 studio album by Randy California. Background This album was recorded and released following Randy California's departure from Spirit. Spirit's fourth LP, Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus, reached the charts but took an inordinate amount of time to receive attention (the album would eventually be certified gold by the RIAA in 1976). As a result, Jay Ferguson and Mark Andes departed Spirit to form Jo Jo Gunne with Andes' brother Matt (whose slide guitar work had previously appeared in \\"Prelude: Nothin' to Hide\\" on the Sardonicus album) and drummer Curly Smith. Following the departure of Jay Ferguson and Mark Andes in early 1971, Spirit recruited John Arliss (and later John Fine) on bass and resumed playing live shows in March 1971\\". Randy California, however, was also growing disenchanted in Spirit and left the band in July 1971, along with bassist John Fine. They were replaced by brothers Al and John Staehely (on bass and guitar, respectively), and Spirit went on to record Feedback without Randy.Skidmore, Mick: Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds 2008 reissue liner notes. Randy spent much of his time afterwards in jam sessions with various musicians in Topanga Canyon clubs, particularly a club known as The Corral. Some of the musicians who appeared in these jam sessions, along with Noel Redding (under the pseudonym 'Clit McTorius'), Leslie Sampson (the drummer from Noel's band Road, under the pseudonym 'Henry Manchovitz') and Ed Cassidy (as 'Cass Strange'), would end up working with Randy when he started recording solo material in 1972. The resulting album featured numerous covers of the works of contemporary acts such as the Beatles and James Brown, with less emphasis upon original material by Randy. The album was also heavily influenced by the death of Jimi Hendrix in 1970, who had been friends with Randy since they played together in Jimmy James and the Blue Flames. Promotion and reception On November 7th, 1972, shortly after the album's release, Epic released a promotional-only single to radio stations. Reflecting the album's division between covers and original material, the single featured a cover of Rufus Thomas' \\"Walkin' the Dog\\" on one side and an original by Randy entitled \\"Live for the Day\\" on the opposite side (neither song was released on the original album). Neither the album or the single were commercially successful. Randy convened a touring band during the same period under the Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds moniker. The group, which featured Ed Cassidy on drums and Larry \\"Fuzzy\\" Knight on bass, supported the album by playing shows around the Los Angeles area, including a few performances for the radio station KPFK. Several months after the album's release, this group would tour Europe as Spirit under pressure from booking agents who wanted to capitalize on Spirit's name and were not interested in Randy's solo work.Ruhlmann, William: Liner notes to the compilation Time Circle: 1968-1972 by Spirit. Critical opinions of the album are mixed. William Ruhlmann, reviewing the album for AllMusic, wrote that the cover songs \\"became almost unrecognizable frames for California's improvisations. At least the covers were actual songs, which was more than you could say for the originals\\", before concluding that \\"Kapt. Kopter ended up proving that California was not ready to be promoted from a group guitarist who sang and wrote occasionally.\\" However, Robert Christgau stated that, while he did not have a passion for \\"sheer dense weirdness\\", the album's \\"tunefully distorted guitar (and vocal) showcase will grow on you if you give it half a chance\\". Gavin Martin of Classic Rock in his positive review remarks how the album reflects the strong spiritual and musical connection with Jimi Hendrix, although California shows here an \\"individual, densely layered\\" sensibility which puts him \\"several light years ahead of the pack.\\" Despite the album's critical reception, there has been enough continuing interest in the album to warrant numerous LP and CD reissues. The initial CD release of this album by Edsel Records contained both tracks from the promotional single that Epic released in 1972. The later CD reissues by Sony Music and Acadia also feature these tracks along with an additional instrumental track entitled \\"Rebel\\".

Life Jessop was the son of John Jessop, a minister at Pembroke, Pembrokeshire in Wales. He studied initially at Jesus College, Oxford, commencing in 1624 aged 22, before moving to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated with a BA from Dublin before returning to Oxford to obtain his MA in 1632. His movements thereafter are uncertain for a few years, although his son Constantine was born in 1639 or 1640. In 1643, he was appointed to the parish of Fyfield, Essex. In 1644, he argued for the biblical validity of presbyterian church government, with his views being published as The angel of the Church of Ephesus no bishop of Ephesus, distinguished in order from, and superior in power to a presbyter, dedicated to William Twisse. In August 1647, he moved from Fyfield to Bristol to take up a position as vicar of St Nicholas. In 1650, he was alleged to have preached against the council of state and, whilst protesting, did not deny all the charges. He was allowed to remain a minister on condition that he did not return to Bristol, although temporary permission was given on two occasions in 1652 and the prohibition was removed in April 1654, after Jessop had become rector of Wimborne Minster in Dorset. Also in 1654, Jessop wrote a preface to John Grayle's A Modest Vindication, entitled The nature of the covenant of grace, wherein is a discovery of the judgment of Dr. Twisse in the point of justification, clearing him from antinomianism therein. On 16 April 1658, Jessop died at Wimborne; he was buried there. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and his son, Constantine, who became rector of Brington, Northamptonshire and a prebendary of Durham Cathedral.

He is the brother of Derek Ho, another champion surfer. Michael is also the father of Women's World Tour surfer Coco Ho and son Mason Ho - \\"The World‚Äôs Most Entertaining Surfer\\". The Ho brothers have Chinese, native Hawaiian, and American European roots. Their father Edmund \\"Chico\\" Ho is half Chinese and half Native Hawaiian while their mother Joeine Ho is of American European descent. Their paternal grandfather moved to Hawaii in 1892 from China. Ho was born in San Mateo, California. He became one of Hawaii's first full-time professional surfers, and in 1975 finished runner-up in the Duke Kahanamoku Classic and the Pro Class Trials. Ho was already being called the world's finest \\"position\\" surfer, meaning he invariably placed himself in the most critical section of the wave using the simplest and cleanest line. He often rode with a ramrod straight back, knees apart, his right arm distinctively held out from his body, hand dangling at the wrist. (Younger brother Derek Ho, the 1993 world champion, surfed in much the same way.) At 5'5\\", 135 pounds, Ho was never able to explode through a turn the way his heavier peers could, but nobody was quicker on their feet, and few were as innately stylish. He was one of the world's best tuberiders in the mid- and late '70s (he helped invent the \\"pigdog\\" tuberiding technique), and his skills only improved throughout the '80s. Gregarious around friends and family, the mustachioed Ho kept a wary distance from the rest of the surf world, and was a somewhat shadowy figure during his 13 years (1976‚Äì88) on the pro tour. Ho performed well at world tour venues around the world, but never won a pro circuit event outside of Hawaii. On the North Shore, however, he was a competitive force for more than 25 years: a five-time Pipeline Masters finalist (winning in 1982, even though hobbled by a cast on his right wrist); an eight-time Duke finalist (winning in 1978 and 1981); a four-time winner of the Xcel Pro (1988, 1990, 1991, and 1996); a two-time Triple Crown winner (1983 and 1985); and a four-time competitor in the Quiksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau big-wave event at Waimea (finishing fourth in 1990). In one of pro surfing's most remarkable competitive achievements, the 40-year-old Ho finished runner-up in the 1997 Pipeline Masters. A mainstay in the World Masters Championships, an annual event for ex-pros over the age of 36, Ho won the event in 2000, and made the quarterfinals of the 2011 event in Brazil. In 2012, Ho was inducted to the Surfing Walk of Fame at Huntington Beach.

The New Zealand zone has a rich and unusually complex underwater topography. Over 15,000 marine species are known to live there, about ten percent of the world's diversity. Many of these are migratory species, but New Zealand's isolation means also that many of the marine species are unique to New Zealand.Fisheries and their ecosystems. NZ Ministry of Fisheries. Retrieved 13 June 2008. Statistics New Zealand's wild fisheries captured 441,000 tonnes and earned over NZ$1 billion in exports in the fishing year 2006/07. The aquaculture of mussels, salmon and oysters earned another $226 million. This made seafood the country‚Äôs fifth largest export earner.New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries: NZ Fisheries at a Glance Retrieved 11 June 2008 There are about two tonnes of fish in the New Zealand fisheries for every New Zealander. Just under ten percent of this stock is harvested each year.Seafriends: Why is New Zealand so special? In the fishing year 2006/07, there were 1,316 commercial fishing vessels and 229 processors and licensed fish receivers, employing 7,155 people. About 1.2 million or 31 percent of New Zealanders engage, at least occasionally, in recreational fishing with an annual recreational take of about 25,000 tonnes. Historical development Traditionally New Zealand's fishing industry was an inshore one largely confined to the domestic market. From 1938 to 1963, there was a licensing system operating, involving gear and area controls.Guerin, K. (2003). Property Rights and Environmental Policy: A New Zealand Perspective. Wellington, New Zealand: NZ Treasury Starting in the 1960s, the offshore waters, outside the then 12 nautical mile territorial sea, were exploited by Japanese, Taiwanese, South Korean, and Soviet trawlers.The New Zealand fishing industry In 1977 the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone was established. These zones were established because countries wanted protection from foreign fishing vessels. Because New Zealand‚Äôs territory includes the Chatham Islands and other outer islands, its EEZ is 4.1 million square kilometres, the sixth largest fishing zone in the world. This was a huge resource, and expectations were high. The inshore fisheries had become over exploited, and the search was on for new offshore fisheries. New Zealand companies embarked on joint ventures with foreign companies. Trawling crews from other nations taught New Zealanders how to fish deep waters and in return got a share of the catch.Carl Walrond. Fishing industry. Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 21-Sep-2007 Squid jigger in Cook Strait By 1980 the consequences of the \\"Think Big\\" policy for the fishing industry were becoming very apparent. Mel Courtney, MP for Nelson and convenor of the Opposition fisheries' sub-committee on production and marketing, in asserting \\"the policy is falling apart\\", expressed the view of many. \\"The industry expanded so rapidly it was overcapitalized with too many boats...the inshore fleet expanded and joint venture and duty-free boats exerted further pressure\\" (Commercial Fishing June 1980 5). Deep-water trawling is highly mechanised and massive capital investment is normally required to operate modern factory trawlers. These ships process everything caught on board. Even the guts and heads are processed into fishmeal, which is so valuable it is known as \\"brown gold\\". Elsewhere, major fisheries, such the northern hemisphere cod fisheries, were collapsing. Fishing companies in New Zealand were able to buy or lease the redundant trawlers cheaply. At the same time, the collapse of northern fisheries resulted in an unmet need in the world market for quality whitefish. Hoki and orange roughy from New Zealand were in demand. In 1986 New Zealand became the first country to introduce a property-rights based Quota Management System (QMS) system.KELLY Lock, Kelly and Leslie, Stefan (2007) New Zealand's Quota Management System: A History of the First 20 Years. Motu Working Paper No 07-02.Quota Management. There are currently (2008) 129 species which are targeted commercially. There are about 60 species groups with a QMS allowance for customary MƒÅori fishers, with a similar number for recreational fishers. The fisheries are managed through the Fisheries Act 1996, which sets out the rules and regulations and the QMS was administered by the Ministry of Fisheries until April 2012 when it was amalgamated into the Ministry for Primary Industries. The fishery in the 2000s By 2000, the industry had developed from being a domestic supplier to exporting over 90 percent of the fish harvest. Fishing grounds New Zealand is surrounded by an unusually complex underwater typography Coastal estuaries dot New Zealand's 15,000 km coastline. Coastal fisheries have access to a large continental shelf, and further afield are large continental rises. Together these relatively shallow fishing grounds occupy about thirty percent of the area of the EEZ. Yet further out in the deep ocean lie undersea mountain ranges and volcanoes, and deep oceanic trenches. The 10,000 metre deep Kermadec Trench is the second deepest trench on Earth. =High seas fishing= The high seas are those areas of ocean that not covered by any country‚Äôs Exclusive Economic Zone. New Zealand has international obligations to ensure New Zealand flagged vessels are aligned with proper conservation and management of the high seas fisheries. These are met in Part 6A of the Fisheries Act 1996. These obligations come from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1995 Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement.NZ Ministry of Fisheries: High seas fishing MƒÅori role The Treaty of Waitangi guaranteed the MƒÅori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, ‚Äúundisturbed possession‚Äù of the fisheries until they chose to dispose of them to the Crown. They have been provided with a substantial stake in commercial fishing as part of the Treaty Settlement. After the quota management system was established, the government purchased back ten percent of the quota share and gave it to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission for the benefit of MƒÅori. In 1992, the government allocated a cash settlement to MƒÅori which they used to buy a half share of Sealord, the countries largest fishing company. In addition, the government has given MƒÅori twenty percent of the commercial quota share of new species introduces to the quota management system, and the equivalent of twenty percent of all marine farming space created around New Zealand coasts and harbours. In 2004, Parliament approved the allocation of additional significant fisheries assets to iwi. Te Ohu Kai Moana is implementing this allocation. MƒÅori have now built their commercial stake to the point where they control or influence more than thirty percent of the commercial fisheries.MƒÅori FisheriesThe New Zealand Fishing Industry Providing Settlement Assets Maori Commercial Aquaculture Claims SettlementMƒÅori Development in Aquaculture Timeline * 1790s: Sealers and whalers arrive. * 1875: Seal hunting restricted to a short annual season. * 1894: Protection of fur seal population due to declining numbers. * 1908: the Fisheries Act 1908 is passed * 1977: The Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic Zone Act is passed. * 1979: Marine Mammals Protection Act came into force. * 1983: Fisheries Act 1983 comes into force (establishes a fishing quota system). * 1986: Quota Management System (QMS) introduced to conserve fish stocks within the Exclusive Economic Zone. * 1989: M√§ori Fisheries Act is passed. * 1996: Fisheries Act 1996 is passed (though parts of it come into force only spasmodically over the next few years). * 2000: Moratorium on new marine farming applications, initially for two years. * 2003: Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry for the Environment, and Fonterra sign the Dairying and Clean Streams Accord. * 2004: Moratorium on marine farms lifted after the passage of the Aquaculture Reform (Repeals and Transitional Provisions) Act 2004. * 2005: First criminal conviction for killing a fur seal is handed down. * 2005: Thirty five squid boats ordered to return to port from their sub- Antarctic fishing grounds for breaking a voluntary code of practice designed to protect seabirds.(Wikinews) * 2006: The New Zealand fishing industry proposes limits on bottom trawling. * 2006: New Zealand Fisheries officers' request to be allowed to carry batons and pepper spray is denied. * 2007: Great white sharks given protection within New Zealand's EEZ * 2007: Bottom trawling prohibited in selected areas. * 2007: The orange roughy fishery is closed to allow stocks of the fish to recover.Beehive - NZ and Australia close orange roughy fishery See also * Aquaculture in New Zealand * Agriculture in New Zealand * Exclusive economic zone of New Zealand References Further reading * de Alessi M (2012) \\"The Political Economy of Fishing Rights and Claims: The Maori Experience in New Zealand\\" Journal of Agrarian Change, 12 (2-3): 390‚Äì412. * Gibbs N and Stokes K (2006) Implications of Reallocation: Case Examples From New Zealand Sharing the Fish Conference 06. * Offshore Options: Managing Environmental Effects in New Zealand‚Äôs Exclusive Economic Zone June 2005, Ref.

It is in the commune of Machal√≠ in Cachapoal Province, Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region, near the company town of Sewell. This was established for the workers and their families. Mining at El Teniente is reported to have started as early as 1819. In the early 20th century, two men from New York, United States set up a mining operation there, starting operations in 1906. Kennecott Copper Corporation, based in Utah, United States, later operated the mine through their subsidiary company. The Chilean government bought a 51% interest in the mine in 1967. Some 15,000 people lived in Sewell at its height as a company town. In 1971 Chile nationalized copper production under President Salvador Allende and formed the state-owned copper mining company Codelco. This company still operates the mine. Workers began to live in other areas. With over of underground drifts, El Teniente is reportedly \\"the world's biggest underground copper mine\\", and is the largest of Codelco's operations. Typically more than 5,000 workers were involved in production.Emol, June 20, 2005, \\"La Tragedia del Humo\\": A 60 a√±os del peor accidente minero en Chile (in Spanish) Since 2011, a structural project called New Mine Level (NML) has been underway at El Teniente. It consists of expanding the mine deeper into the hill at 1,880 meters above sea level. The project is being carried out without interrupting the operation of El Teniente Division. History According to legend, the El Teniente mine was discovered in the 1800s by a fugitive Spanish official. Exploitation of the resource began in 1819. The best ore was mined manually in what would be called the Fortuna sector, and transported out of the mine by animal, such as ponies and mules. It was worked until 1897, when the high- grade ore was exhausted. In 1904 William Braden (an engineer from New York City, United States) and E.W. Nash formed the Braden Copper Company. They built a road for carts and a concentrating plant, which was in operation by 1906. In June 1910, Guggenheim Exploration took control of the mine and provided financing. In 1916 Braden became a subsidiary company of Kennecott Copper Corporation, which was based in Utah. Chileans have referred to such large-scale copper mining operations as La Gran Miner√≠a del Cobre (a major copper mine). Before nationalization, these operations generated a large proportion of the foreign currency which the country received. In 1945 there was a disaster at El Teniente mine, resulting in the deaths of 355 men and injury to 747 more. It was the largest mining accident in Chilean and has the highest death toll in world history associated with metal extraction. Some 1,000 miners were down in the pits when the fire started in a nearby warehouse. Dense smoke spread in the underground tunnels. Most of the dead and injured suffered carbon monoxide poisoning. Emergency exits were not well marked. In Chile, this incident is known locally as the Smoke Tragedy ().Emol, June 20, 2005, \\"La Tragedia del Humo\\": A 60 a√±os del peor accidente minero en Chile (in Spanish) In 1967 the Chilean government bought a 51% stake in the mine and founded Sociedad Miner√≠a El Teniente. Under this agreement Kennecott built a new concentrator, and the mine expanded production to per day. On July 11, 1971, President Salvador Allende ordered the Chilean nationalization of copper, in an effort for the country to gain more benefit from the mines. Corporaci√≥n Nacional del Cobre de Chile (known as Codelco) was formed, and El Teniente became a state-owned operation. The Chilean government paid Kennecott $92.9-million for the property. The mine increased production to of ore per day, and in 2006 the mine produced over of copper. The Vancouver, British Columbia-based, Canadian company Amerigo produces both a copper and molybdenum concentrate from El Teniente's tailings. It has been granted the right also to treat higher grade tailings from a large, abandoned tailings impoundment near the El Teniente property. Geology The copper ore deposits are those of a typical copper porphyry and associated alteration-mineralization. These altered zones include chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite and molybdenite as hypogene minerals and chalcocite as a supergene mineral. The ore body surrounds the Braden Pipe in a continuous ring with a width of 2000 feet. The pipe is a geologic structure in the shape of an inverted cone, having a surface diameter of 4000 feet, and consisting of post-pipe breccia called the Braden Formation. The boundary of the pipe is marked by this post-pipe breccia and a pre-pipe breccia forming a belt up to 200 feet wide. \\"The Braden Pipe was a center of strong mineralization and structural weakness before the pipe was formed.\\" Copper mineralization and pipe formation occurred in the Pliocene. Ore was originally mined from the Fortuna orebody at the southwest quadrant starting in 1906. Since 1922, the larger Teniente orebody has also been mined on the east side. \\"The best grade of ore is found in altered andesite or in andesitic flow breccia adjacent to the pre-pipe breccia.\\" Mineralization at El Teniente is thought to be indebted to its position at the intersection of two large fault systems. This favoured the rise of magma and the subsequent circulation of mineral-rich fluids. Labour disruptions As of 2007 Codelco employed 17,000 direct-hire company employees and 28,000 contract employees across all their operations. There have been multiple labour disruptions at the El Teniente mine, where about 5,000 workers produce the ore. =1983= In 1983 El Teniente and two other Codelco mines closed when approximately 13,000 workers voted to strike \\"indefinitely\\" in protest of a union leader's arrest for calling for an end to military rule in Chile. In total among the three mines, at least 3,300 workers and 37 labour leaders were fired for participating in the strike. =2008= Contract workers went on strike at Codelco mines in 2008. El Teniente and two other Codelco mines were closed, El Teniente for the shortest length. Company employees continued to work; however, striking workers closed access to the mines and threw stones at buses transporting employees from the mine to the town of Rancagua. At least one employee was injured; he was hit by a metal object thrown by a protester on the highway leading to the mine.

The neighborhood is home to many historic properties, and was first settled by natives of France at the end of the eighteenth century. Guyandotte was already a thriving town when the state of West Virginia was formed from part of Virginia. Located at the confluence of the Guyandotte River and the Ohio River, it was already a regional trade center with several industries of its own when the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) reached its western terminus nearby there just across the Guyandotte River in 1873. This event was soon followed by the formation and quick development of the present city of Huntington which was named in honor of the C&O; Railway's founder and then principal owner Collis P. Huntington. History First settled in 1799, Guyandotte was established on a tract of land belonging to the Savage Grant, a parcel of land in western Virginia granted to veterans of the French and Indian War, who had served under Captain John Savage. The original grant extended from the present site of Milton, West Virginia in the east, to the Kentucky side of the Big Sandy River, then part of Virginia, in the west. Nearly all of present-day Huntington is situated on land that was part of the Savage Grant. Before it was annexed by Huntington, it was an old Federal Era town and has homes dating back to 1820. Also, a graveyard containing 18th-century French and Colonial-era settlers with surnames such as LeTulle, Holderby, and Buffington, exists in the neighborhood. Huntington was known as Holderby's Landing prior to 1871, and members of the Buffington family held tracts of land that later became the Huntington Land Company. The Buffingtons were the only revolutionary-era Savage Grant claimants to continuously reside within the area, and later generations of Buffingtons were associated with Marshall College (now a university) and were business partners of Collis P. Huntington. Albert Gallatin Jenkins, a Confederate Army general, had his plantation home, Green Bottom in nearby Lesage, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. At the time of Huntington's founding, Holderby's Landing was already the home of Marshall College, a normal school that had been founded in 1837 as Marshall Academy. Originally, Marshall Academy was essentially a boarding school, under control by the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church, and intended to serve high school students from wealthy families. In 1857, the school became Marshall College, which in turn became a public institution in 1867. The college later became Marshall University in 1961 and now occupies a large portion of the city to the immediate east of the downtown CBD. Historic buildings at Guyandotte include the Madie Carroll House and the Zachary Taylor Wellington House, both listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

She performed her debut hit \\"Und dabei liebe ich euch beide\\" (And Yet I Love You Both) in her very first television appearance which took place in the ARD-Silvestergala on New Year's Eve of 1977/1978. The song was written by Jack White and Jon Athan. Its lyrics address the post-divorce situation from a child's perspective. Further appearances on various television and radio shows followed. In the March 1978 Andrea J√ºrgens was the viewers'-choice winner on ZDF-Hitparade, a television show conducted by Dieter Thomas Heck. In the fall of 1978 the follow-ups to the debut hit were released. \\"Ich zeige Dir mein Paradies\\" (I'll Show You My Paradise) and \\"Tina ist weg\\" (Tina's missing), together with her success in the so-called hit parades concluded Andrea J√ºrgens' position as the first big child star in Germany since Heintje. In 1979 she gained further success with \\"Ein Herz f√ºr Kinder\\" (A Heart For Children) and \\"Eine Rose f√ºr dich\\" (A Rose For You). In October 1979 the Christmas album Weihnachten mit Andrea J√ºrgens was published. Its sales exceeded 1,5 million copies in just three months. Consequently, the album achieved multiple gold records and double platinum. The album included the single \\"Aba Heidschi Bumbeidschi\\", a traditional lullaby. =1980s= J√ºrgens' commercial success continued in a smaller scale in the early 1980s. The folk music album Andrea J√ºrgens singt die sch√∂nsten deutschen Volkslieder was released in 1981. Her next single hits were \\"Mama Lorraine\\" (1981), \\"Japanese Boy\\" (1981), and \\"Playa Blanca\\" (1984). Like \\"Manuel Goodbye\\" (1983), \\"Playa Blanca\\" was originally sung in English by Audrey Landers. Jack White produced the German versions for Andrea J√ºrgens. The albums Solang‚Äô ein M√§dchen tr√§umen kann (As Long as a Girl Can Dream) (1982) and Weil wir uns lieben (Because We Love Each Other) (1984) were not chart busters like their predecessors. In the latter half of the decade, no new studio albums were released. However, she released some singles (e.g. \\"Ciao ciao amore\\") and a \\"Best Of\\" compilation which was published in 1987. =1990s and afterwards= J√ºrgens' next studio albums, K√ºsse der Nacht (Kisses of the Night) and Liebe (Love), were released in the early 1990s. The album Ich krieg' nie genug von dir (I Never Get Enough of You) was released in 1993. Once again, it included a song originally interpreted by Audrey Landers, namely \\"Guten Morgen Sonnenschein\\" (Good Morning Sunshine). In 1996 J√ºrgens recorded the single \\"Wir greifen nach den Sternen\\" (We Reach For the Stars) together with the Nockalm Quintett. The song was included in the album Wenn ich gl√ºcklich bin (1996), the opening track of which is the German cover version of Madonna's hit \\"You'll See\\", \\"Du wirst sehen\\". In 2002, J√ºrgens celebrated her 25-year singing career. The anniversary was celebrated by publishing the jubilee album Dankesch√∂n zum 25j√§hrigen B√ºhnenjubil√§um. In the new century she changed her record company from BMG to KOCH. Lust aufs Leben (Love of Life) (2005) was her first studio album under the new label. Jack White and Peter Wagner had been the producers of J√ºrgens' albums during her BMG-years, Mr White often mentioned as the executive producer on the album cover. In KOCH her producer has been Alfons Weindorf. Her early albums were published in a non-plastic CD-box in 2006 by White Records. The albums are: Ich zeige dir mein Paradies (I'll Show You My Paradise), Eine Rose schenk ich dir...und dieses Lied (I Give You a Rose ... and This Song), Irgendwann wird jedes M√§dchen mal 17 (Every Girl Turns 17 Sometime), Mama Lorraine and Solang‚Äô ein M√§dchen tr√§umen kann (As Long as a Girl Can Dream), each with original cover artwork. Her new album Millionen von Sternen was released in March 2016, including the singles Millionen von Sternen, Das reicht f√ºr mehr als eine Nacht and D√©j√† vu. She fell in a coma as a result of a double kidney-failure and died on 20 July 2017. Lyrics The lyrics of J√ºrgens' songs are mainly about typical schlager themes, like friendship and love. The divorce theme in her very first hit \\"Und dabei liebe ich euch beide\\" (1977) was a major exception. In the German schlager scene divorce was a taboo subject until the 1970s; lyrics were mainly about harmonious relationships. During the decade, divorce reforms and public discussion of the reasons and consequences of divorce changed all this. Awards J√ºrgens was awarded various national music prizes. She achieved many silver, gold and platinum records for her singles and albums. The album Weihnachten mit Andrea J√ºrgens (Christmas with Andrea J√ºrgens) has achieved multiple gold and platinum. It has been commercially available throughout the year since its first publication. In 1982 and 1983, J√ºrgens was granted the Goldene Stimmgabel (Golden Tuning Fork).

Plot  The plot takes place in 1925. One of Chicago mobsters Mik Nich (born as Mikita Nichiporuk) flees to Soviet Odessa to escape the revenge of other mobsters. Mob leaders send the best hit-man Johnny Polak to Odessa. The killer disguises himself as an American entomology professor who wants to visit the grave of his father in Odessa. In search of his victim, Polak gets into the most unbelievable situations arising from the peculiarities of the city of Odessa, as well as from mad historical era. Being the first passenger of the ship voyage New York City-Odessa, he is assigned to be accompanied by the Komsomol guide Glushko and is besieged by pioneers and journalists. Jumping from the train and hitting his head, Polak forgets what he is actually doing there (retrograde amnesia), and tries to live up to his cover as an honest professor. Nichiporuk, in turn, learns about the arrival of the killer and is trying to kill him. Polak experiences several periods of regain and loss of memory (a periodical D√©j√† vu) while trying to track down Nichiporuk. Finally, Nichiporuk is arrested by Soviet authorities on an unrelated charge and sent to jail. Polak, having lost the rest of his sanity, ends up in a mental hospital.

Guan ju (: \\"Guan guan cry the ospreys\\", often mistakenly written with the unrelated but similar- looking character Áù¢, suƒ´) is the first poem from the ancient anthology Shi Jing (Classic of Poetry), and is one of the best known poems in Chinese literature. It has been dated to the seventh century BC,W. A. C. H. Dobson, The Language of the Book of Songs (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1968) p. 21. making it also one of China's oldest poems, though not the oldest in the Shi Jing. The title of the poem comes from its first line (Guan guan ju jiu), which evokes a scene of ospreys calling on a river islet. Fundamentally the poem is about finding a good and fair maiden as a match for a young noble. Guan ju boasts a long tradition of commentaries. Traditional Chinese commentators, represented by the \\"Three Schools\\" and the Mao School, hold that the poem contains a moral pertinent to the relationship between genders. However, modern commentators, and some Western sinologists, offer different interpretations. The poem has been culturally important since antiquity. According to the Analects, Confucius remarked that it displayed both joy and sorrow but neither to an excessive degree. The poem has subsequently been alluded to repeatedly in Chinese literature and continues to be quoted on occasion in the modern written language and in speech. In particular, the lines Á™àÁ™ïÊ∑ëÂ•≥ \\"fair and good lady\\", Ê±Ç‰πã‰∏çÂæó \\"seeking and not getting\\", and ÂØ§ÂØêÊ±Ç‰πã \\"seeking day and night\\" have become well-known four-character classical idioms or set phrases (chengyu). Calligraphy and watercolor illustration of the Guan ju by the Qianlong Emperor.  Synopsis and structure  \\"Guan ju\\" is part of the first section of the Shi Jing entitled \\"Zhou nan\\" (Âë®Âçó), itself a part of \\"Airs of the States\\" (ÂúãÈ¢®), which make up 160 out of the 305 poems of the anthology. It is fairly typical of the other poems of the Airs of the States, being made up of three tetrasyllabic stanzas of four to eight lines each. Each stanza begins with a natural image, which is juxtaposed without comment to the human situation around which the poem centres. The first stanza begins with the onomatopoeic cry of ospreys: \\"Guan guan\\" cry the ospreys On the islet in the river. The stanza then rehearses formulaic lines, drawn from the human context: The beautiful and good young lady Is a fine mate for the lord. The entire poem consists of a series of isolated episodes which can be linked into a continuous narrative. It alternates between natural images and human situations, two literally unrelated frames of reference. One set of formulaic lines refers to a male-female relationship: The beautiful and good young lady Is a fine mate for the lord. (3-4) ... The beautiful and good young lady Waking and sleeping he wished for her. (7-8) ... The beautiful and good young lady Zithers and lutes greet her as friend. (15-16) ... The beautiful and good young lady Bells and drums delight her. (19-20) Lines 9-12 intrude upon the formulaic scheme, making the poem asymmetrical: He wished for her without getting her. Waking and sleeping he thought of her: Longingly, longlingly, He tossed and turned from side to side. The human elements of the poem (lines 3-4, 7-12, 15-16, 19-20) can read as either a first or third person narrative. If such a reading is taken, the poem begins with a statement of the male persona's longing for an ideal beloved in the first stanza, depicts the withholding of fulfillment in the second, and concludes with an eventual realisation of these desires in the third stanza. The other set of formulaic lines describe, in vividly physical and tangible action, the rustic world of harvesting plants, incrementally varying the key verb of physical activity: Varied in length are the water plants; Left and right we catch them. (5-6) ... Varied in length are the water plants; Left and right we gather them. (13-14) ... Varied in length are the water plants; Left and right we cull them as vegetable. (17-18) This usage of natural images in juxtaposition to human situations was given the term xing (Ëàà) by early commentators, and was regarded as one of the three rhetorical devices of the Shi Jing. It is not easy to find an equivalent in Western literature, but xing can be explained as a method of creating the mood, atmosphere or context within which the remainder of the poem takes place, and which exerts influence over the possible meanings of the rest of the poem‚Äôs action. It has variously been translated as \\"stimulus\\", \\"stimulates\\", and \\"motif\\".See for example Pauline Yu, The Reading of Imagery in the Chinese Poetic Tradition (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987), pp. 49-50, 56-67, 74. Although there is no historical evidence to prove that the composer of \\"Guan ju\\" were intentionally employing such a rhetorical device, there have been a myriad of interpretations as to the purpose of the xing.  Traditional interpretations  The earliest known commentary on \\"Guan ju\\" is contained in the Analects, and is attributed to Confucius. Confucius praises \\"Guan ju\\" for its moderated emotions: \\"The Master said, \\"In the \\"Guan ju\\" there is joy without wantonness and sorrow without self-injury.\\"In Chinese: Â≠êÊõ∞ ÈóúÈõé Ê®ÇËÄå‰∏çÊ∑´ ÂìÄËÄå‰∏çÂÇ∑. See Confucius, The Analects, translated by D. C. Lau (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1979), III.20, p. 70. Brooks and Brooks date this portion of the Analects to 342 BCE,E. Bruce Brooks and A. Taeko Brooks, The Original Analects: Sayings of Confucius and His Successors (New York: Columbia University Press, 1998) p. 79. and this may have been when \\"Guan ju\\" first came to prominence. The Confucians were responsible for the tendency of much orthodox criticism to regard not only the Shi Jing but all literature in general as morally edifying or didactic in some way.See for example Donald Holzman, \\"Confucius and Ancient Chinese Literary Criticism\\" in Adele Rickett, ed., Chinese Approaches to Literature from Confucius to Liang Ch'i-ch'ao (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), pp. 29-38. One legend held that Confucius himself had selected the songs in the Shi Jing from an original pool of three thousand based on their moral import. From early on the poems of the Shi Jing were used for their moral communicative value. There were, however, striking disagreements among early scholars as to how to interpret \\"Guan ju\\". In pre-Qin times, at three textual traditions - the \\"Three Schools of the Poems\\" (Ë©©‰∏âÂÆ∂) of Lu, Qi, and Han - existed. These interpretations of \\"Guan ju\\" were eventually superseded by the Han Dynasty Mao commentarial tradition, which is the only tradition that has survived into the modern era in its entirety.Jeffrey Riegel, \\"Shih-ching Poetry and Didacticism in Ancient Chinese Literature\\" in The Columbia History of Chinese Literature, Victor H Mair ed. (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001) p. 100. = The Lu school reading = The first exegetical tradition saw \\"Guan ju\\" as a poem of political criticism. Although the Guan ju itself offers no hint of a satirical intent, commentators from the Lu school explain that the poem criticises the improper behaviour of King Kang of Zhou and his wife (eleventh century BCE) by presenting contrasting, positive images of male-female decorum. The Lu school held that King Kang had committed an egregious violation of ritual by being late for court one morning. The earliest references to it are in Liu Xiang's Lien√º zhuan (16 BCE) and Wang Chong's Lun heng. However, the nature of Kang's offence is best preserved in a memorial by Yang Ci in Yuan Hong's Hou Han ji: The Lu school reading evolved further towards the end of the Han dynasty. Zhang Chao, in his \\"Qiao 'Qingyi fu'\\" names the minister alluded to in Lun heng, as the Duke of Bi (Áï¢ÂÖ¨). According to Zhang Chao's version of the Lu tradition, the Duke of Bi's purpose was \\"to prevent degeneracy and reproach its progress, / Tactfully criticised and admonished the lord, his father.\\" In other words, \\"Guan ju\\" could be read as both a poem of praise, extolling the excellent match of the beautiful and good young lady and the lord, and as a poem of criticism, intended to cause the listener, King Kang, to reflect on his and his consort's shortcomings. Brief references to the dating of the poem to King Kang's reign appear in Shi Ji China's first universal history. The historian Sima Qian wrote, \\"Alas! When the house of Zhou was in decline, the \\"Guan ju\\" was composed.\\"In Chinese: Âë®ÈÅìÁº∫ Ë©©‰∫∫Êú¨‰πãË°ΩÂ∏≠ ÈóúÈõé‰Ωú. Sima Qian, Shi ji (Zhonghua shuju: Beijing, 1972) pp. 509. A similar comment appears at p. 3115. However, as Wang Chong and modern scholars have pointed out, this appears to conflict with Sima's own account of King Kang's reign, which records no deficiencies or evidence of decline.Wang Chong, \\"Xie duan pian\\", Lun Heng (Ë´ñË°°), 12.14b. See Sima Qian, \\"Annals of the House of Zhou\\", Shi ji. The Lu school interpretation was probably the dominant one during the Han Dynasty.Mark Laurent Asselin, \\"The Lu-school reading of \\"Guanju\\" as preserved in an Eastern Han Fu\\" Journal of the American Oriental Society 117.3 (1997): 427. It persisted well into the fifth century, even appearing in Fan Ye's Hou Han Shu (completed before CE 445), but was eventually eclipsed by the Mao school. = The Mao school reading = The second interpretive tradition, and the one which became dominant, chose to read \\"Guan ju\\" as a poem of praise, and specifically of the queen of the founder of the Zhou dynasty, King Wen. This reading is called the Mao school, after Mao Heng and Mao Chang, early annotators to the Shi Jing. Their notes to the Shi Jing, along with those of later scholars who agreed with them, were edited by Kong Yingda and published in the seventh century as Mao shi zheng yi (ÊØõË©©Ê≠£Áæ©). The Mao School explains the poem as a purposeful analogy, and identifies the young lady as King Wen's queen Tai Si. It reads the images of picking water grasses as literal descriptions of the queen's activities in preparation for ritual sacrifices. The preface to the poem, attributed to Wei Hong and generally including along with the Mao text, explains the meaning of \\"Guan ju\\": The prefaces to the remaining ten poems in the \\"Zhou nan\\", the first section of the Shi Jing, all describe the songs as referring to one or another aspect of the queen's virtuous influence. One century after the Maos, Zheng Xuan introduced an interesting twist to the Mao interpretation. In his eyes the \\"pure young lady\\" refers not to the queen herself, but rather to palace ladies whom their mistress, in her virtuous and jealousy-free seclusion, is seeking as additional mates for the king. Thus it is she who tosses and turns until finding them.Mao shi zheng yi, p. 55-57. The influential Song Dynasty Neo- Confucian Zhu Xi largely agreed with the Mao school, but added a remark that the poem was composed not by some unknown poet but by the ladies of the royal palace. He also differs with the Mao school by reading the scenes depicting the picking of water grasses not as literal, but as juxtaposed, analogical images like the opening couplet. = Other readings = Not all traditional readings considered that \\"Guan ju\\" contained political and allegorical references. The excavation in 1973 of the text known as Wuxingpian (‰∫îË°åÁØá) at the Mawangdui revealed a style of Confucian thinking which focused more on the moral and emotional messages evoked by the everyday human situations found in the lyrics. The Wuxingpian explains \\"Guan ju\\" as a poem about sexual desire, more specifically, the inherent human moral urge to regulate one's sexual desire to accord with the mores of one's community.Jeffrey Riegel, \\"Shih-ching Poetry and Didacticism in Ancient Chinese Literature\\" in The Columbia History of Chinese Literature, Victor H. Mair ed. (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001) p. 100. The approach is equally concerned with the business of moral didacticism, but directed to inherent personal morality, rather than the learned morality of blameless or reprehensible political figures, as in the Mao commentary.  Modern interpretations  In the second half of the nineteenth century, Western sinologists and literary scholars began to study the Shi Jing. While some of the first, including the Jesuit Seraphin Couvreur, the first translator of the text into French, persisted with readings based on the Mao school‚Äôs interpretation, the majority of Western scholarship has sought novel hermeneutic approaches. James Legge, who published one of the poem's early English translations in 1871, rejected the explanatory prefaces to the poems in the Mao text, \\"to follow which would reduce many of them to absurd enigmas\\".James Legge, The Chinese Classics, Vol. 4: The She King (Oxford: Clarendon, 1871), p. 29. The late twentieth century scholar Qu Wanli (Â±àËê¨Èáå) takes \\"Guan ju\\" as expressing the emotional anxiety and excitement of a man about to be married, whose wife is greeted at the end of the poem with the ceremonial rites of the wedding as signified by the musical instruments.Qu Wanli, Shijing quanshi (Ë©©Á∂ìË©ÆÈáã) (Taipei: Guojia tushuguan chuban she, 1983), p. 4. F√™tes et Chansons anciennes de la Chine (1911). The French translator Marcel Granet saw \\"Guan ju\\", among with the other \\"Airs of the States\\", as lyrics accompanying physical festivities. In his 1911 study F√™tes et Chansons anciennes de la Chine, Granet declared that he excluded \\"all interpretations which are symbolic or which imply subtlety in the poet.\\"Marcel Granet, Festivals and Songs of Ancient China, trans. E. D. Edwards (London: George Routledge, 1932), p. 27. Granet reads the poem as a record of a rural festival involving boys and girls beginning to court each other. The opening image of birds calling to each other is taken by Granet as a metaphor for the young couples, hiding away to seduce each other in private. The final sections of the poem, describing musical instruments are, in Granet‚Äôs schema, elements of a feast at the end of the festival - a ceremonial conclusion to the rural gathering. Arthur Waley agreed with Granet that traditional readings distort the \\"true nature\\" of the poems, but he did point out that it was facilitated by the multivalent meanings of words and social practices. For Waley, the Shi Jing was a diverse collection which does not necessarily display a unified function, and, as such, cannot be approached merely with one reading strategy. C. H. Wang has been vehemently critical of what he calls \\"a manifest distortion of this classic anthology\\" and argues that the earliest definition of poetry in Chinese tradition (in Shang Shu) links it with song rather than ethics.C. H. Wang, The Bell and the Drum: Shih Ching as Formulaic Poetry in an Oral Tradition (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1974), pp. 1-3. He considers that the Shi Jing poems have their roots in oral transmission rather than literary composition, and directed contested the claims of the Mao school that the poems are the product of specific authors referring to specific events in their lives. Pauline Yu rejects the notion that there is any form of allegory in \\"Guan ju\\".Pauline R. Yu, \\"Allegory, Allegoresis, and the Classic of Poetry\\" Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, vol. 43, No. 2 (Dec., 1983) p. 387. However, not all Western sinologists agree. Edward L. Shaughnessy argues that \\"Guan ju\\" is an example of \\"correlative thought\\" in traditional Chinese thinking:  Legacy  \\"Guan ju\\" has been the subject of countless allusions over the centuries. Cai Yong (died 192) is one of the earliest to do in his \\"Qingyi fu\\" (ÈùíË°£Ë≥¶), a poem celebrating the illicit love between a maid and the poem's male persona: \\"With the purity of \\"The Calling Ospreys\\" / She does not act perverse or contrary\\".In Chinese: ÈóúÈõé‰πãÊ¥Å ‰∏çËπàÈÇ™Èùû. \\"Guan ju\\" remains a popular subject of study for sinologists and graduate students in Chinese studies.

Biography Simon was the brother of Renaud I, Count of Dammartin, who had abducted the heiress of Boulogne, and forced her to marry him. It is thought that in order to strengthen the alliance with the Dammartins, King Philip Augustus of France allowed Simon to marry Marie, Countess of Ponthieu, who was a niece of the king, in 1208. Renaud and Simon of Dammartin would eventually ally themselves with John, King of England. In 1214 the brothers stood against Philip Augustus in the Battle of Bouvines. The French won the battle, and Renaud was imprisoned, while Simon was exiled. Marie's father William IV, Count of Ponthieu had remained loyal to Philip Augustus. When William died in 1221, Philip Augustus denied Marie her inheritance and gave Ponthieu in custody to his cousin Robert III, Count of Dreux. After the death of Philip Augustus, Marie was able to negotiate an agreement with his successor Louis VIII in 1225. Ponthieu was held by the king, and Simon would only be allowed to enter this or any other fief if he obtained royal permission. In 1231 Simon agreed to the terms and added that he would not enter into marriage negotiations for his daughters without consent of the king.

His career record was 17‚Äì9‚Äì12. Early life Contemporary sources give Pluto's birth details variously as: *13 Sep 1871, Saint John, New Brunswick *1870, Port Elizabeth, South Africa *July 1872, Saint John, New Brunswick *1870 (burial record) In a 1927 newspaper article told (though not written) by Pluto, he is described as a \\"South African colored boxer\\", and he specifically states that he was born in South Africa. A modern South African source indicates that he was born on 10 July 1872 in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Pluto worked on tug-boats as a boy, and was apprenticed to a racing stable, where he rode winners at a light weight. Career In Port Elizabeth, South Africa, at age 14 Pluto won 2 four rounders against Young Sultan and Young Berry. He stowed away on the E J Spence, a clipper barque bound for Melbourne, and settled in Port Melbourne. He found work with Caulfield racing trainer T. Brown. He attended the Lyceum Athletic Hall in Fitzroy and was matched with South Melbourne footballer Dick Doran, and with Clancy. His boxing career in NSW got off to a good start when he beat Young Browne in Newcastle, and then had a draw and a win against Young Scott. In 1888 and 1889, he fought Young Griffo to 5 straight draws. One of these fights lasted for seventy rounds. It had been decided beforehand that if both boxers were still standing that it would be declared a draw, however, it was accepted that Young Griffo had been the better boxer during the fight. Pluto moved to Western Australia in 1893. He worked as a battery attendant and physical trainer at the Bayley's Reward Gold Mine at Coolgardie. In 1894 he beat Benny Marks to win the Western Australian lightweight title at Coolgardie's Theatre Royal. In 1898 he left Australia for the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon. His first bout was against Californian boxer Kid Williams in Dawson City, which he won. His next bout was against George Dixon for the World Featherweight title. He lost to a knockout in the 10th round. He was the first South African to fight for a world title. He went on to lose his next six bouts, in the USA and the United Kingdom. Retirement Pluto returned to Western Australia in 1909, where he married and settled down. His last professional bout was in 1911 at Fremantle, with a knockout win over Alec Rogers. In retirement he worked as a boxing instructor in public schools, ran a poultry farm in Redcliffe and worked on local racecourse ground staff. Pluto had three sons and three daughters, including Bill and Cyril Pluto, who became noted welterweight boxers. Cyril, who also fought as Young Pluto, was welterweight and middleweight champion of Western Australia. He died on 3 March 1931 at Mosman Park, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, after a long heart-related illness. He was buried at the Karrakatta Cemetery.

Founded in 1948 by Crispin Bermas Vergara, Sr., its name commemorates Friar Juan Zamora of Tayabas, Quezon, the founder of the first collegiate school in Albay. History Crispin B. Vergara, Sr. 24 October 1897-5 April 1976 Zamora Memorial College was founded as Zamora Memorial Institute on October 24, 1948 by Crispin Bermas Vergara, a retired supervisor of the Division of Albay. This was in response to the growing need for secondary education of Bacacayanos. At that time, only the upper middle class Bacacayanos have access to secondary education because high schools were only available in Legazpi or Tabaco. The first campus of the institute was a rented building located in the corner of Bes and Barrameda Streets in Bacacay. A typhoon struck and the building was destroyed. Several parents and benefactors helped in reconstructing the school. For its new site, Mr. Vergara purchased a 3.7 acre parcel of land from Do√±a Beatrice Alparce which to this day is the present site of the school. The first school building constructed was made of bamboo and nipa. Through the years, this building was replaced by concrete building to withstand typhoons which frequently visit the town. Additional concrete buildings were subsequently constructed to accommodate the growing number of enrollment.ZMC Alumni Homecoming Souvenir Program In 1996, with the growing clamor for access to tertiary education in Bacacay, the Board of Trustees responded with the opening of the college department. At the time of its opening, it was fully recognized by the Commission on Higher Education. It started with two students and part-time faculty with classes in the evening. Through the years, the number of enrollment increase to approximately 500 students. With a substantial number of graduating students, in 2013, the College Department conducted a separate Commencement Exercises from High School Department. In 1998, ZMC celebrated its 50th Founding Anniversary and renewed its commitment to continue educating generations of Bacacayanos. Starting School Year 2011 - 2012, the school transitioned to K-12 curriculum pursuant to the Department of Education directive.

It is established after the signing of an intergovernmental agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey for a long-term barter. The Turkish side constructs roads and a cascade of hydropower plants in Bulgaria, and Bulgaria exports energy in return. Three hydro power plants are foreseen to be included in the cascade (Madan, Sarnitsa and Ardino), placed on the upper stream of Arda river. The groundbreaking was made in the end of 1999, planning to finish the construction of the cascade in 2006. Soon after that the project was frozen due to contradictions between the shareholders. In 2008 the Austrian company EVN expressed its interest in the Gorna Arda project. The company operates on the Bulgarian market since 2005 executing business activities in the field of distribution and trade of electricity in South-Eastern Bulgaria. On September 2, 2009 the government of the Republic of Bulgaria appointed Hydro Power Company Gorna Arda AD as the investor in the Gorna Arda Cascade. The Council of Ministers approved a letter of support for the realization of the investment project. This letter is not a state guarantee, does not burden the state budget and does not raise any financial obligations for the state. NEK, EVN and Alpine Bau expressed their wish to be shareholders in HEC Gorna Arda. In the beginning of 2010 –êlpine Bau reviewed its business development plans and decided to withdraw from the project. Thus only shareholders in the project left NEK and EVN. On July 19, 2010 in the Bulgarian Embassy in Vienna, in the presence of the Bulgarian Prime Minister Mr. Boyko Borissov, shareholders agreement for construction and operation of hydro power cascade Gorna Arda was signed. This contract arranged the collaboration base between NEK and EVN. On behalf Bulgaria the document was signed by Krasimir Parvanov, the CEO of NEK EAD, and on behalf of Austria it was signed by Burkhard Hofer, Chairperson of the Board of Directors in EVN. The establishment of the new company proves the will of EVN and NEK to restore a long time planned project for a hydro power cascade on the upper stream of Arda river in South-Eastern Bulgaria. At the moment the work is based on the technical redesign. The plan is in the region of Madan, Ardino and Kitnitsa to be constructed plants with total capacity up to 170 MW. Up to 350 GWh per year electricity will come from those plants in the Bulgarian network, this amount covers the electricity needs of over 100 000 households. This hydro power project is an important step towards using of renewable energy sources in Bulgaria. By 2020 16% of the electricity produced in Bulgaria should be from renewable energy sources. A successful implementation of Gorna Arda project could provide a specific contribution. Furthermore, the flexible production of energy from hydro power plants will contribute to the stability of the electricity supply in Bulgaria. EVN and NEK realize the great importance of this project for the Bulgarian economy and population. The preliminary work on the project started in 2010. During the construction period, new job positions will be opened in the region and stable economic impulses for the infrastructure and the tourism will be created.

By the definition of apraxia, AOS affects volitional (willful or purposeful) movement patterns, however AOS usually also affects automatic speech. Individuals with AOS have difficulty connecting speech messages from the brain to the mouth. AOS is a loss of prior speech ability resulting from a brain injury such as a stroke or progressive illness. Developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD), also known as childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) and developmental apraxia of speech (DAS); is an inability to utilize motor planning to perform movements necessary for speech during a child's language learning process. Although the causes differ between AOS and DVD, the main characteristics and treatments are similar. Presentation Apraxia of speech (AOS) is a neurogenic communication disorder affecting the motor programming system for speech production. Individuals with AOS demonstrate difficulty in speech production, specifically with sequencing and forming sounds. The Levelt model describes the speech production process in the following three consecutive stages: conceptualization, formulation, and articulation. According to the Levelt model, apraxia of speech would fall into the articulation region. The individual does not suffer from a language deficiency, but has difficulty in the production of language in an audible manner. Notably, this difficulty is limited to vocal speech, and does not affect sign-language production. The individual knows exactly what they want to say, but there is a disruption in the part of the brain that sends the signal to the muscle for the specific movement. Individuals with acquired AOS demonstrate hallmark characteristics of articulation and prosody (rhythm, stress or intonation) errors. Coexisting characteristics may include groping and effortful speech production with self- correction, difficulty initiating speech, abnormal stress, intonation and rhythm errors, and inconsistency with articulation. Wertz et al., (1984) describe the following five speech characteristics that an individual with apraxia of speech may exhibit: ;Effortful trial and error with groping :Groping is when the mouth searches for the position needed to create a sound. When this trial and error process occurs, sounds may be held out longer, repeated or silently voiced. In some cases, an AOS sufferer may be able to produce certain sounds on their own, easily and unconsciously, but when prompted by another to produce the same sound the patient may grope with their lips, using volitional control (conscious awareness of the attempted speech movements), while struggling to produce the sound. ;Self correction of errors :Patients are aware of their speech errors and can attempt to correct themselves. This can involve distorted consonants, vowels, and sound substitutions. People with AOS often have a much greater understanding of speech than they are able to express. This receptive ability allows them to attempt self correction. ;Abnormal rhythm, stress and intonation :Sufferers of AOS present with prosodic errors which include irregular pitch, rate, and rhythm. This impaired prosody causes their speech to be: too slow or too fast and highly segmented (many pauses). An AOS speaker also stresses syllables incorrectly and in a monotone. As a result, the speech is often described as 'robotic'. When words are produced in a monotone with equal syllabic stress, a word such as 'tectonic' may sound like 'tec-ton-ic' as opposed to 'tec-TON- ic'. These patterns occur even though the speakers are aware of the prosodic patterns that should be used. ;Inconsistent articulation errors on repeated speech productions of the same utterance :When producing the same utterance in different instances, a person with AOS may have difficulty using and maintaining the same articulation that was previously used for that utterance. On some days, people with AOS may have more errors, or seem to \\"lose\\" the ability to produce certain sounds for an amount of time. Articulation also becomes more difficult when a word or phrase requires an articulation adjustment, in which the lips and tongue must move in order to shift between sounds. For example, the word \\"baby\\" needs less mouth adjustment than the word \\"dog\\" requires, since producing \\"dog\\" requires two tongue/lips movements to articulate. ;Difficulty initiating utterances :Producing utterances becomes a difficult task in patients with AOS, which results in various speech errors. The errors in completing a speech movement gesture may increase as the length of the utterance increases. Since multisyllabic words are difficult, those with AOS use simple syllables and a limited range of consonants and vowels. Causes Apraxia of speech can be caused by impairment to parts of the brain that control muscle movement and speech. However, identifying a particular region of the brain in which AOS always occurs has been controversial. Various patients with damage to left subcortical structures, regions of the insula, and Broca‚Äôs area have been diagnosed with AOS. Most commonly it is triggered by vascular lesions, but AOS can also arise due to tumors and trauma. =Acute apraxia of speech= Stroke-associated AOS is the most common form of acquired AOS, making up about 60% of all reported acquired AOS cases. This is one of the several possible disorders that can result from a stroke, but only about 11% of stroke cases involve this disorder. Brain damage to the neural connections, and especially the neural synapses, during the stroke can lead to acquired AOS. Most cases of stroke-associated AOS are minor, but in the most severe cases, all linguistic motor function can be lost and must be relearned. Since most with this form of AOS are at least fifty years old, few fully recover to their previous level of ability to produce speech. Other disorders and injuries of the brain that can lead to AOS include (traumatic) dementia, progressive neurological disorders, and traumatic brain injury. =Progressive apraxia of speech= Recent research has established the existence of primary progressive apraxia of speech caused by neuroanatomic motor atrophy. For a long time, this disorder was not distinguished from other motor speech disorders such as dysarthria and in particular primary progressive aphasia. Many studies have been done trying to identify areas in the brain in which this particular disorder occurs or at least to show that it occurs in different areas of the brain than other disorders. One study observed 37 patients with neurodegenerative speech disorders to determine whether or not it is distinguishable from other disorders, and if so where in the brain it can be found. Using speech and language, neurological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging testing, the researchers came to the conclusion that PAS does exist and that it correlates to superior lateral premotor and supplementary motor atrophy. However, because PAS is such a rare and recently discovered disorder, many studies do not have enough subjects to observe to make data entirely conclusive. Diagnosis Apraxia of speech can be diagnosed by a speech language pathologist (SLP) through specific exams that measure oral mechanisms of speech. The oral mechanisms exam involves tasks such as pursing lips, blowing, licking lips, elevating the tongue, and also involves an examination of the mouth. A complete exam also involves observation of the patient eating and talking. SLPs do not agree on a specific set of characteristics that make up the apraxia of speech diagnosis, so any of the characteristics from the section above could be used to form a diagnosis. Patients may be asked to perform other daily tasks such as reading, writing, and conversing with others. In situations involving brain damage, an MRI brain scan also helps identify damaged areas of the brain. A differential diagnosis must be used in order to rule out other similar or alternative disorders. Although disorders such as expressive aphasia, conduction aphasia, and dysarthria involve similar symptoms as apraxia of speech, the disorders must be distinguished in order to correctly treat the patients. While AOS involves the motor planning or processing stage of speech, aphasic disorders can involve other language processes. According to Ziegler et al., this difficulty in diagnosis derives from the unknown causes and function of the disorder, making it hard to set definite parameters for AOS identification. Specifically, he explains that oral-facial apraxia, dysarthria, and aphasic phonological impairment are the three distinctly different disorders that cause individuals to display symptoms that are often similar to those of someone with AOS, and that these close relatives must be correctly ruled out by a Speech Language Pathologist before AOS can be given as a diagnosis. In this way, AOS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and is generally recognized when all other similar speech sound production disorders are eliminated.Ziegler, W., Aichert, I, & Staiger, A. (2012). American Speech-Language-Hearing Association supplement: Apraxia of speech: Concepts and controversies. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 55, 1485-1501. =Possible co- morbid aphasias= AOS and expressive aphasia (also known as Broca's aphasia) are commonly mistaken as the same disorder mainly because they often occur together in patients. Although both disorders present with symptoms such as a difficulty producing sounds due to damage in the language parts of the brain, they are not the same. The main difference between these disorders lies in the ability to comprehend spoken language; patients with apraxia are able to fully comprehend speech, while patients with aphasia are not always fully able to comprehend others' speech. Conduction aphasia is another speech disorder that is similar to, but not the same as, apraxia of speech. Although patients who suffer from conduction aphasia have full comprehension of speech, as do AOS sufferers, there are differences between the two disorders. Patients with conduction aphasia are typically able to speak fluently, but they do not have the ability to repeat what they hear. Similarly, dysarthria, another motor speech disorder, is characterized by difficulty articulating sounds. The difficulty in articulation does not occur due in planning the motor movement, as happens with AOS. Instead, dysarthria is caused by inability in or weakness of the muscles in the mouth, face, and respiratory system. Management In cases of acute AOS (stroke), spontaneous recovery may occur, in which previous speech abilities reappear on their own. All other cases of acquired AOS require a form of therapy; however the therapy varies with the individual needs of the patient. Typically, treatment involves one-on-one therapy with a speech language pathologist (SLP). For severe forms of AOS, therapy may involve multiple sessions per week, which is reduced with speech improvement. Another main theme in AOS treatment is the use of repetition in order to achieve a large number of target utterances, or desired speech usages. There are various treatment techniques for AOS. One technique, called the Linguistic Approach, utilizes the rules for sounds and sequences. This approach focuses on the placement of the mouth in forming speech sounds. Another type of treatment is the Motor-Programming Approach, in which the motor movements necessary for speech are practiced. This technique utilizes a great amount of repetition in order to practice the sequences and transitions that are necessary in between production of sounds. Research about the treatment of apraxia has revealed four main categories: articulatory-kinematic, rate/rhythm control, intersystemic facilitation/reorganization treatments, and alternative/augmentative communication. *Articulatory-kinematic treatments almost always require verbal production in order to bring about improvement of speech. One common technique for this is modeling or repetition in order to establish the desired speech behavior. Articulatory-kinematic treatments are based on the importance of patients to improve spatial and temporal aspects of speech production. *Rate and rhythm control treatments exist to improve errors in patients‚Äô timing of speech, a common characteristic of Apraxia. These techniques often include an external source of control like metronomic pacing, for example, in repeated speech productions. *Intersystemic reorganization/facilitation techniques often involve physical body or limb gestural approaches to improve speech. Gestures are usually combined with verbalization. It is thought that limb gestures may improve the organization of speech production. *Finally, alternative and augmentative communication approaches to treatment of apraxia are highly individualized for each patient. However, they often involve a \\"comprehensive communication system\\" that may include \\"speech, a communication book aid, a spelling system, a drawing system, a gestural system, technologies, and informed speech partners\\". One specific treatment method is referred to as PROMPT. This acronym stands for Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets, and takes a hands on multidimensional approach at treating speech production disorders. PROMPT therapists integrate physical-sensory, cognitive-linguistic, and social- emotional aspects of motor performance. The main focus is developing language interaction through this tactile-kinetic approach by using touch cues to facilitate the articulatory movements associated with individual phonemes, and eventually words. One study describes the use of electropalatography (EPG) to treat a patient with severe acquired apraxia of speech. EPG is a computer- based tool for assessment and treatment of speech motor issues. The program allows patients to see the placement of articulators during speech production thus aiding them in attempting to correct errors. Originally after two years of speech therapy, the patient exhibited speech motor and production problems including problems with phonation, articulation, and resonance. This study showed that EPG therapy gave the patient valuable visual feedback to clarify speech movements that had been difficult for the patient to complete when given only auditory feedback. While many studies are still exploring the various treatment methods, a few suggestions from ASHA for treating apraxia patients include the integration of objective treatment evidence, theoretical rationale, clinical knowledge and experience, and the needs and goals of the patient History and terminology The term apraxia was first defined by Hugo Karl Liepmann in 1908 as the \\"inability to perform voluntary acts despite preserved muscle strength.\\" In 1969, Frederic L. Darley coined the term \\"apraxia of speech\\", replacing Liepmann's original term \\"apraxia of the glosso-labio-pharyngeal structures.\\" Paul Broca had also identified this speech disorder in 1861, which he referred to as \\"aphemia\\": a disorder involving difficulty of articulation despite having intact language skills and muscular function. The disorder is currently referred to as \\"apraxia of speech\\", but was also formerly termed \\"verbal dyspraxia\\". The term apraxia comes from the Greek root \\"praxis,\\" meaning the performance of action or skilled movement. Adding the prefix \\"a\\", meaning absence, or \\"dys\\", meaning abnormal or difficult, to the root \\"praxis\\", both function to imply speech difficulties related to movement. Research Many researchers are investigating the characteristics of apraxia of speech and the most effective treatment methods. Below are a couple of the recent findings: Sound Production Treatment: Articulatory-kinematic treatments have the strongest evidence of their use in treating Acquired Apraxia of Speech. These treatments use the facilitation of movement, positioning, timing, and articulators to improve speech production. Sound Production Treatment (SPT) is an articulatory- kinematic treatment that has received more research than many other methods. It combines modeling, repetition, minimal pair contrast, integral stimulation, articulatory placement cueing, and verbal feedback. It was developed to improve the articulation of targeted sounds in the mid-1990s. SPT shows consistent improvement of trained sounds in trained and untrained words. The best results occur with eight to ten exemplars of the targeted sound to promote generalization to untrained exemplars of trained sounds. In addition, maintenance effects are the strongest with 1‚Äì2 months post-treatment with sounds that reached high accuracy during treatment. Therefore, the termination of treatment should not be determined by performance criteria, and not by the number of sessions the client completes, in order to have the greatest long- term effects. While there are many parts of SPT that should receive further investigation, it can be expected that it will improve the production of targeted sounds for speakers with apraxia of Speech. Repeated Practice & Rate/Rhythm Control Treatments: Julie Wambaugh‚Äôs research focuses on clinically applicable treatments for acquired apraxia of speech. She recently published an article examining the effects of repeated practice and rate/rhythm control on sound production accuracy. Wambaugh and colleagues studied the effects of such treatment for 10 individuals with acquired apraxia of speech. The results indicate that repeated practice treatment results in significant improvements in articulation for most clients. In addition, rate/rhythm control helped some clients, but not others. Thus, incorporating repeated practice treatment into therapy would likely help individuals with AOS. Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3) and Rapid Syllable Transition Treatment (ReST): A 2018 Cochrane review found that when delivered intensively both the NDP-3 and ReST may effect improvement in word accuracy in 4 - 12 year old children with CAS.

Encouraged by its success, he composed a ballad opera of his own, Robin Hood, with a subtext that reflected the difficulties faced by the unemployed miners. It was first performed in 1934 by the local villagers, miners, and students at the work camps. Although a success both with the participants and the audience, the work bears little resemblance to the composer's mature style, and Tippett would later not allow it to be performed.Myers (2004) Nevertheless, some of the songs from the opera were sung again in 2009 at the Station Hotel in Boosbeck and recorded for the BBC Radio 3 Programme Music Matters.North (2009) References ;Notes ;Sources * Anderson, Don (2008) Program Notes: Nakamatsu Plays Mozart, The Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra.

The Yenice‚ÄìG√∂nen Fault is the southernmost splay at the western end of the 260px The 1953 Yenice‚ÄìG√∂nen earthquake occurred at 21:06 local time (19:06 UTC on 18 March in the province of √áanakkale and Balƒ±kesir in the Marmara Region at western Turkey. It had a magnitude 7.5 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused widespread damage, killing 1,070 and causing damage that was estimated at US$3,570,000 repair value. Tectonic setting The tectonics of northern and eastern Turkey are dominated by the two strike-slip fault zones that accommodate the west to southwestward movement of the Anatolian Plate relative to the Eurasian Plate and the Arabian Plate as it is effectively being squeezed out by convergence between them. The quake occurred along the Yenice‚ÄìG√∂nen Fault, which is a southern extension of the North Anatolian Fault Zone. Damage and casualties The quake had a surface wave magnitude of 7.3 and it killed at least 1070; 998 of those deaths were in Yenice, with another 50 in G√∂nen, 20 in √áan, and 3 in Manyas. The cost of repair was estimated at US$3,570,000. Several thousand buildings were affected in the Can-Yenice-Gonen area. Damage of intensity VI occurred at Sakarya (Adapazari), Bursa, Edirne, Istanbul and Izmir. The quake was felt throughout the Aegean Islands and in much of mainland Greece, with damage occurring as far away as Crete. Shaking was also recorded in Bulgaria. Although officials predicted the earthquake would cause only 265 deaths, it multiplied with a death toll seven times the number as expected. Characteristics Approximately of surface faulting occurred, with as much as of strike-slip (horizontal) faulting was observed by geologists east of Yenice. Aftermath The damage caused by this earthquake led to a new national reconstruction law in Turkey. In Greece the damage was severe enough that new building codes were introduced. Future seismic hazard Trenching and other fieldwork along the trace of the Yenice‚ÄìG√∂nen Fault has identified three earthquakes before the 1953 event, about 1440 AD, between 620 and 1270 AD, and another event of uncertain age. These past events give a mean recurrence interval for large earthquakes of 660¬±160 years. This indicates that there is no significant current threat from ruptures along this fault zone.

The abbey was founded on the banks of the Aa in the 7th century by Bishop Audomar of Th√©rouanne, who is now better known as . He sent the monks Bertin, Momelin, and Ebertram from Sithiu (now ) to proselytize among the pagans in the region. The abbey soon became one of the most influential monasteries in northern Europe and ranked in importance with Elnon (now St-Amand Abbey) and . Its library included the codex of the Leiden Aratea, from which two copies were made. The Annals of St Bertin are an important source of the history of 9th- century France. Already in the 9th century, the abbey had a priory in Poperinge. A Romanesque church was constructed in the mid-11th century.Some carved capitals and fragments of mosaics from this structure are conserved in the museum in H√¥tel Sandelin, St-Omer. It was high with a tower. It included a large 14th-century semi-circular sanctuary with five side-chapels. It served as a model for the church, whose construction was not completed until the beginning of the 16th century. Bishop Herman of Ramsbury was a monk at the abbey from 1055 to 1058, having abandoned his duties but not his title, which he resumed upon his election as bishop of Sherborne. From 1106, the abbey had the right of appointing the priests at Lissewege and Ruiselede. William Clito was buried here in 1128. The abbey had a 'refuge-house' in the now-demolished Sint-Lodewijkscollege in Bruges. The abbey ceased to flourish after the 13th century, although it survived until its closure during the French Revolution. In 1830, the commune ordered the demolition of the church, though they spared the tower. The buttress they erected to support it is still visible, although the tower itself collapsed in 1947 owing to damage sustained in the shelling of the town during World War II. St-Omer's town hall was constructed with stone removed from the site in 1834.
