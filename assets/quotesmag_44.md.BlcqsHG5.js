Kismat Ki Kathputaliyaan is an Indian television series that aired on Zee TV channel. The series premiered on 1 March 2010 and the final episode aired on 8 July 2010. Plot Set in Rajasthan, Do Saheliyaan focuses on the forbidden friendship between the daughter of a wealthy Rajput, Maithili, and a poor Rabari village girl, Bhavri. Although they are best friends, they cannot be together because of the differences in their castes and economic backgrounds. The story begins with Bhavri and Maithili as young children. Bhavri's uncle Badri elopes with Maithili's aunt Roop. This creates an uproar between the two castes. Maithili runs to rescue her friend, who is caught in the turmoil. Bhavri's mother Toral sees that Maithili's life is in danger, and runs into the massacre. As Maithili's brother is about to accidentally hit his sister, Toral takes the blow. This kills her and also separates Bhavri's uncle from Maithili's aunt. Maithili's grandmother (the head of her household) proclaims that Roop is a disgrace, and tells the latter that Badri is dead. Badri, his life in danger, flees his village. During Toral's funeral, her younger sister Kalindi appears. She is traumatized by her sister's death and vows revenge on the Rajputs. Kalindi marries Bhavri's father and becomes her niece's stepmother. The friends grow up and eventually unite Roop and Badri. Because of this, Maithili's grandmother and Bhavri's father wish to get the girls, married to keep them out of further trouble. Kalindi takes this opportunity to disgrace Maithili and her family. Maithili's wedding has been arranged with an elite Rajput, Shaurya Singh Shekhawat, a military officer. Kalindi goes to Shaurya's border camp, switching Maithili's photograph with Bhavri's in the hope that Shaurya would believe that his future in-laws were trying to deceive him. Shaurya sees Bhavri's picture and falls in love with her. Bhavri's marriage is more difficult to arrange since Maithili's grandmother has spread rumors about her throughout the village. It is the talented and educated Rabari boy, Anadi, who stands up for Bhavri (after watching her from afar) and agrees to marry her. The girls have not seen the men whom they will wed. Maithili and Bhavri's weddings are on the same day. Maithili gifts her friend an identical wedding dress to her own. They are happy that both will be going to the same honeymoon destination, on the same train, finally free to be friends. However, fate has something else in mind. Their train crashes. Shaurya frantically searches for his wife in the rubble and finds Bhavri (the girl from the photograph) unconscious. He picks her up and takes her away. Maithili runs into Anadi, and they search for their respective spouses in the wreckage. Unsuccessful, Anadi takes Maithili home, since she has nowhere else to go. Bhavri wakes up with the romantic Shaurya and assumes he is her husband Anadi. She does not take her husband's name (since it is considered disrespectful), and Shaurya gives her a nickname; this continues the misunderstanding. Bhavri falls in love with the smitten Shaurya, and they consummate their relationship. When Anadi brings Maithili to his house, his family assumes that she is their daughter-in-law. Anadi's father is injured after getting into an accident. For his sake, Maithili and Anadi continue the charade. Anadi's broken family grows attached to Maithili (especially his mother, Maya, who says that Maithili is the source of good luck for the house). However, Anadi knows he cannot force Maithili to stay in his house, and she again searches for her husband. Meanwhile, Shaurya has asked Bhavri to go to his estranged family's house; at the train station, she meets Anadi. When Anadi explains that he is her husband, Bhavri puts the puzzle pieces together and remembers inconsistencies in her interaction with Shaurya. She realizes she consummated her marriage with the wrong man and feels she has sinned. Heartbroken, she tries to commit suicide; Anadi rescues her. They decide to remedy the situation together. Bhavri goes to Shaurya's house and reconciles him with his parents. She meets resistance when her ignorance of Rajput customs shows, but his family gradually accepts and loves her. Meanwhile, Anadi brings Maithili to Shaurya's home. She is introduced as Bhavri's friend and tries to win her in-laws' support. However, she finds resistance from Bhavri (who confesses that she loves Shaurya and has consummated her relationship with him). Maithili is heartbroken. Maithili's parents have discovered the mix-up and the fact that Bhavri is masquerading as their daughter. They confront Shaurya, who invites them to his house to find out what is going on. However, on their way they have an accident; Maithili's parents and Shaurya die. Bhavri and Maithili are grief-stricken: Bhavri by the loss of Shaurya and Maithili by the loss of her parents. Bhavri then discovers she is pregnant; Shaurya's family is comforted that he has left part of himself behind. Maithili now feels unwelcome in Shaurya's home, and wants to return to her parents' house; however, her grandmother makes it clear that she is not welcome there either. Maithili's grandmother blames her (and her friendship with a Rabari) for her parents' death. Left with nowhere to go, Maithili stays with Anadi at his home. Slowly, Anadi and Maithili's friendship turns into love and they get married. As Anadi and Maithili's relationship blossoms, Bhavri and Kalindi come to their house. Bhavri poses as Maithili's younger sister. Kalindi accuses Maithili of trying to steal Bhavri's husband to avenge herself on the latter; however, Maithili assures her that she is truly in love with Anadi. Maithili and Anadi discover that Shaurya's family members found out Bhavri's true identity and threw her out of their home. Wanting to avoid having her child called a bastard, Bhavri decides to make the world believe that Anadi was the child's father. She drugs and tries to seduce him but without success. She shows doctored photographs of them to Maithili, who stands by her husband, informing Bhavri that she too is pregnant. The friends eventually reconcile. Maithili's baby boy is born prematurely, and it is feared that she may die. However, mother and child survive. Bhavri gives birth to a daughter, saying that she will die soon since the birth was risky. Maya promises that Maithili's son will marry Bhavri's daughter when the two children grow up. After Bhavri dies, Anadi tells Maithili not to cry; the love of the two friends will continue in their children. Cast * Sulagna Panigrahi ...

He is the founder of Buck Angel Entertainment, a media production company. A transsexual man, he received the 2007 AVN Award as Transsexual Performer of the Year; he now works as an advocate, educator, lecturer, and writer. Angel served on the Board of Directors of the Woodhull Freedom Foundation from 2010 to 2016; the foundation works to affirm sexual freedom as a fundamental human right through advocacy and education. Earlier years Angel was born in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, California assigned female and given a feminine name. Growing up as a tomboy, his gender-atypical behavior during childhood was generally accepted at home, but as his secondary sex characteristics continued to develop around age 16, his home and school life became increasingly tense. He was subjected to bullying in school, due to gender non-conforming behavior and clothing. Angel described the bullying as harming his communication skills as a result of psychological distress. To cope with his distress, he used alcohol and marijuana as a means of self-medication. After a suicidal gesture in high school, his parents sent him to therapy. They thought that he needed help because he claimed to have reached a point of \\"total disconnection\\" from society. This was not well received by his family, and according to Angel, \\"They were going to put me in a mental institution.\\" Unaware of the existence of treatments for gender dysphoria such as hormone replacement therapy, he lived for years trying to conform to expectations of femininity, during which time he took drugs and drank alcohol. Though he was employed as a female professional model, he was generally dissatisfied with his identity and existence, and \\"was not loving life\\". He turned to running as a means of isolation and source of validation.  Gender transition  Angel was unable to find appropriate help for completing his gender transition during his adolescent years. He eventually met a therapist who affirmed his gender instead of viewing him as a \\"gay woman\\". Angel began researching various methods of medical transition, and began this process at the age of 28. Angel and his therapist got in contact with an endocrinologist who worked primarily with transgender women as opposed to transgender men. This was because Angel was one of the earliest trans men to be allowed hormonal transition, due to which there was limited data on prior cases like his. Angel was, as his doctor stated, \\"going to be my guinea pig\\" (for human subject research), where experimentation was the main course of action in helping him. From then on, Angel's doctor began prescribing him test dosages of testosterone throughout a six-month period until a value solidified to fit his needs. Eventually, he was taking 1-cc doses of testosterone every 10 days. Afterward, Angel began focusing on his physical appearance and searched for a surgeon that dealt with upper-body modifications to remove his breasts. Bottom surgery was another aspect he was looking to change, because he wanted to have a penis to fit the male schema. However, he quickly realized that there was no sufficient technology at the time to create what he desired. He chose not to undergo genital surgery and currently considers his medical transition complete. Adult film career Buck Angel Angel began to produce and star in his own line of adult films under the imprint Buck Angel Entertainment. By this time he identified and presented as male, and had not had genital surgery, so he promoted these works describing himself as \\"The Man With a Pussy\\". This has become his trademark. In 2005, he appeared in the Titan Media release Cirque Noir, becoming the first trans man to be featured in an all-male film produced by a company specializing in gay male porn. The same year he performed in Allanah Starr's Big Boob Adventures (directed by transgender woman Gia Darling), which featured the first filmed sex scene between a trans woman (Allanah Starr) and a trans man. The performance was nominated for the AVN Awards' Most Outrageous Sex Scene. In 2007 Angel became the first and only trans man to win Transsexual Performer of the Year at the AVN Awards. His 2008 performance in Buckback Mountain received nominations for \\"Best Alternative Release\\" and \\"Best Specialty Release\\" at the GayVN Awards. Angel also appears in Naked, a 2008 documentary book and film about the adult film industry, by director Ed Powers. In the film he appears in a sex scene with porn star Wolf Hudson, produced by mainstream photographer Justin Lubin.Buck Angel, Ed Powers directed documentary \\"NAKED\\" . Retrieved October 28, 2008. Angel (center), with Michael Brandon and Scott Spears  Educational work  Angel's pornographic content was one of the building blocks that set the foundation for his future educational demonstrations. He broadened the industry's, along with its viewers', perception of sexuality and gender by popularizing trans male porn. He was unaware of the positive effects that he had on the community until after a few years into his work. With passing time, his work in porn evolved into advocacy. Nevertheless, the conversion of porn into an educational role was a tough task because of the stigma behind his work with sexual content. Angel's porn star identity made it difficult for him to express his ideas, as he felt he couldn't speak on behalf of himself. Moreover the porn industry did not know what to make of his shift to sex education. Additionally, the hostility from the trans community did not contribute positively to his image, as they believed he was fetishizing the trans community. In time, Angel had the opportunity to be a guest speaker for Ideacity in 2010‚ÄîCanada's ‚Äúpremier meeting of the minds‚Äù‚Äîwhere he talked about his physical changes and emotional adaptation from his transition. During this presentation, he challenged the ideas of what makes a man through his own narrative and struggles. In short, he illustrates how the societal construct of masculinity is strict and unwavering; because of this, he is not considered to be under this category simply because he has a vagina. In 2012, Angel began to transition from the porn industry to sex education and began touring the world speaking about human sexuality. He coined the catchphrase \\"it's not what's between your legs that defines you\\" and his presentation \\"Bucking the System\\" re-defines traditional notions of gender by educating his audience about gender fluidity and identity politics. Angel also tours to do Q & A sessions about his documentary, Sexing the Transman and the autobiographical film \\"Mr. Angel\\". He has made appearances at many universities around the world, as well as Pride events and film festivals. He has spoken at Sex Week at Yale University and at IdeaCity10 in Toronto. In October 2010, Angel contributed to sex educator and columnist Dan Savage's \\"It Gets Better\\" project by uploading Angel's own personal coming out story to YouTube. He has also produced multiple public service announcements on the topics of positive body image, LGBTQ family acceptance, queer people of colour and transgender health and well-being. Angel also engages in education about safe sex for trans men. In 2012, Angel became a contributor to The Feminist Porn Book, an anthology by feminist scholars and sex workers about understanding pornography and how feminists direct, act in, produce and consume porn. Between 2010 and 2015, he created an award-winning series about trans male sexuality called \\"Sexing The Transman XXX\\", which is now in its fourth installment. This film won \\"Most Tantalizing Trans Film\\" at the \\"Feminist Porn Awards\\" in 2012. Angel wanted individuals to: # \\"Comprehend the fact that one‚Äôs genitals do not define your gender, nor who you are as a person.‚Äù # ‚ÄúLearn how to acknowledge, affirm, and deal with your own individual gender and sexuality, regardless of identity.‚Äù # ‚ÄúHave the ability to let go of social constructs in order to become more comfortable and self-accepting.‚Äù Other activities Angel has appeared on various talk shows including those of Howard Stern, Tyra Banks, and Maury Povich; as well as Secret Lives of Women in the US, the Morning Show in the UK, and the Jensen Show in the Netherlands. British artist Marc Quinn included a life-size sculpture of Angel in his global tour. Angel posed for Quinn's sculpture series on human transformations in 2010; the series was revealed at London's White Cube gallery. He was featured in four different bronze sculptures including two solo pieces, and two with Allanah Starr. The life-sized sculpture of Angel is now a permanent fixture at the Art Gallery of South Australia. In 2012 he created a dating website for trans men called BuckAngelDating.com, because \\"there was still no special dating site catering to the unique needs of trans men.\\" Angel created \\"Trantastic Storytelling\\" in 2015, a service which offers opportunities for trans people to share their life experiences for educational purposes. In 2016, Angel partnered with Perfect Fit Brand to create a sex toy specifically for the FTM trans people. The product is meant to reduce gender dysphoria and help trans men connect with their bodies and their sexuality. In 2020, Angel launched a cannabis delivery service, Wings Of Wellness, aimed at LGBTQ customers. Personal life Angel was married to San Francisco-based dominatrix Karin Winslow (known professionally as Ilsa Strix). He filed for divorce when Winslow left him for a client, film director Lana Wachowski.Can Larry Wachowski really have changed sex between pictures? Damon Wise investigates The Guardian.

Many Heterocarpus shrimp are known for using bioluminescence as a defense, spitting it on predators. Studies about their feeding habits, and the fact that they may be found in the stomach contents of some pelagic sharks and other fishes is interpreted as they have benthic habits, but they do migrations to the water column at night. Some species of this genus have high fishery potential, such as H. reedi and H. laevigatus.

Cavalieri was 23 years old when Michelangelo met him in 1532, at the age of 57. The young nobleman was exceptionally handsome, and his appearance seems to have fit the artist's notions of ideal masculine beauty, for Michelangelo described him as \\"light of our century, paragon of all the world.\\"Howard Hibbard, Michelangelo, New York, 1974, 229. The two men remained lifelong lovers, and Cavalieri was present at the artist's death.  Biography  Tommaso dei Cavalieri was the son of Mario de‚ÄôCavalieri and Cassandra Bonaventura. Cavalieri was born between 1512 and 1519, but the exact date of his birth is unknown. Cavalieri paid for the mass in the memory of his brother Emilio on 6 September 1536, which is mentioned in an official document, translated by Gerda Panofsky- Soergel. This is the only document that mentions the age of Tommaso, stating \\"he is older than 16, but younger than 25\\". Warren Kirkendale, in his book \\"Emilio de' Cavalieri \\"Gentiluomo Romano\\"\\", corrects Panofsky-Soergel‚Äôs reading of the document as stating that Cavalieri was ‚Äòno more than 16‚Äô, meaning he was ‚Äòbut a boy of twelve‚Äô when he met Michelangelo. Cavalieri's parents married in November 1509, and had one son, Emilio, before Tommaso was born. After the deaths of his father in 1524, and his older brother, Emilio, in 1536, Tommaso officially became the head of Cavalieri household. His first position in Roman government was caporione of his neighborhood of Sant‚ÄôEustachio, which he took in 1539. it was noted that Cavalieri did not participate in civic government extensively, compared to his peers, although Cavalieri would serve in this position five times (in 1539, 1542, 1546, 1558, and 1562). Twice he occupied the post of Conservatore, the highest-ranking office a Roman citizen could occupy (in 1564 and 1571). Tommaso married Lavinia della Valle in 1544 in Rome. Lavinia was born sometime between 1527 and 1530. She was a daughter of Lorenzo Stefano della Valle and Giulia Caffarelli, and a cousin of Cardinal Andrea della Valle. The marriage of Tommaso and Lavinia was a continuation of longstanding tradition of marriagies between Cavalieri and della Valle families, who had been related by marriage at least since the fifteenth century. The connection of the families was shown when Tommaso dei Cavalieri had sought shelter in Cardinal Andrea della Valle‚Äôs palace, where Lavinia's mother also found refuge, accompanied by three of her children, most likely Lavinia's older sisters, Orinzia, Polimnia, and Porzia during the Sack of Rome in 1527. Tommaso Cavalieri's marriage produced two sons, Mario, probably born in 1548, and Emilio, born by 1552, who would go on to become a renowned composer. The marriage lasted nine years, ending with Lavinia della Valle's death in early November 1553. Lavinia was buried in the church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, where both the Cavalieri and della Valle families had chapels. Cavalieri was made one of Convervatori in 1554 and took the position responsible for supervising construction at the Campidoglio, which Michelangelo had begun restorating in 1538. Work on this complex project, involving the renovation of the existing Palazzo dei Conservatori and Palazzo Senatorio, as well as construction of a third building, the Palazzo Nuovo did not begin until 1542 and would not be fully realized until 1662. Cavalieri was co-director for construction from 1554 to 1575 and supervised the project through its most productive phase of development. Despite him sharing responsibility for the construction with Prospero Boccapaduli, Cavalieri is mentioned to have been primarily responsible for the realization of Michelangelo's designs, while Boccapaduli managed the financial and administrative tasks.  Relationship with Michelangelo  Michelangelo Buonarroti met the young Tommaso dei Cavalieri during a stay in Rome in 1532. Michelangelo was 57 years old at the time and Tommaso three times his younger. There is no certain image of Tommaso survived, but the contemporaries mentioned he was good looking and cultivated. Benedetto Varchi wrote that Cavalieri was of incomparable beauty with graceful manners, so excellent en endowment and so charming a demeanor that he indeed deserved, and still deserves, the more to be loved the better he is known. Michelangelo became infatuated with the young Roman patrician. Vasari noted that Infinitely more than any other friend, Michelangelo loved the young Tommaso, who became the object of Michelangelo's passion, his muse and the inspiration for letters, numerous poems, and works of visual art. The pair would remain devoted to each other until Michelangelo's death in 1564. The earliest survived letter from Tommaso to Michelangelo is dated by 1 January 1533. The letter gives clues to their budding relationship through a conversation about art. According to Cavalieri, they are united by a mutual love for art. Tommaso's letter refers to Those works of mine that you have seen with your own eyes, and which have caused you to show me no small affection‚Äô. Poems Michelangelo dedicated approximately 30 of his total 300 poems to Cavalieri, which made them the artist's largest sequence of poems. Most were sonnets, although there were also madrigals and quatrains. The central theme of all of them was the artist's love for the young nobleman.Chris Ryan, The Poetry of Michelangelo: An Introduction, Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd., 97‚Äì99. Some modern commentators assert that the relationship was merely a Platonic affection, even suggesting that Michelangelo was seeking a surrogate son.\\"Michelangelo\\", The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Macropaedia, Volume 24, page 58, 1991. The text goes so far as to claim, 'These have naturally been interpreted as indications that Michelangelo was a homosexual, but such a reaction according to the artist's own statement would be that of the ignorant'. However, their homoerotic nature was recognized in his own time, so that a decorous veil was drawn across them by his grand-nephew, Michelangelo the Younger, who published an edition of the poetry in 1623 with the gender of pronouns changed. John Addington Symonds, the early British homosexual activist, undid this change by translating the original sonnets into English and writing a two-volume biography, published in 1893. The sonnets are the first large sequence of poems in any modern tongue addressed by one man to another, predating Shakespeare's sonnets to his young friend by a good fifty years. Examples include the sonnet G.260. Michelangelo re-iterates his neo- Platonic love for Cavalieri when in the first line of the sonnet he states \\"Love is not always a harsh and deadly sin.\\" In the sonnet G.41 Michelangelo states that Tommaso is all that can be. He represents pity, love and piety. This is seen in the third stanza: :l'amor mi prende e la belt√† mi lega; :la piet√†, la merc√® con dolci sguardi :ferma speranz' al cor par che ne doni. :Love takes me captive; beauty binds my soul; :Pity and mercy with their gentle eyes :Wake in my heart a hope that cannot cheat One of the most famous of Michelangelo's poems is G.94, which is also called the \\"Silkworm.\\" In the sonnet he wants to be garments to clothe the body of Cavalieri. Drawings Michelangelo also sent Cavalieri four highly finished drawings, termed by Johannes Wilde presentation drawings. These were a new kind of drawing, completed works meant as presents, rather than sketches or studies. They, too, were greatly appreciated by Cavalieri, who was very sorry to lend some of them to members of the papal curia. Giorgio Vasari stood on their great originality. The meaning of the drawings is not fully understood, although it is common for scholars to relate them to moralizing themes or ideas about Neoplatonic love. Michelangelo (after), Rape of Ganymede, c. 1532 Michelangelo, Punishment of Tityus, c. 1532 Punishment of Tityus 1532 and Rape of Ganymede 1532 These two drawings both represent a muscular male attacked by an eagle. Tityus was the son of a human princess and the god Zeus. He attempted to rape a goddess and was killed by two of the gods, but his punishment did not end with death; for eternity he was chained to a rock in Hades while two vultures ate his liver, which was considered the seat of the passions.Howard Hibbard, Michelangelo, New York, 1974, 235. Zeus lusted after Ganymede, the most beautiful of all humans, and turned himself into an eagle to abduct (or rape) him to serve the god at Mount Olympus. The original drawing is lost and is known today only from copies. Michelangelo, Fall of Phaeton, c. 1533 The Fall of Phaeton 1533 Phaeton was the son of Apollo and nagged his father into letting him drive the chariot of the sun. He lost control of the fiery horses and Zeus had to destroy the chariot (and kill Phaeton) with a thunderbolt to keep it from destroying the earth. In Michelangelo's drawing Zeus is riding an eagle as he casts the thunderbolt that overturns the chariot. The women below are Phaeton's grieving sisters. Three versions of this drawing by Michelangelo survive; this is perhaps the final version that was given to Cavalieri by September 6, 1533, the date of a letter to the artist telling him the drawing had been much admired by illustrious visitors (including the Pope and Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici). On another version of the composition, today in the British Museum, Michelangelo wrote a note to Cavalieri: \\"Master Tommaso, if this sketch does not please you, tell Urbino so that I have time to do another by tomorrow evening, as I promised you. And if you like it and want me to finish it, send it back to me.\\"Anthony Hughes, Michelangelo, London, 1997, 233. Bacchanal of Children 1533 No written source for this drawing is known; presumably, it was an allegory that would have been familiar to Cavalieri. Frederick Hartt investigated the drawing and stated: \\" Until a specific text is found, there would seem to be little point in speculation, beyond noting that the drawing radiates the irresponsible wildness of certain of Michelangelo's poems. It is perfectly possible that he did not mean us to penetrate its riddles any further.\\" Michelangelo, The Dream, c. 1533 The Dream 1533 This drawing is not directly linked to Cavalieri, but its resemblance to those drawings has suggested to some scholars that it was related to them. Unlike some of the other drawings, the iconography does not derive from Greek mythology, and its uncertain subject is interpreted as linked with beauty.

He moved to Tucson, Arizona in the 1930s and he started a dude ranch, Rancho del Rio Estates, in 1945. Kratter's ranch went bankrupt in 1949 and he moved back to New York City, where he became one of the first to practice real estate syndication. In 1956, Kratter bought Ebbets Field from Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley. He leased Ebbets Field back to O'Malley until the team left for Los Angeles after the 1957 season. After purchasing the air rights to the Trans-Manhattan Expressway entrance to the George Washington Bridge on the Manhattan side, Kratter built the Bridge Apartments in 1961. The project consisted of four 32-story buildings built over the expressway and were some of the first aluminum-sheathed high-rise structures built in the world. In 1960, Kratter demolished Ebbets Field and in 1962, built the 1,327-apartment Ebbets Field Apartments under the Mitchell-Lama program which gave developers tax breaks and low-interest mortgages to build middle-class housing. Kratter also developed the St. Tropez, one of the first condominium apartment buildings in the city and owned the St. Regis Hotel and the Knickerbocker Brewery.

History  An entrance to the Police University College campus in left The institute was established in 1918 as a temporary police training school by the Helsinki Police Department. It operated as the Police Academy in various parts of the Greater Helsinki area, such as Espoo and the Suomenlinna fortress, until 1974 when the Academy's Police Course Centre was transferred to Tampere. In 1986, the Police Course Centre became an independent unit, the National Police School, and moved to its current campus in the Hervanta suburb of Tampere in 1993‚Äîwhile the Police Academy continued in Espoo and was renamed as the Police College of Finland in 1998. In 2008, the Police College of Finland and the National Police School were merged to become the sole police training institute in Finland and concentrated to the Hervanta campus. The institution continued under the name Police College of Finland until it was reorganized as a university of applied sciences and its name amended to Police University College in 2014.  Education  The Police University College is responsible for overall police training and student selection, for organizing degree and advanced studies, and for applied research and development in the police field. The institution is under the guidance of the National Police Board and ultimately the Interior Ministry. It provides a bachelor's and a master's degree in police services and specialized courses, such as driver's courses and an executive MBA in policing. Furthermore, the institution publishes targeted research on police matters, such as analysis on hate crime. All new police officers in Finland graduate from the institute and the bachelor's degree is considered a basic degree for law enforcement duties with training available in both Finnish and Swedish. In 2016, 132 police officers graduated from degree programmes and 6,100 people attended training outside the degree programmes offered by the University College. Likewise in 2016, the college received 4,318 applications for the bachelor's degree programme's intake of 300 students‚Äîan admittance rate of 7.0%.  Organization and campus  The University College employed 209 personnel, half of whom are teaching staff and 40% police officers, at the end of 2016. Doctor of Laws Marko Viitanen has been the director since October 2016. The organization of the academy is divided vertically into seven competency areas under the director as of 2017: * General Skills * Special Skills * Operational Skills * Police Dog Operations * Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) * Student Services * Administration The 21 hectare campus of the Police University College is located in the Hervanta suburb, eight kilometres from the centre of Tampere.

It starred Harry Hamlin, Linda Kozlowski, James Whitmore, Robert Loggia, John Mahoney, Ronny Cox, and Jason Alexander. The miniseries was adapted from the 1987 novel of the same written by Steve Sohmer, who also wrote the teleplay. Plot Favorite Son follows the apparent rise of Terrence \\"Terry\\" Fallon (Hamlin), a young and charismatic U.S. Senator from Texas. Fallon is idealistic and a vocal anti-Communist. One morning, during an outdoor press conference in Washington, D.C., Fallon is delivering a speech welcoming Col. Octavio Martinez, the leader of the Nicaraguan contras. A sniper from a nearby rooftop fires on them, instantly killing Martinez and wounding Fallon. The television and cable networks that are covering the press conference as routine news then begin broadcasting the unfolding events live. Fallon, who is bleeding from his side, manages to crawl to Martinez's dead body and then stagger to the podium. With tens of millions of people watching him live on television, Fallon delivers a passionate speech, condemning Martinez's murder and asking how Americans can turn their backs on people who are fighting for their freedom against oppression. Fallon soon collapses and is rushed to a hospital. Fallon's words and his courage stun the nation, and overnight, he becomes a household name and the hottest political property in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, about 10 days before his party's convention, President Sam Baker (Whitmore) is facing a difficult re-election campaign. His chief of staff, Lou Brenner (Mahoney), suggests that he can win by selecting the now- popular Fallon as his running mate and dropping the current Vice President Daniel Eastman (Mitchell Ryan) from the ticket. Baker is reluctant to pick Fallon, not knowing much about him and wondering if he qualified since he may occupy the Oval Office one day. For his part, Eastman refuses to go quietly, and his top aide, E. Ben Wycoff (Frederic Lehne), begins plotting to undermine Fallon by digging into his background. In both the novel and the miniseries, political parties are not named but referred to generically as the \\"party.\\" President Baker, Vice President Eastman, Senator Fallon, and Speaker of the House Charles MacDonald all belong to the same political party. Serving Fallon are Sally Crain (Kozlowski), his top press aide (and secret lover), and Chris Van Allen (Alexander), another top aide (and a homosexual). Crain, who is ruthlessly devoted to Fallon, first met him when he was running for a seat on the Houston City Council in the late 1970s. She carefully plots the young Senator's path to the vice presidency and then possibly the presidency. However, secrets from both Fallon's and Crain's pasts may derail their ambitions. President Baker also holds a meeting with Brenner, FBI director Henry O'Brien (Kenneth McMillan), and CIA director Admiral William Reiker (Ronny Cox) about the shooting. Based on eyewitness testimony, O'Brien identifies the sniper as Rolf Petersen (Brian Thompson), an ex-Marine and former CIA agent who went rogue. Brenner openly suggests that the disclosure that a former CIA agent assassinated Martinez might damage relations with the United States' Latin American allies. Without the president's knowledge, Brenner intimidates O'Brien into running a low-key investigation that just goes through the motions. O'Brien appoints only two agents, Nick Mancuso (Loggia), a cynical, bitter veteran who is close to retirement, and Dave Ross (Lance Guest), an idealistic but inexperienced young agent, to investigate the Martinez assassination. Ross is delighted with the assignment, but Mancuso explains that it's a setup because if the bureau was serious about finding the sniper, \\"they would have assigned a whole division\\" of FBI agents to the case and not just \\"a lameduck and a green kid.\\" Mancuso and Ross, however, pursue the case. Through a friend at the CIA, Mancuso learns about Petersen, who is still lurking in the area and thought to be plotting a second attempt on Fallon's life, and must track him down. Mancuso and Ross gradually uncover different conspiracies that may shake the U.S. government to its foundations.

It was one of the five original founding members of the Underground Press Syndicate.Peck, Abe. Uncovering the Sixties (New York: Pantheon Books, 1985). Started by Michigan State University student Michael Kindman as a radical, counterculture alternative to the official MSU campus newspaper, it was sympathetic to the politics of SDS. Initially tolerated by the MSU school administration, The Paper briefly received funding from a campus publications board before controversial content caused it to be banned from the MSU campus, but it continued to grow in popularity after the ban. In the summer of 1966, shortly after the founding of UPS, Kindman met Thorne Dreyer and Carol Neiman from the University of Texas at an SDS summer project in San Francisco‚Äîand told them about The Paper. Afterward, on their return to Austin, Texas they were inspired by Kindman's example to found their own pioneering radical college underground paper, The Rag, which was to play an important role in the development of the underground press around the country. In the Spring of 1966, MSU students James Friel and Stuart Jones, working from an idea by fellow student Steven Badrich, whom they had met at a fund-raising party at Kindman's house, created the comic strip Land Grant Man. Land Grant Man would appear on a nearly weekly basis for the next two years, and sporadically after that. Friel drew all installments of the strip. Jones was succeeded as writer by Jane Munn, and later by several others, including Friel. Land Grant Man, beginning in May 1966, was an early example of underground comics, although its style owed more to the \\"straight\\" Marvel comics of the period than to any counter-cultural influence. The Paper continued publishing on a regular basis for several years, generally circulating about 5000 copies. In late 1967 founder Michael Kindman left East Lansing for Boston, where he joined the Mel Lyman Family and briefly served as managing editor of Boston's leading underground paper, Avatar, before its demise.\\"My Odyssey Through the Underground Press\\" by Michael Kindman. Voices from the Underground: Insider Histories of the Vietnam Era Underground Press , ed. Ken Wachsberger (Tempe, AZ: Mica's Press, 1993), p. 369-479. The Paper continued to appear under that name until June 1969. It subsequently went through a number of title changes, including goob yeak gergibal and Generation East Lansing, before merging with another paper, the Bogue Street Bridge, to form Joint Issue, which lasted until May 20, 1974. The successor to Joint Issue was the Lansing Star, a local alternative paper which published at first weekly and later biweekly and monthly until 1983, when it was succeeded by Lansing Beat, which survived until at least November 1986.

The Council received a proposal from the Government of Haiti concerning the creation of a new police force and in modernising the Haitian armed forces. On 3 July 1993, the President of Haiti and the commander of the army of the country signed an agreement to return the country to peace and stability, and which addressed the issues of the police and military. In this respect, the Council supported the efforts to implement that agreement. Acting on a recommendation by the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Council authorised the establishment of UNMIH for an initial period of six months, subject to the proviso that it would be extended beyond the seventy-five days upon a review by the Council on whether progress had been made. The mission itself would consist of up to 567 police and 700 military observers, including 60 military instructors. The observers will accompany the Haitian police and train and observe their operations, while the soldiers were responsible for the modernisation of the army and following roles: :(a) providing non-combat training; :(b) the military construction unit would work with the Haitian military to implement projects from the Secretary- General's report such as military barracks and infrastructure. The intention of the Secretary-General to place the mission under the oversight of his Special Representative and the Organization of American States (OAS), which also oversaw the International Civilian Mission, was welcomed. Haiti was asked to provide security and freedom of movement to United Nations personnel, urging the conclusion of a Status of Mission agreement. At the same time, the groups in the country were called upon to renounce violence. The Secretary- General was requested to seek financing of the mission by way of a trust fund and contributions from Member States for the police and military components of UNMIH. Resolution 867 concluded by further asking him to report back by 10 December 1993 and 25 January 1994 on developments in Haiti.

Young and Amy Matthews. It tells the story of a prostitute (Chenoweth) who confesses to a Catholic priest (Sisto) that she plans to kill herself on her birthday. The priest attempts to find and save her, and in doing so plunges himself into a darker side of society. The film was partially inspired by Coyle's father, a kind but belligerent man who had considered becoming a priest in his early life. The script won the McKnight Screenwriting Fellowship from the IFP Minnesota Center for Media Arts. Into Temptation was filmed and set in Coyle's hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Several supporting roles were filled with actors from the Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul theater area, and Coyle himself performed in a supporting role. It was produced by Ten Ten Films and Farnam Street II, and distributed by First Look International. With a budget of less than $1million, filming began in May 2008. Cinematography was provided by David Doyle, Russell Holsapple composed the score, and Lee Percy worked as editor. The film touches on themes of temptation, sin, good and evil, redemption and celibacy, as well as the boundaries between a priest providing counsel and getting personally involved with helping parishioners. Into Temptation was optioned in Hollywood, but talks fell through due to complications from the global recession. The film did not receive a national release but played at theaters in several cities. Although first publicly shown for Coyle's father in December 2008, Into Temptation officially premiered on April 26, 2009, at the Newport Beach Film Festival, where Sisto won the \\"Outstanding Achievement in Acting\\" award. The film received generally positive reviews. It was released on DVD on October 27, 2009. Plot Father John Buerlein (Jeremy Sisto) is the mild-mannered Catholic priest of a small parish in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Overworked and underpaid, he has grown jaded with the profession and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (Kristin Chenoweth) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and he is unable to stop the woman before she disappears. He knows only that she wears a crucifix and is an Aries (her birthday is soon). Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping this woman, and begins visiting the city's red-light district with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a homeless man named Gus (Gene Larche), but with no money for him, he gives him a rosary instead. Later, he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O'Brien (Brian Baumgartner), who advises him not to become too personally involved.Patrick Coyle (Director). (2009). Into Temptation [Motion picture]. United States: First Look International. Kristin Chenoweth and director Patrick Coyle, who had a brief supporting role in the film. Father John returns to the red-light district and speaks to a prostitute named Miriam (Greta Oglesby), who suggests a powerful pimp named James St. Clair (Ansa Akyea) might know about the woman. As they speak in a bar, the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a john (Patrick Coyle), who leaves with her immediately. As she goes, Father John catches a glimpse of the crucifix she is wearing and tries to chase her down. She leaves in the john's car before he can catch them, but he writes down the license plate as they drive off. Back at church, his sermons start to grow more unorthodox, and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red- light district have the archbishop concerned. Meanwhile, Father John is contacted by his ex-girlfriend Nadine Brennan (Amy Matthews), who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John. Father John learns the john's car belongs to an accountant named Steven Miller, who tells Father John the prostitute is Linda, an expensive call girl who is widely considered among the best at her profession. Meanwhile, Linda visits her dying, elderly stepfather Donald Dupree (Tom Carey), who repeatedly raped Linda in her childhood and ultimately set her on the path to prostitution. Linda confronts him about their past, but claims she has forgiven him his sins, even though he continues to deny any wrongdoing. A drunk Nadine goes to talk to Father John in confession about her loneliness and feelings for him. He admits to caring for her as well, but they agree to remain friends. Later, Father John hires Lloyd Montag (Bruce A. Young), an unemployed boxer at his church, to serve as his bodyguard as he talks to St. Clair. The pimp, who knows Lloyd from his boxing days, tells Father John what neighborhood Linda lives in. There, Father John and Lloyd find Zeke (Tony Papenfuss), a taxi driver who knows they are looking for Linda and agrees to take them to her apartment. Zeke explains he had driven her to the church when she first spoke to Father John at confession, and Zeke later visited the church to watch Father John preach. At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda has moved out, but they discover she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping out at the church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he is too late to save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John. A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her. Production=Writing Into Temptation was filmed and set in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Into Temptation marks the second film by independent filmmaker Patrick Coyle, who wrote and directed the 2003 drama film Detective Fiction. Coyle said Into Temptation was partially inspired by his father, James Patrick Coyle, a kind but belligerent man who had been encouraged by his mother to become a priest. James entered seminary but dropped out before ordination after he was drafted into serving overseas in World War II and met Margaret Mary Quinlan, who would become his wife and Patrick Coyle's mother. Coyle conceived of the script for Into Temptation while imagining what kind of priest his father would have been. His father strongly approved of the project, and told Coyle, \\"Go make that movie. And tell the truth.\\" Coyle was also partially inspired by his childhood pastor and friend, the Reverend Damian Zuerlein, who performed the marriage ceremony for Coyle and his wife and baptized their children. Coyle said of him, \\"He's just a young, energetic, competent, committed, devoted man working with a poor parish. And he loves his work. I was inspired by that.\\" Coyle said when writing Into Temptation, he did not intend to make a religious film, and said of protagonist Father John Buerlein, \\"The character could have been a minister or a rabbi or a public defender. He's a good man trying to do a job the best he can.\\" Ann Luster, the film's producer, helped with the script from the earliest stages, and claimed she and Coyle had a deep understanding of how to handle the characters from the start. The film was set in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Coyle lived and worked as a writer and actor at the time. The fictional church in the story, St. Mary Magdalen's Downtown Catholic Church, is based in part on the St. Mary Magdalene church in Omaha, Nebraska, where Coyle was raised. However, the real-life church was also very different from the fictional church in that it lacked a shelter and drew very large congregations for weekend mass, compared to the half-empty pews in the fictional church. The fictional church is also based in part on Our Lady of Guadalupe, another Catholic church in south Omaha. The Into Temptation script won the McKnight Screenwriting Fellowship from IFP Minnesota Center for Media Arts, and investors were sought through public readings. After reading the script, Patrick Coyle's wife said, \\"If you get a good Father John, you'll have a good movie.\\" Casting Jeremy Sisto said he was drawn to the script, and was excited to take on a different project than his regular role of Detective Cyrus Lupo on the NBC crime drama series Law & Order. Sisto said of working on the show, \\"For nine months we basically do the same episode over and over. This [Into Tempation script] came out of nowhere.\\" Sisto said of working on Into Temptation: \\"Having just come off a job where there is little room to find true moments and to create a full character, I felt this respite from the task of trying to force a space where I could express something more personal through my job was no less than a creative life saver.\\" Brian Baumgartner, best known for his role as Kevin Malone in the NBC comedy The Office, portrayed Father Ralph O'Brien in the film. Coyle cold called Kristin Chenoweth's agent and proposed the part, which is different from her usual roles, and her agent said it was the exact part the actress was seeking. In order to film Into Temptation, Chenoweth took a five-day hiatus from her supporting role on the ABC television series Pushing Daisies. Brian Baumgartner, best known for his supporting role as Kevin Malone in the NBC comedy series The Office, was a regular theater performer in the Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul area before joining that show. While visiting New York City in May 2008 for an upfront presentation, shortly after having finished filming the fourth season of The Office, Baumgartner was offered the Into Temptation script by Coyle, who asked him to consider taking the role of Father Ralph O'Brien. Baumgartner said he enjoyed the script and agreed to the part. Writer and director Patrick Coyle plays Steven Miller, one of Linda's clients. Many of the other minor roles were filled by local Minneapolis actors and community members. Greta Oglesby, who played the street-smart prostitute Miriam, and Isabell Monk O'Connor, who played a librarian who helps Father John, were both veterans of the Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul theater circuit. Ansa Akyea, who played pimp James St. Clair, and Amy Matthews, who played Father John's ex- girlfriend, were also from the Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul area. Filming Actress Greta Oglesby appears on a set depicting the city's red-light district. Into Temptation was produced by Coyle's production company, Ten Ten Films, and the company Farnam Street II, in association with Cabin 14 Productions. It was distributed by First Look International. About a year before the film was released, Coyle asked Anne Marie Gillen to serve as executive producer. Gillen said she had not responded to a script in such an emotional way since the 1991 drama film Fried Green Tomatoes, which she also produced. Filming, which began in May 2008, took place entirely in Minneapolis. It included several scenes staged in the city's Uptown commercial district, where Coyle lived. In addition to his personal connections to the city, Coyle said filming took place in Minneapolis because it was relatively inexpensive to shoot there and hire local actors. He said, \\"Shooting in Uptown is a filmmaker's paradise. You've got everything here.\\" Into Tempation was produced and shot on a very low budget of less than $1million. Cinematography was provided by David Doyle, who made extensive use of the Red Digital Cinema Camera. The church scenes were filmed at the Incarnation Church in the city. Sisto and Chenoweth both attended mass services at the church as part of their research for the roles. Exterior car scenes were shot in the Uptown district. During one scene in particular, a police car with a siren passed by the actors during a shot. The actors continued uninterrupted, and the final shot was used in the film. Coyle approached Russell Holsapple, a Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul native and relatively inexperienced composer, to create the score for Into Temptation. Holsapple was given only a few weeks to create the score, which was composed mostly of piano music. Holsapple said Coyle gave him a great deal of artistic freedom and was largely receptive to the themes he wrote. James R. Bakkom worked as production designer on the film, and Deborah Fiscus served as costume designer. Both are natives of the Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul area. Vanessa Miles was set decorator, while Sarah Jean Kruchowski and Amy Hubbard both worked as art directors. Lee Percy served as editor of the film. He said the final cuts provided to him already contained the actors' strongest performances, but he placed a greater focus on Father John's character in an effort to \\"help the audience get inside him and connect emotionally\\". Percy was assisted by editor Scott Ferril. Patrick Coyle's father, Jim, followed production of the film closely, making weekly calls to inquire about it. When his father's health started to decline, Patrick Coyle \\"worked like hell\\" to finish the film quickly so his father could see it before he died. The film was finished in December 2008. Release=Distribution Into Temptation was optioned in Hollywood, but Coyle was displeased when industry officials wanted him to change the ending and make the sex scenes more risque. Due to complications from the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, the Hollywood discussions eventually collapsed. It did not receive a national release, but played at theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, Fargo, North Dakota, and several cities throughout Minnesota, including Minneapolis and Duluth. Coyle first publicly showed the film on December 26, 2008, at the Omaha hospice where his father Jim was staying for an audience of about 15 people. Jim Coyle, who died a few weeks after the screening, loved the film, describing it as very powerful and truthful. It officially premiered on April 26, 2009, at the Newport Beach Film Festival in Newport Beach, California. During its opening weekend at the Lagoon Cinema in Minneapolis, Into Temptation sold more tickets in three days than any other film during its debut weekend, and sold twice the tickets of such major studio films as Taking Woodstock and Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. This resulted in an extended run and strong word-of-mouth that led to exhibitions in other cities. The film earned a total of $97,457 in gross revenue in the United States. The Into Temptation DVD was released on October 27, 2009, with no bonus features. Critical response Into Temptation received generally positive reviews. Variety magazine writer Rob Nelson called it a well-photographed film of \\"occasionally irreverent wit\\", and that Coyle \\"strikes a near-perfect balance between humor and holiness\\". Nelson said the film \\"falters only in its hokey characterization\\" of the Chenoweth character. Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called it a \\"haunting, carefully crafted movie\\" with simple \\"matter-of-fact\\" direction, a \\"trim and efficient\\" screenplay, strong acting and solid characters. Covert said, \\"This is one of very few American films to deal with religious beliefs about faith and salvation with empathy and insight.\\" OC Weekly writer Matt Coker said Into Temptation had a cohesive script which \\"strikes just the right cord of reverence for the Catholic faith\\". He also praised the moments of comic relief with Sisto and Baumgartner, which he said complimented some of the film's heavier moments. L. Kent Wolgamott of the Lincoln Journal Star called Into Temptation a well-made film that \\"gets the mood right from start to finish\\". He complimented the performances and said although pornography and prostitution were familiar film topics, \\"the film's nuanced understanding of the priest and his conflicted role in trying to save Linda adds a new element to the old story.\\" Bob Fischbach of the Omaha World-Herald called the cinematography sharp, the editing crisp, and the acting \\"uniformly good\\". He added, \\"Best of all, the writing is anchored in reality. Coyle lets his film show rather than tell, and lets viewers reach their own conclusions.\\" Lavender magazine writer John Townsend said the film conveyed compassionate views of Christianity and complimented the cinematography. Townsend particularly praised Baumgartner's performance and described the scenes between Sisto and a young boy troubled by his homosexual feelings (John Skelley) as \\"exquisite\\". Chelsa Doyle, a writer with the website Blogcritics, called it \\"a touching and introspective film about faith, hope and choice\\". Doyle praised the film's quiet tone and the performances of Sisto and Chenoweth, but said it \\"occasionally gets a little sleepy in the middle\\", and that the subplot involving Father John's ex-girlfriend could have been cut altogether. Denver Post film critic Lisa Kennedy praised the performances of Sisto and Chenoweth, and complimented Coyle's understanding of the pastoral work of a parish priest. However, she added that the film \\"doesn't break ground as a story, even one about redemption\\". Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader called it a \\"cheesy melodrama\\", and wrote, \\"Writer-director Patrick Coyle tackles such weighty issues as child abuse, alcoholism, hypocrisy, celibacy, and Catholic reforms, but the movie's spiritual agenda is belied by its voyeurism.\\" Jeremy Sisto was awarded \\"Outstanding Achievement in Acting\\" from the 2009 Newport Beach Film Festival awards. Themes Throughout the film, Father John is warned that his role as a priest comes with boundaries, and that he should not become personally involved with the congregants or try to solve their problems except through counseling. However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on the lives of those in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life with meaning. He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her. The film takes a modern, liberal approach to the rules and constraints of Catholicism. Even before Father John decides to help Linda, he is questioning the constraints of his religion and calling. While speaking to a prospective mother struggling over whether to raise her daughter within the strict confines of Catholicism, Father John gives her advice beyond the official dogma and encourages her to be flexible, telling her she should \\"take what works\\" from the church teachings. Father John also has an unorthodox view of homosexuality compared to the normal views of the church. This is demonstrated in a scene in which the priest comforts a young man who is struggling with his homosexual feelings. In meeting and interacting with the pimps and prostitutes of the red-light district, Into Temptation blurs the lines between good and evil, and between right and wrong. The negative responses Father John encounters from congregants and the church regarding his trips to the red- light district demonstrate the way sex and poverty are often stigmatized in society. As the title suggests, one of the major themes of the film involves the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling. This is perhaps most strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the vow of celibacy required of Catholic priests. As Father John goes deeper into the red-light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis, he appears to face temptations from the prostitution and overt sexuality surrounding him. Additionally, it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction, as well as a desire to help her. This is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend, for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings. The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions when it comes to maintaining his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine. Into Temptation is also a story of redemption, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption for a life of sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.

The facility differs from traditional zoos and is more like a sanctuary in the way the animals are acquired and the care they receive. Though the facility allows visitors like a traditional zoo, the animals are not bred, sold, or traded. The Folsom City Zoo Sanctuary is supported by Friends of the Folsom Zoo, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which helps by providing both funding and volunteers. History The zoo took in its first animal in 1963, when the University of California at Davis Veterinary Department asked the Folsom Park superintendent to add an orphaned bear cub to the few animals he had been keeping around the park office. A cage was built for the bear, Smokey joined the other animals, and the Folsom Zoo was born. The name was changed to Folsom City Zoo Sanctuary in 2002 to better describe the zoo's goal of taking in animals that cannot be released back to the wild. The animals at the zoo belonged to private parties who either had them seized or relinquished them, wild animals that have injuries that would prevent them from being released back into the wild, and wild animals that have been captured due to their interactions with humans. Once in the zoo, the animals are generally not bred, sold, or traded; but are cared for until they die. Animals at the zoo Many, but not all, of the zoo residents are native to North America. Animals at the zoo include bears, tigers, mountain lions, bobcats, foxes, wolves, wolf hybrids, coyote, sheep, mule deer, macaques, squirrel monkeys, raccoons, skunks, eagles, parrots, and ravens. In 2004, the zoo took in two tigers from a Riverside County, CA facility called \\"Tiger Rescue\\", where more than 90 dead tigers were found, and other exotic animals were existing in illegal conditions. The owner of Tiger Rescue, John Weinhart, was convicted on 56 felonies of child and animal abuse.

When Katie leaves for Glasgow to train as a nurse, he is persuaded to find a wife on the mainland (which he has never visited). Withdrawing 400 pounds from a bank in Oban, he sets out to meet the local girls. He has been advised by the islanders of what they think he should look for in a potential wife: strong legs, wide hips, knowledge of cows and sheep, and also not a \\"candle burning Catholic\\" or a Campbell! His innocent close inspection of the girls he meets raises their suspicions. The first girl, inspired by a lurid paperback novel she is reading thinks he's a white slaver and so informs the local police. He then becomes a wanted fugitive after he 'borrows' a policeman's bicycle. Then he is mistaken for the leader of a gang of salmon poachers who use dynamite. The police eventually arrest the innocent Ewan on a wide variety of charges, but don't believe his story. Held overnight at the local police sergeant's home (there is no jail), he easily escapes custody and resumes his flight, still examining all the girls he meets. After two sisters that he takes refuge with come to blows over him, he 'borrows' their boat and hitches a passage with a fishing boat. The boat is taken over by fishermen from a nearby island who think they are encroaching on their fishing grounds, and Ewan is locked in a shed. He is rescued by a local girl and they row back to Ewan's home island. By now he's had enough of searching, and is starving, since he hasn't managed to have a square meal whilst on the run. He and Katie decide to marry anyway, despite the ban on consanguinity.

In cases involving animal abuse, he was appointed to defend the rights of the animal in question. He played a prominent role lobbying for the unsuccessful March 2010 Swiss referendum which would have provided legal representation to all animals involved in Swiss court cases. Career Goetschel serves as the animal advocate for the canton of Zurich. In 2007 he was appointed by the canton government to represent the interests of animals in animal cruelty cases. In this capacity, he attempts to insure that the Swiss animal protection laws, which are among the strictest in the world, are correctly enforced. Goetschel does not bring charges in this role, but rather focuses on explaining law, evaluating precedent, and appealing verdicts. He says that a third of his legal work is devoted to cases involving animals and the rest of his time is spent in private practice. His work has been praised by Peter Singer. In 2011, the office of Zurich animal advocate was abolished and the canton veterinary office took charge of animal cruelty cases. Goetschel plans to continue to advocate for animal rights causes by writing books on the subject. Notable cases Most of Goetschel's cases involve abuse of domestic pets, such as the case in which he secured a large fine against a woman who abandoned two kittens shortly after purchasing them. Goetschel has represented a variety of animals during his tenure as an animal lawyer, however. In February 2010, he argued on behalf of a pike that was caught by an angler. He made the case that the amount of time the angler had spent fighting the fish caused the fish to \\"suffer excessively.\\" Although the court ruled against him, he is currently appealing the judgment. He has also prosecuted on behalf of fish that were used in a game show episode in which contestants attempted to catch them by hand, arguing that the contestants did not treat the fish with the dignity they deserved. He ultimately lost the case on a technicality. Animal rights Goetschel became interested in animal rights at age 23 after an accident left him temporarily unable to speak. This experience caused him to reflect on animal suffering. He later became a vegetarian and became active in the animal rights movement. He has played a prominent role in lobbying for Swiss animal rights legislation. Although not officially a representative of the campaign, he devoted much of his time to lobbying on behalf of the March 2010 Swiss animal law referendum. Had it passed, it would have led to the Swiss government hiring other animal advocates in addition to Goetschel. He also lobbied on behalf of 2003 law which led to animals being treated as sentient beings, rather than property, in Swiss law.

Prior to his first murder conviction, Tobin served ten years in prison for a double rape committed in 1993, following which he was released in 2004. Three years after his release, he was sentenced to life with a minimum of 21 years for the rape and murder of Angelika Kluk in Glasgow in 2006. Skeletal remains of two teenagers who went missing in 1991 were subsequently found at his former home in Margate, Kent. Tobin was convicted of the murder of Vicky Hamilton in December 2008, resulting in his minimum sentence being increased to 30 years, and of the murder of Dinah McNicol in December 2009, resulting in a whole life order. Tobin has been labelled a psychopath by a senior psychologist and by criminology professor David Wilson, who also wrote a book on Tobin, connecting him with the Bible John murders in the late 1960s. Early and personal life Peter Tobin was born in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, one of eight siblings. He had four older sisters and three older brothers. Tobin was a difficult child and in 1953, aged seven, he was sent to an approved school. He reportedly joined the French Foreign Legion, but later deserted.Peter Tobin profile, \\"Murtair Bitheanta\\", BBC Alba, 21 April 2010. He later served time in a borstal, and in 1970 was convicted and imprisoned in England for burglary and forgery. Tobin moved to Brighton, Sussex, where he married his 17-year-old girlfriend, Margaret Louise Robertson Mountney, a clerk and typist, in August 1969. They separated after a year and she divorced him in 1971. In 1973, he married a local nurse, 30-year-old Sylvia Jefferies. The couple had a son and a daughter, the latter of whom died soon after birth. This second violent marriage lasted until 1976, when Sylvia left with their son. Tobin then had a relationship with Cathy Wilson; the couple married in 1987, with a son arriving later that year. In 1990, they moved to Bathgate, West Lothian. Wilson left Tobin in 1990 and moved back to Portsmouth, Hampshire, where she grew up. All three wives later gave similar accounts of falling for a charming, well-dressed psychopath who turned violent and displayed a sadistic streak during their marriages. In May 1991, Tobin moved to Margate, Kent and, in 1993, to Havant, Hampshire to be near his younger son. Convictions=Rape of juveniles On 4 August 1993, Tobin attacked two 14-year-old girls at his flat in Leigh Park, Havant, after they called to visit a neighbour, who was not at home. They called at Tobin's flat and asked if they could wait there. After holding them at knifepoint and forcing them to drink strong cider and vodka, Tobin sexually assaulted and raped the girls, stabbing one of them whilst his younger son was present. He then turned on the gas taps and left them for dead, but they both survived the attack. To avoid arrest, Tobin went into hiding and joined the Jesus Fellowship, a religious sect, in Coventry, under a false name. He was later captured in Brighton, after his blue Austin Metro car was found there. On 18 May 1994, at Winchester Crown Court, Tobin entered a plea of guilty and received a fourteen-year prison sentence. In 2004, Tobin, then 58 years old, was released from prison and returned to Paisley. Angelika Kluk murder In September 2006, Tobin was working as a church handyman at St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in Anderston, Glasgow. He had assumed the name of Pat McLaughlin to avoid detection, as he was still on the Violent and Sex Offender Register following his 1994 convictions for rape and assault. An arrest warrant had been issued for him in November 2005 after he moved from Paisley without notifying the police, but he was not discovered until he became a suspect in Kluk's murder at the church. In May 2007, he received a further 30-month sentence for breaching the terms of the register. Angelika Kluk, a 23-year-old student from Poland, was staying at the presbytery of St Patrick's Church, where she worked as a cleaner to help finance her Scandinavian Studies course at the University of Gda≈Ñsk. She was last seen alive in the company of Tobin on 24 September 2006, and is thought to have been attacked by him in the garage attached to the presbytery. She was beaten, raped and stabbed, and her body was concealed in an underground chamber beneath the floor near the confessional in the church. Forensic evidence suggested that she was still alive when she was placed under the floorboards. Police found her body on 29 September, and Tobin was arrested in London shortly afterwards. He had been admitted to hospital under a false name, and with a fictitious complaint. A six-week trial resulted from the evidence gathered under the supervision of Detective Superintendent David Swindle of Strathclyde Police and took place at the High Court of Justiciary, Edinburgh, between 23 March and 4 May 2007. The trial judge was Lord Menzies, the prosecution was led by Advocate Depute Dorothy Bain, and the defence by Donald Findlay QC. Despite his insistence that his sexual activity with Kluk was consensual and that he did not kill her, Tobin was found guilty of raping and murdering Kluk and was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 21 years. In sentencing Tobin, Judge Lord Menzies described him as \\"an evil man\\". Vicky Hamilton murder In June 2007, Tobin's old house in Bathgate was searched in connection with the disappearance of 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton, who was last seen on 10 February 1991 as she waited for a bus home to Redding, near Falkirk. Tobin is believed to have left Bathgate for Margate a few weeks after her disappearance. Tobin's house at 50 Irvine Drive, Margate. The bodies of Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol were found in the garden. On 21 July 2007, Lothian and Borders Police released a statement that they had \\"arrested, cautioned and charged a male in connection with the matter and a report has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal\\", but did not immediately confirm the identity of the man arrested. The investigation later led to a forensic search of a house in Southsea, Hampshire in early October 2007, where Tobin is believed to have lived shortly after leaving Bathgate. On 14 November 2007, Lothian and Borders Police confirmed that human remains found in the back garden of 50 Irvine Drive, a house in Margate occupied by Tobin in 1991, were those of Hamilton. In November 2008, Tobin was tried at the High Court in Dundee for Hamilton's murder. He was again defended by Donald Findlay, while the prosecution was led by the Solicitor General for Scotland, Frank Mulholland QC. The prosecution case went beyond the circumstantial evidence of Tobin having lived at the two houses in Bathgate and Margate in 1991, and consisted of eyewitness testimony of suspicious behaviour by Tobin at the Bathgate house, evidence to destroy his alibi, and forensic evidence of DNA and fingerprints left on a dagger found in the Bathgate house, on Hamilton's purse and on the sheeting in which her body was wrapped. After a month-long trial, Tobin was convicted of Hamilton's murder on 2 December 2008. When sentencing Tobin to life imprisonment, the judge said: > You stand convicted of the truly evil abduction and murder of a vulnerable > young girl in 1991 and thereafter of attempting to defeat the ends of > justice in various ways over an extended period... Yet again you have shown > yourself to be unfit to live in a decent society. It is hard for me to > convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for what > you have done... I fix the minimum period which you must spend in custody at > 30 years. Had it been open to me I would have made that period run > consecutive to the 21-year custodial period that you are already serving. On 11 December 2008, Tobin gave formal notice to court officials that he intended to challenge the verdict and overturn the sentence imposed on him. Tobin's defence team was not required to describe the grounds for this appeal until a later date in the appeals process. Tobin did not proceed with his appeal, and it was dropped in March 2009. Dinah McNicol murder Dinah McNicol, an 18-year-old sixth former from Tillingham, Essex, was last seen alive on 5 August 1991, hitchhiking home with a male companion from a music festival in Liphook, Hampshire. He was dropped off at Junction 8 of the M25, near Reigate, while McNicol stayed in the car with the driver. She was never seen again. After her disappearance, regular withdrawals were made from her building society account at cash machines in Hampshire and Sussex, out of character for McNicol, who had told friends and family that she intended to use the money in her building society account to travel or further her education. In late 2007, Essex Police reopened the investigation into McNicol's disappearance, following new leads. On 16 November 2007, a second body was found at 50 Irvine Drive in Margate, later confirmed by police to be that of McNicol. On 1 September 2008, the Crown Prosecution Service served a summons on Tobin's solicitors, formally accusing him of her murder, and this trial began in June 2009. The trial was postponed and the jury discharged in July 2009, the judge ruling that Tobin was not fit to stand trial pending surgery. The case resumed on 14 December 2009 at Chelmsford Crown Court. On 16 December, after the defence had offered no evidence, a jury found Tobin guilty of McNicol's murder after deliberating for less than fifteen minutes, and Tobin subsequently received his third life sentence. That same day, police reopened Operation Anagram to trace Tobin's past movements and his possible involvement in a further thirteen unsolved murders, including the three victims of the unidentified killer Bible John. Tobin is reported to have claimed 48 victims in boasts made in prison. Bible John connection Tobin's convictions have led to speculation that he is Bible John, a serial killer who murdered three young women in Glasgow in the 1960s. There are similarities between photographs of Tobin from that era and the photofit artist's impression of Bible John, and Tobin had moved from Glasgow in 1969, the same year as the killings officially ended. Another similarity is that eyewitnesses told police that the suspect had one tooth missing in his upper-right area of the mouth; dental records proved that Peter Tobin had a tooth removed around the late 1960s. Furthermore, it had been alleged that Tobin reacted violently to his victims' menstrual cycle, something which has long been suspected as the motive behind the Bible John murders. Police have not commented upon any similarities, but said that any surviving forensic evidence will be rechecked. Although DNA had been used to rule out a previous suspect, detectives believe a DNA link to Tobin is unlikely due to a deterioration of the samples through poor storage. Operation Anagram Operation Anagram is a British police investigation into Tobin's life and movements. The investigation was started in 2006, after his first murder conviction, by DSI Swindle of Strathclyde Police, and increased in intensity in December 2009 after Tobin's third conviction. Through the HOLMES 2 database, police forces across the UK are involved in the operation, investigating the possibility of Tobin's connection to dozens of murders and disappearances of teenage girls and young women.Operation Anagram ‚Äì Statement By Detective Superintendent David Swindle, strathclyde.police.uk; accessed 30 August 2017. DSI Swindle, speaking after Tobin's 2006 conviction for the murder of Kluk, said that Tobin's age and the method of the murder sparked speculation that he may be a serial killer, as did interviews with Tobin. Anagram led to the discovery of the bodies of Hamilton and McNicol. It is believed that , detectives across the UK were following up on up to 1,400 lines of inquiry. As part of their renewed enquiries, police are especially interested in tracing the owners of jewellery items found at his residences. In July 2010, it was reported that officers working on Operation Anagram had narrowed their review down to nine unsolved murders and disappearances. The operation was wound down in June 2011, having failed to identify any more victims, but its email address remains active. Health On 9 August 2012, Tobin was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary after suffering chest pains and a suspected heart attack at the city's Saughton Prison. In February 2016, Tobin was hospitalized again following a suspected stroke.

The majority of Guyanese live in New York City ‚Äì some 140,000 ‚Äì making them the fifth-largest foreign-born population in the city.  History  After the independence of Guyana from the United Kingdom, in 1966, Guyanese immigration to the United States increased dramatically. Political and economic uncertainty, and the internal strife two years earlier as well as a radical change in US immigration policy opening up opportunities to non-Europeans prompted many Guyanese who could make the move to seek opportunities abroad. An average of 6,080 people a year emigrated from Guyana between 1969 and 1976, increasing to an average of 14,400 between 1976 and 1981. Many of the first Guyanese immigrants to the United States were of African descent. They were women who were recruited as domestic workers or nursing assistants. Prior to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 Guyanese of Asian descent faced immigration restrictions because of existence of Asiatic Barred Zone. However, many Guyanese who had studied in the US in the mid 20th century or earlier stayed on in the US; although some like Cheddi Jagan returned to Guyana. Shirley Chisholm's father represents one of the earliest of Guyanese immigrants to the US during the 20th century; emigration from Guyana at that time was mostly to Caribbean or Commonwealth countries.Countries and Their Cultures-Guyanese American. Posted by Jacqueline A. McLeod. Retrieved June 10, 2011. Many Indo- Guyanese immigrants emigrated to New York City during the upheavals of the 1970s and 1980s, a group descended from the original Indian indentured servants that arrived to Guyana in the early 1800s after the abolishing of slavery by the British Empire.  Demographics  The New York City Metropolitan Area is home to the largest Guyanese population in the United States. The United States has the highest number of Guyanese people outside of Guyana. The Guyanese-American community mostly consists of people of Afro- Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese origins.Voices of new York. Posted by Brenda Mangru and Madhu Pillai. Retrieved June 25, 2011 As of 1990, 80 percent of Guyanese Americans lived in the Northeast, especially around New York City, which is home to over 140,000 people of Guyanese descent. In Queens, 82,000 Guyanese represent the second largest foreign-born population in the borough. Many Indo-Guyanese immigrants emigrated to New York City during the upheavals of the 1970s and 1980s and settled in South Richmond Hill. The 2000 census identified 24,662 people in Richmond Hill who were born in Guyana, the majority of whom were of Indian descent. The large concentration of Indo- Guyanese residents in Richmond Hill and the neighboring Ozone Park, has led the area along Liberty Avenue to be referred to as 'Little Guyana.' The majority of NYC's Afro-Guyanese population lives in Brooklyn's West Indian neighborhoods, most notably Flatbush and Canarsie. Other areas in the U.S. with significant Guyanese populations include the northern New Jersey cities of Irvington, South Plainfield, Orange and East Orange; and parts of southern and central Florida (Orlo Vista, Oakland, and Verona Walk). Smaller populations can also be found in Rockland County, New York; Schenectady, New York; Emerald Lakes, Pennsylvania; Olanta; Lincoln Park, Georgia; and Bladensburg, Maryland. Indo-Guyanese are mostly Hindu, but some are Christians or Muslims.  Business  The Guyanese have formed their own businesses in the United States, including many businesses along Little Guyana's Liberty Avenue that sell traditional Guyanese cuisine, jewelry, Bollywood videos and Sari clothing. Sybil's Bakery is the most well-known Guyanese culinary establishment in Richmond Hill; located right by the Richmond Hill Welcome sign. This area is also known to be under the control of Chad, acknowledged as The King of Liberty Avenue.  Politics  Guyanese have organized many of the U.S. Caribbean organizations. There are many associations of nurses and police from Guyana. Although the group has not made a collective impact on U.S. national policy, they have organized, through their churches, with other ethnic groups to promote knowledge about and find solutions for the problems in their neighborhoods and have entered local politics. Despite being the 5th largest immigrant group in NYC, there are no council members of Guyanese descent. Shirley Chisholm was the only Congresswoman of Guyanese descent in American history, as well as the first African-American woman elected to the United States Congress.  Associations  Some of the associations are the Guyana Cultural Association of New York, Indo-Caribbean Alliance, The Indo- Caribbean Federation of North America, and the Association of Guyanese- Americans. Around springtime, the Indo-Guyanese population in Richmond Hill, Queens traditionally hold a Phagwah Holi Festival & Celebration.  Relations with Guyana  The Guyanese-American community has close ties with Guyana and sends financial aid back to family members. There are large ongoing academic exchanges between Guyana and the United States. The Journal of the Caribbean is a Caribbean newspaper important to inform the Indo-Guyanese and other Caribbean groups of their achievements and inform them about the events in Guyana. This newspaper is published weekly and distributed throughout North America. The publications of these papers are written in English. However, there are also publications in other languages. Newspapers offer services to help people. In the newspaper there is tax air tickets and visa forms, applications and service support for the elderly, advertisements for charities for children in Guyana and India.

Biography During his high school years, Entov won multiple awards at the all-Union Physics Olympiads. In 1954 he graduated from a high school with a Gold Medal (valedictorian). He applied to the Physics Department of the Moscow State University, but was rejected on ideological grounds. The same year he began his study at the Mechanical Department of the Moscow Institute for Oil and Gas. In his second year, he approached Professor I.A. Charny and asked him for a research assignment. This was a beginning of their close personal and scientific friendship, which lasted until the death of Professor Charny. Upon his graduation from the Moscow Institute for Oil and Gas in 1959, Entov began a long-distance course of study at the mathematical department of the Moscow State University, while working in the Institute For Drilling Technology. In 1961 he began his graduate study with Professor I.A.Charny, and in 1965 he successfully defended his dissertation thesis ‚ÄúNon- stationary problems of the non-linear filtration‚Äù, earning the title of ‚ÄúCandidate of Science\\" (roughly equivalent to PhD). Beginning in 1971 and until his death, Entov worked at the Institute for Problems in Mechanics of the Soviet Academy of Science. In 1972 he was awarded the title of Doctor of Sciences for his dissertation thesis \\"Hydrodynamic theory of filtration of anomalous fluids\\", completed at the Institute for Problems in Mechanics. In his years at the Institute, Vladimir supervised the theses of 24 Candidates of Science and six Doctors of Science. He worked as a scientific supervisor at the Laboratory of Applied Continuum Mechanics until the last years of his life. In addition, since 1983 he served as a Professor of Applied Mathematics and Computer Modeling of the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas (now known as the Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas). Since 1993, Vladimir was actively involved in research and teaching activity in France (Institute de Physique du Globe de Paris), the UK (University of Cambridge and University of Oxford), and the USA (WPI, University of Stanford, MIT, UMN). Professor Entov was a Corresponding Member of The Russian Academy of the Natural Sciences, a member of the Russian National Committee for the Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, a member of the International Society for the Interaction of Mechanics and Mathematics, and a member of the editorial board of the European Journal of Applied Mathematics (Cambridge University Press).

In 1874, a new brick school was built in the Village. In 1956, a new elementary school across from the now Intermediate Elementary (now known as \\"the annex\\") was built. In 1955 the Ohio General Assembly eliminated the requirement that cities and school districts have common borders. From the 50s through the 70s the City of Columbus aggressively annexed land, causing concern for local school districts. In 1980 the suburban school districts together persuaded the Ohio General Assembly to place a two- year moratorium on all big-city school district transfers. Concerned legislators asked school officials to work out a solution to the growing \\"turf war\\" over the changing school district boundaries. In 1982, when little progress was made toward arriving at an agreeable solution, the General Assembly extended the moratorium for another two years, but stated they would not renew it again in 1986. Once again, the districts were directed to develop permanent boundary and annexation agreements. State Representative Michael Stinziano (Columbus) and other community and education leaders convened a series of negotiations with the Franklin County school district officials in 1986. These officials eventually reached an agreement, the ‚ÄúJoint Agreement Among and Between the Boards of Education of Certain School Districts in Franklin County, Ohio‚Äù, nicknamed ‚ÄúWin-Win‚Äù. The agreement established mechanisms to predict school district boundaries among the twelve member districts. It set procedures for Columbus to acquire new territory in the future, and established revenue sharing between Columbus City Schools and the suburban districts. The success of the agreement's adoption resulted in the Ohio General Assembly‚Äôs approval, and Governor Celeste‚Äôs signing of the agreement. The current brick schools were built in the late 1990s and 2000s. The Intermediate Elementary opened in 1999 and replaced two former elementary buildings, one of which was demolished and one used to be leased by the Columbus Jewish Day School. Now the Elementary school is slowly running out of teaching space therefore is slowly moving 2-4 5th grade classes every year into the annex. New Albany Middle School opened in August 2002. Prior to that, middle school classes were held in New Albany High School. The Primary(Referred to as K-1) Elementary opened in August 2003. Kindergarten and first grade were moved to that building and the Intermediate( Referred to as the 2-5 building) Elementary became for grades 2-5 only. The current New Albany High School was built in 1996. The school was expanded in 2002 to include an additional academic wing with offices, a new high school football stadium and additional locker rooms. Those improvements were completed in 2004.

Louvre Pandora's box is an artifact in Greek mythology connected with the myth of Pandora in Hesiod's Works and Days.Hesiod, Works and Days. 47ff. In modern times an idiom has grown from it meaning \\"Any source of great and unexpected troubles\\",Chambers Dictionary, 1998 or alternatively \\"A present which seems valuable but which in reality is a curse\\".Brewer's Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, 1992 Later depictions of the fatal container have been varied, while some literary and artistic treatments have focused more on the contents of the idiomatic box than on Pandora herself. The container mentioned in the original story was actually a large storage jar but the word was later mistranslated as \\"box\\". In mythology According to Hesiod, when Prometheus stole fire from heaven, Zeus, the king of the gods, took vengeance by presenting Pandora to Prometheus' brother Epimetheus. Pandora opened a jar left in her care containing sickness, death and many other unspecified evils which were then released into the world.Cf. Hesiod, Works and Days, (90). \\"For ere this the tribes of men lived on earth remote and free from ills and hard toil and heavy sicknesses which bring the Fates upon men ... Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. But the rest, countless plagues, wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils and the sea is full. Of themselves diseases come upon men continually by day and by night, bringing mischief to mortals silently; for wise Zeus took away speech from them.\\" Though she hastened to close the container, only one thing was left behind ‚Äì usually translated as Hope, though it could also have the pessimistic meaning of \\"deceptive expectation\\".Brill's Companion to Hesiod, Leiden NL 2009, p.77 From this story has grown the idiom \\"to open a Pandora's box\\", meaning to do or start something that will cause many unforeseen problems.Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English A modern, more colloquial equivalent is \\"to open a can of worms\\". pyxis, 440‚Äì430 BC. British Museumalt= Etymology of the \\"box\\" The word translated as \\"box\\" was actually a large jar (œÄŒØŒ∏ŒøœÇ pithos) in Greek.Schlegel and Weinfield, \\"Introduction to Hesiod\\" p. 6Meagher 2314, p. 148 Pithoi were used for storage of wine, oil, grain or other provisions, or, ritually, as a container for a human body for burying, from which it was believed souls escaped and necessarily returned.Cf. Harrison, Jane Ellen, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek history, Chapter II, \\"The Pithoigia\\", pp.42-43. Cf. also Figure 7 which shows an ancient Greek pot painting in the University of Jena where Hermes is presiding over a body in a pithos buried in the ground. \\"In the vase painting in fig.7 from a lekythos in the University Museum of Jena we see a Pithoigia of quite other and solemn booty. A large pithos is sunk deep into the ground. It has served as a grave. ... The vase-painting in fig. 7 must not be regarded as an actual conscious representation of the rupent rite performed on the first day of the Anthesteria. It is more general in content; it is in fact simply a representation of ideas familiar to every Greek, that the pithos was a grave-jar, that from such grave-jars souls escaped and to them necessarily returned, and that Hermes was Psychopompos, Evoker and Revoker of souls. The vase-painting is in fact only another form of the scene so often represented on Athenian white lekythoi, in which the souls flutter round the grave-stele. The grave-jar is but the earlier form of sepulture; the little winged figures, the Keres, are identical in both classes of vase-painting.\\" Many scholars see a close analogy between Pandora herself, who was made from clay, and the clay jar which dispenses evils.Cf. Jenifer Neils 2005, p.41 especially: \\"They ignore, however, Hesiod's description of Pandora's pithos as arrektoisi or unbreakable. This adjective, which is usually applied to objects of metal, such as gold fetters and hobbles in Homer (Il. 13.37, 15.20), would strongly imply that the jar is made of metal rather than earthenware, which is obviously capable of being broken.\\" The mistranslation of pithos is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist Erasmus who, in his Latin account of the story of Pandora, changed the Greek pithos to pyxis, meaning \\"box\\".Meagher 1995, p. 56. In his notes to Hesiod's Works and Days (p.168) M.L. West has surmised that Erasmus may have confused the story of Pandora with that found elsewhere of a box which was opened by Psyche. The context in which the story appeared was Erasmus' collection of proverbs, the Adagia (1508), in illustration of the Latin saying Malo accepto stultus sapit (from experiencing trouble a fool is made wise). In his version the box is opened by Epimetheus, whose name means 'Afterthought' ‚Äì or as Hesiod comments, \\"he whom mistakes made wise\\".William Watson Baker, The Adages of Erasmus, University of Toronto 2001, 1 i 31, p.32 Different versions of the container File:Pandora (Louvre, RF 2016-4).jpgNicol√≤ dell'Abate, 1555 File:\\"–ü–∞–Ω–¥–æ—Ä–∞\\" 1801–≥. —Ñ–æ—Ç–æ ‚Ññ2.jpgRussian fountain, 1801 File:Pandora opening her box by James Gillray.jpgJames Gillray cartoon, 1809 File:John Gibson-Pandora-Victoria and Albert Museum-2.jpgJohn Gibson statue, 1899 File:Pandora - John William Waterhouse.jpgJohn William Waterhouse, 1896 Contents There were alternative accounts of jars or urns containing blessings and evils bestowed upon humanity in Greek myth, of which a very early account is related in Homer's Iliad: > On the floor of Jove's palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil > gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder > mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; > but he to whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the > finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the > world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither > by gods nor men.Iliad, 24:527ff In a major departure from Hesiod, the 6th-century BC Greek elegiac poet Theognis of Megara states that > Hope is the only good god remaining among mankind; the others have left and > gone to Olympus. Trust, a mighty god has gone, Restraint has gone from men, > and the Graces, my friend, have abandoned the earth. Men's judicial oaths > are no longer to be trusted, nor does anyone revere the immortal gods; the > race of pious men has perished and men no longer recognize the rules of > conduct or acts of piety.Theognis, 1135ff. Giulio Bonasone‚Äôs 16th century engraving of Epimetheus opening the fatal jar The poem seems to hint at a myth in which the jar contained blessings rather than evils. It is confirmed in the new era by an Aesopic fable recorded by Babrius, in which the gods send the jar containing blessings to humans. Rather than a named female, it was a generic \\"foolish man\\" (·ºÄŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑ·Ω¥œÇ ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ) who opened the jar out of curiosity and let them escape. Once the lid was replaced, only hope remained, \\"promising that she will bestow on each of us the good things that have gone away.\\" This aetiological version is numbered 312 in the Perry Index.Aesopica In the Renaissance, the story of the jar was revisited by two immensely influential writers, Andrea Alciato in his Emblemata (1534) and the Neo-Latin poet Gabriele Faerno in his collection of a hundred fables (Fabulum Centum, 1563). Alciato only alluded to the story while depicting the goddess Hope seated on a jar in which, she declares, \\"I alone stayed behind at home when evils fluttered all around, as the revered muse of the old poet [Hesiod] has told you\\".In simulachrum spei Faerno‚Äôs short poem also addressed the origin of hope but in this case it is the remainder of the \\"universal blessings\\" (bona universa) that have escaped: \\"Of all good things that mortals lack,/Hope in the soul alone stays back.\\"Fabulum Centum, London 1743, Fable 94, p.216 An idea of the nature of the blessings lost is given in a Renaissance engraving by Giulio Bonasone, where the culprit is Pandora‚Äôs husband, Epimetheus. He is shown holding the lid of a large storage jar from which female representations of the Roman virtues are flying up into the air. They are identified by their names in Latin: security (salus), harmony (concordia), fairness (aequitas), mercy (clementia), freedom (libertas), happiness (felicitas), peace (pax), worth (virtus) and joy (laetitia). Hope (spes) is delayed on the lip and holds aloft the flower that is her attribute.Metropolitan Museum Difficulties of interpretation In Hesiodic scholarship, the interpretive crux has endured: Though Pandora was not a subject of medieval art, Dora Panofsky and Erwin Panofsky examined the post- Renaissance mythos, see Bibliography Is the hope imprisoned within a jar full of evils to be considered a benefit for humanity, or a further curse? A number of mythology textbooks echo the sentiments of M. L. West: \\"[Hope's retention in the jar] is comforting, and we are to be thankful for this antidote to our present ills.\\"West 1978, p. 169. Some scholars such as Mark Griffith, however, take the opposite view: \\"[Hope] seems to be a blessing withheld from men so that their life should be the more dreary and depressing.\\"Griffith 1983:250. One's interpretation hangs on two related questions: First, how are we to render elpis, the Greek word usually translated as \\"hope\\"? Second, does the jar preserve Elpis for men, or keep Elpis away from men? As with most ancient Greek words, elpis can be translated a number of ways. A number of scholars prefer the neutral translation of \\"expectation.\\" Classical authors use the word elpis to mean \\"expectation of bad,\\" as well as \\"expectation of good.\\" Statistical analysis demonstrates that the latter sense appears five times more than the former in all of extant ancient Greek literature.Leinieks 1984, 1‚Äì4. Others hold the minority view that elpis should be rendered, \\"expectation of evil\\" (vel sim).E.g., Verdenius 1985; Blumer 2001. How one answers the first question largely depends on the answer to the second question: should we interpret the jar to function as a prison, or a pantry?The prison/pantry terminology comes from Verdenius 1985 ad 96. The jar certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released ‚Äì they only affect humanity once outside the jar. Some have argued that logic dictates, therefore, that the jar acts as a prison for Elpis as well, withholding it from the human race.Scholars holding this view (e.g., Walcot 1961, 250) point out that the jar is termed an \\"unbreakable\\" (in Greek: arrektos) house. In Greek literature (e.g., Homer, and elsewhere in Hesiod), the word arrektos is applied to structures meant to sequester or otherwise restrain its contents. If one takes elpis to mean expectant hope, then the myth's tone is pessimistic: All the evils in the world were scattered from Pandora's jar, while the one potentially mitigating force, Hope, remains locked securely inside.See Griffith 1984 above. A less pessimistic interpretation understands the myth to say: countless evils fled Pandora's jar and plague human existence; the hope that we might be able to master these evils remains imprisoned inside the jar. Life is not hopeless, but each of us is hopelessly human.Thus Athanassakis 1983 in his commentary ad Works 96. It is also argued that hope was simply one of the evils in the jar, the false kind of hope, and was no good for humanity, since, later in the poem, Hesiod writes that hope is empty (498) and no good (500) and makes humanity lazy by taking away their industriousness, making them prone to evil.Cf. Jenifer Neils, in The Girl in the Pithos: Hesiod's Elpis, in \\"Periklean Athens and its Legacy. Problems and Perspectives\\", pp. 40‚Äì41 especially. In Human, All Too Human, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued that \\"Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment.\\"Nietzsche, Friedrich, Human, All Too Human. Cf. Section Two, On the History of Moral Feelings, aph. 71. \\"Hope. Pandora brought the jar with the evils and opened it. It was the gods' gift to man, on the outside a beautiful, enticing gift, called the 'lucky jar.' Then all the evils, those lively, winged beings, flew out of it. Since that time, they roam around and do harm to men by day and night. One single evil had not yet slipped out of the jar. As Zeus had wished, Pandora slammed the top down and it remained inside. So now man has the lucky jar in his house forever and thinks the world of the treasure. It is at his service; he reaches for it when he fancies it. For he does not know that the jar which Pandora brought was the jar of evils, and he takes the remaining evil for the greatest worldly good‚Äîit is hope, for Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment.\\" An objection to the hope is good/the jar is a prison interpretation counters that, if the jar is full of evils, then what is expectant hope ‚Äì a blessing ‚Äì doing among them? This objection leads some to render elpis as the expectation of evil, which would make the myth's tone somewhat optimistic: although mankind is troubled by all the evils in the world, at least we are spared the continual expectation of evil, which would make life unbearable. The optimistic reading of the myth is expressed by M. L. West. Elpis takes the more common meaning of expectant hope. And while the jar served as a prison for the evils that escaped, it thereafter serves as a residence for Hope. West explains, \\"It would be absurd to represent either the presence of ills by their confinement in a jar or the presence of hope by its escape from one.\\"West 1978, 169‚Äì70. Hope is thus preserved as a benefit for humans.Taking the jar to serve as a prison at some times and as a pantry at others will also accommodate another pessimistic interpretation of the myth. In this reading, attention is paid to the phrase moune Elpis ‚Äì \\"only Hope,\\" or \\"Hope alone.\\" A minority opinion construes the phrase instead to mean \\"empty Hope\\" or \\"baseless Hope\\": not only are humans plagued by a multitude of evils, but they persist in the fruitless hope that things might get better. Thus Beall 1989 227‚Äì28. Fixing the blame Neither Alciato nor Faerno had named who was responsible for opening the jar beyond saying it was a \\"mortal\\". During the Renaissance it is the name of Epimetheus that is mentioned as often as not, as in the engraving by Bonasone noticed above and the mention of Pandora's partner in a rondeau that Isaac de Benserade took it on himself to insert into his light-hearted version of the Metamorphoses (1676) - although Ovid had not in fact written about it himself. Pandora seated with her husband Epimetheus, who has just opened her jar of curses; an etching by S√©bastien Le Clerc (1676) > ::In a jar an odious treasure is ::Shut by the gods‚Äô wish: ::A gift that‚Äôs > not everyday, ::The owner‚Äôs Pandora alone; ::And her eyes, this in hand, > ::Command the best in the land ::As she flits near and far; ::Prettiness > can‚Äôt stay ::Shut in a jar. ::Someone took her eye, he took ::A look at what > pleased her so ::And out came the grief and woe ::We won‚Äòt ever be rid of, > ::For heaven had hidden ::That in the jar. The etching by S√©bastien Le Clerc that accompanied the poem in the book shows Pandora and Epimetheus seated on either side of a jar from which clouds of smoke emerge, carrying up the escaping evils. The lid of the jar is quite plainly in Epimetheus‚Äô hand.Panofsky 1956, p.79 Paolo Farinati, an earlier Venetian artist, was also responsible for a print which laid the blame on Epimetheus, depicting him as lifting the lid from the jar that Pandora is holding. Out of it boils a cloud which carries up a man and a dragon; between them they support a scroll reading \\"sero nimirum sapere caepit\\" (finding out too late), in reference to the meaning of Epimetheus' name in Greek .Wikimedia An Allegory of Les Sciences qui √âclairent l'esprit de l'homme (The Sciences that Illuminate the Human Spirit, 1557), an etching ascribed to Marco Angelo del Moro Another Venetian print, ascribed to Marco Angelo del Moro (active 1565 ‚Äì 1586), is much more enigmatic. Usually titled \\"Pandora's Box, or The Sciences that Illuminate the Human Spirit\\", it portrays a woman in antique dress opening an ornate coffer from which spill books, manuscripts, snakes and bats. By Pandora's side is a woman carrying a burning brand, while a horned figure flees in the opposite direction. Above is a curved vault painted with signs of the zodiac to which the sun-god Apollo is pointing, while opposite him another figure falls through the stars. Commentators ascribe different meanings to these symbols as contradictory as the contents of the chest. In one reading, the hand Pandora holds up to her face makes her the figure of Ignorance. Smith College Alternatively her eyes are protected because she is dazzled and the snakes crawling from the chest are ancient symbols of wisdom.Count Leopoldo Cicognara, Le premier si√®cle de la calcographie; ou, Catalogue raisonn√© des estampes, Venice 1837, pp.532-3 Apollo, seated above, points to Aquarius, the zodiacal sign of January/February, which marks the \\"Ascent of the Sun\\" from the trough of winter. The falling figure opposite him may be identified either as Lucifer or as night fleeing before the dawn; in either case, the darkness of ignorance is about to be dispelled. The question remains whether the box thus opened will in the end be recognised as a blessing; whether the ambiguous nature of knowledge is either to help or to hurt. In later centuries the emphasis in art has generally been on the person of Pandora. With few exceptions the box has appeared merely as her attribute. Ren√© Magritte's street scene of 1951, however, one of the few modern paintings to carry the title \\"Pandora's Box\\", is as enigmatic as were the Renaissance allegorical prints.Yale University Art Gallery Theatre In the first half of the 18th-century, three French plays were produced with the title \\"Pandora's Box\\" (La Bo√Æte ‚Äì or Bo√´te ‚Äì de Pandore). In each of these the main interest is in the social and human effects of the evils released from the box and in only one of them does Pandora figure as a character. The 1721 play by Alain Ren√© Lesage appeared as part of the longer La Fausse Foire.Oeuvres choisies de Lesage, Paris 1810, vol.4, pp.409 ‚Äì 450 It was a one-act prose drama of 24 scenes in the commedia dell'arte style. At its opening, Mercury has been sent in the guise of Harlequin to check whether the box given by Jupiter to the animated statue Pandora has been opened. He proceeds to stir up disruption in her formerly happy village, unleashing ambition, competition, greed, envy, jealousy, hatred, injustice, treachery and ill-health. Amid the social breakdown, Pierrot falls out with the bride he was about to marry at the start of the play and she becomes engaged instead to a social upstart. The play by Philippe Poisson (1682-1743) was a one-act verse comedy first produced in 1729. There Mercury visits the realm of Pluto to interview the ills shortly to be unleashed on mankind. The characters Old Age, Migraine, Destitution, Hatred, Envy, Paralysis, Quinsy, Fever and Transport (emotional instability) report their effects to him. They are preceded by Love, who argues that he deserves to figure among them as a bringer of social disruption.Th√©√¢tre Classique The later play of 1743 was written by Pierre Brumoy and subtitled \\"curiosity punished\\" (la curiosit√© punie). La Haye 1743 The three-act satirical verse comedy is set in the home of Epimetheus and the six children recently created by Prometheus. Mercury comes on a visit, bringing the fatal box with him. In it are the evils soon to subvert the innocence of the new creations. Firstly seven flatterers: the Genius of Honours, of Pleasures, Riches, Gaming (pack of cards in hand), Taste, Fashion (dressed as Harlequin) and False Knowledge. These are followed by seven bringers of evil: envy, remorse, avarice, poverty, scorn, ignorance and inconstancy. The corrupted children are rejected by Prometheus but Hope arrives at the end to bring a reconciliation. It is evident from these plays that, in France at least, blame had shifted from Pandora to the trickster god who contrives and enjoys mankind's subversion. Although physical ills are among the plagues that visit humanity, greater emphasis is given to the disruptive passions which destroy the possibility of harmonious living. Poetry Dante Gabriel Rossetti's painting of Pandora holding the box, 1871 Two poems in English dealing with Pandora's opening of the box are in the form of monologues, although Frank Sayers preferred the term monodrama for his recitation with lyrical interludes, written in 1790. In this Pandora is descending from Heaven after being endowed with gifts by the gods and therefore feels empowered to open the casket she carries, releasing strife, care, pride, hatred and despair. Only the voice of Hope is left to comfort her at the end.Poems, Norwich 1803, pp.213-19 In the poem by Samuel Phelps Leland (1839-1910), Pandora has already arrived in the household of Epimetheus and feels equally confident that she is privileged to satisfy her curiosity, but with a worse result. Shutting the lid too early, she thus \\"let loose all curses on mankind/ Without a hope to mitigate their pain\\".Poems, Chicago 1866, pp.24-5 This is the dilemma expressed in the sonnet that Dante Gabriel Rossetti wrote to accompany his oil painting of 1869‚Äì71. The gifts with which Pandora has been endowed and that made her desirable are ultimately subverted, \\"the good things turned to ill‚Ä¶Nor canst thou know/ If Hope still pent there be alive or dead.\\"Rossetti Archive In his painting Rossetti underlines the point as a fiery halo streams upward from the opening casket on which is inscribed the motto NESCITUR IGNESCITUR (unknown it burns). While the speakers of the verse monologues are characters hurt by their own simplicity, Rossetti's painting of the red-robed Pandora, with her expressive gaze and elongated hands about the jewelled casket, is a more ambiguous figure. So too is the girl in Lawrence Alma- Tadema's watercolour of Pandora (see above), as the comments of some of its interpreters indicate. Sideways against a seascape, red haired and naked, she gazes down at the urn lifted towards her \\"with a look of animal curiosity\\", according to one contemporary reviewer,The Pall Mall Budget 1882, vol. 27, p.14 or else \\"lost in contemplation of some treasure from the deep\\" according to another account.The Life and Work of L. Alma Tadema, Art Journal Office, 1888, p.22 A moulded sphinx on the unopened lid of the urn is turned in her direction. In the iconography of the time, such a figure is usually associated with the femme fatale,Lothar H√∂nnighausen, Pr√§raphaeliten und Fin de Si√®cle, Cambridge University 1988, pp.232-40 but in this case the crown of hyacinths about her head identifies Pandora as an innocent Greek maiden.Victoria Sherrow, Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History, Greenwood Publishing Group 2006, A Nevertheless, the presence of the sphinx at which she gazes with such curiosity suggests a personality on the cusp, on the verge of gaining some harmful knowledge that will henceforth negate her uncomplicated qualities. The name of Pandora already tells her future. NotesBibliography * Athanassakis, Apostolos, Hesiod: Theogony, Works and Days and The Shield of Heracles.

Commencing at a junction with Highway 539 in the community of River Valley, the highway extends northwesterly for to a point near where the Sturgeon River crosses the boundary between Nipissing and Sudbury District. At this point, the roadway turns northward and continues as Highway 805\\\\.  Route description  Highway 539A begins at a junction with its parent route, Highway 539\\\\. Drivers on Highway 539 must turn to remain on that route, while southbound Highway 539A becomes eastbound Highway 539 to Field. Northbound, drivers round a long curve and enter the community of River Valley. The highway crosses the railbed of a former rail spur, exits the community and crosses the Temagami River. The highway gradually curves to the northwest and hugs the bank of the Sturgeon River to the border between Nipissing District and Sudbury District, where it ends at Highway 805.  History  Hwy 539A near River Valley Although Highway 539 was designated in 1956, and the road that is now Highway 539A existed, the route was not designated at that time. The route first appears on the 1958 Official Road Map of Ontario as a short spur of Highway 539 into River Valley. In 1962, Highway 805 was designated within Sudbury District. In order to connect it with the rest of the provincial highway network, Highway 539A was extended northwest to the Nipissing ‚Äì Sudbury district boundary. It still follows this same routing today.

Its plot concerns an attempted insurance fraud that goes badly wrong. In the United States, it was released as She Played With Fire. The film is based on Winston Graham's novel Fortune Is a Woman (1953). Plot The film begins with a dream sequence: a metronome changes into a car windscreen wiper at night in heavy rain; a car drives up to a large Gotis mansion; the dreamer enters and walks there a painting of the same house hangs above the mantelpiece; the camera zooms into the door. The dreamer, Oliver Branwell, awakes with a start. Oliver is an insurance investigator with a London firm. He is sent north to Louis Manor to probe a recent fire. Mr Tracey Moreton lives there with his wife Sarah and his mother. Tracey introduces Branwell to them and to his neighbour and cousin, Clive, and shows him the fire damage. Some paintings are scorched and one is damaged beyond repair; this is said to have been a long distance landscape view of the house (like the picture in the dream). Moreton isn't aware that Sarah and Branwell were once romantically involved when they were each in Hong Kong. The insurance company pays out on the damage and the painting. Months later, on another case, Vere Litchen, the Singing Miner, has lost his voice and wishes to claim on this. He has a black eye given to him by his wife for having an affair with the woman in the bedroom. Vere has a painting that fits the description of the earlier destroyed painting. On a second visit, having confirmed what the view should look like, he returns and asks where Vere got the painting. The clues suggest that Sarah has sold the painting and made a false insurance claim. Branwell teaches himself how to spot a fake painting and sneaks into the manor to check whether the damaged painting is a copy; he finds Moreton's dead body. Soon after a deliberate fire starts in the basement. He cannot put it out. He phones the fire brigade giving his name as Tracey. The fire destroys the house and all remaining paintings (which he now knows are fake). The insurance pays ¬£30,000. Vere's rich fianc√©, Croft, is shown a photo of Sarah and denies she was the woman who sold the painting to him. A relieved Branwell proposes to Sarah and they leave on a honeymoon. Now the police begin to consider him a suspect. Blackmailed by a shadowy figure who knows of the insurance scam, Branwell and Sarah follow him and discover that Clive was the mastermind of the blackmail. Sarah disappears and says not to follow her, but as she says she is going to Louis Manor he easily follows her. Oliver finds Sarah with Tracey's mother, Mrs. Moreton, who explains that it was Tracey himself who arranged the insurance fraud and set the fires. He died when she confronted him and he accidentally fell to his death.

Vicar-General Mooney, pastor of the church in the 1890s, was a strong proponent of the parochial school system, as opposed to secular public schools. During a sermon at the dedication to the now closed and demolished St. Rose of Lima Parish School, he \\"urged his hearers to send their children to the parochial schools, where, he said, the religious instruction they would receive was far more important than the secular instruction they could receive in the public schools.\\"\\"Distinguished Prelates at St. Rose‚Äôs: Bishop Michaud Celebrates Mass-Archbishop Corrigan Blesses a School\\", The New York Times, Sep 10, 1894. ‚ÄúPontifical high mass was celebrated In the Church of St. Rose of Lima, In Cannon Street, yesterday, by the Right Rev.

He referred to the good that the parochial schools were doing in the city as well as throughout the State. Father Mooney urged his hearers to send their children to the parochial schools, where, he said, the religious instruction they would receive was far more important than the secular instruction they could receive in the public schools. ‚ÄúArchbishop Corrigan, assisted by Bishop Michaud and a number of priest, at 4 PM blessed the new school attached to the church, which will be opened in about a month.‚Äù Buildings It is one of the largest churches in Midtown Manhattan.

Pellicci lives in Melbourne with his wife, Anne and a son. Early life In 1960 Pellicci's family, his father Arthur, mother Jessie and older brother John, emigrated to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia as \\"Ten Pound Poms\\". In 1964, his older brother John took the then 11-year-old Pellicci to see The Beatles greet their \\"sea\\" of fans from the balcony of Melbourne's Southern Cross Hotel. Pellicci said he was spellbound by the experience and it moulded his career path. Shortly after, John bought him a Trixon drum kit which had been traded in at a local car dealer. With his passion for music now fully determined, Pellicci's school attendance took second billing to his beloved drum practice (which entailed playing along with every pop record he could get his hands on!) After the family moved to King Island, Tasmania in 1966, Pellicci attended the local high school while John and Arthur took jobs at the King Island Scheelite mine. This rural culture shock was magnified by the fact that Pellicci was passionate about music but had to wait up to a month for the latest pop 45s to be freighted over from mainland Victoria. Early career In 1968 Pellicci returned to Melbourne to pursue his music career in earnest, first with the semi-pro band Recital, then his first professional group Plum. The break-up of Plum led to stints with various groups: Ash (initially under the name Derek Allen), Arthur & The Argonauts, Island, Blackfeather and New Zealand Highway. Mississippi In 1972 Pellicci joined a new band, Mississippi (featuring future Little River Band members, Graeham Goble and Beeb Birtles). Mississippi not only served to develop his studio skills, but also was an orientation into the gruelling road tours that lay ahead. This led to more studio experience, both in recordings with Mississippi and session work in radio jingles and recordings with other artists. In 1974 Mississippi sailed for England (coincidentally on the same ship that had brought Pellicci to Australia, the Fairsky). Whilst in the UK, Pellicci was stunned to learn he had been adopted as a baby. In 2003, he learnt that his birth mother, Gladys Sylvia Hadley had died in Jerusalem on 29 May 1990. Pellicci never met either of his biological parents. Little River Band In 1975 Mississippi returned to Australia and commenced rehearsals with new lead singer Glenn Shorrock, subsequently changing their name to Little River Band. Three years later, in 1978, two significant events occurred in Pellicci's life. In May he suffered a serious burns accident which hospitalised him for two months. In December of that year, he married his longtime girlfriend, Anne Deacon. Pellicci played drums on John Farnham's adult contemporary album Uncovered with guitarists Tommy Emmanuel, David Briggs, Barry Sullivan, Mal Logan and Peter Jones in 1980. In April 1981, Pellicci and the other band members flew out to the Caribbean island of Montserrat to record the album Time Exposure with legendary Beatles producer George Martin. After the departure of Beeb Birtles from Little River Band, in 1984, Pellicci also quit the band and he and his wife Anne moved to Los Angeles to focus on his songwriting. Cold Chisel's Stephen Prestwich replaced Pellicci. Pellicci played on all 13 of Little River Band's Top 40 US hits. Pellicci and Anne moved back to Australia for the birth of their son Joel in 1985. Over the next few years Pellicci worked on projects with well-known artists including Colin Hay, Daryl Braithwaite, Stevie Wright, Shirley Strachan, Ross Wilson, Marc Hunter, Stephen Cummings, Joe Camilleri, Renee Geyer, Eddie Rayner and Goanna, amongst others. He also composed lyrics for Japanese pop star, Y≈çsui Inoue's 'English language' album. In 1988 Pellicci reunited with Little River Band (Birtles, David Briggs and George McArdle did not participate) for a triumphant show at the opening of the Brisbane World Expo 88 with a special guest, Eagles member Glenn Frey. Little River Band performed with Warren Zevon and Christopher Cross as special guest members and continued to tour internationally for at least three months every year after the Brisbane Expo. At this time he co-wrote three songs for Little River Band's album Monsoon, and in a joint acknowledgement of their emigration experience, co-wrote \\"I Dream Alone\\" with Glenn Shorrock for the Get Lucky album. After the completion of a successful US tour in 1997, Pellicci played his last show with Little River Band in Biloxi, Mississippi and subsequently retired from the music business. The classic line-up of Goble, Birtles, Pellicci, Shorrock, Briggs and McArdle reunited for a live performance of \\"Help Is on Its Way\\" at Little River Band's induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2004.

The first season was presented by cantopop singer Prudence Liew and aired from July 19, 2009 to February 7, 2010. Wen Wang was the winner. Sammy Leung and Kristal Tin were the main presenters starting season two, which aired May 9, 2010 to September 12, 2010. Mag Lam was the winner. Season 3 premiered on August 14, 2011 following the conclusion of the talk show, Say What (ÂêπÊ∞¥ÂêåÈÑâÊúÉ). Format Contestants sing one song per round of competition, which depending on the length, will be broadcast within one or two episodes. After their individual performances, a panel of judges (between four and six, depending on the round) will critique and score each contestant. During the first half of the season, the scoring structure is on a five-point scale, with the final score being the sum of the judges total. As for the latter half of the season, each judge can award up to 100 points, with the final score being the average of the judges' scores. Depending on the round of competition, contestants are eliminated based on one of three pre-set criteria: * Having a set number of the lowest scoring contestants (usually between two and four) eliminated; * Having a minimum score threshold where a contestant must achieve in order to survive the round; * In dual rounds, contestants that score lower than their challengers are eliminated. If two contestants are battling against each other, the lower scoring contestant is eliminated. However, there are some rounds where no contestants are eliminated and instead they are competing for prizes. Season 1 (2009-2010) An open audition call selects 100 contestants to enter the preliminaries of the show, which is broadcast in the first episode of the program. From there, the six judges responsible for the preliminaries each select five contestants as the final 30 to be on the show. At the halfway point of the season, contestants eliminated during the first half had an opportunity to re-join the competition in what is called \\"The Resurrection Battle\\". During this round, the four highest scoring contestants are re-instated in the competition.

During episodes 16 to 20 of season one, several singing competition winners from Mainland China and Taiwan challenged the original Hong Kong contestants in a dual round. Each challenger battled against two local contestants. If the challenger can win both rounds or at least win one round and tie one round, they were then invited to compete in The Voice for the remainder of the season. Two of these challengers ended up in the top three at the end of season one, with Wen Wang ÁéãÈõØ winning the competition and Wen Chao Ë∂ôÊñá in third place. Season 2 (2010) The show went through a makeover for season 2. The major difference being the open audition call now selects twenty contestants, cancelling the preliminary round of 100 competitors. The season premiere began with these twenty contestants. Also, no Resurrection Battle took place this season.

Club career=Juventus Giandonato began his youth career with Juventus in 2004, and was promoted to the Primavera (Under 20) squad in 2009. After 7 years in the club's youth system, Giandonato began to earn senior call-ups during the 2009‚Äì10 Serie A season, and made his first Serie A appearance on 6 February 2010, coming on as an 83rd-minute substitute for club captain and icon, Alessandro Del Piero in a league match against Livorno. After making his first team debut, Giandonato helped the Primavera squad win their second consecutive Viareggio title in 2010. He made his first start for Juventus on 19 December 2010 against Chievo Verona, though he was sent off in the 52nd minute of the match for a professional foul. Giandonato scored a stunning free kick against Manchester United in Gary Neville's testimonial match. On 30 August 2011, Giandonato joined U.S. Lecce on a season-long loan deal along with teammate Cristian Pasquato, in order to gain regular first-team experience. He made his debut with Lecce on 11 September 2011, starting in the 0‚Äì2 home loss against Udinese. On 30 June 2012, Giandonato returned to Juventus after making just 8 first team appearances for the Stadio Via del Mare outfit. After taking part in much of Juventus' 2012‚Äì13 Serie A pre-season, Giandonato was loaned out to Serie B side, Vicenza Calcio on 27 August 2012 on another season-long loan operation. The loan deal, however, was cut short on 30 January 2013, when Juventus recalled the player in order to loan him out to fellow Serie B side, A.C. Cesena. Between the two clubs, Giandonato was a first team regular for much of the campaign, making 26 league appearances and scoring 1 goal. Giandonato returned to Juventus on 30 June 2013, only to be released less than three months later. Piacenza On 16 July 2019, he signed with Piacenza. Olbia On 10 January 2020 he joined Olbia on loan. On 6 August 2020 he moved to Olbia on a permanent basis. International career Giandonato has represented Italy at the international level since 2006, when he began to earn call-ups for the U-16 squad. He has also been capped for the U-17, U-18, U-19 and U-20 teams. On 17 November 2010 he made his debut for the Italy U-21 team in a friendly game against Turkey. He has also been a member of the Italy under-21 Serie B representative team on 2 occasions, scoring a goal.

Criminal Law, Second Edition. Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2004, p. 541 This differed from previous federal common law established in Davis v. United States (1895), in which the court held that if the defense raised an insanity defense, the prosecution must prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt, but Davis was not a United States constitutional ruling, so only limited federal cases, but not state cases.Criminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , Oregon had a very high burden on defense, that insanity be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. At that time, twenty other states also placed the burden of persuasion on the defense for an insanity defense. The defendant was convicted of killing a fifteen-year-old girl in Multnomah County. After being arrested for auto theft, the defendant asked for a homicide officer, verbally confessed to the murder, took the police to the scene of the crime, and signed a written confession. After being indicted, he then spoke to a lawyer for the first time. At trial, a jury convicted him and recommended the death penalty. Oregon law required the defendant required proof of insanity beyond a reasonable doubt. The case claimed that the \\"statute in effect requires a defendant pleading insanity to establish his innocence by disproving beyond a reasonable doubt elements of the crime necessary to a verdict of guilty, and that the statute is therefore violative of that due process of law secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.\\"  References External links * Category:United States criminal burden of proof case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:1952 in United States case law Category:Capital punishment in Oregon Category:Multnomah County, Oregon Category:Insanity Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Vinson Court ","title":"Leland v.

Norwood Gardens was planned and developed during a period of expansion in New York City. With the opening of the Queensboro Bridge in 1909 and the extension of the New York City Subway to Astoria‚ÄìDitmars Boulevard in 1915, Astoria and Long Island City were forever changed from outlying suburbs to centrally connected communities. The Queens Chamber of Commerce published sales brochures advertising Norwood Gardens as ‚ÄúCountry Living In The City‚Äù. The houses were developed by Rickert Brown and designed to offer middle-income families a better quality of life than that typically found in a large, metropolitan city in the early part of the century. Norwood Gardens includes many two-family detached homes, a unique block of one-family attached homes east side of 37th Street and thirty unique attached terrace homes on 36th Street. The 36th Street homes were popularly called Doctor‚Äôs Row due to doctors combining their practice offices under their living quarters. The 36th Street terrace homes were designed by Walter Hopkins, an architect with Warren & Wetmore, which designed other structures such as Grand Central Terminal. The thirty attached terrace homes showcased 25-foot front gardens planted with California privet hedges, over 22 kinds of evergreens (many 10‚Äì12 feet tall) and a large variety of flowering shrubs. Norwood Gardens‚Äô homes were designed to provide circulating fresh air and sunlight. The interior floor plans maximized use of space, making the homes attractive to families. The exterior design is a lively combination of white stucco and red tapestry brick. The mortar is a mix of bright white lime with a quartz aggregate that sparkles and accentuates the brick. Additional architectural elements include iron balconies, lattice work, green blinds, cement flower pots on the roof, red Italianate tiles, planter supports in the shape of lambs heads and a variety of architectural medallions embedded in the brick. The original bathroom fixtures were manufactured by J. L. Mott Iron Works of Manhattan; the company's namesake also gave rise to the name of Mott Street in Chinatown, Manhattan. In 1929, Norwood Gardens terrace homes sold for $15,000 and the slightly larger corner homes for $16,000. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company underwrote the mortgages for the terrace homes. Twenty- nine exteriors of the thirty terrace homes remain in near original state.  References  * * Rickert-Brown Co.

The Convenor of the Alliance was Fung Wai- wah. It provided a single point of contact to interface with the governments of Hong Kong and China, especially to press for more democratic formulas for the Chief Executive election in 2017 and the Legco election in 2020. The grouping is seen as more 'moderate' than the League of Social Democrats and the Civic Party, which have triggered Legco by-elections in May 2010, by having five of their members resign and stand for reelection in a 'de facto referendum' on democratic progress in Hong Kong.Wong, Albert (26 April 2010). \\"Pan-democrat alliance indicates it will reject political reform package\\", South China Morning Post In June 2010, the central government accepted the reformed proposal suggested by the Democratic Party after negotiating with the Democratic Party and the alliance. The compromise made with Beijing was fiercely attacked by the radical faction of the pro-democracy camp, the League of Social Democrats. In 2013, the Convenor Fung Wai-wah announced the alliance \\"will be indefinitely suspended\\" in order to form a new body with other pan- democrats on the matter of full universal suffrage. In March, the new alliance the Alliance for True Democracy was launched. Stances In March 2010 the Alliance outlined its proposals for electoral reform in Hong Kong. For 2012 it suggests expanding the number of seats in Legco by a third, to 80. Half would still be returned by functional constituencies - trade-based seats with small electorates. This is not so different from the Hong Kong government proposal to increase the number of seats to 70, also with half of them for functional constituencies. For the 2017 election, the Alliance proposes a nominating committee of 1,200 people that can put forward candidates for chief executive, with any candidates who obtain 100 nominations eligible to run for election. It wants Legco to have 100 seats by 2020, with half chosen by proportional representation by all the city's voters. Other specific requests made to Beijing include: * That a candidate for chief executive in 2012 would not need more nominations than in at the 2008 election; * That Legco's functional constituencies would be scrapped by 2020; and * That elections in 2012 and 2016 would be increasingly democratic.

Cytomegalovirus infection of a lung pneumocyte, showing owl's eye appearance of a large cell at center. Cytomegalovirus neuronal inclusions showing the Owl's Eye Sign Owl's eye appearance, also known as Owl‚Äôs Eye Sign, is commonly used as a term to describe a pattern that is found in the study of histology, radiology, and pathology cases. This pattern has a resemblance of a real Owl‚Äôs Eyes Shape. Such an appearance of a pattern has been used for the analysis of symptoms on patients within the medical field. They may refer to: *Cells with perinuclear vacuolization around centrally located pyknotic nuclei, such as typically seen in flat warts. Last Update: May 13, 2019. *Owl's eye appearance of inclusion bodies, which is highly specific for cytomegalovirus infection. *Owl's eye appearance of entire nucleus - a finding in Reed‚ÄìSternberg cells in individuals with Hodgkin's lymphoma. *Owl's eye appearance of the Lentiform nucleus of the basal ganglia on head CT scan images in individuals with cerebral hypoxiahttp://radiographics.rsna.org/content/28/2/417.full __TOC__ Pathological Cases The Owl‚Äôs Eye Appearance has a relationship with Reed- Sternberg cells, in regards to cytomegalovirus infection. Owl‚Äôs Eye Appearance was used as an indication of the presence of the cytomegalovirus for the following case studies. In 1982, a textbook wrote a chapter on cytomegalovirus and elaborate on its further relevance towards owl‚Äôs eye appearances. It was stated that the Owl‚Äôs Eye had a characteristic of a clear halo that extended towards the cell membrane‚Äôs nucleus. The cellular structure was found to be of relevance towards pneumonia which was of fault to the cytomegalovirus. In a 1986 case study, a journal wrote that owl‚Äôs eye appearance was found in a total of 10 out of 10 patients. This was apparently due to the cytomegalovirus found in the patients that were also found to be diagnosed with aids. This case study involved CT scans that were used as a proposal as a way to detect the cytomegalovirus, however the case study found that the cytomegalovirus had little relevance to the ability of CT scans. In 1987, a thirty-three-year-old man diagnosed with aids was discovered with the cytomegalovirus in his eyes. The presence of an owl‚Äôs eye appearance gave an indication towards the hospital that this patient was infected with the cytomegalovirus. In 1990, case study journal found that owl‚Äôs eye appearance was in correlation with the appearance of a HIV infection. This was where the case study involved the study of hospital cases and concluding that the HIV plays a role in certain symptoms such as diarrhea. In 1990, a case study journal found that owl‚Äôs eye appearances were found within the four patients that were observed. These patients were diagnosed with aids, and with the presence of owl‚Äôs eye appearances it proved that there was the presence of the cytomegalovirus. The confirmation of this virus was by the use of immunohistochemistry. In a 2000 case study, it was discovered that the owl‚Äôs eye appearance as a cell body was a key for histopathological understanding of the cytomegalovirus. The study found a strong relationship with a positive CMV PCR (p < 0.001). The discovery led to a result that owl‚Äôs eye appearances were a strong sign for finding cytomegalovirus inside organs. In 2006, a case study journal wrote that owl‚Äôs eye signs were found in patients who had a compromised immune system. The purpose of this case study was to identify the features of the cytomegalovirus itself, and the appearance of owl‚Äôs eyes in relevance. In 2009, a case study journal found a 44 year old male patient to be infected with the cytomegalovirus. The presence of an eye‚Äôs owl appearance found within the infected area, gave the necessary clues to a confirmed cytomegalovirus infection. In 2009, another case study found the appearance of an owl‚Äôs eye in eighteen patients who were induced with drugs with a syndrome. The case study concluded that the cytomegalovirus disease was present as the syndrome caused these patients to compromise their immune system. The case also found that the large decrease of white blood cells was a factor in the preliminary stage of infection of the cytomegalovirus. In 2011, a second edition textbook found that an owl‚Äôs eye appearance was found inside a dead retina. It was found due to the cause of the cytomegalovirus that had been residing inside an eye causing it to transition from healthy to dead. In 2012, a journal was written on patients with the cytomegalovirus infection and were used in mapping out the owl‚Äôs eye cells using their microscopic technology. The patients were two elderly men at ages 75 and 77 years old. The imaging of the owl‚Äôs eye appearance was created using the microscope via lasers, and two dimensional images were created using computer software. The conclusion by the journal was that the owl‚Äôs eye had of relevance towards cytomegalovirus infection. In 2019, a 4 year old boy was found with acute flaccid paralysis and was found to have an owl‚Äôs eye appearance. The case also spoke on the presence of enterovirus. The boy was also found to have a compromised immune system, which the enterovirus came through in infection. This case is unique due to the owl‚Äôs eye appearance in relevance towards the enterovirus. Histological Cases Owl‚Äôs Eye Appearances were also found within tissues and organs and are tied with histopathological cases. Most of these cases are also in relevance to the pathology cases, however these cases were more focused on the specifics of a singular organ or tissue where the owl‚Äôs eye appearance showed up. These cases are also found to have a moderate relevance towards the cytomegalovirus. In 1983, a journal wrote on a case study that found owl‚Äôs eye appearance within the human eyes with the presence of a potential cytomegalovirus with a deficient immune system. This was from the symptoms of inflammation that gave the diagnostic of an immune system to be deficient. In 1985, a journal wrote that the appearance of owl‚Äôs eye signs was due to the presence of an inflammatory bowel disease. This was a finding that had a suspect that the patient for this case was infected with the cytomegalovirus infection, however further investigations showed that the patient indeed was leading to a weak immune system. The patient was also identified as an 80-year-old man who has had a short-term case of diarrhea of blood and mucus, which was not contained which resulted in his death. The autopsy found the presence of cytomegalovirus this way. In 2002, a rare case study journal wrote that a range of cytomegalovirus can infect in patients diagnosed with aids and compromised immune systems, however it was rare to involve the skin of the patient. The skin at cellular level was found to have owl‚Äôs eye appearance and was concluded after several tests to be the cytomegalovirus infection. In 2007, a journal wrote on the presence of owl‚Äôs eye appearance as cells found in a transplant to the patient. The owl‚Äôs eye appearance was considered rare for cytomegalovirus infection in the transplant, but was considered concerning. The cytomegalovirus infection was found of relevance towards compromised immune patients, as previous cases shows that immune problems for patients have a similar case of cytomegalovirus infection. In 2015, a review journal wrote on Herpes infection and made a finding that owl‚Äôs eye appearance was found in most of the organs through the investigation of a liver transplant. This provides evidence that the appearance of an owl‚Äôs eye allowed the doctors to diagnose that the infection of the cytomegalovirus from the liver transplant can be detected through detection tools. In 2019, a case study was conducted on a series of patients that was infected with the Cytomegalovirus, and found the presence of owl‚Äôs eye appearance due to the presence of the virus. These owl‚Äôs eye appearances were able to conclude that high risk patients had a higher risk of cytomegalovirus. Special Cases In a special case in 2011, the owl's eye appearance was found within the cellular structure of the Spinal Ganglia. Another special case in 1957, found that owl‚Äôs eye appearance was found by two cells mirroring with each other producing the pattern inside the histological case study of tumors. This is essentially what an owl‚Äôs eye appearance is, however the symptom did not occur from the presence of a cytomegalovirus, but from a unique case. Another special case in 1999, a case study was conducted by investigation a series of babies and found a baby with the presence of owl‚Äôs sign which was also found to be known as an eye mask. This had to do with the presence of a rash, not the presence of a cytomegalovirus. Radiology Cases Owl‚Äôs Eye Appearance is also found within radiology images from X-rays and CT-scans. They appear as an indication of a clue to be used for analysing the problem. These scans so far do not indicate that the Owl‚Äôs Eye Appearance found within Radiology has any relevance towards the Cytomegalovirus infection within patients. An example of the appearance of an owl's eye appearing within an image is of a skeleton within the bone structure, especially in the spinal cord. In 2009, a journal wrote on the presence of an owl‚Äôs eye appearance that was found within the skeletal structure from the Magnetic resonance imaging scan in regards to compression of the spinal cord. The owl‚Äôs eye sign was able to indicate that the spinal issues may be similar to other spinal cord cases and can be used as a tool to identify future cases. In 2012, a case study journal article was written on a young 10 years old boy, and discovered the owl's eye appearing inside the brain from a magnetic resonance imaging scan. In the findings, it was found that the owl eye‚Äôs sign was seen when doing neuroradiology images. The owl‚Äôs eye sign was also detected from the spinal cord in spine MRI scans conducted in post-treatment for the 10 years old boy. In 2015, a case study on owl‚Äôs eye sign was found in a neuroimaging via magnetic resonance imaging which was rare due to the diagnostic on the patient. The patient was found with the Flailing Arm Syndrome. In June 2016, a journal article was written on the presence of a central pontine myelinolysis. And from doing radiology scans within the brain, they were able to find observations of owl‚Äôs eye signs that also resembled similar to monkey signs. The owl‚Äôs eye appearance was also used as a sign in the magnetic resonance imaging scans conducted in the scanning of the brain to show its relevance to the patient‚Äôs diagnosed profile. In September 2016, a journal article was written on the investigation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans in relevance towards spinal cord conditions. These tests found owl‚Äôs eye appearance as they were of relevance towards spinal cords in past cases. The journal concluded that the owl‚Äôs eyes were not a main characteristic towards tissue death. A textbook has stated that within radiology, the appearance of an owl's eye can be seen from the cells and neurological disorders. This textbook is a clinical review textbook, and has provided relevance between owl‚Äôs eye signs and neurological imaging. Special Cases It was found that a 1986 case study found that CT scans were of little effect when trying to find cytomegalovirus in the presence of owl‚Äôs eye appearance.

As such, they can be viewed as structural analogs of cyclopentadiene, pyrrole or furan, with boron replacing a carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atom respectively. They are isoelectronic with the cyclopentadienyl cation C5H5+(Cp+) and comprise four œÄ electrons. Although H√ºckel's rule cannot be strictly applied to borole, it is considered to be antiaromatic due to having 4 œÄ electrons. As a result, boroles exhibit unique electronic properties not found in other metalloles. The parent unsubstituted compound with the chemical formula C4H4BH has yet to be isolated outside a coordination sphere of transition metals. Substituted derivatives, which have been synthesized, can have various substituents at the 4 carbons and boron. The high electron deficiency leads to interesting reactivities such as metal free hydrogen activation and rearrangements upon cycloaddition which are unobserved in other structural analogues like pyrrole or furan. Once reduced to the dianion, the borolediide complex gains aromaticity and can then participate in similar reactions as the Cp‚àí anion, including forming sandwich complexes.  Electronic Properties = H√ºckel analysis  According to H√ºckel's rule which states that a cyclic molecule is aromatic if it has (4n + 2) œÄ electrons and antiaromatic if there are 4n electrons, boroles represent antiaromatic molecules. In agreement with chemical intuition, ab initio calculations on the parent borole C4H4BH predict it to have an antiaromatic singlet ground state. Its backbone structure features strongly alternating bond lengths, consistent with localised electrons in the œÄ system. This characteristic is preserved in almost all structurally characterised borole derivatives except those derived from [PhBC4Ph4]. This discrepancy was attributed to intermolecular phenyl‚Üíboron œÄ donation within dimeric subunits. In addition, theoretical studies also suggest that borole is significantly destabilised by the delocalisation of its four œÄ electrons (NICS 17.2; ASE 19.3 kcal mol‚àí1). UV-Vis spectroscopy and reactivity studies have been conducted to assess the consequences of antiaromaticity in boroles. Their antiaromatic character entails strong electrophilicity of the boron center resulting in even weak donors such as ethers or nitriles being capable of forming stable Lewis acid‚Äìbase adducts. Moreover, boroles' highly activated carbon backbone readily participates in Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions and is prone to two-electron reductions affording borolediides. A simple H√ºckel model can be used to compare the spectroscopic properties and observed reactivity of boroles against the isoelectronic cyclopentadienyl cation [C5H5]+. Unlike [C5H5]+ which has a doubly degenerate pair of HOMOs , the introduction of a boron center lifts their degeneracy by increasing the energy of the antisymmetric(as) molecular orbital somewhat and the symmetric(s) molecular orbital significantly. As a result, the HOMO in boroles is doubly occupied and no biradical character is observed, in line with a singlet ground state and the diamagnetic character of boroles. Furthermore, boroles exhibit a small HOMO‚ÄìLUMO gap (principally consisting of a œÄ‚ÄìœÄ* transition) and the lowest- energy electronic absorption of boroles is considerably red shifted in the UV- Vis spectra (e.g. [PhBC4Ph4]: Œªmax = 560 nm). Accordingly, boroles exhibit a characteristic blue color. Qualitative comparison of molecular orbitals. Left: Cyclopentadienyl cation. Right: Borole. The green electrons represent the electronic state after coordinating to a Lewis baseBy contrast, introducing two electrons into the vacant LUMO either by reduction or adduct formation with Lewis bases significantly increases the HOMO‚ÄìLUMO gap. Consequently, a dramatic blue shift of the lowest-energy excitation is observed (e.g. [PhBC4Ph4]¬∑pyridine: Œªmax = 340 nm) and the resulting species are usually yellow to red in color. A qualitative drawing is presented to the left. The small HOMO-LUMO gap also makes boroles excellent participants in Diels‚ÄìAlder type reactions either with themselves or with a variety of alkenes and alkynes.  Natural Bonding Orbitals  Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis of C4H4BH has been performed in order to understand the bonding of borole in the familiar Lewis picture. According to the computational results, the occupancy of the two C-C œÄ orbitals is about 1.9, with a tiny amount of electronic charge (an occupancy of 0.13) delocalised on the out-of-plane boron p orbital, illustrated below. The standard Lewis structure of borole captures more than 50% of the overall electronic structure according to Natural Resoanance Theory analysis. As delocalisation of the 4œÄ electrons is prevented by antiaromaticity, the unsaturated boron atom has low occupancy of its vacant pz orbital and is highly Lewis acidic. Along with the low energy LUMO, boroles show an inherent propensity to form Lewis acid‚Äìbase adducts even with substrates of low donor strengths. center Frontier molecular orbitals of Borole optimised using ORCA BP86-D3BJ and def2- TZVPP basis set. Top: HOMO Bottom: LUMO165x165px As the p orbital of boron is virtually vacant and nonbonding (as indicated by its NBO energy level), borole is regarded as a good Lewis acid or electron acceptor. The figure to the right shows the lack of involvement of boron's p orbital in the HOMO and the substiantial Lewis acidic character at boron in the LUMO. Chemically, borole is reactive and unstable in ambient conditions. The pentaphenylborole analog is a highly reactive green solid; it readily undergoes oxidation, partial protolysis, and Diels‚àíAlder reaction with dienophiles. Borole, even in perarylated form, is still very labile. Due to its reactive nature, the structural parameters and thermochemical data of borole are not known. In the optimized structure of borole shown to the left, the B1C, 1C2C, and 2C2C bond lengths are approximately 1.58, 1.338, and 1.518 √Ö respectively, as shown to the left. The longer 2C2C bond in C4H4BH agree with NBO analysis that the œÄ-electron delocalizations are mainly confined on the methine carbons, supporting the antiaromatic nature of the neutral borole.  Borole Dianion (Borolediides)  As the boron has an empty p orbital, boroles tend to accept 2 electrons in order to have 6 œÄ electrons and gain aromaticity. This reduction to borolediides was demonstrated in the early 1980s by Herberich et al. with the isolation of K2[PhBC4Ph4]. Because the atomic orbitals of boron are different from those from carbon in terms of energy, not all atoms contribute equally to the œÄ system in the borole dianion. A Natural Resonance Theory (NRT) calculation shows that there are 3 dominant resonance structures for the isolated [C4BH5]2‚àí dianion as illustrated below. alt= Since borole dianions are isoelectronic to the ubiquitous cyclopentadienyl anion, aromatic delocalisation of the 6œÄ electrons should cause bond lengths assimilation within the BC4 backbone. This is exactly what was found for several characterised structures, namely K2[PhBC4Ph4], K2[(4-Me3Si-C6H4)BC4Ph4] and K2[ClBC4Ph4]. Thus, the observed B‚ÄìC bonds are rather short (1.505‚Äì1.543 √Ö) and all C‚ÄìC bond lengths lie within a narrow array (1.409‚Äì1.456 √Ö).  Synthesis  The first borole derivative to be isolated was pentaphenylborole [PhBC4Ph4], synthesised by Eisch et al. in 1969 as a deep blue solid. Referring to the figure below, the practical synthesis of [PhBC4Ph4] (1) was initially accomplished in two different ways: (a) by direct reaction of 1,4-dilithio-1,2,3,4-tetraphenylbutadiene with PhBBr2 which gives a Lewis base adduct of pentaphenylborole (1¬∑OEt2) in diethylether, and subsequent removal of the solvent. (b) By boron‚Äìtin exchange between 2,3,4,5-tetraphenylstannole derivatives with PhBCl2. Eisch et al. have demonstrated that the latter method can be expanded to other borole derivatives, even though these species have only been generated in situ. alt= Accounting for the drawbacks of each method, the boron‚Äìtin exchange is the current method of choice and has been widely accepted for the synthesis of numerous differently substituted borole derivatives. The other approach has yet to play a significant role in the further development of borole chemistry. Besides the development of a synthetic pathway to the perfluorinated version of (1), the substituents on the BC4 backbone is largely still limited to phenyl substituents. However, substituents beside H has been attached to the boron atom, such as halide, aryl and amino functionalities. Ferrocenyl, cymantrenyl and platinum complex fragments have also been successfully attached. Depending on the boron-bound substituent, the electron density at boron can be altered. Hence, substituents can exert strong influences on the spectroscopic properties of the whole borole system. For instance, significant œÄ-back bonding interactions from nitrogen in [(Me3Si)2NBC4Ph4] raises the borole LUMO energy and a resulting blue shift of the lowest energy absorption in UV-Vis spectra (Œªmax = 478 nm) compared to [PhBC4Ph4] (Œªmax = 560 nm). In order to synthesis less sterically congested boroles, a zirconacycle transfer strategy was adopted by Fagan et al. Reaction of [Cp2ZrC4Me4] with PhBCl2 was expected to result in the formation of [PhBC4Me4]. However, the product was too reactive and only its Diels‚ÄìAlder dimer has been isolated. Evidence for the intermediate [PhBC4Me4] before dimerisation was shown through trapping experiments with 2-butyne and reactivity studies using a variety of unactivated alkenes. In 2018, Lee et al. successfully transformed a borapyramidane into a stable halogen substituted planar borole dianion which was stabilized by Li+ ions positioned above and below the plane of the borole ring, revealing a direct synthetic path to borolediides from borapyramidane.  Reactions  Pentaphenylborole is known to show a wide range of reactivity, owing to its antiaromatic and highly Lewis acidic nature.  Lewis acid-base adducts  368x368px As suggested previously, the high Lewis acidity of boroles allows the ready formation of Lewis acid‚Äìbase adducts with a variety of different donor molecules. This simplest case of reactivity has already been realised in the early days and has frequently been used to highlight the antiaromatic nature of boroles. Pyridines, ethers, phosphines, and different carbene species have been successfully attached to the unsaturated boron center. In general, such reactions are facile and proceed quantitatively, facilitating their isolation in high yield. Upon Lewis base coordination, the former vacant p orbital at boron becomes occupied and cyclic delocalization of the œÄ electron system is no longer feasible, corresponding to the loss of antiaromaticity. However, strong bond length alternation in the BC4 backbone is still observed and remain almost unaffected by these fundamental electronic changes. In contrast, spectroscopic measurements are much more sensitive to adduct formation. Unlike the respective borole precursors which are intensely coloured, the adducts are pale yellow solids with characteristic UV-Vis excitations at Œªmax = 350‚Äì380 nm which agrees with an increase in the HOMO- LUMO gap.  Addition reactions with unsaturated carbon compounds  As a result of only having 4 electrons in the planar œÄ system, boroles experience a large destabilizing effect and thus exhibits high reactivity, such as in dimerisations and cycloadditions. This is why stable borole derivatives can only be achieved by employing bulky substituents around the reactive BC4 core. Reaction conditions: (i) (C6F5)CC(C6F5), toluene, 110 ¬∞C, 7 d; (ii) EtCCEt, CH2Cl2, RT; (iii) PhCCPh, CH2Cl2, RT. The small HOMO-LUMO gap of boroles makes them eminently suitable as Diels‚ÄìAlder participants. The reaction of [PhBC4Ph4] (1) with diphenylacetylene to afford aromatic heptaphenylborepine has been reported by Eisch et al. in the ‚Äúparadigm of pericyclic reactions‚Äù. Recently, the interest in this reaction pathway was revived by Piers et al.., who studied the reactivity of perfluorinated [PhBC4Ph4] (2 in the figure above) towards alkynes in great detail. Of particular relevance was the question of whether the enhanced Lewis acidity of 2 compared 1 affects its reactivity and whether that entails novel reactivity patterns. In that study, 2 was reacted with three differently substituted alkynes that greatly differed in their electronic properties, namely (C6F5)CC(C6F5), (C6H5)CC(C6H5) and Et‚ÄìCC‚ÄìEt. The reaction with the electron-poor alkyne (C6F5)CC(C6F5) required rather harsh reaction conditions (110 ¬∞C, 7 days) and the only observable species was the expected Diels‚ÄìAlder product (3), whose formation presumably follows a mechanism similar to that proposed for 5. The same pathway was found for the more electron-rich Et‚ÄìCC‚ÄìEt (3-hexyne). However, the mild reaction conditions (spontaneous at room temperature) enabled the isolation of the direct Diels‚ÄìAlder cycloaddition product 1,2-Et2-4, which is considered the thermodynamically favored isomer of the two possible 7-borabicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-dienes. Prolonged heating of solutions of 4 resulted in the formation of various products, some of which have been identified as borepine isomers of Et2-5 based on 11B NMR data. This provides for the first time conclusive experimental evidence for the proposed mechanism of borepine formation from boroles and alkynes. However, the reaction of 2 with diphenylacetylene gave unexpected results. Similar to the observations described for 3-hexyne, the electron rich PhCCPh facilitated a spontaneous reaction. Surprisingly, the diphenyl-substituted heptaarylborepine isomers 6 formed by the common Diels‚ÄìAlder reactivity represented only minor components of the product mixture (25%). The potent Lewis acidity of 12 revealed a novel reaction pathway whereby the alkyne first adds to the borole nucleophilically, followed by subsequent aryl migration and ring expansion to afford the boracyclohexadiene 7 as the predominant species (75%). Both reaction pathways likely compete with each other and as a result, the nature of the alkyne (nucleophilicity, substitution pattern) strongly dictates which reactivity is favored. = Ring Expansion = 446x446px The highly reactive nature of boroles also leads to them participating in ring expansion reactions upon reaction with azides. In the reaction of 1‚Äê(2,3,4,5‚Äêtetraphenylborolyl)ferrocene with 4‚Äêazido‚ÄêN,N‚Äêdimethylaniline to generate a new species (8 in the figure above). Cyclic voltametry studies indicated that the 1,2,3‚Äêdiazaborinine exhibits similar electronic effects to that of pyridine, which makes (8) weakly electron‚Äêwithdrawing. Analyses of the frontier molecular orbitals using DFT shows that the HOMO mainly comprises the iron dx2-y2 orbital while the LUMO resides largely on the BN pyridine ring as an antibonding œÄ* orbital. As (8) contains two nucleophilic nitrogen lone pairs, NBO calculations were performed to assess the charges at nitrogen and determine which might be the more reactive. Results show that the partial charges of the pyridine and dimethylamino nitrogen atoms are -0.232 and -0.446 respectively, suggesting a larger accumulation of electron density on the latter group which should make it the more reactive nucleophile. HOMO and LUMO of 8. Left: LUMO Right: HOMO. Structures optimised at the B3LYP level and 6- 31G(d) basis set.  Metal-free H2-activation  481x481px Given the many studies on frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) that point them towards high potential small molecule activators, Piers and coworkers set out to investigate whether the strong electrophilicity of antiaromatic boroles might entail a comparable reactivity. In a seminal paper published in 2010, they successfully demonstrated the metal-free activation of dihydrogen by [PhBC4Ph4] and its perfluorinated analog. Their studies initially focused on perfluorinated [PhBC4Ph4] due to its exceptionally high Lewis acid strength, which readily reacted with H2 both in solution and in the solid state to form two possible isomers as shown above. DFT calculations show that the trans product is thermodynamically favoured by 6.2 kcal mol‚àí1, but no interconversion between isomers was observed under thermal conditions. A plausible reaction mechanism involving a borole H2 adduct was proposed on the basis of the observed isomers ratios and theoretical studies. The authors suggested that the driving force is most likely provided by the disruption of antiaromaticity in the borole ring through ring opening. Even the less Lewis acidic borole 1 was shown to be capable of facile H‚ÄìH bond cleavage to give similar reaction products (trans/cis: 1 : 4.3). Most likely, the unique combination of antiaromaticity and high Lewis acidity enables the metal-free activation of H2 by boroles.  Sandwich complexes  Since the borole dianion is isoelectronic to the cyclopentadienide anion, it also exhibits capability to from ferrocene-like sandwich compounds through an Œ∑5 coordination. Boroles have been experimentally shown to form stable complexes other group 13 elements, such as Aluminium and Galium. Both were synthesised from the neutral substituted borole and the corresponding metal (I)-Cp* complex in benzene as summarised in below. center In the Aluminium complex, an Al (III) ion is sandwiched between a Cp*‚àí and a substituted borolediide dianion, giving an overall neutral structure. Sindlinger reported that examining the orbitals of the simpler hypothetical model complex (C4BH5)Al(C5H5) revealed similar features to the fully substituted compound. The successful transfer of two electrons onto the borole ring becomes apparent from the borole‚Äêbased HOMO essentially being identical with the LUMO in free borole. The oxidation of Al is further in line with Bader charges of +2.29 at Al and -0.78 on the borole (C4B) unit. However, this charge resides on the butadiene backbone as opposed to on boron (CŒ≤ ‚àí0.24; CŒ± ‚àí0.99; B +1.68). In contrast, the charge accumulated on the central (C5)‚ÄêCp* moiety amounting to ‚àí1.17 is equally distributed among the five carbon atoms. Topology analysis was performed using QTAIM, which revealed no bond critical point between Al and B. In line with a strong localisation of electron density on CŒ±, bond critical points are only found for the between Al and CŒ± (delocalization index, DI=0.25) but not between Al and CŒ≤ (DI=0.11) as shown below.centerIn contrast, the gallium analogue forms a Lewis‚Äêbase adduct with a dative Ga‚àíB bond rather than the neutral heteroleptic case for Aluminium, suggesting that Ga still retains the +1 oxidation state. 177x177px Furthermore, synthetic evidence for a neutral Œ∑5‚Äêaminoborole complex of germanium(II) half sandwich has been reported as illustrated to the right. Tholen et al. performed DFT calculations at the M06‚Äê2X/Def2‚ÄêTZVP level of theory and determined that the model complex matched up closely with experimental data determined experimentally by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), with a maximum of 1.6% deviation in atomic distances and angles. Using the model compound, its frontier orbitals were calculated and they reveal covalent bonding interactions between the apical germanium atom and the borole base. As shown in the figure to the right, the HOMO is mainly located at the nitrogen atom while HOMO‚Äê1 and HOMO‚Äê2 are bonding combinations of gemanium 4px and 4py orbitals with the œÄ orbitals of the borole ring. HOMO‚Äê3 is the antibonding combination of mainly the germanium 4s and 4pz orbitals and the lowest œÄ orbital of the borole ring. center Performing natural bond analysis (NBO) on the model pointed to significant orbital interactions between the apical germanium atom and the borole basis as reflected by Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) between the ring carbon and boron atoms and the apical germanium atom (between 0.31‚Äì0.42). For reference, these values are very similar to those of the germanium (II) Cp* cation complex (WBI(GeC)=0.29) and significantly larger than those between lithium ions and the ring atoms of the borole ring in the inverse sandwich complex Li2[H2NBC4H4]. Ionic interactions prevail (WBI(LiC)=WBI(LiB)=0.02) in the latter complex. While the calculated charge distribution for Li2[H2NBC4H4] has an expected highly negative charge (‚àí1.90 a.u.) on the aminoborole unit, the same unit has a much less negative charge in the aminoborole germanium complex (‚àí0.83 a.u.). The increased charge transfer from the aminoborole unit to the germanium atom is also reflected by the uniformly smaller WBI indices between the ring atoms compared those in Li2[H2NBC4H4]. In line with the NBO analysis results, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis predicted a cage‚Äêlike molecular topology for the model compound, with bond paths between all ring carbon atoms and the germanium atom as shown below. center Further theoretical studies have also been conducted at the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP level of theory to investigate the stability of half sandwich complexes between C4H4BNH2 with other group 14 elements (C, Si, Sn, Pb), where the borole ring binds to the divalent metal cation in Œ∑5 mode. AIM analysis was performed and the laplacian for C is < 0, while the other group 14 elements had values > 0. The former indicates a substantial amount of covalency, while the latter confirms the presence of a polar covalent interaction.

The connections among drug trafficking, legitimate businesses, and political donations depicted in The Wire reflect aspects of Jackson's life. Early life Jackson was born in 1957 and raised in the Latrobe Homes in East Baltimore.Last Word: Nathan \\"Bodie\\" Barksdale and Kenny Jackson tell their versions of Baltimore's street life in The Baltimore Chronicles: Legends of the Unwired  Baltimore City Paper When he was seventeen, he committed his first murder when he killed a Baltimore business man during a robbery. With drug and gang influence Jackson was able to secure a high-profile lawyer and gain an acquittal on technicality. Criminal career Jackson has been convicted of several crimes and charged with many more. He was acquitted at trial of murder in 1974.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-05-29/news/1991149038_1_ingram- agents-in-baltimore-fbi-agents He was convicted in 1978 for manslaughter, in 1979 for resisting arrest, and in 1984 on a drug charge.Wired: Alleged Drug- World Figures Tied to Local Politics  Baltimore City Paper Jackson took an Alford plea in 1977 on a charge of manslaughter, and his sentence was suspended. Jackson's name appeared in the Baltimore Sun's 1987 series Easy Money: Anatomy of a Drug Empire, the author of which was David Simon, who went on to be the creator, executive producer, and head writer of The Wire. In the newspaper series, Simon claims that Jackson used to be one of the trusted surrogates of Melvin Williams, a legendary Baltimore heroin dealer whose story influenced The Wire character Avon Barksdale. Jackson explicitly denies any past connection to Williams. Jackson is believed to be responsible for initiating a 1981 drug war for control of the Lafayette Court housing project. Jackson was acquitted of murder charges in 1991; but in the mid-1980s, he was convicted on a federal gun charge. In 1992, Jackson pled a bribery charge down to one count of giving false information to a state trooper. Federal tax- evasion charges were dropped in 1994. Business career By 1984, Jackson owned a mini-market, a shoe store, a produce and carry-out stand, rental properties in West Baltimore, and ran his family's business. But his most successful business venture has been the Eldorado Lounge, an adult entertainment club in East Baltimore. In 1978, Jackson's mother, Rosalie, acquired the Eldorado Lounge from Michael Stewart.Eldoradoloungebaltimore.net Rosalie hired Kenny to manage the club; and in 1986, Kenny advanced the Eldorado Lounge's format. The Eldorado Lounge property was sold in 2000 but re-emerged in 2003 at a different location on East Lombard Street, outside downtown. Kenny Jackson continues to run the Eldorado Lounge there. In 2007, Jackson earned a business degree from American InterContinental University in Atlanta, Georgia. Political activities In 1995, Jackson was involved in establishing a political action committee (\\"PAC\\") that advocated for convicts' voting rights. The PAC donated a total of $8,000 to the campaigns of various Democratic political candidates, including then-mayor Kurt Schmoke and future mayor Sheila Dixon. Jackson's PAC no longer operates. After the Eldorado Lounge property was sold, Jackson contributed $2,500 to then-City Council President Dixon. Dixon was criticized for her role in the sale of the property after a story regarding the sale appeared in the Baltimore Sun in 2000. Then- Mayor Martin O'Malley returned $2,000 which he had received from Rosalie. Rosalie also donated $1,000 to Al Gore's 2000 presidential primary campaign. Possible connections to The Wire In Season 5 of The Wire, the show's fictional Sun reports on the sale of a strip-club property owned by a drug dealer, Fat Face Rick. Nerese Campbell, the fictional City Council President is then shown angrily reading a critical newspaper article about her role in the sale. The anecdote appears to allude to Sheila Dixon's part in the sale of the Eldorado Lounge. Another similarity to Jackson's life is the entrepreneurial impulse of Stringer Bell, the number-two in Barksdale's organization. In Season 1 of The Wire, detective Jimmy McNulty tracks Bell to his business course at a local community college. According to Jackson, Baltimore police actually were present while he took classes at Baltimore Community College. On the show, Bell strives to become a part of the legitimate business world and even gets involved in bribing politicians.

He has published two books of poetry, Isobelle, a Novel in Verse (Toronto 1989) and The Social Comedy (Ottawa 1990). He wrote a one-man show, David Mills - His Poetry and Songs, which premiered in Toronto in 1989 and then toured to numerous Canadian cities in the early 1990s. As a composer he has written a cantata, Vision of Peace to texts from the Book of Isaiah, and several art songs to the poetry of Pauline Johnson and Robert Browning. As an actor, he has appeared on CBC TV and in films for Circle Films and Altlantis Films among other production companies. As a singer Mills has been chiefly active as a recitalist from the 1940s through the 1990s, usually accompanied by his wife, the pianist Marjorie Mutter. He toured numerous times throughout Europe (1960, 1961, 1965, 1970, 1977, 1979, 1983, and 1988) in addition to making numerous appearances in North America, including 8 nationwide tours of Canada. He performed programs of Canadian art songs, and notably premiered works by such Canadian composers as James Gayfer, Welford Russell, Boleslaw Szczeniowski, and Le√≥n Zuckert. The latter two composers notably set Mills' own poems to music. In a 1987 review, music critic Pauline Durichen described his voice as \\"displaying vibrant deep-range control... and at times a soulful sweetness at heights where few basses dare linger\\". Mills also occasionally performed in oratorios and operas. In 1953 he sang in his first professional oratorio performance with the Yorkminster Choir under the baton of his former teacher, D'Alton McLaughlin. In 1954 he performed the bass solos in Ludwig van Beethoven's rarely heard 1814 cantata Der glorreiche Augenblick with conductor Emil Gartner and the Toronto Jewish Folk Choir. On the opera stage he performed with the Canadian National Opera in Toronto in 1953, the Op√©ra de Marseille in 1957-1958, and at a summer festival of light opera in Chicago in 1958. Mills studied voice at the University of Regina (UR) with Alicia Birkett from 1947‚Äì1949, during which time he performed on the Canadian radio stations CKRM and CKCK-FM and was heavily involved with the music programs at a number of churches. He also wrote the libretto for The Rebel, an operetta which was performed by students at the UR. He then pursued further studies at The Royal Conservatory of Music where he was a pupil of George Lambert and McLaughlin.

Zygmunt Rogoli≈Ñski, an insurger of 1831, and Ansberta born Bade≈Ñska were her parents. Her father formed his own armed detachment in the November Uprising. At the age of 17, Maria married Konstanty Piotrowicz, a teacher from Chocianowice. Together with her husband she acted in a Polish national organisation in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Maria and Konstanty were an outwardly well-matched couple. Konstanty, a teacher in an elementary school in Chocianowice was a kind, good and decent man, above all loving his Homeland. Wealth was the only reason why he was not equal to his wife. Konstanty was one of these unselfish idealists who at the time of partitions took jobs of teachers to promote national and liberation ideas among the youth of poorer classes. He did not possess any wealth. Maria's family wealth, on the contrary, was enlarged with a huge fortune bequeathed by her elder uncle, Stanis≈Çaw Strza≈Çkowski. This wealth secured a high standard of living for the married couple.  The battle of Dobra Maria Piotrowiczowa's death place near Dobra Maria was so pitifully affected by all the news about the defeats of insurrectionary troops as well as arrests and imprisonments that in the end she decided to support in person those who were fighting. Together with her husband and part of the servants from the manor farm near ≈Å√≥d≈∫ she joined J√≥zef Dworzaczek's troop operating in this area. She cut her beautiful hair and donned an insurrectionary czamara (men's long-sleeved, fitted, braided outer garment, fastened at the neck, worn by Polish noblemen during the 17th-19th century). A troop of several hundred people consisted mostly of scythe-bearing peasant recruits, there were several dozen riflemen and less than 50 uhlan there as well. At the beginning Maria was on auxiliary duty, she collected money for the troop and bought weapons, food as well as uniforms. When the military situation deteriorated, she declared her intention of joining front-line duty. Maria's troop was tracked down by Russian garrisons stationed in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski and ≈Åƒôczyca. Because of some mistakes in commending and because of an ostentatious march in the towns of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ area, there was an unnecessary unmasking of the troop. It eliminated a surprise element, which is indispensable under guerrilla warfare conditions. On 24 February 1863, as the insurgents camped on the edge of the forest near the village of Dobra, the Russians took them by surprise. Dworzaczek, a doctor, had neglected to post a guard and conduct reconnaissance. The troop was encircled and forced to accept a defensive battle. The battle started around midday and lasted until 5 p.m. From the beginning it was unfavourable for the Polish side. The insurgents repulsed two Cossack‚Äô attacks but during the third one they defended themselves in a chaotic way. Some insurgents did not manage to slip out of the encirclement. Maria fought to the very end, she did not save her life and she did not rescue herself by escaping from the battlefield. She rejected the suggestion of surrender, given to her by Russian officers, because she recognised that such an attitude was incompatible with a dignity and honour of a Pole. Together with a group of young people she bravely defended the troop flag donated by ≈Å√≥d≈∫ women. Encircled by Cossack, she killed one, wounded another one and killed the horse under yet another. She defended herself with a revolver and a scythe. She died hacked by the Cossack. The Cossack tortured the body of dead Maria. Her body was pricked with piqu√©s and sabres. Maria‚Äôs clothing, all in shreds and in blood, was preserved by her family as a relic. The tragedy was enhanced by the fact that Maria was pregnant, later it turned out that she was bearing twins. After the battle the Russians demanded ransom for giving Maria‚Äôs body and for allowing it to be brought to the manor house. In the battle of Dobra three more women were also killed: Weronika Wojciechowska (aged 19) ‚Äì a servant from Byszewy, Antonina Wilczy≈Ñska (aged 20) ‚Äì a worker from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Katarzyna, whose surname remains unknown, fighting at Maria‚Äôs side. In the battle of Dobra about 70 insurgents were killed and twice as many were wounded. About 80 insurgents were captured. Some of them were shot, others were sentenced to penal servitude.  Funeral A monument in the cemetery in Dobra Maria‚Äôs funeral took place on 28 February 1863 in the ancestral residence of the Piotrowicz family in Radogoszcz near ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (Presently Radogoszcz is part of ≈Å√≥d≈∫). ‚ÄûIn an open coffin ‚Äì in fathers‚Äô old manor house was lying her corpse. Lit blessed candles, a sobbing crowd around. Into the room came a Russian captain ‚Äì the one whose soldiers had murdered Maria. He took a candle out of his pocket, lit it and put it at the feet of the heroine, and then he moved back to the corner of the chamber and, resting on his sabre, was crying...\\" Konstanty Piotrowicz, Maria‚Äôs husband, to the very end fighting at his wife‚Äôs side, was seriously injured in the battle. Also Maria‚Äôs servant, Kacper Belka, who from youth had been teaching Maria the art of shooting, horse riding as well as swordplay, was killed. The seriously wounded Konstanty landed in a hospital in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, run by the Women‚Äôs Committee. Despite his wounds he was slowly recovering, convinced that Maria had survived and was being treated in her mother's manor house. Nobody told him about his wife‚Äôs death. At the same time ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was preparing for the funeral of the insurgents who died the day before in hospitals. Maria was to be buried together with them. Konstanty heard the ringing of the bells in a hospital room. When he was told that it was Maria‚Äôs funeral, he had a heart attack. He died on the hands of a wife of an insurrectionary town commander, Mrs ZajƒÖczkowska, repeating the prayer that he had asked her to say. Maria and Konstanty were buried in a family tomb in the Old Cemetery in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The other insurgents who had died in the battle were buried in the cemetery in a village of Dobra. At the 70th anniversary of the uprising on their tombstone was erected a monument with an inscription: ‚ÄûTo the unfree heroes of 1863 ‚Äì free compatriots of 1933\\", and at the 140th anniversary of the uprising - a commemorative plaque with a list of the names of those killed in action. Maria's death caused a sensation in the whole country and it was one of the reasons why on 16 April 1863 the War Department of the National Government banned women from being accepted into front-line duty. From then on, women were only allowed to perform auxiliary functions in the insurrectionary troops. This ban was not obeyed everywhere. Women volunteered to join troops in a man's disguise.

Between 1978 and 1981 they released two singles and one album. History Art Objects played their first gig at Bristol's Ashton Court Festival (mini-stage) in the summer of 1978. At that time, the lineup consisted of poet Gerard Langley, dancer Wojtek Dmochowski, and guitarist Jonathan J. Key (AKA Jonjo) producing a variety of musical and non-musical sounds from his Vox AC-30 and WEM Copicat. Though initially unpopular, they soon became a local fixture as an opening act - no sound-check or drum set-up were required. The drum-free era ended when Gerard's brother John sat in for three numbers at a show in June 1979. A week later Bill Stair added bass to the same three songs at a Hope Centre gig. Shortly after that Jonjo's brother Robin joined on guitar, and the line-up was complete. Local indie label Fried Egg Records released their first single, the \\"Hard Objects EP\\" in early 1980. A second single, \\"Showing Off (To Impress The Girls)\\", was released by Heartbeat Records soon after. In the summer of 1980, the Art Objects recorded Bagpipe Music, their only album, at Crescent Studios, Bath. Heartbeat released it one year later. Shortly after this, the band broke up. Gerard, John and Wojtek recruited some new musicians and played a few more gigs using the Art Objects name before re-emerging as the Blue Aeroplanes. Bop Art, their first album, consisted partly of late Art Objects songs and demos, and featured contributions from Jonjo, Robin and Bill. In 2007, Bagpipe Music was re- released by Cherry Red Records.

A long kicking left footer, Stevenson joined the AFL from Tasmanian club Sandy Bay. He was recruited with the 37th pick in the draft and made his debut in the 1991 season. In his three years playing seniors at Fitzroy, Stevenson never once experienced a win. His first season with Hawthorn, who picked him up in the 1994 Pre-Season Draft, was a contrast. He made his way into the team late in the year and participated in the Qualifying Final loss to North Melbourne, contributing 23 disposals and two goals. Stevenson kicked a memorial goal at Waverley in Round 11 1995. Late into the match against an injured Stevenson was sent back into the field because of a spate of injuries, he hobbled to the forward pocket, the Hawks forced the ball forward and it bounce away from the back of a pack to Stevenson who then managed to dribble it through for a goal. He was later diagnosed to have a broken ankle and Stevenson missed the rest of the season. Returning to Tasmania after his AFL career ended, Stevenson captained Southern Districts Cats in their brief, 27-game stint in Tasmanian Football League football before they folded in May 1999. Stevenson then crossed to Glenorchy and was a member of their 1999 premiership team. He replaced Paul Hamilton as Glenorchy coach in 2000 and served as general manager. Stevenson, who went on to work with AFL Tasmania, is now Hawthorn's Tasmanian operations manager.

It was set up in 1917 to oversee the financial arrangements of the new province of the Anglican Communion when the Church in Wales split off from the Church of England in 1920. History The Church in Wales was created in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914. It is not only a disestablished church but was also disendowed at that time, although it was permitted to retain any post-1662 endowments. The Representative Body had been set up in 1917, so that it could hold the church property and any remaining endowments in trust for the clergy and laity. It was also tasked with the administration of the finances of the church and the pension fund. There was an urgent need for more sources of income and an appeal in 1935 to church members raised ¬£750,000, with a further ¬£600,000 being raised in the 1950s. This enabled the Representative Body to subsidise diocesan funds by up to 70%, but by 2011, income had lagged expenditure, and the subsidy had reduced to 30% of the diocesan costs. The Representative Body The Representative Body of the Church in Wales is the central administrative body of the Church in Wales. Its primary function is to manage the Church's financial assets but it also provides centralised support services to the bishops, archdeacons, clergy and lay staff employed by the Church. These services include financial, property, human resources, ICT services and legal support. Structure Membership of the Representative Body includes the chairman of the Diocesan Board of Finance of each of the member dioceses, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Governing Body, the Archbishop of Wales, one cleric and one lay person elected by the Diocesan Conference of each diocese, up to four members nominated by the Bench of Bishops and up to two co-opted members. Clerical members need to hold or have held an ecclesiastical office in the Church in Wales or a licence from a Welsh Diocesan Bishop. Lay members need to be between the ages of eighteen and seventy-five. The Representative Body normally meets three times a year. Membership is for a three-year term and members are also expected to sit on one of the subcommittees, which meet two to four times per year. Media The Representative Body found itself to be the centre of media attention at the Spring 2017 when it announced the moving of its headquarters to Callaghan Square. Some parishioners felt the move was quite an expense, while the Representative Body maintained its current buildings were unfit for purpose and a move was necessary.\\"Church in Wales to move HQ to one of most expensive developments in Cardiff\\", Wales Online (Accessed 19th May 2017) The move went ahead in September 2017.

Johns Hopkins University football team is currently in possession of the trophy. It is one of the youngest rivalry trophies, yet one of the oldest rivalry games in American college football, dating back to 1894. The McDaniel-Hopkins game has been played annually since 1947, traditionally the last game of the regular season for both schools. Since Western Maryland College changed its name to McDaniel College, in July 2002, the Green Terror have not beaten the Blue Jays. History The Maryland Railroad Lantern rivalry trophy was created after McDaniel graduate school alumnus Vincent Chesney wanted to honor the long- standing rivalry between McDaniel College and Johns Hopkins University. When Vincent's brother, Bob Chesney, became Hopkins' defensive coordinator and eventually the associate head coach, Vincent was even more inclined to honor the rivalry between the two schools. The lantern was chosen to symbolize railroads and light. McDaniel College's former name, Western Maryland College, came from the Western Maryland Railway that connected Westminster and Baltimore. And both schools' mottos refer to giving light. McDaniel College takes its motto from the biblical verse spoken by Jesus Christ in the Gospel of John verse 12:46 and preached on by Paul the Apostle in verse 4:6 of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians and by Saint Peter in his First Epistle of Peter verse 2:9, \\"E Tenebris in Lucem Voco\\" (Latin: I call you out of darkness into light). Johns Hopkins University's motto also speaks about truth as light from verse 8:32 of the Gospel of John, Veritas vos Liberabit (Latin: The truth will set you free). In this regard, the lantern serves not only as a sports trophy but also commemorates the pursuit of scholarship. 1947 kidnapping game The night before the 1947 game a couple of Western Maryland Army Veterans came up with idea of abducting two Johns Hopkins freshmen. They had two Western Maryland College girls trick two 18 years old Hopkins freshmen into thinking they were going to a party at Goucher where there would be \\"women and beer.\\" When the girls lead the Hopkins boys to the car they were tied up by some Western Maryland students. Then the two captured freshmen were brought out to a WMC pep rally where their heads were shaved and they were \\"properly humiliated.\\" Then they were brought to a dorm room where they were tied to a bed and were given as much beer & burgers as they wanted. The next day, during the game's halftime, WMC brought out the Hopkins freshmen to midfield, where some Hopkins players took them back to the sidelines. The game ended in a 14‚Äì14 tie. It was reported that Hopkins freshmen were good sports about it. Western Maryland College had the same thing done to them by their old arch rival University of Maryland College Park about 10 years earlier.Lighter, James E. Fearless and Bold. Westminster: McDaniel College, 2007. 392. Print. Notable Lantern games=2009 On November 14, 2009 Johns Hopkins traveled to Westminster, Maryland home of McDaniel College for the 88th meeting between the two schools in a rivalry that dates back to 1894. The game was also the 1,000 game in McDaniel football history. The game also was the first time two coaches in the state of Maryland played against each other with 100 victories at their respective schools. McDaniel's Tim Keating had 103 wins at McDaniel and Hopkin's Jim Margraff had 126 victories at the start of the game. Johns Hopkins also secured the Centennial Conference title with the 38‚Äì14 victory. 2010 On November 13, 2010 Johns Hopkins hosted McDaniel in Baltimore, Maryland for the 89th meeting between the two schools. The game marked held a series of records. The game marked the 1,001 game in Johns Hopkins football history, interesting because when these teams played in the previous season the game was McDaniel's thousandth on record. This year's game, a 34‚Äì10 Johns Hopkins win also marked the tenth consecutive victory over McDaniel and secured a share in the conference title to Hopkins. 2011 On November 12, 2011, McDaniel College hosted the undefeated #12-ranked Johns Hopkins Blue Jays for the 90th game in the series. McDaniel in 2011 was having a bad year at 2‚Äì8, despite having some of the best players in program history. Hopkins on the other hand was having their best season, as they were on the way to their first undefeated season and highest ranking in school history. McDaniel started off playing one of its best games of the season; entering halftime, the game was deadlocked at 21‚Äì21. The Green Terror created a season- high six turnovers, led by All-American defensive linemen Sam Cox (Sr), who had eight tackles, two forced fumbles, and his program-record 25th career sack. However, Hopkins super-star and all-time Centennial Conference leading quarterback Hewitt Tomlin (Sr) threw for 484 yards. In the end, McDaniel narrowly missed upsetting their rival 28‚Äì24. 2014 On November 15, 2014, the schools met for the 93rd time in 120 years of competition (1894‚Äì2014), the 67th time in which the game marked the end of the regular season.

Durston, 153 U.S. 684 (1894), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the appellant, John McKane, had no federal constitutional right to an appeal. They held that state courts had the right to grant appellate review at their discretion.  Background  According to the opinion, which provides a short history, John McKane was charged and convicted of violating \\"certain provisions of the law ... relating to elections and to the registration of voters.\\" He was sentenced to six years of hard labor at Sing Sing prison, on February 19, 1894. The lawyer representing McKane then filed a petition for the writ of habeas corpus in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York. The circuit court denied the appeal, so the Supreme Court asserted jurisdiction, citing that constitutional questions of the validity of the incarceration were present. McKane also asked for bail while his appeal was ongoing.. Opinion of the Court The opinion, delivered by Justice Harlan, dismissed the claim of due process under the Fifth Amendment since this amendment's due process requirement did not apply to the states. Harlan noted that this claim was probably an accident of the attorney who prepared the petition. He noted that the due process requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment was also not violated, since this is the due process that applies to the states. Code Cr. Proc. N. Y. ¬ß 555 stated that the trial court to which the habeas corpus petition was presented may rule in favor of granting him bail while the appeal was proceeding, and the opinion mentions that this means that the initial trial court had discretion to grant or deny bail. Since the circuit court denied bail, the opinion stated this was consistent with New York law, so that decision was not before the court to review. The Court concluded by affirming the judgment of the circuit court which denied the habeas corpus petition.

Background= Etymology  The name \\"Hulu Culture\\" comes from a Chinese mythological story in which Iron-Crutch Li, one of the Eight Immortals, had a calabash or hulu (), full of universal cures, which he used for the good of the common people. \\"Hulu Culture\\" represents a traditional popular sense of diversification and embraces a wide sector of the community, reflecting the myth. Mission Hulu Concept was founded in 2004 to preserve and carry forward Hong Kong's traditional culture. It later became the organisation Hulu Culture, in 2009. The group assists local authors in the publication of their works and at the same time searches for stories and objects which usually go unnoticed or have been forgotten. Hulu Culture has held various large and small scale exhibitions and seminars with community culture as their themes, to which artists, scholars and students have been invited to participate and share their expertise. Hulu's mission is to spread the message that Hong Kong is an interesting and colorful big city to a worldwide audience through its efforts to promote traditional culture and heritage. In addition, its goal is to contribute to renewing local culture in the context of urban economic development. Foundation Hulu Culture was founded by Simon Go (), who grew up in Kowloon City, Hong Kong where he found that the old groceries stores and shops fostered a feeling of nostalgia. He graduated from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University with a design degree and had been working as a photo-journalist for over 10 years before he started his career in culture preservation. Go's photos focus on lower-class citizens and in the 1990s, he held an exhibition to show the true face of poverty behind social prosperity. Besides photography, he is also dedicated to recording the lifestyles of Hong Kong's people through interviews. Ho's wife, Iman Fok ( pinyin Hu√≤ TiƒÅnw√©n), who is a social worker by profession, also decided to join Hulu Culture as the chief executive to assist with cultural preservation. Funding Hulu Culture has received over four million Hong Kong dollars in donations from the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Some earlier activities were paid for by Simon Go and his wife.  Activities  Hulu concept uses artistic and multimedia materials to present ‚Äúthemes‚Äù or ‚Äúlocations‚Äù of HongKong through words and images and is in the process of providing a research and online resource centre. Resultant research findings will become virtual exhibitions available via the organisation's web site. Expansion of such materials aims to allow the public, including artists, cultural workers and the younger generation to get in touch with local community culture while also providing teaching materials for general education courses to aid in understanding community history and culture. Seminars and workshops are planned periodically where scholars speak on local culture while academic workshops will provide guided cultural tours as community events.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), an influential facet of Chinese cultures, is a combination of philosophy and traditional cultures. Simon Go spent more than four years collecting folk ideas and produced the book Hong Kong Apothecary: A Visual History of Chinese Medicine. The organisation has also created the \\"Hong Kong Apothecary\\", an exhibition that allows interaction between the public and these traditional products. *Orchestration: Hong Kong Old Shops. This exhibition was held in September 2007, and the theme was ‚Äútraditional old shops‚Äù. The productions were also from Simon Go, who visited different traditional shops in Hong Kong, taking photos of them so as to preserve their existence. The photos each has a story behind and they show that community wisdom was introduced under social limitations. This exhibition received unexpectedly good response, having been visited by more than 200 people within 2 days. *\\"Can I help you?\\" exhibition. Noted photographer Simon Go worked with the local illustrator Stella So. Combining black-and-white photos and coloured illustrations, the real face of traditional old shops was presented. Hulu Concept has tried different exhibition methods by combining different artistic media. *Hong Kong Britain. Held in July 2007, the author's aims were to express Hong Kong‚Äôs post colonial social conditions. Throughout the exhibition, reflections on citizens‚Äô lives were guided. *Happy Hong Kong. Many people in Hong Kong were greatly affected by the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. This exhibition is famous of its aim of boosting up Hong Kong people, turning them from a dark side to a brighter one by showing the true tenderness among them. As it suits people of different classes, it attracted attention due its ability to surprises the audience. *Dialogue with the Bed. This exhibition was held to provide a place with the public where dialogues with space were encouraged. Folding beds were used as the language, communicating with the public about the reflections of the urban environment, society and life. *Infinite Possibilities Unfold. After \\"Dialogue with the bed\\", its creator, Lei Man Wai (), was again invited by Hulu Concept for his art creations. Folding beds were used again which were placed just in front of the Lion Rocks of HSBC. Using folding beds, the author hoped that the public would reflect on public art objects as something belonging to everyone in Hong Kong. *Forty years of Hong Kong Housing exhibition. According to its creators, family is a good topic which can easily bring resonance to the public. A family composes of people and furniture. All the furniture is designed and placed by the people and thus is filled with emotions and thoughts. When society changes, thoughts of people will change at the same time. Settings in a flat will then change also. This exhibition aims at promoting an interchange of spirit with the visitors. *Cultural& Architecture Tours in West Kowloon. Between 19December 2009 and 27February 2010, two tours were guided through West Kowloon to appreciate Hong Kong traditional culture through various architectures and other sites, including Lee Wo Steelyard, Hing Wah Tailors, Shing Cheong Watches, Wing Hong Herbal Medicine, Luk Ping Kee Copper Ware, Gan Ming Framing, Fung Moon Kee, Woo Wo Shing Gold& Jewellery and New Asia Barber. *HAD (Heritage√óArts√óDesign) Walk. This crossover exhibition of heritage, arts and design aimed at igniting public interest in local cultures, thereby fostering creative industries and cultures. Teenagers' creativity can be inspired through workshops and participation in community art. It took place at the Former Hollywood Road Police Married Quarters. *Dining at the Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate. Also called \\"Farewell to The Last Resettlement Public Rental Housing Exhibition\\". As Blocks 8 to 14 of the Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate were scheduled for demolition, this exhibition was instigated to provide the chance for people to experience Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate's living style, its indigenous culture and explore the Hong Kong spirit in the face of hardship.

Playing at outside-left, he also made two appearances for Wales in 1876 and 1877. Football career Born in Wrexham, Davies was a keen cricketer and a member of the Wrexham Cricket Club. On 28 September 1872, in search of a sporting activity for the winter months, he attended a meeting held at the Turf Hotel in Wrexham, which led to the formation of the Wrexham Association Football Club. In the early days of Wrexham Football Club, the teams would field as many as 16 players with the goal-posts being connected by a tape. At this time, Davies was described as \\"a robust half-back who backed up the forwards well\\". In February 1876, he took part in trials organised by Llewelyn Kenrick to select Welsh players to represent their country in a match against Scotland. The match was played at Hamilton Crescent, Partick, the home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club on 25 March 1876, with Davies playing on the left-wing in a 2‚Äì2‚Äì6 formation. The Welsh were well defeated, conceding four goals without reply. The return match came on 5 March 1877 at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, with Davies playing on the right; the Scots were again victorious, winning 2‚Äì0. Later that year, he was part of the Wrexham team that entered the inaugural Welsh Cup tournament. After defeating the local Civil Service in the first round, they had victories over Oswestry and Gwersyllt Foresters (8‚Äì0). With only three teams remaining in the tournament at this stage, Wrexham received a bye to the final, at Acton Park, Wrexham, on 30 March 1878 between Wrexham and Druids from Ruabon. The match was a cliffhanger, with no score until the Wrexham forwards charged the Druids' defenders to take the ball over the line to win the game in the final minute, with Davies elder brother, James, being credited with the goal. Career outside football After retiring from playing football in 1878, Davies continued to play cricket for the Wrexham club, eventually becoming an umpire. He was a Sunday School teacher and a lieutenant in the Wrexham volunteer fire brigade. Davies was employed as a stonemason in the family business and died of a chest complaint in April 1891, aged 40.

It was based on an Izhevsk-modified Moskvitch 412, with the first prototype released in 1972 as a small family car. It was considered to be the first Soviet hatchback (released about a decade before the well-known Lada Samara), though the car actually possesses a station wagon body wherein the \\"D\\" pillar has its own support and does not gain from weight reduction (which would position the model more in the liftback family). In Russian literature the car is referred to as a liftback.IZh-2125, \\"Avtolegendy SSSR\\" Nr.54 For the same reason, the car was given the \\"Kombi\\" nickname, which in a way alludes to the Combi coup√© (the word kombi itself meaning \\"station wagon\\" in German and Polish, while in Russian a station wagon is called universal). The Kombi had a notable success in sales within the USSR between 1974 and 1980 due to its durability, off-road capability, increased carrying capacity and was the first Izh car sold for export. Its popularity was also helped by limited competition ‚Äì station wagon variants of the Lada, Moscow-built Moskvitch, and Volga were in short supply and not as easy to buy as the Kombi. In 1982, the Kombi received a facelift, along with the IZh-produced Moskvitch-412 and IZh-2715 panel van and was then rebranded as the 21251. Among notable features, the car borrowed the dashboard from the Moskvitch 2140 and featured improved seats and headrests. The modernised IZh-2125 sold into the 1990s. As the Soviet Union collapsed, IZh was first privatized as the open joint stock company \\"Izhevsk\\" and slowly started converting their automotive production lines to other kinds of manufacture, such as firearms. In 1995‚Äî96, when AZLK's revenue decreased drastically, the company was partially reacquired by AutoVAZ and renamed \\"IZhAuto\\". AvtoVAZ managers then discontinued all of IZh's previous models and ran their own ones into production. An all-new hatchback was introduced, called the IZh 2126 \\"Oda,\\" and it ultimately replaced the Kombi.

Water quality has deteriorated since because of 180,000 tons discharge of wastewater (domestic sewage and industrial) into the lake per day. Each year, about 441 tons of nitrogen and 40 tons of phosphorus flow into the lake. Most parts of the lake have been assessed as eutrophicated, unsuitable for drinking and many recreational purposes.

Geography Traditionally, the valley's entrances are considered the towns of Pinerolo and Sestriere. It is bounded by the Val di Susa (to which it is connected by the Sestriere Pass, at ) to the north and east, the Val Sangone to the north, the Val Pellice to the south, while eastwards is the plain of the Po Valley. The valley is crossed by the torrent from which it takes its name, the Chisone. The valley has a main branch, the Valle Germanasca, and a smaller branch in the area of Pragelato, Parco naturale Val Troncea, a nature park, an ideal destination for hikers, snowshoe hikers and cross-country skiers. History For centuries the Val Chisone was an object of contention between the Duchy of Savoy and the Kingdom of France. The upper valley (Val Pragelato) was part of the French Dauphin√©, while the lower valley (Val Perosa) was under Savoyard control. In 1631, the right shore of the Val Perosa was ceded to Louis XIII of France, returning under Savoy by the Peace of Turin (1696). The upper Val Chisone was part of the semi-independent French state of the Escartons Republic from 1343‚Äì1713. Pragelato was one of the five cantons. The Republic was annexed to Savoy in 1713.

Names The river is known by four different names, each applying to a different section of its course: above Kitzb√ºhel it is the Jochberger Ache, from Kitzb√ºhel to St. Johann in Tyrol it is known as the Kitzb√ºheler Ache, in its middle reaches as the Gro√üache, a name also used for the entire Austrian section,√ñsterr. Bundesministerium f√ºr Land-und Forstwirtschaft, Umwelt und Wasserwirtschaft: Gro√üache - Hochwassersicherheit im Einklang mit der Natur: ‚ÄûEinm√ºndung der Fieberbrunner Ache in die Gro√üache‚Äú Rundwanderweg Kitzb√ºhel, see Etappe 5: Quelle der Gro√üache beim Pass Thurn and in its lower reaches in Germany as the Tiroler Achen. It rises on the Thurn Pass on the territory of Salzburg state, reaches the Tyrolean border after just and the German border after , discharging later near Grabenst√§tt into the Chiemsee lake. The Gro√üache is not the only river whose name changes at the border of two countries that share the same language. A variation of its Austrian name is the ; the Bavarian section is also called the . The term is not a plural form, but a peculiarity of the Bavarian dialect. The name is also used.  Sources  In many publications, even the more serious ones, the length of the Austrian section of the river is often erroneously given as on many maps, the start of the river in Salzburg provinces is missing. On the official Austrian 1:200,000 scale map, the highest part of the river is shown as the Trattenbach, which is longer and also delivers greater quantities of water than the nominal headstream of the river.  Course  The nominal source of the Jochberger Ache lies at above sea level on the Thurn Pass. A few of its early tributaries are, however, larger and have a greater discharge. The most important is the Trattenbach which starts as a trickle from a high cirque at about above sea level between the mountains of the Zweitausender and the Rossgruberkogel south of the Kleiner Rettenstein, and is fed by several other springs before it joins the Jochberger Ache. The valleys of the Jochberger Ache and Kitzb√ºheler Ache are surrounded by the Kitzb√ºhel Alps. The peaks at the end of the side valleys have heights of up to above sea level (the Gei√üstein), around Kitzb√ºhel they are lower than . The Gro√üache forms the eastern boundary of the Kaiser Mountains. Shortly after St. Johann, still in the valley of , lie the villages of Kirchdorf in Tirol and Erpfendorf. Between K√∂ssen, which lies in an east- west valley opening onto the Inn trench and also known as Kaiserwinkl, and the Bavarian valley near Schleching the river pierces the Chiemgau Alps in a narrow gorge, the Entenloch. Near Grassau the Tiroler Achen reaches the Alpine Foreland. The Tiroler Achen finally discharges into the lake of Chiemsee and, thence via the river Alz, belongs to the right-hand river system of the Inn, and the Danube, whose waters eventually reach the Black Sea. Its main tributaries, apart from its headstreams, are the Kitzb√ºhler, Fieberbrunner and , shortly before K√∂ssen the from Reit im Winkl, and in K√∂ssen the and from the lake of Walchsee.  Water works and conservation  Increasing settlement in the Leuken and Achen valleys, the lower valleys of the Ache, since the 1960s led to heavy pollution of the Tiroler Achen, and hence the Chiemsee, with sewage. In the 1970s its water quality was assessed as 'critical'. Only by providing the settlements along the river with proper sewage systems and building modern sewage farms, e.g. in K√∂ssen and Grassau (Achen Valley Sewage Works), could pollution of the river be significantly reduced. The area of the river delta where it discharges into the Chiemsee is designated as a nature reserve. From 1996-2001 the Gro√üache was renaturised in the area of Kirchdorf in Tirol as part of the Kirchdorf flood protection project. This was achieved by deepening the river bed and widening the banks to produce greater drainage volume. In order to guarantee 100 year flood event safety, the river bed was lowered by over a distance of , and the cross-section widened to an average of . In the flood plain a area was set aside for flood retention. In addition to flood protection, this innovative strategy has along brought additional benefits in the shape of nature conservation and human recreation.Hochwasserschutzprojekt Grossache , avt.at (pdf)  External links  * Tiroler Ache * Achen Valley Sewage Association  References  Category:Rivers of Bavaria Category:Rivers of Tyrol (state) Category:Kitzb√ºhel District Category:Rivers of Austria Category:Rivers of Germany Category:International rivers of Europe ","title":"Gro√üache"},{"id":"26548885","text":"Robert Wayne Prehoda (July 7, 1931 - June 11, 2009)Death of Robert Prehoda was an American chemist and futurist.

Often considered one of the greatest chefs of the 20th Century, his self-named restaurant in Crissier, Switzerland (near Lausanne, Switzerland) earned three Michelin stars and before Girardet's retirement in 1996 was often called the greatest restaurant in the world. Biography Girardet was born to Benjamin and Georgette Girardet in Lausanne, Switzerland. His father cooked for years in H√¥tel Central Bellevue in Lausanne, before opening a bistro in Crissier, Switzerland, a small town nearby. Girardet was an athletic child, playing amateur association football (soccer). Although he apprenticed at Le Grand Ch√™ne, a restaurant in Lausanne, his ambition was to become a professional soccer player. During a wine-buying tour of Burgundy for his father's restaurant, a vintner took him to La Maison Troisgros in Roanne. Girardet describes the meal, his first at a renowned restaurant, as a spiritual experience that convinced him to become a chef. When his father died unexpectedly at age 56, he took over the bistro. Cooking originally in a classic style, he began to experiment with lighter and more innovative style, joining with his contemporaries to develop the emerging nouvelle cuisine movement. Cuisine Girardet is known primarily for his nouvelle cuisine style. He avoids using flour in his sauces, thickening them instead with simmered meat stocks. By more modern standards he is considered a traditionalist. He is a critic of molecular cuisine, in particular its use of non-natural ingredients. In 1984 he published The Cuisine of Fredy Girardet (edited by food writer Narcisse Chamberlain), in French with English translation. Restaurant Girardet's restaurant in Crissier opened in 1971. Unlike many acclaimed chefs from the era, Girardet personally spent most of his time in the kitchen supervising the cuisine, rarely traveled, and avoided consultancies and endorsements. The restaurant was called by some the greatest restaurant in the world, and for his work there, Girardet was often called the world's greatest chef. Girardet sold his restaurant in 1996, at age 60, to Philippe Rochat, who had worked under Girardet since 1980, and Rochat's wife Franziska Rochat-Moser. He then retired to the town of F√©chy. Girardet grew bored after retiring, and had some friction with Rochat, who quickly regained the restaurant's three-star rating. Food writer Colman Andrews speculated that Girardet quit during the prime of his career after observing other chefs he knew, including his father, who were unable to sell when they wanted, and who eventually died early from the stress of running a restaurant. Among Girardet's other understudies is L√©a Linster.

This compound is also found in beer and belongs to a class of compounds that contribute to the bitterness and flavor of hops. Xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid, biosynthesized by a type III polyketide synthase (PKS) and subsequent modifying enzymes.  Biosynthesis  Xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid derived from a plant type III PKS, and is synthesized in the glandular trichromes of hop cones. L-Phenylalanine serves as the starting material, which is converted to cinnamic acid by the PLP-dependent phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Cinnamic acid is oxidized by cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and loaded onto Coenzyme A (CoA) by 4-coumarate CoA ligase to yield 4-hydroxy-cinnamoyl CoA, the starter unit for PKS extension. This molecule is extended three times with malonyl CoA, cyclized through a Claisen condensation, and aromatized through tautomerization to form naringenin chalcone (chalconaringenin). This intermediate has the potential to form a variety of different products depending on the enzymes that modify the core structure. In the case of xanthohumol, a prenyltransferase called Humulus lupulus prenyltransferase 1 (HlPT-1) attaches a molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate from the DXP pathway. HlPT-1 has a broad substrate specificity and also participates in making other prenylated flavonoids in the hop plant. Finally, an O-methyltransferase methylates a phenol substituent using S-adenosyl methionine. Total syntheses of xanthohumol and derivatives have been achieved, though extraction from hops remains a primary source. frameless  Beer  In commercial beers, the concentration of xanthohumol ranges from about 2 Œºg/L ‚Äì 1.2 mg/L. During the brewing process, xanthohumol and other prenylated flavonoids are lost as they are converted to the corresponding flavanones. Different hop varieties and different beers contain varying quantities of xanthohumol. Research Xanthohumol is under basic research for its potential biological properties. Xanthohumol can be extracted with pressurized hot water.A. Gil-Ram√≠rez, J.A. Mendiola, E. Arranz, A. Ru√≠z- Rodr√≠guez, G. Reglero, E. Ib√°√±ez, F.R. Mar√≠n.

The techniques of the Ogame Style are divided into five forms, each based on a different element (Fire, Water, Lightning, Earth, and Wind). ; :The teenage son of the legendary swordsman, Jinsuke Kurogane, and youngest student of the Ogame Style. Gama displayed incredible talent and skill by easily defeating a pair of mercenaries Naoyoshi brought to test the Ogame Style. Possessing a highly competitive personality, Gama is attracted to tournament not only to prove his own strength, but to find and confront his father. In addition to his formidable sword skills, Gama also possesses a quick mind, allowing his to constantly adjust and evolve during his battles. Due to his small stature Gama does not possess a lot of physical strength, relying instead on his agility. Gama favors the Ogame Ry≈´'s Lightning Katas, which emphasize quick movements and high-speed attacks.Gama is desperate to kill his father Jinsuke because he betrayed the Ogame school and killed his fellow friends and clan mates. After 1 year of training he grew stronger and mastered some skills. Commander of the 11th corps was easily defeated by Gama. He got the ability of seeing all the attacks by observing movements of the opponent. ; :A student of the Ogame School who returns to Unabara in time to participate in the tournament's second round.

Shinnojou is also a senior student who later become the leader of Ogame Ryu (after a duel fight with Sengoku Iori) ; :A student of the Ogame School who returns to Unabara in time to participate in the tournament's second round. Zenmaru is hotheaded and quick tempered and is easily provoked. He and Gama act like siblings, always arguing over who's stronger. Zenmaru is a member of the Ichinose Family, a clan from the land of Omika who are the swordmasters of that land's Daimyo. Zenmaru carries and wields the signature weapon of his clan, the 'Beast Sword' Kutaragi Sadanaga, an unnaturally large ≈ådachi.Gamaran manga; Chapter 53, Page(s) 9 Zenmaru favors the Ogame Ry≈´'s Fire Katas, which focuses entirely on offense, and emphasizes strong attacks. ; :The senior student and instructor of the Ogame School. He appears at the end of the first round. Iori taught Gama his sword techniques and is apparently a master of all the Style's katas. He possesses incredible skills but is known to sometimes go overboard when fighting opponents. Iori is one of the two student that Jinsuke teaches. Antagonists ;Jinsuke Kurogane :Jinsuke Kurogane is the father of Gama and the former teacher of Sengoku Iori and teacher of Ranmaru.

He took him in and became a father figure to him and taught and trained him as a swordsman. He got into an argument on who should be the leader of the Ogame school with fellow student Tessai. Iori attempted to stop him before the massacre began but failed. As he left he told Gama to become a strong swordsman and in a few years they would meet again, and if he didn't join him then even if Gama was his own son, he would kill him. Jinsuke has a very calm yet confident personality. When discussing the Ogame school with the advisors of the Muhou school he confidently states that the Ogame school will arrive in Jouka and states they are strong because they seriously intend to defeat him. While everyone else was surprised at their strength, he was planning what to do to stop them from reaching Jouka. He also has a somewhat twisted personality, as he stated that the Muhou school will use all their power to crush the Ogame school, as that was his way of showing his love for them. And he enjoyed the idea of his son Gama and his student Ranmaru battling. ;Hyouga Brothers : The brothers Masato (elder), and Kosaburou (younger). A pair of mercenaries hired by Naoyoshi to test the Ogama school's strength prior to the tournament. Masato is far stronger than Kosaburou and neither have a problem with using dirty methods.

Peter Rossi and colleaguesRossi, Peter H., and Steven L. Nock, Eds. Measuring Social Judgments: The Factorial Survey Approach (Sage, 1982); Rossi, P. H., and Richard A. Berk (1985). \\"Varieties of normative consensus\\" American Sociological Review 50: 333-347 developed a framework for creating vignettes by systematically combining predictor variables in order to dissect the effects of the variables on dependent variables. For example, to study normative judgments of family status, \\"there might be 10 levels of income; 50 head-of-household occupations, and 50 occupations for spouses; two races, white and black; and ten levels of family size\\".Heise, David R. Surveying Cultures: Discovering Shared Conceptions and Sentiments (Wiley Interscience, 2010), p. 78 Since this approach can lead to huge universes of stimuli ‚Äì half a million in the example ‚Äì Rossi proposed drawing small random samples from the universe of stimuli for presentation to individual respondents, and pooling judgments by multiple respondents in order to sample the universe adequately. Main effects of predictor variables then can be assessed, though not all interactive effects.Heise, D. R. Surveying Cultures, p. 79 Vignettes in the form of sentences describing actions have been used extensively to estimate impression formation equations in research related to affect control theory.Heise, D. R., Surveying Cultures, pp. 86-120 In this case, different respondents are presented with each sentence, and some are asked to rate how the actor seems during the event, others rate the object of action, and other respondents rate how the overall action makes the behavior seem. Subgroups of respondents receive different sets of event sentences, and the subgroup data are pooled for final analyses. Vignettes enable controlled studies of mental processes that would be difficult or impossible to study through observation or classical experiments. However, an obvious disadvantage of this method is that reading a vignette is different from experiencing a stimulus or action in everyday life.

Along with fellow proto-punk bands the MC5 and The Stooges, The Up served as a \\"house band\\" for the Grande Ballroom in Detroit. The original band line-up consisted of vocalist Frank Bach, guitarist Bob Rasmussen, bassist Gary Rasmussen, and drummer Vic Peraino, until he was soon replaced by drummer Scott Bailey in 1968. The band was closely related to the MC5, as both bands' members lived in White Panther Party founder John Sinclair's commune. In May 1968, Sinclair moved the commune to Ann Arbor, Michigan and both bands followed. The Up served as the opening act for the MC5 during a September 1968 show at the University of Michigan's Union Ballroom in Ann Arbor. This show was attended by Elektra Records president Jac Holzman; Holzman was impressed with both the MC5 and The Stooges (who were the concert's second act) and offered both bands contracts.[ The Up biography at Allmusic site] The Up did not get signed to Elektra and unlike the MC5 and The Stooges, the band never received a major record label contract. The Up continued to play gigs at the Grande Ballroom and other local venues. In 1969, the MC5 ended their association with John Sinclair and the White Panther Party;Makemyday - MC-5 Timeline (1969) The Up took the place of the MC5 as the main musical outlet of the party's propaganda. The Up disbanded in 1973 and faded further into obscurity. In 1975, the band's bassist Gary Rasmussen joined Sonic's Rendezvous Band, a Detroit rock scene supergroup featuring former members of the MC5, The Stooges, The Up and The Rationals.

Curry is an American climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Her research interests include hurricanes, remote sensing, atmospheric modeling, polar climates, air-sea interactions, climate models, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for atmospheric research. She was a member of the National Research Council's Climate Research Committee,National Research Council. Review of the U.S. CLIVAR Project Office. Committee to Review the U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Project Office, National Academies Press, 2004, p. 35. published over a hundred scientific papers, and co-edited several major works. Curry retired from academia in 2017 at age 63. Curry has become known as a contrarian scientist hosting a blog which is part of the climate change denial blogosphere. (pdf) Social scientists who have studied Curry's position on climate change have described it as \\"neo-skepticism\\", in that her current position includes certain features of denialism: she accepts that the planet is warming, that human-generated greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide cause warming, and that the plausible worst-case scenario is potentially catastrophic, but she also proposes that the rate of warming is slower than climate models have projected, emphasizes her evaluation of the uncertainty in the climate prediction models, and questions whether climate change mitigation is affordable. Despite the broad consensus among climate scientists that climate change requires urgent action, Curry has testified to the United States Congress that, in her opinion, there is so much uncertainty about natural climate variation that trying to reduce emissions may be pointless. Education Curry graduated cum laude from Northern Illinois University in 1974 with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in geography. She earned her Ph.D. degree in geophysical sciences from the University of Chicago in 1982. Career Curry is a Professor Emeritus and former Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology; she held the latter position from 2002 to 2013. Curry retired from her university position in 2017, describing part of her reason for leaving academia was what she described as \\"anti-skeptic bias\\", which she described at the time as the \\"craziness\\" of the political nature of climate science. Curry served on NASA Advisory Council Earth Science Subcommittee whose mission was to provide advice and recommendations to NASA on issues of program priorities and policy. She was a member of the NOAA Climate Working Group from 2004-2009, a member of the National Academies Space Studies Board from 2004-2007, and a member of the National Academies Climate Research Group from 2003-2006. Before moving to Georgia, Curry was professor of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado-Boulder, and had previously held faculty positions at Penn State University, Purdue, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Curry was active in researching possible connections between hurricane intensity and global warming.See, for example: * * Her research group did research linking the size of hurricanes and resulting damage that showed that, among other things, the size of the hurricanes was an important factor in determining the number of tornadoes spawned by the system. Among her awards is the Henry G. Houghton Research Award from the American Meteorological Society in 1992, and a Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation in 1988. Curry retired in 2017 from her tenured position as a professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology at age 63, because of what she called \\"the poisonous nature of the scientific discussion around human-caused global warming\\". Michael Mann said climate science would be stronger without her because of her \\"confusionism and denialism\\". In an interview with eenews.net at the time of her retirement, she argued for more focus on reducing climate change vulnerabilities. After leaving academia, Curry shifted to running the Climate Forecast Applications Network, a climate-risk consulting company whose clients include federal agencies, insurance companies, and energy companies. Controversial views on climate change In his 2010 profile on Curry, journalist Michael Lemonick reported that Curry began paying attention to outsider climate blogs after they attacked a 2005 paper she co-authored, which related increasing hurricane strength to global warming. Rather than dismissing their comments, she had discussions with attackers including Christopher Landsea and Pat Michaels, and began participating in outsider blogs such as Climate Audit, where she found the discussions very interesting, as opposed to \\"preaching to the converted\\" at mainstream climate science blog RealClimate. Despite the amount of what she describes as \\"crankology,\\" she thought the time was well spent to avoid groupthink. Though she had previously accepted Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, in the 2010 profile she accused it of \\"corruption\\" and said she no longer had confidence in the process. She had no doubt that the Earth is warming, largely due to human-generated greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, and that the plausible worst-case scenario is potentially catastrophic, but asserted that the IPCC was distorting the science and scientists were not dealing adequately with uncertainties. Climatologists who have commented on Curry's complaints have generally disagreed with her critiques; Stephen Schneider, who had persuaded the IPCC to systematize discussion of uncertainty, said Curry had lately proposed \\"a lot of strawmen\\" and \\"It is frankly shocking to see such a good scientist take that kind of a turn to sloppy thinking. I have no explanation for it.\\" Curry felt that, although she was still able to publish professionally, she had become a victim of mainstream climate science's overreaction to criticism; she believed the climate community had adopted a fortress mentality, defending insiders and refusing access to outsiders. Curry began her own blog open to outsider participation. It was described as part of the climate change denial blogosphere in the 2015 Oxford University Press book Climate Change and Society: Sociological Perspectives. That same year, Curry was described by InsideClimate News as seeming to be \\"relatively new to the denialist camp\\". She was included on an e-mail sent by Fred Singer, who was concerned over the possible fallout from the documentary film Merchants of Doubt. Curry's position on climate change was much criticized by climate scientists, and she became known as a contrarian scientist. A 2013 Media Matters for America study found that Curry, as a contrarian, was among the \\"climate doubters\\" most frequently quoted by the press as spreading public doubts about climate science. Going against the vast majority view of climate scientists, she had suggested to newspapers that most of the recent global warming was not human-caused, and had hinted that IPCC scientists are motivated by \\"funding\\" even though they are not paid for their contributions. She consistently presents her view that climate science has much larger uncertainties than those shown by mainstream studies, though she has not shown any previously unconsidered cause for such uncertainty. Political influence Judith Curry testimony at the Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness on December 8, 2015 Curry has repeatedly been invited as a witness to United States Congressional hearings, as one of the few scientists advancing doubts about the significance of human contributions to climate change, and some political figures have used Curry's statements and writings in their arguments. For instance, when Christopher Shank, a politician and President Trump's first appointment to the NASA transition team, questioned the role of humans in climate change, Shank referred to Curry's work and her site's URL repeatedly in his testimony. Between 2014 and February 2019, Curry testified before at least six Republican-led House committees, expressing the idea that the dangers of global warming are overstated and difficult to predict. These testimonies include statements criticizing President Obama's climate plan, the UN climate action plan, and other policy proposals aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In her testimony before the Natural Resources Committee on February 6, 2019, Curry stated that, \\"Man-made climate change is not an existential threat in the 21st century.... The perception of a near-term apocalypse has narrowed the policy options\\". Judith Curry at the June 25, 2019 hearing of the U.S. Committee on Ovesight and Reform in a meeting on Recovery, Resiliency and Readiness‚ÄîContending with Natural Disasters in the Wake of Climate Change In February 2019, Curry was among those listed by the Trump administration for possible inclusion on a \\"Presidential Committee on Climate Security\\" intended to carry out \\"adversarial scientific peer review\\" of climate science. A 2019 article in Human Ecology Review described her position as a form of climate denialism, criticizing her downplaying of potential future climate change effects and emphasis on the costs of addressing climate change. Publications Curry is the co-author of Thermodynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans (1999), and co- editor of Encyclopedia of Atmospheric Sciences (2002). Curry has published over 130 scientific peer reviewed papers. In February 2010 Curry published an essay called \\"On the Credibility of Climate Change, Towards Rebuilding Trust\\" on Watts Up With That? and other blogs.Turner, Amy. \\"Richard Dawkins' pro-am clash in the boffins‚Äô blogosphere\\", The Times, February 28, 2010. In November 2018, Curry submitted for publication a report on sea level rise titled Sea Level and Climate Change in which she argues against the scientific community's consensus, presenting her case that sea level rise has been a \\"slow creep\\" over the last 150 years and has been unaffected by anthropogenic climate change. Though these arguments place her outside the academic consensus, Curry said that her findings were compatible with those presented by the International Panel on Climate Change. An Associated Press article suggested that Curry's arguments could dampen moves by cities and municipalities to start lawsuits against oil-and-gas companies seeking recompense for anticipated future damage due to sea level rise. ;Books by Curry * , by Judith A.

Abbreviation  The individual countries using this datum abbreviate it in different ways depending on their local language, as follows: * Austria: m √º. Adria, m.√º.A. or m√ºA, colloquially known as Seeh√∂he or Adriah√∂he * Hungary: mAf from m√©ter Adria felett * Former Yugoslavian states: m. i. J. from Metara iznad Jadrana 'Metres above the Adriatic' may be abbreviated in English to m AA  Height differences between Austria and neighbouring countries  In Austria orthometric height is used, while its neighbours use other height systems, which leads to differences. On the state borders these differences are: * Germany: +25 to +34 cm, normal height according to the Normalh√∂hennull levelling system based on the Amsterdam Ordnance Datum * Italy: ‚àí0.5 to ‚àí3.2 cm, orthometric height referring to Genoa Tide Gauge * Switzerland and Liechtenstein: ‚àí1.6 to ‚àí7.5 cm, orthometric height ‚Äì 'Metres above the Sea' (Meter √ºber Meer) based on the elevation of the Pierres du Niton in Lake Geneva at above average Marseille Tide Gauge * Slovakia: +57 cm, normal height based on Kronstadt Tide Gauge * Slovenia: ‚àí8 to ‚àí12 cm, orthometric height ‚Äì metres above the sea referring to Koper Tide Gauge * Czech Republic: +46 to +56.3 cm, normal height based on Kronstadt Tide Gauge, and * Hungary: +49.6 to +60.6 cm, normal height ‚Äì 'Height above Sea Level' () based on the elevation of the Nadap benchmark at above Kronstadt Tide Gauge.

The book was written by Harvey Pekar and Heather Roberson, with illustrations by Ed Piskor. It is based on Roberson's travels through the Republic of Macedonia. Plot Macedonia opens with Heather Roberson, a student of Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, arguing with a professor about the inevitability of war. Roberson argues that it is avoidable, while the professor argues that it is not. Roberson cites Macedonia, which avoided civil war unlike some other former states of Yugoslavia, as an example. Roberson decides to make this the subject of her thesis, and travels to Macedonia to carry out her research. Once inside the country, Roberson sees the tense relationship between the majority Macedonians and the Albanians, the largest minority. She travels to the cities of Belgrade (in Serbia), Skopje, and Tetovo, conducting interviews with an ombudsman, professors, and a police trainer. Production Harvey Pekar in 2008. Inspiration Roberson was inspired to start on the project as a result of an argument with a professor about the inevitability of war. She wanted to know what had saved Macedonia, while other former Yugoslavia states around it were in civil war. Collaboration Roberson was in her hometown in Missouri, stopping there before going to Macedonia to carry out research for her thesis when she met Pekar. Pekar was there on the invitation of Roberson's sister, speaking at a showing of American Splendor, a film based on his comics. Roberson described her project to Pekar, who expressed interest in collaborating on a comic book. He expected a short story, but ultimately ended up with 150 pages of material. Describing the collaboration, Pekar said \\"It was one of the best working relationships I've ever had\\". Pekar would create preliminary drawings of each page, then passed them on to illustrator Piskor in Pittsburgh. Reception Macedonia received mixed reviews. A reviewer in Booklist stated the Pekar \\"skillfully prepared the book‚Äôs text and basic layout\\", but complained that Piskor's illustration was \\"stiff\\". Other reviewers however responded positively to Piskor's illustration, citing its \\"stylish, crisp feel\\". Some reviewers complained that the text overwhelmed the illustrations, leading it to feel more like a \\"lecture\\" than a graphic novel.

Godse is best known for his travelogue Majha Pravas (My Travels), which is notable for the description of his \\"true and unique\\" experiences of the First War of Independence of 1857 during his travels in North India. It is one of the earliest travelogues written in the Marathi language. Journey Vishnubhat Godse was a priest from Varsai, a village near Pen in Bombay Presidency. His ancestors worked as priests during the reign of the Peshwas, but the defeat of the Peshwas in 1818 by the East India Company, a few years before his birth, meant his family had fallen on hard times. Vishnubhat therefore decided to visit North India in search of a livelihood. Vishnubhat started his journey to North India on March 30, 1857 with his uncle. On July 1, 1857, he reached the Mhow Cantonment where he first heard news of the revolt. After that he visited Gwalior, Dhar, and Ujjain, but he could not find a way to make a living because of the changed conditions due to the revolt. Vishnubhat subsequently went to Jhansi, where he was later appointed as the court priest by the Queen of Jhansi, Rani Lakshmibai. He was present in Jhansi when British forces commanded by General Hugh Rose attacked on April 3-4, 1858 and was able to escape from the city after it had been captured by them. He barely escaped from Jhansi after hiding in various obscure places while the massacre was going on. He later went to Kalpi to join the queen who had escaped there during the attack. He was also present at the battle of Kalpi in May 1858. Later, he paid visits to Bramhavarta, Chitrakuta, Kanpur, Lucknow, and Ayodhya. He was in Ayodhya on the day of Ram Navami, i.e. April 11, 1859. Throughout his journey, he had dangerous encounters with mutineers, company soldiers, and robbers, who took almost all of the money he had earned during his travel. In the beginning of 1860, he returned to Varsai via Sagar, Hoshangabad, Indore, and Nashik. Travelogue Vishnubhat returned to Varsai in early 1860, but did not start writing his travelogue until 1883. It was a handwritten manuscript in the Modi script of the Marathi language that was not published until after his death. It was first published in 1907, 50 years after the mutiny, and given the name Maza Pravas: 1857 cya Bandaci Hakikat (My Travels: The Story of the 1857 Mutiny). This edition was edited by Chintamani Vaidya, but he gave the original manuscript to Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal in Pune. The original manuscript was published by Datto Vaman Potdar in 1966.

This work was washed off the walls of the Warmun Art Centre in the catastrophic floods of March 2007 and when later recovered from beside the creek it was found to have been seriously damaged. The work portrays the Christian iconography of the 14 Stations of the Cross, but also the history of conflict and racial violence in the artist's community in the 1920s and 1930s.

Many animal theme parks combine classic theme park elements, such as themed entertainment and amusement rides, with classic zoo elements such as live animals confined within enclosures for display. Many times, live animals are utilized and featured as part of amusement rides and attractions found at animal theme parks. Two examples of animal theme parks are Disney's Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida () and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida (). These commercial parks are similar to open-range zoos and safari parks according to size, but different in intention and appearance, containing more entertainment and amusement elements (stage shows, amusement rides, etc.). The term \\"animal theme park\\" can also be used to describe certain marine mammal parks, oceanariums, and more elaborate dolphinariums, such as SeaWorld, which offers amusement rides and additional entertainment attractions, and are also where marine animals such as whales are kept, contained, put on display, and are sometimes trained to perform in shows. In 2010 the practice of keeping animals as trained show performers in theme parks was heavily criticized when a trainer was killed by an orca whale at SeaWorld Orlando in Florida.

Definitions Formally, we start with a non-zero algebra D over a field. We call D a division algebra if for any element a in D and any non-zero element b in D there exists precisely one element x in D with a = bx and precisely one element y in D such that . For associative algebras, the definition can be simplified as follows: a non-zero associative algebra over a field is a division algebra if and only if it has a multiplicative identity element 1 and every non-zero element a has a multiplicative inverse (i.e. an element x with ). Associative division algebras The best-known examples of associative division algebras are the finite-dimensional real ones (that is, algebras over the field R of real numbers, which are finite-dimensional as a vector space over the reals). The Frobenius theorem states that up to isomorphism there are three such algebras: the reals themselves (dimension 1), the field of complex numbers (dimension 2), and the quaternions (dimension 4). Wedderburn's little theorem states that if D is a finite division algebra, then D is a finite field.Lam (2001), [ p. 203] Over an algebraically closed field K (for example the complex numbers C), there are no finite-dimensional associative division algebras, except K itself.Cohn (2003), [ Proposition 5.4.5, p. 150] Associative division algebras have no zero divisors. A finite- dimensional unital associative algebra (over any field) is a division algebra if and only if it has no zero divisors. Whenever A is an associative unital algebra over the field F and S is a simple module over A, then the endomorphism ring of S is a division algebra over F; every associative division algebra over F arises in this fashion. The center of an associative division algebra D over the field K is a field containing K. The dimension of such an algebra over its center, if finite, is a perfect square: it is equal to the square of the dimension of a maximal subfield of D over the center. Given a field F, the Brauer equivalence classes of simple (contains only trivial two-sided ideals) associative division algebras whose center is F and which are finite-dimensional over F can be turned into a group, the Brauer group of the field F. One way to construct finite-dimensional associative division algebras over arbitrary fields is given by the quaternion algebras (see also quaternions). For infinite-dimensional associative division algebras, the most important cases are those where the space has some reasonable topology. See for example normed division algebras and Banach algebras. Not necessarily associative division algebras If the division algebra is not assumed to be associative, usually some weaker condition (such as alternativity or power associativity) is imposed instead. See algebra over a field for a list of such conditions. Over the reals there are (up to isomorphism) only two unitary commutative finite-dimensional division algebras: the reals themselves, and the complex numbers. These are of course both associative. For a non-associative example, consider the complex numbers with multiplication defined by taking the complex conjugate of the usual multiplication: :a*b=\\\\overline{ab}. This is a commutative, non-associative division algebra of dimension 2 over the reals, and has no unit element. There are infinitely many other non-isomorphic commutative, non-associative, finite- dimensional real divisional algebras, but they all have dimension 2. In fact, every finite-dimensional real commutative division algebra is either 1- or 2-dimensional. This is known as Hopf's theorem, and was proved in 1940. The proof uses methods from topology. Although a later proof was found using algebraic geometry, no direct algebraic proof is known. The fundamental theorem of algebra is a corollary of Hopf's theorem. Dropping the requirement of commutativity, Hopf generalized his result: Any finite-dimensional real division algebra must have dimension a power of 2. Later work showed that in fact, any finite-dimensional real division algebra must be of dimension 1, 2, 4, or 8. This was independently proved by Michel Kervaire and John Milnor in 1958, again using techniques of algebraic topology, in particular K-theory. Adolf Hurwitz had shown in 1898 that the identity q\\\\overline{q} = \\\\text{sum of squares} held only for dimensions 1, 2, 4 and 8., p.202 (See Hurwitz's theorem.) The challenge of constructing a division algebra of three dimensions was tackled by several early mathematicians. Kenneth O. May surveyed these attempts in 1966.Kenneth O. May (1966) \\"The Impossiblility of a Division Algebra of Vectors in Three Dimensional Space\\", American Mathematical Monthly 73(3): 289‚Äì91 Any real finite-dimensional division algebra over the reals must be * isomorphic to R or C if unitary and commutative (equivalently: associative and commutative) * isomorphic to the quaternions if noncommutative but associative * isomorphic to the octonions if non-associative but alternative. The following is known about the dimension of a finite- dimensional division algebra A over a field K: * dim A = 1 if K is algebraically closed, * dim A = 1, 2, 4 or 8 if K is real closed, and * If K is neither algebraically nor real closed, then there are infinitely many dimensions in which there exist division algebras over K.

The Penkovka culture is an archaeological culture in Ukraine spanning Moldova and reaching into Romania. Its western boundary is usually taken to at the middle Prut and Dniester rivers, where contact with the Korchak culture occurs. Its bearers are commonly identified as the Antes people of 6th-century Byzantine historiography.; ; ;  Geography  The core of the culture seems to be in Left-bank Ukraine, especially along the Sula, Seim, Psel, Donets and Oril rivers, but its territory extends to Right-bank Ukraine, and Penkovka pottery is also found in eastern and southern Romania, where it co-exists with wheel- made pottery of late Roman derivation; and is referred to as the Ipotesti‚ÄìCandesti culture by Romanian archaeologists.. Like other \\"cultures\\", the I-P culture has been criticized as a heuristic category invented by Romanian archaeologists to 'prove' the existence of civilized \\"Daco-Romans' before the arrival of barbarian Slavs.; see Curta. The Making of the Slavs. p. 231. Penkovka-type pottery has even been found in Byzantine forts in the north-eastern Balkans. \\"Nomadic\\" style wheel-made pottery (called Pastyrske or Saltovo ware) also occurs in the Ukrainian Penkovka sites as well as in the lower Danube and Bulgaria, but is most commonly found within the Saltovo- Mayaki culture, associated with Bulgars, Khazars and Alans. Hand-made Penkovka pottery is distinguished from Prague-Korchak types on the basis of its biconical profile and tendency for out-turned rims. However, Florin Curta has argued that there can be no simple relationship between the type of ceramic vessel and the ethnicity of groups which consumed them. E. Teodor performed a detailed analysis of ceramic vessels in 6th century southeastern Europe, and discovered a complex picture which cannot be reduced to 2 or 3 broad 'archaeological cultures', as each microregion and even individual site shows idiosyncrasies in their ceramic profile and degree of connectivity to other regions of 'Slavic Europe'.  Penkovka settlements  Penkovka settlements tended to be located on the terraces of rivers- usually arranged in a linear fashion.Gimbutas,1971. pp. 80‚Äì85 Buildings were usually square-shaped, post- hole constructs dug into the ground, and were equipped with an oven in the corners. There are also rounded buildings, otherwise not found in other Slavic territories, which have been associated with a nomadic influence. However, they are different from traditional tent-like nomadic yurts. Settlements tended to be abandoned after a period of habitation and were often re-occupied years later, reflective of the itinerant form of agriculture practiced by the populace. Two fortified sites are known from the Penkovka region - Seliste and Pastyrske. The latter has been excavated in detail, and appears to have been an Iron Age fortification which was also occupied in early Medieval times. Measuring 25 ha, it included numerous settlement buildings as well as evidence of specialised industrial activity. Szmoniewski argues that \\"Pastyrs‚Äôke may have also been a political power center, the seat of a ruler with territorial authority\\". Two forms of burials are found north of the Black Sea in the 6th and 7th centuries. Poorly furnished cremation burials, either inside urns or into shallow pits, are concentrated in the forest-steppe zone; whilst more elaborately equipped inhumations are found in the open steppe. Traditionally, the latter are attributed to \\"Turkic\\" nomads whilst the cremation burials were a typically Slavic rite. However, a straightforward ethnic attribution has been questioned - as the pottery and metalwork (see below) found in the 'nomadic' inhumations shows clear analogies to that found in 'Slavic' settlements in the forest-zone. Thus Curta has argued that the inhumation burials represented a marker of social distinction of chiefs and 'big men' from the forest-zone settlements.  Antian antiquities  Another set of cultural elements often attributed to the Antes are numerous hoards of silver and gold ornaments dated to the 7th century, and are variously called \\"Antian antiquites\\" or the Martynovka culture. Scholars have debated to whom the Martynovka elements belonged to since the late 19th century; as A. Spitsyn attributed them to the Slavic Antes, whilst J. Harmatta rather attributed them to Turkic groups, specifically the Kutrigurs. The situation was clarified when Curta's analysis revealed that early in the 7th century, such metalwork appears in hoards deposited in the forest-steppe, whilst later assemblages appear as interment gifts in 'nomadic burials'. Thus, again, rather than simplistic ethnic explanations, Curta's analysis suggests that the pattern of ornament consumption varied with time and was related to social status and gender: i.e. earlier in the 6th century, elites displayed status by burying hoards of silver in the forest-steppe, whilst later there was more aggressive posturing and status display in the form of richly furnished male warrior graves, no doubt related to the competition for supremacy on the north Black Sea region between Pannonian Avars, Bulgars, Khazars and Western Gokturks. The metalwork betrays a variety of influences - especially the world of the steppe nomad which in turn showed Caucasian, Byzantine, and Sassanian inspiration. Yet other elements showed affinities with the 'Balto-Slavic' world of the forests of Eastern Europe. Overall, the equation of the Penkovka culture and Martynovka hoards with the Antes is problematic, as such cultural features exist into the 8th century, long after the Antes were defeated by the Avars in 602 AD and ceased to exist as an independent tribal polity. Such diffuse styles cannot be directly linked to any single people, but rather reflect a myriad of peoples who existed in the Black Sea region from 450‚Äì750 AD, including Antes, Kutrigurs and Bulgars. Early Volyntsevo culture, as well as the Saltovo-Mayaki culture developed on the basis of Kolochin and Penkovka cultures.

Development Scottish Aviation had taken over production of the original Jetstream design from Handley Page, and when it was nationalised along with other British companies into British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) in 1978, BAe decided the design was worth further development, and started work on a \\"Mark 3\\" Jetstream. As with the earlier 3M version for the USAF, the new version was re-engined with newer Garrett turboprops (now Honeywell TPE331) which offered more power (flat rated to 1,020 shp/760 kW with a thermodynamic limit of 1,100 shp/820 kW) and longer overhaul intervals over the original Turbomeca Astazou engines. This allowed the aircraft to be offered in an 18-seat option (six rows, 2+1), with an offset aisle, and with a water methanol option for the engine to allow the ability to operate at maximum load from a greater range of airfields, particularly in the continental United States and Australia. The result was the Jetstream 31, which first flew on 28 March 1980, being certificated in the UK on 29 June 1982. The new version proved to be as popular as Handley Page hoped the original model would be, and several hundred 31s were built during the 1980s. In 1985, a further engine upgrade was planned, which flew in 1988 as the Jetstream Super 31, also known as the Jetstream 32. Production continued until 1993, by which time 386 31/32s had been produced. Four Jetstream 31s were ordered for the Royal Navy in 1985 as radar observer trainers, the Jetstream T.3, but were later used for VIP transport. In 1993, British Aerospace adopted the Jetstream name as its brand name for all twin turboprop aircraft. As well as the Jetstream 31 and Jetstream 32, it also built the related Jetstream 41 and the unrelated, but co-branded BAe ATP/Jetstream 61.

There were no fatalities among the 11 occupants. * On 26 December 1989, United Express Flight 2415 operated by N410UE of North Pacific Airlines crashed short of the runway at Tri-Cities Airport, Washington, USA. The crew executed an excessively steep and unstabilized ILS approach. That approach, along with improper air traffic control commands and aircraft icing, caused the aircraft to stall. Both crew members and all four passengers were killed. * On 12 March 1992, a deadheading USAir Express Jetstream 31 crashed on landing at McGhee Tyson Airport near Knoxville, Tennessee after the pilot failed to lower the landing gear. There were no passengers aboard, however the 2 crew members were killed. * On 1 December 1993, Northwest Airlink Flight 5719 had a controlled flight into terrain killing all crew and passengers. * On 13 December 1994, Flagship Airlines Flight 3379 stalled and crashed while on approach to Raleigh-Durham International Airport in the United States, killing 13 of the 18 passengers and both crewmembers. The captain mistakenly thought that an engine had failed and decided to abandon the landing approach, then lost control of the aircraft. * On 21 May 2000, an East Coast Aviation Services Jetstream (N16EJ) crashed into terrain on the flight's second approach into Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport, killing all 19 occupants. * On 8 July 2000, Aerocaribe Flight 7831 crashed into a mountainous area as the aircraft was on approach into Carlos Rovirosa P√©rez International Airport and killed all 19 passengers and crew. * On 19 October 2004, Corporate Airlines Flight 5966 crashed on approach to Kirksville Regional Airport killing 13 out of 15 passengers and crew. * On 18 November 2004, Venezolana Flight 213 crashed into a fire station on landing at Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Airport (Venezuela) after a flight from Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso Airport. Four passengers were killed out of 21 passengers and crew. * On 8 February 2008, Eagle Airways Flight 2279 was hijacked by a passenger over New Zealand just after taking off from Woodbourne Airport. The copilot managed to restrain the hijacker eventually and the aircraft landed safely at Christchurch International Airport.

The aircraft was substantially damaged when the starboard undercarriage collapsed. There were no injuries amongst the twelve passengers and two crew. * Following the 8 March 2012 crash, the same BAe Jetstream 3102 suffered a similar incident, again operated by Links Air under a new registration, when it crashed at Doncaster's Robin Hood Airport on a flight from Belfast on 15 August 2014. This further incident came after reported problems with its undercarriage while landing. The single passenger was taken to hospital for reported minor injuries. * On 12 October 2014, an engine of a Jetstream 32 aircraft belonging to Air Century Airlines caught fire while landing after a charter flight from Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in Puerto Rico to Puntacana international airport in the Dominican Republic. The aircraft was destroyed in the subsequent fire. There were no injuries among the 13 passengers and two crew members on the flight, the crew handled the situation in a timely and professional manner, avoiding any casualties. *July 2018, an engine of a Jetstream 32 aircraft belonging to Servicios A√©reos Profesionales (SAP Air) failed in the climb out at 5000 ft on departure from Santa Clara Airport (SNU), Cuba.

Indianapolis Power & Light (IPL) has a 20-year contract to purchase and distribute the wind farm's output.  History  IPL and enXco announced their plan to build the wind farm in April, 2008. The original plan called for 67 GE 1.5 MW wind turbines. By the time construction started in April 2009, the plan had changed to use REpower 2.0 MW wind turbines instead, with 80m towers. At the time of construction, Hoosier was only the third wind farm in the United States to use REpower wind turbines, after Goodnoe Hills Wind Farm in Goldendale, Washington, and Shiloh Wind Farm Phase II in Birds Landing, California (also constructed by enXco and Mortenson). Construction took six months. The groundbreaking ceremony on April 17, 2009, included Indiana Lt. Governor Becky Skillman and other government and industry officials.  Environmental impact  IPL expects Hoosier to generate enough power for 29,000 homes and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 348,000 tons per year.

The sisters clash when Olga forbids Myra from going to a dance with her boyfriend Steve. That same day, chance sends Olga an unexpected and unwelcome customer, ex-boyfriend George (Preston Foster). Unbeknownst to her, George and his nervous partner Jeff (Lyle Talbot) are on the run from the police after a botched robbery that left two men dead, killed by George. Initially intent on sneaking across the border to Mexico, George decides to stay awhile when two jewelry-laden, wealthy divorcees, \\"Feathers\\" Tifton (Glenda Farrell) and \\"Tinkle\\" Ashton-Ashley (Ruth Donnelly), are stranded there for the night by their long-suffering chauffeur Frank (Frank McHugh). Frank pretends there is something wrong with their car so he can have a rest from driving. Olga, the mechanic, plays along. When Mrs. Ashton-Ashley becomes worried about a large Mexican family spending the night nearby, Olga offers to store the women's valuables in her safe. George manipulates Olga's feelings, reviving the love she once felt for him. Though she knows better and tries to resist, she eventually succumbs to his charms, and they sleep together. This gives Myra the opportunity to sneak away to meet Steve. Myra returns later that night, terribly upset after having been taken advantage of by Steve. When Olga starts berating her for going off with her boyfriend, she responds by revealing she saw George leaving Olga's bedroom. The two miserable women then comfort each other. Meanwhile, George orders Jeff to open the safe. Jeff is reluctant to cause trouble for Olga, but gives in when George pulls out his gun. Olga overhears George say he slept with her just to set up the theft. She gets her pistol and shoots him. As he lays dying, he apologizes to her. Olga lets Jeff go.

COMA) was a nonprofit music presenter and networking organization operating in the Los Angeles area from 1983 until 1991. The organization is best known for producing the album A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to COMA and a series of festivals called Day of Music. Founded by Titus Levi and Eric Potruch, COMA officially launched on March 3, 1983, when the two founders passed out a flyer describing COMA‚Äôs planned activities. This flyer came to be known as The COMA Manifesto. COMA's goals included bringing an eclectic scope of artists from diverse genres, for concerts and festivals. Genres included (but were not limited to) jazz, jazz rock, progressive rock, experimental 20th century compositions, ambient music music-concrete, free-jazz, post-rock improvisation, experimental rap, and multicultural/trans-cultural experiments. COMA produced its first live performance event in July 1983 at a small art gallery in Downtown Long Beach. The format of the concert would form the template of the Day of Music events: solo performers and small ensembles playing sequentially over several hours. In this case, the performances started at noon and ended at 10:00 PM. At the Day of Music events, which launched in 1988, events started at noon and ran until midnight. They took place in multiple venues in the Pine Avenue area of Downtown Long Beach, including the gallery-caf√©-performance space System M, a restaurant called Mum‚Äôs, and multiple gallery spaces on Pine Avenue, Broadway, and Third Street in Downtown Long Beach. In 1985 the group produced a full- length LP on Rotary Totem Records called A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to COMA. This ten- song disc included music from a number of rock-leaning performers, including Dogma Probe, Elma Mayer, Tao Mao, The Underpeople, Mark Soden, The Motor Totemist Guild, Cartoon, Newcross, 5UUs, and Rhythm Plague.

According to their traditions, the word in ker in Sindhi means a dreadful sin. Their ancestor Mania came to Kutch in the thirteenth century.

They have three sub-divisions, the Mamda, Manai and Mode, all of which have equal status. The Ker are endogamous, but do on occasion marry into other Samma communities such as the Aboda, Darad, Mandra, Mokhaji and Padiar. Historically, there were cases of intermarriage with the Hindu Jadeja community, but this custom has ended. The Ker are pastoral Maldhari nomads, raising buffaloes, cows and sheep, and graze these in the Banni region. They also sell milk to Bhuj. They often migrate to Saurashtra to graze their cattle.

It was briefly raised in 1912 as a Militia formation providing training as part of the compulsory training scheme. Later, during World War II, the brigade was raised as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force in April 1940. Assigned to the 8th Division, in early 1941 the brigade was deployed to British Malaya where it formed part of the defensive garrison that was established there by the British, eventually establishing its headquarters in the Mersing‚ÄìEndau area. In early 1942, following the Japanese invasion of Malaya, the brigade participated in the Malayan Campaign, fighting along the eastern coast before being forced to withdraw to Singapore as the Japanese advanced along the Malayan peninsula. The brigade later fought in the Battle of Singapore. Occupying the north-western sector of the island, the brigade was subjected to the weight of the main Japanese assault on 8/9 February 1942 and after heavy fighting was pushed back towards the centre of the island. Further actions were fought throughout the following week as Allied forces withdrew towards Singapore town. On 15 February, the garrison surrendered and the surviving members of the 22nd Brigade were captured. They spent the next three-and-a-half years in Japanese captivity in camps across south-east Asia and Japan, during which many died from the harsh conditions. At war's end in August 1945, the surviving members were liberated and returned to Australia. History The 22nd Brigade briefly existed as Militia brigade that was partially formed in 1912, following the introduction of the compulsory training scheme. At this time, it was assigned to the 5th Military District. The brigade's constituent units were spread across various locations in Western Australia including Fremantle, Victoria Park, Bunbury, Cottesloe, Subiaco, Perth, Guildford and Geraldton. The brigade's battalions were sequentially numbered: 86th, 87th, 88th and 89th. The brigade was not raised as part of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during World War I, although it remained on the Australian Army's order of battle as a Militia formation in Australia during the war. It was not re-raised in the interwar years when the Militia was reorganised to replicate the numerical designations of the AIF in 1921. During World War II, the 22nd Brigade was re-raised as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force. Established on 15 July 1940 as part of the 8th Australian Division, the brigade's headquarters was opened at Wallgrove, New South Wales. Under the command of Brigadier Harold Taylor, the brigade consisted of three infantry battalions ‚Äì the 2/18th, 2/19th and 2/20th ‚Äì and was supported by the 2/10th Field Regiment, which was initially equipped with World War I-vintage Ordnance QF 18-pounders. In August, after basic training was completed, the brigade concentrated around Ingleburn to begin more involved collective training. A further move to Bathurst in November 1940. Following a request from the British government, the 22nd Brigade, along with support troops ‚Äì a force of over 5,000 personnel ‚Äì were deployed to Malaya in February 1941, as the likelihood of war with Japan grew. Upon arrival, the brigade was deployed as a reserve element, and was based around Port Dickson, Kuala Lumpur and Malacca. Initially, it was planned to relieve the brigade after a few months, so that it could be redeployed to the Middle East, but this did not happen and ultimately the brigade was reinforced by the 27th Brigade. After this, the 22nd Brigade was released from the reserve role, as the 8th Division was allocated to the defence of eastern Johore, and the brigade subsequently moved to Jemaluang in August. The following month, forward positions were occupied around Mersing and Endau where the brigade began constructing fixed defences along the coast around potential landing areas. Members of the 22nd Brigade on board a ferry at Sydney, New South Wales, bound for the ship assigned to transport them to Malaya When the Japanese invasion of Malaya began on 8 December 1941, the brigade was initially out of the action, as the fighting took place in other sectors. In mid-January 1942, the brigade was placed under the command of the Indian III Corps, as the 8th Division's headquarters assumed control of actions and units along the western coast of Malaya, assuming the designation \\"Westforce\\", while the eastern forces came under 22nd Brigade as \\"Eastforce\\", assuming control of a battalion of Dogras and Jats as well as elements of the local Johore state forces. As the fighting intensified in the west, the 2/19th Battalion was detached from the 22nd Brigade to take part in the Battle of Muar, during which its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Anderson, led an ad hoc force of Australian and Indian soldiers in a fighting withdrawal. For his actions, he was later awarded the Victoria Cross. This led to the redeployment of the 2/18th Battalion to the Nithsdale Estate, while the 2/20th remained around Mersing, where they subsequently fought several minor actions against the advancing Japanese before a larger action took place around the Mersing River as the battalion fought to retain control of the vital road bridge. Ultimately, the Japanese gained the bridge and the brigade was ordered to withdraw to Jamaluang. Following a Japanese landing around Endau, the 2/18th Battalion carried out a successful ambush around Nithsdale, although this was followed by a further withdrawal to the crossroads around Kota Tinggi. The 2/19th returned to the 22nd Brigade at this time, and it was joined by the 2nd Battalion, Gordon Highlanders. Together they subsequently took up rearguard positions north of the causeway that led to Singapore, and held the line until 1 February, when they withdrew just before engineers blew up a large span to delay the advancing Japanese. On Singapore, the Australians were reinforced by elements of the newly arrived 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion, while the 2/19th received a large batch of barely trained recruits who had been hastily deployed from depots in Australia. Amidst hasty preparations for the defence of the island, the 22nd Brigade assumed defensive positions in the north-western sector of the island. Here their lines were longer than normal, and interspersed with mangroves and swamps that made the ground difficult to defend. After only a brief interlude, the Japanese began their assault on Singapore on the night of 8/9 February, with two division's crossing the Johore Strait and landing in the 22nd Brigade's area. Throughout the night, heavy fighting took place during the Battle of Sarimbun Beach as the Japanese infiltrated the sector, bypassing outposts that became isolated and cutting off many of the defenders. Subsequently, the surviving members of the three 22nd Brigade battalions fell back towards the airfield at Tengah. Further fighting took place around Bulim, where the 2/18th fought a delaying action along with remnants of the 2/19th and 2/20th Battalions, which were hastily reorganised as \\"Merritt Force\\". By 10 February, the 22nd Brigade had been pushed back to Ulu Pandan. Here, several ad hoc battalions were joined together and reorganised for a counter-attack, although this ultimately did not come to fruition as the tempo of the Japanese advance disrupted and dislocated the defending troops. A further withdrawal followed after the Japanese destroyed one of the assembling ad hoc battalions. As the Allied perimeter continued shrink around the town, the 8th Division units were brought together around Tanglin Barracks, where they remained until the garrison surrendered on 15 February. In the final stages of the fighting, Taylor was relieved of command due to exhaustion, with the commander of the 2/18th Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Varley, being promoted to brigadier. In the aftermath, the 22nd Brigade's surviving personnel were taken prisoner and subsequently sent to camps around south-east Asia and Japan. Conditions were harsh and many of the soldiers died in captivity before the survivors were liberated when the war ended in August 1945.

History Early European settlers in Buccan were James Williamson and his brother-in-law Mr A. Fraser who selected land south of Bethania in about 1863. They attempted to grow cotton but had problems with bollworm. However, sugar cane was successfully grown in the district. One of the largest sugar cane plantations in the area was on the land which is Newstead Park today (beside the Logan River). Dairying was also an important farm industry. Buccan railway station () was on the disused Beaudesert railway line from Bethania to Beaudesert. The line opened on 21 September 1885. Once part of the Shire of Beaudesert, Buccan became part of Logan City in the local government amalgamations of 2008. In the 2011 census, Buccan had a population of 1,575 people. Geography Buccan is a low density semi-rural suburb with larger acreage bushland type blocks. Buccan does not have a formalised town centre or shopping facilities with its residents relying on Logan Village, Waterford and Beenleigh to access such services.

It consisted of two detailed modification groups: significant electrical rewiring upgrade, and heavy aircraft maintenance and IRAN (inspect and repair as necessary) upgrade. These upgrades began in 1962.Baughers F-100F History Rewiring upgrade operation consisted of replacing old wiring and harnesses with improved maintainable designs while heavy maintenance and IRAN included new kits, modifications, standardized configurations, repairs, replacements and complete refurbishment.  F-100Cs  :Source: USAF F-100C Super Sabre - Flight Manual - Technical Order Upgrades T.O. 1F-100C(I)-1S-65 2 February 1971 The F-100Cs first saw action in March 1954 before officially entering USAF service on 14 July 1955 with the 450th Fighter Wing, Foster AFB. The aircraft was known for its efficacy as a platform for nuclear toss bombing due to its high top speed, although it shared a number of flaws with the F-100As. Key changes introduced by the modification program included changes in maintenance procedures, major wiring harnesses, IRANi upgrade, and additional avionics. By 1968, Project High Wire implemented the following upgrades: * Improved nose gear ground safety lock instructions * Improved use of . drop tanks and installation on outboard pylons * Restriction on takeoff with partially filled . drop tanks * Improved use of braking system with thermal expansion after high altitudes to prevent excessive pressures and system failures. * Improve instructions on all ejection seat systems at low altitude bailouts The modernization programme adopted in 1970 involved 3 simultaneous operations: an electrical rewiring operation, and a heavy maintenance improvements and IRAN operations.

The University was created by virtue of the Fiji National University Act 2009 which amalgamated six government higher education colleges: # Fiji School of Medicine (est. 1885) # Fiji School of Nursing (est. 1893) # Fiji College of Advanced Education (est. 1947) # Fiji College of Agriculture (est. 1954) # Fiji Institute of Technology (est. 1963) # Lautoka Teachers‚Äô College (est. 1978). See History below for more details of the founding colleges. In addition to the six founding colleges, the Training and Productivity Authority of Fiji (est. 1973) also became part of the new University. Following the creation of the University, the organisation structure was rationalised into five colleges and one national centre: # College of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry # College of Business, Hospitality and Tourism Studies # College of Engineering, Science and Technology # College of Humanities and Education # College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences National Training and Productivity Centre. By 2019, student numbers at the University had grown to almost 27,000. While each of the colleges has its own campus, the University also has two out-reach campuses in Ba and Labasa, which offer a range of programmes from different colleges, supported by distance learning, to broaden access to higher education across the country. In addition, the National Training and Productivity Centre has a national network of smaller training campuses in Suva, Nadi and Lautoka. The University is part of Australia's Academic and Research Network (AARNet), the company that provide internet services to the Australian education and research communities and their research partners. This has allowed the University to have superfast broadband, which is available to students 24/7 from anywhere on our campuses in partnership with DigitalFIJI. Books and journals have been replaced by digital collections and our libraries have been transformed into modern ‚Äúsocial learning commons‚Äù where students can work alone or in groups, accessing a wealth of learning materials virtually. The University has also invested heavily, with generous financial support from the Fiji Government, in upgrading its facilities and constructing new state-of-the-art buildings. To mark the 10th anniversary, Fiji National University will be opening a new ‚Äúgreen field‚Äù campus in Labasa, a new gymnasium complex and a new four-storey business school at our Nasinu Campus and a new three-storey teaching building at Fiji Maritime Academy. In parallel, a major programme of renovations will see all the University's halls of residences and catering facilities upgraded by 2020. History Although it was formally established in 2010, Fiji National University has a long history of relevant education dating back to the origins of its component Colleges, through institutions that were established according to national needs and aspirations as these developed. In 2016, Fiji National University appointed Prof. Ilisoni Wainiqolo from Simla Lautoka as its Vice Chancellor. Fiji School of Medicine The College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences is located at a number of centres around Suva, including the new Pasifika Campus opposite the Colonial War Memorial Hospital. The Fiji School of Medicine is now part of the FNU College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences. The former Fiji School of Medicine was originally established in 1885 as the Suva Medical School to train vaccinators. The School now provides training in most health science disciplines including medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, physiotherapy, radiography, laboratory technology, public health, health services management, dietetics and environmental health. Fiji School of Nursing The former Fiji School of Nursing is one of the oldest nursing education institutions in the Pacific and has been in existence since 1893. Now part of the FNU College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Science, the School offers basic and post- basic nursing programmes for Fiji and regional students. Graduates are capable of working in general health services, maternal and child health care service, mental health service, and, in urban, rural and remote community health services. The merger of the Fiji School of Medicine and the Fiji School of Nursing into the Fiji National University saw the creation of five schools under the College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences: the School of Health Sciences; the School of Oral Health; the School of Medical Sciences; the School of Public Health and Primary Care and School of Nursing. Fiji Institute of Technology The former Fiji Institute of Technology (FIT) is now part of the FNU College of Engineering, Science and Technology and is the University's Samabula Campus. It was originally established in 1963 to train students in technical and vocational disciplines, to meet the engineering human resource needs of Fiji. The College provides education to cater for the total human resource needs of Fiji and the South Pacific in the areas of engineering, technology, including information technology and electronics, marine training and in the sciences. The then FIT was also a starting point for the College of Business, Hospitality and Tourism Studies, which is now also located in a number of different centres, including the new Nadi Campus in the heart of Fiji's tourism industry The main administration centre of Fiji National University, including the hub of its extensive teacher training faculty, is located at what was once Fiji's prestigious Queen Victoria School (known as \\"Vuli-Ni-Tu\\"), established at Nasinu in 1907. In 1947, the school was relocated to Matavatucou, Tailevu Province, and the facilities were used to establish the Nasinu Teachers College, a primary teacher training institution. In 1982, it underwent some changes and re-opened as the Nasinu Residential College for students. In the 1990s, an Australian aid programme helped establish training for secondary teachers and in 1992 the Fiji College of Advanced Education opened at the Nasinu site. Lautoka Teachers College Meanwhile, the Lautoka Teachers College was established in 1978 as the country's largest pre-service provider of primary teachers and recently secondary school teachers also. This has become part of the University's College of Humanities and Education and is now the FNU Lautoka Campus with some of the proams also being offered in Suva, Nasinu Campus. The Humanities Department of this College, including its remarkable and widely known music section, is based on the Raiwai Campus (UniStudio) in Suva. Fiji College of Agriculture The Fiji College of Agriculture was established in 1954 to meet the human resource needs of the country in all areas of agriculture. That College was further developed into the University's College of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on the Koronivia Campus. It places great emphasis on research in agriculture. It is now formally known as the College of Agriculture, Fisheries & Forestry (CAFF). Training and Productivity Authority of Fiji (TPAF) The National Training and Productivity Centre (NTPC), formerly known as the Training and Productivity Authority of Fiji (TPAF) and the Fiji National Training Council, was established in 1973 by the Fiji National Training Act. It established the National Qualifications Framework to benchmark training and qualifications in technical and trade areas against a national standard, based on the needs of local industries, and iscomparable with overseas qualifications. TPAF became part of FNU in 2011 as the National Training and Productivity Centre (NTPC) to run the University's short courses in areas ranging from senior executive level management and leadership to innovative technical courses specifically designed for local conditions. Colleges The Fiji National University comprises 5 colleges spread throughout the country. The university has 15 libraries around Fiji. The College of Medicine, Nursing & Health Sciences contains the Fiji School of Medicine and the Fiji School of Nursing. The College of Business, Hospitality & Tourism Studies has business degree programmes which are nationally accredited. The College's programmes are all vetted by the relevant Industry Advisory Committees before being approved by the University's Senate. Accreditation for some programmes such as Accounting is also provided by the professional body, the Fiji Institute of Accountants. Currently FNU has programmes in two streams, the Technical & Vocational Education Training Stream and the Higher Education Stream. With the aim to take education closer to the community, FNU programmes particularly in Accounting, Economics, Computing Science and others, are all offered via 5 campuses around Fiji including Nadi, Lautoka, Ba and Labasa. FNU is currently rolling out postgraduate programmes on a number of commerce subjects. The College of Humanities & Education contains the School of Social Sciences, and the School Of Education. After the merger in 2010, the School of Education modified its teacher training curriculum. The main campus for teacher training is located in Lautoka with specific programs available in other parts of the country as well. The College of Engineering, Science & Technology offers a variety of academic programmes of study, with the Samabula Campus hosting most of the programs. The College of Agriculture, Fisheries & Forestry is connected to a number of other public and private national institutions with whom it collaborates in training, research and community service. Currently all CAFF programs are offered at the Koronivia Campus, in Koronivia, Nausori.

Gopi is a petty thief and has stolen a very precious chain belonging to the Spanish Queen, from a Museum and is on the run. While on the run, Gopi meets Veena (Bhavna Pani). Veena is on her way to break the marriage of her lover Felix (Mithun Ramesh) to a tycoon's daughter. Due to fear of getting caught, Gopi hides the chain in Veena's bag but later discovers with the help of his Friend Mani (Kalabhavan Mani) that it is missing. Gopi suspects that the chain is still with Veena and so he runs away from the police and follows her in her train journey. Their journey comes to a halt when Gopi is forced to jump off the train, because of Veena who had gone to get some water and hence misses the train. Veena realises that the place was Gopi's hometown. Subsequently he is needlessly beaten by his wicked elder brother (Baiju) and this leads to a fight. When Gopi's elder sister (Sona Nair) learns that he is in town, she comes and informs him that his younger sister's marriage is fixed. Veena's opinion of Gopi changes when she realises the reason why he became a thief. Gopi calls off his younger sister's marriage when he realised that there was a catch in it. His elder brothers were greedy of the family wealth and fixed the young girl's marriage with an unmarried and uneducated but rich old man. Gopi promises his sisters and their ailing bed-ridden father (Kalamandalam Kesavan) that he will find a better groom for his sister and he just needs more time. However he is unable to find the precious chain from Veena's bag. Astonishingly, Veena is seen possessing the chain and asks Gopi to accompany her in her goal if he wants the chain. In order to fulfill his promises, Gopi sets off to find some money to fund his sister's wedding and to regain all the lost family properties. At the same Mani escapes the town with his lover and all of them meet up. The four of them stay at the hotel in Mysore where Veena's lover Felix and family are staying and plans to get engaged. Felix's father, Mathew 'Mathachan' (Innocent) has cheque bounces and needs a large amount of money to pay them off. The bride's father, Fernandez (Janardhanan) agrees to give the money (without knowing of cases pending against Mathachan) and also arranges rooms for all the guests. At the same time Mathachan's clever second wife Swarnamma (Bindu Panicker) plans to elope with a con man. Another guest, Hamza Koya (Mamukoya) who is separated from his wife, books a room under a false name, to acquaint with another woman. His brother in law hires a professional killer Paasha (Jagathy Sreekumar) to kill Koya. Yet another guest is a retired DIG of Police, Tom Uncle (Nedumudi Venu) who is Fernandez's brother in law. Gopi assigns Mani to meet a dealer's aide to sell the chain. Mani tells the man that he would be holding a rose flower as an identification. But the plans go awry as Kurup (Cochin Haneefa) who is Mani's lover's father, arrives with his henchmen in search of his daughter. Mani is chased into Mathachan's room by Kurup and his men and hides in a wardrobe, while Kurup lands in trouble after mistakingly entering Tom uncle's room and disturbing his wife (Sukumari). Mathachan locks the wardrobe putting his mobile phone into it. Mani informs Gopi about the mishap. Gopi after spotting Kurup who was holding the rose flower, mistakes him into being a dealer and fixes a deal with him. There is a comical chaotic confusion as Kurup's daughter's name is Maala, and Gopi refers to the chain as 'Maala' (in Malayalam) as well. Paasha gets a courier holding the photo of the man (Koya) he is assigned to kill. Felix spots Veena and reports it to his dad. Mathchan goes in search of Veena after knowing the colour of her dress. He accidentally bumps into Paasha. Unfortunately, Mathachan had a photograph of himself and Fernandez with him. Paasha who is unable to see without specs, switches Koya's photo with Fernandez's photo. At the hotel reception, a lady (Geeta Vijayan), who is actually a prostitute, arrives and Mathachan mistakes her to be Veena as she is also wearing the same-coloured dress. This is the same lady whom Koya is supposed to meet. Paasha while going back to his room, bumps into a rose plant and tries to arrange it properly albeit proper vision. Now, the actual dealer of the chain- Abdullah (Kollam Ajith) arrives and spots Paasha holding the flower. Both of them fix a deal and Paasha is paid money. There is an unknown confusion as Paasha was asked by his boss to snatch Koya's chain after the murder. Abdullah mistakes Paasha to be talking of the one stolen by Gopi. Mani informs Gopi that he is stuck in a wardrobe and before he can specify the room, the phone charge is exhausted. Gopi request a waiter (Jagadeesh) to get Mani out somehow. Meanwhile, Paasha is now trying to kill Fernandez. Mathachan deals with the new lady who mistakes him to be Koya's man. Fernandez asks Tom Uncle to give some money to Mathachan while Mathachan asks Tom Uncle to give some of it to the lady. A Sub Inspector, Lambodaran (Spadikam George) is staying in the hotel to get hold of Mathachan albeit not knowing his identity. Mathachan's wife Swarnamma mistakes Koya as Uncle Tom and asks him to come to her room. Koya who obviously misinterprets her, tries to molest her thereby spreading news that Uncle Tom tried to molest Mathachan's wife. At the same time, the other lady, after mistaking Uncle Tom to be Koya, tries to seduce him and later hides in his wardrobe. The waiter finds out the lady after trying to search the wardrobe. The two incidents tarnish the image of poor Tom and he is resented by his wife and other family members. After a wedding party, Paasha goes unconscious after falling into his own trap set for Fernandez. SI Lambodaran gets Mathachan's room number and goes there only to find Mani inside the wardrobe. Mani is chased by the SI as well as Kurup. Mani runs into Paasha's room while Kurup backs off after Uncle Tom spots him. Felix wants to settle his differences with Veena and goes to the con lady's room by mistake. After Mathachan reveals that Felix had a previous relationship with 'Veena' (while pointing to the other lady), Fernandez loses his impression of the family and decides to call off the marriage and also starts trusting Uncle Tom. Gopi wishes to hand the chain to a dealer named Freddy and asks Veena to face him. But Freddy is caught by police and the senior officer who was behind Gopi confronts her. She doesn't give the chain back initially, but later pleads with the officer to spare the innocent Gopi's life, as Gopi had once saved the police officer's son's life from a fatal accident. She also decides to give her own money entrusted by her father, to Gopi under the name of the chain. SI Lambodaran gets hold of Paasha trying to kill Fernandez, and shows him the photograph thereby making it clear that Mathachan had assigned him to kill Fernandez. There is great confusion among Paasha, Kurup, Mathachan, Koya and the SI regarding the various deals of 'Maala'. During the chaos, Fernandez's daughter is mistaken as Kurup's daughter and thereby kidnapped by Kurup's henchmen. Mani and Gopi understand the whole mayhem and flee the hotel. Mathachan's wife elopes, and Koya, whose money was taken away by Mathachan's wife, follows them. The entire group of people along with the two families arrive at a factory space near the hotel and a hell lot of funny confusions cause a series of comical fights, chaos, and melee, finally leading to a hilarious electric shock. In the end Veena gives the agreed money to Gopi. However, the police officer reveals to Gopi that the chain is still with him and that Veena had pleaded to avoid a case in Gopi's name. Gopi had talked to Felix about Veena and how much she loves him. He promises Felix a large sum of money which he will pay off from the necklace's price. He does not reveal this to Veena. However Veena comes to know of Gopi's sacrifice for her despite having his own big problems. Veena calls off her wedding with Felix as she realises that he only longs for riches and does not love her at all. Gopi proposes to her and she agrees. The film ends with both of them setting off to start a new journey of their life. Cast *Dileep as Gopalakrishnan (Gopi) *Bhavna Pani as Veena *Kalabhavan Mani as Mani *Innocent as K. T.

Bloodline Champions won both \\"Game of the Year\\" and \\"Winner XNA\\" in the Swedish Game Awards 2009. The game officially launched in the United States on January 13, 2011. The spiritual successor to the game, Battlerite, created by the same developer Stunlock Studios, was released as a free-to-play game on November 7, 2017. The players in this game are split up into two teams (Warm and Cold) with up to five players per team. The objective is different depending on the game mode, ranging from team deathmatch and capture-the-flag to map point control. Gameplay There are four categories of bloodlines (character archetypes): melee attack, ranged attack, healer, and tank. There are currently 26 bloodlines, with six or seven in each category. Stunlock Studios have announced that they are working on new bloodlines. Each bloodline has seven abilities, two of which have an EX version, an enhanced version of the ability. Each has its own cooldown, as well as triggering short global cooldowns. The seventh ability is an \\"ultimate\\" ability that may only be used after gaining sufficient energy through executing other abilities successfully, such as healing allies, damaging enemies, and otherwise helping your team. Bloodlines also have HP (Health Points) - when the champion runs out of HP, the champion dies, removing it from combat until the end of the round. Each champion also has two items that grant additional abilities. The Bloodline Medallion allows a champion to recover an increasing amount of HP over a period of time and Resurrect revives nearby fallen teammates. Both items require a significant amount of uninterrupted time to prepare, which makes them impractical in immediate combat. In Conquest and Capture The Artifact modes resurrection skill has been replaced with warp skill that allows you to warp a short distance every 20 seconds. The controls in Bloodline Champions are similar to a first-person shooter, as the bloodline's movement is controlled using the W, A, S, and D keys. The primary two abilities are mapped to the left and right mouse buttons, and the rest of the abilities are used with the Q, E, R, F, and space keys. Almost all the abilities are aimed, where the direction of the ability is determined by the position of the cursor on the screen relative to the champion's position. There are two different camera modes; Free Look and Static. The static camera stays over the characters head at all times regardless of the location of the players cursor. The Free Look camera allows the player to control their camera with the cursor. A few defensive abilities are directed by hovering the cursor on the desired recipient, and some abilities target a specific location on the playing field. Bloodline Champions also features fog of war which represents the areas of the map which cannot be seen due to visual obstruction or distance. There are obstacles on the map which create fog of war and inhibit movement. Champions have their own collision, which can be used to inhibit movement and protect allies (for example a tank bloodline will have a larger collision size, making it easier to defend teammates by blocking fire, but also being more susceptible to focus fire). Bloodlines Bloodline Champions has 27 characters split into 4 archetypes: tank, ranged damage, melee damage, and healer. Tanks are generally close-quarters fighters and specialize in defense as well as peeling; removing pressure from allies by putting equal pressure on enemies. Ranged damage characters have lower health and deal high damage from a safe distance. They generally have many ways to escape melee combat but are taken down quickly if outmaneuvered. These bloodlines generally deal the most damage but must be in close range and have slightly higher health than ranged damage bloodlines. They tend to have very limited ways to control fights aside from their high damage output. Healers, as the title implies, keep their allies alive through a mix of powerful control and healing abilities. They have the lowest health of all bloodlines and generally lack mobility options other characters enjoy. Game modes Bloodline Champions has several game modes that provide different types of gameplay. The central game mode is Arena, as it is the only one available through matchmaking. =Arenas= Players can face an engaging challenge in competing in 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 arenas. =Capture the Artifact= The objective is to capture both artifacts and bring them back to your own base. Each team begins with one artifact in their base, and the first team to hold both artifacts for a period of time wins the round. The artifacts can be carried and thrown, but lifting one from its starting position takes time and can be interrupted by attacks. The carrier may drop the artifact by using certain abilities as well as receiving attacks by specific enemy abilities. When dropped, the artifact can be instantly picked up after it has sat for a short delay. =Conquest= In Conquest, the players have an infinite amount of respawns but the delay before respawning can increase with time. The teams battle for a number of capture points, and if one team holds all of them, the other team cannot respawn until they capture one of the capture points. To capture a point, the player must stay at that point for a period of time without taking damage or using abilities. The starting point provides a healing aura to the team that started there, and power rune pickups are distributed across the map, allowing champions to temporarily boost their capabilities. A team wins by either killing all the enemy champions while they cannot respawn, or holding the capture points for a set amount of time. In- game currencies Bloodline Champions is Free-to-Play (F2P). Bloodlines rotate every day, so there are always four available Bloodlines, one of each archetype. Players earn Blood Coins and spend them on additional Bloodlines, titles, avatars and other visual perks. None of the purchasable items give an edge in gameplay since there are no weapons with higher damage, for example, but they create more variety and choices in gameplay and appearance. Players can also choose to buy Funcom Points by using real money. Funcom Points serve the same purpose as Blood Coins, but they are bought using real currency instead of earned through in-game accomplishments. All marketplace items cost significantly less Funcom Points than Blood Coins. Reception Bloodline Champions received mainly favorable reviews from critics; on aggregate review website Metacritic the game attains an overall score of 79 out of 100. Strategy Informer gave BLC a score of 85% in their review, while PC Gamer gave 75%. Servers are located in Europe and USA; at this time there are no servers in Australia, South America, Africa, or Asia, but there is no area restriction whatsoever, so players in these regions are also able to play. At release Bloodline Champions announced their participation in DreamHack Summer a LAN tournament with BLC having a $10,000 US prize pool. This helped contribute to the games initial success as a competitive arena game. Since release BLC has had multiple cash prize tournaments hosted by DreamHack and GLHF.gg for a total of $11,600 prize money as of July 11, 2011.PGT Tournament Listings ReferencesExternal links * *Bloodline Champions at SGA's website Category:2011 video games Category:Action video games Category:Funcom games Category:Multiplayer video games Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Bloodline Champions"},{"id":"26550167","text":"Otto P√§cht (7 September 1902, Vienna - 17 April 1988, Vienna) was an Austrian art historian.  Life and work  P√§cht was born in Vienna on 7 September 1902 into a Jewish family. His father David P√§cht, a Jewish industrialist who owned a successful textile factory in Vienna, came from Bukovina, and his mother, n√©e Josefine Freundlich, from Vienna. P√§cht is one of the representatives of the 'New Viennese School of Art History'. He studied art history in Vienna (with Karl Maria Swoboda, Julius von Schlosser and Max Dvorak) and in Berlin (with Adolph Goldschmidt and Max Weber). In 1925 he received his doctorate with a dissertation on medieval painting (\\"Das Verh√§ltnis von Bild und Vorwurf in der mittelalterlichen Entwicklung der Historiendarstellung\\"), supervised by Julius von Schlosser. P√§cht was, alongside Hans Sedlmayr, one of the proponents of art-historical Strukturforschung, a key scholar of the so-called New Vienna School of Art History (an art-historical school involved in the reformulation of methodological approaches first advanced by Alois Riegl). Between 1926-1930 he co-edited the new serial \\"Kritische Berichte zur kunstgeschichtlichen Literatur\\" (founded by P√§cht and and in 1931 and 1933 edited the first (and only) two issues of \\"Kunstwissenschaftliche Forschungen\\" in collaboration with Sedlmayer). His doctoral dissertation (Habilitation) of 1932 was written on the painter Michael Pacher, supervised by August Grisebach (de), at Heidelberg. It was published 1933 as a short article in the journal Kunstwissenschaftliche Forschungen. With the rise of National Socialism in Germany in 1933, P√§cht's university post was revoked and he returned to Vienna. Shortly before the Anschluss, in 1936, P√§cht left Austria to accept an invitation by the Viennese George Furlong, Director of the National Gallery of Ireland. Gravesite of P√§cht at the Neustifter Friedhof in Vienna From 1937 until 1941, he lectured in London at the Courtauld Institute and Warburg Institute, whose director was the viennese Fritz Saxl. At Oxford University, he was entrusted with the cataloguing of the collection of manuscripts of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, which resulted in a 3-volume catalogue \\"Illuminated Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library\\", published in 1966, 1970 and 1973 together with his pupil J.J.G. Alexander. From 1945 he held an honorary lectureship in medieval art at Oriel College, and in 1950 was appointed fellower of the University.

He was born at Woolton, Liverpool and died at New Orleans, Louisiana. Bardswell was a right-handed batsman sometimes used as an opener and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. He was educated at Uppingham School where he was played mainly as a medium-pace bowler, and at Oriel College, Oxford. It was as a bowler that made his first-class debut for Oxford University on 21 May 1894. In his third game he took six Lancashire wickets for 36 runs in the county side's only innings of the match. His nine wickets in the next Oxford game, against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), included several Test match players. He was picked for the University match against Cambridge and took six for 76 in Cambridge's second innings to help Oxford to an eight-wicket victory. After nine matches for Oxford, he had taken 40 wickets at an average of just over 16 runs per wicket. He then played in a few matches for Lancashire when the university season was over, taking five catches in one match and four in another: Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote later that \\"among the short-slips of his day no one surpassed him\\". At the end of the 1894 English season, and before the University term began, Bardswell joined a team raised by Lord Hawke which toured North America and played two first-class matches. In the 1895 season he was in the Oxford University first team from the outset, and in the first game he opened the innings with Pelham Warner, scoring 69, more than double his previous highest first-class score of 32. His season was curtailed, however, by a hand injury after just four matches ‚Äì during which he had taken 11 wickets and 12 catches ‚Äì and he did not play again that summer. Bardswell returned to the Oxford team for the 1896 but after his hand injury he scarcely bowled at all: he took just two wickets in 1896 and another two in 1897, and did not bowl at all after that. Instead, he won a second Blue for his much-improved batting, mostly from the lower middle order, though he occasionally acted as an opening batsman; in the match against Surrey at The Oval he hit 97 and this was to be the highest score of his first-class career. Having been instrumental in the victory in his previous University Match in 1894 with his bowling, he was 33 not out when Oxford secured a dramatic victory by four wickets in the 1896 game against Cambridge, Oxford knocking off 330 to win after incurring a 117 deficit on first innings. Later in the season he again played for Lancashire; in his 16 first-class matches in 1896, he averaged 27.80 with the bat and took 32 catches. For the 1897 season, Bardswell was elected as captain of the Oxford University team. In the early part of the year, however, though notionally at Oxford, he took part in a three-month tour of the West Indies, again under the captaincy of Lord Hawke. He played in six first-class matches on the tour and scored well, taking in addition 18 catches. His captaincy at Oxford was not successful: the team was notably weaker than in his previous years and the University match was won decisively by Cambridge, though Bardswell top-scored in both Oxford innings. In 1898, Bardswell played only in a couple of first- class matches for MCC against the Universities, but at the start of the 1899 season he reappeared for Lancashire, playing as captain in the first six games of the season, but standing aside when Archie MacLaren resumed his cricket career in June. That was the end of Bardswell's first-class cricket career apart from one appearance for Lancashire in an end-of-season match in 1902, in which he was not at all successful. At the time of his death in December 1906, Bardswell was a committee member of MCC; he had had an operation earlier in the year, but his death in New Orleans was described as happening \\"very suddenly\\".

It works in tandem with the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol which is the lingua franca of electronic trading in the securities market.  Background  Prior to the mid-nineties, virtually all trading of securities was transacted over the phone, but with the advent of FIX, trading moved steadily over to electronic means. The FIX protocol is used to communicate between sell-side and the buy- side Order Management Systems (OMS) to exchange orders and order execution information without human intervention, using standardised messages and workflows that are defined by the protocol. Initially, sell-side firms only provided access to their 'trading desks' via FIX, which meant that once an order arrived at the sell-side broker, it was handled by a human trader, at least at the start of its lifecycle. Subsequently, sell-side firms started to offer direct access via FIX to the exchanges/markets they were members of; this is known as direct market access (DMA). At this time, many sell-side firms had their own proprietary systems to trade automatically in the market, using algorithmic trading strategies, and over time they began to see that offering access to these trading strategies to the buy-side was a way to attract business and increase revenue. Whilst FIX is an extensible protocol, there were two challenges that arose as a result of sell-side firms offering access to their algorithmic trading strategies via FIX. The first was that each sell-side strategy had its own parameters that had to be included as part of the order, so every firm ended up requiring a different set of fields (known in FIX as \\"tags\\") to be included in the FIX message. This made life very difficult for the buy-side, and more particularly for their suppliers as adding new algorithms to their trading systems and managing all the different combinations of tags became a significant overhead for their development operations. The second issue for the market was that each sell-side firm had a specific way they wanted their algorithms to be displayed on the buy-side OMS, with controls in the user interface arranged logically for easy order entry. Again this proved a challenge for the buy-side systems vendors, as each new screen for each sell-side broker required dedicated development and testing effort.  History  To tackle these issues, FIX Protocol Limited established the Algorithmic Trading Working Group in Q3 2004.Algorithmic Trading & FIX: Extending the Reach of FIX, FPL, November 2004: http://www.jandj.com/presentations/wednesday/AlgoTradingFIX.pdf The initial focus of the group was to solve the first of these issues, which it did by defining a new group of fields, the StrategyParametersGrp, made up of FIX tags 957 through 960 ‚Äì these tags were formally introduced with the release of FIX 5.0 in Q4 2006. By allowing sell-side firms to include their proprietary fields in a repeating name-value pair structure, there was no requirement for OMS vendors to define specific FIX message structures for each sell-side trading destination. This solution was not broadly adopted, in part because of the limited penetration of FIX 5.0 and in part due to the fact that firms already had working implementations in the market place that they were unwilling to change without good cause. Perhaps more importantly, it failed to solve what was the more substantial issue for the market, the complexity for the buy-side vendors resulting from lack of standardisation. The idea of using an XML structure to describe the presentation of algorithm user interfaces and their accompanying parameters was firstly suggested within the working group by Daniel Clayden, then of JP Morgan Chase in a 2005 forum posting.Daniel Clayden‚Äôs original post on the concept of what became FIXatdl: http://www.fixprotocol.org/discuss/read/d3b2124e Members of the working group developed this idea during 2006 and in January 2007 invited broader industry participation at a workshop to review their ideas.FPL Call for Participation, January 2007: http://www.fixprotocol.org/documents/1994/Algo%20workshop%20details_20070108.doc A specification was eventually produced and this began beta testing in July 2007.FPL Announces FIX Algorithmic Trading Definition Language Enters Beta Phase, Automated Trading, July 2007: http://www.automatedtrader.net/news/algorithmic-trading-news/756/fpl- announces-fix-algorithmic-trading-definition-language-enters-beta-phase This specification became FIXatdl 1.0 which was approved by the FPL Global Technical Committee (GTC) on March 28, 2008. Despite some initial enthusiasm, overall Version 1.0 had a lacklustre reception by the marketplace. Some vendors saw an opportunity to provide services around the standard, such as ULLINK (now part of Itiviti) with their algorithm publication and management and tool UL AMS but whilst the major OMS vendors were irritated by the overhead of implementing new broker algorithms, they had grown to enjoy the revenue that they could command from both their customers and from brokers keen to get their algorithms onto buy-side desks. Although Version 1.0 was a major step forward, it had some significant limitations. In particular, the definition of the data to be transmitted and its presentation on the user interface were tightly bound together, limiting the flexibility sell-side brokers had in defining their algorithms. The 1.0 specification also afforded insufficient control in terms of user interface layouts. The working group set out to address these limitations in what was to become Version 1.1 on the specification. The first major change was to split the definition of the data content from the presentation, defining what is referred to as a separate \\"Data Contract\\" made up of the algorithm parameters, their data types and supporting information such as minimum and maximum values. A separate section of the XML document is then concerned with the layout of the user interface, what controls to use for each parameter and where to place them on the screen. An XSD schema is provided to ensure that FIXatdl files are valid and well- formed. FIXatdl Version 1.1 was preliminarily approved by the GTC on February 9, 2010, when it entered a public comment period, and then finally approved on March 3, 2010. The specification was formally introduced to the market at the FPL‚Äôs Europe Middle East and Africa conference on March 23, 2010.FIXatdl on the FIX EMEA 2010 Protocol Conference agenda: http://fixprotocol.org/fplevents/emea_2010/program.html Some early work was undertaken on a Version 1.2Scope of Work for FIXatdl V1.2 https://www.fixtrading.org/packages/fixatdl-scope-of- work/?wpdmdl=53695&masterkey;=5cdeb86ec9a4a of the standard, but lack of industry interest in accommodating further changes meant the standard remained at Version 1.1.  Document structure  A FIXatdl document can contain one or more strategy definitions. Within a strategy definition, there are four main sections as follows: *Meta-data section defining which geographical regions, markets (exchanges) and asset classes the strategy is applicable to *Parameters section, listing out each of the parameters used by the strategy, their data types, constraints (e.g., minimum and maximum values) and how they should be represented in the resulting FIX message *StrategyLayout section which defines the user interface controls to be used for this strategy, how they should be laid out on the screen and how they map to the parameters described in the previous section of the document *StrategyEdit section which describes the validation rules to be applied ‚Äì typically these will be cross field validations FIXatdl documents should validate against the set of XSD schema provided by FPL. These schema are organised into the following four categories: *Core (defines data content, data types, constraints, etc.) *Layout (defines the controls that can be used and how they are laid out) *Validation (self-explanatory) *Flow (allows controls to be enabled/disabled, hidden/shown and updated, depending on the state or content of other controls)  User interface capabilities Strategy panels Version 1.1 supports 14 different user interface controls, which can be grouped as follows: *Labels *Text entry fields (often referred to as text boxes) *Checkboxes and radio buttons, both singly and in lists *Listboxes, both single and multi-selection *Dropdown lists, both editable and non-editable *Clock controls, for date/time entry *Sliders, for selecting one of a small number of settings *Numeric spinners, both single and double for integers and floating point numbers respectively Controls are laid out using a hierarchy of panels (referred to as StrategyPanels), each of which can be horizontal or vertical in orientation. The picture on the right shows how the XML elements refer to the individual panels within a given layout.  Adoption  Unlike the previous version, Version 1.1 was widely accepted and adopted by the securities industry. Even at the end of 2009, there were already firms using the 1.1 standard, despite its pre-release status. Examples of firms supporting the FIXatdl standard include: *RealTick Execution Management System, by Eze Software Group RealTick adds latest Deutsche Bank Algorithms: http://www.automatedtrader.net/news/ems- news/26664/realtick-adds-latest-deutsche-bank-algorithms *SimCorp Dimension's Order Manager ModuleNordea Investment Management goes live with new broker strategy functionality in SimCorp Dimension https://www.simcorp.com/en/news- and-announcements/2013/05/nordea-investment-management-goes-live-with-new- broker-strategy-functionality-in-simcorp-dimension *Itiviti, with their Algorithm Management System, UL AMS *The Portware Execution Management SystemPortware's adoption of FIXatdl: http://www.portware.com/flash/files/news/pressreleases/download/Portware%20FIXatdl%20FINAL.pdf *RapidAddition, with their FIXatdl editor *Assimilate Technology, with their Visual FIX product *Cornerstone Technology, with their FIXatdl Jump-Start packaged consulting service,Cornerstone Technology Helps Firms Accelerate FIXatdl Readiness http://www.prweb.com/releases/FIXatdl/jump- start/prweb3765284.htm public FIXatdl training workshopsCornerstone Technology Announces First Public FIXatdl Training Courses http://www.prweb.com/releases/FIXatdl/jump-start/prweb3765284.htm and free FIXatdl validation service, AtdlTools There are also open source Java and .NET implementations, atdl4j and Atdl4net respectively, which are both Version 1.1 compliant.  Other user interface standards  The question has often been asked, why doesn‚Äôt FIXatdl use an off-the-shelf user interface standard, such as Mozilla‚Äôs XUL, Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Presentation Foundation or Apache Flex? This is a valid question, but it seems that the authors of the specification wanted to maintain complete platform independence and adopting any one platform would risk damaging this proposition. Whilst lacking the degree of sophistication of some of these platforms, the current specification provides an acceptable degree of control in terms of user interface layout without being unduly restrictive. It remains to be seen how this design choice will pan out, and it does seem likely that further refinement of this part of the specification will be needed as adoption grows.

It was a vassal of the Shang state and its ruler was one of the Three Ducal Ministers appointed by Dixin of Shang, who is known pejoratively as King Zhou of Shang.Sima Qian Records of the Grand Historian ‚Ä¢ Yin (Shang) Annals (Âè≤ËÆ∞‚Ä¢ÊÆ∑Êú¨Á∫™) p19. E was originally located in the southern part of the modern province of Henan but later moved to Hubei. Its name is now used as the provincial abbreviation for Hubei. History There are a number of different theories about the origins of E, including that its original rulers were descended from the Baiyue or the Daxi culture. Another theory claims that during the Shang dynasty, descendants of the Yellow Emperor surnamed J√≠ () were granted land by Dixin around modern-day Xiangning County in Shanxi and that it became the original nucleus of E. In Chinese historical records, Dixin was said to have wanted to make the daughter of the Marquess of Jiu an imperial concubine but she was a dignified woman who regarded such a role as beneath her. In a fit of anger, Dixin murdered both the Marquess and his daughter and turned the marquess's body into mincemeat. The Marquess of E, protesting this injustice, renounced his vassalage but was also then murdered. Following the BCE establishment of the Western Zhou, the state of Jin moved into E's territory and forced its people to flee southward into the northern part of modern-day Nanyang, Henan. The relocation exposed them to the powerful southern state of Chu. By the middle of the Western Zhou, E had fled once again, settling east of present-day Ezhou in Hubei. E led a confederation of Southern Huaiyi tribes in a rebellion during the seventh year of the reign of King Yi of Zhou (863 BCE) and was destroyed by Zhou forces, permitting Chu to finally absorb the smaller state. Chu's ruler Xiong Qu conferred its former lands upon his son Xiong Zhi. The destruction of E was inscribed upon a bronze tripod cauldron, the Yu Ding. Xiong Zhi continued to live in E's capital after the death of his father, making it the de facto capital of Chu. Subsequent rulers remained there until Xiong E (r. 799-791 BCE) decided to reduce it to the status of an alternative capital. After Chu became an independent state in the Spring and Autumn period, King Gong of Chu (, r. 590‚Äì560 BCE) made his third son Lord of E. In the sixth year of the reign of King Huai of Chu (323 BCE), the king made his younger brother Xiong Qu the Lord of E. Following the destruction of Chu by Qin in 223, E became a county under the Qin and Han dynasties.

Later proposing ideological groundwork for separate Sindhi identity and laying the foundations of Sindhudesh movement. He is regarded as one of the founding fathers of modern Sindhi nationalism. G.M Syed started his political career at the age of 16, when he organised Khilafat Conference at his hometown, Sann, on 17 March 1920. Syed was one of the earliest Sindhi politician who sought the creation of Islamic Pakistan, and became a vocal supporter of the Two-Nation Theory, advocated by the Muslim League leader Mohammed Ali Jinnah; Syed's religious zeal for a purely Islamic state is witnessed after the Manzilgah incident, where he wanted to cleanse Sindh of its Hindus, stating: \\"all Hindus shall be driven out of Sindh like the Jews from Germany\\".https://books.google.ae/books?id=6hpuAAAAMAAJ&q;=Amidst+the+chaos+of+the+Manzilgah+incident+he+is+known+to+have+said,+%22all+Hindus+shall+be+driven+out+of+Sindh+like+the+Jews+from+Germany%22+(K.R.+Malkani+1984,+121).&dq;=Amidst+the+chaos+of+the+Manzilgah+incident+he+is+known+to+have+said,+%22all+Hindus+shall+be+driven+out+of+Sindh+like+the+Jews+from+Germany%22+(K.R.+Malkani+1984,+121).&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiojJ6a2bjqAhXdAGMBHW- jDbYQ6AEIJTAA However, once the independent nation was formed, he became the first political prisoner of the state in 1948. He restated the political implementation of Sufi ideologies which advocated for Islamic principles, secularism, Sindhi nationalism and laid the basis for Sindhudesh Movement. He spent approximately thirty years of his life in imprisonment and house arrests for opposing the anti-Sindh policies. He was entitled as the prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International in 1995. He died during his house arrest in Karachi on 26 April 1995.  Early life =Childhood: 1904‚Äì15 G.M. Syed was born to the Sadat family of Sindh in the town of Sann on 17 January 1904. Syed was an infant when his father Syed Mohammed Shah Kazmi was killed due to a family feud on 1 November 1905. After the death of his father, Syed was the only male infant in the family, therefore in 1906 the British Government took his family property in its custody and his family was given the monthly pension by the Court of Wards. He was admitted to a primary school at the age of six and completed his 5 years of primary education in Sindhi, in the year 1915. The female elders of his family and Mother Haneefa Bibi decided to home-school him in order to safeguard him from family feud and enmity as he was the only male heir in the family. He was taught Persian and English at home. Teenage: 1920‚Äì24 G.M Syed started his politics from participating in the Khilafat Movement. He first attended Khilafat Conference held on 7th, 8th, and 9 February 1920 in Larkana. He was inspired by the speeches of Abul Kalam Azad, Abdul Bari Firangi Mahali, Maulana Shaukat Ali and Shaikh Abdul Majeed Sindhi. He himself called upon the next Khilafat Conference on 17 March 1920 in his hometown Sann. Two days after this conference, his native town Sann observed a shutter-down strike in protest against the injustices of the Allied Powers against the Ottoman Caliphate on 20 March 1920. He remained active throughout the entire Khilafat Movement afterward. He addressed the Khilafat Conference held on 26 March 1920, in Makhdoom Bilawal's Mausoleum as the youngest speaker. He was of a short-height and stood upon a wooden chair to be visible to the audience during his speech. He met Mahatma Gandhi on 27 April 1921 at the Sann railway station while Mr. Gandhi was traveling from Dadu to Hyderabad. Gandhi instructed him to wear Khadi. Syed visited the office of the Collector in Karachi on 23 June 1921 to free his lands from the custody of Court of Wards but he was refused. He filed a complaint against the Collector and Mukhtiarkar on 4 December 1922, for hurdling the delivery of his lands from custody. Finally, he was awarded his lands back from the custody of Court of Wards in the year 1924, after two years of legal prosecution.  Political activism  Syed was the founder of Sindh Awami Mahaz, which went on to join the National Awami Party (National Peoples Party). Like Ibrahim Joyo, Syed blended Sindhi nationalism with Communism and Sufism through the ideas of Gandhi and Marx. Syed's position brought him ample opportunity to have free income through tributes, cash offerings and landed property. This lifestyle was rejected by him, subsequently he plunged into politics with enthusiasm. Politically, he evolved and traveled from Pan-Islamist to Indian nationalist and then Pakistani nationalist, having joined Muslim League; and ended with being a Sindhi nationalist.  AV School  In the early 1920s, Syed opened Anglo-Vernacular (AV) school in his village Sann, where education for certain language classes was free of cost. AV School offered combo of Sindhi education with English language. The school also offered options of Arabic, French and Persian languages. Prominent Sindhi educationist Ibrahim Joyo was also schooled at AV.

It was created in February 2009 for the 2010 U.S. Census. It tracks topics such as the constitutionality of including illegal immigrants in the census. History The group was created by Stephen Robert Morse, a journalist and filmmaker as a project to identify reasons why the 2010 U.S. Census would be a controversial process. As part of this process, Morse applied and won a grant through The Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship program from the Phillips Foundation. The award allowed Morse to continue his pet project. Morse first developed the idea as he was on Craigslist, looking for an additional job in San Francisco soon after college graduation, and noticed that the US Census Bureau was looking to hire employees in the Bay Area at the rate of $22-$26 per hour. After further research, Morse and University of Pennsylvania friend Evan Goldin created the group's website and blog, MyTwoCensus.com, in order to provide unofficial oversight for the U.S. Census Bureau. In March 2010, the site added a community message board operated through the social-networking site, Ning. Journalists from The Washington Post and CNN have cited MyTwoCensus in their reporting. http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/06/23/census.race.questions/index.html Activities The MyTwoCensus website reports on the handling of the census. MyTwoCensus is headed by two journalists: Morse and Goldin. Morse has said that he utilizes Google News, and attends census worker recruitment sessions in his reporting. In 2009, MyTwoCensus discovered that the U.S. Census Bureau had supposedly paid the delivery company FedEx several million dollars over time to mail documents that were not time-sensitive. The group publicized the findings after a census worker wrote to the website questioning the bureau's use of \\"priority overnight delivery.\\" The group has been critical of Census Bureau management, including Robert M. Groves the current Director of the United States Census Bureau, as well as both Republicans and Democrats for their handling of 2010 Census operations. MyTwoCensus has been mentioned in right-wing publications, such as that of conservative blogger Michelle Malkin.

It held that administrators have the clear power to deal with the company's property as is necessary if under the pressure of time before there is a creditors' meeting. Facts The two administrators of T&D; Industries plc (from PWC) wished to dispose of the company's assets before a creditors' meeting had taken place as required by the Insolvency Act 1986 s 24 (now Schedule B1, para 51). Section 17(2)(a) (now updated in schedule B1, para 1) contained the ambiguously worded provision that an administrator can manage the affairs, business and property of the company, Counsel for the administrators argued that this should be taken, on a first interpretation, to mean that the administrator could do anything, unless it was prohibited under the administration order for their appointment. Failing that, a second interpretation was that any disposal of the company's assets could be made, so long as the administrator had authorised it. Judgment Neuberger J held that court approval was not needed, and the proper interpretation of section 17(2)(a) was that the administrator could do anything, unless it was prohibited under the administration order for their appointment. This was so reading together with section 14(1) which empowered the administrator to do anything necessary for the company's management. Furthermore the policy of administration favoured expediency, and so section 14 could not be effectively operated, were it otherwise, without the court's sanction.

The first proper jumping hill was erected in around 1900, with jumps of up to 14 metres reportedly made on this hill. Ten years later, an additional 20-metre hill was constructed. In 1949, a K-90 normal hill was built at Puijo, which at the time was the largest hill in Finland. In 1958, a K-65 hill was added to the complex. The first World Cup competition to be held at Puijo was on 1 February 1995, on the K-90 hill. In 1998, a K-120 large hill was constructed and used for the first time on 4 March 1999. This hill has not been modified since, and remains in primary use for World Cup events. On 10 March 2015, the K-90 hill saw use again for the first time since 4 March 1998, due to strong winds cancelling the scheduled K-120 event. For a certain time, the first annual competition of the World Cup‚Äîthe so-called \\"Nordic Opening\\"‚Äîtook place at Puijo.

This eliminates the need for bridging communication protocols when services use different communication protocols.Matthew Dailey.Software Architecture Design Service Oriented Architectures (Part II) [Online].Date accessed: 25 April 2010. Rationale Services developed by different project teams could be based on different communication mechanisms. As a result, a service inventory may end up having different sets of services, each conforming to a different set of protocols. When it comes to reusing services having different communication protocols, some sort of communication bridging mechanism is required. For example, services developed using JMS messaging protocol are incompatible with services using .NET Remoting, so in order to make use of these two types of services, some middleware technology needs to be in place that bridges the communication protocol disparity. Apart from incurring extra cost, the use of such a bridging technology adds latency and communication overhead. This makes the service less of a reusable and a recomposableService Composition resource and goes against the guidelines of the Service Composability design principle. In order to design a service inventory where all services are interoperable with each other so that they can be composed into different solutions, the application of the Canonical Protocol pattern dictates standardizing the communication protocols used by the services. When all services are using the same communication protocol, the requirement for a bridging technology is eliminated and the communication between services is more streamlined.Mauro. et al. Service Oriented Device Integration - An Analysis of SOA Design Patterns. [Online], pp.1-10, 2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2010. Date accessed: 30 April 2010. Usage Diagram A Services developed using different communication protocols are unable to talk to each other. Diagram B Services developed using the same communication protocols are able to talk to each other and hence can be used in multiple service compositions. The application of this design pattern requires choosing a technology architecture that provides a common communication framework so that all services in an inventory can communicate with each other using the same communication protocol. This depends upon how the services within a service inventory are going to be used. If the services are only going to be part of service compositions that always use a particular communication protocol (because of efficiency and security reasons), then all the services within that service inventory can be built upon such a communication protocol even if it is not the most widely used protocol. The Canonical Protocol pattern by Thomas Erl answers the question: \\"How can services be designed to avoid protocol bridging?\\"SOA Patterns - Canonical Protocol The problem is that services that support different communication technologies compromise interoperability, limit the quantity of potential consumers, and introduce the need for undesirable protocol bridging measures. The solution is for the architecture to establish a single communications technology as the sole or primary medium by which services can interact. Therefore, the communication protocols (including protocol versions) used within a service inventory boundary are standardized for all services (see diagram). One of the most mature and widely used communication mechanisms is provided by the Web services framework. Further to choosing a communication framework, the actual message protocols also need to be standardized upon. For example, whether web services are built using SOAP over HTTP or by simply using RESTful services. Similarly, when standardizing on SOAP based web services, the specific version of SOAP protocol needs to be agreed upon as well i.e. SOAP v 1.1 or SOAP v 1.2. Considerations In order to standardize on a communication protocol, the features of the protocol need to be compared against the service interaction requirements including security, efficiency and transaction support. In case of web services, for example, if a service composition requires explicit transaction support, then SOAP over HTTP would be a better choice than using RESTful services. In some cases, depending upon the technology used to build the service, it may be possible to support two different set of protocols in order to make the service accessible to different types of service consumers (Dual Protocols design patternDual Protocols design pattern ). For example, using WCF, the same service can be configured to use HTTP and TCP/IP protocols at the same time. When choosing a communication framework, the maturity, scalability and any licensing costs need to be taken into account as building services using a protocol that is going to become obsolete in the near future will impact the reusability of such services and would require considerable time and efforts in order to redesign the service.

This is a collection of East India Company charts that lay hidden in England for three hundred years and came to the Maritime Museum in 2006 after being purchased for millions.  Maritime Museum Harbour  Maritime Museum Harbour A former attraction was the 19th-century ironclad ram ship HNLMS Buffel, which was moored outside of the museum. The ship was moved to Hellevoetsluis in 2013 (due to cost cuts) where it will be exploited by the Stichting Museumschip de Buffel to preserve this ship for the generations to come. The Maritime Museum Harbour includes the red cast iron Low Light of the Hook of Holland, which formerly stood at the entrance to the Nieuwe Waterweg (New Waterway). Furthermore, it includes a wide range of steam tugs, a steam driven sheerleg and the only working grain elevator in the world. A diverse range of historical inland vessels is also exposed here. Visitors are able to enter most of the ships. In the summer the Museum organizes cruises through the city of Rotterdam with these ships.  Professor Splash (Professor Plons)  In this exhibition children between 4 and 12 years old learn about the maritime world by playing. As they play, they learn all sorts of things about various types of ships, working in the port, navigation and how products such as their own toys are transported by ship from all over the world to the Netherlands.

He is the current Guinness World Record holder for most syllables rapped in one minute.http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/arts_and_media/music_feats_and_facts/fastest_rap_mc.aspx  Early life  Chojin was born in Torrej√≥n de Ardoz, Madrid, to a father from Equatorial Guinea and an Extremaduran (Spanish) mother. Career El Chojin takes his name from the Overfiend in the hentai anime Urotsukid≈çji. During the first part of his rap career, he was a member of the WFN crew (\\"Wild for da Night\\"), so called after a Rampage/Busta Rhymes song of the same name.Hip Hop Directo interview He was later part of the group 995 and with them released four albums. As a solo artist he has put out twelve LPs as of 2013, including Cuando Hay Obst√°culos... and ...Jam√°s Intentes Negarlo (the initials of those two titles spelling out C.H.O.J.I.N.). After his first five full-length solo records, in 2004 Chojin returned with a demo, Rap por placer, available as a free download. In early 2005, his eighth LP 8jin was released. The record tackles such issues as professionalism in rap and violence against women. The album cover was chosen from among almost 400 submissions, from a contest organized by the rapper through his webpage. In 2007 he released Striptease, an album in which he \\"bares\\" his soul. It is a collaboration with various producers, both veteran and new, and includes instrumentation such as guitars, harmonicas, pianos, and a gospel chorus. The following year he released A√∫n rap por placer, a follow-up to his previous demo, consisting of six solo tracks and one featuring Duo Kie. Like its predecessor, it could also be legally downloaded for free. In March 2009, he released Cosas que pasan, que no pasan y que deber√≠an pasar (Things that Happen, Don't Happen, and Should Happen), a 30-track album with a diverse array of contributors, including Locus from Duo Kie, Maika Sitt√© from blues band Red House, comedian El Gran Wyoming, and singer-songwriter Luis Eduardo Aute, as well as others. Chojin is known for the social commentary of his lyrics, his solo record Mi turno being perhaps his most \\"radical\\" work. He avoids coarse language in his music, and his raps also frequently espouse non-violence, anti-racism, and warn of the dangers of drugs and alcohol. One of the main themes covered on most albums is the discrimination against and general mistreatment of immigrants. Although, being born and raised in Spain, he is not an immigrant himself, he is well aware of the problems they face. As is reflected in his songs \\"Yo no soy de esos\\", \\"Mami, el negro est√° rabioso\\", and \\"Cara sucia\\", he has suffered such discrimination due to the colour of his skin. He also is known for his track \\"Lola\\", promoting condom use, which came to be used in a Barcelona contraceptive awareness campaign. Amnesty International used one of his songs (featuring Meko and Kraze Negroze) for their \\"Ponte en mi piel\\" (\\"Put Yourself in My Skin\\") campaign, another attempt to raise awareness, this time regarding immigration, and, with the release of 8jin, Amnesty selected \\"El final del cuento de hadas\\" (\\"The End of the Fairy Tale\\") for a campaign against gender-based violence. In addition to lyrics, Chojin has also written poetry and various articles. In 2007, he wrote and starred in El alma de Alexander Oboe (The Soul of Alexander Oboe), a play produced by Casa de los Pueblos, which debuted at the Festival Madrid Sur and went on to tour various theatres in Spain. While finishing and preparing for the launch of his first book, 98 rimas y 7 leyendas (98 Rhymes and 7 Legends), he has collaborated on movie soundtracks such as T√°nger and created what he calls \\"the first rap opera in Spanish\\", entitled Rimas para todos los p√∫blicos (Rhymes for All Audiences). Since 28 January 2010, El Chojin has appeared every Wednesday on Noticias 2, performing a rap summarizing the week's news.  World record  On 23 December 2008, El Chojin appeared on Telecinco in an attempt to break Rebel XD's record, but failed to rap more than 852 syllables within 42.2 seconds. El Chojin did however create his own separate record from Rebel XD, where he took 1 minute to rap 921 syllables, which came out to be 15 syllables per second on his song titled \\"Vo-ca-li-za\\". Rebel XD rapped 20 syllables per second. As of January 2015, no one has beaten the 852 syllables in 42 seconds record, or the 921 in 60 seconds record, except Outsider whose attempt did surpassed El Chojin by 2 syllables per second but wasn't accepted because he rapped in Korean.

The medieval building, which acquired its current appearance in the late 19th century, served military and intelligence purposes in World War II and during the Cold War. It was returned to its original representation purposes during the second half of the 20th century, and briefly became a business park for small information technology and internet companies in the early post-millennium years. Medieval time to 19th century Cransberg Castle around 1625 The original Kransberg castle was constructed around 1170, presumably based on a fortification that dates back to the 11th century. The first documented owner (in 1250) was Erwinus de Cranichesberc (Middle High German for Kranichsberg = crane mountain). In 1310 the castle was sold to Duke Philipp IV. von Falkenstein. It was inherited by the nobility of Eppstein in 1433, and briefly fell to the K√∂nigstein line in 1522 when Gottfried X. von Eppstein died. It passed on to the County of Stolberg in 1535, to the Archbishopric of Mainz in 1581, and was sold to the Waldbott von Bassenheim family in 1654. The castle fell into disrepair from the late 18th century onward until it was sold to the Duchy of Nassau in 1853. It fell to the state of Prussia in 1866 which in 1874 sold it to Arnold von Biegeleben, a Baron from Darmstadt who recreated and extended it in the neogothic style. Only parts of the outward fortifications and the central tower remained essentially unchanged. Third Reich Emma von Scheitlein, of Austrian nobility, acquired the castle in 1926 and used it for society events until the Nazi government appropriated it in 1939 and put it to military use. Remains of an alternate guard house to the Adlerhorst complex. Note the slooping roof and scale of the building, and the half demolished stone wall to the left end wall. This entrance complex was originally disguised to look like a Fachwerk (half-timbered) style wooden cottage Inside the Adlerhorst bunker under Kransberg Castle From 1939-1941 Albert Speer adapted it for use as Adolf Hitler's main military command headquarters, under the title Adlerhorst. A compound of air-raid standard concrete bunkers were disguised as seven cottages, under which was an extensive bunker complex which linked them to the castle. But on completion the complex was dismissed by Hitler on a visit in February 1940, and Speer subsequently adapted it to serve as the Luftwaffe headquarters during Operation Sea Lion, the invasion of Great Britain. (Some characteristic elements of Speer's architectural style are still apparent in 2010.) When plans for the invasion of Britain were abandoned in favor of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, Kransberg was put to use as a rehabilitation center for soldiers of all ranks, and as the personal retreat for Hermann G√∂ring.Ein dunkles Kapitel in der Geschichte des Schlosses (A Dark Chapter In The Castle's History). Usinger Anzeiger September 12, 2001 From October 1944, the castle and Adlerhorst had become the headquarters of the Commander in Chief of OB West, Gerd von Rundstedt. After the failed 20 July plot attempt on Hitler's life, and the abandonment of the Wolfsschanze due to the advances of the Red Army, Hitler needed a new military base of operations for the forthcoming Ardennes Offensive. Hitler arrived at Giessen on the F√ºhrersonderzug (train) on 11 December 1944, taking up residence at the castle until 16 January 1945. Von Rundstedt who was to command Operation Wacht am Rhein set up his headquarters near Limburg, close enough for the generals and Panzer Corps commanders who were to lead the attack to visit the castle that evening. Von Rundstedt ran through the plans, that at 05:00 on December 15, envisaged the attack of three German armies consisting of over 250,000 men. Shortly after Christmas, G√∂ring arrived and took up residence in the castle. After an extremely downbeat briefing, G√∂ring privately suggested to Hitler that a truce be sought via his Swedish contacts. Hitler flew into a rage, and after threatening to have G√∂ring put before a firing squad, mentally dismissed him as deputy Fuehrer. After giving his 1945 New Year's speech from the Adlerhorst, at 04:00 Hitler walked to the command centre to watch the development of Operation Nordwind, his counter-offensive on New Year's Day. At midnight, nine Panzer divisions of Heeresgruppe G commanded by Generaloberst Johannes Blaskowitz had mounted an all-out attack on Bastogne. Then a faked diversionary attack was mounted by eight German divisions of Army Group Upper Rhine (Heeresgruppe Oberrhein) commanded by Heinrich Himmler, against the thinly stretched line of the U.S. 7th Army and French 1st Army positions near Lembach in the Upper Vosges mountains in Alsace, to the southeast, to destroy them. However, as the Allies had cracked the Enigma code machines, each German manoeuvre was either prepared for or out-flanked by an allied counter-move. This resulted in a bitter attritional campaign that was lost from the 25th January onwards, by the German's running out of replacement manpower, machinery and supplies. On 6 January 1945, a blockbuster bomb was jettisoned on Ziegenberg by a returning Allied bomber, damaging the church and several houses, killing four residents. With the Ardennes Offensive failed, and no new military plans or the resources by which to carry them out, the German military high command accepted that the western front was lost. Hitler left on his train for East Prussia on January 16, 1945 to bolster the defenders, with the Soviets having already reached Danzig. Having been made commander of OB West on March 11, on March 17 Kesselring ordered all classified documents and sensitive equipment removed from the castle. On March 19 the castle and surrounding area was subject to a 45-minute fire bombing air raid by a squadron of P-51 Mustangs. This resulted in the loss of 10 civilian lives, and the castle plus many of the surrounding buildings being damaged, destroyed or set on fire. On March 28, with the American Army only away, Kesselring and his troops abandoned the castle complex. A U.S. Army unit took Kransberg Castle on March 30. During several months of 1945, the castle (code name Dustbin, from June on) https://books.google.ca/books?id=PcYTAwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA127&dq;=kransberg+castle+1945+Dustbin&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjW3KbQzYbbAhVKzoMKHbDYA3UQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q;=kransberg%20castle%20Dustbin&f;=false, p=127 was the Anglo-American interrogation center for Albert Speer and Hjalmar Schachthttps://books.google.ca/books?id=cS9zAwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA96&lpg;=PA96&dq;=1945+may+speer+kransberg+castle&source;=bl&ots;=ydpoBxWcM5&sig;=bsLqkHoyKY5YM6wmVNqS_gBqpTk&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwj0muj0-YXbAhWI2YMKHczUDWU4ChDoATABegQICBAB#v=onepage&q;=1945%20may%20speer%20kransberg%20castle&f;=false, p=95 as well as Wernher von Braun, Ferdinand Porsche and other technical, financial and industrial leaders.https://books.google.ca/books?id=n58KBgb8mz4C&pg;=PA233&lpg;=PA233&dq;=kransberg+castle+1945+speer&source;=bl&ots;=Hzk4QllV-O&sig;=Z0BCOPfZsyg0mWhazUvlAGtY4KE&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwini668-IXbAhUE8YMKHZokBpEQ6AEwEnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q;=kransberg%20castle%201945%20speer&f;=false, p=233 Cold War Fachwerk house in the Kransberg Castle complex Soon thereafter a British-American detention center, commonly referred to as Operation Dustbin, for high-ranking German non-military prisoners of war, was established in parts of the complex. Focused on key industrialists, scientists and economists, among those interrogated here were Hjalmar Schacht, Wernher von Braun, Ferdinand Porsche, and the leaders of the IG Farben chemical conglomerate. The highest-ranking of these persons of interest was Albert Speer, the minister for armaments and wartime production who was detained in one of the buildings which he had redesigned as Hitler's chief architect a few years earlier. During his detention between June and August 1945 he provided very open and detailed accounts of the inner workings of the Third Reich and the impact of Allied bombing of Germany. \\"Dustbin\\" remained in operation throughout 1946. In 1956 the Organisation Gehlen, the U.S.-German intelligence unit that later became the nucleus of the Bundesnachrichtendienst, moved in. It was later followed by the 5th U.S. Army Corps which operated an NCO academy, and by U.S. intelligence units which directed large parts of its espionage network in communist East Germany from here. Late 20th century to present In the wake of the German reunification, the U.S. Army left Kransberg Castle in 1990 and returned it to the German government which sold it to Ulrike Brandis, a granddaughter of the disenfranchised Emma von Scheitlein, in 1993. Once again the complex became a center of culture and societal events. The costs of operating and maintaining the castle forced Brandis to sell her real estate to Klaus Landefeld, an information technology entrepreneur, in 2000. He converted parts of the complex into a business park for IT companies, and initiated the architectural reconversion of those parts that had been disfigured during the period of military use. When Landefeld's business suffered an economic downturn after the dot-com bubble had burst, these efforts were stalled. In 2007 he was forced to cede ownership to a real estate management company, which terminated the remaining business park operation at the end of 2008. According to the company, which is seeking a buyer, some facilities at Kransberg castle will be reopened in 2010.

Known throughout most of its history as the Smithton Saints, the club competed in the North West Football Union in two different stints, from 1949 to 1951 and then 1980 to 1986, then in the NWFL since 1987. The club was based in the town of Smithton, and last competed as the Circular Head Giants from 2015 to 2019. On 19 February 2019 the club went into recess due to a lack of player numbers, and ultimately folded following an AGM held on 2 October 2019.https://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/5913857/player-number-woes-see- circular-head-giants-go-into-recess/ History=Leagues The club has participated in several Australian leagues, such as: * CHFA (1919‚Äì49, 1952‚Äì79) * NWFU (1950‚Äì51, 1980‚Äì86) * NTFL/NWFL (1987‚Äì2019) Identity The Smithton Football Club participated in the C.H.F.A. competition as the 'Magpies', wearing a jumper similar to that of the Collingwood Football Club. The Smithton Saints colours (red, white and black) and jumper design (similar to that of the St Kilda Football Club and almost identical to the jumper worn by the Forest-Stanley Under-17s prior to the two senior clubs, Forest and Stanley, merging) were instituted when for the very first time, a team from Circular Head was admitted to the N.W.F.U. in 1980. Three teams from Circular Head, Smithton (1949), Stanley (1950) and Forest (1951) participated in the N.W.F.U. finals from 1949 to 1951. The finals system in place in the N.W.F.U. over these three seasons involved the top 5 from the N.W.F.U. plus Advocate newspaper, several editions; personal participation the C.H.F.A. Premiers for that season. In North Western Tasmanian football in seasons 1947 and 1948, the C.H.F.A. Premiers (Stanley on each occasion) participated in a three-way tussle for the N.W. Coast Premiership with the respective winners of the N.W.F.U.'s Eastern and Western Divisions. In 2016, the club was rebranded, still known formally as the Smithton Football Club, but changing its playing and trading name from the Smithton Saints to the Circular Head Giants.http://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/3302756/reactions-mixed-as-saints- become-giants/?cs=88 The Smithton board had many years of discussions to change the identity, in an attempt to return the club to being a power in the North-West.

Along with the medal, they were also awarded \\"Best Mid-size Brewpub & Mid-size Brewpub Brewer of the Year.\\" History of the building Moon River Brewing Company is located in the former City Hotel. Elazer Early, a native of Charleston, South Carolina, built the City Hotel in 1821. Not only was it the first hotel in Savannah, but it was also home to the first branch of the United States Post Office in Savannah, as well as a branch of the Bank of the United States. Many notable people stayed at the City Hotel, including War of 1812 hero Winfield Scott, the Marquis de Lafayette, the first three commodores of the U.S. Navy and naturalist James Audubon. Audubon stayed six months while attempting to sell books full of his wildlife sketches. In 1851, Peter Wiltberger bought the City Hotel. He renovated it and put a live lion and lioness on display to draw attention to his business. City Hotel's final guest checked out in 1864, just before the arrival of General William Tecumseh Sherman during the Civil War and the subsequent closing of the City Hotel. At the turn of the century, the building was used as a lumber and coal warehouse. As the use of coal slowly died off, the building was used for general storage. In the 1960s, the space was renovated as an office supply store, complete with a large printing press. Hurricane David forced this business to close in 1979 when it blew the roof off the structure. The building sat empty until 1995 when it was renovated into its current configuration as a brew pub. Hauntings The building is alleged to be haunted, is a feature of local guided tours, and claimed by staff members to be a site of hauntings and poltergeist activity. Ghost hunters believe people who died during the city's yellow fever outbreak of 1876 haunt Moon River because they say building was used as a makeshift hospital during the epidemic. The building is claimed to be haunted by a 'Lady in White'. as well as the spirit of James Stark, a gambler who was killed in an altercation with a town physician Dr. Philip Minus while on the staircase of the old City Hotel in 1832. According to the TV show Ghost Adventures, contractors have had run-ins with Stark's spirit while trying to renovate the upper floors.https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/ghost-adventures/articles/moon- rivers-haunted-history In the media=Television In 2005, the brewery was featured in the Ghost Hunters Halloween special.

He murdered 4 females, 2 women and 2 girls between 1967 and 1968. Background When the killings began in 1967, Martin was employed at a textile mill in Cherokee County. He was married and had three children.  History and Victims  On May 20, 1967, 32-year-old Annie Lucille Dedmond was murdered. She had been strangled and raped. Her husband, Roger Dedmond, was arrested and convicted of her murder. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Nine months later in February, 1968, Nancy Carol Parris, 20, was abducted. Her husband had reported her missing when she had taken their dog for a walk at night and never returned. Her nude body was later found on a riverbank beneath a bridge. She had been strangled and raped. Nancy Christine Rhinehart, 14, was killed on February 8, 1968. Her body was found buried under a brush pile with one foot sticking out. She had been strangled and raped. On Feb. 8, 1968, Lee Roy Martin anonymously called Bill Gibbons, then-editor of The Gaffney Ledger. Martin gave Gibbons directions to locate two bodies. He insisted that he was responsible for the murder of Annie Dedmond, not her husband. Gibbons reported the information to police, who then found the bodies of Parris and Rhinehart. Four days later Martin contacted Gibbons again, warning that there would be more killings. On February 13, 1968, 15-year-old Opal Dianne Buckson was abducted and thrown in the trunk of a car while walking to a school bus stop with her sister. Her sister was able to give a description of the vehicle to authorities. Police found Buckson's nude body in a wooded area several days later. There were indications of a struggle and she had been strangled and stabbed to death. Investigation, arrest, and trial After learning of Opal Buckson's abduction on the morning of February 13, local residents Henry Transou and Lester Skinner were patrolling the area, looking for a car that matched the description given over the radio by local police. Within hours of the abduction, they saw a car backed down a dirt path in a heavily-wooded area and a man standing beside it. When they drove by, the man quickly got inside and drove away. They wrote down the vehicle's plate numbers and reported what they'd seen to police. Investigators later found Buckson's body nearby to where Martin's car had been spotted. Martin was arrested on February 27, 1968. The Sheriff took evidence from Martin and questioned him. Martin directed them to the location of bodies. However, in the process, Martin was not given adequate right to counsel, and so authorities did not seek the death penalty. Martin was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of Dedmond, Parris, Rhinehart, and Buckson. He received four life terms. After Martin's arrest, Roger Dedmond, who was three months into his prison sentence, was released from Union County Prison Camp on March 1, 1968. All charges against him in the murder of his wife were dropped. While the popular conception of Martin's motive was that he was \\"after young women,\\" in prison interviews and in discussions with his mother Martin himself said he had a split personality, including a violent side that took control of him. Aftermath On May 31, 1972, while incarcerated at Central Correctional Institution in Columbia, Martin was stabbed to death by fellow inmate Kenneth Marshall Rumsey. Rumsey later died by suicide in prison.  In popular culture  The case was the subject of the Season 3 premiere of Investigation Discovery's series A Crime to Remember in 2015 (\\"Lock Up Your Daughters\\").

As a reoccurring theme amid Du Bois‚Äô works, the Negro as a problem to those representing the majority population was a concept into which Du Bois sought to delve further as he explored what it meant to be a minority ‚Äì and an educated one ‚Äì among those who still viewed minorities as a nuisance to their culture or else a burden and creatures not belonging as one of their own. An introduction to another one of his familiar concepts - that of the black double-consciousness - the question of how it feels to be a problem is intended for Negro men and women to keep in the back of their minds. As people of conflicting identities of both Negro and American in a white American world, they should be constantly mindful of this while they discern how they fit in as citizens moving through a racially disconnected New World based on the outward perceptions of them from the white majority race. The focus of The Study of the Negro Problems is on the means of law enforcement used to separate blacks from their white counterparts and how social forces, as responses to the African slaves‚Äô introduction into America, forced these laws onto the slaves and their ancestors.

Raised as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force for service during World War II, the battalion formed part of the 23rd Brigade, attached to the 8th Division. It was captured by the Japanese during the Battle of Rabaul in 1942. After being captured, the battalion was not re-raised and a large number of its personnel died in captivity; those that did not were returned to Australia at the end of the war in 1945. History=Formation and training Formed on 1 July 1940 at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, the 2/22nd Battalion formed part of the 23rd Brigade, attached to the 8th Division. The battalion's personnel were drawn from the state of Victoria, and included a number of veterans of the World War I.. The colours chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 22nd Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were purple over red, in a diamond shape, although a border of gray in an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval border denoted that the battalion was an 8th Division unit. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies ‚Äì designated 'A' through to 'D' ‚Äì each consisting of three platoons. Shortly after being raised it moved to Trawool, Victoria, to undertake infantry training on 11 July. In September, the battalion was then required to march to Bonegilla,. arriving on 4 October. There they undertook further training before being sent to Sydney in April 1941 to begin the move to New Britain,. where they were to form part of a garrison force being established in response to concerns about war with Japan in the Pacific. Upon formation, the 2/22nd's commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Howard Carr; he would remain in command of the battalion throughout its brief existence. Rabaul Embarking upon the troopship Zealandia, on 18 April 1941, on 26 April 1941, the 2/22nd arrived at Rabaul, New Britain, where they formed the main element of Lark Force, along with a few artillery units, a field ambulance, a detachment from the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles and No. 24 Squadron RAAF. They were tasked with protecting the seaplane base at Rabaul, the Lakunai and Vunakanau aerodromes and to delay any proposed Japanese advance towards Australia. Between April 1941 and January 1942, the battalion helped construct defences and acclimatised to the tropical environment. The Imperial Japanese started bombing Rabaul in early January 1942,. in advance of an invasion. By 22 January, No. 24 Squadron had only three aircraft remaining and was forced to withdraw back to New Guinea, so the decision was made to crater both aerodromes in order to prevent the Japanese from landing aircraft. In anticipation of the coming invasion, the battalion withdrew from around Rabaul and set up defences on the western shores of Blanche Bay,. only hours before the Japanese landings commenced at 01:00 on 23 January. A series of desperate actions followed near the beaches around Simpson Harbour, Keravia Bay and Raluana Point as the Australians attempted to turn back the attack.. As they were pushed back by overwhelming Japanese forces, the commander of Lark Force, Colonel John Scanlan, issued an order to withdraw.. Elements of the 2/22nd that had not been captured escaped along New Britain‚Äôs north and south coasts, moving in groups of varying sizes up to company-strength, with about 300 men from the battalion managing to escape to Australia via New Guinea. A small number of these men were sent to Salamaua where they took part in a brief defence following the Japanese landing at Salamaua in March 1942.. The battalion was not re-raised at this time and those personnel that made it back to Australia were absorbed into the amalgamated 3rd/22nd Battalion, which was formed from the 2/22nd survivors along with volunteers for overseas service from the 3rd Battalion, which was ordered to disband following its return from New Guinea. Later, this battalion was also disbanded and its personnel transferred to the 2/3rd Battalion. Some of the battalion who surrendered or were captured by the Japanese on New Britain were massacred at Tol Plantation, where around 160 Australians were killed.. Their bodies would later be discovered by gunners from the 2/14th Field Regiment during the Australian campaign to secure the island in 1945.. Those that were not killed at Tol were interned as prisoners of war.. In June 1942 they were embarked upon the Montevideo Maru for transport to Hainan Island. While at sea, however, on 1 July, the ship was sunk by the submarine USS Sturgeon off the Philippines, with 1,053 prisoners and civilian internees losing their lives.. Those members of the 2/22nd that had remained at Rabaul were later transported aboard the Natuno Maru to Japan where they remained in captivity until they were released in September 1945, following the end of hostilities. The battalion lost 608 men who died or were killed in captivity and one man wounded. Members of the 2/22nd received the following decorations: one Military Cross, one Military Medal and 16 Mentioned in Despatches.

The siege is infamous for a brawl and subsequent combat between German and Scottish mercenaries within the besieging army, which claimed the lives of about 1,500 Scots. Wesenberg was seized in a renewed Swedish assault in 1581. Livonia (including Estonia), contemporary map Background While the Treaty of Stettin had formally ended the Northern Seven Years' War in the Baltic, the Livonian War dragged on for control of the Eastern Baltic coast, formerly controlled by the Teutonic Order State.Black (1996), p. 59 The town of Wesenberg, Rakvere in Estonian and –†–∞–∫–æ–≤–æp in Russian, was a Russian-held stronghold situated near the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland,Peterson (2007), p. 92 about half-way between Reval (Tallinn), which had submitted itself to Sweden in 1561, and Narva, captured by Ivan IV of Russia in 1558. Prelude John III, king of Sweden since 1568, faced a Russian offensive on the Swedish positions in Estonia during the early 1570s.Peterson (2007), p. 91 Reval withstood a Russian siege in 1570 and 1571, but several smaller towns were taken by Russian forces. The Russian advance was concluded by the sack of Weissenstein (Paide) in 1573. After the capture, the Russian forces roasted alive some of the leaders of Weissenstein's Swedish garrison, including its commander, triggering John III to mount a retaliatory campaign with Wesenberg being the main objective. The campaign started in Reval, where Sweden had concentrated her troops, including between 4,000 and 5,000 Scots.Fischer (1907/2009), p. 63 Already in 1572, John III had requested that Archibald Ruthven recruit Scottish co-patriots to reinforce his Livonian army. Ruthven had raised 3,000 infantry and 760 cavalry, who arrived in Swedish √Ñlvsborg in June and July 1573. They were split up into small units and marched to Sweden's eastern coast. Overdue pay caused some mercenaries to delay their march, pillage the countryside, and revolt against Ruthven. Upon their arrival in Stockholm and ports in √ñsterg√∂tland, they were joined by another 300 Scottish cavalry and shipped to Reval, where they arrived in September and joined with Swedish and Finnish regulars as well as German mercenaries, primarily consisting of cavalry and artillery. In November, the army left for Wesenberg, under the overall command of Klas √Ökesson Tott (the Elder) and field command of Pontus de la Gardie. The march was again delayed by the Scottish troops, who demanded to be paid a month in advance, causing de la Gardie to sell part of his jewelry to satisfy their claims. Siege In January 1574,Peterson (2007) erroneously gives January 1573 on page 91, contradicting his previous description of the 1573 Scottish march through Sweden on the same page. Wesenberg was stormed twice, but without success. In the third assault of 2 March 1574, the Swedish forces lost at least 1,000 men.Ruthven claimed 1,100 Scottish dead: Fischer (1907/2009), p. 63. Subsequent Swedish attempts to dig tunnels and set the town on fire likewise failed. De la Gardie withdrew part of the besieging army for expeditions to nearby Tolsberg (Toolse) and Dorpat (Tartu), both of which were unsuccessful. Pontus de la Gardie Thus, the besieging forces were demoralized. In addition, supplies ran out and tensions grew after the German faction blamed the failures on a lack of Scottish support. On 17 March 1574,Soderqvist (1898/2008), p. 113Fischer gives 15 March 1574: Fischer (1907/2009), p. 64. a brawl between German and Scottish mercenaries occurred,Fischer (1907/2009), p. 64 triggered by insults and/or unpaid ale in the canteen. First, a German officer tried to intervene, but when he was unsuccessful and the brawl turned into an open fight, de la Gardie, Tott, and Ruthven arrived to the scene in person. They were however likewise attacked and fled, with Ruthven suffering severe injuries. When the commanders had fled the scene, Scottish mercenaries overwhelmed the German artillery, seized the guns and took aim at the German cavalry. The German cavalry charged, hit by Scottish artillery fire on their way, and cut down the Scots. The result was 30 dead Germans and 1,500 dead Scots. The German and Swedish infantry stood by without taking action, neither did the Scottish cavalry intervene.Fischer however reports a possible involvement of the Scottish Moncrieff cavalry unit in the fight: Fischer (1907/2009), p. 64. Several Scottish officers were among the dead, including David Murray, Jacob Murray, and George Michell. About 70 Scots escaped to the Russian forces in Wesenberg, the last historical record of them is that they were subsequently brought to Moscow.Fischer (1907/2009), p. 65Fischer also cites R√ºssow's report, according to whom there were 700 escapees: Fischer (1907/2009), p. 65. The siege was aborted and the army withdrawn to Reval by the end of March.Peterson (2007), p. 93 Aftermath As a consequence, John III of Sweden removed Tott from overall command in Livonia and replaced him with de la Gardie. Furthermore, the king would not again start an expedition relying heavily on mercenaries, and was hindered by starting any offense at all by the investigation of the Wesenberg incident and a few subsequent trials in Reval throughout 1574. Ivan IV seized the initiative until the Battle of Wenden (1578) turned the war's tide. In 1580, Sweden took Kexholmsl√§n, and in the winter of 1580/81, Pontus de la Gardie led a Swedish army over the frozen Gulf of Finland, captured Wesenberg, turned to Narva which was taken on 6 September with the whole population slaughtered by the assailants, and until the end of 1581 sacked the last Russian strongholds in Estonia.

Biography De Sousa was the daughter of a Chicago police detective,1900 U. S. Federal Census, accessed on ancestry.com on 13 September 2012 John De Sousa (born 1856 died 1941), and his wife, Carrie (1861‚Äî1910). She had a younger sibling, Marvin De Sousa (1891‚Äî1921). She came to fame in 1898 as the singer of \\"Dear Midnight of Love\\", a ballad by Bathhouse John Coughlin. May attracted such attention that at end of her first full season in 1901, whilst still only a teenager, she was engaged by Frank L. Perley as one of the principals for his touring company for the musical comedy The Chaperons. With thirty four speaking and singing roles and a chorus of sixty it was said to be the largest musical organization so far seen in America. Next she was engaged as understudy for the great Alice Nielson in San Francisco and in 1902 had the opportunity to accompany her to London but demurred on that occasion due to a fear of the sea crossing. Instead she joined the cast of the hugely popular and long-running operatic fantasy The Storks. In April 1904, May was engaged to replace Bessie Wynne in the role of 'Sir Dashemoff Daily' in The Wizard of Oz and in September of that year followed that same actress in Babes in Toyland. By now she was an established success and much in demand. She went to London after all, but as a star in her own right, and first appeared on the London Stage as 'Cinderella' at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Other London successes followed, including Castles in Spain, The Geisha and The Girls of Gottenberg. Although her voice had firmly cast her in light operatic roles, May longed for an opportunity to prove herself as a dramatic actress and was given the opportunity when the famous French actor Monsieur de Max wanted to introduce her to Paris as 'Juliet' to his 'Romeo'. However, her French was too weak, and although de Max was prepared to pay her expenses for six months whilst she prepared for the part she was forced to decline. Six months out of her career was a luxury she could not afford so she carried on with her musical comedy roles. Two years later she did in go to Paris where she was rapturously received by the French audiences. Returning home to the USA after that engagement, she was temporarily reported missing by her parents when she was not heard from for over five weeks. Now she was a major star on both sides of the Atlantic and it seemed she had the World at her feet. Personal tragedy struck on January 31, 1910 however, when her mother was discovered dead in a gas filled room.\\"May De Sousa's Mother Dead\\", Evening Times Republican, Marshaltown, Iowa, 31 January 1910 It was not determined whether the tragedy had been a suicide or the result of an unfortunate accident. Although it was reported that she would be marrying a nobleman, in April 1910, she married Eaton Arthur Haines, a stockbroker, in Haverstraw, New York. But it proved to be a troubled marriage from the start. Haines, it appears, had misrepresented his wealth to her before their marriage and it was left to her to support him and his spendthrift ways. Worse, she alleged that he frequently beat her, always being careful to restrict his blows to her body so as not to leave marks that might give away his abuse or impair her ability to earn money. After two turbulent years she parted from Haines and divorced him in December 1914 on the grounds of cruelty and financial desertion. Continuing her career on both sides of the Atlantic, she was in France shortly before the outbreak of the Great War and escaped the German invasion by the margin of only a few weeks. De Sousa played the role of a model Juliette in the 1911 play of \\"The Count of Luxembourg\\" at Daly's Theatre in London. In 1913, De Sousa declared bankruptcy.\\"May De Sousa A Bankrupt\\", The New York Times, 28 September 1913 De Sousa retired in 1918, following a theatrical production in Australia, married a local doctor, and eventually moved to Shanghai. In 1943, following a seven-month imprisonment as a civilian internee under the Japanese in Chapei Civil Assembly Center, in Shanghai, China, she returned to the United States on the GripsholmLeck, Greg Captives of Empire: The Japanese Internment of Allied Civilians in China, 1941-1945, pg 533' and took a job in Chicago as a scrubwoman in the public- school system. Her years of internment had taken their toll on her health however, and soon she was forced to quit working because she was too weak to continue. Without means to support herself, her condition worsened through malnutrition and she died, penniless and alone, a charity case in the county hospital on 8 August 1948. Once the toast of Europe and America, whose voice had thrilled royalty and the nobility as well as countless masses, she died alone and unloved, unable even to feed herself. Her body lay unclaimed in the morgue and was interred in a paupers grave,\\"Once Famous Soprano Dies in Charity Ward\\", Lodi News-Sentinel, 11 August 1948 at age 66.

The photo accompanied an article discussing Hunt being awarded the 16th Spingarn Medal. Henry Alexander Hunt (October 10, 1866Passport Applications, Hancock County, GA - NARA Microfilm Publication M1490, 2740 rolls. General Records of the Department of State, Record Group 59. National Archives, Washington, D. C. - October 1, 1938) was an American educator who led efforts to reach blacks in rural areas of Georgia. He was awarded the Spingarn Medal by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), as well as the Harmon Prize. In addition, he was recruited in the 1930s by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to join the president's Black Cabinet, an informal group of more than 40 prominent African Americans appointed to positions in the executive agencies. Early life Henry A. Hunt was born on October 10, 1866, to parents Henry Alexander Hunt, Sr. and Mariah Hunt. He was born on \\"Hunt Hill\\", by the small town of Sparta, in Hancock County, Georgia, part of the Black Belt. Hunt was the youngest of eight mixed-race children, four boys and four girls, born to an African- American mother, Mariah Hunt. The Hunts lived in a weather-beaten house on their small farm and the children grew up working on the farm. Despite his African-American roots, Hunt's appearance led people to assume he was from purely Caucasian descent. After Henry Hunt's death, W. E. B. Du Bois, a personal friend of his, publicly spoke of Henry's Caucasian appearance and reflected on the questions Hunt received about why he did not choose to hide his mixed-race background.  Education  He attended school at Sparta for his early education. In 1882, at the age of 16, he started at Atlanta University, one of the historically black colleges created after the American Civil War. While attending Atlanta University, Hunt met Florence Johnson, the woman he would eventually marry in 1893. E. A. Johnson, Florence's brother, was the former Assemblyman of New York. Throughout his time as a college student, including vacations from school, Hunt worked as a carpenter to earn money. Hunt graduated from Atlanta University with a Bachelors of Arts degree and completion of coursework in the Industrial Department in 1890. Career= Early career  Hunt worked for the education of black students for his entire career. After graduating, he had a job offer in Africa, but he turned this down to be the principal at Charlotte Grade School in Charlotte, North Carolina. Henry Hunt stayed at this position for less than a year, leaving the Charlotte Grade School in 1891 for the position of Superintendent of the Industrial Department at Biddle University (now Johnson C. Smith University). In the year 1900, Hunt established an annual African-American farmer's conference including the counties surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina. Henry Hunt continued to work for Biddle University for the rest of the thirteen and a half years the Hunts were in Charlotte, North Carolina. By the time he left Biddle University, he had also been appointed as Superintendent of Boarding.  Fort Valley Career  He was then the principal of Fort Valley High and Industrial School, Fort Valley, Georgia.Horne, Frank. \\"Henry A. Hunt, Sixteenth Spingarn Medalist\\", The Crisis, August 1930, p. 261. \\"Spingarn Medal Winners\\" , National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (2009) The Fort Valley High and Industrial School, affiliated with the American Church Institute of the Protestant Episcopal Church, was chartered in 1895, but struggled financially. The school received funds from Northern philanthropists, but there were disagreements about whether the school should pursue a Liberal Arts educational model or the Hampton-Tuskegee Industrial educational model. In the 1902-1903 school year, the school's first principal, John W. Davis was released as principal and the trustees began looking for replacements. George Foster Peabody, one of Fort Valley's Northern philantrhopists who was on the Board of Trustees, suggested Henry Alexander Hunt because of his work at Biddle University. Other trustees had suggested different men for the position of principal and although Henry Hunt was among the final three candidates, he was only offered the position after the other two men had declined the job. Even after this, Hunt did not immediately get the job. The trustees were reluctant to hire an Atlanta University graduate since Booker T. Washington had advised the Board of Trustees that an Industrial College not run by a Hampton or Tuskegee graduate, was not likely to be successful. The 1903 school year began for Fort Valley High and Industrial School began without a principal as the trustees continued to scrutinize Hunt. Hunt stressed the mechanical background he acquired from his industrial studies at Atlanta University and his background in carpentry and was then hired in November 1903. The Hunts moved to Fort Valley with their three small children, two girls and one boy, and Hunt began his career as the Fort Valley High and Industrial School principal on February 9, 1904. When the Hunts came to the school it consisted of a single building, Odd Fellows Lodge, and the school had an annual budget of $840. The Hunts lived with no running water. Hunt began to change the school's educational model to aim more towards vocational training and trade-based studies. Hunt instated classes in sewing, cooking, carpentry, and gardening. Hunt also planted two hundred peach trees (Fort Valley is located in what is known as the Peach Belt) to expand the agricultural program to include practical and demonstrative agricultural education. Hunt felt a focus on agricultural studies was important given the emphasis on and prevalence of agriculture in middle Georgia, where the school was located. In the beginning and throughout Hunt's career the area surrounding the school was dominated by a population of African Americans who worked in agriculture. Hunt often stated his goal as empowering the African Americans attending Fort Valley, as well as the surrounding African-American community, to become effective in their trade. > With Negroes cultivating millions of acres of land, surely no argument is > needed to prove the wisdom and the justice of giving them every possible > opportunity to learn how to do that work more intelligently and with greater > skill. In 1907, Hunt presented to the Board of Trustees the need to add the study of scientific agricultural training to the existing agricultural studies program. > Working as we do among a people who are engaged very largely in agriculture > it would seem to be not only important but absolutely necessary that special > inducements be held out to students who wish to give attention to this > particular line of work. Also in 1907, Hunt began an annual Fort Valley conference for African American farmers. The conference brought experts from throughout the state, the country and some of the top industrial schools such as Tuskegee, to inform the attendees of the latest agricultural technology and information. At these conferences, Hunt stressed the possibility for African-American farmers to own their farms. In 1907, Hunt also began a practical agricultural program, with the help of the United States Department of Agriculture, five acres of land were cultivated and used as part of the educational process through demonstrations. With financial help from the General Board of Education, Hunt added 55 acres to the school's educational farmland in 1915. Hunt's reputation as an advocate for the African-American farmer spread. In 1918, the Governor of Georgia, Hugh M. Dorsey, appointed Hunt to the position of supervisor of Negro economics for the state of Georgia. In this position Hunt focused on problems relating to agricultural labor in Georgia. In 1925, W. E. B. Du Bois asked for Hunt's help with a research project focused on the study of Negro Common Schools in Georgia. In a response letter to Du Bois, Hunt expressed interest but ultimately declined the offer because he was busy overseeing the building of a boy's dormitory on the Fort Valley campus. In 1930, Henry Hunt was awarded the 16th Spingarn Medal for his 25 years of work in Fort Valley. When Henry Hunt started working for Fort Valley High and Industrial School there was only one building. Over the years, he raised funds to build the plant of the school and turned it into a community center of teaching about health and farming, as well as academic subjects, and built relations with the regional community of 300,000 blacks and whites. The result of this was a campus expanded to 12 buildings, 91 acres of land, and a worth of $450,000 in 1930. In 1931 Hunt received the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship, which came with $1,400 and the purpose of travelling to Scandinavian countries to study agriculture and cooperatives. In 1939 Fort Valley High and Industrial School was consolidated with the Teacher College and became Fort Valley College. With expansion and addition of programs, in 1996, it became chartered as Fort Valley University.  Farm Credit Administration  Under Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, many administrations and committees were created. One such administration was the Farm Credit Administration, (originally named the Federal Farm Board), which had the purpose of providing governmental support to farmers. Henry Morgenthau Jr. was appointed as governor of the Farm Credit Administration. Morgenthau wanted an African-American man to assist him with his work, and in particular, spread awareness of the administration throughout the African-American farming population. Henry Hunt moved to Washington D.C. to fulfill the position of Assistant Governor of the Farm Credit Administration in November 1933. Hunt maintained his position as principal of Fort Valley High and Industrial School, and Florence remained in Fort Valley to attend to the school. As Assistant Governor of the Farm Credit Administration, Hunt travelled often to connect with African-American farmers and inform them of credit unions. A memorandum from Henry A. Hunt's office in Washington D.C. summarizes some of Hunt's research goals while holding the position in the Farm Credit Administration: > To publicize the work and service of the Farm Credit Administration among > Negro farmers in the United States, and to answer letters of inquiry from > Negro farmers on all phases of Farm Credit Administration service, > explaining to them the procedure involved in applying for credit through the > various lending agencies operating under the supervision of the Farm Credit > Administration. Also to act as an organizing agent for the Credit Union > Section by meeting eligible groups of Negroes, explaining to them the aims > and methods of the Federal Credit Act, and assisting in the preliminary > steps for establishing credit unions. On November 22, 1933, shortly after his appointment to Assistant Governor of the Farm Credit Administration, Hunt wrote a letter to W. E. B. Du Bois, a personal friend of his for more than 25 years of his life. In this letter Hunt expresses gratitude to Du Bois for Du Bois's recommendation of Hunt to Morgenthau. Even so, soon after his appointment, Hunt had already been writing letters to various institutions and administrations across the nation involved in the improvement of African-American farmers' lives. On February 7, 1934, Hunt was called to attend the Interdepartmental Group Concerned with Special Problems of Negroes, colloquially known as Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Black Cabinet. He was one of a total of 45 African Americans who created federal policy on education, jobs and housing at major cabinet-level agencies in the executive branch. They also acted as Roosevelt's informal advisers on national issues related to African Americans and the New Deal. In 1935, a sub-committee of this Interdepartmental Group Concerned with Special Problems of Negroes, specifically dedicated to agriculture was formed of Hunt and four other men. Henry A. Hunt has also been credited as largely responsible for the creation of Flint River Farms, which was established in Macon County, Georgia, in 1937. The Flint River Farms was founded as a cooperative community for African- American farmers. Hunt died on October 1, 1938.\\"Fort Valley State University History\\", Fort Valley State University website.

The tribal affiliation and language of the Teyas is unknown, although many scholars believe they spoke a Caddoan language and were related to the Wichita tribe, whom Coronado encountered in Quivira. Apparently, Teyas was the name they were called by the Rio Grande Pueblo Indians.Flint, Richard. No Settlement, No Conquest, Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 2008  Identity of the Teyas  Scholars differ in their guesses as to the identity of the Teyas and their language. Some anthropologists and historians speculate that they were Apache. Other scholars believe they were related to the Rio Grande Pueblos, perhaps speaking a Tanoan language. They may have later become known to the Spanish as the Jumano. It is possible, however, that Jumano was only a generic description of Plains Indians rather than referring to a distinct tribe. The Teyas had close trade relations with the Pueblos, but Coronado was told that, in the 1520s, they destroyed several Pueblo villages in the Galisteo Basin near present-day Santa Fe, New Mexico. That implies that the Teyas were numerous, powerful, far ranging and that they participated in the politics of the Pueblos, thus strengthening the case that they were Tanoans.Riley, Carroll L. Rio del Norte. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1995, pp. 191‚Äì92 A narrow plurality of experts, however, believe that the Teyas were Caddoan language-speakers related to the Wichita peoples whom Coronado found in Quivira in central Kansas. The Teyas may have not been full-time nomads of the Plains; they may have also inhabited farming villages further east. Agrarian tribes of the region commonly ventured onto the plains for extended buffalo hunts. Archaeologists have found the remains of many farming villages of the time (Wheeler phase, believed to be Caddoan), near the Washita River in southwestern Oklahoma. The proximity of the Teyas to the Washita villages suggests a relationship.Flint, 157; Drass, Richard R. and Baugh, Tomothy, G. \\"The Wheeler Phase and Cultural Continuity in the Southern Plains.\\" Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 42, No. 160, 198-200 The description of the Teyas as painted and tattooed also points to them being Caddoans, since Wichita were called \\"Raccoon People\\" for their custom of tattooing around their eyes‚Äîa custom the Teyas shared.Dorsey, George Amos. The Mythology of the Wichita, Washington, DC: Carnegie Institution, 1904 Although most authorities believe that the name \\"Teyas\\" derives from a Pueblo word, there is an intriguing similarity with \\"Tejas\\" the Caddoan word that means \\"friend\\" and is the origin of \\"Texas.\\"http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/index.html The Teya may have been none of the above but instead may have been a Coahuiltecan or Tonkawa group. Most of these tribes resided in southern and central Texas. An old man man who said he met previously met Spaniards, probably Cabeza de Vaca, gives credence to a southern origin of the Teyas. The ethnic identification of the Teyas may never be determined, but, if so, it would be most useful in untangling the complexities of the protohistorical period on the Southern Plains. The later Escanjaque Indians, Aguacane, and Iscani may be descended from the Teyas. Colonialism In 1541, the Spanish conquistador Francisco V√°squez de Coronado led an expedition onto the Great Plains from the Rio Grande pueblos in New Mexico. Coronado‚Äôs objective was to find a rich country called Quivira. Traversing the Texas panhandle Coronado met two groups of Indians: the Querechos and the Teyas. The Querechos were nomadic buffalo hunters, almost certainly Apaches, and they inhabited the Llano Estacado. The Teyas lived in the canyons below the escarpment on the eastern edge of the Llano. The Querechos and Teyas were enemies. The discovery of Spanish artifacts from an archaeological site 35 miles northeast of Lubbock makes Blanco Canyon near the headwaters of the Brazos River the likely place where Coronado first encountered a large settlement of Teyas.Flint, 158 Culture of the Teyas The Teyas were described as nomadic buffalo hunters who lived in tents. However, they had additional resources. The canyons had trees and flowing streams and the Teyas grew or foraged for beans, but the Coronado chroniclers state they did not \\"sow corn, nor eat bread, but instead raw meat.\\" The Spanish noted the presence of mulberries, roses, grapes, nuts (probably pecans) and plums. After this first contact, Coronado traveled an additional four days and encountered a settlement called Cona that extended for three days travel along a small river in a canyon two or three miles wide. It is unclear whether Coronado followed the Brazos downstream or journeyed to a different canyon to visit Cona. \\"The country was well occupied,\\" said the chroniclers. The Coronado chroniclers described the Teyas as intelligent and formidable archers. One of them shot an arrow that passed through both shoulders of a bison, \\"which would be a good shot for a musket.\\" The women were well-dressed and modest, covering their whole bodies by wearing a petticoat beneath a fringed cloak with sleeves. One of the women was \\"as white as a Castillian lady except that she had her chin painted like a Moorish woman.\\" Coronado commented that they \\"tattoo their bodies and faces, and are large people of very fine appearance.\\"Winship, George Parker (Ed. and Translator), The Journey of Coronado, 1540-1542, from the City of Mexico to the Grand Canon of the Colorado and the Buffalo Plains of Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska, As Told by Himself and his Followers. New York: A.S. Barnes & Co, 1904, 69-71, 215 One of the intriguing events was Coronado's meeting among the Teyas an old blind bearded man‚Äîa beard being a rarity among Indians‚Äîwho said that he had met four Spaniards far to the south. He was probably talking about Cabeza de Vaca who with three shipmates made his way across southern Texas nearly a decade before Coronado.Winship, 232 What happened to the Teyas? The Teyas, or at least their name, disappeared from history soon after Coronado encountered them. Their likely fate was to be pushed out of their west Texas home by the advancing Apaches. If their descendants were later met by the Spaniards at a different location they were not recognized as the people Coronado encountered.

Some of these poems were well-known to scholars like A.K. Priolkar and V.B. Prabhudessai, who called for critical study of them. Critical texts of three of these have recently been published in the book Goan Christian Marathi Vilapika during the 17th Century by Dr. S. M. Tadkodkar, currently Head of the Department of Marathi at the Goa University. . Attribution to Thomas Stephens, SJ The three poems published by Tadkodkar are found in the bound volume of Thomas Stephens‚Äô KhristapurƒÅ·πáa at the Central Library, Panjim (Discurso sobre a vinda de Jesu Christo Nosso Salvador ao Mundo dividido em dous tratados feito pelo Padre Thomas Estev√£o Ingrez da Companhia de Jesus. Impresso em Goa com licenca das Inquisic√£o, e Ordinario no Collegio de S. Paulo novo de Companhia de Jesu. Anno de 1654, Escripto por Manoel Salvador Rebello, Natural de Marg√£o no Anno 1767). (This manuscript will henceforth be referred to as CL.) Tadkodkar attributes two of these, for reasons which will be listed below, to Thomas Stephens himself.See Ivo Coelho, Review of S.M. Tadkodkar, Goan Christian Marathi VilƒÅpikƒÅ in the 17th Century, Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 22/2 (2011) 265-271. Of the three texts, the authorship of the second (PG-2) is clearly identified within the text itself: \\"Esta paix√£o foy composta pello Padre Manoel Jacques de Noronha natural de Sancoale morador em Azossim freguezia de Sam Matheus das Ilhas de Goa. Escripto por Manoel Salvador Rebello, morador em Marg√£o da Provincia da Salcete no anno 1768\\".Tadkodkar 28, 149. As for the other two (PG-1 and PG-3), Tadkodkar proposes‚Äîsomewhat tentatively‚Äîthat the author is Thomas Stephens himself.Tadkodkar 15-21, 62-64. His reasons are as follows: # 4 stanzas of the KhristapurƒÅ·πáa (II, 48-92, 95, 183, 184) have been bodily transferred to PG-3 (44, 45, 59). \\"There is no doubt that the poet ... was well conversant with the [sic] Stephens' classic writing. One cannot avoid the possibility that Stephens himself wrote the VilƒÅpikƒÅ, since that writing is included in the same bound [volume]. Joaquim Heliodoro da Cunha Rivara ... states about it in his epoch-making Ensaio ... (Nova Goa, 1858).‚ÄùTadkodkar 15-16. # A certain Alex Rhodes speaks of having seen \\"a very fine poem on the Passion of Our Lord which the Christians sang in the Church in the evenings of all Lent Fridays\\". However, he does not actually attribute this work to Etienne de la Croix.Tadkodkar 19. # J.H. da Cunha Rivara speaks of a Paix√£o composed by Stephens, with additions made by da Faria: \\"Passion of Christ Our Redeemer, composed by Father Thomas Stephens of the Society of Jesus, and additions made by Pascoal Gomes da Faria, priest of the Order and habit of the Prince of the Apostles Saint Peter, native of Batim, parish of our Lady of Guadalupe, of the Island of Goa of a few hymns at the end of the book. Year 1772\\".J.H. da Cunha Rivara, \\"An Historical Essay on the Konkani Language\\", tr. Theophilus Lobo, in A.K. Priolkar, The Printing Press in India: Its Beginnings and Early Development. Being a Quartercentenary Commemorative Study of the Advent of Printing in India (in 1556) (Mumbai: Marathi Samsodhana Mandala, 1958) 227. Tadkodkar 19-20. # PG-1 and PG-3 have no confirmed authorship. \\"However, the nature of sublimity one experiences in the texts of the Passion resembles the sublimity one experiences in the PURƒÄNNA. Besides, some of the strophes from the PURƒÄNNA are bodily present in the third text of the Paix√£o de Cristo\\". Croix, says Tadkodkar, would never have claimed authorship, given that Stephens had died just recently, in 1619.Tadkodkar 20. # Michel Foucault, drawing from St Jerome, proposes four criteria for determining authorship: a constant level of quality or value; conceptual or theoretical coherence; stylistic unity; and historical unity.Tadkodkar 20-21. Apart from pointing out a stylistic similarity (the Charanna-seuacu in PG-1 recalls the ChristadƒÅssu of the KhristapurƒÅ·πáa II, 59, 123) Tadkodkar does not really pursue this fertile suggestion. # It would not have been possible for anyone to insert the verses from the Khristapurana into the main handwritten copy of the Paixao without a nod from the Inquisition. \\"I strongly feel that paix√£o do Christo was part and parcel of ChristpurƒÅnna, and that Stephens might have written two of the three poems\\".Tadkodkar 125. Critical apparatus The critically edited texts may be found in ch. 6 (Latin script) and 7 (Devanagari script) of Tadkodkar's book. Besides these, there are the appendices. Any student of Thomas Stephens will rejoice to have available transcripts and translations of the Censures and Licences pertaining to the first three print editions of the KhristapurƒÅ·πáa, as found in CL (Appendix A). Appendix B is a glossary of terms, beginning with Romanized Marathi, going on to Devanagari Marathi, and ending with English. Appendices C and D consist of explanatory notes, C of Christian terms, and D of terms sourced by the Christian writers from contemporary and prior Marathi writers. E is interesting: four texts of the ChilayƒÅbƒÅl VilƒÅpikƒÅ, composed by Shridhar, a 17th-century poet from Nazhare-Pandharpur, not far from Goa, and published here for the first time, perhaps because of the \\"remote possibility\\" of some connection with the Passion poems.Tadkodkar xii.

Prof. (Dr.) S.M. Tadkodkar, an ardent research scholar of Christian Marathi literature of the 17th century, and who is also Professor and Head of Postgraduate Department of Instruction and Research in Marathi at Goa University, has offered in this book edited copies of three poems based on sublime pathos of the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth. He also transliterated the texts into the Devanagari script. Dr. Tadkodkar has restored original texts after following principles of textual criticism. The author has also investigated linguistic form of the 17th century in Goa to explore whether it resembles with that of 12th and 13th centuries Marathi language in Maharashtra. The linguistic erudition reflected in these consolidated texts would emerge as a patient study of the 17th century enriched with glossary and copious notes. This attempt should be considered as the valuable contribution to the understanding of vernacular languages, which offer potentially abundant material for specialized linguistics.\\" (jacket) Wednesday, 12 May 2010 Prof. (Dr.) S.M. Tadkodkar, Goan Christian Marathi Vilapika during the 17th Century an extraordinary book: Delhi: B.R. Publications, 2009. Prof. (Dr.) Tadkodkar, proposes that 2 of the 3 Paixao de Christo found at the end of the MS of the Khristapurana preserved in the State Central Library, Panaji, Goa, were written by Thomas Stephens himself. The book - which is practically sold out - contains transcriptions of many other parts of the MS: the Censures and Licences, for example. Prof. (Dr.) Tadkodkar teaches a course called \\"Christian Marathi Literature\\" every year to his students. Every year, he told me, he has problems from his students: Sir, why do we have to study this stuff? And every year, by the end of the course, they say: This is the best course we have attended. Prof. (Dr.) Tadkodkar has much admiration for Thomas Stephens. His writings are able to move people even today, reaching out across temporal, religious and community barriers to touch the hearts of those who read and hear.

Biography Fisher was born in New York City and her family moved to Miami in 1948 where her father Gene Fisher was a homebuilder. Her mother, Ethel Fisher, was a painter who taught her to draw and paint at an early age; her sister is the performance and media artist, Margaret Fisher. In 1961 her mother abandoned the family to travel in Europe and after a divorce, set up her studio in New York. Sandra graduated from Metter High School (Metter, Georgia, 1965) and, after moving to Los Angeles, California, enrolled in art school. Her first marriage to Garry Gregson ended in divorce in 1970. After a brief return to Los Angeles, Fisher moved to London on 8 August 1971 to pursue a painting career full-time. She died at age 47 from hyperacute haemorrhagic leuco-encephalitis (not an aneurysm, as is commonly written). Fisher studied minimalist art and sculpture, graduating in 1968 with a BFA from the Chouinard Art Institute, but soon recognised that her compelling ambition was to be an intimate, observational painter. From 1970 to 1971 she was personal administrative assistant to the American printmaker Ken Tyler at Gemini G.E.L., the print atelier he founded in Los Angeles. During this period Fisher re-united with her mother, who now lived and painted in Los Angeles and who once again became an important source of inspiration as well as an intellectual ally. At Gemini, she met Robert Irwin and R B Kitaj; each had a profound if contradictory influence on Fisher's own developing philosophy of art. She worked a few hours a week for the historian Ariel Durant, whose ideas about art history helped her come to terms with her current emphasis on style, an artifact from her years at Chouinard. Durant warned her against painting \\"death masks\\" like one might see in Greek cemeteries and encouraged her to embody her figures with life. Within a short time Fisher distanced herself from conceptual art to favor portraiture, the male and female nude, and depictions of dancers, singers, actors and musicians. She occasionally sat in on classes by David Hockney at the Slade School of Art and from 1975 began to hire models to sit for her. Later in her career, intrigued by the writing of Paris-based painter Avigdor Arikha about plein-air painting and his practice of alla prima painting, she sought to complete a picture in one session. She was an invited lecturer at art schools in and around London, and she often spoke on women painters. Fisher was a lively, welcome figure at the heart of London's art community, a trained musician (clarinet) and avid reader and art historian as well as painter. She enjoyed popularity with London commuters (1989‚Äì91) for her posters commissioned by the London Transport Art on the Underground series, notably her colourful, languid image of boating in Regent's Park, Days on the water and her Lazy days, by Tube poster. She collaborated with the poet Thomas Meyer on three books (see below) and her drawings often appeared in the journal London Magazine. She obtained permission to draw at opera rehearsals in London, including that of Wozzeck. Her work entered collections held by the British Museum (\\"Sappho in Old Age,\\" a 1971 pastel), the London Transport Museum; Pembroke College, Cambridge; and the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, among others. She created a series of paintings for Heineken Brewery as part of a 1993 commission. Her exhibition of paintings and monotypes at the Lefevre Gallery in London, 1993, represented the full scope of her interests, including a number of paintings from a new series of Shakespearean subjects commissioned by the Globe Theatre on Bankside. She died before completing the commission. When Fisher and R B Kitaj re-met in London in October 1971, they began a long-term personal and professional relationship. Fisher was hired by Marlborough Gallery in 1972 as Kitaj's studio assistant. Fisher and Kitaj married in 1983. Their son Max was born in 1984 and Fisher became stepmother to Kitaj's two children from a prior marriage. After her death Kitaj was to write: \\"She came into my life in 1970 as a passionate Jewishness began to form crazily in me. She seemed like a shining California miracle of new-old Jewish womanhood invented in the Diaspora.\\".Quoted by Foundation for Women's Art, in Rubies and Rebels 1996 In his late, great (still inadequately appreciated paintings), Kitaj depicts himself as the slightly absurd, much older and smaller, white-bearded but still sexually-charged man, embracing the beautiful, voluptuously serene young Sandra, as Shekinah, the Kabbalah‚Äôs female aspect of God. In Los Angeles No. 13 (2002) the two of them are pushing an old-fashioned pram with a Hockneyesque child in it reminiscent of the ensemble pushed by a Warburgian Maenad four decades earlier in the Ohio Gang. By this time, Kitaj: 'no longer needed to explain his symbolism for his medium merged seamlessly with his message and his dreams were at last fulfilled in art rather than life. His extraordinary visual and intellectual literacy and his lifelong aspiration to be part of the great tradition finally come together in this series of portrayals, not of a mountain, a la C√©zanne, nor of depressingly isolated individuals (even when depicted alongside others) a la Lucian Freud, whose victims lie on beds or sofas like analysands in his grandfather‚Äôs consulting room, but rather in intense communion with each other, in what, politely preferring his own artistic vision to Freud‚Äôs, Kitaj calls: ‚Äòthe greatest story ever told, the Woman-Man Story.‚Äô Contextualising his credo in echoing Nietzsche‚Äôs reminder of the relationship between creativity and the truism that ‚Äòprocreation depends on the duality of the two sexes‚Äô, Kitaj writes that this ‚ÄòStory‚Äô: 'has become quite rare in painting since the death of Picasso‚Ä¶ My Sandra was an exception. She often painted nude men and women embracing. Her example has been a major influence on me. So I‚Äôve done about 20 of these love stories so far, and our romance need not die'. In view of what he says here it is especially appropriate that in one of the finest examples in this series, Los Angeles No. 22 (Painting-Drawing) of 2001, Kitaj depicts himself with his by now much younger wife seated on his lap.' Sandra is recording the outline of the shadow behind him in an evocation of the Plinyan myth of The Origin of Painting, as depicted by the 18th-century artist, David Allan. Edward Chaney,‚ÄòR.B.

Kitaj (1932-2007): ‚ÄòWarburgian Artist: Kitaj, Edgar Wind, Ernst Gombrich and the Warburg Institute‚Äô (Berlin, 2012). Writing for The Guardian in 2008 Germaine Greer noted that: \\"Sandra Fisher survives in her husband's writing not as a fellow painter, but as Shekhina, the female aspect of the deity of the Kabbalah with whom he seeks union. But Fisher was not divine; she was very, very human. She was one of the first women painters to succeed in painting the male nude as an object of desire. Her boys lie spread-eagled on tumbled sheets, their flushed skin bathed in the golden luminosity of summer afternoons.\\" In 2006 an exhibition of Sandra Fisher's work as well as portraits of her by other artists was held at the New York Studio School. The Charles E. Young Research Library at the University of California, Los Angeles, also holds a small collection of Fisher's papers.

All countries and parties to conflicts were urged to co-operate closely with the United Nations to ensure the security and safety of United Nations forces and personnel. The resolution also confirmed that attacks and the use of force against peacekeeping missions will be considered interference with the Security Council's responsibilities, and that it would consider further measures if appropriate. Further measures would be taken against the host country if it is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations with regard to the safety and security of United Nations operations and personnel.

He was the cousin of Dr Raees M. Mushtaq's father who is a current Senior Advocate of Pakistan and is the owner of Indus Hotel Hyderabad. In 1953, he was appointed as second Commander-in-Chief after taking over the command from Royal Navy's Rear Admiral J.W. Jefford, and served under two Governor-Generals from 1953‚Äì56, and then under President Iskander Mirza from 1956 until 1959. He resigned from his command due to differences regarding the navy's plans of modernization and to end the interservice rivalry with Army GHQ, Pakistan MoD, and the Presidency on 26 January 1959.

Biography=Early years and World War II Haji Mohammad Choudhri was born in Batala, Punjab, British India in 1912 in an Arain family He is the cousin of Dr Raees M Mushtaq‚Äôs Father. Very little is known about his early life which based on combined military history of India and Pakistan. As many of contemporaries in the British Indian military, he was educated at the Rashtriya Indian Military College and later joined the Britannia Royal Naval College in the United Kingdom. He was among the first Indians and first Indian Muslim to be commissioned a midshipman in the Royal Indian Navy's Executive Branch in 1931. On 1 September 1933, he was promoted to sub-lieutenant, receiving promotion to lieutenant on 1 September 1936. On 24 May 1938, he was assigned to the escort vessel HMIS Lawrence as its first lieutenant and was serving in this position at the outbreak of war in 1939; the future Indian Navy CNS Sourendra Nath Kohli served under him as a sub-lieutenant. He was trained as torpedo and anti-submarine specialist and held various officer's appointments both at sea and with land-based naval formations before and after the World War II. At the outset of the war, he saw action against the Italian Regia Marina in the Red Sea and off the Somali coasts. In 1942, he was sent to Britain where he qualified as a specialist officer in the Torpedo Branch. He then went to the United States in 1943, delivering lectures on the role of the Royal Indian Navy. On 25 March 1944, Choudhri was promoted to acting lieutenant-commander and given command of the minesweeper HMIS Rohilkand. On 1 September 1944, he was promoted to substantive lieutenant-commander, the first Indian to become a substantive senior line officer in the RIN. He participated in the Pacific theatre against the Imperial Japanese Navy. On 10 February 1945, he was promoted to acting commander and assigned to the sloop HMIS Godavari as its executive officer. In the 1945 Birthday Honours List, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division (MBE). He witnessed the Japanese surrender in 1945 and commanded a naval division that consisted of the two-ship formation that represented the Royal Indian Navy. After the war, Choudhri served on the Armed Forces Nationalisation Committee, and was promoted to acting captain in July 1947. In 1947, Choudhri served on the committee that was involved in the division of the RIN's assets between India and Pakistan. At the time of the partition of British India, Captain Choudhri was the senior-most Indian naval officer. He decided to opt for Pakistan in 1947. He was among the first twenty naval officers who joined the Royal Pakistan Navy (RPN) as a captain with a service number PN. 0001. He was the first most senior and the only captain in the navy in terms of seniority list provided by the Royal Indian Navy to the Ministry of Defense (MoD) in 1947. He did not actively participated in first war with India in 1947, instead he commanded a destroyer from Karachi to Mumbai to oversee the evacuation of Indian emigrants to Pakistan. In 1950, he was promoted to one- star rank, Commodore, and appointed to serve as deputy commander in chief under Rear-Admiral J.W. Jefford. Admiral Rear-Admiral J.W. Jefford's retirement was due in 1951 and favoured continuously appointing the British officers in the armed forces. Commander-in-Chief and resignation The Pakistan government called for appointing a native commanders-in-chief of army, air force and navy and dismissed deputation appointments from the British military. In terms of seniority, he was the most senior officer to be appointed as an admiral in the navy but the British Admiralty and Commodore Choudhri himself was in doubt to be appointed as commander of navy mainly because of his youth and lack of experience in military staffing. Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan approved his nomination papers as navy's commander in chief on the condition that he would spend a year in commanding a squadron in sea, and then attend the Imperial Defence College. Upon returning to Pakistan in 1952 after he gained staff officer degree, he was appointed as Deputy Commander-in-Chief at the NHQ where he established staff corps and administration. Although, the Pakistani government announced the appointment of navy's first native commander in chief in 1951 and Commodore Choudhri's nomination papers being approved by Prime Minister Ali Khan also in 1951, his appointment as navy's first native commander-in-chief came only in effect in 1953 with the crucial help provided from the army's Commander-in-Chief General Ayub Khan. He was promoted as rear admiral and assumed the command of the navy with an objective of expanding navy's resources and infrastructure. In 1951, Admiral Choudri decided to built the submarines and warships at the Karachi Shipyard & Engineering Works, relaying his plans to the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Finance, but was told by the civilian planners that the \\"second-hand ships from the United Kingdom would be better off for Pakistan\\", that eventually led the Navy to rely on the obsolete vessels that had to be acquire from the United Kingdom. From 1953‚Äì56, he bitterly negotiated with the U.S. Navy and Royal Navy over the acquisition of warship and made several unsuccessful attempts for the procurement of submarines imported from the United States. In 1954, he convinced the U.S. government to provide monetary support for modernization of aging O‚Äìclass destroyers and minesweepers, while commissioning the Ch‚Äìclass destroyers from British Navy. In 1955, Admiral Choudhri cancelled and disbanded the British military tradition in the navy when the U.S. Navy's advisers were dispatched to the Pakistani military. British military tradition were only kept in the air force due to being under its British commander and major staff consisting of Royal Air Force officers. Despite initiatives, the Admiralty's influence slowly vanished from the navy until the native officers were educated and promoted to flag ranks to replace the Royal Navy's officers In 1956, Admiral Choudhri sent recommendations for the construction of the seaport in Ormara and a naval base that would linked the Sonmiani but it was bypassed Ministry of Shipping that cited financial constraints. In 1957, he finalize the sale of cruiser warship from the United Kingdom, and used the government's own fund to induct the warship that caused a great ire against Admiral Choudhri by the Finance ministry in the country. In 1958, he made an unsuccessful attempt induct the imported submarines from Sweden using the American funds that was halted by the United States and the Pakistan's own Finance ministry despite he had support from Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army General Ayub. In 1958, his Navy NHQ staff began fighting with the Army GHQ staff and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) over the plans regarding the modernization of the navy. He was in bitter conflict with General Ayub who saw the purchase of PNS Baber and his submarine procurement approaches had jeopardized the foreign military relations with the United States. The MoD did sanctioned to pay off the costly PNS Baber but halted the crucial funds for the operations of the navy which had been assembled since 1956. In another Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting chaired by General Ayub in 1958, he became involved with heated debate over the financial costs for the naval operations in deep sea. General Ayub reportedly reached out to the President Iskander Mirza and lodged a complained against Admiral Choudhri by noting the Admiral of \\"neither having the brain, imagination or depth of thought to understand such (defence) problems nor the vision or the ability to make any contribution.\\" Admiral Choudhri then was called to meet with President Mirza to resolve the interservice rivalry between the army and navy but it was ended with \\"stormy interview\\" with the President. Upon returning to NHQ, Admiral Choudhry decided to tender his resignation to broke the interservice impasse in protest as result of having differences with Navy's plans of expansion and modernization. He resigned from the command of navy on 26 January 1959 and cited to President: \\"major decision [which] have been taken with disagreement with the technical advice I have consistently tendered.... concerning the concept of our defence, the appointment of our available budget, and the size and shape of our Navy.\\" In 1958, Vice-Admiral Afzal Rahman Khan, who was known to be confident of General Ayub Khan, was appointed as naval chief by President Mirza. Post-retirement and death After retiring from Navy, he went on to establish Merchant Navy and promoted civilian shipping trade throughout his life. After retiring from Navy in 1959, he founded and became director of Pakistan Institute of Maritime Affairs (PIMA) which he remained associated with until his death in 2004. He avoided politics and provided no commentaries on conflicts and wars with neighboring India in successive years of 1965, 1971, and 1999. He died of old age on 27 February 2004 and was buried in a military graveyard in Karachi. In his honor, the government established the \\"HMS Choudhri Memorial Hall\\" at the National Defence University in Islamabad in 2005.

Its mission was to train United States Army and Army Air Forces units and personnel to live and fight in the desert, to test and develop suitable equipment, and to develop tactical doctrines, techniques and training methods. It was a key training facility for units engaged in combat during the 1942‚Äì1943 North African campaign. It stretched from the outskirts of Pomona, California eastward to within 50 miles of Phoenix, Arizona, southward to the suburbs of Yuma, Arizona and northward into the southern tip of Nevada. History Catholic Chapel at Camp Iron Mountain, WW2 era. Camp Iron Mountain is the best-preserved divisional camp today. Now preserved in Mojave Trails National Monument. This simulated theater of operation was the largest military training ground in the history of military maneuvers. A site near Shavers Summit (now known as Chiriaco Summit) between Indio and Desert Center, was selected as the headquarters of the DTC. The site, called Camp Young, was the world's largest army post. Major General George S. Patton Jr. came to Camp Young as the first commanding general of the DTC. As a native of southern California, Patton knew the area well from his youth and from having participated in army maneuvers in the Mojave Desert in the 1930s. His first orders were to select other areas within the desert that would be suitable for the large-scale maneuvers necessary to prepare American soldiers for combat against the German Afrika Korps in the North African desert. Patton and his advanced team designated various locations within the area where tent camps would be built. The camps were situated so that each unit could train individually without interfering with the other. Airfields, hospitals, supply depots and sites for other support services were selected as was a corps maneuvering area. The plan was that each division and or major unit would train in its own area, and near the end of its training period would participate in a corps (two divisions or more) exercise in the corps maneuvering area at Palen Pass. Upon completion of the corps exercise, the trained units would leave the DTC, and new units would arrive to begin their training and the process repeated. By March 1943, the North African campaign was in its final stages and the primary mission of the DTC had changed. By the middle of 1943, the troops who originally came for desert training maneuvers, were now deployed worldwide. Therefore, to reflect that change in mission, the name of the center was changed to the California- Arizona Maneuver Area (C-AMA or CAMA). The CAMA was to serve as a theater of operations to train combat troops, service units and staffs under conditions similar to those which might be encountered overseas. The CAMA was enlarged to include both a communications zone and combat zone, approximately 350 miles wide and 250 miles long.deserttrainingcenter.com Camp Iron MountainUS Army, Military Training Lands Historic Context: Training Due to a severe deficit of service units beginning in the winter of 1943, it was decided that maneuvers in CAMA would cease as of 15 April 1944, with internal operations continuing until 1 May, after which the center would be officially discontinued.

Facts Gerald Krasner was the administrator of an insolvent worsted company, in an appeal joined to another two companies. Barry McMath was one of the employees claiming that his right to compensation for the employer‚Äôs failure to consult the workforce about redundancies was payable in priority to the expenses of administration. TULRCA 1992 s 188 gives the right to be consulted 90 days in advance where there are twenty or more dismissals, s 189 gives the right to a ‚Äòprotective award‚Äô in lieu of consultation and s 190 specifies this should be one week‚Äôs pay per missed week. Mr McMath‚Äôs contract had been adopted (in priority to administration expenses) under IA 1986 Sch B1 para 99, and so was owed any ‚Äòliability arising under a contract of employment‚Äô. Were protective awards in that category? Peter Smith J in one case had held that they were payable in priority and Etherton J in the other had held they were not. Judgment Neuberger LJ held that protective payments under TULRCA 1992 s 189 are not payable in priority to administration expenses. He noted that if a broad interpretation to ‚Äòwages and salary‚Äô is given under then it could hurt the purpose of rescuing insolvent companies, which was inspired by the Cork Report and underpinned the Insolvency Act 1986. This accorded with the natural meaning of IA 1986 para 99(5) and the list of payments in para 99(6), and accorded with the policy considerations surrounding rescue. In particular, many administrators would not decide that a rescue is possible if they know damages for failure to consult the workers who are retained and have their contracts adopted get super-priority for more than the work they do. Clarke LJ and Jacob LJ concurred in the judgment.

By the famous bronzier Pierre-Philippe Thomire, c. 1810. A French Empire-style mantel clock is a type of elaborately decorated mantel clock that was made in France during the Napoleonic Empire (1804‚Äì1814/15). Timekeepers manufacturing during the Bourbon Restoration (1814/1815‚Äì1830) are also included within this art movement as they share similar subjects, decorative elements, shapes, and style. Precedents By the end of the 18th century, from the mid-1770s on, French clockmakers contributed to a new art movement: Neoclassicism. This style in architecture, painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts, that had come into its own during the last years of Louis XV's life, chiefly as a reaction to the excesses of the Rococo movement but also partly through the popularity of the excavations at ancient Herculaneum and Pompeii, in Italy. Clocks of this style did without the excessive ornamentation and overelaborate designs of the preceding Rococo style so typical of the Louis XV reign. The timekeepers manufacturing during the Louis XVI and the French First Republic historical periods incorporated this new artistic language with classical designs, allegories, and motifs. In the case of the Louis XVI pieces, stone (usually white marble, alabaster or biscuit) was combined with gilded and/or patinated bronze, although certain cases were completely cast in bronze. Some models were architectural (i.e., with no figures) while others displayed classical-style figurines. During the 1790s, the production of gilded-bronze increased considerably as working conditions improved. The freedom of trade initiated by the French Revolution allowed many casters to develop large factories. Prior to this time, during the ancien r√©gime, they were limited to small workshops and were strictly limited to casting bronze. The new factory environment allowed them the opportunity to execute all stages of bronze work including drawing, casting, gilding, assembly, and trade of art objects.Charlotte Vignon, Deverberie & Cie: Drawings, Models, and Works in Bronze (2003): p. 170. Cleveland Studies in the History of Art. Vol. 8 Artisans still benefited from pre-Revolution training and worked according to the standards of a luxury art from the ancien r√©gime, but they had better means of production and organization. Characteristics=Materials and techniques The use of gilt-bronze to make luxury goods could be argued to have reached its peak at the beginning of the 19th century in France. This medium was not new, as it had enjoyed international reputation in Europe since the reign of Louis XIV that continued during the entire ancien r√©gime. One reason for this success is the technical qualities inherent in bronze. Cheaper than gold and silver, it is a common material that is easy to mold and gild. For this reason, it became the favorite material for clock cases, candelabra and furniture ornaments. Thanks to the skill of remarkable bronze casters and chasers these objects were not merely timekeepers, but became objets d'art. This golden age ended in the late 1820s, when the generation of craftsmen and laborers died out, cheaper metals started to be more increasingly used (e.g. brass) and bronze casting entered into a higher mechanization, sacrificing craftsmanship to increase productivity, and to reduce costs and manufacturing time. Bronze was the main material used in Empire style timepieces and both the patina and ormolu techniques were extensively used for ornamentation during this period. The fine modeling, gilt and patina finishes used in these series-produced pendulum clocks are considered matchless. Most clock cases were totally cast in bronze and others combined with a stone base made of marble, alabaster or porphyry. Wood (mahogany or fruit wood) and carved crystal (the latter used during the Restoration) were also employed, although less frequently. During this period there were between 40 and 60 workshops with founders, gilders, silversmiths, and chasers in Paris. The founders usually made a wax model from a draft and from this wax model a negative plaster cast was made, which could be reproduced more often. Then using this plaster cast a mould was made, in which the bronze was cast. By combining figures and mountings several versions of one design were produced. mercury fumes. Due to exposure to harmful mercury fumes during the \\"dorure au mercure\\" (fire-gilding) process, most gilders did not survive beyond 40 years of age as a consequence of mercury poisoning. Even in those days, they took all kind of precautions against mercury poisoning. These measures included chewing bread, or placing a piece of leather with an embedded silver coin over the tongue (the silver coin would change color when exposed to mercury). There was also a kind of mask devised to inhale the air from behind the head. None of these measures were sufficient counter-measures against mercury poisoning. Consequently the use of mercury was outlawed by French legislation after around 1830, although its use continued commonly until circa 1900 and it even was still in use in a very few workshops around 1960. To replace ormolu, other gilding techniques (like electroplating from the mid-19th century on) were utilized instead. Regarding the mechanism, towards the end of the 18th century, round clock movements became a reliable mass-produced product. Known as \\"Pendule de Paris\\" (Paris, or French, clock movements), they were an 8-day movement with anchor escapement, silk thread suspended pendulum with a count wheel striking on a bell every hour and half-hour. By the 1840s the simple and very effective silk suspension was being replaced by various adjustable spring suspension systems. It is necessary to emphasize that unlike the clocks built in the 18th century, where the majority of them were signed, the authorship in many of the Empire ones remain anonymous, making it difficult to attribute one particular work to a certain bronze sculptor. To this must be added that it was a common practice among bronziers selling pieces to each other and even to copy or readapt others' designs. When signed, they usually bear the name on the dial and could be the bronzier's name as well as the retailer's name or the movement maker. A small clock, usually covered by a glass bell, could cost 150 francs and 7.000 francs for the biggest works intended to decorate the halls of palaces and big houses. The total price comprised the work of the different people involved in its manufacturing process: * About 10% for the model design. * Casting, 20%. * Chiseling, 30%. * Gilding, 30%. * The movement only represented between 5 and 10%. This meant that about 90% of the production costs were the sculpture and the case making. Style and design C. 1810-1815 piece presenting George Washington in full military dress. Metropolitan Museum of Art. The clocks were manufactured following the style then in vogue, the Empire style, a phase within the Neoclassical scope, based on the classical antiquity art; both the ancient Greece and specially the Roman Empire. Although there were a great diversity of case shapes, the most common and popular ones were the clocks with a rectangular or oblong base sustained by four (or more) legs of different forms and patterns. The pedestal front was normally decorated with either garlands, acanthus tendrils, acroterions, laurel wreaths, scrolls, flowers and other classical decorative motifs, or depicting finely chased mythological and allegoric scenes in relief as a frieze of a Greek-Roman temple. On top of the base (in the center or to one side) sat the plinth that accommodated the clock dial, however in other models it was also placed in cart wheels, rocks, shields, globes, tree trunks, etc. These timekeepers were embellished with fine bronze figures of art, sciences, and high ideals allegories, gods, goddesses, muses, cupids, classical literary heroes and other allegorical or mythological compositions. Sometimes historical personages such as Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, philosophers and classical authors, were the main theme as well. Hence they are also known as figural or sculptural clocks (rather than architectural). An 1822 clock depicting the nereid Galatea, Catherine Palace. The respective allegoric composition in relief of the frieze, represents the \\"Triumph of Galatea\\", based on the homonymous fresco by Rafael Sanzio. Likewise, another of the sculptor's source of inspiration for the composition of a certain design were both classical sculptures and celebrated paintings. Examples of the first one include the Sleeping Ariadne and Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss by Antonio Canova or Psyche crowning Amor after a model by Claude Michallon. In painting can be quoted the Oath of the Horatii by Jacques-Louis David, H√©ro et L√©andre by Pierre-Claude-Fran√ßois Delorme, etc. The classical gods served as models and symbols for the era. For instance, the chariot clocks or \\"pendules au char\\" were an exceptional category within the Empire clocks. Apollo, Diana and Cupid depicted as triumphant chariot drivers, were the most popular gods used. It was habitual during the Napoleonic times and particularly under the \\"Directoire\\" and \\"Consulat\\" regimes that clocks glorify the conduct of warfare. More domestic and romantic subjects, like the \\"temple of love\\", gained popularity after the downfall of the Napoleon's Empire. During the Restoration (1815‚Äì1830) the representation of warfare scenes was not as common as in the early Empire. Finally, under the reign of Charles X (1824‚Äì1830), the case designs started gradually to develop away from a proportionate and strict classicism towards a baroque style which announced the eclecticism and historicisms in forms, so typical, on the other side, of the rest of the 19th century. That's why during the second half of that century and early 20th, among all of the different revival styles of mantel clocks available; Rococo, Louis XVI, etc., timepieces in the Empire style were made as well, normally they were replicas or adaptations based on preexisting models. Empire clocks in general and the largest and most notable examples in particular from the top bronziers, such as Pierre-Philippe Thomire, Claude Galle, Andr√©-Antoine Ravrio, Louis-Stanislas Lenoir-Ravrio, etc., are considered more than just clocks. They are works of art as well, sculptural √©tudes, where the balance in composition and the study of objects, animals and the human bodies forms and expressions are carefully and meticulously reflected in the bronze figures, achieving a high degree of realism, perfectionism and delicacy. These timepieces were devised to decorate the console tables or mantelpieces of a given hall or room in palaces, European and American mansions, houses, offices, etc. Today many of them are part of royal collections and can be seen in palaces, official residences, embassies, ministries, museums all over the world, etc. Even nowadays a few companies replicate this style, proving that the attention to detail, exquisite taste, superb workmanship, elegance and refinement achieved by the different artists and craftsmen involved in its manufacturing, are everlasting and timeless alike.

He belonged to the Villas-B√¥as brothers family. Early life and career In 1976, Glauco moved to Ribeir√£o Preto and, after being discovered by journalist Jos√© Hamilton Ribeiro, published his first works on newspaper Di√°rio da Manh√£. One year later, he was awarded the International Humor Exhibition of Piracicaba by a jury made up of Jaguar, Millor Fernandes, Henfil and Angeli, and the 2nd Biennial of Graphic Humor and Cuba. In 1984, invited by Angeli, he began publishing at the Ilustrada section of newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, where first appeared several of his characters, including Gerald√£o (created in 1981 after a reading The Teachings of Don Juan ‚Äì a Yaqui way of knowledge by Carlos Castaneda). Other characters include Casal Neuras, Doy Jorge, Dona Marta and Z√© do Apocalipse. For younger audiences, the weekly supplement Folhinha created the character Geraldinho, which is a light version (the dash and in the theme) of the character Gerald√£o. Geraldinho had a Sega Master System video game exclusively for the Brazilian market, released by Tec Toy, it was an adaptation of Japanese game Teddy Boy Blues. He joined the cast of writers of TV Pirata and also did some sketches for the children's show TV Colosso, both of Rede Globo, for which also developed vignettes. He edited the magazine Gerald√£o by Circo Editorial between 1987 and 1989 and during this period contributed to magazines Chiclete com Banana and Circus. As a musician, Glauco played in rock bands. Glauco had founded and led (for some 20 years) a Santo Daime church in S√£o Paulo called Ceu de Maria (Mary's Heaven), and contributed numerous Santo Daime Hymns, collected principally in a hymnal called the Chaveirinho. Style With an acid humor, quick jokes, clean traces Glauco contributed to the modernization of Brazilian cartoon in the period coinciding with the advent of a generation of post-dictatorship. His subject was the daily life and its degradation, with topics such as marital problems, neurosis, loneliness, drugs and urban violence. Glauco's name was usually associated with fellow cartoonists Angeli and Laerte. Death Glauco was assassinated in Osasco in the early hours of March 12, 2010. His lawyer announced to the press that the crime occurred during an attempted robbery which was then followed by an attempted abduction. Glauco negotiated with the bandits, who then led him forth but left behind his wife and his two children who were present in the home. As they left the house, another son of Glauco, Raoni, arrived at the scene and tried to dissuade the attackers, who shot and killed both father and son. Later this version was denied. In the version related by the Glauco's family, a university student named Carlos Eduardo Sundfeld Nunes tried to convince Glauco to leave his house to tell Nunes's mother that he was Jesus Christ. According to the delegate of the Police Section of Osasco, Carlos Eduardo Nunes had been charged for drug possession. \\"The murderer arrived, searched the family, argued with Glauco, drew his gun and started shooting. At this point, the cartoonist's son arrived. He kept shooting and escaped,\\" said the sheriff, who described the murderer as \\"troubled\\". The son reacted to protect his father.

Life  Born in New York, Feinberg received his undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1962. A year later, he obtained his master's degree from Purdue University. In 1968, he received his PhD degree from Princeton University. The subject of the doctoral thesis is fluid mechanics and the advisor is William Schowalter. After completing the PhD, he went to work at the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, where he was a professor of chemical engineering until 1997. He then moved to The Ohio State University, where he serves as Richard M. Morrow Professor of Chemical Engineering and Professor of Mathematics. Feinberg was a Member of the Editorial Board of the Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis from 1978‚Äì1991.  Research  Together with F. J. M. Horn and Roy Jackson, Feinberg created chemical reaction network theory, a field of mathematics that connects the graphical and algebraic structure of chemical reaction networks with their dynamic behavior. He is best known for stating and proving the deficiency zero theorem (together with Horn and Jackson) and the deficiency one theorem. He has also articulated complete necessary and sufficient conditions for detailed balancing in mass-action systems. More recently, Feinberg has turned his attention to problems arising from biology. Together with Gheorghe Craciun, he developed the theory of injective reaction networks and explored its implications for biochemistry. A current research focus (together with Guy Shinar) is the application of chemical reaction network theory to questions of robustness in biochemical reaction networks. He has also worked with Richard Lavine on foundations of classical thermodynamics.

This episode is notable for receiving a widely mixed opinion, with many commentators alternately considering one of the best or worst episodes of the series. Plot Washed ashore on the island, a pregnant woman named Claudia (Lela Loren) encounters an unnamed woman (Allison Janney); both of the women speak Latin. The woman helps Claudia give birth to her son, whom Claudia names Jacob (Kenton Duty). Then another boy is born (Ryan Bradford). The woman then kills Claudia with a blow to the head. The woman raises the twins as her own, and tries to keep them ignorant of a world beyond the island. She also convinces them to be distrustful of humanity, which she says she regards as corrupt and dangerous. At age 13, Jacob's brother (the future Man in Black) finds a Senet game, containing polished black and white pieces. Jacob asks about the box and his brother tells him it's a game for which he \\"just knows\\" the rules. He asks Jacob to keep the box a secret from the woman, but Jacob reveals it to her as she appears to know there is a secret. The woman confronts Jacob's brother and claims that she left the box for him, musing to him that \\"Jacob doesn't know how to lie...he's not like you.\\" She allays the accusation by telling the young Man in Black that he is \\"special.\\" He suggests that the box came from somewhere else, across the sea. The woman responds, \\"There is nowhere else.\\" When the young Man in Black persists in asking about his origins, the woman explains that she came from her own mother who is now dead. When he asks \\"What is dead?\\" the woman explains, \\"Something you'll never have to worry about.\\" After following a boar some distance from their camp, Jacob and his brother discover that other people are on the island. The woman warns the brothers that the other people \\"are not like us. We are here for a reason.\\" Then she worriedly expresses out loud that \\"it's not time yet\\" and reluctantly decides to show the brothers a mysterious, hidden tunnel filled with light and an underground stream. She tells them that one of them will eventually be its caretaker, and that she \\"made it so you [the two boys] can never hurt each other.\\" Upon seeing the light-filled tunnel, the woman explains that the light is \\"the warmest, brightest light you've ever felt. And we must make sure no one ever finds it.\\" She goes on to explain that, \\"A little bit of this very same light is inside of every man, and they always want more.\\" And then she finally warns, \\"If the light goes out here, it goes out everywhere.\\" Soon after, the brothers are playing the box game and Jacob is frustrated at his brother's selfish rules for the game. The young Man in Black explains, \\"One day you can make up your own game, and everyone else will have to follow your rules.\\" Suddenly a vision of Claudia appears and asks the young Man in Black to follow her. Jacob can not see her, so his brother excuses himself and follows Claudia into the jungle. She reveals to the young Man in Black that she is his and Jacob's birth mother and that the other people came to the island with her, 13 years earlier. After his discussion with Claudia, the young Man in Black confronts the woman about Claudia's claims, and attempts to convince Jacob to join the other people on the island with him. However, Jacob refuses and stays with the woman. Over the course of the next 30 years, Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) visits his brother (Titus Welliver) at the camp he shares with the other people. The Man in Black, while he believes the people are corrupt, stays with them as a \\"means to an end,\\" and when Jacob asks, \\"What end?\\", he replies \\"I'm leaving, Jacob.\\" He reveals that together with other scientifically curious men, they have discovered a way to leave the island by harnessing its strange properties. This was accomplished by digging wells in spots where \\"metal behaves strangely.\\" The Man in Black invites Jacob to leave with him, but Jacob refuses to leave the island or the woman. When the woman hears of what the Man in Black is doing, she visits him and learns that he and the others have constructed a giant wheel down a well. He tells her that his people have dug into the light from other locations on the island, and that they plan to create a system that will allow them to tap into its energy, and use it to leave the island. Upon hearing this, she smashes the Man in Black's head, rendering him unconscious. Later, the Man in Black awakens outside the well site, and discovers that the people in the camp have been massacred; the well has been completely filled in with earth. Meanwhile, the woman shows Jacob the tunnel of light again, explaining that it leads to \\"Life, death, rebirth; the source, the heart of the island,\\" and that Jacob has \\"no choice\\" but to take care of it now. She also warns Jacob never to enter the tunnel, as doing so would cause a fate worse than death. Jacob reluctantly drinks a wine that the woman pours and then she proclaims, \\"Now you and I are the same.\\" Enraged by her actions, the Man in Black stabs the woman in her camp through the back and asks why she wouldn't let him leave the island. She replies, \\"Because I love you.\\" Appearing relieved and calm with her fast approaching death, the woman says \\"Thank You\\" and dies. Jacob retaliates by beating his brother, and throwing him into the stream leading down the tunnel of light. The Man in Black is sucked into the tunnel and the smoke monster emerges in his place, disappearing into the treetops above. Jacob then finds the Man in Black's physical body and places it with the woman's in the cave where she had been living with Jacob, along with a pouch containing the black and white stones they used in the box game. In a repeat of a scene from the first season now in a new context, the corpses and the stones are found centuries later by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), and dubbed Adam and Eve by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). Reception \\"Across the Sea\\" is one of the most polarizing episodes of Lost. Writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse said on their podcast that even they were shocked by fans' reaction to the episode, stating they had received comments ranging from saying \\"This is one of the best episodes ever\\" to \\"You ruined Lost\\". The episode received mixed reviews from critics, and a divided reaction from fans. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 58 out of 100, indicating \\"Mixed or Average Reviews\\". The score was down on the previous episode's score of 92 and is the lowest rated episode of the season. Teresa Kiessling of NPD, said \\"Now we just need to learn the origin of their Mother,\\" and indicated that the episode did little to satisfy viewer's curiosity surrounding the origins of Jacob and Man In Black. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club stated \\"I have only one real criticism of ‚ÄúAcross The Sea,‚Äù and it's that when Lost deals directly with the transcendental‚Äîrather than just glancing at it‚Äîthe show can get awfully gooey, and painfully blunt.\\"Noel Murray (May 12, 2010), \\"‚ÄúAcross The Sea‚Äù  Lost  TV Club  TV  The A.V.

Sakchi is now part of the city between the Tata Steel site and the river Subarnarekha. Then it was known as Kalimati. Due to the presence of iron ore, river water and sand, Jamsetji Tata decided to establish TISCO (Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited) there. The company is now known as Tata Steel Ltd. Even today running through Sakchi is the Kalimati Road. During British India, a railway line connecting Jamshedpur to Howrah(Calcutta) was started. Jamshedpur is in the Indian mineral-rich state of Jharkhand which was earlier in Bihar as South Bihar. As Tata Steel was established the first planned urban settlement started in Sakchi Area and it included businessmen (Gujaratis, Parsis, Punjabis), servicemen (People from Bihar, Bengalis, Oriyas, Telugus, Tamils, Malayalis). Many people who then migrated from West Bengal, East Bengal (now Bangladesh), Gujarat, Assam are now permanent residents of Jamshedpur city and their ancestral homes were either lost or sold after separation of East Pakistan (Bangladesh). Old houses of Bengalis, Parsis, Anglo-Indians and Gujaratis can still be seen in Aambagan, Hill Cart Road, Kalimati Road, Pennar road, Sakchi Bazar areas of Sakchi. A few such homes are also present in Bistupur. According to some people who have seen Tatanagar 80-90 years back as a child, today where we have Aambagan maidan near the Present Masjid, there used to be a single line railway track which used to carry sand for the factory. It does not exist anymore. Mode of transport in the Jamshedpur city were Buggy and Taxis. There were single lane roads with old British style street lamps. Mostly the roads between Sakchi and Bistupur were surrounded by jungles. The city is unique because it is a very small town even today with extreme ends being covered within maximum 45 minutes (including traffic) and is not a metro city but still it has demography of a metro town as in people from all ethnicities live here as permanent residents. Sakchi is located in the centre of the city, on its west side lies Bistupur which is also one of famous place of the city, Kadma, Sonari.On the east side lies Baradwari,Kasidih,Bhalubasa,Sitaramdera,Agrico,Sidhgora. On its north lies Mango which is also one of the busiest place of the city and down south lies Burmamines, Tatanagar station, Jugsalai and Parsudih.

These songs include the melody and first verse of the traditional English song which gives the film its title, along with a new verse on Cromwell's rule. Premise During a visit from his governor in Ireland the Earl of Brendon, Charles I asks advice on finding a new tutor for his wayward son Prince Charles and accepts Brendon's recommendation of the vicar of Bray, County Wicklow. On returning to Ireland Brendon passes on news of the appointment to the vicar, who travels to London to take up the post, promising to return one day. He falls asleep during his first lesson with the Prince, allowing the latter to slip away to see his actress lover Meg Clancy. The vicar follows the Prince and mildly reprimands him before they are reconciled. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, the vicar heads back to Bray, gaining a promise from his friend the Prince that he will rule mercifully when he succeeds his father. Meanwhile the Royalist Brendon finally breaks from his Parliamentarian friend Sir Richard Melross, whose son Dennis seeks the vicar's help to be married to his childhood sweetheart Norah, Brendon's daughter. The vicar accepts but Brendon discovers and breaks up the wedding ceremony before it is complete. Sir Richard is killed in the war, Charles I is executed and Dennis and Oliver Cromwell find themselves in Ireland. In a meeting arranged by Dennis, the vicar uses his blarney to convince Cromwell that he is apolitical and thus worthy of exemption from a decree dismissing all clergy appointed by Charles I. News of the imminent Restoration reaches Ireland and Dennis accepts the vicar's entreaties not to oppose it. However, he ignores his advice to flee straight to France and instead is captured in a failed attempt to spring Norah from Brendon's castle, before being sent to the Tower of London to await execution. The vicar and Norah manage to reach Dover, where the new king has just landed.

It works on smartphones and tablet computers that have GPS support. It provides turn-by-turn navigation information and user-submitted travel times and route details, while downloading location-dependent information over a mobile telephone network. Waze describes its app as a community-driven GPS navigation app, which is free to download and use. The Israeli company Waze Mobile developed the Waze software. Ehud Shabtai, Amir Shinar, and Uri Levine founded the company. Two Israeli venture capital firms, Magma and Vertex Ventures Israel, and an early-stage American venture capital firm, Bluerun Ventures, provided funding. Waze Mobile was acquired by Google in June 2013. The app generates revenue from hyperlocal advertising to an estimated 130 million monthly users.  History =Development In 2006, Israeli programmer Ehud Shabtai founded a community project FreeMap Israel, which aimed to create, with the crowd sourcing assistance of community users, a free digital database of the map of Israel in Hebrew, and to ensure its free content, update and distribution. In 2008, Shabtai formed a company called Waze to commercialize the project. In 2009, the company name was changed to Waze Mobile Ltd. In 2010, the company raised $25 million in the second round of funding. The company raised an additional $30 million in financing the following year. The app was updated in 2011 to display real-time, community- curated points of interest, including local events such as street fairs and protests. In December 2011, Waze employed 80 people, including 70 at Ra'anana, Israel and 10 in Palo Alto, California. In November 2012, the company also began to monetize its app in November 2012, offering resellers and advertisers a web interface to advertise based on location, where a small icon appears when a phone is at a particular location, prompting the user to engage. It also offers TV news stations a web interface to broadcast current traffic reports and alerts directly from the Waze app; the service had been used by 25 U.S. TV news stations by June 2013. It has also been used in Rio de Janeiro inside Centro de Opera√ß√µes Rio (Rio's Operations Center) since July 24, 2013, as well as in New York and New Jersey since 2012. In 2013, the GSM Association, a trade association of mobile network operators, gave Waze the Best Overall Mobile App award at the association's Mobile World Congress exhibition.  Google subsidiary  In June 2013, Google bought Waze for $966 million. Waze's 100 employees received about $1.2 million on average, the largest payout to employees in Israeli high tech. In June 2013, the United States Federal Trade Commission started considering whether Google's acquisition of Waze might violate competition law ‚Äì Waze was one of very few competitors in the mobile mapping sector to Google's own Google Maps. The FTC decided that it would not challenge Google's acquisition of Waze. The UK Office of Fair Trading and the Israel Antitrust Authority also investigated it and allowed the acquisition.Waze - News - GCR - Global Competition Review Global Competition Review In 2020, the FTC announced that they will be re- examining the acquisition of Waze.  Overview  Waze collects map data, travel times, and traffic information from users and transmits it to the Waze server, at no cost to Waze. Waze users (\\"Wazers\\") can report accidents, traffic jams, speed and police traps, and, from the online map editor, can update roads, landmarks, house numbers, etc. Waze sends anonymous information, including users' speed and location, back to its database to improve the service as a whole. Based on the information collected, Waze is then in a position to provide routing and real-time traffic updates. Waze can also identify the cheapest fuel station near a user or along their route, provided Waze has enabled fuel prices for that country. Waze can be used anywhere in the world but requires enough initial users to create the maps and continuously update data to make it useful. Currently, only 13 countries have a full base map; the others are incompletely mapped, requiring users to record roads and edit maps. Waze offers turn-by-turn voice navigation, real-time traffic, and other location-specific alerts. Waze encourages users to report traffic or road hazards by offering points.  Features  Waze has the ability to direct users based on crowdsourced information. Waze users are able to report a multitude of traffic-related incidents from accidents to police traps. This data is used by Waze to help other users either by alerting them of the condition ahead or rerouting the user to avoid the area entirely. In addition to user input, Waze relies on information from state agencies for traffic events such as road construction. The idea behind this is that the more people that provide data the more accurate it will be. In addition to using crowdsourced information for traffic alerts, Waze also allows registered users to modify the map data itself through the Waze Map Editor. Map editors are allowed to make changes to the map based on where they have driven while using Waze as well as their rank which is based on how many map edits a user has made. In June 2013, Waze introduced a global localization project that enables future road closures and real-time traffic updates during major events in a given country, for example Tour de France. Google also acquired Waze in the same month. At the time of Google's acquisition, there were nearly 50 million Waze users. In 2017, an option was added for motorcycle users, as well as specialized routes for people eligible to drive in carpool lanes. Waze also lets users have the option to choose their navigation voice. Some featured voices include Morgan Freeman, T-Pain, DJ Khaled, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cookie Monster, Colonel Sanders, Kevin Hart, Shaq, and many more. In March 2017, Spotify announced its partnership with Waze to give an integrated experience where Wazers could play music on Spotify directly from Waze app and get Waze directions on Spotify app on the Android platform. Six months later, the feature was made available on the iOS platform. In May 2017, Waze introduced the ability for users to record their own voice navigation prompts. In August 2018, Waze introduced Android Auto support. In September 2018, Waze introduced Apple CarPlay support after Apple released iOS 12. In October 2018, Waze announced its partnership with Pandora, Deezer, iHeart Radio, NPR One, Scribd, Stitcher, and TuneIn for Waze Audio Player which Spotify has been Waze inaugural partner. However, Android users won't be able to link Deezer, and iOS users won't have access to Pandora, NPR, or TuneIn when Waze announced its partnership in Medium suggesting joining its beta program to be able to use mentioned services. In February 2019, Waze updated its iOS platform with Siri Shortcuts support. In May 2019 the company announced it would be adding Pandora a new streaming service to the audio play feature for iOS users, allowing riders to have more music options during their commute. In August 2019, Waze add YouTube Music integration to both platform. Google announced at the Google I/O 2019 developer conference it was adding Google Assistant integration with Waze. The integration was made available to Android phones in June 2019. In September 2020, Waze added support for lane guidance. Waze also announced that starting in October 2020, it would implement trip suggestions, pulling together suggestions from recently visited places.  Connected Citizens Program  Waze launched the Connected Citizens Program (CCP) in June 2014, a free, two-way data sharing program used by over 450 governments, departments of transportation, and municipalities for traffic analysis, road planning, and emergency workforce dispatching. The program is a two-way data exchange between Waze and the partner. In 2014, Rio de Janeiro started collecting data for its traffic management system. Rio collects real-time data both from drivers who use the Waze navigation app and pedestrians who use the public-transportation app Moovit. Rio was also talking to the owners of cycling app Strava to monitor movements of cyclists. It was noted that though initially the data the apps were sharing was all anonymous, more specific identifying details were possible, if people agreed to being monitored through their smartphones if they saw benefits for them.  Criticism  Concerns have been expressed that the app located on smartphones can be used to monitor movements by identifiable individuals. Some road-safety advocates have voiced concern over the prospect of more drivers using Waze, which they say has the potential to distract them with a flurry of icons and notifications and put them at greater risk of an accident. In March 2014, a successful attempt was made by students from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to fake a traffic jam. In December 2014, in a letter sent to Google, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck complained about the police locator feature, claiming it could be \\"misused by those with criminal intent to endanger police officers and the community\\". It was alleged that Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who shot and killed two NYPD officers that month, had used the Waze app prior to the murders and had posted a screenshot from the app on his Instagram account hours before the shootings, but that was unsubstantiated as the post was made three weeks prior to the shootings. Users are able to mark the presence of an officer with a small icon and indicate if the officer is visible or hidden. The LAPD, among other police agencies, pressured Google to disable the feature on the application. Google states that knowing the whereabouts of an officer promotes safer driving. In April 2018, Waze was criticized for rerouting traffic to Baxter Street in Echo Park, Los Angeles, which is one of the steepest hills in the United States. The app was blamed for exacerbating the road's present condition and increasing the number of crashes and spin-outs at the steep hill. The LA municipality later reconfigured the road to a one-way street. Licensing Waze Mobile Ltd holds several patents. The Waze v2.x software was distributed under GNU General Public License v2, which did not extend to map data. The base map data initially came from US Census Bureau TIGER data. FreeMap data was not published under open content licenses even before the shift to Waze project. Ehud Shabtai who initiated and developed Freemap and Waze continuously insisted to crowdsource data without using external sources or projects like OpenStreetMap that would restrict commercialization of the Waze map data. Starting with Waze v3 the application was rewritten and as such switched to a proprietary license. The last open- source client version for the iPhone and Android is 2.4.0.0, and for Windows Mobile 2.0. A class action suit was filed in March 2014 by accountant Roey Gorodish against Waze, claiming intellectual property violation for the use of open-source FreeMap map and code from the open-source RoadMap software, a project that Ehud Shabtai had contributed for the Windows PocketPC version in 2006. The lawsuit was dismissed on March 5, 2017 with a clear cut decision that there was no basis for a class action suit in this case. The lawsuit was dismissed again with final verdict given by the Israeli Supreme Court on 28 January 2019.

Format The 132-page magazine was the first Xbox 360 to be periodically published every three weeks, as opposed to the traditional monthly schedule preferred by its rivals (in 2009, 360 followed suit and changed to a three-weekly format). Since its launch, the magazine eschewed the ‚Äúmags in bags‚Äù trend, popularised by rival publishers Future Publishing and Imagine Publishing (wherein a magazine is packaged in a sealed bag along with a cheaply produced DVD and/or tips book), focusing instead on fierce editorial as its USP. This allowed the magazine to retail at a much lower price point than its competitors (currently ¬£3.99, having raised from ¬£2.99 in July 2012). Staff Launched and edited for the first two years by Stu Taylor, the current 360 Gamer staff are veterans of British videogames journalism, including editors James Artaius (former news editor of XBM and founding editor of FSM) and Ian Collen (formerly of Play Gamer and XBM), and staff writer Will Johnston (former news editor of Play and contributor to Play Gamer).

The bombing by Assamese militant group called United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) killed 18 people and injured many others. Most of the victims were schoolchildren aged between 12 and 14 and their mothers. Details On the occasion of Independence Day, 15 August 2004, people, mostly were school children and their mothers, gathered at Dhemaji College ground for Independence Day parade. At around 09:30 a bomb went off killing at least 18 and injuring many more. According to police the bomb was planted near the college-gate and triggered by a remote-controlled device. It was exploded when the students and teachers of various schools were passing through the gate. Investigations Police blamed ULFA, a banned Assamese militant group, which had called for a boycott of the event. The group continued denying responsibility. Aftermath Soon after the incident the local people allegedly attacked the police vehicles at the site for failure to protect the parade. Police had to launch a lathi charge and fire tear gas to bring the situation under control. The Superintendent of Police T. Thangou and the Additional Superintendent of Police Abu Sufian of Dhemaji were suspended for negligence of duty. The Deputy Commissioner was transferred for security lapse. Reactions The injured were admitted to the Dhemaji Civil Hospital and other 10 being critically injured were shifted to Dibrugarh Civil Hospital. Chief Minister of Assam Tarun Gogoi condemned the blast stating it to be ‚Äúmost barbaric, inhuman and pathetic‚Äù incident. He also announced that the state would be observing the 16 August of every year as Mourning Day in memory of those killed. The chief minister announced Rs 300,000 for the victims and Rs 50,000 for the seriously injured. The Dhemaji and Lakhimpur unit of AASU called a 12-hour bandh on 16 August 2004 in protest of the blast. The AASU had also demanded the resignation of the chief minister. The Assam State Committee of CPI(M) vehemently condemned the incident. It also organized a protest rally in the capital city of Guwahati on 17 August against the extremists for the killings and against the administration for the failure of protection. The committee had also called a 12-hour Assam-bandh on 18 August. Armed Forces Special Powers Act The chief minister Tarun Gogoi said that the Armed Forces Special Powers Act should stay in the disturbed areas to avoid the increasing activities by the rebel groups. ULFA takes responsibility after five years On 16 August 2004, one day after the blast, in a statement, Arabinda Rajkhowa, the chairman of the group, stated that the ‚ÄúIndian Occupation Force‚Äù and its agents used the schoolchildren as shield to defy the boycott call of the outfit. On 13 December 2009, Paresh Barua, the C-in-C of the group, sought public apology and forgiveness for the blast. He stated in an e-mail that the ULFA leadership was misled by some of their cadres and junior leaders about the blast, which is why the leadership had to deny its involvement.

The German Archaeological Institute (DAI) and the Research Archive for Ancient Sculpture (FA) are cooperating in the long-term strategic operation of a database Arachne which aims at making these digitized images accessible worldwide.  Requirements and aims  The project began with the glass negatives from the departments of the German Archaeological Institute at Athens, Istanbul and Cairo (Emagines1) in 2006. Negatives from Rome, Madrid, the headquarters in Berlin and the Eurasia-Department of the DAI were added during the second project phase in 2008 (Emagines2). These negatives mostly contain historical images of sculpture, topography and architecture, much of which no longer exists in its former condition. Furthermore, the negatives are severely threatened by physical decomposition and destruction due to environmental influences, natural catastrophes like earthquakes and (in the long run) manual use. The project aims at the permanent digital preservation of the negatives and their content. Until being made available in the Arachne database, widespread use of these negatives has been hindered by the way they have been scattered and by the partially overlapping nature of their images they carry. The digitized image holdings are copyrighted by the DAI and are therefore shown to the Arachne guest with the water mark of the DAI. The internet presentation of the images also provides a platform for an e-commerce system, still in a test phase. Within the database framework, textual information about the objects depicted in the images will be continually updated by the DAI by citing new bibliographical references. The database was modified not only with regard to its contents, but also technically in response to the heterogeneous material, which varies greatly in type, chronology and cultural history. a new entry mask has been developed to describe the essential characteristics of the material in many of those object groups, and some of the existing entry masks needed to be extended or customized.  Workflow  To avoid exposing the fragile contents from the risks of long-distance transport, the images are being scanned in the departments of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) in an ongoing process. The scanned images are then sent to the Research Archive for digital processing, entry into a database and long-term storage on the SAN of the University of Cologne for the DAI. The resulting documentation- complex is a centralised scientific of the DAI which can be accessed by web.  Data  84,298 (week 51 in 2009) glass negatives are currently available in Arachne. About 44,000 of these belong to the Emagines2 project. A fuzzy meta- search for the character string 'Emagines' results in about 48,000 hits in different categories, including the glass negatives. The glass negatives can be referenced through 84,298 records using image-navigation.

St. Christopher's Home () is a child-focused Christian social service organisation in Hong Kong founded by Bishop R.O. Hall in 1953. It is the largest non-governmental organisation in Hong Kong providing small group home service for children who cannot receive adequate family care.  Mission  The mission of St. Christopher's Home is to create and sustain a healthy environment for children and youths to grow, to develop potentials and to live a life of fullness.  Background  Sheng Kung Hui St. Christopher's Home was founded in 1935 by the late Bishop R.O. Hall in Taipo. It is named after a saint, Christopher, the \\"bearer of Christ\\", who carried the Christchild across the dangerous river. It began as a small orphanage which was taking care of just a few homeless children. In response to society's changing needs, the home has extended its services beyond residential care for children to a wide range of child-focused social services, such as pre-primary education services, children health development services and support for needy newly arrived children from the mainland from 1993.ËÅñÂü∫ÈÅìÂÖíÁ´•Èô¢ÔºçÊúçÂãôÁü≠Áâá2008 Retrieved on 27 March 2010  Services = Residential Child Care Services  Residential Child Care services are divided into two categories, namely the Small Group Home and the Foster Care Service. = Small Group Home = In seeing that many young children are unable to receive adequate care and proper attention due to family crisis and problems, St. Christopher's Home set up small group homes to compensate for what these children lack. Small group homes basically serve three purposes including: Protecting and promoting the health and welfare of children, taking care of their development (physically and mentally) and last but not least, enhancing their potential development, sense of responsibility, self-respect and self-care abilities. This service targets at children aged 4 ‚Äì18, hoping to provide them with temporary 24-hour family- like residential care until they are able to return home or settle down in another long term residential home placement. Small group homes are mainly located in public housing estates including Sau Mau Ping Estate in Kwun Tong, On Yam Estate in Kwai Chung, Cheung Hang Estate in Tsing Yi, Tin Shui Estate and Tin Yiu Estate in Tin Shui Wai and Lok Man Road in Chai Wan. The Home creates a home-like environment for children and provide counselling as well as welfare plans for them in which all of these are done by registered social worker. Moreover, it helps children to develop social and self-care skills and provide tutorial classes for them to act as outside classroom supplement. = Foster Care Service = St. Christopher's Home has established three types of foster care services, each with different objectives to facilitate the functions and underlying purposes of the scheme. Being able to be brought up with family care and support is essential for children's physical and holistic health, hence these services aim at allowing children to grow up healthily and more importantly, enjoy a stable and sound family life for the protection and promotion their welfare and development. Children with special needs especially those who are mildly physical or mentally handicapped children and children with health problems are rendered to special foster care services to accommodate their needs.  Ordinary Foster Care Service  This is designed for children who lacked the basic and sufficient care due to difficult situations and problems that existed in their family such as family financial problems etc. To combat this and allow these children to receive adequate family care and continue a happy family life, they would be placed under the care of foster families until they are able to live on their own, join an adoptive family or their original families' condition allow them to return home.  Emergency Foster Care Service  This is designed for children who are deterred from adequate family care due to family crisis or emergencies among the family such as child abuse. Similar to ordinary foster care service, these children are arranged to foster families where they could receive family care as well as sheltered under a healthy family life. Not until their original family situation allows them to return home or have they secured a long term residential placement will they be leaving the foster homes. Together with ordinary foster care services, emergency foster care services are only eligible for children who are 18 years old or below.  Day Foster Care Service  This service is designed for assisting parents who are unable to take care of their children during daytime due to other obligations such as work duties. Unlike the previous two foster care services, children would be assigned to foster families during the daytime while their parents are away for work and would return home in the evening. Only children under the age of 10 are accessible to the day foster care services.  Services available  * Matching: Arranging foster children to appropriate foster families so that they are able to receive adequate family care and live a normal and secure family life. * Supervision: The Home would also advise, supervise and provide support to foster families so as to ensure the quality of care given to foster children and also the well being of the foster family. * Counseling: Regular visits from the Social Welfare Department are conducted to provide counselling for foster children to monitor their mental condition. Their individual needs would also be taken care of through welfare plans prepared for them.  Pre-primary Education Services  S.K.H.St.Christopher's Nursery (Wan Chai) Apart from providing physical and mental care services for children who are in need, St. Christopher's Home also engage in education provision. The Home launched pre-school education service programmes for children aged 2‚Äì6 in 2006 to enable children in need to get access to primary school preparation. Two nurseries were also established in both Wanchai and Kwai Chung in which each nursery could accommodates around 100 children; providing services to 200 children at their full capacity. Pre- primary Education Services aim at helping children with their development in problem solving skills as well as multiple intelligence, i.e. interpersonal, intrapersonal, musical, logical-mathematical and verbal linguistic skills. Apart from assisting children in their all-rounded development, the Home also involve in education work to train them to become independent, and help them enrich their communication skills when interacting with different people. On top of that, they aimed at establishing a happy and relaxing learning environment for children to enhance their creativity. What differentiates the education services provided by the Home from traditional pre-school curriculums is that its emphasis in injecting enjoyable element in educational activities. Visits to different places would be arranged to arouse students' interest as well as fulfilling educational objectives. Computer and information technology learning would also be included in the curriculum to make it more attractive. In seeing the importance of trilingualism in the future society, the Home also provide programmes to enhance the language and communication skills in Cantonese, English as well as Mandarin. Moreover, the schools adopted the continuous assessment policy to keep track of students' performance throughout the school year. Qualified and experienced pre-school education professionals certified with degree and diploma level in pre-school education would be teaching students to ensure the teaching quality.  Children Health Development Services  Kidsmind Health does not only refer to the absence of disease of a physical body or access to nutritious food, it also includes the well being of a person's mental state and social life. In view of this, the Home has launched a programme called \\"Kidsmind\\" aiming at promoting the welfare and health care of children. = Kidsmind = Kidsmind was launched not only to merely promote the health care of children, but they also targeted at providing comprehensive health information and establishing a healthy living environment for children.Kidsmind official website Retrieved on 27 March 2010 Children aged 0 ‚Äì12, parents and care givers are hoped to benefit from this programme. A comprehensive set of services are available for target groups to enjoy, namely: * Health guidance and training services for children * Health assessment and integrated intervention for children * School-based and community-based health education * Children health surveys * Children health promotion activities * Children health educational kits * Health talks, seminars, workshops and playgroups  Project for New Arrivals  Project for New Arrivals in Shatin With the large inflow of new arrivals (NA), supporting services in all kinds are in great demand. In October 1999, the Home launched the Project for New Arrivals in Shatin so as to provide various supporting services to the new arrival children and their families. Eligible beneficiaries are those NA migrated to Hong Kong within four years. The home provides a loving environment for after-school activities where new arrival children can catch up on their English and computer skills and make friends.Annemarie Evans. (13 December 2005). 'New arrivals learn to adapt in a caring environment'. South China Morning Post. Retrieved on 26 March 2010. The Project aim at guiding NA to adapt to the new lives in Hong Kong, reinforcing family and all kinds of supportive network of the NA, as well as cultivating a harmonic atmosphere amongst the NA and local citizens. The service targets are approached actively in a dynamic way. Comprehensive services are provided such as information for community resources, adjustment programs, support groups, integration programs, counselling and referrals. The project also train mainland mothers in Hong Kong to teach Putonghua and thus increase their self- esteem and sense of independence.Annemarie Evans. (4 September 2006). 'Mainland mothers finding their feet'. South China Morning Post. Retrieved on 26 March 2010.  Clinical Psychological Services  This serves as a platform for comprehensive psychological assessment and intervention service to members of the Home including the staff with professional support. It aims at providing for children comprehensive psychological assessment, diagnosis and intervention service. On top of that, it supports staff through facilitating multi-disciplinary and offering professional staff supporting programs, and providing case consultations and counselling services to them. The Services are extensive programs including individualised psychological assessment and diagnosis, individualised counselling, group therapy, case consultations, skill training talks and workshops and psychological education.  Support = \\"Lok-lok and Yiu-yiu\\" Sponsorship Scheme  The public can provide support to this organisation by simply bringing vibrant colours to the dreary lives of the children by donations. There is a sponsorship scheme called \\"Lok-lok & Yiu-yiu\\" Sponsorship Scheme. Regular donors who contribute at least HK$50 per month or $600 per year would be entitled a pair of dolls called \\"Lok-lok & Yiu Yiu\\" as souvenir. The contributions will be designated for providing accommodation, academic support, emotional counselling, development opportunities and horizon-broaden activities and community support for the children from broken families and low-income groups.  Children Emergency Fund  Children of the Home are facing complicated difficulties due to the growing acuteness of family problems and society problems. This fund serves to provide aid to the needy children of the Home upon urgent and sudden incidents.  Voluntary Specialist Recruitment Scheme  Everyone can lend a hand to children to live a life of fullness by being volunteers of the Home. The \\"Voluntary Specialist Recruitment Scheme\\", recruiting voluntary helpers with special talents such as photography, video production, home design, graphic design, translation, communication, database management, etc. was set up for eagar youths who wish to assist in the activities organised by the Home. Applications for individual volunteers aged 21 or above, who are mature and independent, are welcomed to join in the big family. Also, general donation and charity sales activities aiming at improving the general service quality and expanding further services to the Home are organised. On top of that, designated use of donation according to donor's specific desire or preference are also available within the organisation.

Criticisms  Deerhill Bay In a ruling on 27 January 2010, the Court of First Instance upheld a Board of Review decision that Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui was liable for profit tax amounted for HK$180 million on Deerhill Bay project. This project was launched under a joint venture set up by both Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui and Cheung Kong Holdings in 1993. In return, the church could receive 129 apartments and 94 parking spaces from the developer according to their agreement.Yvonne Tsui (28 January 2010).'Church's HK$180m tax bill for land deal upheld'. South China Morning Post. Retrieved on 25 March 2010. By 2006, Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui had made HK$1.119 billion from the properties' sale. Before the site underwent redevelopment, the land had been occupied by an orphanage, the S.K.H. St. Christopher's Home, for almost 50 years from 1935. In the mid 1980s, the Hong Kong government decided the reallocation of the home. In the appeal, Anthony Neoh SC, for the church, claimed that all the received money coming from the Deerhill Bay project had been used for charitable purposes only. However, the court held that the church had failed to prove it. The Hong Kong Council of Social Service says that it is necessary for all government-subsidized non- government organisations to return audit reports to the Social Welfare Department every year and Deerhill Bay's case served as an important reminder to all welfare groups. In addition, The profit generated has to be used for charity to qualify for tax exemption.Loretta Fong (21 January 2010).'Church fights HK$180m tax bill in court'. South China Morning Post.

A number of Excel-branded feeder routes are provided at the eastern end of the X1, including the X2, X21 and X22 via Beccles and the X11 to Belton. In the year up to April 2009, the route saw a 15% increase in passenger numbers compared to the previous year.East Anglian service sees rising patronage  TXNews In 2013, the service received brand new buses in the form of high-specification Alexander Dennis Enviro400 double-deckers. excel and X1=Route and Frequency The combined route is about 107 miles in length, mostly following the A47 road and only stopping at major interchange points in urban areas. In total, from Lowestoft to Peterborough the journey time is around 4 hours and 45 minutes. Since July 2014, the route has been made up of two sections. Whereas before, buses would run the entirety of the route, services now operate between Peterborough & Norwich (excel) and Norwich & Lowestoft (X1) separately, with all services in both directions terminating at Norwich Bus Station. Passengers travelling further have to change. At that time, the 'splitting' of the route was temporary, and was introduced in order to ease delays while major long term roadworks are carried out on the A47 at Postwick, east of Norwich. From February 2018, the splitting was reintroduced as a permanent measure for operational reasons. There is a different frequency on each section of the route. In general, there is a 20-minute frequency from Monday to Saturday on the X1 between Norwich and Lowestoft and a half-hourly frequency from Monday to Saturday on the excel between Norwich and Peterborough. Vehicles The route is now mostly operated by high-specification double-decker Alexander Dennis Enviro400 buses, which were introduced in October 2013 featuring air conditioning, free WiFi and leather seats. The older Wright Eclipse Gemini-bodied Volvo B9TL vehicles which previously operated the main route are now mostly found on the X2, X11, X21, X22 and other related services. In February 2020, 19 new Alexander Dennis Enviro400 City bodied Scania N250UD buses were introduced on the core excel route (Norwich - Peterborough).

The X2 operates between Norwich bus station and Lowestoft bus station, as with the X1; however, it stops more frequently and is routed via Gillingham, Beccles, Worlingham and Carlton Colville rather than via Acle and Great Yarmouth as with the X1. The X2 operates every 30 minutes from Monday to Saturday daytimes. Minor variations of the route of the X2, known as the X21 and X22, operate somewhat more infrequently to serve surrounding villages along the route of the X2, including North Cove and Whitton; the X21 three journeys in the morning peak and five in the evening peak, while the X22 runs every hour from Monday to Saturday daytimes. The X11 operates as a variation of the X1, shadowing the route of the X1 between Norwich and Gorleston-on-Sea via Great Yarmouth, before diverging at James Paget University Hospital to serve and terminate in Belton rather than continuing onwards to Lowestoft. The X11 operates every 30 minutes from Monday to Saturday daytimes.

This was the first season where the entire football league became fully professional and Zou quickly adapted to the higher demands of the league where, in his debut season, he made eight appearances and scored two goals. Because of his ability to play in several midfield positions, particularly within left- midfield, he quickly moved up from a squad regular to a vital member of the team by the 1996 league season at Sichuan Quanxing.

The method was popular among Indian astronomers and mathematicians since ancient times. Sanskrit was the language from which words were chosen to write numbers in the bh≈´tasa·πÉkhyƒÅ system. The system has been described as the \\"concrete number notation\\" for the representation of numbers. The number \\"two\\" can be associated with the word \\"eye\\" as every human being has two eyes. Thus every Sanskrit word having the meaning \\"eye\\" was used to denote \\"two\\". All words synonymous with \\"earth\\" could be used to signify the number \\"one\\" as there is only one earth. Concepts, ideas, and objects from all facets of Indian cultural experience - mythological, puranic, literary, religious, etc. - were harvested to generate number-connoting words. As an illustration, every Sanskrit word indicating an \\"arrow\\" has been used to denote \\"five\\" as Kamadeva, the Hindu deity of love, is traditionally depicted as a warrior carrying five arrows of flowers. The Sanskrit word anu·π£·π≠ubh has been used to signify \\"eight\\" as it is the name of a meter with eight syllables in a foot. Any Sanskrit word for \\"tooth\\" could be used to denote 32 as a grown-up man has a full set of 32 teeth. Terms implying \\"the gods\\" were used to indicate 33 as it is believed that the number of devas (gods) is 33 koti. (The Vedas refer to not 33 crore Devatas but 33 types (Koti in Sanskrit) of Devatas. They are explained in Shatpath Brahman and many other scriptures very clearly. ) Single words indicating smaller numbers were strung together to form phrases and sentences for representing arbitrary large numbers. This formation of large numbers was accomplished by incorporating the place value system into the scheme. While decoding numbers encoded in the bh≈´tasa·πÉkhyƒÅ system, one should bear in mind the specialty of the Indian method of writing numbers. The various digits were written from left to right; that is, the digit with the lowest place value is written as the left most digit. The various digits of a large number are arranged from left to right in the increasing order of the place value. This specialty, succinctly indicated by the Sanskrit adage a·πÖk≈´nƒÅ·πÉ vƒÅmato gati·∏•, has been extended to the bh≈´tasa·πÉkhyƒÅ system also. As an example, consider a certain number used extensively in Indian astronomy. Varahamihira (505 ‚Äì 587 CE), an Indian astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer, encoded this number in bh≈´tasa·πÉkhyƒÅ as kha-kh-ƒÅ·π£·π≠i-yamƒÅ·∏•. The individual words in this are \\"kha\\", \\"kha\\", \\"a·π£·π≠i\\" and \\"yamƒÅ·∏•\\" and they denote the numbers \\"0\\", \\"0\\", \\"16\\" and \\"2\\" respectively in that order. To obtain the modern equivalent of the number indicated by kha-kh- ƒÅ·π£·π≠i-yamƒÅ·∏•, the four numbers have to be arranged in the reverse order, namely, in the order \\"2\\", \\"16\\",\\"0\\" and \\"0\\". Placing these four numbers side by side we get the number 21600. Incidentally, the number 21600 is the number of minutes in a full circle. A potential user of the system had a multitude of words to choose from for denoting the same number. The mapping from \\"words\\" to \\"numbers\\" is many-to-one. This has facilitated the embedding of numbers in verses in Indian treatises on mathematics and astronomy. This helped in memorising large tables of numbers required by astronomers and astrologers. The system has also been used extensively in epigraphical inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent for inscribing dates and years. As an example, in an inscription from Kalna, the date is given in bh≈´tasa·πÉkhyƒÅ system as bƒÅ·πáa- vyoma-dharƒÅdhar-indu-ga·πáite ≈õƒÅke which means \\"In the ≈öƒÅka year enumerated by the arrows [5], the sky [0], the mountains [7] and the moon [1]\\", that is, in ≈öƒÅka 1705 = AD 1783.\\" The earliest reference employing object numbers is a ca. 269 CE Sanskrit text, YavanajƒÅtaka (literally \\"Greek horoscopy\\") of Sphujidhvaja, a versification of an earlier (ca. 150 CE) Indian prose adaptation of a lost work of Hellenistic astrology.

The rising cost of health insurance leads more consumers to go without coverage and increase in insurance cost and accompanying rise in the cost of health care expenses has led health insurers to provide more policies with higher deductibles and other limitations that require the consumer to pay a greater share of the cost themselves.  Background  According to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the United States is the \\"only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care.\\" The Kaiser Family Foundation claims that health insurance costs are driven not only by the added cost of health insurers making their profits, but also by rising health costs and administrative costs. In 2004, employer-sponsored health insurance premiums grew 11.2% to $9,950 for family coverage, and $3,695 for a single person, according to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Education Trust. The survey also found that 61% of workers were receiving employer sponsored health insurance. Five years later, Kaiser's 2009 survey found that employer health insurance premiums were $13,375 for a family and $4,824 for a single person. About 60% of workers were receiving employer sponsored health insurance. Less than half (46%) of employees at small firms with 3 to 9 workers received coverage. As of 2008, the percentage of Americans receiving employer sponsored health insurance had declined for the eighth consecutive year, says the Kaiser Family Foundation. From 1999 to 2009, Kaiser found that the insurance premiums had climbed 131%, and workers' contribution toward paying that premium jumped 128%. In 1999, workers' average contribution to the premium was $1,543, and in 2009 it was $3,515. For employers, their contribution was $4,247 in 1999 and $9,860 in 2009. The lower a family's income is, the less likely that they can purchase health insurance, according to 2008 US Census figures. About 14.5% of households with $50,000 to $75,000 in income did not have health insurance. While 24.5% of households with $25,000 or less income went without health insurance. A March 2010 study by the Center for Studying Health System Change, a Washington DC think tank, found that out-of-pocket costs for health insurance premiums and services were rising faster than family incomes. Published in the journal Health Affairs, the study found \\"‚Ä¶After accounting for general inflation, family incomes remained stagnant between 2004 and 2006, while out-of-pocket spending on premiums and health care services increased 8.5% over the two-year period. Overall, total out-of-pocket spending increased, on average, about 5 percent annually between 2001 and 2006, and was similar for the 2001‚Äì4 and 2004‚Äì6 periods.\\" The report found the largest increases in out-of-pocket expenses were for those with private health insurance, including middle- and higher- income families. The study was based on 2001 through to 2006 data. Impacted populations=Pre-existing conditions People with pre-existing conditions typically cannot obtain any coverage, or at best can obtain limited coverage or more costly coverage for those conditions. This situation was expected to be corrected by the health reform bill being considered by the US Congress in early 2010. Currently, those with pre-existing conditions must pay the cost out-of-pocket, and some resort to medical tourism, obtaining treatment in other countries or US regions, to obtain more affordable health treatment. This is especially difficult for those impacted by cancer, heart condition and other serious illnesses where treatment costs can easily run into the tens of thousands of dollars or higher within a few days or weeks. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 21 percent of those who apply for health insurance on their own are turned down, charged a higher price or denied coverage for their pre-existing condition. Among the conditions that be considered \\"pre-existing\\" by insurance companies are domestic violence, cancer, asthma, depression and occupations such as police officer and construction worker. Self-employed The 9 million self-employed workers have a greater challenge than many people to find affordable health insurance. They represent 8 percent of the US labor force, and essentially pay a tax on their health insurance premiums, unlike any other workers. They pay a tax of 15.3 percent of their net earnings, double the rate of wage and salary earners. Low-income families For Americans earning less than $24,000 per year, few have health insurance, or, they rely on government insurance (Medicaid). In this income bracket, more than half of people ages 27 to 37 do not have health insurance. This number drops when people reach their 40s, but even into their late 50s, more than one-third of these Americans are uninsured. When new health reform laws take effect, low-income families will receive subsidies to help them pay for health insurance. These subsidies will paid through higher taxes paid by people with higher incomes. State cost- control efforts * California: On March 23, 2010, the California State Assembly's Health Committee passed a bill that would require health insurers and health maintenance organizations to have same strict regulation that has covered automobile and other types of property insurance for the last two decades. The bill would require approval of some rate hikes by state agencies, and must next be considered by the state legislature. * Iowa: In March 2010, Iowa senior advocates and the AARP asked state legislators to act on a measure that would require state regulators to hold hearings when rate increases are proposed and issue an annual report about insurance rates. * Massachusetts: The State of Massachusetts held a three-day hearing in March 2010 to discuss ways to better control health insurance and other costs. Addressing these costs, Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. JudyAnn Bigby said \\"As we examine all of the causes of increasing health care costs and implement reforms, we must strive to bring premiums down without sacrificing access to care or requiring consumers to pay more out of pocket.\\" See also * Health care * Health care politics * Health care reform * Health economics * Health insurance * Health insurance in the United States * Health insurance exchange * Health insurance mandate * Health maintenance organization * Insurance in the United States ReferencesExternal links * Commonwealth Fund: How Health Care Reform Can Lower Costs of Insurance Administration * Families USA: The Cost of Failure to Pass Health Care Reform Category:Medicare and Medicaid (United States) Costs ","title":"Health insurance costs in the United States"},{"id":"26552000","text":"KWNC (1370 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Conservative Talk format, simulcasting KKWN 106.7 FM licensed to Cashmere.

He also was the publisher of B'nai Brith's newspaper, Jewish Tribune from 1985 until September 2014.B'nai Brith Canada biography of Frank Dimant Dimant was the CEO of Christians United for Israel Canada from January 2015 until 2019. He was, from 2015 until 2018, dean of the Modern Israel Studies Department at Canada Christian College and School of Graduate Theological Studies where he had been chair of the department since 2008. As of 2019, Dimant is no longer associated with the college. Dimant was appointed national chairman of Likud Canada in June 2019. Background Originally from Montreal, Quebec, Dimant was educated at Yeshiva University and at McGill University's Graduate School of Sociology. He describes himself as a \\"disciple of the teachings of Zev Jabotinsky\\". B'nai Brith Dimant retired from B'nai Brith Canada after a tenure of 36 years in September 2014 and was replaced by Michael Mostyn.http://www.cjnews.com/canada/new-ceo-hopes-rejuvenate-b%E2%80%99nai- brith In 2014, Dimant told the Canadian Jewish News he planned to nominate Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper for the Nobel Peace Prize for his \\"moral leadership in the world‚Ä¶ especially when it comes to standing up to radical Islamist terrorism.\\" Diamant's announcement sparked a petition to the Nobel adjudication committee to protest the proposed nomination, stating it \\"would be a disgrace and insult to [the] prestigious award.\\" In January of that year, Dimant and other Jewish leaders had accompanied the prime minister on his first trip to Israel, at which time Dimant praised Harper's \\"unparalleled\\" support for the Jewish state. On July 8, 2015, the Toronto Star reported that Dimant had demanded an annual retirement payout of $175,000, representing 75% of his former salary, which the B'nai Brith believed was too lucrative and would have required the struggling charity to direct fundraising dollars to pay for Dimant's pension. Dimant stated that the payout was approved by the organization's board, however, the Star cited an unnamed source as stating that the deal was arranged with little oversight while Dimant was still in charge. In the year following Dimant's retirement, B'nai Brith Canada put its \\"state of the art\\" care facility for Alzheimer's patients under insolvency protection while also trying to sell it. The project, initiated and led by Dimant, was a $16 million facility opened in 2013 but that had been unable to attract enough patients, due to high fees for patients of $7,500 a month and the fact that it was not designed to be wheelchair accessible; the facility is losing $50,000 a month and owes $11 million to creditors. The Toronto Star article also claimed that other issues left by Dimant's former management of B'nai Brith were a lack of records, failure to always issue charitable tax receipts and poor corporate governance, with approximately 50 people who had believed they were on various boards of B'nai Brith organizations learning that this was not the case, as Dimant's management had failed to file the correct paperwork with government agencies.

History The seal of the Reichszentrale f√ºr Heimatdienst, ca. 1925 The Agency has its background in the propaganda war of World War I. In October 1914 the Zentrale f√ºr Auslandsdienst (Agency for Foreign Service) was established for the purpose of propaganda conducted outside Germany. In 1918 it was complemented by the Zentralstelle f√ºr Heimatdienst (Agency for Homeland Service) which was formed for the purpose of domestic propaganda; in order to strengthen the public resilience during the war. In the Weimar Republic it was renamed as the Reichszentrale f√ºr Heimatsdienst (Reich Agency for Homeland Service). Heimatdienst, which literally means homeland service, may also be translated as \\"domestic propaganda\\" or \\"political explanation/education in the homeland\\". Following the Nazi ascent to power in Germany the agency was dissolved on 16 March 1933. The facilities and staff of the agency were incorporated into the new Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda headed by Dr. Joseph Goebbels and responsible for enforcing Nazi doctrine on the people and controlling public opinion. The Agency was re-established on November 25, 1952 as the Bundeszentrale f√ºr Heimatdienst (Federal Agency for Homeland Service), and in 1963 it was renamed as the Bundeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung (Federal Agency for Civic Education). It can also be translated as \\"Federal Agency for Political Education\\", as in the German language \\"civic education\\" normally translates as \\"B√ºrgerschaftliche Erziehung\\", of which \\"Politische Bildung\\" represents just a sub-category.

Speaking to the Toronto Star, QuAIA spokesperson Tim McCaskell stated that the city manager and staff had ‚Äúobviously done their homework, and talked to lawyers, and not made this a political decision but one that‚Äôs based on a reasonable look at the facts of the matter and of Canadian law... It basically vindicates everything we‚Äôve been saying for the last two years.‚Äù Toronto mayor Rob Ford indicated that he plans to defund the parade regardless of the City Manager report.

By holding our Pride events outside of the parade, we are forcing him to make a choice: fund Pride or have your real homophobic, right-wing agenda exposed.\\" QuAIA's press release further stated that the organization would instead host a community event in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.http://queersagainstapartheid.org/2011/04/15/quaia-to-mayor-find- another-pretext-for-your-anti-pride-agenda \\"QuAIA to Mayor: Find another pretext for your anti-Pride agenda\\" The announcement was generally considered a surprise, even by media that had been following the story closely.\\"QuAIA pulls out of Pride Parade, challenges Mayor Ford\\".

Pride 2012: Return to Pride parade  In June 2012, the Toronto city council voted to condemn the phrase \\"Israeli apartheid,\\" as part of a resolution recognizing the gay Pride Toronto parade as a ‚Äúsignificant cultural event that strongly promotes the ideals of tolerance and diversity.‚Äù The resolution said it slams the term Israel Apartheid for undermining the values of Pride and diminishing ‚Äúthe suffering experienced by individuals during the apartheid regime in South Africa.‚Äù Council votes to condemn use of term 'Israeli apartheid' Pride Toronto's Dispute Resolution Committee, composed of lawyers with experience in arbitration and mediation in human rights matters, rejected a complaint against QuAIA by B'nai Brith Canada that sought to ban the group from the parade. The panel dismissed the complaint, stating that ‚Äúthe activities of QUAIA are not contrary to the core missions or policies of Pride Toronto,‚Äù and that it is ‚Äúnot likely to present images or messages that promote, condone or may promote or condone violence, hatred, degradation or negative stereotypes of a person or group, contrary to the City of Toronto‚Äôs Anti-Discrimination Policy.‚Äù  Pride 2013: City staff reports and further Pride funding debates = City staff reports  In response to a September 10, 2012 request from Toronto city council's executive committee, city staff released a series of three reports on April 9, 2013, regarding the city's anti-discrimination policy and grants policy .Agenda Item History - 2013.EX31.2: Amendments to City of Toronto Anti-Discrimination Policies. City of Toronto These staff reports built on and largely reiterated the 2011 report from the city manager. Regarding the city's grants policy, one of these reports stated: QuAIA's Tim McCaskell was quoted in response saying, \\"The law is clear to everyone except a handful of right-wing councillors: you can‚Äôt ban the phrase ‚ÄòIsraeli apartheid.'\\" Meanwhile, Councillor James Pasternak was quoted, \\"Stopping QuAIA is like trying to hammer jelly against the wall.\\" Mayor Rob Ford‚Äôs executive will consider ‚ÄòIsraeli Apartheid‚Äô group again. Toronto Star, April 22, 2013. It was also pointed out in the media that no such funding restrictions had been attempted against the Art Gallery of Ontario or Toronto International Film Festival, which had also held events at which the phrase \\"Israeli Apartheid\\" was supposedly employed. Finally, the third report in the series from city staff was not publicly released, but dealt with \\"litigation or potential litigation affecting the City of Toronto,\\" according to its author Chris Brillinger, executive director of social development, finance and administration for the city. \\"'Israeli apartheid' decision heads back to city's executive committee\\" .Xtra, April 22, 2013.  Executive committee deputations and motion to defer  At an April 23, 2013 meeting, the city's executive committee heard deputations from 27 individuals, most of whom reportedly spoke in favor of recommendations from city staff. This included one Holocaust Survivor, Suzanne Weiss, who stated, \\"A sweeping ban on disrespectful speech will threaten every citizen‚Äôs rights.\\" Meanwhile, national director of legal affairs for B‚Äônai Brith Canada, Anita Bromberg, argued instead that the parade is not a political demonstration, saying, \\"This is a city-wide celebration. I am deeply offended.\\" QuAIA member Elle Flanders spoke on her experience living in Ramallah for a year, saying, \\"My partner and I traveled every day for six months on a segregated road system; they are known as the apartheid roads because they are segregated by your ethnic identity. Roads for Jewish Israelis, roads for Palestinians.\\" \\"Executive Committee deputation re: QuAIA\\". Elle Flanders, April 23, 2013. CEO and director of Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) also commented on the issue; discussing the usage of the phrase 'Israeli Apartheid' at TIFF, he said However, following a motion from Councillor David Shiner, the committee voted to defer recommendations from city staff until a May 28 meeting, after which the item could proceed to full council in June. In response, Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam was quoted as saying, \\"Perhaps what [Councillor James Pasternak and Shiner] are trying to do is mobilize and organize the opposing side... We have Councillor Pasternak, who is actively trying to defund Pride, who is actively lobbying councillors to swing his way. So this could be the political strategy he needs to defund Pride.\\" \\"Move to defund Pride Toronto deferred to May 28\\" .Xtra, April 24, 2013. In the aftermath of the deferred motion, Councilor Pasternak suggested that instead of facing the possibility of being defunded, Pride should be offered the possibility of additional funding if it chooses to ban QuAIA from participation in the Pride festival.\\"Pride should get bonus money if it rejects Queers Against Israeli Apartheid: Toronto councillor\\". National Post, April 24, 2013. Acknowledging there was reluctance on the part of city council to defund Pride, Pasternak stated, \\"What you do is allow Pride to keep their existing grant and provide a diversity bonus after the parade should QuAIA not participate. So we are changing the conversation to a diversity bonus.\\" Pride co-chair Francisco Alvarez responded by calling the offer, \\"desperate and insincere.\\" \\"Pasternak offers Pride 'diversity bonus' if it excludes QuAIA\\" .Xtra, April 27, 2013.

Biography Raised in an orphanage in his birth town of Bridgend in Wales, Dilwyn John David Lewis studied for the ministry in the Church of England at Kelham College but instead became a clothing salesman before embarking on a successful career as a freelance clothing designer in London. Cardinal Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, suggested Lewis join the priesthood in 1960, but it was 1974 before Lewis was ordained at Arundel Cathedral. When Lewis received Pope John Paul II on his arrival at Gatwick Airport, where Lewis was chaplain, in 1982, he caught the attention of Archbishop Bruno Heim and Cardinal Basil Hume, who saw to it that in 1984 he was posted as a canon of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. Working under Cardinal Luigi Dadaglio, archpriest of the Basilica, Lewis was appointed Vicar Capitular by John Paul II and put in charge of the administration and restoration of the Basilica, which was in an alarmingly poor state of repair and threatened with financial ruin after years of mismanagement. Lewis raised funds for the repair bill, estimated at more than ‚Ç§9,000,000. In addition to assisting with restoration, Lewis organised musical performances and special events at the Basilica and coordinated collaborations with the Church of England, including arranging for the loan of St. Thomas Becket's yellow silk dalmatic to the Canterbury Cathedral and for the celebration in the Basilica of the Eucharist by Anglican priests.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), enacted in 1998, modified the DPRA. Three-tier System The DPRA categorizes services under three tiers, based on the service‚Äôs potential impact on record sales. First, non- subscription broadcast transmissions are exempt from requirements to pay license fees. Second, non-interactive Internet transmissions are required to pay a statutory license established by the Copyright Board. Third, Interactive Internet transmission services are required to negotiate a license agreement with the copyright holder. The DMCA modified the requirement and framework for the statutory license. Criticism While the DPRA expanded the sound recording‚Äôs performance right, performers have still criticized the DPRA‚Äôs comparative inequity because composers still have a much wider performance right than performers.

She was the first woman to serve in the Alaska Territorial Legislature, serving a single term in the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives from 1937 to 1939. Family and early life Nell Scott was born in Marengo, Michigan, ca. 1901. She attended public schools in Seattle, Washington. Scott moved to Anchorage, Alaska from Seattle with her husband Dick Scott in 1923. While in Anchorage, she worked as a legal secretary. They relocated to Seldovia, Alaska when Dick was appointed Deputy United States Marshal in 1934. Political career The 1936 election for the Territory of Alaska Legislature had two females; Scott on the Democratic ticket and Juanita Anderson on the Independent Party ticket, competing for one of 4 available seats in the 3rd District. Alaska in territorial days had only 4 legislative districts; the 3rd District covered an area roughly from the Copper River valley and Prince William Sound west to Bristol Bay and the Aleutian Islands. In this sprawling and (at the time) sparsely populated area, Scott campaigned by piloting her plane across her district and meeting people one on one. She won election and on January 11, 1937, Scott took a seat in the Territory of Alaska Legislature. Scott was the only representative from the 3rd District in this legislature not to hail from Anchorage. She served only one term, then moved back to Washington State for personal reasons. Later life, death, and legacy Dick and Nell divorced, and Nell remarried and was later widowed. The University of Alaska Fairbanks maintains a collection of her legislative papers.

Life Starr was born in Cincinnati. In 1844, in association with John Milton Sanders (1821?‚Äì1877?), he filed a U.S. patent caveat for an incandescent lamp and generator. He appears never to have demonstrated his electric lamp while in Cincinnati. In February 1845 Starr and a business associate, Edward Augustin King (d.1863), set out for England to secure British and French patents for the invention. King described the construction and use of a lamp in September 1845, and British patent No. 10,919 was granted to him on November 4, 1845. The patent described two styles of lamp. In one, a platinum strip (or filament) was operated in a glass enclosure, but was not in a vacuum. In the second type, a carbon strip held between two clamps was enclosed in a vacuum in the space above a column of mercury, in an arrangement similar to a barometer. The mercury column was required because vacuum pumps of the time could not provide the high vacuum needed to operate a carbon emitter for a practical duration. The construction of Starr's carbon lamp allowed the strip to be replaced when it failed, making the lamp renewable. Starr and his associates demonstrated the two types of lamp in England, including a multi-branched lamp with a bulb to represent each of the twenty-six states then part of the United States. However, Starr had contracted tuberculosis (then called pthisis pulmonalis), and died on November 21, 1846.John Wellington Starr . Retrieved from Frognet.net website, 8 March 2010. He was buried in Key Hill Cemetery, Birmingham. Later developments After Starr's death, King and Saunders returned to the United States. It appears neither King nor Saunders could continue developing the lamp without Starr's knowledge. King later was killed while serving in the American Civil War. Sanders travelled extensively but left for Santo Domingo in 1877. As a consequence, none of Starr's partners were available for testimony in the lawsuits surrounding Thomas Edison's lamp patents.

The accusations were apparently started by Philip's daughter, Isabella. The Tour de Nesle was a tower in Paris where much of the adultery was said to have occurred. The scandal led to torture, executions and imprisonments for the princesses' lovers and the imprisonment of the princesses, with lasting consequences for the final years of the House of Capet.  Background  Queen Isabella of England first reported the rumours of adultery by her sisters-in-law to her father in Paris The royal scandal occurred at the end of the difficult reign of Philip IV, known as \\"le Bel\\" (the Fair) because of his good looks. Philip IV was a strangely unemotional man. The contemporary bishop of Pamiers described him as \\"neither a man nor a beast, but a statue\\";Weir, p.11. modern historians have noted that he \\"cultivated a reputation for Christian kingship and showed few weaknesses of the flesh.\\"Jones and McKitterick, p.394. Throughout his reign, Philip had attempted to build up the authority and prestige of the French crown, raising fresh revenues, creating new institutions of government, engaging in wars against his rivals, and on occasion challenging the authority of the Church.Hallam and Everard, p.363. Just before the crisis broke, Philip had been engaged in the liquidation of the order of the Knights Templar in France. By 1314, however, he was financially overstretched and in an increasingly difficult domestic political situation, and some have suggested that his weakened position contributed to the subsequent royal crisis.Broad and Green, p.8. Philip IV had three sons, Louis, Philip and Charles. As was customary for the period, all three were married with an eye for political gain. Initially, Philip had intended for Louis to marry Joan, the eldest daughter of Otto IV, Count of Burgundy, but in the end chose Margaret, the daughter of Robert II, Duke of Burgundy, in 1305, and arranged for his middle son Philip to marry Joan in 1307. His youngest son Charles married Blanche, another of Otto's daughters, in 1308.Wagner, p.250; Brown, p.130. The three marriages had fared differently. Louis' is considered to have been an unhappy match; Louis, known as \\"the Quarreler\\" and \\"the Headstrong\\", is said to have preferred playing real tennis to spending time with the \\"feisty and shapely\\" Margaret.Weir, p.100. Charles, a relatively conservative, \\"strait-laced\\"Sumption, p.101. and \\"stiff-necked\\"Sumption, p.97. individual, had an unexceptional marriage. Philip, in contrast, became noted for his unusual generosity to his wife Joan;Brown, p.130. the pair had a considerable number of children in a short space of time and Philip wrote numerous, if formulaic, love letters to his wife over the years.Brown, p.134. Meanwhile, Philip the Fair married his daughter, Isabella, to Edward II of England in 1308 in an attempt to resolve the tensions of his twin problems of conflict over the contested territories of Gascony and Flanders. Isabella's marriage proved difficult, largely due to Edward's intimate relationship with his close friend and possible lover, Piers Gaveston. Isabella looked frequently to her father for help addressing the problems in her English marriage.See Weir, chapter two.  The scandal  A 19th-century representation of the Tour de Nesle, where much of the adulterous activity was alleged to have occurred, by Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc Most accounts of the scandal begin with the visit of the king and queen of England to the queen's father in France during 1313. During the visit, Louis and Charles had a satirical puppet show put on for their guests, and after this Isabella had given new embroidered purses both to her brothers and to their wives.Weir, p.92. Later in the year, Isabella and Edward held a large dinner in London to celebrate their return and Isabella apparently noticed that the purses she had given to her sisters-in-law were now being carried by two Norman knights, Walter of Aunay (also known as Gautier of Aunay) and Philip of Aunay. Isabella concluded that the pair must have been carrying on an illicit affair, and appears to have informed her father of this during her next visit to France in 1314.Weir, p.92, 99. Philip IV placed the knights under surveillance for a period, and the scandal began to take shape. The accusations centred on suggestions that Blanche and Margaret had been drinking, eating and engaging in adultery with Gautier and Philip of Aunay in the Tour de Nesle over a period.Weir, p.99. The Tour de Nesle was an old guard tower in Paris next to the river Seine and had been bought by Philip IV in 1308.Lorentz and Sandron, p.238. The third sister-in-law, Joan, was initially said to have been present on some of these occasions and to have known of the affair; later accusations were extended to have included suggestions that she had also been involved in adultery herself. Most historians have tended to conclude that the accusations against Blanche and Margaret were probably true, although some are more skeptical.See Weir, pp99‚Äì100 for an argument in favour of the accusations; Hallam and Everard, p.363 for an alternative argument. Some accounts have suggested that Isabella's accusations were politically motivated; she had just given birth to her son, Edward, and in theory the removal of all three of her sisters-in-law might have made his accession to the French throne more likely.See references in Hallam and Everard, p.363. Others have argued that this seems an unlikely plan, given the normal probability that at least one of the three brothers would have successfully remarried and enjoyed a male heir in the coming years.Hallam and Everard, p.363; Weir, p.100. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that Philip IV's unpopular chamberlain Enguerrand de Marigny might have been responsible for framing the knights and women involved.Weir, p.101. Following the period of surveillance, Philip IV broke the news of the accusations publicly and arrested all involved. There are some suggestions that Walter and Philip of Aunay attempted to escape to England but in due course both knights were interrogated and tortured by French officials. Both confessed to adultery and were found guilty, therefore, of l√®se majest√©. Blanche and Margaret were tried before the Paris Parlement and found guilty of adultery. The two women had their heads shaven and were sentenced to life imprisonment.Weir, pp99‚Äì100. Joan was also tried before the Parlement but was found innocent, partially as a result of her husband Philip's influence.  Impact  The Tour de Nesle scandal led to the imprisonment of Blanche and Margaret, and the execution of their lovers. Having been tortured, the guilty knights Gautier and Philippe were then killed; most histories agree that they were first castrated and then either drawn and quartered or flayed alive, broken on a wheel and then hanged. The episode came as a severe shock to Philip IV and some suggest that it contributed to his death later that same year. Isabella was criticized by some in France for failing to stand by her sisters-in-law, although this passed with time; Isabella's own marriage failed catastrophically in due course, with many historians believing that she was responsible for the murder of her husband Edward in 1327 after Isabella's seizure of power in England with her lover Roger de Mortimer in 1326.Myers, p.19. Due to the gap in the papacy between the death of Clement V in 1314 and the election of John XXII in 1316, Margaret's marriage to Louis could not be annulled, and she was imprisoned in an underground cell at Ch√¢teau Gaillard castle. Louis succeeded to the throne later that year after the death of Philip IV, being officially crowned in August 1315. Margaret, however, was still alive but promptly died under suspicious circumstances, possibly murdered, on 14 August, whilst still imprisoned. Louis remarried five days later to Clementia of Hungary, the niece of Louis' own uncle and close advisor, Charles of Valois. Louis himself died a year later after falling ill following a challenging game of tennis.Gillmeister, pp. 17‚Äì21. The ruins of Ch√¢teau Gaillard, where Margaret and Blanche were imprisoned after their sentencing for adultery in 1314 Joan was placed under house arrest at Dourdan in the aftermath of the Parlement acquittal amidst suggestions that she might also have been having an adulterous affair herself, but enjoyed the continuing support of her husband, Philip.Brown, p.138. Philip campaigned for her release, which was forthcoming the next year and Joan returned to court. It is unclear why Philip stood by her in the way that he did. One theory has been that he was concerned that if he was to abandon Joan, he might also lose Burgundy, which he had gained through their marriage; another theory suggests that he was in truth very deeply in love with her. With the death after a few days of the baby King John I of France, Joan served as Philip's queen consort for several years; after Philip's death, she inherited the County of Artois from her mother and finally died in 1330. Blanche remained in prison at Ch√¢teau Gaillard as well for eight years until 1322, when Charles assumed the throne. Upon becoming king, Charles still refused to release Blanche, instead annulling their marriage and having Blanche consigned to a nunnery.Echols and Williams, p.87. Charles remarried immediately afterwards to Marie of Luxembourg; Blanche died the next year, her health broken from the years spent underground.  Aftermath and legacy  The affair badly damaged the reputation of women in senior French circles, contributing to the way that the Salic Law was implemented during subsequent arguments over the succession to the throne. When Louis died unexpectedly in 1316, supporters of his eldest daughter Joan found that suspicions hung over her parentage following the scandal and that the French nobility were increasingly cautious over the concept of a woman inheriting the throne ‚Äì Louis' brother, Philip took power instead.Wagner, p.250. Philip died unexpectedly young as well, and his younger brother Charles did not live long after remarrying after his coronation, similarly dying without male heirs. The interpretation of the Salic Law then placed the French succession in doubt. Despite Philip of Valois, the son of Charles of Valois, claiming the throne with French noble support, Edward III of England, the son of Isabella was able to press his own case, resulting in the ensuing Hundred Years War (1337‚Äì1453).Sumption, p.106. The affair would also have an impact in European culture. Scholars studying the theme of courtly love have observed that the narratives about adulterous queens die out shortly after the Tour de Nesle scandal, suggesting that they became less acceptable or entertaining after the executions and imprisonments in the French royal family.McCracken, pp.171‚Äì2. The story of the affair was used by the French dramatist Alexandre Dumas as the basis for his play La Tour de Nesle in 1832, \\"a romantic thriller reconstructing medieval crimes on a grand scale\\".McGraw-Hill, p.52. The Tour de Nesle guard-tower itself was destroyed in 1665. Le Roi de fer (1955), the first novel of Maurice Druon's seven-volume series Les Rois maudits (The Accursed Kings), describes the affair and the subsequent executions in lurid and imaginative detail.

Biography He was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was a son of jurist Johan Peter Bruun (1810‚Äì1843) and Line Stenersen (1816‚Äì1901). After his father died when Christopher was three years old, the family moved to Vang, Hedmark, then to Lillehammer in 1850. He enrolled in theology studies at the Royal Frederick University in 1857, and graduated with the cand.theol. degree in 1862. He was an open Scandinavist, and in 1864 he returned to Norway from a trip in Rome to agitate for Norwegian support of the Danish cause in the Second Schleswig War. He even participated as a volunteer in the Battle of Dybb√∏l in April 1864, and after being demobilized from the war in August 1864, he walked back to Rome. Later, especially around 1866 and 1867, Bruun began supporting the use of the language form Landsm√•l (now Nynorsk), and was also inspired by N. F. S. Grundtvig and the Danish folk high school movement. He founded a folk school in Sel in Gudbrandsdalen during 1867. It was moved to Fykse at Gausdal in Oppland during 1871 and Vonheim at Gausdal during 1874. In the same year Karoline and Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson moved to Aulestad, which is located nearby. Gausdal became a cultural centre, although Bj√∏rnson later split with this milieu. Bruun's thoughts on education were chiseled out in the work Folkelige Grundtanker issued in 1878.He idealized Norwegian history, and wanted to replace Greek and Latin languages with the Old Norse Edda in schools. At the same time as hailing the Norwegian farmer, he was clear that the farming populace would need to be educated, especially over the next \\"century\\", hence the folk high schools. As a theologian he denounced Pietism, and emphasized the collective (the people) over the individual. He also (unlike Grundtvig) preferred a Free Church over a State Church. Nonetheless, he left Vonheim Folk School to become curate in Kristiania in 1893. He was promoted to vicar at Johannes Church (Johannes kirke) in 1898. Johannes kirke, Retrieved May 1, 2018 He supported the Liberal Party, later the Moderate Liberal Party, but did not fit in here, neither with Johan Sverdrup's constitutional policies nor the Lars Oftedal and Western Norway- dominated Moderate Liberal Party. From 1884 to 1888, during a most turbulent period in Norwegian political history, Bruun issued the periodical For frisindet Christendom. In 1893 he co-founded the periodical For kirke og kultur, and co-edited it until 1908. In 1905 he chose not to support the radical constitutional policies that led to the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. His periodical refused to print his views on the union dissolution. A pamphlet was printed in Denmark and smuggled to Norway. This contributed to him being removed from For kirke og kultur in 1908. Personal life In 1872 Christopher Bruun married Kari Skard (1851-1924). Her parents were Ole Torsteinson Skard (1804-1886) and Mari Johannesdotter L√•nke (1814-1894). She had eight siblings including brothers, Johannes Skar (1837‚Äì1914) and Matias Skard (1846‚Äì1927). Christopher and Kari Bruun were the parents of eight children. Five died of tuberculosis at a young age. Their daughter Margit Bruun (1875‚Äì1958) married Klaus Sletten (1877‚Äì1946) in 1905 and was the mother of Vegard Sletten. Bruun retired as vicar in 1918, and retreated to √òstre Gausdal where he died on his farm in July 1920. His wife died in May 1924. They were buried in the family grave at V√•r Frelsers gravlund in Oslo.

It featured a rectangular projecting entrance portico surmounted by a gable roof. It has been moved twice, altered, and suffered significant deterioration. It was converted for residential use in 1907 to make room for a larger schoolhouse and was moved to its present site in 1989.

The Council reiterated its determination to ensure the security and safety of UNPROFOR and its freedom of movement in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council adopted the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's recommendation to establish three subordinate commands within UNPROFOR: :(a) UNPROFOR (Croatia); :(b) UNPROFOR (Bosnia and Herzegovina); :(c) UNPROFOR (Macedonia). The importance of the peace plan for Croatia was stressed, declaring that non-compliance with Security Council resolutions would have serious consequences. Military attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia were condemned. It also called for a ceasefire between Croatia and the Serbian authorities in the United Nations Protected Areas mediated by the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. The Council stated it was important that confidence was built up by the restoration of electricity and water supplies, and the reopening of restore rail and highways. The resolution went on to authorise the use of force by UNPROFOR acting in self-defense to ensure its security and freedom of movement, deciding to review the extension of close air support to the peacekeeping force. The Secretary-General was requested to report back to the Security Council within two months on progress in implementing the United Nations peace plan for Croatia and the implementation of the mandate of UNPROFOR.

For more than two decades, he was Chairman of the Righteous Among the Nations organization. Biography Vranetiƒá is believed to have been born in 1925 or 1926 in Vrbas, Donji Vakuf, Yugoslavia (present-day Bosnia & Herzegovina) and raised in Topusko (present-day Republic of Croatia). He grew up in a liberal, middle-class, Catholic household. Although his parents were not particularly religious, Vranetiƒá said he was raised to love and respect others. Vranetiƒá began helping Jewish refugees at the age of 17 even though his village largely supported the Nazi-linked Usta≈°e. His first attempt to help a Jewish doctor resulted in a beating by a Croatian soldier which caused Vranetiƒá to lose hearing in his left ear. He went on to help many others find secure hiding places and to supply their needs. Among the refugees he assisted was Erna Montilio, whose husband had been murdered at the infamous Jasenovac concentration camp. Erna, together with her mother, sister, and daughter, managed to escape to Dalmatia. They lived there in relative peace until mid-1943, when the Italians sent all the Jewish and Slovenian refugees there to Rab concentration camp in the Adriatic. In 1948, Erna and her daughter moved to Israel where she married and had two more children. But the marriage did not last. After the war, Vranetiƒá continued to communicate with her and other refugees he had helped, eventually moving to Israel in 1963 and marrying Montilio. He was granted honorary Israeli citizenship by the government of Israel. In 1970, he received his \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" award from Yad Vashem for his work, becoming chairman of the Organization of Righteous Among the Nations in Israel in 1986, a position he held for more than twenty years. Widowed in the late 1990s, Vranetiƒá was honored during a memorial ceremony at the Yad Vashem Hall of Remembrance in 2009 when he and six Jewish Holocaust survivors met Pope Benedict XVI. Death Ivan Vranetiƒá died in Israel on 3 February 2010. Most sources gave his age as 84.Obituary, newsday.com; accessed 27 January 2017.

They agreed to resist alliance with England by the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots to Prince Edward. Historical context Following the death of James V of Scotland in December 1542, his daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots, an infant of less than a week old, succeeded to the Scottish throne. A struggle for the regency between Cardinal Beaton and Earl of Arran was won by the latter. On 1 July 1543, the Earl of Arran entered into the Treaty of Greenwich with Henry VIII of England. Under the treaty, Mary was promised to Henry's son, Edward. The union of the thrones of England and Scotland which the treaty envisaged was controversial from the outset: the treaty's Anglo-centric policy was resisted by many who preferred to continue the Auld Alliance with France. The Secret Bond On 24 July 1543, when about to remove Mary from Linlithgow Palace to Stirling Castle, the leaders of the Scottish-French party entered into a bond drawn up by Cardinal Beaton in which they pledged themselves to resist the realm being \\"swbdewit till our awld enymyis of Ingland\\".

He appears in the chapter \\"The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill.\\" He works for the White Rabbit like his friend Bill the Lizard. Carroll never gives any description of the character other than being a gardener, and his species has been widely debated, with evidence showing he is likely to be a monkey or a guinea pig. When the White Rabbit mistakes Alice for his maid, Mary Ann, she drinks from a bottle that makes her grow. The Rabbit thinks she is a monster, so he asks Pat to climb down the chimney to get the monster out of his house. Pat refuses, so the Rabbit decides to send Bill the Lizard to climb down instead. When Bill climbs down the chimney, Alice kicks him, causing him to fly out of the chimney and back into the Rabbit‚Äôs garden. Appearance An Irishman depicted as a monkey Pat‚Äôs appearance has been of much debate as Carroll never gives any description of the character, so it is unknown whether he is supposed to be an animal, human, or bird. However, there are several theories as to what species he is. Pat is strongly hinted to be Irish, judging by the way he speaks. He says several phrases that could be considered Irish, such as, \\"Sure then I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour\\", \\"Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounces it arrum.)\\". Carroll continues to hint at his Irish roots by claiming he is \\"digging for apples\\". In Victorian times Irish apples was a slang word for potatoes. Pat is also commonly an Irish name, short for Patrick. According to The Annotated Alice, Pat is likely to be one of the two guinea pigs that help to revive Bill after he comes shooting out of the chimney. If this is true, then Pat also makes a second appearance, as the two same guinea pigs are said to be jurors in the Queen‚Äôs court that are suppressed for cheering. A second theory, suggested by David Lockwood, is that Pat is the ape that appears in the Caucus Race Alice In Wonderland, picture origins and the Pool of Tears. This is because Pat is strongly hinted to be Irish, and in Victorian satirical cartoons Irishmen were almost always depicted as having the appearance of apes. Furthermore, in several Punch cartoons of Arabian workers, they were not only depicted as having an ape-like appearance but were frequently given the name Pat or Paddy. However the ape is not mentioned in the text and only appears in Tenniel's illustrations, so it is possible that this is only a product of Tenniel‚Äôs imagination and not Carroll's. Other theories suggest that Pat is simply a lizard, like his co-worker Bill. Many Disney fans confuse Pat with the Dodo, as the characters are merged in the film, though there is no evidence to support the idea that they are the same character in the book. In Disney's animated film  In the Disney animated film, Pat's character is merged with that of The Dodo, who appears earlier in the film as part of the Caucus Race. This leads to the character sometimes being referred to as Pat the Dodo, though this name is never mentioned in the film. In the film Dodo is an authoritative sailor rather than the gardener that Pat is. He is voiced by Bill Thompson. The Dodo is first seen as Alice is floating on the sea in a bottle. The Dodo is seen singing, but when Alice asks him for help, he does not notice her. On shore, the Dodo is seen on a rock, organizing a caucus race. This race involves running around until one gets dry, but the attempts are hampered by incoming waves. The Dodo is later summoned by the White Rabbit, when the rabbit believes that a monster (actually a giant-sized Alice) is inside his home. The Dodo brings Bill the Lizard, and attempts to get him to go down the chimney. Bill refuses at first, but the Dodo is able to convince him otherwise. However, the soot causes Alice to sneeze, sending Bill high up into the sky. The Dodo then decides to burn the house down, much to the chagrin of the White Rabbit. He begins gathering wood, such as the furniture, for this purpose. However, Alice soon returns to a smaller size and exit the house. The White Rabbit soon leaves, while the Dodo asks for matches, not realizing that the situation has been resolved. He then asks Alice for a match, but when she doesn't have any, Dodo complains about the lack of cooperation and uses his pipe to light the fire. The Dodo later appears briefly at the end of the film, conducting another Caucus Race.

Called \\"the queen of the bohemian artists\\", Abercrombie was involved in the Chicago jazz scene and was friends with musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Sarah Vaughan, whose music inspired her own creative work.Warren, Lynn, Art in Chicago 1945-1995, Thames & Hudson, 1996 Early life Abercrombie was born on February 17, 1909, in Austin, Texas. Her parents, Tom and Lula Janes Abercrombie, were traveling opera singers who happened to be in Austin on the day of Gertrude's birth. The family lived in Berlin in 1913 to further her mother's career, but the beginning of World War I caused the family to move back to the United States. Upon their return the family lived in Aledo, Illinois, before settling in Hyde Park, Chicago in 1916. She was raised in a strict Christian Scientist environment at home. She earned a degree in Romance languages from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1929.Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 12. After studying figure drawing briefly at the Art Institute of Chicago, she took a year-long course in commercial art at the American Academy of Art in Chicago, leading to her first job drawing gloves for Mesirow Department Store advertisements. She also worked briefly as an artist for Sears. Fine art career In 1932 she began to focus strictly on her art.Dalati, Sammy. \\"The Surreal Art of the Chicago Saloniste Gertrude Abercrombie.\\" The Magazine Antiques [New York 2018: 48. Web.] The following summer she made her first sale at an outdoor art fair in Chicago and received an honorable mention in the newspaper for the event. In the mid-1930s she moved out of her family's home and became active in the regional art scene. From 1934 to 1940 she served as a painter for the Works Progress Administration and in 1934 the Chicago Society of Artists held a solo show of her work. During the 1930s and 1940s she also began creating woodcuts. In 1940 she married lawyer Robert Livingston, and in 1942 gave birth to their daughter Dinah. In 1948 the couple divorced. That same year she married music critic Frank Sandiford, with Dizzy Gillespie performing at the wedding. The couple were active in the bohemian lifestyle and jazz scene of Chicago hence their connection with Gillespie. They met musicians through Sandiford and through Abercrombie's own skills as an improvisational pianist. The couple would divorce in 1964. Dizzy Gillespie with Abercrombie on his birthday, 1964 Within Abercrombie's avant-garde social circle she was the inspiration for the song \\"Gertrude's Bounce\\" by Richie Powell, who claimed that she walked \\"just like the way the rhythm sounds in the Introduction\\",LP sleeve notes by Alun Morgan for Clifford Brown and Max Roach, I Remember Clifford (Mercury MMC 14041) and she appeared as herself in James Purdy's Gertrude of Stony Island Avenue and as a fictional character in Purdy's Malcolm, Eustace Chisholm. Death By the late 1950s, her health declined due to financial trouble, alcoholism, and arthritis, and she became reclusive. After 1959, her paintings diminished in number as well as scale.Weininger and Smith 1991, pp. 33‚Äì34. She required a wheelchair and was eventually bedridden. In the final year of her life, a major retrospective of her work was held at the Hyde Park Art Center. She died in Chicago on July 3, 1977. Her will established the Gertrude Abercrombie Trust which distributed her work and the work of other artists she owned to cultural institutions throughout the Midwest. Themes Abercrombie painted many variations of her favored subjects: sparsely furnished interiors, barren landscapes, self- portraits, and still-lifes. Many compositions feature a lone woman in a flowing gown, often depicted with attributes of sorcery: an owl, a black cat, a crystal ball, or a broomstick. These works were often self-portraits, as she stated in an interview with Studs Terkel shortly before her death: \\"it is always myself that I paint\\".Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 11. Tall and sharp- featured, she considered herself ugly;Weininger and Smith 1991, pp. 33, 77. in life she sometimes wore a pointed velvet hat to accentuate her witch-like appearance, \\"enjoy[ing] the power this artifice gave her over others who would fear or recoil from her\\".Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 19. Abercrombie also drew inspiration from her dreams as a \\"self-proclaimed\\" source for her paintings to convey reality, but with illusions of fantasy.The 1940s and '50s are described as her most prolific and productive period; a time when she no longer painted many portraits, but retained the themes mentioned above. Abercrombie's mature works are painted in a precise, controlled style. She took little interest in other artists' work, although she admired Magritte.Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 67. Largely self-taught, she did not regard her lack of extensive formal training as a hindrance.Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 13. She said of her work: > I am not interested in complicated things nor in the commonplace. I like and > like to paint simple things that are a little strange. My work comes > directly from my inner consciousness and it must come easily. It is a > process of selection and reduction. Her work evolved into incorporating her love for jazz music, inspired by parties and jam sessions she hosted in her Hyde Park home. Musicians such as Sonny Rollins, Max Roach, Jackie Cain and the Modern Jazz Quartet were considered friends. Dizzy Gillespie described her \\"the first bop artist. Bop in the sense that she has taken the essence of our music and transported it to another art form\\".Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 79.

The company was formed by Stoklasa in 2004, while he was living in Scottsdale, Arizona, but is now based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (as of 2020). It attracted significant attention in 2009 through Stoklasa's 70-minute video review of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. The review was posted in seven parts on YouTube, and was presented by his character \\"Harry S. Plinkett\\" (often shortened to \\"Mr. Plinkett\\"). While Stoklasa had published other video reviews of several Star Trek films before that, his The Phantom Menace and subsequent Star Wars prequel reviews were praised for both content and presentation. Numerous other series have been produced by RedLetterMedia, including several review-based web series (Half in the Bag, Best of the Worst, and re:View), short comedies (The Nerd Crew) and web series (The Grabowskis, Previously Recorded). Low budget features produced by and starring Stoklasa and Red Letter Media affiliates have been largely horror and comedy, such as Feeding Frenzy, The Recovered, Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant and Space Cop. Alongside Stoklasa and Bauman, Red Letter Media also employs Rich Evans as a full-time actor and stagehand for their projects, while he later on got involved in the commentary aspect of the show as well. Stoklasa, Bauman, Evans, and their friends Jack Packard and Josh Davis appear as cast members for the vast majority of their releases. Mr. Plinkett  Stoklasa created his first video review for Star Trek Generations after watching the film again in 2008. Stoklasa believed his own voice sounded \\"too boring\\" for the review and adopted the persona of Harry S. Plinkett, a character he had previously used in several short films (originally played by Rich Evans). The character first appeared in You're Invited! The Olsen Twins Movie, a short film that incorporates clips from The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley, in which the Olsen twins accept a phone call from a man named Mr. Plinkus, a name Stoklasa and Evans either misheard as, or altered to, Mr. Plinkett. Plinkett has been described as \\"cranky\\", a \\"schizophrenic\\", and \\"psychotic\\" with a voice that has been called \\"a cross between Dan Aykroyd in The Blues Brothers and The Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill\\". Plinkett reviews The Star Trek Generations review was met with many favorable comments, inspiring Stoklasa to review the other three Star Trek: The Next Generation films--First Contact (1996), Insurrection (1998), and Nemesis (2002). Inspired by these, Stoklasa created his review for Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, citing his dislike of the franchise's prequel trilogy, and how it influenced a trend of films characterized by CGI spectacle, in lieu of the live-action stunts and meticulously crafted sets that characterized films of earlier decades. Stoklasa has since created reviews for the James Cameron films Avatar and Titanic, Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, Baby's Day Out (which was referenced at the end of the Attack of the Clones review), the children's movie Cop Dog (originally mentioned in a short update video), Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Star Wars: The Force Awakens as well as its sequel The Last Jedi, and the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot. He also created a satirical short film review of J. J. Abrams' Star Trek and later followed it up with a full-length review. Stoklasa has released audio commentary tracks done in the Plinkett character for Star Wars, Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace and Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, which are available for download. He has also created two brief video reviews based on the first two teaser trailers for Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Episode VII), which he notes builds on a previous comment about having Abrams direct a Star Wars film from his earlier Star Trek commentary. In an interview, Stoklasa stated that in creating a review, he and a friend would watch the film only once while taking notes and frequently pausing the film to discuss scenes. After that, he would write a 20‚Äì30 page script for it in the Plinkett character, voice it, and edit it together along with some improvisations. The Phantom Menace Stoklasa's review of The Phantom Menace was published to YouTube on December 10, 2009, and quickly became popular, receiving over five million views since its release. The video was widely linked to by many people across the internet, including celebrities such as Damon Lindelof and Simon Pegg. In comparison to his earlier Star Trek movie reviews, which lasted 30 to 40 minutes, the Phantom Menace review had a total run time of approximately 70 minutes. The review took between seven and ten days to complete. Stoklasa believes that the film has no real protagonist or strong characters in general. He demonstrates this by asking his friends to describe characters from the original trilogy and Phantom Menace without referring to the characters' physical appearances or occupations. Juxtaposed with the colorful personality descriptions they give for the characters Han Solo and C-3PO, Stoklasa's friends are unable to come up with similarly definite descriptions for the Phantom Menace characters Qui-Gon Jinn and Padm√© Amidala. Stoklasa believes that many of the decisions made by Jinn's character are highly questionable. He further suggests that the character is entirely unnecessary to the plot and overall story save to have a final climactic lightsaber battle. He notes Lucas's attempt to add more concurrent plot elements in each of the successive Star Wars films, which he refers to as \\"The Ending Multiplication Effect\\". Stoklasa then illustrates the chaotic and confusing nature of ending the film by pulling together four concurrent plot threads, each with a radically different tone, unclear objectives, and an overall lack of proper character motivation. Reception Stoklasa's reviews have been considered part of an emerging art form that hybridize mashup with video essays, as they use a combination of footage from the movie in question and other related sources. Literary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that Plinkett enacts a kind of d√©tournement by recontextualizing images that would otherwise serve as Star Wars marketing material (such as behind-the-scenes footage and interviews). Defined by Guy Debord as \\"the reuse of preexisting artistic elements in a new ensemble\\", d√©tournement is a way of generating meaning out of cultural texts that is antithetical to their original intent. Kirbach argues that Stoklasa uses this tactic to construct a subversive narrative that frames George Lucas as \\"a lazy, out-of-touch, and thoroughly unchallenged filmmaker\\". Kirbach also argues that Plinkett's popularity can be explained, in part, as a form of catharsis. Because he is portrayed as insane, the Plinkett shtick \\"legitimates our nerd-rage by literalizing it\\". Plinkett enrolls George Lucas in an ongoing Oedipal drama as the castrating father figure, a father figure we are invited to rage against owing to his flagrant ineptitude. But aside from raw catharsis, Kirbach claims that Plinkett's insanity is also a critique of the film industry itself. By fictionalizing his critic, Stoklasa constructs a character who is unable to speak at a safe distance from the text he analyzes. \\"Plinkett becomes the figure of a consumer culture that has been force-fed Hollywood schlock beyond its carrying capacity,\\" Kirbach writes. And further: In an interview with Esquire, comedian Patton Oswalt noted that the Mr. Plinkett reviews are an example of \\"amazing film scholarship\\" on the Star Wars prequels that demonstrate how much of the Star Wars universe is squandered by them. The Daily Telegraph called the reviews \\"legendary\\" and described them as being more popular than the actual films. However, the reviews have also been criticized by Star Wars fans. Stoklasa stated that he feels \\"Star Wars to some people is like a religion so they respond to attacks on it as such.\\" One fan wrote a 108-page-long point-by-point response to the Phantom Menace review, taking issue with many of Stoklasa's criticisms, which Stoklasa mocked in an announcement video for his Revenge of the Sith review. Director Jordan Vogt- Roberts, whilst critiquing CinemaSins' Everything Wrong With ... video of his film, Kong: Skull Island, for bad film criticism masked under the guise of \\"satire\\", praised Red Letter Media for good film criticism and satire, stating that \\"Red Letter Media's Phantom Menace review IS satire. They lampoon a certain type of nerd culture AND their takedown is accurate & thoughtful. Red Letter Media's critiques hold up under scrutiny. CinemaSins just wants to shit on things for the sake of shitting on them.\\" Films Red Letter Media also produces original feature-length films. Among the low-budget features Stoklasa and Bauman have produced and directed on Red Letter Media are the action- comedy film Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant, made in 2005 and available on Netflix (currently only available for DVD rental, not for streaming); The Recovered, a horror thriller starring Tina Krause; and Feeding Frenzy, a 2010 genre-spoof of puppet monster movies like Gremlins. Feeding Frenzy featured Rich Evans as Mr. Plinkett; Evans originated the character in short films, and this feature was filmed before the popularity of the Phantom Menace review. Stoklasa's short films are usually dark comedies. Plinkett, played by Evans, appeared in several of them, starting with \\"You're Invited\\". Stoklasa created and starred in five seasons of the web sitcom The Grabowskis, opposite Dixie Jacobs, about an exaggeratedly trashy and unpleasant sitcom family. Installments of the series were only a few seconds long at first (comically giving more screen time to the lengthy intro than the episode itself), but grew to full episode length over time. On October 26, 2015, the company announced via a short video that it had completed the feature-length film Space Cop, which had been in production for at least seven years. Space Cop stars Evans in the titular role alongside Stoklasa, who wrote and directed the film. It was made available on January 12, 2016, on Blu-ray for $25 through Red Letter Media's Bandcamp page. The first run sold out in a matter of hours. Half in the Bag Half in the Bag is a regularly released series in which Stoklasa and Bauman review films in a more traditional format, albeit with a haphazard and fourth wall breaking overarching plot. Stoklasa has described it as a cross between Siskel and Ebert and a 1980s sitcom, with Stoklasa and Bauman playing VCR repairmen who discuss movies whilst finding increasingly convoluted ways of avoiding their scheduled repair work on Mr. Plinkett's VCR. The show often features Plinkett portrayed by Evans. Tim Heidecker, who hosts a satiric movie review show On Cinema, makes a cameo in episode 37 as the owner of the VCR repair shop who bequeaths employment to Jay and Mike. Stoklasa stated that this series would not replace the Plinkett reviews. The first episode premiered on March 12, 2011, with a review of Drive Angry and The Adjustment Bureau. Graham Linehan praised Red Letter Media in an interview with British comedian and writer Richard Herring on Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast. He spoke particularly about the Half in the Bag review of Jack and Jill, which he described as \\"brilliant\\". Best of the Worst Best of the Worst is a regularly-released series in which members of Red Letter Media watch and review multiple films ranging from B-movies to instructional videos, sometimes sent in by fans. After viewing and riffing on the films, a rotating panel of four sit to discuss what they just watched, typically expressing further contempt or ridicule for what they have just seen, though occasionally offering praise for films that show uncommon quality or effort. Panels typically consist of any combination of Mike Stoklasa, Jay Bauman, Rich Evans, Jessi Nakles, Jack Packard, Josh \\"The Wizard\\" Davis, or special guests. Panel participants then individually decide upon which film or video represents the \\"Best of the Worst\\". Viewing material that is deemed to be insulting, offensive, or especially poor is often destroyed in a creative fashion. Methods of destruction have included dissolving a VHS tape in acetone, forcing a DVD through a paper shredder, dragging a tape around the streets tied to the bumper of a car, and cooking a tape on a charcoal grill alongside cheeseburgers. Canadian visual effects artists Colin Cunningham and Jim Maxwell, who have worked on numerous television series' and feature films, frequently appear as recurring guests. Special guests on the show have included screenwriters Max Landis and Simon Barrett, comic book artist Freddie Williams, actors Macaulay Culkin and Patton Oswalt, comedian Gillian Bellinger and indie film auteur Len Kabasinski. Some episodes feature the \\"Wheel of the Worst\\", in which a wheel is spun to select which films/videos will be watched. Wheel selections are often videos that are either extremely bizarre (such as \\"Dog Sitter\\", a movie made to appeal to dogs), low budget instructional films, educational films and those which have little modern relevance (such as Chinese-language instructional tapes about how to use AOL). Videos featured on Wheel of the Worst are most frequently found on VHS tapes. The Daily Herald praised Best of the Worst for being Red Letter Media's most entertaining series. The show occasionally features other gimmicks to randomly select viewing material such as the \\"Choose-And-Lose\\" and the Plinketto Board. Another subsection of Best of the Worst includes the \\"Black Spine Edition\\" where the group randomly selects VHS tapes which are missing informational or identification labels on the side of the cassette. Sometimes the crew will review a specific film which they have previously viewed off camera and recommend to fans of poorly-conceived and poorly-executed B movies. They refer to reviews of this nature as their \\"Spotlight Series\\". The first of these reviews featured the film Hollywood Cop by director Amir Shervan was released on YouTube on June 21, 2017. In this format, low budget indie movies Suburban Sasquatch, Lycan Colony and The Last Vampire on Earth have also been featured. In 2019, the crew introduced a 'Hall of Fame' for Best of the Worst, intended to represent the best things that have appeared on the show. There have only been three additions to the hall of fame thus far; actor Cameron Mitchell and low-budget films Surviving Edged Weapons and Creating Rem Lezar. re:View On May 24, 2016, the company released the first episode of a new series called re:View. Compared to the company's other shows, the format is a much more stripped down and straight forward approach to film critique. Two members of Red Letter Media sit in front of a red curtain and offer thoughts and insight on a film that they both enjoy. Films chosen for this feature are often either cult classics such as Pink Flamingos, Freddy Got Fingered and Martin, or well renowned genre-defining films like The Thing and Ghostbusters. Clips of the film being discussed are interwoven, typically to lend emphasis to a specific point being made, or to showcase some of the most memorable moments from the film. re:View has also featured Star Trek films and episodes, a particular favorite of Stoklasa's. For an episode featuring The Guest, the screenwriter of the film, Simon Barrett, appeared as a guest and spoke about many behind the scenes aspects of the production. A similar insight into the background of a film the Red Letter Media crew enjoyed was shared in a two-part interview series with Samurai Cop lead Matt Hannon, though this occurred prior to the creation of the re:View branding and format. Former child star Macaulay Culkin made a guest appearance in a 2018 episode reviewing Hackers, and has continued to recur in both this series as well as Best of the Worst. The Nerd Crew: A Pop Culture Podcast The first episode being uploaded to YouTube on 5 January 2017, The Nerd Crew parodies pop culture \\"fanboyism\\" and video series such as Screen Junkies, Collider, and The John Campea Show, with Stoklasa, Bauman and Evans playing \\"manchildren\\" demonstrating excessive enthusiasm over Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe and other content aimed primarily at a juvenile audience. Product placement, native advertising and general subservience to entertainment mega-corporations are all satirized.  Commentary tracks  Since 2012, Red Letter Media has produced commentary tracks for various films, releasing them on Bandcamp. These began with three commentary tracks by Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett, but the company has since released tracks by Stoklasa, Bauman, and Evans as themselves. ;Commentary tracks (listed in order of release) *Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett) *Episode IV - A New Hope (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett) *Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett) *Alien vs. Predator *Samurai Cop *Ghostbusters II *Halloween *Alien *The Terminator *Jurassic Park *Batman & Robin *A Nightmare on Elm Street *Return of the Jedi *Masters of the Universe *Gremlins *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story *The Room *Justice League *RoboCop *Jingle All the Way *Army of Darkness Previously Recorded In July 2014, Red Letter Media affiliates Rich Evans and Jack Packard began a YouTube Video game review channel under the name Previously Recorded or Pre-Rec. Videos from the channel have been featured on the Red Letter Media website alongside other Red Letter Media content, and the channel has been referenced in numerous Half in the Bag and Best of the Worst episodes. On July 22, 2018, the duo announced that they would be broadcasting their final live stream on July 25, 2018 and then the channel would be put on hold for the foreseeable future afterwards.

He traveled with his father, mother and brother, Wrestling, on the Mayflower reaching what became the Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1620. Brewster had two sisters, Patience and Fear, and two brothers, Jonathan and Wrestling, along with an unnamed sister who died young. He was a founder of the town of Bridgewater, Plymouth County, Massachusetts. Biography=Early life Love BrewsterMerrick, p. 4Merrick, pp. 14‚Äì15 was born at Leiden, Holland, circa 1611, although no birth records have been found, and died at Duxbury, Massachusetts, sometime between October 6, 1650, and the \\"last day\\" of January 1651. This latter date is based on the date of his will and when the inventory of his estate was taken. He was the son of Elder William Brewster, (ca. 1567 ‚Äì April 10, 1644), the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony and his wife, Mary. At the age of nine, he traveled with his father, mother and brother, Wrestling, on the Mayflower to Plymouth, Massachusetts.Jones, pp. 26‚Äì33 Marriage He married Sarah Collier at Plymouth, Massachusetts, on May 15, 1634.Jones, p. 26Merrick, p. 14 Sarah was baptized on April 30, 1616, at St Olave's Church, in the parish of Southwark St Olave, an area of south-east London in the London Borough of Southwark, England, and died on April 26, 1691 at Duxbury, Massachusetts. She was a daughter of Jane Clark and William Collier, one of the investors, or Merchant Adventurers, and an initial shareholder in the Plymouth Colony. She was the sister of Mary Collier, the wife of Thomas Prence, a co-founder of Eastham, Massachusetts, a political leader in both the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies, and governor of Plymouth (1634, 1638, and 1657‚Äì73). Thomas' first wife, Patience Brewster, was a sister of Love's. Sarah, Love's widow, married sometime after September 1, 1656, Richard Parke of Cambridge, Massachusetts,Parks, pp. 25‚Äì30 and he died there in 1665. He also gave her a life's interest in his estate, which was later sold to Thomas Parke in 1678.Jones, p. 27 Career He was admitted a Freeman of the Colony on March 2, 1635/1636, which granted him the right to own land and to vote. Love and Sarah settled in Duxbury, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, around 1636/7 next door to his father. Love was a successful farmer through his adult life. He served in the Pequot War as a volunteer in 1637, and was a member of Captain Myles Standish's Duxbury Company in 1643. He served on the grand jury from Duxbury in 1648 and was one of the founders of Bridgewater, Massachusetts, although it is believed that he never lived there. Death He died about January 1650/1 in Duxbury, Massachusetts. Governor William Bradford reported that \\"Love lived till this year 1650 and dyed, & left 4 children, now living\\". He was probably buried in Duxbury, but his place of burial is unknown.Love Brewster at Find A Grave Children Love Brewster and Sarah Collier had four children:Jones, pp. 30‚Äì33 *Sarah, born ca. 1635 *Nathaniel, called \\"eldest son,\\" born ca. 1637 *William, born ca. 1645William Brewster at Find A Grave *Wrestling, died 1 January 1696/7, married Mary; eight children: 1) Mary (born 10 February 1678/9), 2) Sarah, 3) Abigail, 4) Jonathan, 5) Hannah, 6) Elizabeth, 7) Wrestling (born 4 August 1695), 8) JohnThe Brewster genealogy, 1566-1907; a record of the descendants of William Brewster of the \\"Mayflower.\\" ruling elder of the Pilgrim church which founded Plymouth colony in 1620, Emma C Brewster Jones, The Grafton Press, New York, 1908 Descendants Love and Sarah's descendants number in the thousands today.

East Timor and Indonesia Action Network In November 2010, the Congress of the KNPB elected Buchtar Tabuni as chairman, Augustine Trapen as Secretary, Mako Tabuni as Vice-Chairman, and Victor Yeimo as International Spokesperson. KNPB branches were established in almost all regions of West Papua. The KNPB has also representatives in Jakarta and Manado. The KNPB has a strong international network. Buchtar Tabuni and Victor Yeimo were both arrested and sentenced to three years' imprisonment charged with incitement and a breach of the security of the state of Indonesia. In 2011 Buchtar was again imprisoned, charged with destroying prison property, while in custody. His deputy, Mako Tabuni, was assassinated on 14 June 2012 by plain cloth police officers, members of the anti terrorist unit Densus 88. Victor Yeimo succeeded Buchtar Tabuni as chairman, but went immediately in hiding as the police was also after him. The KNPB has been successful in mobilizing thousands of people in almost all regions of West Papua. On 2 August 2011, the ILWP organized a Conference to seek legal ways to resolve the political status of West Papua. The present status is considered illegal as the population never was enabled to exercise the right to self- determination to which it was entitled according to international treaties, which were supervised by the UN.

Description A brown and white speckled lizard with an orange-yellow dewlap, made of erectile cartilage, that extends from their throat. Their toes are covered with structures that allow them to cling to many different surfaces using the van der Waals force. Their tails have the ability to break off at special segments in order to escape predators or fights. The tail itself continues to wriggle strongly for some minutes after detaching. This ability is known as autotomy. The anoles are also diurnal, which means that they are active during the daytime. Behavior They are athletic creatures that run fast, and jump many times their length. They can also climb straight up almost any surface at blinding speed. They usually sit downward. Seeing a potential prey they dart down towards it. They display their dewlap and bob their head to attract sexual partners and to mark their territory. They feed on spiders and insects like cockroaches and mosquitoes.

He was named the best goalkeeper of the English Football League several years in a row starting with the initial season of 1888‚Äì89, when he was part of the unbeaten Preston North End team nicknamed \\"The Invincibles\\".Fu√üball-Weltzeitschrift No. 10, Jan/Feb 1988. Football Career James Trainer, a time‚Äìserved coachbuilder played his first senior match for a Wrexham club and before long had established a reputation as an excellent goalkeeper. He left the 'Robins' under a cloud, following a particularly rough FA Cup tie against Oswestry in December 1883. He was alleged to have insulted the referee and the FA banned Wrexham from the competition and reported Trainer's offence to the Football Association of Wales. After a spell with Great Lever, he joined Bolton Wanderers in 1884. He went on to appear in a number of pre‚ÄìLeague games for the Wanderers and his form earned him international recognition when he played for Wales against Scotland in 1887. Trainer enjoyed his greatest success at Preston North End as a member of the 'Invincibles'. Curiously he had impressed North End while playing for Bolton at Deepdale, the home of Preston North End, in a match in which he let in 12 goals. He first appeared for North End in August 1887 on a short tour of Scotland. Although he was on the losing side against Hibernian, it was another eight months before he tasted defeat again. Trainer sharpened up his catching ability by playing for the club's baseball team and in North End's pre‚ÄìLeague days was known to 'wear a mackintosh' and 'shelter under an umbrella' during a game. Jimmy Trainer made his League debut on 8 September 1888 in goal for Preston North End against Burnley at Deepdale. Preston won 5-2. Jimmy Trainer played 20 of Preston' 22 League Championship matches and as a goalkeeper played in a Preston North End defence that achieved 12 clean-sheets and restricted the opposition to one‚ÄìLeague‚Äìgoal‚Äìin‚Äìa‚Äìmatch on three separate occasions. Jimmy Trainer assisted Preston North End to be 1888‚Äì89 League Champions. Preston North End went onto win the 1889 FA Cup and complete the first‚Äìever double. However, in 1888 Preston practiced what is common practive now. The No:2 goalkeeper played in FA Cup ties and so Trainer did not play in the 1889 FA Cup campaign. (registration & fee required) Between 1888 and 1897 Trainer played in 253 games for Preston, and after retiring he became landlord of the Lamb Hotel in Preston. He later moved to London, where his business failed. He died in poverty in 1915.

Transliteration of Arabic is notoriously fraught with challenges, even before differences between Arabic's many dialects are taken into account. () is an apricot juice or nectar beverage that is typically consumed during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. It is believed to be from Syria. It was first produced in the Ghouta, where the variety of apricots most suitable for qamar al-din was first grown. Qamar al-din is enjoyed across the Middle East and North Africa as well as in Somalia, though Syrian qamar al-din is still believed to be the best because the variety of apricots most suitable for making qamar al- din grow only in Syria and southwestern Turkey. Etymology Several theories have been proposed for the origin of qamar al-din's name. One theory holds that it was named for its inventor, a Syrian man named Qamar al-Din. He was said to have been so handsome that he resembled the moon (qamar, ), hence his name. Another theory holds that apricot season coincided with the sighting of the new moon marking the beginning of Ramadan in the year when qamar al-din was invented. A similar theory, widespread in Egypt, traces the name's origin to a Caliph who was known to celebrate with qamar al-din upon seeing the crescent moon during Ramadan. Dried apricot paste for making Qamar Addin. Method of preparation To produce Qamar al-din, apricots and sugar are boiled over a fire and then strained through a wooden strainer that is soaked in olive oil. The apricots are then left to dry in direct sunlight. Once it has completely dried, it is then packaged, shipped, and sold. This dried apricot leather is thicker, more consistent, and has a stronger flavor than ordinary apricot leather, and is thus more suitable for making qamar al-din. Making the drink from this apricot leather only requires adding rosewater or orange blossom water, though apricot pieces (fresh or dried) and ice are often added as well. Sometimes, some of the floral water is replaced with orange juice or plain water. Qamar al-din is traditionally served thick and cold, and it is believed to be especially fortifying and a good source of energy, electrolytes, and hydration, all of which are crucial after a day of fasting. Some in the Levant add pine nuts and ice to their qamar al-din, making a beverage that resembles a thicker, apricot-flavored version of jallab. The Iranian variety, lavƒÅshak, is prepared by heating seeded fruits with some water until they form a pur√©e and then passed through a sieve to dispose of any fruit peel. The pur√©e is then heated further to form a thicker paste and consequently left in the sun to dry out and served after a few days. Traditionally lavƒÅshak is made from plums or apricot however modern and commercial varieties may use apple, pomegranate, cherry, barberry and Cornelian cherries as the fruit base.

Gameplay  Players have only three lives to complete six exams in each of six difficulty stages; players can start at any difficulty of their choice, including: *Patrolman *Sergeant *Detective *Captain *Chief *Commissioner Each exam is a mini-game with a goal for the player(s) to reach, usually a certain number of points, and test some aspect of the players' skills such as visual acuity, precision, marksmanship, timing, memory, and judgment. However, not only can players be penalized for shooting incorrect targets as instructed against, but players will also lose lives by either failing to reach these quotas and/or failing to complete a task during the exam (e.g., not defusing all C4 or letting the guards hit the player). Moreover, in order to complete the competition exams (in a 2-player game), both players must each lose one life. If players fail an exam, they can either try the same exam again or select another from the menu. Completion of an exam allows the player(s) to continue playing until they complete the entire stage.

With the outbreak of war, Summers mobilized into the British Army, gaining experiences that would serve him well later as a filmmaker. At war‚Äôs end, Summers worked briefly for Cecil Hepworth, and then the Territorial Unit in India before making contact with producer/director George B. Samuelson. Samuelson hired Summers as a writer, primarily on films starring the popular actress Lillian Hall-Davis such as Maisie‚Äôs Marriage (1923). Summers co- directed a couple of pictures with Samuelson before flying solo for the first time with a drama, A Couple of Down and Outs (1923). Summers followed this up with Who Is the Man? a drama which received mixed reviews but is included on the \\"BFI 75 Most Wanted\\" list of missing British feature films and which launched the film career of John Gielgud. Summers fathered two children with his wife Dora Summers: Jill Summers,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1547178/?ref_=nv_sr_2?ref_=nv_sr_2 who also worked in the film industry and was head of make-up at the BBC before her retirement in the 1980s, and Jeremy Summers, who was also a film and television director. A plaque appears commemorating Summers appears on the wall of 10 Parkway in Welwyn Garden City, a house he occupied with his family for a period in the 1940s.https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.8032538,-0.2084502,3a,75y,292.2h,98.48t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjM4CckRYu1t5jPnNImx9GA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192 British Instructional Films Tiring of Samuelson‚Äôs on again, off again production schedule, Summers left and worked on a couple of features for even smaller concerns before landing at British Instructional Films, or BIF. There he directed historical battle recreations that are regarded as his most significant films: Ypres (1925), Mons (1926), Nelson (1926), The Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands (1927) and Bolibar (1928). The Battles of the Coronel and the Falkland Islands was so popular that it was reissued in a sound version under the title The Deeds Men Do (1932). The film was restored and re-released by the BFI in 2014. British International Pictures In 1929, BIF reorganized as British International Pictures or BIP. Summers went into the sound era continuing his string of successes, including Chamber of Horrors (1929, the last British silent), Lost Patrol (1929, later remade by John Ford), Raise the Roof (1930, starring Betty Balfour and regarded as the first British musical), The Flame of Love (1930) starring Anna May Wong and Suspense (1930), a psychological thriller set in the trenches of World War I. In time, however, BIP began to persuade Summers towards more routine material, in keeping with their usual product stream. Burned out, he left BIP in 1936 and worked for a time with a small, formerly BIP-owned unit, Welwyn Studios. When BIP reorganized again as Associated British, Summers seemed to gain a second wind in making his last films, which number among his best ‚Äì Premiere (1938), Traitor Spy (1938), At the Villa Rose (1939) and the film for which he is best known outside England, Dark Eyes of London (1939) with Bela Lugosi. Although all were Associated British productions, the last three titles were filmed at Welwyn. When World War II broke out, Summers enlisted again. After the war he returned to work at Associated British, but made no more films. Summers seems to have lost interest in making motion pictures and drifted away from the industry, and was forgotten by the time of his death.

At this time he was living in and working from a farmhouse on the Yorkshire/Lancashire border. In 1969 he moved to Tintern in Monmouthshire.

Here, where Arnatt was using the camera in a first-order way and there has been some theorising over the extent of his influence on contemporary photographic practice, there still remains an overriding continuity in the form of analytic and self-disclosing interests in his work.Arnatt was consistently ironic in references to photography In late series like Painter‚Äôs Cans (1990), Notes from Jo (1991‚Äì95), and Labels Borrowed/Stolen (1993‚Äì95)Notes from Jo (1991-95), and Labels Borrowed/Stolen (1993-95) recently shown at Spr√ºth Magers, ‚ÄòNotes‚Äô, September 14 to November 02 2013. Arnatt continued to investigate objects with something very close to the type of manipulative detachment originally shown in early works.

In the tradition of MGM's Anchors Aweigh and On the Town, the film tells the stories of three sailors (Rooney, crooner Dick Haymes and dancer Ray McDonald) on shore leave on Santa Catalina Island, California, where much of the film was shot. A former MGM contract star, McDonald was married to Peggy Ryan at the time, with All Ashore being the last film for both of them. Plot Three petty officers have returned from Korea on the battle cruiser , and disembark for long awaited shore leave in California. Skip and Joe have no money due to losses in a crap game, but their shipmate Francis \\"Moby\\" Dickerson has $300 ($ today) he won in poker. Skip and Joe have constantly taken advantage of Moby throughout their cruise and once again beg some money off him. Moby wishes to spend his leave on Santa Catalina but his shipmates take an unwilling Moby to an off-limits clip joint bar where bargirls and a bartender drug and rob them of all their money. Waking up broke and guilty but wiser, Joe is determined to get Moby to Santa Catalina by using his scheming ability. Joe arranges their passage and $5 each in exchange for Moby working on the ship. Skip meets dancer Gay Knight where an impromptu dance session earns them some more money that entertained passengers throw at them. Gay takes them to her trailer park where the three have enough money for two of them to rent a cabin; Moby has to sneak in at night and sleep at the floor. Skip arranges more money and meals for a second day by having Moby work as a waiter in a night club. Moby meets Nancy, the daughter of the trailer park owner, when she hits him in the head with a horseshoe, but Skip later sweeps her off her feet and takes her for his own girl. After entering the wrong cabin and unsuccessfully hiding from the two women living there, Moby becomes further dejected when he feels out of place accompanying his shipmates and their girlfriends to the beach. The unwanted Moby decides to return to the mainland. Having to wait half an hour for the next ship, Moby's luck changes when he meets Jane, whose motorboat is not working. In fixing the engine, Moby is thrown in the water. Jane takes Moby to her father's yacht where his uniform can dry out. She invites Moby to a party and her father, the Commodore, invites Moby to sail with them to the mainland. On the way to the party Jane's boat fails again with both Moby and Jane being thrown into the water as the boat comes to life and motors off without them. Moby gets his confidence back by saving Jane, who cannot swim, and using his navigation skills to get them back to safety in Avalon. Jane's grateful father throws a party for Moby where he turns the tables on his scheming shipmates when the sheriff, who had arrested Joe and Skip, turn them over to Moby where he has them fanning him and Jane in the manner of servants.
