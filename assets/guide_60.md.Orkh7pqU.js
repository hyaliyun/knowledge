He has stated \\"If a President Romney got a call from the president of the LDS, he has no choice but to obey. It is obedience over family and country.\\" PolitiFact.com evaluated this claim by Karger as \\"Pants On Fire\\" wrong, citing examples of the LDS church proclaiming political neutrality and that prominent Mormons have widely diverging political views, both liberal and conservative.

Karger first organized a non-profit group called Save the Boom to save a historic gay bar in Laguna Beach California from the wrecking ball. It failed and closed in 2007. In July 2008, Karger founded Californians Against Hate to serve as a political watchdog of the major donors and organizations working to take away gay marriage in California through Proposition 8. Karger and Californians Against Hate have waged four boycotts of companies whose families gave large contributions to qualify and pass Proposition 8: *Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel: San Diego developer Doug Manchester donated $125,000 to Proposition 8. Manchester owns the Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel, Southern California's largest hotel. Karger initiated a boycott of the Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel in July 2008, garnering the support of local gay organizations and UNITE HERE Local 30, the hotel workers. Hotel Marketing Director Kelly Commerford confirmed that cancellations resulting directly from the boycott had cost the hotel $7 million just in the first 8 months. Californians Against Hate estimates that the boycott continues to cost the hotel $1 million a month. *A-1 Self Storage: Terry Caster owns A-1 Self Storage; he and his family donated a total of $693,000 to Proposition 8. Caster also claims that gay marriage would create a \\"sick society.\\" Californians Against Hate called a boycott of A-1 Self Storage effective November 20, 2008. *Bolthouse Farms: William Bolthouse gave $100,000 to Proposition 8, so Karger and Californians Against Hate began the boycott of the company he founded, Bolthouse Farms.

In retaliation, Karger and Californians Against Hate initiated a boycott against Garff Automotive Group, which owns 53 dealerships in six states. The boycott settled two weeks later when the Garff family met with prominent gay philanthropist and WordPerfect co-founder Bruce Bastian and Karger and promised non-discrimination and donations to Utah-based gay and lesbian groups. = LDS Church and same-sex marriage = Karger has stated that he considers his bid less about winning the presidency, than about getting the LDS Church to end its political campaign against same-sex marriage. He has picketed LDS stores and bookstores. Previously, Karger also filed a formal complaint with the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) against the LDS Church, accusing the church of hiding the extent of its financial involvement supporting Proposition 8. Karger noticed discrepancies between the $2,078 worth of non-monetary contributions that the LDS Church had reported and all the activities that the church had undertaken to pass Proposition 8. Roman Porter, the executive director of the FPPC, announced a full investigation later that month. The investigation examined the church's involvement in providing phone banks, a website and commercials for Proposition 8, ultimately finding the church guilty of 13 violations, which the LDS Church settled by paying a fine. In early 2017 he spearheaded the organization Mormon Tips for evidence against the LDS Church in order to file a complaint with the IRS which could revoke their tax-exempt status.Thank God I'm Atheist, episode #267  Tax Exempt  released 01/09/2017 = Complaint against National Organization for Marriage = In October 2009, Karger and Californians Against Hate filed a formal ethics complaint with the state of Maine against the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), regarding political donor reporting. In response, the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices launched an investigation of NOM. Maine law requires a disclosure report from any organizations that raises more than $5,000 for a ballot question campaign. NOM had contributed $1.6 million to Stand For Marriage Maine, as of October 23, 2009, without revealing its donors' names. Karger has repeatedly called for a Congressional Investigation of the National Organization for Marriage due to its late and non-reporting of its federal 990 income tax returns.  Tobacco advocacy  In the 1990s Karger worked for the tobacco industry to prevent smoking bans in California.  Orange juice boycott  Karger encouraged Republicans to boycott Florida orange juice in protest of the Florida Republican Party's decision to reschedule its primary to January, which upsets the normal primary calendar.

It is located approximately northwest of Lithgow adjacent to the Great Western Highway from Sydney. It is also located on the Main Western railway line at the junction of the Gwabegar line. History The original inhabitants of the area west of the Blue Mountains were the Wiradjuri Aboriginal Australians. It is believed they knew the area as Waller-owang. It is understood to mean place near wood and water, or plenty of water. James Blackman was probably the first European to visit the area when he marked out the route of the new road from Bathurst to the area now known as Wallerawang. In 1824, 11 years after the first exploration led by Blaxland over the Blue Mountains, a James Walker was granted a large portion of land in the area now known as Wallerawang. In 1836 the property was to become known as Barton Park. Two of Walker's convict servants took up land leases in the area in the 1850s, one of them was Maddox who named his lease Lidsdale. Charles Darwin, the English naturalist, stayed at \\"Wallerowang House\\" (later to become Barton Park) in 1836. Darwin describes the countryside around the Wallerawang area and the wildlife including Platypus in his book \\"The Voyage of the Beagle\\". The local school has operated at three sites, in 1860 the first small stone school opened near the present power station, in 1882 the school relocated nearer the township and finally to its present location near Lake Wallace in 1995. The 1860 school, which is still standing, was opened by James Walker's widow. The Church of St John the Evangelist, built in 1881, was financed by private funding. It was designed by architect Edmund Blacket, and is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.

Alfonso and his brother Fernando were candidates for the Castilian-Leonese crown during the reigns of Sancho IV of Castile, Ferdinand IV of Castile and Alfonso XI of Castile. In 1331, Alfonso renounced his rights and swore allegiance to Alfonso XI of Castile.  Biography  When Ferdinand de la Cerda died in 1275, Alfonso's grandmother, Violant of Aragon, took him and his newborn brother Fernando to Aragon. They were kept there 13 years in the fortress of X√†tiva. Alfonso's grandfather, King Alfonso X of Castile, established a division of his realm. Sancho was to inherit Castile and Alfonso was to inherit Le√≥n, according to historian Joaqu√≠n Cuevas Aller. After Alfonso X's death in 1284, the Leonese throne was usurped by Sancho, who would reign as Sancho IV. In September 1288, King Alfonso III of Aragon released Alfonso de la Cerda and proclaimed him king of Castile and Leon. Despite this support from the King of Aragon, Alfonso was unable to regain the throne. In 1304, as part of the Treaty of Torrellas, James II of Aragon and Ferdinand IV of Castile Alfonso agreed to resign all claims on the throne of Le√≥n. In return, he was appointed Lord of Alba, Bejar and Gibrale√≥n, and other manors, possessions and revenues, distributed throughout the Castilian-Leonese territory, in order that Alfonso de la Cerda could not form a large independent dominion. Later, Charles IV of France gave Alfonso de la Cerda the title of Baron de Lunel, a municipality located in the region of Languedoc-Roussillon, France. Death  On the death of Alfonso de la Cerda, his body was buried in the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Las Huelgas de Burgos.

Cymbula adansonii was first discovered in 1853 by German zoologist Wilhelm Dunker. It is naturally endemic to the Atlantic Ocean, specifically on the southwestern coast of Africa. Distribution Cymbula adansonii commonly inhabit intertidal regions of shores. Their habitat zones are located near the western coastline of Namibia, Angola, and South Africa. Geographic information was documented by Wilhelm Dunker in the coastal cities of Swakopmund and Langstrand. The presence of nutrient-rich upwelling across the western regions of Africa is a main factor behind this species‚Äô distribution. As a result of this the western coast has a greater proportion of productivity in comparison to the continent‚Äôs other coastlines. Anatomy and morphology The body of Cymbula adansonii consists of a central apex with a concentric outer crossed- foliated shell layer. Each shell has repeating layers that connect with each other and share a common center. Shells of Patellidae gastropods have various levels of finely detailed structure with multiple layers on each respective species‚Äô shell. The number of shell layers vary from four to six and are classified in regards to the myostracum. Shell layers are numbered m+3, m+2, m+1, m, m-1, and m-2, starting from the edge of the shell moving inwards to the center. The orientation of Cymbula adansonii's inner (m+1) shell layer is radial while its width is narrow. Cymbula adansonii has a cross-foliated center (m-2) shell layer composed of calcium carbonate. Cymbula adansonii has a set of radula that are not visible from its back side. Cymbula adansonii obtain nourishment through a three-part system involving the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Its teeth are small, mineralized, and arranged in a V-like form. Cymbula adansonii has a small rachidian tooth, which is the middle row of teeth in a gastropod‚Äôs set of radula. It has a pluricuspid tooth in its radula, meaning it has several sets of cusps on one tooth. The cusps are composed of the mineral goethite and the gemstone opal. Reproductive biology Similar to other members of the Patellogastropoda clade, Cymbula adansonii employ aquasperm in order to reproduce. The aquasperm consists of a head, mid-piece, and tail. Cymbula adansonii thickens the head and base section of its aquasperm. Feeding Species from the Patellidae family like Cymbula adansonii are grazers who utilize their radula to scoop out and consume food particles and detritus. References * Koufopanou et al. (1999).

It has a fairly high growth rate and a high gonadal output. The larvae are planktonic and settle on the lower part of the shore. They move progressively higher up the shore after the age of about two years. Although adhering tightly to the rock when out of water, when the tide comes in and covers them, they move about, grazing on algae with their toothed radula. Limpets show great homing ability and tend to return to the same location when the tide goes out, often making a scar on the rock. References * Koufopanou et al. (1999).

Life = Origin  Rodolphe Wytsman was born in Dendermonde, Belgium. He was the son of Klemens Wytsman ( 1825‚Äì1870), an Austrian immigrant who was notary and shipping agent, and Emma-Maria Cockuyt (born in Ghent, c. 1838). In 1886 Wytsman married Juliette Trullemans (b. Brussels, 1866‚Äìd. Elsene, 1925), also a painter. During three decades of marriage they resided in or near Brussels, except during World War I, when they fled to the Netherlands.  Early life  Wystman grew up in a cultured environment. His father was‚Äîapart from being a notary‚Äîa numismatist, historian and composer. Among his friends were the Flemish composers Fran√ßois Auguste Gevaert and Peter Benoit and the French literary figure, Victor Hugo. Wytsman's father died prematurely on 27 November 1870 when Rodolphe was only nine or ten. Shortly thereafter, Wytsman's mother moved to her hometown of Dendermonde, 20 miles north of Brussels. In 1873 Wytsman took courses at the Academy in Ghent from Jean Capeinick (1838‚Äì1890), a Belgian painter who specialized in still lifes and rich, colorful floral arrangements. Capeinick, a true professional, also taught Th√©o van Rysselberghe, a Belgian neo- impressionist who was influential at the turn of the century. Wytsman's studies were interrupted by a lucrative job in a yarn shop. After three years, and against the wishes of his mother, he left this tedious occupation and resumed his studies at the Academy, studying under and Julius De Keghel. Wytsman became friends with artists van Rysselberghe, Gustave Vanaise and Armand Heins; the latter remained a lifelong friend. As a painter Wytsman gravitated toward landscapes. His early works‚Äîat this time painted near Ghent‚Äîwere realistic. In the following years he developed a more pre- Impressionist style. By 1881 Wytsman lived in Brussels, where he was influenced by early Modernist Painting.  Brussels  Wytsman's mother moved back to Brussels, where Rodolphe continued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts. He studied under Jean Portaels, Joseph Stallaert and Joseph van Severdonck. His fellow students included Eugene Broerman, Francois Halkett, Frantz Charlet, and van Rysselberghe. James Ensor and Guillaume Van Strydonck were also students at that time. At the Brussels Academy, he came into contact with the artists group L'Essor, founded on 4 March 1876 by some students at the academy. Wytsman's training ended in 1881. By that time he already had exhibited his painting The Night at the Salon of Ghent. Early 1880s Rudolphe Wytsman: Rural Scene (Flemish title: Plattelandsgezicht) In 1882, financially supported by a friend of his late father, he visited Italy, including Rome and surrounding areas, and the Neapolitan coast made an indelible impression on him. Works dating from that era include Fountain in the Villa Borghese in Roma and Rocks on Capri. In Italy, he had friendly contacts with other Belgian artists then resident there: Gustave Vanaise, Jef Lambeaux, Leon Philippet, Eugene Broerman and Alexandre Marcet. In May 1883, Wytsman exhibited together with Vanaise at the \\"Cercle Artistique\\" in Ghent. From 1883 on, he rusticated annually in Knokke, a Belgian seaside resort where an influential artists colony gathered each summer. Regulars included landscape painters from Ghent and Brussels‚Äîamong them Alfred Verwee, Willy Schlobach, Th√©o van Rysselberghe, Anna Boch, F√©licien Rops, James Ensor, Willy Finch and the noted Impressionist Camille Pissarro. Wytsman painted the dunes, the beach, the polders and the Zwin (now a nature preserve).  Les XX  In 1883, Wytsman was a founding member of Les XX, a noted avant-garde group in Brussels, inspired by the art critic Octave Maus. Other founders included Frantz Charlet, Jean Delvin, Dar√≠o de Regoyos, Paul Du Bois, James Ensor, Willy Finch, Fernand Khnopff and Pericles Pantazis. Oxford Art on line : Les XX Until 1887, Wytsman exhibited in the annual Salons of Les XX, but the following year, he and Isidore Verheyden resigned from that group and would not exhibit, even if invited. Wytsman resigned without a stated reason, but wrote that he hoped to remain friends with members of the group. Works Wytsman exhibited at Les XX included: *1884: La Ferme du Moulin (Flandre), Les Fleurs (West-Flandre) & La mare (The Dunes Knocke) *1885: Le Moulin de Knocke, La Neige, a Melle, Fin d'automne, a Boitsfort & La Prairie *1886: La Neige, Pavot et coquelicots, Crepuscule, a Boitsfort, Le Bois, Pluvieux Temps, La mare, Ixelles\\", \\"Coin d'Etang, Soir, Fin d'automne and further: Serie d'impressions and Pastel *1887: Automne, Coin de jardin, Fin Novembre, Le Moulin √† eau, Le canal de Delft, Soir and A Delft.  Marriage  Juliette Wytsman: Spirea It was in Capeinick's studio that Wytsman met his wife-to be, Juliette Trullemans. Soon they were painting together at Knokke and began to see each other regularly. They were married on 16 February 1886. It was an ideal pairing: both painted sunlit landscapes and tableaux with plants and shrubs that were very popular. The two artists' careers melded harmoniously, and the proceeds allowed them to take many trips. In addition to their Brussels domiciles, they had a country house in La Hulpe, southeast of Brussels in central Belgium. They developed close friendships with the writer and writer Camille Lemonnier, the sculptor and painter Charles Verstappen, and the Luminist painter Emile Claus. In 1892, they acquired an estate called Les Tournesols in the bucolic Brussels suburb of Linkebeek. Around their house was a large flower garden in the midst of a largely untouched landscape, which inspired many paintings. Besides landscapes, the Wytsmans preferred to paint bright flowers, herbs and plants, which often appear in the foreground of their paintings, usually with a vista of the surrounding countryside: ponds, marshes, flowering trees, flower beds, blooming heaths and fallow land overgrown with weeds and wildflowers.  Exhibitions  Late in the 19th century Wytsman exhibited with La Libre Esth√©tique, a group of artists who joined after the dissolution of Les XX in 1893. Besides participating in the Triennial Salons of Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent, he organized some double exhibitions with his wife at smaller salons in other cities. Exhibited works includedApple trees in bloom and The village road. After the turn of the century, Wytsman exhibited works in pastel regularly. In 1903, he sent four to an \\"Exhibition of watercolor paintings, pastels, etchings and other\\" in Antwerp, including The heap, The Nut, The road to the Moors and Evening in Brabant ‚Äì October. In 1900, both Wytsmans exhibited in the Belgian section of fine arts at the World's Fair in Paris and the 1908 Belgian Art Exhibition in Berlin. In 1907, a handful of Belgian artists, including the Wytsmans, participated in an exhibition at the Zacheta room in Warsaw.  The First World War  When World War I broke out in August 1914 there was a mass exodus from Belgium‚Äîinvaded by German forces‚Äîto France, England, the Netherlands and the U.S., with a few going to Switzerland. The Wytsmans went to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, which remained neutral through the war. About a dozen other Belgian artists also fled to the Netherlands. The Wytsmans set up an exhibition in Rotterdam's art circle that featured Belgian artists. Discreetly they supported needy colleagues, including the painter and sculptor Rik Wouters. When in 1916 Wouters died of cancer in Amsterdam, it was Rodolphe Wytsman who gave the eulogy. In November 1916 the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam presented an exhibition of Belgian art. Rodolphe Wytsman was in the organizing committee for this exhibition.  Last years  After the war the Wytsmans returned to Linkebeek. The last years of their life together transpired quietly, and they did not become involved in the innovative European art trends that gained ascendancy in the interwar period. In 1925 they together prepared a double retrospective, their last major exhibit. Juliette Wytsman-Trullemans died at home on 8 March 1925, aged 59. Rodolphe survived her by two years; he died in Linkebeek on 2 Nov. 1927, aged 67. Herman Richir: The Tea Hour (c. 1896)  Style  Juliette and Rodolphe Wytsman's technique reflected a realistic pre-Impressionist style. They both sought to depict the effects of intense light in their paintings. Both are among the main representatives of the Luminist genre in neo-Impressionism, and they share the place with artists such as Emile Claus and his students Jenny Montigny and Anna De Weert, Adrien-Joseph Heymans, Georges Morren and Georges Buysse.  Addendum  Rudolphe Wystman was one of the private teachers of the German Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who was mother of King Albert I of Belgium, and who was herself an accomplished artist. The Museum of Ixelles, Belgium, holds a portrait of Rudolphe Wytsman in oil by Jehan Frison, and the painting The Tea Hour by Herman Richir (right)‚Äîa double portrait of Juliette and Rodolphe Wytsman.

The shell is thin, and has fine sculptured lines radiating from the apex which formed the basis for the species' descriptive name, emarginuloides, \\"as if minutely emarginate, or finely notched\\". There are also irregular, concentric growth rings. The margin is smooth apart from the fine crenelations produced by the radial sculpture. The shell is a \\"dirty white\\" colour, with a few greyish concentric bands. Although limpets in the family Lepetidae are commonly known as \\"blind limpets\\", both this species and the closely related Iothia fulva have small, black-pigmented eyes, situated close to the base of the tentacles. Distribution I. emarginuloides is known from Antarctica (the Weddell Sea) and southern Chile. Its distribution is probably circum-Antarctic, with its known range extending from the Kerguelen Islands to the Strait of Magellan area. All records are from water shallower than . It is the commonest animal found living on the red alga Phyllophora antarctica under the sea ice in the vicinity of the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica. References * Linse K. (2002).

These limpets are usually found on the surface of rocks in the high intertidal region Light and Smith Manual, p. 11 (4th Ed., 2007) on the coastal fringes of the north east Pacific Ocean.Marine Biodiversity of British Columbia Description This limpet grows up to thirty millimetres long and is shaped like a low cone with the apex close to the anterior edge. The anterior slope is concave and sometimes overhanging. The posterior slope is convex and has heavy radial ribbing and the margin is somewhat lobed and irregular. The shell characteristics are very variable. The color is usually brown or dark olive with white patches.Eogastropoda: Rocky Shore Limpets Distribution and habitat The range of L. digitalis extends from northern Alaska to northern Mexico. It is a common species and is found among acorn barnacles on vertical rock faces in high to mid-intertidal zones, on both exposed and sheltered coasts. In California, young limpets, up to ten millimetres in diameter, often live on the opercular plates of gooseneck barnacles, Pollicipes polymerus and on mussel shells. In both cases, the colouring varies from that of the rock-based form and provides camouflage.University of San Francisco Behavior On the coast of central California, L. digitalis coexists with the similar species, Lottia scabra, but each occupies a slightly different habitat. L. digitalis tends to occupy vertical rock faces or overhangs and certain horizontal ones clothed by algae and barnacles. L. digitalis clump together more often, prefer wave-exposed areas, occupy sites further up the shore and are seldom found in rock pools. Both species move about freely when the tide is up but L. digitalis settles in a different location at each low tide whereas L. scabra tends to home to the same spot. L. scabra has a more rugged outline and grows to fit the rock surface of its home base. The differences in micro-habitat may be explained by its greater tolerance of exposure to desiccation during low tides in less protected sites because it is able to retain water better. If transplanted to unfamiliar territory, each species soon reselects its typical base habitat.Haven, S. B. 1971. Niche differences in the intertidal limpets Acmaea scabra and Acmaea digitalis (Gastropoda) in Central California. Veliger 13: 231-248. In an experiment, when these two species were caged together with only vertical surfaces available, it was found that L. scabra grew at a much slower rate and achieved a much smaller maximum size than similar limpets in control plots. It seems that the ability of L. digitalis to respond to seasonal changes by moving up and down the shore and utilising resources better give it an edge over the more static species which remains for life in its restricted home range. L. scabra is less able to compete under optimal conditions and is therefore restricted to horizontal desiccating habitats.Haven, S. B. 1973.

Biography Emanoil Catelli was born on January 25, 1883, into a peasant's family from the village of ZgƒÉrde≈üti, BƒÉl»õi County. He was the second child of twelve in the family of Grigore and Anastasia Catelli (his siblings included Vasile, Ioan, Maria, Ecaterina, Melania, Leonida). From 1891 to 1895, he studied at the primary school. Three years later he was admitted to the Lower Agricultural School in Cucuruzeni, and graduated it in 1901. By 1903, Emanoil Catelli worked as a mechanic for agricultural machinery. In September 1903, he was enrolled in the Tsarist army as a second-class military. In little over one year later he entered the Junkers School, where he was taught until August 1907. He completed his studies as a non- commissioned officer. In 1910, he became a lieutenant, and in 1914, he received the rank of master captain and in 1917, he became a captain. In April 1917, he was sent to Odessa for office work, where he was stay at the beginning of the October Revolution. From the first days of his stay in Odessa, he stirred up feeling among Moldovans, explaining the need for Bassarabia to become autonomous. In addition, in that year he became the chairperson of the Moldovan National Committee in Odessa.Gheorghian, Leonid. Basarabia ieri, Basarabia azi. New York Magazin, nr 525, 6 iunie 2011. He actively participated in establishing the \\"Sfatul »öƒÉrii\\" (\\"Parliament\\"), being among the most devoted militants for the Union of Bessarabia with Romania. After unification, Emanoil Catelli was appointed as General Director of Agriculture in the General Directorate of the Moldovan Democratic Republic.Chiriac, Alexandru. ‚ÄûDic»õionar al membrilor Sfatului »öƒÉrii din Chi»ôinƒÉu.‚Äù Europa »ôi neamul rom√¢nesc, nr. 211, ianuarie 1990, p. 22. He occupied this position until November 1918, when the Directorate was dissolved. From 1919 by 1923, Catelli served as a popular judge in NƒÉdu≈üita, Soroca County. In 1920, he became a member of the National Liberal Party, which was in power. In 1923, the Council of Ministers of Romania appointed him as prefect of BƒÉl»õi County. Catelli was the prefect for one year and four months. From 1927 to 1928, he was elected and became the senator delegated by the Balti County. In 1933, the National Liberal Party came back to power again and Emanoil Catelli became the prefect of Balti County. In the three-year period when he was the prefect of Balti County, 49 schools were built (in comparison, from 1918 to 1933 only 44 schools were built), the Normal School was renovated and the new building of \\"Domni≈£a Ileana\\" High School was built. He occupied this position up to December 29, 1937, once the royal dictatorship was established. Of all the prefects of the county, Emanoil Catelli was the most representative personality.Cazacu, Nicolae. Emanoil Catelli: fƒÉuritor de istorie. Cugetul, anul II nr. 20 (37), 31 mai 1997, p. 3. On July 5, 1940, Emanoil Catelli was arrested by the operative group of NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs), forces of BƒÉl»õi for the anti-revolutionary activity, and on 6 August he was transferred to the Chi»ôinƒÉu prison. The NKVD group was afraid of his escape and they proceeded, as usual, in a secretive manner. First, they arrested him and then carried out all the proceedings. An arrest warrant did not exist because there were not enough forms. With the beginning of military operations for the liberation of Bessarabia from Romania, Emanoil Catelli was transferred deep inside the Soviet Empire, reaching Tatarstan. Thus, in 1942 Catelli was brought to Kazan. During the interrogations, Emanoil Catelli said that he did not regret the actions he had taken earlier, and that he would always resist Bolshevism. Family He was married to Paraschiva Valu≈£ƒÉ and had two children, Victor and Octavian, both lawyers. Death He died on February 18, 1943, in the ITK No.5 () ITK No.5 in Sviyazhsk, Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. The doctors stated that the death occurred because of myocardial decompensation, but it is unlikely that the cause of death was established by doctors in the camp.

The apex is a quarter of the way across the shell and the anterior slope is neither concave nor convex. The shell is a mottled grey and tan colour and the head and the side of foot are white with black spots.Eogastropoda: Rocky Shore Limpets The shell size is between 19 and 40 mm and the shell is rather depressed. The apex of the shell has a small depression, a very elongated outline and is located at the anterior third of the shell. In some specimens the apex is nearly central, with a rounded shell. The axial sculpture shows very strong, close, rough ribs with smaller intervening riblets in the interstices. The shell of a young snail is extremely inequilateral and develops rapidly the characteristic ribs. The shell has a white color with fine brown lines between the main ribs. These brown lines dot the otherwise uniform white margin. The principal ribs are sometimes rather sharp, palmating the margin. Occasionally they are small and crowded, becoming faint at the margin.Tryon G. W. (1891).

The interior of the shell is white with darker spots and bars. It shows a white callus, through which the darker spots appear. These take occasionally the form of irregular ghostly bars (which gave rise to its synonymous name Acmaea spectrum - spectrum = ghost). The very strong ribs at the outside and the curiously marked interior, like the print of a hand, are prominent characteristics of this species. Distribution and habitat L. scabra is found on the Pacific coast of North America from Cape Arago, Oregon to southern Baja California. It is abundant in the higher littoral zone on horizontal rock surfaces on both exposed and protected coastlines. It homes at low tide to a specific site where the contours of its shell match the rock surface. It is sometimes found living on Lottia gigantea. Biology L. scabra lives on the shoreline often above high water mark in the splash zone. When the rock is wet it moves about and uses its radula to rasp microscopic algae and diatoms off the rock surface. Over time, using the scalloped edge of its shell, it grinds a groove in a rock until the shell makes a perfect fit. This enables it to remain alive under conditions that would otherwise cause desiccation.Monterey Bay Aquarium Behaviour At Mission Point on the California coast, L. scabra coexists with the similar species, Lottia digitalis, but each occupies a slightly different habitat. L. digitalis tends to occupy vertical rock faces or overhangs and certain horizontal ones clothed by algae and barnacles.

Distribution Nacella polaris is found on the seabed of the Scotia Sea between Tierra del Fuego and the Antarctic Peninsula. The range includes South Georgia, the South Orkneys, the South Shetlands, Bouvet Island, Seymour Island, Paulet Island, Wandel Island, Anvers Island and Petermann Island. The depth range varies from the inter-tidal zone down to though most specimens come from shallow waters a few metres deep. Biology Nacella polaris moves around on rocks and soft substrates feeding on algae and diatoms. Its growth rate is slow and it is said to grow to in 21 years and live as long as 60 years. It is gonochoristic, individuals being either male or female, and fertilisation is external. The larval development has been little studied. Spawning takes place in the spring algal bloom period. Mature adults often synchronise their spawning, forming spawning towers or groups of up to 35 individuals which may persist for a week or more. These structures are considered likely to improve fertilisation rates as sperm flows have been observed to cascade down the towers in calm water situations. Even in moving water, sperm concentrations are higher and fertilisation is more likely to occur. References * Engl W. (2012) Shells of Antarctica.

One of the largest archaeological sites in Clermont County, it is believed to have been a Native American village site during the Middle Woodland period.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 142-143. Site The boundaries of the Gatch Site encompass approximately of land on what was once the farm of John N. Gatch. It has long been known to locals as a productive source of Native American relics; consequently, area residents have collected large numbers of artifacts from the site over the years. Annual plowing increased the number of known artifacts by bringing them to visibility on the surface of the fields. An archaeological survey has observed that the southern and northwestern parts of the farm have yielded the highest concentration of artifacts, including firepits, campsites, and burials. Preservation During the mid-2000s, a nonprofit organization, the Valley View Foundation, began a program to purchase property along the East Fork of the Little Miami River with a goal of preserving portions of the river valley from erosion.Final Project Plan, Valley View Foundation, May 2005. Accessed 2010-04-08. The core of the organization's project was the \\"Bottoms\\" area, located on the northern side of the river west of the interchange of Interstate 275 and U.S. Route 50. This area was once intended for development by a company that purchased the land in the late 1980s; however, after the Milford city government declined permission for the proposal, the company sold it in 2002, and it has since come into the ownership of the city. Located within the Bottoms is the site of the Gatch family farm; in proposing its conservation program, the Valley View Foundation highlighted the significance of the Gatch Site as a leading part of the area's history. Recognition In 1974, the National Park Service recognized the prehistoric significance of the Gatch Site by adding it to the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of nine archaeological sites in Clermont County that is listed on the National Register. Among the other eight is the Clarke Farm Site, which like the Gatch Site has produced artifacts from the Woodland period.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1.

Long considered to be a subspecies of Patella ulyssiponensis, genetic evidence supports its recognition as a separate species.Weber, L. I., and S. J. Hawkins. (2005). Patella aspera and P. ulyssiponensis: genetic evidence of speciation in the North-east Atlantic. Marine Biology 147(1) 153‚Äì162. It is native to Macaronesia. It is known by the common name Azorean limpet, and its local name is lapa brava.Background document for Azorean limpet, Patella aspera. OSPAR Convention Biodiversity Series 2010. Description Patella aspera has a pentagonal, flattened shell with deeply indented margins. It is sculpted with numerous, semi-regular furrows that radiate from the apex, which is slightly forward of the central point. The exterior of the shell is light brown and the interior is white to bluish- white, delimited by a brown band. The mantle is edged with translucent tentacles and the foot is yellow or orange. This limpet has a maximum length of about and a lifespan of eight years for females and nine years for males. Distribution Patella aspera is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It is common in the Azores and the coast of Portugal. Its most northerly limit is northern Scotland, and its easternmost limit is the Isle of Wight. It occurs on rocks and in rock pools in the littoral zone. Ecology This species lives on rocks in the shallow sublittoral and intertidal zones. It is a keystone species which is of ecological importance as a grazer. Breeding takes place all year round, with a peak of activity in the winter, from January to April. It is collected for food. Overharvesting is the main threat to the species, which has faced population declines and collapse of its fishery. Harvest has been banned in some areas. Overharvest is particularly damaging to the species because larger individuals are targeted, and these are more likely to be female. The species is protandric, with individuals being born male and often becoming female with age. The loss of the individuals that grow large enough to turn female leaves the population without enough breeding females.Faria, J., et al. (2015).

It is a large limpet, native to the western Mediterranean Sea, and although common in the past, it is now rare and restricted to only a few locations. Description Patella ferruginea is a distinctive large limpet with a thick heavy shell. It can exceed in diameter, but most individuals are rather smaller than this. The robust, cone-shaped shell has thirty to fifty broad ridges and a wavy margin. The ribs are irregular and sometimes nodular; the shell is often worn smooth or covered with epibiotic organisms such as algae and barnacles. The external surface is cream-coloured or rusty brown, while the inside is marbled white with a dark muscle scar. The muscular foot is yellowish-orange with dark grey sides, and the tentacles are black. Juveniles have flattened shells which are whitish with dark concentric bands and a small number of broad ribs, giving them star-shaped outlines. Distribution and habitat This limpet is restricted to the Mediterranean Sea. In the past it had a wide range in the western Mediterranean, as evidenced by large shell middens formed by Paleolithic and Neolithic hunter gatherers. It is now limited to a few locations in northwestern Africa, one of which is the Al Hoceima National Park, as well as a few scattered locations in southern Spain, Sardinia and Corsica, and some islets in the central Mediterranean. It lives on rocky surfaces in the intertidal zone. It is classified as an \\"endangered species\\" by Spain, and is the first invertebrate, as well as the first marine species, for which Spain has developed a national conservation strategy. Ecology Patella ferruginea, underside This limpet is found in the mid-littoral zone, at the lower end of the zone occupied by the barnacle Chthamalus stellatus and above that formed by red algae, where the gastropod mollusc Dendropoma petraeum is to be found. At night and when submerged, it travels to graze on the film of cyanobacteria and young algae that forms on rocks, returning to the same homing site each time the tide recedes. This spot is discernible because a ring of coralline algae develops under the edge of the shell. The limpet faces predation from the crabs Eriphia verrucosa and Pachygrapsus marmoratus, and the dog winkle Stramonita haemastoma. Breeding takes place in the autumn at about the time of year when the first storms occur, with gametes being liberated into the sea. The larvae are planktonic for a while before settling in similar habitats to those occupied by the adults. This limpet appears to be a protrandrous hermaphrodite, smaller individuals always being male and the proportion of females among larger individuals increasing with size. However, there is some indication that individuals can change sex in either direction. Status This limpet is on the verge of extinction in Spain, where fewer than a thousand individuals are thought to exist. More healthy populations are present in North Africa, with the largest being in Melilla, Ceuta and the Chafarinas Islands, as well as the Habibas Islands off the coast of Algeria. Populations in Sardinia and Corsica seem to be declining.

The oldest hotel in its portfolio, The Langham, London, originally opened in 1865 as Europe's first 'Grand Hotel'. Today, the group covers four continents, with projects located in cities and resorts around the world, including Auckland, Bangkok, Beijing, Boston, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, New York, Phuket, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Sydney and Toronto. The group's expansion continues with its two brands, 'The Langham Hotels and Resorts' and 'Cordis Hotels and Resorts', as well as its affiliate hotels. Langham Hotels International Limited is wholly owned by Great Eagle Holdings, one of Hong Kong's leading property companies, which was founded in 1963 and is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. History The Langham, London Langham Hospitality Group claims a history that dates back to 1865, when The Langham hotel in London opened as the then-largest building in London and Europe's first 'Grand Hotel'. Ten stories and 156 feet high, The Langham featured 15,000 yards of Persian tapestry, hot and cold running water in every guestroom, the world's first hydraulic lifts, known as 'rising rooms', and even an early form of air-conditioning. Upon opening The Langham, the then Prince of Wales hailed the hotel as having \\"everything a man, woman or child could desire under one roof\\". The Langham has since hosted royal, political and cultural dignitaries and celebrities, including French emperor Napoleon III and wits and writers Oscar Wilde and Mark Twain. However, the hotel closed during World War II and after the war was bought by the BBC and used as office space until 1986, when it was sold to the Ladbroke Group (which also purchased the non-US Hilton hotels) and reopened as the Langham Hilton hotel in 1991. The Langham was sold to Great Eagle Holdings in 1995. Great Eagle used the 'Langham' brand to rebadge a number of hotels in its portfolio, thus creating the Langham Hospitality Group. Great Eagle has subsequently purchased further hotels and rebadged them as 'Langham' hotels. It has also moved other hotel brands within its portfolio into the Langham Hospitality Group. Company Cordis, Hong Kong Langham Hospitality Group is a wholly owned subsidiary (as Langham Hotels International Limited) of Great Eagle Holdings. It not only oversees the operations and performance of its own hotels, but also provides professional management services to its developer- or owner-partners. Langham Hospitality Group is the hospitality arm of Great Eagle Holdings, one of Hong Kong's leading property and hotel companies. Great Eagle Holdings invests in, develops and manages office, retail, residential and hotel properties in Asia, North America and Europe. The organisation is also active in property management and maintenance services, as well as building materials trading. Great Eagle Holdings was founded in 1963 with the incorporation of The Great Eagle Company Limited, which was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1972. In 1990, following a reorganisation, Great Eagle Holdings Limited, incorporated in Bermuda, became the listed holding company of Great Eagle in place of The Great Eagle Company Limited. Langham Hospitality Group has an extensive hotel portfolio with over 5,000 rooms, virtually all of them managed by Langham Hotels International Limited. The group's collection of hotels currently in operation includes luxury properties across four continents, including New York, Chicago, Auckland, Boston, Hong Kong, London, Melbourne, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Thailand.

The latest solo show by Mustafa Maluka entitled 'Structural Disbelief: an imposition', deals with the social and political structure of prejudice and the various ways, both subtle and overt, in which people are pre-judged and dismissed because of their appearance. The show tackles the structural disbelief faced by successful, high achieving people who appear as 'others' within particular societies. It also explores fragments of dialogical transaction to which the characters in the paintings are subjected to as individuals who appear as ¬ëother¬í within the societies that they live in.

They settled in farm along the Grand River, outside what is now known as Cambridge, Ontario. In 1948, a local representative for the Canadian department of agriculture needed the family's tractor to demonstrate a new tree-planting machine. As the young Koenig pulled the machine across a field, he noticed a small film crew from the NFB's former agricultural film unit, recording the demonstration. After filming was complete, he approached the men, who included director Raymond Garceau, and told them he loved films, especially animation, and hoped to work in filmmaking. They suggested he send in a job application and approximately six weeks later he received a letter offering him the position of a junior splicer for $100 per month. NFB career Koenig quickly established himself as a multi-talented artist, filming Norman McLaren's Neighbours (1952), animating Colin Low's The Romance of Transportation in Canada (1953) and serving as cinematographer on Low's Corral (1954). Koenig co-directed several historically significant NFB documentaries during, including City of Gold (with Low, 1957), The Days Before Christmas (1958), Lonely Boy (with Kroitor, 1962) and Stravinsky (1965). Along with Terence Macartney-Filgate, Roman Kroitor and Tom Daly, he was also one of the principal contributors to the NFB's Candid Eye series, which was influential in the development of direct cinema. Koenig made major contributions to a range of notable projects. He was also the cinematographer for Arthur Lipsett's Experimental Film (1963) and N-Zone (1970), both admired by George Lucas. Koenig served as executive producer of the NFB's English animation unit from 1962 to 1967 and again from 1972 to 1975. His credits as an animation producer included the Academy Award nominees The Drag (1966), What on Earth! (1966) and The House That Jack Built (1967).

It is commonly known as the snail patella, the pear limpet or the spoon limpet and is native to South Africa. It often grows in association with the crustose coralline alga Spongites yendoi and a filamentous red alga which it cultivates in a garden. It was first described by the malacologist Ignaz von Born in 1778 as Patella cochlear. Description Scutellastra cochlear shells. Scutellastra cochlear has a distinctive pear-shaped shell. It is a slow-growing species and may live for 25 years, attaining a length of . The outer surface is often encrusted with coralline algae. The inner surface is white with a bluish tinge, sometimes speckled with black patches, and with a black, U-shaped muscle scar. Distribution and habitat Scutellastra cochlear is native to exposed coasts of South Africa where it forms dense colonies on rocks on the lower shore. Its range extends southwards from the mouth of the Orange River in the west of South Africa, round Cape Province and northwards to Durban on the east coast. Biology Scutellastra cochlear is an important part of the lower tidal community in what is sometimes known as the \\"cochlear zone\\". Each adult establishes a scar on the underlying rock and occupies this for the rest of its life. This limpet occurs at greater densities than most other species of limpet but that is partly because juveniles often establish themselves on the shell of larger individuals, feeding on the algae and lichen which grow there, until the juveniles are large enough to establish their own scars on the rock. Densities have been found to vary between about 1,700 limpets per square metre and 90 per square metre, with greater densities being present in areas with the greatest wave motion. This limpet has a strong influence on the structure of the community as it excludes most species of algae and limits the biodiversity in its vicinity to the coralline alga Spongites yendoi and the strips of filamentous red algae gardens that fringe each limpet. The limpets do not need to move out of their scars to feed as they can reach enough edible material by rotating themselves in their scar. At low tide, when the limpet is exposed to the air, urea accumulates on the underside of the rim of its shell and diffuses out into the surrounding algae. Here it boosts the supply of nitrogen available to the algae and this increases the algal productivity. Scutellastra cochlear is territorial and defends its garden against other limpets. A marine lichen Pyrenocollema spp. often grows on this limpet's shell, and Spongites yendoi frequently grows on top of this and on the surrounding rocks. The relationship between the limpet and this coralline alga could be considered a form of mutualism. The limpet gets 85% of its nutritional needs by grazing on the coralline alga and leaves it in thin sheets with a damaged surface. The limpet is not present in the north of the alga's range and in these areas the algal sheets are much thicker and flabbier, and develop protuberances. It has been observed that the thin form of the alga grows laterally five times as fast as the thick form and is less likely to be attacked by burrowing organisms, so the association between the two organisms may be mutually beneficial.

It is native to the coasts of South Africa where it is found on the foreshore. It cultivates a species of crustose brown algae in a \\"garden\\". Description Scutellastra longicosta has about eleven long, spiked ribs giving it a star-shaped outline. It grows to a diameter of about . The inner surface is glossy white or bluish-white and often has a narrow black rim. Distribution and habitat This species can be found on the eastern and southern coasts of South Africa. Its range extends from Richards Bay round Cape Province to the Cape of Good Hope. It is found in the mid-to-lower intertidal zone on rocky surfaces. Behaviour Scutellastra longicosta is a territorial limpet occupying a permanent position and cultivating the brown alga Ralfsia verrucosa in a \\"garden\\" which it defends from other herbivores. The productivity of the cultivated algae is about 30% higher than it is when the algae grow elsewhere. It has been shown that Scutellastra cochlear, a closely related limpet, fertilises its algal garden with urea that accumulates round the rim of its shell when the limpet is exposed to the air at low tide and this may also be the case with Scutellastra longicosta. The cultivation of the garden is a form of mutualism as both limpet and alga derive benefit from the arrangement. Larvae of Scutellastra longicosta tend to settle on the shells of larger limpets and the juveniles graze the encrusting alga that grows there. When they are large enough they move onto the rocks and graze on coralline algae before eventually setting up their own gardens. These are established by grazing hard to remove any algae growing on a rock surface and allowing settlement of R. verrucosa, this limpet's favoured food. The algal growth is then regularly grazed and maintained as turf, being fertilised by the limpet's faeces and by mucus. The garden is defended from other herbivores which the limpet pries off the surface with its spines. A limpet can \\"farm\\" an area of about , occupies a scar near the centre, and seldom moves out of this area. Gardens seldom overlap and even though the limpet is encouraging the growth of a single species of alga, there may be greater algal diversity in the area than might otherwise occur. This is because, while defending their gardens, the limpets drive off herbivores from the patches of rock between their gardens, giving algae settling there a greater chance of flourishing. Limpets experimentally removed from their territories and transplanted to nearby locations were found to have homing abilities and find their way back to their original gardens. Various predators feed on this limpet, especially the African oystercatcher.

Early life Jonah Sithole was born in the province of Masvingo and grew up in the mining town of Zvishavane (formerly Shabani), where his older brother worked as a miner as well as a musician for the mining camp band. Jonah first picked up the guitar as a twelve-year-old. When his brother was at work, he would play his guitar, imitating the sounds that his brother practiced around the house. Jonah eventually moved to Bulawayo, where he attended Mpopoma High School until he was expelled in 1969, when he was a form 2 student. By then he was a decent guitar and bass player, so he followed his brother to Kwekwe and convinced him to admit him to his band, the Jairosi Jiri Kwela Kings, as a bass player. A few months later, in 1970, the band got a bar contract in Mbare, Harare and became known as the Delphans. Jonah became the band's rhythm guitarist. Professional career When the Delphans got a contract to play in Gweru, Jonah decided to remain in Harare with the purpose of starting his own band. In 1971, just three months into his first stint as a bandleader, he was approached by Jackson Phiri, leader of the Limpopo Jazz Band, a soukous (also known as Congolese rumba) outfit, to be their guitarist. The Lipopo Jazz Band was anxious to break into the increasingly competitive bar music scene by having a band members who could sing in the local languages. While with the Limpopo Jazz Band, Jonah learned to play Congolese rumba guitar styles. He was particularly enthralled by the guitar stylings of rumba Franco Luambo, but he also began developing the more traditional mbira inspired guitar sound for the Shona songs. In 1974, the Lipopo Jazz Band recorded the song Ndozvireva, which was an adaptation of the mbira song Taisireva. Together with the Hallelujah Chicken Run band's Ngoma Yarira (based on the traditional Karigamombe) and the M.D. Success's Kumntongo (based on the mbira song Kuzanga), the song was one of the first to transcribe mbira progressions onto guitar. Soon after that, the foreign members of the Lipopo Jazz Band were deported, and Jonah found himself playing with a slew of hotel bands with no names: ‚ÄúMost of these bands did not have names. They just had contracts. They belonged to that place. It's only now people realize it's important to have names.‚Äù Jonah played a short stint with the Great Sounds, another outfit that specialized in Congolese rumba, before moving to Mutare in 1974 to play with the Pepsi Combo. Jonah suggested a name change to Vibrations and then Drifters. They played at the Zimunya Hotel, just outside Mutare for about a year before the band moved to Harare determined to land a performing contract. He approached the owner of the Jamaica Inn, located just outside Harare, but a vocalist without a band, Thomas Mapfumo, recently fired from the Hallelujah Chicken Run Band, had talked his way into a contract and use of the hotel musical kit. Since Jonah had a band but no contract or equipment, the two decided to join forces. They performed together at the Jamaica Inn for about two months until they were approached by a Harare businessman to perform at the Mushandira Pamwe Nightclub in Highfield, Harare. At this time, Sithole and Mapfumo were playing an \\"afro-rock\\" rather than the mbira-based style for which they were to become famous. After about three months, Jonah was muscled out of the group, but a few months later he used his influence with a new nightclub owner to rejoin Thomas Mapfumo and form the Blacks Unlimited (1975). Later that year, financial difficulties forced Jonah to part ways with the Blacks Unlimited, and after a second stint with the Great Sounds, he moved back to Mutare and formed a new band, The Storm. In 1977, with The Storm, Jonah released his first single Sabhuku, which showcased Jonah's unique approach to the mbira-guitar style. It was also during the period from 1976-77 that Jonah started specializing in mbira music (Turino, p. 300). It was the authenticity of his chimurenga sound that prompted Thomas Mapfumo to disband his Acid Jazz (with the exception of guitarist Leonard Pickett Chiyangwa) and approach Jonah in 1978 to reform the Blacks Unlimited. Jonah Sithole also played guitar on Thomas Mapfumo's first album, Hokoyo! (recorded in 1977)although he was not officially part of the Acid Band. As Thomas and Jonah moved towards a more mbira-based repertoire, Thomas felt that Leonard Chiyangwa was not improving quickly enough in this new style, largely because his heavy drinking left him struggling with the hours of rehearsal. Leonard Chiyangwa was dismissed from the Blacks Unlimited as a consequence. Jonah played with Thomas Mapfumo and The Blacks Unlimited until 1981, and during this period the two teamed up to craft some of the most inspired songs of the chimurenga genre, including such classics as Pfumvu Paruzevha, Kuyaura, Shumba, Chitima Cherusununguko, Bhutsu Mutandarika, Chauya Chiruzevha, Dangurangu and Chipatapata. It was also during this period that Thomas Mapfumo was incarcerated for three months by the Ian Smith regime for his subversive lyrics. Jonah managed to keep the band going by taking over the lead vocal duties and recruiting a young guitar prodigy by the name of Ashton ‚ÄúSugar‚Äù Chiweshe into the band. In 1981, Jonah Sithole left the Blacks Unlimited to pursue a career as band leader with Deep Horizon.. His highlight single during that time was Kana Ndaguta (he recorded this song a decade later, but the lyric about assaulting his mother when drunk was conspicuously missing from the newer and more readily available version). In May 1985, Thomas Mapfumo was preparing to embark on his first European tour, and he asked Jonah to rejoin the Blacks Unlimited. Jonah stayed with the Blacks Unlimited until 1989, and this period saw him evolving his mbira-guitar sound to unreached heights. This was in part necessitated by the use, for the first time, of real mbiras in the Blacks Unlimited sound. Some of the highlights of this period include the classic albums Zimbabwe-Mozambique (1987) and Varombo Kuvarombo (1989, known outside Zimbabwe as Corruption). Many consider these two albums to be the Blacks Unlimited's best, and Jonah's now mature guitar style plays a big role. Jonah's signature sound is also reflected in massive singles such as Kariba, Ngoma Yekwedu, Nyamutamba Nemombe and Tongosienda. In 1989, Jonah Sithole left the Blacks Unlimited once more, and played as a session musician, notably with the Pied Pipers as well as with the famed 1950s era marabi singer Dorothy Masuka, who had recently returned to Zimbabwe. In 1992, Jonah formed a new band, the Deep Horizon. Sabhuku, a compilation album highlighting the signature tracks from their 1992 and 1993 releases was released internationally in 1996. In 1995, Jonah Sithole rejoined the Blacks Unlimited and performed on three albums;, the afro-rock venture Afro Chimurenga, Roots Chimurenga and the live-in-studio album Chimurenga: African Spirit Music which was recorded during a UK tour. Jonah's health started rapidly failing him soon after. He appeared on only one song, Tipeiwo Mari, on the 1997 album Chimurenga Movement. He died of AIDS complications in August of that year.  Personal life  Jonah Sithole was married to Gladys Maigurira. They had only two children; Tichaona Saul Sithole, born in 1982 and Tendai Sithole, born in 1986. Tendai suddenly died in Birmingham, UK in 2006 and was buried in Harare. He was an aspiring artist like his father Jonah Sithole and won talent awards for best artist in his adopted home of Birmingham. Tichaona is also a music producer and has previously worked on projects with Zimbabwean artists like Jusa Dementor and Juss Russ. Guitar Style While Jonah was fluent in many guitar styles, including rumba and afro-jazz, he is best known for his chimurenga guitar style, where he excelled in the ‚Äúart of combining three- and four-beat rhythms in lyrical, flowing melodic lines.‚Äù Jonah set himself apart from other mbira-guitarists by the emotional expressiveness of his playing, which he achieved by using the mbira or vocalists to develop his guitar melodies rather that by merely accompanying the mbira or ‚Äúfilling in the gaps.‚Äù His album Sabhuku is filled with tracks that highlight his style (Sabhuku, Kusasana, Kana Ndaguta, Ereniya). With the Blacks Unlimited, Jonah's evolution can be tracked by listening to the albums Gwindingwi Rine Shumba(1980), Chimurenga For Justice (1985), Zimbabwe-Mozambique (1987), Varombo Kuvarombo (Corruption, 1989), Chimurenga:African Spirit Music (1995) and Roots Chimurenga (1996). Various singles compilations also feature Jonah Sithole's work from the mid-seventies until 1986. Thomas Tuino. Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe.

Games can now share multiplayer functionality between the Mac and iOS versions of the app. Game Center can be implemented by developers as of iOS 4.1 or later, and OS X 10.8 or later, through the GameKit framework. Game Center is available on iPod Touch 2nd generation and later (iOS 4.1 or higher required); iPhone 3GS and later (iOS 4.1 or higher required); all models of the iPad (iOS 4.2 or higher required); Mac computers running OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or later, Apple TV 4 running tvOS, and Apple Watch running watchOS 3. History Gaming became a major part of the iOS platform when Apple launched the App Store on July 10, 2008. Unlike the console systems that were currently on the market, Apple had no unified multiplayer and social system for their platform. This gap was soon filled by third parties, such as OpenFeint, Plus, AGON Online, and Scoreloop. These third parties had control over the online gaming environment and with multiple third parties involved, it left a non-unified experience. Game Center was announced during an iOS 4 preview event hosted by Apple on April 8, 2010. A preview was released to registered Apple developers in August. It was released on September 8, 2010 with iOS 4.1 on iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch 2nd generation through 4th generation, and is included with iOS 4.2 on the iPad. An updated version of Game Center was released with iOS 5 that featured the addition of turn-based gaming, player photos, friend suggestions, and achievement points. The iOS 6 update added Challenges, a way for players to challenge other players to beat leaderboard scores or earn achievements. On June 13, 2016, the application was removed from iOS 10 and macOS Sierra; however, the service still exists.https://www.cnet.com/how-to/10-hidden-macos-sierra-features-you-need- to-know/ On June 24, 2020, Game Center returned and was refreshed with a redesign in iOS 14, iPadOS 14 and macOS Big Sur.

The synagogue, consecrated in 1877, is the oldest in Melbourne. History The congregation was formed in 1857 under the leadership of Reverend Moses Rintel following his leave from the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation. Initially named Mikveh Israel Melbourne Synagogue, it was provided with a government land grant in 1859 on the corner of Little Lonsdale Street and Stephen Street (today Exhibition Street) in Melbourne's City Centre. A small synagogue was erected on the site in 1860. The congregation consisted primarily of Rintel's followers, including German and Eastern- European Jews who lived in Melbourne's inner-city suburbs within walking distance of the synagogue. Seeking new premises, the congregation received government permission to sell its property in 1870. It moved to a new site on Albert Street, East Melbourne, where a new synagogue building was consecrated in 1877. Rintel served the congregation until his death in 1880. In March 1977 the synagogue's centenary was celebrated with a special service led by Rabbi M. Honig. Architecture Continuously in use since 1877, the East Melbourne Synagogue is the oldest in Melbourne and the largest 19th-century synagogue in Victoria. It is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and is classified by the National Trust of Australia due to its historical, social, and architectural significance. The two-storeyed synagogue was designed by noted Melbourne architects Crouch & Wilson. The internal space is surrounded on three sides by a gallery carried by cast iron columns, each surmounted by an unusual arrangement of an impost block flanked by consoles. The main ceiling is paneled, with a row of large and unusual ventilators marking the location of former suspended gas lights. The original interior, particularly the bimah and Torah ark, remain in an intact state. The building's facade, constructed in the style of Renaissance Revival, was completed in 1883. It comprises five bays. Tuscan pilasters divide the bays of the lower floor, and Corinthian pilasters divide the upper floor bays. Two dome-like mansard roofs flank the central pediment. Today Led by Rabbi Dovid Gutnick since November 2007, the congregation has a current membership of around 200 families. It is currently the only synagogue in Melbourne's inner-city area. In January 2012, the congregation celebrated its 155th anniversary with a double Torah dedication ceremony and fundraising gala dinner attended by Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks (later Baron Sacks), Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.

It is native to the desert southwest of the United States and northern Mexico, where it grows in sandy, dry, and disturbed habitat and blooms during the hot summer. This is an annual herb growing from a taproot and producing sprawling, spreading stems. The leaves have rounded, oval, or roughly triangular blades up to long which have smooth edges or faint lobes or teeth. The inflorescence is an array of several showy bell-shaped flowers with five lobes flaring several centimeters wide. The flower is white to pink or purple, sometimes with mottling or lines of spots in the throat, and often a purple blotch on the upper lip. A yellow nectar guide extends along the lower lip. The fruit is a large seed pod many centimeters long, a cylindrical body tapering into a very long, thin, curving tail. As the fruit dries the tail cracks open and splits into two hooked, claw-like halves. The young fruits and seeds were used for food and the dark-colored hardened dry fruits were used in basketry by local Native Americans.Ethnobotany File:Proboscidea parviflora fruit1.jpgdry fruits File:Proboscidea parviflora MHNT.BOT.2011.18.23.jpgProboscidea parviflora - MHNT ReferencesExternal links *1993 Jepson Manual Treatment: ssp. parviflora *Wayne Armstrong: Devil's Claws *Behold the Devil's Claw, a Pleistocene anachronism Category:Martyniaceae ","title":"Proboscidea parviflora"},{"id":"26888854","text":"Aykut is a Turkish masculine name and may refer to: Given name * Aykut Demir (born 1988), Turkish footballer * Aykut Er√ßetin (born 1982), Turkish footballer * Aykut Karaman (born 1947), Turkish architect * Aykut Kaya (born 1990), Turkish karateka * Aykut Kocaman (born 1965), former Turkish footballer * Aykut √ñzer (born 1993), Turkish footballer * Aykut √ñzt√ºrk (born 1987), Turkish footballer Surname * ƒ∞mren Aykut (born 1940), Turkish female economist, politician and former government minister * Serkan Aykut (born 1975), former Turkish footballer Category:Surnames Category:Turkish-language surnames Category:Turkish masculine given names ","title":"Aykut"},{"id":"26888874","text":"The slendertail moray eel (Gymnothorax gracilicauda) is a moray eel found in coral reefs in the Pacific Ocean.Gymnothorax gracilicauda at www.fishbase.org.

He was born in Obershagen in the Province of Hanover, and he died in Erlangen. He held various pastorates from 1914 to 1925, when he was appointed associate professor of practical and systematic theology at the University of G√∂ttingen, becoming full professor two years later. Althaus was moderately critical of Lutheran Orthodoxy and evangelical-leaning Neo-Lutheranism. He termed it a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù to ‚Äúdefend the authenticity and infallibility of the Bible.‚ÄùDetzler, Wayne A. The Changing Church in Europe. Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1979. p.17. Quotation from Manfred Kober, Theology in Germany, from the Reformation Review, April 1969. In 1933, when a professor of theology at the University of Erlangen, and probably the leading Luther authority of his day, he welcomed the emergence to power of Adolf Hitler - \\"Our Protestant churches have greeted the turning point of 1933 as a gift and miracle of God\\".Robert Ericksen, Complicity in the Holocaust, p.37  Life  Paul Althaus, son of the Protestant theologian Adolf Paul Johannes Althaus (1861-1925), studied Protestant theology in T√ºbingen and G√∂ttingen. In T√ºbingen he was especially influenced by Adolf Schlatter. In G√∂ttingen his doctorate was supervised by Eduard Stange, and he passed his habilitation there in 1913/'14. In the First World War he served as a military chaplain. From 1919 Althaus was an ordinary professor in systematic theology at Rostock University. In 1925 he took up the chair in systematic and New Testament theology in Erlangen. From the summer semester of 1929 he was an honorary member of the Christian student union of Erlangen. He exclusively taught systematic theology until 1932, after which he also taught New Testament theology. Althaus held the position of university preacher from 1932 to 1964 . Between 1926 and 1964 he was president of the Luther-Gesellschaft. Having welcomed the National Socialist rise to power as a 'divine gift and miracle' in 1933, he nonetheless served after the end of the Second World War as the inaugural head of the internal university denazification commission.Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich.. Fischer Taschenbuch 2005, S. 13. However, on 31 January 1947, after his involvement in National Socialism became public, he was removed from his post by the American military government in the course of its own denazification process. In 1948 he was once again granted permission to teach in the University of Erlangen, where he worked until his retirement in 1966. In 1953 he was elected as a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The executor for his literary estate was the historian and political theorist Gotthard Jasper.  Theology = Original Revelation  With his doctrine of 'original' or 'fundamental' revelation, Althaus opposed the Christocentric theology of revelation of dialectical theology, especially that of Karl Barth, who had denied any self-disclosure of God outside Christ. For Althaus God reveals himself outside of Jesus Christ in, for example, human existence, in fate, in history, in nature and in humanity's consciousness of truth and sin. Original revelation is however subordinated to the revelation of salvation in Christ, owing to its being tainted by the attributes of the sinful world.  Doctrine of Creation  Althaus treated institutions such as marriage, family, work, the economy, the people (das Volk), state, church and society as originally ordained by God as part of God's good creation. They are not to be understood (in Lutheran terms) as mere orders of preservation but as orders of creation, because God acts continually through them. The orders are the ways God draws the world towards God's kingdom and secures human common life. For this reason the orders bind humanity: it is obligated towards them in its freedom for responsible decision. Althaus' view of the people (das Volk) as an order of creation led to his contentious declarations about National Socialism and Judaism.  Luther  Althaus is considered one of the foremost experts of Martin Luther's theology. In particular his works The Theology of Martin Luther and The Ethics of Martin Luther remain standard works in the field.  Capital Punishment  Althaus called for the introduction of the death penalty after the passing of the German Constitution of 1949.  Criticism (Relation to Nazism, Antisemitism)  Like many Protestant theologians Althaus welcomed the National Socialists' rise to power. From 1936 he gradually distanced himself from the Third Reich, partly because of the increasing hostility to the church of Hitler's policies. Already in Althaus' writings before 1933, however, there were antisemitic views such as the idea of 'the people' (das Volk) as one of the orders of creation (in Luther's sense). In 1933 Althaus and his colleague Werner Elert drafted a report for the Erlangen Faculty of Theology on a planned 'Aryan paragraph' for the Protestant Reich Church (Reichskirche).Published in Kurt Dietrich Schmidt: Die Bekenntnisse und grunds√§tzlichen √Ñu√üerungen zur Kirchenfrage des Jahres 1933. G√∂ttingen 1934, S. 182-186 Althaus and Elert called in their report for the exclusion of 'nihilist' candidates for official church positions. 'Nihilists' who already held appointments were however - despite demands from the German Christians - not to be removed from office.For critical discussion and interpretation of the Erlangan Report cf.

Honors  In 1959 Paul Althaus was awarded the Bavarian Order of Merit, an honor instituted in 1957.

The French, led by Jacques Fran√ßois Dugommier defeated the Allies, who were commanded by Luis Firm√≠n de Carvajal, Conde de la Uni√≥n. Though the Spanish right wing held, its left flank was driven back on the first day's fighting. On the last day of the battle, the French overran a key position and put the Spanish army to rout. The battle was remarkable in that both army commanders were slain. A Spanish artillery shell killed Dugommier early in the battle and Dominique Catherine de P√©rignon assumed command of the French army. De la Union was shot dead while leading a cavalry charge on the last day of the fighting and was temporarily replaced by Jer√≥nimo Gir√≥n- Moctezuma, Marquis de las Amarilas. The French victory led to the capture of Figueres and the Siege of Roses (Rosas), a port in Catalonia. Background During 1793, the Spanish army won victories at the Siege of Bellegarde and the Battle of Truillas. These battles and other actions resulted in Spanish forces overrunning part of Roussillon, where France borders Spain on the Mediterranean Sea. On 16 January 1794, General of Division Jacques Fran√ßois Dugommier took command of the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees. The victor in the Siege of Toulon immediately reorganized the army, putting it into a state where it would be capable of taking the offensive. The new general began stockpiling supplies, establishing arms factories, setting up hospitals, and improving roads. By April, the field army counted 28,000 soldiers. These were backed up by 20,000 garrison troops and 9,000 raw volunteers.Ostermann- Chandler, p 406 Forming his army into the infantry divisions of Generals of Division Dominique Catherine de P√©rignon, Pierre Francois Sauret, and Pierre Augereau, plus a cavalry reserve under General of Division Andr√© de La Barre, Dugommier launched his offensive in late April 1794. The French victory in the Battle of Boulou on 1 May caused the Spanish army to withdraw south of the Pyrenees. The recapture of Collioure occurred on 29 May.Ostermann-Chandler, p 407.Smith, p 81. Smith gives 26 August as the date of Collioure's surrender. P√©rignon won a combat at La Junquera on 7 June, in which La Barre was killed. Augereau repulsed a Spanish attack on 13 August at the Battle of San-Lorenzo de la Muga. A long siege of Fort de Bellegarde ended on 17 September with a Spanish capitulation.Ostermann-Chandler, pp. 407‚Äì408 Battle=Plans War of the Pyrenees, Eastern Pyrenees To shield Figueres, Roses, and the Alt Emporda, Lieutenant General Luis Firmin de Carvajal, Conde de la Union constructed a chain of 90 redoubts. The defenders included crack troops such as the three battalions each of the Spanish Guard and Walloon Guard Regiments. Lower quality troops such as provincial militia also manned the lines. De la Union was assisted by an allied Portuguese division under Lieutenant General Jo√£o Forbes, which included one battalion each of the 1st, 2nd, Oliven√ßa, Cascais, Peniche, and Freire de Andrade Infantry Regiments. Dugommier deployed a total 36,000 troops for his assault, including 22,000 in the first line. Augereau's division on the western flank had 9,000 men. P√©rignon's 8,700 soldiers held the center and Sauret's 4,300 troops were on the east flank. The second line had 7,500 men and the third line contained 4,500 troops. A further 8,000 soldiers lay in reserve.Catalan Wikipedia Batalla del Roure. The numbers don't add up. The first line has 22,000, not 24,000. The first three lines contain 34,000, not 36,000. If the reserves are added, the total is 42,000, not 36,000. De la Union deployed 45,000 to defend his fortified lines, including 10,000 second line reserves. Lieutenant General Juan de Courten had 10,000 troops to hold Sant Lloren√ß de la Muga, Magdalena Mountain, and Terrades on the western flank. Lieutenant General Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu defended the eastern flank from Pont de Molins to the sea with 12,000 men. Lieutenant General Jer√≥nimo Gir√≥n-Moctezuma, Marquis de las Amarilas held the centre with 23,000 soldiers.Catalan Wikipedia Batalla del Roure. The left wing numbers were arrived at by subtracting the centre and right totals from 45,000. Initial attack Dugommier sent his divisions forward on the night of 16 November 1794. Augereau advanced on the right flank while P√©rignon moved forward in the center, supported by General of Brigade Charles Dugua's cavalry reserve. Sauret and General of Brigade Claude Perrin Victor mounted feint attacks on the left flank.Ostermann-Chandler, p 408 Augereau's attack on the cannon foundry in Sant Lloren√ß de la Muga and Terrades proved successful, forcing de Courten to pull back his Spanish and French √âmigr√© troops toward Llers. Attacks by P√©rignon in the center and Sauret on the left failed in the face of intense Spanish artillery fire from the area of Capmany. A force of Spanish cavalry and infantry under the French royalist Count of Ghent broke through Sauret's line to Cantallops but were driven back with the help of French reinforcements coming from the Pass of Banyuls in the east.Catalan Wikipedia Batalla del Roure On the morning of 18 November, Dugommier, Representative-on-mission Pierre Delbrel, and staff officers watched the combat from the summit of Montroig. The presence of a battery of French guns and the party of French officers drew considerable counter-battery fire from Spanish cannons. About 7:30 AM, an artillery shell exploded nearby and a fragment tore the commanding general's arm off, killing him.Prats, Mort de Dugommier Final attack Battle of the Black Mountain P√©rignon took over and called off the attack. On 18 and 19 November, the French council of war met at the La Junquera headquarters. After reorganizing his army, P√©rignon determined to attack from the northwest along the valley running from Montroig to Biure. The attack began at dawn on the 20th and broke through the Spanish first and second lines. French troops soon began assaulting the 25-gun redoubt at the Santa-Maria-del-Roure monastery, northwest of Pont de Molins. The soldiers of General of Brigade Louis Andr√© Bon approached down the Muga valley from the direction of Escaules. Generals Gaspard Cagival and Diego Godoy (brother of Manuel Godoy) directed intense fire from the defenders that broke the French into small groups. Nevertheless, after being joined by General of Brigade Fran√ßois Guillot's brigade, they persisted in the attack for three hours.Prats, Del Roure The fight turned against the Spanish and the position finally fell around 3:00 PM to an encircling maneuver. During the early fighting on the 20th, de la Union remained at his headquarters in the San Fernando (Sant Ferran) fortress at Figueres. As he rode to the front, he received a report that the Santa-Maria-del-Roure redoubt had fallen. Upon reaching Pont de Molins, he led a counterattack by 1,300 cavalry against the brigades of Generals of Brigade Th√©odore Chabert and Jean-Antoine Verdier. During the subsequent melee, de la Union was fatally hit by two bullets and fell about from Santa-Maria-del-Roure.Prats, Del Roure De Courten and General Domingo Izquierdo withdrew the left wing south to B√†scara, behind the Rio Fluvi√†, pursued by Verdier. An isolated force of 2,000 troops retreated from Llers to Figueres, where it joined Brigadier General Jos√© Andr√©s Lop√©z Valdes' 7,000-man garrison of San Fernando Fortress. Numbers of wounded and stragglers from the battle also took refuge in the fortress. De las Amarilas took command of the badly shaken Army of Catalonia and marched toward Girona, leaving a rear guard to cover the retreat. Aftermath During the battle, the French lost 3,000 casualties out of 35,000 engaged. Spanish and Portuguese losses numbered 10,000 killed, wounded, and missing out of a total of 50,000 men. The French captured 30 artillery pieces. The French army quickly seized Figueres, but at first the fortress of San Fernando, which was northeast of the city, defied them. On 27 November, P√©rignon bluffed Valdes into surrendering the powerful fortress. The entire garrison of 9,000 soldiers and 171 artillery pieces fell into French hands.Smith, p 96. Smith and Ostermann give Valdes as the name of the Spanish general. Prats says Vasquez. In December, de las Amarilas was dismissed for disgracefully abandoning San Fernando, and for blunders at the battles of Boulou and Peyrestortes.Prats, Amarillas Lieutenant General Jos√© de Urrutia y de las Casas took command of the Allied field army, which lay behind the Fluvi√†.

Mamquam Mountain Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mamquam Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.

Vanzler is best known as the translator of a number of the important works of Leon Trotsky ‚Äî materials which helped to establish to expand the influence of the Trotskyist movement in the English-speaking world. Biography=Early years Joseph Vanzler, known to all who knew him by the nickname \\"Usick,\\" was born in 1901 in Samarkand, then part of the Russian Empire and today part of Uzbekistan. An ethnic Jew, Joseph was the son of a glasscutter (who had his own shop at Dzhamskaya Str., 19)Samarkand 1902 Yearbook (p. 120).Wolfgang Lubitz and Petra Lubitz, \\"John G. Wright: Bio- Bibliography,\\" Lubitz TrotskyanaNet, October 31, 2005; pg. 1. Retrieved April 8, 2010. Vanzler was permitted to attend Russian-language school, institutions which strictly limited Jewish enrollment as part of a policy of official anti- semitism under the Tsarist regime. In school, Vanzler studied a variety of languages, including Russian, Latin, Greek, and French. He developed a proficiency for language study which served him throughout his life as a multi-lingual translator. Following World War I, Vanzler and his mother emigrated to the United States, settling in Boston, Massachusetts. Vanzler attended Harvard University (then Harvard College), where he studied Chemistry for an extensive period. Although he left without a degree, Vanzler developed a formula for spermicidal jelly for use as a birth control measure and he became engaged in its manufacture and sale.Wolfgang Lubitz and Petra Lubitz, \\"John G. Wright,\\" pg. 2. In the 1920s Vanzler married Edith Rose Konikow, the daughter of birth control activist Dr. Antoinette Konikow, a Boston physician and founding member of the Communist Party of America. Under the influence of his wife and mother-in-law, Vanzler was initiated into the world of radical politics. Political career Vanzler joined the Communist League of America, the main American Trotskyist political organization of the day, in 1933. He began using the pseudonym \\"John G. Wright\\" at this time and began to produce a vast array of translations from Russian and French to English on behalf of the political movement to which he gave his allegiance. Vanzler was a founding member of the Socialist Workers Party in 1938. He was a member of its governing National Committee from 1938 until his death in 1956. Vanzler was a prolific writer for the Trotskyist press, contributing several hundred articles to its weekly newspaper, The Militant, and to its monthly theoretical magazine, The New International (later Fourth International).Wolfgang Lubitz and Petra Lubitz, \\"John G. Wright,\\" pg. 3. Death and legacy Joseph Vanzler died of a heart attack on June 21, 1956 in New York City. He was 52 years old at the time of his death. Vanzler was survived by his first wife, Edith Konikow Vanzler, and their son, Tyl, and by his second wife, Doris Vanzler, and their son who was born in 1952.

It was directed by Phillip Roth and starred Dean Cain. In the middle of Antarctica, a high maximum-security prison called New Alcatraz has recently become operational. When a mining crew inside the prison accidentally drills into a strange rock formation, a giant, prehistoric boa constrictor is unleashed upon the prison and goes on a killing rampage. It is up to the prison staff, inmates, two paleontologists, and a group of soldiers to hunt down and eliminate the beast. Plot In New Alcatraz, the world's most secure prison located in Antarctica, a drilling operation inadvertently releases a giant boa constrictor from a large, hollow rock that had been preserving it in suspended animation. The snake chews a hole through the ice, enabling it to escape into the prison. The hole is discovered by workers and a guard is placed on it until the engineers can assess the hole and block it up. In the meantime, the snake attacks and kills the guard, along with the engineers before moving further into the prison. The prison sends out a distress call which is received by the United States military. They hire paleontologist Robert Trenton and his wife Jessica to assist a military team in the search to destroy the snake. When they arrive at the prison, they discover a group of survivors, led be head of security Quinn and prison warden Fred Riley. The security and military personnel split up and set out to find and kill the snake whilst Robert, Jessica and Fred watch on in the control room. One by one, the snake kills the personnel. Robert and Jessica join in the hunt. After a skirmish with the snake, a gas pipe ruptures and explodes, killing the remaining security and military members. Robert and Jessica survive and flee from the snake, but Jessica is seemingly killed. Robert returns to the security room and convinces Fred to release the prisoners to help in their escape. Fred releases the prisoners, and the group devises a plan to escape. During the escape, one of the prisoners, Kelly Mitich, attempts to save himself, only to be killed by the snake and accidentally causing another gas explosion, killing Fred. Meanwhile, the other group led by Russian prisoner Yuri Breshcov finds Jessica alive, and they take her in. The snake then kills two of the prisoners, but Yuri and Jessica escape to the surface. Meanwhile, Robert and prisoner Patricia O'Boyle attempt to escape, although the snake kills Patricia while Robert escapes to the surface. Robert, Jessica, and Yuri attempt to escape on the military plane, although the snake sneaks onboard and kills one of the pilots. In the ensuing battle, the snake is ejected from the plane, but Yuri is dragged out with it, and the two fall to their deaths. Robert and Jessica, bewildered but alive, fly to safety.

Boa was a critical failure, with reviews citing bad acting and poor special effects. Sequel Boa vs. Python was released after the success of the Python franchise and the failure of Boa; Boa vs. Python was also a critical failure. The filmmakers had decided to make a crossover with Python and Boa, involving the two types of snakes fighting each other. It has been noted that Boa vs. Python was inspired by Alien vs. Predator (2004). Release Both the DVD and VHS versions have been out of print as of 2010, but they can be found online and at Netflix.

The chief of the SB has the rank of Additional Inspector General/Brigadier General rank, who comes from Bangladesh Police. Mir Shahidul Islam, Additional Inspector General of Bangladesh Police, is the head of Special Branch. Historical background=Formation of the intelligence wing during British rule As the Congress movement was taking off, Dufferin became aware of the inadequacy of the system of collection of political intelligence and saw in the Indian National Congress, a threat to the stability of the empire, as there was no other political movement at that time raging in the country. In response of Dufferin's proposal the Secretary of State for India issued an order on 22 December 1887 for setting up a Central Special Branch and also Special Branches of the Police Department at the headquarters of each provincial Government. In the beginning, the Central Special Branch did not have any unit solely under their control. They were merely collating and compiling their reports received from the provincial Special Branches. But in the far-flung areas of the Empire, there was need for collecting military intelligence. In 1901 it was, therefore, decided that the Central Special Branch which was responsible only for the collection of political intelligence should be expanded to include a small staff of selective detective agents, to be employed to monitor political movements as also to deal with those forms of organised crimes which extended beyond the limits of a single province. Formation of district Intelligence Branch office It gradually came to light that the ramification of the underground conspiratorial organisation were not confined to Calcutta alone but had spread to the districts, then the idea of forming Intelligence Branches at district headquarters was seriously considered. As early as in 1908, the Special Branch had set up some centres in places where the existence of underground organisations had come to light. Such centres were at Midnapore, Barishal, Deoghar, Kustia, Khulna, Jessore. Each of the centres was in-charge of an Inspector who was detailed from Calcutta and remained stationed at the Centre till he was relieved by another. On the eve of the First World War, however, it was felt necessary that there should be a senior officer in-charge of the Intelligence Branch in the districts. In some of the affected districts, Additional Superintendents of Police were posted to head the district Intelligence Branches. Where there was no Additional Superintendent of Police, the Superintendent of Police was designated as Superintendent of Police in-charge of the District Intelligence Branch. The bigger districts like Midnapore, Dhaka, Chittagang etc. had one Additional Superintendent of Police in-charge of the District Intelligence Branch. The duty of the Intelligence Branch of the District Police was twofold: *The collection of information regarding the ramification of the conspiracy organisation. *Investigation of the specific offences committed in furtherance to the common object of the conspiracy. The methodology of collection and dissemination of intelligence and the system of reporting from District Branch to higher-ups were gradually evolved and codified over the years. It, however, goes without saying that the Intelligence Branch in Bengal showed exceptional ability in dealing with the terrorist violence during the period before Independence. Its excellent source work and innumerable channels of information eventually resulted in unearthing of all the groups responsible for terrorist violence. Organisation of Special Branch The present Additional Inspector General of Police (Add IGP) is Mir Shahidul Islam. The headquarters is a 10-storied building located at Malibagh, Rajarbagh, Dhaka, is known as KPI (Key Point Installation). The most important wing of the force charged with security planning as well as functions of intelligence-gathering and counterintelligence. There is City Special Branch (City SB) for the city areas and District Special Branch (DSB) for the districts. Major responsibilities of this branch are to meet up any intelligence required from government, registration and control of foreigners, perform verification role, give protection to the VVIPs & VIPs, intelligence gathering, immigration control etc.Immigration Police Training Officer training is the responsibility of the Special Branch Training School. It was established in September 1992 in Uttara, Dhaka. It relocated in June 2002 to Malibagh, and again in December 2008 to Rajarbagh Police Lines of Dhaka Metropolitan Police. The school trains officers in courses on intelligence-gathering, surveillance, immigration control, and VVIP protection.

Architecture James Strachan was the architect of the project and the building was completed in 1886. The architectural design is Venetian gothic, with Tudor elements on the top floor. Local Gizri sandstone was used in the construction. When the building was completed it had one library and one reading-room on the ground floor, and the main hall on the first floor. The main road facing side has balconies with sculpted balusters. The clock on the top was a gift from Rao Sahib Ramdas Morarji, a local Parsi philanthropist who also donated 1,800 books to the library. The local Khoja community donated another 1,200.

The Work  My Boyfriend Came Back From the War is an example of interactive hypertext storytelling. The work consists of nested frames with black and white web pages and (sometimes animated) grainy GIF images. When clicking hyperlinks in the work, the frame splits into smaller frames and the user reveals a nonlinear story about a couple that is reunited after a nameless military conflict. The lovers find it difficult to reconnect; the woman confesses that she has had an affair with a neighbour while the returned soldier proposes marriage. The story unfolds to the point where the screen has become a mosaic of empty black frames. Olia Lialina calls the work a netfilm, because of its similarity with cinematic narrative. The grainy black-and-white images and intertitles refer to early silent movies. Of its filmic qualities, curator Michael Connor wrote of the work, \\"the work adapts cinematic montage to the web ... separate frames are joined together by HTML code and the browser itself and experienced in both space and in time, employing what Lev Manovich has characterized as spatial and temporal montage.\\" Remixes Starting in 1998, My Boyfriend Came Back From the War was remixed and adapted by a number of artists.

They are the first installments in the fifth generation of the Pok√©mon video game series. First released in Japan on 18 September 2010, they were later released in Europe on 4 March 2011, in North America on 6 March 2011, and Australia on 10 March 2011. Similar to previous installments of the series, the two games follow the journey of a young Pok√©mon trainer through the region of Unova, as they train Pok√©mon used to compete against other trainers, while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. Black and White introduced 156 new Pok√©mon to the franchise, 5 more than the previous record holder Pok√©mon Red and Blue, as well as many new features, including a seasonal cycle, rotation battles, fully animated Pok√©mon sprites and triple battles. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading Pok√©mon between both of the games is necessary in order to complete the games' Pok√©dex. Upon their release, Black and White received positive reviews; critics praised the advancements in gameplay. Reviewers, however, were divided on some of the character designs and Pok√©mon designs, and some critics felt that the games did not innovate as much as expected. Nevertheless, the games were commercial successes; prior to the games' Japanese release, Black and White sold one million consumer pre- orders and became the fastest Nintendo DS titles to sell five million copies. As of September 2017, the games' combined sales have reached 15.64 million, putting them amongst the best-selling games for the Nintendo DS, but still being outsold by their predecessors, Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl. Sequels to Pok√©mon Black and White, Pok√©mon Black 2 and Pok√©mon White 2, were released in Japan for the Nintendo DS in June 2012, with October releases in North America, Europe, and Australia. Gameplay Pok√©mon Black and White are role- playing video games with adventure elements, presented in a third-person, overhead perspective. There are three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. The player controls a Pok√©mon Trainer who begins the game with a single Pok√©monPok√©mon Black instruction manual, p. 7. and is able to capture more using Pok√© Balls.Pok√©mon Black instruction manual, p. 19. Like all other Trainers, the player can carry up to six Pok√©mon at one time. However, the game also includes a network of PCs to store hundreds of Pok√©mon. PCs are found in certain buildings‚Äînamed, \\"Pok√©mon Centers\\", where the player can heal their Pok√©mon when they have low health or has fainted.Pok√©mon Black instruction manual, p. 21. Pok√©mon can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent.Pok√©mon Black instruction manual, p. 18. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum hit points (HP), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types: Normal, Water, Grass, Fire, Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying; Pok√©mon can have one or two types. Generally, most of a Pok√©mon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pok√©mon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pok√©mon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage. When the player encounters a wild Pok√©mon or is challenged by another Trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pok√©mon fight. During battle, the player may use a move, use an item, switch the active Pok√©mon, or flee. However, the player cannot flee a battle against another Trainer or against certain wild Pok√©mon that are stronger than the player's. When a Pok√©mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints until it is revived.Pok√©mon Black instruction manual, pp. 17‚Äì18. If an opposing Pok√©mon faints, all of the player's Pok√©mon who participated in defeating it receive experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, a Pok√©mon may level up, increasing its stats.Pok√©mon Black instruction manual, p. 20. Many Pok√©mon evolve into other forms after certain conditions are met, usually after reaching a certain level threshold or by having a certain item used on them. At the \\"Day Care\\" location, the player can breed two of their Pok√©mon‚Äîusually, a male and a female‚Äîto create Eggs that hatch into baby Pok√©mon at level 1. Pok√©mon Black and White takes place in the Unova region, based on New York City. As with all regions, Unova consists of a number of cities and towns connected by \\"Routes\\". Random encounters may take place in tall grass along routes or in bodies of water. The player occasionally battles Trainers in cities and towns, as well as along routes. In addition, eight of the game's cities and towns are homes to \\"Gym Leaders\\", powerful Trainers specializing in certain types of Pok√©mon; beating a Gym Leader gives the player a \\"Badge\\". All eight Badges are needed to unlock the Pok√©mon League,Pok√©mon Black instruction manual, p. 10. where the player faces off against the \\"Elite Four\\" and, finally, the Champion. Across Unova, items can be found on the ground or purchased from \\"Pok√© Marts\\". For example, Hyper Potions restore HP, Antidotes cure poisoning, and Revives revitalize fainted Pok√©mon. TMs (Technical Machines) teach moves to Pok√©mon, and HMs (Hidden Machines) are a special class of TMs for important moves that allow the player to traverse the environment. The \\"Surf\\" HM move, for example, is used to cross bodies of water.Pok√©mon Black instruction manual, p. 23. New features The graphics have been improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games have been changed to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the Pok√©mon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pok√©mon can be found in the wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pok√©mon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons. There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, both teams must send out three Pok√©mon in a row at once; Some moves only allow Pok√©mon on the left or right side to attack the opponent's Pok√©mon on the same side or in the center. Changing position takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pok√©mon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pok√©mon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through darker-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pok√©mon rather than only Single Battles with lighter-colored grass. Occasionally, the player can find rustling patches of grass and rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pok√©mon, a Pok√©mon more common in the opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pok√©mon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This is the only way to capture Pok√©mon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pok√©mon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Pok√© Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event. There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pok√©mon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pok√©mon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items. Connectivity to other devices IR or Wi-Fi The C-Gear replaces the Pok√©tech from Diamond and Pearl on the Nintendo DS's bottom screen. It controls the game's wireless capabilities, including infrared (IR) communication for battling and trading, wireless communications in the Xtranceiver video chat access to the Entralink to transfer content from the Pok√©mon Dream World, using the Wi-Fi to sync with the Pok√©mon Global Link servers, and the new \\"Pass By mode\\" which allows the game to communicate with other copies through infrared while the DS is asleep. The Feeling Check function tests the compatibility between two players and awards them items accordingly. In the \\"Pass By\\" feature, the player answers various survey questions and receives one of several items depending on how many other players they have connected with. In the \\"Random Matchup\\" feature, the player can battle others randomly. When playing against others online or in IR battles, a new mechanic called the Wonder Launcher allows healing items to be used in battle. Two features were added to transfer Pok√©mon from older DS Pok√©mon games to Black and White. For normal transfer, the Pok√© Transfer feature is available after completion of the main storyline. Unlike the \\"Pal Park\\" feature from previous games, the Pok√© Transfer is a mini-game in which after six Pok√©mon are transferred, the player uses the touch screen to launch Pok√© Balls at the transferred Pok√©mon to catch them within a time limit. Another feature called the Relocator is used to transfer the Pok√©mon given away in promotions for the film Pok√©mon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions so the player can obtain the rare Pok√©mon Zorua and Zoroark. Unlike the Pok√© Transfer, this is available before the main game is completed. Unique to Black and White is the Pok√©mon Dream World, which is dependent on the official Pok√©mon Global Link website. Here, the player can befriend Pok√©mon that are not normally obtainable in-game and that have unique abilities. This occurs after syncing the game back with the Dream World, similarly to the Pok√©walker from HeartGold and SoulSilver. The player can maintain a house in the Dream World that other players can visit as well as grow berries. In addition to allowing access to Pok√©mon acquired in the Dream World, the Entralink also enables players to interact with each other and play side-games. These side- games award points that can be traded for temporary powers such as increasing experience, improving capture rate, or lowering prices of items in Pok√© Marts. Plot=Setting New York City was used as the basis for Unova. Specifically, Castelia City features tall buildings and an urban setting and is the region's \\"central metropolis\\". The Brooklyn Bridge was used as inspiration for the Skyarrow Bridge in Unova Black and White are set in the Unova region, a continental mass located far away from the previous regions, Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh. Unlike the previous regions which were based on real locations in Japan, Unova is modeled after New York City, an idea developed by game director Junichi Masuda when he visited the city for the launch of Diamond and Pearl. One particular example of this is Castelia City, which serves as the region's central metropolis and had such inspirations as its \\"Brooklyn Bridge-style suspension bridge\\" and its \\"huge skyscrapers\\". Masuda also wanted to convey a \\"feeling of communities\\" in Castelia's streets. Unova is host to large urban areas, a harbor, an airport, an amusement park, several bridges, and several mountain ranges. In addition to a diversity of new landscapes, the Unova region is also home to a diversity of people who vary in skin tone and occupation. The region's Japanese name is derived from the Japanese words and ; the many kinds of people and Pok√©mon seen up close look like only one kind of life from afar. Story Like previous Pok√©mon games, Black and White both follow a linear storyline; the main events occur in a fixed order. The protagonist of Pok√©mon Black and White is a teenager who sets out on a journey through Unova to become the Pok√©mon master. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either Snivy, Tepig or Oshawott as their starter Pok√©mon as a gift from Professor Juniper. The protagonist's friends, Cheren and Bianca, are also rival Pok√©mon Trainers who occasionally battle the player; Cheren will choose the Pok√©mon with a type advantage against the player's, while Bianca will choose the Pok√©mon with a type disadvantage. The player's primary goal is to obtain the eight Gym Badges of Unova and ultimately challenge the Elite Four of the Pok√©mon League, and its Champion, to complete the main story. In addition to the standard gameplay, the player will also have to defeat the games' main antagonist force, Team Plasma, a Knights Templar-esque group who claim that Pok√©mon are oppressed by humanity and seek to liberate them from their trainers. Team Plasma is led by N, a young man who was brought up alongside Pok√©mon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport. Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Pok√©mon (Reshiram and Zekrom) of Unova and defeating the Pok√©mon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pok√©mon. Depending on the game version, N will capture Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White. After the player defeats the Elite Four and enters the Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has defeated Alder and become the newest Pok√©mon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pok√©mon League, challenging the player to find him to take part in one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pok√©mon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pok√©mon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pok√©mon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake about the nature of the relationship between people and their Pok√©mon before leaving the castle on his captured Pok√©mon to a far-off land. After Team Plasma's defeat, Looker arrives in Unova and tasks the player with finding the remaining Sages of Team Plasma, so they can be brought to justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pok√©mon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pok√©mon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pok√©mon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pok√©mon living in harmony. Cynthia, a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, is also found in this area of the game and can be challenged. A non-player character named after Shigeki Morimoto, a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, and the director of the Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver games, can also be found and battled in the game. Development Junichi Masuda was responsible for the direction and the music of the games. On 29 January 2010, The Pok√©mon Company announced that a new game was in development for the Nintendo DS to be released later that year. Director Junichi Masuda stated that several aspects of the series were being revamped for the new generation. On 9 April 2010, the Japanese website updated with the titles of the versions as Pok√©mon Black and White and announced a Q3 2010 release date. The games feature an improved visual style from other Pok√©mon games, with an increased use of 3D computer graphics than any other of the handheld series. It also has a special feature that allows the user to upload their saved game to the Internet, allowing them to do certain things on an official website. On 3 August 2010, Masuda announced on his blog that the Black and White game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pok√©mon to evoke a feeling of it being a brand-new game, like when the original Pok√©mon games were first released. In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pok√©mon introduced interspersed with Pok√©mon from the previous generations. For example, Pikachu was introduced in Red and Green and was obtainable in Blue, Yellow and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in Black and White from the start of the game. It was later confirmed that Black and White are region locked on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS. Game director and composer Junichi Masuda stated that to keep the games fresh, he looks at every previous element to decide what to adapt to the new game, stating \\"people may not like what they like in the past, trend wise\\". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pok√©mon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players would not be able to know what is a good Pok√©mon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players. Music is a four-disc soundtrack featuring the games' music scored by Masuda, Go Ichinose, Shota Kageyama, Hitomi Sato, Morikazu Aoki, Minako Adachi, and Satoshi Nohara. The soundtrack was released on 20 October 2010, in Japan. Ichinose was in charge of directing all Pok√©mon voices for the game while Adachi produced all sound effects. Promotion and release Pok√©mon Black and White were released in Japan on 18 September 2010. They were later released in Europe on 4 March 2011, in North America on 6 March 2011, and in Australia on 10 March 2011.

On 18 April 2010, the episode of Pok√©mon Sunday showed game footage of a player character walking around in a 3D environment and a single screenshot depicting a battle between the player's Zoroark and an enemy Zorua. Host Shoko Nakagawa made note of how the player's Zoroark's sprite was a full body sprite as viewed from behind, when in the past all such sprites only showed a smaller portion of the player's Pok√©mon's body.Pok√©mon Sunday, 2010-04-18 On 9 May 2010, the episode of Pok√©mon Sunday revealed silhouettes of the three Pok√©mon available to choose from at the beginning of the games,Pok√©mon Sunday, 2010-05-09 which were later revealed to be the Grass Snake Pok√©mon Tsutarja, the Fire Pig Pok√©mon Pokabu, and the Sea Otter Pok√©mon Mijumaru. Other information revealed is that the game takes place in the Isshu Region which includes the Hiun City metropolis. On 16 May 2010, the episode of Pok√©mon Sunday showed game battle footage, illustrating the new in-battle animations and dynamic camera positioning; also described were Zoroark's Illusion ability and the special Zoroark acquired by the movie ticket pre-order gift Pok√©mon.Pok√©mon Sunday, 2010-05-16 On 28 May 2010, both the official Japanese and English Pok√©mon websites revealed names and designs of the two major legendary Pok√©mon of these games, who also serve as the game version mascots: the White Yang Pok√©mon Reshiram for Pok√©mon Black and the Black Yin Pok√©mon Zekrom for Pok√©mon White. The July 2010 issue of CoroCoro Comic revealed the C-Gear wireless interactivity features, the ability to upload game data to the internet and the player's computer, several brand-new Pok√©mon, new Pok√©mon moves, Reshiram and Zekrom's Pok√©mon types, details on the Celebi / Zorua event, and a new character: Professor Araragi, the first female Pok√©mon professor to appear in the video games.CoroCoro Comic, July 2010 The 27 June 2010, episode of Pok√©mon Sunday, made the announcement of the release date as 18 September 2010, and a yet-to-be named character.Pok√©mon Sunday, 2010-06-27 The 28 June episode of Oha Suta, showed a trailer, which included its release date, new gameplay footage, several new characters, more new Pok√©mon, and a three-on-three battle system.Oha Suta, 2010-06-28 The August 2010 issue of CoroCoro Comic elaborated upon many new game mechanics: the three-on-three system, the online Global Link system, an online Dream World that can allow for access to other Pok√©mon, access to an area that uses the Wi-Fi called the Hilink (similar to the Underground), a special feature called the Live Caster for video chat on the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS, kanji support, aesthetic differences between the two versions of the game, areas exclusive to the game versions, new characters, new moves, new abilities, and new Pok√©mon.CoroCoro Comic, August 2010 The 25 July 2010, episode of Pok√©mon Sunday introduced the new phantom Pok√©mon Victini,Pok√©mon Sunday, 2010-07-25 which initially appeared in a trailer for the 2011 Pok√©mon film that was shown with screenings of Phantom Ruler: Zoroark. It is noted to be Pok√©mon No. 000 in Isshu's regional Pok√©dex, and is only accessible by downloading a special item from Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, DS Stations, and Nintendo Zones (such as those found in Japanese McDonald's restaurants) to a game save. This was initially available for a month following the games' release date. Another promotional Pok√©mon given out after the games' release is a Kumasyun, a Pok√©mon that is difficult to find in the games unless it is during the games' winter season. On the day of the Japanese release, Nintendo of America sent cease and desist letters to two English language Pok√©mon fansites, Pok√©Beach and Serebii, after they published screenshots and various other media from the newly released games. Nintendo claimed the posting of the media was infringing copyright and noted their intention to shut down the websites under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act unless the media was removed. The screenshots were subsequently taken down from both websites. Luke Plunkett of video game blog Kotaku initially speculated that Nintendo of America issued the cease and desist letters over the belief that the images were illegally obtained via a ROM image; however, Jon Sahagian of Pok√©Beach stated the images in question had been obtained from the Japanese forum 2channel. Charlie Scibetta, Nintendo of America's senior director of corporate communications, later stated that it was the choice of images that were of concern to the company. In a statement to Kotaku, he said, \\"Nintendo supports and appreciates the efforts that Pok√©mon fans go through to create fan sites. In most cases there is no issue with the content that is posted, but on this occasion we had to contact a select few websites to ask them to take down confidential images\\". International release The foreign promotion for the games began on 22 November 2010, when the official website for the North American, European, and Australian markets was updated, which included the localized names of the starter Pok√©mon (Snivy, Tepig and Oshawott) in English, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish markets and the games' setting in the Unova region. Floats of version mascots Reshiram and Zekrom accompanied the Pikachu balloon during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on 25 November 2010, the following Thursday. On 27 December 2010, the official websites for the international releases updated once more, revealing the English names for many of the first Pok√©mon revealed during the promotion for the Japanese release. In addition, the English names for the game location Hiun City and the character Professor Araragi were revealed to be Castelia City and Professor Juniper, respectively. Starting on 3 January and lasting until 9 January 2011, in the United States, players of Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver were able to visit GameStop stores to download the special shiny Raikou that was previously given out for Phantom Ruler: Zoroark pre-order ticket holders in Japan. Similar downloads would be available for the shiny Entei from 17 to 23 January, and shiny Suicune from 31 January to 6 February. All three of these Pok√©mon still enabled the event for Zoroark in the North American Black and White versions. These three Pok√©mon were later distributed via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for European, Australian, and North American markets (for a second time) starting 7 to 13 February with Raikou, again, with subsequent staggered releases for Entei and Suicune throughout February. The Celebi event was run in North America and distributed through GameStop stores from 21 February to 6 March 2011, or it could be acquired from the tour promoting the Black and White games that began on 5 February 2011. In France and Spain, this same Celebi was available through various retailers from 1 February through 3 March 2011. Italian players could get this Celebi from specific video game retailers from 21 January through 3 March. The event to distribute the item to allow players to capture Victini was also run following the games' release internationally. North American players were able to download the item from Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection from 6 March to 10 April 2011. European players were able to get the item from 4 March to 22 April. Australian players were able to download it from 10 March to 28 April 2011. Pok√©mon Black 2 and White 2=Reception=Critical response Pok√©mon Black and White have received largely positive reviews by critics, having an aggregate score of 87% on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly awarded the game a perfect 40/40 score, becoming the 15th game to receive such a distinction, as well as obtaining the highest score ever given to a Pok√©mon video game by the publication. Game Informers Annette Gonzalez remarked that \\"Pok√©mon Black and White do a great job building upon already solid features and taking them to the next level.\\" VideoGamer.coms Jamin Smith criticized the games for not innovating as much as some people would have liked, but stated that \\"rest assured in the knowledge that Black and White are damn fine games; the best the series has to offer.\\" Official Nintendo Magazine referred to them as \\"A beautiful refinement of a great series [...] the best Pok√©mon ever.\\" Nintendo Power expressed that \\"the Pok√©mon series's latest pair of adventures is as addictive as ever.\\" Edge acknowledged that \\"where next for Pok√©mon, Black and White don't suggest any answers, but they do remind us why we'd care in the first place.\\" IGN gave the games a 9/10, a higher rating than any of the other Nintendo DS Pok√©mon games. The review praised the games for renewing interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pok√©mon designs, explaining that \\"aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pok√©mon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling\\". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pok√©mon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it would be great to new players. He also compared it to the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pok√©mon series games published before them. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated \\"It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black and White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If you could only play one game for the rest of your life, this would be a wise choice.\\" Some people criticized the designs of the Generation V Pok√©mon, saying that some of them were good, but many were uninspired. Commercial performance In August 2010, one month before the games' release in Japan, Pok√©mon Black and White gained a total of 1.08 million pre-orders, becoming the fastest game on the Nintendo DS to break the one million mark. In the first two days on sale, it sold more than 2.6 million copies, becoming the biggest launch in the series history in Japan. By 3 November, the games had sold over 4.3 million copies in Japan. As of 9 January 2011, the games became the fastest DS titles to sell five million copies. Upon its release in the UK, White and Black took the #1 and #2 spots respectively in the UK overall sales charts, with White becoming the second fastest-selling DS game ever in the UK after Professor Layton and Pandora's Box, selling 13,000 more copies than Black. Combined, their sales became Nintendo's third biggest ever launch in the UK, behind Wii Fit and Mario Kart Wii, and the biggest opening weekend ever for a pair of Pok√©mon titles. In the US, Black and White sold more than 1.08 million copies on day one, breaking the previous day-one record held by predecessors Diamond and Pearl of 780,000 copies. According to the NPD Group, Nintendo sold 1.3 million units of White and 1.1 million units of Black in March 2011, making them the #1 and #2 top selling games in the US for the month. In April 2011, Nintendo's financial earnings report confirmed that Pok√©mon Black and White had sold 11.5 million copies worldwide, making them the highest selling DS games for Nintendo in the 2010‚Äì11 financial year, and third overall, behind only the Wii games, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort.

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival on May 12. Plot summary A young man, Enoch, is out of school and has been befriended by a ghost of a Japanese kamikaze pilot. For unexplained reasons, he attends the funerals of strangers without invitation; at one of these he meets a young woman, Annabel, who says she works with children who have cancer, and the two start spending time together. Later Annabel acknowledges she has cancer herself, a fact which Enoch appears to accommodate, even when Annabel discovers she has only three months left to live. As their relationship becomes romantic, Enoch's placidity is explained by his own history of near-death experience, but when the loss of Annabel becomes a reality his behaviour betrays more evidence of turmoil. Annabel accepts and reacts to this. At Annabel's memorial Enoch asks to speak, but before he says anything memories of the couple's happiness together appear to resolve his grief.

Lew and Bryce Dallas Howard were fellow drama students at New York University; she encouraged him to take his project further and agreed to be a producer on the script. Her father Ron wanted to direct, but his schedule did not allow for it; \\"It was honestly like, 'If we could get a Gus Van Sant- type director...' That's what we were saying. We never thought we would actually get him to direct it,\\" Bryce Dallas Howard said in an interview for the film's soundtrack release. \\"But he said yes immediately, and five weeks later we were shooting.\\" Casting was done in Los Angeles with the intention of casting unknowns for the leads. In October 2009, Mia Wasikowska joined the project as the female lead. Wasikowska cut her hair for the film. The following November, Henry Hopper was cast as the male lead.

Excavations conducted by these field schools resulted in the discovery of a wide range of artifacts, such as bits of flint, bone, and pottery, a midden, fire pits, and a piece of copper.

He played halfback for the University of Michigan football team for seven years from 1885 to 1891 and was captain of the 1888 team. In 1886, he set the world record by drop kicking a football 168 feet, 7¬Ω inches. After graduating from Michigan, he was an attorney in Bay City, Michigan and a long-time member of the University of Michigan Board in Control of Athletics. Biography=University of Michigan A native of Ann Arbor, Michigan (born January 10, 1867), Duffy enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1885. While attending the school as both an undergraduate and law student, he played halfback for the Michigan football team for seven years from 1885 to 1891. He was the team captain in 1888, and his brother John L. Duffy was captain of the 1887 team. Near the end of Duffy's career at Michigan, the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: \\"Duffy is an old U. of M. player. Although a swift runner and clever dodger his great strength lies in kicking ability, punting and drop-kicking.\\" As a rusher, Duffy had great speed. At Michigan's May 1888 field day, Duffy won both sprint events, with times of 10.4 seconds in the 100-yard dash and 22.4 seconds in the 220-yard dash. Prior to the 1888 football game between Michigan and Notre Dame, the players competed in a 100-yard foot race, which Duffy won.Kryk, Natural Enemies, p. 14. Duffy also ran for two touchdowns in the 1888 Notre Dame game which Michigan won by a score of 26‚Äì6.Kryk, Natural Enemies, pp. 14‚Äì15. James E. Duffy, 1890 As a kicker, Duffy set or tied distance records for his era. On May 22, 1886, at a field day in Ann Arbor, Duffy drop kicked a football 168 feet, 7¬Ω inches. Outing magazine reported that Duffy's kick broke \\"the best record of the world by 11 feet and 5 inches.\\" A few days before his record-breaking kick at the May 1886 field day, Duffy had kicked the ball 194 feet in a practice session. On the day of the event, he reportedly broke the record five times. In 1888, the Detroit Free Press wrote: > Included in the team is J.E. Duffy, who holds the world's record for the > drop kick, he having propelled the ball 168 feet seven and one half inches, > at Ann Arbor May 22, 1886. It may be explained that a drop kick is made by > letting the ball fall from the hands and kicking it at the very instant it > rises. Duffy is a tall, well formed muscular player who gets over the ground > like a wraith and fights for every point. On November 22, 1891, Duffy also kicked a field goal from the 55-yard line against Cornell‚Äîa kick that either tied or fell one yard short of the American football record for the longest field goal to that time. Michigan was undefeated in Duffy's first three seasons with the team, outscoring opponents 222 to 0 in the 1885, 1886 and 1887 seasons. With Duffy as captain in 1888, the team won its first four games, including two wins over Notre Dame, by a combined score of 126 to 20. For the final game of the 1888 season, Michigan traveled to Chicago to play a game to raise money for charity against the Chicago University Club, a group described as a \\"picked team\\" made up of \\"eastern college experts.\\" One of Michigan's stars, Horace Greely Prettyman, was ejected from the game for slugging. Though Michigan lost the game 26‚Äì4, newspaper accounts credited Duffy's play. In one instance, Chicago halfback Crawford (described as \\"a famous Yale man\\") came out of a heap of players, \\"dodging between the legs of the big fellows and knocking down the little fellows till Duffy got a full Nelson lock on him and hurled him neck over heels.\\" Duffy accounted for Michigan's only points against Chicago, running for a touchdown in the second half \\"by good running and dodging.\\" In Duffy's first six years as a varsity football player at Michigan, the team compiled an overall record of 17 wins and 4 losses. In his seventh season, Duffy reportedly served as a player and coach for the 1891 team. While official sources list only Mike Murphy and Frank Crawford as the coaches of the 1891 team, the Chicago Daily Tribune reported in November 1891 that the Michigan team was \\"coached systematically\\" by Murphy, Crawford, Horace Greely Prettyman and Duffy. The 1891 team finished with a 4‚Äì5 record, losing more games that year than in the prior six years combined. Duffy received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1890 and a law degree in 1892. While at Michigan, Duffy was a member of the Chi Psi (ŒßŒ®) fraternity. Legal career After receiving his degrees, he entered the practice of law in Bay City, Michigan. He was the city attorney in Bay City from 1897 to 1899 and thereafter returned to private practice. Duffy was also a member of the University of Michigan's Board in Control of Athletics from its inception through at least 1921. In February 1917, he was the only member of the Board who voted against a resolution favoring Michigan's rejoining the Western Conference. He was also president of the Michigan State Bar in 1930. Duffy purchased the Port Huron & Detroit Railroad in 1922 and served as its chairman. He died in 1953. Honorary degree In 1921, the University of Michigan presented Duffy with an honorary degree of Master of Arts. When the honorary degree was presented, Professor John G. Winter praised Duffy as follows: > Mr. James Eugene Duffy, of Bay City, a graduate of Michigan, College of > Literature, Science, and the Arts, class of 1890, and of the Law School in > the class of 1892.

He has been commissioned to write works for the Besan√ßon International Music Festival, the CBC Symphony Orchestra, the Hamilton Philharmonic, McGill University, Musica Camerata, the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, Opera Lyra, the Pierrot Ensemble, the Stratford Festival, and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra among others. Since 1976 he has taught music composition and theory at the University of Ottawa. Life and career Born in Toronto, Gellman began his musical training in his native city with Samuel Dolin with whom he studied both the piano and music composition. He began his career as a concert pianist while still a teenager, first drawing acclaim for his 1964 performance of his own piano concerto with the CBC Symphony Orchestra. For that composition he won the BMI Student Composer Award. In 1965 Gellman entered the Juilliard School in New York City where he studied through 1968 with such teachers as Luciano Berio, Vincent Persichetti, and Roger Sessions. During the summers of 1965 and 1966 he attended the Aspen Music Festival and School where he was a pupil of Darius Milhaud. In 1973 he entered the graduate music composition program at the Conservatoire de Paris where he spent three years studying under Olivier Messiaen. In 1976 he graduated from the conservatoire with a Premier Prix. In 1970 he won the UNESCO prize for \\"the best work by a composer under the age of 25\\", for \\"Mythos\\" for flute and string quartet. One of Gellman's most extensive works, Chori, was premiered by the Toronto Symphony in 1975. Since his return to Canada in 1976 Gellman has been Professor of Composition and Theory at the University of Ottawa. During the late 70's he composed several pieces for piano including Poeme, for Angela Hewitt; Wind Music, commissioned by the Canadian Brass; Dialogue for horn solo; and Dialogue II for flute and piano. In 1978 Gellman received a commission from the French Government to compose a work for the Festival de Besan√ßon, France, in honour of Oliver Messiaen's 70th Birthday. The result, Deux Tapisseries for 15 players, was given its premiere on 11 September 1978, in Besan√ßon by the Ars Nova Ensemble conducted by Marius Constant; it was given a repeat performance one month later in Paris. Gellman's expertise in the area of orchestral music triggered a commission from the Toronto Symphony to compose Awakening in 1983, a short concert overture moving from darkness to light, chaos to order, through a gradual accumulation of energy. The work was one of the three introduced during the orchestra's first season in Roy Thompson Hall. In the spring of 1983, it was featured by the orchestra during a major tour throughout Europe. In 1986, the Toronto Symphony unveiled another newly commissioned Gellman opus, Universe Symphony, featuring the synthesizers of the Canadian Electronic Ensemble as soloists with the orchestra under conductor Andrew Davis. A performance later that year at Expo 86 in Vancouver, featured the Vancouver Symphony. Further performances followed, at the Festival de Lanaudiere with the Orchestre Metropolitan de Montreal and in Ottawa with the Ottawa Symphony. Composed with the aid of funding from both the Canada Council and the Ontario Arts Council, this ambitious work in five movements features many lyrical episodes framing a driving, energy-raising Scherzo culminating in an improvisation from the soloists. It is dedicated \\"to all beings in the aspiration for World Peace\\". Universe Symphony brought further international recognition with Steven Gellman being named Canadian Composer of the Year in 1987. In the wake of Universe Symphony, Jon Kimura Parker commissioned Steven Gellman to compose a work for him. The result was: \\"Keyboard Triptych\\" for Piano/Synthesizer with which Parker toured Canada, the U.S and Britain. Since then Gellman has composed a wide variety of works, including Love's Garden, for Soprano and Orchestra ; Canticles of Saint Francis, for Choir and Orchestra, for the 150th anniversary of the Red Cross; a second Piano Concerto ; Burnt Offerings for String Orchestra; Musica Eterna, for String Quartet ; Red Shoes (for the S.M.C.Q. ); Chiaroscuro ; Album for Piano (published by Frederick Harris Co.) ; Sonata for Cello and Piano; the Jaya Overture (for the N.A.C.O.) and Fanfare for the New Millennium, among others. Gellman's Piano Quartet (commissioned by Radio Canada) received its world premiere on 3 April 2004 in Montreal, performed by Musica Camerata. His Viola Concerto received its world premiere on 29 January 2007 at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. \\"Musings\\" for Piano Trio was premiered by the Gryphon Trio at The Ottawa International Chamber Music Festival, summer 2009.

B. Yeats that was published in The Rose in 1893. The poem is one of many early Yeatsian lyrical poems which utilize the symbol of the rose. Meter and Rhyme Scheme The poem has twenty four lines, written in fairly regular iambic pentameter. The rhyme scheme is aabbccddeeff gghhiijjkkaa, and the use of the rhyming couplets give the poem its euphonic feel.Poetry Archive Text Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days! Come near me, while I sing the ancient ways: Cuchulain battling with the bitter tide; The Druid, grey, wood-nurtured, quiet eyed, Who cast round Fergus dreams, and ruin untold; And thine own sadness, whereof stars, grown old In dancing silver-sandalled on the sea, Sing in their high and lonely melody. Come near, that no more blinded by man's fate, I find under the boughs of love and hate, In all poor foolish things that live a day, Eternal beauty wandering on her way. Come near, come near, come near‚ÄîAh, leave me still A little space for the rose-breath to fill! Lest I no more hear common things that crave; The weak worm hiding down in its small cave, The field-mouse running by me in the grass, And heavy mortal hopes that toil and pass; But seek alone to hear the strange things said By God to the bright hearts of those long dead, And learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know Come near; I would, before my time to go, Sing of old Eire and the ancient ways: Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days. Commentary and Interpretation The symbol of the rose in \\"To the Rose upon the Rood of Time\\" is firstly one that is constant, binding past and present through its spiritual and romantic referents. Stephen Coote notes that the rose on the rood was a symbol worn around the neck of those belonging to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn: the \\"female\\" rose is impaled upon the \\"male\\" cross. The union of these two elements was intended to help the wearer transcend beyond the physical and into the spiritual: \\"the rose could also be seen as intellectual, spiritual and eternal beauty impaled upon the world and suffering with mankind as transcendence becomes immanence.\\" As a symbol of constancy, the rose is also the symbol of Yeats's undying love for Maud Gonne, as well as the symbol for Ireland herself as a homeland, suffering and dying on the cross, beautiful, tragic, hoping for resurrection. Although Ireland suffers, she remains eternally beautiful, an unchanging factor that transcends time. Whatever the referent, or referents, the permanence of the rose is clear, as it is the \\"Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days\\" (line 1). In order for Yeats to tell of the great Celtic heroes, the rose must come near, presumably because the rose has witnessed and embodied the sufferings of the people long past (line 2). Furthermore, the rose is invited to: \\"Come near, that no more blinded by man‚Äôs fate,/ I find under the boughs of love and hate,/ In all poor foolish things that live a day,/ Eternal beauty wandering on her way\\" (lines 9-12). \\"Eternal beauty\\" is the rose, personified at the end of the stanza, or at the very least made female; however, the word \\"eternal\\" is the word to note. The rose always was, and is, and will be forever on the \\"Rood of Time. The poem is settled in the rose, to the point that the poem‚Äôs tone is one of sweet, suffering melancholy, a tone that is reaching for the sublime. In the 1890s, says Stephen Coote, Yeats was concerned for the \\"spiritual regeneration of his people\\": he felt that a spiritual posture of awe, a posture taken before those things that were excellent, beautiful, and full of grandeur, was necessary to achieve that regeneration. The Oxford Dictionary notes that the etymology of \\"sublime\\" renders a Latin root, sublimus, meaning \\"below the threshold\\". The sublime, then, is that which is so beautiful it borders on the spiritual or the divine: Yeats poses the rose as a starting point for spiritual regeneration, and surrounds this symbol with the beautiful lyricism, euphony, rhyme and meter which characterizes his early poetry. The repeated phrase \\"come near\\" has the feel of an incantation: the rose's proximity, so close, and yet leaving a space large enough for \\"the rose-breath to fill\\", contributes to the feeling of being on the verge of the divine (line 14). The lack of complete and utter communion with the rose gives the poem an air of sweet suffering that seems necessary in order to achieve the sublime. The suffering in the \\"sad Rose\\", however, also lends an anxiety to the poem's melancholy, an anxiety that is supported by the allusions to the Irish heroes, buried interminably in Irish ground and in Irish memory. The Druid, a priest, magician and soothsayer of the ancient Celtic religion, long an extinct specimen of Ireland, is here described with romantic and wonderful qualities: \\"wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed\\" (line 4). Yeats mourns the lack of the good in occult religion of the past; furthermore, the mention of Cuchulain and Fergus recalls their tragic ends. Cuchulain was a mythological hero with an Achilles-like story, an unbeatable warrior defeated because of a small weakness. He was betrayed by his enemies and died at the young age of twenty- seven, or as Yeats puts it, as he was \\"battling with the bitter tide\\" (line 3). Fergus, on the other hand, is a common name in Irish mythology, but many of these figures died violent deaths or sung out ages in Ireland. According to Yeats, the Druid \\"cast round Fergus dreams, and ruin untold\\" (line 5). Their dismal deaths are indeed cataclysmic, and although the events are muted through allusion only, the sadness of such lost greatness is inherent to the poem. Yeats sings of \\"old Eire and the ancient ways\\", an old Ireland that seems lost forever in the passage of time (line 23). It is safe to say that there is conflicted feeling in this poem, but that the feeling does not overpower the sweetness in the melancholy. The rose upon the rood, after all, has witnessed these events and its constancy, despite its suffering, acts as a central answer to the poem's murmurs of anxiety. Alternatively, the Fergus to whom Yeats refers may be the character portrayed in the 13th century chivalric romance story, Roman de Fergus. In this sense, especially alongside references to Cuchulain and Druids, the piece could be considered a song of praise for the old world, a nostalgia for the honesty, authenticity and complexity of the past‚Äîto the \\"Rose\\" lost upon the \\"Rood of Time\\". In this way the first verse paragraph is Yeats' appeal for these things to \\"Come near, come near, come near\\", but the plea is soon followed by hesitation: \\"Ah, leave me still/A little space for the rose-breath to fill!/Lest I no more hear common things that crave\\"; the poet acknowledges the fleeting beauty of the immediate, natural world. The poem continues however, returning to echo the original sentiment, his yearning for lost culture- \\"But seek alone to hear the strange things said/By God to the bright hearts of those long dead/And learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know/Come near\\".

Case studies One of the case studies concerns Susan R. Barry, nicknamed \\"Stereo Sue,\\" whom Sacks wrote about in 2006.

While her memory and personality were intact, she had problems processing visual stimuli, and was no longer able to read words or music, yet for years lived an extremely active life, frequently performing entirely from memory, with no one but her husband knowing she had any problems. Another case study was about a very vivacious, social woman named Pat who suffered a stroke that resulted in aphasia --a complete inability to speak or understand words.

Life and work V√°zquez the Younger followed in his father's profession, inheriting his style and clientele. Together with Isidro de Villoldo, his father initiated the style identified as the Sevillian school of sculpture. He learned his art in his father's studio and with such sculptors as Jer√≥nimo Hern√°ndez, with whom it appears he worked as an oficial (a person who would be left in charge of operations in the master's absence), and with others who also followed his father's style. He worked in Seville between 1578 and 1600, and had died by 1610. He married in 1579 to Luc√≠a de Chaves, sister of his stepmother Isabel de Vald√©s (his father's third wide). It is quite unlikely that he would have been the same person as the Bautista V√°zquez who was a notable sculptor before 1590 in the province of Le√≥n. Artistically, he was not particularly known for individual personality nor originality. His work is overshadowed by his father's, and blends into the prevailing mannerism of his time. The documents from which we know of his artistic production always reflect partnerships or transfers of assignments to other artists, perhaps with greater artistic merits but with less reputation. If the critical attributions of his work are accurate, his style represented a transition into the Baroque, but lacking the aplomb and plasticity shown by his father, his work lacks the classical serenity that linked his father's work to the Renaissance in a manner directly opposed to the tempestuous style of Alonso Berruguete. According to the known documents, in 1585 he contracted, together with Jer√≥nimo Hern√°ndez, to produce an altarpiece for the parish church of Santa Mar√≠a in Arcos de la Frontera (province of C√°diz), taking charge of the side of the epistle. In 1588 he contracted the collaboration of Diego L√≥pez Bueno in the carving and architectural adornment; in 1590 he passed the remaining work on to Miguel de Ad√°n. Based on stylistic resemblance to the work of his father, all that is believed to be by his own hand are the reliefs of the evangelists Saint Luke and Mark, and the base of the altarpiece. It is unlikely that he executed the relief of the Visitation, which Ad√°n claimed to have carved. In 1585 he worked for the Jesuits in Seville, and while it is not clear exactly what he worked on, he is usually attributed the oldest part of the altarpiece of the Immaculate Conception in the Church of the Annunciation (which was a Jesuit church at the time), with a series of small figures of martyrs, a Saint Francis, a Saint Roch, and a Saint Sebastian, none of them with any particularly personal touches, although the Sebastian certainly reflects the style he would have learned in his father's studio. He is also attributed small figures of Saint Ann and the Virgin and Child, which resemble the style of Roque Balduque. In 1589 he transferred to Juan de Oviedo the Younger the work on the main altarpiece of the parish church of Azuaga (province of Badajoz), which had been in his charge for a year. Those who knew this work, destroyed in 1936, attributed it to Juan de Oviedo. Of the Marian themes so often present in his father's work, the Virgin and Child in the parish church of Beas (province of Huelva) does appear to be his. He is traditionally considered the author of the Saint John the Apostle, Saint John the Evangelist, Christ at the Column, and the reliefs of the Annunciation, the Epiphany and the Circumcision on the altarpiece of the Monastery of Saint Jerome in Granada. However, comparative study with his father's work in the Church of Santa Mar√≠a in Medina Sidonia and that of the Granadan Melchor de Tur√≠n has led critics to believe these are more likely to be the work of the latter (who also was strongly influenced by the elder V√°zquez). If these are works of V√°zquez the Younger, there is little in them that relates to the works of the University of Seville, nor others attributed to him; on the contrary, the reliefs and figures show interesting relationships of types, proportions and the manner of composition and execution to those of Medina Sidonia and of the Church of Santa Mar√≠a in Arcos de la Frontera. In short, the art of V√°zquez the Younger is surrounded by numerous doubts and disputable attributions that could either make his work an important continuation of his father's serene and classic style or, on the contrary, an obscure artist with a mannered and unoriginal production, always with the collaboration of numerous helpers who took over the work, and on occasion even the contracts.

Samuel R. Curtis established a military camp at the Fort Riley- Fort Larned Road crossing of the Smokey Hill River in what is now Ellsworth County, Kans. The camp occupied a site where a stage station and trading ranch also operated. Daniel Page and Joseph Lehman established the hunting camp and trading ranch in 1860. The men gathered wolf and buffalo hides for trade. In 1862 the ranch became a station for the Kansas Stage Company. The station kept and fed mules that were changed when stagecoaches came through. The station was raided by Confederate soldiers in September of that year. In August 1864 soldiers from the 7th Iowa Cavalry, under the command of 2nd Lt. Allen Ellsworth, established a fort four miles southeast of the site that eventually became Ellsworth, Kansas. A two-story blockhouse was built there. In July Maj. Gen.

On August 7, 1864, Indians drove off and captured most of the post's horses and the mules belonging to the stage company servicing the area. The post remained with only two horses. Col. James H. Ford, who visited Fort Ellsworth in January 1865, noticed the post still only possessed nine horses.

His name and image are still symbols of the company. The title 'colonel' was honorary ‚Äì a Kentucky Colonel ‚Äì not the military rank. Sanders held a number of jobs in his early life, such as steam engine stoker, insurance salesman and filling station operator. He began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in North Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. During that time Sanders developed his \\"secret recipe\\" and his patented method of cooking chicken in a pressure fryer. Sanders recognized the potential of the restaurant franchising concept, and the first KFC franchise opened in South Salt Lake, Utah in 1952. When his original restaurant closed, he devoted himself full-time to franchising his fried chicken throughout the country. The company's rapid expansion across the United States and overseas became overwhelming for Sanders. In 1964, then 73 years old, he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey for $2 million ($ million today). However, he retained control of operations in Canada, and he became a salaried brand ambassador for Kentucky Fried Chicken. In his later years, he became highly critical of the food served by KFC restaurants, as he believed they had cut costs and allowed quality to deteriorate. Life and career=1890‚Äì1906: Early life Sanders at age 7 with his mother in 1897 Harland David Sanders was born on September 9, 1890, in a four-room house located east of Henryville, Indiana.Klotter, The Human Tradition in the New South, p. 130. He was the oldest of three children born to Wilbur David and Margaret Ann (n√©e Dunlevy) Sanders. His mother was of Irish and Dutch descent. The family attended the Advent Christian Church. His father was a mild and affectionate man who worked his 80-acre farm, until he broke his leg after a fall. He then worked as a butcher in Henryville for two years. Sanders' mother was a devout Christian and strict parent, continuously warning her children of \\"the evils of alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and whistling on Sundays.\\" Sanders' father died in 1895. His mother got work in a tomato cannery, and the young Harland was left to look after and cook for his siblings. By the age of seven, he was reportedly skilled with bread and vegetables, and improving with meat; the children foraged for food while their mother was away for days at a time for work. When he was 10, Sanders began to work as a farmhand. In 1902, Sanders' mother remarried to William Broaddus, and the family moved to Greenwood, Indiana. Sanders had a tumultuous relationship with his stepfather. In 1903, he dropped out of seventh grade (later stating that \\"algebra's what drove me off\\"), and went to live and work on a nearby farm. At age 13, he left home. He then took a job painting horse carriages in Indianapolis. When he was 14, he moved to southern Indiana to work as a farmhand. He also left school at 12 to support his family as well. 1906‚Äì1930: Various jobs In 1906, with his mother's approval, Sanders left the area to live with his uncle in New Albany, Indiana.Klotter, The Human Tradition in the New South, p. 131. His uncle worked for the streetcar company, and secured Sanders a job as a conductor. Sanders falsified his date of birth and enlisted in the United States Army in October 1906, completing his service commitment as a wagoner (see teamster) in Cuba. He was honorably discharged in February 1907 and moved to Sheffield, Alabama, where his uncle lived. There, he met his brother Clarence, who had also moved there in order to escape their stepfather. The uncle worked for the Southern Railway, and secured Sanders a job there as a blacksmith's helper in the workshops. After two months, Sanders moved to Jasper, Alabama, where he got a job cleaning out the ash pans of trains from the Northern Alabama Railroad (a division of the Southern Railway) when they had finished their runs. Sanders progressed to become a fireman (steam engine stoker) from the age of 16. He worked the job for nearly three years until he was fired for \\"insubordination\\" after he got sick. Sanders found laboring work with the Norfolk and Western Railway from 1910. While working on the railroad, he met Josephine King of Jasper, Alabama, and they were married shortly afterwards. They would go on to have a son, Harland, Jr., who died in 1932 from infected tonsils, and two daughters, Margaret Sanders and Mildred Sanders Ruggles.Josh Kegley, Daughter of Colonel Sanders dies at age 91 , Lexington Herald-Leader, September 25, 2010. He then found work as a fireman on the Illinois Central Railroad, and he and his family moved to Jackson, Tennessee. By night, Sanders studied law by correspondence through the La Salle Extension University. Sanders lost his job at Illinois after brawling with a colleague. While Sanders moved to work for the Rock Island Railroad, Josephine and the children went to live with her parents. After a while, Sanders began to practice law in Little Rock, which he did for three years, earning enough in fees for his family to move with him. His legal career ended after a courtroom brawl with his own client destroyed his reputation. This period represented a real low point for Sanders. As his biographer John Ed Pearce wrote, \\"[Sanders] had encountered repeated failure largely through bullheadedness, a lack of self- control, impatience, and a self-righteous lack of diplomacy.\\" Following the incident, Sanders was forced to move back in with his mother in Henryville, and went to work as a laborer on the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1916, the family moved to Jeffersonville, where Sanders got a job selling life insurance for the Prudential Life Insurance Company. Sanders was eventually fired for insubordination. He moved to Louisville and got a sales job with Mutual Benefit Life of New Jersey. In 1920, Sanders established a ferry boat company, which operated a boat on the Ohio River between Jeffersonville and Louisville. He canvassed for funding, becoming a minority shareholder himself, and was appointed secretary of the company. The ferry was an instant success.Klotter, The Human Tradition in the New South, p. 134. Around 1922 he took a job as secretary at the Chamber of Commerce in Columbus, Indiana. He admitted that he was not very good at the job, and resigned after less than a year. Sanders cashed in his ferry boat company shares for $22,000 ($ today) and used the money to establish a company manufacturing acetylene lamps. The venture failed after Delco introduced an electric lamp that it sold on credit. Sanders moved to Winchester, Kentucky, to work as a salesman for the Michelin Tire Company. He lost his job in 1924 when Michelin closed its New Jersey manufacturing plant. In 1924, by chance, he met the general manager of Standard Oil of Kentucky, who asked him to run a service station in Nicholasville. In 1930, the station closed as a result of the Great Depression. 1930‚Äì1952: Later career Sanders working in his cafe at Corbin, Kentucky, s In 1930, the Shell Oil Company offered Sanders a service station in North Corbin, Kentucky, rent free, in return for paying the company a percentage of sales. Sanders began to serve chicken dishes and other meals such as country ham and steaks. Initially he served the customers in his adjacent living quarters before opening a restaurant. It was during this period that Sanders was involved in a shootout with Matt Stewart, a local competitor, over the repainting of a sign directing traffic to his station. Stewart killed a Shell employee who was with Sanders and was convicted of murder, eliminating Sanders's competition. Sanders was commissioned as a Kentucky colonel in 1935 by Kentucky governor Ruby Laffoon. His local popularity grew, and, in 1939, food critic Duncan Hines visited Sanders's restaurant and included it in Adventures in Good Eating, his guide to restaurants throughout the US. The entry read: In July 1939, Sanders acquired a motel in Asheville, North Carolina. His North Corbin restaurant and motel was destroyed in a fire in November 1939, and Sanders had it rebuilt as a motel with a 140-seat restaurant. By July 1940, Sanders had finalized his \\"Secret Recipe\\" for frying chicken in a pressure fryer that cooked the chicken faster than pan frying. As the United States entered World War II in December 1941, gas was rationed, and as the tourism dried up, Sanders was forced to close his Asheville motel. He went to work as a supervisor in Seattle until the latter part of 1942. He later ran cafeterias for the government at an ordnance works in Tennessee, followed by a job as assistant cafeteria manager in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He left his mistress, Claudia Ledington-Price, as manager of the North Corbin restaurant and motel. In 1942, he sold the Asheville business. In 1947, he and Josephine divorced and Sanders married Claudia in 1949, as he had long desired.Klotter, The Human Tradition in the New South, p. 142. Sanders was \\"re-commissioned\\" as a Kentucky colonel in 1950 by his friend, Governor Lawrence Wetherby. 1952‚Äì1980: Kentucky Fried Chicken The world's first KFC franchise, located in South Salt Lake, Utah In 1952, Sanders franchised his secret recipe \\"Kentucky Fried Chicken\\" for the first time, to Pete Harman of South Salt Lake, Utah, the operator of one of that city's largest restaurants. In the first year of selling the product, restaurant sales more than tripled, with 75% of the increase coming from sales of fried chicken. For Harman, the addition of fried chicken was a way of differentiating his restaurant from competitors; in Utah, a product hailing from Kentucky was unique and evoked imagery of Southern hospitality. Don Anderson, a sign painter hired by Harman, coined the name Kentucky Fried Chicken. After Harman's success, several other restaurant owners franchised the concept and paid Sanders $0.04 per chicken. Sanders believed that his North Corbin restaurant would remain successful indefinitely, but at age 65 sold it after the new Interstate 75 reduced customer traffic.I've Got a Secret interview, originally broadcast April 6, 1964 (rebroadcast by GSN March 30, 2008). Left only with his savings and $105 a month from Social Security, Sanders decided to begin to franchise his chicken concept in earnest, and traveled the US looking for suitable restaurants. After closing the North Corbin site, Sanders and Claudia opened a new restaurant and company headquarters in Shelbyville in 1959. Often sleeping in the back of his car, Sanders visited restaurants, offered to cook his chicken, and if workers liked it negotiated franchise rights. Although such visits required much time, eventually potential franchisees began visiting Sanders instead. He ran the company while Claudia mixed and shipped the spices to restaurants. The franchise approach became highly successful; KFC was one of the first fast food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada and later in the UK, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Sanders obtained a patent protecting his method of pressure frying chicken in 1962, and trademarked the phrase \\"It's Finger Lickin' Good\\" in 1963. The company's rapid expansion to more than 600 locations became overwhelming for the aging Sanders. In 1964, then 73 years old, he sold the Kentucky Fried Chicken corporation for $2 million ($ million today) to a partnership of Kentucky businessmen headed by John Y. Brown Jr., a 29-year-old lawyer and future governor of Kentucky, and Jack C. Massey, a venture capitalist and entrepreneur. Sanders became a salaried brand ambassador. The initial deal did not include the Canadian operations, which Sanders retained, or the franchising rights in the UK, Florida, Utah, and Montana, which Sanders had already sold to others. In 1965, Sanders moved to Mississauga, Ontario to oversee his Canadian franchises and continued to collect franchise and appearance fees both in Canada and in the US. Sanders bought and lived in a bungalow at 1337 Melton Drive in the Lakeview area of Mississauga from 1965 to 1980. In September 1970 he and his wife were baptized in the Jordan River.Klotter, The Human Tradition in the New South, p. 153. He also befriended Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell. Sanders remained the company's symbol after selling it, traveling a year on the company's behalf and filming many TV commercials and appearances. He retained much influence over executives and franchisees, who respected his culinary expertise and feared what The New Yorker described as \\"the force and variety of his swearing\\" when a restaurant or the company varied from what executives described as \\"the Colonel's chicken\\". One change the company made was to the gravy, which Sanders had bragged was so good that \\"it'll make you throw away the durn chicken and just eat the gravy\\" but which the company simplified to reduce time and cost. As late as 1979 Sanders made surprise visits to KFC restaurants, and if the food disappointed him, he denounced it to the franchisee as \\"God-damned slop\\" or pushed it onto the floor. In 1973, Sanders sued Heublein Inc.‚Äîthe then parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken‚Äîover the alleged misuse of his image in promoting products he had not helped develop. In 1975, Heublein Inc. unsuccessfully sued Sanders for libel after he publicly described their gravy as being \\"sludge\\" with a \\"wall-paper taste\\". Sanders and his wife reopened their Shelbyville restaurant as \\"Claudia Sanders, The Colonel's Lady\\" and served KFC-style chicken there as part of a full-service dinner menu, and talked about expanding the restaurant into a chain. He was sued by the company for it. After reaching a settlement with Heublein, he sold the Colonel's Lady restaurant, and it has continued to operate, currently as the Claudia Sanders Dinner House. It serves his \\"original recipe\\" fried chicken as part of its non-fast-food dinner menu, and it is the only non-KFC restaurant that serves an authorized version of the fried chicken recipe. Sanders remained critical of Kentucky Fried Chicken's food. In the late 1970s he told the Louisville Courier-Journal:Quoted in Public image and personality After being recommissioned as a Kentucky colonel in 1950 by Governor Lawrence Wetherby, Sanders began to dress the part, growing a goatee and wearing a black frock coat (later switching to a white suit), a string tie, and referring to himself as \\"Colonel\\". His associates went along with the title change, \\"jokingly at first and then in earnest\\", according to biographer Josh Ozersky. He never wore anything else in public during the last 20 years of his life, using a heavy wool suit in the winter and a light cotton suit in the summer. He bleached his mustache and goatee to match his white hair. John Y. Brown Jr. remembered Sanders as \\"a brilliant man with a gourmet flair for food, a visionary and a great motivator, with the style of a showman and the discipline of a Vince Lombardi.\\" Death Sanders was diagnosed with acute leukemia in June 1980. He died at Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, of pneumonia on December 16, 1980, at the age of 90. Sanders had remained active until the month before his death, appearing in his white suit to crowds. His body lay in state in the rotunda of the Kentucky State Capitol in Frankfort after a funeral service at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Chapel, which was attended by more than 1,000 people. Sanders was buried in his characteristic white suit and black western string tie in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville. Legacy By the time of Sanders' death, there were an estimated 6,000 KFC outlets in 48 countries worldwide, with $2 billion ($ billion today) of sales annually. As a symbol of the KFC brand A fictionalized Colonel Sanders has repeatedly appeared as a mascot in KFC's advertising and branding. Sanders has been voiced by impressionists in radio ads, and from 1998 to 2001 an animated version of him voiced by Randy Quaid appeared in television commercials. In May 2015, KFC reprised the Colonel Sanders character in new television advertisements, played by comedian Darrell Hammond. Some commentators felt the new portrayal was distasteful and disrespectful of the actual man's legacy. In August 2015, KFC launched a new campaign, this time with comedian Norm Macdonald portraying Sanders; the first ad of the campaign makes direct reference to the Hammond campaign, with a brief piece of footage of Hammond followed by Macdonald's Colonel declaring his predecessor an impostor. In February 2016, yet another portrayal was introduced with Jim Gaffigan as the Colonel, shown bolting awake in bed and telling his wife about his recurring nightmare of Macdonald's Colonel \\"pretending to be me\\". By July 2016, George Hamilton was playing Colonel Sanders, parlaying his famous tan into an advertisement for KFC's \\"extra crispy\\" chicken. During the airing of the 2016 SummerSlam, a commercial aired of WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler dressed up as Colonel Sanders beating up a man in a chicken suit (played by fellow wrestler The Miz) in a wrestling ring. In September 2016 comedian Rob Riggle played Sanders in an ad introducing a football team named \\"The Kentucky Buckets\\". In January 2017, to advertise their \\"Georgia Gold Honey Mustard BBQ\\" Chicken offerings, actor Billy Zane took over the role as the \\"Solid Gold Colonel\\". In April 2017, actor Rob Lowe was announced as the newest actor in the role of Colonel Sanders. Lowe said that as a child, he actually got to meet Harland Sanders.KFC Explores The Final Frontier With Colonel Rob Lowe (Apr 21, 2017, 08:59 ET) Quote: \\"My grandfather was the head of the Ohio chapter of the National Restaurant Association in the 1960s and took me to meet Colonel Harland Sanders when I was a kid. It was a big deal. I thought this would be a nice homage to both Colonel Sanders and to my grandfather,\\" said Lowe. \\"Plus, we're sending the Zinger chicken sandwich to space. You kind of can't beat that.\\" WWE would return to using Colonel Sanders during 2017, showing ads of Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle playing him, as well as announcing that Colonel Sanders would be available as a playable character in WWE 2K18 (accessible through the \\"create- a-wrestler\\" feature) as part of a product placement deal with KFC. Ray Liotta then portrayed Sanders. Singer Reba McEntire was named as the newest Sanders in January 2018. , actor Jason Alexander and professional strongman and actor Haf√æ√≥r J√∫l√≠us Bj√∂rnsson both portray Colonel Sanders. In early 2019, Peter Weller portrayed a RoboCop version of Colonel Sanders. Later that year, Sean Astin played a Rudy Ruettiger version of the Colonel to commemorate the beginning of the NFL season. Beyond KFC The Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball league has developed an urban legend of the \\"Curse of the Colonel\\". A statue of Colonel Sanders was thrown into a river and lost during a 1985 fan celebration, and (according to the legend) the \\"curse\\" has caused Japan's Hanshin Tigers to perform poorly since the incident. Characters based on Colonel Sanders have appeared in popular fiction. The Colonel appears as a character within the DC Comics multiverse in three promotional issues, with titles parodying other DC Comics titles - The Colonel of Two Worlds (a parody of Flash of Two Worlds), The Colonel Corps: The Crisis of Infinite Colonels (a parody of Crisis on Infinite Earths _),_ and Across The Universe, teaming up with characters such as Green Lantern and Flash, and alternate versions of himself (such as a female version, a Teen Titans Go! version, and a chicken version) to battle villains such as the \\"Anti-Colonel\\" of Earth-3, \\"Colonel Grodd\\" (a Colonel version of Gorilla Grodd) and Larfleeze. The writer of the comics, Tony Bedard, said \\"It's been an honor, a privilege, and just plain fun working on the last two KFC comics. I'm super-excited the story is a trilogy now, with the Colonel planet-hopping across the DC Universe. As a former Green Lantern writer, it's great to revisit Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps.\\" In the novel Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami, Colonel Sanders appears when an \\"abstract concept\\" takes on the appearance of \\"a famous capitalist icon.\\" In 2017 KFC released a 96-page romance novella, Tender Wings of Desire, in time for Mother's Day. Set in Victorian England, it centers on Lady Madeline Parker, who \\"must choose between a life of order and a man of passion\\", and featuring Sanders as the love interest, and ostensibly the writer. It is available on Amazon for free. One of Colonel Sanders' white suits with its black clip-on bow-tie was sold at auction for $21,510 by Heritage Auctions on June 22, 2013.Brown, Angela K, President of KFC Japan buys Colonel Sanders' trademark white suit at auction for $21K Associated Press 6/22/13 The suit had been given to Cincinnati resident Mike Morris by Sanders, who was close to Morris's family. The Morris family house was purchased by Col. Sanders, and Sanders lived with the family for six months. The suit was purchased by Kentucky Fried Chicken of Japan president Maseo \\"Charlie\\" Watanabe. Watanabe put on the famous suit after placing the winning bid at the auction event in Dallas, Texas. In 2011, a manuscript of a book on cooking that Sanders apparently wrote in the mid-1960s was found in KFC archives. It includes some cooking recipes from Sanders as well as anecdotes and life lessons. KFC said it was planning to try some of the recipes and to publish the 200-page manuscript online. Charitable giving Before his death Sanders used his stock holdings to create the Colonel Harland Sanders Charitable Organization, a registered Canadian charity. The wing of Mississauga Hospital for women's and children's care is named The Colonel Harland Sanders Family Care Centre in honor of his substantial donation. Sanders' foundation has also made sizeable donations to other Canadian children's hospitals including the McMaster Children's Hospital, IWK Health Centre, and Stollery Children's Hospital. The Toronto-based foundation disbursed $500,000 to other Canadian charities in 2016, according to its tax return filed with the Canada Revenue Agency.

He was the founder of the Rochefort line of the Rohans which still continue to live today. He was styled the Prince of Rochefort as well as the Prince of Montauban. Biography Born in Paris to the Prince and Princess of Gu√©m√©n√©, he was the couples fourth child and third son. His older brother Hercule M√©riadec, Prince of Gu√©m√©n√© was the senior male line as their older brother Fran√ßois Armand, Prince of Montbazon died without surviving issue to carry on the Gu√©m√©n√© succession. As he was the younger son, he was given the title of prince de Rochefort, a title which would remain with him till his death. As a member of the House of Rohan he enjoyed the prestigious rank of a Foreign Prince in the early 17th century as the Rohans claimed their ancestry back to the Dukes of Brittany. The title of Prince of Rochefort was created a hereditary title in 1728. He married El√©onore Eug√©nie de B√©thisy de M√©zi√®res, younger daughter of Eug√®ne Marie de B√©thisy, Marquis de M√©zi√®res, and El√©onore Oglethorpe, like her sisters, a loyal and active Jacobite, who was in turn a daughter of Theophilus Oglethorpe, an English soldier and MP. The couple were married on 23 September 1722 and produced four children. His eldest son, known as Charles Jules, was the father of Charlotte Louise Doroth√©e de Rohan, secret wife of Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien. Charles Jules' son Charles Louis married Marie Louise de Rohan, daughter of Henri Louis, Prince of Gu√©m√©n√© (of the mainline) and Victoire de RohanDaughter of Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise and Princess Anne Therese of Savoy (of the middle line). Charles' descendants also claim the Duchy of Bouillon through the marriage of Charles Louis and Marie Louise. His only daughter, known as Louise, was the wife of the Prince of Brionne, a Prince of Lorraine. Through their daughter Jos√©phine, who married the Prince of Carignano, the present House of Savoy are direct descendants of Charles and his wife. Charles died at the age of sixty nine. He was succeeded as head of the Rochefort line by his son, Charles Jules.

The band consists of Josh Klinghoffer (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Clint Walsh (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Jonathan Hischke (bass) and Eric Gardner (drums). Klinghoffer, Walsh and Gardner were all previously members of the touring incarnation of Gnarls Barkley, and were subsequently joined by Hella bassist Jonathan Hischke to create Dot Hacker. Prior to Klinghoffer joining the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the band recorded its debut album, Inhibition, which was released on May 1, 2012. History After meeting multi-instrumentalist Josh Klinghoffer through his Hella bandmates Spencer Seim and Dan Elkan, bassist Jonathan Hischke moved to Los Angeles, California, in 2008, to begin work on a potential project that would include Klinghoffer, and fellow Gnarls Barkley touring musicians, Clint Walsh and Eric Gardner. Regarding the band, Hischke noted, > \\"It‚Äôs this interesting thing, because it‚Äôs this band made of kind of young > session musician types: Josh played with Beck, and PJ Harvey and John > Frusciante, now he‚Äôs the new Chili Pepper. Then there‚Äôs Eric Gardner our > drummer, he‚Äôs played with Charlotte Gainsbourg, Gnarls Barkley, you know, > Tom Morello, stuff like that. Clint Walsh has done Gnarls, The Scream, > Electric Guest, and many others. So they invited me in to jam with them and > I moved to LA to pretty much do that.\\" Taking its name from drummer Eric Gardner's grandmother, Dot Hacker subsequently began recording its debut album in between the band members' other commitments. In October 2009, Klinghoffer joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers, delaying the album's release for an extended period of time. Regarding its eventual release, Hishcke noted, \\"This is quite a busy group of people, even more so now. We recorded off and on for many months in our really comfy and clubhouse-like home studio. Then the completed album was in purgatory for a while as we all did different things.\\" On February 21, 2012, the band released its debut EP, Dot Hacker on ORG Music, with its full-length album Inhibition released on May 1, 2012. With Klinghoffer having a break from his Chili Peppers duties, June 2013 saw Dot Hacker performing in California and Las Vegas.

He came to England in 1717 as an immigrant, as the apprentice of a wool merchant. His decision to settle permanently in England started the Baring family on the road to becoming one of the leading family banking firms in the world.  Early life  Johann Baring was born in Bremen, one of the old Hanseatic cities of northern Germany. He was the posthumous son of Franz Baring (1657‚Äì1697), a professor of theology in Bremen, who died aged forty only a few weeks before Johann was born, by his wife Rebecca Vogds, the daughter of one of Bremen's leading wool merchants. Following the early death of Johann's father, he was brought up by the Vogds family.  Move to England  At the age of twenty Johann was sent to England to learn the wool trade in Exeter, Devon. Originally having planned to return to Bremen after his apprenticeship, he decided to stay in England, where he obtained citizenship in 1723 and Anglicised his first name from Johann to John. Marriage and progeny John married Elizabeth Vowler (1702‚Äì1766), the daughter of a prosperous Exeter grocer, who brought with her a large dowry of ¬£20,000 and business sense to match that of her new husband. By Elizabeth he had the following progeny, 4 sons and 1 daughter: *John Baring (1730‚Äì1816), who in partnership with his younger brother Francis, established the London merchant house of John and Francis Baring Company, which eventually became Barings Bank *Thomas Baring (1733‚Äì1758) *Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet (1740‚Äì1810), who in partnership with his elder brother John, established the London merchant house of John and Francis Baring Company, which eventually became Barings Bank *Charles Baring (1742‚Äì1829), 4th son, of Courtland, Exmouth, Devon, who married Margaret Gould (1743‚Äì1803), daughter and eventual heiress in her issue of William Drake Gould (1719‚Äì1767) of Lew Trenchard. Her monument survives in Lympstone Church, Devon.Vivian, p. 425. The Gould family was descended from a certain John Gold, a crusader present at the siege of Damietta in 1217 who for his valour was granted in 1220 by Ralph de Vallibus an estate at Seaborough in Somerset.Vivian, Lt.Col. J. L., (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1531, 1564 & 1620, Exeter, 1895, pedigree of Gould, pp. 418‚Äì432. His son William Baring (d. 1846), JP, DL, in 1795 assumed by royal licence the additional surname and arms of Gould, in accordance with the terms of his inheritance of the manor of Lew Trenchard. William's grandson was the author Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould (1834‚Äì1924) of Lew Trenchard.Vivian, pp. 425‚Äì6. *Elizabeth Baring (1744‚Äì1809) who in 1780 married John Dunning (1731‚Äì1783) of Ashburton, Devon, MP for Calne, who in 1782 was created Baron Ashburton.John Dunning. Residences By 1737 the Barings moved from the City of Exeter and purchased as their country residence Larkbeare House, (a substantial 16th century house a fragment of which survives at no. 38 Holloway Street, Exeter, having been largely demolished by 19th century road-wideningPevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p. 425.) and thirty seven acres of land, then just outside the city. Adjacent to Larkbeare was the estate of Mount Radford, which was later the family's residence.Pevsner, p. 425. Shortly before his death John purchased Lindridge House, Bishopsteignton, near Exeter. Death By the time of John's death aged fifty-one, the Barings were one of the wealthiest families in the West Country. Baring Crescent, Exeter, developed with Regency villas 1818‚Äì1828, was named after the family.

The test has been replaced by the safer skin prick test. The PK test involves transferring serum from the test subject to another healthy person, essentially using the second person as a mixing vessel for antibodies and antigen. This is a pathway for transmission of blood-borne ailments like variant Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease, AIDS, and others, which is why the test is no longer recommended. Or in simple words, a test for the presence of immediate hypersensitivity in humans; test serum from an atopic individual is injected intradermally into a normal subject; the normal subject is challenged 24‚Äì48 hours later with the antigen suspected of causing the immediate hypersensitivity reaction in the atopic individual. Procedure Serum, suspected to contain IgE antibodies, is drawn from the allergic (atopic) patient. This serum is injected intradermally into a non- allergic person. The suspected antigens are then intradermally injected into the non-allergic person 24‚Äì48 hours later. If the person being tested for an allergy has made antibodies for the antigen, this will cause a local reaction in the non-allergic person when the antibodies mix with the antigen. This demonstrates a type I hypersensitivity reaction, and the allergic reaction to the injected antigen is confirmed for the patient being tested. A positive PK test usually appears as a wheal and flare. Development The test was developed by Otto Prausnitz and Heinz K√ºstner. The first PK test occurred in 1921 when Prausnitz injected K√ºstner's serum into his abdominal skin. K√ºstner had previously noted that he developed allergic symptoms after eating fish. After eating some fish, Prausnitz's skin became hot, red, and swollen at the site of the serum injection, confirming their hypothesis that K√ºstner was allergic to fish. Reversed PK test A reversed Prausnitz‚ÄìK√ºstner test involves injecting antibodies into the skin of a person who already has the antigen. A wheal and flare in the skin also demonstrates a positive reverse PK test.

It is one of 19 recognized subspecies of Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami) that are spread throughout the arid regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico. Like Dipodomys merriami, the San Bernardino kangaroo rat has the diagnostic trait of having four toes on its hind legs. Additionally, because of its geographic isolation, it has become the most highly differentiated subspecies of D. merriami. Description The San Bernardino kangaroo rat follows the same body plan as Dipodomys merriami and other kangaroo rat species: large hind feet for jumping, long tail for balance while jumping, cheek pouches for foraging, and so on. Its body is about 95 millimeters (3.7 inches) long, with a total length of 230‚Äì235 mm (9-9.3 in). Its body color is weakly yellow with a heavy overwash of dusky brown. The tail stripes are medium to dark brown, with dark brown tail hairs and foot pads. Its flanks and cheeks are dusky. D. m. parvus is substantially darker and smaller than the other two D. merriami subspecies that live in Southern California (Dipodomys merriami merriami and Dipodomys merriami collinus). This marked adaptation to its habitat has led Lidicker to say that \\"it seems likely to have achieved nearly species rank.\\" (Lidicker 1960) Habitat In most heteromyids, soil texture is a primary factor in determining species distributions. (Brown and Harney, 1993) The range of D. m. parvus is isolated from members of D. m. merriami at the northernmost extent of their range by 8-13 kilometers (5‚Äì8 miles) of unsuitable habitat, indicating possible past intergradation of the two subspecies. San Bernardino kangaroo rats inhabit places with sandy loam substrates, characteristic of alluvial fans and flood plains, where they are able to dig small, simple burrows. Plant life in such areas is typically dominated by chaparral and coastal sage scrub (soft chaparral). These alluvial scrub habitats can be classified as pioneer, intermediate, and mature, in order of decreased frequency of flooding and increased density of plants. Of these subsections of this particular habitat, D. m. parvus is most populous in intermediate alluvial scrub. Distribution Dipodomys merriami parvus is found unequally distributed between seven isolated locations. The four smallest remnant populations reside near City Creek, Etiwanda, Reche Canyon, and South Bloomington. The largest populations with the most area of suitable habitat are located near the Santa Ana River, Lytle and Cajon Creek, and the San Jacinto River. The historical range of D. m. parvus encompassed roughly 320,000 acres (128,000 hectares). By the 1930s its range had been reduced to roughly 28,000 acres (11,200 ha). In 1998, its range was approximated at only 3,247 acres (1,299 ha). Human-caused threats According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, D. m. parvus is threatened by \\"habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation by sand and gravel mining, flood control projects, urban development, vandalism, and inadequate regulatory mechanisms.\\" While sand and gravel mining and urban development have direct impact upon the habitat, flood control projects such as dams, levees, and berms indirectly change the habitat by preventing flooding. Curtailed flooding in these habitats will cause succession of the preferred intermediate alluvial scrub habitat to mature habitat, as removal and deposition of sand that would normally come with flooding has ceased. Furthermore, in areas with sufficient soil moisture, shrub densities will exceed the sparse to moderate densities where this subspecies lives. (Hanes et al. 1989, McKernan 1997) Areas that are affected include the Santa Ana River, Lytle and Cajon Creek, and the San Jacinto River. Urban development, in addition to directly destroying habitat, brings with it domesticated cats, a documented predator of the San Bernardino kangaroo rat. The likelihood of predation increases as the interface between natural and urban habitats is increased. In addition to predation, the isolated ranges and small populations of D. m. parvus makes increased mortality rates more likely. Reduction in habitat size and species isolation leads to population loss \\"greater than expected from habitat loss alone,\\" and this trend is well documented for rodents and other vertebrates. (Soule¬¥ et al. 1992, Andren 1994, Bolger et al. 1997) Isolated populations, being restricted to relatively small local areas, are more subject to extirpation from natural or human caused events, such as floods or drought. Due to their small population, they may also lose genetic variability and experience inbreeding depression. Isolation of groups is increased by the construction of railroad tracks, roads, and flood control channels. Extirpation from flooding is becoming more likely as urban development pushes the remaining populations to the active flood plain. Due to the engineering of these allotted flood areas, the frequency and severity of flooding makes them uninhabitable. Likewise, in the areas where flooding has been diverted, the canopy density of the brush has increased beyond suitable levels for D. m. parvus. Failed government regulation The Fish and Wildlife Service notes several points of inadequate regulation at the time of publication (1998): #Lead agencies made choices detrimental to D. m. parvus under California Environmental Quality Act and National Environmental Policy Act, #California Environmental Quality Act rulings are subject to overriding social or economic decisions, #California's Natural Community Conservation Planning program, which is responsible for conserving alluvial scrub, is a voluntary program which San Bernardino and Riverside counties had not joined, #The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 requires that the parts of the D. m. parvus range used for mining undergo land rehabilitation; however, this will not likely have a beneficial effect on the species due to the changed topology and hydrology, #The Bureau of Land Management set aside three areas along the Santa Ana River for preservation of federally listed species such as D. m. parvus, the Santa Ana River woolly star (Eriastrum densifolium ssp. sanctorum), the slender-horned spineflower, and the California gnatcatcher. However, these areas are also allotted for potential water conservation projects such as percolation basins, and the areas allotted for the federally listed species seldom overlap with the range of D. m. parvus. #Finally, the Clean Water Act does not provide for conservation of threatened animals, and while projects executed under that act require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, that agency has \\"allowed projects to proceed without their overview\\" within their jurisdiction.

A member of the House of Rohan, she was wife of the Prince of Soubise. It was she who brought the lordship of Soubise into the junior line of the House of Rohan. She was for some time the mistress of Louis XIV. She was sometimes called Madame de Frontenay due to being the Dame of Frontenay. Biography Born to Henri Chabot and his wife Marguerite de Rohan, she was the third of five children. Her parents' marriage had caused a scandal as Marguerite was a Foreign Princess as a member of the House of Rohan.This prestigious rank had been given to the House of Rohan early in the 17th century as they were descended from the old Rulers of Brittany and their hereditary control of the Archbishopric of Strasbourg, which made them princes of the Holy Roman Empire This had obliged Louis XIV to issue a decree that she was able to marry Henri and still hold her high rank at court. Her family were allowed to bear the name of Rohan-Chabot, the Rohans being her maternal family. Her younger sister Jeanne Pelagie de Rohan-Chabot married the Prince of Epinoy, who was the paternal grandfather of Louis de Melun, Duke of Joyeuse, and Anne Julie de Melun - a future Princess of Soubise. On 17 April 1663, at not more than fifteen years old, Anne married Lieutenant-General Fran√ßois de Rohan. Fran√ßois was a widower and the younger son of Hercule de Rohan, Duke of Montbazon, and his wife . His older half sister was Marie de Rohan, Duchess of Chevreuse, a key figure in the Fronde (also known as the Lorraine War) an event which had a profound influence on the spirit of the era. She was presented at court in 1665. Anne was the Dame of Soubise in her own right. As such, at the time of her marriage she passed the title onto her husband. The couple styled themselves as the Prince and Princess of Soubise after March 1667 based on letters patent which raised the title of Soubise to a principality. Anne was also the Dame of Frontenay in her own right. She received an excellent education for the time . Although only a teenager, she was devoted to her husband. She was also a great beauty of the era with her red hair, fresh pale skin and almond eyes. Known as la Belle Florice, she maintained her beauty by keeping to a strict diet of chicken and salad, fruit, dairy products, and water with wine sometimes added.Fraser, Antonia (Lady), Love and Louis XIV, Nan A. Talese, 2006, p.114 Anne became Louis XIV's mistress in 1669 when he was staying at the Ch√¢teau of Chambord where Anne was also present. At the time, Louis' affections were split between Louise de La Valli√®re and her future successor Madame de Montespan. Some time later Anne gave birth to her second son, Hercule M√©riadec de Rohan (future Prince of Soubise yet styled at birth as the Duke of Rohan-Rohan). In January 1674 Anne became a Lady-in- waiting to Queen Marie Th√©r√®se and five months later she gave birth to another son Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan. It was by then common knowledge that the King and Anne were lovers and it was commonly said that her son was really from Louis XIV and not Monsieur de Soubise although he acknowledged the baby as his son. Although nothing was proved, Louis XIV did allot a large sum of money to the compliant husband, \\"in consideration of his services.\\" In the portraits of the time, the similarity between the king and Armand is obvious. Her husband quickly became wealthy. The couple's affair ended in 1675 having been on and off for some six years. At the same time the relationship between Madame de Montespan and the King also came to an end.Reconciliation with her husband came in the form of a daughter in 1677 and a son in 1678 She persuaded her husband to purchase the H√¥tel de Guise from the trustees of the late Duchess of Guise. He bought the property on 27 March 1700 and renamed it the H√¥tel de Soubise. She died there of a cold on 4 February 1709.\\"Mitford, Nancy, The Sun King\\" p.221 Issue *Anne Marguerite de Rohan, Abbess of Jouarre (5 August 1664 - 26 June 1721) no issue; *Louis de Rohan, Prince of Rohan (11 March 1666 - 5 November 1689) no issue; *Constance √âmilie de Rohan (1667 - ?) married Don Jos√© Rodrigo da Camara, 2nd Count of Ribeira Grande (Portuguese nobleman) and had issue; *Hercule M√©riadec de Rohan, Prince of Maubuisson, Duke of Rohan-Rohan (8 May 1669 - 26 January 1749) married Anne Genevi√®ve de L√©vis, had issue; married Marie Sophie de Courcillon, no issue; *Alexandre M√©riadec de Rohan (19 July 1670 - 9 March 1687) no issue; *Henri Louis de Rohan, Chevalier de Rohan (4 January 1672 - 30 July 1693) no issue; *Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan, Cardinal de Soubise (26 June 1674 - 19 July 1749) Grand Almoner of France, suspected issue of Louis XIV, never married; *Sophronie-P√©lagie de Rohan (2 July 1678 - ?) married Don Alphonso Francisco de Vasconcellos, had issue; *√âl√©onore Marie de Rohan, Abbess in Origny (25 August 1679 - 2 November 1753) no issue; *Maximilien Gaston de Rohan (1680 - 23 May 1706) died in the Battle of Ramillies, no issue; *Fr√©d√©ric Paul Malo de Rohan (1682) no issue.

An example of early sentence spacing with an em- quad between sentences (1909). Typesetting in all European languages enjoys a long tradition of using spaces of varying widths for the express purpose of enhancing readability. American, English, French, and other European typesetters' style guides‚Äîalso known as printers' rules‚Äîspecified spacing rules which were all essentially identical from the 18th century onwards. Early English language guides by Jacobi in the UKJacobi, Charles Thomas (1890) Printing London: C. Whittingham; Jacobi, Charles Thomas (1892) Some Notes on Books and Printing; a Guide for Authors, Publishers, & Others, New and enl. Ed. London: C. Whittingham and MacKellar, Harpel, Bishop, and De Vinne in the USMacKellar, Thomas (1866) The American Printer: A Manual of Typography, Containing Complete Instructions for Beginners, as Well as Practical Directions for Managing Every Department of a Printing Office Philadelphia; MacKellar Smiths & Jordan; Harpel, Oscar (1870) Harpel's Typograph, or Book of Specimens Containing Useful Information, Suggestions and a Collection of Examples of Letterpress Job Printing Arranged for the Assistance of Master Printers, Amateurs, Apprentices, and Others Cincinnati Press; Bishop, Henry Gold (1895) The Practical Printer: A Book of Instruction for Beginners; a Book of Reference for the More Advanced, 3rd. ed. Albany; De Vinne, Theodore Low (1901) The Practice of Typography: correct composition: a treatise on spelling, abbreviations, the compounding and division of words, the proper use of figures and numerals. With observations on punctuation and proof-reading. New York, Century Co. specified that sentences would be separated by more space than that of a normal word space. Spaces between sentences were to be em-spaced, and words would normally be 1/3 em-spaced, or occasionally 1/2 em- spaced (see the illustration to the right). This remained standard for quite some time. MacKellar's The American Printer was the dominant language style guide in the US at the time and ran to at least 17 editions between 1866 and 1893, and De Vinne's The Practice of Typography was the undisputed global authority on English-language typesetting style from 1901 until well past Dowding's first formal alternative spacing suggestion in the mid-1950s. Both the American and the UK style guides also specified that spaces should be inserted between punctuation and text. The MacKellar guide described these as hairspaces but itself used a much wider space than was then commonly regarded as a hairspace. Spaces following words or punctuation were subject to line breaks, and spaces between words and closely associated punctuation were non- breaking. Additionally, spaces were (and still are today) varied proportionally in width when justifying lines, originally by hand, later by machine, now usually by software. The spacing differences between traditional typesetting and modern conventional printing standards are easily observed by comparing two different versions of the same book, from the Mabinogion: # 1894: the Badger-in-the-bag game‚Äîtraditional typesetting spacing rules: a single enlarged em-space between sentences # 1999: the Badger-in-the-bag game‚Äîmodern mass-production commercial printing: a single word space between sentences The 1999 example demonstrates the current convention for published work. The 1894 version demonstrates thin-spaced words but em-spaced sentences. It also demonstrates spaces around punctuation according to the rules above and equivalent to French typesetting today. French and English spacing French-spaced typeset text (1874). With the advent of the typewriter in the late nineteenth century, typists adopted approximations of standard spacing practices to fit the limitations of the typewriter itself. French typists used a single space between sentences, consistent with the typeset French spacing technique, whereas English typists used a double space. * French spacing inserted spaces around most punctuation marks, but single-spaced after sentences, colons, and semicolons. * English spacing removed spaces around most punctuation marks, but double-spaced after sentences, colons, and semicolons. These approximations were taught and used as the standard typing techniques in French and English-speaking countries.Igot, Pierre (2006) Microsoft Word and non-breaking spaces: French typography 101 For example, T. S. Eliot typed rather than wrote the manuscript for his classic The Waste Land between 1920 and 1922, and used only English spacing throughout: double-spaced sentences. There is, however, considerable variability in the use of the terms, to the extent that they are often used with the meanings reversed. Here are some definitions of French spacing: * \\"Additional space at the ends of sentences is called 'French Spacing.' It is a very old practice, having been commonplace in books up through the 19th century\\" * \\"Adding two spaces after a period is called French spacing. French spacing was quite common in books before the 19th century. Later it became the norm for typewritten copy.\\" * \\"French spacing: The additional inter-word spacing between sentences can be switched off in TeX and LaTeX with the command \`\\\\frenchspacing\`\\" * \\"Additional space at the ends of sentences is called French spacing, ... In typesetting, a thin space set in addition to the word space achieves French spacing. * \\"French spacing leaves the same amount of white space after all punctuation marks, but leaves some thin space before the ‚Äútall‚Äù punctuation marks...\\" * \\"In ordinary spacing a full em occurs at the end of a sentence. In French spacing the end of a sentence is spaced the same as the balance of the words in the line. * \\"...French spacing. The insertion of fixed space such as an en or an em between sentences instead of a variable word space.\\" This 1960 quotation is the result of some contemporary research: Movement to single sentence spacing A key change in the publishing industry from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century was the enormous growth of mass-produced books and magazines. Increasing commercial pressure to reduce the costs, complexity, and lead-time of printing deeply affected the industry, leading to a widening gap between commercial printing and fine printing.Keefe, H. J. (1939) A Century in Print London: Hazell Watson & Viney, Ltd. For example, T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land was originally published by a high-volume commercial printer according to its house rules and it was not until its third publication that Eliot was satisfied with its typesetting.Rainey, Lawrence (2005) The Annotated Waste Land with Eliot's Contemporary Prose New Haven: Yale University Press The underlying reasons were: * ease and speed, since far less physical type and more importantly far less skilled effort was required * cost, since less work was required and the condensed text required less paper; the bulk of the cost saving was typesetting-related rather than paper-use- related * cultural, since new typesetters (and readers) had grown up with typewriters and the standard typists' spacing approximations of good typesetting Before the First World War virtually all English-language books were printed following standard typesetters' spacing rules. By the end of the Second World War most American books and an increasing proportion of English books were printed following the typewriter's English spacing approximation rules.e.g., Standard typesetters' spacing rules: Linklater, Eric (1954) A year of space The Reprint Society, London; e.g., English spacing: Gordon, Richard (1955) Doctor in the House; Doctor at Sea The Reprint Society, London; e.g., English spacing: Leslie, Doris (1956) Peridot Flight The Book Club, London Around this time, the practice of single spacing became more prevalent. There were various circumstances which could have contributed to the change. For example, there was an increase in high-volume low-cost mass-produced printing (e.g., newspapers, pulp-novels, magazines). Also, a significant innovation in the typewriter was the breaking of the typewriter \\"grid\\" in 1941. \\"The grid\\" referred to the uniform spacing of each letter space in the monospaced font used by the typewriter. In 1941, IBM introduced the Executive, a typewriter that used proportional spacing by \\"breaking each cell of the grid into fifths.\\" Although proportional fonts had been used in various forms in typesetting since the invention of movable type, this innovation broke the hold that the monospaced font had over the typewriter‚Äîreducing the severity of its mechanical limitations. Around the 1950s, single sentence spacing became the standard commercial practice in mass-print-runs in the United States. However, double sentence spacing approximations were retained some in higher- cost printed works. For example, for reasons of readability, the US government's 1959 official style guide mandated double sentence spacing in all government documents‚Äîwhether produced by \\"Teletypesetter, reproduction or other method.\\":United States Government Printing Office Style Manual (1959), paragraph 2.36.1 Single sentence spacing was introduced by professional printers in the United Kingdom as well. The 1947 version of Penguin Composition Rules stated that all Penguin publications would adhere to the following rules: \\"All major punctuation marksfull point, colon, and semicolonshould be followed by the same spacing as is used throughout the rest of the line.\\". Until about the early 1990s, double sentence spacing was still referred to as English spacing (or \\"American typewriter spacing\\"). The computer era The introduction and widespread adoption of non-commandline desktop publishing software on personal computers in the mid-1980s eliminated previous cost-restrictions that had helped fuel the switch to single-spacing. There was no longer any material marginal cost associated with typesetting double-spaces, or even multiple-width spaces. Despite this, resistance to double-spaced sentences started to grow among English-language professional designers and typographers as they became more directly involved with typesetting. Traditional French typists' rules continued to be the uncontested norm in French-speaking countries,FRENCH STYLE GUIDE ‚Äì A Reference Document (2001) Nova Scotia Department of Education but English spacing became increasingly deprecated in English-speaking countries. By the mid-1990s, the term French spacing was occasionally used in America in reference to double sentence spacing. An example of this apparent terminology reversal can be attributed to the University of Chicago Press in 1994. By the mid-2000s this usage had been widely replicated on the Internet, for unclear reasons. Additionally, there has been a designer-led trend towards closer-fitted text in general.Dowding, G. (1954) Finer Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type Wace & Co.: London; Felici 2003; Bringhurst 2004. For example, an increasing number of computer font design guidelines now recommend the use of quarter-em spaces rather than third-em spaces. With regard to spacing, modern designers are retracing the steps of the 19th-century design-led typographer William Morris. Morris rejected the restrictions of commercial typesetting which at the time demanded traditional typesetting's spacing rules, and, declaring a \\"rage for beauty\\", advocated close-set type and dark \\"colour\\" (lack of whitespace, creating uniformity of appearance). However, the reason Donald Knuth gave for creating the TeX typesetting system was his dismay on receiving the proofs of a new edition of his book The Art of Computer Programming at the unreadability of the then new close-fitted phototypesetting technology, which he described as \\"awful\\" due to its \\"poor spacing\\".Knuth, Donald (1986) Remarks to celebrate the publication of Computers and Typesetting Address delivered at the Computer Museum in Boston on May 21, 1986. The full text can be found in TUGboat, 7 (1986), 95‚Äì98Seroul, Raymond; and Levy, Silvio (1991) A Beginners Book of TeX Springer-Verlag, pp 1-2 The leading style guides of Morris's time documented that readers of the time had the same reaction to Morris's output as Knuth did later to phototypesetting's output. De Vinne, for example, wrote in The Practice of Typography: > Printed words need the relief of a surrounding blank as much as figures in a > landscape need background or contrast, perspective or atmosphere. (p. 182) > White space is needed to make printing comprehensible. (page 183) > And in Modern Book Composition he wrote: > Unleaded and thin-spaced composition is preferred by the disciples of > William Morris, but it is not liked by the average reader, who does need a > perceptible white blank between words or lines of print. During the > fifteenth century, when thin leads and graduated spaces were almost unknown > and but little used, the reading world had its surfeit of close-spaced and > solid typesetting. (p. 105) Varying the spacing between sentences, and using the changing spacing to encode information, are a standard method of steganography, hiding secret information in public documents..

The trio had boasted about having killed five people in a two-state murder spree. The murderous trio kidnapped four children: Lorraine, Trevor, Tonia, and Robert Lasserre, but Lorraine and Robert were left by the side of the road unharmed. At the end of a siege where Trevor and Tonia were held hostage, they were released unharmed. While on the run for five days, the trio murdered five people after kidnapping the children. During the 26-hour siege, numerous shots were fired by the trio at NSW Police Tactical Operations Unit officers. Leabeater shot and killed himself the following day, while Steele and Bassett surrendered to police. Steele was later sentenced to five consecutive life sentences plus 25 years without parole; he hanged himself in his cell in Goulburn Jail on 23 December 1994. Bassett was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for being an accessory to the NSW murders, and consecutive sentences of life imprisonment for the Queensland murders, with the Queensland sentencing judge ordering him to serve a total non-parole period of 34 years. The siege is also infamous for the actions of news reporters Mike Willesee, who was heavily criticised for telephoning the gunman and speaking with the children being held hostage whilst live on air and Mike Munro, who with his news crew landed a helicopter near the homestead.

The teleost and mammalian leptins appear to have similar functions, namely, regulation of energy intake and expenditure. The leptin (LEP) hormone was long thought to be specific to mammals, but in recent years the gene (lep) has been found in amphibia such as the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), and the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevi). The discovery of lep in puffer fish (Takifugu rubripes) demonstrates the ancient ancestry of this hormone.  Examples  Figure 1. Phylogenetic tree of vertebrate leptins There are two closely related lep paralogues in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). A single lep gene has been documented for green-spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). In other species there are reports of two closely related lep paralogues, including common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Atlantic salmon. More distantly related lep genes have been found in medaka (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). At least 2 leptin genes (lepa and lepb) exist in the crown- clade (Fig. 1). Early findings have shown that lepa and lepb share low interspecies aa identity, and are argued to have arisen through whole genome duplication, which occurred early in the teleost lineage. The duplicity of genes has been described for Atlantic salmon, Japanese medaka, common carp and zebrafish. Both lep paralogues cluster with lepa, and therefore suggest that at least one or more form (lepb) may exist in this species, since it is tetraploid. However, previous attempts using genomic synteny have only found the putative genomic duplicates in medaka and zebrafish paralogue. Currently it remains unclear, whether lepb exists in other teleosts due to the degenerative nature of this paralogue.  Comparison with mammalian leptin  The large differences among endothermic (warm-blooded) mammalian and ectothermic (cold-blooded) teleost leptins raised the question of whether the energy homeostatic functions of the teleost leptins are conserved. Initial phylogenetic analysis has revealed that amino acid conservation with other vertebrate Lep orthologues is low, with only 13.2% sequence identity between torafugu and human LEP. Subsequent investigations have confirmed the low amino acid identity of teleost leps compared to mammalian LEP.  Structure  The three-dimensional homology modeling predicts strong conservation of the tertiary structure between Atlantic salmon and other teleost Leps compared to their mammalian orthologues (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Homology models (created using the SwissProt ProModII homology modeling server) of Atlantic salmon leptins (lepa1, lepa2) compared to the crystallographic structure () of human leptin (LEP). The human leptin structure shows the four anti-parallel Œ±-helices (1, 2, 4, 5) with corresponding domains in the Atlantic salmon proteins. The C-terminal cysteine is depicted as ball and stick diagram. Both lepa1 and lepa2 have two characteristic cysteine residues which predict the formation of a disulfide bond in Lep, which is a pre-equisite for this 3D configuration and bioactivity of human LEP. The models suggest that the bonding of lepa2 might be different from lepa1. There are several differences between the 3D structures of lepa1 and lepa2; e.g. Œ±-helix 5 is considerable shorter in lepa1 than lepa2. Furthermore, Œ±-helix 1 for lepa2 appears to be split by a short- disordered region, and may therefore have a poorer affinity. However, considering that it is a predicted model based upon the structure mask of human LEP, the significance of these putative conformational adjustments remains to be tested. The importance of the conserved tertiary structure of Lep is most likely explained by requirements for specific LepR-binding affinity and is constrained by the structure of the receptor-binding pocket. This might also explain some of the results from studies on teleost using heterologous mammalian Lep. E.g. treatment with the mammalian hormone caused an anorexic effect in goldfish (Carassius auratus) and green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus), but not in Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and green sunfish. These contradicting results have been explained by the relatively large differences in amino acid sequences observed between mammals and fish. R√∏nnestad and colleagues recently detected five isoforms of the leptin receptor (lepr) that have differences in 3'-end of the mRNA sequence. Of these, only the longest form conserved all functionally important domains (such as three fibronectin type III domains, the Ig C2-like domain, a pair of WSXWS motifs, two JAK2-binding motif boxes, and a STAT- binding domain), while the other four forms have only the intra-cellular region. The long form of mammalian LepR has a function for full signal transduction through the JAK/STAT pathways, whereas the shorter forms exhibit partial or no signaling capabilities. The biological importance of long form LepR via the JAK/STAT pathway in maintaining body weight and energy homeostasis has been demonstrated. Previous studies in teleosts have only identified a single lepr. R√∏nnestad et al., is the first to report that plural LepR transcripts in any ectotherm species. When looking at the available motif for lepr, the model suggests that it would bind easily to lepa1 and not lepa2 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the relatively ubiquitous expression of lepr in salmon tissues supports diverse roles of lep in teleosts.  Tissue distribution  Fig. 3. Summary of the tissue distribution of the distantly related lep genes and more closely related lep paralogues in teleost. The study on torafugu indicated that lep is mainly expressed in the liver in contrasts to the adipose secretion in mammals. However recent studies have shown that lep is expressed in several peripheral tissues, including intestine, kidney, ovary, muscle and adipose tissue. The multiplicity of lep genes and their low conservation in Teleostei. suggest that their physiological roles may be more divergent than reported for mammals. The tissue expression pattern for the Atlantic salmon lep paralogues differs substantially (Fig.3) and hence indicates a possible difference in function. With the exception of the results presented here, and those for zebrafish and Japanese medaka. Few studies have investigated the broad tissue distribution of lep in teleost fishes. The more distantly related lep genes (lepa and lepb) showed distinct differences in tissue distribution, as shown in e.g. medaka, where lepa is being expressed in liver and muscle, while lepb is more highly expressed in the brain and eye. However, these differences are also observed for more closely related lep paralogues, such as lepa1 in Atlantic salmon, being more highly expressed in brain, liver and white muscle, while lepa2 is mainly expressed in the stomach and midgut. (Fig. 3).  Effects of nutritional status  The observations that long-term feed restriction does not significantly affect lep expression in Atlantic salmon has also been noted in other teleosts. However it is likely that prolonged feed restriction can influence several endocrine parameters to adapt to the nutritional condition. For example, in common carp, a rapid response in ob gene expression in hepatic tissue of common carp shortly after feeding, but no changes in expression in response to different long-term feeding regime was observed. These authors suggested that this effect could be explained by the fact that starved fish do not lose weight as rapidly as mammals, a consequence of being ectothermic and possessing a much lower standard metabolic rate, and therefore can withstand longer periods of starvation. A similar study on grass carp showed that chronic injection of species-specific Lep did not affect long-term food intake and body weight, while acute injection decreased food intake. Conversely, Murashita et al., (unpublished results) observed increased proopiomelanocortin a1(pomca1) levels following chronic injection of Lep in Atlantic salmon, which suggests that chronic exposure to elevated Lep levels can decrease food intake through the Pomc pathway in this species. Recent studies in Atlantic salmon did not observe any difference of feed restriction in circulating plasma levels, which contrasts recent results in rainbow trout and suggest that the relation between circulating lep levels and energy status differs from that in mammals. However, salmon RIA appears to allow interspecies assessment of plasma lep levels. This only confirms that more comprehensive studies are needed for conclusive data interpretation. Studies on rainbow trout also implicated Lep as an anorectic hormone as in mammals. Injection of rainbow trout with recombinant trout leptin (rt-leptin) resulted in a significantly reduced appetite over two days that coincided with a decrease in hypothalamic mRNA expression of neuropeptide Y (npy) and increase of pomc mRNAs, respectively. Whether these observations are due to species-specific differences in long- term leptin regulation of appetite or growth is not known, however, consensus data indicate that the effects of Lep on appetite regulation may be short-term in teleosts.  Short-term feed restriction  Recent studies on short-term effects of a meal or the absence of a meal has revealed that lepa1 expression specifically peaks in the peripheral tissues after 6 ‚Äì 9 hr in the unfed fish. This suggests that the transcript specific response could be associated with the absence of food. Conversely, since the unfed fish had not received food for 33 hr (24 + 9 hr), the peaks could represent an unrelated effect. Each lepa1 peak occurred during a phase of falling plasma Lep, and since this occurred in both fed and unfed fish, the temporal upregulation of lepa1 does not in fact appear to be specifically related to the absence of food. The earliest peak of lepa1 occurred in the white muscle, which represents an important lipid reservoir in Atlantic salmon. Unlike pufferfish, which utilizes the liver as a major lipid repository, Atlantic salmon shows that despite a high visceral lipid content, hepatocytes contain few lipid droplets compared to other fish species, yet are an important site for leptin expression. Moen and colleagues reported that both lepa1 and lepa2 peaked at 9 hr in the liver of unfed fish. By contrast, however, studies in common carp demonstrated a peak in leptin-I(lepa1) and leptin‚ÄìII (lepa2) in liver at 3 and 6 hr post feeding respectively. The earlier expression response of leptins in common carp likely reflects the higher temperature under which the experiments were conducted, but contrasts the findings of upregulation of lepa1 due to the absence of food. Similarly, in mice, a postprandial increase in hepatic leptin expression has also been reported. However, in grass carp, intraperitoneal injection of recombinant leptin only alters the appetite on the first day, and does not influence food intake during the ensuing 12 days. At present, the data for Atlantic salmon are therefore quite different and suggest that leptin expression in this species may have a complex lipostatic function.

On both occasions, a sit-in protest by inmates escalated into a prison riot. Each riot was followed by violent reprisals from prison officers, the so-called Bathurst Batterings. The second outbreak of violence at Bathurst led to the partial destruction and temporary closure of the prison, and ultimately to a Royal Commission into the entire State prison system.  Background  Long before the 1970 riot, Bathurst had acquired a reputation within the NSW state prison system for violent disturbances. Of the 25 major incidents that had occurred in NSW prisons between 1889 and 1975, 15 had taken place at Bathurst. The main section of the prison, where both riots took place, was completed in 1888. There was no glass in the cells' external windows, leading to freezing overnight temperatures in winter. The archaic plumbing system struggled to cope: toilets overflowed, pipes froze, and there was seldom enough hot water even for thrice-weekly showers. As the then Commissioner the Department of Corrective Services, Walter McGeechan, later conceded, Bathurst was \\"by its design the antithesis of what was required in a modern institution.\\" But the problems were not just architectural. Led by Superintendent John Winter Pallot, senior officers imposed an extremely strict regimen on the inmate population. Officers rarely talked with prisoners or addressed complaints, for fear of being accused of being \\"involved\\" with inmates. Examples of this rigidity included a uniform style of haircut for inmates, a ban on sitting down in the yard, and a requirement that inmates wear jackets during muster (roll call), even in summer. Enforcement of rules was inconsistent and arbitrary. Inmates also complained of rancid food, limits on the number of incoming letters they could keep, and the odours and flies from the prison's piggery.  1970 riot  The Royal Commission later found that the cancellation of mid-week sport in September 1970 may have brought discontent over conditions to a head.  16 October  Around 150 prisoners staged a peaceful \\"sit-in\\" protest in the yards at 4pm on Friday 16 October. The leaders of the protest submitted a list of 17 demands to Deputy Superintendent John Medway. Though Medway characterised the demands as \\"silly\\", McGeechan immediately granted five: no reprisals against protesters, permission to sit in the yards during exercise time, extended time with the radio and lights on in the evenings, and permission for \\"modern\\" styles of haircuts. A representative of the protestors was allowed to telephone a senior officer at the head office in Sydney, probably Assistant Commissioner Noel Day. The inmates formed the belief that the Commissioner would travel to Bathurst on the Monday to hear their grievances directly, and voted to return to their cells at 1am. Tensions continued to rise over the weekend, and McGeechan formed the view that an \\"insurrection\\" was being planned for Monday 19 October. He ordered five armed officers from the Establishments (i.e., security) Division to Bathurst on Sunday night; they were in position in the chapel at the centre of the complex on Monday morning.  19 October  As prisoners filed out of the cell blocks in the morning, they could see armed men in the chapel. Many recognised at once that the administration had no intention of discussing their grievances or improving conditions. The mood among the inmates deteriorated further. While the exact trigger is not known, at the midday muster a group of younger inmates began to riot. This group rushed into C Wing and barricaded themselves inside. They began to destroy fittings, furniture and records. At around 1pm a guard in a tower fired a shot at an inmate climbing over an internal fence. This triggered a broader riot. Inmates from outside C Wing surged into the central yard (known as the Circle), smashing doors and locks and entering the prison kitchen. Officers withdrew to a safe distance as the destruction unfolded. William Morrow, the Director of Establishments and the most senior officer present, began negotiations with the inmates and the violence began to abate. At around 2pm, the inmates barricaded inside C Wing came out into the yard and mixed with the other prisoners. Morrow promised that there would be no physical reprisals (\\"biff\\", in prison slang) against rioters and, to safeguard against this, agreed to a demand that prisoners would be allowed to associate in their cells that evening. The inmates were counted and fed without incident, but already resentment was building among the prison officers. They were angry that they had not been allowed to physically suppress the riot and now demanded that they be allowed to conduct reprisals. At 6pm the officers met with Morrow, and one asked \\"How about we give them a touch of the liquorice stick [rubber baton] in the morning?\\" Morrow was reportedly non-committal, saying something to the effect of \\"we'll work that out later on\\". Morrow reported the desire of some officers to attack the prisoners in the morning to the Commissioner. McGeechan then made the extraordinary decision to recall Morrow ‚Äì the most experienced correctional officer on site at the time ‚Äì to Sydney. Morrow departed Bathurst at 8pm, leaving Pallot in command.  20 October  On the morning of Tuesday 20 October, the officers needed to return prisoners to their normal cells and ensure that all weapons seized or manufactured by inmates during the riot or overnight were confiscated. Despite the dangerous situation, Pallot did not consult the more experienced Establishments officers or head office on the best course of action. He issued his men with batons and told them to strike any prisoner who refused to come out of his cell. This was in direct violation of prison rules, which tightly circumscribed the use of force against inmates. At 7.15am, Pallot led a group of officers to the first cell on the top floor of C Wing, where six inmates had spent the night. The first inmate to emerge, Michael Bowen, did so peacefully. Pallot said to Bowen, \\"You were pretty tough yesterday. Let's see how tough you are today. Cop this!\\" and struck him in the face with his hand. According to the prison officers' union, the Public Service Association of New South Wales (PSA), Pallot's example set the tone for the events that followed: > Some prison officers participated in a systematic flogging of a large > number, if not all, of the prisoners in the gaol. Such flogging was carried > out under the leadership and control of the Superintendent, Mr Pallot, and > was regarded as representing official policy.  Investigations  Warwick Cornwell was the first of the inmates involved to be released; he described his experiences to a Sydney radio station. The next inmate to make allegations was Keith Clark, who was released a month after the violence. He provided a statutory declaration to an Opposition MP, George Petersen. Petersen in turn provided this to Justice Minister John Maddison, and ‚Äì with the names of officers redacted ‚Äì the press. Clark not only detailed his own assault, but that of others. Among these was Pallot's initial assault of Bowen. The next report regarding the reprisal violence came from four of the Department's psychologists, led by Len Evers, who wrote to the Commissioner saying that they had received information from multiple sources that \\"a systematic and calculated brutality has been perpetrated against prisoners by some officers\\". Maddison directed the Department to investigate. This internal investigation, which lasted almost two years, was initially led by a legal officer named Eris Quin. Quin's methods were later to be criticised by the Royal Commission. All interviews ‚Äì with both inmates and staff ‚Äì were conducted in the presence of senior prison officers. Inmates were aware of the Department's practice, common at that time, of charging any inmate who made a complaint with making a false statement. Staff were threatened with disciplinary action or worse. According to one Bathurst officer, before his interview with Quin he was warned by a senior colleague: > Be careful what you say. Be careful you don't get some bugger's throat cut, > especially your own. Quin's conclusions exonerated the Department and its officers. In 1971, McGeechan wrote to Maddison to provide a progress report on the investigation. This report was, as the Commissioner was later forced to concede, wholly misleading, including its torturous conclusions that there was no \\"uniformity of story\\" and that, although Quin had discovered \\"isolated\\" assaults by officers, \\"This is in no way incriminatory\\" because of the prevailing \\"combat conditions\\". In a bid to discredit the complainants, McGeechan provided the Minister with summaries of each inmate's criminal or psychiatric histories. Nagle concluded that \\"Mr McGeechan had attempted, successfully, to deceive the Minister about the true situation which had obtained in Bathurst.\\" Further allegations emerged in early 1971. Petersen produced a statutory declaration from inmate Thomas Smedley; Evers related the account of inmate Alan Morrison. Again, Quin interviewed witnesses in the presence of senior correctional officers. Yet the weight of evidence had begun to accumulate. Quin now concluded that \\"a prima facie case exists against Prison Officers generally at Bathurst Gaol.\\" McGeechan removed him from any further work on the internal inquiries; Quin's conclusion was never communicated to the Minister. Indeed, it only came to light after photostat copies of Quin's papers was anonymously supplied to lawyers appearing before the Royal Commission several years later.  Subsequent media coverage  In June 1971, an anonymous document was published with the title \\"Bathurst Batterings ‚Äì October 1970. The case for a Royal Commission into the Department of Corrective Services of New South Wales.\\" It included the statutory declarations, the psychologists' letter, and the statements from inmates made to the Quin, as well as other material. The document began: > The record of events given here, if true, suggests that the administration > of the Department of Corrective Services of New South Wales is founded on > parsimony, incompetence, treachery, violence, intimidation and deceit. The document generated considerable media interest and encouraged still more inmates to come forward. Quin's replacement as investigator, Boyd Cleary, reported that he believed elements of a complaint from inmate L.W. Boyle. The following month, Evers went public, speaking to The Sunday Australian. The Australian later discovered that an inmate had reported the reprisals to the local Bishop, Albert Thomas. When the inmate's letter was discovered, the Department was more interested in punishing him than investigating the allegations.  1974 riot  Pallot remained as superintendent and little changed at Bathurst in the years following the violence of 1970. Poor plumbing, inedible food, cancelled sport and unreasonable rules continued to rankle inmates. Further sit-ins occurred on 29 October 1973 and 15 January 1974. Each time the administration promised protesting inmates would not be punished; and each time at least some of them were.  The inmates riot  On the afternoon of 3 February 1974, up to 90 inmates were gathered in the chapel to watch the film Women in Love. As the second reel began, an unidentified prisoner threw a petrol bomb. After a brief period of confusion the people present were evacuated and the fire extinguished. Officers escorted one inmate, Billy Kennedy, back to his cell. Kennedy was later accused of throwing the petrol bomb, or may have thrown a chair at an officer. The other inmates heard screams coming from Kennedy's cell. It is not clear whether Kennedy was bashed or was simply attempting to stir up the other prisoners. What is clear is that his cries touched off a full-scale riot. Another petrol bomb was thrown and inmates stormed the Circle, the yard in the centre of the prison. The officers retreated and the inmates began destroying the prison, smashing locks and furniture, and setting fires in several buildings. Two cellblocks, including C Wing, workshops and the chapel were set alight. At around 3pm the chapel's bell tower collapsed and the refrigeration unit in the basement exploded. By this time the fire brigade had arrived, but firefighters withdrew after inmates threw petrol bombs at them. As the afternoon wore on, the riot gradually petered out. The inmates congregated in B Wing and its adjacent yards, preparing themselves for a long siege.  The officers fire on the inmates  Pallot put out a call on a local radio station for off-duty prison officers to return to the gaol. He also made the decision to issue firearms to his men. When the supply of weapons ran low, more were brought in from a local sporting goods store. The officers were hurriedly trained in the use of the guns, which included rifles, shotguns and revolvers. At 3.30pm officers began firing from No. 4 tower, which was closest to B Wing. There had been no order to do so: McGeechan forbade it, but Pallot chose not to pass this instruction on. Up to 20 inmates were injured by gunfire. One, Dennis Bugg, was paralysed when a .22 calibre bullet passed through his spine. Another, Connors, was shot through the lung, liver and stomach. Although the shootings were unauthorised and reckless, they may have encouraged many of the inmates to surrender. Prisoners Von Falkenhausen and Harrison carried Bugg out under a white flag, but were fired upon by officers. By 4pm, around 80 inmates remained at large.  The inmates surrender  Around 6pm the remaining prisoners began negotiations for surrender. Wally Bishop, one of the prisoners' representatives, was shot in the back while walking towards the officers with a white flag. Mutton, the Chief Prison Officer, negotiated with Bishop and another inmate, Carson. It was agreed there would be no further shooting and no reprisals. The inmates surrendered and were marched to the Back Special Yards, a row of seven small exercise areas used for segregating prisoners. The prison had been substantially destroyed by fire and preparations were made to evacuate all inmates to Sydney. McGeechan was anxious to avoid violent reprisals by his officers. Bathurst officers were quoted as demanding revenge ‚Äì the destruction of the prison also destroyed their livelihood. Yet the Commissioner decided to allow the evacuation to proceed without oversight from senior officials or external observers. The most senior officer present at Bathurst, Assistant Commissioner Barrie Barrier, was told by McGeechan to wait by the telephone, which was on the opposite side of the prison to the Back Special Yards.  The officers evacuate the Back Special Yards  Around 11.30pm, the officers ordered the inmates ‚Äì of whom there were now 60 to 70 ‚Äì to leave the Back Special Yards. One of the inmates said they would not do so until they had spoken to someone from the Department's head office. When this request was rejected, the inmates began to dig through the brick walls that separated the special yards. Around the same time, the vehicles arrived ready to transport the remaining inmates to Sydney. In the early hours of 4 February, about 150 officers, many equipped with riot gear, took up positions on all sides of the Back Special Yards. Up to five tear gas canisters were thrown into the yards, after which the gates to the yards were kept locked for around 10 minutes. The first to be released from the yards was Carson, who had negotiated on behalf of the inmates the previous afternoon. He was beaten with batons and escorted to a waiting van. The officers proceeded to unlock the remaining yards, but there was a lack of clear direction about what they were meant to do. One officer recalled: > The tension was electric. Suddenly a roar went up from the prison officers > and prisoners were going in every direction. Fists were flying, bricks were > thrown, batons were being used, and the picture was one of struggling, > grappling and wrestling prisoners and prison officers. In order to reach the waiting vehicles, the inmates had to be moved along a passageway at the side of the complex known as 17 Post. It was here that, inmates alleged, the officers formed a kind of gauntlet. The Royal Commission found that the term \\"gauntlet\\" was misapplied, but that many inmates were nonetheless beaten as they ran through 17 Post to the buses. Inmates who had surrendered earlier in the riot had been placed in the Front Special Yards on the other side of the complex and had remained there overnight. The following morning, they were taken to waiting buses, and some were beaten at this time. Further beatings occurred when they arrived at Malabar Prison in Sydney.  Aftermath  Bathurst Gaol had sustained around $10 million worth of damage and remained closed for several years after the 1974 riots.  Royal Commission  Following the second Bathurst riot, the Liberal Premier, Sir Robert Askin, promised an inquiry ‚Äì but this was deferred pending the outcome of criminal charges against the rioters. On 31 March 1976, Askin's successor, Eric Willis established the inquiry in the form of a royal commission, with Supreme Court justice John Flood Nagle presiding. Former Macquarie University vice-chancellor Alexander Mitchell and University of New South Wales academic Sydney Derwent were appointed as members of the Commission, with Cambridge criminologist Sir Leon Radzinowicz serving as a consultant. The Labor government elected later that year removed Mitchell, Derwent and Radzinowicz on the grounds of cost, leaving the commission in Nagle's hands alone. Although it characterised Pallot's example as \\"reprehensible\\", the Commission did not accept the union's excuse for its members' criminality, not least because the savage beatings meted out by officers went far beyond Pallot's assault on Bowen. More importantly, the Commission reminded the union that a criminal act is not excused because of a civil or military order. \\"The defence did not succeed in the Nuremberg Trials;\\" Nagle wrote, \\"it does not succeed here.\\" Despite this, Nagle shied away from recommending that the officers face any legal or professional consequences, concluding that he saw \\"no purpose at this late stage of recommending criminal prosecutions.\\" The only officers to be the subject of Royal Commission recommendations were McGeechan himself and a Goulburn officer accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour.  In popular culture  One of the inmates present at the riots, Bob Jewson, went on to write a screenplay about his experiences. This was made into the film Stir, released in 1980. In the same year, rock group Cold Chisel included a song about the riot, entitled Four Walls, on its album East.

His father Alexander Semionovich Russov came from peasants of the Nizhny Novgorod Governorate, his mother Iraida Semionovna Nemtsova was from Kostroma. In 1939, passion for drawing leads Russov to the art studio of the Vyborgsky district of Leningrad, where he is engaged up to the outbreak of war. In December 1941, along with his mother he was evacuated from the siege of Leningrad in the Gorky Province. Soon he had an accident that could change the fate of the future artist. Under circumstances not completely clear, Rusov lost his right eye. According to the artist's son, this happened from a careless jab of whip. However already 1943, he moved to Kostroma city, where goes to the regional art school. Tavricheskaya Art School Building on Tavricheskaya st, 35 In 1945, in connection with the return to Leningrad Russov was transferred to Tavricheskaya Art School (now known as an Art College named after Nicholas Roerich), from which he graduated in 1947.Sergei V.

Leningrad Union of Artists Building on Bolshaya Morskaya st, 38 In 1955, Russov was admitted to the Leningrad Union of Soviet artists on the recommendations of the famous painters Piotr Buchkin, Yuri Neprintsev and Veniamin Kremer. In addition to portraits, Russov during these years painted genre compositions, still lifes, landscapes, worked in the technique of oil painting, watercolors and woodcuts. The year 1955 was marked for Russov by meetings with people who changed his personal and creative destiny. He meets Ekaterina Vasilievna Balebina (born December 29, 1933, the daughter of Vasily Balebin, the famous torpedo bomber, Hero of the Soviet Union), who will soon become his wife, the mother of his son Andrei and the main muse. Charming and lively, full of self-sacrifice, she will serve for Russov as a model for many paintings and portraits, create and protect the world in which the artist's creative gift will unfold and sparkle in full strong. In the same year, Lev Russov met with Yevgeny Mravinsky, their relationship grew into a long-years friendship, to which we owe several portraits of the outstanding conductor, created during 1950-1980s. In 1960‚Äì1980 Russov creative life was divided between the Leningrad art studio, the home in Fonarny Lane and the village of Pavshino on the Oredezh River, where on the high bank of the river he built a cottage with a workshop and worked many months each year. Lev Alexsandrovich Russov died on February 20, 1987 in Leningrad in the sixty-second year of his life from heart disease. His works reside in museums and private collections in Russia, USA, Norway, Great Britain, Sweden, France and other countries. The widow of the artist Ekaterina Vasilievna Russov outlived her husband by 15 years and died on June 20, 2002 in St. Petersburg at the sixty-ninth year of life. In 1970, at the Leningrad Physical-Technical Institute named after A.F. Ioffe, Academy of Sciences of the USSR, it consisted of the only lifetime exhibition of Russov's works  Creativity  The creative life of Lev Russov, unusual and contradictory, contained two periods of unequal length and significance, one of which was devoted to painting, and the other mainly to wooden sculpture.  Portrait  According to the researchers of the artist's creativity, with the full strength Russov's pictorial talent was revealed in a series of portraits of his contemporaries painted in the 1950s and the first half of the 1960s, which brought fame and recognition to the author. For ten years, Russov created a gallery of portraits that enriched the various types of modern portraiture. The beginning of it was laid on female images, among which portraits of the wife and young women from the circle of common friends stand out. Among them were Portrait of Catherine BalebinaSergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School. St Petersburg, NP-Print, 2007. P.65.[The Leningrad School of Painting. Essays on the History. St Petersburg, ARKA Gallery Publishing, 2019.

(1956), Portrait of Young Woman in Red (1956), Portrait of Young Woman (1957), and others. The known art works that continued them in the late 1950s and early 1960s ‚Äì Portrait of wife (1959), Fresh Model (1961), Kira, Narine, Portrait of Maria Korsukova (all 1962), is distinguished by great decorativeness, generalization of the drawing and the sharpness of the composition, which Russov used in searching for means of enhancing the expressiveness of the image. Characterizing the work of Russov, art historians Anatoli Dmitrenko and Ruslan Bakhtiyarov note: Portrait of Catherine Balebina. 1956 Trips in the mid-1950s to Oredezh, first to Nakol village, and then to Pavshino, marked the beginning of a remarkable series of portraits of children and young people. Among them Zoya (1957), twin portrait of sisters Kira and Zoya (1958), Natasha (1958), Natasha, Little Bows (–æ–±–µ 1960). In the 1960s, this series of works was supplemented by portraits of the son Andrei with the Horse (1963), Portrait of the Son (1965) and others. The portraits of this period fall at the time of the highest creative upsurge of Russov as the painter, and constitute the most valuable part of his diverse artistic heritage. They are distinguished by an extraordinary expressiveness of images, courage of compositional decisions, unmistakable artistic taste. The color scheme is dominated by pearl and purple tones. The manner of the artist is distinguished by a powerful pictorial language, wide writing, sharp composition, interest in unexpected rakurs. Rusov possessed a rare ability to capture the fleeting states of model, to quickly embody a pictorial idea on canvas ‚Äì immediately and unusually convincingly. The images he created combine the expressiveness of individual characteristics with a vivid embodiment of the typical features of contemporaries. In the work on the portrait, Rusov manages to grab the fleeting state of model, which, with prolonged posing, eludes most artists. He knows how to keep this first impression to the end and convey to the viewer. Therefore, in his works, nature is alive, and this feeling of a lively look of living people is almost the most exciting in the artist's portraits.–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –°. –í. –ó–∞–≥–∞–¥–∫–∏ —Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∏—Ö –ø–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–æ–≤ –õ—å–≤–∞ –†—É—Å–æ–≤–∞. Along with the expressiveness of the form, the portraits of Russov are distinguished by the depth and psychologism of the images, careful selection and study of model. Its another important reason for the success of his works. Some of his best works of this period Russov painted in the village of Pavshino on the Oredezh River near Leningrad, where in the late 1950s a group of young artists settled: G. Bagrov, E. Shram, K. Slavin and N. Slavina, L. Kuzov, A. Yakovlev, G. Antonov. Here on the Oredezh river, first in the village of Nakol, then in Pavshino Rusov finds the heroines of her new portraits: Aunt Polya, the sisters Zoya and Kira, the village girl Natasha Savelyeva. It was her portrait, painted by Rusov in 1958, for the first time that was truly noticed and appreciated by critics. In critical reviews of the Fall Art Exhibition of 1958, Leningrad newspapers gave this portrait a prominent place. E.

Mravinsky  Russov's acquaintance with Yevgeny Mravinsky in 1955 quickly grew into a friendship that lasted until the end of the artist's life. For thirty years, Rusov painted several portraits of the outstanding conductor, the most famous of which is A Portrait of E. A. Mravinsky of 1957. Portrait of Yevgeny Mravinsky. 1957 The portrait was painted by Rusov for two years and was completed in 1957.

Unlike most famous portraits, Mravinsky is depicted in a home environment, when a person belongs only to himself and reveals himself in his true guise. From the Memoirs of Alexander Mikhailovna Vavilina-Mravinsky, the widow of Yevgeny Mravinsky: In the 1970s, Russov turned to the theme of two great contemporaries ‚Äì Dmitry Shostakovich and Yevgeny Mravinsky, she found its embodiment in the picture The Leningrad Symphony. Conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky (1980). Russov worked for a long time on the concept and composition of the picture, rejecting one option after another. It is difficult to judge the extent to which its final version satisfied the artist. It can be assumed that, if he had the strength and time, this work could continue. From the Memoirs of Alexander Mikhailovna Vavilina-Mravinsky, the widow of Yevgeny Mravinsky:  Thyl Ulenspiegel  In the years 1954‚Äì1956 Lev Russov was drawn to the historical genre, creating a series of eight paintings on the novel by Charles de Coster's The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel. Choosing a theme and its figurative embodiment echoed the mood of the Khrushchev \\"Thaw and personal freedom-loving aspirations of the author.

Plate 195. are also interesting in that the artist gave Thill features a close resemblance to the author. This makes it unique in the creative legacy of the artist as self-portraits of Lev Russov are unknown. As a child he lost one eye and did not like to be photographed and a general refusal to pose for portraits, painted by himself or others. In the future, Russov's interest in historical topics was expressed in numerous works of wooden sculpture, as well as in a some paintings, in particular in the painting Strolling Buffoons (1976).  Still-Life  Still-Life with Seneca. 1963 Still-life in the works of Russov is closely connected with the colorful and compositional tasks that the artist set for himself in the work on the portrait. Hence the sharpness and freshness of compositional solutions, the internal dramatic and tension in his works of this genre. It is no coincidence that, in terms of expressiveness and depth of images, the best works by Russov in the still life genre are not inferior to his well-known portraits. This sets them apart from others paintings created in this genre in 1950‚Äì1970. Most of his still lifes convey not only the interior of the artist's workshop and the object world surrounding him, but also the atmosphere, the flour of creativity in which the creator's ideas are born and implemented. Moreover, their art form, despite the apparent ease of execution, is thought out and brought to perfection by the author. Among Russov's works in this genre, sources distinguish Still-Life with Seneca–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –°. –ù–µ–∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π —Å–æ—Ü—Ä–µ–∞–ª–∏–∑–º. –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∞—è —à–∫–æ–ª–∞. –°–ü–±, –ù–ü-–ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ç, 2007. –°.22.

The works of the 1950-1960s moved Lev Russov into the leading masters of portraiture. However, for the general public and even for many colleagues in the Leningrad Union of Artists, he remained virtually unknown. The explanation for this must be sought primarily in the character traits of the artist. A man of independent views, talented, direct, sometimes ruthless in assessments and judgments, astonishing those who knew him closely with his monstrous capacity for work, he eschewed the public life of the Union of Artists, was intolerant of any manifestations of mediocrity and imitation of creativity. In fact, during the Brezhnev years of stagnation and developed socialism he remained a man of the Khrushchev's thaw. In 1970‚Äì1980 Russov rarely showed his work at art exhibitions. His life was divided between a city workshop, a house in Pavshino on Oredezh and communication with a narrow circle of old friends. In fairness, we must admit that the existing system did not reject such artists, allowing them to have almost free materials and a workshop for creative work in exchange for minimal loyalty. In mid-1960s Lev Russov enjoys wooden sculpture and Russian folk epic. From now until the end of life it becomes the main theme of his work, surpassing the painting. From his hands came out a lot of superb sculptures, from small figurines to large forms, such as Russian Icarus and the relief on the epic theme of Zastava, Folk singers.

The film, which has music scored by noted musician Jeet Ganguly and cinematography handled by Kumud Verma, released on April 2010. The film is officially a remake of the 2003 blockbuster superhit Kaadhal Kondein starring Dhanush and Sonia Agarwal. This film was already remade in Bangladesh as Onno Manush in 2004. The story explores the mind of a youth who is mentally and physically abused in his childhood. The lack of a mother's love haunts the protagonist throughout the film as the girl of his infatuation parts him in her death. Turning into a psychopath, he desperately tries to woo his newly found lady love and his efforts culminate in a superb nail-biting cliffhanger. Plot Vinod (Soham Chakraborty), who orphaned at an early age, has grown up under the care of a church father, Father Rozario (Nagesh), in North Bengal, is an introvert but a genius. He is forcibly sent to college by Father Rozario but is a complete misfit in class. One day he solves a complex mathematics problem in class surprising his classmates. Though shunned and avoided by the rest of his class, a beautiful and educated young girl, Ria (Srabanti Chatterjee) becomes his friend and he gradually warms up to her too. Impressed by Ria's heavenly beauty and charm, he feelings soon turn into love but he realizes that Ria considers him as only a friend. But he is unwilling to let her go. Meanwhile, Vinod learns that Ria is in love with another classmate, Aditya (Rehaan Roy). Ria's father is angered on learning about her love. He shuts her up and prevents her from contacting anyone. But Vinod comes and meets her on the pretext of getting some old clothes for himself to wear. Pitied by Vinod, her father allows him. But Vinod uses the chance and escapes with Ria. He convinces her that she will meet Aditya. Vinod has set up a secret place for executing his plan of wooing Ria. He makes her stay with him, while convincing her by talking about the never-impending Aditya's arrival. On one such day, he reveals his miserable past, where he is made to work for paid labour after being orphaned at an early age. He revolts against the oppression one day against the illegal child labour in vogue at his place. Promptly he is beaten black and blue for his profanity. Moreover, he also loses his girlfriend to rapists in that place, who also kill her. Somehow he manages to escape from them and seeks refuge in the place of Father Rozario. Ria is really touched by his past. Incidentally the police and Aditya arrive at the place. While Vinod was away to get some food, they try to make Ria understand that Vinod was a psychopath. Yet Ria scoffs at their claims, citing his gentlemanly behaviour over the days she was put up alone with him. Vinod, learning that the police have arrived at the scene, begins to indulge in mass violence. He opens fire, killing a police constable. Forcing them out of their hideout, he manages to evade the police Inspector and Aditya and successfully brings Ria back to their original place of stay. Ria soon identifies the tiger out of the cow's skin. Vinod pleads with her, telling her that all he wanted in his life was her presence with him. But Ria called him a friend and stated her inability to accept him as her partner for life. Meanwhile, Aditya regains consciousness and comes back to attack Vinod and rescue his girlfriend. A violent fight follows, where Vinod defies his puny self and treats Aditya with disdain. The fight culminates with Vinod, Aditya and Ria finding themselves at the edge of a cliff. While Ria clutches a tree bark tightly, Vinod and Aditya slip out and barely manage to hold either of her hands. Ria is forced to a situation where she needs to choose between her boyfriend and friend. Aditya's pleas notwithstanding, Ria doesn't have the heart to kill Vinod. The epic of a cliffhanger finally ends with Vinod smiling wryly at Ria and letting go of her hands himself. He falls dead into the deep valley.

The game is the official video game of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and was released on both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for the PAL region in August 2011. It was released in North America in September 2011, with the PlayStation 3 version available via the PlayStation Store and the Xbox 360 version via Xbox Live Arcade. Details No rugby union game had been produced for four years since Rugby 08, which was also developed by HB Studios, then under the EA Sports label. It was announced on 29 March 2010 that The Rugby Forum and its members, would help HB studios gain a better understanding of what the general rugby-supporting public wanted in the new title. For the first time in the series of rugby games developed by HB Studios, the title has a player editor, but it is limited to attributes and names only. Modes=Tournament Mode This mode, which is the only area of the game in which most of the official stadia appear, is based entirely on the real-life tournament. As such it can be competed in as any of the 20 participating teams, with a schedule of pool matches to match the actual tournament (although users can also choose to have the pools re-drawn randomly, as game developers try to extend the game‚Äôs longevity by providing reason for players to complete the tournament more than once). This is the only mode on the game which allows for full-length matches to be played in the official tournament jerseys. International Test This mode allows for contests between any of the 20 included teams, at any stadium included in the game (except those stadia exclusive to the ‚ÄòTournament Mode‚Äô). Similar to one- off matches in the FIFA series, for example, the match situation is a ‚Äòone-off friendly‚Äô and can be taken to a combination of extra-time and/or a place-kick shootout if the scores are tied after the last play of the match. Warm-up Tour This mode allows users to take a team on a tour of teams in their opposite hemispheres, although to play the stronger sides the user must first complete two tours of weaker nations. For example, to tour to the Tri-Nations teams with a northern hemisphere team, the user must first complete a 'Pacific Islands Tour', encountering Tonga, Samoa and Fiji; and also a 'South Atlantic Tour', encountering Namibia and Argentina. To tour to the Six Nations countries with a southern hemisphere team, the user must again complete two tours: 'North American Tour', meeting United States and Canada; and then 'Eastern Tour', meeting Romania, Russia, Georgia and Japan. Place Kick Shootout This mode allows for the user to contest a place-kick competition between any two included teams of their choosing. The match takes place in ‚ÄòAuckland‚Äô stadium (Eden Park), and is set at night. Teams The game features all twenty international teams competing in the 2011 Rugby World Cup. However, only ten of the teams are officially licensed. Teams such as the All Blacks (New Zealand), and the Wallabies (Australia), are unlicensed due to their exclusive licensing deal with rival video game Rugby Challenge. Trailer The trailer of the game was released in July 2011. Demo A demo was released on 2 August on Xbox Live and 3 August on the PlayStation Network. The playable teams are South Africa and England, and the venue is Auckland. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Daily Telegraph gave the Xbox 360 version a score of three stars out of five and said that its most disappointing aspect \\"is just how threadbare it is in terms of modes.\\" The Guardian similarly gave it three stars out of five and said that \\"there's just too little on offer here to justify the cost for a full-priced, boxed retail release.\\" The Digital Fix gave it a score of four out of ten and said that it \\"stinks of under investment and cheap development shortcuts. It feels like a budget arcade game shoved into a shiny full-priced release and an officially licensed sticker stuck on top.\\" ReferencesExternal links *The Rugby Forum - The Official Online Home of RWC 2011 game discussion Category:2011 video games Category:505 Games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Rugby union video games Category:Video games set in 2011 Category:Video games set in Argentina Category:Video games set in Australia Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in Ireland Category:Video games set in New Zealand Category:Video games set in South Africa Category:Video games set in the United Kingdom Category:2011 Rugby World Cup ","title":"Rugby World Cup 2011 (video game)"},{"id":"26890766","text":"K.Mettupalayamvadivel is a village located in, Gobichettipalayam Taluk of Erode district of India's Tamilnadu state, situated in the way of Erode- Sathyamangalam Main road and its 8 kilometers from Gobichettipalayam.

It is one of the three species of Taenia infecting humans and causes taeniasis. Discovered only in 1980s from Taiwan and other East Asian countries as an unusual species, it is so notoriously similar to Taenia saginata, the beef tapeworm, that it was for a time regarded as a slightly different strain. But anomaly arose as the tapeworm is not of cattle origin, but of pigs. Morphological details also showed significant variations, such as presence of rostellar hooks, shorter body, and fewer body segments. The scientific name designated was then Asian T. saginata. But the taxonomic consensus turns out to be that it is a unique species. It was in 1993 that two Korean parasitologists, Keeseon S. Eom and Han Jong Rim, provided the biological bases for classifying it into a separate species. The use of mitochondrial genome sequence and molecular phylogeny in the late 2000s established the taxonomic status. T. asiatica causes intestinal taenisis in humans and cysticercosis in pigs. There is a suspicion that it may also cause cysticercosis in human. Like other taenids, humans are the definitive hosts, but in contrast, pigs, wild boars, as well as cattle can serve as intermediate hosts. Moreover, SCID mice and Mongolian gerbil can be experimentally infected. The life cycle is basically similar to those of other taenids. Humans contract the infection by eating raw or undercooked meat ‚Äì a practice common in East and Southeast Asia ‚Äì which are contaminated with the infective larva called cysticercus. Cysticercus develops into adult tapeworm in human intestine, from where it releases embryonated eggs along faeces into the external environment. Pigs acquire the eggs from vegetation. The eggs enter the digestive tract, which they penetrate to migrate to other body organs. Unlike other Taenia they preferentially settle in the liver, where they form cysticerci. Asian taeniasis is documented in nine countries in Asia, including Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, south- central China, Vietnam, Japan and Nepal. The rate of a prevalence is estimated to be up to 21% and resulting in annual economic losses of about US$40,000,000 in these regions. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for treating the infection. As the latest addition to human taeniasis, misidentified for over two centuries, still complete lack of systematic diagnosis, and no control programmes, it is regarded as the most neglected human taenid. Discovery T. asiatica was first recognized in Taiwan, and subsequently in Korea and other Asian countries; therefore it was originally known as Asian T. saginata, as it appeared to be exclusive to Asia. From 1952 W. H. Huang and his team had recorded that taeniasis was highly prevalent in Taiwan under the assumption that T. saginata was the principal cause. In 1966 S.W. Huang began to suspect that the tapeworm could not be the conventional T. saginata for the obvious reason that the Taiwan aborigines hardly eat beef, and T. saginata is strictly a bovine tapeworm. From 1970s studies on the biology began to throw light to its difference from the classical T. saginata. Firstly the tapeworm infects visceral organs such as liver, serosa and lungs of pigs, and liver of cattle; while T. saginata is known to infect only the muscle of cattle. Secondly there are significant morphological variations though their resemblance is overwhelming. By the early 1990s the morphological and genetic differences were firmly established, but American and Australian parasitologists remained adamant as to its position as a separate biological species. In 1992 two Korean parasitologists Keeseon S. Eom, from Chungbuk National University, and Han-Jong Rim, from Korea University, reported the transmission and larval stages (metacestodes) in naturally infected pigs. They also succeeded in experimentally infecting pigs in which cysticerci were formed in the liver. Further the metacestodes recovered from infected liver were used to infect a human volunteer, whom they had given two years earlier. They therefore proposed the scientific name Taenia sagainata taiwanensis. They recovered the intact strobilae from the stool after giving the volunteer niclosamide. It was using these metacestodes, strobilae, and adult worms that they gave detailed morphological and anatomical comparisons and concluded it to be a novel species, Taenia asiatica, in 1993. Even then scepticism still persisted. Considering the degree of variations between Taiwan strain and typical T. saginata, Taiwanese parasitologists such as P.C. Fan, C.Y Lin, C.C. Chen and W.C Chung from National Yang-Ming University designated it to a subspecies, and named it T. saginata asiatica. Based on critical assessment on the field reports, experimental infections, morphological and immunological studies available since 1981, they advocated this position. Independent research in Australia also supported the subspecies concept regardless of the genetic variations. But subsequent analyses including epidemiological studies, and phylogenetic analysis using random amplified polymorphic DNA imposed its validity as a distinct species. In 2005 the first complete sequence of its mitochondrial genome was published, and genetic comparison (Cox1gene) with those of Taenia solium and T. saginata provided further support to its taxonomic status. The complete sequence of mitochondrial genome of T. saginata in 2007, and the development of high-resolution multiplex PCR assay in 2009 finally established beyond doubt that it is indeed a new species. The two species separated . Description The body of Taenia asiatica is yellowish- white in colour, about 350 cm long and 1 cm broad, divided into the anterior scolex, followed by a short neck and a highly extended body proper called strobila. It is an acoelomate animal with no body cavity or digestive system. The scolex bears four simple suckers as attachment organs to the intestinal wall of the host. The distinct rostellum on the scolex, the large number of uterine twigs and the existence of posterior protuberance in adult are the defining characters. The rostellum is usually surrounded by two rows of rudimentary hooklets. In comparison, lack of rostellum and hooks is the defining feature of T. saginata. Moreover, the metacestode is different in having wart-like formations on the external surface of the bladder wall, which are absent in T. saginata. The strobila is composed of a chain of ribbon-like segments called proglottids. There are more than 700 proglottids in the strobila, but less than 1000 (~900), while T. saginata in comparison have more than 1000 proglottids. The proglottids are distinguishable into mature and gravid proglottids. Each mature proglottid contains a complete set of both male and female reproductive systems; hence it is hermaphrodite. Similar to T. saginata the uterus has 13 lateral branches in T. asiatica. The gravid proglottids are full of fertilised eggs. The number of eggs in gravid proglottids differs from 44,180 to 132,500, with an average number of 90,051. It is unique in having posterior protuberances in the gravid proglottid, which are absent in other taenids including T. saginata. The cysticerci of T. asiatica are typically smaller than those of other human taenids. They possess two rows of rudimentary hooks, unlike T. saginata, which has none. In addition the protoscolex of cysticercus (metacestode) has a sunken rostellum, while that of T. saginata has only an apical pit. Life cycle The life cycle of T asiatica is indirect and digenetic, and is completed in humans as the definitive host, and the intermediate host is mostly pigs (including wild boar in Taiwan), and possibly cattle on rare occasion. The complete life cycle is shortest among human taenids. Humans ingest the infective larvae called cysticercus from raw or undercooked meat, or viscera of pigs. The adult worm inhabits the small intestine where it gets attached to the mucosa using its suckers and rostellar hooklets. Upon sexual maturity it undergoes self- fertilisation. Fertilized eggs are released through the faeces along with the gravid proglottid which gets detached from the strobila. The number of proglottids released per day may vary from 0 to 35. Cysticercus grows into adult in about 2.5 to 4 months, by the time gravid proglottids are found in faeces. Pigs and wild boars ingest the infective embryo while grazing. The digestive enzymes will break the thick shell of the egg and allow formation of the zygotes called \\"oncospheres\\". These oncospheres then penetrate the mucous layer of the digestive tract and enter the circulation of the host. This is where the young larval stages form a pea-sized, fluid filled cyst, also known as ‚Äúcysticercus‚Äù, which migrate to visceral organs like liver, serosa and lungs in pigs, and liver in cattle. In contrast to T. saginata, the larval development is short, taking about four weeks. Cystecerci have a predilection for liver. Pathogenesis T. asiatica infection in human is usually asymptomatic. There was an isolated report of severe pathogenic lesions in a 60-year-old woman admitted to Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. Using endoscopy she was diagnosed with multiple erosions and active bleeding from ulcers in the stomach and duodenum caused by a single tapeworm. A year later she returned with intermittent epigastric pain, which she reported having had for several months. Again a tapeworm was seen. The tapeworm species was not identified but was suspected to be T. asiatica, because the woman ate pork liver at a festival, and the common pork tapeworm T. solium is mostly found in pig muscle. In pigs cysticercus has a tendency to produce cysticercosis. Cysts are formed in vital organs such as liver and lungs. In contrast T. saginata does not cause cysticercosis. As its life cycle and mode of development are very similar to those of Taenia solium, which is the major cause of neurocysticercosis, a possibility that T. asiatica can cause cysticercosis in humans is highly conjectured. Epidemiology The parasite is known in Asian countries including Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand and China. In addition, molecular genotyping techniques have revealed that the disease also occurs in Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Diagnosis The basic diagnosis is examination of a stool sample to find the parasite eggs. However, there is a serious limitation as to the identification of the species because the eggs of all human taenids look the same. Even with the proglottids it is extremely difficult to identify T. asiatica from other taenids because of their striking resemblances. The species and T. saginata are frequently confused due to their morphological similarities and sympatric distribution. Identification often requires histological observation of the uterine branches and PCR detection of ribosomal 5.8S gene. The presence of rostellum on the scolex, a large number of uretine branches (more than 57) and prominent posterior protuberances in gravid proglottids, and wart-like formation on the surface of the larvae are the distinguishing structures. To date the most relevant diagnosis of taeniasis due to T. asiatica is by enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB). EITB can effectively identify it from other taenid infections since serological test indicates that immunoblot band of 21.5 kDa exhibited specificity only to T. asiatica. Even though it gives 100% sensitivity, it has not been tested with human sera for cross-reactivity, and it may show a high false positive result. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is highly sensitive (~2.5 times that of multiplex PCR), without false positive, for differentiating the taenid species from faecal samples. Treatment Niclosamide (2 mg) is very effective against experimental infection in human. In general cestode infections are treated with praziquantel and albendazole. Atrabine is quite effective but indicates adverse effects in humans. The commonly used drugs for tapeworms, benzimidazoles are relatively ineffective. Praziquantel at a single dose of 150 mg is the most effective medication against T. asiatica without causing side effects.

Written by Azuelos and Delgado Nans, the film is about a teenage girl whose life is split between her studies in a Parisian high school, her secret diary, her parents, her friends, and her boyfriends. Christa Theret received a C√©sar Award nomination for Most Promising Actress in 2010. The movie is heavily inspired by La Boum, which starred Marceau as the teenage character. Plot Lola (Christa Theret) is a teenage girl living with her mother Anne (Sophie Marceau), who is divorced from Lola's father, Alain (Alexandre Astier). Nicknamed 'LOL' by her friends, Lola has been taking her first steps into teenage romance, dating a boy from her class named Arthur (F√©lix Moati). Following the summer break, Arthur tells her that he cheated on her over the summer and was dating one of her friends. Lola decides to break things off with him, and starts seeing his close friend, Ma√´l (Jeremy Kapone). Lola's friends seem to enjoy complicating matters even more. But life at home has also become impossible with her mother, Anne (Sophie Marceau). Lola attempts to play her mother and her father Alain (Alexandre Astier) off against each other for her own advantage, but what she doesn't know is that Anne and Alain have begun dating again on the sly. After a class trip to England, her relationship with her mother comes crashing down.

In Albania, major cities are linked with either new single/dual carriageways or well maintained State Roads marked as \\"SH\\" (Rrug√´ Shtet√´rore). There is a dual carriageway connecting the port city of Durr√´s with Tirana, Vlor√´, and partially Kuk√´s. There are three official Motorway segments in Albania marked with an \\"A\\" (Autostrad√´): Thuman√´‚ÄìMilot‚ÄìRr√´shen‚ÄìKalimash (A1), Levan‚ÄìVlor√´ (A2), and partly Tirane‚ÄìElbasan (A3). Most rural segments continue to remain in bad conditions as their reconstruction has only begun in the late 2000s by the Albanian Development Fund .  Algeria  About 1390 km of highways in Algeria are in service and another 1500 km are under construction. Australia The Tullamarine Freeway showing toll gantries in Melbourne, Australia. In Australia, a highway is a distinct type of road from freeways, expressways, and motorways. The word highway is generally used to mean major roads connecting large cities, towns and different parts of metropolitan areas. Metropolitan highways often have traffic lights at intersections, and rural highways usually have only one lane in each direction. The words freeway, expressway or motorway are generally reserved for the most arterial routes, usually with grade-separated intersections and usually significantly straightened and widened to a minimum of four lanes. The term motorway is used in some Australian cities to refer to freeways that have been allocated a metropolitan route number. Roads may be part-highway and part-freeway until they are fully upgraded. The Cahill expressway is the only \\"named\\" expressway in New South Wales, which opened in 1954, the first in the region. Austria In contrast to Germany, according to a 2002 amendment of the Austrian federal road act, Bundesstra√üen is the official term referring only to autobahns (Bundesstra√üen A) and limited-access roads (Schnellstra√üen, Bundesstra√üen S). The administration of all other former federal highways (Bundesstra√üen B) has passed to the federal states (Bundesl√§nder). Therefore, officially classified as Landesstra√üen, they are still colloquially called Bundesstra√üen and have retained their 'B' designation (except for Vorarlberg), followed by the number and a name. They are marked by a blue number sign. Belgium Belgium has the second highest density highway network in Europe after the Netherlands, at 54.7 km per 1000 km¬≤. Most Belgian highways have three lanes with a few exceptions like the ring roads around Brussels and Antwerp which have five or six lanes in some stretches. Belgium is situated at a crossroads of several countries, and its highways are used by many nationalities. Belgian highways are indicated by the letter \\"A\\" and a European number, with E numbers being used most often. Roads that are (part of) a ring road around a city or a town are usually indicated by an R number. Many of the highways in Belgium are illuminated at night, since there is a surplus of nuclear-powered electricity during off-peak hours. Bosnia and Herzegovina As for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Pan-European Corridor Vc Motorway, Budapest‚ÄìOsijek‚ÄìSarajevo‚ÄìPloƒçe, is one of the most significant and project of the highest priority; in Bosnia and Herzegovina it coincides with A1 Motorway. The construction works on the road have already begun, but intensified beginning of the construction will be a key starter of economic and social activities, and will enable Bosnia and Herzegovina to be connected to main European traffic network, as well as to global European economic and social structure. Construction of the motorway, whose total length is 340 km, will provide: rational connecting to neighboring countries and regions; stabilizing and developing effects will be reached; transport conditions and quality of life improvement; economy competitiveness enhancement; new projects launched and national and international private investments enhancement.  Botswana Brazil In Brazil, highways (or expressway/freeway) are named \\"rodovia\\", and Brazilian highways are divided in two types: regional highways (generally of less importance and entirely inside of one state) and national highways (of major importance to the country). In Brazil, rodovia is the name given exclusively to roads connecting two or more cities with a sizable distance separating the extremes of the highway. Urban highways for commuting are uncommon in Brazil, and when they are present, they receive different names, depending on the region (Avenida, Marginal, Linha, Via, Eixo, etc.). Very rarely names other than \\"rodovia\\" are used. Regional highways are named YY- XXX, where YY is the abbreviation of the state where the highway is running in and XXX is a number (e.g. SP-280; where SP means that the highway is running entirely in the state of S√£o Paulo). National highways are named BR-XXX. National highways connects multiples states altogether, are of major importance to the national economy and/or connects Brazil to another country. The meaning of the numbers are: * 001‚Äì100 ‚Äì it means that the highway runs radially from Bras√≠lia. It is an exception to the cases below. * 101‚Äì200 ‚Äì it means that the highway runs in a south‚Äìnorth way. * 201‚Äì300 ‚Äì it means that the highway runs in a west‚Äìeast way * 301‚Äì400 ‚Äì it means that the highway runs in a diagonal way (northwest‚Äìsoutheast, for example) * 400‚Äì499 ‚Äì another exception, they are less important highways and its function is to connect a city to an arterial highway nearby Often, Brazilian highways receive names (famous people, etc.) on top of their YY/BR-XXX designation (example: SP-280 is also known as Rodovia Castelo Branco). Bulgaria The strategic location of the country on the Balkan Peninsula is decisive for the fact that 4 out of 10 land Pan-European corridors run through it, and 10 European routes - 6 A-class and 4 B-class routes. Highways in Bulgaria are dual carriageways, grade separated with controlled-access, designed for high speeds. In 2012 legislation amendments defined two types of highways: motorways and expressways. The main differences are that motorways have emergency lanes and the maximum allowed speed limit is 140 km/h, while expressways don't and the speed limit is 120 km/h. As of December 2018, of motorways are in service, with another being under various stages of construction. More than of motorways are planned. Also, several expressways are planned. Canada Evening traffic on Highway 401, North America's busiest highway, in Canada. * In Canada, there is no national standard for nomenclature, although in non- technical contexts highway appears to be most popular in most areas. The general speed limits on most Canadian highways range between 80 km/h (50 mph) and 110 km/h (70 mph) on two-lane highways rural and urban highways and between 80 km/h (50 mph) and 120 km/h (75 mph) on multi-lane, divided highways. Prairie Provinces are known for having higher speed limits than Central Canada and the Maritimes because of the flat geography and more car dominant way of life, however British Columbia remains the only province in Canada to have a speed limit of 120 km/h on the Coquihalla Freeway. * Canada is the second largest country in the world in terms of land area, though it only has of paved roads. This is far less highway and road distance than the United States, which is smaller, but has more than 6,000,000 kilometres of paved roads and highways. However, Canada still has many more roads and highways than Russia, the largest country in the world in land area, with an estimated just 336,000 kilometres (208,000 miles) of paved roads. * The most extensive freeway network in Canada is in the well-populated southeastern Canada, linking southern Ontario, southern Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the United States. This makes the freeway network there very well- travelled, requiring these routes to be well-maintained to overcome the frequently harsh winter weather, wide enough to accommodate the high traffic volumes that they carry in large metropolitan areas (such as around Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, and Detroit) in order to reduce the economic problems and frustrations that result from heavy traffic congestion, and also be safe enough to reduce the number of vehicle accidents. *Ontario has some of the busiest freeways in North America. It has all public roads legally defined as highways, though provincially managed roads are known legally as Provincial Highways. In day-to-day usage, the term highway is used for provincial routes or freeways. It is also common for surface routes to be referred to by number (e.g. \\"Take Highway 10 from Mississauga to Owen Sound\\"), especially by older generations. The words freeway or expressway are sometimes used to refer to controlled-access, high-speed, grade-separated highways such as the 400-series highways, the Gardiner Expressway, the Don Valley Parkway, the Conestoga Parkway, or the E.C. Row Expressway. The only highway officially labelled as a freeway is the Macdonald‚ÄìCartier Freeway, usually known as Highway 401, or simply \\"the 401\\", which is North America's busiest freeway, as well as one of the widest in the world at 18 through lanes in the section passing through Toronto. The Queen Elizabeth Way was the first intercity divided highway in North America.https://www.klusster.com/klussters/journeys- into/publications/qew-north-america-s-first-intercity-divided-highway-268 Nearly all highways in Ontario use parclo interchanges, which were developed by the province. Parclos are used to avoid weaving and to maximize efficiency and safety. * In Quebec, major highways are called autoroutes in French, and expressways or autoroutes in English. * Nova Scotia numbers its highways by the trunk routes they parallel. For example, Highway 107 parallels Trunk 7. This, to a lesser extent, also applies in Ontario (e.g. Highway 410 and Highway 420 parallel Highway 10 and Highway 20.) Nova Scotia also numbers its highways according to usage: main arterial highways are in the 100s, secondary or old arterial highways are numbered in the double digits from 1 to 28, and collector roads are numbered in the triple digits starting at 200. * The Trans-Canada Highway (or Trans-Canada) is a highway that crosses all of Canada from east to west and enters all ten provinces. The Trans-Canada ranges from a two-lane highway as it runs through the mountains of British Columbia with occasional divided highway status as the Province commits to twinning the road, a full divided highway with some sections qualifying as freeway status throughout Alberta and Saskatchewan, a mixture of both throughout Manitoba, a two-lane at-grade highway again as it passes through the sparsely populated areas of northern Ontario, and a multi-lane freeway as it travels through southern Ontario, southern Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. There are three or more ferry routes along the Trans-Canada, which allows it to connect to Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Haida Gwaii, and Vancouver Island. The Confederation Bridge provides an alternative route from New Brunswick to Prince Edward Island. Since the Trans-Canada Highway is not yet a divided, multi-lane freeway for its entire length, the section that crosses the western provinces and northern Ontario is considered to be more of an equivalent to the U.S. Route highway network in the neighboring United States. southern Ontario's 400-series freeways, Quebec's autoroutes, New Brunswick's portion of the Trans-Canada, Nova Scotia's 100-series highways, Alberta's Ring Road system, and Saskatchewan's Ring Road system are provincial equivalents to the American Interstate Highway System. The Canadian freeways interconnect with each other across provincial lines, and also with the American Interstate system. For example, freeways in Qu√©bec connect Montreal with the American border, and thence Interstate 87 continues from there to New York City, and likewise, Toronto is connected to the border by Ontario freeways, and thence by Interstate 190 to Buffalo, New York. Chile Chile has a large highway coverage which connects the whole country with the exception of the Magallanes region. China, People's Republic \\"Highways\\" in China, more often than not, refer to China National Highways. The fully controlled-access, multi-lane, divided routes are instead called expressways. , there were 5.98 million km of highways and 131,000 km of expressways in China; both total lengths are the longest in the world. In Mainland China, private companies reimbursed through tolls are the primary means of creating and financing the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS). Expressways are lumped with first-grade G-prefixed gu√≥d√†o (ÂõΩÈÅì, or \\"national highway\\") or A-prefixed first-grade expressways in major municipal cities. All roads in the NTHS and most A-prefixed roads are expressways. * M-prefix: National (Trunk) Expressways (planned) * G-prefix: National highways (typically expressways) * A-prefix: Municipal highways (typically expressways) * S-prefix: Provincial highways * X-prefix: County highways * Y-prefix: Rural roads * Z-prefix: Special use roads (e.g., airport expressways) Some highways are numbered with a leading zero (e.g. G030). The term Freeway during the 1990s was used on a few expressways (such as the Jingshi Freeway). The term freeway has since been replaced with expressway on all signs in China. The Chinese name for expressways is È´òÈÄüÂÖ¨Ë∑Ø; in pinyin, it is gƒÅos√π g≈çngl√π, which literally means \\"high speed public road\\". Signs on the National Highways (G-prefix) are green, while on the lower-grade highways and urban expressways (A-prefix) are blue. Hong Kong In Hong Kong, the type of high speed roads is referred to as expressway, but some are named as highways or roads ('Yuen Long Highway', 'Tolo Highway', 'Tsuen Wan Road', 'Tuen Mun Road', etc.). Some others are named corridors and bypasses. Colombia Antioquia. In Colombia are managed by the Colombian Ministry of Transport through the National Institute of Roads. Colombia's road infrastructure is still very underdeveloped with most of the highways presenting a two lane road for outbound and inbound traffic. Some exceptions are the Autopista Norte, linking Bogota and the towns of Tunja and Sogamoso and the Highways of the Valle del Cauca, an infrastructure improvement project started about a decade ago which has not yet been entirely finished. Several dual-carriage ways also link cities like Medellin, Pereira, Manizales and Armenia. Nowadays, the direct public funding on highways is increasing, focused mostly in connecting Colombia's agricultural and industrial heartland with its Caribbean and Pacific ports through twinning existing roads and the construction of 5,892 km of roads.http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/39e07b96-4b3d-11e5-b558-8a9722977189.html#axzz3qM7qruwu The most important projects under negotiation or construction are La Ruta del Sol (the Sun Road), a 4-lane highway between Bogota and the Caribbean coast; and the Highway between Bogota and Buenaventura (Colombia's largest and busiest port) which includes a 9 km tunnel. Croatia Croatia has 11 highways and 13 expressways. The earliest highway in Croatia was built in 1971. The word highway is a common Croatian translation of the term autocesta, which describes a toll highway similar to a freeway or an Autobahn. Czechia Czechia has 17 motorways. The construction of the earliest Czech highway (D1) between Prague and Brno was initiated in 1939, but was twice interrupted and reached Brno only in 1980. The word highway is a common Czech translation of the term d√°lnice, which describes a toll highway similar to a freeway or an Autobahn. Denmark With the completion of the extremely long highway bridge-tunnels of Great Belt Fixed Link in 1998 and √òresund Bridge in 2000, continental Europe was finally connected by road and rail with capital city Copenhagen and Sweden. This includes the Swedish highway and railroad system. The bridge-tunnels are all interconnected with major Danish highways and completes a continuous international road connection from northern Sweden to Gibraltar at the southern edge of Spain and Messina, Italy, at the southern tip of the Italian \\"boot\\". The 18 kilometre Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link has commenced construction in 2017, planning to link Zealand (with Copenhagen) to northern Germany by 2028. Finland The national highways in Finland are numbered 1-29 and are in total 9,000 km long. This number system originates from 1938. There are motorways for 881 kilometres around the largest cities, specially down south near the capital Helsinki. Highways numbered 1-6 are the main connection roads in Finland. France France has a national highway system dating back to Louis XV (see Corps of Ponts et Chauss√©es). The chauss√©es constructed at this time, radiating out from Paris, form the basis for the \\"routes nationales\\" (RN), whose red numbers differ from the yellow numbering used for secondary \\"routes departementales\\". The RNs numbered from 1 to 20 radiate from Paris to major ports or border crossings. More recently (after the Second World War), France has constructed Autoroutes, ex. A6-A7 which is called \\"Autoroute du Soleil\\", superhighways (usually toll) with a speed limit of 130 km/h (110 in rainy conditions or urban areas). Germany Aside from highways bearing the Autobahn designation, Germany has many two- and four-lane roads. Federal highways not known as autobahnen are called Bundesstra√üen (Bundesstrassen) and, while usually two-lane roads, they may also be four-lane, limited-access expressways of local or regional importance. Unlike the Autobahnen, though, Bundesstra√üen (marked by black numbers on a yellow background) mostly have speed limits (usually 100 km/h, but occasionally higher on limited-access segments, and lower in urban areas or near intersections). GreeceHungary Hungary has 7 major motorways (\\"aut√≥p√°lya\\"): * M0 is a quasi-circular highway for the traffic bypassing Budapest. It is divided in 4 sectors: Southern (links motorways M1, M7, M6 and M5), South-eastern (links Motorway M5 and Main Road nr. 4), Eastern (links Main Road nr. 4 and Motorway M3), Northern (links Main Road nr. 2 with the Megyeri Bridge) and Western (to be finished in 2015; will link main roads 11, 11 and Motorway M1). The total length will be around 100 km. * M1: links Budapest and the north-western border with Austria (Hegyeshalom), then continues its way toward Vienna. The total length is around 170 km. * M3: links Budapest and the north-eastern city of Miskolc (M30 branch), eastern cities of Ny√≠regyh√°za (M3) and Debrecen (M35 branch). Provides links toward Slovakia, Ukraine and Romania. It has a total length of around 250 km. * M5: links Budapest and the southern city of Szeged, then the Serbian border (R√∂szke). It provides a connection to Southern Europe by route E75 and also links to route 68 in Romania. M5 motorway has a length of around 140 km. * M7: links Budapest and the southern shore of Lake Balaton, then continues its way toward Croatia and Slovenia. Its length is about 230 km. * M6: links Budapest and Duna√∫jv√°ros, now extended to the southern city of P√©cs. The original length was around 60 km. Highways in Hungary Also, there are other smaller motorway sections that will be linked to the national motorway network in the future. See here an animation of Hungarian motorway developments (past, present and future): \\"T√©rk√©p anim√°ci√≥\\". Motorways usually have 2 traffic lanes and an emergency lane on each direction, divided by a green zone and metallic rail. The speed limit is 130 km/h. Expressways usually have no dividing lane in the middle, but sometimes have a metallic rail. The number of lanes is one per direction, with sections of 1+2 lanes (for easier overtaking). The speed limit is 110 km/h. Motorways and expressways cannot be used by vehicles that are not able to reach 60 km/h. There is a toll on all motorways, except M0. Trucks and buses have a separate toll system. () Those who wish to travel on these roads have to buy a sticker. Controversially, there is no option to buy a one-day or one-time pass for passenger cars. Main roads usually have one lane per direction, no dividing rail. The speed limit is 110 km/h. County roads have less traffic than main roads, the speed limit is 90 km/h. India National Highway (India) (), National Highway 7 (India) (longest Highway of India), India. In India, 'Highway' refers to one of the many National Highways and State Highways that run up to a total length of over 300,000 km consisting mostly of two-lane paved roads, changing into higher lanes mostly around cities. National Highways are designated as NH followed by the number. As of 2009, the major cities in India ‚Äì Ahmedabad, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Delhi ‚Äì are connected by the Golden Quadrilateral or North-South and East-West Corridor, that consists of 4 to 6 laned roads. Other major cities are connected to it by the National Highways. An expressway refers to any access controlled road with grade-separated intersections and make up a very small portion of India's highway network, at about 1454.4 km in length. Expressways are separate from the highway network, except for the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, which is part of NH 8. Agra-Lucknow Expressway is the longest expressway more than 300 km in India after its inauguration on 21 November 2016 replacing Yamuna Expressway 165 km, cost ‚Çπ150 billion (US$2.2 billion). Indonesia The Indonesian national route system exists solely on Java. Examples of roads include Jakarta's Inner and Outer ring roads, the Cipularang Toll Road in West Java connecting Jakarta and Bandung, and the Trans-Java toll road that connects Jakarta and Surabaya. It's also connects to Cirebon (Cikopo‚ÄìPalimanan Toll Road), Semarang (Batang- Semarang Toll Road), Surakarta (Semarang-Solo Toll Road) and several towns on both Central and East Java. Especially the North Coast in Central Java. Ireland The Republic of Ireland has the 6th densest motorway network in Europe. 'N' road or 'R' road. The maximum speed is 120 km/h on motorways. The main Inter Urban route Motorways connecting Dublin by motorway to the cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, as well as other projects, has increased the total motorway network in the state to approximately 1,017 kilometres (632 mi). Iran Hemmat Expressway in Tehran In Iran the term highway ~ commonly known as autobahn (in Persian: ÿßÿ™Ÿàÿ®ÿßŸÜ /ÿ®ÿ≤ÿ±⁄Øÿ±ÿßŸá), is applied to roads that are constructed by particular standards. The conventional speed limit of 120 km/h is in place for most highways. There are two types of highway in Iran: # Inner cities highways: They can be found in larger cities such as Tehran. The main purpose of them is to prevent congestion and pass traffics through cities. # Between cities highway: They connect different parts of the country together. Iraq Israel Italy The A3 in Italy. In Italy the term highway can be applied to superstrada (can be translated as expressway and it is toll free) and autostrada (Italian term for motorway: the most part of the system is mandatory toll). Italy was the first country in the world to build such roads, the first one being the \\"Autostrada dei Laghi\\" (Autostrada of the Lakes), from Milan to Varese, built in 1921 and finished in 1924. This system of early motorways was extended in the early 1930s till the early 1970s. Nowadays the Autostrade is a comprehensive system of about 6.500 km of modern motorways where the maximum speed limit is 130 km/h. Japan The expressways, or k≈çsokud≈çro (high speed roads), of Japan are made of a huge network of freeway-standard toll roads. Once government- owned, they have been a turned over to private companies. Most expressways are four lanes with a central reservation, or median. The speed limits, with certain regulations and great flexibility, usually include a maximum speed of 100 km/h, and a minimum speed of 50 km/h. LithuaniaMalaysia South section of North‚ÄìSouth Expressway in Malaysia, facing towards Kuala Lumpur. The highest level of major roads in Malaysia, expressway (lebuhraya), has full access control, grade separated junctions, and mostly tolled. The expressways link the major state capitals in Peninsular Malaysia and major cities in Klang Valley. Highway is lower level with limited access control, some at-grade junctions or roundabouts, and generally with 2 lanes in each separated direction. These are generally untolled and funded by the federal government, hence the first one is called Federal Highway linking Klang and Kuala Lumpur. The trunk roads linking major cities and towns in the country are called federal trunk roads, and are generally 2 lanes single carriageway roads, in places with a third climbing lane for slow lorries. MexicoMoroccoNew Zealand State Highway 1 in South Auckland, New Zealand In New Zealand, both motorway and an expressway have at least two lanes of traffic in either direction separated by a median, with no access to adjacent properties. The distinction depends on the type of traffic allowed to use the route. Non- vehicular traffic and farm equipment are prohibited from motorways, while pedestrians, cyclists, tractors, and farm animals are legally entitled to use expressways such as the Waikato Expressway south of the Bombay Hills and the Tauranga expressway system, although this is rare. New Zealand's main routes are designated state highways as they are funded by the central government. State Highway 1 is the only route to run through both the North and South Islands, and runs (in order north‚Äìsouth) from Cape Reinga to Wellington in the North Island, and from Picton to Bluff in the South Island. State Highways 2‚Äì5 are main routes in the North Island, State Highways 6‚Äì9 in the South Island, and state highways numbered from 10 onwards are generally found in numerical order from north to south. State highways usually incorporate different standards of roads, for example, State Highway 1 from Auckland to Hamilton incorporates the Northern and Southern Motorways in the Auckland area, the Waikato Expressway, and a rural road before passing through the streets of Hamilton. The term freeway is rarely used relating to New Zealand roads. Netherlands A4 motorway near Hoofddorp The Autosnelweg system is in constant development. Most of its parts are owned and funded by the government, but in recent times Public-private partnership come more and more into practice, such as in a part of the A59 between Oss and 's-Hertogenbosch. The Netherlands has the highest density highway network of Europe at 56.5 km per 1000 km¬≤, followed by Belgium. The 'Autosnelwegen', the main corridors, are designated with an A while secondary connecting roads have an N number. Sections of the A network are also part of the International E-road network in connecting with neighboring Belgium, Germany and England, the latter by ferry. The speed limit is 130 km/h, unless noted otherwise, and 120 km/h, 100 km/h or 80 km/h on various locations. This is done to reduce exhaust emissions and to limit noise to surrounding residential areas. North Macedonia Total length of the Macedonian motorways as of Spring 2019 is 317 km, with another 57 km being under construction. There are plans to extend the network with works planned to start in 2020. Major sections are A1 (E-75), which connects the northern (Serbia) to the southern border (Greece), A2 (E-65) connects Skopje, Tetovo and Gostivar (Kicevo and Ohrid by 2021). A3 connects Skopje to the eastern town of Stip. Norway Motorvei in Bergen, Norway. Norway has a national highway system, numbered 2-899. Some main highways are also European highways and have an E before the number. The highways are often relatively narrow and curvy. Near the larger cities, especially around Oslo and Trondheim, there are motorways. Norway has also been engaged in recent decades in boring some extremely long highway tunnels through the mountain ranges, and some of these, now the world's longest, are so long that they have hollowed- out caverns in the midst of them for motorists to stop and take rests. Pakistan M2-1 Pakistan has its own network of highways and motorways. Motorways extending from M1 to M10 will eventually connect whole length of the country from Peshawar to Karachi. The M2, the first motorway, was built in 1997 with the contract being awarded to the Korean firm Daewoo. It linked the federal capital Islamabad with Punjab's provincial capital Lahore. The network was then extended to Sargodha and then to Faisalabad with the M3. M1 highway to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's capital Peshawar had been completed in October 2007. M4, M5, M6, and M7 have been planned and also being built by local and foreign firms. This will connect Faisalababd, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rotadero (Larkana) to Karachi. N5 links Karachi to other cities. Entry on all Pakistan highways is restricted to fast moving wheelers only. Slow-moving traffic and two wheelers (such as motorcycles and bicycles) are not allowed and construction and agricultural machinery is also restricted. Highway Police personnel use heavy motor bikes and fast moving Range Rovers for patrolling and are quite good at maintaining the traffic system. M9 and M10 are also functional now that connect Karachi to Hayderabad. The LSM (Lahore Sialkot Motorway) which is 103 km is under construction and will be completed by 2010. Expressways are similar to motorways with lesser access restrictions and are owned, maintained and operated either federally or provincially. A patrol car of Pakistan's National Highways & Motorway Police on the M-2 Motorway Pakistan's Motorways are patrolled by Pakistan's National Highways & Motorway Police (NH&MP;), which is responsible for enforcement of traffic and safety laws, security and recovery on the Pakistan Motorway network. The NH&MP; use SUVs, cars and heavy motorbikes for patrolling purposes and uses speed cameras for enforcing speed limits.

Nevertheless, every Romanian car that uses a motorway or a national road in Romania must pay a toll, specifically a vignette. A few years ago the vignette was ported to an electronic format, thus eliminating the need of a physical display (sticker). Russia Russia has many highways, but only small number of them are currently motorways. Examples of Russian motorways are Moscow and Saint Petersburg Ring Roads. Highways and motorways are free in Russia and only two motorways, Western High Speed Diameter and Moscow-Saint Petersburg toll motorway, currently under construction, will be first Russian toll motorways. Russians themselves often translate the Russian name for highway (–ê–≤—Ç–æ–º–æ–±–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∏=automobile roads) into motorway in English, which is not a correct English name, it should be highway. Saudi Arabia Riyadh-Makkah Highway, Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has a total highway length of 73,000 km. Highways in Saudi Arabia vary from ten laned roads to small four laned roads. The city highways and other major highways are well maintained such as the roads in Riyadh. The roads are constructed so they resist the summer's extremely high heat and do not reflect the strong sun. The outer city highways such as the one linking from coast to coast are not as great as the inner-city Riyadh highway is fasts highways in KSA but the government is now working on rebuilding those roads. Some of the important inter-city highways include: * Dammam - Khafji Highway (457 120 km/h) * Jeddah - Makkah Highway (75 120 km/h) * Makkah - Madinah Al Munawarah Highway (421 120 km/h) * Riyadh - Gomfida Highway (395 140 km) * Riyadh - Qasim Highway (317 140 km) * Riyadh - Taif Highway (950 140 km) * Taif - Abha Highway (950 110 km) Serbia Highway Network (Serbia), Map of Serbian Highways. The highways in Serbia are classified as IA state roads and common name for highway is auto-put which functions based on toll pay system and controlled access. Serbia currently has 876 km of total length of highways (and total length of public roads is 40,845 km), while 1,154 km are planned. Because of its geographical position, it is very important for transit of capital, goods and services through Europe and Balkans, especially. As well it is one of most important countries on Balkans for Pan-european corridors (E65, E70, E75, E80, E661, E662, E761, E763, E771, E851). The signs on Serbian highways are green colored and speed limit is 130 km/h. The history of Serbian highways starts with socialist Yugoslavia, when increased production influenced on enlargement of transit on public roads. The first highway to be built was brotherhood and unity highway that encompassed Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia. That highway was part of the pan- european corridor X and was built around 1970-ties. Singapore The Bukit Timah Expressway in Singapore. The expressways of Singapore are all dual carriageways with grade-separated access. They usually have three lanes in each direction, although there are two- or five-lane carriageways in some places. There are nine expressways, with the newest one, the Marina Coastal Expressway which is constructed under modern technology under the water. Construction on the first expressway, the Pan Island Expressway, started in 1966. The other expressways were completed in stages, with the first phase of the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway being the most recently completed, in 2007. Today, there are 164 kilometres of expressways in Singapore. Slovakia D1 motorway in Slovakia The highways in Slovakia are divided into motorways (diaƒænica) and expressways (r√Ωchlostn√© cesty). The first modern highway in Slovakia should have been in the 30s planned motorway connecting Prague with northern parts of Slovakia; however the construction of the Slovak motorways was not started until 1970s. As of December 2018, of motorways and of expressways are in service, with another being under various stages of construction. Slovenia Highway Network (Slovenia), Map of Slovenian Highways. The highways in Slovenia are the central state roads in Slovenia and are divided into motorways (Slovene: avtocesta, AC) and expressways (hitra cesta, HC). Motorways are dual carriageways with a speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour (81 mph). They have white-on-green road signs as in Italy, Croatia and other countries nearby. Expressways are secondary roads, also dual carriageways, but without an emergency lane. They have a speed limit of 110 kilometres per hour (68 mph) and have white-on-blue road signs. South Africa Colloquially, the terms \\"freeway\\", \\"highway\\", and \\"motorway\\" are used synonymously. The term \\"expressway\\" is not common in South Africa. A freeway, highway or motorway refers to a divided dual carriageway with limited access, and at least two lanes in either direction. A central island, usually either with drainage, foliage, or high-impact barriers, provides a visible separation between the carriageways in opposite directions. As in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and Japan, South Africans drive on the left-hand side of the road and nearly all steering wheels are on the right-hand side of vehicles. Freeways are designated with one of three labels: N (in reference to national roads), R (short for \\"route\\", in reference to provincial roads), and M (in reference to metropolitan roads). This has more to do with the location of a road and its function than anything else. In addition, \\"N\\" roads usually run the length of the country over long distances, \\"R\\" roads usually inter- connect cities and towns within a province, and \\"M\\" roads carry heavy traffic in metropolitan areas. Route markings also determine who paid for the road: \\"N\\" was paid for by national government, \\"R\\" by provincial government, and \\"M\\" by local government. In recent years, some \\"R\\" roads have been re-designated as \\"N\\" roads, so that control and funding comes from the South African National Roads Agency. South Korea Expressways in South Korea were originally numbered in order of construction. Since August 24, 2001, they have been numbered in a scheme somewhat similar to that of the Interstate Highway System in the United States: * Arterial routes are designated by two-digit route numbers, with north‚Äìsouth routes having odd numbers, and east‚Äìwest routes having even numbers. Primary routes (i.e. major thoroughfares) have five and zero as their last digits respectively, while lesser (secondary) routes have various final digits. * Branch routes have three-digit route numbers, where the first two digits match the route number of an arterial route. * Belt lines have three-digit route numbers where the first digit matches the respective city's postal code. * Route numbers in the range 70-99 are not used in South Korea and are reserved for designations in the event of Korean reunification. * The Gyeongbu Expressway kept its Route 1 designation, as it is South Korea's first and most important expressway. Spain An older highway in Spain Spain's national highway system dates back to the era of King Carlos III. The roads built at this time, radiating from Madrid, form the basis for the carreteras nacionales radiales, numbered clockwise from I to VI, which radiate from Madrid to major ports or border crossings. In the 1960s Spain started to construct autopistas (toll highways) and autov√≠as (freeways), and in 2016 had 17,109 km (10,631 mi) of highways, the biggest network in Europe and the fourth in the world, only after the USA, India, and China. Sri Lanka Southern Expressway (E01) is the first expressway in Sri Lanka. It travers from Kottawa (township in Suburban Colombo) to Matara (126 km) and the construction of the section from Kottawa to Pinnaduwa (Galle) was completed as a dual Expressway with 4-lane facility and declared open in November 2011. Galle Port access road has been built to connect Galle city to Pinnaduwa interchange. The design speed of this Expressway is 120 km/h. The operation speed of the Expressway is 100 km/h. The Southern Expressway will be extended up to Hambantota connecting Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port. The second expressway to be declared open in Sri Lanka was the Colombo - Katunayake Expressway (E03) that was opened for public from October 2013, which also connects Sri Lanka's premier international airport Bandaranaike International Airport with capital Colombo. Colombo Outer Circular Expressway (E02), which is currently under construction, is designed to link the major expressways connected to Sri Lanka's commercial hub, Colombo, bypassing the traffic within the city limits. Sweden The first freeway in Sweden was built between the cities of Malm√∂ and Lund in the Sk√•ne County in southern Sweden. The Swedish roads are divided in three classes; Motorv√§g, which is a 4-8 lane motorway with the speed limit of 110‚Äì120 km/h. Riksv√§g, which is a state highway with 2-4 lanes. The Riksv√§g has a speed limit of 70‚Äì100 km/h. The last road is the L√§nsv√§g, which is a \\"county route\\" with 2 lanes and 70‚Äì90 km/h in speed limit. The authority which is responsible for the roads in Sweden is Trafikverket. Switzerland The term Autobahn (German) / Autoroute (French) / Autostrada (Italian) is used for normal highways where there is a central physical structure separating two different directional carriageways. This is often translated into English as motorways. In express routes where there is no central physical structure separating two different directional carriageways, but crossings are still motorway-like otherwise, and traffic lights are not present, the road is instead called an Autostrasse / Semi-autoroute / Semi-autostrada, usually translated into English as an expressway. Those often have a lower speed limit than motorways. Taiwan The construction of Taiwan's national highways began in 1971 and the design is heavily based on the American Interstate Highway System. The Northern section between Keelung City and Zhongli City (now Zhongli District, Taoyuan) was completed in 1974. The construction of the first freeway (No. 1) was completed in 1978. The freeway runs from the northern port city cf Keelung to the southern port city of Kaohsiung. There was an 8.6 km branch (No. 1A) connecting the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. Construction on the other freeways began in the late 1980s. The north section of the second north‚Äìsouth freeway (No. 3) between Xizhi City and Hsinchu City was completed in 1997. The No. 1A Branch was extended to link No. 3 Freeway at Yingge, and renamed as No. 2 Freeway. Three other short freeways (No. 4, No. 8, and No. 10) were built to link the two north‚Äìsouth freeways in Taichung County (now part of Taichung City), Tainan County (now part of Tainan City), and Kaohsiung County (now part of Kaohsiung City), respectively. The entire No. 3 Freeway was completed in January, 2004. To ease the congestion of No. 1 Freeway in the Taipei metropolitan area, a 20 km elevated bridge was built in 1997 on top of the original freeway between Xizhi City and Wugu, to serve as a bypass for traffic not exiting/entering the freeway within the city limits of Taipei. The construction of a freeway connecting the Taipei metropolitan area and Yilan County began in 1991 and was completed in June 2006. It includes a 12.9 km tunnel (Hsuehshan Tunnel), which is the fifth longest road tunnel in the world. An extension from Yilan County to Hualien County is planned. However, its construction is being delayed due to environmental concerns. Thailand The motorways (Thai: ‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏û‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏®‡∏©, RTGS: thang luang phiset) in Thailand is an intercity toll controlled-access highways network that currently spans 145 kilometres (90 mi). It is to be greatly extended to 4,154.7 kilometres (2,581.6 mi) according to the master plan. Thailand's motorway network is considered to be separate from Thailand's expressway network, which is the system of expressways, usually elevated, within Greater Bangkok. Thailand also has a provincial highway network. Turkey Turkey's main highway is E80 (former E5) runs from Edirne to the capital Ankara. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the terms used for vehicular highways other than motorways include main road, trunk road, 'A' road / 'B' road, 'C' road, and unclassified road; they may additionally, where appropriate, be described as dual carriageways. However, in the law of England and Wales the term public highway includes all public rights of way regardless of the kind or amount of traffic they allow, including streets and public footpaths for pedestrians.Footways and Footpaths - what's the difference in law? at omgili.com: \\"A footway is part of the highway set aside for foot use whereas a footpath is a highway for use only on foot.\\" The term also includes bridleways, which are for pedestrians, equestrians, and cyclists, as well as by-ways open to all traffic (for all of those users, plus vehicular traffic). In England and Wales, the public is said to have a \\"right of way\\" over a highway. This means that, subject to statutory restrictions, the route (or \\"way\\") must be kept clear to allow travel by anyone who wishes to it. At common law, it is unlawful to obstruct a highway or to interfere with its lawful use. However, many statutory provisions provide powers to do so (for instance. to carry out roadwork). Many public highways in the UK have a private owner. That is, someone can prove \\"title\\" to them, either by being the registered owner or by having conveyances showing exactly how the land has been bought and sold over a long period of time. Such ownership in no way affects the public highway rights, since the relevant \\"highway authority\\" (usually a local authority or the Highways Agency in England and Wales, or Amey Highways in Scotland) is deemed to own the surface of the highway, despite someone else's ownership of the land it passes over or under. Rights- of-way exist over all highways maintained at the public expense (the majority of roads) and also over some other ways which are not so maintained, on the principle of \\"once a highway, always a highway\\". In such cases, landowners must allow public use for \\"passing and repassing\\". A right-of-way may be created by custom (by the way being used for a long period of time) or under the relevant Sections of the Highways Act of 1980. A right-of-way may be extinguished or diverted in a number of ways, such as by an Act of Parliament, by a magistrates' stopping-up or diversion order, or by powers given to principal local authorities. For instance, under the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act of 1996, authority was given for the builder of this railway link to stop up certain highways that are mentioned in Schedule 3 of the act. The opposite of a highway is a private road or pathway over which no rights-of-way exist. Any use of such private ways is subject to the consent of the owner of the land. Richard Mabey poses the origin of the word \\"highway\\" back to the Romans in his book \\"The Roadside Wildlife Book\\", 1974: \\"Daniel Defoe, writing in the 1720s, describes the Fosse Way as being raised eight or nine feet in many places. Between AD 40 and 80, the Romans laid something like 6,500 miles of highway. United States Interstate 75/Interstate 85 in Atlanta, Georgia, is a typical urban freeway in United States. U.S. Highway 127 in Lansing, Michigan In the United States, \\"highway\\" is a general term for denoting a public way, including the entire area within the right-of-way, and includes many forms: # a high-speed, limited-access road like expressways, two-lane expressway, freeways, and large toll highways. # an important road that connects cities and large towns. # any road or street, or a travel way of any kind, including pedestrian ways, trails, and navigable waterways, to which the public has a perpetual right of use. Note that the phrase \\"right-of-way\\" is used differently in the United States than it is in the United Kingdom and certain other places. In the U.S. a highway or road \\"right-of-way\\" means the land on which the pavement rests, plus the shoulders beside the pavements, plus any median strip, plus any other adjacent piece of land that is designated for the purposes of the highway or road. In other words, the \\"right-of-way\\" is the strip of land for the highway or road, and a sign that says, \\"No Parking on Right-of-Way\\" means that drivers may not park on the pavement or on the land adjacent to it. Many paved highways for vehicles are part of the official National Highway System of the U.S.. Paved highways in the United States Numbered Highway System (for example, U.S. Highway 53) can vary from two lanes wide (one lane each direction), shoulderless, roads with no access control, to multi-lane high-speed controlled-access highway, such as the Interstate Highways. These roads are usually distinguished by being important, but not always the primary, routes that connect populated areas. (Sometimes, the primary route is a state highway.) Since their inception many decades ago, the construction of U.S. Highways, and their major improvements, have been paid for 50% with federal funds, especially from motor fuel taxes, and 50% with state funds from whatever tax resources that the state has. Thus, the system of U.S. Highways has always been an equal partnership between the federal government and the state governments. This was a plan that changed dramatically with the advent of the Interstate Highway System beginning in the 1950s, but do not forget that the system of U.S. Highways continued to be upgraded under the 50%-50% funding. Highways continue to be widened, old bridges continue to be replaced with newer and better ones, and so forth. The term Highways in the U.S. even includes major paved roads that serve purposes similar to those of the U.S. Highways or Interstate Highways, but which are completely designed, paid for, and maintained by state or local governments. An example of this is M-6 (Michigan highway), which is an urban bypass of Grand Rapids, Michigan, that is a multi-lane, controlled-access highway entirely designed and paid for by Michigan. Much of the traffic uses it to bypass downtown Grand Rapids to make connections between Interstate 96, Interstate 196 and U.S. Highway 131. When the Act of Congress that authorized the Interstate Highway System was passed and then signed by President Eisenhower, it was already clear that the Interstate Highways would be far more expensive, mile-for-mile, than the U.S. Highways had been. Because of their great cost, Congress decided to set the standard for federal funding for the Interstate System at 90%, leaving 10% for the states to pay for. Another monetary difference came from the fact that the Interstate Highways were to be designed to be high-speed and safe expressways. This meant that they needed to have much wider open strips of land along their sides, because this created safety zones on each side of the highways so that vehicles that were in accidents or simply lost control would have somewhere to go, to slow down gradually, and not crash into trees, boulders, light poles, buildings, parked vehicles, fire hydrants, and other kinds of obstacles. Roadway interchanges for Interstate Highways were also to be very large (and over the decades, they became a lot larger than anyone had anticipated in the 1950s). With so much land being taken away for the highways, the only way to justify it and to make it politically palatable was for the Federal and State governments to outright purchase all of the land. There could be no question of just having an easement for the highway and its right-of-way. All of the land within the right-of-way would be permanently owned by the governments, until such time that they decided to get rid of the highway and sell the land. In some places, highway is a synonym for road or street, and in some cases, the word highway is simply used in cases of carelessness and laziness on the part of the speaker, who believes that street, road, and highway are all synonymous and uses them accordingly. On the other hand, in another example, the California Motor Vehicle Code ¬ß 360 states: \\"'Highway' is a way or place of whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel. Highway includes street.\\" The California Supreme Court has held that \\"the definition of 'highway' in the Vehicle Code is used for special purposes of that act,\\" and that canals of the town of Venice, California, are \\"highways\\" also entitled to be maintained with state highway funds. The federal and state governments are trying to improve their National Highway System components by repaving highways, widening highways, replacing bridges, and reconstructing some interchanges. Many cloverleaf interchanges are being converted to parclo interchanges. Busy Diamond interchanges are also being converted to SPUIs (single-point-urban interchange) or to parclos to reduce interchange congestion. Arguably, the most famous United States highway is U.S. Route 66. It is immortalized in the song \\"(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66\\"\\", and by the TV series Route 66. Other famous highways in songs include [U.S.] Highway 61 (Bob Dylan, 1965), Carefree Highway in Arizona (Gordon Lightfoot, 1974), Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California (Jan & Dean, also Beach Boys, 1964), the song \\"Ventura Highway\\", named for a highway in Southern California (\\"America\\", 1972), and Blues Highway in Mississippi (Fred McDowell, 1959). Yemen Yemen has one of the oldest highway routes in the region. The first highway route was between Aden and Hadromout, with a two lane highway. Currently, Yemen has 71,300 kilometers of roads, of which only 6,200 kilometers are paved. Zimbabwe Zimbabwe has one of the better road networks in Africa that had been poorly maintained until recently. There has been an introduction of toll gates and the dualization of most of the major roads.

She is a professor in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara.USCB faculty page She has proposed a new analysis of the 100,000-year problem in the Milankovitch theory of climate change. She also created the analytical software behind the LR04,Paleoceangraphy, 2004 a \\"standard representation of the climate history of the last five million years\\".Geological Society of America, 2008 Subaru Outstanding Woman in Science Award  Education  Lisiecki graduated in 1995 from the South Carolina Governor‚Äôs School for Science and Mathematics. Lisiecki received her B.Sc. in Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science in 1999 and also obtained an M.Sc. in Geosystems in 2000 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She earned a M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Geological Sciences, both from Brown University in 2003 and 2005. Lisiecki's Ph.D. thesis was titled ‚ÄúPaleoclimate time series: New alignment and compositing techniques, a 5.3-Myr benthic Œ¥18O stack, and analysis of Pliocene-Pleistocene climate transitions‚Äù.  Current research  Lisiecki's current research focuses on paleoclimatology. Lisiecki's research interest in paleoclimatology arose from the lack of research and current understanding of the glacial cycles. Lisiecki uses various computational and mathematical methods to interpret and compare different paleoclimate records. In specific, she focuses on the evolution of the Plio-Pleistocene climate due to its relation to the Milankovitch forcing, 100-kyr glacial cycles, the carbon cycle, and deep-ocean circulation. Currently, Lisiecki designs and develops software for rendering age models and stratigraphy. As well, Lisiecki is creating 3D models of ocean circulation to determine the relationship between orbital forcing and ocean circulation patterns and account for time- variant uncertainties.  Contributions = HMM-Match (Lin et al, 2014)  Software designed using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for probabilistic sequence alignment of stratigraphic records.  Match & Autocomp Software (Lisiecki and Lisiecki, 2002)  Paleoceanography software designed to find the optimal alignment of two paleoclimate signals using penalty functions to constrain the rate of accumulation for sediments.  LR04 Benthic Stack (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005)  A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack, spanning 5.3-Myr, demonstrating an average of 57 globally distributed Benthic Œ¥18O records collected from scientific literature, which measure ice volume and deep ocean temperature. The records were placed on a common age model, represented by a graphic correlation algorithm. Lisiecki and Raymo's LR04 Stack contains significantly more variance in benthic Œ¥18O, in comparison to former published stacks of the late Pleistocene epoch. In the LR04, there are higher resolution records, an improved alignment technique, and a higher percentage of records from the Atlantic. The LR04 Stack is one of the most heavily cited Pliocene-entitled papers for Œ¥18O due to the intensive mathematical meticulousness incorporated into the record, the level of objectivity involved, its use of global distribution and duration. The existence of the LR04 Stack serves as a very important tool in paleoceanography. Earth's climate history In an effort to find patterns in Earth's climate history, Lisiecki researches ocean sediment cores. The history of Earth's climate lies in the composition of ocean sediments as scientists are able to derive millions of years worth of information through the alignment of these sedimentary layers. Through these layers, Lisiecki found a connection between earth‚Äôs climate cycle and earth‚Äôs orbital cycle; assuming glaciation and orbital eccentricity are both on 100,000-year cycles, she found that stronger changes in Earth‚Äôs orbit correlated with weaker changes in glaciation. The correlation between the two consists of complicated relations as 3 different elements of Earth's orbit; eccentricity, tilt and precession, must be taken into consideration alongside Earth's convoluted climate system.  100,000-year problem  One previous hypothesis held that the 100,000-year glacial cycles in the past 800,000 years were a result of cyclic changes in the Earth's orbital eccentricity. In 2010, Lisiecki discovered a negative correlation between the strength of glacial cycles and the eccentricity of the earth‚Äôs orbit over the past 1.2 million years, suggesting the possibility of internal instability of the earth‚Äôs climate in conjunction with its orbital cycles. Lisiecki proposed that this negative correlation is caused by the inhibition of internal climate feedbacks by periods of strong precession forcing. Lisiecki also suggested that long- term internal factors might be responsible, such as the carbon cycle or the ice sheets, though more research is required.

He was the brother of Sir Robert Grosvenor, 6th Baronet, an ancestor of the modern day Dukes of Westminster. Early life Richard Grosvenor was the eldest surviving son of Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet. His two older brothers, Thomas and Roger, pre-deceased their father.Handley, Stuart (2004) (online edition 2008) 'Grosvenor, Sir Thomas, third baronet (1655‚Äì1700)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Retrieved on 8 April 2010. At the time of his father's death in 1700 he was still being educated at Eton College, and was under the guardianship of Sir Richard Myddelton, 3rd Baronet, and Thomas and Francis Cholmondeley. After leaving Eton, he went on the Grand Tour, visiting Switzerland, Bavaria, Italy and the Netherlands. In 1707 he returned to the family home at Eaton Hall, Cheshire. Political career At the 1715 general election, Grosvenor was returned as Member of Parliament for Chester. Also in 1715, he was mayor of the city. In September 1715 he attended a meeting of the Jacobite Cheshire Club, when it decided not to take part in the rebellion. He was elected MP for Chester again in 1722. In 1727 he participated in the coronation of George II. At the 1727 general election, Grosvenor and his brother Thomas, won both of the parliamentary seats for Chester. During the time that Grosvenor was baronet, the estates in London were being developed. Also during this time there is evidence of the first association of the Grosvenor family with horse racing, when Grosvenor's horses ran at Chester and Newmarket in 1720. Family Grosvenor died in July 1732 and was buried at Eccleston, Cheshire. In 1708 he had married Jane, the daughter of Sir Edward Wyndham of Orchard Wyndham, Somerset. The couple had one daughter, Catherine, who died in 1718. During the following year, Jane Grosvenor died and Grosvenor then married Diana, the only daughter of Sir George Warburton, 3rd Baronet Arley. Again, they had no children. Grosvenor was therefore succeeded by his younger brother, Thomas, who in turn died later the same year.

However, it also held that the right to strike could infringe a business's freedom of establishment under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 49 (ex Article 43 TEC). The decision has been criticised for the Court's inarticulate line of reasoning, and its disregard of fundamental human rights.E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2018) ch 10, 439 The Rosella was shortly followed by a case on freedom to provide services called Laval Un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet,[2008] IRLR 160, Case 341/05) and by the influential European Court of Human Rights decision in Demir and Baykara v Turkey.(2009) 48 EHRR 54 Facts Viking Line ABP operated a ship called The Rosella between Estonia and Finland. It wanted to operate under the Estonian flag so that it could use Estonian workers on lower wages than the higher Finnish wages for the existing crew. The policy of the International Transport Workers Federation (ITWF) was to oppose such \\"reflagging\\" for convenience by companies registering their ship abroad in a low labour cost jurisdiction, when their real seat is in another country. The Finnish Seamen's Union, a member of the ITWF, planned industrial action. The ITWF told its partners to not negotiate with Viking and hinder its business. Viking Line ABP responded by seeking an injunction in the English courts, claiming that the industrial action would infringe its right to freedom of establishment under TEC art 43, now TFEU art 49. The High Court of Justice granted the injunction, but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales overturned the injunction on the balance of convenience.See American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] 1 All ER 504 It held that there were important issues of EU law to be heard, given that, in the words of Waller LJ, it affected the \\"fundamental rights of workers to take industrial action\\". So it made a TEC article 234 reference (now article 267) to the European Court of Justice. Judgment The European Court of Justice held that, though it was for the national court to ultimately answer the question, it was possible that collective action taken by workers to protect their interests could be unlawful because it infringed the employer's interests under TFEU article 56. It could not be the case, in this situation that the workers' interests were sufficiently threatened, because the ECJ felt that the jobs and conditions of the workers' employment were not 'jeopardised or under serious threat'.[2008] IRLR 143, [81] It was the case that 'the right to take collective action, including the right to strike, must... be recognised as a fundamental right which forms an integral part of the general principles of Community law', but 'the exercise of that right may nonetheless be subject to certain restrictions... in accordance with Community law and national law and practices.'[2008] IRLR 143, [44] Significance The judgment of the European Court of Justice was met with widespread condemnation by labour law experts on the basis that it failed to give due regard for the respect of human rights and places business freedom above the interests of working people. It was one of the triggers for the UK's 2009 Lindsey Oil Refinery strikes. The ILO's Committee of Experts found severe breaches of the ILO Convention 87 on the freedom of association and protection of the right to organise. Thus it is generally viewed as being characterised by poor quality reasoning and is regarded by most commentaries as wrong.See P Craig and G de Burca (2015) 819, fn 147, 92 case notes written so far.

He had a reputation for corruption, and the harshness which he and his wife showed to his tenants was remembered for centuries after their deaths. Background He was the eldest son of Robert Tanfield of Burford by his wife Wilgiford Fitzherbert. He was educated at Eton College and the Inner Temple. He was called to the bar by 1579. His career flourished largely due to the patronage of his first wife's uncle, Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley, the Queen's Champion. Career He was elected Member of Parliament for Woodstock in 1584, 1586, 1589, 1593, 1597 and 1601 and returned as a knight of the shire for Oxfordshire in 1604. He was knighted in 1604. He was appointed Serjeant- at-law in 1603, puisne judge of the King‚Äôs Bench in 1606 and Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1607. As a judge he was often accused of corruption, though none of the charges against him were ever proved. Tanfield bought Burford Priory in Oxfordshire in 1586, and the manors of Burford and Great Tew in 1611, which he partially enclosed in 1622, causing a bitter conflict with his neighbours and tenants (he was a notoriously harsh landlord). He appears to have had a collection of paintings at Burford, some of which subsequently passed to William Lenthall, who was a relative by marriage, and became part of the Lenthall pictures.The Lenthall Pictures, Nicholas Cooper, Victoria County History Tanfield Memorial, commemorating Sir Lawrence Tanfield and his second wife Elizabeth Evans, in the Church of St John the Baptist, Burford, erected 1628 He married firstly, before 1585, Elizabeth, daughter of Gyles Symonds (died circa 1596) of Cley next the Sea, Norfolk and his wife Katherine Lee, daughter of Sir Anthony Lee and sister of Sir Henry Lee, with whom he had a daughter Elizabeth, and secondly, before 1620, Elizabeth Evans of Loddington, Northamptonshire. Lady Tanfield His second wife seems to have been a woman of formidable character. Like her husband she was accused of corruption, in particular of taking bribes to influence her husband's judgements. Both were notorious for harshness to their tenants: in 1620 relations became so bad that Lady Tanfield threatened to \\"play the Devil \\" to the tenants, and grind them into powder. Like her husband she was remembered with fear and hatred in the locality for centuries after her death. On the other hand, the bequest in her will to distribute alms to six poor widows each Christmas suggests a kinder side to her nature. Death and legends He died in 1625 and was buried in the Church of St John the Baptist, Burford. His widow commissioned a magnificent memorial which was completed in 1628. True to her combative nature, she was said to have appropriated the north aisle of St John the Baptistto to hold the memorial, without seeking permission. He left his estates to his grandson, Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland. His only daughter Elizabeth had married Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland and became a writer and Catholic convert; this led to a breach with her father, and may explain his decision to leave his property to the next generation. Great Tew in the 1630s was the centre of a celebrated intellectual circle. The ghosts of Tanfield and his second wife have been reportedly sighted racing around Burford in a fiery coach bringing death to all who see them. This is testimony to the hatred they had aroused in their tenants during their lifetime: it is also said that for 200 years after Tanfield's death, he and his wife were burnt in effigy on his anniversary.

He sat in the House of Commons between 1779 and 1803. Early life He was born on 12 January 1754 the only son of William Fullarton of Fullarton, a wealthy Ayrshire gentleman. After spending some time at the University of Edinburgh he was sent to travel on the continent with Patrick Brydone, at one time the travelling tutor of William Beckford, and visited Sicily and Malta.'No. V. Patrick Brydone, Esq.', The Annual Biography and Obituary, Vol. 4 (1820), pp. 85-111, at p. 86 (Google). Fullarton was at first intended for the diplomatic service, and was attached as secretary to Lord Stormont's embassy in Paris; but on his accession to the family estates he went to England and secured his election to parliament for the borough of Plympton Erle in 1779. Military commander in India In the following year he did not seek re-election, for he had combined a plan of operations which the government accepted. This plan was that he and his intimate friend, Thomas Humberston Mackenzie, should each raise and equip a regiment on their Scottish estates at their own expense, which should be transported in government ships towards the coast of Mexico, in order to wait for and capture the Acapulco fleet. The regiments were accordingly raised, and Fullarton was gazetted lieutenant-colonel-commandant of the 98th regiment on 29 May 1780. The outbreak of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War changed the destination of these regiments, which were then ordered to form part of the expedition against the Cape of Good Hope under the command of Commodore George Johnstone and General William Medows. This plan also came to nothing, owing to the arrival of the French admiral, the Bailli de Suffren, at the Cape before the British expedition. The regiments then went on to India, to take their part in the Second Anglo-Mysore War against Haidar Ali. Mackenzie's regiment disembarked at Calicut, to make a diversion by invading Mysore from the Malabar coast, while Fullarton's went round to Madras. He remained in the neighbourhood of the capital of the presidency until after the Battle of Porto Novo, when he was sent south in command of the king's troops, in order if possible to attract the Mysore troops away from the Carnatic. In June 1782 Fullarton was gazetted a colonel in the army for the East Indies, with Sir Robert Barker, Norman Macleod, John Floyd, and many others, in order to put an end to the perpetual disputes between the king's and the company's officers, and he co-operated in the winter campaign of 1782‚Äì3 in the suppression of the Kollars, the fighting tribes of Madura, and in the capture of Karur and Dindigal. Fullarton led the Madras Army against the rebel Kattaboman, a palaiyakarar of Panchalum Kurucchi, a fortress town in present-day Tinnevelly District of Tamil Nadu. Fullarton's name is associated with the destruction of the fort of the rebel chieftain at Nettkelcheval, again in Tinnevelly District. In May 1783 he succeeded to the general command of all the troops south of the Coleroon, and on 2 June he took Dharapuram. He then advanced towards General James Stuart, who was besieging Cuddalore. On the news of the fall of that city, he determined to attack P√°lgh√°t, which had resisted all the efforts of Mackenzie in the previous year. He had to make his way through a dense forest. When he got through it, he had to storm the city. There, he heard that Tippoo Sultan, who had succeeded Haidar Ali on the throne, was not fulfilling the terms agreed to at the surrender of Mangalore, and Fullarton accordingly followed up his success by the capture of the fortress of Coimbatore. At this time, he was imperatively ordered to cease all hostilities by the government of Madras, and a sort of peace was patched up between the company and Tippoo Sahib. James Mill praised Fullarton as the first Anglo- Indian commander who looked after his commissariat and organised a system for obtaining intelligence of the enemy's strength and whereabouts. Fullarton returned to England, where he published his polemical tract A View of English Interests in India in 1787. This work, addressed to David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield (previously Lord Stormont), attacked the policies of the East India Company. Later life He then settled down to a country life, and married Marianne Mackay, daughter of George Mackay, 5th Lord Reay. He took an interest in agricultural questions, and published two memoirs on the state of agriculture in Ayrshire and the advantages of pasture land. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London and Royal Society of Edinburgh. He never again undertook service, but raised the 23rd, or Fullarton's dragoons, in 1794, and the 101st, or Fullarton's foot, in 1800, both of the regiments being reduced at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. He continued his parliamentary career, with a low profile, and sat for the Haddington Burghs from 1787 to 1790, for Horsham from 1793 to 1796, and for Ayrshire from 1796 to April 1803. He was appointed first commissioner for the government of the island of Trinidad. The commission appointed for Trinidad consisted of Fullarton, Captain Samuel Hood of the Royal Navy, and Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Picton, who had ruled the island since its capture by Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1797. When Fullarton asked for an account of all the criminal proceedings which had taken place in the island since Picton had been there, Picton resigned in disgust. Fullarton persisted in his inquiries, and the result of them was the trial of Picton for inflicting torture on a Spanish girl, Luisa Calderon, to extort a confession from her. This trial caused a public sensation in England. In February 1806, Picton was found guilty. Fullarton was attacked in print by Edward Alured Draper, as was John Sullivan. Fullarton's forename is there wrongly given. Picton applied for a new trial, at which he was acquitted; but before it started Fullarton died of inflammation of the lungs at Gordon's Hotel, London, on 13 February 1808. He was buried at Isleworth.

Education and career St√∏ren was born in Trysil, Hedmark county, Norway, the son of vicar Abraham Wilhelm St√∏ren and his wife Lagertha Johanne Diriksdatter. He had eleven siblings, including the brother Kristoffer St√∏ren and a first cousin of engineer Ragnvald St√∏ren. His first cousin Petter Johan Nicolay St√∏ren was the father of high-ranking Nazi civil servant Finn St√∏ren, making Johan and Finn first cousins once removed. He was sent to Kristiania Cathedral School at age 13, and took his examen artium in 1889. He then graduated from the Norwegian Military Academy in 1890 and from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.theol. degree in 1895. He studied in Germany from 1898 to 1899. He started his pastoral career in 1896 as curate serving under his vicar father in Meldal, not far from St√∏ren where his family originated. After the period in Germany, St√∏ren was vicar in Br√∏nn√∏y and Skjerstad between 1899 and 1901, seaman's priest in Leith, Scotland from 1901 to 1908 and then as a curate in Biri from 1908 to 1913. From 1913 he was the vicar of Tynset, and in August 1915 he was promoted to dean of √òsterdalen. There were tumultuous times for the church, with conservatives protesting the growing influence of liberals. St√∏ren was slightly on the conservative side, but was a compromise candidate for Bishop of the Diocese of H√•logaland in 1918. St√∏ren was originally the fourth-most favored candidate among the local clergy, but the favored candidate Johan Beronka was a pacifist Kven and therefore out of the question for the Council of State (who appointed bishops in Norway at that time), number two rejected the offer and number three was seen as too liberal. He was appointed in July and ordained in September 1918. He remained here until being appointed as the more prestigious Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros in 1928. St√∏ren was due to retire from old age in July 1941, but in October 1940 the authorities prolonged his term by one year. This was during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, which started in April 1940. On 24 February 1942 all bishops stepped down in protest against the Nazi regime. Five bishops including St√∏ren were fired in a meeting of 12 March 1942; St√∏ren was the only one who was allowed by the Nazis to keep his title and honorifics. After the end of the Nazi regime in May 1945, the new regime held that Nazi-instigated changes of office were illegal, but by Royal Resolution of 12 June 1945 St√∏ren was declared as retired since 12 March 1942. St√∏ren lived at Smestad in his later life, and died in November 1956. He outlived his wife Sophie Castberg (1875‚Äì1952), whom he had married in October 1899 in Kristiania. His wife was a second cousin once removed of Johan Christian Tandberg Castberg and third cousin of Torgrim and Johan Castberg.Cf. the genealogy page for Sophie Castberg References Category:1871 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Bishops of Nidaros Category:Bishops of H√•logaland Category:20th-century Lutheran bishops Category:Norwegian Military Academy alumni Category:University of Oslo alumni Category:Norwegian expatriates in Germany Category:Norwegian people of World War II ","title":"Johan Nicolai St√∏ren"},{"id":"26891042","text":"Podkraj () is a settlement in the hills south of Velike La≈°ƒçe in central Slovenia.

He worked as a soloist within both the classical and jazz repertoires from the 1950s through the early 1970s, notably appearing in concerts with the Duke Ellington Orchestra, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, and the San Diego Symphony. Between 1971 and 1983 he mainly focused on his work as a composer and teacher, making only periodic public performances. In 1984 he resumed actively performing when he formed \\"Freddie's Band\\", a jazz ensemble in residence at The Music Gallery in Toronto. He performed with this group up until his death two years later. Life Born in Toronto, Ontario, Stone was the son of saxophonist Archie Stone who was the orchestra leader of Toronto's Casino Theatre from 1936 to 1960. His initial musical studies were with his father. At the age of 14 he began studying the trumpet with Donald Reinhardt in Philadelphia, spending every summer in that city from 1950‚Äì1955. In his native city he studied music theory and music composition with Gordon Delamont (1955‚Äì60) and John Weinzweig (1960‚Äì1962). Stone began his performance career in 1951 at the age of 16 playing in Benny Louis's big band. From 1955 to 1967 he was a trumpeter in various orchestras related to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, including the CBC Symphony Orchestra. During the late 1950s and 1960s he performed widely as a concert soloist with orchestras throughout North America. He also performed actively as a jazz musician, playing regularly with such artists as Ron Collier (1960‚Äì73), Phil Nimmons (1965‚Äì70), the Boss Brass (1968‚Äì70), and Lighthouse (1969‚Äì70). In 1970‚Äì71 he toured North America and Europe with the Duke Ellington Orchestra. After returning to Toronto in 1971, Stone became highly involved with his work as a teacher and his performance career virtually ceased for the remainder of the decade; although he remained active as a composer. He was appointed artist-in- residence at Centennial College, where he taught classes from 1972 to 1973. He was also appointed to the music faculty at Humber College in 1972, where he taught through 1975. In 1976 he joined the faculty of George Brown College (GBC), where he taught for just one year. He also taught at the Blue Mountain School of Music, a school affiliated with the GBC. From 1977 until his death in Toronto in 1986, Stone ran his own private studio where he taught improvisational theory and music composition. His only performances in the mid- to late 1970s were periodic ones with small jazz ensembles whose members consisted mainly of his students.

The park's terrain includes large alpine meadows, vertical rock faces, precipices and dense forests. The most area of land is covered by forests and was established in 1966 to protect several ecosystems and biodiversity of national importance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the park as Category II. The region has been recognised as an important Bird and Plant Area, because it support significant numbers of various bird and plant species. The park features outstanding diversity with the landscape ranging from the alpine peaks of the Ceraunian Mountains covered with snow in winter to the sunny Albanian Ionian Sea Coast in summer. At , the Llogara Pass provides a striking scenery, with tall mountains overlooking the Albanian Riviera and several islands in the sea. The region experiences a mediterranean climate. This means that the summers are hot and the winters generally dry to warm to cool. Despite the vicinity to the mediterranean climatic region, an alpine climate prevails at the Maja e √áik√´s. Geomorphologically, carbonate rocks occupy most of the area, while the mountains are composed of limestones and dolomites. Phytogeographically, the park falls within the Illyrian deciduous forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. Its flora is diverse and characterized with high endemism, due to the combination of southern geographic latitude and high altitude variation. The forests are composed of diverse deciduous and coniferous species among other by bosnian pine, black pine, bulgarian fir, silver fir, ash trees, kermes oak and other species. Air currents that flow through the area have caused trees to bend in many interesting shapes, such as the Pisha e Flamurit. The vertebrate fauna consists of a wide range of species. Among the species of highest conservation value are the griffon vulture, golden eagle, rock partridge, fallow deer, roe deer, european wildcat, chamois, red squirrel, otter, wolf and red fox. Tourism is the most important sector in the park and has the largest potential to be a source for sustainable income. Along the National Road 8 there are several restaurants, hotels, and a small wooden cabin complex. The area of the park and the surrounding mountains are used mainly for hiking and tracking tours. A paragliding site serving annually as the 9th FAI World Paragliding Accuracy Championship venue is located south of the park. Along the twisting road are several local vendors of honey and mountain tea. Caesar's Pass, named after Julius Caesar who marched down near the area in pursuit of Pompey, is also located nearby the Llogara Pass.

It lies mostly between latitudes 40¬∞ and 12¬∞ N and longitudes 19¬∞ and 34¬∞ E. The park comprises in Vlor√´ County in southwestern Albania along the Ionian Sea. The park's elevation vary between up to above the Adriatic. Due to the close proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, the sea has an significant effect on the climate of the region. The park enjoys a mediterranean climate with subtropical influences, with moderate rainy and dry winters and warm to hot summers. Its mean monthly temperature ranges between in January and in July. The mean annual precipitation ranges between and depending on geographic region and prevailing climate type. The Ceraunian Mountains stretching along the Ionian Sea. Llogara, a mountain pass that rises to an elevation of between Maja e √áik√´s and Maja e Gjipalit, is the watershed between the Adriatic Sea in the north and the Ionian Sea in the south. The pass lies on a tectonic uplift line of two tectonic zones that of Sazan on the southwest and that of Jonike on the northeast. It leads the Dukat Valley to the southern end of Vlora Bay close to Orikum. To the south, the pass is very rugged and steep, falling down into the Ionian Sea, whose coast is only three kilometers away, but more than below. Moreover, to the south the pass opens and offers impressive views over the Albanian Riviera. that of Sazani on the southwest and that of Jonike on the northeast. SH8 leads from Vlor√´ over the Llogara Pass through the Albanian Riviera at Dh√´rmi to Sarand√´. Geologically, like most of the mountains in the region, Llogara is made up of carbonic and flysch deposits from the Mesozoic and Paleozoic period. Rising on the Ceraunian Mountains, the pass separates the mountain chain into two chains, with Reza e Kanalit, also known as the Akroceraunian Mountains, encompassing the western portion within the Karaburun Peninsula. The highest peaks of the Ceraunian Mountains are Maja e √áik√´s standing at and Maja e Qorres standing at descending towards the Llogara Pass. Reza e Kanalit is about long and about wide.  Biodiversity  Like most of the Albanian coast along the Adriatic and Ionian Sea, Llogara belongs to one of the most significant areas of the country, specifically due to climatic conditions and on the other hand due to the topography of this area.

Life Sabeata (also written Xaviata) was born after 1640 at Las Humanas, the Tompiro Pueblo now called Gran Quivira. Sabeata later made his way to the city of Parral in northern Mexico. There, he was baptized a Catholic as an adult and given the Christian name of Juan. When he first came to prominence in 1683 he was a leader of the Jumano Indians and their allies. Sabeata apparently did not speak Spanish well as he communicated through an interpreter.Hickerson, Nancy Parrott, The Jumanos: Hunters and Traders of the South Plains. Austin: U of Texas Press, 1994, 107, 128 Meeting with the Spanish In 1683, the Spanish on the northern frontier were vulnerable. The Pueblo Revolt of 1680, led by Popay, resulted in more than 400 Spanish deaths and their expulsion from New Mexico. The 2,000 survivors retreated to El Paso, Texas Thus, when a delegation of friendly Indians, headed by Sabeata, came to El Paso in October 1683 the Spanish were welcoming. Sabeata said that he lived at La Junta, the junction of the Rio Grande and Conchos rivers near the present day town of Presidio, Texas. He said he had been sent by several Indian nations to request that the Spanish establish Christian missions in their territory. He also requested Spanish aid to the Jumanos and their allies against the depredations of the Apaches. The majority of his tribe, he explained, lived eastward from La Junta and were menaced by the Apache who lived nearby. Sabeata said that the Jumanos had good trade relations with 36 different tribes. Among those he named which can be identified are the Tejas, the Caddoan tribe that would give the state of Texas its name. Moreover, Sabeata mentioned that \\"other Spaniards\\"‚Äîmeaning the French‚Äîwere trading with the TejasHickerson, 128-130 It was a masterful performance by Sabeata to excite Spanish interest in a potential harvest of souls among the Jumanos and their allies and to create Spanish concern about French encroachments on what they believed was Spanish territory. Sabeata went on to cement the interest of the Spanish by telling of a battle won by the Jumanos because of a cross that descended from heaven to protect them. He sent representatives to measure the church in El Paso, promising to build two similar churches at La Junta.Hickerson, 131 The Dominguez de Mendoza Expedition In response to Sabeata's petitition, three Spanish priests and a large delegation of Indians left El Paso for La Junta where they found that the seven or more tribes clustered there had in fact built churches and houses for the missionaries. The priests were followed by 20 Spanish soldiers led by Captain Juan Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza. On January 1, 1684 the soldiers reunited with the priests and with Sabeata and a large number of Indians the expedition left for the land of the Jumanos. It proved to be considerably more than six days away. On January 17, the expedition arrived at a settlement of the Cibolo Indians on the Pecos River, probably downstream from present day Pecos, Texas. Juan Sabeata had gone ahead to prepare the Indians to welcome the Spanish and they did so in grand style, firing several guns, including an arquebus fired by Sabeata himself‚Äîin violation of a Spanish prohibition against Indians owning guns.Hickerson, 135-136 Sabeata and the Indians then persuaded a reluctant Dominguez de Mendoza to assist them against the Apaches. The expedition, shepherded by large numbers of Indians, continued their march, now moving eastward toward the Concho River and sending out patrols to look for Apaches. It appears that they saw no Apaches in the flesh, but several horses were stolen during an Apache raid. One of the interesting things in the narrative is that the Jumano owned horses at this time‚Äîone of the earlier mentions in the Spanish records of mounted Indians in the United States.Hickerson, 139 Relations between Dominguez and Sabeata deteriorated. On February 19, he accused Sabeata of lying about the threat posed of the Apaches. At the same time Sabeata had probably become aware that the Spanish were more interested in bison hunting than fighting Apaches or spreading the gospel of Christianity. Sabeata departed the expedition along with some of the Jumano Indians, although many of the Indians remained with Dominguez. The Spanish and the remaining Indians continued their exploration eastward. Their route seems to have been down the Middle Fork of the Concho past the present day San Angelo, Texas to the Colorado River where they camped for almost two months to hunt bison. Their campsite may have been near present day Ballinger, Texas. During the expedition, the Spanish and their Indian colleagues killed 5,156 bison, the Spanish carefully preserving the skins to sell on their return to New Mexico. The priests baptized hundreds of Indians.Hickerson, 141; Bolton, Herbert Eugene, Spanish Exploration in the Southwest, 1541-1706. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1916, 338 Sabeata's assessment of the threat of the Apaches was apparently accurate, as the Spanish camp was raided on several occasions. A Spanish soldier was wounded and two Indians were killed. Mendoza, however, in his written account accused Sabeata of plotting to kill the Spanish and stated that he was in ill repute with the Indians. However, the opposite would seem to have been true as a grand council of Indian tribes planned by the Spanish never took place. Most of the Indians who accompanied Mendoza seem to have departed and he feared an Apache attack. It was a much depleted group that broke camp in May and returned quickly to El Paso‚Äîalong with thousands of valuable bison skins.Bolton, 338-343  Looking for an Ally With the failure of his effort to get the Spanish involved in a useful manner in contesting the Apache advances onto the southern Great Plains, Sabeata turned to the French. La Salle had just established a colony in eastern Texas and in 1686 a Jumano leader, probably Sabeata, met with the French, declared himself an enemy of the Spanish, and requested French assistance against the Apache. The failure of the La Salle mission precluded this request from being granted.Hickerson, 174 Sabeata's activities included trading. With contacts both in the Indian and Spanish world, he and the Jumanos were intermediaries, bringing Spanish goods to Indians in eastern Texas, and exchanging them for Indian products, mostly buffalo hides. There were well-organized trade fairs all over Texas which no doubt pre-dated the Spanish.Hickerson, 189 In 1688, the wide-ranging traveler was back at La Junta. He was appointed a governor of the Indians there by the Spanish, his altercations with Mendoza apparently forgotten. Juan de Retana was ordered to collect a force of 90 Spanish harquebusiers and Indian allies and expel the French from east Texas. Sabeata was ordered to collect the Indian allies and await the arrival of the Spanish force at La Junta. Retana was the commander of the presidio at San Francisco de Conchos near the headwaters of the Conchos River. On his march northward he decided to attack the Toboso people who were fighting against the Spanish primarily in reaction to slaving raids.Elizabeth John, Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds: The Confrontation of Indians, Spanish and French in the Southwest, 1540-1795 (College Station: Texas A&M; University Press, 1975), p. 182 When Sabeata got the news that Retana was delayed, he decided to go contact the French on his own. departed La Junta, carried out his own reconnaissance, and was able to report to Retana that the French settlement in eastern Texas had been destroyed by Indians and most of the French killed, only eight or nine survivors living among the Tejas.Hickerson, 186-190 Four or five of the Frenchmen requested to go with Sabeata to the Spanish settlements, and they went with him for three days. However they decided the group might be attacked by Coahuiltecans, and lacking the courage of Sabeata, they turned back. They did give Sabeata two pages torn from their books and a parchment painting of a ship to show the Spanish they were really French.John, Storms Brewed, p. 183-184 Sabeata appears again in the Spanish records in 1690 when a Spanish priest working in newly established Spanish mission among the Hasinai (Caddo) in east Texas asked him to carry a letter to Spanish authorities in El Paso and a year later he carried two more letters to the Governor of Coahuila. The letters requested that soldiers be assigned to the missions to protect them from the French.Hickerson, 182-184 It appears that Sabeata, the Jumanos, and other Indian tribes now spent the winters living on the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass, Texas and summers hunting buffalo in the Texas Hill Country near the Guadalupe River, apparently pushed out of their homeland along the Concho River further north. Sabeata also apparently made frequent visits to Spanish authorities in El Paso and Parral.Bolton, Herbert E. \\"The Jumano Indians in Texas, 1650-1771. Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Vol 15, No. 1, http://www.tshaonline.org/publications/journals/shq/online/v015/n1/article_3_print.html, accessed Apr 10, 2010 In 1691, a Spanish expedition visited an encampment, estimated to number 3,000, of Jumanos and other tribes on the Guadalupe River. Sabeata organized a welcome that included a procession featuring a wooden cross (presumably the same that had descended from Heaven to assist the Jumanos in a battle with the Apaches a decade earlier). The chief of the Cibola tribe and his people displayed an image of the Our Lady of Guadalupe and the chef of the Catqueasa, who spoke good Spanish, kissed the hand of the Priest in Catholic fashion. It was \\"a splendid show of piety and devotion\\" and Sabeata followed up with a request once again that a Spanish mission be established among his people. The Spanish demurred saying the Jumano visited Spanish settlements yearly and had no need of missions among them. The Spanish detected an undercurrent of hostility among the Indians and declined to remain encamped with them.Hickerson 184-185 In 1692, Sabeata organized a campaign against the Chisos Indians who had attacked the Indians at La Junta. This is the last notice of him in the Spanish records. He may have died or been killed in 1692 or 1693. Importance Sabeata is one of the few Indians who emerges from the myopic Spanish records as an individual. His appeals to the Spanish (and the French) to protect the Jumanos from their enemies failed. He lived at a time when the Spanish were weak and in retreat on their northern frontier and had few resources to extend their control beyond a few towns. Much of what we know about the Texas Indians during this time comes from Sabeata filtered through the lens of the Spanish. He is known to have crisscrossed Texas on at least eight occasions and to have made numerous visits to El Paso, Parral, and other Spanish settlements in Texas and Mexico. He was accepted not only as a leader of the Jumanos, but also as a spokesman for the numerous Tonkawa, Caddoan, and Coahuiltecan bands and tribes that inhabited southern and central Texas. With the disappearance of Sabeata from the historical record in 1692, the Jumanos also soon disappeared. In 1716, the Jumanos again appear in the Spanish records, but as allies of the former enemies, the Apaches, and in 1771 comes the last mention of them as an independent people.Bolton, http://www.tshaonline.org/publications/journals/shq/online/v015/n1/article_3_print.html, accessed Apr 10, 2010  References  External links  Category:17th- century Native Americans Category:1640s births Category:1690s deaths Category:Native American leaders Category:Native American history of Texas ","title":"Juan Sabeata"},{"id":"26891160","text":"The British Association for Screen Entertainment (BASE) is a video home entertainment organisation established in 1980 as the British Video Association (BVA).

Early life and background De Froment was born in Ch√¢teauroux, in the garrison town of his father. His father was a graduate of the Saint-Cyr military academies who had been killed leading his company in Artois in May 1915. De Froment enrolled at Saint-Cyr and, after a standard beginning to his career, in 1939 he was sent on as special mission to Poland, where he was present for the debacle. He returned to France and, in May 1940, took part in operations to block the German army which had crossed the Meuse river.  Resistance (1940-1943) After the French army's defeat, de Froment met Captain Henri Frenay in Marseille towards the beginning of September 1940. Frenay was engaged in forming an embryonic resistance movement, which became Combat, the most important movement in the zone libre. Frenay made de Froment his representative in the occupied zone. It was de Froment's responsibility to create a massive information network in the north, assigned directly to passing on clandestine news which Frenay intended would inform the general population and promote a spirit of resistance. Along with Frenay, Robert Gu√©don and Jacques-Yves Mulliez, de Froment was involved in the creation of the newspaper Les Petites Ailes de France, which was first circulated on 17 May 1941. Towards the beginning of February 1942, Combat Zone Nord, the group led by Gu√©don and to which de Froment was attached, was scourged by a wave of arrests. Greatly isolated, de Froment nonetheless continued to expand his network in industrial and railway circles across the whole of the zone occup√©e.  Deportation (1943-1945) On 14 January 1943, de Froment, whose hideout had been spotted by a treacherous comrade, was arrested by two men from the Abwehr. He was imprisoned in Fresnes prison and, in summer 1934, deported to Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria. In May 1945, the camp was liberated by Americans. Terribly weakened, de Froment reached France and recuperated in the sanatorium at Brian√ßon where, in 1946, he transcribed the history of his deportation to Mauthausen. Published in 2004, it is a text infused with fervent Christian humanism.  After the war  *1947: Reintegrated into the French army. *1953: √âcole sup√©rieure de guerre.

Laval Ltd posted Latvian workers to Sweden to work on site. These workers earned much less than comparable Swedish workers. The Swedish Building Workers' Union (Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet) asked Laval Ltd to sign its collective agreement. This collective agreement would have been more favourable than the terms required to protect posted workers under the Posted Workers Directive, and also contained a clause for setting pay that would not allow Laval Ltd to determine in advance what the pay would be. Laval Ltd refused to sign the collective agreement. The Swedish Builders Union, supported by the Electricians Union called a strike to blockade Laval Ltd's building sites. As a result, Laval Ltd could not do business in Sweden. It claimed that the blockade infringed its right to free movement of services under TEC article 49 (now TFEU article 56). The Swedish court referred the matter to the ECJ. Judgment The ECJ held that, following ITWF v Viking Lines ABP, the \\"right to take collective action for the protection of the workers of the host state against possible social dumping may constitute an overriding reason of public interest\\" which could justify an infringement of free movement of services. However, in this case, it did not, because the systems for Sweden's collective bargaining was felt to be not \\"sufficiently precise and accessible\\" for the company to know its obligations in advance. Significance The case was roundly condemned by labour and human rights lawyers throughout the European Union. After the onset of the economic crisis, in the 2009 Lindsey Oil Refinery strikes, the issue of posted workers triggered a significant amount of unrest, with police equipping themselves with riot gear in response to wildcat strikes over posted workers in the United Kingdom. In Sweden, the Labour Court sentenced the two trade unions to pay 550,000 Swedish kronor (‚Ç¨65,700) in so-called general damages plus interest and legal costs to Laval‚Äôs bankruptcy estate. The International Labour Organization‚Äôs Committee of Experts every year investigates member countries‚Äô reports on how they implement the ILO‚Äôs conventions, in this case convention 87 on the freedom of association and protection of the right to organise. In 2013 the Committee of Experts criticised the changes made in Sweden after the EU Court of Justice ruling.

National Assembly of Pakistan on April 8, 2010,NA passes 18th Amendment Bill, PM felicitate the Nation , Associated Press of Pakistan, 2010-04-08 removing the power of the President of Pakistan to dissolve the Parliament unilaterally, turning Pakistan from a semi- presidential to a parliamentary republic, and renaming North-West Frontier Province to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The package was intended to counter the sweeping powers amassed by the presidency under former presidents General Pervez Musharraf and General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq and to ease political instability in Pakistan.Pakistan Weighs Changes to Revise Constitution, The New York Times, 2010-04-06 The bill reversed many infringements on the Constitution of Pakistan over several decades by its military rulers. The amendment bill was passed by the Senate of Pakistan on April 15, 2010 and it became an act of parliament when President Asif Ali Zardari put his signature on the bill on April 19, 2010. It was the first time in Pakistan's history that a president relinquished a significant part of his powers willingly and transferred them to parliament and the office of the prime minister. Background The power of the president to dissolve the Parliament was enacted by the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan during the presidency of Gen. Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, before it was removed by then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif during his second term by the Thirteenth Amendment. It was finally restored during the presidency of Gen. Pervez Musharraf by the Seventeenth Amendment. This bill is the first bill since 1973 to decrease the powers of the president. Back then, this amounted to the only democratically elected parliament to fully complete its tenure in the history of Pakistan from 2003‚Äì2008, albeit under Musharraf. The second complete parliamentary term was completed by the PPP led government from 20082013 which had in fact passed the 18th Amendment. However, this 20082013 term is often touted to be the first complete democratic change of power without a military president or a coup de etat in Pakistan. Changes to the Constitution Some new features were also introduced into the constitution, including the following: * The name of the former president of Pakistan, Gen Zia ul haq, has been removed from the text of Constitution * Sarhad (Border) Province has been renamed Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa * The 17th Amendment and Legal Framework Order as introduced by Musharraf has been repealed * The ban on third time prime ministership and chief ministership has been lifted * Holding constitution in abeyance is tantamount to high treason * The Council of Common Interests (CCI) has been reconstituted with the prime minister as its chairperson and the body should meet at least once in 90 days * A judicial commission will recommend the appointment procedure of superior judges and the final names of judges will be decided by parliamentary commission * A Chief Election Commissioner will be appointed through consensus between treasury and opposition * Establishment of Islamabad high court and benches of high courts in Mingora and Turbat * Recognition of the children's right to education and insertion of a new section under Article 25A to provide constitutional guarantee that state will provide free and compulsory education to all girls and boys up to age 16. * The power to dissolve the parliament was withdrawn from the President. Impact 292 of the 342 members of the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, voted in favour of the amendment. The amendment turns the President into a ceremonial head of state and transfers power to the Prime Minister,Pakistani National Assembly Votes to Limit Presidential Powers, Voice of America, 2010-04-08 and removes the limit on a Prime Minister serving more than two terms, opening the way for Nawaz Sharif to run again. The North-West Frontier Province is renamed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in accordance with the wishes of its Pashtun-majority population. Among other changes, courts will no longer be able to endorse suspensions of the constitution, a judicial commission will appoint judges, and the president will no longer be able to appoint the head of the Election Commission.Pakistan's national assembly passes key constitutional reforms, The Sunday Telegraph, 2010-04-08 The bill also enhances provincial autonomy.Constitution bill sent to Senate, Dawn (newspaper), 2010-04-10 The President will no longer be able to declare emergency rule in any province unilaterally.Pakistan parliament agrees to curb presidential powers, BBC, 2010-04-08 Devolved Ministries The following ministries were devolved at federal level and were given to the provinceshttps://tribune.com.pk/story/1685835/1-pm-decides-fate-38000-govt- employees/. According to 18th Amendment : # Ministry of Education became Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training # Ministry of Archaeology and Culture became Ministry of Culture # Ministry of environment became Ministry of Climate Change # Ministry of health became Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination # Ministry of special initiatives abolished at federal level. # Ministry of labour and manpower became Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis & Human Resource Development # Ministry of local government and rural development abolished at federal level. # Ministry of minorities‚Äô affairs merged with the Ministry of Religious Affairs # Ministry of population welfare abolished at federal level. # Ministry of social welfare and special education abolished at federal level. # Ministry of sports became Pakistan Sports Board at federal level and given to provinces. # Ministry of tourism's powers given to Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation # Ministry of women development abolished at federal level. # Ministry of youth affairs abolished at federal level. # Ministry of Zakat and Ushr abolished at federal level given to provinces. Response Ahmed Kurd, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan, said \\"We fully support the 18th Amendment. It is tantamount to the overhauling of the constitution, which had been subverted by military dictators since its inception. In the past, parliaments have just been 'rubber stamps', whereas the present parliament seemed to be well aware of its obligations, and therefore, was 'throwing out' the 'unconstitutional' amendments.\\"Lawyers' majority endorses 18th Amendment, Daily Times (Pakistan), 2010-04-08 ReferencesExternal links *Text of the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010 on pakistani.org Category:2010 in law Category:2010 in Pakistan 18 ","title":"Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan"},{"id":"26891268","text":"Rutherford is an unincorporated community in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States.

A member of the House of DrƒÉcule»ôti, he was the son of Radu Paisie.  Reign  At the Porte's command, he goes with his army in Transylvania (1556) to restore John Sigismund who, together with his mother, Queen Isabella, had to withdraw to Poland. 14,000 soldiers flee the Carpathians, one in May, the other in July, and the great saint Socol brings the queen from Lvov. On 28 October, PƒÉtra≈ücu himself was in Cluj, satisfied with the result - (to which Mr. Moldovan, Alexandru LƒÉpu≈üneanu). As silence was not yet fully restored, a new action was needed in Transylvania. Patrascu could not accompany the armies: he was ill - he was in May at Ramnic, for the air, and a doctor sent by Sibiu. On 26 of December 1557 he died. Some say that the voivode would have been poisoned even by the great governor Socol who wanted to become a ruler: that was not proven. However, it is certain that Socol, when Mircea the Shepherd returned, retreat with his son, Radu stolnic to Transylvania and took with him the coffers of the deceased: 400, 00 ducats. (Later, he promised 14,000 ducats to the Ambassador of France in Istanbul, only not be surrendered to Turks and then, killed). He governed in 1545-1557.  Family  His wife was named Voica. a descendant of the boyars from SlƒÉtioare. They had a daughter Maria (married in February 1555) and three sons: Peter, who was later called 'Cercel'. Some historians consider Petru Cercel, (who ruled Wallachia 1583 to 1588), to have been the son of PƒÉtra»ôcu. Michael the Brave, who ruled Wallachia 1593‚Äì1601, is considered by most historians to have been a son of PƒÉtra»ôcu, while others believe that he invented his descent in order to justify his rule. The two alleged sons were painted together at an inner wall of a church at Caluiu. According to official chronicles of Mihai Voda, he would have had a postum and illegitimate son Mihai Viteazul, which was denied by newer historiography, starting with Nicolae Iorga.  Death  On 24 December 1557 PƒÉtra≈ücu died in unclear circumstances in Bucharest. Some historians suggest that the Voivode might have died as a result of poisoning even by the great saint Socol, who had himself thoughts of his own: it is not proven. It is only a matter of fact that Socol, when Mircea Ciobanul returns, takes refuge with his son, Radu stolnic, in Transylvania, taking with him the coffers of the deceased: 400,000 ducats. (Later promises 14,000 ducats to the ambassador of France in Istanbul, only to be taught to the Turks and killed). His domination was between 1545 and 1557. VintilƒÉ installed by the army of John Voda the Brave in 1574 (but only four days) and Petrascu, from CyprusIorga, 1940 PƒÉtra»ôcu was buried at Dealu Monastery.

Nelson is an American businessman who is the former CEO of Intermountain Health Care. He received his B.S. in accounting from the Marriott School of Management, Brigham Young University, in 1967. He was also the first recipient of the National Healthcare Leadership Award. William H. Nelson served as the president and chief executive officer of Intermountain Healthcare, an integrated nonprofit healthcare system with 160 healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics and an insurance organization, from 1999 until his retirement in early 2009. Nationally acclaimed Intermountain Healthcare is the largest healthcare provider in the intermountain west, with over 33,000 employees serving the needs of Utah and southeastern Idaho residents. Nelson also served as the chief operating officer of Intermountain Healthcare from 1995 to 1998 and as the chief financial officer from 1976 to 1995. He has served on the boards of the Utah Symphony & Opera, Beneficial Life Insurance, United Way of the Greater Salt Lake Area and the Healthcare Research and Development Institute. Nelson received his Bachelor of Science in Accounting from Brigham Young University and his MBA from the University of Southern California. Nelson is a somewhat accidental health-system executive. He was born in Cedar City, raised in California, where surfing was a daily delight, and attended Brigham Young University, where he met his wife-to-be, Christine Miles. He earned his degree in accounting, then did graduate work at the University of Southern California, before serving an LDS Church mission to Italy. He also earned an MBA. He became an accountant at Ernst & Ernst in Los Angeles, grabbed from the bullpen to do whatever needed to be done until one of the partners decided it might be a good idea to form a group that would deal exclusively with health care, which is complicated. He joined that team \\"because I liked the other people\\" who were part of it. Four years later, Nelson started working on the accounts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was getting ready to divest itself of hospitals in Utah and Idaho. Nelson was assigned to the divestiture and moved to the accounting firm's Salt Lake office in 1974, where he worked closely with representatives from the church. When the newly formed Intermountain Health Care (it has since changed the name to make Healthcare one word) needed a chief financial officer, he applied. And that began a long career with Intermountain that would take the young man, 29 when he came on board, to the pinnacle of the organization. Were he keeping score, he says, his career has had more high points than lows. He's received prestigious awards and Intermountain has been honored a number of times as an example of a well-run health-care system. Among his favorite honors is a national study that says if the care and cost in three areas ‚Äî Rochester, N.Y.; Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore. ‚Äî could be replicated nationwide, Americans would save $35 billion and the outcomes for patients would be significantly better. After retiring from Intermountain Healthcare in 2009, Nelson served as a mission president over the New York New York South Mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints from 2009 to 2012.

Descendants have been known for military achievement, business success, philanthropy, and broad social activism spanning such causes as abolition of slavery, treatment of the insane and alcoholics, family planning, and innovative employee programs. The family fortune was initially generated through large-scale farming across multiple land holdings in Narragansett Country, Rhode Island. This work was primarily done with the unpaid labor of dozens of enslaved black people. Eventually, the business interests evolved and the family wealth largely came from its textile manufacturing business at Peace Dale, Rhode Island, mining, railroad, and chemical interests, including the Solvay Process Company.

The family has been known especially for social concerns such as abolition of slavery, treatment of the insane and of alcoholics, as well for innovative employee programs. Guild Hall, built in 1890 by the Solvay Process Company to serve as a community center, provided the first public library facility which served the high school as well. Guild Hall was the first of five such buildings the company constructed for health and recreational use of the entire community. The family's Peace Dale textile manufacturing company was one of the first in America (1878) to distribute a percentage of profits to employees. Mrs. Frederick R. Hazard (Dora G. Sedgwick) of Solvay was daughter of the prominent Syracuse lawyer and abolitionist Charles B. Sedgwick. The Sedgwick residence was a landmark designed by important American architect, Alexander Jackson Davis. Dora Sedgwick Hazard was an early American proponent of family planning, an organizer in central New York of the National Women's Party, and of programs for African-American young people (which evolved into the Dunbar Center). Mrs. Hazard founded the Solvay Guild in 1887 and was instrumental in establishing its many local programs in areas of education, public health medical and dental clinics, day care center, sewing, cooking and Americanization classes, and the first kindergartens not merely in Solvay but in Syracuse. The Hazard Branch of the Onondaga County Library System contains a memorial plaque recalling the public service of Dora Sedgwick Hazard. The Hazard family has been culturally oriented. Historic artifacts collected by Rowland G. Hazard II (1855‚Äì1918) became the Museum of Primitive Culture Records at Peace Dale, The family commissioned architects to design their projects. Douglas Smyth designed the company headquarters (1888) and probably designed nearby Guild Hall (1890), both of which are now razed. Notable homes Upland Farm, the Frederick R. Hazard residence built in 1899; Joseph Lyman Silsbee, architectThe Hazards contributed land and resources for the Village of Solvay to grow. The residential neighborhood of Piercefield was developed as Upland Farm, the Hazard estate. The landmark Hazard mansion, designed by the nationally distinguished architect, Joseph Lyman Silsbee (1848‚Äì1913), unfortunately was demolished about the time of World War II. Silsbee also designed a fine residence and carriage house for Solvay Process Company engineer Edward N. Trump (1889), extant at 1912 West Genesee Street, Syracuse. Trump was one of the first company engineers, hired in 1882. Silsbee is well known for his landmark Syracuse Savings Bank building on Clinton Square, Syracuse. After moving his practice to Chicago, Silsbee employed the major American architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. Two architecturally notable homes of Hazard daughters remain nearby in Piercefield, the Edwin Witherby House, c. 1912 (515 North Orchard Road) and the Martin Knapp House, 1910 (404 Piercefield Drive) Taylor and Bonta, architects, New York City. They were also architects of the University Club (extant, Washington Street on Fayette Park) and YWCA building (East Onondaga Street, demolished), both in Syracuse, New York. Offspring and Marriages Dorothy Hazard and husband Edwin Chaplin Witherby had three children: Constance Witherby, Thomas Hazard Witherby, and Frederick Roland Hazard Witherby, all born at Solvay. Edwin Chaplin Witherby died at Boston. Dorothy Hazard remarried at Narragansett, Rhode Island and with second husband, Stephen Foster Hunt, had a daughter, Deborah Hunt. Sarah Hazard and husband Martin Hobart Knapp moved from Solvay to Cazenovia, New York There were four Knapp children: Robert Hazard Knapp, Peter Hobart Knapp, Sarah Knapp Auchincloss, Judith Knapp. Hazard family houses at Upland Farm, Piercefield in the Village of Solvay appear in that article.

Located adjacent to the Southport Lighthouse on Simmons Island in downtown Kenosha. The Kenosha Yacht Club is a member of US Sailing, Lake Michigan Yacht Racing Association, Lake Michigan Sail Racing Federation, and the Regional Sailing Association.  Kenosha Community Sailing Center  The Kenosha Community Sailing Center (KCSC)] is a collaborative effort between the Kenosha Yacht Club, local organizations and schools. Its goal is to educate Kenosha youth in the sport of sailing while integrating academic, leadership and life skills. The KCSC also promotes awareness of, and access to, the Kenosha Harbor and Lake Michigan's resources and environment for people of all ages through the sport of sailing. Kenosha's lake front is one of the most boater friendly on the great lakes.  History  The Kenosha Yacht Club is one of the oldest organizations in Kenosha and was originally chartered in 1912. According to the best records that can be found, the first commodore was Buck Ferry. In February 1918, a Mr. Peterson deeded all the land south of the Coast Guard headquarters and east to the lakeshore to the KYC. A building formerly used by the Jackson Lumber co. was sold to the KYC and moved to the site to serve as headquarters. However, in April 1921 the land was returned to Peterson who lost it to the City of Kenosha in November of that year. Little is known of the KYC from 1921 until 1932 when it was incorporated under Commodore Alex Werner. Alex Werner remained commodore for that year and then was re-elected for the years 1940 through 1943, the year the club was re-chartered. From 1932 through 1946 the club met in the old Morgan Boat House. This building was erected in the early 1900s to serve as the Lake Michigan Base for J.P. Morgan‚Äôs steam yachts. In 1946 the Club was evicted from the boathouse and the building was to be torn down to make room for additional coal docks. After an extension of time, a club committee negotiated with the city for the site where the club stands today. They received a 20-year lease from the city and planned to move the boathouse to the site. However, before this could be accomplished, the boathouse burned down. The insurance company paid the club $1800.00 for the boathouse fire damage. The KYC was given until April 1947 to tear down and remove the old building. Throughout the winter of ‚Äô46 the members managed to dismantle and save a large amount of lumber from the old boathouse. This lumber was moved to the new site in preparation for the new clubhouse. In May 1947 the footings for the current clubhouse were poured and reconstruction began. With the help of the insurance money, walls, a roof, and a few permanent doors were added. A contractor erected the concrete blocks, but club members did much of the work themselves. It was a long process since it was necessary to complete the building piecemeal. As a few dollars were gathered, special meetings were called to determine what improvements deserved first consideration. The taproom was built first as it would help bring in needed money. The club did not keep a record of the members who put forth effort to create the club on Lake Michigan. Nels Nelson and Earl Nehls were the carpenter contractors who supervised and worked on the project. In 1952 the club purchased a stiff leg derrick which allowed the storing of boats on the club grounds. Membership grew, as did the fleet. During 1965, under the leadership of Commodore Cleve Ward, major changes were made at the club. The changes included a new entrance and foyer, a completely new galley, a remodeled dining room, and relocation of the rest rooms. All this was made possible by negotiating a long term lease extension from the city. Other changes have occurred since then. The flagpole and plaque were installed during 1971‚Äì1972 under the leadership of Commodore Ed Werner. The bar, previously in the shape of a boat‚Äôs flaring bow and located in the middle of the clubhouse was replaced in 1972‚Äì1973 with the bar that exists today. The folding partitions replaced a permanent wall in 1975‚Äì1976 and the dance floor was installed. Member‚Äôs donations helped to fun a new roof and lighting installed in 1977‚Äì1978. In 1984 a gable roof was installed, replacing the flat roof.  Ladies Auxiliary  The Ladies Auxiliary began in the mid-1940s, sometime after the club moved to its present location. Since women were not allowed to be members at that time, this served as their own club within the club. The women would accompany their husbands when they came for membership meetings, but then would have their own meetings upstairs. In those days, the women were required to have their husbands' permission to join the Auxiliary. At its peak, the Auxiliary had around 50 members and, truth be told, these women were the backbone of the club. They organized parties for all occasions and events. Christmas parties for the children of KYC members complete with Santa arriving by a U.S. Coast Guard boat. They held fundraisers that raised money for everything from curtains for the clubhouse to donations to charities. The women served dinner after each membership meeting. They organized monthly bowling events during the winter and Kentucky Derby parties complete with Mint Juleps in the spring. They had their own softball team, the KYC Admirals. Within their meetings they planned many activities such as games and boating. As with most clubs, the segregation of the sexes came to an end. In the late nineteen eighties, one of the women proclaimed that she too was a member and wanted to attend regular membership meetings. That moment marked the beginning of the end for the Ladies Auxiliary, but it also signaled a new beginning for the Club.

Former Prime Minister Almazbek Atambayev of the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan won in the first round. Background The election followed the 2010 Kyrgyzstani riots, during which the incumbent President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was ousted by protesters and an interim government led by Roza Otunbayeva was formed. An election and reform plan was unveiled on 19 April 2010. Presidential terms Under the new constitution, the presidential term is six years long, but re-election is barred. Date The election date was announced on 22 April 2010; a constitutional referendum to reduce presidential powers and strengthen democracy was held on 27 June 2010. On 19 May 2010, it was announced that the presidential elections would not be held on 10 October 2010 together with parliamentary elections, but rather in October 2011, and that Otunbayeva would remain president until 31 December 2011. Candidates The Central Election Commission announced that eighty-three candidates filed to run in the election by the deadline of 16 August. 16 candidates were nominated by parties, while the rest self-nominated. The candidates would have to collect 30,000 signatures, pay a fee of 100,000 Kyrgyzstani soms and pass a televised language test to run for the office of president. Sixteen candidates then qualified to run in the election. The candidates included: * Prime Minister Almazbek Atambayev, party leader of the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan, who resigned his post in September to run for president. He is seen as the \\"flagbearer of reforms\\" that resulted in and from the new constitution. * Former Emergency Situations Minister Kamchybek Tashiyev, party leader of Ata- Zhurt * Former head of State Security Adakhan Madumarov * Former Prosecutor- General Kubatbek Baibolov * Sooronbay Dyikanov * Former President of the Supreme Court Kurmanbek Osmonov * Former Mayor of Bishkek Marat Sultanov The incumbent Otunbayeva stated that she would not run in the election. Omurbek Tekebayev, party leader of the opposition Ata Meken Socialist Party, declared he would not be a candidate for the presidency on 22 September. Campaign Atambayev had the most funds for his campaign and gained a significant share of exposure, thus he said the election could be over in one round. He added \\"I have bright hopes; it is time for our country to live, achieve harmony and flourish. People are tired of political battles and meetings.\\" However Tashiyev and Adakha Madumarov on multiple occasions suggested that there could be vote-rigging during the election. Tashiyev said that: \\"The main thing is that there should be no evidence of fraud and the election results must not be falsified.\\" Following the ethnic riots in 2010, tensions between the indigenous Kyrgyz and Uzbeks continue to be volatile in the south with the region being viewed as a political battleground. Opinion polls Opinion polls suggested Atambayev was the clear favourite. Madumarov and Tashiyev, both from the south, being Atambayev's closest challengers. Conduct The CEC announced on 21 July that it had accredited 40 television and radio broadcasting companies, as well as 103 print media outlets to cover the election, however it refused to consider doing so for 11 internet news agencies. The OSCE said that almost 400 international observers from 41 countries would monitor the election. Douglas Wake, a monitor from the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, said that the election was competitive, but there were some issues in regards to the voter lists and the transparency of the process. Sooronbay Dyikanov said that he could not vote because his name was not on the voter list. The central election committee said that this was a mistake, and regional election commissions were the ones who were responsible for this. At the same time Dyikanov said that this was done deliberately. There were numerous other voters who could not vote for the same reason. Adakhan Madumarov and five other candidates said they would reject the result as several people could not vote according to their \\"constitutional rights\\" and that there had been multiple voting. Results Former Prime Minister Atambayev won the presidential election by a large margin in the first round and became the new President of Kyrgyzstan. Over 60% voter turnout was recorded. Reactions After voting, Atambayev said that: \\"A parliamentary system is more suited to the nomadic spirit of the people.\\" After 95% of the preliminary results suggested Atambayev had more than 60% of the vote, his campaign spokesman Kadyr Toktogulov said that \\"Atambayev secured a national victory. There is a very small split in the number of votes he got in the north and the south.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Central Election Commission (in Kyrgyz and Russian) Category:Presidential elections in Kyrgyzstan Kyrgyzstan Category:2011 in Kyrgyzstan ","title":"2011 Kyrgyz presidential election"},{"id":"26891579","text":"Gerhard Stapelfeldt (born October 26, 1947, Hamburg, Germany) is a German sociologist.

In this interpretation he shows and explains the history of the Euro and criticises that European policy mainly took the currency - and not political ideas - as EU-European identity.

As of June 2005, its population was estimated to be five people.Bema Gold Corporation, p. 87 Constructed as a part of the expansion of the Pevek Airport, Apapelgino has been mostly abandoned, although not officially abolished. Etymology There are several versions of the origin of Apapelgino's name. The first theory is that it comes from the Chukchi word \\"\\" (apaapa·∏∑gyn), meaning spider's neck, due to a variety of spiders in this place. Another theory is that it is a portmanteau of the Yupik word \\"\\" (apy), meaning snow, and the Chukchi word \\"\\" (velgyn), meaning throat or mouth. Finally, the name could have derived from the Koryak word \\"\\" (apiapil), meaning a sacrificial place. History Apapelgino was used primarily to meet the administrative needs of the Pevek Airport, as well as for housing the airport's workers. In the 1950s, the airfield was developed as a part of the Soviet Air Forces' plan to create a ring of air bases around the Arctic for the use of its strategic bomber fleet during the Cold War. During the Cold War, this airfield formed a network of forward staging bases inside the Arctic Circle, the need for which was dictated by geography and weather. The northern parts of the Soviet Union closest to the United States are in the Arctic, with hostile weather conditions. Consequently, Soviet strategic bombers were normally stationed at bases in more temperate parts of the Soviet Union, flying training missions from these forward staging bases. However, the focus on intercontinental ballistic missiles as opposed to bombers meant that the airfield became less important and this was reflected by a gradual reduction in the local population. Following the 1957 expansion of the airport, construction of a road linking Apapelgino to Pevek began in 1959; in 1961, a bridge was constructed over the Apapelgyn River to complete the link. As Apapelgino grew, a boiler house, greenhouses for growing vegetables, a complex for the lower secondary school, cafeteria and library, a nursery, kindergarten, and a series of apartment buildings were built. By the beginning of the 21st century, however, the reduction in the population was such that it was decided that the remaining residents would be resettled to Pevek, with most residents leaving in 2001. Nevertheless, some refused to be resettled and, for the fear of losing the privileges allotted to the residents of localities in the process of liquidation, continued to reside in Apapelgino even after central heating was turned off.Regions.ru. –ñ–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –ø–æ—Å—ë–ª–∫–∞ –ê–ø–∞–ø–µ–ª—å–≥–∏–Ω–æ –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –ø–æ–∫–∏–Ω—É—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ–∏ –Ω–µ–æ—Ç–∞–ø–ª–∏–≤–∞–µ–º—ã–µ –¥–æ–º–∞ (Apapelgino Residents Refuse to Leave Their Unheated Homes) Most of those residents moved out in 2002.Regions.ru. –ñ–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –ø–æ—Å—ë–ª–∫–∞ –ê–ø–∞–ø–µ–ª—å–≥–∏–Ω–æ –ø–æ–∫–∏–¥–∞—é—Ç —Å–≤–æ–∏ –¥–æ–º–∞ (Apapelgino Residents Leave Their Homes) Even after Apapelgino was mostly abandoned (with only five people remaining in residence as of 2005), the airport still serves as the main transport hub for Northern Chukotka and the local infrastructure is being maintained.

He sought and obtained the aid of the Caliph Muawiyah I (r. 661‚Äì680), but was killed in a horse accident before confronting the imperial troops. Biography Saborios is mentioned as being of Persian descent by Theophanes the Confessor (his name is a rendering of the Persian Shapur), but most modern scholars regard him an Armenian... He is sometimes identified with a certain Pasagnathes, \\"patrikios of the Armenians\\", who rebelled in 651/652. In 667, Saborios was the governing general (strategos) of the theme of the Armeniacs, covering the northeastern part of Byzantine Anatolia. At the time, and for several years, Emperor Constans II had been residing in Syracuse in Sicily, having left the capital Constantinople in the hands of his young son, co-emperor, and eventual successor, Constantine IV (r. 668‚Äì685). In the emperor's absence, Caliph Muawiyah had sent a series of devastating raids into Anatolia, targeting chiefly the Armeniac theme.; . Taking advantage of the absence of many soldiers of the other themes with Constans in Sicily, Saborios launched a revolt in late 667. In order to secure his rear, he sent one of his generals, Sergios, to Damascus to enlist Muawiyah's support. Constantine, learning of the rebellion, also sent an envoy, the eunuch koubikoularios Andrew, to the caliph. Andrew, however, could not match the rebel's offer of a heavy tribute (\\"the entire public revenues\\" according to Theophanes) and Muawiyah agreed to support Saborios with troops... Despite this setback, Andrew arranged for Sergios, who had insulted him during the negotiations, to be captured at a pass near Arabissus in Cilicia by troops loyal to the emperor. Sergios was then castrated and impaled on a stake. Nevertheless, with his eastern flank secure, Saborios marched west towards Constantinople, and succeeded in gaining control over most of Anatolia. He camped with his men at Hexapolis, also known as Hadrianopolis, in Bithynia, where he drilled his troops and awaited the arrival of the Arab army. Saborios was readying his men to face an oncoming loyalist army under the patrikios Nikephoros, when his horse bolted, slamming his head on a city gate and killing him.; ; . The Armeniac troops, left leaderless, quickly submitted, and by the time the Arab troops arrived, the revolt was effectively over. The Arab army used the turmoil to raid as far as the Bosporus and capture Amorion, but the city was retaken by the Byzantines during the following winter.. Legacy Saborios's rebellion did not result in any territorial losses for Byzantium, but was important nonetheless as the first attested rebellion of a thematic force,. heralding a number of similar revolts during the remainder of the 7th and throughout the 8th centuries.. Despite the continued occurrence of revolts, however, Saborios's fate also encouraged a belief, oft-repeated in Byzantine and Syriac sources, that death would result from rebelling against the lawful emperor in Constantinople, and from dealing with the infidel Muslims..

The text was written by an unknown poet, who did not refer to the prescribed readings for the day. Bach began the libretto for the feast with a quotation from Psalm 84 and included two hymn stanzas, the first from Martin Rinckart's \\"\\", associated with Reformation Day in Leipzig, as the third movement, and as the last movement the final stanza of Ludwig Helmbold's \\"\\". Bach composed a work of \\"festive magnificence\\", structured in six movements, with an aria following the opening chorus, a pair of recitative and duet following the first chorale. He scored the work for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, timpani, two transverse flutes (added for a later performance), two oboes, strings and continuo. He achieved a unity within the structure by using the horns not only in the opening but also as obbligato instruments in the two chorales, the first time even playing the same motifs. Bach performed the cantata again, probably in 1730. He later reworked the music of the opening chorus and a duet again in his Missa in G major, BWV 236, and the music of an alto aria in his Missa in A major, BWV 234.  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in his third year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. While he had written complete annual cycles for many occasions of the liturgical year the first two years in the position, he slowed down in the third. For the Reformation Day, he composed this new cantata, his first extant work for the occasion. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, \\"be steadfast against adversaries\\" (), and from the Book of Revelation, fear God and honour him (). The writer of the text ‚Äì an unknown poet ‚Äì was not concerned about the readings, and began with a quotation from Psalm 84 (). He included the first stanza from Martin Rinckart's hymn \\"\\" and as the closing chorale the final stanza of Ludwig Helmbold's hymn \\"\\". According to the Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann, the first of these hymns was sung regularly after the sermon on Reformation Day in Leipzig. Bach first performed the cantata on 31 October 1725. He repeated it again, probably in 1730, with minor changes in the scoring, doubling the oboes by flutes and assigning a flute as the obbligato instrument in the alto aria. He used the music of the opening chorus and the duet again in his Missa in G major, BWV 236, and the music of the alto aria in his Missa in A major, BWV 234.  Music = Structure and scoring  Bach structured the cantata in six movements. A choral movement is followed by an aria, a chorale, recitative and duet, closed by another chorale. He scored the work for three vocal soloists (soprano, alto, bass), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns (Co), timpani (Ti), two flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. The title page of the autograph score reads: \\"Festo Reformat. / Gott der Herr ist Sonn und Schild / a / 4 Voci / 2 Corni / Tamburi / 2 Hautb. / 2 Viol. / Viola / e / Cont. / di / J.S.Bach\\". In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.  Movements  Schlosskirche, Wittenberg, main door As Hofmann points out, Bach achieved \\"festive magnificence\\", using two horns and timpani not only in the opening chorus but also as obbligato instruments in the two chorales. Bach established unity of form by using a horn motif from the first movement again in the first chorale, juxtaposed to the hymn tune. = 1 = The cantata opens with a choral movement, \\"\\" (God the Lord is sun and shield). The instrumental ritornello introduces two themes: \\"a festive, march-like theme for the horns and timpani, and a more lively counter-theme that develops from a note that is heard seven times.\\" The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that the ritornello, structured in three parts, is among the longest among Bach's opening choruses. The horns are silent in the middle section, but the voices enter \\"an imitative discussion of a simplified version of the string theme from the ritornello. Complex contrapuntal texture is used as the vehicle to convey the important and ultimately optimistic message ... The driving rhythms infusing the intricate swirling counterpoint produce an effect that is totally infectious\\", as Mincham writes. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted during his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 the cantatas for Reformation at the Schlosskirche in Wittenberg where the Reformation began, describes the opening chorus as a ceremonial procession, and hears the \\"insistent drum beat\\" going along with the \\"fanfares of the high horns\\" as \\"the hammering of Luther‚Äôs theses to the oak door at the back of the church\\". = 2 = The aria for alto and an obbligato oboe, \\"\\" (God is our sun and shield!), expresses similar ideas as the first movement in a personal way, described as \\"tranquil and individual\\" by Mincham. In a later version, the oboe is replaced by a transverse flute. = 3 = In the first chorale, \\"\\" (Now let everyone thank God), Bach uses the first theme of the opening again, simultaneously with the chorale tune. Helmuth Rilling notes the unity of topic, praise and thanks to God, for the first three movements. The praise, individual in the preceding aria, is now communal again, \\"a rousing hymn, now given the most extrovert of settings!\\" Gardiner assumes that the sermon may have followed the chorale. = 4 = The only recitative, sung by the bass, \\"\\" (Praise God, we know the right way to blessedness), mentions the reason for thanks on this occasion. The phrase \\"\\" (You have instructed us through Your word) addresses \\"the basic issues of the Reformation\\", as Rilling points out. = 5 = A duet for bass and soprano, \\"\\" (God, ah God, abandon Your own ones never again!), expresses a prayer for protection. The voices are in homophony, beginning without the instruments, while a \\"sharply contoured violin theme\\" appears first alone, then together with the voices. All violins play it in unison. The motif was attributed by the Bach scholar Albert Schweitzer to tumult, representing the \\"raging of enemies\\" mentioned in the text. Gardiner hears in the \\"innocent\\" setting of the voices \\"a pre-echo ‚Ä¶ of Papageno and Papagena, a Mozartian impression, reinforced by the hint of in the violin ritornelli\\". = 6 = The cantata ends with a four-part setting of the second chorale, \\"\\" (Uphold us in the truth), asking for the gifts of truth and eternal freedom. The horns play again independently, but not in the rousing way of movement 3.  Recordings  The entries are taken from the listing on the Bach Cantatas Website.

The instrument has a regular six-stringed guitar setup on a lute bowl, however there are many theorboed variants with up to 11 strings. (see de:Deutsche Basslaute) The instrument is associated with the Wandervogel countercultural movement in Germany in the first half of the 20th century. The name German lute is sometimes also used for the waldzither, for both gaining the status of a national instrument in the early 20th century. Design=Headstock The headstock commonly ends in two styles, either a head (representing animals or humanoids) or a curve (into a flat finial, carved or undecorated). Less commonly, instead of gears, wooden pegs may be used to tune the strings. Lute guitar headstocks are thinner and more curved than their modern guitar counterparts. Neck and fretboard While the neck of a lute guitar is very similar to that of a modern classical guitar, the fretboard (or fingerboard) design is often different. The fretboard of a modern guitar extends down over the soundboard all the way to the sound hole. However, the lute guitar's fretboard may be on the same level with the soundboard and stop at the bottom of the neck, with the additional frets continuing down the soundboard independently, similar to the lute's. The fretboard is occasionally scalloped. Body The body of the lute guitar is similar to the rounded body of the traditional lute. Several ribs (or panels) of curved wood (usually maple or rosewood) make up the back of body, glued to a wooden frame underneath. These ribs are sometimes painted to resemble the traditional (or stereotypical) perception of a medieval minstrel or jester. For example, ribs may be painted in alternating colors (e.g. white, green, white and so on). Soundboard The lute guitar usually has a bookmatched spruce soundboard with a sound hole, which looks like that of the lute but is much thicker. Sound hole and rosette A modern classical guitar usually has a simply cut sound hole. Lute guitars, however, may have intricate designs carved into the soundboard, such as geometric patterns or representational decorations such as flowers, castles, and scrolls. Alternatively, a simple hole may be cut and a pre-carved disk of wood then glued onto the inside of the soundboard; in some cases, multiple layers of disks are designed in a cascading effect. Bridge The bridge of a lute guitar works in the same manner as a modern guitar bridge, but also serves as a decorative piece made in various shapes, sizes, and styles, often elaborately carved, for example, ending in swirls on each side.

The Security Council reiterated the importance of the Accordos de Paz and Lusaka Protocol peace agreements between the Government of Angola and UNITA, of which both parties had agreed a timetable for implementing. The Council noted that the peace process in Angola had entered a new a promising phase with growing trust between the two parties; it was calm in most areas of the country though there were still a number of ceasefire violations. Human rights monitors and the deployment of United Nations military and police monitors had contributed significantly to the security situation in the country. The commitment of both parties was commended but there was concern about the slow implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, and especially the dissolution of the troops, demining and the establishment of quartering areas. The importance of the electoral process was stressed and called for both parties to establish a timetable for the formation of new army, a prisoner of war exchange and repatriation of mercenaries. The two parties were urged to put an end to the laying of land mines and to report unauthorised troop movements. It was also equally important for the population to be disarmed, the dissemination of objective information through Radio UNAVEM and the need to reach the full strength of UNAVEM III as soon as possible. Concern was expressed at violence by unaffiliated groups and called for measures to disarm them. The parties were called upon to allow access to all military facilities by UNAVEM III, and the Angolan government and UNITA also had to ensure that relief supplies could travel freely throughout the country. Resolution 1008 concluded by asking for further contributions from member states and donors towards the reconstruction of Angola, particularly for roads, and for Secretary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali to submit a report every two months on the situation in the country.

Kurtz, History of the Christian Church to the Restoration, 265‚Äì266 In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus. During his term the theological issue of the relation between the Son and the Father in the Holy Trinity first appeared. The issue was created due to the explanation that one Demetrius of Lampi (in Phrygia) gave to the phrase of the Gospel of John , which means my Father is bigger than me (John, XIV.29). Chrysoberges, at the behest of the Emperor Manuel I, convened several meetings of the synod in 1166 to solve the problem, which condemned as heretical the explanations of Demetrius and the laity that followed him.Hussey, pp. 152‚Äì153. Those who refused to submit to the synod's decisions had their property confiscated or were exiled. The political dimensions of this controversy are apparent from the fact that a leading dissenter from the Emperor's doctrine was his nephew Alexios Kontostephanos.P. Magdalino, The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos, 217 Other heresies continued to flourish in Byzantine possessions in Europe, including Bogomils, Paulicians, and Monophysites which Luke and his successors had difficulty in suppressing.Hussey, p. 162. A millennium-old Byzantine mosaic of John Chrysostom (Hagia Sophia) ‚Äì The controversy of 1156‚Äì1157 was about the interpretation of John's liturgy for the Eucharist, \\"Thou art He who offers and is offered and receives.\\" Luke was also involved in a process of the Church trying to extract itself from too close an association with the secular life of the state. In 1115, the patriarch John IX Agapetos had sought to prevent clerics acting as advocates in lay courts. In December 1157, Chrysoberges extended this prohibition to all \\"worldly\\" occupations. In a still-extant cannon, he wrote: \\"we have observed that some of those enrolled in the clergy have uncanonically involved themselves in worldly affairs. Some have taken on posts as curators or overseers of aristocratic houses and estates; others have undertaken the collection of public taxes... others have accepted dignities and magistracies assigned to the civil establishment.... we enjoin such people to desist from now on from all the aforesaid occupations, and to devote themselves to ecclesiastical exigencies....\\"Magdalino, p. 306. Such a separation of church and state was key to preserve the church from undue secular influence over matters it considered strictly clerical. This was especially key at the time as the rule of the Emperor Manuel I Comnenos was noted for its autocratic style and caesaropapism, and though idiosyncratic, generally made the patriarchate subservient directly to the needs of the state.Magdalino, pp. 308‚Äì309.

This Saint-√âtienne-based company manufactures loudspeakers for the home, speaker drivers for automobiles, headphones and professional monitoring loudspeakers. The Grande Utopia is the brand's emblematic loudspeaker, which earned the company its worldwide reputation.Jack English auditions the JMlab Grand Utopia loudspeaker , on focal.com. It is considered one of the best high-fidelity loudspeakers in the world.Pierre Stemmelin, Top 44 des meilleures enceintes acoustiques audiophiles de tous les temps, on on-mag.fr/index.php.Val√©rie Marchive, Grande Utopia EM, l‚Äôenceinte de tous les superlatifs , on lepoint.fr. Focal's industrial strategy concentrates on having full control over the entire production process, from the design and manufacturing of the speaker drivers to the assembly of the final product. Its products are entirely designed and developed in France, and most of the production is carried out at the factory in Saint-√âtienne (France). Focal-JMlab generates a ‚Ç¨53 million annual turnover and employs about 230 people at its facility in Saint-√âtienne, which groups the production, R&D; and management departments at the same site. Its export share is 70%.  History = 1980s  Focal-JMlab, a research office dedicated to acoustics was founded in 1979 in Paris by engineer, high-fidelity enthusiast and technology journalist Jacques Mahul.Philippe Bidalon, ¬´ Les 100 qui font bouger Saint-√âtienne : Jacques Mahul ¬ª, on lexpress.fr, L'Express He began making his first speaker drivers in a small workshop in Saint-Etienne, at a precision mechanics company, which belonged to his father. Whilst producing his speaker drivers, Jacques Mahul also launched his own range of loudspeakers under the brand JMlab. His first loudspeaker, the DB13, was a bookshelf loudspeaker, which produced volumes comparable to larger loudspeakers, particularly in bass frequencies. Initially, he only sold his product to acquaintances but the DB13 was soon launched on the market. In the 1980s, the two brands became established. Focal focused on innovation, producing specialised products such as the polyglass \\"V\\" cone and polykevlar cone. The materials used on the tweeter evolved from glass fibres to Kevlar, producing a more linear frequency response curve and a smoother and less piercing treble. As for JMlab, the company went from being a manufacturer of small-and medium-sized loudspeakers to a manufacturer of veritable high-end models.  1990s  Things rapidly began to pick up speed in 1990 with the arrival of G√©rard Chr√©tien, another high end high fidelity enthusiast and editor-in-chief of the magazine L‚ÄôAudiophile since 1977. Currently, he is the managing director and marketing director of Focal-JMlab. By adapting the company's products to the demands of the consumer, the brand soon earned its role as leader on the French loudspeaker market. The company's turnover increased from ‚Ç¨9 million in 1992 to ‚Ç¨26 million in 2000. It was also in the early 1990s that the company implemented an export strategy for its loudspeakers across Europe, Southeast Asia and North America. The brand's reputation on the international stage was reinforced by various awards. The JMlab Vega model was voted \\"Loudspeaker of the Year, 1992\\" in Japan and in 1996, the Grande Utopia model was praised by the international press.  2000s  From 2002, production was relocated in Saint-Etienne where about three-quarters of production still takes place with the aim of equipping every loudspeaker with \\"Made in France\\" speaker drivers. In 2003, the two brands were incorporated under the name Focal-JMlab for home products, before being renamed as just Focal in 2005 for all product sectors. 2003 was also the year that the company began collaborating with Paris-based design agency Pineau & Le Porcher. By combining sound quality and aesthetics, this move made Focal- JMlab products lifestyle loudspeakers in their own right and also gave the company a brand signature. Thus, Focal and Pineau & Le Porcher worked in close collaboration to come up with a completely new design for various ranges: Profile and Electra (2005), Chorus (2006), Utopia (2008) and Dome (2009). In 2007, the company bought up the Guy HF cabinet-making facility located in Bourbon-Lancy, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire.  2010s  In 2011, Focal-JMlab merged with Naim Audio Limited, the leading high-end electronics brand in the UK, which mainly designs and manufactures audio electronics. The new holding company, Vervent Audio Group, owns and manages the two brands. However, both brands remain independent with their own specific philosophies and their own respective ranges and products. The two companies began consolidating their activities in 2013, with their presence on a common stand at the High End Show in Munich. In 2011, Focal adopted a new visual identity and finally, in 2012, built a showroom and a new auditorium at its site in Saint-√âtienne. In 2014, Focal&Naim; Group was taken over by its management team, Naxicap Partners (major shareholder), Aquasourca and Garibaldi Participations. Jacques Mahul remains involved and becomes Focal-JMlab Vice-Pr√©sident. The same year, Focal is recognized by the French state thanks to The Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (Living Heritage Company) label.

Consult√© le 29 novembre 2017  Technologies  Focal- JMlab maintains a regular research and development program in speaker drivers‚Äô technologies. Investments in this field have enabled the company to conceive various innovative concepts.Richard, FOCAL le retour de la vraie enceinte haute fid√©lit√©, on culturehd.com Ten innovations have been patented to date.  Inverted dome tweeter (1981)  An inverted dome tweeter was designed and developed by Focal in 1981. (Inverted dome tweeters appeared at least as early as the late 1960s in the EPI 100 loudspeaker manufactured by EPI/Epicure. It had an inverted paper dome.) One of its main advantages is its low directionality and its high dynamics. The majority of the brand's tweeters still feature this technology.  K2 cone (1986)  In 1986, the company introduced the Polykevlar sandwich structure. The Poly-K cone is composed of two layers of aramid fibres applied to either side of a hollow-micro-ball structure in order to improve the compromise between weight-rigidity-and damping.  Polyglass cone (1988)  Polyglass technology was introduced by Focal in 1988. This consists in depositing fine glass micro-balls on the surface of a cellulose pulp cone (paper). This combination of glass and paper results in a very rigid material with a low mass, providing excellent damping qualities. The Polyglass cone resulted in a very linear frequency response curve and improved the definition of the midrange.  \\"W\\" sandwich cone (1995)  In 1995, Focal improved its sandwich concept with its \\"W\\" cone system which consists of two sheets of glass fibres applied to a structural foam core. Unlike the mono-material cones, the \\"W\\" sandwich cone optimises the frequency response curve by maximising the mass, rigidity and damping.  Beryllium tweeter (2002)  In 2002, Focal launched another innovation to their product line, the Beryllium Tweeter, which was only the second time a tweeter had ever been manufactured from Beryllium. Yamaha had introduced the Beryllium tweeter and Beryllium mid-range speaker in the NS-1000 back in 1974. Beryllium is seven times more rigid than titanium (six times more rigid than aluminum), but has the same mass. It enabled Focal to develop a lighter and faster tweeter which provides excellent damping qualities. When associated with the inverted dome concept, the frequency response can be increased to 40 kHz, and more than 5 octaves can be spanned. Being ten times more expensive than gold, Focal only uses the Beryllium Tweeter for the Premium ranges: Utopia, Sopra, Electra and high end studio monitors.  Tweeter Al-Mg (2007)  This tweeter was introduced by Focal JMlab in 2007. The use of aluminium increases damping qualities, whereas the use of magnesium increases the rigidity of the dome. This enabled the frequency response of the Al-Mg Tweeter to be increased to 28 kHz. The Al-Mg Tweeter is used on the Chorus range of the Home line and on the CMS and Shape ranges of the Pro line, among others.  Flax membrane cone (2013)  Eighteen years after introducing the \\"W\\" sandwich cones, Focal launched the new Made in France \\"F\\" Sandwich cone (for Flax). Composed of flax fibres enclosed in two thin layers of glass fibre, this solution offers a natural sound without colouration thanks to light, rigid and damped cones.Alexandre, Focal d√©voile une nouvelle membrane Flax √† base de lin, on caraudiovideo.com  Tuned mass damper (2015)  In order to control resonance and to reduce medium speaker driver distortions, the Tuned Mass Damper technology consists of an additional mass that oscillates in opposition to the resonance frequency. The suspension is optimised to avoid distortions and increase the definition.  Infinite horn loading system (2015)  The rear of the Beryllium tweeter is loaded via a small cavity which is connected to the exterior of the enclosure by a horn. The inside is filled with a damping material. Rear wave of the tweeter is gradually absorbed to reduce distortion.  M-shaped inverted dome tweeter (2016)  Tweeters from the K2 Power, renewed in 2016, feature this M-shaped profile. This shape enables to extend the frequency response, a smoother diffusion, and more detailed treble.Focal renouvelle la l√©gendaire ligne K2 Power, sur autonews.fr. Consult√© le 29 novembre 2017  M-profile cone (2018)  Utopia M speaker drivers (range launched in 2018) feature a M-profile cone which combines rigidity, damping and lightness for more linear frequency response, reduced harmonic distortion and better sound dispersion.  Slatefiber cone (2019)  Developed with the Chora range, the Slatefiber cone is a membrane composed of recycled non-woven carbon fibres and thermoplastic polymer. Made in France at Focal, this \\"slate effect\\" cone provides a dynamic and rich sound.  Products  Focal-JMlab has organised its range of products into five universes: the Home line, the Car line, the Pro line for music industry professionals, the Headphones line since 2012 and finally the Integration line (public address sound systems) The Home loudspeakers universe represents 59% of the company turnover and is divided into two collections: * Classic: all the loudspeakers of this collection are designed, developed and manufactured in France and combine all the Focal technological innovations (inverted dome tweeter, ¬´ W ¬ª and ¬´ F ¬ª sandwich con, etc.). Among the principal products, there are the Utopia, Sopra, Electra, Aria, Chorus, Kanta and more recently Chora lines. In 2013, launches Easya, high-fidelity wireless loudspeakers connectable with multiple sources thanks to built-in Bluetooth¬Æ aptX¬Æ technology. The Grande Utopia is the collection's emblematic loudspeaker. The first generation of the Grande Utopia, born in 1995, is a condensation of all the expertise and experience that Focal had gained since its creation. The second generation, in 2002, had the particularity of featuring pure Beryllium dome tweeters which enable it to receive, the year after, the \\"Golden Sound\\" award in Japan.Le fabricant d'enceintes acoustiques Focal r√©organise sa production , on usinenouvelle.com, L'Usine nouvelle The third generation, launched in 2008, was a concentration of the best of Focal technologies. Designed by Pineau & Le Porcher, The Grande Utopia EM distinguished itself through its extraordinary dimensions: weighing 570 lbs (260 kg) and standing over 6 ft (2m) high. The cabinets can be customised at the cabinet-making facility in Bourbon-Lancy which is in charge of manufacturing and finishing the cabinets. In 2018, Focal unveiled Grande Utopia EM Evo and Stella Utopia EM Evo, which feature the latest technology of the brand. * New Media: Since 2008, with the arrival of the D√¥me miniature loudspeaker (available with Flax cone since 2014), Focal has adapted its know-how to new modes of music consumption with compact loudspeakers, \\"Plug and Play\\", multimedia and more recently wireless (XS Book Wireless in 2013). In 2013, Focal launched 5.1 Home Cinema Packs in the New Media collection. Since May 2014, Focal entered the soundbar market launching Dimension, a 5.1 soundbar which, associated with its subwoofer, can be used as a sound plate for a flat screen. The Sib line evolved in 2017 and became Sib Evo featuring Dolby Atmos technology.Focal launches Sib Evo Dolby Atmos speaker package, on whathifi.com. At the end of the 1980s the Car Audio department was born and the first car audio products were launched. In 2010, the Car Audio division has been reorganized into three ranges and represents now 30% of the turnover. * Elite : manufactured in France, the Utopia Be and K2 Power kits enable made-to-measure installations. It is the high-end range of the Focal Car Audio offering. In June 2014, Focal launches the made in France, handmade high-end Ultima kit. This concentrates Focal technologies used in the Grande Utopia EM speaker and in the SM9 monitoring speaker.. End of 2018, the Utopia M line joins the Elite range with a new \\"√† la carte\\" concept which enables to customers to configure their own system. * Performance : products of this range offer the possibility of creating your own installation thanks to the technical solutions of the Expert, Access and Auditor lines. * Int√©gration : This range offers simple and quick to install products, particularly \\"Plug & Play\\" kits intended for improving some brands‚Äô original acoustic (BMW, Peugeot 207 and Golf 6, Renault and Toyota) but also the Universal line where each system has a reduced volume and is easy to install. In 2002, a professional department, \\"Focal Professional\\" has been created, offering studio monitors dedicated to recording studios. The range is composed of five lines: SM9, SM6, CMS, Shape and Alpha to which the Listen professional and Clear Professional headphones designed for sound professionals (sound engineers and musicians) were added in 2018. The range now represents 11% of the company turnover. Since 2007, Focal have offered invisible sound systems, In-Wall and In-Ceiling, in order to add sound to public and private places. In 2018, the brand presents 100 Series and 300 Series which include Outdoor loudspeakers Finally, in 2012, Focal expanded into commercializing its first nomad headphone, Spirit One which is replaced by Spirit One S model two years later. The range is completed in 2013 with the Spirit Classic, a headphone intended for a use at home and Spirit Professional. In 2015, Focal launches its very first in-ear headphones named Sphear.

It was the first American Dream. During the Dust Bowl, many farmers around Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle Area experienced the worst of the Depression. By the time the summer of 1936 hit, they had already been experiencing dust storms, winds that carried away all the precious topsoil and made it impossible to grow crops, plagues of Grasshoppers and starving jackrabbits that devoured anything left over in their fields, and terrible Dust Pneumonia, caused by the dust that had settled over everything. Many farmers, about a quarter of the population of the panhandle, packed up their few belongings and left for California, nicknamed the \\"Peach Bowl\\", in search of jobs as fruit harvesters. However, of the ones that did, few found the jobs they searched for, and even they had extremely low wages. These job- searchers were nicknamed \\"Okies\\", as so many of them were from Oklahoma.

He got the idea for starting the Last Man Club when he read about a similar club that was started by a Civil War unit.Hurt, R. Douglas. The Dust Bowl: an Agricultural and Social History. Chicago: Nelson-Hall, 1981. Print. Members had to swear to be the last man to leave the Dust-Bowl-swept area. The exact pledge words were \\"In the absence of an act of God, serious family injury, or some other emergency, I pledge to stay here as the last man and to do everything I can to help other last men remain in this country. We promise to stay here ‚Äôtil hell freezes over and skate out on the ice.\\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/introduction/dustbowl- introduction/ information from Judge Cowen McCarty worked to instill a sense of pride in the region in the members of his club.

In the decade preceding 2014, the number of conversions to Islam among prisoners in Western countries outpaced all other religions, with the overall imprisoned Muslim population (jailhouse converts to Islam plus inmates who entered the prison system as Muslims) growing as a result. Although many prisoners find religion during their time in custody, the phenomenon of conversion to Islam in prisons is of particular discussion among academics, government and social services. Background=Australia While there is concern amongst state and prison officials of the risk of fast-paced conversion turning into radical Islam, the situation remains much more complicated. For many prisoners, the discovery of religion, Islam in particular provides a coping mechanism. An Australian study published in 2016 that looks at prisons as hotbeds for terrorism finds that conversion and radicalization are more common in extremely violent prisons with harsh conditions. UK There are instances in which conversion results in extremist or radical interpretations of Islam. Many prison and state authorities believe prisons are fueling \\"concerns about the rising threat of [non-Muslim] criminals being brought under the influence\\" to commit their predisposed acts of violence in the name of a cause‚Äîin this case, Islam‚Äîendangering the general non-Muslim population. British \\"[m]inisters have announced plans to create specialist units within jails to tackle what a government-ordered review last year [in 2016] concluded was a 'growing problem'\\". Growth and impact of prison conversions In some regions, a significant proportion of the growth of the Muslim population through conversion (i.e., growth which is neither the result of Muslim immigration nor natural Muslim birth rates) has been attributed to prison conversions specifically, rather than conversions of persons from the general non- incarcerated population. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the country's total Muslim population exceeded over 3 million in 2016, though that constituted only around 4.8% of the general UK population. Nevertheless, the proportion of UK prisoners who were Muslims in 2016 was 15%. Of the millions of Muslims in the general UK population in 2011, only 5,000 were persons who converted to Islam that year. Yet in that same year \\"[a]round 30% of Muslim inmates are converts [to Islam...] and many of those are, according to previous Home Office research, from black\\" ethnic backgrounds. In 1999, it was found that in the United Kingdom \\"37% of Muslim male prisoners were black Muslims compared with 7% [Black Muslims] in the wider (British Muslim) population,\\" with most Black Muslim inmates being converts to Islam. Meanwhile, \\"less than 1% of [British] Black Caribbeans are Muslims generally, in jail the figure is almost 19%.\\" Australia Muslims are over-represented in Australian prisons, with increasing numbers of inmates undergoing jailhouse conversions. In 2015, within \\"Victoria and NSW, 8 per cent and 9 per cent of the respective prison populations identify as Muslim, compared with 2.2 per cent and 3 per cent of the general populations. [...] Prison employees, who spoke confidentially to The Weekend Australian, say they are seeing increasing numbers of white and Aboriginal prisoners converting to Islam in jail.\\" In April 2017, it was reported that most inmates in NSW's Supermax Prison (High Risk Management Correctional Centre) were Muslim, with only a handful of non- Muslims. Located 195km southwest of Sydney, the prison is often referred to as ‚ÄúSuper mosque‚Äù. Of the Muslim inmates in Supermax, those serving sentences for non-terrorism related violent criminal offences (including murder, etc) are largely inmates \\"who converted to Islam behind bars\\". The Australian reported that \\"Islam has become an obsession for the violent inmates [...] inside Supermax\\". France In France, of the total French prisoner population, \\"a significant proportion of them are converts\\" to Islam who converted in jail. United Kingdom According to \\"Muslim Prisoners' Experiences\\" report by Chief Inspector of Prisons, Dame Anne Owers, conversion to Islam in prisons in the United Kingdom is attributed to converts seeking \\"support and protection in a group with a powerful identity\\" and \\"perceptions of material advantages of identifying as Muslim\\" in prison, including perks or \\"material benefits\\" available only to Muslims \\"such as more time out of their cell and better food during Ramadan if they become Muslim\\". United States In 2016, the total Muslim population in the United States reached approximately 3.3 million (0.9% of the U.S. population). Yet in the years between 2001 and 2014 it has been estimate that one quarter of a million U.S. convicts converted to Islam in the U.S. prison system, making prison converts to Islam just from those years (not counting prison converts to Islam before or since then) account for a significant proportion of all Muslims in the United States overall. In 2011, Pew Research Center data estimated that Muslims made up 9% of the 1,598,780 United States inmates in state and federal prisons despite Muslims being only 0.8% of the general U.S. population in the year prior. Muslims prisoners have been characterized as a danger or threat for radicalization in the media. For example, Indiana State University professor Mark Hamm stated in an interview with Fox News, ‚Äúit is not the sheer number of prisoners following extremist interpretations of religious doctrines that poses a threat, rather, it is the potential for the single individual to become radicalized.‚Äù Yet despite the fact of there being over 350,000 Muslim inmates in the United States, little evidence indicates widespread radicalization or foreign recruitment. Rather, research has shown that Islam has a long history of positive influence on prisoners, including supporting inmate rehabilitation for decades.

Biography The life of Sir Henry Lynch-Blosse, 7th Baronet was surrounded by controversy that centered on his relationship with his mistress, Sibella Cottle, by whom he fathered seven illegitimate children. The controversy focused on her residency in the Lynch-Blosse ‚ÄòBig House‚Äô in the village of Balla, County Mayo and her reputed use of witchcraft to spellbind Sir Henry to her for life. Lynch-Blosse was born in London, the first child of Robert Lynch and Elizabeth Barker.Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, Charles Mosley, editor, Crans, Switzerland, 107th edition, 2003, volume 2, G-O, 'Lynch-Blosse', pages 2436-38. Elizabeth was the daughter and heir of Francis Barker, and niece and heir of Tobias Blosse.Partridge, Charles, 'Blosse of Belstead', numbers 7 and 8, East Anglian Daily Times, 1, 15 March 1924. It was a condition of the marriage that Robert would assume the additional surname of Blosse and conform to Protestantism. Robert changed his surname by a private Act of Parliament of 1748.Deed Poll Office: Private Act of Parliament 1748 (22 Geo. 2). c. 38 Henry, better known as Harry, spent the first few years of his life in his mother's home in Suffolk, England. The family moved to Ireland in 1754 and took up residence at the Lynch-Blosse home in Balla, Co Mayo. When Sir Henry Lynch, 5th Baronet died in 1762, his eldest son, Robert Lynch-Blosse became the 6th Baronet in the succession of Lynch- Blosse Baronets. When Sir Robert died circa 1775, Harry became the 7th Baronet.McNulty, Paul, 'The genealogy of the Anglo-Norman Lynches who settled in Galway', Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society, 2010, volume 62, pages 30-50, http://www.gahs.info/index.php/en/journal/21-journal1#62.McNulty, Paul B, Genealogy of the Anglo-Norman Lynches: who settled in Galway, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2013, 162 pages, https://www.amazon.co.uk/Genealogy-Anglo-Norman-Lynches-settled- Galway/dp/1492810592/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1402920530&sr;=1-3&keywords;=paul+b+mcnulty. Shortly afterwards, Sir Harry was elected to the Irish House of Commons representing Tuam. He served in that capacity from 1776 to 1783.

Convicted of murder as well as criminal charges related to weapons, and the violation of an injunction against paramilitary activity, Miller has been a perennial candidate for public office. He is an advocate of white nationalism, white separatism, Odinism, and antisemitism. On April 13, 2014, Miller was arrested following the Overland Park Jewish Community Center shooting in Overland Park, Kansas. Johnson County prosecutors initially charged him with one count of capital murder and one count of first-degree murder. On October 17, 2014, the separate charge for first-degree murder was dismissed and all three deaths were included in a single capital murder count. Miller was also charged with three counts of attempted first-degree murder for allegedly shooting at three other people. On December 18, 2014, he was found competent to stand trial, and prosecutors announced they were seeking the death penalty against him. On August 31, 2015, Miller was found guilty in the Overland Park shooting of one count of capital murder, three counts of attempted murder and assault and weapons charges. Eight days later, the same jury recommended that Miller be put to death by lethal injection. On November 10, 2015, he was formally sentenced to death. Early life and education Frazier Glenn Miller Jr., a native of North Carolina, dropped out of high school and joined the United States Army, where he served 20 yearsFRAZIER GLENN MILLER, Southern Poverty Law Center and rose to the rank of master sergeant. He served two tours of duty in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Miller was introduced to white racialist politics by reading a copy of The Thunderbolt, a newsletter published by Dr. Edward Reed Fields of the National States' Rights Party, which given to him by his father. He was present as a member of the National Socialist Party of America during the Greensboro massacre on November 3, 1979. He was discharged from the U.S. Army later that year for distributing racist propaganda. White Patriot Party In 1980, Miller founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a local chapter, which later developed into the White Patriot Party (WPP). He was the leader and principal spokesman for the organization until his arrest in 1987, after which the organization soon dissolved. The WPP was avowedly pro-Apartheid, and openly advocated the establishment of an all-white nation in the territory of the American South. After the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) surreptitiously accessed the WPP's computer systems, it presented evidence in court indicating the WPP leadership was planning the assassination of SPLC leader Morris Dees. The court issued an injunction barring the WPP from engaging in paramilitary activity. Miller claimed to have received $200,000 from Robert Jay Mathews, the leader of The Order (which funded its activities by robbing banks and armored cars). During Miller's time as leader of the WPP, he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party's nomination for Governor of North Carolina in 1984, and then the Republican Party's nomination for one of North Carolina's seats in the United States Senate in 1986. He placed third in the Republican primary with 6,652 votes. Arrest and conviction In January 1985, Miller signed an agreement with Dees in exchange for dropping a lawsuit that the SPLC had brought against him. In July 1986, however, Miller was accused of violating the terms of the agreement by operating what was deemed a paramilitary training camp, and was found guilty of a criminal contempt-of- court charge. He was sentenced to a year in prison, with six months of the term suspended, and ordered to have no contact with white supremacists. Dated April 6, 1987, a typewritten letter titled \\"Declaration of War\\", signed by Miller, was mailed to 5,000 recipients. It began: \\"In the name of our Aryan God, thru His beloved Son, I Glenn Miller now this 6th day of April, 1987 do hereby declare total war. I ask for no quarter. I will give none. I declare war against Niggers, Jews, Queers, assorted Mongrels, White Race traitors, and despicable informants\\". The letter threatened Dees and established a point system for his assassination along with a host of federal officials. The letter proclaimed: \\"Let the blood of our enemies flood the streets, rivers, and fields of the nation, in Holy vengeance and justice... The Jews are our main and most formidable enemies, brothers and sisters. They are truly the children of Satan, as Christ tells us in St. John 8:44... we promise death to those who attack us or who attempt to place us in ZOG's dungeons.\\" Miller was charged in a warrant with violating the conditions of his bond and was sought as a fugitive. Miller was arrested on April 30, 1987, after authorities raided a mobile home he and others had rented in Ozark, Missouri, on numerous federal criminal charges in the company of three other men (Tony Wydra, Robert \\"Jack\\" Jackson, and Douglas Sheets), who were also taken into federal custody. A cache of weapons was found inside, which included \\"C-4 plastic explosives, dynamite, pipe bombs, hand grenades, fully automatic M-16, AR-15 semi- automatic rifles, sawed off shotguns, pistols, cross-bows, and around a half- ton of ammunition\\". Miller was indicted in May 1987 for violating 18, U.S.C. ¬ß876 (communicating a threat via U.S. mail). He pleaded guilty to avoid numerous other violations of federal law and was sentenced to five years in prison. After his arrest, Miller agreed to testify against several defendants in the Fort Smith sedition trial. He served three years (1987‚Äì1990) in federal prison following his conviction for weapons violations, as well as for violating the injunction proscribing him from engaging in paramilitary activities. When he was released, he was given the name Frazier Glenn Cross Jr., which he used for several years before ultimately reverting to his birth name. Legally, his name remains Cross. Subsequent activities After his release from prison, Miller began trucking and wrote an autobiography, A White Man Speaks Out, which was privately published in 1999. In its introduction, he asks: \\"If the Jews can have a Jewish state of their own, then why can‚Äôt we have a White Christian state of our own?\\" He repeatedly complains throughout the book that \\"the Jewish founded, financed, and led American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)... brought about the removal of prayer and the bible from public schools. They put the Negroes in and took the bible out, at about the same time they legalized pornography and interracial marriages... White Christians today represent the best of our Race.\\" By 2002, Miller had moved to Aurora, Missouri.\\"Controversial ‚Äòcampaign‚Äô ads air on area stations\\", The Joplin Globe, March 31, 2010, retrieved on April 9, 2010. When he retired from trucking in 2002, he tried to reenter the white supremacist movement by publishing a racist newsletter; however, people with a similar outlook responded with mixed reaction due to some regarding him as a traitor. Miller became affiliated with the Vanguard News Network of Alex Linder, which is an antisemitic, white nationalist website.\\"The Forums\\",Intelligence Report, Summer 2005, Issue #118, Southern Poverty Law Center, retrieved on April 9, 2010. In 2004, Miller posted an essay calling on Americans to rise up against Jews, people of color, immigrants, LGBTs, abortion, and church-state separation: \\"Our race is dying out rapidly right before your very eyes. ZOG is flooding our nation with tens-of-millions of colored aliens. ZOG has murdered over 30 million of our infants in the U.S., through ZOG legalized abortion. ZOG has legalized rectum loving, defecate eating faggots and outlawed our Christian religion from all public institutions and intends to outlaw it completely. When will you stand up and protest these outrages?\\" In 2006, Miller ran as an independent write-in candidate against Rep. Roy Blunt, in the 7th Congressional District of Missouri.Our Campaigns, \\"MO ‚Äì District 07 Race ‚Äì Nov 07, 2006,\\" (retrieved on April 9, 2010). In 2009, he published an essay criticizing abortion, LGBT rights, and church-state separation as a government attack on white Christians: \\"And so now you know why... the government legalized the abortion murders of over 35 million White gentile infants; why faggots have been legalized; ...why Christian prayers and the Christian bible were kicked out of public schools.\\" As a perennial candidate, he ran in the 2010 Senate election in Missouri, again as an independent write-in candidate.Our Campaigns, \\"MO US Senate Race ‚Äì Nov 02, 2010,\\" (retrieved on April 9, 2010). Miller's 2010 radio campaign advertisements became an issue in Missouri,Dave Helling, \\"Racist radio ads draw challenge,\\", The Kansas City Star, March 31, 2010, retrieved on April 9, 2010. and nationally. It was disputed whether Miller was a legitimate candidate or using his purported candidacy as a way to get air time, based on his comments on the website of the Vanguard News Network. He responded by stating that he would declare a candidacy and then start running ads. He said that \\"Federal elections offer public speaking opportunities we can't afford to pass up, and come only once every 2 years.\\" He wanted people to indicate their intention to donate \\"so I can decide whether or not to run? And say how much.\\" Despite legal challenges from Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster and the Missouri Broadcasters Association's disputing Miller's status as a bona fide candidate for office, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determined there exists no lawful recourse for stations that preferred not to air Miller's ads because of their offensive content. Dave Helling, \\"Racist KMBZ radio ad can't be stopped\\", The Kansas City Star, March 29, 2010, retrieved on April 9, 2010. Miller expressed open hatred for Jews repeatedly during an April 2010 interview with David Pakman on The David Pakman Show. (published on April 14, 2014). Miller lived for a time under an assumed identity as an FBI informant. During a trial hearing, where Miller received a five-year reduced sentence, details of his time as an informant were revealed, including an incident where Miller was arrested for engaging in sexual acts with a black cross-dressed male prostitute in a vehicle. No charges were pressed due to his status as an informant, but a phone call recorded with the Southern Poverty Law Center in which Miller admitted to the incident was presented at the trial, and claimed that he had lured the prostitute in his car with the intention of beating him. Shooting and trial On April 13, 2014, Miller was named the only suspect for the shooting earlier that day in suburban Kansas City that ended with the deaths of three people. Shootings occurred both outside the Jewish Community Center and outside a retirement home, Village Shalom, nearby, both located in Overland Park, Kansas. The victims of the Jewish Community Center shooting were identified as William Lewis Corporon and his grandson, 14-year-old Reat Griffin Underwood. Both were United Methodist Christians. A 53-year-old woman, Terri LaManno, of Kansas City was killed at the parking lot of Village Shalom, where her mother resides. LaManno was also a Christian who attended St. Peter's Catholic Church in Kansas City, Missouri. Several others had been shot at, including one person who was Jewish, but escaped without wounds. Miller was found later outside an elementary school nearby and was immediately declared a suspect. Authorities told reporters that Miller had shouted \\"Heil Hitler\\" numerous times during the shooting and during his arrest. The SPLC has reported that, according to Miller's wife Marge, Miller had gone to a casino in Missouri the afternoon prior to the shootings. Miller called his wife the next morning at around 10:30 a.m. to tell her \\"his winnings were up and all was well.\\" The shootings occurred less than three hours after the phone call. According to a November 15 interview with The Kansas City Star, Miller alleged he began planning the shootings in late March when he became convinced that he was dying from emphysema.

Retrieved 19 May 2013. from the late 2000s to May 2014. It was first ignited in flight during a SpaceShipTwo test launch in April 2013. This engine design was subsequently flown in only two additional flight tests during 2013 and January 2014. SNC was a subcontractor to Scaled Composites through May 2014 when their involvement in the program ended after Virgin Galactic elected to replace SNC's version of RocketMotorTwo powered by HTPB rubber fuel, with its own internally developed hybrid motor for SpaceShipTwo. The second-generation RocketMotorTwo engine is a variant of the earlier SNC basic design. It experimented with using a polyamide plastic fuel and nitrous oxide oxidizer in 2014, but switched back to using its original hydroxyl- terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) fuel and liquid nitrous oxide oxidizer in 2015. The second-generation engine is now made in-house by Virgin Galactic rather than by SNC. Description RocketMotorTwo is a hybrid rocket engine utilizing solid hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) fuel and liquid nitrous oxide oxidizer ‚Äì sometimes referred to as an N2O/HTPB motor ‚Äì providing of thrust. The design makes use of lessons learned during the development of the SpaceShipOne hybrid rocket motor. Background , Sierra Nevada had performed over 300 hybrid rocket test firings. The company also developed the rocket engine for the first private spacecraft to reach space, SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X-Prize in 2004. Sierra Nevada is also developing a similar hybrid engine, the Dream Chaser rocket engine. History=Related test program accident On 26 July 2007, during the early vehicle subsystem testing phase, an explosion occurred during a propellant flow test by Scaled Composites at the Mojave Air and Space Port. The test included filling the oxidizer tank with of nitrous oxide, followed by a 15-second cold flow injector test. The test did not ignite the engine and no solid rocket fuel was involved. Three Scaled employees were killed and three injured, two critically and one seriously, by flying shrapnel when the nitrous oxide oxidizer spontaneously ignited and exploded (dissociation into N2 and O components, releasing energy).Abdollah, Tami and Silverstein, Stuart (27 July 2007). \\"Test Site Explosion Kills Three\\".

News reports in early 2009 reported that the hot fire tests had been \\"completed\\" and that Spacedev (later acquired by Sierra Nevada Corporation) had been contracted by Scaled Composites to assist Scaled in developing SS2. By December 2011, 21 full-scale hot-fire ground tests had been carried out on RocketMotorTwo. \\"Virgin Galactic successfully completes SpaceShipTwo glide flight test and rocket motor firing on same day\\". SpaceRef.com. 28 June 2012. Retrieved 19 May 2013. On 20 June 2012, the first hot-fire test under the control of SpaceShipTwo's proprietary Rocket Motor Controller (RMC) was successfully conducted. =Extended delays in flight testing= Despite statements in early 2009 that flight testing of RocketMotorTwo was planned for later in 2009, no flight tests took place in 2009, 2010 or 2011, and only glide flight tests‚Äîwith the engine installed in SS2‚Äîoccurred in 2012. In July 2012, Virgin Galactic, the owner of VSS Enterprise ‚Äì the first SpaceShipTwo spaceplane built ‚Äì announced that RocketMotorTwo was fully qualified for powered flight, and that the ground test program was substantially complete. SpaceShipTwo conducted its first gliding test flight with the engine fully installed in December 2012. Additional ground rocket tests continued into March 2013 as the company prepared for powered test flights. VSS Enterprise conducted its first powered flight on 29 April 2013, marking the first flight test of RocketMotorTwo. The test was a 16-second burn as planned, and was ignited at an altitude of , shortly after Enterprise was released from its WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft and the pilots cross-checked data and verified stable control. The RM2 control system opened the main oxidizer valve and fired the igniters inside the fuel case. The burn was completed at an altitude of , by which point Enterprise was supersonic, achieving . SNC stated after the test that \\"The rocket motor ignition went as planned, with the expected burn duration, [and] good engine performance.\\" =2014 change of engine= In May 2014, Virgin Galactic announced a change to the hybrid engine to be used in SpaceShipTwo, and took the development effort in-house, terminating the contract with Sierra Nevada and halting all development on the first-generation rocket engine. Second- generation engine The engineering and development work of the second- generation engine was done in-house, by Virgin Galactic. The work began on the new formulation for the hybrid engine in 2013, and by May 2014‚Äîwhen SNC's involvement with SS2 propulsion using the first-generation rocket motor was ended‚Äîthe new engine formulation had already completed full-duration burns of over 60 seconds in ground tests on an engine test stand. =New fuel formulation= Rather than use rubber-based HTPB in the solid portion of the hybrid rocket motor‚Äîwhich had experienced serious engine stability issues on firings longer than approximately 20 seconds with the first-generation engine‚Äîthe Virgin Galactic-developed SS2 hybrid rocket engine would now use thermoplastic polyamide (i.e., nylon) as the solid fuel component of the propellant. The plastic fuel was projected to have better performance (by several unspecified measures) and was expected to allow SpaceShipTwo to make flights to a higher altitude. =Related airframe and subsystem modifications to support the new engine= The second-generation engine design also required the modification to the SS2 airframe to fit additional tanks in the wings of SpaceShipTwo‚Äîone holding methane and the other containing helium‚Äîin order to ensure a proper burn of the new engine. =Ground test regime= Even though Virgin Galactic has run a number of ground tests on the new engine by May 2014, it was stated then that four additional ground tests of the polyamide-fueled engine were anticipated before the SpaceShipTwo flight tests could resume with the new-fuel rocket motor. =PF04 flight test malfunction= On 31 October 2014, the new polyamide engine fuel formulation was used in flight for the first time in the powered test flight no. 4 (PF04) of SpaceShipTwo. At 10:12am PDT, VSS Enterprise suffered a malfunction, and subsequently broke up in mid-flight. The inflight mishap resulted in the death of one test pilot and a \\"serious shoulder injury\\" to the other test pilot, and a total loss of the vehicle.Mojave Air and Space Port press conference on October 31, 2014, at 2:00 p.m. PDT ‚Äî involving: the Spaceport, Sheriff's Department, County Fire Department, Scaled Composites, Virgin Galactic The accident investigation revealed that the \\"ship‚Äôs fuel tanks and its engine were recovered intact, indicating there was no explosion ... no signs of burn- through, no signs of being breached\\".
