A cyber manhunt generally involves netizens and is regarded as the purpose of a cyber judgment to the target through blaming, shaming, and naming culprits.  Background  A Cyber manhunt is developed from the word ‚Äòmanhunt‚Äô. A manhunt is a way of searching background information of an objective person. The term is broadly used by the police and media. Manhunts were limited during the use of traditional media in the 1990s because of technological constraints. However, cyber manhunts became popular in the 21st century. It gained popularity on the ‚ÄòHong Kong Golden Forum‚Äô and thus spread to other social media websites. The emergence of cyber manhunts was led by the common practice of sharing individual photographs and information on social networks. Owing to the exploitation of cyberspace technology, more and more free social networking websites appear nowadays, (i.e. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) People are then more willing to share their daily lives on the web. This trend highly raises the accessibility of various internet users to one's personal information. As it gets easier to find people's personal details on the web, it leads to the present prevalence of cyber manhunts. People tend to put forward public trials through cyber manhunts. When there are immoral or unfair scenes that might not be handled by law enforcement, such as the ‚Äô14-slaps- girl‚Äô and the ‚ÄòBus Uncle‚Äô, citizens utilize cyber manhunts to raise public attention. It provides a way for victims to seek justice through the internet and also plays a role in monitoring, as people will be careful of their behaviors in public to avoid themselves being shamed on the internet. Method  Application of search engine  One of the methods is to make use of search engines to obtain the information of people. Netizens search the target by using multitudes of search engines, including Yahoo, Google, Baidu, Sogou, etc. They type the keywords or the name of the target into the search engines to find related websites, for instance, the social networking sites, private blogs, and albums of the target. They can obtain the target's private information by visiting those websites. Eventually, they would post and show the information they get to the public through the internet.  Browsing public online platforms  Moreover, there are columns in public online platforms called the ‚ÄòColumn for betraying friends‚Äô. Netizens usually post the private information and photos of their friends in these columns. For instance: telephone numbers, emails, addresses, etc. Other netizens would browse these columns and obtain information. Some of them even criticize targets in columns, causing cyber bullying.  Purpose   Expression of dissatisfaction  Cyber manhunt gives the netizens a good channel to let off their anger and dissatisfaction with the society and social phenomenon. Once an undesirable subject is posted on the internet, it can easily trigger or anger netizens. For instance, ‚ÄúKong girl 500‚Äù rejected people to come to her wedding with $500 for a blessing on her Facebook. She has exposed most of her personal information and wedding location on the internet. It reveals the dissatisfaction of netizen toward ‚ÄúKong girl‚Äù and money worship.  Acquisition of satisfaction  People have the desire for discourse power which they are not given in traditional media while able to get in the cyberspace. Dennis Wong, the Professor of Applied Social Sciences of City University, indicated that cyber manhunt is a behavior that wishes own happiness and satisfaction by causing pain to others. He explained that some netizens obtain happiness and satisfaction via a cyber manhunt, and some of them will even see it as a network game to increase their sense of identity if they can find more information than others.  Sense of justice  Some cyber manhunt was motivated by the sense of justice and some of the netizens use cyber manhunt as a punishment for the individuals who act inappropriately or immorally. There exist many examples of cyber manhunt about moral and ethical issues. For example, some animal abusers have been arrested because of the power of cyber manhunt.  Influences   Influences on victims  Victims who suffer trauma from cyber manhunts may leave an indelible imprint worrying about what people browse to them. They are also at risk of getting mental and psychological damage. Also, a common thing to happen to victims is that they would continuously search the situation on the internet and know how the event goes on. It deteriorates victims‚Äô mental health and may even stimulate them to commit suicide.  Influences on netizens  Some netizens may also endure emotional distress and fear of becoming the next target of cyber manhunt. They do not need to be consciously responsible for their actions. Therefore, they may criticize others easily. When the cyber manhunt occurs in an uncontrolled situation, some netizens would dread to be the next target.  Related law  The netizens who involve in cyber manhunt or explore other's private information without permission may violate the following laws.  Universal declaration of human rights  No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.  Personal Data Ordinance  According to the Personal Data Ordinance which was enacted in 2012, a person commits an offense if the person discloses any personal data of a data subject which was obtained from a data user without the data user's consent, with an intent to cause loss or gain in other property or cause harm to the data subject. The netizen will commit an offense if they disclose one's private information on the internet without consent. However, Joe Lam, the chief executive officer of Discussion forum points out that it is hard to the law like the speed of communication on the internet is too fast and it is hard to determine if there has been any contravention as Cyber manhunt always involve countless netizens.

Early life and education George Edward Dorris was born into a prominent family in Eugene, Oregon, the son of Benjamin Fultz Dorris and Klysta (Cornet) Dorris.\\"Dorris, George,\\" in Who's Who in America (New Providence, N.J.: Marquis Who's Who, 2015). In 1892, his great-uncle George Dorris had purchased a farm in Springfield, about five miles for Eugene, and had experimented with various crops before establishing a hazelnut orchard in 1905. The mild weather, abundance of rain, and well-drained soil of the Willamette Valley provided ideal conditions for growing nut trees. Over the next fifty years the Dorris Ranch, as the farm was known, was enlarged, as Ben Dorris joined his uncle and developed the property to some seventy-five acres with a nursery and thousands of trees.Sofia McDonald Bennett, \\"Harvesting Hazelnuts at Dorris Ranch,\\" The Local Dish, http://thelocaldish.com/harvesting-hazelnuts-dorris-ranch. Retrieved March 16, 2015. Young George Dorris was not, however, interested in a career in the nut industry, being more attracted to languages and literature than to agriculture. Accordingly, after graduation from high school in 1948, he studied Spanish and English literature at the University of Oregon in Eugene. Upon receiving his bachelor of arts degree a year early, he spent a year working in San Francisco, where he had opportunities to attend concerts, plays, and performances of opera and ballet. Thereafter, he enrolled in the graduate school of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, to pursue his studies in Restoration and eighteenth-century English literature. In his second year he was awarded a university fellowship that paid his tuition and living expenses, and in 1955 he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship for study in Italy. After some months there, he returned to Northwestern as a graduate assistant in the Department of English. While finishing his doctoral dissertation on poet, librettist, and translator Paolo Antonio Rolli (1687-1765) and the Italian circle in London, he took his first teaching jobs and was finally awarded a doctoral degree in 1962. Academic career Before completing his dissertation, Dorris began his professional career as an instructor of English literature at Duke University in North Carolina (1957-1960). He then moved on to Rutgers University in New Jersey (1960-1962), the University of the Pacific and its constituent Raymond College in California (1962-1964), and to Queen's College of the City University of New York (1964-1967). The remainder of his teaching career (1967-1998) was spent at York College, also a component of the City University of New York. There he rose from assistant professor to associate professor of English literature, teaching courses in Restoration and eighteenth-century drama, poetry, and prose as well as occasional courses in criticism and dance history. In February 1965, after attending a performance of New York City Ballet, Dorris had the good fortune to meet the poet Jack Anderson, who was then working at Dance Magazine. Dorris had long been interested in dance, having seen programs presented by American Ballet Theater, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, the Royal Ballet of London, and the Martha Graham Dance Company. His interest in dance history increased upon meeting Anderson, who, along with their friend George Jackson, was also writing for the English magazine Ballet Today. In his academic field, Dorris had found that there was \\"not much new to say about John Dryden or Alexander Pope,\\" but he came to realize that \\"there were enormous areas of dance just waiting to be discovered.\\"George Dorris, script for From the Horse's Mouth: Magical Tales of Real Dancers, a program conceived and directed by Tina Croll and Jamie Cunningham, premiered at the Theater of the 14th Street Y, New York City, January 2013, and later presented at Pace University and at Buddies in Bad Times in Toronto, Canada,. In personal files of Croll and Cunningham in the Jerome Robbins Dance Division, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Avocation as dance historian Following the lead of Anderson and Jackson, Dorris soon began contributing occasional reviews of dance performances to Ballet Today. Then, at a party in 1966, he met Arlene Croce, who had recently founded a magazine called Ballet Review, and he joined the ranks of its early contributors, thus beginning a long, distinguished career as a dance historian. He was encouraged in his endeavors by Selma Jeanne Cohen, a leading light in dance scholarship, who became a lifelong mentor and friend. Beginning in 1967, Dorris served for ten years as music editor for Ballet Review, and, eventually, as its regular reviewer of musical recordings (1993‚Äìpresent). In 1975, he joined the board of directors of Dance Perspectives Foundation as secretary, serving in that capacity until 1981. In 1977, Dorris and Anderson were the founding editors of Dance Chronicle: Studies in Dance and Related Arts, a journal published by Marcel Dekker that became the acknowledged leader in the field of dance scholarship. They continued to produce several issues a year‚Äîfour at first, then three‚Äîuntil 2007, when they relinquished their roles to younger scholars.See Dance Chronicle, Taylor and Francis Online, http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journals. During these years, Dorris was also active in several professional organizations focused on dance history and criticism. In 1978, he was a founding member of the Society of Dance History Scholars, for which he served on the board of directors (1979-1983, 1990-1993) and on the editorial board (2001-2004). He also served on the board of directors of the Dance Critics Association (1980-1983, 1996-1999) and the World Dance Alliance (1991-2012) and was a longtime member of the Congress on Research in Dance. He had a significant effect on the policies and direction of all these organizations, helping each one to move forward toward its stated goals. In 1981, Selma Jeanne Cohen invited Dorris to become an associate editor of the International Encyclopedia of Dance, a major undertaking of the Dance Perspectives Foundation. As the area editor for dance from 1400 to 1800 and for Western music, he worked on the project for many years, until its successful publication in 1998.After failing during development at two academic publishing houses, Charles Scribner's Sons and the University of California Press, this encyclopedia was published by Oxford University Press (USA) in New York City. Soon after, he was invited to become one of a group of principal researchers for Popular Balanchine, a project of the George Balanchine Foundation devoted to documenting Mr. Balanchine's work on Broadway shows and Hollywood films, He completed his research on the operettas Rosalinda (1942) and The Merry Widow (1943) in 2002.George Balanchine Foundation, Popular Balanchine, http://balanchine.org/balanchine/03/pc.

He served successively as the head of the region's Public Security Department, Vice- Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Vice-Chairman of the regional political advisory body. Zhao was also a writer. He was arrested by police in the eastern Inner Mongolian city of Chifeng in March 2015 on charges of intentional homicide. He was the first known provincial-level official to be convicted of murder in the history of the People's Republic of China. He was executed in 2017.  Life and career  Zhao was born and raised in Yutian County, Hebei. Zhao entered Inner Mongolia Radio & TV University in September 1982, majoring in Chinese language, where he graduated in October 1985. He went down to the countryside in Jilin province, before taking on a job as a worker at a printing factory. He also studied at Chinese People's Public Security University, Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, and PLA National Defense University as a part-time student. During the Cultural Revolution, he was a sent-down youth performing manual labour in Horqin Left Middle Banner, Jilin province. He worked for the police force and over a period of 40 years worked his way up to head the Public Security Department of Inner Mongolia, essentially the region's police chief. During his term as police chief, he instituted programs to speed up response times to emergency calls, and vowed to shorten wait times to \\"30 seconds within the city, one minute in the suburbs, and as fast a possible in the rural regions.\\" As regional police chief, Zhao also concurrently became Vice-Chairman of Inner Mongolia Government in May 2010, and was re-elected in February 2012. In July 2012 he was appointed the Vice-Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a mostly ceremonial position he held until January 2013, when he retired. When he departed his position as regional police chief, he was given a standing ovation from his police colleagues that lasted several minutes. Zhao also had a moderately successful career as a writer, authoring lengthy novels, poems, and award-winning screenplays. He penned works in a wide range of topics, from murder mysteries to his recollections of trips to Hong Kong and Russia. His profile was featured on the China Writer's Association; he has been a member of the association since 2008.  Murder investigation  On March 20, 2015, at approximately 9:30 pm in the city of Chifeng, Zhao was driving a black Audi sedan with Ordos license plates pursuing a white vehicle with a woman inside. The woman, surnamed Li, was born in 1988 and was 27 years old at the time of the incident, and reportedly had \\"intimate relations\\" with Zhao. The woman had called the emergency police number 110 that day, saying \\"Zhao Liping is out to kill me,\\" before hanging up abruptly. Zhao was said to have caught up with the woman inside the Baihe Xincheng () residential neighbourhood of Chifeng and shot the woman in the head, killing her, then put her corpse in the trunk of his car. Zhao then allegedly proceeded to a local garbage dump where he attempted to bury her body amid mounds of rubbish. It was said that ten hours earlier, Zhao had visited the dump, ostensibly to plan for the murder. It was unclear how Zhao obtained a gun, as it was illegal for retired police officers to carry firearms. In the early morning of March 21, Zhao was detained by police in Heshigten Banner. On March 22, Zhao was arrested on suspicion of murder. Zhao did not resist arrest and reportedly still carried blood stains at the time of his arrest. Zhao was the 100th high-ranking \\"tiger\\" (officials of sub-provincial level and above) being investigated or charged with a crime since the anti-corruption campaign in China began in 2012, though initially he was not being investigated for corruption, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) took up his case anyway, as a separate investigation from the murder charge. A former subordinate of Zhao said about his crimes, \\"he was a great guy, not arrogant at all. He was calm, truthful, self-assured. It perplexes me what made him do such a stupid thing.\\"  Conviction and execution  On July 31, 2015, upon the completion of the investigation by the CCDI, Zhao Liping was expelled from the Communist Party. The investigation concluded that Zhao used the conveniences of his office to aid in the promotion and business activities of associates, and \\"illegally possessed bullets and guns\\", \\"severely violated socialist morality by engaging in adultery\\", and took bribes. Zhao pleaded not guilty. On November 11, 2016, Zhao was convicted on charges of intentional homicide, taking bribes, abuse of power, and illegal possession of firearms, and sentenced by the Taiyuan Intermediate People's Court to death. Zhao appealed the decision. The Shanxi People's High Court rejected the appeal and upheld the sentence, which was reviewed by the Supreme People's Court. Zhao was the first official of sub- provincial level or above to be sentenced to death since Xi Jinping took power in 2012. He was executed on May 26, 2017.

This behaviour, as much as we can observe, is exceptionally common in Hong Kong. The selfie studio allows customers to take group selfies with 2-10 people. It turns the solo activity into an opportunity for people to gather with their friends. The quality of the selfie shoots in studios with lighting and professional cameras are better than those taken with mobile phones.

He is known for his work Coelum philosophorum seu de secretis naturae liber (Fribourg, 1525), a major work of early modern distillation technology. The Coelum philosophorum contains extracts from Arnald of Villanova, Ramon Llull, Albertus Magnus, and John of Rupescissa. It saw numerous editions, including translations into German (Strasbourg, 1527) and French (Paris, 1546). He was particularly influenced by John of Rupescissa and his work on the quintessence and its use in medicine. However, he did not believe the quintessence to be incorruptible, as did Rupescissa, but rather far less corruptible than the other four elements. Ulstad distanced himself from the philosophical strands of alchemy, and focused on the technical aspects, which he wanted to make accessible to apothecaries, doctors, and other practitioners. He described the preparation of the quintessence from plants, minerals, metals (gold, among others) and referred to medical applications throughout. He also authored a short text on the plague (De epidemia tractatus). Little is known of his life outside of his published work.  Works  * De epidemia tractatus.

The Externsteine are located near Detmold, now in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia but in the Middle Ages in the Duchy of Saxony.

Das Relief an den Externsteinen. Ein karolingisches Kunstwerk und sein spiritueller Hintergrund. Ostfildern 1997. Description The relief measures 4.8 m high by 3.7 m wide. It is divided into three parts, or registers. The largest, central register shows the Descent from the Cross scene itself. At the center is the cross, to the right is a figure identified as Nicodemus. The legs of this figure have been lost since at least the 17th century, but it is shown at an elevated position, aiding in the recovery of Jesus' body from the cross. The figure was standing on a supporting structure (identified either as a plant bent by Nicodemus' weight, or as a chair). Nicodemus lowers the body of Jesus towards Joseph of Arimathea, who is standing to the left of the cross. To the left of Joseph is the figure of Mary, Mother of Jesus (the head of this figure has been lost), with her hand supporting the head of her son's corpse. Opposite Mary, on the right side of the scene, is John the Apostle, holding a book. The upper register shows the torso of the ascended Christ wearing a cross halo and a victory flag. Alongside the flag, the figure is holding a small representation of a human figure with raised hands. To the left and right, anthropomorphic representations of Sun and Moon are shown, holding drapes. The lower register shows two kneeling figures, a naked bearded man and a clothed figure of undetermined sex, both of them caught in the coils of the neck and tail of a two-legged, winged dragon. These figures were variously identified as Adam and Eve (representing the fallen state of man in general), or as a Saxon warrior and priest. Dating Goethe writing in 1824 identified the relief as a work of the Carolingian period. In the same year Karl Theodor Menke dated it to the 12th century.Karl Theodor Menke: Lage, Ursprung, Namen, Beschreibung, Altherthum, Mythus und Geschichte der Extersteine. Coppenrathsche Buch- und Kunsthandlung, M√ºnster o.J. (1824; reprinted 1981). Art historians of the later 19th and early 20th century tended to support Goethe's view of an early date of origin, but a re-examination of the evidence by a team of art historians in 1950 resulted in a shift of communis opinio towards a high medieval date. The view of the relief as of Carolingian date remains a minority position, especially popular by authors who would like to identify the \\"plant-like\\" structure as a representation of Irminsul, e.g. in a 1997 anthroposophical publication.Walther Matthes, Rolf Speckner: Das Relief an den Externsteinen. Ein karolingisches Kunstwerk und sein spiritueller Hintergrund. edition tertium, Ostfildern vor Stuttgart 1997. Today, the consensus remains that the relief probably dates to 1160/70.

Moisil (December 8, 1876-October 22, 1958) was an Austro- Hungarian-born Romanian archivist, historian, numismatist and schoolteacher. Born in NƒÉsƒÉud, in the Transylvania region, his grandfather Grigore Moisil was a priest; his father Constantin Gr. Moisil, who had a doctorate from the University of Vienna, was a teacher; and his uncle was the teacher and writer Iuliu Moisil.Michelson, p. 150 He attended primary school in his native town, followed by the local high school.Seni and Seni, p. 47 He then enrolled in the history section of the literature faculty at the University of Bucharest, in the Romanian Old Kingdom.Seni and Seni, p. 47-8 His research interests centered on original or unusual aspects, a direction borrowed from his professors, who included Nicolae Iorga, Dimitrie Onciul and V. A. Urechia. This was reflected as early as his undergraduate thesis, on prehistoric archaeology. In particular, his inclination toward archaeology was initiated by his professor Grigore Tocilescu. After graduating in 1898, he taught high school in Foc»ôani (1898-1899), in Tulcea (1899-1910) and finally in Bucharest, at Matei Basarab High School.Michelson, p. 151 In 1905, he began regular contributions on a variety of subjects to Convorbiri Literare, among other magazines. His return to Bucharest coincided with his becoming assistant at the Romanian Academy's newly established numismatics section, a subject in which his interest had grown during his Tulcea years. This passion had brought him into contact with another numismatist, Dimitrie Sturdza, who helped engineer Moisil's hiring by the Academy. Moisil would become head of the section in 1933, holding the post until his death. He joined the Romanian Numismatic Society in 1913 and became editor of its bulletin. In 1920, he began editing another one of its publications, and he ascended to its presidency in 1933, remaining in the position until he died. As president, he held annual congresses between 1933 and 1937. He was the first to classify Geto-Dacian money, and extensively studied medieval Romanian coins.Michelson, p. 152 In 1924, twenty-six years after earning his undergraduate degree, he received his doctorate at Cluj University. The topic of his dissertation was the Wallachian mint under the House of Basarab. He published this work partly as a result of his experience at the numismatics section, and it appears to have been Romania's first doctorate dealing with numismatics. Moisil was elected a corresponding member of the Academy in June 1919, upon the proposal of Vasile P√¢rvan. He headed the National Archives of Romania from 1923 to 1938.Michelson, p. 157 His appointment as head took place in the autumn of 1923, and was somewhat surprising given his almost entire lack of publications in archivistics. Onciul, the archives' director from 1900 to 1923, had died earlier in the year. Initially succeeded by Alexandru Lapedatu, a replacement had to be found when the latter soon resigned to become Religious Affairs and Arts Minister. Moisil was selected after receiving favorable recommendations from the country's universities and from specialists. He started the country's first archival journal, Revista Arhivelor. The first volume's first number appeared in 1924, and by the time the first volume concluded in 1926,Michelson, p. 153 the publication had attracted contributions from Nicolae Iorga, Ioan Lupa»ô, Ilie Minea, Petre P. Panaitescu, Ioan C. Filitti, Dan Simonescu, Emil V√¢rtosu, Paul Gore, »òtefan Mete»ô, Sever Zotta and Mihai CostƒÉchescu.Michelson, p. 156 The magazine's initial run ended 1947, and covered seven volumes in fifteen numbers.Michelson, p. 158 Moisil advocated a new legal statute for the archives, one that would both take into account the realities of an enlarged Greater Romania and the damage that Romanian archives had undergone during World War I. The law, which he largely inspired, was passed by the Romanian Parliament in May 1925. It provided for a central archive in Bucharest, with regional directorates at Ia»ôi, Cluj, CernƒÉu»õi and Chi»ôinƒÉu. He drew up plans for the country's first school for training archivists, which opened under his direction in 1924 and reached university level in 1932. By mid-1924, he had opened an exhibition space at the archives, which became a permanent museum of the institution's rare holdings in 1926. As director, he published over 570 studies, including 42 in history, 93 in archaeology, 160 in numismatics, 41 on medals, 22 on seals, 4 in metrology and 15 in didactics, as well as works on heraldry.Seni and Seni, p. 48 In August 1948, following a purge of the old members by the new Communist regime, he became a titular member of the Academy.

Originally RAF Boreham, with the facility released from military control, in 1946, the West Essex Car Club developed the 4.76 kilometre perimeter track for motor racing. Although not on the official Grand Prix calendar, Boreham Circuit hosted competitive races between 1949 and 1952. Among the teams that raced at Boreham were BRM, Connaught, Frazer Nash, and Talbot-Lago. Among the drivers who raced there were Mike Hawthorn, Stirling Moss, and Ken Wharton. In 1955 the Ford Motor Company bought the airfield to use as a test facility for trucks, as well as the base for their Competitions Department where they prepared their cars. In the late 1970s Boreham Proving Ground was the test site for Ford Heavy Truck Development. The development engineers at nearby Ford Dunton worked out various test programmes, and the Test Engineers at Boreham carried these out and reported back the data. One common test was RLD, or 'Road Load Data', where a chassis would be fitted with various strain gauges, and the data from these recorded. This was the main test site for Ford Trucks, and the Ford Cargo, released in 1980, was extensively tested here against competitor trucks. There were many various surfaces at Boreham to drive the trucks on. \\"Rest of the World\\" road, was a fairly rigorous route, with smooth surfaces, some undulating surfaces and some pot-holes. \\"Korean Road\\" was full of pot-holes and considered to be the worst test for a truck.

Like Ham's debut novel The Dressmaker, it is also set in small rural community but in 1890s Australia. The novel centred on protagonist Phoeba Crupp and her struggle with money and male companionship. Ham also wrote this novel like her debut one while studying her creative writing course at RMIT University. The novel was first published by Duffy & Snellgrove on June 1, 2005. It was later re-published on January 9, 2010. Setting and themes Mount Hope area, where novel is set. The novel is set in small rural Australian community at Mount Hope located to the north of Pyramid Hill in northern Victoria, Australia. The town is set between Melbourne and Geelong in the year 1894, during the period of drought and depression. The novel explores a number of themes from pastoralists and squatters, to itinerants and suffragettes campaigning for women's rights, and the advent of new technology. But like Ham's first novel, it also focused on gossip and privations in small communities and their effects. Plot In 1894, Phoeba Crupp is an independent woman who does not pay any attention to her mother and sister's concern of getting married, while her father is completely focused on his vineyard. Phoeba is content to spend her time with her best friends Hadley and Henrietta, until she is forced into a world of men and money.

Reception The novel was largely compared to Jane Austen's work and especially her 1813 novel Pride and Prejudice by many critics. The Sydney Morning Herald comparing it to Austin's work said \\"Summer at Mount Hope bears a passing resemblance to the Jane Austen oeuvre insofar as there are daughters to be married and eligible bachelors to be found.\\" But finally said that \\"(it) is more unabashed romance set against a backdrop of grapes, dust and drought than a historical document. This is light summer reading; a period-drama with the requisite sunny, fluffy- cloud ending.\\" Gillian Mary Dooley in a review for \\"Writers‚Äô Radio\\" a radio program by Radio Adelaide said that \\"There are so many echoes of Pride and Prejudice in this novel that it‚Äôs hard to believe they‚Äôre not deliberate.\\" But ultimately concluded that \\"it is an engaging novel with likeable and plausible characters living in a world created with intelligence, imagination, humour and verve.\\" Peter Pierce of The Bulletin said, \\"The novel is a delight. Complex beneath its witty surface, and one of the surprising fictional treats of the year.\\" While Liam Davidson in his review titled \\"Jane Austen Meets Steele Rudd\\" for The Australian said \\"While it‚Äôs the social and romantic intrigue that carries the story, it‚Äôs Ham‚Äôs wickedly black humour and finely researched social observation that deliver the real joy of the book.\\" References External links * Duffy & Snellgrove * Rosalie Ham's official website Category:2005 Australian novels Category:Duffy & Snellgrove books Category:Black comedy books Category:Romance novels ","title":"Summer at Mount Hope"},{"id":"46196177","text":"Petre Ion Gheorghe (also known as Petre Ivan Gheorghieff or Gheorghiev;Burcea, p.309, 319-320 March 19, 1907 ‚Äì February 8, 1943) was a Bulgarian-born Romanian communist and anti-fascist resistance member, executed by Romania for espionage and treason. Having risen through the ranks of the Union of Communist Youth, he was the leader of the strongest communist resistance group during the first part of World War II in Romania.Burcea, p.307 Of lowly origins, the largely self-educated Gheorghe spent the 1930s as a political agitator and organizer of social protest movements, for which he served several terms in prison. After 1940, with most of the Romanian Communist Party leadership either jailed or exiled, Gheorghe emerged as a prominent figure in the Bucharest party cell. He took part in the political infighting that split the party, and also involved himself in the anti-fascist resistance before being arrested, tried, and executed. Following the end of World War II, with the emergence and consolidation of a communist regime, the dominant \\"prison faction\\" cited Gheorghe's case as evidence of betrayal by the Bucharest party cell. The deposed General Secretary, »òtefan Fori»ô, was kidnapped and investigated for his alleged role in this affair. Biography Early life and political beginnings Petre Ion Gheorghe was born in Dobrich, Southern Dobruja, to a poor family of Bulgarian peasants who practiced Bulgarian Orthodoxy.Burcea, p.309 His father, Ivan Georgiev (later: Gheorghiev), was a blacksmith and his mother, Ivanova Kaluda, was a homemaker. Petre had two other brothers, Sebe Ivanof and Ion, as well as a sister, Ivanka. Following the 1913 Second Balkan War, Dobrich became part of Romania and renamed to Bazargic. After graduating four primary classes in a private Bulgarian school in his hometown, at the age of 10, Petre started to work as a newspaper hawker. His parents enrolled him in the local high school, however, lacking financial means, Petre had to renounce his studies. He was hired as a carpenter apprentice, but gave up following the death of his father, and began work at a local construction company.Burcea, p.310 Gheorghe learned about communism by reading, as a teenager, the classics of Marxism. In 1925, at the age of 18, he contacted the youth movement of the then-illegal Communist Party (PCdR), and organized several Marxist circles for \\"the education of youth\\". In 1927, he also joined the Dobrujan Revolutionary Organization (DRO), a Bulgarian insurgent group, and two years later he became a member of its Caliacra County committee.Burcea, p.311 A year later, he was enrolled into the Union of Communist Youth.Burcea, p.314 Conscripted in 1929, Gheorghe served his military stage at the Railroads Regiment in Ia»ôi, where he continued his propaganda work, which resulted in his being ordered to the disciplinary barracks on numerous occasions.Burcea, p.315 After his return to Bazargic in 1930, he carried on with his political activity, a member of county committee of the Union of Communist Youth and an editor of the local Dobrujan newspaper T√¢nƒÉrul Bol≈üevic (\\"Young Bolshevik\\"). Communist Youth militant On August 1, 1931, prompted by the world economic crisis, Communist Youth activists staged protests across the country. Gheorghe was one of the protest leaders in Bazargic, and found himself detained by police. After four days in custody, he appeared before the Caliacra Tribunal, and was cleared of all charges. Later that year, Gheorghe crossed into the Soviet Union as a delegate to the 5th Congress of the PCdR in Moscow. There, he spoke about Dobruja's oppressed peasantry, also informing the party about the fraud and political repression during the previous elections.Burcea, p.316-317 In April 1932, the PCdR cell in Bucharest provided the Dobruja chapter subversive brochures and illegal newspapers, including Sc√¢nteia and T√¢nƒÉrul Leninist (\\"The Young Leninist\\"), storing them in three suitcases.Burcea, p.319 The whole operation was being followed by Siguran»õa, the secret police, which proceeded to arrest Petre Gheorghe and his colleague, a Bogdan Vasilef Pavloff. Gheorghe refused to collaborate with the authorities. He was convicted to 15 days in jail for spreading communist propaganda.Burcea, p.320 After he was released from the penitentiary in Constan»õa, Gheorghe moved back to Ia»ôi, tasked with putting out an illegal printing press and the newspaper T√¢nƒÉrul Muncitor (\\"Young Worker\\"). During the Grivi»õa Strike of 1933, Gheorghe coordinated solidarity protests in both BacƒÉu and Buhu»ôi, collecting money and aid for the striking workers.Burcea, p.322 He was again arrested on the night of October 4/5, 1933 in Chi»ôinƒÉu, Bessarabia, charged with having spread communist agitprop. He was court-martialed and convicted to 3 months in prison, 5 years loss of civil rights, and a 500-lei fine (later commuted to a 10-day prison sentence). He was freed on April 24, 1935, after having served his time in Caliacra Penitentiary.Burcea, p.323 He then settled in Bucharest, where he was named Secretary of the Central Committee of the Union of Communist Youth. For the next two years, Gheorghe was able to evade Siguran»õa and create anti-fascist committees in Grivi»õa's CFR Workshops, as well as in Voina ≈üi Lema√Ætre factories.Burcea, p.324 As the Romanian delegate to the Young Communist International Congress in 1936, he was arrested in the Czechoslovakian city of Ko≈°ice, and expelled from that country following several weeks in prison. Shortly after returning to Romania, the PCdR opted to disband the Communist Youth, with scores of its members having been exposed and arrested. Gheorghe wrote a letter to the leadership of the party, whereby he voiced his displeasure. Returning to Bazargic, he attempted to mobilize the workers to start striking actions. He was again conscripted and spent the year 1939 in a military unit in Gala»õi, but returned in 1940 to lead the PCdR regional committee in Dobruja.Burcea, p.325 Trial and execution After the cession of Bessarabia to the Soviets, Romania's secret services embarked on a full- scale repression of communists activists and sympathizers. Many of them were arrested and sent to prison camps such as the one in Miercurea Ciuc. This consolidated a \\"prison faction\\" of the party, under Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, but cut the party loose from its contacts with Comintern sponsors. Still working underground as a secretary of the Bucharest party bureau, Gheorghe sided with Gheorghiu-Dej and Emil BodnƒÉra»ô, maneuvering against the General Secretary, »òtefan Fori»ô.TismƒÉneanu, p.105, 119 The two sides of this internecine conflict accused each other of being spies for the Siguran»õa.TismƒÉneanu, p.119, 322 Gheorghe was himself arrested by 1941, when Romania entered World War II as a Nazi ally. As with many other military trials of the period, his took one day, that of August 6, 1942.Burcea, p.369 The trial, reportedly masterminded by the Gestapo,TismƒÉneanu, p.322 was held at the court-martial of Ploie»ôti, presided upon by Lieutenant-Colonel Cristea Manea. According to a 1957 biography, the trial took only 5 minutes and the accused were denied legal counsel.Burcea, p.371 Petre Gheorghe and Nicolae Atanasoff were found guilty of \\"crime against the state's security\\", being sentenced to capital punishment‚Äîas had been requested by the military prosecutor, Major P. P√¢rvƒÉnescu.Burcea, p.370 The accused were then held at the Ploie»ôti Penitentiary. Their appeals for clemency were denied, as was a request for pardon that they sent to King Michael I.Burcea, p.372-373 Gheorghe was scheduled to be executed on February 8, 1943. As the minutes of his execution show, he yelled \\"Down with war\\", \\"Long live Free Romania\\" and obscene words addressed to the Germans.Burcea, p.376 He was then blindfolded and shot by an execution squad. According to an eyewitness, Gheorghe and Atanasoff were laid in coffins prepared beforehand, and buried under headstones which carried the text: \\"Executed as communists fighting against our fatherland in the interest of Bolshevism\\".Burcea, p.380 By summer 1944, with Romania losing the war on the Eastern Front, Gheorghiu-Dej reemerged from prison to assist in the anti-fascist coup. He also staged a party coup, kidnapping Fori»ô and other members of the 1940 Secretariat. At the party trial that followed this event, Fori»ô and Remus Koffler were charged with having betrayed Gheorghe. Gheorghe's remains were moved in 1967 in the mausoleum in Carol Park, together with the remains of other \\"revolutionary fighters\\". The necropolis was disbanded in 1991, some months after the Romanian anti- communist revolution. The whereabouts of his remains is unknown.Burcea, p.384 Notes References * * Category:1907 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Romanian communists Category:Romanian propagandists Category:Marxist journalists Category:Romanian newspaper editors Category:Romanian newspaper founders Category:Romanian Land Forces personnel Category:Romanian World War II resistance members Category:People executed by Romania by firing squad Category:People executed by the Kingdom of Romania Category:Romanian people of Bulgarian descent Category:People from Dobrich Category:People executed for treason ","title":"Petre Gheorghe"},{"id":"46196195","text":"Floscopa scandens is a species of plant in the Commelinaceae family.

Both vessels were passenger carriers cruising along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers as both an excursion boat and tramp steamer . The first Island Queen burned in 1922 in a fire which destroyed several other vessels. The second Island Queen was destroyed in 1947 when its Chief Engineer, using a welding torch, accidentally cut into her fuel tank. The Island Queen was reduced to its steel frame. The boat was scrapped by a local company. First Island Queen The first Island Queen was a sidewheel excursion wooden hull steamboat built in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1896. She was owned by Coney Island Company and used to ferry passengers between Cincinnati and Coney Island amusement park. She was christened May 16, 1896 by the daughter of Lee H Brooks, Coney Island Company's chairman. In off-seasons when the park was closed she operated as a tramp steamer on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, going as far downstream as New Orleans. On April 27, 1922 her forward hurricane deck collapsed, injuring 27 children and paralyzing one. That same year on November 4, Island Queen was severely burned and decommissioned after a fire engulfed several steamboats in Cincinnati harbor. Queen in Pittsburgh River View, Looking at Downtown from the Monongahela River (1906) Second Island Queen The second Island Queen was built in parts beginning in 1923. Midland Barge Company of Midland, Pennsylvania built its steel hull, designed as a matched pair with the Cincinnati for the Louisville & Cincinnati Packet Company and John W. Hubbard. After taking delivery on the hull and naming it Louisville, the owner instead resold it to the Coney Island Company. Coney Island Company finished the boat in Cincinnati on April 18, 1925.Way (1994), p. 228. The new Island Queen measured 285-feet long and could carry 4,000 people. The 1000-ton sidewheeler was powered by oil-burning steam engines with six boilers. It was fully completed and christened in Cincinnati by the Coney Island Company on April 18, 1925. Like her predecessor, Island Queen was used for excursions to Coney Island amusement park and tramping between New Orleans, and as far upstream as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Coney Island Company hired musicians to entertain the passengers. Sidney Desvigne, a cornet player from New Orleans, recruited musicians from his hometown to perform on excursions for the Cincinnati market. In 1929, his band included Henry Julian, Ransom Knowling, Walter \\"Fats\\" Pinchon, Percy Servier, and Gene Ware. While in Pittsburgh, on September 9, 1947, her chief engineer struck her fuel tank with a welding torch, causing a fire and a series of explosions that eventually reduced Island Queen to her steel structure, and killed 19 crew. No passengers were aboard at the time of the fire, but about 40 members of the crew were aboard. Force from the explosions could be felt throughout downtown Pittsburgh, shattering windows in nearby buildings. There were even reports of people being knocked down on streets close to the dock.

Lagos was one of the major ports in West Africa and was a busy entrepot through which trade between the coast and the interior was processed. The city's economy expanded widely during the 19th century. At the time of the strike, Lagos was a colony under the governorship of Henry McCallum. McCallum, who had held a number of important colonial posts in Asia, decided to launch a major reform of the administration and economy of Lagos. Among these reforms was the driving down of wages paid to indigenous workers to increase the supply of labour. The reforms led to unrest among workers in the Public Works Department (PWD). The final trigger for the strike was a decision to alter the working hours of employees of the PWD. The strike broke out on 9 August 1897 and involved nearly 3,000 workers. The colony's police, the Public Force, experienced a minor mutiny on 10 August, meaning that McCallum was unable to repress the workers by force. The strikers' demands were opposed by the indigenous, Europeanised middle-class. During negotiations with the strikers, McCallum made notable concessions. The planned pay reductions were abandoned, while the working hours reforms were tempered by the introduction of a lunch break. The strikers returned to work and the strike is considered successful.

There are 64 known tropical cyclones that affected the peninsula, primarily Yemen and Oman. For convenience, storms are included that affected the Yemeni island of Socotra. Most of the tropical cyclones originated in the Arabian Sea, the portion of the Indian Ocean north of the equator and west of India. The remainder formed in the Bay of Bengal off India's east coast. Collectively, the 64 storms have caused at least US$8.3 billion in damage and 1,693 deaths. The strongest and most damaging cyclone was Cyclone Gonu, which caused US$4 billion in damage and 50 fatalities when it struck Oman in 2007. Tropical cyclone damage in the Arabian Peninsula is chiefly due to flooding. Climatology Within the Indian Ocean north of the equator, tropical cyclones are tracked by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the officially designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the region. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis. The Arabian Sea, which borders the Arabian Peninsula, typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion of the body of water, offshore of western India. About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making landfall, or moving ashore, and around one in three storms move toward the Arabian Peninsula. However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool sea surface temperatures (the result of strong winds from the monsoon), as well as dry air from the Arabian Peninsula. Impacts by country alt=The Arabian Peninsula is bounded by the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf The sultanate of Oman, located on the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, regularly receives the impacts of tropical cyclones due to its long coastline along the Arabian Sea. On average, storms strike Oman once every three years, mostly between Masirah Island and Salalah, and usually before the June or after October. From 1943 to 1967, tropical cyclones accounted for about 25% of Salalah's overall rainfall. About once every five years, a storm affects the Dhofar region of southern Oman, and Oman's capital of Muscat about once every ten years in. Between 1890 and 1996, 36 storms struck Oman, although some landfalling storms might be excluded from the historical record due to the lack of population centers. In addition, storm intensities at landfall have only been accurately known since around 1979, and reliable record keeping began around 1970. In 2014, an archaeology team discovered evidence that a major flood affected Ras Al Hadd in eastern Oman, possibly the result of a tsunami or a severe storm. Oman's most damaging storm was Cyclone Gonu in 2007, which was the strongest recorded storm in the Arabian Sea and the strongest to make landfall on the landmass. Gonu left US$4 billion in damage and killed 50 people, making it the worst natural disaster on record in Oman. In 2010, a slightly weaker cyclone named Phet caused US$780 million in damage and 24 deaths while crossing eastern Oman. Cyclonic Storm Keila in the subsequent year killed 19 people while looping near Oman's southern coastline, and left US$80 million in damage. In 1890, a storm killed 757 people when it flooded much of Oman's capital. A storm in 1959 caused a shipwreck near southern Oman, resulting in the loss of all 141 crewmembers. Another storm-related shipwreck killed 18 people in December 1998. In June 1977, a storm struck Masirah Island, causing 105 deaths and becoming Oman's worst natural disaster in the 20th century. A storm in 2002 that killed nine and caused US$25 million in damage. Cyclone Nilofar in 2014 killed four people from its outer rainbands. Although storms rarely strike Yemen, back-to-back cyclones Chapala and Megh hit the country one week apart in November 2015. The country has two recorded landfalls by severe cyclonic storms ‚Äì tropical cyclones with winds of at least . The first was a storm in May 1960, and the other was Cyclone Chapala in 2015, the latter being the second-strongest cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea. Chapala earlier struck the Yemeni offshore island of Socotra, which was also hit by Cyclone Megh less than a week later. The two storms collectively killed 26 people in Yemen. The country's worst natural disaster on record was from a 1996 storm that earlier hit Oman, causing severe flooding that caused US$1.2 billion in damage and 338 deaths. The second worst natural disaster in Yemen was from a weak depression in 2008 that killed 180 people and caused US$874.8 million in damage. More recently, Cyclone Sagar killed a woman when her house caught fire due to the storm. Elsewhere on the peninsula, Cyclone Gonu's waves damaged the port in Fujairah, United Arab Emirates. In 1995 and again in 1996, the remnants of a storm that hit Oman entered Rub' al Khali, or the Empty Quarter, of Saudi Arabia. In 2008, the remnants of a storm that hit Yemen brought rainfall and dust storms to Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

The Insurgency in Meghalaya is part of the wider Insurgency in Northeast India, and was fueled by demands of the Khasi, Synteng and Garo people for a separate state. Background The state of Meghalaya was separated from the state of Assam in 1971, in order to satisfy the Khasi, Synteng and Garo for a separate state. The decision was initially praised as an example of successful national integration into the wider Indian state. This, however, failed to prevent the rise of national consciousness among the local tribal populations. This later led to a direct confrontation between Indian nationalism and the newly created Garo and Khasi nationalisms. A parallel rise of nationalism in the other members of the Seven Sister States further complicated the situation, resulting in occasional clashes between fellow rebel groups. The state wealth distribution system further fueled the rising separatist movements, as funding is practiced through per capita transfers, which largely benefits the leading ethnic group. The first militant outfit to emerge in the region was the Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council (HALC), it was formed in 1992, aiming to protect the interests of Meghalaya's indigenous population from the rise of non-tribal (\\"Dkhar\\") immigration. A conflict of interest soon led to a split of HALC into the Garo dominated Achik Matgrik Liberation Army (AMLA), and the joint Systeng-Khasi alliance of Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC). However AMLA passed into obscurity, while Achik National Volunteers Council (ANVC) took its place. The Garo ‚Äì Khasi drift persisted as HNLC had set up the goal of turning Meghalaya into an exclusively Khasi region, ANVC on the other hand sought out the creation of an independent state in the Garo Hills. A number of non Meghalayan separatist groups have also operated in the region, including the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland among others. Timeline A 2014 list of Meghalaya's most wanted militants On 9 September 2002, ANVC militants kill 6 policemen, after laying an ambush in the vicinity of Chokpot. On 26 September 2003, Indian troops kill 8 ANVC militants in two separate encounters, in the West Garo Hills district. On 23 July 2004, ANVC signed an extended ceasefire agreement with the Indian government, while maintaining low level activity. A power vacuum created by the ceasefire lead to the creation of several rebel groups, including RIUF, UANF, HULA, HNSRA. On 24 July 2007, HNLC chairman Julius Dorphang surrendered to the authorities after abandoning the faction's camp in the Maulvi Bazar district of Bangladesh, four other rebels accompanied Dorphang in his decision. On 12 October 2008, policemen shot and killed top PLF-M commander Pollendro Marak, in the aftermath of an encounter in the area of the Boganol village, East Garo Hills. On 10 December 2010, four GNLA rebels were killed five were detained in a clash with police officers that took place in the East Garo Hills district. On 5 April 2011, GNLA killed 5 migrant coal miners and injured another in the Goka coal dumping area South Garo Hills district.

On 9 August 2012, security forces arrested 5 GNLA separatists in Resubelpara, North Garo Hills district, as the militants were extorting money from a local citizen. On 2 April 2014, the UALA, ASAK, LAEF, ANLCA and ANCA militant factions united under the name of A‚Äôchik Revolutionary Front, the group aims to create a separate Garoland State in the Garo Hills area.

On 28 August 2014, police recovered the bodies of 4 previously kidnapped, civilians, in the Oragitok village, West Garo Hills, Meghalaya. On 13 September 2014, a shootout between members of GNLA and AMEF led to the death of 4 GNLA rebels, in the Bolmaram jungle, East Garo Hills. On 24 September 2014, the heads of the ANVC rebel group and the ANVC Rimpu Marak splinter faction signed a peace accord with the government of Meghalaya. The agreement enhances the autonomy for the Garo Hills Autonomous District and includes financial aid, which will facilitate the socio-economic and educational development of the area. In return the rebels agreed to disband within the period of three months. On 22 October 2014, security forces detained 6 ULFA rebels in the village of Pedaldoba, Tikrikilla, Menghalaya, six pistols, two grenades and 20 rounds of ammunition were also confiscated.

Kilgore was the first woman lawyer in Philadelphia. She was a school teacher and began to study law in 1875, when such narrow prejudice existed against woman receiving the benefit of a university course, that accompanying the refusal of her application for admission to the Law School of the University of Pennsylvania, was the courteous observation of the dean, that the time for him to resign would be when negroes and women were admitted. Kilgore persevered sixteen years before she became a recognized member of the bar. Early years Caroline Burnham was born in Craftsbury, Vermont in 1838. Her father, James Burham, was a woolen manufacturer while her mother Eliza Arnold Bunham was a former teacher. Kilgore was orphaned at age eleven. Career She supported herself as a domestic worker and later as a teacher. While working as a teacher, Kilgore continued her education at Craftsbury Academy and Newbury Seminary. Kilgore taught in Wisconsin before switching her focus to medicine. She enrolled in medical school at the Hygeia-Therapeutic College and completed her M.D. in 1865. The University of Pennsylvania Law School rejected her application in 1871. She attempted to buy individual tickets to attend lectures. Sometime later, she sent her husband to purchase the lecture passes, but the Board of Trustees informed her that even if she attended every required lecture and passed all of the examinations, they would not guarantee that she would earn a diploma. After studying privately, Kilgore asked to take the bar exam in 1873 and 1874, but was refused. After ten years of lobbying, Kilgore finally became the first female student admitted to the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1881. She graduated in 1883. She was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1885, and before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1890. Kilgore was a member of the Citizens' Suffrage Association and tried to vote at city and county elections in 1871. She was ruled against and appealed to the full state supreme court, which affirmed the ruling against her. She published a pamphlet with her argument before the state supreme court, titled Woman Suffrage. The Argument of Carrie S. Burnham, which also included the opinion of the man who originally ruled against her, George Sharswood. She died in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, June 29, 1909, and was buried at Craftsbury Common Cemetery in Craftsbury, Vermont. Legacy During the University of Pennsylvania's Homecoming Weekend of October 1965, the Trustees dedicated Kilgore House, one of the four houses in the Robert C. Hill Residence Hall, in her honor. She is listed as one of the Philadelphia Bar Association's Legends of the Bar.

Smotrich is a co-sponsor of proposed legislation change stating that sources of Jewish religious tradition such as the Torah have to be considered when dealing with legal matters that cannot be decided by legislation or court rulings. Other sponsors of this legislation are Miki Zohar from Likud, Yoav Ben-Tzur from Shas, and Nissan Slomiansky from The Jewish Home.What Islamic State and One Member of Knesset Share Haaretz, 6 September 2015 In June 2019, Smotrich campaigned for the Ministry of Justice, saying that he sought the portfolio to \\"restore the Torah justice system\\". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu distanced himself from the comments and appointed openly gay MK Amir Ohana to the post. According to Channel 13, Smotrich subsequently requested the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, but was not granted the position due to fears that he would strain ties between Israel and the Jewish diaspora. =Legislation= Smotrich initiated the following legislation which passed in the Knesset: * In addition to government ministers and Knesset members; judges, senior military personnel, and police officers would also have to declare their capital every six years. Controversy Proposal for separation of Jews and Arabs In July 2015, Smotrich caused controversy by declaring in a Knesset Interior meeting that developers in Israel should not have to sell homes to Arabs. The meeting took place following accusations that Galil Homes refused to sell homes to Arabs in Ma'alot, a northern Israeli town. Smotrich defended the developer, saying that, \\"Anyone who wants to protect the Jewish People and opposes mixed marriages is not a racist. Whoever wants to let Jews live a Jewish life without non-Jews is not a racist.\\" He added that Jews are the ones deprived in Israel because \\"they don't get free land in the Negev\\", a reference to Bedouin. \\"I believe in God's words.

The following month, Smotrich accused LGBT organizations of controlling the media and silencing those who share his conservative views. An Israeli NGO, \\"Ometz\\", filed a complaint to the Knesset Ethics Committee to intervene and investigate Smotrich's comments. Hospital room segregation between Jews and Arabs In April 2016, Bezalel Smotrich tweeted that he supports segregation of Arab and Jewish women in hospital's maternity wards: \\"It is natural that my wife would not want to lay down next to someone who just gave birth to a baby that might want to murder her baby in another 20 years.\\"Jonathan Lis,'Israeli Lawmaker: My Wife Wouldn't Want to Give Birth Next to an Arab Woman,' Haaretz 5 April 2016 The tweets were condemned by several Israeli politicians, including opposition leader Isaac Herzog and Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett. Calling Reform Judaism a ‚Äòfake religion‚Äô In July 2016, Smotrich stated he was ‚Äúnot willing to recognize Reform conversions and their fake religion.‚Äù The comment came following the passing of a Knesset bill permitting local religious authorities to bar non-Orthodox from using public mikvahs for conversion ceremonies, which countered a Supreme Court ruling to the contrary. Stone-throwing and terrorism Smotrich has advocated a shoot-to-kill policy for the military when they deal with Palestinians throwing stones. Asked what he would do were another intifada to arise, and a Palestinian child were to throw stones, he replied: \\"Either I will shoot him, or I will jail him, or I will expel him.\\"Ravit Hecht, He wants the Israeli military to be able to shoot to kill when children throw stones Haaretz 3 December 2016Emma Graham-Harrison, 'Bezalel Smotrich: Israel‚Äôs far-right demagogue, drawing fringe beliefs to the centre,' The Guardian 12 March 2017.

In April 2018, Smotrich tweeted that Ahed Tamimi, a 17-year-old Palestinian serving an eight-month jail sentence for assaulting a soldier, incitement, and interfering with a soldier in the line of duty, \\"should have gotten a bullet, at least in the kneekap\\". Twitter responded by suspending his account for 12 hours and asking him to delete the tweet, saying that the tweet was \\"abusive\\" and could incite harassment. Smotrich refused to delete the tweet, saying that for Twitter, \\"freedom of speech is reserved for just for one side of the political map\\", and that he stood by his tweet. Turning Israel into a theocratic Halachic state In June 2019, while pushing to be appointed Justice minister (just after the previous Justice minister had been fired) Justice Smotrich stated \\"We want the justice portfolio because we want to restore the Torah justice system,\\" and that the country should aspire to run itself as ‚Äúin the days of King David.\\" In August 2019, Smotrich stated, ‚ÄúWe [Orthodox Jews] all would want the State of Israel to be run according to the Torah and Jewish law, it‚Äôs just that we can‚Äôt because there are people who think differently from us and we have to get along with them.‚Äù The United Right (a political alliance of right-wing parties including The Jewish Home and Smotrich's Tkuma) referred to the negative reaction \\"media lynching\\", arguing that Smotrich \\"emphasized that he cannot and isn‚Äôt interested in forcing it on others.\\" However, Smotrich had said \\"The government makes decisions that affect us and impedes our liberties every day so it is simply about what decisions are in the public interest enough to justify coercion... We too can force our needs on others, provided we are convinced ourselves of the validity of our demands.\\" Personal life Smotrich is an Orthodox Jew and is married to Revital, with whom he has six children. The family lives outside the Kedumim settlement in the West Bank, in a house that was illegally built outside of state land and in breach of the settlement's master plan.Radical Settler, ‚ÄòProud Homophobe‚Äô and Wunderkind: Meet the New Leader of Israel's Far Right Haaretz. 15 January 2019Yotam Berger, \\"West Bank Home of Israeli Lawmaker Who Championed Land-grab Law Built Illegally\\", 1 March 2017 References External links * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Deputy Speakers of the Knesset Category:Government ministers of Israel Category:Israeli Orthodox Jews Category:Israeli settlers Category:Members of the 20th Knesset (2015‚Äì2019) Category:Members of the 21st Knesset (2019) Category:Members of the 22nd Knesset (2019‚Äì2020) Category:Members of the 23rd Knesset (2020‚Äì) Category:Ono Academic College alumni Category:People from Judea and Samaria Area Category:The Jewish Home politicians Category:Tkuma (political party) leaders Category:Yamina politicians Category:Mercaz HaRav alumni ","title":"Bezalel Smotrich"},{"id":"46196838","text":"Park Hee-young ( or ; born 21 March 1991) is a South Korean women's football midfielder who plays for Hyundai Steel Red Angels.

He became renowned for his critical works on theory of socialism as well as for singular endurance and uncompromising attitude towards authorities during his prison terms. After imprisonment and exile Vazif Meylanov dealt with the problem of personal freedom, examined social and political environment, dispelled stereotypes about Russian democracy and analyzed political consciousness of Russian society. Besides, he was an opponent of nationalism and Islamism, while he proposed that the idea of rule of human rights should be a basis for human relationships and strong state machine should enforce rights.  Biography   Early years  Vazif Meylanov was born in Makhachkala on May 15, 1940. He is an ethnic Lezgin. Until 1954 he studied at the school No.1 in Makhachkala. Since 1954 he studied at the school No. 2 in the town Chardzhou (Turkmenistan) and graduated from that school in 1957. From 1957 till 1958 he lived in Pyatigorsk and prepared to enter Moscow State University. From 1958 to 1961 he studied at the Physics Faculty of Moscow State University. Vazif Meylanov served in the Soviet Army from 1961 to 1964. From 1964 to 1969 he studied at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University and attended seminars of Anatoli Vitushkin. From 1969 to 1972 Meylanov studied at that Faculty as a post-graduate student, then from 1972 to 1978 he taught advanced mathematics at Dagestan Polytechnic Institute. In 1972 Vazif Meylanov wrote the novel To flash as a tigress (–ú–µ–ª—å–∫–Ω–µ—Ç —Ç–∏–≥—Ä–∏—Ü–µ–π). Vazif Meylanov is the author of two works on the mathematical theory of real-variable function: ‚ÄúSequences of closed sets of bounded variation converging in the deviation metric‚Äù (1974) and ‚ÄúTwo close sets of bounded variation‚Äù. The works were published in the ‚ÄúMathematical Notes‚Äù journal and translated into English, the second work was also published in the US.  Start of social and political activity  In 1977 Vazif Meylanov wrote and published in his own name philosophical and political work ‚ÄúNotes on the margins of Soviet newspapers\\", which was devoted to criticism of the communism theory. In it, Meylanov argued for freedom of speech and press and the abolition of the Articles 70 (Anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda) and 190-1 (defamation of the Soviet system) of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR. In 1978 Vazif Meylanov was not re-elected by the Academic Council of the Institute as a teacher for a new five-year term because of \\"being in opposition to the staff and damaging the communist education of youth\\". From 1978 to 1980 Vazif Meylanov worked as a concrete worker of the 5th rank in the mobile mechanized column No.10 and the special mobile mechanized column No.18. The 1980 protest banner by Meylanov: \\"I protest against the persecution of academician A. Sakharov. Ideas should be fought by ideas, not the police. People needs persons like Sakharov, as it is they who exercise the true informal control over the state organs. All troubles of this country are caused by the lack of freedom of speech. Fight for freedom of speech of ideological opponents of communism ‚Äì it will be your fight for freedom of speech!\\" On January 25, 1980, on the next day after the article devoted to the exile of Sakharov in the city of Gorky was published in the Izvestia newspaper, Meylanov was arrested for walking into the Lenin square in Makhachkala with a banner on which was written the following: \\"I protest against the persecution of Sakharov. Ideas should fight against ideas, but not the police. Population needs people like Sakharov, as it is they who exercise the true informal control over the actions of the state. All troubles of this country are caused by the lack of freedom of speech. Fight for freedom of speech of ideological opponents of communism ‚Äì it will be your fight for freedom of speech! \\"Extract from the BBC broadcast on January 28, 1980 (shown as amended): \\"Moscow dissidents report that in Makhachkala, Dagestan, a man who tried to protest publicly against the exile of Academician Andrei Sakharov was arrested.\\" On Friday, January 25 Vazif Meylanov went out to the street and held a banner with words of protest in front of the Dagestan Regional Committee of the CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union). Meylanov was immediately arrested and taken to an undisclosed location. His apartment is reported to have been ransacked. A 39 years- old Meylanov graduated from Moscow State University and taught mathematics at the Dagestan Polytechnic Institute until 1978‚Äù. On December 2, 1980 Vazif Meylanov was found guilty by the Supreme Court of the Dagestan ASSR on three charges: # Writing and distributing his work \\"Notes on the margins of Soviet newspapers\\"; # Going to the square with a banner; # The distribution of the books Cursed Days by Ivan Bunin, Necropolis by Vladislav Khodasevich and Life of Sologdin by Dimitri Panin –ù–µ was sentenced to 7 years in a strict regime labor camp and two years of exile. In the remand prison, Meylanov wrote \\"Notes on the transcript of court sessions\\".  Imprisonment and exile  Vazif Meylanov was sent to the correctional labor colony No. 35, also known as Perm-35, located in the western taiga zone of the Ural Mountains. This colony (389/35) was established for dangerous special criminals in 1972. In the early 1980s 270 political prisoners served time in the colony for dissidence, including Vazif Meylanov, Anatoly Sharansky, Vladimir Poresh, Anatoly Marchenko, Vladimir Bukovsky, Joseph Begun, Sergei Grigoryants, Gleb Yakunin, Yuriy Orlov, Sergei Kovalev, Valery Senderov and many others. Vazif Meylanov arrived in the colony on March 26, 1981. There he refused to participate in a correctional forced labor, writing a statement to Major Osin, Chief of the colony, on August 28, 1981: \\"I refuse to work in the colony in protest against forced labor in prison camp, which contradicts the status of political prisoners. I claim the following changes to the Internal Rules of correctional labor colony and to the correctional labor code (for political prisoners): 1. To establish the principle of voluntary participation in the labor force. 2. To put an end to deductions from wages of political prisoners for maintenance of the prison administration and guard. Commentary. The percentage of deductions should be the same as at liberty. If society is afraid of me, then ... let them pay for their fears! That‚Äôs the way the world wags - for your fears you have to pay yourself. Transmit this information to the workers and the peasants. 3. To put an end to the shameful practice of hunger tortures in punitive confinement. Commentary. Nutritional standards in punitive confinement should be the same as that in the colony (2A).\\" \\\\- Vazif Meylanov, ‚Äú\\"Another Sky. False stereotypes of Russian democracy \\", materials from the identification record of the prisoner, Volume No. 1, pages 177‚Äì178 from the record. Vazif Meylanov was imprisoned in punitive confinement, with nutritional standard 9b (every second day), from April 10, 1981, to June 1982 for refusing to work. During that period of time he was twice goaded into dystrophy, then he was placed in the prison hospital, but after that he was imprisoned in punitive confinement again. As Vazif Meylanov didn't give his consent to work, the restrictive was changed and he was transferred to prison in Chistopol, where he spent three years from 1982 to 1985 in punishment cell with a strict prison regime. On September 10, 1982, in Chistopol prison Vazif Meylanov wrote a statement which explained to the Communist state his attitude towards attempts to rectify him by means of forced labor: ‚ÄúDo you want to rectify me by means of forced labor? Sorry, but I don‚Äôt want to mend my ways. (‚Ä¶)There are two levels of violence, one ‚Äì is not to allow someone to do something, it is the lowest level of violence; the other ‚Äì to make somebody do something, it is the highest level of violence, which abuses one‚Äôs soul. But I seek to reduce the level of violence in the world, that is why I encourage you to pass from the highest level of violence to the lowest. \\"Vazif Meylanov, ‚Äú\\"Another Sky. False stereotypes of Russian democracy \\", materials from the identification record of the prisoner, Volume ‚Ññ 2, pages 170‚Äì172 from the record. In 1983 in Chistopol prison Vazif Meylanov wrote two books: \\"Disarmament and criminal codes\\" and \\"I talk to the Communists.\\" Both of them were transferred outside the prison and were published in the Archives of Samizdat (dissident underground press in the USSR) Extract from the characteristics of the convicted person for the period from 26.07.1982 to 06.05.1985: ‚ÄúDuring term of punishment convicted Meylanov made extremely bad showing. From the first days of imprisonment he was involved in socially useful work, in particular knitting bags, but for the entire period of his sentence Meylanov has not started to work, for which he was repeatedly punished as a disciplinary measure. He doesn‚Äôt keep regular hours and custodial control, for which he was punished 13 times as a disciplinary measure, including 6 times in solitary confinement. He responds extremely negatively to political educational events. He is unfriendly towards policy of the CPSU and the Soviet government and tends to write scandalous reports. He actively participates in the manifestations of negatively-spirited part of the convicts. Convicted Meylanov refuses consciously to mend his ways‚Äù. In 1985 Vazif Meylanov was returned to the same colony 389/35 to the same punishment cell with feeding every second day (from 10.07.1985 to 03.09.1986). From that colony he was returned again to Chistopol prison in solitary confinement regime till the end of the term. But jailers failed to break down the stubborn prisoner and Vazif Meylanov did not work any day. In 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev launched a campaign for the release of political prisoners in the wake of reforms. However, inside prisons and camps the campaign did not look so magnificent. Since 1985 i machine of coercion in prisons gathered pace, as the detention regime changed for the worse, the rules became stricter, while punishment became harsher. Some political prisoners were released, but they had to write a statement with the promise to comply with the Soviet laws henceforth. On January 19, 1987 Soviet prosecutors Ovcharov and Semenov arrived in Chistopol prison. At the moment I am in strict confinement, it's the first month of this regime, and that is why I get nutrition in isolation cell. Representatives of the Soviet Prosecutor's Office tell me that they fulfill the order of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR: they have authority to release those political prisoners who will give written assurances to comply with existing laws in the country. People exhausted for years of imprisonment were deprived of victory ... I am writing an application to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet: \\"Whenever it was day and hour of my release, I will violate the Soviet laws ‚Äì in particular Articles ‚Ññ 70 and ‚Ññ 190-1 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR. I demand their exclusion from the Code. \\"Jailors decided to put pressure on me by means of my relatives, on February 26, 1987 I was transferred from the Chistopol prison to Makhachkala detention center. I had two appointments with my parents and my brother. They were asked to persuade me to write the required statement. My old parents (77-year-old father and 74-years-old mother) and brother asked me to write. My mother told me that before the end of my exile she and my father could die. I said to my relatives, that \\"seventy years the criminal regime used humans for the consolidation of inhumanity,\\" and that \\"nothing in the world will encourage me to surrender to the increasingly inhumane regime.\\"Vazif Meylanov, \\"Another Sky. False stereotypes of Russian democracy\\", article ‚ÄúAnti-Communist Nuremberg: Vazif Meylanov to Congress of Deputies and the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, August 20, 1989\\" Vazif Meylanov refused to sign a statement promising to respect Soviet laws and served his full sentence in prison and exile. On September 11, 1987, he was transferred from the isolation cell of Chistopol prison to place of his exile - Yakutia, village Namtsy of the Verkhnevilyuisk region. Living conditions in exile were very heavy, Meylanov refused to work as a sorter of potatoes and demanded to work in the specialty, which created for him the danger of being arrested and judged - for parasitism. Vazif Meylanov wrote about it in his \\"Letter to Russian writers.\\" This essay, written in the form of an appeal to people, who glorify the Party's new course and speak about the changes in society and are reticent about the latest unbroken people still serving time in prison and exile - for the word.‚Äù \\"Lovers of mankind! Teachers of people! Well, why should I be in exile now in the era of spiritual rebirth and democracy? I was punished for the word, my teachers! I would have gone to bat for you, if you had been punished for the word! (...) I understand that you are busy, everyone needs you, all ask you to write articles, while I have a private question: for refusing to work not in the specialty, that is the refusal to accept the punishment and forced physical labor Meylanov will be sentenced for a new term, under not political but criminal article - for parasitism ... private issue, which doesn‚Äôt matter now, when the party launches a great campaign for reorganization and democratization of all aspects of our lives. \\"Vazif Meylanov, ‚Äú\\"Another Sky. False stereotypes of Russian democracy \\", essay ‚ÄúLetter to Russian writers‚Äù January 27, 1988 From the correspondence of that time with the leaders of the Amnesty International, Diane and John Beddouz we know that health of Vazif Meylanov has been undermined after several years of camps, prisons, solitary confinement, after being tortured by hunger. In July 1988 in Yakutsk Oncology Center doctors had his basal-cell carcinoma out. Vazif Meylanov returned from exile to Makhachkala on December 25, 1988.  Rehabilitation and activity in modern Russia  In September 1989 Vazif Meylanov became a chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces of Dagestan, then a chairman of movement \\"Democratic Dagestan\\", but in August 1992 he left all political parties and movements and devoted himself to what he calls \\"private politics\\". On August 20, 1989, he sent to his appeal to the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union with the requirement to launch a trial, like Nuremberg trial, of the Communist Party and the Communist ideology of the USSR to ‚ÄúThe Russian thought\\" journal. The editorial staff refused to publish the article because of \\"untimeliness\\" of such claims. In 1990 the Latvian newspaper \\"Atmoda\\" published an article of Vazif Meylanov \\"On the road of Shafarevich to precipice\\" (‚ÄúThe Russian thought‚Äù journal refused to publish the article because it criticizes the stance of Sakharov, who recently died). The article criticizes the views of Shafarevich on history and draws attention to basic mistakes of \\"Russian national consciousness.\\" In early 1990 Vazif Meylanov was nominated for the deputies of the public organization - the Union of Cooperators of DASSR. However, the district election commission refused to register him as a candidate even after direct reference of the Central Election Commission. The representative of the CEC of the RSFSR during telephone call admitted that the demand not to register Vazif Meylanov as a candidate had come directly from Magomedali Magomedov, who was the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Dagestan ASSR at that time. The documentary chronicle of the story was published in the \\"Komsomolets of Dagestan‚Äù newspaper. In the summer of 1990 Meylanov participated in resolving the ethnic conflict in the village of Tiwi, Kvareli region of Georgia. The conflict was provoked by supporters of Gamsakhurdia, who was against the Avars. After the publication of Meylanov's points on Georgia in the newspaper \\"Komsomolets of Dagestan\\" its editor Tatyana Voronina was removed from her post. Journalists Alexander Torba, Dmitry Gorbanev, Sharapudin Magomedov resigned from the newspaper in protest at the decision of the Regional Committee of the Dagestan Young Communist League (Komsomol). In 1990 Vazif Meylanov published a brochure \\"At first hand\\", which includes works written in the Chistopol prison. In 1990 Vazif Meylanov was rehabilitated. The rehabilitation decision was made by the authorities, without any effort of the former prisoner. On December 6, 1989, First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Court RSFSR Radchenko sent an application No. 1646 on Vazif Meylnov's rehabilitation to the Presidium of the Supreme Court. On January 3, 1990, resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Court dismiss charges from Meylanov for the distribution of books of Solzhenitsyn, Bunin, Khodasevich, Panin and charges for going to the square with a banner in support of Andrei Sakharov. The rest of the sentence was upheld, that is Meylanov still was considered to be guilty of \\"writing slanderous anti-Soviet works.\\" The criminal case against Vazif Meylanov was completely closed for absence of a crime in the act by the Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the USSR No. 2004-90 November 29, 1990, after repeated protest of the Prosecutor General of the USSR Sukharev No.13 / 209-80 on July 18, 1990. Vazif Meylanov found out about his rehabilitation by chance in 1991. He received back original investigation files and identification record of the prisoner. From 1991 to 1994 Vazif Meylanov published the newspaper ‚ÄúVzglyad‚Äù (‚ÄúSight‚Äù) and the author's paper \\"Another Sky\\". On July 3, 1995 Vazif Meylanov filed a suit with the Supreme Court of Dagestan against the Russian Federation for compensation for harm caused to him by the communist Soviet Union unlawful arrest, conviction and imprisonment for seven and a half years and exile for a year and a half. From 1994 to 1997 he worked as a senior research fellow at the Institute of Social and Economic Research of the Dagestan Scientific Center Russian Academy of Sciences. From 1995 to 1998 he has been writing and publishing the book \\"Analysis of the Chechen crisis,\\" the central idea of which is the idea of the need of compliance with law to preserve freedom. At the same time he examined mistakes and false stereotypes of democratic leaders, which became evident in the view of the Chechen crisis. The book \\"Another Sky. False stereotypes of Russian democracy. Analysis of the Chechen crisis\\" was published in 100 copies in the printing-office of Dawood Zulumhanov in Makhachkala. Vazif Meylaniv attempted to publish this book in Moscow due to various publishers and foundations, but all publishers rejected - his point of view on the issue came into conflict with the opinion of the \\"progressive community\\" that supported Dudayev: \\"I found necessary to express my opinion about the Chechen war, because all formal and informal teachers of Russia and the world took the side of Chechen nationalists, Chechen national liberators, Chechen national revolutionists, and It‚Äôs them (national liberators), who I regard as the wrong side\\".Vazif Meylanov ‚ÄúAnalysis of the Chechen crisis‚Äù, foreword to the first edition In the 1990s Vazif Meylanov continued to elaborate on the definition of freedom and its conditionality precisely metered by the lack of freedom for all and the ban to violate the freedom of others. He criticized nationalism (giving the examples of Chechnya and Georgia) pointed out the danger of Islamism. In 1999 he was nominated by a group of young people as a candidate of the National Assembly of the Dagestan Republic in Lezgin constituency. The district election commission refused to register the initiative group, because it found inaccuracies in the design of the subscription lists. The initiative group filed a suit and won the trial, according to the decision of the Leninsky District Court of Makhachkala Vazif Meylanov was registered as a candidate 2 days before the end of the election campaign. In 2003 the third edition of the \\"Analysis of the Chechen crisis\\" and \\"False stereotypes of Russian democracy\\" were published under the title \\"The experience of private political activity in Russia.\\" In 2001 the magazine \\"Znamya\\" (Banner) published an article of Vazif Meylanov \\"On abolition of civil rights in Russia.\\" The article is devoted to the discovery, which was made by the author at the end of legal battles with the state in the case of compensation for harm caused by illegal imprisonment and exile for 9 years. The Court awarded compensation to the author in the amount of 311 thousand rubles. But officers of justice returned the judgment with a note that according to Article 110 of the Federal Law \\"On the Federal Budget for 2001\\" claimant presents himself the decision of the court to the debtor. That is, in fact, enforcement of claims to the state in Russia were canceled (the bailiff service guarantees the enforcement, if the debtor ‚Äì is a private or legal entity). And the enforcement is not canceled by the procedural law (e.g., the Enforcement law), but by substantive law adopted per year ‚Äì by the budget. That is, in Russia - according to law - the state has the right not to pay its debts, despite the court's decision. The principle of compulsory execution of court decisions has an exception for the state - it now executes the court decisions voluntary. After analyzing this issue and summarizing the Russian practice of non- compliance with court decisions on claims to the state since 2001 (article, which repeals the enforcement, was repeated in subsequent law on the budget). In 2006 Vazif Meylanov wrote and published the book ‚ÄúMistaken constants of Russian consciousness\\" with the subtitle \\"Why court decision satisfying the claims of citizens against the state are not implemented in Russia‚Äù in publishing house \\"Socium\\". In 2005 due to the universal obligatory exchange of old Russian national passports for new passports Vazif Meylanov handed in application for a new passport in the passport and visa service of the Leninsky district of Makhachkala. But Meylanov didn't receive a new passport under the pretext of the absence of residence registration his old passport. He went to court and on July 29, 2005, the Leninsky District Court of Makhachkala held: \\"To recognize illegal the inaction of officials of the passport and visa service of the Leninsky district Police Department of Makhachkala, which left unanswered the application of Russian citizen Meylanov for a new passport. Compel the head of the passport and visa service of the Leninsky district Police Department of Makhachkala to issue a passport of the Russian Federation of the new sample to Vazif Meylanov, who was born and live in Makhachkala.‚Äù But the chief of Leninsky district Police Department refused to comply with the court's decision and gave the curious supervisory appeal to the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic, however, this appeal remained unsatisfied. Vazif Meylanov handed over documents for execution to the bailiffs, who two months later stated that they could not make the passport office issue the new passport to Vazif Meylanov. Finally, Vazif Meylanov received the new passport in Foreigner Regional Registrational Office. The story about the exchange of passport was described in details by Natalia Krainova in the series of articles, published in the newspaper \\"New Business\\" in 2005‚Äì2006. In the 2000s the articles of Vazif Meylanov were published in the regional newspapers ‚ÄúChernovik‚Äù (Rough copy) and ‚ÄúNovoe delo‚Äù (New affair). Vazif Meylanov died on January 11, 2015, in Makhachkala after suffering from Alzheimer disease for years. He was buried on the New Cemetery in Makhachkala, Russia.

References in texts of contemporaries  Many contemporaries mentioned Vazif Meylanov in his writings, appeals and memoirs. This section presents some extracts devoted to Vazif Meylanov from the texts of his contemporaries. ¬´Meylanov is one of those who in 1980 came up with a slogan for my release and protested against my illegal exile to Gorky. I am now in front of you, but Meylanov - only because he refused to appeal for pardon, that is, to recognize, as he believed, formally at least, that he was lawfully in prison - is still deprived of his liberty. \\" ‚Äî Andrei Sakharov, press- conference in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, June 3, 1988 Natan Sharansky devoted many pages to Vazif Meylanov in his book Fear no evil, 1991: \\"Soon after arriving in our prison Meylanov said: - I am not a slave. As long as the labor is forced in colony, I will not work. Naturally, he immediately found himself in the isolation cell and wasn‚Äôt transferred back. I remember the early months of his struggle, few believed that Vazif would hold his position. \\"We have broken even stronger prisoners!\\" - said the cops. \\"We have seen more brave men,\\" - said those prisoners who were weaker in spirit and the most jealous. But four years later, when, even without knowing it, I was living the last months in prison, sitting together with Meylanov in punishment cell, he also stood firm on his own, as at the beginning. The years of punishment cells and prisons fell behind, his health was destroyed, but KGB didn't manage to break his spirit. In the political prisons there were a lot of resistant dissidents, but even on their background Meylanov stood out due to his enduring perseverance¬ª. ‚Äî Natan Sharansky, Fear no evil, 1991 References Category:1940 births Category:2015 deaths Category:People from Makhachkala Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:Soviet mathematicians Category:Soviet human rights activists Category:Soviet dissidents Category:Lezgins ","title":"Vazif Meylanov"},{"id":"46196917","text":"Moran and Mack in character in 1929.

All countries that signed the UNFCCC were asked to publish their INDCs at the 2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Warsaw, Poland, in November 2013. The intended contributions were determined without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions. The term was intended as a compromise between \\"quantified emissions limitation and reduction objective\\" (QUELROs) and \\"nationally appropriate mitigation actions\\" (NAMAs) that the Kyoto Protocol used to describe the different legal obligations of developed and developing countries. Under the Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, the INDC will become the first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) when a country ratifies the agreement unless it decides to submit a new NDC at the same time. Once the Paris Agreement is ratified, the NDC will become the first greenhouse gas targets under the UNFCCC that applied equally to both developed and developing countries. On 3 August 2016, China and the US ratified the agreement. Together, they contribute 38% of total global emissions, with China alone emitting 20%. India, with 4.1% of emissions, ratified the Paris Agreement on 2 October 2016 by depositing the instrument of ratification with the United Nations. Process The INDCs combine the top-down system of a United Nations climate agreement with bottom- up system-in elements through which countries put forward their agreements in the context of their own national circumstances, capabilities, and priorities, with the goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions enough to keep global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. The INDCs contain steps taken towards emissions reductions and also aim to address steps taken to adapt to climate change impacts, and what support the country needs, or will provide, to address climate change. After the initial submission of INDCs in March 2015, an assessment phase followed to review the impact of the submitted INDCs before the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Submission Research released by NewClimate Institute for UNFCCC and UNDP concluded that as of March 2015, one-third of the 81 surveyed countries had not yet begun their INDC. Approximately another third had started the national discussion, but had not proceeded to the technical design phase. Submission ambitions vary geographically; for instance, African countries often reported the latest intended submission dates. On 27 February 2015, Switzerland became the first nation to submit its INDC. Switzerland said that it had experienced a temperature rise of 1.75 ¬∞C since 1864, and aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030. India submitted its INDC to the UNFCCC in October 2015, committing to cut the emissions intensity of GDP by 33‚Äì35% by 2030 from 2005 levels. On its submission, India wrote that it needs \\"at least USD 2.5 trillion\\" to achieve its 2015-2030 goals, and that its \\"international climate finance needs\\" will be the difference over \\"what can be made available from domestic sources.\\" The INDCs of the largest greenhouse gas emitters included China, which targeted a 60-65% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP by 2030, the United States, which targeted a 26-28% reduction by 2025, and the European Union which targeted a 40% reduction compared to 1990 by 2030. India submitted a target of 33-35% per unit of GDP, conditional on finance being made available by developed countries. The EU was criticized by members of civil society claiming that its 40% emission reduction target is not ambitious enough. Prior to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference a synthesis report was prepared that assessed the impact of all the published INDCs on expected global warming. This incorporated the impact of INDCs submitted for 147 countries, who comprised 80% of total global emissions in 2010. It concluded that if the INDCs were met this would slow the increase in emissions from the 24% increase between 1990 and 2010 to an increase between 2010 and 2030 of between 11% and 23%. However, emissions up to 2030 would amount to 75% of the total emissions that were consistent with limiting global warming to the target of 2¬∞. Therefore, much greater reduction would be required after 2030 in order to reach this target. Challenges Of surveyed countries, 85% reported that they are challenged by the short time frame available to develop INDCs. Other challenges reported include difficulty to secure high-level political support, a lack of certainty and guidance on what should be included in INDCs, and limited expertise for the assessment of technical options. However, despite challenges, less than a quarter of countries said they had received international support to prepare their INDCs, and more than a quarter indicated they are still applying for international support. The INDC process and the challenges it presents are unique to each country and there is no \\"one-size-fits-all\\" approach or methodology. Opportunities The Climate and Development Knowledge Network prepared a guide for Least Developed Countries (LDCs), setting out an INDC approach that could provide economic and development opportunities. It included: * showing that economic growth is compatible with low-carbon and climate-resilient pathways, which will avoid lock-in to high carbon-intensive infrastructure * highlighting the adaptation-related benefits of mitigation actions, as well as other co-benefits including poverty alleviation, health, energy access and security * capturing the potential for mitigation within planned and potential adaptation activities * encouraging other countries to take equivalent action, increasing global ambition and reducing climate impacts * attracting financial, capacity-building, technology transfer and other types of international support. Integration with national development planning A report from CDKN with the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) made the following recommendations to integrate international climate change commitments into national development planning: *NDCs should be consistent with national development policies *NDCs should follow SMART design principles *NDCs should have broad national support *NDCs should have clear political backing *NDC development should have clear institutional leadership *National coordination for climate change and development actions should exist *NDC institutions should respond to local development needs *NDC spending should be part of national budget planning *NDC spending should be monitored and reported *NDC spending should be subject to national oversight and scrutiny Assessment In November 2019, the Fundaci√≥n Ecol√≥gica Universal (FEU), a global environmental NGO based in Buenos Aires, published an assessment of national climate pledges. Of the 184 INDCs filed, FEU judged 20% to be \\"sufficient\\"; 6% \\"partially sufficient\\"; 4% \\"partially insufficient\\"; and 70% \\"insufficient\\".

The film stars John Travolta, Christopher Meloni, Sam Trammell, Amanda Schull, Rebecca De Mornay, Melissa Bolona and Luis Da Silva. Principal photography on the film began on March 9, 2015, in Columbus, Ohio.  Plot  In the midst of an unprecedented crime wave in the city of Columbus, Ohio, Governor John Meserve (Patrick St. Esprit) gives a press conference about his crime reduction efforts. When questioned by protestors about a proposed pipeline, Meserve promises that he has commissioned an independent study of the pipeline. Abbie Hill (Amanda Schull) and her family are watching the press conference, and they are thrilled that the Governor has referenced the work that her mother Vivian (Rebecca De Mornay) is doing. Vivian heads to the airport to pick up her husband Stanley (John Travolta), who has returned from a job interview to manage a factory in California. When they arrive at their car, they notice one of the tires is flat. Before Stanley can fix it, a man approaches and asks them for money. Stanley politely refuses, but another man sneaks up on Stanley and stuns him with a blow to the head. The first man stabs Vivian and takes her wallet. Stanley watches the men flee. The police use Stanley's descriptions to quickly capture the man who killed Vivian. However, even though Stanley positively identifies him in a lineup, the corrupt police (Gibson and Walker) immediately let him go. This enrages Stanley. After his wife's funeral, Stanley goes home and struggles with his desperation. He throws a bible across the room, which opens to the passage in Jeremiah 6:11, \\"I am filled with the wrath of the Lord.\\" Inspired, Stanley now goes by the name \\"Wrath\\", and now that he knows the name of his wife's killer (Charley), Wrath starts to stalk him. When he sees a carefree Charley on the street, Wrath goes home and retrieves a case from behind a wall. The case has several passports, foreign currencies, and several weapons. He calls Dennis (Christopher Meloni), his friend from Special Forces, and asks him for information about Charley and his crew. Dennis runs black ops from beneath a barbershop. Wrath uses Dennis' intelligence to track down one of the men who attacked him at a local bar. As the man lies dying, he hints that Vivian's murder was more than just a robbery. Wrath and Dennis are photographed as they dispose of the body. Local crime lord Lemi K (Paul Sloan) is furious when he sees the photograph, and he orders hits on the men who killed one of his crew. Wrath tracks down another man who was involved in the attack. He confronts him at a tattoo parlor, after getting the words \\"I Am Wrath\\" tattooed on his back. After killing the man, Wrath makes off with a bag full of drugs and money. Wrath and Dennis use the bag as bait to lure Charley to the VIP room at a Korean nightclub. Before being killed, Charley tells Wrath that Vivian's murder was ordered by Lemi K because she was too nosy. Looking through Vivian's files, Wrath discovers that her study had deemed the pipeline unsafe with an eighty-two percent chance of water contamination. Wrath realizes that Vivian's murder was orchestrated to cover up the results of her study. Lemi K tracks down Wrath's daughter, Abbie, and her little boy, and takes them hostage. Wrath and Dennis arrive and kill Lemi's men. Wrath questions Lemi who reveals that the entire plot was organized by Governor Meserve. The corrupt cops, Gibson and Walker arrive and shoot Lemi dead. After being subdued by Wrath and Dennis, Gibson explains that Lemi was blackmailing the Governor using an incriminating video of Meserve's son, forcing the police to keep Lemi's men out of jail. As part of the deal, Lemi agreed to do jobs for the Governor, such as the hit on Vivian. Wrath forces Gibson to drive him onto the grounds of the Governor's mansion (with Walker stuffed in the trunk of Gibson's car) where he blows up Gibson's car, killing him while Walker barely escapes. Then Wrath infiltrates the Governor's mansion and confronts Meserve, who admits what he's done but plans to murder Wrath to complete the cover-up. After a fight, Wrath overpowers and kills Meserve. When police arrive and train sniper rifles on Wrath--instructing him to drop his weapon-- he instead raises Meserve's shotgun, which prompts the snipers to shoot him down. Fortunately, Wrath was wearing a bulletproof vest, so he survives--he is recovering in a hospital. But Wrath soon learns that he will be denied a jury trial and will be facing a FISA Court instead. Furthermore, he is going to be transferred out of the hospital immediately--without having had a chance to even see his daughter Abbie Abbie is convinced that Wrath will be sent to someplace where he will never be seen again. She bursts into Wrath's hospital room to give him a farewell hug. After the scene is cleared, the two police officers who are guarding Wrath's room are relieved by two replacement cops. One of the replacements is Walker--now demoted to patrolman--who moves into Wrath's room to assassinate him. However, Abby slipped Wrath a gun during their hug and he kills Walker as Dennis enters the room to help him escape. Abbie later receives a postcard from her father, in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, assuring her that he is doing fine.  Cast  Title meaning The movie title comes from Jeremiah chapter 6, verse 11. In the movie, Stanley Hill throws a bible across the room and it opens to the page with the Old Testament and sees the verse \\"I am full of the wrath of the LORD, and I cannot hold it in.\\"https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm  Production  Initially announced in September 2012, the film initially was set to star Nicolas Cage and be directed by William Friedkin. This version did not come to pass, however, and instead a new version starring John Travolta and directed by Chuck Russell was announced in February 2015. Principal photography on the film began on March 9, 2015 in Columbus, Ohio. On March 18, 2015, filming was underway on the steps of Ohio Statehouse, and at a private home in Bexley, Ohio. Film was also shot in Cleveland and Alabama. Paul Sloan was both the movie's screenwriter, and was in the cast, playing the role of crime lord Lemi K.

He signed to Fonovisa Records at the age of 16, releasing El Patroncito (his first solo album) in 2011. In 2014, Olivas moved to Sony's imprint Sahuaro Music. His most recent album, El Privilegio, was released in January 2015 [2]. A song from that album, \\"Mi Porvenir\\", was included in Billboard's chart highlights in the Mexican Regional Music category. The album charted in the number two spot on Billboard's Top Latin Albums (January 29, 2015), and also reached a peak position of number 2 on Billboard's Top Regional Mexican Albums chart. The song \\"Mi Porvenir\\" spent two weeks at #30 for Regional Mexican airplay, with a peak of #26. For the week of March 29, 2015, El Privilegio ranked #61 on the iTunes Top 100 Latin Albums chart. One of his most popular corridos is \\"Las Vacaciones del Jefe\\", (The Boss's Vacation) which is included on El Patroncito, as well as on two compilation albums. This song begins with the line, \\"Yo no he matado a nadie... ultimamente,\\" (I haven't killed anyone... lately). The related video received hundreds of thousands of hits on YouTube. The song reached a peak of #31 on Billboard's Regional Mexican Airplay chart.\\"Latin Regional Mexican Airplay\\" Olivas has composed songs for several notable bands. Los Cuates de Sinaloa recorded Olivas' song \\"Tocando with the Mafia\\", which peaked at number 13 on Billboard's Top Regional Mexican Albums in 2011. Olivas' most recent work moves away from the narcocorrido. He says that cartel violence in Mexico and the birth of his first child have motivated him to create more positive music, in a style known as \\"Norte√±a Romantica\\". He has two solo albums, and many of his songs are included in several compilation albums, which are all collections of narcocorridos. Shooting On February 28, 2015, at the age of 20, Alfredo Olivas was shot eight times while performing on stage in Hidalgo del Parral, Chihuahua, M√©xico.\\"\\", Daniel Borunda, El Paso Times, March 1, 2015. Olivas was singing the song \\"Asi es esto\\", and bent down to toss his jacket to a female fan. The woman's boyfriend and two companions drew guns, firing twenty-four rounds. Olivas and several other men standing in the VIP section in front of the stage were hit. Olivas survived, but two of the other men shot in the incident died from his injuries shortly after. Three gunmen were arrested. The motivation for the shooting may have been jealousy. An audience member captured video of the shooting and later posted it to YouTube.Patricia Mayorga, Processo, February 28, 2015. The city of Chihuahua has banned the performance of narcocorridos as a result of the shootings at Olivas' concert.

Overview Little leaf of brinjal is known to cause heavy economic losses in India. As the name indicates, symptoms of the disease include shortening of the petioles and production of leaves which are much smaller in size. Petioles are so short that leaves seem to be glued to the stem. They become soft and glabrous and somewhat yellow in colour. Affected plants do not bear any flowers or fruits if infection is in early stages of plant growth. However, in cases of late season infections fruits may remain small, become hard and unfit for consumption or marketing. The disease is caused by a plant pathogenic mollicute, Phytoplasma (earlier known as mycoplasmalike organism or MLO) and is transmitted by the insect vector, Hishimonus phycitis which belongs to the group of leafhoppers. Management of the insect vector by means of insecticides and cultivation of resistant varieties are the principal means of management of the disease. Sources *Azadvar Mehdi and Baranwal, V.K. (2012).

In 1977 Otto Gottlieb was the first chemical professional to receive the Fritz Feigl Award, created by Regional Council of Chemistry - Region IV in the same year.[2][4][5] In 1986, he was awarded with the An√≠sio Teixeira Award.[6]  Biography  Otto Richard Gottlieb was born in Brno ( today part of the Czech Republic). In 1936 he went to England due to the imminent rise of the Nazi regime, while his family went to Brazil. Only in 1939 Otto Gottlieb moved to Brazil, where he enrolled in the University of Brazil in the following year. During this period, he worked as an apprentice in the immunology laboratory of Butant√£ Institute and editor for the Qu√≠mica magazine, published by Escola Nacional de Qu√≠mica. At the age of 21, Otto opted for Brazilian nationality and graduated in Chemistry as first of his class at the University of Brazil (today known as the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro - UFRJ). Otto Gottlieb worked for ten years in his father's chemical industry, which manufactured essentials oils from the Brazilian flora that were used as feedstock for the perfume industries. Later on, he decided to join to one of the most prestigious research group on natural products, the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. Otto also received a scholarship of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development and the National Cancer Institute, thus initiating an investigation into the isolation of plant chemicals and the determination of their molecular structures. Gottlieb was always fascinated by the vast and exuberant chemical composition of the Amazon rainforest, so he returned to Brazil in 1961 to take the position of Technologist in the Institute of Agricultural Chemistry (IAC), where he was responsible for major discoveries such as Aniba rosaeodora. At the Rural University of Brazil, today known as Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ), he obtained his doctorate and the title of livre-docente (a Brazilian title). In 1964, Otto worked as a professor in the laboratory of the University of Sheffield, in England, and went to United States of America for a one-month internship at Indiana University. In the same year, he returned to Brazil to monitor the implantation of the phytochemical laboratory at the University of Brasilia (UnB). In 1967, he created the Laborat√≥rio de Qu√≠mica de Produtos Naturais no Instituto de Qu√≠mica da Universidade de S√£o Paulo (Laboratory of Chemistry of Natural Products at the Chemistry Institute of the University of S√£o Paulo) and three years later he retired. Gottlieb mapped hundreds of species and established indices for their behavior, making it possible to measure the biodiversity of ecosystems. His studies also resulted in the discovery of substances such as neolignans, which have an anti-inflammatory effect. Otto Gottlieb remained a professor at the University of S√£o Paulo until he retired at the age of 70. He also worked at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation until 2002, when he moved to Fluminense Federal University. During his life he set up his own library of natural resources with approximately two thousand books. His scientific research resulted in almost 700 articles, all basically about sustainability. Gottlieb is considered the Brazilian scientist who was closest to winning the Nobel Prize, being nominated in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000.[7] He received the TWAS Prize in 1991. He lived in Rio de Janeiro until his death in 19 of June 2011. He is buried in the Israelite Communal Cemetery.

He and his wife Marie Mayoux were imprisoned during World War I (1914‚Äì18) for publishing a pacifist pamphlet. He wrote many articles for anarchist journals. Early years Fran√ßois Mayoux was born on 24 June 1882 in Beaulieu-sur-Sonnette, Charente. He became a teacher, and his partner Marie Mayoux was also a teacher. Marie and Francois taught in Charente, then in Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. They belonged to the F√©d√©ration nationale des Syndicats d'institutrices et instituteurs publics. Socialist During World War I (1914‚Äì18) the Mayouxes were firm pacifists and hostile to the Union sacr√©e. They both joined the socialist French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO: Section fran√ßaise de l'internationale ouvri√®re) in 1915. They were placed on Carnet B. The International Action Committee (CAI: Comit√© d'action internationale) was founded in December 1915 by French syndicalists who supported the pacifist declarations of the Zimmerwald Conference. In 1916 the CAI merged with the Socialist Minority Committee to form the Committee for the Resumption of International Relations (Comit√© pour la r√©prise des r√©lations internationales). In February 1917 the Committee for the Resumption of International Relations split up. Alphonse Merrheim withdrew to concentrate on union work. Pierre Brizon, Jean Raffin-Dugens and Bourderon joining the SFIO minority led by Jean Longuet. The socialists Fernand Loriot, Charles Rappoport, Louise Saumoneau and Fran√ßois Mayoux took control of the committee. In 1917 the Mayouxes were condemned to two years in prison and a heavy fine for published a pacifist brochure entitled \\"The Teachers Union and the War\\". The teacher and pacifist Madeleine Vernet gave a home to their eldest son. Marie was released on 1 April 1919 after ten months. Francois had to wait to be released until the amnesty shortly before the legislative elections of 14 November 1919. Their licenses to teach were revoked, and would not be reinstated until 1924. Communist The Mayouxes left the SFIO in November 1919 and joined the French Communist Party (PCF: Parti communiste fran√ßais) after the Congress of Tours. Francois was secretary of the Union des syndicats des Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne from 1919 to 1921. Marie and Fran√ßois Mayoux were expelled from the PCF at the Party congress held in Paris from 16‚Äì19 October 1922 as \\"unrepentant sydicalists\\". Francois said this was due to their defense of the autonomy of unions from the Communist Party, and their sympathy with the Russian opposition. Anarchist From 1923 to 1936 the Mayouxes published a small bulletin Notre point de vue. They became libertarian, and wrote for anarchist journals such as La Revue Anarchiste, La Voix Libertaire, CQFD, D√©fense de l'Homme and Le Monde Libertaire. In 1929 they were expelled from the Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail unitaire (CGTU), but continued their activism. After being expelled from the CGTU they founded an independent teacher's union. They supported the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) and denounced the Stalinist \\"gravediggers.\\" At the start of World War II (1939‚Äì45) their son Jehan Mayoux, who shared his parents' pacifist convictions, refused conscription and was imprisoned. After the war Francois wrote his memoirs while in retirement in La Ciotat. Fran√ßois Mayoux died on 21 July 1967 at La Ciotat.

Under the new legislation, retailers selling unlicensed copies ‚Äì whether classics or bog-standard bog seats ‚Äì will be liable to fines (..) or jail up to ten years.\\" UK law originally gave a transitional period lasting from 2015 until 2020.https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/404525/Transitional_provisions_for_the_repeal_of_section_52_of_the_CDPA__2_.pdf Before 2020 copyright on a design was going to continue to offer protection for 25 years from creation. After this date copyright will be held by the designer for 70 years following their death. This change brings UK legislation in line with that of other European countries. As a result, companies who are registered in the UK were free to produce and sell replica furniture until that point. Products The items produced by replica furniture companies are typically produced to the same, or very similar, designs as the original products. Sometimes there will be differences with materials and dimensions. They are typically sold at a much lower price-point than products from original manufacturers and dealers such as Skandium and Vitra. This is usually because many replica companies are solely online businesses, hence do not pay showroom costs and many also manufacture their furniture abroad. Some of the most popular designs include Verner Panton‚Äôs Panton Chair, Eames‚Äôs DSW, DSR and DAR Chairs and Arne Jacobsen‚Äôs AJ Lamp series. Legal and Customer Care Issues In May 2014, Infurn.com, one of Europe‚Äôs largest replica furniture companies, filed for insolvency due to ever-mounting debts.https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/may/15/infurn-fury-customers- lose-on-designer-furniture This gained media attention as customers lost thousands of pounds on unfulfilled orders, while many of the company‚Äôs staff‚Äôs wages went unpaid. This led to the foundation of the website stopinfurn.com by disgruntled customers and as of February 2015 many of them are still to be reimbursed. The Replica Furniture Association In 2014 one company, initiated the set-up the Replica Furniture Association in response to the negative press coverage surrounding the closures of Ikon M and Infurn. The goal of the association was to establish a collective of reproduction furniture companies, each of whom must abide by a strict code of ethics to be considered for membership. These values include providing a high standard of customer service, provable financial stability and a high customer satisfaction score. (However, the site and/or initiative does not exist any longer).

Established in 1952, the American International School of Jeddah is a U.S. accredited Pre-K - 12 college preparatory institution.\\" \\" ( ). History It opened in 1952 as the Parent Cooperative School (PCS), with an initial class of 40 students. The school opened to serve children of Trans World Airlines (TWA) employees brought to Saudi Arabia to establish Saudia Airlines, as well as other children. The lack of a formal American curriculum school in Jeddah was an issue TWA employees faced because they needed schools for their children. Parents then formed the Parents Cooperative School (PCS, founded in 1952), in which they volunteered to teach students using a home school curriculum. When the expatriate community kept expanding with time, the school began to notice a rapid growth, and therefore built a new facility in 1968, and again in 1975. In 1976, the North Campus (NCS) was built (by the Raytheon compound) in order to accommodate the rising number of students. By 1985 the school changed its name to Saudi Arabian International School (SAIS), and by the year 2000‚Äì2001, it had its first 12th grade graduation, becoming the first international school in Jeddah that had a diploma program. Until 2004, the school was under the direct auspices and sponsorship of Saudia Airlines, children whose parents are expatriate workers for Saudia Airlines such as pilots and engineers go to school at SAIS where mostly live in Saudia City, Khaledeyah district, as the housing compound of Saudia Airlines expatriates. After 2004, The school changed its name once again to the American International School of Jeddah (AISJ) after Saudia officially announced that they would no longer continue their sponsorship of the school, due to their need to focus solely on the airline business. Since 2005, the school has been run as an independent not-for-profit entity. Accreditation and affiliations As of 2020, the school is accredited and/or in partnership with the following associations: *The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Education *Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA-CESS) *Near East South Asian Council of Overseas Schools (NESA) *American School Counselor Association (ASCA) *Principals Training Center (PTC) Facilities In January 2019, AISJ moved to its new purposefully-built campus in the up-and-coming Mohammadiyah District. The campus includes strategically designed classrooms with learning centers and group work areas, spacious Early Childhood classrooms, and fully-equipped science labs. There are two large Library areas, each with private meeting spaces and large group project areas. The 650-person theatre-style auditorium features a performance stage, an orchestra pit, and an underground practice room. The campus also features modern Athletic Facilities which include two gymnasiums, indoor and outdoor tracks, a full-length soccer field, a shaded swimming pool, an aerobics room, and tennis courts.

The mall is currently anchored by Super Target, Burlington Coat Factory, Hobby Lobby, Stein Mart, Ross, and the Bijou, a theatre operated by Santikos. Excluding the six anchors, there are 45 tenants in the mall, including shops, restaurants, and offices.  History  The mall, originally known as Wonderland Shopping City, was constructed on a 61-acre plot in Balcones Heights, Texas, an enclave city surrounded by San Antonio. At the time of its opening in 1961, the mall boasted 650,000 square feet of air-conditioned shopping area, 62 stores, and two anchors, a 2-level Montgomery Ward in a 149,000 square foot store and a 66,000 square foot Handy Andy supermarket. The Handy Andy was constructed prior to the rest of the mall, opening in May 1959, with John Wayne participating in a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new store. Besides the two anchors, the mall also included a Woolworth's five-and-dime store, a Kinney Shoes outlet, a Zale's Jewelers store, a Sinclair service station, and 5,000 parking spots. At the time of its opening, the mall employed segregated facilities, with \\"Whites Only\\" and \\"Coloreds Only\\" restrooms and water fountains. Soon after the opening, the mall began to expand. In 1963, construction began on a 155,800 square foot Rhodes Brothers department store, which opened the next year. This was soon followed by the construction of the Wonder Theater, which showed its first film in November 1966. Several years after purchasing Rhodes, in August 1977, Liberty House took over the Rhodes department store location. Liberty House didn't succeed in the location, however, and closed in 1980. Their anchor location was, in turn, rebranded as a Frost Brothers in the same year. Small scale renovations also commenced in 1980, providing the mall with a facelift on the exterior and interior. Following a large-scale renovation between Spring 1986 and November 1987, the mall was renamed Crossroads Mall of San Antonio. With the renovations came the addition of a new retail wing and anchor, Stein Mart. The renovations also added new tile flooring, lighting, graphics and skylights to the mall, along with the construction of a parking garage. The renovations, however, would not boost the fortunes of the mall. Frost Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 1988, closing its anchor store the next year. By 1990, the mall was almost half vacant. With its decline in fortunes, the mall rebranded itself from a luxury shopping center to one serving value- oriented consumers. The former Frost Brothers anchor location was replaced by a Burlington Coat Factory in 1991. Hobby Lobby took over the former Handy Andy location in 1994. In 2002, much of the former Montgomery Ward's location was demolished. The site was replaced by the Norris Convention Center, opening in November 2004 and a Super Target, opening in March 2003. The 6-screen theater at the mall also underwent renovations in 2003, becoming a dine-in theater operated by Santikos Theatres. The mall underwent a change of ownership in 2009, with a consortium of San Antonio investors purchasing the property. This group initiated a 10 million dollar renovation project in 2010, commencing with the renaming of the shopping center to Wonderland of the Americas.

He was a specialist steeplechaser who was the first to win the title of American Champion Steeplechase Horse on a record four occasions. In a racing career which lasted from 1982 through 1988 when he turned 8, he ran fifty-one times and won twenty-four races including many of America's most important steeplechases including the Colonial Cup (four times). Flatterer also became one of the few American-trained horses to compete successfully in the United Kingdom, placing second in the Champion Hurdle in 1987 and also in France, placing second in the French Champion Hurdle1986. Flatterer was the first American steeplechaser to live to the age of 35. Background Flatterer, who was foaled June 5, 1979, was a dark bay horse who was bred in Pennsylvania by William L. Pape and Jonathan E. Sheppard. Flatterer was originally intended for a career in flat racing, but was unable to show much potential in this area having eighteen starts only four wins, placing second twice, and third twice. After showing that he was unsuitable for flat racing, Flatterer was given his chance at Steeplechasing. He was trained by Jonathan E. Sheppard and ridden in most of his races by Jerry Fishback, who led him to 9 victories. He was sired by Mo Bay out of the mare Horizontal by Nade, a horse with the pedigree including Nasrullah who shows up in four other champion steeplechasing horses. Racing career Flatterer did not begin his racing career until he was a three-year-old in 1982, when he won four flat races from eighteen starts, this is where trainer Jonathan E. Sheppard decided \\"He simply wasn't quite fast enough to have any sort of breather in flat races, he had to go all out to keep up. We'd eventually lose him in claiming races. I thought jumping races might suit him just fine.\\". As a four-year-old, Flatterer was switched over to the world of steeplechasing and won six of his ten starts where he earned $93,064. In 1983, he was placed to compete for the Eclipse Award in the Colonial Cup, where he placed first, and continued winning for three more years after that in 1984, 1985, and 1986. In between these four years, Flatterer took his chance in other races. These races included the Temple Gwathmey in 1983 and 1985, Grand National 1983, New York Turf Writers Cup 1984, and placed first in all of these events. Later he was sent over seas to France where he placed second at the French Champion Hurdle in 1986 and later the next year also came in second during the English Champion Hurdle. After these two races trainer Sheppard claimed ‚ÄúThat was another remarkable effort. The two best races he ran might have been two of the few races he actually lost. They were superb efforts. On your own ground, doing your own thing against horses you run against at home, running in top-class races is difficult. To do it away from home, on unfamiliar ground and over unfamiliar fences is something special.‚Äù In 1987 at the age of eight, Flatterer competed in his final races. He had started in five, won two of them, came second in one, and also placed third in one. During this final stretch, he earned a total of $79,602. Over his entire steeplechasing career, Flatterer earned a grand total of $538,708 United States Dollars. Retirement Flatterer was retired from racing after his final races in 1987, he was 8. He returned to his owner William Pape's farm (My Way Farm) in Unionville, PA where he remained active doing dressage work and spending much of his time with a younger mare named My Tombola. Owner William Pape shares that ‚ÄúThe two of them get along extremely well, and these older guys, with the younger women‚Ä¶well, it moves them up and keeps them sound.‚Äù In 2014, Flatterer died at the age of 35 becoming one of the longest living thoroughbreds, and author Barbara Livingston from the Daily Racing Form claims that \\"Thoroughbreds rarely reach the benchmark of 30, let alone 33\\".

Built in 1901, the station served trains on the Wabash Railroad, the most economically significant railroad through Decatur. Architect Theodore Link designed the Classical Revival building. Service to the station ended in the 1980s, and it has since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The railroad first reached Decatur in 1854, when the Great Western Railroad built a line through the city. Decatur built Union Station, its first railway station, in 1856 to serve this line. By 1901, the Great Western Railroad had consolidated into the Wabash Railroad, and the old Union Station had fallen into disrepair. The railroad built the present station that year at a cost of $70,000; railroad superintendent H. L. Magee considered the new building one of the most impressive on the line. The Wabash Railroad was the only east-west railroad through Decatur, and its passenger and freight services in the city were both busy. 72 daily passenger trains brought travelers to and from the city at the line's peak in 1907, and $350,000 to $400,000 worth of freight was shipped through the station yearly. The railroad was also Decatur's largest employer; as Decatur was a major hub, it kept division offices and a large dispatcher force there as well as employing railroad operators from the city. Passenger service from the station began to decline in the 1920s, though the railroad (which later merged into the Norfolk & Western) continued service to Decatur until the formation of Amtrak in 1971. Amtrak unsuccessfully attempted to restart service with the Illini in 1981, but the service only lasted until 1983 and the station closed for good. The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 4, 1994; it is the only remaining historic railroad station in Decatur. Architecture St. Louis architect Theodore Link designed the station in the Classical Revival style. The station consists of two unconnected parts, built in a similar style from the same materials; the station building itself and the Railway Express Agency building. Both buildings are two stories tall and were built from yellow brick and limestone with terra cotta and sandstone trim. The station's main and east entrances are topped by a pediment with ornamental modillions and flanked by Ionic pilasters. The station's first-floor windows have arched sandstone frames and sills, and two terra cotta belt courses circle the building above and below the second floor The corners of the building have limestone quoins.

He was a successful stayer on the flat and was a top class hurdler under National Hunt rules, switching between the two codes in a racing career which lasted from October 1987 until January 1993. Racing on the flat, he won the Cesarewitch Handicap, finished second in the Chester Cup and the Queen Alexandra Stakes and took fourth place in the Ascot Gold Cup. When campaigned over hurdles he won the Irish Champion Hurdle in 1990 and the Stayers' Hurdle in 1992 and twice finished second in the Champion Hurdle. He also finished second in the Bula Hurdle (twice), the Fighting Fifth Hurdle and the Aintree Hurdle. At the end of his racing career he was retired to stud and sired some good steeplechasers. He died in 2012 at the age of twenty-seven. Background Nomadic Way was a small bay horse with a white star and a white sock on his left hind leg, bred in Kentucky by his owner, Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Assert, who won the Prix du Jockey Club, Irish Derby, Benson & Hedges Gold Cup and Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes in 1982. Assert other good winners including Dancehall (Grand Prix de Paris), Timely Assertion (Santa Anita Oaks), All My Dreams (Deutsches Derby) and Running Flame (Hollywood Turf Cup). Nomadic Way's dam Kittyhawk was a high-class racemare who won the Lowther Stakes in 1981 and the Park Stakes in 1982. Kittyhawk's dam Sky Fever is also the female-line ancestor of the leading French filly Golden Lilac. Sangster sent the horse to Europe where he was trained throughout his racing career by Barry Hills at Lambourn. Nomadic Way usually raced in blinkers. Unlike most National Hunt horses, he was never gelded. Racing career 1987 & 1988: Early flat racing career Nomadic Way made his only appearance as a two- year-old when finishing ninth in a sixteen-runner maiden race over one mile at Warwick Racecourse in October. In their annual Racehorses of 1987, Timeform commented that he was \\"sure to improve\\". In 1988, Nomadic Way finished fourth two in maiden races over eleven and a half furlongs at Bath Racecourse before being moved up in distance. At Beverley Racecourse on 14 June, ridden by Richard Hills, he recorded his first success in a two-mile handicap race, winning by three lengths. Richard Hills' twin brother Michael then took over the ride and partnered the horse when he followed up with further victories at Chester on 22 June and Newbury six days later. After being beaten in his next three races, Nomadic Way returned to winning form at Haydock Park Racecourse in September, winning a handicap over two miles and three furlongs by eight lengths. On 15 October Nomadic Way was one of twenty-four runners for the 148th running of the Cesarewitch Handicap over two and a quarter miles at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Willie Carson and carrying 107 pounds he started the 6/1 joint-favourite alongside the Guy Harwood-trained Zero Watt. Carson sent the colt into the lead three furlongs from the finish and he stayed on well in the closing stages to win by a neck from the lightly weighted four-year-old Double Dutch. 1988/1989 National Hunt season: novice hurdle races Three weeks after his win in the Cesarewitch, Nomadic Way made his National Hunt debut in a Novice hurdle at Sandown Park Racecourse. He won by four lengths from Rowlandsons Gems and followed up by winning the Aurelius Hurdle at Ascot two weeks later. When moved up in class for the Listed Placepot Hurdle at Kempton in February he finished second, eight lengths behind Royal Derbi and five lengths clear of the favourite Magnus Pym. On his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival Nomadic Way was one of twenty- seven four-year-olds to contest the Triumph Hurdle on 16 March. Starting the 11/2 joint-favourite alongside the Finale Junior Hurdle winner Enemy Action, he finished eighth behind the 66/1 outsider Ikdam who won by one and a half lengths from Highland Bud. 1989 Flat season Nomadic Way returned to the flat a month after his run at Cheltenham and won a handicap race over one and three quarter miles at Newmarket, taking the lead inside the final furlong and beating Stratford Ponds by half a length. Two weeks later at the same course he finished second to Arizelos in a two-mile handicap. At Royal Ascot in June he was moved up in class for the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles and stayed on in the straight to finish fourth behind Sadeem. In his two remaining races that season he finished sixth when joint-favourite for a handicap at Newmarket in July and third (returning after a three-month break) in the Listed George Stubbs Stakes on 3 November. 1989/1990 National Hunt season In the 1989/1990 National Hunt season, Nomadic Way began to compete against more experienced hurdlers, beginning his campaign by finishing third behind Cruising Altitude and Morley Street in the Gerry Feilden Hurdle at Newbury on 25 November. On his next appearance, in the Bula Hurdle, Nomadic Way was beaten a head by Cruising Altitude, with the reigning Champion Hurdler Beech Road in third ahead of Floyd. The horse was then sent to Ireland where he contested the Irish Champion Hurdle over two miles at Leopardstown Racecourse on 10 February. Ridden by Brendan Powell, he started the 3/1 second favourite behind the Jim Bolger-trained Elementary, and recorded his biggest win over obstacles up to that time, beating Elementary by six lengths. On 13 March at the Cheltenham Festival, Nomadic Way ridden by Peter Scudamore, started 8/1 third favourite behind Beech Road and Kribensis for the 61st running of the Champion Hurdle. The other contenders included Morley Street, Cruising Altitude, Elementary, Deep Sensation and See You Then. Nomadic Way raced in second behind the 150/1 outsider Sudden Victory before taking the lead at the fifth hurdle. He maintained his advantage until the final flight where he was overtaken by Kribensis but stayed on in the closing stages to finish second, three lengths behind Kribensis and three quarters of a length ahead of Past Glories. In April Nomadic Way was sent to the United States to contest the Dueling Grounds International at Kentucky Downs where he finished sixth behind the Irish mare Grabel. 1990/1991 National Hunt season Nomadic Way was off the course for more than nine months before returning in February 1991 to attempt to repeat his 1990 success in the Irish Champion Hurdle. Ridden by Scudamore, he started 11/10 favourite but was beaten three lengths by the four-year-old Nordic Surprise with the Galway Hurdle winner Athy Spirit in third. He then started odds-on favourite at Haydock on 1 March but finished third behind Sondrio and Riverhead, conceding eight pounds to the first two. Eleven days later Nomadic way made his second bid to win the Champion Hurdle and started 9/1 fourth favourite behind Morley Street, Beech Road and the Christmas Hurdle winner Fidway. Ridden by Richard Dunwoody, he led over the first two hurdles and remained in contention before staying on in the closing stages to finish second again, one and a half lengths behind Morley Street and a head in front of Ruling. The other beaten horses included Mole Board, Bradbury Star, Wonder Man, Royal Derbi, Deep Sensation, Athy Spirit, Riverhead, Sondrio and Sybillin. Four weeks later, Nomadic Way faced Morley Street again in the Aintree Hurdle over two and a half miles. He took the lead three hurdles out but was overtaken by his rival at the final flight and was beaten into second place by six lengths. 1991 Flat season Nomadic Way returned to the flat for a final time in 1991 and ran in three more races. After finishing fourth in a two-mile handicap at Newmarket in April he carried 138 pounds in the Chester Cup on 8 May. Ridden by Pat Eddery he was sixth on the final turn and finished well to take second place, one and a half lengths behind Star Player, a five-year-old to whom he was conceding sixteen pounds. At Royal Ascot in June he was again ridden by Eddery when he started 2/1 favourite for the two and three quarter mile Queen Alexandra Stakes. After tracking the leaders he took the lead in the straight but was quickly overtaken and beaten seven lengths by the Jim Bolger-trained four- year-old Easy To Please. 1991/1992 National Hunt season On 23 November 1991, Nomadic Way was matched against Sybillin, Royal Derbi and Sybillin in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle over two miles at Newcastle Racecourse. He recovered from being badly hampered on the final turn to finish second, a neck behind the winner Royal Derbi. In the Bula Hurdle at Cheltenham on 7 December he again finished a neck second to Royal Derbi, with Ruling, Fidway and Oh So Risky in third, fourth and fifth. Twenty-four days later Nomadic Way was moved up in distance to contest the Spa Hurdle over two and a half miles at Cheltenham. He started the 8/13 favourite and took the lead at the second last but was aoutpaced in the closing stages and finished third behind Cab On Target and Winnie The Witch. On 10 March 1993, Nomadic Way appeared for the fourth time at the Cheltenham Festival when he was one of seventeen horses to contest the twenty-first running of the Stayers' Hurdle over three miles and a furlong. Ridden by Jamie Osborne, he started the 15/2 fourth choice in the betting behind the 1990 winner Trapper John, and the Sun Alliance Novices' Hurdle winners Crystal Spirit and Forest Sun. The other runners included Rustle (winner of the race in 1989), Ubu III (Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil), Tyrone Bridge (Challow Novices' Hurdle) and Derring Valley (Sefton Novices' Hurdle). Osborne settled the horse just behind the leaders as the field stayed closely grouped on the first circuit. At the tenth hurdle (four from the finish), he moved up on the inside to dispute the lead with Crystal Spirit and the pair raced together until Nomadic Way opened up a clear advantage at the final hurdle. He stayed on strongly up the run-in to win by three and a half lengths from Ubu III and the subsequently disqualified Trapper John with Crystal Spirit in fourth place. Osborne described the race as \\"a steering job\\". 1992/1993 National Hunt season Nomadic Way remained in training for the 1992/1993 National Hunt season but failed to win in three races. On 31 October at Wetherby Racecourse he started favourite for the West Yorkshire Hurdle but finished second of the eight runners, beaten five lengths by Burgoyne, to whom he was conceding seven pounds. He started favourite again for the Grade 2 Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury but finished tailed-off in last place in a race won by Tyrone Bridge. In January Nomadic Way ran his final race in the Group 1 Wyko Power Transmission Hurdle at Cheltenham in which he finished second to Muse. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Nomadic Way was retired to become a National Hunt stallion at the Louella stud in Leicestershire. The most successful of his offspring included Buckby Lane (Ladbrokes Trophy Chase) and Himalayan Trail (Midlands Grand National). Nomadic Way died in May 2012 at the age of twenty-seven. Barry Hills called him \\"a lovely horse who was not over-big but very tough and he stayed really well. His win in the Stayers' gave me as much pleasure as any winner I had\\".

By February 2015, the company was capitalised at ¬£2.3 billion (US$3.1 billion) on the London Stock Exchange. In 2019, Indivior was indicted over claims that it had made false marketing claims about the effectiveness of its drug, Suboxone, and had concocted a scheme to direct patients towards doctors who were likely to prescribe Suboxone. Reckitt Benckiser has settled with the Justice Department to pay $1.4 billion to resolve a U.S. Federal investigation into sales and marketing of opioid addiction treatment. In July 2020, Indivior Solutions, Indivior Inc., and Indivior plc agreed to pay $600 million to resolve liability related to false marketing of Suboxone to MassHealth for use by patients with children under the age of six years old. Additionally, Indivior Solutions pled guilty to one-count of felony information. Operations The company's main products are Subutex and its Naloxone-combined preparation Suboxone, both substitution products for opioid addiction.

Wilcox led the Webfoots (now Ducks) to the 1958 Rose Bowl, which they lost 10‚Äì7. He graduated from Oregon in 1959. Playing career Wilcox was small for a defensive end, drafted late by the Philadelphia Eagles in 1960. He played 12 games while the Eagles won the NFL title that year. Rather than return to the team, Wilcox decided to retire, citing the small salary ($7,500) and the toil it might have taken on his body. Later life With the money he earned from playing football, he bought a house. He originally wanted to enter the military draft, but he decided to instead be a teacher and coach, in part due to deferments offered by the President for math and science teachers. After a few stints at high schools in Portland and Boise, he arrived at Whitman College in 1967. He served as an assistant coach at Whitman College from 1967 to 1975, as they won a share of the conference title.

Women make up a small (usually less than 10%) fraction of the venture capital private equity workforce. A widely used source for tracking the number of women in venture capital is the Midas List which has been published by Forbes since 2001. One of the first women to make the list, Annette Campbell-White, has been cited as an example of discrimination in venture capital. She was mentioned in the Midas List for three consecutive years, from 2005 to 2007. She claimed that a number of firms in the 1980s ignored her senior management experience in Hambrecht & Quist. In addition to finding that women make up the majority of early technology adopters, Harvard Business School Professor Paul Gompers has stated that female venture capitalists consistently perform as well as males at large firms that have more than one woman. Questions about how to increase the number of VC opportunities for women have been brought to the forefront by several events. One of them is a lawsuit by Ellen Pao against her former employer Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Another is Elephant in the Valley, a survey aiming to expose discrimination started by several women in business including Tracy Vassallo, a former partner of the same firm. Expressing criticism of existing funds, a number of women since 2007 have begun to start their own. Statistics Babson College‚Äôs Diana Report, research by an initiative working to increase the number of women entrepreneurs, found that the number of women partners in VC firms decreased from 10% in 1999 to 6% in 2014, though that number has recovered to 9.5% in 2018. The report also found that 97% of VC-funded businesses had male chief executives, and that businesses with all- male teams were more than four times as likely to receive VC funding compared to teams with at least one woman. More than 75% of VC firms in the US did not have any female venture capitalists at the time they were surveyed. It was found that a greater fraction of VC firms had never had a woman represent them on the board of one of their portfolio companies. For comparison, a UC Davis study focusing on large public companies in California found 49.5% with at least one female board seat. When the latter results were published, some San Jose Mercury News readers dismissed the possibility that sexism was a cause. In a follow-up Newsweek article, Nina Burleigh asked \\"Where were all these offended people when women like Heidi Roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick her hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed?\\" Effect on the technology industry Makers of software and related products receive the majority of venture capital funding in the US. Since the dot com boom, venture capital has become almost synonymous with technology startups due to the large potential investors see in this sector. Regarding the shortage of women in the industry, some venture capitalists have called this a contributing factor to similar gender disparity seen in a wider range of Silicon Valley companies. These Silicon Valley leadership positions are mostly held by men, with only 15.7% of board members being women, according to a report by Fenwick & West. This compares negatively to the 20.9% across all S&P; 100 firms. These numbers drop to 11% and 16% respectively when considering executive positions. Industry scholar Vivek Wadhwa has proposed that another contributing factor is a lack of parental encouragement to study science and engineering. He has also cited a lack of women role models and noted that most famous tech leaders like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg are men. 2014 saw the release of several corporate transparency reports that offered detailed employee breakdowns. The largest contributors were Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Apple, who respectively reported that 17%, 15%, 15% and 20% of their tech employees were women. Subsequent commentary in USA Today pointed out that \\"women are underrepresented in Silicon Valley ‚Äî from giant companies to start-ups to venture capital firms.\\" In October of that year, Bloomberg reported that Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft attended the 20th annual Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference to recruit and potentially hire female engineers and technology experts. That same month, the second annual Platform Summit was held to discuss increasing racial and gender diversity in tech. Notable cases The 2012 lawsuit Pao v. Kleiner Perkins was filed in San Francisco County Superior Court by executive Ellen Pao for gender discrimination against her employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The case went to trial in February 2015. On March 27, 2015 the jury found in favor of Kleiner Perkins on all counts. Nevertheless, the case, which had wide press coverage, resulted in major advances in consciousness of gender discrimination on the part of venture capital and technology firms and their women employees. Three later cases, one of which was dropped, include lawsuits against Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft.  Possible solutions  Women are far outnumbered by their male counterparts in venture capital. Eileen Lee, cofounder of Cowboy Ventures, one of the most prominent women in venture capital in Silicon Valley, started a group with fellow women in venture capital who seek \\"to both mentor and increase the number of women founders and women in venture capital\\". Groups that advocate for women in venture capital and help them find positions in the field are seeking to break down gender biases and stereotypes that prevent women from succeeding in venture capital to begin with. There are steps that can be taken within the venture capital field to help women in the industry. One of the ways in which more women can obtain jobs in venture capital is to increase the number of women in U.S. graduate school business programs. According to Joan Winn in her journal article ‚ÄúWomen Entrepreneurs: Can We Remove The Barriers?‚Äù, one-third of the individuals enrolled in graduate school business programs were women. Many graduate business programs try to recruit women, yet are unsuccessful in doing so. Winn believes that if these universities were to cater their programs more towards women by accommodating their obligations to work and family needs, their percentages of women would be higher. Enrollment in a graduate business program would prepare them for the venture capital field. Winn says that one of the main problems women face is a lack of funding or capital for their ventures. According to Fortune, funding for female venture capital founders was 2.2% of all venture capital dollars in 2018. Although women-founded venture capital firms are far less prevalent than male-founded firms, the disparity of the disbursement of venture capital dollars is high. The most plausible solution to this issue is to provide more funding for venture capital funds led by women. Having sufficient funding will generate more capital for their firms, allowing women to feel comfortable with making investments, especially where there is risk. List of women in venture capital Ellen Pao, who began her venture capital career at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has also worked as an executive for Reddit, Flipboard and other technology companies.Elias, Paul.

It operates on both the Proastiakos (suburban rail) line as a well as Line 3 of the Athens Metro. It is the first and only train station in Greece that is not managed by GaiOSE, a subsidiary of OSE, the national rail company. It is owned by the airport, which charges the train operating companies (TrainOSE and STASY) fees to use it. History The station opened on 30 July 2004, two weeks before the Athens Olympics. Although it was projected that only commuter rail would use the station, the Athens Metro operating company decided to extend Line 3 to the airport. However, building new tracks was not economically viable, so the route would be served by dual-voltage second-generation trains and would share tracks with Proastiakos trains between Doukissis Plakentias station and the airport. Because of the limited availability of these trains (7 in total), only 2 per hour reach the station, leaving the airport every 30 minutes from 06:32 to 23:32. The decision to extend Line 3 to the airport forced a change to the station design; metro trains have a higher floor than Proastiakos trains, so the central track had to be lowered. This is why initial services to the airport did not use any stations between Doukissis Plakentias and the airport. The intermediate stations did not have the tracks lowered; parts of the platforms were raised in 2006. Since then, all intermediate stations have been used by both services. Platforms Athens Airport Station has two island platforms and three tracks. Track 1 is not used due to low traffic, Track 2 is used by the Metro, and Track 3 is used by Proastiakos. All trains terminate at this station. Access The railway station is immediately adjacent to the airport terminal, which is accessible by an elevated walkway. Because of the additional cost of using the station, there is a surcharge for passengers entering or exiting at the airport. As of 2020, the base fare to the airport is ‚Ç¨9 with varying prices for round trips or groups. Future developments As the airport's passenger numbers are rising, services may get denser and Track 1 could be used again. Moreover, for many years there have been plans to extend Proastiakos services to Rafina, a suburb of Athens and the third largest harbour of the city as well. Although original plans show the line branching off the main one after Pallini or Doukissis Plakentias Station, then running in a reserved-for-this-purpose median of the A64 Mount Hymmetus Ring Road and then extending to Rafina, recent plans have called for an extension of the line from the Airport. Such an extension would be shorter and less expensive to build, however, it has been unpopular due to the fact that the travelling time from and to Rafina will be longer and certain areas will not be served.

(2016), The Abell 85 BCG: A Nucleated, Coreless Galaxy  Supermassive black hole  It has been alleged that the primary component of the galactic core is a supermassive black hole with a mass of 40 billion solar masses (), although no direct measurement has yet been made. Previous estimates by Lauer et al. have jointed a mass value as high as 310 billion using the gamma ray point break radius method. Kormendy and Bender gave a value of 260 billion in a 2009 paper. Lower estimates were given by Kormendy and Ho et al. in 2013 at 2.1 and 9.2 billion . The paper by Lopez-Cruz et al. stated: \\"Therefore, we conservatively suggest that Holm 15A hosts an SMBH with a mass of ‚àº1 .\\" Kormendy and Ho et al derived these equations using the M-sigma relation and the size of the outer bulge of the galaxy, which are indirect estimates. Rusli et al derived a value of 170 billion using break radius methodology. In addition, Abell 85 has its velocity dispersion of dark matter halo at ~750 km/s, which could only be explained by a black hole with a mass greater than 150 billion , although Kormendy and Ho et al stated that \\"dark matter halos are scale-free, and the SMBH-dark matter coevolution is independent from the effects of baryons\\". This makes it one of the most massive black holes ever discovered, with it being classified as an ultramassive black hole.  References  * Measures SMBH mass as .

The gearbox is usually incorporated into the frame near the crank, and it may be used in addition to or instead of derailleur gears or a hub gear. Cited advantages include improved shifting performance, protecting the gearing from damage and exposure to dirt and moisture, as with hub gears, plus locating the additional mass between the two wheels and on the frame where it may be suspended, unlike with hub gears.  History  Patents for built-in systems to change gear ratios appeared as early as 1890. Adler offered a three-speed gearbox bicycle in the 1930s. Several attempts to develop gearbox bicycles during the 2000s for downhill racing, such as the Honda RN-01 G-cross, incorporated complete derailleur gear drive trains in an enclosure. Around the same time Schlumpf Innovations and Hammerschmidt offered cranksets with two different gear ratios and just one chainring. Pinion launched their spur-gear system in the 2010s.

Hogben was also involved in the hunt for the Kriegsmarine battleship Bismarck in 1941 and served during the Battle of the Barents Sea in 1942, ultimately earning the Distinguished Service Cross and the American Bronze Star Medal for his wartime service. After World War II, Hogben found employment as a civilian meteorologist before working for Imperial Chemical Industries in multiple postings across Europe. In his later life, he retired to southern France and was an active member of Rotary International. Early life and education Hogben was born George Lawrence Hogben in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1916. He attended Auckland Grammar School, graduating in 1933, and went on to study mathematics at Auckland University College. Hogben received the highest final grade for mathematics in New Zealand upon his graduation in 1938, and was subsequently awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University. World War II Upon the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Hogben joined the Royal Navy directly from Oxford as an instructor-lieutenant. He studied at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and served for three years as an intelligence officer, radar operator and meteorologist aboard the cruiser HMS Sheffield. In 1941, Hogben joined the newly formed Royal New Zealand Navy, though he continued to serve aboard British ships. Hunt for the Bismarck On 24 May 1941, the German battleship Bismarck sank the British battlecruiser HMS Hood at the Battle of the Denmark Strait. Hogben's cruiser, HMS Sheffield, was among the Royal Navy vessels subsequently tasked to pursue and destroy the Bismarck. Hogben detected the German battleship on his radar, and reported its location for the Navy's torpedo bombers. However, on 26 May, the Sheffield itself was briefly mistaken for the Bismarck and targeted by aircraft from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal, whose torpedoes narrowly missed the Sheffield. Later that day, Hogben assisted the bombers in pinpointing the Bismarcks location, and he witnessed its destruction on 27 May. Battle of the Barents Sea On 31 December 1942, Hogben's HMS Sheffield participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea, in which a force of British cruisers and destroyers successfully defended a merchant convoy against multiple German warships, including the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper. Hogben served as the chief officer of the Sheffields radar plotting office during the battle, and was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for his efforts to locate and target the German ships amid a heavy snowstorm. D-Day preparations In the summer of 1944, Hogben joined the teams of Allied meteorologists based at Southwick, Hampshire, who were involved in the planning of Operation Neptune, the amphibious invasion of German-occupied Normandy. He was on the Naval team with both Royal Navy meteorologists and civilian consultants, including Americans who had previously provided weather forecasts for Hollywood film directors; see Normandy landings. He thought that the leader of the three teams, Group Captain James Stagg was self-important and a \\"glory hound\\".* The Operation Neptune commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, initially planned to begin the Normandy landings on 5 June, due to the coincidence of a full moon and low tide. However, after extensive debate, Hogben and his colleagues convinced Eisenhower to launch the invasion on 6 June instead, to avoid storm conditions that could potentially have crippled the Allied fleet. After the success of the D-Day landings, Hogben received the Bronze Star Medal for his meteorological advice. Postwar career After the war, Hogben worked in the film industry as a meteorologist for the Rank Organisation, and earned a PhD from Imperial College London. Thereafter, he spent 35 years working in various roles for Imperial Chemical Industries, with postings across Britain and Europe. Upon Hogben's retirement, he was refused British citizenship, as he had not resided in the UK long enough to be eligible. He thus settled in the town of Crest in the Dr√¥me region of southern France, where he lived until his death in 2015. Personal life Hogben married Elaine Carter, who he met while studying at Oxford; she predeceased him in 2010. Hogben and his wife were survived by their children, Sandra and Julius. Hogben was a fluent speaker of French, German, Spanish and Russian. During his retirement in Crest, he was an active Rotarian and helped establish a local goat's cheese festival. In 2004, Hogben was made an honorary citizen of Crest for his role in the Allied liberation of France. Hogben retained his New Zealand passport throughout his life.

It used a variety of techniques to improve the firing rate of the gun, and the velocity of its projectiles. Although a prototype was built and survives today, it was rendered obsolete by the development of the guided surface-to-air missile and thus never entered production. History Green Mace was the Rainbow Code assigned to the QF 127/58 SBT X1 during its development. The original specifications were for a 5-inch gun with water-cooled barrel, firing folding-fin discarding sabot dart projectiles. Two rotary magazines, each holding 14 rounds, would allow for a high rate of fire on the order of 75 rounds per minute (RPM). The gun was developed by Vickers under the direction of the Royal Armaments Research and Development Establishment at Fort Halstead. It demonstrated a firing rate as high as 96 rounds per minute, about six times that of the famous 8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41 . Development A proof of concept prototype was built with a 4.02 inch (102 mm) barrel, but otherwise was as intended. It was mostly automatic, and could be operated by a single person sitting in a covered control cabin on the right hand side of the vehicle. However, the enormous power and ammunition requirements for the piece resulted in it having to have two trailers in support - one for power, and one for ammunition - and a crew with a small crane in order to reload the two ammunition drums. With only 28 rounds available in the drums, and an 80-90 rounds/minute fire rate, reloading was a frequent task. It took a crew between ten and fifteen minutes to reload. With the advent of guided missiles, and the transfer of responsibility for ground-based, anti-aircraft defence of UK airspace from the British Army to the Royal Air Force, the project was cancelled in 1957.  Other versions  The ammunition drums on the back of Green Mace, holding 14 rounds each. Some sources suggest that a naval version of Green Mace was planned as a new dual purpose gun for the Royal Navy's destroyers, and a twin version of the same gun intended for cruisers reached the design stage, but neither went any further, and they were cancelled outright in 1957. Original work was done on two other projects: Longhand and Ratefixer. Both were of smaller calibre than Green Mace but were designed to try and increase the rate of fire and calibre used. Similar concepts were also said to be used in the Red Queen gun, which was essentially a medium-weight version of Green Mace.

She was a leader of the Socialist Party of the Southeast and one of the first three women elected to a legislative body in Mexico. She collaborated with writers and poets from Mexico and Cuba publishing numerous works. Biography Beatriz Peniche Barrera was born on 7 November 1893 in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, Mexico. She was the daughter of Primitivo Peniche Peniche and Aurora Barrera Zapata. From an early age she showed sensitivity and was given piano and mandolin lessons. She had a particular love for poetry and was enrolled in the Instituto Literario de Ni√±as (ILN) (Literary Institute for Girls) under the tutelage of Rita Cetina Guti√©rrez. Peniche graduated as a teacher in 1913 and went to work as an elementary teacher for girls at the school of Fidelia C√°mara. Shortly after the 1915 arrival of Governor Salvador Alvarado into Yucat√°n, Peniche was named as the Director of the Manuel Cepeda Library. She participated in the First Feminist Congress of Mexico which occurred in 1916 in M√©rida under Alvarado' direction. In 1922, she helped found the Feminist League of Yucat√°n, as part of the Socialist Party of the Southeast with Elvia Carrillo Puerto, Raquel Dzib Cicero, Rosa Torre Gonz√°lez, Adolfina Valencia and Consuelo Zavala. With the collaboration of Governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto in 1923, Peniche organized the Congress of Journalists meeting held in M√©rida that year. On November 18, 1923, three candidates who were members of the Liga Rita Cetina Gutierrez (League of Rita Cetina Guti√©rrez) were elected to the local legislature as candidates of the Socialist Party of the Southeast. Peniche was elected for the second district of the City of M√©rida, Elvia Carrillo Puerto elected by the District of Izamal, and Raquel Dzib Cicero by the third district of M√©rida. Their triumph at the polls was short-lived, as the women were forced out when governor Carrillo Puerto was assassinated in 1924. Peniche was invited by a group of writers to come and collaborate in Cuba. Arriving on 6 April 1925, she remained for about a year. Thereafter, she made regular trips to Cuba and sometimes stayed as long as six months at a time. Her collaborations from this period in Havana appeared in the journals Diario de la Marina (Journal of the Sea) and Mujeres y Bohemia (Women and Bohemia). As part of a Yucatecan state project to open new media markets, Peniche helped create the Diario del Sureste (Journal of the Southeast) in 1931 and at the beginning of the next decade, around 1943, she and other local writers founded a literary society called Juana de Asbaje. Throughout her life, Peniche published poems and articles in her own name and under the pseudonyms \\"Miosotis\\" and \\"Betty\\". She published a regular column, called Prismas (Prisms), which appeared in many publications throughout the region. Peniche married fellow poet, Miguel Ponce Casares (31 January 1890 ‚Äì 8 February 1978) on 27 November 1915. They had a daughter, Yolanda Ponce Peniche. Peniche died 27 November 1976.

History San Mateo County was created by exclusion from the City and County of San Francisco when it was incorporated in 1856; San Mateo County was re-established by an act passed on April 18, 1857, which also made Redwood City the county seat and included provisions for the first County Court, with sessions to be held in March, June, and November of each year. direct URL The first County Judge was the honorable Benjamin I. Fox (1804‚Äì69), who served from 1856 to 1860; court was held in a storehouse on Redwood Creek, rented from J.V. Diller for $40/month. The original two-storey County courthouse ('Grist Mill') was completed in February 1858 on land donated to the County by Simon Mezes. Mezes also donated land that was used for local parks (California Square, which is now the site of the Hall of Justice and Records, and Mezes Park). The 'Grist Mill' courthouse was designed with a jail in the basement, courtroom and government offices on the first floor, and a community hall on the second floor. The top floor was destroyed in the October 1868 Hayward earthquake, and a second courthouse ('Justice') was built in 1882, using the remaining ground floor as an annex. That year, George H. Buck was elected as the San Mateo County District Attorney; he won election as the County Judge in 1890 and served as the sole judge in the county until 1932, presiding over 20,000 cases, including the famous Flood Estate Case (1931). Third courthouse, after it was partially destroyed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake A contract for the third courthouse was awarded in 1903, to be built according to plans by Dodge & Dolliver; the cornerstone was laid in May 1904 and it was completed behind the existing 1882/1858 courthouse in 1906, but both were destroyed shortly thereafter in the April 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The 1882 courthouse had been sold for $205 just two weeks before the earthquake. A fourth county courthouse ('Temple of Justice') was built around the surviving dome of the third and completed in 1910. During the demolition of the ruins of the third courthouse, the dome itself was found to have caused some of the destruction: because it was inadequately secured to its foundation, the iron supporting structure had swayed like a pendulum. The 1910 courthouse was accepted by the county board of supervisors on May 4; the cost was and the architect, Glenn Allen, was awarded 5 per cent of that sum for supervising the construction. A scandal had erupted in 1909 over partial payments made to the contractor before the physical construction was completed, on Allen's recommendation as overseer; although those charges were proven untrue, Allen was later accused of bribery in connection with bidding for the landscape improvements around the new courthouse. Postcard showing 1939 addition obscuring 1910 courthouse The 1910 courthouse also served as the seat of the County government; in 1939, the Public Works Administration completed an expansion to the existing courthouse, which removed the original facade; another contemporary addition which was completed in 1941 surrounded the original building with modern structures. The Hall of Justice and Records (HJR) was completed in 1956 for the County government and a tower was added to the Hall of Justice and Records in 1971. The original (1956) design is credited to UC Berkeley architecture professor Michael Goodman. Court operations moved to the HJR upon its completion, but some functions were returned to the 1910 courthouse in early 1964. The courts did not move back to the HJR completely until the 1990s, after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake damaged the historic 1910 courthouse. The 1910 courthouse survived the 1989 earthquake and currently houses the San Mateo County History Museum; it was acquired by the San Mateo County Historical Association in 1997. 1910 courthouse, as reconstructed after 2006 A civil grand jury recommended in 1999 the HJR structure be retrofitted and that hazardous original construction materials (asbestos and lead paint) be removed. The annex obscuring the front of the 1910 courthouse was torn down in 2005 and the original facade was restored. Courtroom A in the 1910 courthouse is still used for ceremonial purposes. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, jury selection proceedings were temporarily moved in September 2020 to the San Mateo County Event Center in the city of San Mateo to allow for social distancing. Locations The Court is divided into three branches in three cities, with each branch housed in a separate courthouse: * Southern Branch: Redwood City * Northern Branch: South San Francisco * Juvenile Branch: San Mateo Cases are divided geographically between the Northern and Southern districts, or by age (Juvenile). The Northern District has jurisdiction over matters from the county line south to (and including) Burlingame. Previously, the court was housed in five locations; in addition to the three listed above, the court included the Central Branch (located in the city of San Mateo) and the Southern Branch Annex (one block away from the Southern Branch). The Central Branch was closed in 2013 due to budget cuts, and the Annex, which was the countywide Traffic Court, was given to the County in 2019 and demolished to clear space for County Office Building #3 (COB3). The County will move some employees from the Hall of Justice to COB3 after its completion; the space vacated after the move to COB3 will be used for Traffic Court. Meanwhile, Traffic Court operations moved temporarily to the Northern Branch. Structure Judicial affairs are governed by the Presiding Judge, with authority delegated to an Assisting Presiding Judge if needed. The Presiding and Assistant Presiding Judges are elected to serve two-year terms by their peers. Non-judicial administration is performed by the Court Executive Officer, who also serves as the Jury Commissioner.

The museum was founded in 1988 and is located in the city's former power and water plant. The building was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 1990 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Museum The museum was founded in 1988, in response to a magazine article that named Dothan as one of the worst places in the United States to live. It hosts traveling exhibits, as well as its permanent collection of American contemporary and pop art, including works by Josef Albers, Jim Dine, Robert Indiana, and Frank Stella. Building History Dothan was settled in the 1830s and incorporated in 1885, but did not see much growth until the coming of the railroads in the 1890s. As the town grew quickly in the 1910s, a new power plant was needed, as the former one was no longer adequate. The new plant was built in 1912‚Äì13 and consisted of a powerhouse, garage and tool shed, cooling pond, coal yard, two pump houses, machine storage building, small tool shed, covered reservoir, substation, auxiliary reservoir, underground gasoline tank, two scales, a well, and two small office buildings. At the time, it was the only coal-fired power plant in the Wiregrass Region. The station contained two 3,000-Kw generators and a large water pump with a 1 million-gallon storage tank. The city used the plant as a promotional tool to attract new industry to the region, advertising cheap energy rates. By 1928, the plant had become expensive to operate and was shut down, with the city receiving electricity from Alabama Power's hydroelectric facilities. The city made improvements to the power plant and took over supply in 1933. Alabama Power began supplying some electricity to the city once more in 1942, and by 1949 had completely taken over supply. The generators and water pumps were removed, and the building was used as offices and storage by the city. See also: The Wiregrass Museum of Art moved into the building in the early 1990s. Architecture Of the original complex, only the powerhouse remains standing today. The powerhouse is divided into three sections: the two-story, flat-roofed front section was used as offices; the hip roofed middle section originally housed the generators; and the rear section, separated from the middle by a stepped brick firewall, was used for coal storage. The fa√ßade of the building is five bays wide, with a recessed entrance. The entrance is topped with a fanlight and decorative brick and granite arch. Windows on the fa√ßade were originally six-over-six sashes, but have since been replaced with single fixed panes. The building has a corbelled and denticulated parapet with a granite tablet inscribed with \\"Municipal Light & Water Plant - Built 1912‚Äì13\\".

Only two were built, using different engines. Design and development The Caudron C.220 basic trainer was a single bay biplane with two pairs of parallel interplane struts aided by wire bracing and two pairs of parallel cabane struts between the upper wing and the upper fuselage longerons. The wings were rectangular in plan and of similar chord though the upper span was about 3% greater. The wings were built from spruce and fabric covered. Ailerons were carried on the lower wing only. The C.220 was powered by a Salmson 7AC seven cylinder radial engine driving a metal, two blade propeller. One photograph shows the engine uncowled though the second aircraft, the C.221, which had a Lorraine 5P five cylinder radial and was otherwise identical apart from using a different make of propeller, was recorded both with and without a narrow chord Townend ring type cowling. Behind the engine the fuselage was a box girder structure covered in plywood, though the upper decking was rounded. The forward of the two open tandem cockpits was placed between the wings at about mid-chord with the rear seat behind the trailing edge. The C.220 had a triangular fin and an unbalanced rudder with straight, parallel side and rounded top and bottom. The horizontal tail was fixed to the upper fuselage longerons. There was a fixed, tail wheel undercarriage. The C.220 first flew in 1929. In July 1931 it was successfully presented at the military testing centre at Villacoublay, along with two other intermediate trainer candidates, both monoplanes, the successful Hanriot LH.10 and the Morane-Saulnier MS.311.

Note: Between 1781 and 1784, there were two French frigates Iris, this newly launched frigate, and the former USS Hancock, which the British had captured in 1781 in the American theatre and renamed Iris, and which the French had captured in 1781 and sold in 1784. The British captured the new Iris at Toulon on 28 August 1793, and burned her on their evacuation of the city in December. Fate When the Royalist French surrendered Toulon to Lord Hood in 1793, they found Iris dismantled and being used as a powder hulk. As the republicans advanced on the town, the Anglo-Spanish forces evacuated, destroying the arsenal and as many ships as they could of those that they could not sail out of the port. Captain Sidney Smith took charge of a small squadron of three English and three Spanish gunboats and went into the inner harbour to scuttle the ships. Against orders, instead of sinking one of the frigates, the Spanish crew of one gunboat set the frigate alight. The vessel, possibly Iris, was being used to store one thousand barrels of gunpowder. The resulting explosion blew the British gun boat Terrible, commanded by Lieutenant Patey, to pieces; however, the men were picked up alive.Gardner p.104 Another British gunboat, Union, which was nearest to Iris, too was blown to pieces; her commander, Mr Young, was killed, together with three of his men.von Pivka p.38 At least one other powder hulk, French frigate Montr√©al,Henry G.

The expression is often identified with the architectural movement of Expressionism, whose main starting point and aim is to present and express what has been \\"seen\\" or experienced in the inner eye of the mind, heart and soul, i.e. to express the subjective moods and feelings without referring to conventional and \\"objective\\" values, judgements and truths. Meaning The main problem in the critical analysis of the theoretical interpretations of the concept of expression in architecture, lies in the fact that the concept of expression is used in different ways in different fields of science and art. Regarding the concept of expression, the following interpretations can often be found: *an activity or way of transforming an idea into words; *showing emotions, feelings etc.;Robinson, J. (2007). Expression and expressiveness in art. Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics, 4 (2), 19-41. *conveying emotions by way of music, images etc.; *facial expression showing mood or emotion; *choice of words, phrases, syntax, intonation etc., in communication;To≈°oviƒá, B. (2004). Ekspresivnost. Stil, 3, 25-61. *a specific phrase commonly used to express something etc. In the widest sense, the concept of expression refers to the activity undertaken with a specific intention. However, what is the aim of expressing something will depend on the field in which the term is used.Alfirevic, Dj. (2011). Visual Expression in Architecture. Arhitektura i urbanizam, 31, 3-15. With this is mind, some authors emphasize the unconscious or spontaneous character of expression,Collingwood, R. G. The Principles of Art. New York: Oxford University Press, 1958.Wenninger, R. (2005). Individual Style after the End of Art. Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics, 2 (3), 105-115. while others emphasize its cognitive aspect.Dilworth, J. (2004). Artistic Expression and Interpretation. British Journal of Aesthetics, 44 (1), 10-28. Expression can also be defined as part of the communication process which consists of two complementary components, expression (transmitted information) and impression (received information).Argan ƒê.K., Oliva Akile B.

Background By 1969, Iraq's Jewish community had shrunk from more than 130,000 in 1948 to less than 3,000 due to mass emigration caused by the establishment of the State of Israel, the subsequent Arab-Israeli wars, and anti-Jewish persecution. The lopsided defeat suffered by the Arab states, including Iraq, against Israel in the June 1967 Six-Day War further increased discrimination against Iraq's remaining Jews: \\"They were dismissed from government jobs, their bank accounts were frozen and they were confined to house arrest, among other restrictions.\\" In July 1968, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party took control of Iraq in a bloodless coup. The new government was weak and was in constant fear that it would itself be the target of a coup. After the Israeli Air Force struck an Iraqi military position in northern Jordan on 4 December 1968 in retaliation for the shelling of Israeli communities in the Galilee, the Ba'athist regime began \\"hunting down an American-Israeli spy ring it said was trying to destabilize Iraq.\\" The authorities began arresting alleged conspirators shortly thereafter, including twelve Jewish men from Baghdad and Basra. The hangings Baghdad Radio invited citizens to Liberation Square on January 27 to \\"come and enjoy the feast\\", being brought in on buses. 500,000 people reportedly attended the hangings, and danced and celebrated before the corpses of the convicted spies. Nine of the fourteen hanged were Jews; the remaining three Jews of the initial twelve arrested were executed on 26 August 1969. The Jewish victims The nine Jewish victims were: { * Ezra Naji Zilkha, 60, of Basrah * Charles Raphael Horesh, 45, of Baghdad * Fouad Gabbay, 35, of Basrah * Yeheskel Gourji Namerdi, 32, of Basrah * Sabah Haim Dayan, 25, of Basrah  * Daaud Ghali, 21, of Basrah * Naim Khedouri Helali, 21, of Basrah * Heskel Saleh Heskel, 20, of Basrah * Daoud Heskel Barukh Dellal, 20, of Basrah } Aftermath The executions led to significant international criticism, with United States Secretary of State William P. Rogers condemning Iraq's actions as \\"repugnant to the conscience of the world\\" and Egypt's Al-Ahram cautioning: \\"The hanging of fourteen people in the public square is certainly not a heart-warming sight, nor is it the occasion for organizing a spectacle.\\" By contrast, the Soviet Union's official radio called the executions \\"fully justified,\\" while Charles de Gaulle of France said they could not be divorced from the broader Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Baghdad Radio rebutted Iraq's critics: \\"We hanged spies, but the Jews crucified Christ.\\" According to author Kanan Makiya, the negative publicity \\"has less to do with the activities of a Zionist lobby as the Ba'ath claimed, as much as it was the outcome of the deliberately public nature of the proceedings. Later the Ba'ath learnt the art of sealing out the outside world.\\" The persecution of Iraq's Jews continued after the spy trials: \\"By the time of the August executions, 51 Jews had been killed by the regime in 1969 alone; 100 more were imprisoned or tortured.\\" In the early 1970s, nearly all of Iraq's Jewish population left after being permitted to leave. Only a small number stayed behind, largely those who were too old to travel. Makiya credits the hangings with helping the Ba'athist government consolidate control of Iraq, stating: \\"The terror that, from a Ba'athist viewpoint, was premature and badly handled in 1963, worked and was skillfully deployed the second time around.\\" References Category:Jewish Iraqi history Category:1969 in Iraq Category:Public executions Category:Antisemitism in Iraq Category:Jews and Judaism in Baghdad Category:Iraq‚ÄìIsrael relations Category:People executed by Iraq by hanging Category:20th-century executions by Iraq Category:People convicted of spying for Israel ","title":"1969 Baghdad hangings"},{"id":"46198586","text":"Ana Janer was one of the first two women from Puerto Rico to earn a medical degree.Women's Military Memorial \\"LA MUJER EN LAS PROFESIONES DE SALUD (1898-1930); By: YAMILA AZIZE VARGAS1 and LUIS ALBERTO AVILES; PRHSJ Vol, 9 No. 1 Janer and Mar√≠a Elisa Rivera D√≠az graduated in the same medical school class in 1909, and thus can both be considered the first female Puerto Rican physician.http://prhsj.rcm.upr.edu/index.php/prhsj/article/viewFile/715/558 They both started their practice that same year.

History The team finished with a record of 71-59 in its debut season in 1905, behind the Fort Worth Panthers by just a half game for second place in the league. After Temple got off to a slow start in the following season and Temple manager Con Lucid resigned, owner J.E.

With the Texas League struggling financially, it decided in mid-season to drop the Boll Weevils. The Temple Baseball Association, having only recently spent $3,000 to buy the team, filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the league. In 1907 the Texas League took on several teams from the South Texas League and resurrected another incarnation of the Boll Weevils with players being contributed by the other teams.

Current operations Ireland HMV stores in Ireland were part of the same expansion that expanded into Canada. Starting in the 2000s, all physical locations gradually closed down. HMV Ireland is now an online store only. Japan In July 2007, HMV Japan, which operates 62 shops, was sold to DSM Investment Catorce. The stores and HMV Japan website continue to trade as HMV, but is no longer owned by HMV Group. Since JVC Kenwood Holdings (through its JVC and Victor Entertainment subsidiaries) controls the His Master's Voice trademark in Japan, HMV Japan used a stylised gramophone of its own design as its trademark. As with the former U.S. and Canadian operations, HMV Japan's use of the initials \\"HMV\\" has never been challenged.

In 1994, the first HMV store was opened in the shopping centre Windsor House on 311, Gloucester Road, Hong Kong. HMV began opening stores in new shopping malls. The Tsim Sha Tsui flagship store, spanning 4 storeys at the corner of Peking Road and Hankow Road, was the largest record store in the territory until 2006, when it was re-located to another smaller location on Hankow Road. During the 2000s, HMV Hong Kong formed a partnership with Commercial Radio Hong Kong; one of their channels was renamed HMV864 and all HMV stores in Hong Kong tuned into that channel. The prices on their products especially those without promotion and discount are often higher than many independent record stores. HMV Hong Kong was the second place after the UK to launch in-store digital kiosks, and the first in Asia. HMV Hong Kong formerly used the same stylised gramophone logo as HMV Japan, but has since switched to the Nipper the Dog logo that HMV UK uses, but without the gramophone. At present there are four stores, plus a HMV-themed restaurant. HMV was the second international music store established in Singapore, after Tower Records, which later closed down. It operates one store in Singapore, at Marina Square. The former store at 313@Somerset (which replaced one formerly in The Heeren) closed in November 2013, after closing the other at the CityLink underground mall. It is generally higher priced than other independent shops, and local chains such as Gramophone and That CD Shop offer lower prices. HMV is the only store that sells games, T-shirts, books and audio gear in addition to music and video. Deloitte announced on 28 February 2013 that Hong Kong-based private equity firm AID Partners Capital Holdings had bought the businesses in Hong Kong and Singapore. In addition, the firm acquired the rights to the HMV brand in China, Macau and Taiwan. In December 2018, HMV announced that it would close all its Hong Kong locations. Defunct operations Australia In 1989 the HMV Group established its first Australian store in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta, closely followed by a second store in Chatswood in that same year. In 1990, HMV opened its flagship store in the Sydney central business district. The 1,207-square-meter superstore in Pitt Street Mall was the largest music store in the Southern Hemisphere and sold more CDs than any other store in the country. It was also awarded the ARIA Charts store of the Year on 3 occasions. By 1998, a further 27 stores were opened in key retail centres on the eastern seaboard of Australia, including other large footprint stores at Melbourne's Bourke Street Mall and Brisbane's 585-square-meter Queen Street Mall store. In March 2000, HMV made local headlines when their larger rival, Sanity, signed a five-year deal with Festival Mushroom Records for a three-year online exclusivity window on all tracks downloaded from that label at Sanity's website. Sanity's competitors and other online services were meant to be blocked from Festival Mushroom's catalogue for that period unless Sanity agreed to deal with them. Chaos.com and Leading Edge Music both made public threats to boycott Festival Mushroom's content, but HMV Australia (whose website did not offer downloading) followed through, removing all CDs from their domestic stores, adding they would do the same overseas. By the next week, Festival Mushroom backed down, stating Sanity would simply be the wholesaler of their digital downloads for the next three years, requiring them to make all products available to other retailers at the time of release. In October 2005, Sanity's owner, Brazin Limited acquired the Australian operations of HMV for A$4 million (¬£1.7 million). The HMV Group's agreement with Brazin was to phase out the HMV brand in Australia by 2010. Immediately after this acquisition of HMV's 32 outlets, this put Brazin at its peak with its 74 Virgin Megastore and Virgin At Myer stores, in addition to Sanity's 215, and EzyDVD's 63 outlets around the country (not counting non-entertainment retail chains within Brazin, such as Bras 'N' Things) and was by far Australia's largest entertainment retailer with close to 43% of the music retail market. However, most HMV stores in Australia had very high overhead costs due to their large footprints and expensive locations, thus most were gradually closed upon the end of rental leases. The remaining stores were re-branded to Sanity over the next five years. The horizontal merger was approved by the ACCC that same month leaving Brazin to merge marketing and general operations within the one entertainment division. Also in October, Brazin officially launched its Pulse loyalty card after a year of testing in the market. It worked by giving the customer one point for every dollar spent across Brazin's store network, receiving a $5 discount voucher or other offers once 100 points were reached. By December 2006, HMV had already shrunk to 22 outlets from its peak of 32 the year before. HMV's Australian flagship store in Pitt Street Mall was shut down on Friday 31 August 2007, when the Mid City Centre shopping centre it was located in was closed for renovation, and the large Bourke Street Mall store closed on Tuesday 19 February 2008. By mid-2010 the last HMV store was closed in Brisbane by Sanity Entertainment (formerly Brazin Limited), and the last re-branded HMV store trading as Sanity closed at Indooroopilly Shopping Centre in December 2012. Canada An HMV store in Toronto HMV established a subsidiary in Canada in 1988 following the purchase of Mister Sound by EMI Music Canada. In June 2011, HMV sold the business for ¬£2 million to Hilco. As of 2012, HMV Canada had 113 stores. It remained a separate business to HMV in the UK, despite both companies being owned by Hilco. In January 2017 HMV Canada announced the closure of its last 102 stores, with a confirmed date of April 30 that year.HMV Canada to close all 102 stores Hollie Shaw, Financial Post, January 27, 2017 USA HMV stores in the U.S. did not have rights to the His Master's Voice trademark; in those countries, that trademark is part of the RCA trademark portfolio owned by Technicolor SA and licensed to others. HMV was not prevented from using its initials in the U.S. HMV had a handful of stores in the Eastern United States, which in their final years were overseen by HMV's Canadian operations. In the 1990s they had a significant presence in Manhattan. Poor real estate decisions made in the early 1990s rendered the United States stores uneconomical and HMV gradually extricated itself from leases, and the final store in the United States, having lost ¬£500,000 in 2003 and ¬£1 million in 2004, closed on 3 November 2004. India The first overseas branch of EMI was established in India in 1901. An important milestone was reached a year later, when it made the first audio recording in the subcontinent, of singer Gauhar Jan in 1902. However, fortunes for the fledgling offshoot increased dramatically when the Indian cinema talkies exploded in popularity in 1931. This led to a surge in demand for film-based songs and soundtracks, and the company rapidly expanded production to cater to this new and growing market. Indeed, this music genre continued to grow year- on-year, and accounted for a sizeable share of its output for the life of the organisation. The Gramophone Company of India was incorporated in 1946, and, in addition to fulfilling the needs of the home market, soon began exporting popular and culturally significant recordings around the globe - particularly to areas with large Indian expat populations. The company existed until 1985, when it was taken over by the RPG Group. On 2 November 2000, the company changed its name to Saregama India Ltd. Saregama controls a large repertoire of Indian film and non-film music, spanning a century.About us Saregama. Italy The Italian emanation of the HMV record label was La voce del padrone (Italian for \\"His masters voice\\"). From 1904, Gramophone Company records were published and distributed in Italy by Saif (Societ√† Anonima Italiana di Fonotopia), a company based in Milan. When the Gramophone Company merged with Columbia in 1931 to form EMI, Saif in turn merged with Columbia's Italian arm, SNG (Societ√† Nazionale del Grammofono).

Starring G√©rard Depardieu and Elizabeth Hurley, the film premiered 2 September 2014, in Moscow and debuted in New York City on 24 October 2014. The project was filmed entirely in Russia and, being set in Moscow, it was filmed in locations in both Moscow and the Chechen capital of Grozny. Production London-based production company Saradan Media announced 15 May 2013, that Liz Hurley and G√©rard Depardieu were about to begin filming an action film project in Russia under a working title of Turquoise and directed by Philippe Martinez. On 22 May Saradan Media revealed that \\"Tourquoise\\" and Viktor were the same project. Filming began in Grozny on Saturday 18 May 2013, with expectations that the film would be released in late 2013. The film actually released in Russia in September 2014. Synopsis The plot revolves around the story of a former gangster Victor Lambert (G√©rard Depardieu), a professional thief specializing in the theft of works of art. After serving prison time in France for an art heist, he returns to his Russian home to investigate the circumstances surrounding the brutal murder of his son Jeremy (Jean Baptiste Fillon) three months earlier. He enlists the assistance of his former accomplice Alexandra Ivanov (Elizabeth Hurley).

The film was very not well received in France, and generally considered a flop in its US release, with many US sources describing Depardieu's girth as making him unbelievable as an action hero. The Detroit News wrote \\"In his younger days, Depardieu had a burly charm, but the dude is 65 now and has to weigh 300 pounds. He looks ludicrous in action sequences\\". The Hollywood Reporter wrote \\"Depardieu, age 65 and looking like he can barely move due to his massive girth...\\" continuing \\"the film is relentlessly tedious when it's not being laughable\\", sharing that the \\"latter aspect is exemplified by the supposed romantic relationship between the morbidly obese Depardieu and the gorgeous Hurley, whose adoring gazes toward her co-star demonstrate that her acting abilities have perhaps been underestimated\\". San Francisco Weekly wrote \\"The 66-year-old Depardieu was no action hero even in his prime, and as his girth now rivals Paul Masson-era Orson Welles, we're meant to believe he strikes fear into his enemies\\". Film Journal International writes of the film's weak points, stating \\"...sadly, the problem is Depardieu, who lumbers through the film looking as though he's tormented by indigestion rather than a lust for vengeance\\", and toward the film, \\"Viktor is surprisingly dull\\". They did, however, speak well toward the film's cinematography, expressing pleasure at the director's \\"delivering the genre staples - car chases, gun battles, a little torture (a reluctant informer), female flesh and endless dark alleys and mean streets - and Moscow is wall-to-wall with photo ops, from the winding Neva River to the Cathedral of St. Basil, which has made so many movie appearances it should be getting above-the-title billing\\". And The Los Angeles Times wrote that seeing \\"the film's corpulent, 65-year-old star, G√©rard Depardieu, play a brash killing machine who beds the likes of the gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley is truly like entering some cinematic Bizarro world. Think Charles Durning as Dirty Harry\\". The reviewer wrote the film was a \\"hackneyed jumble ... a fiery car chase, a couple of shootouts and an eyes-averting torture scene fill this competently shot movie's action quota. But a tone- switching epilogue proves hokey ‚Äî and a little spooky\\". CBS News noted that while film was \\"beautifully shot\\" and director of photography Jean-Francois Hensgens brought out \\"the stunning Russian landscape\\"; however, the film's beauty was \\"brought down by the clunky dialogue and the slow, plodding plot\\".

Personal life and education  Seppelt was born in Berlin, and is the son of Alfred Seppelt, who was the head of the Berlin Chess Federation from 1984 to 2004. In 1981, he obtained his college preparatory degree (Abitur) at the Beethoven High School (Berlin) in Berlin's Lankwitz neighborhood. He studied sports, social studies, journalism and French at the Free University of Berlin for a few semesters but did not complete a degree.  Career  Since 1985, Seppelt has worked as a sports reporter for Germany's premier public broadcaster ARD. He has also worked for the Berlin public broadcaster Sender Freies Berlin and its 2003 successor Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg. After working for many years as a live commentary for swimming events for ARD, he was stripped of this duty in the early summer of 2006. Seppelt said that this was in reaction to a private email, in which he criticized ARD's uncritical reporting on doping, becoming public. Since 2006, he has worked as a freelance journalist for ARD and has made a number of reports and documentary films about doping.  Doping in Germany  Together with former Canadian swimmer Karin Helmstaedt, Seppelt made the documentary film Staatsgeheimnis Kinderdoping (State Secret Child Doping) about the perpetrators and victims of doping in East German swimming. It was broadcast by ARD. Together with Holger Sch√ºck, he published the book Anklage: Kinderdoping. Das Erbe des DDR-Sports (Indictment Doping: The Legacy of East German Sports) in 1999. It also dealt with the topic of state doping in Communist East Germany. In 2006, Seppelt reported extensively about the doping problem in cycling. Among other things, his research led to the identification of the German physician Markus China as a member of the doping network organized by Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes.RBB Online, Nach ARD- Informationen Deutscher Komplize des spanischen Dopingnetzwerkes identifiziert In November of that year, he was awarded the Leuchtturm f√ºr besondere publizistische Leistungen (Lighthouse Prize for Special Journalist Achievement) by the journalists‚Äô association Netzwerk Recherche for his research, reports and exclusive revelations about cyclists Jan Ullrich and Floyd Landis and Eufemiano Fuentes.RBB Online, Journalistenpreis f√ºr RBB-Sport reporter Hajo Seppelt In the documentary ‚ÄúMission: Clean Sport‚Äú Hajo Seppelt and Jo Goll documented the work of German doping control officers. The film highlighted flaws in Germany's doping-control system and caused heady public discussions, which contributed to structural changes in Germany's National Anti Doping Agency (NADA). The report won the Silver Chest Award 2007 at the International Television Film Festival in Plovdiv and the international Sports Movie and TV Award 2007 in Milan.inside-digital.de, The film was also nominated for the German Television Prize and the Prix Europa. In mid-January the German Skiing Association (DSV) took legal action, and a Hamburg court issued an injunction against Seppelt for refusing to make a cease-and-desist declaration demanded by the DSV about suspicions that German cross-country skiers and biathletes had engaged in blood doping in a Vienna laboratory.FOCUS Online, Deutsche in Wiener Blutbank (16 January 2008) A superior court in Hamburg overturned that ruling in Seppelt's favor, concluding that DSV had no right to demand the cease-and-desist declaration because it was not affected by the journalist's reporting. The ruling was based constitutional guarantees of journalist freedom in cases of anonymous sources. The judgement also overturned an injunction from October 21, 2008.taz, Das Klima ist rauer (1. Dezember 2008) Seppelt's suspicion could not be proved after extensive investigations. In January 2012 Seppelt and colleagues from the Western German public broadcaster WDR had reports featured on ARD and WDR sports programs about the blood of thirty athletes being exposed to ultra-violet radiation by a sports doctor in the Eastern German city of Erfurt. Several of the athletes concerned were named. In the wake of the broadcasts, a discussion arose as to whether such procedures were banned according to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) code. WADA itself considered them to be.Hajo Seppelt: Interview mit NADA-Generaldirektor David Howman ‚Äì Erneuter Kurswechsel der WADA im Fall Erfurt? , in: Sportschau.de, 4. Juni 2012. Anti-doping investigations of the athletes ended up with discontinuations and acquittals due to extenuating circumstances, and a criminal investigation of the doctor concerned was also discontinued. Nonetheless, many experts declared that blood treatments were banned in principle by the laws governing sports. The doctor tried to get a superior court in Cologne to issue an injunction against WDR,sid: Erfurter Arzt erwirkt einstweilige Verf√ºgung, in Focus.de, 1. M√§rz 2012. but the broadcaster won out, and the report was allowed to contain references to ‚Äúforbidden blood treatments.‚Äùsid: Erfurter Doping-Aff√§re: WDR siegt vor OLG, in: Focus.de, 27. November 2012.  Doping in China  Parallel with the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, ARD broadcast the 45-minute-documentary Olympia im Reich der Mittel: Doping in China (Flying High in the Middle Kingdom: Doping in China), which Seppelt made with Jo Goll. The film reported about doping and doping controls in China, in particularly above proven case of stem-cell manipulation carried out on top athletes.DOKfilm, Olympia im Reich der Mittel At the International New York Film Festival, it won a world gold medal for long-form reporting. It was also awarded the main prize at 2009 Sportfilm Liberec 2007 - World Facts Challenge festival.NDR, Auszeichnung Sportfilm Liberec 2009  Doping in Kenya  In the spring and summer of 2012, Seppelt and Kempe reported for the first time about doping among Kenyan track-and-field athletes. The focus was primarily on practices among doctors in the background. One athlete told of widespread doping among Kenyan long- distance runners.Topl√§ufer aus Kenia gesteht in der ARD Doping, in: ARD.de, 6. August 2012.Kenianer Kisorio nennt weitere Doping-Details, in: ARD.de, 8. August 2012. The reports caused intense reactions in Kenya and met with considerable international resonance. As a result, doping controls were stepped up in the country. The documentary Doping - Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics shows that it is relatively easy to obtain banned performance-enhancing drugs in Kenya. It traces the story of an impoverished young runner who seems to have died from the side effects of taking EPO. Kenyan athletics authorities refused to speak with Seppelt about the issue, and his film presents circumstantial evidence of corruption among Kenyan sports functionaries. Former Boston marathon winner Rito Jeptoo asserts that Kenyan athletes are not subjected to blood tests while training. Another Kenyan runner claims that the national federation suppresses positive doping results in return for bribes. Seppelt also suggests the International Association of Athletics Federations isn't doing enough to address the problem of doping in endurance disciplines. After evaluating data on athletes' blood collected at major athletics competitions over a number of years, two Australian scientists conclude that doping is the only plausible explanation for some of the measurements. The IAAF also refused to speak with Seppelt about his suspicions. In August 2015, he presented a nearly hour-long report questioning athletics in general and Kenya's long-distance runners in particular. Shortly before the IAAF World Championships in London, German broadcaster ARD aired a new episode of Doping Top Secret in August 2017, titled \\"The Big Money Run. Africa's Athletes on Sale.\\" The feature by Hajo Seppelt, Benjamin Best, Ulrike Unfug, and Grit Hartmann particularly examines people surrounding and influencing African Athletes in track and field disciplines. It focuses not only on doping, but also delves into shady practices of managers and into the numerous changes of nationality that occur in this core Olympic sport.  Doping in Russia  In December 2014 ARD broadcast Seppelt's film Geheimsache Doping: Wie Russland seine Sieger macht (The Doping Secret: How Russia Makes its Winners), made with the help of Russi athletes who told their stories in front of the camera. In this 60-minute documentary, whistleblowers testified to systematic doping in athletics and other sports in Russia. The film presents evidence for these allegations in form of footage and audio recordings secretly made by the whistleblowers as well as official documents. The documentary attracted global media attention and was broadcast worldwide in a number of languages. After its broadcast in Germany, several figures in international sports organizations and anti-doping institutions either resigned their posts or were suspended. http://hajoseppelt.de/2014/12/the-secrets-of-doping-how-russia-makes-its- winners/ In March 2016, in its Sport Inside program, the WDR broadcast another film on doping in athletics with a focus on Russia: ‚ÄúGeheimsache Doping: Russlands T√§uschungsman√∂ver‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Doping Secret: Russia‚Äôs Red Herrings‚Äù). In it, Hajo Seppelt, together with co-author Florian Riesewieck, showed how Russian coaches and officials avoided conditions of the World Athletics Federation IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA. The 30-minute documentary once again received extensive international attention and was broadcast in several countries. http://hajoseppelt.de/2016/03/doping-secret- russias-red-herrings/ In November 2016 the documentary \\"Doping - Top secret: The protection racket\\" (by Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck, Olga Sviridenko and Felix Becker) was aired in ARD's weekly programme \\"Sportschau\\". It is based on a joint investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde and the ARD doping editorial team. The documentary is about criminal activities linked to doping and cover up in international athletics. http://www.ardmediathek.de/tv/Sportschau/Doping-Top-Secret-The-Protection- Rack/Das-Erste/Video?bcastId=53524&documentId;=39197456 http://www.playthegame.org/news/news-articles/2016/0251_new-claims-further- involve-iaaf-top-in-russian-doping-coverups/ In May 2018 ARD announced that Russia had declared void a visa issued to Seppelt so he could report on the 2018 FIFA World Cup, citing Russia stating that Seppelt is on a list of unwanted persons. In May 2018 Hajo Seppelt and Florian Riesewieck produced another episode of the documentary series \\"Doping Top Secret\\" on ARD ‚Äì titled \\"Russia‚Äòs Football Friends\\". This time they focused on suspicious facts in football in Russia, host country of the World Cup.  Doping in Weightlifting  On 5 January 2020, Seppelt released a documentary on ARD titled 'Secret Doping - the Lord of the Lifters'. In the documentary, Seppelt uncovers that weightlifters as young as 13 in Thailand are encouraged to take performance enhancing drugs. In a secret recording, Seppelt also captures footage of Olympic bronze medalist Siripuch Gulnoi admitting to taking performance enhancing drugs before winning bronze at the 2012 Olympics. Other secret footage also captures a doctor with the Moldovan weightlifting team claiming that they used doppelgangers to give urine samples for athletes in exchange for payments. The documentary also made claims of corruption against the IWF and its president, Tam√°s Aj√°n, resulting in him stepping aside from the role pending an investigation and resigning as an IOC honorary member.https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-statement-on-tamas-ajan He eventually resigned from his position as president permanently on 15 April. The president and entire executive board of the Thai Amateur Weightlifting Association (TAWA) also resigned from their positions. The new acting president of the IWF appointed Richard McLaren, the Canadian lawyer whose investigative work did so much to expose state-sponsored doping in Russia, to lead the investigation into corruption and doping in weightlifting.  Other reports  Prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, ARD broadcast the 45-minute-documentary ‚ÄúFlying High in the Middle Kingdom: Doping in China‚Äù, which Hajo Seppelt produced with Jo Goll. The film reported about doping and doping controls in China, in particular, about proven cases of stem-cell manipulation carried out on top athletes. At the International New York Film Festival, it won a world gold medal for long-form reporting. It was also awarded the main prize at the 2009 Sportfilm Liberec 2007 ‚Äì World Facts Challenge Festival. Prior to the 2009 World Athletics Championships in Berlin, ARD broadcast the documentary ‚ÄúDoping Top Secret: The String-Pullers in Athletics‚Äú by Hajo Seppelt and Robert Kempe about the people who pull the strings in doping in track-and- field.ARD, Prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, ARD broadcast the 30-minute feature ‚ÄúGeheimsache Doping Eiskalter Betrug‚Äù (‚ÄúDoping Top Secret: ‚ÄûIce-Cold Cheating‚Äù). In it, Hajo Seppelt, Robert Kempe and Jochen Leufgens took a look behind the scenes at winter sports.ARD, In the wake of research by Seppelt in September 2010 about the world's top cyclist Alberto Contador, the Union Cycliste Internationale had to admit that the Spanish Tour de France winner had turned up positive in doping tests. It emerged that the UCI had wanted to keep secrets a positive test by Contador for the substance Clenbuterol at the Tour de France in July 2010.Tagesschau, In February 2012, Contador was retroactively banned for two years, from August 2010 to August 2012, by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for Clenbuterol use.sportschau In May 2011, Seppelt and co-filmmaker Kempe had the chance to film footage about sports for a week in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. The result was the documentary film Sport in Nordkorea - Einblicke in eine unbekannte Welt (Sports in North Korea ‚Äì A Look at an Unknown World), which was broadcast by ARD in July 2011. In 2013, Seppelt and Kempe completed a critical documentary about Thomas Bach, shortly before he was elected president of the International Olympic Committee. In January 2017 Germany's ARD television aired another part of its ‚ÄúDoping Top Secret‚Äù series. The new episode focussed on Russian whistleblower Andrey Dmitriev. Frustrated with the persistence of doping in his home country's athletics community, the runner made secret video recordings. The footage enabled him to prove that a big-name coach suspended due to doping links is still working with athletes. In April 2017, Hajo Seppelt and his colleague Thilo Neumann revealed the existence of positive doping tests for Clenbuterol in the context of follow-up checks during the 2008 Olympic Games in Peking. The journalists also uncovered that the IOC kept these results a secret in consultation with WADA. Research showed that the IOC did not follow up on these cases, even though the organization's regulations demand further investigation in case of positive doping tests. Among the athletes who were tested positive, there was at least one Jamaican sprinter. The IOC's declaration, stating that the positive tests were a result of the athletes‚Äô consumption of meat from China which supposedly contained Clenbuterol and that therefore there where no investigations concerning other possible causes, engendered worldwide criticism. In June 2017 the German Broadcaster a new Episode of \\"Doping Top Secret\\", titled \\"Brazil‚Äôs dirty game\\", was aired by ARD. The documentary by Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck und Thilo Neumann examined the topic of doping in the host country of the last Football World Championships and of the last Olympic Games. Massive failings and shortcomings of Brazil's doping prevention plans where substantiated. Additionally, a multitude of indications for a culture of doping, deeply rooted in Brazil Football and stretching up to the national elite could be found. In June 2018 on occasion of the Football World Cup in Russia ARD German TV aired a documentary titled \\"Doping Top secret: Brazil‚Äôs Twelfth man\\" (Authors: Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck, Edmund Willison) about doping in Brazilian football.Geheimsache Doping: Brasiliens zw√∂lfter Mann, ARD, July 1, 2018Geheimsache Doping - Profifu√üballer besuchen dubiosen brasilianischen Mediziner, Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck, Edmund Willison und Sebastian M√ºnster, ARD, July 1, 2018Doping: German journalists expose doctor linked to Brazilian football stars, Alexander Pearson, Deutsche Welle, July 2, 2018‚ÄûHormone sind das Elixier des Lebens‚Äú, Jessica Sturmberg, Deutschlandfunk, July 1, 2018 (in German)Bericht √ºber Doping in Brasilien, Sport1, July 1, 2018 (in German)Berichte √ºber angebliches Doping-Netzwerk in Brasiliens Fu√üball, Spiegel Online, July 2, 2018 (in German)Dopingskandal skakar Brasilien mitt under VM Fotbolls-VM 2018, Expressen, July 2, 2018 (in Swedish)  Awards  *2018 German Sports Journalist of the Year *2018 Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany *2018 Gold World Medal at the New York Film Festivals in the category ‚ÄûCurrent affairs‚Äú for ‚ÄúDoping Top secret: The Big Money Run ‚Äì Africa‚Äòs Athletes on Sale‚Äù (Co- Authors: Ulrike Unfug, Benjamin Best and Grit Hartmann) *2017 ‚ÄûPlay the Game‚Äú Award (together with the whistleblowers Vitalyi Stepanov and Yuliya Stepanova) *2017 ‚ÄûMention D‚ÄôHonneur‚Äú in the category ‚ÄúSport & Society‚Äù for the documentary film ‚ÄúDoping ‚Äì Top Secret: The Big Money Run ‚Äì Africa‚Äôs Athletes On Sale‚Äù at the international film festival of Federation Internationale Cinema Television Sportifs in Milano *2017 Main Prize at International Festival Sportfilm Liberec ‚Äì International FICTS Festival for the Documentaries ‚ÄúShowdown for Russia‚Äù and ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs Red Herrings‚Äù (Co-Authors: Florian Riesewieck, Olga Sviridenko and Felix Becker) *2017 Tagesthemen Award for the reporting on doping in Russia *2017 Gold World Medal at the New York Film Festivals in the category ‚ÄúCurrent affairs‚Äù for ‚ÄúDoping Top secret: Showdown for Russia‚Äù (in cooperation with Florian Riesewieck, Felix Becker and Olga Sviridenko) *2017 Nomination of the WDR program sport inside for the 53rd Adolf Grimme Prize (member of the team of authors) *2016 Winner of the Open Russia Award f√ºr independent news journalism and investigative research on Russian topics *2016 International Sports Movies TV Award in the category ‚ÄúSport & Society‚Äù for the documentary film ‚ÄúDoping ‚Äì Top Secret: Russia‚Äôs Red Herrings‚Äù at the international film festival of Federation Internationale Cinema Television Sportifs in Milano *2016 Nomination Tagesthemen Award (sports category) for the story ‚ÄúARD requests unwelcome: IAAF President Coe‚Äôs poor start‚Äù *2016 Laureate of the Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Award for TV journalism *2016 Nomination of ‚ÄúDoping ‚Äì Top Secret: Showdown for Russia‚Äù for PRIX EUROPA 2016 (category TV Current Affairs) *2016 Nomination for the Austrian Film and Television Award Goldene ROMY for ‚ÄúDoping ‚Äì Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics‚Äù in the category ‚ÄúBest TV Documentary‚Äù *2016 Finalist at the New York Film Festivals in the category ‚ÄúBest Investigative Report‚Äù for ‚ÄúDoping ‚Äì Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics‚Äù *2016 Bud- Greenspan-Award der New York Track and Field Writers for the documentaries ‚ÄúDoping ‚Äì Top Secret: How Russia makes its winners‚Äù and ‚ÄúDoping ‚Äì Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics‚Äù *2016 German Television Prize in the category Best Sports Program for ‚ÄúDoping ‚Äì Top Secret: How Russia makes its winners‚Äù and ‚ÄúDoping ‚Äì Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics‚Äù *2015 Awards at the first global competition for sports journalism, the ‚ÄúSports Media Pearl Award‚Äù (by AIPS) in Abu Dhabi: first price in the category Video documentary for ‚ÄúDoping ‚Äì Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics‚Äù and special price in the category ‚ÄúBest investigative reporting‚Äù *2015 Award of the Berlin-Brandenburg Journalists Association: ‚ÄúLanger Atem‚Äù ‚Äì for dedication and perseverance in journalistic research.

The individuals who express this phenomenon are unaware that they are recognizing the faces of people they have seen before. Joachim Bodamer created the term prosopagnosia in 1947. Individuals with this disorder do not have the ability to overtly recognize faces, but discoveries have been made showing that people with this disorder have the ability to covertly recognize faces. There are two types of prosopagnosia, congenital and acquired. Congenital prosopagnosia is an inability to recognize faces without a history of brain damage; while acquired prosopagnosia is caused by damage to the right occipital-temporal region of the brain. In the 1950s it was theorized that the right cerebral hemisphere was involved in facial recognition and in the 1960s this theory was supported by many experiments. Although the ability for overt facial recognition is inhibited in patients with prosopagnosia, there have been many studies done which show that some of these individuals may have the ability to recognize familiar faces covertly. These experiments have used behavioral and physiological measures in order to demonstrate covert facial recognition. A common physiological measure that is used is the measure of autonomic activity by using skin-conductance responses (SCR) which show a larger response in individuals with prosopagnosia who are shown pictures of familiar faces compared to pictures of unfamiliar faces. Theories and reasoning Many theories reside in the topic of cognitive facial recognition. First, the theory of contradiction between prosopagnosia and covert recognition. Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces but is believed to stem from damage to the ventral route of the visual system. Whereas covert recognition is shown in people that lost their ability to recognize faces, implying an intact ventral limbic structure projecting to the amygdala. Theory two states that it cannot be observed in developmental cases of prosopagnosia, which was proposed by Grueter. Developmental prosopagnosia is a severe face processing impairment without brain damage and visual or thinking dysfunction but can sometimes run in families (some indications that there may be a genetic reason for the disorder). This theory is thought to rely on the activation of face representations created during the time of normal processing. Contradicting the last theory, the affective valence in developmental prosopagnosia theory states that individuals may be processing faces on affective dimensions, feelings and emotions, rather than familiarity dimensions, previous occasions and when they met. Next is the dual-route models theory, proposed by Bauer, and states covert recognition can be seen in people that endured a time of normal face processing before actually getting the condition. With this, there are two different types of covert recognition: behavioral and physiological. Behavioral covert recognition is measured by reaction time and occurs within a cognitive pathway consisting of face recognition units (FRUs), personality identity units (PINs) and semantic information units. Physiological covert recognition is measured by SCR and is the second route that mediates reactions to familiar faces. This theory can be explained by the disconnection of FRUs or that it may be that the face recognition system is intact but has been disconnected from a higher system enabling their conscious awareness. The parallel distributing process is a theory that proposes it would be easier to relearn previous known faces rather than to learn new ones. This process has three steps: the distributed information is represented, memory and knowledge for some things are not stored explicitly but are connected between nodes, learning can occur with gradual changes to the connections. Damaged networks are less effective by zeroing the weight of the connection. Each connection is embedded and is still faintly there, making it easier to relearn. Other theories include one proposed by Bauer, states that neurological routes mediate overt recognition. His theory went with Bruce and Young‚Äôs theory that when using these three sequential stages in order, each stage will affect the next with overt mediation. The three stages are familiarity, occupation and name retrieval. Experiments One of the first studies into the diversion of pathways of overt and covert facial processing was done by Bauer in 1984. This study has been the basis for most of the other studies and literature that has been conducted on the topic of prosopagnosia and covert processing. Three other larger studies were performed. Event-related potential studies were done with 20 subjects who were clear of psychological disorders. This was a face study using 315 faces and a string of characters. In each trial 30 of the faces were familiar and 90 novel faces were shown. Then, the 315 faces were shown and subjects were asked which were familiar. The faces were shown again from the first trial but without a string of letters. This resulted in higher load results for overt recognition with longer reaction time. High load tasks led to the ability to recall far fewer faces when the task was performed. The second study was directly into covert facial recognition in prosopagnosia. In this study faces were taken from a set of 166 faces, hair and background were removed. In the first task, 36 pictures were shown, half actors and have politicians. When the face was shown the subject was asked if it was a politician or actor. Both the control and prosopagnosia patients were able to identify which faces were which therefore reaction time was compared. The second task was to say which of the faces were famous in a set of forty famous and forty non-famous. Prosopagnosia subjects had little ability to make this distinction. Further, the third task also showed forty famous faces but instead of a random string written names were used. The faces remained until one was decided upon to match the name. The covert recognition was only present in two tasks. This was not on the first task which was meant to prime and lead to the fact that the prime may be the impairment of prosopagnosia. SCR tests are often used to test covert facial processing but none of the experiments displayed significant results Facial recognition in disorders There are several problems that may damage the ability to properly perceive faces, many of these don‚Äôt have effects on both the covert and overt recognition of faces. Many of these problems only have an effect on the overt recognition of faces and leave the covert recognition intact. Prosopagnosia is a disorder which causes the inability to use overt facial recognition. While people suffering from prosopagnosia often cannot identify whose face they are looking at they usually show signs of covert recognition. This can be seen in their ability to accurately guess information during forced choice tasks. Patients who are unable to identify faces of people that they know are still able to accurately guess information on the owners of the faces such as their professions and names. When asked how confident of their answers the patients were, they would often give low ratings of confidence despite their high accuracy during the tests. This shows that they are unable to overtly recognize the face but they are still able to recall information on the owners despite the fact that they can‚Äôt identify the owner. While prosopagnosia patients are unable to overtly recognize faces, patients with Capgras delusion are unable to covertly recognize faces. People suffering from Capgras delusion are able to properly identify a face, but lack the covert recognition that is normally evoked by a familiar face. Before the delusion set in patients would normally have a sensation of familiarity and have a heightened response to faces that they recognize. Once the delusion has set in the patients no longer feel that the face they are looking at is familiar to them and they can‚Äôt access the feelings they normally held for the owner of the face despite the fact that they can properly identify who the face belongs to. This condition causes patients with Capgras delusion to believe that the person has been replaced with a look-alike imposter.

The film is about a man (played by John Gallagher Jr.) who attempts to track down the woman (played by Kate Lyn Sheil) that he has been in an online-only relationship with when he suspects that she has lied to him about key details of her life. The film was released in a limited release on October 24, 2014, by Filmbuff.http://www.indiewire.com/article/sxsw-darling-the-heart-machine- gets-october-release-date-from-filmbuff-20140724  Plot  After they meet on a dating site, Cody and Virginia begin chatting with each other over Skype and subsequently start a long distance relationship. Virginia tells Cody that although she lives in Germany, she plans to return to the New York City area in six months, and they make plans to meet. As they grow emotionally closer, Cody experiences second thoughts when a series of details seem to contradict Virginia's story, such as the sirens of emergency vehicles that sound North American. Cody becomes very confused when he sees what he believes to be Virginia on a New York City subway train. He does not approach her, but in his next Skype chat with her, he says he spotted her doppelg√§nger. Virginia is revealed to be living in New York City and using social networking apps to meet people for casual sex. Cody, who uses aural cues in their Skype chats to track down likely locations, begins to visit places she has mentioned. In a bar, he meets a man who recognizes her face but does not know her. After listening to Cody's story, he says that Virginia is likely messing with him, and he directs Cody to a cafe that Virginia frequents. There, Cody meets a barista that matches the profile of someone Virginia said she once dated. Later, Cody ingratiates himself into the barista's house, where he attempts to casually inquire about Virginia. When the man becomes suspicious of his motives, Cody excuses himself and leaves. Cody further investigates Virginia's life and studies her pictures on Facebook to find out who her friends are. When he discovers one of them is going to a venue, he waits until she arrives and then joins the line. After making small talk with her, they end up at her apartment and begin to make out. Cody stops and asks her questions about Virginia, which confuses her. After he checks her phone and computer for evidence that she knows Virginia, she angrily orders him to leave. Cody uses Craigslist's missed connections feature to meet with another of Virginia's friends. Later, he locates the apartment complex in which she lives, and when he finds evidence of food that she has eaten on Skype in the building's trash, he stops accepting her calls. Virginia realizes that she can not keep the illusion up any longer, and they finally meet face-to-face. Virginia explains that she has had many failed relationships that began very well, and she wanted to find some way to make this one work. Thinking that if they could never meet in person that it might preserve the relationship, she impulsively lied when he asked to meet her in their first Skype conversation. Cody silently listens to her explanation, then tells her that the relationship was a mistake. The film ends as he walks away.  Cast  * John Gallagher, Jr. as Cody * Kate Lyn Sheil as Virginia * David Call as Dale * Louisa Krause as Jessica * Roderick Hill as Brett * Halley Wegryn-Gross as Sarah * Libby Woodbridge as Caitlyn  Production  The initial idea came to Wigon after one of his relationships ended. Although the relationship had gone well while it temporarily transitioned to Skype, it ended once they reunited and Wigon realized that they had drifted apart. This experience inspired Wigon to imagine a character who prefers Skype-based relationships. Wigon wrote the film when he was going through a period of loneliness and feeling isolated. The script was designed to focus on these everyday issues for two people: one who uses the Internet to escape, and another who descends into obsession. One of the themes of the film is how convenience comes at a price, such as how Wigon feels technological convenience can cause the loss of a human aspect in Internet-based relationships. The film is not meant to be a criticism of technology itself but an exploration of how technology facilitates compartmentalization, such as different apps that can compartmentalize the various aspects of a relationship. Gallagher said it was \\"a very nonjudgmental story of people doing some very questionable things\\". Sheil said that, as two shy people, the characters depended on technology as a buffer in order to open up to each other; however, it also made it easier for them to be self- destructive in their relationship. Sheil was worried that her character could be an object of obsession for Gallagher's character, but she and Wigon worked to make sure that Virginia was more fleshed-out. Shooting took place in New York City over 18 days. For the scenes in which the actor conversed using Skype, the actors were put in different rooms of the same house and filmed their conversations using the application. Due to Internet outages and software failures, they had to reshoot several scenes. The actors rehearsed their scenes face-to-face prior to shooting to develop a sense of intimacy. Wigon estimated 10‚Äì15% of the film was improvised, and he encouraged the actors to improvise during the Skype conversations. In order to illustrate Virginia's deception, the set design was deliberate, as Wigon wanted to ensure that it showed she was attempting to hide her location. Wigon used slow, 360 degree pan shots in order to build tension. He said that he wanted to build as much tension and paranoid anxiety as possible, so as to make it seem as though Cody may be in danger of losing his mind from the ordeal. Wigon also wanted avoid what he called generic sitcom shots that reveal nothing about the scene. Wigon, a film critic for The Village Voice among other publications, said that his filmmaking helped inform his criticism more than the reverse; while editing the film, he said he developed a greater understanding of narrative construction. Influences included The Conversation, Simon Killer, and Eyes Wide Shut.  Release  After a crowdfunding campaign to finance its distribution, The Heart Machine premiered at SXSW on March 8, 2014. It was theatrically released on October 24, 2014.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 95% of 20 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7/10. Metacritic rated it 72/100 based on nine reviews. Andrew Barker of Variety wrote, \\"Kate Lyn Sheil and John Gallagher Jr. give excellent performances in Zachary Wigon's impressive debut.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"a thoughtful, emotionally tricky debut benefiting from two strong lead performances\\". Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote that it \\"neatly expresses anxieties about love\\" in a modern context, but \\"it doesn‚Äôt entirely deliver on its promising buildup\\". Shelley Farmer of Indiewire rated it \\"B\\" and wrote, \\"While Wigon's film lacks emotional weight, that deficiency is not a matter of style over substance, but an effective comment on the peculiarly isolating nature of modern communication technology.\\" Sheila O'Malley of The Dissolve rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Except for its ending, which deflates the tension and makes a brief gesture toward profundity, it‚Äôs an unblinking look at one man's total unraveling.\\" Neha Aziz of The Austin Chronicle wrote that it \\"has a deeply compelling storyline and solid performances\\", but Virginia's back story is lackluster. Calum Marsh of The Village Voice wrote, \\"What results is an exemplary mystery, a paranoid thriller rooted in contemporary technology but not crafted to denounce it.\\" Tomas Hachard of NPR wrote that the film's deliberate pacing \\"is central to making The Heart Machine such an unsettling love story\\". Jenni Miller of The A.V. Club wrote, \\"The Heart Machine‚Äôs denouement is ultimately disappointing, but the film is still one of the more successful cinematic portrayals of online intimacy.\\" Jennifer Chang of Under the Radar rated it 3/10 stars and wrote, \\"Despite Gallagher and Sheil‚Äôs acting finesse, an hour and half is simply too long to spend with self-absorbed characters as they sum up all the unpleasantness of online dating.\\" Details listed it as a must-see Netflix film for March 2015.

Evangelina Rodr√≠guez, pionera m√©dica dominicana. Santo Domingo: Ed. Manat√≠, 2003  Early life  She was born on November 10, 1879, in San Rafael de el Yuma, La Altagracia (Dominican Republic), in a poor family. Her mother, Felipa Perozo, was an illiterate peasant who was left pregnant by Ram√≥n Rodr√≠guez, a wealthy merchant of the area who was also an officer in the army of Pedro Santana. Her mother first abandoned her, and then her father did the same when she was a child and her paternal grandmother took charge of her. Rodr√≠guez's grandmother Tomasina Suero de Rod√≠guez , was a marchanta (itinerant female vendor of homemade confections and sweets) in San Pedro de Macor√≠s. Many of Rodr√≠guez's family and friends called her Lilina as a nickname. At the age of 6, Rodr√≠guez was selling gofio (a sweet toasted cornmeal powder) that her grandmother made at home to help pay for her school fees. Her father would occasionally visit.  Career   Medical career  At the age of 12 Rodr√≠guez became a part- time home health aid to Dominican Poet and journalist Rafael Alfredo or \\"Pepe C√°ndido\\" Deligne (1863-1902) [1], who had fallen ill to leprosy. This encounter allowed Rafael Alfredo to become Rodr√≠guez mentor the opportunity led her to attend the Instituto de Se√±oritas in the Dominican Republic. There Rodr√≠guez began her college career in pursuit of becoming a teacher. Once accepted into the school of Instituto de Se√±oritas, there she meets the founder of Instituto de se√±oritas Salom√© Ure√±a, Anacaona Moscoso who invested and encourage her to become her predecessor as headmistress of an all-girl grade school. In addition, before Anacaona Moscoso passing due to childbirth complication, she motivated Rodr√≠guez to pursue medical school. When [2] Rodr√≠guez completed secondary schooling, she continued teaching and in October 1903 Rodr√≠guez began medical school at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo Departamento de Medicina founded in 1538, (Predecessor) Rodr√≠guez received her medical degree in 1909, becoming the first woman to earn her medical degree in the Dominican Republic She is the first doctor of the university institute of the Dominican Republic. As a young and medical physician of color, Rodr√≠guez attempted to make a living in San Pedro de Macor√≠s but founded it challenging to do so as an inexperienced female doctor. As a result of the lack of profits, Rodr√≠guez moved to the region of Ramom Santana [4] which was home to the many who were part of the guerrilla resistant‚Äôs and oppose actively the American invasion of United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916‚Äì1924). There Rodr√≠guez provided medical and teaching services for greater funds and experiences. In 1921, three years of providing free medical care in San Francisco and neighboring poor rural communities, Rodr√≠guez left for Paris so she could continue her studies and practice medicine. In 1926, she returned to the Dominican Republic, with an advanced degree in obstetrics and public health care along with a degree in politics. In addition, there in Ramom Santana is where she has the first encounter with Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo.Rodr√≠guez considered dictator Rafael Trujillo a threat to the nation and refused to remain silent. As a result of her defiance to the Trujillo regime 1930s and 1940s the Dominican Feminist Action {Acci√≥n Feminista Dominicana (AFD)} alliance with the regime erased Rodr√≠guez's contributions to Dominican history as well as, women‚Äôs health care in the island and other activists like herself from official Dominican feminist memories and history. As the Trujillo‚Äôs authoritarian regime rose to power beginning in 1935 Rodr√≠guez fell victim to Trujillo‚Äôs brutality which led to the destruction of her medical practices as she was shunned by local politicians and her professional colleagues.

Rodr√≠guez Perozo also had advocated for school-based sex education, family planning, birth control, and venereal disease prevention and treatment. [8] Much of her radical ideas as it was seen then for the progression of women‚Äôs healthcare came from the influences of her time in France for medical school where she was trained to be a gynecologist. Once she returned from Frances and saw a high rate of venereal disease, she began to provide free health care to women in need this included visiting the prostitute neighborhood. In addition, to giving free milk to nursing mothers and free food to poor children.  Educator  Rodr√≠guez mentor Anacaona Moscoso Puello (1876-1907) founded the Instituto de Se√±oritas (Young Ladies Institution) in 1898 and personally enrolled Rodr√≠guez in her first class that graduated in 1902. Following the death of her mentor, Rodr√≠guez agreed to become the director of the \\"Young Ladies Instituto Profesional\\" in 1907. Rodr√≠guez taught at the Young Ladies Institute during the day, and in the evenings at the Laborers and Domestic Workers Night School (Escuela Nocturna para Obreros y Dom√©sticas). In teaching at both schools, she wrote and published her 1915 book titled Granos de polen (Pollen Grains), on hygienic and childrearing.  Writing  In addition to Perozo's medical work, she was also an author and published her first book Granos de polen in 1915, and subsequently published some poems and articles in the magazine \\"F√©mina.\\" On her return from the French capital she published a second book, titled Le Guerisseur: Cuento Chino B√≠blico Filos√≥fico de Moral Social. Her biographer Antonio Zaglul also indicates that she prepared the manuscript of a novel titled Selene in honor of her adoptive daughter, but destroyed it in a fit of anger.  Death  Zaglul also states that she was seized for her opposition to the regime of Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo and her strong criticism of the government, and that she was held in a fortress in San Pedro de Macoris and tortured. She was later abandoned on a road near the town of Hato Mayor. She died on January 11, 1947, after several days of agony.  Legacy  Despite the Trujillo‚Äôs authoritarian regime attempt to erase Rodr√≠guez from official documented Dominican History, she is remembered in the Dominican Republic today, as a pioneer in the Dominican medical field especially as it relates to women health care. She is honored by having the Dominican Social Security Institute (IDSS) reopened, remodeled, and renaming the Dominican Women's Hospital in Santo Domingo and San Rafael del Yuma after her [9]. in addition, to the Dominican Republic establishing and naming the elementary school of Evangelina Rodr√≠guez (Ni√±a) in her hometown of San Pedro de Macor√≠s.Rodr√≠guez was never married, however she did adopt a daughter Selisette S√°nchez Santiago, whose mother was a patient of Rodr√≠guez but died after giving birth to her daughter in 1929.

It consisted of two regional groups, Walternienburg and Bernburg which interacted closely with each other. Both are named after burial sites in Saxony-Anhalt. Alfred G√∂tze identified the Bernburg type in 1892 and the Walternienburg in 1911. Nils √Öberg linked them together as the Walternienburg-Bernburg Culture in 1918, as two closely connected or completely co-extensive cultures. This suggestion is no longer valid, however, since the two cultures have clearly distinct funerary and burial practices. The earlier large stone graves attributed to the Walternienburg culture are today assigned to the Tiefstichkeramik culture and the shape of pottery belonging to the Walternienburg culture shows that it was in the Tiefstichkeramik tradition. History The Bernburg Culture emerged about 3200 BC as a late southern offshoot of the Funnelbeaker culture.  Material artifacts  The Walternienburg group is recognisable by the appearance of sharply articulated handle-cups and hanging vessels with eyelets. The vessels of the Bernburg group on the other hand are rather bulbous, concave, and curved in an 's' shape. The pottery of both groups is decorated with deep incisions, which were partially filled with a white paste and thereby made to stand out. The dominant ceramic forms are decorated and undecorated bulbous handled cups, belly amphorae, funnel beakers and bowls. Clay drums also appear. Especially typical is the presence of double-axes, and slate blades, as well as triangular and trapezoidal flint arrowheads. The group lacks two major types of artefacts which are typical of the funnelbeaker culture: funnelbeakers and collar bottles.  Burials  The graves take on many forms. Common forms include flat graves, stone cists and stone chamber tombs. Communal burials in Totenh√ºtte are found at Sch√∂nstedt and Benzingerode. Rampenkiste and Mauerkammern are also widespread. The skeletal material shows evidence of trepanation.  Relative Quantity  The 178 excavated graves (Stand 1982) can be divided as follows: *86 (48,3 %): Bernburg Culture *40 (22,5 %): Walternienburg Culture *12 (6,75 %): Walternienburg and Bernburg Culture *34 (19%): Walternienburg-Bernburg Culture *5 (2,75 %): Globular Amphora culture (which is associated with the Bernburg forms) *1 (0,5 %): corded ware culture. The separation of the Walternienburg- Bernburg culture into two separate cultures in Hesse and along the Havel is apparent in the funerary and burial remains. The graves of the Bernburg culture are in Thuringia and North Harzvorland, while the Walternienburg culture is concentrated in the Havel watershed. In the area around Quedlinburg, in eastern Harzvorland and around K√∂then however, a clear mixing of the forms of both cultures can be observed in the inventories of graves.  Settlements Village settlements and fortified citadel settlements are widespread. Known citadels with multiple graves are found on the Lang Berg in D√∂lauer Heide near Halle, the Schalkenburg near Quenstadt and the Steinkuhlenberg near Derenburg.  Economy  The basis of the economy was agriculture and cattle farming. Emmer, Einkorn, barley and flax were known and grown. They are known to have domesticated cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs and horses. Genetics found that the emergence of the Bernburg Culture was accompanied by a significant genetic shift. People of the Bernburg Culture were found to be closely related to people of the Scandinavian Funnelbeaker culture, having a much higher proportion of maternal lineages associated with hunter-gatherers. While previous cultures of the area displayed genetic affinites to the Middle East, the Bernburg culture is shifted towards Northern Europe. examined the remains of a Salzm√ºnde/Bernburg male buried in Esperstedt, c. 3360-3086 BC. He was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup I2a1b1a1 and the maternal haplogroup T2b. noted that the emergence of the Bernburg culture was associated by a significant increase in hunter- gatherer lineages as compared to previous cultures of Central Europe. The amount of hunter-gatherer maternal lineages among the Bernburg people was estimated at c. 30%. Similar high levels of hunter-gatherer lineages is observable among Funnelbeaker groups further north. The authors of the study suggested that the Bernburg culture emerged through the migration of peoples from Scandinavia. examined remains from the 1st to 2nd century AD site of Kowalenko, Poland, which was part of the Iron Age Wielbark culture. The mtDNA of the females examined was found to be most closely related to the Bernburg culture, while the mtDNA of the males was found to be most closely related to the Jutland Iron Age. A later study by examined the 2nd to 4th century AD site at Mas≈Çomƒôcz, Poland, also ascribed to the Wielbark culture. The mtDNA of the examined individuals was very similar to that of the Bernburg culture. It was found that several major cultures of Late Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age cultures, such as the Corded Ware culture, Bell Beaker culture and Unetice culture, shared strong maternal genetic affinity with the Bernburg culture.

There were two incarnations of the band; one in the summer of 1967, and another in autumn of the same year. The latter incarnation of the band was based in Oberlin College, and gained local recognition for their improvisational instrumentals. In 1968, the band released one album ‚Äì before disbanding ‚Äì that since then has garnered interest for its experimental electronic rock musical style. As a result, reissues of the album have been released. History In 1967, Steve Detray, a college student in Oberlin College, visited his brother in Logan, Utah, and during that time Detray formed The Ant Trip Ceremony. The name was formulated by a college professor who read the term in a novel which described modern human society. The first version of the band briefly toured the region, but broke up when Detray returned to college for the 1967‚Äì1968 school year. Detray retained the name, and the more notable formation of the Ant Trip Ceremony was formed with other college students in the summer of 1967. The second band included Detray on lead guitar, multi instrumentalist George Galt, Roger Goodman as lead vocalist, Gary Rosen on bass guitar, Jeff Williams on drums, and Mark Stein on percussion. Taking influence from west coast psychedelic rock bands, the band performed at local gigs playing mostly cover versions that they prolonged in complex instrumentals. Concerts usually lasted for hours, and the songs the band played were improvised so that no two selections were similar. The band's live material, and subsequent album, was one of the earliest examples of electronic rock mixed with eastern influences. In February 1968, the band processed through their first of two studio sessions for their first album. The second session was in the spring of 1968, but Detray was not present for the proceedings. The band was self-produced the album on campus with assistance from a student named David Crosby (not David Crosby of Byrds fame, contrary to the legend). On a low budget, the album was plaqued by technical difficulties from their primitive machinery. The band used a KHL deck tape a two track Roberts reel to reel for recording. For the instances when the group wanted to multi track, they would record on one side of the track and then on the other one as well, and finally mix it into the KHL. The vocals noticeably sounded distant than the band desired as a result of a faulty right speaker. The fault caused the speaker balance to lean heavily to the left which affected the final mix-down. The final mastering was complete in Cleveland Recordings Studio. The album, named 24 Hours, had 300 copies, highlighted by their cover version of \\"Hey Joe\\", released in 1968 and distributed by the college bookstore. By the end of 1968, the band disbanded when the members graduated from Oberlin College. Following numerous bootlegs of the band's album, an official re-release of the album was released by Collectables Records in 1999. A follow-up was released on December 2, 2010, featuring an essay on the group's recordings, a digitally remastered sound, and the original cover art. 24 Hours album Track listing Side one # \\"Locomotive Lamp\\" (Rosen) # \\"What's the Matter Now\\" (Galt) # \\"Violets of Dawn\\" (Eric Anderson) # \\"Riverdawn\\" (Galt) # \\"Hey Joe\\" (Billy Roberts) # \\"Outskirts\\" (Neal Evans, Sandy Lyne) # \\"Little Baby\\" (Willie Dixon) Side two # \\"Get Out of My Life\\" (Allen Toussaint) # \\"Four in the Morning\\" (Robin Remaily) # \\"Sometimes I Wonder\\" (Major Lance) # \\"Pale Shades of Gray\\" (Detray, Goodman) # \\"Elaborations\\" (Detray) References Category:1967 in American music Category:Musical groups established in 1967 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1968 Category:American psychedelic rock music groups Category:Electronic rock musical groups Category:Rock music groups from Utah ","title":"Ant Trip Ceremony"},{"id":"46198861","text":"Silvestre Enrique Faya Viesca (born 15 July 1952) is a Mexican politician from the National Action Party.

It is part of the rural teacher‚Äôs school system that was created as part of an ambitious mass education plan implemented by the state in the 1920s. Mois√©s S√°enz was the head of the Secretariat of Public Education at the time of the college's creation. The project for rural teachers' colleges had a strong component of social transformation, which has made it a hotbed for social movements. In that sense, Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers‚Äô College is of high importance because it is where important figures like Lucio Caba√±as Barrientos and Genaro V√°zquez Rojas were educated and later on were the ones to lead important guerrilla movements in Mexico during the 20th century.  Education  The Rural Isidro Burgos Teachers‚Äô College offers licensing to students that want to work in the elementary education system. The college is regulated by the educational standards that rule the state of Guerrero and in all of Mexico. According to a survey made by the State's Secretariat of Public Education of Guerrero, in Ayotzinapa there were 532 students, served by 6 Technical Support workers. The students are all male.State Education Secretariat of the state of Guerrero The students come primarily from poor families that live in areas with the lowest human development indexes in Mexico and areas with a high illiteracy rate.  History  Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers‚Äô College was founded in 1926 by the Secretariat of Public Education in Mexico, directed by Mois√©s S√°enz. These colleges were based on the ideals of taking education to smaller towns, an idea proposed by Jos√© Vasconcelos, the Mexican Secretary of Education at the time. In Ayotzinapa College‚Äôs classrooms, important figures like Lucio Caba√±as Barrientos, Genaro V√°zquez Rojas and Oth√≥n Salazar were educated. Caba√±as was a leader of the Party of the Poor (Mexico), a guerrilla organization with a notable presence in the southeast of Guerrero. Because of this history of social leaders, Ayotzinapa Teachers‚Äô College is considered a hot bed for guerrilla conflict. Every year the students at this college get together and go to the capital city of their state, Chilpancingo, to ask for a solution to their needs through things like protests and demonstrations. Among other things, they ask for renovations in their institution and a revision of the budget assigned for students‚Äô on- campus living.  Attack  On the night of September 26, 2014, a group of students from this institution hijacked some buses hoping that they could participate in the demonstrations of October 2 in Mexico City. Allegedly, elements from the municipal police of Iguala and members of the criminal organization Guerreros Unidos attacked the group of students under the command of Jos√© Luis Abarca Vel√°zquez, the mayor of Iguala. This event turned out to be rather significant with the disappearance of 43 students, 6 dead people, and 25 injured. News of the attack made international headlines with numerous international and human rights organizations urging the Mexican State to conduct an in-depth investigation. On October 9 the guerrilla group ERPI, Ej√©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo Insurgente (People‚Äôs Insurgent Revolutionary Army), announced the creation of Brigada de ajusticiamiento 26 de Septiembre and declared this brigade united against the murder of these students. On January 27, 2015, the Attorney General of Mexico notified about their advances on the investigation on the missing students, clarifying that it was basically an inside job between Guerreros Unidos and the PRD mayor in Iguala, Jos√© Luis Abarca. The students were kidnapped, murdered, incinerated and the ashes thrown into a river. According to the official version from the National Attorney, the rival group of Guerreros Unidos: Los Rojos, along with the Dean of Ayotzinapa‚Äôs Teachers‚Äô College, had encouraged the students to go on the demonstrations against the mayor of Iguala. Due to the confusion and the uncertainty about whether or not they were students or members of their rival group Los Rojos, or a mix of both, the Guerreros Unidos cartel decided to just execute these students as they usually would with antagonistic groups and were supported by PRD‚Äôs authorities in Iguala, given the constant revolts from the students and their frequent protests.

They arrived on July 8, 1870, to a place called Omandongo in Ovamboland. This became the first mission station there.Peltola 1958, p. 91. In the mid-1870s the mission society was already on a safe footing. However, Sirelius was no longer as energetic as he had earlier been, and his growing family needed a better income than what was possible in the mission society.

Born in England, Winser briefly played minor counties cricket for Staffordshire, before emigrating to Australia, where he played Sheffield Shield cricket for South Australia. He also excelled as an amateur golfer, winning several tournaments in Australia, and was the secretary to the Governor of South Australia. Early life in England Born at High Legh, Cheshire, Winser was educated at Oundle School. He made his debut in minor counties cricket for Staffordshire against the Lancashire Second XI in the 1906 Minor Counties Championship, playing a total of 21 Minor Counties Championship matches from 1906 to 1909. He was a part of the Staffordshire team which won the Minor Counties Championship in 1908. In his capacity as wicket-keeper, Winser would have kept wicket to one of the best bowlers in the world at the time, Sydney Barnes, who played much of his domestic career at minor counties level. Move to Australia Winser emigrated to Australia in 1909, becoming an orchardist at Blackwood, South Australia. He soon began playing cricket for South Australia, making his debut in first-class cricket in the 1913/14 Sheffield Shield against New South Wales. He played in three Shield matches that season and was a strong candidate to be a part of the Australia team to tour South Africa, which was cancelled due to the onset of World War I. He became the Private Secretary to Sir Henry Galway, the Governor of South Australia, in 1915. He would serve in his capacity as Private Secretary to a succession of governors. He made his final appearances in first-class cricket in 1920, playing two matches for South Australia in the 1920‚Äì21 Sheffield Shield. He was the Australian Amateur golf champion in 1921. By the time of the infamous bodyline tour of 1932/33, Wisner was serving as the Private Secretary to Alexander Hore-Ruthven, who was in England at the time. Following the third Test match at Adelaide and the controversy that arose from it, Winser arranged for an urgent cable to be sent to Hore-Ruthven in England, urging him to make contact with the Dominions Office in order to avoid a full-scale diplomatic incident. He later retired to Barwon Heads, Victoria, where he died on 20 December 1983. At the time of his death he was the oldest living Sheffield Shield cricketer.

October 18, 1845 in Hauho ‚Äì May 21, 1906 in Saarij√§rvi) was a Finnish minister, and after C. G. T√∂tterman, the third mission director of the Finnish Missionary Society. Background Hirn came from a came from a family of clerics. His father was Daniel Kristian Hirn (1807‚Äì1884), assistant pastor of Hauho. His mother was Gustava Sofia Ulrika Alopaeus (‚Ä† 1869). Hirn went to school in the Porvoo Gymnasium. He graduated from the university with a degree in theology in 1870, and he was ordained a minister in 1871. He worked as a prison chaplain in Helsinki from 1884 on. Tenure as the mission director Hirn worked as the director of the mission society for a short period, from 1895 to 1898. He was said to have been a \\"conscientious, deliberative and hard working director\\". He worked as the mission director beside his work as a prison chaplain. During Hirn's tenure the mission society was given bad press, and also the relations to the Evangelical movement began to deteriorate. Members of this movement had earlier been among the most eager to support mission work, and the mission society and the Evangelical movement had held joint Mission and Gospel Feasts. Setbacks in Ovamboland had the effect that The Lutheran Evangelical Association of Finland decided to begin mission work on its own, in Japan, the decision of which was taken in 1898. Also, there were no more joint mission feasts with the Finnish Missionary Society. Donations to mission work increased during Hirn's tenure, however, and also the circulation of the mission magazines were rising, and there were more knitting societies for mission work. Hirn was succeeded as the director of the FMS by Jooseppi Mustakallio.Peltola 1958, p. 129‚Äì130. Work after the mission society After his tenure in the mission society, Hirn worked from 1900 on as the vicar of Saarij√§rvi. He died while in this position in 1906. Private life Hirn was married to Selma Erika Sofia Sylvin, who was originally from Sweden. It appears to be the case that they did not have children.

He was also a poet and a lyricist. His best known poem is called ‚ÄúEvening Song‚Äù. Background Mustakallio‚Äôs parents were chaplain Henrik Schwartzberg ja Laura Katariina Stenb√§ck. Mustakallio graduated from the Kuopio Lyceum in 1878 and obtained a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1883.Kansallinen el√§m√§nkerrasto 4, p. 134‚Äì135. Mustakallio first worked as teacher in Pori, teaching religion and the Finnish language. In 1889 he was ordained a minister. After that he taught religion in Savonlinna and Kuopio. Mustakallio became an employee of the FMS in 1897, first as a teacher of the FMS Mission School. During the summer of 1898 he travelled to Germany, in order to acquaint himself with the work of the various German missionary societies.Pohjoismaiden l√§hetyshistoria, p. 52. Tenure as the mission director 1898‚Äì1913 Mustakallio was elected mission director in 1898.Peltola 1958, p. 129‚Äì130. Inspection trip to Ovamboland in 1900 The FMS had long been planning an inspection of the mission field in Ovamboland in South West Africa, which was at the time the only mission field of this organization. The Finns had worked there for 30 years, without a single visit from Finland. During the last few years, the Finnish missionaries had been criticized heavily in Finland, for an apparent lack of results. For this reason the missionaries had been hoping for a visit from by the director of the FMS. At that time there were four missionaries in the field with their families, along with two unmarried female missionaries. Mustakallio left for Africa on 31 January 1900, and he arrived there on 22 June the same year, together with Emil Liljeblad, who now began his first term in Ovamboland. Mustakallio stayed on the field for six weeks. He first visited the mission station of Olukonda. The 30th anniversary of Finnish mission work was held there, and there were 600 persons present at the festivities. Mustakallio inspected all the schools and the mission stations of Olukonda, Ondangwa and Oniipa as well as the auxiliary mission station of Omulonga. He was due to stay for four months on the field, but the visit was shortened to six weeks, one of the reasons for this was that he fell ill with malaria. Before the visit, the livelihood of the missionaries had been a big problem, the allocated monies having been insufficient, but as a result of this inspection trip, the wages of the missionaries were raised.Peltola 1958, p. 130‚Äì131, 138.Mestarin k√§skyst√§, p. 76, 134. Mission work is begun in China The experiences of other mission societies had shown, that the work benefited from having more than one mission field. For this reason, the board of trustees of the FMS began to contemplate the opening of another mission field, preferably somewhere closer to Finland than the mission field in SW Africa. In the annual convention of 1899, Mustakallio suggested that another mission field be opened somewhere in Northern China. The convention approved of this idea. One of the ideas behind this decision was that interaction between missionaries of different mission fields would be fruitful for the work of the mission society as a whole. It was also surmised that with a new mission field, support for mission work would grow in Finland. The third argument went as follows: if the mission society only had one mission field, and for some unforeseen reasons the work there would have to be abandoned, then the mission society would have nowhere to pursue its goals. In Ovamboland the society was already in a difficult situation, as its work was confined to the kingdom of Ondonga with a population of only some 21000 persons. For these reasons it was considered wise to open a second mission field.Saarilahti 1960, p. 16, 18‚Äì19. At first the FMS considered work in Manchuria, or at least somewhere in Northern China, but in the end Hunan was chosen, because it had been inaccessible for foreigners for a long time and had only recently been opened for mission work. When the Boxer Rebellion and its aftermath were over, the first Finnish missionaries to China were sent along, and they stepped ashore in Shanghai in October 1901. It seems that Hannes Sj√∂blom made the final choice of the location of the new mission field, after he had consulted a number of mission societies that worked in China.Saarilahti 1960, p. 24‚Äì25, 28‚Äì31. Moving to parish work The post as the mission director had been a demanding one for Mustakallio, and his tenure had been marked by restlessness. This was due to his intensive approach towards his duties, along with his impatient nature, as he wanted to make quick decisions and achieve more or less instant closures. It seems that in 1910 he was beginning to contemplate moving to a post in some parish of the Finnish church. He stated that his nervous system had been overburdened and his energy was insufficient for the work as the mission director, and in February 1911 he informed the board of trustees that he had sought a job as the dean of Porvoo. However, he was not elected to this post. Around this time, a new inspection trip to Ovamboland was planned, and due to Mustakallio‚Äôs situation, the vice director Hannu Haahti was sent there. Mustakallio now felt that he had been excluded from some of his most important duties and protested, but the board did not change their decision. In 1913 Mustakallio applied for the post of the vicar of Viipuri Rural Parish. He received the majority of the votes, and the moved to his new post later during the same year. Matti Tarkkanen was elected as his successor in the mission society, but he only assumed this post in February 1914.Saarilahti 1989, p. 294‚Äì298. After the mission society Mustakallio worked as the vicar of the Viipuri Rural Parish from 1913 to 1919. He was granted the title of a provost in 1915. He moved to Parikkala in 1919, becoming the local vicar there. He was appointed the rural dean of the area in 1920. He worked as the assessor of the Savonlinna cathedral chapter from 1918 to 1912.

After graduation in 1907, he enrolled at the Faculty of Medicine in Bucharest. The next year, he enrolled at the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Natural Sciences, from which he graduated in 1912. After graduation, he embarked on a Ph.D. at the Botanical Institute in Bucharest, which he obtained in 1916 with a doctoral thesis entitled ' (Study of the species of Campanula L. in the Heterophyllae growing in Romania). The work was well received and noted with '. SƒÉvulescu became the first doctor of botany at the University of Bucharest. Career Between 1912 and 1921 he worked at the Botanical Institute of Cotroceni and in 1918 he was appointed lecturer in the Department of Plant Morphology and Institute of Systematic Botany in Bucharest. For a quarter of a century, he divided his work between the College of Agriculture at HerƒÉstrƒÉu Park, where he taught Systematics and Phytopathology, and the Plant and the Agricultural Research Institute of Romania, founded by Gheorghe Ionescu-Sise»ôti. He organized a network of warning stations across Romania to combat vine mildew. In 1929 he founded a laboratory for the study of insecticide-fungicide substances, the laboratory subsequently becoming the national Plant Protection Service. He also initiated the first phytosanitation laws and quarantine control in Romania. In 1928 he founded the academic journal Starea fitosanitarƒÉ a Rom√¢niei (Phytosanitary status of Romania), published annually, which covered matters of plant protection. On 25 May 1936, SƒÉvulescu became a correspondent member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences. In June 1938 SƒÉvulescu featured in a documentary film of an expedition in the Danube Delta, exploring the local flora.

He contributed to the development of bacteriology and protozoology in England, South Africa and Australia. Dodd established a research station in Queensland that was to become the Animal Research Institute, and he was the first lecturer in veterinary bacteriology at the University of Sydney. He became one of the foremost bacteriologists in Australia.  Family  Sydney Dodd was born about 1874 in Sevenoaks, Kent, England. His parents were Francis Dodd (born c. 1827, Ireland), and Amy Dodd (born c. 1842, Sittingbourne, Kent). He had at least two older brothers, George and William, and a younger brother Francis. He married Clara (also known as Clare) Annie Brooker, a hospital nurse (born 1879, Chatham, Kent), in 1904 while living in Wealdstone, Middlesex. Dodd died in 1926 after a short illness at his home in Cremorne, Sydney, Australia, and his remains were taken to the Rookwood Crematorium in Sydney for interment.  Education  Dodd graduated in 1902 with honours from the Royal Veterinary College, London, becoming a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (MRCVS). In 1910 the University of Melbourne conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Veterinary Science. His thesis was: Spirochaetosis in Fowls in Queensland.  Career  After graduating Dodd initially continued at the Royal Veterinary College as Demonstrator of Pathology and assistant to John McFadyean, Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology and a leading veterinary scientist. This post provided Dodd with experience in veterinary research and vaccine preparation. Throughout his career Dodd was to publish many of his scientific papers in the quarterly started and edited by McFadyean, The Journal of Comparative Pathology and Therapeutics .  South Africa  Dodd had served during the Boer War prior to his veterinary qualification. In 1905 after returning to South Africa he became the assistant government veterinary bacteriologist to Arnold Theiler at the Daspoort laboratories in Pretoria. In addition to taking charge of vaccine production, his research work was notable for spirochaetosis in livestock and is credited for recognising its bacterial cause in pigs which was published in 1906 as . While in South Africa he contracted typhoid in early 1907. It was in South Africa that Dodd gained experience with tick-borne diseases of livestock. In 1907 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (FRCVS). His fellowship resulted in part by investigating a then unknown respiratory infection in turkeys, (1905), later deemed likely to have been infectious sinusitis (caused by Mycoplasma gallisepticum) complicated with fowl cholera.  Queensland  The Queensland Government engaged Dodd in 1907 as Principal Veterinary Surgeon and Bacteriologist, following a cattle tick conference in May of that year. Instructed by the Queensland Government, Dodd visited North America on-route to Australia to investigate bovine tick fever in the United States and Canada (also known as redwater or Texas fever: see babesiosis, anaplasmosis). In Queensland Dodd proposed an experimental farm for livestock disease which he established as the Stock Experiment Station in 1909 at Yeerongpilly, Brisbane, later to become the Animal Research Institute. His research at this time included the first detection in Australia of a species of Theileria in cattle, a parasitic protozoan, published in 1910 as . Dodd resigned from the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock in April 1910, dissatisfied after seeking clarification of his duties.  Sydney University  In 1911 Dodd was appointed the first lecturer in veterinary bacteriology at the University of Sydney. He also lectured in veterinary pathology and was an honorary lecturer in preventive medicine at the University, where he remained until his death in 1926. Along with teaching, Dodd continued to perform valuable research. His work on black disease in sheep found an association between the causal bacterium and a liver fluke, (1921).  Military service  Before qualifying, Dodd served in South Africa with the British Army during the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902). Descriptions of his service include joining the Army Veterinary Department, and veterinary officer to the 10th Hussars. At the start of World War I Dodd was commissioned a captain in the Australian Army Veterinary Corps. He served with the Sea Transport Service on the Barambah taking troops and horses to Egypt in December 1914, and his service ended after returning to Australia on the Maiwu in March, 1915.  Recognition  Shortly after his death, the Sydney Dodd Memorial Committee was formed in 1927 to honour his contributions to veterinary research and teaching. Funds were raised and a bronze bust by G.

The lorry was unsuccessful struggling with heavy loads and was returned to its manufacturer. Other lorries were sold, one operating at Dinorwic Quarry for many years. Later in the 1920s the company was recorded as building half-tracks for military use and by 1929 was marketing a lorry. The company did not seem to get sufficient support from the parent so on 15 October 1929 they entered into an agreement with the Associated Equipment Company (AEC) and on 31 October 1929 a new company called 4-wheel Drive Motors Limited was formed with the major shareholder being the Underground Electric Railways Company of London Limited with Nyberg and Cleaver holding the remaining shares.

Some conferences had been established for football-playing schools, and as schools added other sports, adopted those under the conference banner once enough schools started playing. Smaller schools often picked up basketball first, adding other sports later, and combined with other in-county schools to form County conferences (or leagues, as they were usually referred to in the early days). Most of these leagues were formed in the 1920s and early 1930s after the tournament was started, which is why quite a few lack a definitive starting date at this point in time. Many of the conferences listed in this section were decimated by massive school consolidation between the 1940s and early 1970s. Where conferences had numerous small schools located within the same county before, they were left with fewer schools of varying sizes, forcing their members to look for (or create) conferences with other schools of similar size and athletic offerings. Conference membership in Ohio is voluntary, rather than assigned by the state association like in some states. While this ensures that many rivalries stay intact regardless of classification changes, it also means schools can choose to change conferences pending acceptance into a different conference, or in rare cases, can be forced out of a conference, depending on the rules set up by that particular league.

Early life and education In 1930, Epps was born in New Orleans to Ernest Cherrie Sr., a physician, and Anna Cherrie, a former schoolteacher. She attended Corpus Christi Elementary School and Xavier University Preparatory High School, both Catholic schools in New Orleans. Epps started studying at Howard University when she was 16. In 1951, at age 19, she graduated with a bachelor of science degree in zoology. Following her goal to become a physician, she applied to medical school at Howard University as well as Meharry Medical College. Epps was denied admission to both, however, attributed to her young age and gender. From 1954 to 1960, she worked as an instructor and the acting head of the medical technology department at Xavier University. In 1959, Epps earned her master's degree from Loyola University in microbiology. In 1966, Epps earned her doctoral degree in zoology from Howard University College of Medicine.  Research  Dr. Epps' early research at Howard focused on immunology, specifically the study of tropical and infectious diseases. Dr. Epps' research at Johns Hopkins, for which she was awarded a U.S. Public Health Service Faculty Research Fellowship, investigated immunology related to liver disease, stomach cancer, and alpha-1-fetoprotein. In 1993, Dr. Epps was commissioned by the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences to write ‚ÄúIncreasing Minority Participation in the Health Professions‚ÄîThe Problem of Under- representation and An Inventory and Analysis of Effective Strategies and Problems.‚Äù In addition to publishing journal articles and scientific reviews, Epps co-authored \\"An Act of Grade: The Right Side of History\\", a book detailing the history of Meharry Medical College over 133 years of its development. Career Starting in 1953, Epps first worked as a technologist in the clinical laboratories of Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in Cincinnati and Flint Goodridge Hospital in New Orleans. In 1954, she became an instructor and acting head of the medical technology department Xavier University of Louisiana until 1961. In 1961, Epps began work at Howard University College of Medicine as an assistant professor of microbiology. At the same time, she began doctoral research on immunological responses in chick embryos to grafts. She was awarded a PhD in 1966. In 1969, Dr. Epps began work as an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where she was awarded a U.S. Public Health Service Faculty Research Fellowship. After being awarded a second research fellowship in 1969 at Tulane University, Dr. Epps became an assistant professor of medicine in 1971. During this time, Dr. Epps extended the work she had done at Howard and developed MEdREP, the Medical Education Reinforcement and Enrichment Program. It is a summer program intended to provide minority students interested in a career in the medical field with opportunities to learn about a career in medicine and become more competitive candidates for medical school. In 1975, Dr. Epps became the Director of Medicine at the Tulane Medical Center. In 1980, she was promoted to the assistant dean of student services. In 1997, Dr. Epps became the first female dean of the School of Medicine at Meharry Medical College. At the time, she was also the only African-American woman with a Ph.D. to become dean of a U.S. medical school. As of 1999, Dr. Epps was the interim vice-president for academic affairs at Tulane. In 2013, at the age of 83, Dr. Epps became the president and CEO of the School of Medicine at Meharry Medical College, possibly the first African-American woman with a PhD to lead a medical school.  Boards and committees  Dr. Epps held key appointments on boards and committees that reflect her commitment to improving the medical sciences for minorities. Dr. Epps served as a member of the Minority Health Advisory Committee for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services and the National Board of Medical Examiners. Epps was also an emeritus member of the Georgetown University Board of Regents.  Awards and honors  In 1966, Epps was awarded a U.S. Public Health Service Faculty Research Fellowship while conducting research at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In 1969, Epps was awarded a second research fellowship to continue her work at Tulane University. In 2008, The Anna C. Epps, PhD - Morris A. Spirtes, MD Fund was established by Dr. Jim Doty, who attended the summer MEdREP program at Tulane in 1975. This fund endows two chairs and funds scholarships to assist economically disadvantaged students and is one of the largest gifts made to the Tulane School of Medicine. The Anna Cherrie Epps, Ph.D., Center for Educational Development and Support (CEDS) was established in 2007 at Meharry Medical College in honor of Dr. Epps efforts to foster excellence in teaching and learning medicine.

She was an early member of the Socialist Party of the Southeast and one of the first three women elected to a legislative body in Mexico. She taught for over fifty years and was still teaching at the time of her death. Biography Raquel Dzib Cicero was born in 1882 in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, Mexico to Justo Pastor Dzib and Francisca Cicero. In spite of her family's poverty, Dzib was determined to improve her education. She enrolled in the Instituto Literario de Ni√±as (ILN) (Literary Institute for Girls) under the direction of Rita Cetina Guti√©rrez. Dzib graduated as a professor in 1898 and taught at several schools throughout the state, including her alma mater. Her specialties were arithmetic, the Spanish language and line drawing, and she held the Chair of Castilian grammar at the Adolfo Cisneros C√°mara Secondary School. She participated in the First Feminist Congress of Mexico which occurred in 1916 in M√©rida under the auspices of governor Salvador Alvarado. The Liga de Profesores (Teacher's League) was formed in 1918, and Dzib served as its treasurer, scrupulously accounting for the funds. In 1922, she helped found the Feminist League of Yucat√°n, as part of the Socialist Party of the Southeast with Elvia Carrillo Puerto, Beatriz Peniche de Ponce, Rosa Torre Gonz√°lez, Adolfina Valencia and Consuelo Zavala. On November 18, 1923, three candidates who were members of the Liga Rita Cetina Gutierrez (League of Rita Cetina Guti√©rrez) were elected to the local legislature as candidates of the Socialist Party of the Southeast. Dzib was elected for the third district of the City of M√©rida, Elvia Carrillo Puerto elected by the District of Izamal, and Peniche by the second district of M√©rida. Their triumph at the polls was short-lived, as the women were forced out when governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto was assassinated in 1924. Dzib withdrew from politics after the assassination and dedicated her life to education. She was elected at an assembly to integrate the jury of honor and justice for the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educaci√≥n (SNTE) (National Union for Education Workers). When she had attained 50 years of teaching, Dzib was awarded a gold service medal. In her honor, the government of Yucat√°n awards the Raquel Dzib Cicero Medal annually to all teachers who have reached 30 years of uninterrupted service.

The Nixon Administration advocated a reversal of the long- standing policy of \\"termination\\" that had characterized relations between the U.S. Government and American Indians in favor of \\"self-determination.\\" The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act restructured indigenous governance in the state of Alaska, creating a unique structure of Native Corporations. Some of the most notable instances of American Indian activism occurred under the Nixon Administration including the Occupation of Alcatraz and the Standoff at Wounded Knee.  Termination policy  Prior to the 1950s, Indian tribes were considered semi-autonomous nations with complete governance over their own territory. Such autonomy allowed tribes to organize a tribal government, legislate and adjudicate, determine tribal membership, levy and collect taxes, enforce tribal laws, and control development of tribal resources.Terminating the Indian Termination Policy, Michael C. Walch, Stanford Law Review Vol. 35, No. 6 (Jul., 1983), pp. 1181-121, p. 1182. However, the United States' Indian policy gradually began to shift throughout the twentieth century. The United States government began to take a more involved role in the affairs of previously autonomous Indian tribes, and total assimilation of the Indians became the government's new policy line. In 1934, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act which sought to reorganize tribal systems of governance into forms foreign to Indians. Simultaneously, under the Indian Reorganization Act, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began to gain approval power over Indian constitutions, resource development, and cultural activities. A new era of assimilation characterized relations between the United States and Indians. This evolution of policy was formally codified into law with the passage of House Concurrent Resolution 108 and Public Law 280 in 1953.  House Concurrent Resolution 108  House Concurrent Resolution 108 of 1953 is often perceived as the formal codification of the official \\"termination\\" policy of the United States. Passed by the Eighty-Third Congress on August 1, 1953, the resolution sought to abolish tribal autonomy and subject Indians to the same laws as citizens of the United States. Furthermore, House Concurrent Resolution 108 opened the sale of tribal lands to non-Indians. > Whereas it is the policy of Congress as rapidly as possible, to make the > Indians within the territorial limits of the United States subject to the > same laws and entitled to the same privileges and responsibilities as are > applicable to other citizens of the United States, and to grant them all of > the rights and prerogatives pertaining to American citizenship; and whereas > the Indians within the territorial limits of the United States should assume > their full responsibilities as American citizens.Documents of United States > Indian Policy, House Concurrent Resolution 108, ed. Francis Paul Prucha, > University of Nebraska Press, 2000.  Public Law 280  Public Law 280 (PL-280), which passed on August 15, 1953, supplemented the tenets and policies outlined in House Concurrent Resolution 108. Public Law 280 sought to transfer criminal jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians in \\"Indian Country\\" to certain state governments. Previously, \\"Indian Country\\" was under the jurisdiction of the federal criminal code. Congress gave six states (California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Alaska) extensive authority to prosecute most crimes that occurred in Indian country. Between 1953 and 1968, numerous other states than the original six exercised expanded jurisdiction in Indian country. Not only did PL-280 strip the federal government of jurisdiction in Indian country, but it also nullified traditional tribal systems of internal justice.United States Attorney's Office of Minnesota, Public Law 208  Efforts towards repeal under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson  The United States government's policy of \\"termination\\" was met with staunch opposition from Indian populations. What had been initiated as an attempt at assimilation into American society had evolved into a systematic removal of Indian autonomy. Upon taking office in 1961, President Kennedy sought to gradually repeal the termination policy of the 1950s due to problems surrounding multiple ancestral land ownership patterns. President Kennedy scaled back the tenets of the termination era through a series of legislative actions.Reyser, Rudolph C., Indigenous Nations and Modern States The Political Emergence of Nations Challenging State Power, Routledge: NY, 2012, pp. 1-289, p. 58. * Public Law 87-273 approved on September 22, 1961 increased to $7,500,000 the annual authorization to carry out a vocational training program for American Indians residing on our near Indian reservation.JFK Presidential Library, Legislative Summary: Indians * Public Law 88-168 approved on November 4, 1963 to establish a $900,000 revolving loan fund for the Secretary of the Interior to make loans to Indian tribes for services of expert researchers and witnesses in prosecuting their cases before the Indian Claims Commission. * S. 1049 passed the Senate on October 11, 1963 to provide the Secretary of the Interior with the authority to reduce the rapidly increasing number of Indian allotments in multiple ownership. President Lyndon B. Johnson furthered Kennedy's efforts to end the policy of \\"termination.\\" In a landmark address to Congress on March 6, 1968, President Johnson emphasized the necessity of self- determination and improved living conditions for Indians in the United States.Lyndon B. Johnson: Special Message to the Congress on the Problems of the American Indian: \\"The Forgotten American.\\" March 6, 1968. The American Presidency Project. However, Johnson's program to provide Indians with equal standards of living to Americans quickly lost traction in Congress. Johnson's reform efforts did reap some substantial results. In 1968, the National Council on Indian Opportunity was established to encourage and coordinate the rise of Federal programs to benefit the American Indian population, appraise the impact and progress of such programs, and to suggest ways to improve the programs to meet the needs and desires of the Indian population. The National Council on Indian Opportunity was terminated in 1974.  The Nixon Years (1969‚Äì1974)   The Nixon Administration  Richard Nixon took office as president in 1969. It was under his administration that Senator Jackson and Forrest J. Gerard were most active in their reform efforts. The efforts of Jackson and Gerard mirrored the demands of Indians for \\"self-determination.\\" President Nixon called for an end to termination and provided a direct endorsement of \\"self-determination.\\"  Special message to Congress on Indian Affairs  In a 1970 address to Congress, President Nixon articulated his vision of self-determination. He explained, \\"The time has come to break decisively with the past and to create the conditions for a new era in which the Indian future is determined by Indian acts and Indian decisions.\\" Nixon continued, \\"This policy of forced termination is wrong, in my judgment, for a number of reasons. First, the premises on which it rests are wrong. Termination implies that the Federal government has taken on a trusteeship responsibility for Indian communities as an act of generosity toward a disadvantaged people and that it can therefore discontinue this responsibility on a unilateral basis whenever it sees fit.\\" Nixon's overt renunciation of the long-standing termination policy was the first of any President in the post World War II era.  Henry M. Jackson and Forrest J. Gerard  In 1971, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Chairman of the Interior and Insular Affairs, hired Forrest J. Gerard. Gerard was born on Montana's Blackfeet Reservation in 1925, served in the United States Air Force in World War II, and received a college education on the G.I. Bill of Rights. Following college, Gerard worked for agencies in Montana and Wyoming before moving to Washington, D.C. to work for the Indian Health Service. Eventually, Gerard would work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Health and Human Services. Gerard would provide Jackson with the experience and network of relationships with tribal leaders necessary for serious policy reform. Together, Jackson and Gerard worked hard to put the policies of self-determination outlined by Kennedy and Johnson into action. Beginning with Jackson's call for a Senate resolution to reverse House Concurrent Resolution 108, they embarked on an ambitious legislative agenda to reform Indian affairs in the United States. The legislation regarding Indian Affairs that bears the authorship of Senator Jackson and Gerard, and the sponsorship of Senator Jackson includes: * Senate Concurrent Resolution 26, enacted in 1971 to reverse the federal policy of termination and develop a government-wide commitment to enable Indians to determine their own future, protect Indian property and identity, raise the social and economic level of Indians, and assist urban Indians. * Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), enacted in 1976 to address the deplorable living conditions in Indian Country. * Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, enacted in 1975, it authorized the Secretaries of the Interior, Health, and Education to enter into contracts under which the tribes themselves would assume responsibility for the administration of federal Indian programs. * Sub-Marginal Lands Act, enacted in 1975 to declare that certain submarginal land of the United States, purchased in the 1930s, be held in trust for certain Indian tribes and be made a part of the reservation for said Indians. * Indian Finance Act, passed in 1975 with the sponsorship of Senator Jackson, was a proposal of President Nixon's to lend money to tribes via a revolving fund.  Alaskan Native claims  In 1959, Alaska became the 49th U.S. state. However, prior to and after the passage of the Alaska Statehood Act, indigenous claims were seen as contrary to goals of development. The 1968 discovery of North Slope oil was a dramatic development that demanded immediate conflict resolution over Indian land claims. However, the Alaska Statehood Act provided the new State with the entitlement to pursue land grants. Furthermore, the state and federal government embarked on a project to create a pipeline to transport oil from the North Slope fields. The vast majority of Alaskan Natives did not live on reservations but rather in scattered villages. As the State of Alaska began to select lands pursuant to the Statehood Act, native villages protested to the Secretary of the Interior that the lands chosen were occupied and used for aboriginal purposes. Senator Jackson desired an immediate resolution to the issue of land claims. In 1966, the Alaskan Federation of Natives (AFN) was formed. Composed of 400 Alaskan Natives representing 17 Native organizations, the AFN would work to achieve the passage of a just and fair land settlement. Natives who were younger and more educated formed the core of the AFN leadership, and they desired to keep a portion of their aboriginal lands. In 1968, Senator Jackson traveled to Anchorage for a public hearing with AFN members and the Native community. Ultimately, Senator Jackson concluded that land grants and trusteeship would not be enough for native leadership. In response, Congress presented the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). The ANCSA was designed to rectify disproportionate State land claims by transferring land titles to twelve Alaska Native regional corporations and over 200 local village corporations. True to his commitment to \\"self-determination\\", prior to signing the ANCSA into law in 1971, President Nixon sought to ensure that the measure was supported by the AFN.  American Indian protest movements  The late 1960s were not only a time of tremendous policy change in regard to American Indians, but also a period of tremendous advocacy. Mirroring the Civil Rights Movement, protests against the Vietnam War, and the greater counterculture movement as a whole, American Indian protests movements blossomed during this decade.  The occupation of Alcatraz Island  Although Nixon was responsible for the direction of his Indian policy, the implementation and specifics were largely carried out by subordinates and White House staff members. However, in 1969, Nixon was forced to involve himself in an unforeseen crisis. In an effort to protest a policy of terminating Indian reservations and relocating inhabitants to urban areas, a group of American Indians boated to the abandoned island of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay. The occupiers, calling themselves \\"Indians of All Tribes,\\" were led by Richard Oakes, a Native American and student at San Francisco State College. The vast majority of his companions were Native American college students. The White House refused to cave to the protesters but would not forcibly remove them either. Rather, the Nixon Administration sought to respond through increased reform efforts in regard to Indian policy. The occupation lasted until 1971. In that time period, President Nixon signed 52 Congressional legislative measures on behalf of American Indians to support tribal self-rule. In addition, President Nixon increased the BIA budget by 225 percent, doubled funds for Indian health care, and established the Office of Indian Water Rights. However, the primary concerns of the \\"Indians of All Tribes\\" were not addressed. The administration insisted that urban Indians form federally- recognized tribes, and use regular social service from the state and local agencies, not the BIA. President Nixon's inability to effectively reform the BIA would result in increased Indian activism and protest.  Standoff at Wounded Knee  The policy of President Nixon created a schism among Indian leadership. Radical urban groups such as the American Indian Movement (AIM) actively opposed the BIA. In 1972, AIM members occupied the BIA building in Washington, D.C. Once more showing the restraint of Alcatraz, the Nixon Administration negotiated with the AIM for their peaceful departure. The elected tribal leaders disagreed with the tactics of civil disobedience employed by AIM. They viewed AIM as a destructive organization, while AIM perceived tribal leaders as weak and unfit to provide substantial change. This conflict came to a head in 1973 when 200 members of AIM converged on Wounded Knee at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. The conflict at Wounded Knee led to the impeachment of the Oglala Lakota (Sioux) tribal chairman, Richard Wilson, who was considered corrupt by many elders and traditional members of the tribe, including those associated with AIM. Furthermore, AIM leaders disliked the existing tribal government because it had been established under the IRA of 1934. AIM took Wounded Knee at gunpoint and proclaimed an independent Sioux nation. In response, Richard Wilson threatened to invade Wounded Knee and violently eject all AIM members. U.S. Marshals, FBI agents, and BIA police were deployed to Pine Ridge Reservation to defuse the situation. However, the standoff would continue for another three months until negotiations between President Nixon's representative, Leonard Garment, and AIM leaders, Dennis Banks and Carter Camp, reached an agreement. The occupiers surrendered their arms in exchange for an investigation of Wilson's management of the Pine Ridge Reservation. Once more, the Nixon Administration had used restraint and patience in a potentially violent situation. The Nixon Administration hardened its policy toward AIM in the wake of the standoff at Wounded Knee. At the same time, Nixon's relative progressivism toward Indian affairs became stronger. Between 1973 and 1975, Congress, with the help of Senator Henry M. Jackson, passed a series of monumental reforms to U.S. Indian Policy.

This episode centers around Ursula, and her acceptance of Hook's offer in order to get her happy ending, while flashbacks show Ursula's past with Hook. Plot Opening Sequence Ursula makes an appearance in the forest. In the Characters' Past In the Neverland realm, Hook and his crew hear a mermaid‚Äôs song, which distracts them until they almost strike a series of rocks. Around the same time, the father of the Seas, Poseidon, scolds his daughter, revealed to be Ursula in her youth, for ending the song just in time for the Jolly Roger to escape. Later on at a tavern during a port stop, Hook recognizes the same tune being sung by Ursula, and offers her a drink. She explains to Hook that her father kicked her out of his kingdom for disobeying him, so she stole a magical bracelet that allowed her to walk on land. Ursula also reveals that her mother was killed by a pirate, which is why Poseidon demands Ursula use her voice - the only thing that reminds her of her mother - to steer the ships awry. Hook tells Ursula that listening to her voice was the only thing that has ever taken away his lifelong pain. She shares her plan to sing in Glowerhaven, and he offers to take her there on his ship. Poseidon learns of this and instructs Hook to remove Ursula's ability to sing by using a seashell, in order to ensure that she will never leave the ocean, in exchange for giving Hook a vial of squid ink, which Hook can use to paralyze his enemy Rumplestiltskin. Later, Hook returns and tells Ursula about her father‚Äôs plan. Although he refuses to break his personal code, Hook asks Ursula to steal the squid ink from her father‚Äôs storage. Ursula agrees, only to have Poseidon catch her, and in return for Hook betraying him, takes away his only chance to seek revenge on Rumplestiltskin. Hook then counters by stealing Ursula‚Äôs singing voice to hurt Poseidon. After Hook leaves with Ursula's singing voice, the rift between father and daughter continues, prompting an enraged Ursula to snap and use Poseidon‚Äôs trident to transform herself into the powerful sea goddess for which Ursula was named after, only stronger and more powerful than her father. In Storybrooke At Gold's remote cabin, Regina, Maleficent, Cruella, and Ursula start interrogating adult August Booth about the Author. He explains that he stole the research of a man in Hong Kong named The Dragon, and that the research is still currently in Storybrooke. Gold heads to August's trailer to get the research, and Regina uses her magic to briefly take over Mary Margaret‚Äôs body to tell Emma Swan, Captain Hook, and David Nolan that August is safe, Gold is back, and the Queens have something big planned. They later relay this to Belle, who tells them that she gave the Dagger to Hook, only to learn that Gold transformed himself into Hook to retrieve it, leading them to discover that Gold has restored his powers once again with the dagger. This information gives Hook an idea as he reveals his past encounter with Ursula, saying that the time has now come to take advantage of the Sea Goddess and to restore her happy ending. Later, Hook uses a conch shell to summon Ursula and he offers her a deal: in exchange for finding out Gold's plan involving the Author, Hook will return her voice. When Ursula asks Hook where the magical shell is, he responds that it is located inside the Jolly Roger back in the Enchanted Forest. Ursula opens a portal into the Jolly Roger, which has been turned into a model ship in a bottle. Hook and Ursula, with help from Will Scarlet, restore the Jolly Roger. Hook gathers the shell with Ursula‚Äôs voice and returns it to her, but the magic does not work and her voice does not return. A furious Ursula then takes her revenge out on Hook by saying that the deal is over, and uses her tentacles to send Hook overboard. He is rescued by Ariel, who explains that Blackbeard used the Jolly Roger to terrorize people, including Anna and Kristoff from Arendelle, so Queen Elsa contained the ship in a bottle, accidentally trapping Ariel as well, and thanks to Hook, Ariel is now free and repays him with a favor. Regina is still trying to control her feelings for Robin Hood, and has a nightmare in which she fights the \\"Evil Queen\\" version of herself over the affections of her former love. Gold suddenly returns from August's trailer to inform her that August lied about The Dragon. He feeds August a temporary, painful potion that turns August back into wood and causes his nose to grow every time he lies, and holds August's nose to the fire. August says that the Sorcerer trapped the Author behind a door but he does not know where the door is, except that it is in Storybrooke and that Regina has seen it before in one of the pages. Gold, Regina, and Maleficent head to the Sorcerer's mansion to look for the door. Moments later, Emma, Mary Margaret, and David break into Gold‚Äôs cabin and knock out Cruella. They are then surprised by Ursula, who briefly uses her tentacles to strangle Mary Margaret before being surprised by Hook, who tells Ursula that only the person who enchanted the shell can reverse it. Poseidon appears, having been brought through a portal by Ariel. Poseidon apologizes to his daughter for everything, and returns her singing voice so that he can hear the voice of his wife one last time. After Ursula and Poseidon are reunited and leave, Hook tells Emma that his happy ending is to be with her, but he fears he will lose her because he is a villain. August is rescued but Cruella has escaped, and later meets up with Gold, Regina, and Maleficent, saying that Ursula was a mole, much to Regina‚Äôs relief. Hook learns from Ursula about Gold's plans, revealing that as long as Emma is in Storybrooke to give everyone their happy endings, the Author will be unable to give villains theirs, and the only way to change that is for Gold to fill Emma‚Äôs heart with darkness. At the same time, Regina meets with Emma to ask her if she can help track down Robin Hood and later asks August about the door; August says that the picture of the door is not just an illustration, but is the door itself. The Author is actually trapped inside the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" book. Cultural references *The episode is named after a song from the Disney film The Little Mermaid. *Ursula's backstory is largely based on Ariel's backstory from the Disney film, The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning. *Ursula vocalizes the reprise of \\"Part of Your World\\" and sings \\"Fathoms Below\\" during the episode. Both are from the Disney film The Little Mermaid. *The town Ursula wishes to travel to, Glowerhaven, was mentioned in the Disney film The Little Mermaid as the home of a princess that Grimsby had introduced Prince Eric to. Reception Ratings The episode drew a 1.8/9 rating among 18-49s, with 5.69 million viewers, which remained steady from the previous outing, but remained the most-watched scripted show of the night. Reviews The episode was met with positive reviews. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN said of the episode, \\"Once Upon a Time has reversed or otherwise twisted existing Disney backstories for the series and even used elements from one character's past for another character (Rumplestiltskin is both the Crocodile and the Beast), but what they did with Ursula was different. The core of her origin was diluted by The Little Mermaid touches. And even if those touches were chosen because they softened the character, it was still too much of a tie to Ariel.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode a 7.3 rating out of 10. Hilary Busis of Entertainment Weekly responded to the episode with, \\"And then there were two? By that, of course, I‚Äôm referring to the Queens of Darkness‚Äîan exclusive club that may have just become a duo (plus or minus a double-crossing Regina), now that Ursula has apparently achieved her happy ending. (Inasmuch as it‚Äôs possible for a villain to achieve a happy ending in Once‚Äôs universe, given what we learned at the end of tonight‚Äôs episode.)

Medical professionals say that because the \\"daughter from California\\" has been absent from the life and care of the elderly patient, they are frequently surprised by the scale of the patient's deterioration, and may have unrealistic expectations about what is medically feasible. They may feel guilty about having been absent, and may therefore feel motivated to reassert their role as an involved caregiver. The phrase was first documented by David Molloy and other gerontologists in a 1991 case report published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, titled \\"Decision Making in the Incompetent Elderly: 'The Daughter from California Syndrome'\\". In the paper, Molloy and colleagues presented strategies intended to help medical staff deal with the difficult family members of mentally incompetent patients. In California, the \\"daughter from California\\" is known as the \\"daughter from New York\\".

The freeway would have run parallel to a section of Mercer Street between Interstate 5 (I-5) and Aurora Avenue North at the Seattle Center. Planning for the freeway began in 1954, with the proposal for a freeway from Elliott Bay to the Central Freeway, later I-5, via Broad and Mercer streets added to the city's comprehensive plan in 1957. Funded by a bond measure passed by Seattle voters in 1960, plans were drawn for the newly renamed Bay Freeway to serve a multi-purpose stadium at the Seattle Center via an elevated structure. Citizen groups voiced their opposition to the project at public hearings in 1967, forcing the Seattle Engineering Department to consider other designs. After determining that a cut-and-cover tunnel would not be feasible, a second series of public hearings to discuss the impact of an elevated option were held in 1970, leading to widespread controversy and a civil suit launched in opposition to the freeway. The lawsuit ended in November 1971, with a King County Superior Court judge ruling that a major deviation from the voter- approved 1960 plan occurred, forcing a referendum to be held on whether to continue the project. On February 8, 1972, the Bay Freeway project was rejected by a 10,000-vote margin in a municipal referendum, alongside the repeal of the R.H. Thomson Expressway. Mercer Street would later undergo several projects that attempted to provide congestion relief promised by the rejected freeway, culminating in the Mercer Corridor Project in 2012, which widened the street into a boulevard. Route description I-5's interchange with Mercer Street, the proposed eastern terminus of the Bay Freeway, under construction in 1962 The Bay Freeway, as proposed in 1972, would have been a six-lane elevated freeway on a curved box-beam bridge, measuring at its widest point. The freeway would have begun at the Seattle Center in Lower Queen Anne, as through lanes for Broad Street under Aurora Avenue North. The roadway would have immediately merged with ramps connecting to the Roy and Mercer couplet and to a parking garage for a multipurpose domed stadium, later relocated and built south of Downtown in 1976, to form the Bay Freeway. The lanes then would have then turned southeastward next to a park on Lake Union, passing only over Westlake Avenue North and over Fairview Avenue North, before splitting into ramps at an interchange with I-5. Valley Street, located north of the planned right-of-way, was to be moved under the Bay Freeway structure and replaced with additional park space. Earlier plans called for an extension traveling southwest on Broad Street through Belltown, including a tunnel between 5th Avenue and Denny Way, to the proposed Northwest Expressway and an extension of the existing Alaskan Way Viaduct on the Elliott Bay waterfront. The extension was deferred in 1969, but remained a \\"possible future plan\\" until the entire project was canceled. History Mercer Street expansion The City of Seattle began planning for the Bay Freeway in 1954, with planning studies determining that Broad and Mercer streets should become the northern east‚Äìwest link of the proposed Downtown freeway system. The Seattle City Council adopted the city's comprehensive plan in 1957, proposing a \\"major highway\\" in the vicinity of Broad and Mercer streets from the Northwest Expressway along Elliott Bay to the Central Freeway at the foot of Capitol Hill. In anticipation of the Bay Freeway, underpasses of Aurora Avenue North on Broad and Mercer streets were completed in July 1958, using funds from a 1954 bond issue for the construction of arterial roadways. A special municipal election concerning a $26.6 million bond measure for traffic improvement was held on March 8, 1960, passed by 71,000 of 109,000 voters in King County. The funds, matched by $31 million from the State of Washington and federal government, were distributed to 12 projects from the Comprehensive Plan of 1957, including $1.9 million for the \\"Mercer Street Connection\\" between Aurora Avenue and the Central Freeway. The Century 21 Exposition was hosted at the Seattle Center grounds from April to October 1962, generating heavy traffic equivalent to rush hour loads on Mercer Street, where a city-owned, 1,500-stall parking garage was located. The use of Mercer Street as one of the primary routes to the fairgrounds and its selection as one of the sites for a proposed multi- purpose stadium convinced city officials that the construction of the Bay Freeway was a necessity. The Mercer exit on I-5 was partially opened in November 1963, with the northbound ramps open to traffic and the southbound ramps remaining closed until 1968. A design team led by Perry Johanson was formed in 1966 for the Bay Freeway project, intending to blend the freeway with its surroundings and encourage mixed-use development to lower its impact on the South Lake Union neighborhood. The first public hearing on the project was held by the Seattle City Council on February 17, 1967, where City Engineer Roy Morse said that the \\"Mercer mess\\" would be solved with the opening of the Bay Freeway in 1969. The three proposed elevated alternatives were criticized by the public and local architects Ibsen Nelsen and Victor Steinbrueck for blocking views of Lake Union, forcing Morse to reconsider subsurface designs despite his declaration that \\"a depressed roadway with the freeway would require excessively steep traffic grades\\". Freeway proposals A map of the elevated option for the Bay Freeway, subject to public hearings in 1970 The project was officially designated the \\"Bay Freeway\\" by the Seattle City Council on April 12, 1967, as part of an ordinance that also renamed part of State Route 99 to the Alaskan Freeway and officially named the proposed R.H. Thomson Expressway as the Thomson Freeway. During the second public hearing, held on June 23, the city council endorsed the $5 million elevated option for the Bay Freeway amid appeals from local architects and the Citizens Planning Council. Among the 16 proposals considered, a cut and cover tunnel was rejected because of its $16 million cost, steep grades and larger disruption of local businesses and railroads. The Seattle Center was selected as the preferred site of the multi-purpose domed stadium in 1968, assuming that the Bay Freeway was built to prevent event congestion, forcing the project to be redesigned for the next two years. The design report for the Bay Freeway project was published on February 10, 1970, and was subsequently distributed to the project. The report featured a new design for the freeway, including ramps to a parking garage serving the domed stadium and aesthetic standards meant to complement the existing Seattle Center. Five additional public hearings were held by the Seattle City Council in 1970, as support for the R.H. Thomson Expressway and other proposed freeways were the subject of highway revolts similar to those in other American cities. During the April hearing, former State Department of Highways director Charles Prahl spoke out against the Bay Freeway and predicted that it would cause traffic to back up onto I-5 during rush hour. Voters rejected a Forward Thrust initiative that would have built the proposed domed stadium at the Seattle Center on May 19, removing one of the main reasons to build the freeway and forcing the city council to consider scaling down the proposal. The June hearing resulted in the removal of the R.H. Thomson Freeway from the comprehensive plan as well as the widening of the Bay Freeway to six lanes to support an expected 2,610 drivers during rush hour. The city council approved the $28 million Bay Freeway proposal, to be matched by an additional $28 million from the federal government, by a 5‚Äì3 vote on December 21, 1970. Right of way acquisition began the following March, with $6 million appropriated to purchase and condemn properties on seven blocks between Mercer and Valley streets. Civil suit and special election A model of the elevated Bay Freeway option produced for a public hearing The 6-lane proposal caused several opposition groups, led by the Citizens Against R.H. Thomson (CARHT), to launch a civil suit to halt further planning for the Bay Freeway. The two citizens groups opposed what they claimed was improper planning and financing, described as \\"a series of shortcut procedures and hearings to give the design rubber-stamp approval\\", and that the project did not conform to the voter-approved 1960 proposal for a \\"Mercer Street Connection\\". CARHT was named the plaintiff in the case, using funds largely from an anonymous single donor that were originally meant for opposing the R.H. Thomson Expressway. On November 3, 1971, King County Superior Court Judge Solie M. Ringold ruled in favor of the opposition and prohibited the city from moving forward with the Bay Freeway project, citing that it had deviated significantly from the voter-approved 1960 proposal; the estimated cost of the project rose to $28 million, a seven-fold increase from 1960's figures. The city was allowed to reconsider plans and submit a new proposal for voter approval. The Council Committee of the Whole unanimously voted the following month to hold a special referendum seeking approval of the Bay Freeway, as well as endorsement of the city council's decision to cancel the R.H. Thomson Expressway, scheduled for February 8, 1972. The final environmental impact statement for the project was published by the City of Seattle Department of Engineering on January 24, 1972, two weeks before the election. It included three alternatives, all elevated between Valley and Mercer streets from Aurora Avenue to I-5. Construction would begin the following spring, with a completion date in early 1975. A rapid transit alternative was deemed \\"not probable in the near future\\" for the corridor, though express bus service was considered. A depressed roadway was rejected outright, as it could only achieve a grade of 6% at , required a larger amount of right-of-way acquisition and relocation of utilities, and it was located below the water table, making it too expensive to be feasible. Referendum 1, which sought approval of the Bay Freeway, was rejected by a margin of 52,748 to 42,502 on February 8, 1972, effectively cancelling the project. In the aftermath of the vote, opponents of the project urged the city council to look into alternate solutions for the \\"Mercer Street mess\\". The Seattle City Council officially terminated the Bay Freeway project by passing an ordinance on May 1, 1972, to halt condemnation proceedings related to properties in the freeway's proposed corridor. Aftermath and subsequent proposals Westbound Mercer Street, viewed from near the I-5 interchange, after its reconfiguration for two-way traffic in 2012 As a result of the vote in February 1972, the State Highway Department transferred $5.7 million in trust funds meant for the Bay Freeway to expanding U.S. Route 195 between Spokane and Pullman in Eastern Washington. State Highway Director George H. Andrews warned that the dual cancellation of the Bay Freeway and R.H. Thomson Expressway, the latter having been defeated on the same day, would overload I-5 far beyond its design capacity, particularly in serving freight traffic near the Industrial District. Seattle Mayor Wes Uhlman predicted that congestion on Mercer Street would continue to worsen, stating that \\"there is no real alternative to the Bay Freeway\\", criticizing the rejection as a part of a \\"nationwide reaction to freeways and concrete\\". Mercer Street had previously been split into a couplet, with westbound traffic diverted to Valley Street one block north, as a temporary solution to Seattle Center congestion in 1968. Between then and 1990, the city of Seattle has had 58 studies proposing various methods of reducing congestion on Mercer Street, all of them rejected by the Seattle City Council. Among the most notable proposals include a four-block, $100 million tunnel that was supported by Mayor Charles Royer in the late 1980s, and the \\"Broad Street Throughway\\" plan to lower Broad and Mercer streets and add a park lid at the south end of Lake Union. The failed Seattle Commons levy, which proposed building a urban park in the South Lake Union neighborhood in 1995, included plans for a below-grade freeway along Mercer Street estimated to cost $93.8 million. The Seattle Department of Transportation secured $190.5 million in early 2010 to fund its \\"Mercer Corridor Project\\", which proposed improving traffic flow by restoring westbound lanes on Mercer Street. A groundbreaking ceremony was held the following September, with construction on the project starting shortly thereafter, hoping to reduce congestion on Mercer Street. After two years of construction, the expanded six-lane Mercer Street opened to traffic on August 27, 2012, allowing for two-way traffic between Dexter Avenue North and I-5 to be carried by Mercer Street for the first time in 44 years. The two-way segment was extended west to 9th Avenue North on May 30, 2014, removing the final section of one-way traffic on Mercer Street, while also permanently closing Broad Street in preparation for the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel project.

She married a well-off husband who supported her while she worked as a midwife's assistant in Paris. She decided to avoid politics and religion and to focus on specific and practical feminist goals. She led a successful campaign to change the laws so women could legally bear witness and could control their own earnings. She launched the French Union for Women's Suffrage to campaign for the right of women to vote, but that was not achieved in her lifetime. Early years Jeanne Elizabeth Archer was born in Great Britain in 1846. Her father was English and her mother French. Her father was a lieutenant in the British Navy. She studied medicine in Edinburgh, but was not able to complete her course. Sophia Jex-Blake was trying to open the profession to women but had not yet succeeded. Schmahl was a friend of Jex- Blake, and in contact with the feminist movement in England. She went to France to continue her medical studies, but interrupted them when she married Henri Schmahl, a Frenchman from Alsace, and took the name of Jeanne Schmahl. However, she acted as an assistant to professional midwives until 1893. She became a French citizen in 1873 through her marriage. She was supported by her husband and lived in comfort beside the Parc Montsouris. Women's rights to witness and dispose of income By 1878 Jeanne Schmahl had become active in groups led by Maria Deraismes and the pastor Tommy Fallot. She joined the League for Raising Public Morality (Ligue pour le rel√®vement de la moralit√© publique), which was mainly concerned with making alcohol and pornography illegal. Schmahl joined L√©on Richer's group after she became interested in women's rights. Schmahl also joined the Society for the Amelioration of Woman's Condition which had been created by Maria Deraismes. Schmahl was incensed when she discovered that a woman had been dismissed from her job after she asked her employer not to give her wages to her alcoholic spouse. Schmahl admired the British Married Women's Property Act 1882 and she believed a similar law would benefit French women. Schmahl thought that the strategy of the groups, led by Richer and Deraismes, of mixing religion and politics with women's issues was a mistake. She thought this was \\"one of the great reasons for the movement's lack of success in France.\\" She decided to instead direct her efforts at specific issues. In January 1893 Schmahl founded the Avant- Courri√®re (Forerunner) association, which called for the right of women to be witnesses in public and private acts, and for the right of married women to take the product of their labor and dispose of it freely. As Schmahl wrote in 1896, Jeanne Schmahl in 1895 The campaign aimed to mobilize middle- and upper- class women who had moderate and conservative views. Anne de Rochechouart de Mortemart (1847‚Äì1933), Duchess of Uz√®s and Juliette Adam (1836‚Äì1936) soon joined the Avant-Courri√®re, and Schmahl found support from Jane Misme (1865‚Äì1935), who later founded the journal La Fran√ßaise and Jeanne Chauvin (1862‚Äì1926), the first woman to become a doctor of law. Schmahl published a journal, L'Avant-Courri√®re. The society grew to 200 members. The Avant- Courri√®re managed to get the support of printing houses who printed posters at no charge for display across Paris and in major provincial cities. The law to allow women to bear witness passed the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate in 1897. The Chamber of Deputies passed the earnings bill in 1896. The Senate stalled on this bill, and it was not until July 1907 that it finally approved a version of the act. Schmahl then dissolved the l'Avant-Courri√®re, which had achieved its goals. The 1907 Married Woman's Earnings Act was often called the \\"Schmahl Law\\". The Act was incomplete. If a woman bought something with her earnings that she did not consume herself, such as a piece of furniture, it became her husband's property unless there was a marriage contract that specified otherwise. This would normally only be the case with prosperous couples. Women's suffrage Jeanne Schmahl visiting the French Premier Aristide Briand in 1909 The French Union for Women's Suffrage (UFSF: Union fran√ßaise pour le suffrage des femmes) was founded by a group of feminists who had attended a national congress of French feminists in Paris in 1908. Most of them were from bourgeois or intellectual backgrounds. The leaders were Jeanne Schmahl and Jane Misme. Since 1901 Schmahl had belonged to the Women's Suffrage (Suffrage des femmes) association led by Hubertine Auclert (1848‚Äì1914). The UFSF provided a less militant and more widely acceptable alternative to Suffrage des femmes. The sole objective, as published in La Fran√ßaise early in 1909, was to obtain women's suffrage through legal approaches. The founding meeting of 300 women was held in February 1909. C√©cile Brunschvicg (1877‚Äì1946) was made secretary-general. Schmahl was the first president. Eliska Vincent accepted the position of honorary vice- president. The UFSF was formally recognized by the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWFA) congress in London in April 1909 as representing the French suffrage movement. Although national in scope, the UFSF was very much Paris-based. Schmahl stated that the campaign would be peaceable, and would start by asking for women to be able to vote in municipal elections and sit on municipal councils. Schmahl resigned from the UFSF in 1911 due to disputes with C√©cile Brunschvicg, although the reason given was health problems. She was succeeded as UFSF president first by Eliska Vincent and then by Marguerite de Witt-Schlumberger, Jane Misme stayed with the UFSF, which had 12,000 members by 1914.

The specific epithet ' is from the Latin, meaning \\"of Java\\". Other common names in English include Java brucea and kosam. Description Brucea javanica grows up as a shrub or small tree to tall. The tiny flowers (1.5--2 mm in diameter) are greenish white to greenish red or purple and occur in panicles. There are separate male and female flowers on each shrub, making it a monoecious species. The flower anthers are typically red. It typically flowers in June and July and sets fruit in July and August. Each fruit, which are a drupe, measures up to long. When ripe they are a black-gray color that becomes wrinkled when dry. The seed is whitish yellow and covered with an oily membrane. It has compound leaves with typically 7--9 (but range from 3--15) ovate to ovate-lanceolate leaflets with serrate margins. Each leaflet is 20‚Äì40 cm long at maturity and comes to a point at the apex. The leaves are covered with fine hairs that are most prominent at the veins and on the undersides of the leaves. All parts of the plant are intensely bitter. Distribution and habitat Brucea javanica grows naturally from Sri Lanka and India to China, Indochina, Malesia, New Guinea and Australia. Its habitat includes open areas, secondary forest and sometimes sand dunes. In Australia it grows as an understory tree from sea-level to altitude. Medicinal use The fruit Brucea javanica was first written about as medicine in the Chinese medical monograph Omissions from the Grand Materia Medica, written in 1765. It contains quassinoid compounds called bruceolides that are anticancer and antiparasitic. It is traditionally used to treat dysentery and malaria, though no clinical trials have been published confirming efficacy for these conditions despite test tube studies repeatedly showing anti-malarial activity. An injectable oil emulsion form of the plant has been studied in China in controlled trials for treating lung cancer patients combined with chemotherapy, with promising results. More high-quality trials are needed to confirm this use.

He holds an LLB & BA from Auckland University, and practices as a Barrister of the High Court of New Zealand; his practice covers civil and criminal matters. He is regarded as an expert on Human Rights Law. Shaw has appeared widely in the District and High Courts of New Zealand including successful appeals to the Court of Appeal, Privy Council and the New Zealand Supreme Court. Shaw has also appeared in the Employment Court of New Zealand and regularly appears before the New Zealand Parole Board. Biography Shaw is one of only five barristers who between the years 1848 and 2014 successfully argued a case before the Privy Council in relation to a New Zealand criminal matter \\\\- see: (R v Taito -Privy Council 2002)(R v Taito [2002] 3 NZLR 577, 6 HRNZ 539 (Privy Council 2002) \\\\- (The Supreme Court replaced the Privy Council as the final Appellate body in 2004). Likewise Shaw along with fellow Barrister Greg King also share the distinction of being the first to win a criminal case before the new Supreme Court of New Zealand - see: (Timoti v Queen - SC 2005). In 2010, Shaw successfully represented Flag Burner Valerie Morse in the Supreme Court where her conviction for disorderly behavior was quashed. In the same year Shaw represented one of the Waihopai GCSB Spy Base Protesters, they were acquitted at their trial despite their admissions that they had broken into the spy base. Shaw also represented New Zealand's only ever airline high-jacker Asha Ali Abdille who ultimately pleaded guilty to hijacking Eagle Airways Flight 2279. In 2008 Shaw represented Once Were Warriors Author Alan Duff MBE when he was acquitted of failing to remain with a Police Officer when he was pulled over for speeding, and in 2005 Farmer Paul McIntyre who was acquitted of illegally firing a firearm at thieves who were stealing his farm bike. Shaw also represented the successful Plaintiff in the often referenced \\"Baigents Case\\", the case famously created a new cause of action for monetary compensation following breaches of the Bill of Rights. He is the co-author of several books and papers, including books published by Legal Publisher Thomson Reuters and The Oxford University Press., Recent cases Marteley v The Legal Services Commissioner - (Supreme Court)https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/pdf/jdo/fa/alfresco/service/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/4717dca6-8532-4ba4-90b6-b56d45ad296a/4717dca6-8532-4ba4-90b6-b56d45ad296a.pdf Shaw together with fellow Barrister Dr Tony Ellis, successfully appealed a decision of the Court of Appeal where the Plaintiff had been refused Legal Aid to appeal against his conviction for murder. The Supreme Court's decision granted Legal Aid to the Plaintiff (to appeal his conviction) and awarded costs to the Plaintiff of $25,000 and additional general costs and disbursements. The Court created a benchmark and identified [at paragraph 55 of its decision] what it regarded would now be the 7 \\"critical considerations\\" for a grant of Legal Aid. Liston-Llyod v The Commissioner of Police - (High Court)https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/pdf/jdo/ce/alfresco/service/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/eb895e55-282a-48a8-a188-8a9a7824dff3/eb895e55-282a-48a8-a188-8a9a7824dff3.pdf Shaw successfully represented the Plaintiff in a Judicial Review of the Police's decision to improperly take DNA from the Plaintiff. The decision required the Police to pay compensation to Plaintiff and ordered that the DNA sample be destroyed.  Cases of interest   Ministry of Transport v Noort - Court of Appeal 1991  In 1991, Shaw successfully represented a Mr Noort in the Court of Appeal (Ministry of Transport v Noort [1992] 3 NZLR 260, 268 (CA) Cooke P.).(Ministry of Transport v Noort [1992] 3 NZLR 260, 268 (CA) Cooke P Mr. Noort had been stopped by the Ministry of Transport (now the Police) and voluntarily submitted to an Alcohol Breath Test which showed he was in excess of the requisite level. Mr Noort was not given the opportunity to consult a lawyer. The Court of Appeal found that this had breached Mr. Noorts rights. The Court determined that when a Court finds that evidence was obtained through a breach of someone‚Äôs rights then prima facie the remedy was exclusion of that evidence. Accordingly, the evidence of the excess Breath Alcohol Test was thrown out. Mr. Noort was then acquitted. This benchmark case, led by Shaw, changed the way Police (then the Ministry of Transport) dealt with alleged offenders and created the necessity for an alleged offender to be told that they had a right to consult a lawyer. It also confirmed the position that the New Zealand Bill of Rights (1990) took precedence over any other enactment, and that evidence obtained in breach of someone‚Äôs rights ought to be thrown out. This case is regarded as an important decision and is extensively referred to in cases and texts including references created by the New Zealand Law Commission and numerous decisions of the Courts of New Zealand.  R v Goodwin (No.2) - Court of Appeal 1993  In 1993, Shaw and fellow Barrister Michael (Mike) Bungay successfully represented the Appellant Goodwin in a Court of Appeal case known as R v Goodwin (No.2). This case is now regarded by the New Zealand Justice Department as the leading (key) case in relation to the Rights of Persons arrested (Pursuant to the New Zealand Bill of Rights). It is referred to in numerous decisions and law texts in New Zealand and overseas including Cambridge University‚Äôs Constitutional Law in the United Kingdom ‚Äì Practice and Principles. The decision of Goodwin set forth the correct procedure for legal representation, and the effect of improper procedure on evidence and ultimately conviction.  Simpson v The Attorney General (also known as the Baigents case) - Court of Appeal 1994  In 1994 Shaw successfully represented the Plaintiff Mr. Simpson in (Simpson v Attorney-General [1994] 3 NZLR 667) which if often referred to as \\"The Baigents case\\" The Plaintiffs alleged that police officers had persisted in bad faith with the search of the late Mrs. Baigent's house (when they knew that her property had been mistakenly named in a search warrant) The search warrant had been issued for a drug dealers' house. The Plaintiffs sued on the grounds the police breached the Bill of Rights' Act - i.e. the right to be secure against unreasonable search and arrest. The Court of Appeal found that whilst the Bill of Rights did not include specific remedies for a breach of a Section the Act it has to be read in conjunction with New Zealand‚Äôs obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This decision was regarded as ground breaking and created new law, as it created a new civil cause of action (claim for monetary compensation) when someone‚Äôs rights were breached.Simpson v. Attorney General [1994] 3 NZLR 667 R v Taito - Privy Council 2002 In 2002 at the Privy Council Shaw and fellow barrister Tony Ellis successfully represented 12 clients who had been convicted of various criminal offences (R v Taito [2002] 3 NZLR 577, 6 HRNZ 539 (Privy Council 2002). The Privy Council found for Shaw and Ellis‚Äôs clients and struck down the way the New Zealand Court of Appeal was dealing with criminal appeals where legal aid was refused. The Privy Council ordered new appeals for the 12 with an order that their clients be granted appeals and that they be legally aided. The New Zealand Herald reported at the time that then Member of Parliament (and now a New Zealand Cabinet Minister), Dr Wayne Mapp (who was also a former associate professor of law) said ‚Äúthe decision was a \\"clear warning shot\\" to the Government. \\"This is the Privy Council saying that the criminal appeals system operated by the Court of Appeal was 'unlawful',\\" he said. The Privy Council since 1848 only granted leave to hear 8 New Zealand criminal appeals. Shaw became one of only 5 Barristers who have ever successfully argued a New Zealand Criminal matter before the Privy Council. Timoti v Queen - Supreme Court 2005 In 2005, and flowing from the successful decision of the Privy Council in R v Taito [2002] 3 NZLR 577, 6 HRNZ 539 (Privy Council 2002), Shaw along with fellow Barristers Greg King and Catherine Milnes successfully appealed in the Supreme Court the 1999 Murder conviction of Aerengaroa Timoti. Timoti was 23 when he was convicted of Murder for setting fire to his mother's Mt Roskill house while five people were inside (for which he was serving a life sentence). The appeal focused on the partial defence of provocation (pursuant to then section 169 of the Crimes Act 1961) relating to a falling out between Timoti and his father prior to him setting alight to the house. The Supreme Court held that Timoti was provoked \\"sufficient to deprive a person having the power of self-control of an ordinary person, but otherwise having the characteristics of the accused...\\", therefore a properly directed Jury might have found Timoti guilty of the lesser charge of Manslaughter which was not available or presented to the Jury as an option when he was convicted in 1999. Timoti's conviction was quashed and a new trial was ordered. It was the first ever-successful criminal appeal to the newly formed Supreme Court (formed in 2004) R v McIntyre (Far North Farmer Shoots Thieves) - District Court 2005 In 2005, Judge Michael Lance directed the jury in this case to find the accused Paul McIntyre not guilty. This was a re-trial of a charge that Mcintyre unlawfully discharged a firearm in a manner likely to endanger another's safety. In 2002 McIntyre fired at thieves attempting to steal his quad-bike from his Far North Farm. The direction to the jury followed 2 days of submissions and legal argument from Shaw and fellow Barrister Barry Hart. The Northern Advocate reported that the Judges direction (to find McIntyre not guilty) sic \\"..came after two days of intense legal argument between McIntyre's lawyers Barry Hart and Antony Shaw and Crown prosecutor Kim Thomas..\\". The paper went on to report that after the verdict was delivered \\"..a relieved Mr McIntyre said a \\"hellish\\" two-and-a- half-years fighting the charges were now over and he could get on with his life and farming. \\"I feel really relieved. I wasn't expecting this but I was hoping for it,\\" he said..\\" R v Alan Duff - District Court 2008 In 2008, Shaw successfully represented Author and writer of Once Were Warriors Alan Duff MBE. Duff was found not guilty of failing to remain at a scene after being stopped by police. In September 2007 Duff was stopped for speeding but drove off after producing his licence and address. The Judges verdict followed a 3 day hearing where the Rotorua Daily Post reported that in closing submission Shaw submitted \\"..Duff gave the police officer who stopped him, Constable Patricia Foden, his driver's licence and address before she went back to her patrol car to make further inquiries about him. Duff was not obliged to remain and Ms Foden could have sent Duff a speeding infringement notice..\\". In the Courts written decision Judge McGuire said \\"..although Duff displayed more anger than may have been wise, he complied with the officer by producing his licence and providing his address...\\" The Judge went on to say In his written decision that the Police Officers \\"...request for him to wait while she made further inquiries went beyond the provisions of the Land Transport Act..\\". The Judge said that \\"..whilst there could be very sound practical and pragmatic reasons to \\"give carte blanche\\" to inquiries such as those undertaken by the Police officer in Duff's case, \\". .. there are certainly arguments to the contrary that they are an unwarranted and further erosion of human rights..\\". In the decision the Judge detailed that Constable Patricia Foden pulled Duff over and told him he'd been going 112km/h. Duff had disputed the speed and during the heated exchange that followed he was threatened with pepper-spray, pursued for 3.5km and handcuffed twice before being taken to the police station and charged with failing to remain at a scene. More than three months later, police added two counts of resisting arrest, which were withdrawn by the Police shortly before the Judge issued his decision. In his decision Judge McGuire expressed concern at the lag between the two sets of charges, and called the evidence given by the Constable for the resisting arrest charges \\"unpersuasive\\". The Police appealed the Judges verdict. In the 2009 Appeal Decision, Justice Paul Heath said in his written decision that \\"an officer was empowered to require a driver to remain stopped for as long as was reasonably necessary to undertake a query on any issues relevant to enforcement powers or duties under the Transport Act.\\" The Judge went on to say that he found the District Court Judge erred in his interpretation of the law, but he was not prepared to interfere with the judge's decision to dismiss the charges, Justice Heath said \\"In the exercise of my discretion, I do not order a rehearing of the informations.......The facts of the case did not justify another hearing and there was no clear evidence on the extent of inquiries undertaken by the arresting constable,\\" he said. Accordingly, Duff was not convicted of any charges. Morse v Queen - Supreme Court 2010 - Also known as \\"The Flag Burning Case\\" In 2010, Shaw successfully represented \\"Flag Burner\\" Valerie Morse in the New Zealand Supreme Court before Supreme Court Justices Elias CJ, Blanchard, Tipping, McGrath and Anderson JJ. Morse's conviction was quashed. Morse was previously convicted of behaving in an offensive manner following her burning of a New Zealand Flag at the Wellington Cenotaph at a dawn service on Anzac day 2007 (which she freely admitted), Morse claimed that she did so in protest of New Zealands military involvement in the Afghanistan war. (decision released 2011) R (The Queen) v (Waihopai Spy Base Protestors) - District Court 2010 In 2010 Shaw also successfully defended a client who had been charged with breaking into the high security New Zealand/US Spy Base. The New Zealand Herald reported that despite the 3 men admitting that they had broken into the spy base and despite a long and involved trial, the Jury took just two hours to find each man not guilty. In 2008 the men were each charged with two charges of wilful damage and one of burglary, after breaking into the Waihopai Spy Base Facility operated by the New Zealand Government‚Äôs Communications Security Bureau (GCSB).

Her art is thematically linked to her family and her origins as a Filipino American. She has served as Chairwoman of the Palo Alto Public Art Commission, lectured at the Smithsonian and Mills College, and received multiple awards and fellowships for her art. In 2004 she became the first Filipino American to exhibit art at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco's Samsung Hall.  Early life and education  Born in Oakland, California, the oldest of six children, Acebo Davis gained a Bachelor of Science from California State University, Hayward in 1976, followed by graduate coursework in nursing at the University of California, San Francisco. In 1991 she was awarded a Bachelor of Fine Arts by San Jose State University, followed by an MFA in 1993.  Career  In 1997 she was awarded the James D. Phelan Award by Kala Institute, along with the Radius Award of the Palo Alto Cultural Centre. The same year, she participated in the exhibition Families: Rebuilding, Recreating, Reinventing hosted by Flo Oy Wong at the Euphrat Museum of Art. In 1998, Acebo Davis began a residency at the Frans Masereel Centre in Kasterlee, Belgium. Rather than become a full- time artist, she chose to balance this with work as a professional nurse, serving as Pediatric Critical Care Transport Specialist at Stanford Medical Center as of 1998. In 2003, Acebo Davis was awarded one of the three annual Arts Council Silicon Valley Fellowships, and she became the first Filipino American to exhibit art at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco's Samsung Hall, where her piece Tabing Rising, visually describing her family's immigration to the United States in 1945, was displayed in 2004. In 2010, she served as Chairwoman of the Palo Alto Public Art Commission, continuing in this role into 2011.  Artistic themes and works  Acebo Davis's art is heavily rooted in her origins as a Filipino American, her family, and racial strife and collision. Dahil Sa Yo, her \\"seminal work\\", features repetitive images of her mother set behind multiple boxes of shoes, drawing on the public persona of Imelda Marcos. The repetition of the image serves to emphasize the importance of her mother and other women of her generation, who \\"held together their families and looked after their home\\" as immigrants.

Feminism in Chile has its own liberation language and activist strategies for rights that is shaped by the political, economic, and social system of Chile. Beginning in the 19th century, Chilean women have been organizing with aspirations of asserting their political rights. These aspirations have had to work against the reality that Chile is one of the most socially conservative countries in Latin America. The C√≠rculo de Estudios de la Mujer (Women's Studies Circle) is one example of a pioneering women's organization during the Pinochet dictatorship (1973‚Äì1989) which redefined women's responsibilities and rights, linking ‚Äúmothers‚Äô rights‚Äù to women's rights and women's civil liberties. The founding members of the C√≠rculo de Estudios de La Mujer consisted of a small group of Santiago feminists who were from the Academia de Humanismo Cristiano. These women gathered \\"to discuss the situation of women in Chile,\\" their first meeting drew a crowd of over 300 participants and from there challenged the authoritarian life in Santiago. These women helped shape the rights for women in Chile. Early history of feminism in Chile With the strong influence of Catholicism in Chile, some of the first feminist movements ironically came from socially conservative women. In 1912, upper-class women began to advocate for working-class women in a way that was favorable to conservative groups of the time. The first female organizations that came to be in Chile started around 1915, but unlike many other countries and their groups, these women were most likely to be in the upper middle class.Lavrin, Asuncio√å¬Ån. Women, Feminism, and Social Change in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, 1890-1940. Lincoln, Neb.: U of Nebraska, 1995. Print. As such, they were largely able to put together these groups where exploration of the interest in feminism came to be by shedding particular light on the issues that middle to upper-class feminists found to be the most important. One of the earliest examples of this in Chilean history occurred on June 17, 1915, when a young university student, and later a diplomat and suffragist, named Amanda Labarca decided to start a group called the C√≠rculo de Lectura, where she was able to promote Chilean culture towards women. With this, she was able to bring together positivity and change within the women in her community because she strived to ensure that all women could be given a chance to have their voices heard, through education, regardless of their affiliations and social status. Early feminism in Chile also took notes on the international feminist mobilizations, while catering to Chile's specific culture. For example, feminists such as Amanda Labarca promoted a domestic form of feminism which was sensitive to the socially and politically conservative governmental powers of the time. Generally speaking, this was what was seen as the beginning of first-wave feminism amongst Chilean women.Franceschet, Susan. \\"Explaining Social Movement Outcomes.\\" Comparative Political Studies. Acadia University, 1 June 2004. Web. 5 December 2016. History The most compactly organized feminist movement in South America in the early 20th century was in Chile. There were three large organizations which represented three different classes of people: the Club de Senoras of Santiago represented the more prosperous women; the Consejo Nacional de Mujeres represented the working class, such as schoolteachers; other laboring women organized another active society for the improvement of general educational and social conditions. The Circulo de Lectura de Senoras was founded in 1915 in Santiago Chile by Delia Matte de Izquierdo. Only one month later, the Club de Senoras was created and founded by Amanda Labarca. Women such as Amanda Labarca were particularly successful in their feminist efforts mainly due to some of their international contacts and experiences resulting from studying abroad. While Chile was very conservative socially and ecclesiastically during this time, its educational institutions were opened to women since around the 1870s. When Sarmiento as an exile was living in Santiago, he recommended the liberal treatment of women and their entrance into the university. This latter privilege was granted while Miguel Luis Amunategui was minister of education. In 1859, when a former minister of education opened a contest for the best paper on popular education, Amunategui received the prize. Among the things which he advocated in that paper was the permitting of women to enter the university, an idea which he had received from Sarmiento. The development of woman's education was greatly delayed by the war between Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. President Balmaceda was a great friend of popular education. Under him, the first national high school, or \\"liceo,\\" for girls was opened, about 1890. This first wave of feminism began in about 1884. Chile was one of the first Latin American countries to admit women to institutions of higher education as well as to send women abroad to study. By the 1920s, there were 49 national \\"liceos\\" for girls, all directed by women. Besides these, there were two professional schools for young women in Santiago and one in each Province. The Consejo Nacional de Mujeres maintained a home for girls attending the university in Santiago, and helped the women students in the capital city. There were nearly a 1,000 young women attending the University of Chile in the early 20th century. The conservative element of this club focused primarily on pursuing women's intellectual work, while later on, Consejo Nacional took more progressive ideas into account. Their members consisted of impressive middle class, aristocratic, woman who had a great deal of influence on their communities, including government and private sectors. Labarca wrote several interesting volumes‚Äî such as, Actividades femininas en Estados Unidos (1915), and Ad√≥nde va la mujer (1934). She was accompanied in her work by a circle of women, most, of whom were connected with educational work in Chile. Several women's periodicals were published in Chile during this period, one of note being El Pefleca, directed by Elvira Santa Cruz. Labarca is perhaps considered one of Chile's most prominent feminist leaders. In a 1922 address given before the Club de Senoras of Santiago, Chilean publisher Ricardo Salas Edwards stated the following: \\"There have been manifested during the last 25 years phenomena of importance that have bettered woman's general culture and the development of her independence. Among them were the spread of establishments for the primary and secondary education of women; the occupations that they have found themselves as the teachers of the present generation, which can no longer entertain a doubt of feminine intellectual capacity; the establishment of great factories and commercial houses, which have already given her lucrative employment, independent of the home; the organization of societies and clubs; and, finally, artistic and literary activities, or the catholic social action of the highest classes of women, which has been developed as a stimulus to the entire sex during recent years.\\" Amanda Labarca initially thought that asking for suffrage in Chile was inappropriate. In 1914, she wrote, \\"I am not a militant feminist, nor am I a suffragist, for above all I am Chilean, and in Chile today the vote for women is out of order.\\" This sentiment began to change as the post-World War I economic crisis hit, and more and more women were pushed into the working class. In order to complement this new economic responsibility, women began to fight for political, legal, and economic rights. In 1919, Labarca transformed the Ladies Reading Circle into the National Women's Council, which was informed by international women's councils. A new political body was formed in the early 1920s under the name of the Progressive Feminist Party with the purpose of gaining all the rights claimed by women. The platform was: # The right to the municipal and parliamentary vote and to eligibility for office. # The publishing of a list of women candidates of the party for public offices. # The founding of a ministry of public welfare and education, headed by a woman executive, to protect women and children and to improve living conditions.Pan American Union (1922), p. 632 The founders of the party (middle-class women) carried on a quiet and cautious campaign throughout the country. No distinction was made between the social positions of party adherents, the cooperation of all branches of feminine activity being sought to further the ends of the party. The press investigated public opinion regarding the new movement. Congress had already received favorably a bill to yield civil and legal rights to women. The greatest pressure was brought to bear to obtain the concession of legal rights to women to dispose of certain property, especially the product of their own work, and the transference to the mother, in the father's absence, of the power to administer the property of the child and the income therefrom until the minor's majority. It was understood that concession of these rights would elevate the authority of the mother and bring more general consideration for women, as well as benefits to family life and social welfare. One group that stands out in particular as a historical cornerstone of feminism in Chile is the Movement for the Emancipation of Chilean Women (MEMCh). Founded in 1935 by influential feminists such as Marta Vergara, MEMCh fought for the legal, economic, and reproductive emancipation of women as well as their community involvement to improve social conditions. MEMCh produced an inspiring monthly bulletin (La Mujer Nueva) that contextualized the work being done in Chile with international feminism. While feminism in Chile of a decade earlier had focused on more nationalistic and religious goals, MEMCh initiated a connectedness between South and North American women, in defense of democracy. In December 1948, the Chilean Congress had approved a bill granting full political rights to the women of Chile. During Pinochet's dictatorship throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, coalitions and federations of women's groups‚Äînot all of which necessarily designated themselves in name as feminists‚Äîgathered in kitchens, living rooms, and other non-political arenas to devise strategies of bringing down the dictator's rule. During his presidency, the second wave of feminism was occurring. Because political movements, mostly male-dominated, were oppressed nearly out of existence during the dictatorship, women gathered in a political manner outside of what was traditionally male. Through this they created grassroots organizations such as Moviemento pro emancipacio de la Mujer that is credited with directly influencing the downfall of Pinochet. Pinochet's rule also involved mass exile‚Äîan estimation of over 200,000 by 1980. While Chilean women were living in exile in Vancouver, Canada, a feminist magazine created by Latinas, called Aquelarre began to circulate widely. There were a variety of reasons that women sought to gain more freedom. One of the reasons consisted on the fact that Chilean women were trying to mirror the independence that women had in North America during the Industrial era. Women were eager to work, and make money. However, there was a very large belief that if women worked, then households would fall apart. Some of the strategic preferences that allowed for women's rights was autonomy, double militancy, and integration. Even within the feminist community in Chile, there is an overall disagreement as to how feminism has been affected by democracy post dictatorship. Even though more feminist policies were put in place during the 1990s, feminists paradoxically largely lost their voices politically. This reconfiguration of the feminist movement post dictatorship has posed certain challenges to the advancement of feminist ideals. There has been a general trend towards disregarding this moment in the history of feminism in Chile even though there were significant organizations who continued to work towards liberation. In the 1990s, there was often a dichotomy between groups that worked within institutions to instill change, and those who wanted to distance their motives as far away from the patriarchy as possible. While the privileged professors of newly established gender and women's studies programs in universities were given more of a say, the average citizens found that their voices were often muffled and restrained by institutionalized feminism. Chile made marital rape illegal in 1999. More recently, the Chilean women's movements continue to advocate for their rights and participation in all levels of the democratic society and through non-governmental organizations. Similarly, a large political barrier for women was broken when Michelle Bachelet became Chile's first female president. Laura Albornoz was also delegated as Minister of Women's Affairs during Bachelet's first term as president. This position's duties includes running the Servicio Nacional de la Mujer or the National Women's Service. Servicio Nacional de la Mujer (SERNAM) - protects women's legal rights in the public sector. In the beginning of its creation, some opinions were that SERNAM organization was said to have weakened the women's rights agenda due because it wasn't successful at policy influence. The organization was later found to be successful at creating programs and legislation that promoted the protection of women's rights at work, school and worked to criminalize domestic violence and protection. The success of this organization is debated, but it has made substantial moves to publicize the issues women face across Chile. Motherhood has also been an important aspect of the feminist movement in Chile. Due to the vast influence of Catholicism in the country, the first (1940s) women's centers for mothering began with religious motives. Most of these centers, however, were catered to upper-class women, leaving the poorest women the least supported. The Central Organization for Mothers (CEMA) was created in 1954, to \\"provide spiritual and material well-being to the Chilean women\\". CEMA worked, more so than other women's centers, to provide services for underprivileged women in Chile. Through motherhood, the Chilean woman has been politicized- not only is she ridiculed for overpopulating a country while given minimal means of reproductive support, but she is also taken as a passive object of governance. The parity promoted by Bachelet did not survive her. Half of the ministries in her first government were occupied by women; in her successor's team, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, they barely reached 18%.http://www.medelu.org/Lo-que-cambia-para-las-mujeres  Women's access to voting in Chile  Chile has been considered one of the most socially conservative countries in Latin America. This has been exemplified by women's struggle to gain freedom in terms of voting. The Chilean government esteems Catholicism, which puts women in a patriarchal, domesticated setting, and has been used as reasoning for restricting women's rights. Even though the first woman (Domitila Silva Y Lepe) voted in 1875, voting was still considered a barrier well into the 1900s to women's rights in Chile. By 1922, Graciela Mandujano and other women founded the Partido C√≠vico Femenino (Women's Civic Party) which focused on women getting the right to vote. Women formally gained the right to vote in 1949. During that time, women and men voted in separate polling stations due to an effort to provide women with less influence on their preferences. Women also tended to vote more conservatively than men, demonstrating the influence of religion on voting preferences. Although most organizations dissolved after suffrage was granted, Partido Femenino Chileno (Chilean Women's Party), founded by Mari√© de la Cruz in 1946, continued to grow and work for more women's rights throughout the years. Chilean women's influence on politics has been demonstrated through multiple occasions during presidential elections - for example, had women not voted in the 1958 election, Salvador Allende would have won. During Chile's dictatorship (1973-1990), developments in regards to women's rights stalled comparatively. This did not stop some feminist groups from speaking out, however, as exemplified by the women's march of 1971 against Salvador Allende. This march had long-lasting effects, particularly by establishing women's role in politics, and turning the day of the march into National Women's Day. Post dictatorship, women paradoxically also seemed to lose their voice politically. With a more recent surge in feminism in Chile, the first female leader, Michelle Bachelet, became the 34th president in 2006‚Äì2010. While not immediately re-electable for the next election, she was appointed the first executive director of United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). On March 11, 2014, she became the 36th president, beginning her second term.  Leaders of the feminist movement in Chile  Julieta Kirkwood, born in 1937, was considered the founder of the feminist movement of the 1980s and an instigator of the organization of gender studies at universities in Chile. After studying at the University of Chile, she was influenced by the 1968 revolution in France. At the core of her ideologies was the mantra, ‚ÄòThere is no democracy without feminism‚Äù. Influenced by the ideologies of sociologist Enzo Faletto, she contributed to FLACSO‚Äôs theoretical framework of rebellious practices in the name of feminism. Kirkwood not only theorized, but also practiced a life full of activism ‚Äì being a part of MEMCh 83 as well as the Center for Women's Studies. She also wrote opinionated pieces in a magazine called Furia. Her book, Ser pol√≠tica en Chile, framed how academia has contributed to the social movements of the 1980s. She argued for equal access to scientific knowledge for women, as well as advocating for a more just educational system. Amanda Labarca was one of the pioneering feminists in Chile and paved the way for what feminism is today.  2018 feminist wave  The Ni una menos and Me Too movements generated Chilean marches in November 2016, March 2017 and October 2017 to protest violence against women. Following Sebasti√°n Pi√±era's assumption of the Presidency in March 2018, women's marches and university occupations were expanded from April to June 2018 to protest against machismo, domestic violence and sexual harassment and sexist behaviour in universities and schools, and for abortion rights.

They can grow up to but usually grow up to . Its diet consists of zooplankton, invertebrates, fish, and debris. Zacco platypus Is called Oikawa „Ç™„Ç§„Ç´„ÉØÔºàËøΩÊ≤≥„ÄÅOpsariichthys platypusÔºâin Japan.  Description  The pale chub has a moderately large head with moderately large eyes that are located on the upper side of the head. They have a large mouth, so much so that the posterior end of the jaw reaches the anterior part of the eye. The pale chub has an elongated body that is more compressed at the posterior end. Their maximum length is 20 cm and on average pale chubs are 13 cm in length. The cycloid scales are moderately large, and they have a complete lateral line. There are no scales on the head. They have a forked caudal fin. They have a grayish coloration close to the dorsal with the rest of the body being silvery. When spawning, the males will have 10 or more vertical strips that are bluish in color. They can live for 6 or more years.  Habitat  They live primarily in freshwater. The adults prefer streams and rivers that have a rapid flow. They do not really like deep, stagnant water. They mainly live by the bottom when adults because that is where their food source is located.  Distribution  They are widely distributed to northern China, Korea and northern Vietnam. They are also found in Japan and the northwestern part of Taiwan. They are mostly found in climates of 10¬∞- 22 ¬∞C.  Diet  They are omnivores but prefer eating other animals over eating plants. They feed on zooplankton, algae, small fish and detritus. When young, they mainly eat insects and larvae. The young tend to hunt in groups, and they tend to hunt at dawn. Adults tend to be more solitary in their hunting.  Reproduction  In nature, males become vibrant around the time of breeding to attract females to mate. Pale chubs are typically free-range. That means that they leave egg and sperm free instead of brood care. There have been no reports of successful breeding in an aquarium although it is possible for reproduction in an aquarium.  Uses  Dori-baengbaengi (pan-fried freshwater minnow) Zacco platypus are used as bait for sport-fishing for larger fish. They are popular for fly fishers and are caught for consumption. Males are used for aquariums because of their vibrant coloring.

Georgene and John worked at many colleges and universities over the years, with John ultimately settling in at University of California at Los Angeles and Georgene settling in at the University of Southern California for the remainder of their careers. The couple had two daughters, Barbara and Joan Perry (\\"Jerry\\"). After the death of their eldest daughter Barbara Seward Price age 30, on September 3, 1958, the Sewards created a scholarship in her memory at Columbia University where she had studied that would fully cover the expenses of a General Studies Student's tuition at Columbia. Her husband, John, died in 1985; Georgene died on September 19, 1992, in Los Angeles, California.  Professional career  Following her doctoral training, Georgene Seward taught at Hunter College in New York City for one year, before returning to Barnard College to teach from 1930 to 1937. During this time, her husband taught at Columbia University. During her professional career at Barnard College Seward was consistently overlooked for promotion in favour of her less experienced, less competent, male counterparts. This anecdote would repeat itself during her seven-year professional career running the psychology department at Connecticut College for Women with her husband. The fourteen years without acknowledgement for her abilities and accomplishments pushed Seward to research and tackle issues related to the feminine role. From 1937 to 1944 Drs. Georgene and John Seward together began running the psychology department at Connecticut College for Women. Here the couple worked in close collaboration with many other prominent researchers at the time, including Harry and Leta Hollingworth, Otto Klineberg, Gardner and Lois Murphy, and Robert Woodworth. Dr. Seward's time at Connecticut College was during the Second World War gave her the opportunity to cross paths with many famous German psychologist that were evacuating Nazi Germany including; Wolfgang K√∂hler, Max Wertheimer, Karl B√ºhler and Charlotte B√ºhler. In 1944, Seward published one of her first seminal pieces. This piece, entitled \\"Psychological effects of the menstrual cycle on women workers\\", demonstrated that the menstrual cycle has no impact of the on the performance of working women, debunking the myth of menstrual invalidism. In 1944, the Sewards left Connecticut College for Women; Georgene Seward took at teaching position at Simmons College and John Seward took a position at Boston University. In 1946, the Sewards accepted positions on the west coast and moved to California; John joined the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles, and Georgene joined the faculty at the University of Southern California, where she remained until her retirement in 1972. At USC, Georgene taught social and personality psychology, clinical psychology, and ran the clinical training program. It was there that Seward then began also working in private practice, in addition to her teaching duties. She was also a clinical consultant for the Veterans Administration Hospital, Metropolitan State Hospital, and the Didi Hirsch Mental Health Clinic. She continued to work in private practice until 1987. Both of the Sewards were dedicated antifascists and socialists, during the 1950s the McCarthy Era prosecutions brought both Georgene and her husband John under scrutiny with the Loyalty oath Controversy (Sargent, 1993). While in California, Dr. Georgene Seward continued her work in gender and minority studies. It was here that she publish two seminal works on gender, some of the first texts of their kind. The first was \\"Cultural conflict and the feminine role: An experimental study\\" (1945); in this study, Seward investigated individuals attitudes toward women in post-war America. She found that attitudes toward women and the roles they filled varied and were based largely on context (post-war American families were transitioning from a patriarchal to a more democratic structure), leading her to believe that these attitudes were the result of the socialization of sex roles. Her second was Sex and the social order (1946); in this book, Seward summarized much of the literature on what was known of sex differences, or the lack thereof. She returned to these interests again later in her career, coauthoring two additional books: Sex Roles in Changing Society (1970) and Sex Differences: Mental and Temperamental (1980). During her time in California, Seward also began to explore how culture and minority status impact clinical practice. It was then that she published two additional important books: Psychotherapy and Culture Conflict (1956) and Clinical Studies in Culture Conflict (1958). In these books, Seward investigated the unique neuroticisms and stress experienced by minorities. These two books, having influenced both social psychological research and clinical practice, are often considered her two greatest contributions to the field. Throughout the remainder of her career, she continued pursuing such important work and encouraging other women to do the same. In 1972 Seward retired as a professor emeritus at USC; at the same time John retired from UCLA. She continued to run her private clinical practice for another 15 years and returned to active collaboration with her husband. Seward's continuing impact is best known among Feminist psychology professionals and clinical workers, as her books, Psychotherapy and Culture Conflict (1956) and Clinical Studies in Culture Conflict (1958) were considered highly influential among professionals in the field at that time. Her observation and dedication to the effects of minority status encouraged greater understanding of how the social pressures that arise from cultural influences shape patient and therapist dynamics (Seward, 1956). Including the idea that female patients should have the opportunity to be treated by a female therapists. Dr. Georgene Hoffman Seward was a dedicated researcher, clinician, and mentor, who remained involved in her work until 1987. In 1987, only five years before her death, Dr. Seward was awarded the Distinguished Psychologist Award by the California State Psychological Association in recognition of her own leadership in teaching, research, and community service.  Contributions to psychology Seward was one of the first female psychologists to explore, and debunk, various theories of sex differences. She was also one of the first clinical psychologists to consider the impact of culture and minority status on clinical settings and treatment techniques. She was a researcher devoted feminist issues, and was an early advocate seeking culturally appropriate and sensitive mental health treatment. As stated by Lisa Held, of Feminist Voices in Psychology, \\"she has become a role model for feminist psychologists\\". She was not only a brave pioneer in the field of gender studies, but was an avid supporter of female leadership in psychology.  Early academic career  During the Sewards‚Äô early postdoctoral years they formed a professional relationship with the creator of the Pap test, G. N. Papanicolaou. This relationship would result in a number of studies on the reproductive behaviours of the guinea pig, including a comparison of male and female guinea pig sex drives and the specificity of the sex drive in male guinea pigs. Seward's early feminist works included The Psychological Effects of the Menstrual Cycle on Women Workers (1944) and an experimental study called Culture Conflict and the Feminine Role (1945). These works would be the prelude to a more comprehensive collection of social sex differences called Sex and the Social Order (1946).  Psychological effects of the menstrual cycle on women workers (1944)  The close of World War Two called for rapid re-evaluation of women's perceived ‚Äòbiological handicaps‚Äô; in particular the focus was upon the menstrual cycle, historically seen as a time of bed rest and delicacy. Dysmenorrhea essentially was extreme pain and disability associated with the menstrual cycle (Seward, 1944). Seward (1944) gathered reports on women workers from two main areas; industrial and education settings. In the industrial setting menstrual invalidism seems to be the ‚Äògo- to‚Äô explanation of the trend that women workers miss more work days than their male counterparts (Seward, 1944). However, little collected data of the time supported the belief that menstruating women were unable to effectively contribute. This included studies that looked to compare performance abilities that found little difference in reaction times between menstruating and non- menstruating women; further studies with male controls found little difference between males and menstruating females (Seward, 1944). Seward (1944) accumulated evidence from a number of sources that employed female workers; the overall findings do not support the need to shelter females from work due to dysmenorrhea. One of these sources included a division of General Motors that not only employed female workers, but also had a clinic set up to help women workers deal with the negative consequences of dysmenorrhea with pain medication and simple exercises; and reported no significant absenteeism from women (Seward, 1944). Seward (1944) also reviewed differences between female students and their performance effects. Nursing students were compared to other female university students due to the difference in physical demand and revealed a significant difference in the number of dysmenorrhea related problems. This suggested that despite popular belief that work and activity were more beneficial than harmful for women (Seward, 1944). These findings did not support the code of menstrual invalidism that often took place in order to discriminate against women workers (Seward, 1944).  Culture Conflict and the Feminine Role (1945)  The feminine role with the close of World War Two was to become a huge social concern; with men returning from war, women would be expected to return to their original, dependent roles The cultural setting of the time cemented the male/female dichotomy as an absolute; this view idolized the male/female identity as something that was beyond human control and was most likely biologically driven (Seward, 1945). Seward (1945) rebutted this view through redefinition of the feminine role as a cultural aspect that was assigned to women to their role depending on the social pressures of the time. The core of the argument suggested that the feminine role was not an absolute across all cultural groups; even the traditional predominately patriarchal Western culture had variations in the expectations of the feminine role across time (Seward, 1945). From clinical studies of psychologically sick women of the time Seward (1945) observed that a portion of these women's illnesses emerged from a conflict between social expectations of who they should be and who they were. The psychoanalytical theories of the time felt that this ‚Äòmasculine complex‚Äô was an illness ‚Äì the fallacy was grouping women with the motivation and talent to achieve outside of their expected domestic duties as being psychologically ill (Seward, 1945). Using Kurt Lewin‚Äôs Approach-Avoidance paradigm Seward (1945) argued that conflict arises from giving all children equal opportunity to learn and achieve; but with the expectation that women chose between family and their goals when they marry. Seward (1945) surveyed 147 first-year female psychology students on their attitudes towards the evolving female role to find the most extreme liberal and extreme conservative individuals. Seward (1945) modified two inventories, Kitay's attitudes towards women and Kirkpatrick's feminism-antifeminism attitude tests. After these inventories were administered the 15 most extreme attitudes at either ends of the scales were selected for further analysis (Seward, 1945). A follow-up interview was conducted to collect background information on home life, religious affiliations, and other potentially discrepancies between the groups. Seward (1945) found that in the most extreme groups a pattern emerged, a dichotomy in female attitudes toward the single female and the married female. Women whom were single could be independent, hold down a job and support themselves. The single female was awarded greater equality with men given that they had to compete with them in the workforce (Seward, 1945). The drawback to this freedom results from the greater uncertainty in security, resulting in conflict (Seward, 1945). Conservative individuals ranked lower on the feminism scale and projected traditional attitudes toward the wife role. These attitudes included adherence to social parasitism, which involved becoming completely depended upon the husband ‚Äì including social and financial matters (Seward, 1945). Liberal women ranked higher in feminism traits than their conservative counterparts, and also came from non-traditional/nuclear homes. These homes did not typically have the father/mother dynamic and in comparison to their conservative counterparts were not particularly religious. The conservative group came from the traditional/nuclear family set up and the majority (14 out of 15 subjects) were regular church attendees (Seward, 1945). For the liberal females conflict occurs when shifting from single feminist to the role of traditional wife/subordinate and the social expectation that accompanies the role (Seward, 1945).  Sex Differences: Mental and Temperamental (1980)  Following the Sewards‚Äô retirement in 1972, they began an active collaboration to bring their respective fields together to produce Sex Differences: Mental and Temperamental (1980). Prior to Dr. John Seward's death in 1985 a follow-up work had begun, but was never completed. Dr. John Seward's knowledge and experience with learning was combined with Dr. Georgene Seward's knowledge of social, personality and clinical psychology. The general principle of the book was to determine if sex differences were either biologically defined or socially assigned (Seward & Seward, 1980). This was particularly important because sex differences were used to justify the oppression of women and the dominance of men and infiltrated scientific objectivity through cultural experience (Seward & Seward, 1980). Sex Differences: Mental and Temperamental (1980) is a comprehensive literature review of studies that investigated differences between male and female. The goal of Sex Differences: Mental and Temperamental was to converge the literature of different cultures, non-human animal research, historical cultures, normal and abnormal development, and learning theory into a comprehensive manifestation of sex roles. The working hypothesis of the book was based upon a couple key assumptions, the first being that sex differences were a by-product of evolution. The other assumption was that with the increased development of the human brain and its by products (such as language, context and memory) increase humans‚Äô ability to manipulate the environment have made some biological adaptations obsolete. The objective was an attempt to isolate sex-specific traits that were resistant to cultural change and persist as biologically ingrained dispositions (Seward & Seward, 1980). Seward and Seward (1980) predicted that the most stable sex differences would be those most closely related to behaviours related to reproduction. Mental/cognitive processes were predicted to be less stable and subject to social expectation (Seward & Seward, 1980). Careful examination of historical and current cultures was required for the elimination or confirmation of sex differences (Seward & Seward, 1980). Historically men are more likely to interact with their environment through exploration and reconstruction, while women are more prone to interact through communications which correspond to evolutionary expectations (Seward & Seward, 1980). Seward and Seward (1980) wished to determine the extent to which biological processes corresponded to sex differences and the extent to which social expectation influence accepted sex differences. = Mental abilities = In chapter three of Sex Differences the focus was upon mental differences. The use of intellectual measures of behaviour was seen as more objective as it was often attributed to genetics or hormones. Overall intelligence differences were often related to three subsets of intelligent behaviour; verbal, numerical and spatial. The data on intelligence was in abundance, ranging in people from kindergarten to college. Seward and Seward (1980) reviewed Diane McGuiness's (1975) experimental study that had found a trend favouring females in hearing task and favouring males in sight related tasks. Seward and Seward (1980) caution the quick conclusion of a biological aspect to the differences, instead suggesting that the differences observed were the result of biases in social roles. The development of these differences was likely the result of social biases that have risen through evolutionary history of men as providers and women as caretakers (Seward & Seward, 1980). Studies reviewed by Seward and Seward (1980) found most consistently was females tend to perform better in all forms of communication (verbal, written or read) and infant females made more frequent vocalizations and from an earlier age. Women also typically had a more global cognitive style to their mental abilities, while men traditionally had a more analytical cognitive approach (Seward & Seward, 1980). However, evidence was arising for male dominance in spatial abilities and problem solving with a potential role of androgenic hormone. Evidence for biological innateness suggested a greater susceptibility for men because learning disorders such as dyslexia were more frequently reported (Seward & Seward, 1980). The Differentiation Hypothesis presented by Garrett (1946) suggested that all skills start out with a general ability that is specialized over time (Seward & Seward, 1980). = Masculinity and femininity = Seward and Seward (1980) explored the variations in terms of understandings of Masculine and Feminine in three distinct ways. The first was the Essential Core; religious/spiritual dichotomies such as heaven/male, earth/female, yin representing the female, negative and passive in opposite to the yang which was male, positive and active (Bakan, 1966 as cited in, Seward & Seward, 1980). Secondly there were social stereotypes of the ‚Äòtypical‚Äô man and the ‚Äòtypical‚Äô woman held by real men and women in cultural groups. The last was to review self-reported attitudes of people in terms of how they measured up to the stereotype. Seward and Seward (1980) found in their literature review that real men and women often mirrored the stereotype with a few variations. An example given by Seward and Seward (1980) was that women were not found to be more neurotic or suspicious than men. Stable tendencies included male characteristic of ‚Äòtoughness‚Äô and ‚Äòself-assertion‚Äô and female characteristic of ‚Äòsensitivity‚Äô and ‚Äòsocial need‚Äô (Seward & Seward, 1980). = Activity = Seward and Seward (1980) reviewed literature on the activity levels of male and female children. From a young age (second year to puberty) male children tend to be more active than their female counterparts, with more reports of hyperactivity in male children. This statistical data helped to support biological sex differentiation component (Seward & Seward, 1980). Social Factors in Gender Development The differences in parental expectation between male and female children could have an important role upon their behaviour; however determining the extent was difficult with observational methods (Seward & Seward, 1980). These behaviours of gender development were analyzed in chapter six through a number of research studies under a number of popular paradigms of the day. These included, but not limited to; psychoanalytical, cognitive-developmental, and social learning. However the most detailed was modeling, covering research that included parental, peer and media (books and television) as sources of modelling (Seward & Seward, 1980). = Temperamental = Chapters nine to 12 deal with temperamental traits that were traditionally aligned with a particular gender. These temperamental aspects included; aggressiveness and dominance, fear and anxiety, compliance and nurturance, and need to achieve (Seward & Seward, 1980). It was acknowledged by most psychologists that men on average are more aggressive than females and females tended to be more anxious and nurturing than males (Seward & Seward, 1980). However, social learning theorists postulated that this difference was primarily the result of environmental learning/observation rather than innate biological drive; both sexes shared the same impulses, but in varying proportions (Seward & Seward, 1980). Additionally, the operant conditioning paradigm had gained momentum and psychologists‚Äô knowledge of rewards and punishments assisted in their understanding of behaviour. However, despite this knowledge the effective rewards and punishments that strength or weaken certain behaviours in sex differences were not well understood (Seward & Seward, 1980).

Like other species of the genus Osphronemus, juveniles and adults of this species have physical differences. Juveniles have 6 or 7 vertical stripes and a spot on the back, which fades as they get older. A red orange stripe appears around the bottom of the head when a juvenile grows up to about around . Adults are pale on its fins and blackish on its body. Conservation Elephant ear gouramis are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.

Although some women have been considered precursors‚Äîamong them Juana Manso and Juana Manuela Gorriti‚Äîfeminism was introduced to the country as a result of the great European immigration wave that took place in the late 19th and early 20th century. The first feminists did not form a unified movement, but included anarchist and socialist activists, who incorporated women's issues into their revolutionary program, and prestigious freethinker women, who initially fought for access to higher education and, later, legal equality with men. Despite the efforts of the first-wave feminists, Argentine women did not acquire the right to vote until 1947, during Juan Per√≥n's first government. His highly popular wife, Eva, championed women's suffrage and founded and ran the nation's first large-scale female political party, the Female Peronist Party. Although she refused to identify herself as a feminist, Eva Per√≥n is valued for having redefined the role of women in politics. The convulsive period between the late 1960s and mid-1970s was one of intense social transformations and political activism. Among the feminist organization that appeared were the Uni√≥n Feminista Argentina (UFA; English: Argentine Feminist Union) and the Movimiento de Liberaci√≥n Feminista (MLF; English: Feminist Liberation Movement). History Precursors Petrona Rosende de Sierra's La Aljaba, edited on November 12, 1830 and \\"dedicated to the Argentine fair sex\\". Between November 12, 1830 and January 14, 1831‚Äîduring the first government of Juan Manuel de Rosas‚ÄîUruguayan-born journalist Petrona Rosende de Sierra published what is considered to be the first Argentine publication written by and for women: La Aljaba (English: The Quiver). In addition to art, literature and friendship, the newspaper dealt with topics such as the intellectual formation of women, their role in society and their position in relation to men. Rosende de Sierra advocated the adoption of European educational theories, claiming that the government should provide primary and secondary education to women, who must have faith in their own capacity and prove their ability to overcome the resistance to female education.Carlson, 2005. p. 60 In one of the issues, the writer questioned her readers: \\"Until when the female sex will be seen plunged into the darkness in which it was locked by the oppressive system of those who denied the simplest knowledges?\\" Another periodical that argued for women's right to education was La Camelia (English: The Camellia), edited in 1852 by Rosa Guerra, the principal of a small private girl's school in Buenos Aires. Unlike Rosende de Sierra twenty years earlier, Guerra \\"believed that women did not need to prove themselves worthy of education, but had a moral and legal right to it\\"; she presented it as the solution of women's problems. At the same time, La Camelia warned that women \\"must not lose their feminine modesty\\" and avoid coming across as intellectuals as it \\"could be equated with loose morality.\\" During its brief life, the publication also supported dress reform, claiming women dressed as \\"ornamental dolls\\".Carlson, 2005. p. 61 Dress reform was a controversial issue at the time, and despite her emphasis on the importance of modesty in dress, Guerra was harshly criticised by influential Catholic women and the Church. In 1854, Guerra started another publication called La Educaci√≥n (English: The Education) similar in format to La Camelia. She was a prolific writer who also produced novels, children's books and articles and poetry for the daily newspapers. Despite her liberal politics, Guerra did not depart from the notion of \\"citizen-training mother\\" as the main role of women. She believed women were born to suffer for love, with female self-sacrifice being a constant theme in her work. This \\"romantic concept of womanly martyrdom\\" was a dominant theme in Argentine women's literature of the mid-19th century, which exalted female virtues at the expense of men's selfishness.Carlson, 2005. p. 62 Juana Manso, regarded as a pioneer of feminism in South America. Born in Buenos Aires on June 26, 1819, Juana Manso was a writer, translator, journalist, teacher and precursor of feminism in South America. In fact, she is considered by many as the first feminist of Argentina. Manso lived in Rio de Janeiro from 1849 to 1853, where she published The Women's Journal (Portuguese: O Jornal das Senhoras), a periodical modeled on an English magazine of the same name that, \\"argued against discrimination against women and supported equal education for Latin American women.\\"Carlson, 2005. p. 67 Back in Buenos Aires, she founded the Ladies' Album (Spanish: √Ålbum de Se√±oritas), with a very similar theme to the Brazilian journal. In her periodicals and novels, Manso advocated her ideas on equality of women, popular education and abolitionism, which were met with resistance by Argentine society, as it remained hostile to any manifestation that meant breaking ties with the colonial era. In a 1853 article titled \\"The Moral Emancipation of Women\\", published in the journal The Argentine Enlightenment (Spanish: La Ilustraci√≥n Argentina), Manso wrote: > The moral emancipation of women is considered by vulgarity as the apocalypse > of the century. Some run to the dictionary and exclaim: There is no parental > authority! Goodbye marital despotism! To emancipate the woman! How! For that > junk in the living room (or kitchen), that procreative machine, that golden > zero, that frivolous toy, that doll of fashions, will it be a rational > being? [...] How! Would she be one day equal to the man in sacred rights > that brutality trampled until today without mercy? Unheard-of scandal! What > could young people use to pretend the heart of beauties?

Feminism in the country emerged at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, during the consolidation of the modern Argentine State. There was not a homogenous feminist movement, rather individual struggles carried out by women inserted in diverse political identities and different social classes. Women from the upper and upper middle class made important advances in the public space, although they did it fundamentally from the academic field.Macoc, 2011. p. 157 Working class women were organized under socialism and anarchism.Macoc, 2011. p. 158 A group of anarchist women headed by Virginia Bolten founded La Voz de la Mujer in 1896, the first feminist newspaper in Argentina. It defined itself as anarcho-communist and was released under the motto \\"No God, no master, no husband\\". As one of the first recorded instances in Latin America of the fusion of feminist ideas with a revolutionary and working class orientation, La Voz de la Mujer differed from the feminism found elsewhere in the region at that time, which focused on educated middle-class women and their concerns. By the end of the 19th century, these anarchists raised issues as free love, divorce and allegations of domestic violence, which would gain public prominence decades later. Feminist activist Julieta Lanteri becoming the first Latin American woman to vote in 1911. From the turn of the century on, a different variant of feminism emerged, that of the Socialist Party, with women such as Cecilia Grierson, Alicia Moreau de Justo and Juana Rouco Buela; who \\"launched the struggle for equal rights, better educational opportunities, and reform of the civil code, and in so doing they radically redefined the politics, strategy, and terrain of feminist struggle.\\" The first feminists of the country, both the reformists as well as the suffragettes and even those of more extreme positions, believed in a \\"maternal, morally superior, and pacifist feminine nature.\\" Mayra Leci√±ana of Clar√≠n wrote that \\"the theoretical alliances with socialism and the positivism of the moment enable a utopian bias that gives thickness to their demands and allows the production of new meanings for 'the new woman'.\\" A \\"transcendental\\" figure in the history of Argentine feminism, Elvira L√≥pez became one of the first women to graduate from the University of Buenos Aires' School of Philosophy and Philology. Her thesis, written in 1901 and titled \\"The feminist movement\\" (Spanish: \\"El movimiento feminista\\"), is considered a local landmark and meant the issue's entry into the Argentine academic field. In 1904, Julieta Lanteri, Cecilia Grierson, Sara Justo, Elvira Rawson de Dellepiane and sisters Ernestina and Elvira L√≥pez created the Asociaci√≥n de Mujeres Universitarias Argentinas (English: Association of Argentine University Women), whose positions were identified with those of the so-called \\"moderate feminism\\".Lorenzo, 2017. p. 71 On the occasion of the Argentina Centennial of 1910 and on the initiative of Lanteri, this association organized the First International Women's Congress (Spanish: Primer Congreso Femenino Internacional) in order to bring the situation of women and their rights to public debate. The association was then chaired by Petrona Eyle, and the organizing committee for the Congress counted among its members with distinguished professionals and activists such as Lanteri, Justo, Grierson, Irma Vert√∫a, Ada Mar√≠a Elflein, Moreau de Justo, Fenia Chertkoff, doctors Leonor and Mar√≠a Teresa Mart√≠nez Bisso, among others. On February 16, 1906, Rawson de Dellepiane founded the Feminist Center (Spanish: Centro Feminista) in Buenos Aires, joined by a group of prestigious women. 1920s Women voting in 1920 in Buenos Aires as part of a mock election campaign carried out by feminist activists. The feminist movement during the 1920s was especially relevant, as activists achieved greater organization, perseverance and scope of membership to push for the rights that women were getting in other countries.Barrancos, 2010. Section \\"Los movimientos de mujeres y feministas en los a√±os 20. El sufragio en el congreso\\" within Chapter IV: \\"Sociedad y g√©nero a principios del siglo XX. El despertar del feminismo\\" The end of World War I ushered in a new period of political restlessness among urban Argentines. The feasibility of female suffrage was reinforced by news of women's activities in the war and the debate that was taking place in the United States, the United Kingdom and France.Lavrin, 1998. p. 267 In this context, the National Congress received several bills of women's suffrage in the decade, although all of them were shelved and disregarded. The constitution of Santa Fe Province of 1921 recognized the right of women to vote in municipal elections. In 1928, under a new constitution women from San Juan Province voted in provincial elections. In 1920, the associations led by Moreau decided to carry out a mock election campaign in Buenos Aires simultaneously with the congressional elections that were taking place in March. The idea was inspired by French suffragists who had held a mock election in 1918 in Paris to \\"gauge public support for woman suffrage.\\"Carlson, 2005. p. 158 The mock election for women was held through the cooperation of rival feminist groups, including the Comit√© Pro Sufragio Femenino, the Partido Feminista Nacional, the Uni√≥n Feminista Nacional and the Asociaci√≥n Pro Derechos de la Mujer.Lavrin, 1998. p. 271 While Dr. Moreau wanted a \\"well conducted, dignified campaign\\", Lanteri‚Äîwho was running for office with the National Feminist Party‚Äîsought more exposure and received attention from the North American and South American press, as well as Buenos Aires newspapers. Since she worked with many women from the British community, the Buenos Aires Herald followed her campaign closely, dubbing her \\"the Pankhurst of Argentina\\". The mock election was attended by over 4,000 women, with the Socialist Party making the best showing, followed by Julieta Lanteri and the Radical Party. A second voting exercise was held in November to coincide with the municipal elections.Lavrin, 1998. p. 273 Peronist era Eva Per√≥n addressing a crowd of women on the occasion of the enactment of the women's suffrage law, September 1947. While the figure of Eva Per√≥n is highly valued by Argentine feminism, she did not consider herself a feminist and was highly critical of the women's movement that had preceded her. She shared her perspectives on feminism and the political role of women in her 1951 autobiography La raz√≥n de mi vida (released by Vantage Press as My mission in life in 1953). Per√≥n dedicates a chapter entitled \\"From the sublime to the ridiculous\\" to criticize the feminist movement, claiming that they aspired to be men and consequently renounced their womanhood by imitating them.Per√≥n (translated by Ethel Cherry), 1953 [1951], p. 185-186 She wrote: > I confess I was a little afraid the day I found myself facing the > possibility of starting on the \\"feminist\\" path. What could I, a humble woman > of the people, do where other women, more prepared than I, had categorically > failed? Be ridiculous? Join the nucleus of women with a grudge against woman > and against man, as has happened to innumerable feminist leaders? I was not > an old maid, nor even ugly enough for such a post... which, from the time of > the English sufraggettes down to today, generally belongs, almost > exclusively, to women of this type... women whose first impulse undoubtedly > had been to be like men. [...] And if what the world requires is a woman's > political and social movement... how little will the world gain if the women > want to save it by imitating men! Although Argentine historiography has traditionally focused on the actions of Eva Per√≥n and the Partido Peronista Femenino, more contemporary investigations bring to light associations of women opposed to Peronism. One of the most important women's associations that appeared during the Peronist government was the Uni√≥n de Mujeres de la Argentina (UMA; English: \\"Women's Union of Argentina\\"), an arm of the Communist Party constituted in April 1947. The UMA had branches throughout the country and included a large number of women of different ideological and religious identities.Barrancos, 2010. Section \\"Las mujeres opositoras\\" within Chapter V: \\"Transiciones\\" 1960s and 1970s The convulsed period between the early 1970s until the 1976 coup d'√©tat was one of intense feminist activism, although \\"undeniably all the groups tended to dissolve, dissidences increased and there were migrations towards new formulas that, finally, were also extinguished.\\"Barrancos, 2010. Section \\"Movimientos de mujeres y feministas\\" within Chapter VI: \\"Revoluciones silenciosas y utop√≠as estridentes\\" Two prominent groups of the period were the Uni√≥n Feminista Argentina (UFA; English: Argentine Feminist Union) and the Movimiento de Liberaci√≥n Feminista (MLF; English: Feminist Liberation Movement), which were formed in 1970 and 1972 respectively. 1980s and 1990s Mar√≠a Elena Oddone going up the stairs of the Congressional Plaza with her controversial banner during the first Women's Day demonstrations held in Argentina since its return to democracy, 1984. The 1983 general election marked the return of democratic rule in Argentina and was accompanied by the surge of an intense feminist and women's movement.Barrancos, 2010. Section \\"El movimiento de mujeres\\" within Chapter VII: \\"Transici√≥n dem√≥cratica y traspi√© neoliberal. Avances (y algunos retrocesos) de los derechos humanos\\" It was a period of \\"renewal of women's activities\\" and featured a greater incidence of social movements and unions, political parties, autonomous groups, research groups and professional associations. The international context played an important role in this, since the United Nations had decided that the decade 1975-1985 should be dedicated to the equal promotion of women on the part of the member countries. This decision emanated from the 1975 World Conference on Women in Mexico City, which to a large extent inaugurated the major international forums dedicated to women's rights. On March 8, 1984, the first International Women's Day demonstrations since the end of the military regime took place in the Congressional Plaza, in what is now considered a landmark. The event was organized by the Multisectorial de la Mujer (English: Multisectorial of Women), a space formed by members of women's groups, feminists, housewives and representatives of political parties and unions. An emblematic moment of the protests was when activist Mar√≠a Elena Oddone climbed up the stairs of the Monument of the Two Congresses and raised a banner that read \\"No to motherhood, yes to pleasure\\". Her banner, as well as those held by other radical feminists that day, was harshly criticized by the press for being too provocative. Oddone was also repudiated within the feminist movement. Elena Tchalidy, president of the Alicia Moureau de Justo Foundation, said: \\"March 8 was the first public act and she walked with [that sign]. It came out in the magazine that today would be Caras or Gente. Then she said to me: 'Oh, three girls came to me.' 'Yes', I told her, 'and you distanced a few thousand.' Oddone recalled the meeting with the Multisectorial de la Mujer that took place two days after the event in her autobiography, claiming she replied to their \\"lapidary critics\\": \\"I am not a feminist to please anyone but to tell the truth about our condition. I did not write those banners to be liked. If they caused scandal, it is because the truth is always scandalous. We received Dr. Justo with admiration and affection. Eighty years ago, she and her companions who asked for the right to vote were called 'crazy'. I am willing to wait the same number of years for my banners to be understood.\\" Alicia Moreau de Justo (centre) marching alongside feminist activists in 1986. The post-dictatorship period saw the emergence of a new feminist journalism and alternative media, led by women such as Mar√≠a Elena Oddone, Hilda Rais, Moira Soto, Mar√≠a Elena Walsh and Cecilia Absatz. While one sector of feminist activism had a more institutional path and fought for laws such as shared parental authority, there was another, more \\"alternative\\" portion that was documented in magazines, newspapers and zines such as Brujas, Cuadernos de Existencia Lesbiana and Unidas. A celebrated publication of the early 1980s was Alfonsina, a periodical founded by journalist Mar√≠a Moreno that featured articles by people involved in feminist and gay activism, including Mart√≠n Caparr√≥s, Diana Raznovich, Alicia D'Amico, Sara Facio, N√©stor Perlongher, M√°rgara Averbach, Ana Amado and Alicia Genovese. Despite its underground condition, the magazine introduced the latest intellectual debates from Europe, mainly from Spain, Italy and France. Its editors identified with the \\"difference feminism\\" current, aiming to resignify \\"devalued\\" feminine values like motherhood and domesticity. The first issue of Alfonsina was published on December 15, 1983 and began with an editorial titled \\"¬øPor qu√©?\\" (English: \\"Why?\\"), which read: > Because one can be and be loved. [...] Because we do not want to live > against our mothers but to go with them towards a horizon where their hands > no longer sustain us but neither say goodbye to us with a scarf of sorrows. > Because one can be a Mother and be a Woman. [...] Because every talk between > women has a bit of tango, of noise from a municipal fair, of rattle of > scissors cutting a fringe, of lucid occurrences that are born and die in the > dawn of the cock and of the drunkard who whistles. Am√©ricaLee, online > archive of Latin American magazines of the 20th century supported by the > National University of General San Mart√≠n. Another renowned journal from that time was Feminaria, directed by Lea Fletcher and first published in June 1988. It has been described as \\"an endeavor designed to integrate northern feminist theory with Southern Cone intellectual production.\\" Unlike other publications they criticized for being too \\"unifocal\\", the writers of Feminaria did not align with a single concept of feminism and instead aimed to \\"show the breadth and variety that there is in [it].\\" Fletcher said in 1997: \\"we in Feminaria proposed to organize a pluralist space for feminist discussion, democratize information, and share high-level feminist theory produced both within and beyond the country.\\" The Fundaci√≥n Mujeres en Igualdad (MEI), known in English as the Women in Equality Foundation, is an Argentine NGO created in March 1990. It has been awarded consultative status with United Nations ECOSOC. The foundation sets out to combat gender based violence and discrimination against women by promoting welfare, participation and empowerment in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres. From its inception Women in Equality promoted the use of the new technologies intensively, being the first women's NGO in Argentina to have a website. Through such initiatives it has networked and created partnerships with NGOs and with the women's movement both at the national and international levels. During the 1990s, Argentine LGBT activism took off, and the end of the decade saw the entry of travestis into spaces of feminist discussion, marking the beginning of transfeminism in Argentina. The inclusion in particular was that of Lohana Berkins, one of the most prominent leaders of the travesti movement. Berkins got into feminism in the 1990s through meetings with lesbian feminists such as Alejandra Sarda, Ilse Fuskova, Chela Nadio and Fabiana Tron. 2000s and 2010s  Girls in Buenos Aires waving their green handkerchief in support of the legalization of abortion, August 8, 2018. The most recent wave of Argentinian feminism has become one of the largest women's movements in Latin American history. Focusing on such issues as the access to legal and safe abortions, increasing access to contraceptives, the professionalization of women's work, the equalization of the salary disparity between men and women, lowering the rates of femicide, increasing women's representation in major institutions, expanding maternal leave, rethinking society with feminist theory in mind, and emboldening the voice of women. This new wave of feminist activism is sometimes referred as \\"the revolution of the daughters\\" (Spanish: la revoluci√≥n de las hijas). The term was coined by journalist Luciana Peker and refers to the preponderance of adolescents in the movement, which she considers to be the \\"fruit of a construction of more than thirty years of feminism, of a tradition of three decades of Encuentros de Mujeres and of a horizontal, federal and autonomous way of doing politics.\\" Prominent modern movements include the Ni Una Menos campaign and the pro-choice rallies. Ni una menos stems from the killing of Lucia Perez, and the larger issue of femicide in Argentina. The modern pro-choice rallies generally stem from issues surrounding women's safety. For example, in late 2018, an 11-year-old girl was made pregnant and subsequently refused access to an abortion. The provincial health secretary, Gustavo Vigliocco, defended this decision, claiming that the girl and her family wanted the baby. Eventually, the young girl had to have an emergency cesarean section, 23 weeks into her pregnancy. Modeled after the past Mothers Movement's triangular headscarf, the green handkerchief or pa√±uelo verde began as a symbol used in pro-choice rallies, but has expanded in meaning to be symbolic of the feminist movement as a whole. The use of the green handkerchief as a feminist distinction became immensely popular during 2018 and has become part of the country's social imaginary. It is traditionally worn around the neck during feminist demonstrations, but can now be seen on a daily basis hanging from bags, backpacks, balconies or even used around the wrist or to tie hair. Given the heterogeneity of current Argentine feminism, conflicts and debates have arisen within the movement. One of the most prominent is the one referring to sex work and prostitution. This debate has risen on the agenda due to the participation of key figures heavily invested on the issue: on one hand sex worker activists and on the other, several prominent leaders of the LGBT movement that advocate the abolition of sex work.

Historically, the unnamed island was under the administration of the Municipality of the Islands, it is however now divided into the Taipa, Coloane and Cotai districts. The Macau Peninsula was once an island on the Pearl River Delta. It has linked to Mainland China as a result of sedimentation to become a peninsula a couple of thousand-years ago. Apart from this case, all of the Macanese former islands were merged either to the Macau Peninsula or the newly unnamed island directly or indirectly as the result of artificial land reclamation.

Its operating company Spark Energy Supply Ltd entered administration in November 2018, and industry regulator Ofgem appointed OVO Energy to take over Spark Energy's 290,000 customer accounts; OVO continues to run Spark as a separate brand. History Spark Energy began in 2007 as a small start-up company. The board's background was in the letting industry and they started Spark Energy to fill a gap in the utility market to meet the needs of letting agents, landlords and tenants. The company was established by Canadian entrepreneur PJ Darling, after research into the utilities and property management markets. Co-founder Chris Gauld was the primary driver and leader of the business during the early stages. Spark was based in a former converted mill building in Town hill after moving from Penlan in 2016. The company made its first profit in 2013. In January 2014 the firm signed a deal with Morgan Stanley. Further growth occurred, which the company attributed to investment in its customer services and marketing. Some rebranding also took place, including the introduction of the tagline 'Bringing Energy to Life'. In Spring 2014, Gauld was appointed as chief executive after Darling sold his stake in the business. In 2014 they were placed 23rd on the Sunday Times Fast Track 100, the highest-ranked Scottish company on the list. Spark had a long relationship with both Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Investment Bank, with the latter having invested around ¬£855,000 with the company since 2008. In 2015, Spark Energy reported a turnover of more than ¬£80million. the company was thought to be one of the five largest employers in the Scottish Borders, with over 300 staff based at their offices in Selkirk, 120 of whom are in customer care. In August 2015 the company recruited three senior executives, increasing the size of its leadership team. The company was granted a temporary derogation from regulator Ofgem from 22B.2(b) and paragraph 4 of SLC 22B of its gas and electricity supply licences in respect of the Affordable Social Housing Prepayment Tariff. In June 2016, the company announced that a management buyout, led by CEO Chris Gauld and CFO Hamish Osborn, was close to completion in a deal estimated to be worth in excess of ¬£50 million. In 2016, the company acquired a 50% stake in a Sussex-based telecoms company, Home Telecom Ltd, for an estimated ¬£3 million, as part of a mutual and existing relationship with Country Wide who owned the other 50% of the business. This saw the firm acquire approximately 14,000 telecoms customers. Spark Energy Supply ceased trading on 23 November 2018 following financial difficulties, including non-payment of ¬£14m to energy regulator Ofgem under the Renewables Obligation scheme. Ofgem appointed Bristol-based OVO Energy to take over the 290,000 customer accounts, and OVO also acquired Spark Energy Limited. OVO continues to use the Spark brand, and retained the company's Selkirk offices and staff. Issues While establishing itself in the marketplace, the company had attracted a substantial number of complaints. Their business model meant that tenants did not get to choose their supplier, with Spark Energy inheriting customers from property owners, demanding payments and forcing customers to have the firm as their energy supplier. BBC Radio 4‚Äôs You & Yours consumer programme revealed that Spark Energy employees had posed as some of these customers, moving people with chronic debts to other energy firms without their knowledge, using their personal details. In 2015 they were fined ¬£250,000 by Ofgem, after they were judged to have mistreated customers during the 2010‚Äì2013 period by impersonating customers to switch 'undesirable' customers from whom payment was difficult to collect, to other suppliers, a term known in the industry as 'erroneous transfers'. The company rebranded and undertook a several-year-long campaign in an attempt to revive their image and customer service practices, and in the 2014 Which? Switch energy satisfaction survey, Spark Energy outranked all of the \\"big six\\" providers. However, in the 2017 Which? survey Spark was ranked 30th out of 31 providers.

Origin of the copybook  In ancient times, famous calligraphy was carved in stone. Later, people made rubbings of the stone on paper so that they could copy and learn the famous calligraphy. The emperor of Liang Dynasty, Xiao Yan, made a rubbing of one thousand characters from the famous calligrapher Wang Xizhi, and made sentences and paragraphs for the one thousand characters, which became known as the Thousand Character Classic. Later the Thousand Character Classic became a systematic copybook.  Classification  Copybooks can be divided according to the style of calligraphy and the kind of pen used. The styles of calligraphy that are used in copybooks include the regular script (Ê•∑Êõ∏, Ê•∑‰π¶Ôºâ, the cursive scriptÔºàËçâÊõ∏, Ëçâ‰π¶Ôºâ, the running scriptÔºàË°åÊõ∏, Ë°å‰π¶Ôºâ, the clerical scriptÔºàÈö∏Êõ∏, Èö∂‰π¶Ôºâ, and the seal scriptÔºàÁØÜÊõ∏, ÁØÜ‰π¶Ôºâ. Most calligraphy is for brushes, but there is also hard calligraphy, using ballpoint pens, pencils, or fountain pens.  Modern role  Today children in China who enter school would have a copybook for learning characters. Because they just learn writing for a short time, it is hard for children to write characters in their own style. Copybooks can help children practice different font of handwriting and build their own style. If people want to learn calligraphy, besides the Four Treasures of the Study, they also need to prepare copybooks which the type of font is what they want to learn. Because the choice of copybooks would decide the style people write in. There are also copybooks that are online with the option to enter your own characters and create your own copybook.  Steps  * Read: When first see a character, read the fond, the structure, the order of strokes, analyze the relationship between the strokes and figure out the feature of the character. * Trace: Learners can just write on the book or use transparent paper cover the characters and copy it, which is also known as shadow copy writing. * Copy: Put the copybook aside, and try best to write the characters exactly what they looks on another paper. * Remember: Remember the character in the mind and write on the paper without looking at the copybook. * Create: After grasping the writing on the copybook, learners can create their own style.  Other  Since Yin Dynasty, it became popular to engrave words on stone to make them spread further and longer, but not calligraphy. Since Tang Dynasty, people began to save the beauty of calligraphy on the stone. So rubbing calligraphy was popular in that time. Before the development of new technology, calligraphy can only be learned by using stone rubbings. However, there had to be some mistakes. The new technology, Jingying Technology, actually helps learners a lot because the rubbing is much more like the original calligraphy.

She founded the Women of the [Hispanic] race and led the faction of more moderate feminists in the 1920s in Mexico. Biography G. Sof√≠a Villa de Buentello was a Mexican feminist. She was probably a teacher, as most of the attendees at the 1916 First Feminist Congress of Yucat√°n were teachers and it was a requirement of attendance that women be educated. Her publications list her as a \\"professor\\" and other sources state she was a lawyer, though she indicated in a 1925 interview with The New York Times that she had only a secondary education. Married and a mother ‚Äî her books are dedicated to her husband, Edmundo E. Buentello, and her children Miguel Edmundo and Sof√≠a ‚Äî Villa de Buentello was not a submissive wife. She publicly called for a change in women‚Äôs marital dependency and the domestic limits placed by society upon women. Soon after the Congresses, in 1917 President Carranza‚Äôs ‚ÄúLaw on Family Affairs (Domestic Relations)‚Äù was passed. In her analysis of the legislation, Villa pointed out that prior to its passage, the Civil Code was discriminatory. In the event that a child was born out of wedlock, if a woman who gave up her child to prevent stigma and shaming, she alone could be identified. The previous law had allowed maternity investigations so that orphans could find their birth mothers, but forbade paternity investigations. In 1921 she published a book, La Mujer y la Ley (The Woman and the Law), which asked whether men and women were equal before the law in Mexico. Though the analysis was moderate in tone, Villa de Buentello stated that regardless of social or economic status, everyone must be viewed equally before the law. Considering that women did not have suffrage, it was considered revolutionary. She may have been influenced by Genaro Garc√≠a, a lawyer who had made a similar statement 30 years earlier, according to Carmen Ramos Escand√≥n.Cano, Gabriela. \\"Feminism\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 482. While Villa de Buentello was known for her less radical ideas, she was not truly a moderate. She and Elena Arizmendi Mejia established a cooperative union \\"Mujeres de la raza\\" (Women of the [Hispanic] Race) in 1923 with aims of uniting Latina women in the struggle for rights. At the time, Latin America was seen as the next \\"staging ground\\" as suffrage had been gained in Europe and the United States, but it was clear to Arizmendi after her attendance at the 1922 Pan-American Conference of Women that there was a lack of understanding from the Anglo-oriented perspective on Hispanic women's cultural influences. Villa and Arizmendi both saw matrimony and motherhood, an integral part of Latina identity, as making the experience of women \\"complete\\". That same year, she participated in the National Convention of Women held on May 27, 1923, in Mexico City. The conference was organized by the Pan American League and quickly split into two factions. The radical contingent from Yucat√°n, which urged the convention to adopt a program advocating the abolition of marriage, birth control, free love, and sex education, were aligned with Elena Torres Cu√©llar and Mar√≠a ‚ÄúCuca‚Äù del Refugio Garc√≠a. Villa rejected this premise and instead sought legal rights for women inside of marriage. She believed divorce caused stigma for women and was against it because even if innocent of wrongdoing, in a divorce the wife was deemed to have behaved inappropriately and punished by society. Her more moderate stance gained her support by the faction composed of teachers, Christian women‚Äôs society members, the delegation of the Pan American League and members from US associations. At the close of the National Convention on Women, Villa and Arizmendi determined to hold a conference for the Mujeres de la raza and organized a meeting for the International League of Iberian and Latin American Women for 1925. Arizmendi used her press contracts and secured coverage in the New York Times to promote the event. On Sunday, March 2, 1924, an extensive article about the feminist movement in Mexico entitled ‚ÄúNew Women of Mexico Striving for Equality‚Äù carried an interview with Villa de Buentello giving an overview of their goals. The meeting occurred in July, 1925 in Mexico City with Villa as President of the conference. Arizmendi served as Secretary General, but did not attend due to a difference of opinion with Villa. In attendance were Rosa Maria Anders, a Cuban lawyer; Carmen Burgos of Spain; Natalia Costa de Gori, of Guatemala; Eva Maria V. de Gytina, of Panama; and Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Montenegro of Nicaragua, among others. From within Mexico were delegates from Oaxaca, San Luis Potos√≠, Magdalena Salazar Venegas with the National University, Rosaura Sansores with the Liga de Maestros (Teachers League) from Morelos, and Rosa Torre Gonz√°lez from the government of Yucat√°n. Villa came into conflict as before with \\"Cuca\\" Garcia and the more radical delegates over her views on marriage. During heated discussion, Villa closed the conference. There was protest by the delegates, who refused to accept her autocratic decision and continued working. The final twelve resolutions were founded upon traditions and morals, one even proposing that older women serve as moral guides for younger women during outings. They asked for civil, legal, social and economic equality, as well as the right to vote and hold public office. Villa de Buentello‚Äôs work shows the contradictions which existed for this group of feminists. On the one hand, she wanted to expand the sphere of women, but on the other, she wanted to remain within the bounds of tradition. She wanted a woman's strengths and ability to work to be recognized, but only so that they could give her the freedom to express herself within marriage and motherhood. She challenged the notion of male leadership, but at the same time acknowledged the husband as head of the household. She argued for equality under the law, but only so that women would have protections within their marriages, no matter how bad those marriages might be. In 1929, Villa petitioned President Emilio Portes Gil to allow women to count the ballots in the November elections. Selected works *La Mujer y la Ley.

Launch operations   Contract and scheduling  In addition to the earlier SES-8 mission ordered in 2011 and launched in 2013, SES contracted SpaceX for three additional launches starting with SES-9, originally planned for 2015. The deal was announced on 12 September 2012. In early 2015, SES S.A. announced that it would be the launch customer of the next rocket evolution by SpaceX: Falcon 9 v1.1 Full Thrust (also called Falcon 9 v1.2, and later, just Falcon 9 Full Thrust). At the time, SES expected SES-9 to be launched by September 2015. Despite the failure of the CRS-7 mission in June 2015, SES re-confirmed in September 2015 their decision to provide the first payload for the new rocket variant; however the launch was postponed until late 2015. Eventually, after considering all options, SpaceX announced a change on 16 October 2015: Orbcomm's 11 Orbcomm- OG2 satellites would be the payload on the return-to-flight mission of the redesigned rocket instead of SES-9. The Orbcomm payload with its lower orbit would allow SpaceX to test relighting the second-stage engine, a capability required to successfully put the heavier SES-9 on a geostationary orbit. The Orbcomm mission was subsequently delayed to mid-December 2015, while SES-9 was scheduled to follow \\"within a few weeks\\". Finally, Falcon 9 Full Thrust performed its maiden launch on 22 December 2015, the final launch of the Falcon 9 v1.1 variant followed in January 2016, with SES-9 moving to February 2016. Consequently, this was the second launch of the Full Thrust variant.  Launch attempts  A successful static fire test of the rocket was completed on 22 February 2016.

Subsequently, the launch was rescheduled for the evening of 28 February 2016 at 23:47 UTC, with a fallback slot same time next day.

Rising oxygen temperature due to the hold for the tugboat to clear and a suspected helium bubble, the two are related: the helium bubble in the warmer LOX was affected by the earlier launch attempt, when the stage was pressurized (with helium) for some time, increasing the saturation of helium gas into the liquid oxygen, which could then bubble out when the turbopumps began rapidly drawing oxidizer from the tank for the launch (and lowering tank pressure in the zone around the turbopump inlet),were suggested by Elon Musk as the likely reasons for the alarm being triggered. The next launch attempt on 1 March 2016 was postponed to 4 March 2016 due to high winds. Falcon 9 Flight 22 launching on 4 March 2016, carrying SES-9. The launch was finally attempted, and succeeded, on 4 March 2016 at 23:35:00 UTC.  Orbit adjustment  The original apogee for the transfer orbit contracted by SpaceX was , a subsynchronous highly-elliptical orbit that SES would then circularize and raise over several months before the satellite would be ready for operational service at . SES CTO Martin Halliwell indicated in February 2016 that SpaceX had agreed to add additional energy to the spacecraft with the launch vehicle and that a new apogee of approximately was the objective, in order to assist SES in the satellite becoming operational many weeks earlier than otherwise possible,  Post-mission landing test  Following word from SES that SpaceX had allocated some of the normal propellant reserve margins for landing to placing the SES-9 satellite in a higher (and more energetic) orbit than originally planned, SpaceX confirmed in February that they would still attempt a secondary goal of executing a controlled-descent and vertical landing flight test of the first stage on the SpaceX east-coast Autonomous spaceport drone ship (floating landing platform) named Of Course I Still Love You. Although SpaceX successfully recovered a first booster on land following the December launch to a less-energetic orbital trajectory, they had not yet succeeded in booster recovery from any of the previous attempts to land on a floating platform. Because the SES-9 satellite was very heavy and was going to such a high orbit, SpaceX indicated prior to launch that they did not expect this landing to succeed. As expected, booster recovery failed: the spent first stage \\"landed hard\\", damaging the drone ship, but the controlled-descent and atmospheric re-entry, as well as navigation to a point in the Atlantic ocean over away from the launch site, were successful and returned significant test data on bringing back a high-energy Falcon 9. The controlled descent through the atmosphere and landing attempt for each booster is an arrangement that is not used on other orbital launch vehicles.SES CTO Martin Halliwell had informed SpaceX that they were willing to use the same rocket twice to power another satellite to orbit. This idea became reality in March 2017 with the SES-10 mission flying with the reused booster from CRS-8. By 21 March 2016, the hole in the deck of the drone ship had been nearly repaired.

Unfree labour in California existed as a system technically different but similar to chattel slavery. While California's state constitution outlawed slavery the 1850 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians which allowed the indenture of Native Californians. The act allowed for a system of custodianship for indigenous children and a system of convict leasing. These systems were backed by the legalized corporal punishment of any Native Californian, and the stripping of many legal rights of Native Californians.  Background   Spanish California  Pre-European contact, the population of native Californian Indians estimates vary, ranging from 300,000 to nearly one million. In 1542, Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first landed in California, but the region wasn't successfully settled by the Spanish until 1769. In 1769, Padre Jun√≠pero Serra founded the first Spanish mission in California, el Misi√≥n San Diego de Alcal√°. The padres would often baptize Native Californian villages and relocate them to the missions, where they would work either voluntarily or by force from location to location. There, Native Californians became cobblers, carpenters, masons, planters, harvesters, and cattle slaughterers. To the padres, the Native Californians were newly baptized members of the Catholic Church and were treated with varying amounts of respect, depending on the priest in question. Reportedly, some of the missions planned on handing the missions over to the Native Americans after ten years. However, this never occurred. Many of the soldiers, however, saw them solely as manpower to be exploited. The soldiers would force the Native Californians to perform most of the manual labor needed in their fortresses, and would hunt down any natives who tried to escape. These four military installations, primarily in place to reinforce Spanish claims to Alta California, were known as el Presidio Real de San Carlos de Monterey, el Presidio Real de San Diego, el Presidio Real de San Francisco, and el Presidio Real de Santa B√°rbara. The soldiers would often rape the native women of the villages. There were several recorded uprisings of Indians resisting Spanish rule, one of the earliest being the attack on the Mission San Diego de Alcala on November 4, 1775. The Tipai-Ipai organized nine villages into a force of around 800 people to destroy the mission and kill three of the Spanish, one of them being Padre Luis Jayme. However, not every uprising was violent. In September 1795, over two hundred natives, including many old neophytes, simply deserted San Francisco all in different directions. When uprisings occurred, the natives did not go unpunished: some Indians were put to death. The padres treated Indians and Native Americans as slaves.  Mexican California  From 1821 to 1846, after Mexico gained its independence from Spain, California was under Mexican rule. In 1824, the Mexican constitution guaranteed citizenship to all persons, providing natives with the right to continue occupying their villages. Additionally, the Mexican National Congress passed the Colonization Act of 1824 which granted large sections of unoccupied land to individuals. This act enforced a class division in which Native Americans were treated like slaves because the native Californians became the labor force for these ranchos. In 1833, the government secularized missions, saying that the missions needed to give their land to catholic Indians. Instead of doing that, however, many civil authorities confiscated most of the land for themselves. Californios often gained prominence by conducting military attacks on indigenous settlements. By 1846, Mexico's Assembly had passed resolutions calling for funds to locate and destroy Indian villages. While they had more rights than they had under Spanish rule, the native population still was the labor force for ranchos or in developing towns. Essentially, the entire economy shifted from work on the missions to work on large land estates of wealthy Mexicans.  History  Settlement of California Native California Population, according to Cook 1978. Anglo-American settlers had begun flooding California from the 1820s and, following a brief period of independence, California was officially acquired by the United States in 1848, bringing in more Anglo immigrants due to the gold rush. Although the indigenous population of California under Spanish rule dropped from 300,000 prior to 1769, to 250,000 in 1834, this was primarily due to contact with Old World diseases and assimilation. After gaining independence from Spain in 1821 and the secularization of the coastal missions by the Mexican government in 1834, the indigenous population suffered a much more drastic decrease in population. Indeed, the period immediately following the U.S. conquest of California has been characterized by numerous sources as a genocide. Under US sovereignty, after 1848, the Indian population plunged from perhaps 150,000 to 30,000 in 1870 and reached a low of 16,000 in 1900. California Genocide The Anglo-Americans came in with an initial dislike of the Native Americans, hating and fearing them for no historical reason. The confrontation between Anglos and Indians was often brutal, resulting in the murder, burn and rape of native Californians; kidnapping and selling of women and children into slavery was also commonly practiced. In those 10 years the Indian population of the Central Valley and adjacent hills and mountains decreased from around 150,000 to 50,000. Many hostile interactions began to occur such as the Clear Lake Massacre of 1849. At the Clear Lake Massacre, local Pomo killed two white men who had been exploiting local Indians, enslaving them and abusing them and sexually assaulting Indian women. As a result, the whites created a massive military campaign of savagery and brutality. On the April 22, 1850, to \\"craft its own code of compulsory labor\\", an \\"Act for the Government and Protection of Indians\\" was passed which legally curtailed rights of Indians. Between 1851 and 1852, the federal government appointed three Indian commissioners - Redick McKee, George W. Barbour, and O. M. Wozencraft - to negotiate treaties with the California Indians because Native American tribes were recognized as foreign nations, making treaties the legal form of negotiation. The commissioners knew nothing about the California Indians or their cultures, making the process very difficult. Eventually, 18 treaties were drafted, allocating 7.5% of the state of California to Indians in reservations, but forcing them to give up the rest of their land. In June 1852, however, all of the treaties were rejected by the Senate and then put into secret files; they were not to be seen again until 1905. Military campaigns against these Indians often led to the indiscriminate murders of Indians; their goals were to essentially exterminate the Indians. Monetary rewards were often offered for the heads and scalps of Indian people. There were many whites who did deeply lament the \\"oppression\\" that was placed upon the Indians. In 1860, the Act was amended to allow any Indians who were not already indentured to be kidnapped under the guise of apprenticeship. Also in 1860, an army officer at Fort Humboldt observed \\"cold-blooded Indian killing being considered honorable, shooting Indians and murdering even squaws and children that have been domesticated for months and years, without a moment's warning and with as little compunction as they would rid themselves of a dog.\\" On February 16, the Indian Island Massacre occurred when the newly created Humboldt Volunteer Militia paddled to Indian Island where the Wiyot men and women slept after a week of ceremonial dancing. With hatchets, clubs and knives, the militia killed 80-100 Wiyot men and women. Two other raids occurred that night, causing 200-600 Wiyot casualties. In an 1867 analysis done for the Secretary of War, it was noted that the rapid advancement of white settlements had greatly limited the sources of fish, wild fowl, game, nuts and roots. At that point, the Indians were forced into collisions with the whites and often needed to choose between stealing or starvation. By 1870, the population had declined from 40,000 at the time of the United States acquisition of California to 20,000. Thousands of Indians had been murdered, raped or sold into slavery. Later in 1900, the Native American population in California was reported to be around 16,000. Abolition During the American Civil War various political factions in opposition to slavery and other forms of unfree labour united as the Union Party and began to slowly dismantle unfree labour systems in California. Republicans had decried the kidnapping and forced apprenticeship of Native Americans but still viewed the arrests and leasing of Native Americans as a necessary evil to civilize them. In 1863 after the declaration of the Emancipation Proclamation lawmakers in California ended all forms of legal indenture and apprenticeship for Native Americans. Illegal slave raiding and holding continued afterwards but died out around 1870. The end came due to the increase in European and Chinese immigrants that served as cheap laborers, and the massive reduction of California's indigenous population. Labour system Illegal practices In general, Californians interpreted these 1850 laws in a way that all Indians could face indentured servitude through arrests and \\"hiring out\\". Once the Indians had entered into this servitude, the term limit was often ignored, thus resulting in slavery; this was what Californians used to \\"satisfy the states high demand for domestic servants and agricultural laborers\\". Kidnapping raids became common place, these raids were done to acquire indigenous people that settlers could press into servitude. Although technically an illegal practice, law enforcement rarely intervened. The well-being of those in forced labor was often easily disregarded since laborers could be acquired for prices as cheap as 35 dollars. Acting Governor Richard B. Mason reported that, \\"over half the miners in California were Indians\\". The enforcement of the Act of 1850 was left with the local justices of peace, meaning they became crucial links in all interracial interactions. Many justices took advantage of the vague language and the power bestowed upon them to continue the kidnapping of Indian children through 1860. An illegal trade of kidnapped slaves existed and was rarely stopped, it was only policed after the abolition of the unfree labour systems. Laws The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians was passed in California in 1850, It provided that: * \\"White persons or proprietors could apply to the Justice of Peace for the removal of Indians from lands in the white person's possession\\" * \\"Any person could go before a Justice of Peace to obtain Indian children for indenture. The Justice determined whether or not compulsory means were used to obtain the child. If the Justice was satisfied that no coercion occurred, the person obtain a certificate that authorized him to have the care, custody, control and earnings of an Indian until their age of majority (for males, eighteen years, for females, fifteen years).\\" In actual practice this section lead to a trade system of kidnapped Indian children, either stolen from their parents or taken from the results of militia attacks during the 1850s and 1860s. Frontier whites often eagerly paid $50‚Äì$100 for Indian children to apprentice and so groups of kidnappers would often raid isolated Indian villages, snatching up children in the chaos of battle. * \\"If a convicted Indian was punished by paying a fine, any white person, with the consent of the Justice, could give bond for the Indian's fine and costs. In return, the Indian was \\"compelled to work until his fine was discharged or cancelled.\\" The person bailing was supposed to \\"treat the Indian humanely, and clothe and feed him properly.\\" The Court decided \\"the allowance given for such labor.\\"\\" Local authorities were often required to hire out the \\"convicts\\" within the next 24 hours to the highest bidder essentially creating a system of selling slaves out of jail. * Indians could not testify for or against whites. It was illegal to sell or administer alcohol to Indians and if Indians were convicted of stealing any valuable or livestock, they could receive any number of lashes (as long as it was less than 25) and a fine of up to $200. Labour roles Not many surviving documents exist for historians to analyze how prevalent and how California's unfree labour system worked, however various estimates have been made of the surviving accounts and documents. The Gold Rush brought many American migrants to California, this population increase required an increase in food production. Many bound laborers are thought to have been used in California's new agricultural economy. A majority of the laborers leased were Native women and children, who were leased in response to California's population shortage of white women and children,many would serve as domestic workers.

She studied art at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and in Paris at Acad√©mie Julian. Clements also studied science at Cornell University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree. She created murals, painted portraits, and made etchings. Clements taught in Philadelphia and in Baltimore at Bryn Mawr School. Her works have been exhibited in the United States and at the Paris Salon. Clements works are in several public collections. Her life companion was fellow artist Ellen Day Hale. Early life Gabrielle de Veaux Clements was born in Philadelphia in 1858. Her parents were Dr. Richard Clements and Gabriella DeVeaux. Her mother Gabriella DeVeaux was from South Carolina. American Revolutionary War hero, General Francis Marion, her maternal ancestor, was called \\"Swamp Fox\\". Clements attended Miss Longstreth's school in Philadelphia and developed an interest in art as a teenager. Education Samuel Hill, 1889 In 1875, Clements attended the Philadelphia School of Design for Women in Philadelphia under Charles Page, with whom she studied lithography. She then attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York from 1876 to 1880, where she studied science, made scientific drawings, and received her Bachelor of Science degree. Her senior thesis was A Study of Two German Masters in Medieval Art, D√ºrer and Holbein. After completing her studies at Cornell, Clements returned to Philadelphia and attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1881 to 1882, under Thomas Eakins. She won the school's Toppan Prize. Stephen Parrish taught her to be an etcher in 1883. She produced a number of lithographs and scientific drawings during her school years. In 1883, she met who would become her travel and life companion, American Impressionist Ellen Day Hale. About 1884, she attended Acad√©mie Julian in Paris. Clements studied under William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Tony Robert-Fleury. Hale came to Paris with be with her. In 1885, Clements exhibited at the Paris Salon and as the women traveled through France, Clements taught Hale to etch. Career Painter and etcher Edmondo De Amicis, 1898, etching In 1883, Clements began working professionally, making prints and exhibiting her works. She created the appearance of 3-dimensions by overlapping, or interposition, in Church and Castle, Mont Saint-Michel (1885). In 1888, Clements exhibited 20 of her works at The Work of Women Etchers of America show held by the Union League of New York, led on by Sylvester Rosa Koehler. Held at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it was the first show held at a museum of women's works of art. David Tatham considered the exhibitions led by Koehler in the late 1880s to be \\"ground-breaking women etcher's shows\\". Her etchings were based upon modern French techniques, like a la poup√©e, and were influenced by Woodblock printing in Japan and the works of James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Clement made a portrait of Edmondo De Amicis, which was printed in an extra volume of etchings and photogravures to his 1888 book Spain and the Spaniards. She illustrated a book of verses entitled Easter Song by Charlotte Pendleton, which was published in 1892. Clements painted sea, city and landscapes of places in the United States, like Cape Ann, Massachusetts and Baltimore, Maryland and other locations along the American East Coast. She also captured foreign destinations, like Palestine, Algiers, and France. During her career, her work was exhibited at a number of venues, some of which are the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, National Academy of Design, Philadelphia Society of Artists, National Museum of American History, and New York Etching Club. Clements' etchings were exhibited at international exhibitions alongside the works of Francis Seymour Haden and James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Clement exhibited her work at the Woman's Building and the Pennsylvania State Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. She also exhibited at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904, and the Sesquicentennial Exposition in 1926. Muralist Clements painted five murals for churches in Washington, D.C., and in Baltimore she painted views of the city for Bendann Galleries and a mural of Oh, praise ye the Lord, al ye His angels. Clements also painted murals in Detroit, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Her mural, Harvest, was made for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and the work of art is now in the Cape Ann Museum collection and was conserved during a 2009 to 2010 exhibition at the museum. In 1910, she made a mural on canvas. In 2014, it was in the process of being restored at the Hugh McCall Mansion, site of the Women's Club of York, Pennsylvania. The plan was also to frame it in a 400-pound wood frame. Educator She taught art at Baltimore's The Bryn Mawr School from 1895 to 1908. There she taught new techniques, like working with aquatint and color etching, by the turn of the 20th century, etching was not a profitable endeavor. She also taught art in Philadelphia. Clements taught print making, etching, and painting in Charleston, South Carolina with Hale during the winters during World War I or more specifically, from 1916 to 1920. They helped inspire the creation of the Charleston Etchers' Club and influence the Charleston Renaissance and over time the works of Lesley Jackson, Alice Ravenel Huger Smith, and Elizabeth O'Neill Verner. Personal and public life Beginning about 1880, Clements assisted Eliza Sproat Turner and Florence Kelley in the establishment of New Century Guild of Philadelphia. It offered educational classes and programs for working women. Hale and Clements vacationed and painted together during the summers at a house they bought, \\"The Thickets\\" in an artist's enclave in Folly Cove on Cape Ann, Massachusetts. In addition to Charleston, South Carolina, Clements and Hale traveled to Europe during the winter months. Margaret Lesley Bush-Brown, who was one of Clements' students; Cecilia Beaux; and Lilian Westcott Hale, Ellen Day Hale's sister-in-law; were their friends. Death She died in 1948 at Rockport, Folly Cove, Massachusetts on March 26, 1948. Her works were exhibited 1994‚Äì95 at the Washington Print Club Thirtieth Anniversary Exhibition: Graphic Legacy and in 2005 at the Revival and the Professional Woman Artist, both of which were conducted by the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Her sketchbooks, correspondence, photographs, and other papers are in the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution.

It was named in 1916 for the recently deceased Dr. Robert Graves Howell, who was mayor when the first grammar school was built. A second school was built in 1911, and Howell was replaced by Minnie T. Heard Elementary School in 1942. After being used by the Salvation Army during World War II, the building was converted for use as a textile mill in 1947. A number of companies operated out of the building until 1952, when the Dothan Manufacturing Company took over the property. A one-story addition was constructed on the front of the building in 1965, obscuring the fa√ßade. The plant closed in 1997, and was sold to the Southern Alabama Regional Council on the Aging in 2003, before the city re-acquired it in 2008. The building combines Romanesque Revival and Renaissance Revival styles. The front fa√ßade originally had a mansard roofed tower, which was later removed. The outer three bays as well as the center bay project slightly, and are separated by pilasters with Corinthian terra cotta capitals. The entablature contains a plain architrave and frieze separated by a terra cotta band, and a pressed metal cornice with modillions. On the main fa√ßade, two dormers project from the hipped roof, while gabled dormers with round vents pierce the roof on the ends. A wing projects from the center of the rear of the building.

The building is significant for its association with the burley tobacco industry in Lexington, Kentucky between 1930 and 1980 and is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Fayette County, Kentucky. History After the end of World War I, Lexington positioned itself as the largest burley tobacco market in the state, a position that was strengthened by its increase in the number of tobacco warehouse being built across the city. This new surge in the consumption of burley tobacco is what drove Liggett and Myers to build a new tobacco facility in Lexington in 1930. A newspaper article announcing the construction of the $100,000 warehouse stated that Liggett and Myers plan \\"to use the warehouse as a storage plant for tobacco here and awaiting shipment to their factories. The new warehouse will be completed and put into use by the opening of the tobacco season here this winter\\". The warehouse, located along Manchester Street and the L&N; Railroad, was named for Liggett and Myers' head buyer in Kentucky, F. G. Harpring of Louisville. The new warehouse joined a line of other tobacco-related structures in Lexington's northwest tobacco district. A November 1930 article in the Lexington Leader touted the scope and scale of the Harpring Storage Warehouse. \\"One of the largest and finest roofing and sheet metal jobs ever done in this part of the country is now being completed by the James D. Harper firm, 724 West Short Street, on the new Liggett and Myers tobacco warehouse on the Old Frankfort Pike.\\" The article detailed the amount of metal used, which given the size of the warehouse, is impressive: \\"1 ,200 squares of Baird‚Äôs Specification roofing; 1,900 lineal feet of Baird‚Äôs flashing; 1,200 lineal feet of molded gutters; 600 feet of downspout; 300 feet of corrugated iron siding and 150 squares of screen wire.\\" The Harpring Storage Warehouse represented a major financial investment on the part of Liggett and Myers. The warehouse cost $100,000 to build. Between 1930 and the start of World War II, the urban tobacco landscape in Lexington grew dramatically. The consolidation in the tobacco markets meant that Lexington, a rail and road hub, benefited from a building boom of new, mostly metal-clad warehouses. This includes both sales and storage warehouses. The introduction of the metal-clad steel-frame brick-firewall storage warehouse with multiple sections under one roof, rippled throughout Lexington's burley storage landscape. The Harpring Warehouse began receiving tobacco during the 1930 sales season, and its design was quickly co-opted by other companies. In 1931, other national tobacco firms commenced building similar storage warehouses. The Harpring Storage Warehouse was built at a pivotal time for Liggett and Myers, at least in terms of burley tobacco production. The burley tobacco market brought in more than $17 million in 1930, a year when the volume of burley at local warehouses shattered all records. Twenty sales warehouses in Lexington contained more than 9 million pounds of tobacco, while \\"another million were on wagons and trucks on streets, unable to find room in the warehouses.\\" The impacts on the local economy were noticeable. Beyond the men who worked in the warehouses, and the growers themselves, Lexington's businesses prospered during the winter months of selling. The warehouse itself was one of the first concrete floor tobacco warehouses in Kentucky and was considered to be the \\"gold standard\\" by which other tobacco warehouses were measured. In December 1931, the Lexington Leader carried a story about the spike in automobile sales during the sales season. Local car dealers reported an increase in both new and used-car sales, and the buyers came from far and wide, with at least one out-of-state grower buying a new car with his proceeds from selling his tobacco at the Lexington warehouses. The tobacco warehouses of Lexington, however, fell mostly silent during World War II. Labor shortages translated into a sharp drop in tobacco production, and many warehouses in urban areas underwent transformation into storage for war supplies. E.J. O'Brien and Company, which had are-drying and re-handling facility and a hogshead tobacco warehouse at the corner of South Broadway and Virginia Avenue, underwent a conversion to manufacturing parachutes during World War II. Throughout the 1960s; parades were held to celebrate the role of burley tobacco in the local economy, and the sales warehouse was a busy and festive place to be from Thanksgiving through January. Lexington's population increased during the sales season and local businesses benefitted from the influx of growers with ready cash, warehouse operators seeking to form new relationships, and buyers flocking to town to get the most leaf tor the best price. The forces which allowed Lexington to rise to such heights within the burley tobacco industry contributed to the town's gradual demise as a tobacco center in the late 1970s. During that decade and into the 1980s, tobacco companies nationally began \\"merging small tobacco facilities to form more modem facilities in central locations.\\" Liggett and Myers was the first national tobacco company to leave Lexington in the late 1970s. According to Rogers' nomination, the Liggett and Myers Tobacco Re-handling Plant on Bolivar closed in the 1960s. The company sold the building to a private individual in 1973. Lorillard announced closure of its storage warehouses in Lexington in 1983, intending to consolidate with facilities in Danville, Virginia and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Brown and Williamson left Lexington in 1984, when it consolidated its Lexington operations and moved them to North Carolina. From 1980 to 2007, the warehouse was primarily used as general storage. In 2007, the warehouse was purchased and used as an antique mall until 2011. In December 2012, the building was purchased at auction by Kevin McCloud. The two current tenants are Teak Closeouts and Cabinet Kings. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Fayette County, Kentucky on March 27, 2013. Description The Harpring Warehouse is a steel- frame metal-clad on a poured concrete floor rectangular storage warehouse, with space for over 20,000 hogsheads of tobacco and the current condition of the site has not changed much since the original building was completed, though the two water towers once located on either end of the warehouse are gone. The gable roof, originally clad in a wood sheathing and built-up tar, peaks at 25 feet at the ridgeline, and 18 feet high along the sides. The ceiling inside the warehouse is tongue and groove wood boards. The facade of the warehouse faces east, and the current owner commissioned a local artist to paint a mural on the metal siding on that end. A small shed addition juts out from the east elevation; this was presumably built at a later date to accommodate administrative needs. On the north side of this addition are three garage bays with metal rolling doors. The first door features a drive-up ramp so that trucks could enter the warehouse, while the two subsequent doors are designed for loading and unloading with no ramp. Three of the five brick firewalls feature a brick face pierced by two sliding doors; the doors lead into the warehouse space on either side of the firewall. The brick elevation has a parapet wall topped with metal coping. Beneath the parapet and above each sliding door is a brick inset that contains fiberglass for a transom-like effect. On the north elevation, each entryway is accessed by an elevated platform covered with a shed roof. The west elevation, leading into section six of the warehouse, has one garage bay entrance. This section is built at an angle so trucks could drive directly into the warehouse. On the south elevation, a later elevated walkway system connects the three sets of entryways. The south elevation of the warehouse features six shed-roofed extensions from the main wall that contain elements of the original sprinkler system. These small additions are constructed of brick with poured concrete tops, and sheathed in corrugated metal like the warehouse. On either side of the warehouse, are three fire hydrants. The two water towers were removed sometime before the 1980s. Remnants of the concrete that once held the mighty supports can still be seen. The water towers were installed to support the fire sprinkler suppression system. Interior The Harpring Storage Warehouse features a steel frame and poured concrete floor. The steel supports provide a very open floor plan, ideal for the storage of thousands of hogsheads. Each section is 190 feet long and 110 feet wide. In some of the warehouse sections, the corrugated metal siding has been sprayed with insulation. Sections of walls feature fiberglass instead of metal cladding; this additional light complemented the skylights present in each section. Five of the warehouse sections contain four large skylights each. A one-story, shed roofed detached brick boiler room is located at the west end of the warehouse and on the east side of the warehouse, the property features a freestanding 1000 square foot building used as a former guard house. This building housed two full-time security guards. The guard house is made exclusively of brick and a concrete ceiling/roof. The boiler was originally coal fired and the concrete floor of the warehouse is supposed to have a form of radiant heat. The boiler is non-operational today.

He is one of the six defendants in the Boudougate case. Resnick Brenner was unknown to the general public until Boudougate. He is accused of being responsible for managing an \\"outrageous\\" payment plan whereby the government would pay 240 million pesos that was owed by the printing firm Ciccone Calcogr√°fica to a collection agency. Early life Resnick Brenner was born in 1963 or 1964. In the 1990s he bought an apartment in the Belgrano district of Buenos Aires. Career Club de Campo Pueyrred√≥n As of January 1999, he was president of the Club de Campo Pueyrred√≥n, an exclusive residential area along the Pan American Highway near the city of Pilar. \\"The idea is to be able to live in peace without being inside a prison. It doesn't have to be a fortress to make you feel secure,\\" Resnick Brenner said about the club. Adevifta As of 2007, Resnick Brenner was working with Adevifta, the Argentinian Association for the Defense of Family Housing. Adevifra is a group of homeowners with mortgage debts dating back to the 1980s. Some sources identify him as director of that organization, while others described him as council for Adevifra. In August 2007, Resnick Brenner filed a complaint on behalf of Adevifra against two former Economy Ministers, Eduardo Elsztain and Felisa Miceli, accusing them of fraud and \\"breach of the duties of public officials to the detriment of public administration.\\" Specifically, the defendants were charged with involvement in a scheme whereby home purchasers receiving mortgages from the Hipotecario Bank were diverted to law firms that doubled or tripled their down payments. AFIP In 2009, Resnick Brenner was hired as chief of staff of the Federal Administration of Public Revenue (Administraci√≥n Federal de Ingresos P√∫blicos, or AFIP). His superior was Ricardo Echegaray, whom he had met at a rugby club. At the time he began the job, he had assets of 26,300 pesos. By 2010, according to information presented to the Anticorruption Office, Resnick Brenner had increased his assets by 4100%. He was chief of staff of AFIP until June 2011. Ciccone scandal Resnick Brenner was a key figure in the AFIP at the time of the Ciccone scandal. On October 19, 2010, the AFIP approved of the lifting of the bankruptcy of Argentina's largest printing firm, Ciccone Calcogr√°fica, and agreed on a payment plan that would permit the firm to resume printing. It was Resnick Brenner who recommended that Ciccone Calcogr√°fica be given a discount on its tax liabilities and who allegedly agreed to a payment plan that benefited Ciccone Calcogr√°fica after it filed for bankruptcy in 2010. La Naci√≥n later determined, based on telephone records, that Resnick Brenner had signed two opinions both of which supported the provision of funds for a payment plan for Ciccone. At least two government officials challenged Resnick Brenner's action on behalf of Ciccone Calcogr√°fica. The Director of Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Jos√© Guillermo Capdevila, challenged Resnick Brenner and reportedly got into trouble with the AFIP as a result. On November 9, 2010, in defiance of Capdevila, Boudou signed the recommendation to help Ciccone. The next day, Resnick Brenner asked the AFIP's legal department to approve the removal of capital. Experts stated in August 2012 that Resnick Brenner was more criminally responsible than the director of AFIP, Ricardo Echegaray, because it was he who had acted to remove Ciccone Calcogr√°fica's capital debt in November 2010, which was not a decision that he had any power to make. It was reported on May 31, 2014, that on July 17, 2014, Alejandro Vandenbroele and Resnick Brenner would have to appear in court. On June 12, 2014, Resnick Brenner was questioned by Judge Ariel Lijo. He presented Lijo with a written statement in which he declared that Amado Boudou, during his tenure as Minister of Economy, had sent his chief adviser, C√©sar Guido Forcieri, and his friend Jos√© Mar√≠a Nu√±ez Carmona to meet with Resnick Brenner to inquire about the procedure for granting Ciccone Calcogr√°fica a payment plan. Resnick Brenner said that he did not remember the date of the meeting. Clarin stated that Resnick Brenner's statement \\"seriously complicate[d]\\" matters for Boudou, who had sought to distance himself from the controversy surrounding lifting of the bankruptcy of Ciccone Calcogr√°fica. At his June 12 appearance before Lijo, Resnick Brenner asked the judge to dismiss him from the case. Resnick Brenner was indicted by Lijo on June 27, 2014. In 2014, Federal prosecutor Jorge Di Lello called for Resnick Brenner to be summoned for questioning. On February 19, 2015, Judges Jorge Ballestero, Eduardo Farah, and Eduardo Freiler of the Federal Criminal Appeals Court confirmed Judge Lijo's indictments of Boudou, N√∫√±ez Carmona, Alejandro Vandenbroele, Nicol√°s Ciccone, Resnick Brenner, and Forcieri. Salta After the Boudougate scandal broke in 2012, according to one source, Brenner was not fired from the AFIP but \\"ended up being rewarded,\\" as Hugo Alconada Moon, a columnist for La Naci√≥n and author of a book about Boudougate, stated. Resnick Brenner was put in charge of AFIP in the province of Salta, where he lives. Instead of living in a rented house or apartment, \\"as is the custom for those officials who are transferred to Salta from other provinces or from the federal capital,\\" Resnick Brenner was installed at the International Hotel Alejandro I, the province's most exclusive hotel. In August 2014, FM News reported that Resnick Brenner was living at the hotel, a five-star establishment on Belgrano Square in the center of Salta. A week later, Resnick Brenner confirmed that he was living at the hotel but said that he was paying a cheaper rate than people who stayed at the hotel for just a few nights. In addition to his address in Salta, Resnick Brenner continued to maintain his residences at Club de Campo Pueyrred√≥n and on calle Carlos Pellegrini in Buenos Aires. In addition, AFIP supplied him with a car and chauffeur. Asked about rumors that he was earning 75,000 pesos a month, Resnick Brenner said it was \\"slander.\\" Resnick Brenner's activities in Salta have led to controversy. \\"From the moment Resnick Brenner took office in Salta,\\" reports one source, he \\"launched a well-oiled machinery to squeeze entrepreneurs and farmers,\\" and began collecting \\"millions in bribes,\\" mostly in the vicinity of Oran, where officials of the Federal Court No. 2, located in that town, are suspected of being complicit in his activities. The shakedown process allegedly involves the leveling of false accusations of operational irregularities, such as the use of slave labor, and the issuing of threats of severe sanctions that can only be lifted through the payment of bribes. Resnick Brenner and his cohorts have reportedly \\"demanded bribes ranging from one million to 10 million pesos, depending on the size of the business or farm.\\" Some businessmen ended up in prison for several days for resisting Resnick Brenner's extortion efforts. Among other activities, Resnick Brenner ordered a raid on a 16,000-hectare farm in the department of Oran, and issued a report maintaining that 157 employees had been found to be working in deplorable conditions. In one case in which he claimed to have uncovered the use of slave labor, as well as \\"a 12-year-old working in very poor condition and people who did not eat for three days,\\" Resnick Brenner refused to identify the employers in question, purportedly for reasons of \\"tax secrecy.\\" Taxes As of 2014, Resnick Brenner, the former chief of staff of the Argentinian tax agency, was facing \\"two judgments for unpaid taxes in the province of Buenos Aires.\\" References Category:Argentine businesspeople Category:1960s births Category:Living people ","title":"Rafael Resnick Brenner"},{"id":"46200942","text":"Albert E.

Examples of combined words The lunar new year couplet pasted on a tsoo-tshu (Á•ñÂéù). A pair of chunlian, a horizontal red scroll and two doufang hung on the door of a village house. Fai chun (ÊèÆÊò•; pinyin: huƒ´ch≈´n) is a traditional decoration that is frequently used during Chinese New Year. People put fai chun in the doorways to create jubilant festive atmosphere since the phrases written on it means good luck and prosperity. Customarily, fai chun is written by hand but owing to convenience, printed versions are mass-produced nowadays. fai chun is in either square or rectangular shape. It can be hung vertically or horizontally. Not only does it exist in China, but also in Korea, Japan and Vietnam. History Fai chun originated from taofu (Ê°ÉÁ¨¶; peach wood charms) in ancient times. Peach wood charms are the long pieces of wood hung from peach trees. They are about seven to eight inches long and slightly more than one inch wide. According to the legend, there was a peach tree in the East China Sea that was the gate where the ghosts passed through between the underworld and the world of the living. Two gods, Shentu and Yulei, were responsible for guarding this gate. The ghosts travelling the world at night time were required to return to the underworld before the early morning. It was believed that the two gods could dispel all the demons which did harm to human at night time. People, therefore, used the peach wood to make two puppets of the two gods and put them at the entrance of their home in order to protect their family. Then, as early as the Han dynasty, people found that it was hard and complicated to make puppets, so they simplified the puppets to two peach wood boards on which they drew portraits of the gods. Later on, people simply wrote down the names of the gods on pieces of peach wood and hung them on both sides of the door. Around the Tang dynasty, commoners no longer wrote the names of the gods only but add some blessings to symbolize good fortune as well as express their hope and best wishes in the new year. Since Ming dynasty, pieces of peach wood were replaced by square red papers. There are another story which is related to Fai chun history. According to the legend, there was a monster lived in the deep sea and has a lion-like head and an ox-like body, who named Nian (Âπ¥). When the time around New Year, it scared the villagers and eating their crops, livestock and even villagers. At one time, during a rampage, Nian was seen running away from a house which had a red shirt hanging outside and then later, from a light. Consequently, the villagers discovered that the monster was afraid of red color, loud noise and flaming light. Since then, before every New Year, people paste red couplets in and outside their house, let off firecrackers and firework, in order to scare the monster away. After Nian back to the sea, people would come out and celebrate for the New Year. This become a tradition every year, people keep pasting red couplets every year, which is called Fai chun now. Colour Traditional fai chun is in bright red color with black or gold characters inscribed on it with a brush. Similar to the color of fire, red color was chosen as to scare the legendary fierce and barbarous beast ‚ÄúNian‚Äù, which ate up villagers‚Äô crops, livestock and even villagers themselves on the eve of the new year. Forms of fai chun In the past, fai chun was presented in Xuan paper, also named rice-paper. Its fine and soft texture enables vivid and dynamic artistic expression of Chinese calligraphy. In this age of technology, city dwellers seldom write their own fai chun. Instead, they purchase them in the stationery stores or shopping malls where a wide diversity of styles is offered. Thanks to the advancement in technology, fai chun can be printed in multiple colors. Commercialization of fai chun can be seen when animated characters are used to attract children while sparkling decoration are used to attract adults. Moreover, the material of fai chun is no more limited to mere paper. Fai chun made by cloth, plastic and layers of cardboards are quite common. Nevertheless, the practice of writing fai chun continues in traditional areas, particularly in walled villages. Types of fai chun The types of fai chun are as follows: Doufang Doufang (ÊñóÊñπ) is a square that its angles point to four cardinal points. Owing to the limited space, this type of fai chun only displays one character such as ‚ÄúChun‚Äù (Êò•; Spring), ‚ÄúMan‚Äù (Êªø; Full) and ‚ÄúFu‚Äù (Á¶è; Good fortune). ‚ÄúMan‚Äù is stuck on rice bins of refrigerators hoping for abundant food. ‚ÄúFu‚Äù is always hung inverted on the center of the door on purpose. The reason behind this is the superstition that the homonymy of the Mandarin words ‚Äúinverted‚Äù (ÂÄí) and ‚Äúarrival‚Äù (Âà∞) suggests the arrival of happiness and good fortune. Combined words, a non-existent word that encompasses parts of Chinese characters, is also very common. Chuntiao Chuntiao (Êò•Ê¢ù) is a vertical or horizontal rectangle that carries two or four Chinese characters. Auspicious phases are expressed based on various contexts. For example, ‚ÄúG≈çngx«ê fƒÅc√°i‚Äù ÊÅ≠ÂñúÁôºË≤° is an ubiquitous phrase that wishes people to become affluent so it can be seen in all occasions. Regarding workplace, ‚ÄúC√°iyu√°n g«îng«în‚Äù (Ë≤°Ê∫êÊªæÊªæ; Merchandise will turn like a wheel) is a term that suggest prosperity. At home, ‚Äúni√°nni√°n y«íuy√∫‚Äù (Âπ¥Âπ¥ÊúâÈ§ò; Surplus year-after-year) are deemed to wish for excess family possessions in the end of the year. Children usually paste ‚ÄúXu√©y√® j√¨nb√π‚Äù (Â≠∏Ê•≠ÈÄ≤Ê≠•; Progress in studies) on their bedroom doors hoping for higher form position in the coming academic year while the elderly hang ‚ÄúL√≥ng m«é jƒ´ngsh√©n‚Äù (ÈæçÈ¶¨Á≤æÁ•û; Spirits of dragon and horse), which is conceived to be able to shelter them from diseases. Chunlian (Spring couplets) Chunlian (Êò•ËÅØ) is a couplet, typically seven characters, on two sides of the door frame, whose content is related to spring. Lexical and tonal rules are always adhered, though not strictly, as chunlian is transformed from metrical poems. Sometimes, concurrently, a horizontal scroll with four to five characters is hanged on the crosspiece of the door. Its content is mostly about the beauty of nature, patriotism of China and their earnestness of a splendid future. Besides being hung on door frames, chunlian are necessary items that are unfurled at the end of a dragon dance.

The book continues after the eleventh book, as George, Harold, and their clones switch places, but to find their gym teacher Mr. Meaner turning into Sir Stinks-A-Lot, who makes the students turn into slaves. Plot summary A message from Dav Pilkey informs those reading that unlike previous books which appealed to both adults and children, this book will attempt to appeal to solely children. On the planet called \\"Smart Earth\\", one scientist is mixing smart Diet Coke, smart Pop Rocks, and smart Mentos and this experiment cause Smart Earth to explode, one chunk lands in a grape garden causing the grapes to become smart, they try to wage war on humans but they dry out. Another chunk landed at the Piqua Valley Home for the Reality- Challenged. Gym teacher Meaner eats a chunk and becomes smart, he tries to walk out but two doctors block his way but he confuses them, and he and the other teachers escape. He then tells the other teachers that they must return to their jobs. Mr. Meaner turns an abandoned factory into his factory, and he makes a strange substance with sweaty gym socks called rid-o-kid 2000. Yesterday George and Harold are told to go to his office, at his office he sprays them with rid-o-kid 2000 and it turns them into robot-like slaves. The other teachers are amazed at their behavior, though other George and Harold are not, and they get sicker because of excessive homework. They see a commercial for the ‚ÄúRid-O-Kid 2000‚Äù and disguise themselves as adults, making the children do silly things \\"for\\" the teachers. The teachers call in Mr. Meaner and enraged at what he sees, he gets out his Stinky Kong 2000, now a mech suit. Deciding to seek help from adults they can trust, George and Harold go to their parents, only to find that they know they've changed and preferred it that way. Feeling heartbroken, they go to Melvin's house to find his Robo- Squid, then travel forward in time to find the older version of Yesterday George and Yesterday Harold, now famous graphic novel writers, and their families (we also find out that Yesterday George is in an interracial relationship and Yesterday Harold is gay), with whom they are also disappointed. The older Yesterday and younger Today versions of George and Harold travel back in time to find Mr. Krupp. The older George and Harold tried to snap their fingers, but as he had been washing his face, he can not turn into Captain Underpants, and Mr. Meaner beats them up anyway. Once Mr. Krupp dries his face, they snap their fingers and turn him into Captain Underpants, defeating Mr. Meaner and sending him to prison. After eating an egg salad sandwich with pickle relish, Meaner turns into a gigantic blob (because the egg salad contains mayonnaise and he added pickle relish; this would create Zygo-Gogozizzle 24) called Sir Stinks-A-Lot. He then causes havoc downtown. Captain Underpants returns to fight him back, but when Old George and Old Harold are captured and absorbed, Sir Stinks-A-Lot discovers Captain Underpants' weakness and turns him back into Mr. Krupp by splashing water from Franz Pond on him, making him fall down (he's still unharmed because of his superpowers). He then drains Captain Underpants' powers with his own after scanning his DNA, presumably taking the effects of the 3d Hypno Ring as well. He runs off screaming as Old George and Harold telepathically call for Tony, Orlando, and Dawn, Sulu and Crackers' children. They feed him Mentos, Diet Coke, and Pop Rocks, making him explode. Luckily, the three hamsterdactyls and Old George and Old Harold are unharmed, as well as Mr. Meaner, who's back to normal. Things are back to the way they were, and as young Today George and Harold return their older Yesterday counterparts to their own time, they find that Mr. Krupp doesn't turn into Captain Underpants at the snap of a finger, because Mr. Meaner erased Captain Underpants from existence. Aside from Harold's initial confusion; he, George, and their older counterparts do not seem to care in the slightest. They decide, given there are a George and Harold to cover for them, they'll use Melvin's time machine to find their pets Crackers and Sulu. The younger Yesterday George and Yesterday Harold wake up to find that Tony, Orlando, Dawn, George, and Harold are gone. They go back to their treehouse. Yesterday Harold feels that he and Yesterday George should make another Captain Underpants comic book, but Yesterday George decides that they should scrap the ‚ÄúCaptain Underpants‚Äù comics entirely and do a comic book featuring Dog Man instead, leading to their future selves encountered by Today George and Today Harold. The book and series end here, and unlike other Captain Underpants adventures, George and Harold do NOT shout their cries of \\"OH, NO!\\" and \\"Here we go again!\\".  Comic: Dog Man: The Bark Knight Cometh  This is a random chapter. Dog Man attacks the cops by assaulting them, then he reveals that he's actually Petey the cat. He tries to slice them up with his sword, but above, Dog Man ‚Äì as his superhero alter ego, \\"The Bark Knight\\" ‚Äì falls toward Petey and breaks his sword with his bone numb-chucks. The two engage in a fight, and while this is happening, Petey shoots hand rockets at Dog Man, revealing he's actually Mecha-Petey (a robot version of Petey). He assaults Dog Man, then Milly ‚Äì a cop ‚Äì kicks Mecha-Petey in the face, removing it and revealing he's actually Porkbelly, an angelfish.

His art works are challenging and have, in the past, used interventions, confrontations and descriptions that interrogate the social space that people, around the world, live in.  Early life  Massa Lemu was born in 1979 in Blantyre. Lemu got his early education in various primary schools in different townships of the city of his birth. His earliest artistic influence is his late uncle, David Zuze who painted as a hobby. As an early primary-school going kid, Lemu used to watch his uncle paint late into the night. Later, Lemu honed his drawing and painting skills under the informal guidance of the cartoonist Brian Hara, the painter Lad Kalonde, and sculptor Peter Masina.  Education  Lemu received his Bachelor of Education Degree (with a major in Fine Arts) from the University of Malawi in 2003 and Master of Arts in Painting from the Savannah College of Art and Design (USA) in 2009. He has shown his work in a number of galleries in Malawi and the United States. * 2014- PhD student in Visual Arts (Theory) at University of Stellenbosch, Cape Town, South Africa * 2009: M.A. Painting Savannah College of Art and Design Savannah, Georgia * 2003: B.Ed. Fine Art Chancellor College University of Malawi Zomba, Malawi * 1994-1999 Chichiri Secondary School  Art career  Lemu's work has been reviewed in publications including Texphrastic, Cite (Houston, Texas), Reflections (Blantyre, Malawi) and Steve Chimombo's book titled Aids, Artists and Authors (Zomba, Malawi). He has also taught courses in painting and art history at Chancellor College of University of Malawi and Rice University in Houston, Texas. Style and technique Lemu's paintings fuse natural and imaginary elements to create compositions that hover between the concrete and the abstract, the real and the surreal, the familiar and the unfamiliar. They combine the real such as plant and animal parts and the surreal to comment on the effects of human exploitative activities on nature. His recent performances and text-based conceptual artworks contain witty critique of the practices in the art institution and have also commented on issues of skewed globalization, labor and migration. Exhibitions Selected solo exhibitions 2013: * PRECARIOT (Lawndale Arts Center, Houston) PRECARIOT is a self-portrait of the artist as a continental drifter in perpetual precarity. The Precariat is a term that combines the word ‚Äúproletariat‚Äù with ‚Äúprecarious‚Äù to describe an emerging ‚Äúbarbarian‚Äù class of migrant laborers and professionals living and working precariously, holding temporary underpaid jobs, lacking a political voice and increasingly frustrated by their living and working conditions. Attracted by its revolutionary aspects, Massa Lemu embraces the label and adopts it as his title. For Lemu the old patriot was proud of, and ready to die for fatherland, the ‚Äúprecariot‚Äù however is one whose only possession is the unstable and indeterminate terrain of precarity, staking claims and maneuvering in this uncertain landscape. In the age of heightened mobility, PRECARIOT focuses on processes of inspection and scrutiny, labeling and branding to highlight the realities of migration. 2012: * Passages for the Undocumented (Rice University, Houston) According to Lemu, Passages for the Undocumented began more than a year ago in response to a practical problem many artists face ‚Äì lack of space t showcase his art. Inspired by the panhandlers he encountered, Lemu started to imitate their method, writing his own slogans on cardboard signs and standing on street corners around Houston. The slogans concentrate Lemu's experience as a third-world migrant artist into pithy statements that combine conceptual art practice with transcultural displacement. * Stranded Fishes and Masks on Wheelchairs (Malawian Embassy, Washington DC) In Stranded Fishes and Masks on Wheelchairs, the paintings in the exhibition used the Gule Wamkulu Mask of the Chewa peoples of Malawi as a departure point to talk about a range of themes such as inclusion and exclusion, determination and resilience. The show also included pictures that use the image of the fish, chambo in particular, to talk about migration, exploitation, and pollution. The artist was inspired to use the image of the fish as metaphor for migration and pollution when he saw East African Tilapia fishes in the polluted concrete bayous of Houston in 2010. 2006: * This Scourge is also a Mask (French Cultural Center, Blantyre) * Primal Forces (Capital Hotel, Lilongwe) 2003: * Multiple Suns (French Cultural Center, Blantyre) Selected group exhibitions 2013: * Do It.

The expression means \\"disorderly shouting\\" or \\"squabbling over nothing\\". Since 2014, Gau Wu has become a street expression, often translated from Cantonese as \\"shopping\\", since the expression is homophonic with \\"shopping\\" in Mandarin (). It represents a means of expressing discontent with various issues such as the Individual Visit Scheme, parallel traders, and the 831 Decision. Origin \\"Gau Wu\\" was originally used during an interview with a Chinese National who participated in a rally known as Sign for Peace and Democracy Movement, expressing her opposition to Occupy Central on 17 August 2014. On the day of the anti-Occupy Central rally, a reporter from HK Cable TV interviewed her and inquired about her role in the event. In Cantonese she replied that she had come to Hong Kong for 'entertainment'.

Background Following an interim injunction order executed the day before, a pro-democracy encampment in Mong Kok affiliated with the Umbrella Movement was cleared by the Hong Kong police force. Following this event, Hong Kong's Chief Executive CY Leung encouraged Hong Kong people and Mainland visitors to shop in Mong Kok in order to support local businesses. As a political tactic, Hong Kong pro- democracy protesters returned to Sai Yeung Choi Street South, a major street in Mong Kok, claiming that they were following the advice of the chief executive. They then started Gau Wu or the \\"Shopping Revolution\\" by pretending to shop in busy districts, blocking roads, and wearing out the police force by acting in a flash mob style.Hongwrong.com. Hongwrong.com. Umbrella Movement Lives on with the Rise of The \\"Shopping Revolution\\". (17 December 2014). Retrieved 16 March 2015 Protesters made use of the fact that it was difficult for the police to distinguish between real and \\"fake\\" tourists going shopping. The aim was to confuse and provoke the police, and it became a strategy for pressuring the HKSAR Government and continuing the protests' call for \\"genuine universal suffrage\\". Timeline  26 November 2014  Immediately after the execution of the court injunction to clear the Mong Kok encampment, pro- democracy protesters assembled there to express discontent over the police clearance operation by pretending to shop.  Late-November to Mid-December  Clashes between those pretending to shop and the police broke out from time to time. As the pro-democracy protest continued and expanded from Mong Kok to Tsim Sha Tsui, police increased their presence, demanded people show identification, donned riot gear to some degree, and made more arrests during the process. The protesters taunted and criticised the police for using excessive violence.  Mid-December  After the clearance of two pro- democracy encampments in Admiralty and Causeway Bay on 11 December 2014, protesters attempted to escalate the campaign by extending the protest area back into Admiralty and Causeway Bay and into Central Bay. Owing to the end of the Occupy Central Movement, activists organised new \\"shopping events\\" and \\"Christmas caroling tours\\" in these busy shopping districts. Due to the fear of chaos breaking out in the \\"Shopping Revolution\\", the New Year's Eve countdown at Times Square in Causeway Bay was cancelled. The Christmas caroling tour debuted on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Pro-democracy protesters held yellow umbrellas and paper crosses, pretending to shop in Causeway Bay's shopping district.Epoch Times Hong Kong: Police Arrest 12 Protesters Around Christmas Day.

This caused some Hong Kong residents to believe that the protests interfered to some extent by impacting their livelihood when protestors pretend to shop in shopping malls.

Spin-offs were created, like Gau Wu Everyday by Mocking Jer which received a total of 730,725 views on YouTube. Advocate of limiting the Individual Visit Scheme Although the Individual Visit Scheme reinvigorated Hong Kong's economy and stimulated local economic growth over the past decade, protesters participating in Gau Wu expressed discontent over the overwhelming number of mainland tourists. This has raised concerns over the carrying capacity of Hong Kong. It has sparked a discussion within the government over whether a new phase of the Individual Visit Scheme should be implemented in order to tighten control over the number of mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong. Worsening relationship between Hong Kong Residents and Mainlanders Gau Wu is often criticised for encouraging discrimination by Hong Kong residents against visiting mainland Chinese citizens who have travelled to shop. This is manifested by Hong Kong residents expressing concerns over the disruption of their local lifestyle. In the face of the escalation of the Shopping protest, a lot of Chinese mainlanders think that they are being singled out, or being discriminated against, by Hong Kong residents.

Controversies Although Sham Shui Po Night Market is welcomed by some Hong Kong citizens, opposition exists. The main concerns of the critics are the noise and hygiene problems caused by the night market. Residents living in Sham Shui Po complain about the loud noises produced by the hawkers and customers in the night market, which affects their daily routine. For hygienic problems, Ms LAU Pui-yuk, district councilor of Nam Cheong Central, points out that hawking could lead to the widespread of diseases, especially during the winter influenza season. The source of food and materials processed by the hawkers are also questionable. Moreover, the district councilors of the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong bring up how Sham Shui Po Night Market is manipulated by the underworld as the area covering Kweilin Street was daubed with the wordings like ‚Äúreserved‚Äù last year during the Chinese New Year holiday. Vincent Cheng, district councilor of Nam Cheong North, opposes hawking and the operation of Sham Shui Po Night Market as using LPG and boiling oil on the street without following any safety guidelines could be very dangerous and even cause explosion, putting the well-being of citizens at risk.Ê°ÇÊûóÂ§úÂ∏ÇÂã¢Ë¢´Ê∂àÂ§± Ê∞ëÂª∫ËÅØÂçÄË≠∞Âì°ÔºöÂ∞èË≤©Êì∫Ë≥£ÊúÉÂÇ≥Êí≠ÁóÖÊØí. http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1031105 Despite the authorities‚Äô ‚Äòzero tolerance‚Äô attitude towards the Sham Shui Po Night Market, supporting citizens view it in a completely different light.

In the campaign, the vice president of the League of Social Democrats blamed the Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying for allowing developers to monopolize the market, suffocating the living space of the small vendors.ÂúòÈ´îÊ∑±Ê∞¥ÂüóÊì∫Ê™îÊíêÁÜüÈ£üÂ∞èË≤© http://news.mingpao.com/ins/ÂúòÈ´îÊ∑±Ê∞¥ÂüóÊì∫Ê™îÊíêÁÜüÈ£üÂ∞èË≤©- Â∏ÇÊ∞ëËá™Ë°åÂÆöÂÉπ È£üÁí∞ËßÄÊúõÊö´Êú™Âü∑Ê≥ï/web_tc/article/20150219/s00001/1424334634474 Since developers own a lot of properties and aim to earn big money, many small vendors are forced out of shopping malls as they cannot afford the ever-increasing rent in order to make room for chained international brands. However, many small vendors find it difficult to rent new places as they either require high rents or are too remote from favourable districts. It is argued that hawking is the only way out for them to make a living, despite going against the law. In recent years, more and more people are beginning to recognize importance of preserving Hong Kong characteristics, the phenomenon of flowing hawker being one of them. In the early days after Hong Kong was colonized, hawkers took a significant role in the local economy. The laborers could buy a bowl of curry fish balls, sweet soup or noodles from unlicensed hawkers after a hard day's work in a cheap, delicious and convenient manner. However, the government has been struggling to eliminate the existence of the pop up hawkers since the 1980s, appealing to its unhygienic and illegal nature. The flowing hawker is thus diminishing. Many people are now defending the Sham Shui Po Night Market so as to secure their collective memory and nostalgia for the old Hong Kong.Don't kill the Kweilin Street night market!

Education  Brunier was born on 10 November 1962 in √âvian- les-Bains, France. He studied architecture in Grenoble, graduating in 1982, and received a diploma in landscape architecture from the Versailles-based √âcole nationale sup√©rieure du paysage in 1986.  Career  Brunier began what Udo Weilacher described as a \\"meteoric career\\" in 1986. He worked at the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) as Rem Koolhaas' assistant, mostly on projects in Rotterdam, Amsterdam and The Hague. He initially refused to design landscapes, wishing to be an architect instead, but was persuaded by Koolhaas. Their projects include the Museumpark in Rotterdam, Villa dall'Ava in Saint-Cloud, and the unrealized Euralille project. After working at OMA, Brunier went to Paris to resume architecture studies. By then, it was visible that he had AIDS. Upon his return to OMA, Brunier was convinced by Koolhaas to abandon architecture and focus on landscape architecture. In 1987, he became a projects assistant to Jean Nouvel in Paris, with whom he worked on the gardens of the Hotel St. James in Bouliac and the Hotel des Thermes in Dax, and the Place du G√©n√©ral Leclerc in Tours. From 1988, he collaborated with Isabelle Auricoste. During his five year long career as a landscape architect, Brunier completed 15 projects. Brunier exploited the clash between culture and nature rather than seeking to create harmonious images of nature in the city. His favorite technique was collage; he created unconventional compositions by fusing fragments of different images, ideas or situations. He also used pencil and watercolor sketches. According to Koolhaas, Brunier's drawings and collages were regularly characterized by impatience and violence. Koolhaas also claimed that Brunier's approach to nature was aggressive, and attributed this to his illness. Nevertheless, Brunier paid a lot of attention to the choice of plants in his projects. Brunier died aged 28 of an AIDS-related illness in his hometown on 2 October 1991.

He was a candidate for the Republican Party's 2016 presidential nomination and won the second-most state contests and delegates. Cruz themed his campaign around being an outsider and a strict conservative. In the crowded early field, he chose not to directly confront the leading candidate, Donald Trump, who was also viewed as an outsider candidate. His cordial and sympathetic tone towards Trump contrasted with the more critical approach of rivals such as Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul. Had Cruz been elected, he would have been the first Cuban American U.S. president and the first U.S. president born outside of the United States or the Thirteen Colonies. As the field narrowed, Cruz's position in the race strengthened, owing to his debate performances and strong field infrastructure. He won the Iowa Caucuses in February, the first contest of the race. But as the field narrowed and less-viable candidates dropped out, Republican support concentrated around Trump rather than Cruz. Trump beat Cruz handily on Super Tuesday and in most subsequent primaries. At this point, with the race essentially narrowed to one between Cruz and Trump, the two candidates began to openly criticize each other (whereas they had previously been notably cordial). Trump repeatedly called Cruz \\"Lyin' Ted\\" and on one occasion retweeted a deprecating tweet regarding the physical appearance of Cruz's wife. Trump also parroted a story in the National Enquirer claiming that Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, was involved in the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Cruz called Trump a chronic liar, \\"completely amoral\\", and questioned whether he was a genuine conservative. In late April, while trailing Trump heavily in the delegate count, Cruz announced that his vice presidential running mate would be former-candidate Carly Fiorina. A week later, he lost the Indiana primary, which he had called pivotal to stopping Trump from clinching the nomination. Having become mathematically disqualified from achieving a majority of delegates prior to the first convention vote, he suspended his campaign the same night. Background Senator Cruz speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland Leading up to the 2016 presidential election cycle, commentators expressed their opinion that Cruz would run for President in 2016. On March 14, 2013, he gave the keynote speech at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C. He tied for 7th place in the 2013 CPAC straw poll on March 16, winning 4% of the votes cast. He performed even more strongly in the 2014 CPAC straw poll, coming in second with 11% behind Kentucky senator Rand Paul. In the 2015 CPAC poll, he came in third with 11.5% behind Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and Paul. In October 2013, Cruz won the Values Voter Summit Presidential straw poll with 42% of the vote, which was the highest percentage of any winning candidate in that poll's history. A year later, he won the same poll again by a smaller margin of 25%, becoming the first person to ever win more than one VVS straw poll. He came in first place in the two most recent Presidential straw polls conducted in 2014 with 30.33% of the vote at the Republican Leadership Conference and 43% of the vote at the Republican Party of Texas state convention. Cruz spoke at events in the summer of 2013 across Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, early primary states, leading to speculation that he was laying the groundwork for a run for President in 2016. On April 12, 2014, Cruz spoke at the Freedom Summit, an event organized by Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United. The event was attended by several potential presidential candidates. In his speech, Cruz mentioned that Latinos, young people and single mothers are the people most affected by the recession, and that the Republican Party should make outreach efforts to these constituents. He also said that the words \\"growth and opportunity\\" should be tattooed on the hands of every Republican politician. Cruz, whose Canadian birth has prompted some to challenge his eligibility for presidential office under the natural-born-citizen clause, formally applied to renounce his dual Canadian citizenship in the run-up to his campaign, and ceased being a citizen of Canada on May 14, 2014. Campaign  Logo  right The campaign logo consisted of a Flag of the United States spliced with the Torch of Liberty. The design became one of the most recognized political brand logos during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. It has also been compared to the Church of Pentecost symbol.  Announcement and preliminaries  Cruz with his wife Heidi at a rally in Houston, March 2015. Cruz announced his campaign for the presidency on March 23, 2015, at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, during the student convocation. In his announcement speech, Cruz spoke of his plans for a constitutional government and said he would \\"stand for liberty\\". Cruz called on the audience to imagine a president repealing the Affordable Care Act and supporting Israel, economic growth, border security while allowing legal immigration, a flat tax and the abolition of the IRS. Liberty University students were required to attend the event, or else be fined, which the university's president Jerry Falwell Jr. confirmed adding, \\"No one is expected to agree with every speaker on every point.\\" He became the first announced major Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 campaign. Cruz was believed to have initiated a long shot presidential bid, commentators referring to him as having no chance of winning the nomination, much less the general election, due to what was perceived as his lack of likability. Cruz, a freshman senator running for the presidency in his first term, faced comparisons to President Barack Obama who similarly ran for the presidency during his first term in the U.S. Senate. Cruz dispelled similarities by calling the president a \\"backbencher\\" who did not take positions on \\"whole lot of issues of consequence\\" during his tenure in the senate, which he argued could not be applied to him, in effect spending the first few days of his presidential campaign trying to distance himself from the incumbent president. On April 1, Public Policy Polling showed Cruz in third place at 16%, behind potential candidates Jeb Bush and Scott Walker who were at 17% and 20%. Cruz's name recognition significantly increased shortly after his campaign began, in April rising by 21 points to 82% from the 61% he had the previous month. Cruz welcomed several candidates into the race following their individual announcements of their candidacy for the presidency, praising them as well. A Des Moines Register poll released in May showed Cruz in eighth place at 5% among caucus goers. Cruz significantly increased his appearances in Iowa from June 2015. On June 18, the day after the Charleston church shooting, Cruz gave a speech empathizing with the lost lives and led onlookers in a moment of silence. At the same time, former political director Craig Robinson expressed that while he thought of Cruz as \\"the perfect caucus candidate\\", he did not feel he was committing to Iowa. On August 3, 2015, Cruz was featured in YouTube video frying bacon off the end of a semi-automatic rifle at the Central Iowa Impact Gun Range in Boone, Iowa. \\"There is nothing I enjoy more than on weekends cooking breakfast with the family,\\" Cruz said in the video. \\"Of course in Texas we cook bacon a little differently than most folks.\\" The month of August also saw the release of a campaign video where Cruz promised in his opposition to Planned Parenthood to prosecute the organization for \\"selling body parts\\". In the first few months of the campaign, Cruz held campaign rallies in Tulsa Columbus, Hoover, Huntsville and Montgomery.  August‚ÄìSeptember campaigning  Cruz successfully qualified for the first presidential debate of the election cycle, coming in 6th place in the overall list of the top 10 candidates. Cruz's performance was mostly well-received, although debate coach and strategist Michael Sheehan found him annoying and strategist Rick Wilson wondered if the performance, despite showing \\"Cruz-like brilliance\\", helped him as much as people thought. In an NBC News poll released on August 9, three days after the Ohio Republican presidential debate, Cruz came in 2nd place with 13% overall, more than doubling his prior support. On August 21, 2015, Cruz sponsored a \\"Rally for Religious Liberty\\" in the capital city of Des Moines, Iowa. The Bontrager Family Singers of Kalona, headed by Marlin Joe Bontrager (born 1967), a member of Cruz's homeschooling coalition, performed gospel and bluegrass music for the occasion. Seven persons or couples targeted by the U. S. government for their religious beliefs addressed the gathering, among them Kelvin J. Cochran, former fire chief of the Atlanta Fire Department in Atlanta, Georgia. Bontrager described Cruz as \\"the first time ever in my adult life that we've had a candidate that I'm fired up about.\\" Cruz journeyed to the southern states in the days following the debate, eight of which being slated to cast ballots on March 1 on a day monikered the \\"SEC Primary\\". He courted voters while going on bus tours, his rivals spending time campaigning in Iowa. \\"Like the SEC does two-a-days, we're doing two-a-days here right now,\\" Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said. \\"Everybody comes in for a Fourth of July event -- a big speech, or some sort of cattle call -- but spending the time, doing these type of events? We don't see that from anybody else.\\" Cruz's public appearances throughout the southern states were well-publicized. The second Republican presidential debate took place on September 16, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California. As with the first debate, Cruz did not participate in the \\"verbal combat\\" between the other candidates, only criticizing former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush for their appointments of David Souter and John Roberts to the Supreme Court, arguing the pair could have appointed conservatives in their place that would have voted \\"differently on cases that enraged the conservative base.\\" In hindsight, Cruz's undistinguished Fox News and CNN debate performances were viewed as being purposeful, as he \\"was biding his time.\\" In a poll released on September 20, four days after the debate, Cruz came in sixth place, tied with Mike Huckabee. Cruz visited Kentucky around this time, in support of the release of Kim Davis, but reportedly was blocked by an aide to Huckabee from appearing alongside her. Days after fellow presidential candidate Donald Trump did not correct a man who claimed President Obama was a Muslim, a move that generated controversy and negative reception by the White House, Democrats and Republicans, Cruz declined to answer whether he thought the president was a Christian, reasoning that Obama's faith \\"is between him and God\\" and opted to give his stance that the Obama administration had been antagonistic towards Christians. Cruz debunked fellow presidential candidate Ben Carson's claim that a Muslim should not serve as President, saying, \\"The Constitution specifies there shall be no religious test for public office, and I'm a constitutionalist.\\"  Post-CNBC debate  Cruz speaking at an event hosted by the Iowa Republican Party in October 2015 Cruz was a participant in the CNBC Republican presidential debate on October 28. In his opening statement, he stressed his willingness to govern properly, and later in the debate charged the moderators with asking bait questions. Cruz's performance was well-received, as he had \\"effectively articulated\\" his strategy of being the second choice for voters, enough of which would give him \\"the broadest base of support left when the dust clears.\\" Cruz was also seen as having won the debate. Cruz was the most discussed of all candidates on Facebook the night of the debate and came in second to Donald Trump on Twitter for the most-talked about. On October 31, Cruz was a speaker at a Growth and Opportunity Party event in Iowa. It was commented that Cruz received the biggest showing of the ten candidates present at the event. In a poll released on November 2, Cruz came in second place for favorability among Iowans, only surpassed by Ben Carson. Two other polls released the same day showed Cruz in third place in Iowa at 15%, behind Donald Trump and Ben Carson. In a Quinnipiac University poll, noted by Fox News as having been taken after the CNBC debate, Cruz came in fourth place at 13%, behind the two aforementioned candidates and Marco Rubio. Cruz stated shortly after the poll that the possibility of Rubio and himself being the last candidates remaining in the crowded field was a \\"plausible outcome.\\" As a result of many candidates feeling the CNBC debate was not balanced, some candidates signed a list of debate demands. Cruz refused to sign, stating in a Fox News interview that he wasn't \\"interested in signing letters.\\" In November, The Courageous Conservatives PAC published a radio ad, stating, \\"Ted Cruz makes things happen. ‚Ä¶ After Sandy Hook, Ted Cruz stopped Obama's push for new gun-control laws.\\" Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said at the time of the ad's release that it made him want to vomit and he was sure these feelings were shared by those who had also lived through Sandy Hook. On November 8, Cruz participated at the National Religious Liberties Conference in Des Moines, Iowa, alongside his father Rafael Cruz, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee, and during a Q&A; with the organizer of the event Kevin Swanson he said that \\"any president who doesn't begin everyday on his knees isn't fit to be commander-in-chief\\". In the conference, Kevin Swanson called for the execution of homosexuals. For which later, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler called Swanson's statements \\"reprehensible\\" and given the comments \\"it was a mistake for Senator Cruz to appear at the event\\", stating that Cruz is against hatred or violence against homosexuals. On November 24, a Quinnipiac University poll was released with Cruz in second place in Iowa at 23%, only surpassed by Donald Trump. This was seen as evidence that Cruz was finally being able to garner the support of those who had supported candidates with no prior political experience such as frontrunners Trump and Carson, and establishing his credibility as a contender for the Republican Party's nomination. Additionally, it led some to believe that Cruz had made the right decision in avoiding conflicts with other candidates and focusing solely on his own substance. Rise in the aftermath of the Paris attacks The November 2015 Paris attacks significantly altered the Republican field, shifting the public focus to foreign policy and immigration. Though front-runner Trump - with a record of populist statements that were perceived both as hawkish and isolationist - was largely unaffected in his frontrunner status, second-place Ben Carson lost significant support in the immediate aftermath of the attack, as he was perceived as soft and inexperienced on foreign policy. Establishment favorite Jeb Bush also had his hopes of a late surge dimmed by his reputation as a moderate on immigration. In contrast, Rubio and Cruz, who had publicly taken hardline positions on both topics, saw their polls rise. By the end of November, poll averages showed Rubio in second place and Cruz in a close third place nationally. In early December, a Monmouth University poll was released showing Cruz leading in Iowa at 24%. A CNN/ORC poll showed Cruz in second place to Trump among likely voters in the state's caucus with 20%. A December 12, The Des Moines Register poll showed a 10 point lead for Cruz while a December 14 CNN poll showed a 1 point lead for Cruz.  After CNN debate; early primaries  On December 15, Cruz participated in the second CNN Republican debate in Las Vegas, Nevada, the fifth overall of the election cycle, his overall performance being seen as strong and some commentators dubbing him the winner of the event. In the days following the debate, Cruz defended himself against claims by Rubio during the debate that he supported an immigration reform proposal two years prior in 2013 that would have included amnesty for undocumented immigrants, outright stating during a rally on December 17, \\"I oppose amnesty. I oppose citizenship. I oppose legalization for illegal aliens. I always have and I always will.\\" December 22, coincidentally Cruz's 45th birthday, saw the release of a Quinnipiac poll where Cruz came in second place to Trump nationally, behind him by just four percentage points at 24%. Pre-April 2016 campaign logo By early January, Cruz continued to lead in Iowa, averaging 32%. However, a Quinnipiac University poll released on January 11 showed Cruz in second place to Trump at 29%, who had 31%. A Bloomberg/Des Moines Register poll released on January 13 showed Cruz in first place with 25%. Cruz was a participant in the second Fox Business debate on January 14, defending himself against the accusations of possible issues resulting from his birth in Canada while also indicating that the controversy was generated by his opponents due to his rise in the polls in the last few months as well as his senate record. During the second Fox Business debate, Cruz was questioned on his meaning when he stated beforehand that Trump embodied New York values. He was also criticized for the statement by New York Republicans and Democrats. The January 15 issue of Daily News, released the day after the debate, had a front page reading, \\"Drop dead, Ted.\\" The cover also called on him to return to Canada. Cruz acknowledged the criticism and apologized to New Yorkers \\"who have been let down by the liberal politicians in that state.\\" He also apologized on behalf of Bill de Blasio for what he called his standing with \\"looters and the criminals\\" instead of law enforcement. Cruz's opposition to ethanol led Iowa's governor, Terry Branstad to publicly express disapproval of him on January 19, arguing that his win would be at the expense of jobs for Iowans and reduce income for farms. Branstad's comments were a far cry from the behavior of previous governors of the state during the Iowa caucus, who typically remained neutral. Hours after the governor's comments, Sarah Palin, who had been a supporter of Cruz during his run for the U.S. Senate four years prior, endorsed Trump. These events propelled Theodore Schleifer of CNN to conclude that Cruz \\"has had better days.\\" By late January, Trump had re- claimed the polling lead in Iowa, garnering 33% to Cruz's 27% in the polling averages just 6 days before the caucus. Cruz was a participant in the second Fox News debate. He was seen by some pundits as losing due to his defensive positions on his prior positions on immigration as well as subsidies for ethanol and falling flat on his attempts at humor. On February 1, 2016, Cruz won the first Republican nomination contest, the Iowa Republican caucus. Cruz received 28% of caucus votes, with Donald Trump and Marco Rubio in second and third place at 24% and 23%, respectively. The clear victory was a surprise to many; analysts attributed the performance to Cruz's extensive grassroots organization in Iowa, having borrowed from Barack Obama's campaign in the 2008 Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses, where Obama had similarly outperformed two rivals in a statistically tied race. Cruz became the first Hispanic person to win the Iowa caucus in either party. However, not all subsequent press for Cruz was positive; Cruz's campaign received significant criticism after it was revealed that it was responsible for a voicemail with the false claim that Carson had quit the race, presumably an attempt to rally Carson's evangelical supporters towards Cruz's side. Cruz later apologized to Carson twice and blamed the incident on staff, yet none were fired over the spread of false information. February 9's New Hampshire primary, barely a week later, did not provide shocks; Cruz finished with 12% of the vote, behind Trump and Kasich, and ahead of Bush and Rubio. Owing to the fact that Kasich and Bush had invested significantly in the New Hampshire race - hoping to win it and consolidate the moderate \\"lane\\" - the underwhelming results did not provide a boost to their campaigns. Ahead of the February 20 South Carolina primary, Cruz and Rubio became entangled in a heated exchange in a CBS-hosted debate. Cruz referred to an interview of Rubio on Univision and alleged that Rubio had stated a different position on immigration from his public stance, in effect accusing him of pandering to the Hispanic audience. Rubio then responded with the accusation that Cruz could not speak Spanish and hence could not have understood his remarks. Cruz, agitated, asked in spoken Spanish for Rubio to continue his own statement in Spanish. Rubio brushed off the exchange and accused Cruz of frequent dishonesty, pointing to the controversy over the Iowa caucus in particular. The exchange became highly discussed in social media and was notable as the first instance of Spanish being spoken in an American major party presidential debate; Beto O'Rourke later did the same in a 2019 Democratic debate. In the subsequent South Carolina Republican primary, Cruz narrowly finished 3rd behind Rubio by a tiny margin of 0.15%. The following day, Bush dropped out of the presidential race, while Cruz declared that he and Rubio had \\"effectively tied\\" for 2nd behind Trump, with the implication that both were vying for the status as the mainstream conservative challenger to Trump. In Nevada, Cruz and Rubio were part of another tight battle for second, with Rubio claiming 24% of the vote and Cruz 21%. Super Tuesday Prior to the evening of the Iowa Caucus, the Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz campaigns used the published state voter roster entries to send a targeted mailing to past Iowa voters. The mailing envelopes were designed to appear to originate from an election authority, with large wording announcing \\"VOTER VIOLATION\\" on the exterior in a bold red box. Some recipients stated they were intimidated by the content, which revealed their past voter participation and their adjacent neighbors' participation. During caucus evening in Iowa, news reports from CNN reporters indicated correctly that Carson's itinerary was to go home to Florida before the night's caucus results and then to Washington, DC prayer breakfast, not New Hampshire or South Carolina; the Cruz campaign began to reference these reports in news interviews and Twitter posts, misrepresenting them as reporting indicating that Carson was planning to withdraw from the campaign. Cruz apologized via a direct phone call to Dr. Ben Carson later and repeated the apology in a CNN interview. Campaign surrogate Peter King defended his part in the events, and Cruz said that he would not punish any of his staff for spreading rumors of Carson's exit from the campaign. At the New Hampshire ABC debate Donald Trump accused the Cruz campaign of \\"dirty tricks\\" for targeting Dr. Ben Carson during the caucusing in Iowa. Afterwards, Cruz's communications director, Rick Tyler, publicized a video with inaccurate subtitle captions portraying Marco Rubio criticizing the Bible. The next day, February 22, Tyler apologized to Rubio on his Facebook page for publishing the video. Shortly after that, Cruz requested Tyler's resignation. After Tyler's resignation, Marco Rubio called Cruz \\"a liar\\" during the Houston CNN/Telemundo debate held February 25; Donald Trump repeated the \\"a liar\\" phrase targeting Cruz in that CNN debate and the two campaigns attributed the threads of alleged past deceit in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Super Tuesday directly to Cruz, downplaying the Tyler resignation. Analyzing the internal exit polling of the primary results, the impact of these accusations affected the evangelical Christian voters in the South Carolina candidate selection. Self-identified evangelicals did not agree with the candidate values of Donald Trump closely matching their values, but selected Donald Trump in a higher percentage than Cruz, the likely favored candidate among this group. By the time of the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, on March 1, the exit polling results of evangelical Christian voters were at the anticipated levels, selecting Cruz over Donald Trump, with the exception of Virginia. In Virginia, the selection was Rubio over Trump and Cruz, with Trump the declared winner. Cruz's campaign had positioned itself to rely heavily on his home state of Texas. Cruz also focused on Alaska, having never visited the state though believing his grassroots movement would suffice. In a poll released on February 28, Cruz maintained a lead in Texas by eleven points at 42%. Tom LoBianco of CNN said that a Cruz victory in Texas could slow Trump's momentum. Christopher Hooks of The Los Angeles Times stated that Cruz's campaign could be over with an underperformance in Texas, while viewing a large victory as allowing him to remain in the race \\"with renewed vigor.\\" Cruz went to Texas the day prior to the primary to secure votes. On primary day, March 1, 2016, Cruz won Texas by 17% (beating the expectations of final polling numbers) along with Alaska and Oklahoma, providing him with four state primary victories total. After Super Tuesday On March 5, 2016, Cruz won the Kansas and Maine caucuses, giving him six statewide wins.Cruz Easily Wins Kansas Republican Caucuses, Kansas City Star, March 5, 2016. Cruz won his widest margin in Kansas, where he beat Trump by 25 points. Cruz also tied Trump in Louisiana for the largest number of delegates earned from the Louisiana primary, with 18 delegates each. With his victories over Trump in Kansas and Maine, Cruz established himself as the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Trump, the leading contender for the nomination.Easley, Jonathan. Cruz on Trump's heels after victories on Super Saturday, The Hill, March 6, 2016. On March 6, 2016, in the Puerto Rico primaries, Cruz received 9% of the vote, placing him third behind Rubio and Trump. On March 8, 2016, Cruz won the Idaho primary with 45% of vote‚Äîdefeating Trump by 17% and earning his seventh statewide victory. He placed second in Michigan, Mississippi, and Hawaii. The victory in Idaho solidified his claim as the best alternative to Donald Trump. On March 12, 2016, Cruz won the Wyoming county conventions with 67% of the vote, giving him his eighth statewide win. He took fourth at the District of Columbia convention. Following Rubio's loss in Florida and suspension of his campaign on March 15, commentators noted that Cruz was becoming the surrogate for most of his supporters, including voters and other office holders. On March 17, Lindsey Graham, who previously indicated his dislike for Cruz on several occasions, said that he would both support and fundraise for him due to his belief that Cruz was capable of besting Trump in the primary. Shortly afterward, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney expressed his support for Cruz over what he called \\"Trumpism\\". Jeb Bush endorsed Cruz on March 23, the anniversary of the campaign's announcement, calling Cruz a \\"principled conservative\\" and urging voters to reject Trump as a potential nominee. On March 25, Cruz responded to a National Enquirer allegation that \\"political operatives\\" are investigating whether Cruz had been involved in extramarital affairs.Hopper, Jessica. \\"Cruz Blames 'Sleazy Donald' for National Enquirer Report\\", ABC News (March 25, 2016). In Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Cruz denied the allegations as \\"complete and utter lies\\" and called the article \\"garbage\\" and placed the blame for the falsehood on Donald Trump and his allies. On April 3, 2016, Cruz was interviewed by Megyn Kelly, and said that he had always been faithful to his wife. On April 3, 2016, North Dakota elected a slate of delegates that was dominated by pro-Cruz delegates. Cruz received the support of the majority of the delegates. Two days later, Cruz won a victory in the Wisconsin primary with 48% of the vote and 36 of the 42 delegates. On April 8, Cruz received 21 of Colorado's 37 delegates, garnering the support of the remaining delegates the next day, April 9, during the state's Republican Convention. Also in April, amid polling showing that Trump had a massive lead in New York, Cruz began redirecting his focus to California, Republican voters there due to cast votes on June 7. Midway through April, Cruz traveled to Wyoming seeking to gather the 14 delegates for his campaign, though this plan conflicted with a group of the state's Republicans who hoped to send the delegates to the national convention in three months. On April 16, Cruz secured all of Wyoming's delegates at the state convention, prompting Trump to call the process \\"rigged\\" at a rally that day in Syracuse, New York. On April 19, Trump won New York primary, receiving the state's delegates and enlarging the gap between him and Cruz by over 300. The following day, April 20, Cruz said that no one would get the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination and foresaw a contested convention. On April 22, the Cruz campaign was accused by Governor of Maine Paul LePage, who is a Trump supporter, of reversing its position after promising to back a \\"unity slate that would honor the wishes of the thousands of Mainers who voted at caucus.\\" He furthered that Cruz campaign affiliate David Sawyer \\"stabbed us in the back, reneged on the unity slate, and betrayed the people of Maine.\\" Cruz subsequently obtained 19 of 20 delegate slots for Maine. Vice presidential choice; Indiana loss and suspension  On April 27, 2016, in a move unusual for a candidate in a contested primary, Cruz announced that Carly Fiorina would be joining his campaign as his vice presidential running mate. This was one day after he lost a series of primaries in the northeast and later dropped out of the race. The Cruz campaign would later attribute their loss to not having selected Rubio as running mate, as hypothetical polling showed Cruz defeating Trump by a large margin with Rubio as the vice presidential candidate. However, Rubio denounced any interest at the time, which convinced the campaign to not approach him. On April 30, Former Governor of California Pete Wilson endorsed Cruz during a joint appearance at the state Republican Party's convention. The same day, it was reported that 10 of the 13 Virginia delegates at that state's Republican convention were loyal to Cruz. While unusual, it was not completely unprecedented for Cruz to announce a running mate without securing the nomination. During his unsuccessful 1976 campaign for the Republican Nomination, former Governor Ronald Reagan similarly announced Richard Schweiker as his preferred running mate. The incumbent Gerald Ford would ultimately secure the 1976 Republican nomination at the convention. The May 3 Indiana primary was widely seen as make or break for the Cruz campaign by commentators and pundits who speculated a loss for Cruz would mean a nomination for Trump. In a fundraising email, Cruz admitted that the state was pivotal to stopping Trump. On April 29, Governor of Indiana Mike Pence (candidate Trump's eventual running mate) said he would be voting for Cruz in the state primary, effectively endorsing him. On May 1, a poll was released showing Cruz with 34% support of Republican voters in Indiana, 15 points behind Trump. The same day, Cruz swore the campaign would continue regardless of the outcome of the primary. Following the Indiana primary on May 3, Cruz announced he was suspending his campaign. Eligibility Questions have been raised as to whether Cruz meets the constitutional qualification that the President must be a natural born citizen as Cruz was born in Canada. Donald Trump, one of Cruz's opponents in the Republican primary, repeatedly questioned whether Cruz met the qualifications of being a natural born citizen. Opinions, for the most part, concur that Cruz is eligible to serve as President of the United States; most constitutional scholars surveyed by Politico believe that he is eligible, and \\"a small, but vocal group\\" has issued challenges that he is not. According to a memo from the Congressional Research Service, \\"The weight of scholarly legal and historical opinion appears to support the notion that 'natural born Citizen' means one who is entitled under the Constitution or laws of the United States to U.S. citizenship 'at birth' or 'by birth,' including... those born abroad of one citizen parent who has met U.S. residency requirements.\\" Several lawsuits and ballot challenges asserting that Cruz is ineligible have been filed. No lawsuit or challenge has been successful, and in February 2016 the Illinois Board of Elections ruled in Cruz's favor, stating, \\"The candidate is a natural born citizen by virtue of being born in Canada to his mother who was a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth.\\"  Fundraising  Cruz raised nearly 4 million in the first eight days after he announced his presidential campaign. 95% of the donations to Cruz's campaign came in contributions of less than 100. Ted Cruz supporters in Naples, Florida, January 2016 On April 8, 2015, it was reported that super PACs backing Cruz had raised 31 million in a week, one of the biggest fundraising surges in modern presidential-race history to date. The Cruz campaign is funded by six separate super PACs, an unusually large number, described as \\"unprecedented\\" by CNN campaign finance experts. According to Dathan Voelter, treasurer of several of the PACs, this allows megadonors to exercise \\"influence and control\\" over how their money is spent on the campaign. Of the PACs, Keep the Promise I is funded primarily by an 11 million donation from Robert Mercer, Keep the Promise II is funded entirely from a 10 million donation from Toby Neugebauer, and Keep the Promise III is funded by 15 million donated by Dan and Farris Wilks, two billionaire brothers from Cruz's home state of Texas, and their wives. As of July 25, a total of 38 million was pledged to Keep The Promise super PACs. Within the first 48 hours after the second Republican primary debate, Cruz's campaign raised 1 million, the result of more than 15,000 donations, the average being 49.54. Cruz said he was \\"thrilled by the outpouring of financial support we've seen in such a short amount of time\\". On October 8, the Cruz campaign announced 12 million during the previous fundraising quarter, noted by The New York Times as being \\"substantially less\\" than that of Ben Carson's campaign who raised 20 million in the same time but double than that of Marco Rubio, who had raised 6 million within that period. in a campaign statement, it was reported more than 6,000 of his contributors had pledged intentions to make recurring donations every month. By this point, according to the Campaign Finance Institute, Cruz was in second place in the Republican primary for large donors, after Jeb Bush. On October 26, billionaire Darwin Deason announced alongside \\"five other wealthy Texans\\" that they would be aboard his campaign. The donors beforehand supported Rick Perry prior to his presidential campaign ending the previous month. Less than 24 hours after the CNBC Republican presidential debate, the Cruz campaign raised 1.1 million in what was the third straight post debate 1 million fundraising haul. Over the last three months of 2015, Cruz raised 20 million, increasing his campaign's finances by 66% from its earnings of the previous quarter. Campaign manager Jeff Roe in a memo reported that the Cruz campaign had received 300,000 donors' contributions and told supporters that the campaign had \\"a network in place with the resources required to win that is the envy of every other campaign.\\" On January 7, Cruz's campaign was joined by Republican megadonor Dick Uihlein, who donated US$1 million to his super PAC. Drew Ryun, who works for the Cruz super PAC, said Uihlein was in the top five of the courted Republican donors and called landing him a \\"good shot in the arm for Ted\\" as well as boosting the campaign in Iowa. On January 20, in an interview with Mark Levin, Cruz announced that his campaign had superseded US$50 million. More than 40% of Cruz's donations that month came from small donors that he was capable of repeatedly requesting contributions from.  Strategy  Cruz's campaign strategy relied heavily in gain support of evangelical leaders, donors and voters. Theodore Schleifer of CNN wrote of Cruz's campaign strategy, \\"Raise enough money to go the distance, court the fans of other conservative candidates who inevitably drop out, and emerge in the spring as the clear conservative alternative to an establishment favorite like Bush.\\" Barnes acknowledged doubts that Cruz could win the general election, stressing that he would have to carry states won by Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential election and reverse several victories by President Obama to gain enough electoral votes. Cruz himself believed that the 2016 election will be similar to the 1980 presidential election, suggesting the eventual Republican nominee can win the election through being a conservative and appealing to those types of voters. Cruz has often repeated a line from Ronald Reagan, that to win the election, the Republican Party should be \\"raising a banner of no pale pastels, but bold colors.\\" The Cruz campaign noted that four million conservative voters did not turn out during the previous election, though Barnes noted previous defeats of Republican nominees even when these voters deployed. Politicos Kenneth P. Vogel reported in July 2015 that Cruz had partnered with London-based Cambridge Analytica to collect and analyze data on American voters and using strategic communication to manage voter behavior. Multiple times in the campaign, Cruz has done impressions or impersonations of John F. Kennedy and made claims that Kennedy would be a Republican if he were alive today. The Kennedy family has spoken out condemning the claims with open letters to the media regarding the positions of Kennedy and Cruz. In April 2016, the campaigns of Cruz and John Kasich agreed to \\"split up\\" some of the remaining primaries in an effort to block Donald Trump from gaining the 1,237 delegates necessary to clinch the GOP nomination. However, the pact proved challenging; for example, though Cruz was intended to focus on the Indiana primary, Kasich said that his supporters should still vote for him there. And days later, Cruz clarified that there is \\"no alliance\\" but, rather, he and Kasich \\"made a determination where to focus [the campaigns'] energies.\\"  Garnering supporters from other candidates  With Rick Perry's exit from the race on September 11, David Johnson, one of Perry's backers in Iowa, reported being approached by Cruz Iowa state director Bryan English who asked if he would consider \\"another Texan for president\\". Additionally, Doug Deason, the son of a $5 million donor to Perry's super PAC, mentioned at the time of his dropping out that he had dined with Cruz \\"a few evenings ago\\" and was contacted by Cruz finance director Willie Langston. After Scott Walker dropped out of the race on September 21, Cruz's campaign website announced its signing of all three of Walker's Georgia grassroots co- chairmen. In early November, Cruz's campaign was joined by former Walker Iowa strategist David Polyansky. On September 28, Cruz released a video showing eight former supporters of Ron Paul who had begun backing him and announced that Bob Barr would chair the coalition of the Cruz campaign composed of libertarian-leaning Republicans. Katie Zezima of The Washington Post wrote that the former Ron Paul supporters would have been inclined to support his son Rand Paul's presidential campaign. On January 10, Sam Pimm, who worked for the Ben Carson campaign in New Hampshire, publicly announced he was withdrawing from Carson's campaign to support Cruz. Pimm expressed his belief that Carson could not win the nomination and viewed Cruz as having a higher probability of doing so.  Relationship with Donald Trump  On August 10, Cruz cautioned rival Republican presidential candidates from dismissing Trump, citing that he was attracting large crowds and doing so would not help Republicans reclaim the White House. On September 9, Cruz and Trump made a joint appearance at a rally opposing the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran. On November 17, Trump named Cruz when asked about a potential running mate, citing that he liked Cruz and that the senator had backed everything he had said. On November 30, Cruz stated during a town hall meeting in Iowa that he believed Trump would not be the nominee. It was observed by some commentators that Cruz was straying from insulting or making any disparaging remarks towards Donald Trump in an effort to get his supporters. Despite this, Cruz came in third place in a Fox News poll, behind Trump and Carson. Tied with Marco Rubio, the poll was said to \\"poked a hole in the narrative\\" along with Ben Carson's support rising from 23% to 33% in a poll without Trump while Cruz only went up from 11% to 13%. The day following the Fox Business debate, Cruz outlined his differences from Trump. It was noted by commentators that although Cruz could gain the supporters of Trump should he drop out, there was also the possibility that he would not, which would lead to this effort being for naught. In private remarks to donors that were leaked, former President George W. Bush reportedly said that he did not like Cruz and found him to be opportunistic toward Trump, also stressing his belief that Cruz would be a \\"pretty formidable candidate\\" to Jeb Bush around the south. Though the Cruz campaign initially declined commenting on the rumors, Cruz released a public statement where he expressed his \\"great respect\\" for the former president and that he would \\"always be grateful to him\\" since he met his wife while working on his presidential campaign in 2000. Cruz reasoned that Bush's remarks were made to support his brother, the cause of his additional commenting on other candidates, though Cruz refused to \\"reciprocate\\" any attacks. On December 11, during an appearance in Iowa, Trump admitted to liking Cruz, but mentioned that \\"not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba\\". The comment was seen as a reference to Cruz's father Rafael Cruz, who had escaped from Cuba in his early adulthood and was viewed as Trump's first attack on Cruz. Following those remarks, on December 13, Trump went on to say that he had \\"far better judgement\\" than Cruz, citing his opposition to the Iraq War as an example. Trump was involved in questioning of Cruz's eligibility for the presidency in January and claimed he was trying to help Cruz, who argued that in politics, \\"it's fairly unusual for your opponents who are running for the same position to be actually trying to help you\\". Cruz responded to Trump on January 12 with the assertion that he and Hillary Clinton knew each other well and that \\"it's interesting that Hillary Clinton's key supporters are doing everything they can to echo Donald's attacks on me.\\" After Cruz and Trump had several exchanges in the Fox Business debate on January 14, Trump said after the debate that he believed \\"the bromance\\" between the pair had ended. On January 17, Trump acknowledged Cruz had been \\"so nice to me\\" before dubbing him \\"a nasty guy\\" and adding: \\"Nobody likes him, nobody in Congress likes him, nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him.\\" Cruz said on January 25 that Trump potentially could become \\"unstoppable\\" if he were to win Iowa, at the same time mentioning his substantial lead in New Hampshire and arguing that his campaign was the only one that could defeat Trump in Iowa. With Trump declining to participate in the January 28 Fox News debate, Cruz invited him to a one-on-one debate, saying he would like to invite Trump if the latter was afraid of Megyn Kelly and launching a website seeking support of those in favor of a debate between the two candidates. Trump's campaign responded by saying Trump would debate Cruz if the two became the last candidates in the race. Cruz lampooned Trump at the Fox News debate, saying, \\"Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly. And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon. Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way....\\" On January 31, Trump criticized Cruz for a controversial mailer that the Cruz campaign sent to voters in Iowa. The mailer was designed to look like an official document that accused the recipient of a \\"VOTING VIOLATION\\" for failure to turn out in past elections. The mailer was promptly condemned by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate who said the mailer \\"misrepresents the role of my office, and worse, misrepresents Iowa election law.\\" Endorsements See also *Political positions of Ted Cruz *2016 Republican Party presidential primaries *2016 Republican Party presidential candidates *2016 Republican Party presidential debates and forums References External links * Cruz for President official campaign site Cruz, Ted Category:Ted Cruz ","title":"Ted Cruz 2016 presidential campaign"},{"id":"46201184","text":"The Washington Manuscript of the Psalms (Washington MS II) is designated as Rahlfs 1219, and van Haelst 83 in the Van Haelst Catalogue numbers.Larry W.

Sanders, The Old Testament Manuscripts in the Freer Collection, Part II: The Washington Manuscript of the Psalms, pp. 107-114, 121-122 The codex is a book of 107 leaves, badly decayed and worm eaten. In his initial description of the manuscript, Henry A. Sanders noted that sometime in the 10th Century CE, some of the final pages of the codex that contained Psalms 142:9-151 were lost. Rather than having new pages written, other pages from a slightly less older codex were taken and added to the end, completing the Psalms and adding six verses from the book of Odes (1:1-6a). This is apparent due to the different page size, the repetition of Psalm 142:5-8, and the divergent handwriting.Larry W. Hurtado, The Freer Biblical Manuscripts. Fresh Studies of an American Treasure Trove, K. D. Clarke Paleography and Philanthropy pp. 37 H. A. Sanders indicated the original codex by the Greek letter Œõ (Lambda), and the secondary codex as Œõa (Lambda A). * Œõ: The parchment is a mixture of goat and sheep skin. The main text is written in a dark-brown ink, with red ink used for the Psalm titles and numbers, and also for the word Œ¥ŒπŒ±œàŒ±ŒªŒºŒ±. The text is written in one column per page, which originally would've been around 25 x 35 cm, 30 lines per page, with about 25-30 letters per line. Due to decay, almost half of each leaf is missing, with some leaves having decay covering them in their entirety, although with letters still visible. The text is written in large square uncial, with the Psalm titles usually in a slightly smaller size. Each Psalm has its number in the left hand margin in uppercase letters representing numerals, with decorative lines above and below the letter . The manuscript covers Psalms 1:4-142:8, with the last pages of the manuscript completely missing. * Œõa: The parchment is made of sheepskin only. The main text is written in a medium-brown ink, with red ink used for the Psalm titles and numbers as in Œõ. The text is written in one column per page, which originally would've been around 27.5 x 21.58 cm, 24 lines per page, with about 18-24 letters per line. The seven leaves are in a fragmentary condition, and would originally have contained Psalms 142:5-151:6 and Odes 1:1-6a, but due to the loss of two leaves, Psalms 146:9b-149:2b are missing. The text is written in large, sloping letters known as Slavonic uncial. Text of CodexH.

Sanders, The Old Testament Manuscripts in the Freer Collection, Part II: The Washington Manuscript of the Psalms pp. 108-109 Prior to its purchase by Freer in 1906 from an Arab dealer named Ali in Gizah, Cairo, very little is known about the manuscript, where it came from or for whom it was written. One possible place of origin is the Church of Timothy in the Monastery of the Vinedresser, a Coptic Monastery probably destroyed during the Muslim persecutions of the 14th Century CE.Larry W. Hurtado, The Freer Biblical Manuscripts. Fresh Studies of an American Treasure Trove, K. D. Clarke Paleography and Philanthropy pp. 45 When the manuscript was granted to H. Sanders, he had to go through a long and precarious process of separating the leaves of the codex, which due to decay had turned the parchment into a hard, glue-like substance, becoming a solid mass. H. Sanders describes in detail in The Old Testament Manuscripts in the Freer Collection, Part II: The Washington Manuscript of the Psalms, pp 107‚Äì109 how he separated the leaves of the codex, which effectively employed the use of a woollen cloth, and a thin-bladed dinner knife. Due to the fragmentary and fragile nature of the manuscript, Sanders was unable to separate more than two leaves in a day, having to create as accurate a collation as possible before further deterioration occurred on the leaves, and as such his reprint of the text shows letters that are now no longer extant. The manuscript is one of the six main manuscripts that comprise the Freer Biblical Manuscripts, currently housed at The Freer Gallery of Art. References Further reading * H.

A right-handed pitcher, he played in Japan for the Nishitetsu Lions. Ikenaga was one of the top pitchers in Nippon Professional Baseball before a scandal derailed his career at age 23. Before being implicated in the Black Mist Scandal, he made five consecutive All-Star teams at the beginning of his career, and was in the top 10 in ERA every season of his career.  Biography  Ikenaga attended Shimonoseki Shogyo High School, with his school baseball team winning the spring 1963 Koshien Tournament. He made his debut for the Nishitetsu Lions in 1965 at age 18, winning 20 games (3rd in the league) with a 2.27 ERA (5th in the league), and establishing himself as the team's ace. That year he made the Pacific League (PL) All-Star team, and was named the PL Rookie of the Year. In 1966 he posted a 15-14 record with a 2.18 ERA, again fifth in the PL. 1967 was Ikenaga's most productive season, as he went 23-14 with a 2.31 ERA. He led the PL in wins, complete games (19), shutouts (6) and innings pitched (335-1/3). 1968 saw Ikenaga go 23-13, with a 2.45 ERA (3rd in the PL). The 1969 season saw Ikenaga post an 18-11 record and a 2.57 ERA, finishing 3rd in the league in wins.  Black Mist scandal  In 1970 Ikenaga started the season 4-3 with a 2.60 ERA. On April 1 of that year, disgraced former Lions pitcher Masayuki Nagayasu gave an exclusive tape-recorded interview to the Sh≈´kan Post newspaper that revealed other players on his former team were also involved in game-fixing during the 1969 season.Associated Press. \\"3 Suspended for Baseball for Life,\\" The Day (May 28, 1970). Of the seven players summoned by the league to testify on their involvement, one of them was Ikenaga. Ikenaga admitted taking money from gamblers via fellow pitcher Tsutomu Tanaka of the Chunichi Dragons (a former teammate ‚Äî Tanaka pitched for Nishitetsu from 1961‚Äì1967), but said he did not let it affect his play. (Nonetheless, he did not return the 1 million yen he had received from Tanaka.)McKenna, Brian. Early Exits: The Premature Endings of Baseball Careers (Scarecrow Press, 2007), p. 17. On May 25, the NPB commissioner committee banned Ikenaga for life. Ikenaga's banning was fiercely contested by both Nishitetsu's front office and Ikenaga's own family. He finished his NPB career with a 103-65 record and a 2.36 ERA. = Reinstatement = Ikenaga's case was not taken up by NPB until March 2005, when commissioner Yasuchika Negoro and owners agreed on a bylaw that allowed banned players who have reformed themselves to petition for a removal of the ban.\\"Japan welcoming back players who fixed games,\\" Yomiuri Shimbun (March 23, 2005). Archived on MarlinsBaseball.com. This occurred after a nine- year campaign by baseball fans and residents of his hometown. Ikenaga requested a removal soon afterwards, and on April 25, 2005, he was allowed to return to baseball.

It has also been proposed and then refuted at the ribbon synapses formed between inner hair cell and spiral ganglion neurons.

Early life  Oehme grew up in Wissmannhof in Chemnitz. After leaving school in 1947, he began an apprenticeship at the Illge nursery. Upon completing his apprenticeship, he worked in an urban garden office, where he was a landscape architect with Hans-Joachim Bauer, and became familiar with the landscaping ideas of Karl Foerster. From 1952, he worked at the Spaeth nursery in Baumschulenweg in East Berlin. Oehme studied from 1952 to 1954 in Dahlem with a scholarship in landscape architecture. In 1953, he helped on the site of the International Garden Festival in Old Elbpark in Hamburg to create trenches. He admired the designer of the Expo, Karl Plomin.Stefan Leppert: Ornamental Grasses. Wolfgang Oehme and the New American Garden. Francis Lincoln, London 2009, P. 15. Oehme moved in 1953 to West Berlin. Career After graduation, Oehme worked in the nursery of Waterer Sons & Crisp in Bagshot and then got a job with the city parks department in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. From 1956 he was employed by the Delius company in Nuremberg. Oehme, a great admirer of the works of Karl MayStefan Leppert: Ornamental Grasses. Wolfgang Oehme and the New American Garden. Francis Lincoln, London 2009, P. 23. emigrated in 1957 on the recommendation of Hubert Owens from Nuremberg to the United States. Initially, he worked for landscape architect Bruce Baetjer before 1959 in the Baltimore County Office of Planning and was hired by the Baltimore County Recreation and Parks as a landscape architect. He designed, among other things, playgrounds and golf courses. The Towson (Md.) Courthouse, with landscaping by Oehme Later, in 1988, he designed the acclaimed landscaping at Baltimore County's Old Courthouse in Towson, Maryland. In 1966, Oehme joined the Rouse Company in Maryland and designed gardens with ornamental grasses and perennials, but without lawns. His work was difficult because there were hardly any nurseries that sold suitable plants.Stefan Leppert: Ornamental Grasses. Wolfgang Oehme and the New American Garden. Francis Lincoln, London 2009, P. 25. With the help of Leo Vollmer, and partner Kurt Bluemel, he found a nursery that could provide appropriate plants. In 1977, Oehme and the American landscape architect Sweden James created his own firm in Washington, D.C., Oehme, van Sweden & Associates (OvS). In 2008 he retired from the company and founded, with Carol Oppenheimer, the WOCO Organic Gardens LLC. He often went to Germany to buy plants and botanical gardens, and visited the national garden shows. He also smuggled, hidden in a hollowed-out book, seeds in the United States, since the selection of ornamental plants here was initially very limited. Even relatives in Germany sent him seeds.Stefan Leppert: Ornamental Grasses. Wolfgang Oehme and the New American Garden. Francis Lincoln, London 2009, P. 32. In his later years he became increasingly eccentric, his lack of feeling for finances led to conflicts within the company. Personal life and death Oehme was married to Shirley Zinkhan, the marriage ended in divorce in 2004. From the marriage was a son, Roland Oehme. Oehme died at the age of 81 from stomach cancer. The English garden author Noel Kingsbury describes Oehme as a loner, for whom only his gardens were important. He relates how Oehme visited a garden designed by him and saw that impatiens had been planted by the owner, which displeased the architect. When asked about this, he said: \\"This is my garden, not yours!\\".  Awards and affiliations  Oehme was a member of the American Society of Landscape Architects. In 1992, he received the \\"Landscape Design Award\\" from the American Horticultural Society, 2002, the George Robert White Medal of Honor, and the 2011 Longhouse Award.

Tempe, Bloemfontein The School of Armour was then subsequently re- sited to Bloemfontein on 1 April 1966, co-locating with the then 2nd Armoured Car Regiment at Tempe. Operational Wing Whilst primarily a Training unit, varying in a number of squadrons and roles, the School of Armour also maintained an operational capability in the form of a Tank Wing. Border War From this Wing, the School deployed a tank Squadron to operations in Angola in late 1987. The first operational use of Olifant tanks was carried out by the School in South-West Africa (Angola), acting as a defensive option against potential Cuban or Angolan incursions into that territory. The first actual engagement occurred during Operation Modular, with Echo Squadron.

Her older sister Shannon (Judy Greer) is a sex addict and frequently goes to rehab. Since Shannon has no job and needs to gain employment, Martha offers her a job as a housekeeper at the hotel. As a celebration for Shannon's first day on the job, they go to a local bar. After Shannon's celebration, Martha takes her back to her house and tells her where things are while she is away. However, she secretly sneaks off to her boyfriend Edwin's (Ron Livingston) house. Edwin is married but enjoys having an affair with Shannon. Meanwhile, Martha works out at the gym. Her trainer Kelly (Aubrey Plaza) starts to take interest in her. Next morning at the hotel, Shannon and Martha meet a guy named Boris (Jon Daly), a slob who says that he knows everyone at the hotel. While taking a break, Shannon calls Edwin again. Edwin tells Shannon that he gave his wife a letter and had left her the minute she got it. Realizing that Edwin cannot go back to his wife, Shannon takes her anger out by going to Boris‚Äô room to have sex with him. Martha catches her in the act after she hears her scream in the distance. While Shannon defends herself from Boris, she accidentally kills him. Desperate to cover up the murder, they sneak Boris‚Äô corpse out of the hotel. After sneaking out of the hotel, they take the corpse to Boris‚Äô family who has taken a disliking towards him. Shannon, posing as Boris‚Äô life guru, meets his sister Margaret. Margaret invites Shannon in to convince her parents that Boris has moved on in life and has left Fresno to never come back or to talk to his family again. Martha and Shannon take the corpse over to their friends Gerald (Fred Armisen) and Ruby (Allison Tolman) who own a pet cemetery. After uncovering Boris‚Äô corpse, they at first threaten to call the police, but then decide to blackmail the sisters for $25,000 by Monday in exchange for covering up the murder, threatening to charge them with manslaughter if they are unable to come up with the money. They, at first, attempt to rob an adult store to steal all the merchandise and try to sell them to girls at an event being held at the local hotel they work at, only to find out they did not make enough money. To take the stress off, Martha goes to the gym while Shannon hooks up with her co-worker Eric (Malcolm Barrett). At the gym, Kelly informs Martha that one of her students is having a bar mitzvah and that she wants to bring Martha along as a date. After the gym, Martha returns and catches Shannon making out with Eric, much to her annoyance. While discussing the bar mitzvah the next day, they realize they can steal all of the money. Martha and Shannon double date with Kelly and Eric. Martha pretends she is choking on something to distract the crowd long enough to steal the money. Kelly asks to bring Martha back to her house to keep an eye on her, but Martha rejects. Kelly confesses that she is attracted to Martha, but Martha blows her off by telling her about her sister who has problems. After the bar mitzvah, they realize they only stole $12,000, which is not enough money for Gerald and Ruby. Ruby, however reluctantly agrees to cremate Boris‚Äô corpse. They then arrange a fake funeral for her dead ‚Äúdog‚Äù. Martha discovers Shannon having sex with Gerald, which is the final straw for Martha. Shannon tries to apologize, but Martha tells her that she is tired of helping her and that she does not want her to go back to her place. Martha goes to reconcile with Kelly, and Shannon comes across Margaret who thanks her for the advice that Shannon gave. Realizing she has no one to talk to, she turns herself in. Two years later, it is revealed that she and Martha write letters to each other while Shannon is in prison, stating that ‚ÄúI hate you which in case you forgot means I love you like a sister.‚Äù Cast * Judy Greer as Shannon Jackson * Natasha Lyonne as Martha Jackson * Aubrey Plaza as Kelly * Ron Livingston as Edwin * Allison Tolman as Ruby * Fred Armisen as Gerald * Clea DuVall as Regina * Molly Shannon as Margaret * Jon Daly as Boris * Jessica St. Clair as Kristen * Malcolm Barrett as Eric * Michael Hitchcock as David * Kumail Nanjiani as Damon * Alan Mandell as Arthur Lipka Production While writing the script Karey Dornetto partially drew upon her own past relationship with her sister, wondering, \\"What if I still lived in my same hometown and we were in this sort of a meshed relationship, like a co- dependent relationship?\\". From there she began to add the film's fictional elements such as Shannon's sex addiction. Filming was initially intended to take place in Cleveland, but due to budget issues Dornetto and Jamie Babbit had to shift the film's setting to Fresno, a location they chose because it seemed like it was a city people wanted to get away from. The film was workshopped as part of the \\"Made in Cleveland\\" project, an anthology of 11 short films. Shot in Cleveland in 2012 and released in theaters in 2013, the short film was called Fucking Cleveland, starred Busy Philipps and Gillian Jacobs in the lead roles, and was shot on a budget of $50,000. In August 2014, it was announced that Judy Greer and Natasha Lyonne would portray the two central characters of Fresno, marking the second time Lyonne had worked with Babbit. The two actresses stated that part of the reason that they chose to act in the film was because their characters were atypical to how they were traditionally cast, as Lyonne is usually cast as a \\"trainwreck\\" while Greer was usually the \\"levelheaded\\" character. The actors were encouraged to engage in improvisation, though they stayed close to the script. Influences included Welcome to the Dollhouse, Bottle Rocket, and Bridesmaids. Shooting took place in Los Angeles. Reception In a mixed review, Crave Online wrote that it \\"is full of gleeful raunchiness and a registered sex offender or two, but not much actual comedy.\\" The Austin Chronicle wrote, \\"This heavy comedy, scripted by Karey Dornetto, delivers its expected yield of snappy and emotionally charged levity from a charismatic cast that also features Fred Armisen, Molly Shannon, and Aubrey Plaza in supporting roles. But as the story's centerpiece, Greer's character ultimately gives the audience too little to root for. Insufferable and unrepentant until far too late, we don't feel conflicted like we should when her lone true ally finally says 'enough is enough.' And although it's hard to pry our eyes away from such a cool cast, by that time the feeling is mutual.\\" Variety was also mixed in their opinion, as they felt that the work would likely not gather the cult following that Babbit's 1999 film But I‚Äôm a Cheerleader received and that Fresno was overall \\"a mean- spirited farce whose strenuous bad taste seldom translates into actual laughs.\\" Slant Magazine wrote, \\"Brightly lit and cheerfully acted, Jamie Babbit's Fresno pushes its not-so-funny premise almost to the breaking point, sacrificing character development on the altar of comedy along the way.\\" Aaron Hillis of The Village Voice called the film \\"Consistently frickin' hilarious. Perfect cast.\\" Flavorwire wrote, \\"As a performer's showcase, it's hard to beat. Judy Greer and Natasha Lyonne anchor it with a priceless good sister/bad sister dynamic; Lyonne is atypically sunny (and typically delightful) while Greer, as a bitter burnout, puts a sharp little spin on every line, turning each into a little dagger. Aubrey Plaza also shines in a brief but juicy bit as a would-be love interest for Lyonne.\\" Release The film had its world premiere at the SXSW Film Festival on March 14, 2015.

The most well-known international sports event is the Olympic Games. Other examples include the FIFA World Cup and the Paralympic Games. The cricket match played between the United States and Canada is the first ever International match played in any sport. Modern international sports events are big business for as well as influencing the political, economical, and other cultural aspects of countries around the world. Especially with politics and sports, sports can affect countries, their identities, and in consequence, the world. History The ancient Olympic Games were a series of competitions held between representatives of several city-states and kingdoms from Ancient Greece, which featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events. During the Olympic games, all struggles between the participating city-states were postponed until the games were finished. The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend.Young (2004), p. 12 During the 19th century, the Olympic Games became a popular global event. Economics While some economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasizing that such \\"mega-events\\" often have large costs, hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games. Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.Tilcsik, A. and Marquis, C. 2013. \\"Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities.\\" Administrative Science Quarterly, 58(1): 111‚Äì148.. The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups. Globalization has continually increased international competition in sports. The FIFA World Cup, for example, is the world's most widely viewed sporting event; an estimated 700 million people watched the final match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa. According to a 2011 A.T. Kearney study of sports teams, leagues and federations, the global sports industry is worth between ‚Ç¨350 billion and ‚Ç¨450 billion (US$480-$620 billion). The Sports Market (2011). A.T. Kearney. This includes infrastructure construction, sporting goods, licensed products and live sports events.  Olympic Games factor of the globalization of sports   An international retransmission  The Olympics are a major factor in the globalization of sport. The Olympic symbol is the most recognized symbol, and the Olympic Games are broadcast around the world. This represents 4.5 billion of people for the 2008 Summer Olympics..  Olympic Games globalization The Olympic Games have also undergone globalization. The first Olympic Games of the modern era were held in 1896, only 9 disciplines were present and 241 athletes but only men. The place of women is representative of the position of women in society, and from the first Olympiad 1900 women participated but unofficially. It is in 1920 that the first women were officially part of the Olympic Games. The number of athletes present at each Olympiad hast been increasing significantly since the first Olympiad: * In 1896 at the first Olympic games 14 countries were represented by 241 athletes for 43 events; * 1960 Rome Olympic games have grouped 83 countries for a total of 5338 athletes who competed in 150 different events; * London 2012, 204 countries were present representing 10,568 athletes for a total of 302 events.

Due to its hygienic problem and the deaths of the license holders, dai pai dong closed down and was replaced by different kinds of restaurant. There are only 25 dai pai dong left in Hong Kong, according to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, which manages the licenses. Nevertheless, because of voices about preserving local food culture, it is suggested that licenses should be issued again to the vendors and the dai pai dong owners.(Chinese)https://hk.news.yahoo.com/Â∞èË≤©ÂÜçÁôºÁâåÈ†àÂú∞ÂçÄÊîØÊåÅ-221114515.html Â∞èË≤©ÂÜçÁôºÁâåÈ†àÂú∞ÂçÄÊîØÊåÅ, ÊòüÂ≥∂Êó•Â†±(2015Âπ¥2Êúà26Êó•)(Chinese)http://www.881903.com/Page/ZH- TW/newsdetail.aspx?ItemId=782608&csid;=261_341 È£üË°õÂ±ÄÂª∫Ë≠∞Á∞ΩÁôºÊñ∞Â∞èË≤©ÂèäÂ§ßÊéíÊ™îÁâåÁÖß, ÂïÜÊ•≠ÈõªÂè∞(2015Âπ¥3Êúà2Êó•) Besides, there are several changes of dai pai dong due to the urban development.  Background  Dai Pai Dong were popular among working class due to its cheap price in the 1950s and they earned the nickname ‚Äúpoor people‚Äôs nightclub‚Äù. However, the rise of hygiene and traffic congestion complaints forced the government to stop issuing ‚Äúbig licenses‚Äù in 1956 and limited their transfer due to black market of selling licenses. The licensees could only transfer the licenses to their spouses upon their death, not even their children. If the licensees did not have a spouse, the license would expire.(Chinese)Ë°óÈÇäÊúâÊ™îÂ§ßÁâåÊ™î ËéäÁéâÊÉúËëó È¶ôÊ∏ØÔºö‰∏âËÅØÊõ∏Â∫ó (È¶ôÊ∏Ø) 2011 In 1975, with the opening of the first cooked food center, a lot of dai pai dong moved into these center and markets for easy control. In 1983, the government began to buy back licenses from the holders to improve public hygiene. Since the licenses could not be transferred, many aged license holders chose to sell their licenses to the government. The number of dai pai dong in Hong Kong dropped significantly. There were 68 dai pai dong in Kowloon City. But now there is none. Now, there are only 25 dai pai dong remaining in Hong Kong: 11 in Sham Shui Po, 10 in Central, three in Wan Chai and one in Tai O. Only a few of them are still on the streets in the traditional style. Nevertheless, while the traditional food stalls, which represent Hong Kong local food culture, closed down one by one because of urban development, there are voices suggesting preserving dai pai dong.(Chinese) http://paper.wenweipo.com/2005/07/31/HK0507310045.htm Ê∞ëÂúíÈ∫µÂÆ∂ÂîèÂôìËÅ≤‰∏≠ÁµêÊ•≠, ÊñáÂåØÂ†±(2005Âπ¥7Êúà31Êó•) At the same time, it is to preserve Hong Kong people collective memories.  Controversy  In 2005, the closing down of several local food stalls like Man Yuen Noodles has raised voices of preserving local food culture, including dai pai dong. About preserving dai pai dong, there are both agreeing and disagreeing. For the Agree side:  Food and Health Bureau  Preserving dai pai dongs and vendors helps Hong Kong to promote tourism, protect local culture, create job opportunities as well as alleviate proverty. Should the government finalises the decision of preserving local food culture, the Bureau will coordinate with the government.  Hong Kong citizens Not only do dai pai dongs represent Hong Kong traditional food culture, but also people‚Äôs collective memory.
