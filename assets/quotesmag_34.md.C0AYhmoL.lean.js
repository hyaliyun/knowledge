History The mud carp is a native Asian freshwater fish with a broad distribution from the Mekong River to the Pearl River deltas, inhabiting lakes, rivers and reservoirs. Mud carp cultivation was introduced to China during Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907 AD) as a substitute for Common carp as the common carp was forbidden to fish due to a ban. Habitat The mud carp is found in Mekong River and Pearl River delta, as well as bodies of freshwater along these two rivers. The fish has been introduced to Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Within China the fish is raised on fish farms.  Dispersion  Mekong River, Chao Phraya River, Mae Klong River and Tapee River Basin in the south of Thailand  Utilization  Fishery: Trade; Aquaculture: Trade Diet Mud carp is an omnivore and mainly consumes water plants or insects. Farm raised carp are fed pellets. Food Due to low cost of production, the fish is mainly consumed by the poor and locally consumed; it is mostly sold live and eaten fresh, but can be dried and salted. Increase of hunting has threatened the number of mud carp. The fish is sometimes canned (typically as Fried dace with salted black beans) or processed as fish cakes, fish balls or dumplings. They can be found for retail sale within China.

They form small clusters of plants with their tubers connected, each tuber with one or two leaves. The flowers are inconspicuous. Description Orchids in the genus Townsonia are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs which grow in small groups with their tubers connected by a fleshy root. Each tuber produces one or two leaves. The leaves are very thin with wavy margins. Those on non-flowering plants have a relatively long, fleshy petiole near ground level. Flowering plants have a similar leaf but lack a petiole, the leaf on the side of a brittle flowering stem. The flowers are small and pale coloured and have a dorsal sepal wider than the lateral sepals. The petals are much smaller than the sepals. The labellum is much different in size and shape from the petals and sepals, folded lengthwise with a narrow, ridge-like callus along the mid- line. Taxonomy and naming Townsonia was first formally described in 1906 by Thomas Frederic Cheeseman who published the description in Manual of the New Zealand Flora. Cheeseman described T. deflexa in the same publication making it the type species. Townsonia deflexa occurs in New Zealand. The name Townsonia honours \\"Mr. W. Townson, of Westport\\", who discovered the species. The only other species in this genus, Townsonia viridis is a Tasmanian endemic.

Plants in this genus are usually epiphytes, sometimes lithophytes or rarely terrestrials. Some species have pseudobulbs with up to three leaves, whilst others have several leaves in two ranks. A large number of small, white or greenish yellow flowers are borne on a thin, arching flowering stem. There are about thirty species, distributed from tropical and subtropical Asia to the southwest Pacific. Description Plants in the genus Thelasis are mostly epiphytic or lithophytic, rarely terrestrial sympodial herbs with thin roots. They often have small pseudobulbs with up to three leaves but sometimes have flattened stems with several leaves in two ranks. Many small white or greenish yellow flowers are crowded on a thin arching flowering stem. The flowers are resupinate, tube-shaped near the base with sepals and petals free from and similar to each other although with the petals usually shorter and narrower. The labellum is stiffly attached to the base of the column and lacks lobes. Taxonomy and naming The genus Thelasis was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume who published the description in Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi√´ . The name Thelasis is derived from the Ancient Greek word thelazo meaning \\"suckle\\" or \\"nurse\\", possibly referring to a small nipple-like structure on the column.

The Pharnacid dynasty was a Persian dynasty that ruled the satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia under the Achaemenid Dynasty from the 5th until the 4th century BCE. It was founded by Artabazus, son of satrap Pharnaces I (younger brother of Hystaspes, who was born shortly before 565 BCE), son of Arsames (died ca. 520 BCE). They were directly related to the Achaemenid dynasty itself. The last member of the dynasty was Pharnabazus III. Before the Pharnacids, Mitrobates (ca. 525‚Äì522 BCE) had ruled Hellespontine Phrygia for Cyrus the Great and Cambyses II, before being killed and his territory absorbed by the satrap of Lydia, Oroetes. Following the reorganization of Darius I, Mitrobates was succeeded by Oebares II (c.493), son of Megabazus, before Artabazus became satrap circa 479 BCE and started the Pharnacid dynasty, which would rule Hellespontine Phrygia until the conquests of Alexander the Great (338 BCE). The residence of the Pharnacid Dynasty was at Dascylium (near modern-day Ergili, Turkey). After the conquests of Alexander the Great, several women of the Pharnacid family, all daughters of Artabazos II, married Alexandrine nobility: Artonis married Eumenes, Artakama married Ptolemy I, while Barsine may have married Alexander the Great and given him a son, Heracles of Macedon.

Plants in this genus are terrestrial herbs with a succulent rhizome and a loose rosette of leaves. Small, pale, hairy non-resupinate flowers are borne on a thin, hairy flowering stem. They are found in tropical Africa and Asia to New Guinea, Australia and some Pacific Islands. Description Orchids in the genus Hetaeria are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with a creeping, succulent, above-ground rhizome anchored to the ground by wiry roots. The leaves are dark green, usually narrow, thin-textured and arranged in a loose rosette with a short petiole-like base, the lower leaves usually withered by flowering time. The flowers are non-resupinate and usually small, dull-coloured and hairy with the dorsal sepal and petals joined to form a hood over the column. The labellum is glabrous and has a deep pouch near its base. Taxonomy and naming The genus Hetaeria was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume and the description was published in Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi√´. (Blume gave the name Etaeria, but Hetaeria is a conserved name.) The name Hetaeria is an Ancient Greek word meaning \\"comrade\\" or \\"companion\\".

The two church congregations - Lutheran and United Church of Christ - date back to 1746. The log cabin they shared and used for separate services no longer stands, but an outline of the foundation is still found on premises. The second church built on the site, the Old Belleman's church, was built in 1814 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. While it has not been updated for electricity and plumbing, the Georgian-style church features many styles and motifs not seen in many 19th century rural churches. The church embellishes many of the fine points of architecture such as an elaborate cornice, Palladian windows, arched windows, detailed doorways and a gallery. Particular focal points are the wineglass pulpit and a hand-pump organ. The building is used several times per year during warmer months, for Sunday services, weddings, and annual \\"Hymn Sings\\" and a service in the Pennsylvania German dialect. The third church was constructed in 1924. Beginning in 2003, the two congregations have shared a pastor and hold shared services, as well as a shared choir, committees, and youth groups, but still maintain their separate identities. The church is home to the Boy Scouts of America Troop 154 of Dauberville, Pa.  Gallery  File:Old Belleman's Union Church 03.JPGFront side.

The only A.M.E. church in Berks County to have been built using private resources from its congregation, Bethel A.M.E. was founded by George Dillen, Samuel Murray, Isaac Parker, and Jacob Ross.

Underground Railroad Among the earliest abolitionists in Berks County were the owners of Fleetwood's Kirbyville Inn, Robeson Township's Joanna Furnace, and Scarlett's Mill, as well as members of religious institutions throughout the region, who provided safe havens for the men, women and children who were escaping from slavery before and during the American Civil War. The Bethel A.M.E. Church and Washington Presbyterian Church were two of the institutions which served as way stations along the Underground Railroad.Nojiri, Matthew. \\"History center talk on Underground Railroad has Pennsylvania angle.\\" Reading, Pennsylvania: Reading Eagle, February 10, 2018. The most famous slavery case to take place in Berks County, according to historian Barbara Goda, occurred in February 1840 when a group of slave catchers traveled to the county from Maryland, and began \\"wandering about town for several days and examining all of the African Americans they could find.\\" Encountering a man they called \\"James Turner,\\" they \\"locked him up as a fugitive,\\" a shocking act to many across Pennsylvania because this was \\"the first arrest of this kind in the memory of local residents.\\" In response, a trial was held during which one of the church's founders, Jacob Ross, informed the judicial officer overseeing the case, Judge Banks, that the slave catchers had, in reality, imprisoned a free man ‚Äî Harry Jones, a member of the Bethel A.M.E. congregation who had been living in Reading, Pennsylvania for roughly six years, and who had just recently married his wife during ceremonies at Bethel. \\"Judge Banks, in a lengthy decision, explained that the slavery law of Maryland had not been offered into evidence, and he had no judicial knowledge of such legislation: 'Therefore there could be no legal proof that Turner or Jones owed service or labor to Cooley' (his alleged Maryland owner),\\" and Jones was freed.Goda, \\"African-American Women in Berks County‚Äôs History,\\" Berks History Center.

Childhood His father had intended Henry before his sixteenth birthday to marry one of the daughters of Sir John Basset (1462‚Äì1528), of Tehidy in Cornwall, and Whitechapel in Devon, and at some time before December 1504 for that eventual purpose had taken into his household two of Basset's daughters, Anne Basset and Thomasine Basset, to give the 11 year-old Henry a choice for a future bride.Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago & London, 1981, for summary of the Basset-Daubeney contract see: vol.1, pp. 312‚Äì3; for a detailed treatment see vol.4, pp. 1‚Äì11 & vol.5, pp. 167‚Äì169,176, 183, 187-9, 216-7, 239, However no such marriage took place, possibly due to his father's early death four years later in 1508Byrne, vol.1, p.312 and Henry's subsequent entry into the wardship of his mother Elizabeth, who at the same time obtained his marriage \\"without disparagement\\", apparently an escape clause from the contract.Byrne, vol. 4, p.9 In 1511 Anne Basset married James Courtenay, so it appears the contract had been abandoned by that time.Byrne, vol. 4, p.10 The proposed Daubeney-Basset marriage was the result of Henry's father having invested heavily, in excess of 3,000 marks, to enable John Basset to redeem his substantial inheritance from the Beaumont family, comprising amongst others the Devonshire manors of Shirwell, Umberleigh and Heanton Punchardon. The redemption of these lands by Daubeney snr. was part of the \\"great indenture\\" of 11 December 1504Transcript in Byrne, vol. 4, chapter 7, appendix 2, pp. 95‚Äì103 made with Basset, which would require ownership of the lands to descend to the male issue of the marriage between Henry Daubeney and one of the Basset daughters. Even though he had failed to meet his part of the bargain of marrying one of the Basset daughters, Henry spent considerable effort in later life trying to prevent the Basset family obtaining the reversion of these properties, as the indenture provided for. The dispute figures prominently in the Lisle Letters.Byrne, vol.5, p.187; especially from May 1536 Indeed, Henry tried to alienate the Beaumont lands to Edward Seymour,Byrne, vol.5, p.146 the queen's brother, then trying to build up a Devon estate,Byrne, vol.5, p.189 who was also a key influence in obtaining Henry's earldom.Byrne, vol.5, p.183 Career In 1513 Lord Daubeney served at the Battle of the Spurs and in 1520 was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, together with his first wife, as well as at the Calais Congress of 1532.Byrne, vol. 4, p.10 He was advanced as Earl of Bridgewater on 19 July 1538. Marriages Henry married twice but left no children: *Firstly to Elizabeth Neville, the daughter of George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny, by his first wife, Lady Joan FitzAlan (died 1508), daughter of Thomas FitzAlan, 17th Earl of Arundel, and Margaret Woodville (died 1492), second daughter of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, and a younger sister of Elizabeth Woodville, wife of King Edward IV. *Secondly to Lady Katherine Howard (died 1554), daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk by his second wife Agnes Tilney (died 1545). They married sometime after 1531, the year her first husband was executed. They quarreled by 1535 and sought a divorce.Byrne, vol.4, p.10 Death and succession There was no issue from either marriage, and upon his death in 1548 the barony of Daubeney and the earldom of Bridgewater became extinct.

He \\"wrote, directed, and produced extensively for the stage, television, radio, and his own media consulting and production firm\\".  Early life and education  William Blackwell Branch was born September 11, 1927, to James Matthew Branch, an African Methodist Episcopal Zion minister, and Iola Douglas Branch, in New Haven, Connecticut. Branch attended high schools in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C. He went on to earn his undergraduate degree in Science at Northwestern University in 1949, then continued his education at Columbia University, graduating with his M.F.A. in dramatic arts in 1958. Branch later studied at Yale University, after which he taught at Cornell University and William Paterson College from 1994 to 1996, before beginning a career in entertainment, focusing specifically drama.  Career and themes  Branch involved himself in the entertainment world because he \\"became convinced that only African Americans could truthfully write and produce theater about African Americans.\\" His first play was A Medal for Willie, written when he was 27. It launched Branch's career, leading to success and much recognition for his work. His writing characteristically \\"deals with the place and recognition of the African American in pre-civil rights America.\\" He pointed out how American society was flawed in its treatment African Americans, and \\"the irony of the black soldier fighting for the freedom of others in another country and yet being denied those same basic freedoms and rights in his own country.\\" Branch also highlighted racial stereotypes, allowing audiences to see the lies behind the stereotypes about African Americans. Other issues featured in his work include feminism and familial relations. His play Baccalaureate: Drama in Three Acts is about a young African-American female in a middle-class family, discussing the struggles she faces when it came to education. Through his plays, such as In Splendid Error (1954) which tells in part the story of Frederick Douglas and his relationship with John Brown, A Wreath for Udomo (1961), Fifty Steps Toward Freedom (1970), and A Medal for Willie (1985), Branch explored and demonstrated societal problems in the unfair treatment of African Americans. He explained through these plays how wrongly African Americans were represented and the struggles they had within the middle class. After beginning his career as a playwright, Branch went on to become involved in films. In 1968 he produced Still a Brother: Inside the Black Middle Class in 1968, which touched on similar themes as those in his plays. Due to Branch's beliefs in African-American culture and who he thought was suitable to truthfully produce and project this culture to the public, he began to write and direct films to display his culture in a truthful manner. Branch remained a playwright following World War II, creating pieces that were seen as dramas. Branch believed in telling the truth of African-American culture, arguing that only African Americans can tell the stories of how they were treated or represented.  Awards and recognition  Branch was awarded for several different areas of his work. Branch was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship grant for playwriting. Along with this award Branch received \\"a Robert E. Sherwood Television Award; and a citation from the National Conference of Christians and Jews (NCCJ)-the latter two are for his NBC television drama Light in the Southern Sky‚Ä¶ Other honors included an American Film Festival Blue Ribbon Award and an Emmy nomination shared with fellow producer William Greaves for the PBS documentary film Still a Brother: Inside the Negro Middle Class and an NCCJ Citation for his PBS drama A Letter from Booker T‚Ä¶. Although Branch received awards and nominations he was noted for much of his other work, discussing racial, societal, and class issues as well as other topics that were not awarded or nominated.

On that occasion he received King Theodoric's permission to celebrate the event with venationes in the Colosseum, the last games ever held there, but later the king complained about the waste of money these entailed.

It tells the story of Thierry Guetta, a French immigrant in Los Angeles, and his obsession with street art. The film charts Guetta's constant documenting of his every waking moment on film, from a chance encounter with his cousin, the artist Invader, to his introduction to a host of street artists with a focus on Shepard Fairey and Banksy, whose anonymity is preserved by obscuring his face and altering his voice, to Guetta's eventual fame as a street artist himself. It is narrated by Rhys Ifans. The music is by Geoff Barrow. It includes Richard Hawley's \\"Tonight The Streets Are Ours\\".Willmore, Alison, \\"Exit Through The Gift Shop: It's a madhouse, this modern life.\\", The Independent Eye, IFC reviews of the Sundance Film Festival, 27 January 2010 The film premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 2010, and it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Since its release, there has been extensive debate over whether the documentary is genuine or a mockumentary, although Banksy answered \\"Yes\\" when asked if the film is real. Synopsis Thierry Guetta is a French immigrant living in Los Angeles who runs a vintage clothing shop. He also has an obsession with carrying a camera everywhere and constantly filming his surroundings. On a holiday in France, he discovers his cousin is Invader, an internationally known street artist. Thierry finds this fascinating, and accompanies Invader and his friends, including the artists Monsieur Andr√© and Zevs on their nocturnal adventures, documenting their activities. A few months later, Invader visits Thierry in LA, and arranges a meeting with Shepard Fairey. Thierry continues filming Fairey's activities even after Invader has returned home to France. While Fairey is confused by Thierry's enthusiasm, Thierry states that he wishes to make a complete documentary about street art, and the two cross the nation, filming other artists at work, including Poster Boy, Seizer, Neck Face, Sweet Toof, Cyclops, Ron English, Dotmasters, Swoon, Azil, Borf and Buff Monster. What Guetta fails to tell Fairey is that he has no plan to compile his footage into an actual film, and never looks at his footage. Guetta continues to hear more about Banksy‚Äîa prominent and particularly secretive artist. His attempts to contact Banksy are unsuccessful, until one day Banksy visits LA without his usual accomplice, who is refused entry to the US. Stuck in LA without a guide, Banksy contacts Fairey, who calls Guetta. Guetta becomes Banksy's guide in LA, later following him back to England, winning the privilege to film Banksy on his home turf‚Äîa feat that confuses Banksy's crew. Banksy, however, sees the opportunity to document street art, which he recognizes as having a \\"short life span\\", and after Guetta aids him in recording both production, deployment and crowd reactions to his \\"Murdered Phone-box\\" piece, asks him to film the preparations for his \\"Barely Legal\\" show. The two become friends, as Guetta provides Banksy with some relief from his anonymity. Returning to LA, Guetta becomes bored, and eventually produces his own stickers and decals, putting them up in the city. Banksy's show is being prepared in Skid Row, Los Angeles, and while in LA, Banksy decides deploying a Guantanamo Bay detainee doll in Disneyland. He visits the location and places the doll while Guetta films it. A short while later, however, the rides stop, and the park's security catch Guetta, who is taken to an interrogation room, while Banksy switches clothes and blends into the crowd. During interrogation, Guetta refuses to admit any wrongdoing, and when allowed a phone call, covertly alerts Banksy to his situation. When confronted by security personnel, he destroys the evidence in his stills camera, but stashes the videotape in his sock and is eventually let go, much to the amazement of Banksy who then says he trusts him implicitly because of the incident. A few days later, \\"Barely Legal\\" opens, and becomes an overnight success. Street art prices begin to rocket in auction houses. Banksy is stunned by the sudden hype surrounding street art, and urges Guetta to finish his supposed documentary. Guetta begins to edit together the several thousand hours of footage, and produces a film titled Life Remote Control. The result is 90 minutes of distorted fast cutting about random themes. Banksy questions Guetta's ability as a filmmaker, deeming his product \\"unwatchable\\", but realizes the street art footage itself is valuable. Banksy decides to try producing a film himself. To ensure that Guetta remains occupied, Banksy suggests he makes his own art show. Guetta accepts the assignment, adopting the name \\"Mr. Brainwash\\", putting up street art in the city and six months later, re-mortgaging his business to afford renting copious equipment and a complete production team to create pieces of art under his supervision. He rents a former CBS studio to prepare his first show, \\"Life Is Beautiful\\", and scales up his production to something much larger than Banksy suggested, but with little focus. When Guetta breaks his foot after falling off a ladder, Banksy realises that the show may become a trainwreck, and sends a few professionals to help Guetta out. While the producers take care of the practical side of the show, Guetta spends his time on more publicity, asking support from both Fairey and Banksy, eventually taping up huge billboards with their quotes, and ultimately ending up on the cover of LA Weekly. Preparation is seriously behind schedule, and Guetta's production team insists that he must make decisions--yet Guetta spends his time hyping up and marketing his work for tens of thousands of dollars. Eight hours before the opening, paintings are still missing from the walls, and since Guetta is busy giving interviews, the eventual layout of the show is decided by the crew itself. Despite all this, however, the show becomes a raging success with the crowd, and after the first week of the show, Guetta sells almost a million dollars' worth of art, with his pieces showing in galleries all around the world, to the utter confusion of both Fairey and Banksy. In an ending montage, Guetta insists that time will tell whether he is a real artist or not. Banksy states he will never again help someone make a documentary. Production Banksy has said in interviews that editing the film together was an arduous process, noting that \\"I spent a year [...] watching footage of sweaty vandals falling off ladders\\" and \\"The film was made by a very small team. It would have been even smaller if the editors didn't keep having mental breakdowns. They went through over 10,000 hours of Thierry's tapes and got literally seconds of usable footage out of it.\\" Producer Jaimie D'Cruz wrote in his production diary that obtaining the original tapes from Thierry was particularly complicated. Release and reception Film industry veterans John Sloss and Bart Walker founded a new distribution company to release the film in the US, Producers Distribution Agency (PDA). With a unique grassroots campaign, PDA brought the film to a US theatrical gross of $3.29MM. Oscilloscope Laboratories released Exit Through the Gift Shop on DVD and Blu-ray in 2011. The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96%, based on 113 reviews, and an average rating of 8.11/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"An amusing, engrossing look at underground art, Exit Through the Gift Shop entertains as it deflates the myths and hype surrounding its subjects.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". It was also nominated for Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 83rd Academy Awards. New York Film Critics Online bestowed its Best Documentary Award on the film in 2010. French journalist Marjolaine Gout gave it 4 stars out of 5, linking Mr. Brainwash and Jeff Koons and criticizing Thierry Guetta's art as toilet papering. Hoax speculation One consistent theme in the reviews was the authenticity of the film: Was the film just an elaborate ruse on Banksy's part, or did Guetta really evolve into Mr. Brainwash overnight? The Boston Globe movie reviewer Ty Burr found it to be quite entertaining and awarded it four stars. He dismissed the notion of the film being a \\"put on\\", saying that \\"I'm not buying it; for one thing, this story's too good, too weirdly rich, to be made up. For another, the movie's gently amused scorn lands on everyone.\\"Burr, Ty, \\"Exit Through the Gift Shop: Writing‚Äôs on the wall: In ‚ÄòExit,‚Äô street art scene becomes a farce\\", The Boston Globe, 23 April 2010 Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 stars out of 4, writing: \\"The widespread speculation that 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' is a hoax only adds to its fascination.\\" In an interview with SuicideGirls,. filmmakers Jaimie D'Cruz and Chris King denied that it was a hoax, and expressed their growing frustration with the speculation that it was: \\"For a while we all thought that was quite funny, but it went on for so long. It was a bit disappointing when it became basically accepted as fact, that it was all just a silly hoax ... I felt it was a shame that the whole thing was going to be dismissed like that really because we knew it was true.\\" The New York Times movie reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that the film could be a new subgenre, a \\"prankumentary\\".Catsoulis, Jeannette, \\"On the Street, at the Corner of Art and Trash\\", The New York Times, 16 April 2010.\\"‚ÄúExit‚Äù could be a new subgenre: the prankumentary. Audiences, however, would be advised simply to enjoy the film on its face ‚Äî even if that face is a carefully contrived mask.\\" Guetta in an interview said: \\"This movie is 100% real. Banksy captured me becoming an artist. In the end, I became his biggest work of art.\\"Felch, Jason, \\"Getting at the truth of 'Exit Through the Gift Shop'\\", The Los Angeles Times, 22 February 2011.

Friedman#Books and exhibitions with significant Friedman contributions (partial listing)4 successfully sued Guetta over the use of a photograph of the rap group Run-DMC.Run DMC Photograph Guetta tried to claim that he had altered it enough to be considered an original piece of art. However, the presiding judge over the case, Judge Pregerson, ultimately ruled Friedman's photograph was protected under the transformative fair use law. Guetta also faced copyright claims from Joachim Levy, a Swiss filmmaker, who edited and produced Guetta's film Life Remote Control, clips of which were shown in the film. Levy was not credited for his work he did on the film; however, Guetta owned the footage which was then licensed to Banksy.The New York Times, Life Remote Control footage lawsuit Archival footage The film's opening montage includes archival footage from the following street art films: Dirty Hands: The Art and Crimes of David Choe, Infamy, Megpoid, Next, Open Air, The Lyfe, Popaganda: The Art and Crimes of Ron English, Rash, Restless Debt of the Third World, Spending Time, Turf War, Elis G The Life of a Shadow, Memoria Canalla, C215 in London, Beautiful Losers.Credits, 'Archival footage', Exit Through the Gift Shop.

Built in 1853 St. Michael's congregation was founded in 1851, and the original church was built in 1853 on land donated by brothers Edward and George Brooke, proprietors of the Birdsboro Iron Foundry Company (later Birdsboro Steel Corporation). George designed the \\"Norman-Gothic\\" church building, and he and his brother donated the organ, the bell for its gable bellcote, and other interior and exterior improvements. The Parish House (probably designed by George) -- housing a chapel, the Sunday School, and a reading room -- was completed in 1873, and was a gift of the Brookes.Daniel K.

Later alterations -- changing the roof, moving the entrance to a 3-story addition (with bathrooms above), adding a bay window where the original entrance had been -- are attributed solely to Furness, and probably were done at the same time that the church was expanded.George E.

Furness lengthened the nave - adding east and west transepts and turning a simple box into a cruciform -- and tucked a bell-tower-with-steeple off to one side. The contractor, Levi H. Focht, was a resident of Birdsboro, and had built dozens of Furness-designed stations for the Reading Railroad (including the one in Birdsboro).Levi H. Focht from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. The church's exterior was clad in brownstone, with a wooden porte cochere built against the west transept (turning it into a carriage entrance), a colored-slate roof, and a large gold-plated cross crowning the steeple. Furness, son of the Unitarian minister William Henry Furness, experimented with some of the ideas from his contemporaneous First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia (1883‚Äì86). Both churches had soaring curved roof trusses, vividly colored walls, and high windows that bathed the sanctuary in natural light. For St. Michael's, Furness chose royal-blue ceilings and Etruscan-red walls accented with metallic-gold trim, a color scheme that he had used to dramatic effect at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.PAFA interior from GPTMC. \\"Furniss\\" (as the church historian misspelled the architect's name) also designed the church furniture -- altar, pews, etc. -- possibly fabricated by his frequent collaborator, Daniel Pabst.

The total cost of the improvements was in excess of $12,000, a gift of the Brooke family. The expanded church was consecrated on May 31, 1885. 1892 expansion The chancel was lengthened by 10 feet and widened by 6 feet in 1892, allowing the installation of choir stalls and moving the altar wall south to the Church Street sidewalk. This work was done by New York designer R. Geissler and contractor Levi H. Focht.Miller, pp. 35-36. At the same time, the Edward Brooke Memorial Window, created by Tiffany Studios in 1887, was removed from the east transept and installed over the altar. Over the decades, the church was embellished with additional stained-glass windows, including another by Tiffany Studios, and other adornments.Miller, pp. 32-33, 58-61. Decline Following years of decline, the Birdsboro Steel Corporation's plant closed in 1988, a severe economic blow to the town. By the time St. Michael's celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2001, the congregation had dwindled to the point of not being able to sustain a full-time minister.

Listed at 4' 10¬æ\\" (1.49 m), 104 lb. (47 k), Jameson batted right-handed and threw left-handed. She was born in Maywood, Illinois. AAGPBL career Of the original four players signed by Wrigley in 1943, Shirley Jameson was the second. The other two, besides Ann Harnett and Jameson, were Claire Schillace and Edythe Perlick. These players were carefully selected from the Chicago amateur softball association league to be the role models for the All American Girls' Professional League. The pickup of the right-center fielders, a second position peculiar to softball, was the diminutive Jameson, who had played for the Garden City Brew Maids. At twenty- three, with a middle-class background, she was a college graduate who was working as a physical education teacher at Triton College in River Grove, Illinois. Harnett, Jameson, Schillace and Perlick epitomized the carefully constructed image of feminine, attractive, well-manered ballplayers. Press releases and publicity photos showcased them. Notably, Jameson was one of the rare non-pitchers who threw left-handed but batted right-handed. Fast as lightning on the bases or in center field, she had a great throwing arm and was a competent leadoff hitter. Usually, opposing pitchers said she was one of the hardest hitters in the league, because of her small frame and her bat speed. Jameson played from 1943 to 1946 with the Kenosha Comets. In the inaugural season, she led the league with 126 stolen bases and posted career- numbers in games (105), batting average (.271), hits (108), runs batted in (32), and runs scored (111). At the end of the season, she was selected for the All-Star Team. A light hitter, Jameson posted a career .229 batting average in 385 games, which she compensated with a respectable .359 on-base percentage. She had the ability to get on base, by any means, way above than the pure hability to get the hit. She reached first base by walks, by a bunt single or being hit by the pitcher. A smart and aggressive baserunner, she stole 401 bases, but also knew when to take the additional base on an overthrow ‚Äì 41 of her 313 hits were for extrabases, and also walked 279 times. Following her baseball career, she became a talent scout for the All-American. The AAGPBL folded in 1954, but there is now a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum since November 5, that honors those who were part of this unforgettable experience. Jameson, along with the rest of the AAGPBL players, is now enshrined in the venerable building of Cooperstown, New York. She died in 1993 at the age of 75.

Edwards Life and academic career He was born in Argostoli, Cephalonia, in 1908. He excelled as a pupil and, like the minority of his generation who received schooling, he was taught through the medium of katharevousa‚Äîan archaic \\"pure\\" form of the Greek language. Outside school he was also attentive to the language and customs of his fellow islanders and became a master of Kephallonitika (Cephalonian dialect), an expertise that is evident in several of his earliest works about Cephalonian traditions. He studied philology and educational studies at the University of Athens in 1925‚Äì30. After graduation he was employed as a high-school teacher in Cephalonia, Athens, and subsequently in Kilkis. In 1938, he was commissioned by the renowned folklorist Georgios A. Megas to work as Editor for the Archives of Folklore at the Academy of Athens (now Centre for Greek Folklore Research). His work there was interrupted during World War II when, in 1940, he was sent to Albania to be part of the Greek army that repulsed Mussolini's troops. Loukatos' swan song was the publication of the diary notes he made during this campaign.Oplitis sto Alvaniko Metopo (\\"Soldier on the Albanian Front.\\" Potamos: Athens, 2001) After fighting for his fellow countrymen in the war, Dimitris Loukatos did not want to fight against them in the Greek Civil War that ensued. In 1947 he went to the Sorbonne, Paris, where he was awarded a doctorate in 1950. On his return to Greece he resumed his work as Editor at the Archives of Folklore. He married Zoe Bibikou and had a son, Sotiris. In his capacity as editor at the Archives of Folklore, he took an active part in many folklore projects, including research on his own native island of Cephalonia just after the devastating earthquake of 1953. In 1964 he was one of the three professors that started from scratch the newly created School of Philosophy at the University of Ioannina, a post he retained until 1969, when, finding it was not any more possible to cope with the rules imposed by the military dictatorship (1967‚Äì1974) in education, he resigned. He subsequently held chairs in the Universities of Crete (1979‚Äì81) and Patras (1984-5). Writing and research In addition to his academic career, Dimitris Loukatos is to be remembered most for his prolific writing. He published more than 450 academic works‚Äîmainly articles‚Äîreferences to which are to be found in practically every major publication connected with Greek folklore or Greek anthropology. Among his most celebrated works is Kephallonitiki Latria,\\"Cephalonian Folk Religion.\\" Loukatos: Athens, 1946 which is a scholarly record of the distinct folk religion and unique Orthodox rituals celebrated on the author's native island. His rich accompanying glossary of Orthodox terms includes several entries not found in Ilias Tsitsels's standard dictionary of Cephalonian dialect.Glossarion Kephallinias, in Neoellenika Analekta. Athens, 1876 Kephallonitiki Latria was translated into French by Jean Malbert as \\"Religion Populaire a C√©phalonie\\", and published by the Institut Fran√ßais in Athens in 1950, but unfortunately without the author's glossary. Dimitris Loukatos's fascination for Cephalonian folklore also led to the publication of Kephallonitika Gnomika,Cephalonian Folk Sayings, Minas Myrtidis: Athens, 1952 which is a rich collection of Cephalonian folk sayings and maxims, and also of proverbs that are arranged thematically and accompanied by a detailed index. This was followed by Neoellenika Laographika Kimena,Modern Greek Folklore Passages, Zaharopoulos: Athens, 1957 Synchrona Laographika,Contemporary Folklore, Loukatos: Athens, 1963 Neoelleniki Parimiomythi,Aetiological Tales of Modern Greek Proverbs, Ermis: Athens, 1972 and the monumental work Isagoyi stin Elleniki Laographia.Introduction to Greek Folklore, Educational Foundation of the National Bank: Athens, 1977 This is regarded as one of the classics of Greek folklore in which Dimitris Loukatos presented theories that influenced subsequent folklore research. He is perhaps best known in Greece for his best-selling five-volume work on Greek calendar customs,all published by Philippotis of Athens which has had both scholarly and popular appeal. The first title in the series, \\"Customs of Christmas and the Festive Holidays\\", appeared in 1979. Some of the material in this book, such as the chapter on the Vasilopita (\\"St Basil's Pie\\") had already appeared as articles in various journals. The next title in the series was \\"Easter and Spring Customs\\" published in 1980, followed by \\"Summer Customs\\" in 1981, \\"Autumn Customs\\" in 1982 and, finally, by \\"Supplementary Customs of Winter and Spring\\" in 1985. Each of these volumes has been reprinted several times, and in 1992 the publishers commissioned Greek folklorist Georgios N. Aikaterinidis to compile the indispensable ‚ÄúEvretirio‚Äù (Index) to the five volumes. He was also a versatile author. In addition to his academic folklore works, he also published linguistic and ethnomusicological studies, as well as reviews and even witty cultural prose. For instance, in \\"The Wedding of Mr Memos\\", we see a rare glimpse of his inimitable humour combined with an ethographical description of his own Cephalonians.Journal Ios 58-60 (1962) In and beside his works he was one of the progressive intellectuals defending the replacement in education and official documents of the Katharevousa (archaic pure form of the Greek language, defended by conservative parts of society) by the Dimotiki (ordinary language with realistic grammatical rules). He also wrote an article \\"Tourist Archeofolklore in Greece\\" about how Greece makes the most of its past for tourism.Loukatos, Demetrios. 1978. \\"Tourist Archeofolklore in Greece\\". In Richard Dorson, ed., Folklore in the Modern World, 175-182. The Hague: Mouton. Dimitris Loukatos also contributed detailed entries to major reference works such as the majority of the folklore entries for the twelve-volume Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics.Athanasios Martinos: Athens, 1962-8 Moreover, in his capacity as President of the Greek Folklore Society, a position he had held since 1978, he was also Editor of the Society's scholarly journal Laographia. Awards and recognition He enjoyed international recognition for his contribution to folklore studies. In 1981 he was awarded the Gottfried Von Herder prize by the University and Academy of Vienna. The Greek State conferred on him the honour of the ‚ÄúTaxiarhis tou Phinikos‚Äù (Archangel of the Phoenix), and in 1985 the Ohio State University published in his honour a Festschrift entitled in the journal \\"Proverbium\\". In 1989 he was made an honorary member of the International Society for Folk Narrative Research and he was a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences in Palermo. He was also awarded honorary positions in several other societies in which he played an active part. Due to the influence of Italian culture on the Ionian Islands and to his French education he used French and Italian in his work and made efforts to maintain French as an official language in the international conferences he organized or took part in. Late life and legacy Throughout his long and distinguished career, Professor Loukatos devoted a great deal of time to younger folklorists, encouraging and advising them. Even though he spent most of his life outside Cephalonia, he knew the local culture intimately and he never forgot his own simple roots. He ensured that the Korialenios Library in Argostoli, Cephalonia, was supplied with an extremely rich collection of folklore material. Dimitris Loukatos died at the age of 96. He had long been a widower and is survived by his son, physicist Sotiris Loucatos.

Early life Albert Bostwick, known to his family as \\"Brother\\", was the eldest boy of five children born to Mary Lillian (n√©e Stokes) Bostwick and Albert Carlton Bostwick Sr.. Among his siblings was Dorothy Stokes Bostwick, Lillian Bostwick Phipps, Dunbar Bostwick, and Pete Bostwick. His father, a banker and sportsman, set early automobile speed records. After his death in 1911, his mother remarried in 1914 to Fitch Gilbert Jr., a Harvard and Columbia Law School graduate and farmer. His maternal grandfather, Henry Bolter Stokes, was president of the Manhattan Life Insurance Company, and his paternal grandfather, Jabez Bostwick, was a founder and treasurer of the Standard Oil and a partner of John D. Rockefeller. On the death of his father in 1911, Bostwick inherited a sizeable fortune. His grandmother, Helen Celia (n√©e Ford) Bostwick, upon her death in April 1920, left to him a sum of $1,156,818. Horse racing Bostwick rode horses from a young age, taught by his uncle F. Ambrose Clark, and became a successful amateur steeplechase rider in the United States and in England. He also became involved in the sport of Thoroughbred flat racing and is best known as the owner/breeder of Mate, winner of the 1931 Preakness Stakes. A member of The Jockey Club, in 1932 he obtained a license to train horses. He was a member of the Union Club, the Racquet and Tennis Club, the Turf and Field Club, the Meadow Brook Club and the River Club. Personal life In 1936, Bostwick was married to Eleanor (n√©e Purviance) Sage (1904‚Äì2004). Eleanor was the former wife of Henry Williams Sage (a descendant of Henry W. Sage) and was the daughter of John Nelson Purviance and Helen (n√©e Morgan) Purviance. Before their divorce, they lived on the 15th floor of the Rosario Candela designed 778 Park Avenue (the apartment, a floor below Brooke Astor's apartment, was later owned by Roone Arledge), and had one son together: * Albert Carlton Bostwick III (b. 1939), who in 1960 married socialite Mollie (n√©e Netcher) Bragno (1923‚Äì2002), heiress to a Chicago department store fortune. The wedding, which took place at her home in Chicago, was performed by Judge Julius Hoffman and the best man was New York attorney Roy Cohn. They divorced, and in 1970, she married for the third time to Paul C. Wilmot Jr. The Bostwick's had an estate in Old Westbury on the north shore of Long Island. The estate featured an 1888 Georgian revival manor house with 18 rooms that was updated by architect James O'Connor in the 1930s. After his widow's death in 2004, the estate was sold and subdivided. Bostwick died in 1980 at age 79 at his home in Old Westbury. His funeral was held at the Church of the Advent in Westbury.

The flowers are small, short-lived, flat or tube-shaped and arranged on short, thin flowering stems. Orchids in this genus are found in Africa, tropical and subtropical Asia, New Guinea, Australia and some Western Pacific Islands. Description Orchids in the genus Taeniophyllum are small epiphytic or lithophytic monopodial herbs, with the leaves reduced to tiny overlapping, brownish scales. There is a short stem with spreading grey or greenish roots which are photosynthetic, mainly in the rainy season. The flowers are small, arranged on a short flowering stem and only last for about a day. The sepals and petals are either free and spread widely apart from each other or joined near the base to form a tube. The labellum sometimes has three lobes and usually has a sac-like spur. Taxonomy and naming The genus Taeniophyllum was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume who published the description in Bijdragen tot de Flora van Nederlandsch Indie. The name Taeniophyllum is derived from the Ancient Greek words tainia meaning \\"ribbon\\", \\"fillet\\", \\"band\\", \\"stripe\\" or \\"tapeworm\\" and phyllon meaning \\"leaf\\".

Family  Caroline Alice Roberts, known as Alice, was born in Bhuj, Gujarat, India, in 1848. She was the youngest child and only daughter of Major-General Sir Henry Gee Roberts KCB (1800‚Äì1860), and Julia Maria Raikes (1815‚Äì1887). Her three elder brothers were Albert Henry Roberts (born in 1839 and died young), Frederick Boyd Roberts (born 1841) and Stanley Napier Roberts (born 1844). Their father was serving in India at the time of the Indian Mutiny, and he died when Alice was aged only 12. She was from a distinguished family: on her mother's side her grandfather was the Rev. Robert Napier Raikes, her great-grandfather Robert Raikes (1736‚Äì1811) was the founder of the Sunday school movement, and her uncleAlice's uncle General Robert Napier Raikes had the same name as his father (Alice's grandfather) Rev. Robert Napier Raikes (1783‚Äì1851) was British Indian Army General Robert Napier Raikes (1813‚Äì1909). As a girl she studied with the amateur geologist Rev W. S. Symonds and they and a group of her friends went fossil-hunting on the banks of the river Severn.Powell, p. 1. She wrote the index to a book by him. She studied the piano with Ferdinand KufferathThe soprano Antonia Kufferath (Mrs Edward Speyer) was the daughter of Ferdinand Kufferath, and Elgar dedicated one of his songs Speak, Music! to her in Brussels and harmony with Charles Harford Lloyd.Moore, p. 115. She spoke fluent German, and also Italian, French and Spanish. Before she was married her writing was published under the name C. Alice Roberts. A two-volume novel, Marchcroft Manor, was published in 1882, four years before she met Elgar. The Elgar scholar Diana McVeagh describes it as \\"quite an accomplished, entertaining, indeed touching tale, with a control of pace and situation, and a humour that might well surprise anyone knowing Alice only from her later verses, letters and diary\\". McVeagh also notes that earlier critics have drawn attention to the \\"tincture of radicalism\\" in the book.McVeagh, Diana, \\"Mrs Edward Elgar\\", The Musical Times, February 1984, pp. 76‚Äì78.  Marriage  In 1886 Alice Roberts' brothers had left to join the army and she was living with her elderly widowed mother at Hazeldine House at Redmarley in Worcestershire (now in Gloucestershire). That autumn she took up piano accompaniment lessons from Edward Elgar, who was violin teacher at Worcester High School. When her mother died the next year she went abroad for a while before returning to settle down at a house in Malvern Link called Ripple Lodge, and continued with her accompaniment lessons. She became engaged to her young teacher, much to the disapproval of her strongly Anglican family, who not only considered her fianc√© a poor tradesman of a lower social class, but noted that he was eight years her junior and a devout Roman Catholic. Alice Roberts and Edward Elgar were married on 8 May 1889 in a shortened Catholic ceremony at Brompton Oratory.Kennedy, p. 24. They gave each other engagement presents: he presented her with a short piece for violin and piano called Salut d'Amour, and she gave him one of her poems The Wind at Dawn. Of Alice's family only her cousin William Raikes and his wife Veronica attended, while on her husband's side there were only his parents and his musical friend Dr. Charles Buck. The wedding breakfast was at the nearby house of a friend of Alice's, Mrs. Marshall ‚Äì Elgar later dedicated A Song of Autumn to her daughter \\"Miss Marshall\\".Young, Alice Elgar, p. 100. The Elgars spent a three- week honeymoon at Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, then returned to London to be closer to the centre of British musical life. But they had no settled home for over a year: they went first to 3 Marloes Road, Kensington; then on 29 July they went back to her spacious house 'Saetermo' in Malvern when the lease ran out; then in October to the Raikes cousins' home (lent to them for the winter 1890‚Äì91) 'Oaklands', Fountain Road, Upper Norwood with the advantage of being near the Crystal Palace concerts which Edward attended whenever he could. They then moved to a terraced house at 51 Avonmore Road, KensingtonKennedy, p. 26. where their only child, Carice'Carice' was compounded from her mother's names 'Caroline' and 'Alice' Irene was born on 14 August 1890. However the lack of work for Edward forced them to leave, and they returned to Malvern Link, renting a house 'Forli' in Alexandra Road, where it was hoped he could earn a living teaching and conducting local musical ensembles.Kennedy, p. 31.  Influence  Alice's faith in her husband and her courage in marrying 'beneath her class' were strongly supportive to his career. She dealt with his mood swings and was a generous musical critic. She was also his business manager, social secretary, and not least set out and ruled score paper for his orchestral works. She did her best to gain him the attention of influential society, though with limited success. The honours accepted reluctantly by her husband mattered more to her and her social class. She also gave up some of her personal aspirations to further his career. In her diary she later admitted, \\"The care of a genius is enough of a life work for any woman.\\"Kennedy, p. 115. When her husband received his knighthood in 1904, she became Lady Elgar. At the beginning of World War I, for a short while, Lady Elgar taught French to a group of private soldiers at Chelsea Barracks.Young, p. 175. By January 1920, friends had noticed that she had lost her normal vitality and had not been out of the house since November.Reed, pp. 66‚Äì7. She attended a performance of Elgar's Second Symphony on 16 March, and the next day went to a Harley Street doctor, but stayed at home when Elgar travelled to a concert in Leeds. The last concert she attended was a performance of some of Elgar's chamber music in London. The Elgars' grave at St. Wulstan's Church, Little Malvern She died of lung cancer, aged 71, on 7 April, in their home Severn House at 42 Netherhall Gardens in Hampstead.Moore, pp. 750‚Äì1. Her funeral was held at St Wulstan's Roman Catholic Church in Little Malvern three days later. Edward was supported by their daughter Carice. Among the mourners was Alice's brother Napier Roberts. There were Elgar's friends Frank Schuster, Billy Reed and Dr. Charles Buck. Sir Charles Stanford arrived but could only speak to Reed before walking away in tears.Reed, p. 67. In the gallery of the church the slow movement from Elgar's String Quartet was played by Reed, Albert Sammons, Lionel Tertis and Felix Salmond.Moore, p. 754.  Legacy  Alice's letters and the diary she kept during the years of her marriage between 1889 and 1920 are a full and valuable record of the lives of her and her family.  Her daughter  At the beginning of World War I, Carice Elgar trained in First Aid, then from 1915 did translation work for the Government Censorship Department. The month before Alice died, Carice returned home from a holiday in M√ºrren, having met there a Surrey farmer older than she was named Samuel Blake. Her mother sensed a secret, but Carice did not tell her.Moore, p.751. A year later, with her father's consent, they became engaged.Moore, p. 758. They were married in January 1922 and she took the name Carice Elgar Blake.Kennedy, p. 247. They had no children. After her mother died Carice devoted herself to supporting her father. After the death of her father in 1934 she played a part in the formation of the Elgar Birthplace Trust. Samuel Blake died in 1939, and Carice died in Bristol on 16 July 1970. Her funeral was at St. Wulstan's Church in Little Malvern, where her parents were buried, and there was a memorial service for her at Farm Street Church in Mount Street, London W1 on 30 July.The Times obituary and deaths, 17 July 1970  Works = Lyrics  Poems by Alice set to music by Elgar: * \\"The Wind at Dawn\\", song (1888), poem written in 1880Moore, p. 125. * \\"Afar, amidst the sunny Isles\\", alternate poem by Alice to fit the music of \\"My Love Dwelt in a Northern Land\\", when Andrew Lang refused permission for his poem to be used: but Lang later changed his mind and Alice's words were not usedYoung, Alice Elgar, p. 102. * \\"Im Norden, wo mein Lieb gewohnt\\", German words to \\"My Love Dwelt in a Northern Land\\"Porte, p. 206. * \\"O Happy Eyes\\", part-song SATB, Op.18 No.1 (1890) * \\"A spear, a sword\\", unpublished song (1892)Kennedy, p. 281. * \\"Mill-wheel Songs\\", two unpublished songs (1892)Moore, p. 168. ** 1. \\"Winter\\"; 2. \\"May (a rhapsody)\\" * \\"The Snow\\", part-song SSA acc. 2 violins and piano, Op. 26 No.1 (1894).

Description Plants of the genus are small sympodial orchids closely related to Chondrorhyncha, growing tall. Orchids have a long or short rhizome and lack pseudobulbs. Linear to lanceolate leaves form a fan shape, articulated to a sheath at their base. Single flowered inflorescences rise from the base or between leaves, often multiple at a time. Flowers are thin and translucent, with similar petals and sepals. The lip is broad and articulated to the column foot. The column is stout and keeled on the underside. Flowers have four pollinia. Distribution and habitat Most species grow in the Andes mountains of Colombia and Ecuador, in shady, humid conditions. Most are epiphytic though some grow terrestrially in humus or moss. Ecology Most flowers of the genus are pollinated by euglossine bees attracted by the flowers' fragrance. The hump of the lip forces bees to enter the flower from the side and pollinia are attached to the base of the bee's antennae.

It is related to orchids in the genus Caladenia but has an unusual labellum and does not have hairy leaves. Its pollination mechanism is also unusual.  Description  Leporella fimbriata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and an oval-shaped tuber lacking a protective sheath. The tuber produces two \\"droppers\\" which become the daughter tubers in the following year. Unlike those in some other orchids, the droppers are produced well away from the parent tuber at the end of long, root-like stolons. There are one or two egg-shaped to lance-shaped, glabrous leaves at the base of the stem. The leaves are often small when the orchid flowers, but increase in size to long and wide, turning bluish-green with reddish veins as they mature. There are up to three resupinate flowers on the end of a wiry stem high. The flowers are long and wide. The dorsal sepal is dished, long and curves over the labellum. The two lateral sepals are about the same length but very narrow and turned back against the ovary. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum. The other two petals are erect, long, narrow, linear in shape but with a club-like end which has many glandular hairs. The labellum is about long and wide, hairy and greenish with reddish-brown spots and a comb-like fringe. There are no obvious calli on the labellum. The sexual parts of the flower are fused to the column, which has wing-like structures on its sides. Flowering occurs from March to June but the remains of the flower are often recognisable as late as September. The fruit is a non-fleshy, glabrous, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds.Labelled image Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley who gave it the name Leptoceras fimbriata and published the description in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. In 1971, Alex George described the genus Leporella and included this species. The genus name \\"Leporella\\" is derived from the Latin word lepus meaning \\"hare\\" with the diminutive suffix meaning -ella, hence \\"leporella\\" meaning \\"little hare\\". The specific epithet \\"fimbriata\\" is a Latin word meaning \\"fringed\\". Distribution and habitat Leporella fimbriata usually grows in woodland or shrubland but is also found in heath and near areas that are swampy in winter. It is found in the western half of Victoria, and across southern South Australia to southern Western Australia. In Western Australia it occurs between Shark Bay in the north and Israelite Bay on the south coast. In South Australia, in the south-east, especially the Yorke Peninsula and Eyre Peninsula, and in the south-west of Victoria, including the Anglesea area and outer Melbourne suburbs. Ecology This orchid is a myrmecophyte and is pollinated by a male bull-ant (Myrmecia urens, Family Formicidae) when the ant attempts to copulate with the labellum.

Morton Company of High Point Road in Greensboro, North Carolina. It somewhat resembled the concurrent Eshelman automobile, but differed in its most remarkable engineering features which included what the manufacturer termed its \\"Floating Power Unit\\", a self- contained rear-mounted engine/clutch/drivetrain combination in concert with the rear wheels and independent of the body. The FPU was mounted on pivots at front and back. Also, a floorboard-mounted one-stick control operated forward/rear motions and even braking action. The throttle control was mounted on the dashboard; a rope-recoil starter was used. Two models were offered; the Standard and the Deluxe, the latter model also featuring a wraparound Plexiglas windshield in then-contemporary fashion, an electric horn, head and tail lamps and a lightning-bolt trim design on the flanks. Bumpers and a trailer hitch were standard on all models. The squarish-looking Hackney bodies were of sheet steel; a running change added small fins atop the rear fenders on later models. Standard factory colors were red with white trim and wheels. Engines were supplied by several manufacturers but surviving Hackney cars usually have a 2 HP Clinton four-cycle powerplant, which allowed speeds to six MPH. Advertising claims The Hackney was marketed, according to factory literature, as \\"Easy To Operate! Lots of fun! Any child can learn in a matter of minutes. Hackney Autos for Children - 3 to 103!\\" \\"For inexpensive pleasure; \\"For genuine fun - it can't be beat for young and old alike; \\"For training - assure the youngsters a safe future on the highways by early training in your yard; \\"A safe and sturdy little car - designed for use in the smallest of yards with limited ground, sidewalk and driveway areas, or for the wide-open spaces; \\"Lowest priced car in its field. Simple enough for tots, thrilling enough for teenagers. Dads, too, can share in the fun, and teach children how to steer, make quick stops and park. It's a lot of fun, and educational, too, to teach them hand signals. \\"Older children and adults will naturally set their own speed with the throttle. The car has enough zip and pep to 'spin a wheel' and thoroughly satisfy teenagers. Ample seat and leg room to accommodate a youth until he is old enough to get a driver's license for a big car.

There are two species, one in Western Australia and the other in four eastern Australian states, distinguished by their single long, narrow, leathery leaf and dull coloured flowers which have prominent short calli on their labellum. Both form loose colonies which reproduce asexually from their tubers, and sexually using their flowers. Description Orchids in the genus Lyperanthus are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs usually with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and an oval-shaped, tuber lacking a protective sheath. Each year, new tubers develop on the ends of long, root-like stolons. There is a single, erect, leathery, stiff, linear to lance-shaped leaf, long, wide with tiny pimple-like glands on the lower surface. The distinctive leaf protruding though surrounding vegetation is often the first part of the orchid apparent to the observer. The inflorescence is a raceme with from one to eight resupinate flowers on an erect stem up to high. Each flower has a sheathing bract around its short stalk and is brownish, reddish and green. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped, about long and forms a hood over and close to the column. The two lateral sepals are similar to the two petals, stiff and leathery, about long, narrow and with their edges often rolled inwards. The petals usually spread widely while the sepals hang downwards. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum. The labellum is separated from the sepals and other petals, its base attached to the base of the column. It is long, gently curved in a semi-circle, with three lobes, the central one egg-shaped to oval with its base surrounding the column. Most of the labellum is crowded with rows of rounded or erect calli. The sexual parts of the flower are fused to the column which is about long and has narrow wings along its length. Flowering occurs from August to November, depending somewhat on species and the fruit which follows is a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing up to 500 seeds.Labelled image Taxonomy and naming The genus Lyperanthus was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. The botanical name Lyperanthus is derived from the Ancient Greek words lypros meaning \\"poor\\" or \\"wretched\\" and anthos meaning \\"flower\\", referring to the dull-coloured flowers of this species. Ecology The pollination mechanism of the two species of Lyperanthus is not known but L. suaveolens is strongly fragrant in warm weather and both species have nectar, indicating that they may be pollinated by bees. Unlike many Western Australian orchid species, these two do not require fire to induce flowering. Species There are two species in the genus: *Lyperanthus serratus Lindl. ‚Äì \\"rattle beaks\\" (Western Australia) *Lyperanthus suaveolens R.Br. ‚Äì \\"brown beaks\\" (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Tasmania).

Retrieved 7 February 2010.Children's Books and Their Creators. p. 668. is an English children's author and illustrator who gained worldwide fame in the mid-1980s with his Where's Wally? creation (known as Where's Waldo? in North America). Early life Born in Hampstead, London, Handford was a solitary child, born to divorced parents. He began drawing crowds when he was 4 or 5 years old, and later as a child, making stick figures on paper. After school, when most other children he knew would go out and play games, he would draw pictures instead. His inspiration to draw such figures came from classic films and the toy soldiers he played with during that era. As an adult, Handford worked for three years in an insurance office (Crusader Insurance Company) to pay for his studies at UCA (University for the Creative Arts) formerly KIAD (Kent Institute of Art and Design) in Maidstone, Kenthttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/sometimes-it-pays-to-stick-your-head-in- the-sand_b_57f829a6e4b0d786aa52b1e1?ncid=engmodushpmg00000005. After graduating, Martin worked as a freelance illustrator specialising in drawing crowd scenes for numerous clients. Career Martin Handford created the album cover for The Vapors' 1981 album Magnets. The cover features an assassination scene which forms the shape of an eye. In 1986, Handford was asked by his art director at Walker Books to draw a character with peculiar features so that his pictures of crowds had a focal point. After much thinking, he came up with the idea of \\"Wally\\", a world traveller and time travel aficionado who always dresses in red and white.\\"Up Against the Waldo\\", by Cyndi Stivers, 14 December 1990, Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved 8 February 2010. Wally is joined on most of his travels by his friend, Wenda, who wears clothes with the same colours as Wally's, and by an evil character named Odlaw (Waldo spelled backwards) who dresses in yellow and black. Handford became a minor celebrity with the success of Where's Wally?. The Where's Wally? trademark sold in 28 different countries. Beginning in 1987, Handford produced a total of seven \\"classic\\" Where's Wally? books, but his character was branched out into other products, such as notebooks, pillows, posters, video games and many others. There was even a syndicated comic strip as well as an animated TV series. Handford has gained the reputation of being a methodical and diligent worker: sometimes it would take him up to eight weeks to draw one two-page sketch \\"Wally\\" and the characters surrounding him. The drawings are drawn to the same scale as in the books and each 2-page spread usually contains about 300 to 500 figures, with Wally often being the last character drawn into the crowd. The Where's Wally? books were published in the UK by Walker Books and in the US under the title Where's Waldo? first by Little, Brown and Company before being taken on by Candlewick Press (Walker Books' American subsidiary publishing company). The first four titles were originally printed in Italy, but later reprinted in China. A film based on the Where's Wally? series of books was planned for filming in 2005 by Nickelodeon Movies but was cancelled due to a management change at Paramount Pictures. In 2007, Handford sold the rights to Where's Wally? to the Entertainment Rights Group, the world's biggest independent owner of children's brands.\\"Where's Wally founder tracks down a fortune\\", Fiona Walsh, The Guardian, 22 January 2007. Retrieved 7 February 2010. He is said to have made ¬£2.5m in this sale. The style of art executed by Handford is probably the most famous example of \\"Wimmelbilderbuch\\" drawings, originally popularised by Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Hans J√ºrgen Press.  Personal life  According to his publishers Handford is a shy, creative genius who is very dedicated to his work and has no interest in publicity. He listens to the Bee Gees, the Clash or old Sergeant Bilko tapes while he works.\\"Where's the brains behind Wally?\\", Paul Bignell, The Independent, 13 November 2011. Retrieved 24 June 2017.

It was in operation between November 16, 1930, to August 10, 1958. Origins The tram was built thanks to money from Germany, for war reparations from World War I. The sum of 21,274,928 dinars paid for the costs of installing rail, trams and the tram station. Along with this, two power plants were built and the electricity grid was expanded. The tram went from the train station to Ni≈°ka Banja. During operations the system transported a total of approximately 7,658,000 passengers. Demise In 1956 the traffic director of the municipality Ni≈° said that the trams will be gotten rid of. In 1958, fifteen trams were removed out of service and sold. Buses replaced trams in a ceremony on August 10. Today, two bus lines (Ledena Stena - ƒÜele kula and ≈Ωelezniƒçka stanica - Ni≈°ka Banja) go where the tram used to go. Future plans In late 2009, the city of Ni≈° developed plans bring back a tram line. The streets of General Milojko Le≈°janin and part of Vo≈ædova street could become pedestrian only streets. If this is done, then there would be room for trams, even in the center of the city. The ecological benefits would be significant, as the buses along this route produce some 21 tons of CO2.

Biography Born in a family of artists, his father was an engraver and his brother Peter Janssen was a painter. He studied at the K√∂niglich Preu√üischen Kunstakademie in D√ºsseldorf from 1872 to 1880. In 1878 he garnered a scholarship to study in Rome; he remained in Italy from 1881 to 1884. On his return his first notable commission was for a memorial portrait bust of the industrialist Poensgen (1883) for his monument in the Nordfriedhof. In 1897, together with , whom he had known from their days at the Akademie, he was commissioned to produce a sculptured group for the visit to the city by Kaiser Wilhelm, on the theme of Father Rhine and his Daughters. The result so pleased D√ºsseldorfers that Janssen and T√ºshaus were requested to cast a more durable version in bronze, for a city fountain. The previous year (1896), he cast an equestrian statue of the Kaiser, which was destroyed in the Second World War. Since 1893 he had been teaching as a professor, taking the chair of the late , who had been his teacher. Among his outstanding pupils were Bernhard Hoetger and Wilhelm Lehmbruck. Following the First World War he was commissioned by the Henkel company to sculpt a war memorial to fallen Henkel workers, to be erected at the Henkel works in D√ºsseldorf-Holthausen. His last well-known work was also for the Henkel family, a mourning figure in Art Deco style for the family mausoleum (1925).

In the 1998 IBGE PME (Monthly Employment Survey), 0.04% of respondents identified, in an inquiry on race/colour, as \\"sarar√°\\".Jos√© Luiz Petrucelli. A Cor Denominada. Tabela 1, p. 21. While the emphasis on fair skin in Brazil is not as visible as in other post-colonial societies, with many preferring and advocating the moreno or olive skin beauty type, European facial features and hair texture are a beauty standard in Brazil, and many people of diverse backgrounds use flat irons and chemical hair treatments to pass their hair as straight or wavy. In a society that divides between \\"white\\" and \\"black\\", sarar√°s will be placed together with the Brown-skinned pardos as non-whites, despite their fair complexion and hair. Background It is known that the genes responsible for blondism i.e. blonde hair (that probably firstly appeared around the Baltic Sea) and rutilism i.e. red hair (that probably firstly appeared in Africa and then spread to other continents, but is only present in significant numbers in Western Eurasian populations and their descendants) are recessive, so that a person with full Amerindian or sub-Saharan African ancestry, or a mixing between the two, is by far very unlikely to have red-haired or blond-haired offspring, no matter how fair the complexion of her or his Caucasian or multiracial sexual partner or spouse. The genes responsible for brown hair are also extremely rare among Indigenous peoples of the Americas and Black Africans, but not as uncommon. The most common hair colour in Brazil is brown. Natural blond and red hair are especially found in the South where 78% of the population has European phenotype, home to large German-Austrian (Santa Catarina), Dutch, Norwegian, Northern Italian, and Slavic (Paran√°) populations, and the Southeast region that has the largest absolute numbers of Whites. About 21% of Brazilians descend from the country's indigenous peoples and Portuguese settlers, as well as Dutch, French and Spanish colonial settlers, including Crypto-Jews or Anusim and Gypsies or Roma people, while 7% to 25% also have African slave ancestors.Enciclop√©dia Barsa vol. 4, p. 230.

PhD Thesis, Universidade de Bras√≠lia (2008). European colonization and immigration waves Most Portuguese colonists as well as most Portuguese immigrants to Brazil came from Northern Portugal, which are its blondest regions. Colonial Brazil was also home to some Dutch invaders who were successful at staying in Brazil even after their territorial loss. The second most common non-Portuguese European group in Colonial Brazil were the French, with its cultural influence, represented by things such as the French artistic mission, that can be seen until this day, with the greater number of loanwords into Brazilian Portuguese coming from the French language. The earliest Central European mass immigration started by the 1830s, and increased much in part due to the slavery crisis. Together with the Germans and the Swiss, came the early Italians. While the total Italian immigration to Brazil was evenly distributed between South, Center and North, most early Italian colonists came from the Northern provinces who had land borders with other European countries. Other immigration waves, from all regions of Europe, as well the Levantine Arabs and East Asians, came thereafter. A colonial Spanish genetic contribution is present in the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, with some estimates placing it almost as high as the Portuguese one, and up to 15 million people nowadays are descendants of post-independence Spanish immigration waves. As with those descended from the Portuguese, most Brazilians of Spanish heritage trace it to the blondest region of Spain, Galicia. Degree of European descent of non-white Brazilians Genetic research on ancestry of Brazilians of different races has extensively shown that, regardless of skin colour, Brazilians generally have European, African and Amerindian ancestors. According to a genetic study about Brazilians, on the paternal side, 98% of the White Brazilian Y chromosome comes from a European male ancestor, only 2% from an African ancestor, and there is a complete absence of Amerindian contributions. On the maternal side, 39% have a European Mitochondrial DNA, 33% Amerindian and 28% African MtDNA.The Ancestry of Brazilian mtDNA Lineages This analysis only shows a small fraction of a person's ancestry (the Y Chromosome comes from a single male ancestor and the mtDNA from a single female ancestor, while the contributions of the many other ancestors is not specified),Os Genes de Cabral but it shows that miscegenation in Brazil was directional, between Portuguese males and African and Amerindian females. Analyzing Black Brazilians' Y chromosome, which comes from male ancestors through the paternal line, it was concluded that half (50%) of the Black Brazilian population has at least one male ancestor who came from Europe, 48% has at least one male ancestor who came from Africa and 1.6% has at least one male ancestor who was Amerindian. Analyzing their mitochondrial DNA, that comes from female ancestors though maternal line, 85% of them have at least a female ancestor who came from Africa, 12.5% have at least a female ancestor who was Native Brazilian and only 2.5% have at least a female ancestor who came from Europe.Afrobras - DNA do negroGenetic signatures of parental contribution in black and white populations in Brazil As for the complete genetic ancestry of Brazilians, research has shown that it is predominantly European, even among non-white Brazilians. According to another study (autosomal DNA) conducted on a school in the poor periphery of Rio de Janeiro the pardos there were found to be on average over 80% European, and the \\"whites\\" (who thought of themselves as \\"very mixed\\") were found out to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. \\"The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry\\", say the researchers. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The pardos for example thought of themselves as 1/3 European, 1/3 African and 1/3 Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry was determined to be at over 80% European. Another autosomal DNA study, from 2010, also focused on the autosomal contribution (which is about the sum of the ancestors of each individual, the overall picture), found out that almost 80% of the Brazilian genes are of European origin in all regions except in the South where it stands for 90% of them (regardless of census' racial classification).DNA de brasileiro √© 80% europeu, indica estudo. \\"Ancestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations.\\" The samples came from free of charge paternity test takers, thus as the researchers made it explicit: \\"the paternity tests were free of charge, the population samples involved people of variable socioeconomic strata, although likely to be leaning slightly towards the ‚Äò‚Äòpardo‚Äô‚Äô group\\". According to another different study (also autosomal DNA from 2009), European ancestry predominates in the Brazilian population. The Brazilians as a whole, from all regions, and of all complexions, would lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the mestizos from Mexico, from the genetical point of view. This shows that the genotypes of individuals in a miscigenated population does not necessarily match their phenotype. Final demographic picture In the 19th and 20th century Brazilian culture has promoted racial integration and miscegenation.Zaluar, Alba. Integra√ß√£o perversa: pobreza e tr√°fico de drogas. FGV Editora, 2004. p.39 Intermixing is common between Brazilians who come from more recent immigrant waves and those descendant of older, or different, immigrant communities. Interracial marriages comprised 22.6% of all marriages in 2000.Esc√≥ssia, F. \\"Casamento reflete discrimina√ß√£o racial.\\" Folha de S.Paulo. 23 October 2000. There has never been a widespread taboo against racial or ethnic mixing in any Brazilian ethnic community, with the notable exceptions of German and latter Japanese immigrants, who nevertheless fully integrated in the second halves of the 19th and 20th centuries respectively. In Brazilian culture, ethnic preservation taboos are regarded as plain fear of outsiders ‚Äì in part inherited from nationalism defining a single Brazilian cultural identity, with no space for any other. Since the offspring of a couple with some genetic differences will have a random combination of their genotypes, their appearance, that depends on a smaller number of elements from this gene pool, will also be of a random combination. As a result of the continuing process of intermixing, any sort of phenotype between those stereotypically European, African or Amerindian will show up, and even if many of the genes related to European-like features are recessive, they are likely to evenly manifest in the Brazilian population, just being more common in the regions where European immigration was greater.

Except for these endpoints of the line, colors on the line are non-spectral (no monochromatic light source can generate them). Rather, every color on the line is a unique mixture in a ratio of fully saturated red and fully saturated violet, the two spectral color endpoints of visibility on the spectrum of pure hues. Colors on the line and spectral colors are the only ones that are fully saturated in the sense that, for any point on the line, no other possible color being a mixture of red and violet is more saturated than it. Unlike spectral colors, which may be implemented, for example, by the nearly monochromatic light of a laser, with precision much finer than human chromaticity resolution, colors on the line are more difficult to depict. The sensitivity of each type of human cone cell to both spectral red and spectral violet, being at the opposite endpoints of the line and at the extremes of the visible spectrum, is very low. (See luminosity function) Therefore, common purple colors are not highly bright. The line of purples, a theoretical boundary of chromaticity, is distinct from \\"purples\\", a more general denomination of colors, which also refers to less than fully saturated colors (see shades of purple and shades of pink for examples) that form the interior of a triangle between white and the line of purples in the CIE chromaticity diagram.  In color spaces  In 3-dimensional color spaces the line, if present, becomes a 2-dimensional shape. For example, in the CIE XYZ it is a planar sector bounded by black‚Äìred and black‚Äìviolet rays. In systems premised on pigment colors, such as the Munsell and Pantone systems, boundary purples might be absent because the maximally possible lightness of a pigment vanishes when its chromaticity approaches the Line, such that purple pigments near the line are indistinguishable from black. The RGB color model, although theoretically capable of approximating the colors of the line because it is an additive system, usually practically fails because of the limitations of the light source used. The boundary of sRGB (pictured) runs approximately parallel to the line, connecting the primaries red and (color wheel) blue, and thus purples near the line are absent from the gamut of sRGB. Magenta ink, which is one of CMYK's primaries, is also very distant from the line for the reason explained above.

The technique was designed in 1998 at the University College London. In patients having lumpectomy for breast cancer, the TARGIT-A(lone) randomized controlled trial (recruitment from 2000‚Äì2012) tested whether TARGIT within a risk-adapted approach is non-inferior to conventional course of external beam postoperative radiotherapy given over several weeks. TARGIT is a method where the radiation is applied during an operation and targeted to the peri-tumoural tissues. TARGIT technique was designed at University College London by Jayant S Vaidya (who coined the TARGIT acronym) and Michael Baum along with Jeffrey S Tobias in 1998. The term was first used when the technique was described, and the protocol for a randomised trial was published by The Lancet.  Medical uses = Breast cancer  The largest experience with IORT using the TARGIT technique and the best evidence for its potentials exists in breast cancer where a substantial number of patients have already been treated. =Adoption= At the St Gallen Breast Cancer Conference (16‚Äì19 March 2011) the consensus amongst over 52 breast cancer expert panelists was that TARGIT alone could be used as the only radiation treatment in selected cases after breast conserving surgery (49% yes, 36% no), or as a tumour bed boost instead of external beam radiotherapy boost (62% yes, 23% no). On 25 July 2014 the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) gave provisional recommendation for the use of TARGIT IORT with Intrabeam in the UK National Health Service. In September 2014, NICE requested further information from the clinical trial investigators, citing several comments and concerns. Concerns cited included the immaturity of the data with a median follow up of the entire population being only 2 years and 5 months as well as the noninferiority criterion used in the study.NICE concerns and requested actions for TARGIT Trialists This extra information was supplied by the authors, and has since been published as part of the comprehensive paper on TARGIT-A trial. In 2017, NICE described it as an option for early breast cancer. The 2015 update of guidelines of the Association of Gynecological Oncology (AGO) (an autonomous community of the German Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics (DGGG) and the German Cancer Society) includes TARGIT IORT during lumpectomy as a recommended option for women with a T1, Grade 1 or 2, ER positive breast cancer. On 21 May 2015, the Australian Government Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) announced that \\"After considering the available evidence in relation to safety, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, MSAC supported public funding of a new Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item for treatment of pathologically documented invasive ductal breast cancer in eligible patients with TARGIT-IORT when used concurrently with breast- conserving surgery\\". The Australian Government also approved budget item for the treatment of early stage breast cancer using targeted intraoperative radiotherapy and patients can avail of this treatment from 1 September 2015 On 26 May 2015, in response to a query by the British Medical Journal, NICE clarified that while their appraisal is going on, TARGIT IORT with Intrabeam can continue to be offered to patients who need it There are over 250 centres worldwide using TARGIT IORT for treating breast cancer in USA (about 60 centres), Europe (60 centres in Germany), Australia, Middle East, Far East, South America. Over than 12,000 patients have been treated. A recent study with several centres from the USA found excellent results with the use of TARGIT IORT. Evaluation of the long-term outcomes in patients who were treated with TARGIT-IORT for breast cancer confirmed that it is as effective as whole breast external beam radiotherapy in controlling cancer, and also reduces deaths from other causes as shown in a large international randomised clinical trial published in the British Medical Journal.  Rationale  When breast cancer is surgically excised, it can come back (local recurrence) in the remaining breast or on the chest wall in a small proportion of women. Adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary if breast cancer is treated by removing only the cancerous lump with a rim of surrounding normal tissue, as it reduces the chance of local recurrence significantly. When cancer does come back, it most commonly occurs in the tissues surrounding the original cancer (the tumour bed), even though there are multicentric cancers in remote areas of the breast. This suggests that it is most important to treat the tumour bed. The rationale for TARGIT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the tumour bed. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumor have been time tested and proven to be effective. EBRT is usually given as a course of whole breast radiotherapy and an additional tumour bed boost. However, it has a few drawbacks; for example, the tumour bed where the boost dose should be applied can be missed (\\"geographical miss\\") due to the difficulties in localization of the complex wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay (\\"temporal miss\\") between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells. Furthermore, TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells, suggesting for the first time, a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) on tumour microenvironment.  Technique  TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy (TARGIT) IORT for breast cancer The machine used for TARGIT is Intrabeam (Carl Zeiss, Germany). It is a miniature and mobile X-ray source which emits low energy X-ray radiation (max. 50 kV) in isotropic distribution. Due to the higher ionization density caused by soft X-ray radiation in the tissue, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of low-energy X-rays on tumour cells is higher when compared to high- energy X-rays or gamma rays which are delivered by linear accelerators. The radiation which is produced by mobile radiation systems has a limited range. For this reason, conventional walls are regarded sufficient to stop the radiation scatter produced in the operating room and no extra measures for radiation protection are necessary. This makes IORT for breast cancer by the TARGIT technique available in most operating rooms. The surgical technique is relatively simple but needs to be meticulously followed.  Professional Society for Intraoperative Radiation Therapy  In 1998, the International Society of IORT (ISIORT) was formed to foster the scientific and clinical development of IORT. The ISIORT has more than 1000 members worldwide and meets every two years.

Valid for five years, the card eliminates the need for its holder to possess a visa when visiting other APEC participating economies as long as pre-clearance has been obtained during the application process. Participating APEC economies and application process Most APEC economies are full participating economies in the APEC Business Travel Card:       * Transitional members: * * Russia began full participation on 1 June 2013. Citizens of these economies can apply for a card from their national government, with the general criteria being business persons who may need to travel frequently on short term visits within the APEC region to fulfill business commitments. Different economies may have very different criteria for vetting applications from their own citizens; for example, Hong Kong accepts applications from all permanent resident bona fide business people, but Australia restricts participation to representatives of businesses engaged in international trade or investment between APEC economies, have received an Export Market Development Grant from Austrade in the past five years, are listed on the current Forbes Global 2000 business list, or meet other similar criteria. After submitting an application, an applicant's name is circulated amongst the other participating economies which give entry pre-clearance when all conditions are met. The names of the economies for which entry pre-clearance has been given are printed on the card's reverse. It may take as long as three to four months for all member economies to respond to the pre-clearance queries from the applicant's government, as a result of which applicants may choose to have their card issued without waiting for some governments' dilatory responses and thus not enjoy travel privileges in those economies. For applications made after September 2015, the card is valid for five years (previously 3 years), after which a fresh application must be made. If the holder's passport is renewed during the 5 year validity period, the card must be reissued to reflect the new passport number. As of February 2014, there were roughly five hundred thousand ABTCs in active use. Canada and the United States are transitional members. This permits them to issue ABTCs to their own citizens and nationals so that they can take advantage of expedited visa appointment and immigration clearance procedures in other economies, but without their citizens and nationals enjoying additional visa-free travel, or having to grant visa-free travel status to holders of APEC cards issued by other participating economies. The U.S. began accepting applications for ABTCs in June 2014, while Canada announced in October 2013 that it would begin a limited-participation trial programme. It is also possible for a citizen of a third party country (including the United States and Canada) who is also permanent resident of Hong Kong to apply for an APEC card via the Hong Kong Immigration Department. This exception does not apply to any other member economies. Physical appearance The card is issued in creditcard form, is machine-readable and has the following fields: *Name *Sex *Economy [name of the member economy] *Date of Birth *Expiry Date *Signature *Passport number Apart from the name of the member economy, no national signs are present on the card. On the back of the card, the member economies for which clearance has been approved are shown. The Machine-readable strip starts with \\"CP\\", followed by the abbreviation of the issuing economy. The abbreviations are in conformation with the 3-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes. Although Taiwan is a member economy under the name Chinese Taipei, the abbreviation TWN is used here. Use The card must be used in conjunction with a passport and has the following advantages: * No need to apply for a visa or entry permit, as the card is treated as such (except by transitional members)# * Multiple short term entry for a maximum stay of between 59 days to 90 days * Expedited border crossing in all member economies, including transitional members * Expedited scheduling of visa interview (U.S.) * Card is valid for five years * Costs vary by participating country * Processing time: 2‚Äì3 months, and up to one year in some cases. APEC offers a fast-track option for interim card issuance covering up to five \\"priority economies\\" of an applicant's preference. * The Visa free arrangement does not apply to Chinese citizen of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for entry into the Mainland China. These citizens should continue to use the Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macau Residents for such entry. It also does not apply to ABTC holders of Hong Kong for entry into Chinese Taipei. Country specific information=Australia As Australia is a full participating member of the scheme, Australian citizens who are frequent bona fide business travellers can apply for a card through the Department of Home Affairs (Australia) online.https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/entering-and- leaving-australia/business-travel-card/australian-citizens Foreign holders of the card can visit Australia visa-free for 90 days, and special fast-track lanes are available for them at Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney airports. Eligibility requirements for Australian citizens to get an ABTC include: * You travel frequently to an APEC economy for business purposes * You have not been convicted of a criminal offence * Your business entity is engaged in international trade or investment between APEC economies. This is shown if the business: ** has received an Export Market Development Grant from Austrade in the past five years ** has been a finalist in the Australian Export Awards in the past five years ** is listed on the current Forbes Global 2000 business list ** is trading goods, services or conducting investment activities between APEC economies ** is a start-up operation, there is clear evidence of viability, sound business planning, market research and product/s or services to be traded Canada Although Canada is not a full participant of the scheme, card holders are eligible to use special service lanes at major international airports upon arrival in Canada, but are still subject to the regular entry/visa requirements. At the APEC Indonesia 2013 summit, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that his country would begin a pilot scheme allowing Canadian citizen NEXUS members to apply for ABTCs. In June 2014, the Canada Border Services Agency published a final rule regarding the issuance of ABTCs to Canadian Citizens. Applicants for ABTCs must already be enrolled in the NEXUS program. Applicants can apply through the GOES portal, the same US CBP operated website used for its other trusted traveler schemes. Since Canada is only a transitional member of the ABTC scheme and does not grant any visa waiver to ABTC holders from other economies, Canadian citizens reciprocally do not enjoy any additional visa- free travel through the ABTC scheme. However, they qualify for expedited visa appointment procedures for those economies which require visas for Canadian citizens, and use of specially marked ABTC lanes at airports. Hong Kong All Hong Kong permanent residents who are bona fide frequent business travellers are eligible to apply for the card through the Immigration Department upon submission of form ID900, regardless of whether they are Chinese citizens, as long as they have never committed a criminal offence and have never been denied entry into another APEC participating economy. The application fee is HKD540. As Hong Kong is a full participant of the scheme, non-Hong Kong residents who hold an APEC Business Travel Card can enter Hong Kong visa-free for 60 days and are entitled to use special fast-track or resident counters. Japan Japan is a full member since 2003 and MOFA issues these cards to businessmen who are Japanese citizens. Popularly it is called as ABTC card. Visa free travel is allowed for either 60 or 90 days depending on the travel destination except for Philippines where the stay is limited to 59 days. Card holders can avail special fast-track lanes to expedite the immigration process. However, as Japanese passport already enjoys several visa-free travel perks, using this card may not always prolong the stay any further (ex: in case of travelling to Chile, South Korea or Taiwan) and rather using this card may reduce the period of stay (eg. travelling to Peru). New Zealand New Zealand citizens can apply for an ABTC if they travel frequently on business and are of a good character through Immigration New Zealand for NZD150. As New Zealand is a full participant of the scheme, foreign cardholders can enter New Zealand visa-free for up to 90 days.  Russia  Card holders are permitted to stay for business purposes for a maximum of 90 days in each period of 180 days. United States Although the United States is not a full participant in the scheme, card holders can use special fast-track lanes for aircrew at international airports in the United States, but they are still subject to regular entry/visa requirements. Applicants for ABTCs must already be enrolled in Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI. As the United States is only a transitional member of the ABTC scheme and does not grant any visa waiver to ABTC holders from other economies, U.S. citizens reciprocally do not enjoy any additional visa-free travel through the ABTC scheme. However, they qualify for expedited visa appointment procedures for those economies which require visas for U.S. citizens, and use of diplomatic or crew lines at airports. Among the 21 ABTC scheme member economies, the visa policies of China, of Russia, and of Vietnam require advance visas for U.S. citizens making short-term business visits, while visa policy of Papua New Guinea issues visas on arrival for a fee. As of 3 January 2017, the fee is $70. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel Cards Act () was passed in November 2011 to authorize the issue of ABTCs to US travellers until September 2018. Implementation began shortly thereafter. In May 2014, the United States Department of Homeland Security published an interim final rule regarding the issuance of ABTCs to U.S. citizens. In June 2014, U.S. Customs and Border Protection began accepting ABTC applications through the GOES portal, the same website used for its other trusted traveler schemes. On November 2, 2017, prior to the September 2018 expiration of the temporary program, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel Cards Act of 2017 (S. 504) was signed making the APEC Business Travel Card a permanent program.https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate- bill/504/all-actions?overview=closed#tabs References Category:Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Category:Expedited border crossing schemes Category:International travel documents ","title":"APEC Business Travel Card"},{"id":"25893521","text":"In quantum mechanics, a product state, or simply separable state, is a special type of separable state in which there are neither classical nor quantum correlations.

The weapon has been in active service since 1968 and 150 were still operational with Argentine forces as of 2000.JWA, p. 25 A similar weapon is the Argentine 105-mm Model 1974 FMK-1 recoilless gun.  Description  The Model 1968 is mounted on a towing carriage with wheels for transport and can be fired either with its wheels on or dismounted onto a tripod. Aiming is primarily done with the optical sight, but the weapon also includes a FAP (fusil automatico pesado, heavy automatic rifle) spotting rifle.JIW, p. 689. Ammunition for the Model 1968 includes both an 11-kilogram high-explosive and a 15-kilogram HEAT round. The Model 1974 fires a 16.6-kilogram HE round with a muzzle velocity of 400 meters/second and a 14.7-kilogram HEAT round at 514 meters/second. The maximum range of the piece is 9,200 meters. Direct fire is limited to 1,800 meters using the optical sight with stadiametric rangefinder or 1,200 meters using the spotting rifle. The Model 1974's range characteristics are the same. The Model 1968 is credited with a 200 mm penetration of armor with its HEAT round.For the caliber of the weapon and the era it was designed in, this estimate is probably less than the true performance of the weapon. Comparable weapons of the same era and caliber could penetrate 300 to 400mm of armor. The HEAT round for the Model 1974 can penetrate 400 mm of armor.JIW 2008. Like many recoilless weapons, there is a significant back-blast from the Model 1968 with a 40-meter danger zone to the rear of the weapon.  Combat history  In the late 1960s or early 1970s, the Argentine military attempted to use it as a self-propelled gun or tank destroyer. At least two prototypes (one being either an IHC M5 or M9 half-track and the other a Bren carrier) were fitted with a six-cannon mount each, similar to that of the US-made M50 Ontos. Between 1977 and 1978, on the eve of Operation Soberan√≠a, many carriers and half-tracks were converted to self-propelled guns by having a single Model 1968 mounted on them. The Model 1968 was fielded by the Argentine Army during the Falklands War. The Model 1974 is in service with Argentina and Guatemala.

The current company is based in the heart of the Cotswolds at Blockley, near Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. History 'Fred' Watson founded the Patent Collapsible Sidecar Company, later renamed to Watsonian Folding Sidecar Company Ltd, after he built a folding sidecar that allowed him to get his motorcycle and sidecar combination through a narrow entrance to the yard at his house. Early sidecars were initially built with wickerwork bodies, which were then replaced by ash frames with plywood or steel panels. During World War I the company built sidecars for use as motorcycle ambulances. In 1922, the company moved to Hockley in Birmingham. Watsonian Side Car, Albion Road, Greet, Birmingham In 1930, the company was renamed to the Watsonian Sidecar Company Ltd. In the same year the factory was destroyed by fire and in 1931 the company moved to new premises in Greet. In 1956, Watsonian took over the rights to the Swallow Sidecars name from Tube Investments. Watsonian was an early supplier to the Swallow Sidecar Company, which after World War II was renamed to Jaguar Cars. From 1956, Watsonian started to manufacture sidecar bodies in glass-reinforced plastic (GRP). As well as civilian models, they also manufactured sidecars for the RAC to use for roadside rescue. Modern Triumph motorcycle with Watsonian sidecar In the 1970s, Watsonian used their expertise in GRP to diversify into production of hardtops for Land Rover and for sports cars. When the Land Rover contract ended in 1981, Watsonian was forced to scale back production and make several staff redundant. In 1984, the company moved to its current location in Blockley. In 1988, Watsonian merged with Squire Sidecars to form Watsonian Squire. From 1999 until 2013, Watsonian were the UK distributor for Royal Enfield motorcycles which are now built in Chennai, India.  Squire  Squire (founded 1973 in Bidford-on-Avon) is a British manufacturer of motorcycle sidecars that pioneered the design of the modern motorcycle trailer for being pulled behind a bike in the early 1980s. In 1988 Squire merged with the struggling Watsonian company to form Watsonian Squire, now the UK's largest sidecar producer.

It is the hub of the Lausanne Metro system. The station's initial building was also the first in the city to use electricity. A station rebuilding project was the subject of a design competition held in 1988.  History = Before the m√©tro  A railway station in this area dates back to the 1870s. Plans were made for the building of an atmospheric railway between Flon, the main Lausanne railway station and Ouchy as early as 1871. Work started on the station site, associated goods facilities and the tunnel under Montb√©non, in 1874. The station opened in 1877, and trains were initially powered by a steam-pumped hydraulic system, the engines using water brought along purpose-built aqueducts from Bret Lake, north of Puidoux. This source of power was a precursor to the provision of electricity, and in 1882 the original Flon station became the first building in the city to have an electrical supply. Meanwhile, the Lausanne-Ouchy company used spoil extracted from the tunnelling of the line to cover the River Flon and create a new ground level. This was attractive to new businesses and warehouses were quickly built on the newly created land, owned by the Lausanne-Ouchy railway company. Between 1877 and 1950, the only change at Flon station itself was the switch from atmospheric operation to funicular. Goods services at Flon were withdrawn in 1953, as Swiss Federal Railways opened a new goods depot closer to their own station. Otherwise, there was no significant change to the station until services changed from cable haulage to electric rack railway operation. Ready for the upgraded service, the station was substantially rebuilt between 1956 and 1958, with lifts provided to reach the streets above. However, the design retained many features from its past as a funicular terminus, meaning rolling stock required doors on only one side.  1980s-2010: rebuilds and additional routes  The first phase of the modern Flon station was constructed for the opening of Line M1 on 24 May 1991. The line's terminal platforms opened in what had by then become a run-down part of the city, to allow interchange with the M√©tro Lausanne‚ÄìOuchy. The Ouchy line closed in January 2006 for conversion to rubber-tyred metro. By this time, major redevelopment of the area was planned to make it more attractive to both business and leisure. The Lausanne-√âchallens-Bercher railway run commuter trains to the north of Lausanne. The LEB company, whose line historically only reached as far as Lausanne-Chauderon, had long aspired to a station actually within the city centre, and on 28 May 2000 its new underground platforms opened. These new parts of the station had been the subject of a design competition in 1988, which was won by Bernard Tschumi Architects. On 27 October 2008, Lausanne's M2 line opened, with a new entrance building. This green-roofed structure, which also contains one of TL's two main ticket offices, was constructed slightly to the north of the 1950s building of the Lausanne-Ouchy station. As with the previous rebuild, design work was completed by Bernard Tschumi Architects, who were tasked with incorporating not only the platforms and escalators, but also a ticket office and offices for TL. The construction enables cross-platform interchange from southbound M2 to the LEB.  Future  Flon station is expected to reach 8 platforms by 2018, as work begins to build a third line in the city's Metro system. Once complete, trains on the M3 route will parallel the LEB line as far as Chauderon station en route to Blecherette, and parallel or share the M2 route all the way to Ouchy. Flon has also been identified as the eastern terminus of the planned T1 tram line, expected to operate to Renens from 2018. Major upgrade work is also planned on the LEB route by 2022, allowing the urban section as far as Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne to operate at a frequency comparable to the m√©tro lines.

Born in Ontario, Alexander Wilkinson Haycock was the son of Joseph Langford Haycock ‚Äì an MPP in Ontario. He was educated at Kingston Collegiate Institute and Queen's University. Prior to the outbreak of the First World War he had taken up residence in the United Kingdom, was working as a commercial traveller, and was a secretary and lecturer for Norman Angell's Neutrality League. In the First World War he was a conscientious objector, and was sentenced by courts-martial to three terms of imprisonment with hard labour after military service tribunals recognised his objection only to the extent of allowing him service in the Non-Combatant Corps, which he refused to accept. Parliamentary career In the 1922 general election he stood as Labour candidate at Winchester, but failed to be elected in this safe Conservative seat. In the following year the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, called an election on the issue of tariff reform. Haycock was chosen to contest the constituency of Salford West, and managed to unseat the sitting Conservative member of parliament, Lieutenant-Commander Frederick Astbury. Following the election, a minority Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald was formed. The administration collapsed in the following year, necessitating a further general election. Haycock attempted to defend his seat, but there was a landslide to the Conservatives, and he was defeated by Astbury, his opponent of the previous year. The next election was held in 1929. Haycock stood once more as Labour candidate at Salford West. There was a swing to Labour, which became the largest party in the Commons for the first time and Haycock returned to parliament. In a notable incident, Haycock publicly defied Manchester City Council's bylaws prohibiting the playing of games in city parks on Sundays. In front of a large crowd he played a game of bowls in Gorton Park and indicated his willingness to suffer imprisonment rather than pay a fine or be bound over. Although his name and address was taken by the park superintendent, no charges were brought. By the time of the next general election in 1931 a National Government had been formed. Haycock and the majority of the Labour Party MPs refused to support the government, and he was heavily defeated by Frederick Astbury, running as a \\"National\\" Conservative, who became Salford West's MP for the third time. Later parliamentary contests At the 1935 general election Haycock attempted to regain the Salford West constituency for Labour, but failed to be elected. Elections were postponed due to the onset of World War II with the next election in 1945. Haycock stood unsuccessfully for Labour at the new constituency of Bucklow, which included parts of Manchester's Wythenshawe council estate. In December 1957 Haycock, then aged 75, and described as a barrister, declared he would stand as an Independent Labour candidate for the forthcoming by-election at Rochdale. He subsequently announced he was considering standing aside, and had invited J B Priestley to stand in his place. He claimed that his doctor had told him \\"this campaign will kill me\\". Priestley, however, denied any interest in contesting the election. In January 1958 Haycock stood aside, feeling his position was very close to that of the TUC and the official Labour Party and he did not want to \\"score a goal for the other side\\". He died at Tarporley in December 1970 aged 87.

The airliner crashed in the Mediterranean Sea and all 66 passengers and crew members on board died. Aircraft The aircraft was a de Havilland DH.106 Comet 4B, registration G-ARCO, the 49th Comet 4 built. It had been owned and operated by British European Airways (BEA) since it was built in 1961. Flight BEA was a shareholder in Cyprus Airways (1947-2015), and the two airlines had an agreement in place for all of Cyprus Airways' jet services to be operated by BEA Comets. Late on the day before the crash the aircraft departed on a night-time BEA service from London Heathrow Airport to Ellinikon International Airport in Athens, Greece, arriving just after 3:00am local time (1:00am UTC) on 12 October. At about 4:30am the aircraft departed Athens on the regular Cyprus Airways flight to Nicosia in Cyprus with 59 passengers and a crew of seven on board. About 45 minutes into the flight, control of the aircraft was transferred from air traffic controllers (ATC) at Athens to their counterparts at Nicosia. The crew contacted Nicosia's controllers by radio, but when ATC replied there was no response from the aircraft. The flight was due to go on to Cairo after Nicosia. Eight passengers had to take a MEA flight the next day. As Flight 284 was flying towards Cyprus at Flight Level 290 [an altitude of approximately ], the aircraft broke up in mid-air about southeast of the island of Rhodes in Greece and about south of the Turkish coastal town of Demre. Aftermath=Recovery of remains and wreckage A total of 51 bodies were recovered from the sea within a day of the crash, most wearing life jackets and some wearing wristwatches that had stopped at 5:25. Investigators concluded that the aircraft had suffered some form of damage during the initial radio call to Nicosia ATC at about 5:15am and had broken up in flight about eight minutes later. They estimated the aircraft's wreckage to be scattered on the seabed over an area of about at a depth of 9,000‚Äì10,000 feet (2,700‚Äì3,050 metres) below the surface. After a drop tank was recovered from the sea, investigators hypothesised that the aircraft crashed due to a mid-air collision with a military aircraft. However searchers also found a cushion from one of the Comet's passenger seats floating on the surface of the sea, which on examination was found to have evidence of an explosion. Analysis of the seat cushion showed traces of a military plastic explosive. After this find the mid-air collision theory was discarded and a decision was made not to retrieve any submerged wreckage. The seat cushion and other recovered objects from the Comet's passenger cabin were analysed by the Forensic Explosive Section of the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment, the first time that this was done.

His wife later discovered the affair and revealed the truth to \\"Jessi\\", but the two continued to chat. However, while \\"Jessi\\" was a real person, Thomas had been chatting with her mother, Mary Shieler, posing as her daughter online. Jessi was unaware of her mother's actions until after Barrett was murdered and her mother's role in the case became public. Production The film's TV rights were sold to MSNBC.

It is an epiphytic orchid with between three and twelve stiff, oblong leaves with a hooked tip. There are up to fifteen star-shaped, cream-coloured, pale green or brownish flowers with red or purple markings. The labellum has three lobes with the middle lobe hollow and containing sticky nectar. It mainly grows on rainforest trees at higher altitudes and is found in tropical North Queensland. Description Mobilabium hamatum is an epiphytic herb with many stiff roots and upright or hanging stems long. Each stem has between three and fifteen stiff, oblong, yellowish green leaves long and wide with a hooked tip. Between five and fifteen cream-coloured, pale green or brownish flowers with brownish or purplish markings, long and wide are borne on flowering stems long. The sepals and petals spread widely apart from each other, the sepals about long and wide, the petals slightly shorter and narrower. There is a hinge between the column and the labellum, the latter with three lobes. The middle lobe is rounded and hollow, containing sticky nectar. Flowering occurs from July to August. Taxonomy and naming Mobilabium hamatum was first formally described in 1946 by Herman Rupp and the description was published in The North Queensland Naturalist. The type specimen was sent to Rupp by Thomas Edgar Hunt who called it \\"hookey leaf\\" and whose brother \\"R.Hunt\\" had collected it. The name Mobilabium is derived from the Latin words mobilis meaning \\"mobile\\" and labium meaning \\"lip\\".. The specific epithet (hamatum) is a Latin word meaning \\"with hooks\\" or \\"hooked\\". Distribution and habitat Hook-leaf mostly grows on rainforest trees, sometimes on isolated trees in paddocks and on other plants near streams, at altitudes between .

Public Works undertook extensive interior renovations to convert the building to general office use, which included the installation of a glass atrium over the former light court of the 4th-7th floors to create more contiguous space. Between 2008 and 2009, it undertook extensive repairs on the tower portion of the building. These included complete removal, cleaning, and restoration of the sandstone exterior and repairs to the underlying steel frame. The tower restoration also included the installation of a new copper dome similar to the original. Although since surpassed, the Dominion Public Building was the tallest building in Halifax at the time of its completion in 1936. The building is a federally recognized heritage building. Notable heritage features include the stone structure, the large stone seahorses at the roof level and in the main lobby, the remaining brass postal wickets and the lobby's marble floors and dedication to Edward VIII.

Orchids in this genus are epiphytic or lithophytic plants with the leaves arranged fan-like, overlapping at the base and spreading near the tips. Large numbers of tiny, short-lived, cup-shaped, non- resupinate flowers are arranged on an arching flowering stem that emerges from the base of the uppermost leaf. There are about 240 species occurring from tropical and southern Africa to the Pacific. Description Orchids in the genus Pinalia are epiphytic or lithophytic, sympodial herbs with the leaves in an unusual fan-like arrangement, in two overlapping rows near the base before spreading. A large number of tiny, non-resupinate, short-lived flowers are arranged in whorls or spirals along an arching flowering stem. The sepals and petals are all more or less similar to and free from each other although the petals are narrower than the sepals. The labellum is rigidly fixed to the base of the column and usually has three lobes. Taxonomy and naming The genus Oberonia was first formally described in 1830 by John Lindley who published the description in The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants. The name Oberonia is a reference to Oberon, the king of the fairies, referring to the tiny flowers of these orchids and to their unusual arrangement on the flowering stems. Distribution Orchids in the genus Oberonia are native to tropical Africa, southern Asia including India, China, Japan, Indochina, Indonesia and the Philippines) and to Australia, and various islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

Plants in this genus are small, orchids with short stems, thin roots, short, thick, fleshy leaves arranged in two ranks and tiny flowers. The labellum is rigidly attached to the base of the column. There are about fifty species native to areas from Sri Lanka and Malesia to the Western Pacific. Description Orchids in the genus Octarrhena are small epiphytic, lithophytic or terrestrial herbs with thin roots and short stems with short, thick, fleshy leaves, their bases sheathing the stem. A large number of tiny, usually white, cream-coloured, yellowish or greenish flowers are arranged on a flowering stem arising from a leaf axil. The sepals and petals are free from each other, the petals usually much smaller than the sepals. The labellum is small, unlobed, rigidly fixed to the column and lacks a spur. Taxonomy and naming The genus Octarrhena was first formally described in 1861 by George Henry Kendrick Thwaites who published the description in Enumeratio plantarum Zeylaniae. The name Octarrhena is derived from the Ancient Greek words okto meaning \\"eight\\" and arrhen meaning \\"male\\" or \\"masculine\\", referring the eight free pollinia in the anther.

It is related to Eulophia and like that genus is mostly terrestrial in habit. A few species extend into very arid environments, unusual for an orchid. The genus contains about 40 known species, most of which are narrow endemics to parts of Madagascar with some widespread across much of sub-Saharan Africa and the islands of the Indian Ocean.

In the same year he created, drew and wrote, the comic character Skid Kidd for IPC's Buster comic.

The character and the backgrounds were drawn flat, with a rigid, inflexible nib, in order that the eye of the reader should not be distracted by thick and thin lines.

It is a small, epiphytic orchid with many thin roots, between two and six linear leaves and up to eight pale green or brownish flowers. The flowers are fragrant, produce nectar and have a warty labellum. It grows on shrubs and trees in humid places and near streams and is found between south-east Queensland and the Sydney region in New South Wales. Description Papillilabium beckleri is an epiphytic herb with many thin, wiry roots, a single shoot and stems long. Each stem has between two and six linear to lance-shaped, leaves long and wide, often with pink or purple spots. Up to eight pale green or brownish flowers long and wide, sometimes with purple markings, are borne on flowering stems long. The sepals and petals spread widely apart from each other, the sepals about long and wide, the petals slightly narrower. The labellum is white, green or yellowish, sometimes with purple markings, about long, wide with three lobes. The side lobes are long and narrow and the middle lobe is warty with a spur long. Flowering occurs from September to October. Taxonomy and naming The imp orchid was first formally described in 1873 by George Bentham from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller. Bentham gave it the name Cleisostoma beckleri and published the description in Flora Australiensis from a specimen collected by Hermann Beckler near the Clarence River. In 1967, Alick Dockrill changed the name to Papillilabium beckleri. The name Papillilabium is derived from the Latin words papilla meaning \\"nipple\\", \\"teat\\"or \\"bud\\" and labium meaning \\"lip\\".. The specific epithet honours the collector of the type specimen. Distribution and habitat Papillilabium beckleri grows on shrubs and trees in humid places and near streams and is found between Mapleton in Queensland and the Royal National Park in New South Wales.

It is a collaboration between The Knife, Mt. Sims and Planningtorock. It was released digitally on 1 February 2010 through The Knife's own label Rabid Records prior to the physical release. The lyrics contain excerpts of Darwin's writings, particularly On the Origin of Species. These are often without context, though the meaning of some songs is clear, for example 'Seeds' refers to Darwin's experiments to determine why certain plants are found on the coasts of many continents, despite their separation, in which he demonstrated that seeds of some plants remain viable after weeks in cold seawater, and 'Annie's Box' refers to the pivotal moment when Darwin's daughter Annie died of tuberculosis, which damaged his Christian faith, helping him to overcome his fears about the church's reaction to On the Origin of Species. The music appears to have been composed to reflect the long arc of evolution, with the first songs having a hard, noisy and simple quality, subsequent tracks building in beauty and complexity, and incorporating progressively more lyrics and musical sounds based on animal vocalisations. Choreography was also inspired by animal behaviour including the courtship dances of birds. The opera was completed in 2009 to mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species and toured Europe in 2010. The album was recorded, mixed and produced in Berlin, Stockholm and Copenhagen between 2008 and 2009. Recording for the live percussion took place at Sounds Studio in Iceland, while outdoor sounds were recorded at the Mamori Artlab Workshop on the Amazon River, Brazil.

A linebacker for the New England Patriots (1972), the Houston Oilers (1973, 1974, 1975) and the Denver Broncos (1974), Cindrich graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1972 and South Texas College of Law in 1978. During his more than three-plus decades as an NFL agent, he has represented stars such as James Farrior, Bruce Gradkowski, Tarik Glenn, Jeff Blake, Brian Griese, Al Toon, Dermontti Dawson, and Will Wolford among others. As an agent, Cindrich also negotiated one of the landmark contracts in sports history, one that forever altered the salary hierarchy in the NFL, and would be prominently featured in Michael Lewis' book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game. High school Cindrich was born in Washington, Pennsylvania, to Anthony and Stella Cindrich. Beginning in the fall of 1963, he attended nearby Avella High School where he starred on the wrestling and football teams. During his junior season in 1966, Cindrich was the Pennsylvania State runner-up in the unlimited weight classMarch 14, 1966, Delaware County Times, \\"Paxon Is State Champion\\" and again in 1967, losing in the finals to Dave Joyner of State College, PAMarch 13, 1967, Leader- Times, Kittanning, PA, \\"3 WPIAL Rulers Win State Mat Titles, Claypool Bows\\" in overtime on a disputed grabbing the jersey call. Cindrich wrestled 2 periods and overtime with 2 broken hand bones. Cindrich claimed the Western Pennsylvania Heavyweight Championship and went undefeated and untied in dual meets in both his junior and senior seasons.http://www.cindrich.com Cindrich was just as good, if not better, as a linebacker and center for Avella High's varsity football team. He was named All Western Pennsylvania High School Football Selection in 1966 and 1967. In 1967, Cindrich was chosen as Pennsylvania All State and Most Valuable Player of Western Pennsylvania Class B Football. That year, he also served as Captain of the state's All Star \\"Big 33\\" team that played against a Texas All Star football team. College Although he was recruited by several top college programs, Cindrich chose to stay close to his Western Pennsylvania home, opting to play football for the University of Pittsburgh. He continued to wrestle for the Pitt Panthers, winning the NCAA Eastern Heavyweight Championship in 1969, in addition to being named an All-American and taking 4th in the NCAA Tournament.September 4, 1969, The Progress, \\"All America: The Family Weekly 1971 Defensive Team\\" As a linebacker for the Panthers football team, Cindrich became a starter during his sophomore year. In the team's season opener on the road against the UCLA Bruins, Cindrich burst on the scene, with 17 tackles‚ÄîWest Virginia Mountaineers's Head Coach, Jim Carlens, said of Cindrich \\"If there's a better sophomore linebacker in America, I'd like to see himSeptember 26, 1968, The Dominion-News, WV, \\"Mickey Furfari's Fan-Fare\\"\\"‚Äîbut a broken ankle in that game forced him to miss the rest of the season. After redshirting during the rest of the 1968 season, Cindrich returned as a starter in 1969. In the Panthers second game of the season on the road against the Oklahoma Sooners, he led the team with 21 tackles (10 solo tackles).October 3, 1969, Gettysburg Times, \\"Cindrich May Be Panther All-American\\" Later that year he was named to the All-East Team, All-Conference Team, and All-American team despite Pitt's sixth consecutive losing season. In 1970, Cindrich suffered a knee injury in the season's opener against UCLA. It kept him out of the lineup early in the season, but he returned to help lead the team to a 5-5 record in 1970. The injury to his knee kept Cindrich from playing spring football as a senior in 1971, but he was ready to play once the season started. In the opener the Panthers traveled to the Rose Bowl and upset the UCLA Bruins, 29-25. Cindrich was named Lineman of the Week by the Associated Press for his eight tackles, four assists and two fumble recoveries.September 16, 1971, The Derrick, Oil City, PA, \\"Cindrich: AP Top Lineman\\" Later that season, he helped secure a win over Syracuse with three of his game-high 16 tackles coming on a goal line stand late in the Panther victory. Again Cindrich was named to the All-East Team, All-Conference Team and Associated Press All-American team. NFL The Atlanta Falcons selected Cindrich with their fifth round pick (119th overall) in the 1972 NFL Draft, but released him near the end of the preseason. A week later, New England claimed Cindrich off waivers and he was named AP Player of the Week in a game against the eventual Super Bowl Champion Miami Dolphins. New England cut him before the start of the 1973 season, but he was picked up by the Houston Oilers, where he played for during the next two seasons. After being cut by the Denver Broncos during the 1975 preseason, the Oilers resigned Cindrich for the remainder of the season. He retired following the 1975 season. Law School and early agent's career During his career with the Oilers, Cindrich began law school at nearby South Texas College of Law, in Houston. He founded Cindrich & Company, a sports representation firm in 1977 and graduated with his law degree in 1978. His first big name client was Mark May, an offensive tackle from Cindrich's alma mater, the University of Pittsburgh. The Washington Redskins selected May with their first round pick (20th overall) in the 1981 NFL Draft. After tough and very public negotiations that summer with the Redskins General Manager Bobby Beathard, May signed with the team in late July putting to rest rumors that he would bolt to the Canadian Football League.July 23, 1981, Daily News-Record, Harrisonburg, VA, \\"May Gets Extra $100,000 From, Holdout\\" Cindrich would continue to represent May, negotiating every one of his NFL contracts as well as all of his deals as an announcer with Turner, CBS, and later as an ESPN College football analyst. The two remain close friends. By the 1985 NFL Draft, Cindrich would have a significant impact. Two of his clients, Al Toon from the University of Wisconsin and Bill Fralic from the University of Pittsburgh, were expected to be top draft picks. During ESPN's televised coverage of the draft, Mel Kiper Jr. stated: > We'll see what an impact Ralph Cindrich has on this draft right away. I > think Minnesota wanted (Bill) Fralic. I know, you talk about Indianapolis, > they would have taken Al Toon but he (Cindrich) wrote a letter to Irsay > stating that he didn't want Toon to play with the Colts. Same with > Minnesota. So we'll see if those teams shy away from Fralic and Toon. We > will see if Cindrich has a direct impact on the draft.Cindrich & Company > History Cindrich told the press that Fralic would not want to play for Minnesota, who held the second overall pick, because of the team's negotiating history.April 25, 1985, Indiana Gazette, \\"Pitt's Fralic upset over prospect of Minnesota\\" On Draft Day, the Vikings traded their pick to the Atlanta Falcons for a 1st and 3rd round selection. The Falcons then selected Fralic, who signed the most lucrative contract for any lineman in the draft, including the top overall pick, Buffalo's Bruce Smith. The impact of Fralic's deal was longlasting: > Fralic's contract is so lucrative that it has caused slowdown in the next > eleven picks below him in the first round of the draft. No other Number 1 > has such an annuity package nor a present value this high. Defensive end > Bruce Smith, the draft's No. 1 pick, signed a $2.8 Million contract for the > Buffalo Bills, which is worth $2.1 Million in present value.

The New York Jets selected Toon with the 10th overall pick. He held out, and still without a contract by late August, Cindrich publicly suggested that the Jets trade Toon.August 28, 1985, New York Times, \\"Jets Not Counting on Toon for Opener\\" But by Week 2 of the regular season (and after New York lost 31-0 to the Los Angeles Raiders), Toon signed a deal worth reportedly worth $1.6 million over five years, including a signing bonus worth $475,000. The deal paid him more money than any other receiver drafted in 1985, including the San Francisco 49ers first round selection, Jerry Rice.Cindrich & Company History Gruber and beyond The next major contribution by Cindrich and Company came in 1988. In that year's draft, Cindrich represented Wisconsin Offensive Tackle Paul Gruber. Looking to protect their young quarterback Vinny Testaverde, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected Gruber with the 4th overall pick in the draft. Gruber missed four weeks of training camp but signed a five year, $3.8 million deal with the team in early August. That month, The Sporting News declared Cindrich's negotiations \\"the most significant contract for any rookie this year\\" and \\"the best contract ever signed by an offensive lineman and likely will start a new salary spiral at the position.\\"August 29, 1988, The Sporting News, \\"Linemen's Pact Sets New Standard\\" Cindrich was now widely recognized as the best agent for NFL offensive lineman. In 1989, Cindrich helped facilitate the now famous \\"Herschel Walker trade\\" between the Dallas Cowboys and Minnesota Vikings. As part of his new contract with the Vikings, Walker received $1.25 million in cash and other considerations (including a Mercedes- Benz automobile) and more than doubled his previous salary.Cindrich & Company History Cindrich had now negotiated the second and third most lucrative contracts in the NFL. He also achieved considerable salary raises for Pro Bowlers John Offerdahl, linebacker for the Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills Shane Conlan (linebacker), Will Wolford (offensive tackle), and Kent Hull (center). The \\"Free Agent Champ\\" During the early 1990s Cindrich's stable of all- star players would expand to include Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Bowl tight end Eric Green, Washington Redskins Pro Bowl wide receiver Gary Clark, Dallas Cowboys Pro Bowl center Mark Stepnoski. In May 1993, just as the NFL Free Agency boom began, USA Today called Cindrich \\"the undisputed free agent champ.\\"May 3, 1993, The Sporting News Multimillion-dollar contracts continued throughout the decade. Steelers perennial pro bowl center Dermontti Dawson, New York Giants running back Rodney Hampton, quarterbacks Gus Frerotte and Jeff Blake, were just a few of Cindrich's clients. He seemed to have the market cornered at one position in particular: during the late 1990s and early 2000s, he represented a handful of the NFL's top centers: Dawson, Stepnoski, Hull, the Miami Dolphins Tim Ruddy, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Jeff Christy, the Baltimore Ravens Mike Flynn (American football), the Indianapolis Colts Jeff Saturday, and the New Orleans Saints LeCharles Bentley. The Blind Side One of Cindrich's top clients was offensive tackle Will Wolford. As the 20th overall pick of the Buffalo Bills in the 1986 NFL Draft, Cindrich negotiated a deal for Wolford that paid him a salary equal to several players drafted in the top 10.Cindrich & Company History In 1993, Cindrich orchestrated Wolford's free agent signing with Indianapolis, where his contract was worth $7.65 million over three year. Wolford was now the highest paid offensive lineman in the NFL. When that contract expired in 1995, Wolford signed a four-year, $10 million with the Pittsburgh Steelers.Cindrich & Company History Michael Lewis' book, The Blind Side. As the man who brokered the deal, Cindrich was also mentioned: 2005 and beyond At the end of 2005 Cindrich sold his sports agency to Debartolo Sports. He now serves as consultant to Debartolo and continues to negotiate contracts for such notable players as Eagles wide receiver Steve Smith, Cardinals running back Beanie Wells, Steelers linebacker James Farrior, and the Colts Jeff Saturday. Cindrich is also organized developing and planning to teach a sports law class for law students, as well as a continuing legal education sports law class for lawyers; both were offered in Italy during the Summer of 2010. Cindrich and his family lived in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania for much of his post-NFL career, including from 1994 to 2007 in the former home of NHL legend Mario Lemeiux; he and his wife now live in downtown Pittsburgh. Honors and awards Cindrich has often been included in the upper echelon of NFL Agents according to Pro Football Weekly, USA Today, the Denver Post, the Chicago Times, and the Dallas Morning News. The Sporting News twice ranked him as one of the top 100 most powerful people in sports. He has been inducted into the Western Pennsylvania Hall of Fame, the Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame, the Washington County Hall of Fame and the Avella High School Hall of Fame. He was selected to the University of Pittsburgh All Time Football Team, Walk of Fame, and in was the recipient of Washington County's Distinguished Citizen Award in Football.Cindrich & Company History NFL Brawler In 2015, Cindrich published, NFL BRAWLER, A Player- Turned-Agent's Forty Years in the Bloody Trenches of the National Football League. NFL BRAWLER takes readers behind the scenes of major NFL drafts, deals and trades providing a first hand account of his decades in the football business. He writes about NFL personnel like Jimmy Johnson and Bill Polian, owners Art Rooney, Bob Irsay, and Jerry Jones and players such as Herschel Walker, Bill Fralic and James Farrior. Brash and entertaining, Cindrich tells it like it is.

It is a second generation Indian Bridge Layer Tank (BLT), first introduced in 1989. Hull It features an elongated Vijayanta Tank's hull with seven Bogie wheel stations, the same used for the M-46 Catapult integrated to a hydraulically operated bridge laying system. Bridge The Kartik AVLB uses the scissors style bridge of the Czech MT-55. The bridge is folded for carriage and scissored out for usage and is deployed and recovered from the front of the vehicle. The 20 metres (66 ft) long 'KARTIK' 60 Military Load Class (MLC) bridge is 4 m wide thus one of the widest tank bridges in the world. The bridge can accommodate two-lanes traffic of jeeps and one lane traffic of 3 tonners, t-72s and BMPs. It is compact for transportation and fits in a space of 10.5 m length, 3.5 m width and 3.96 m height. To keep it light, RDE-40 Al alloy along with innovative geometry have been used . The use of high pressure hydraulic drives and actuators instead of electro-chemical drives give advantage of reduced weight. The high pressure hydraulic system gives the muscle power to lift the bridge in the folded climbing gradients or descending slopes. The basic vehicle is powered by indigenously manufactured 6-cylinder, opposed piston, vertical in line, water cooled, two stroke CI engine with uni- flow scavenging coupled to a semiautomatic transmission with 6 forward and 2 reverse speed . suspension is provided by trailing arm type torsion bar with all road wheel stations the vehicle also has secondary torsion bars and double acting telescope shock absorbers in the two front and rear stations. Low ground pressure, adequate power-to-weight ratio improved suspension and final drive result in good mobility of the vehicle. Armament Air Defense Machine Gun is provided for effective ground and anti aircraft role. Blt crew has been provided with their personal weapons for self-protection. Deployment The multi-span assault bridge with fully decked roadway and foldable deck mechanism has been successfully developed and accepted by Indian army. As of 2003, India has produced 34 Kartik AVLBs. Canal Embankment Assault Equipment The Canal Embankment Assault Equipment is a special type of bridging system developed by the Research & Development Establishment (Engineers), Pune. It is suitable for high bank canals up to 4.5m as encountered in India's western borders. As of 1998 user assisted technical evaluation of the system has been completed successfully. Six tracked vehicles have been developed as variants of Vijayanta.

The battle took place in the Macedonian front during the First World War Allied Monastir Offensive in October and November 1916. After extremely heavy fighting and severe casualties on both sides, the Bulgarians retreated from Bitola on the 19 November and took positions at 5 km to the north defeating all later attacks from there. However, the Entente entry in Bitola had no strategic value.Mann, A. J., The Salonika Front, A&C; Black, London, 1920, p. 70 The battle In August 1916 the Bulgarians launched the Lerin operation. The Entente troops started a counter-attack and on 30 September took Kajmakƒçalan with heavy casualties and continued to Bitola. In the area of the River Crna (Macedonian and , ) the Bulgarian 8th Tundzha Infantry Division had taken hastily defensive positions in September 1916. That division took the main enemy blow. On 5 October the Serbian troops made their first attempt to cross the river. Some of them reach the right bank but were counter-attacked by the Bulgarians and defeated and had to retreat. On 6 October the Serbs attack again near the villages of Dobroveni and Skochivir but were again counter-attacked and pushed back. The Bulgarians took the village of Brod. The Serbs who had great superiority in artillery attacked constantly. On 14 and 15 October 1916 the fights continued without interruption. The Serbian pressure was immense and the Bulgarians continued to hold their positions. During the night of 15 October was one of the culmination moments of the battle when the Serbs made 8 successive attacks which were all repulsed. The Serbs then recovered for three days and on 18 October they crossed the left bank of the River Crna at Brod and fortified it. The Bulgarian army counter-attacked but was repulsed. On 23 October the artillery fire of the Entente grew even more. The French were fighting near Kremenitsa. In the course of a week the Bulgarians tried to push them back without success but all Serbian attacks were also unsuccessful which led to massive casualties for both sides. Due to lack of munitions the Bulgarian artillery had to save shells which had a negative effect on the moral of the soldiers. On 7 November the enemy artillery started intense fire at 3/8 Brigade which occupied positions between Krape and Polog. After three days the losses of the brigade became so immense that on 10 November it abandoned its positions which were taken by the Serbs. On 19 November the Bulgarians also had to retreat from Bitola and took positions at 5 km to the north of the town. The front stabilized on the line Pelister - Hill 1248 - Hill 1050 - Dabica - Grade≈°nica. Aftermath The Entente continued with their attempts for a breakthrough against the Bulgarians in the area of the River Crna in the next year again without any success. The allied offensive in spring 1917 was a failure. The Bulgarian-German army continued to hold the Macedonian Front against French, British, Serbian and Greek troops until the Franco-Serbian breakthrough at Dobro Pole on 15 September 1918.

Berger- Barzilai was born in Cracow, Austria, in 1904. In 1914, his family fled the Russian army which threatened to invade their city for Vienna, and returned in 1916. He emigrated to Palestine at the age of 15 in 1920. Originally a Zionist, he became a communist and took part in the founding of the Communist Party of Palestine in 1922 and became its secretary. In 1924, he was sent to Beirut to establish a branch of the party. The result was the Lebanese People's Party, a front organization, which was founded in October the same year around a communist party of Lebanon and Syria.Tareq Y. Ismael and Jacqueline S. Ismael: The Communist movement in Syria and Lebanon p.7f. (1998). In 1924-25, Berger-Barzilai spent a few months in Moscow, where he met his wife Esther Feldman, a Russian Jew. Upon his return to Palestine, he was arrested for illegal activities in the Communist party and Comintern, but was only fined. After another trip to Moscow, the police authorities refused to let him in on August 16, 1926. As a stateless citizen, he had to remain aboard an Italian ship that sailed back and forth for six weeks. The International Aid Organization for Arrested Revolutionaries, together with Zionists, managed to obtain his release. After that, he lived in an Arab village, Beit Safafa, under false identity. He continued to lead the party and met with Comintern emissaries. In the spring of 1928, he was again called to Moscow, where he had a five-hour meeting with Stalin on May 5, 1929. He received the order to sever the ties with the Arab Executive Committee and other parts of the Arab nationalist movement. He returned to Palestine in 1929 to take command of the party after the riots that year.Jacob Hen-Tov: Communism and Zionism in Palestine: The Comintern and the Political Unrest in the 1920s Transaction, 1974. In 1932, he was summoned to Moscow, where he became a Soviet citizen and, after a short period as lecturer at the University of Moscow, a militant Comintern official who headed the Near Eastern section, and worked close to Stalin. Two years later, however, he was dismissed from his post and expelled from the party, and on January 27, 1935, he was arrested. In a summary trial, he was sentenced to death, but was pardoned and sent to prisons and slave labor camps in Siberia. In 1951, he was released, only to be sentenced to another life term. His wife and son were also persecuted on his account, and they could see him only after 15 years, when they were allowed to visit him in Siberia. Berger remained a staunch communist, and relates that he and his family had lost a common language when they had abandoned Marxism. He spent twenty years in Siberia under severe hardships until he was released and rehabilitated in 1956. Thanks to his Polish origin, he was allowed to leave Russia, and eventually went to Israel.

Festina lente () or spe√ªde brad√©≈çs () is a classical adage and oxymoron meaning \\"make haste slowly\\" (sometimes rendered in English as \\"more haste, less speed\\"). It has been adopted as a motto numerous times, particularly by the emperors Augustus and Titus, the Medicis and the Onslows. The original form of the saying, spe≈©de brad√©os, is Classical Greek, of which festina lente is the Latin translation. The words and festina are second- person-singular present active imperatives, meaning \\"make haste\\", while and lente are adverbs, meaning \\"slowly\\". History The adage, in Greek and Latin, with the anchor and the dolphin, among the seven emblems of the University of Salamanca. The Roman historian Suetonius, in De vita Caesarum, tells that Augustus deplored rashness in a military commander, thus \\"\\" was one of his favourite sayings: Certain gold coins minted for Augustus bore images of a crab and a butterfly to attempt an emblem for the adage. Other such visualizations include a hare in a snail shell; a chameleon with a fish; a diamond ring entwined with foliage; and perhaps most recognizably, a dolphin entwined around an anchor. Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany took festina lente as his motto and illustrated it with a sail-backed tortoise. The Renaissance printer Aldus Manutius adopted the symbol of the dolphin and anchor as his printer's mark. Erasmus (whose books were published by Manutius) featured the phrase in his Adagia and used it to compliment his printer: \\"Aldus, making haste slowly, has acquired as much gold as he has reputation, and richly deserves both.\\" Manutius showed Erasmus a Roman silver coin, given to him by Cardinal Bembo, which bore the dolphin-and-anchor symbol on the reverse side. The adage was popular in the Renaissance era and Shakespeare alluded to it repeatedly. In Love's Labour's Lost, he copied the crab and butterfly imagery with the characters Moth and Armado. The French poet and critic Nicolas Boileau, in his Art po√©tique (The Art of Poetry) (1674) applied the dictum specifically to the work of the writer, whom he advised in those words: Jean de la Fontaine alluded to the motto in his famous fable of \\"The Hare and the Tortoise\\" (Fables, 1668‚Äì94), writing that the tortoise \\"with a prudent wisdom hastens slowly\\".Jean de la Fontaine, The Fables of La Fontaine, trans. Elizur Wright Jr., London: William Smith, 1842, p. 36. The Onslow family of Shropshire has the adage as its motto, generating a pun upon the family name: \\"on-slow\\". The adage was a favourite of the influential judge, Sir Matthew Hale, Meaning The meaning of the phrase is that activities should be performed with a proper balance of urgency and diligence. If tasks are rushed too quickly then mistakes are made and good long-term results are not achieved. Work is best done in a state of flow in which one is fully engaged by the task and there is no sense of time passing. Allusions In physics, the name \\"Festina Lente Limit\\" has been applied to the Strong Confinement Limit, which is a mode of an atom laser in which the frequency of emission of the Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate is less than the confinement frequency of the trap. Composer Arvo P√§rt wrote Festina lente for strings and harp, in which some instruments play the melody at half-speed while others play it at double-speed, so the music is both fast and slow. Goethe refers to both the proverb and Augustus' adoption of it in his poem Hermann und Dorothea (helpfully for poetry, the German rendition itself rhymes‚Äî\\"Eile mit Weile\\"): The Lord Chancellor uses the phrase in W S Gilbert's Iolanthe: \\"Recollect yourself I pray, and be careful what you say ‚Äî as the ancient Romans said, festina lente.\\" The novel Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan involves a secret society devoted to Aldus Manutius, whose members use \\"Festina lente\\" as a motto/greeting.

It is an epiphytic or lithophytic orchid with more or less pendulous stems, between three and ten widely spaced, leathery leaves and a large number of pale green, often spotted flowers. It mainly grows on tree trunks and thick vines in rainforest and is found between the Bloomfield River in Queensland and Port Macquarie in New South Wales. Description Peristeranthus hillii is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with one or two shoots and more or less pendulous stems long. Each stem has between three and ten narrow oblong leaves long and wide. The leaves have many parallel veins, a drooping tip and are often twisted. Between twenty five and seventy five pale green flowers often with crimson markings, long and wide are borne on pendulous flowering stems long. The sepals and petals spread widely apart from each other and are about long and wide. The labellum is yellow with red spots, about long, wide with three lobes. The side lobes are triangular and the middle lobe has a hollow, tapered spur. Flowering occurs from September to October. Taxonomy and naming The beetle orchid was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Saccolabium hillii and published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected by Walter Hill near Moreton Bay. In 1954, Trevor Edgar Hunt changed the name to Peristeranthus hillii. According to Hunt, the name Peristeranthus is derived from the Greek words peristera meaning \\"dove\\" and anthus meaning \\"flower\\", as \\"the flower\\" is \\"bearing a fanciful resemblance to a dove\\". In ancient Greek, \\"flower\\" is however anthos (·ºÑŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940).

The specific epithet honours the collector of the type specimen. Distribution and habitat Peristeranthus hillii mainly grows on three trunks and vines in highland rainforest in the tropics and in coastal and near-coastal areas in subtropical regions. It is found between the Bloomfield River in Queensland and Port Macquarie in New South Wales. Conservation This orchid is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act. The main threats to the species are habitat loss, storm damage, inappropriate fire regimes and illegal collecting.

Hart - Engraver: J. Watts - \\"The botanical register\\" vol. 10 pl. 862 Description Orchids in the genus Peristylis are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with paired fleshy tubers and thread-like, unbranched roots. The stems are upright and unbranched. The leaves are arranged in a rosette at the base of the plants or near the centre of the stem. The flowers are resupinate, usually small, often crowded, white, green or yellowish and usually only last a few days. The dorsal sepal and petals overlap to form a hood over the column. The labellum has a spur and usually three lobes which may be short or long and threadlike. The distinguishing feature of the genus is the presence of two club-shaped projections on the stigma. In many respects, plants in this genus are similar to those in Habenaria, only differing in the structure of the column. Taxonomy and naming The genus Peristylus was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume and the description was published in Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi√´ . The genus Peristylus is derived from the Greek words peri meaning 'around', and stylos 'column', referring to the arms on each side of the column.

It was originally named as Caladenia deformis and has since had several name changes. Plants have a single, narrow, hairy leaf and usually blue flowers with relatively short, broad sepals and petals and an unusual labellum.Pheladenia deformis labellum detail Description Pheladenia deformis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and a tuber partly surrounded by a fibrous sheath. The tuber produces two \\"droppers\\" which become daughter tubers in the following year. There is a single hairy convolute leaf at the base of the plant. The leaf is linear, long and wide with a few hairs, especially on the edges, about long. There is usually a single flower on a stem high. The three sepals and two lateral petals are long, wide. The outer surface usually has a few glandular hairs and the inner surface is bright blue, or sometimes white, pinkish or yellow. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum. The labellum is dark blue near its tip, white near the base, long, wide. The edge of the labellum is fringed and there are many stalked calli, giving rise to the name blue beard . The column is long, wide. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown who gave it the name Caladenia deformis. The description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae from a specimen collected at \\"Port Dalrymple\\", now George Town in Tasmania. In 2000, Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown changed the name to Cyanicula deformis and in 2001, David Jones and Mark Clements changed it to the present name. The genus name (Pheladenia) is from the Ancient Greek words phelos meaning \\"deceitful\\" and aden meaning \\"gland\\", hence \\"false gland, alluding to the distinctive labellum call\\". The specific epithet (deformis) is a Latin word meaning \\"misshapen\\", again referring to the unusual labellum. Distribution and habitat Blue fairy orchid grows in a variety of habitats, from the margins of swamps to granite outcrops, heath, woodland and forest. It occurs in all states of Australia except Queensland and the Northern Territory. In Western Australia it is found from north of Kalbarri to as far east as Israelite Bay on the south coast. In New South Wales it is uncommon but sometimes forms clumps on the Central West Slopes and South West Plains south from Molong.

The operation was conceived as a raid to prepare the ground for a larger American invasion. The Americans succeeded in crossing the Niagara and landing at both of their points of attack. They achieved one of their two objectives before withdrawing but the invasion was subsequently called off, rendering useless what had been accomplished. The engagement was named, \\"the Battle of Frenchman's Creek\\"Zaslow, p. 229. by the Canadians, after the location of some of the severest fighting. To contemporary Americans, it was known as, \\"the Affair opposite Black Rock\\". The battle site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1921. Background After the American defeat at the Battle of Queenston Heights, command of the U.S. Army of the CentreQuimby, p. 78. on the Niagara Frontier passed from Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer of the New York Militia to his second-in-command, Brigadier General Alexander Smyth of the Regular U.S. Army. Smyth had deeply resented being subordinated to a militia officerZaslow, p. 26. and this was the opportunity for which he had been waiting. He immediately planned to invade Canada with 3,000 troops. Assembling his forces at Buffalo, he directed a two-pronged attack in advance of his main invasion. Captain William King, with 220 men, was to cross the Niagara and spike the batteries at the Red House, beside Fort Erie, in order to enable Smyth's main invasion force to land without facing artillery fire. At the same time, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Boerstler, with 200 men, was to land in Canada between Fort Erie and Chippawa and destroy the bridge over Frenchman's Creek in order to hinder the bringing-up of British reinforcements to oppose Smyth's landing.Quimby, p. 76, for Smyth's plan. Quimby wrongly gives Captain King's first name as 'Samson'. King's real first name is in his report to General Smyth, given in Cruikshank, p. 245. Lieutenant General George Prevost, the Governor General of the Canadas, forbade any offensive action on the Niagara frontier, leaving British forces no alternative but wait for an American attack. The British commander-in-chief in North America, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, had forbidden any offensive action on the Niagara Frontier. This left the local British forces with no alternative but to wait for the Americans to make the first move and try to counter any attempt at invasion. The regular troops were distributed among the defensive outposts and supplemented with militia and Native American forces.Malcomson, p. 47. In a floridly worded proclamation, published on 10 November and addressed \\"To The Men of New York\\", Smyth wrote that, \\"in a few days the troops under my command will plant the American standard in Canada\\" and he urged New Yorkers not to \\"stand with your arms folded and look on in this interesting struggle\\" but to \\"advance‚Ä¶to our aid. I will wait for you a few days.\\"Cruikshank, pp. 193‚Äì194 Smyth's statement of intent appears to have attracted no attention from his opponents across the border. Opposing forces Captain William King of the 13th U.S. Regiment of InfantryCruikshank, p. 291. was detailed to attack the Red House with 150 troops and 70 U.S. Navy sailors under Lieutenant Samuel Angus. King's soldiers came from Captain Willoughby Morgan's company of the 12th U.S. Regiment of InfantryHeitman, Volume 1, p. 726; Heitman, Volume 2, p. 391; Cruikshank, p. 245. and Captains John Sproull and John E. Wool's companies of the 13th Regiment.Heitman, Volume 1, pp. 913 and 1059; Heitman, Volume 2, p. 391; Cruikshank, p. 245. Lieutenant Colonel Charles Boerstler was directed against Frenchman's Creek with 200 men of his own 14th U.S. Regiment of Infantry.Cruikshank, p. 237. Colonel William H. Winder, commander of the 14th Regiment, was in reserve, with 350 of his own regiment.Cruikshank, p. 288, for Winder's numbers; Cruikshank, p. 259, for his detachment being from his own regiment; Heitman, Volume 1, p. 1049 for his colonelcy of the 14th Regiment. Depiction of a British private and officer of the period. The British local commander, Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Bisshopp, was stationed at Chippawa, with a company of the 1st Battalion, 41st Regiment of Foot, two infantry companies of the 5th Lincoln Militia and a small detachment of Lincoln Militia Artillery. More of the 5th Lincoln Militia under Major Richard Hatt were posted nearby. In the area that would face attack on December 26, Bisshopp had several different detachments under his overall command. At Fort Erie were 80 of the 49th Regiment of Foot under Major Ormsby and 50 of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment under Captain Whelan. At Black Rock Ferry were two companies of Norfolk Militia under Captain John Bostwick. At the Red House, two-and-half miles from Fort Erie on the Chippawa Road, were 38 of the 49th Regiment under Lieutenant Thomas Lamont, some men of the Royal Regiment of Artillery under Lieutenant King, and some militia artillerymen. Lamont's battery mounted two guns: an 18-pounder and a 24-pounder; while King's battery mounted a 6-pounder and a 3-pounder. Further along the Chippawa Road, about four-and-a-half miles from Fort Erie, lay the post at Frenchman's Creek, garrisoned by 38 more men of the 49th Regiment under Lieutenant J. Bartley. Not far away were 70 of the light infantry company of the 41st Regiment under Lieutenant Angus McIntyre. Battle=King's Attack Only part of Captain King's force, including 35 of Lieutenant Angus's 70 sailors, succeeded in making a landing at the Red House. Under fire from the defenders, the invaders charged Lieutenant Lamont's detachment of the 49th Regiment. The sailors, armed with pikes and swords, closed in for hand-to-hand fighting.Cruikshank, p. 304. Lamont's troops drove back the attackers three times but King made a fourth assault which hit the British left flank and overwhelmed them; capturing Lamont and killing, taking or dispersing all of his men.James, p. 112. The victorious Americans set fire to the post, spiked the guns and set off back to the landing-point, where they expected their boats to have re-landed in order to evacuate them. However, in the moonless darkness, King's force became dispersed and split into two parties: one led by King and the other by Lieutenant Angus. Angus returned to the landing-point and found only four of the party's ten boats there. Unaware that the six missing boats had not in fact landed, Angus assumed that King had already departed, and he re-crossed the river in the remaining boats. When King's party reached the landing-point, they found themselves stranded.Cruikshank, pp. 260‚Äì261. A search downriver found two unattended British boats,Cruikshank, p. 319. in which King sent half of his men, and the prisoners that he had captured, over the Niagara while he waited with his 30 remaining men for more boats to come from Buffalo and pick him up.Quimby, p. 76. Boerstler's Attack Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler made for Frenchman's Creek but four of his eleven boats, \\"misled by the darkness of the night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return\\". Nevertheless, Boerstler's seven remaining boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier who was about to bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners.Cruikshank, p. 261. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick's two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick's force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated.James, p. 114. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman's Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John WaringHeitman, Volume I, p. 1002, for Waring's first name. to \\"break up the bridge by any means which they could find\\". Waring had torn up about a third of the planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that \\"the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them\\". Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.Cruikshank, pp. 261‚Äì262. British response In response to the attack, Major Ormsby advanced from Fort Erie to Frenchman's Creek with his 80 men of the 49th Regiment, where he was joined by Lieutenant McIntyre's 70 light infantrymen, Major Hatt's Lincoln Militia and some British-allied Native Americans under Major Givins. Finding that Boerstler's invaders had already gone, and being unable to determine any other enemy presence in the pitch dark, Ormsby's 300 men remained in position until daybreak, when Lieutenant Colonel Bisshopp arrived from Fort Erie. Bisshopp led the force to the Red House, where they found Captain King and his men still waiting to be evacuated. Outnumbered by ten-to-one, King surrendered.Cruikshank, pp. 254‚Äì255. Winder's reinforcement William Winder was dispatched to evacuate the American forces at Frenchman's Creek. When the news arrived in Buffalo that King had spiked the Red House batteries, General Smyth was overjoyed. \\"Huzza!\\" he exclaimed, \\"Canada is ours! Canada is ours! Canada is ours! This will be a glorious day for the United States!\\" and he dispatched Colonel Winder with his 350 men across the river to evacuate King and the rest of his force.Cruikshank, p. 312. Winder collected Lieutenant Waring and his partyCruikshank, p. 263. and then landed. However, he had only disembarked part of his force when Bisshopp's 300 men appeared. Winder ordered his men back to their boats and cast off for Buffalo but his command came under a severe fire as they rowed away, costing him 28 casualties. In spiking the guns at the Red House battery, the Americans had accomplished the more important of their two objectives: an invading force could now land between Chippawa and Fort Erie without facing artillery fire. However, subsequent events would render their service useless. Casualties The British official casualty return gave 15 killed, 46 wounded and 30 missing. As was often done in casualty returns with officers (but not with enlisted men), Lieutenant King of Royal Artillery and Lieutenant Lamont of the 49th were included in the \\"wounded\\" category although they were also taken prisoner. The Americans took 34 prisoners, including Lamont and King, which would indicate that two of the enlisted men who were thought to have been killed were in fact captured. This gives a revised British loss (with Lamont and King counted among the prisoners rather than the wounded) of 13 killed, 44 wounded and 34 captured. Eaton's Compilation states that Captain King's command had 8 killed and 9 wounded; that Colonel Winder's detachment had 6 killed and 22 wounded but that the losses of Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler's detachment were unknown, being \\"nowhere stated\\" in the records. The New York Gazette of December 15, 1812, reported that, of Lieutenant Angus's 35 sailors who assaulted the Red House, 28 were killed or wounded, 2 were captured and only 5 escaped unscathed. Captain King (who was slightly wounded in the foot) and 38 other prisoners were taken by the British, The British reported that King and Angus's detachment left 12 killed behind them at the Red HouseJames, p. 113. (4 of whom were presumably from Angus's naval detachment) and that 18 American dead were recovered altogether. Since only 30 prisoners had surrendered along with KingCruikshank, p. 245. and since Winder's detachment did not come under fire until they had re-embarked and cast off for Buffalo, it would appear that 6 of the dead left on the battlefield and 8 of the prisoners belonged to Boerstler's command. The known American casualties (which include the killed and captured but not the wounded in Boerstler's detachment) therefore appear to have been 24 killed, 55 wounded and 39 captured. Aftermath Following the raid, Brig Gen Alexander Smyth pressed on with plans for invasion against Upper Canada. However, the invasion failed to materialize, due to poor logistics, weather, and a drop in troop morale. With the Red House batteries out of action, Smyth immediately pressed on with his invasion plans. However, attempts to embark his 3,000 men ended in chaos; with only 1,200 men managing to board because of a shortage of boats and the artillery taking up an unexpected amount of space on board. Amid torrential rain and freezing cold, a council of war headed by Smyth decided to postpone the invasion pending more thorough preparations that would enable the embarkation of whole force.Quimby, p. 77. On November 30, Smyth tried again, ordering his men to embark two hours before dawn in order to avoid enemy fire. This time, the embarkation was so slow that, two hours after daylight, only 1,500 men were on board. Rather than attempt an amphibious landing in broad daylight, Smyth once again postponed the invasion. By this time, morale in Smyth's command had plummeted: \\"all discipline had dissolved; the camp was a bedlam\\". This, and widespread illness among the troops, persuaded a second council of war called by Smyth to suspend all offensive operations until the army was reinforced. The Army of the Centre went into winter quarters without attempting any further offensive operations and General Smyth requested leave to visit his family in Virginia. Three months later, without Smyth either resigning his commission or facing a court- martial, his name was dropped from the U.S. Army rolls by President James Madison. Unaware of the American intentions, the British and Canadians thought that King, Boerstler and Winder had been intended as the first wave of Smyth's invasion rather than as a preparatory raid. The Canadian press praised the \\"gallant achievement\\" of the defenders in apparently repulsing the Americans and singled out Bisshopp for particular congratulation.Cruikshank, pp. 279‚Äì280, quoting the Quebec Mercury of 22 December 1812 In his dispatch to Prevost, Major General Sir Roger Hale Sheaffe, the British commander in Upper Canada, wrote that \\"Lieut.-Colonel Bisshopp deserves high commendation for the spirit and activity he displayed, and great credit is due the officers and men who acted under his orders.\\"Cruikshank, p. 253 Bisshopp was killed the following summer while leading the Raid on Black Rock.Quimby, p. 302 Seven active infantry battalions of the Regular Army (1-2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1-4 Inf, 2-4 Inf, 3-4 Inf, 1-5 Inf and 2-5 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of several American infantry regiments (the old 13th, 20th and 23rd Infantry Regiments) that were at the Battle of Frenchman's Creek.

Smith played more regularly during the following season, when Preston finished third in the First Division.

Orchids in the genus Plectorrhiza are epiphytic or lithophytic herbs with short stems, long, tangled roots, short leathery leaves and small flowers on a short, thin flowering stem. Two species occur in eastern Australia and one is endemic to Lord Howe Island. Description Orchids in the genus Plectorrhiza are epiphytic or lithophytic, monopodial herbs with long, thick, tangled roots mostly growing in the air. They have two or more short, leathery leaves on each shoot. There are several small, resupinate flowers on a short, thin flowering stem. The sepals and petals are similar to and free from each other, the petals slightly shorter than the sepals. The labellum has three lobes and a backward-pointing spur with a hairy, finger- like callus. Taxonomy and naming The genus Plectorrhiza was first formally described in 1967 by Alick Dockrill and the description was published in Australasian Sarcanthinae. The three species of Plectorrhiza had previously been included in the genus Cleisostoma. Species list *Plectorrhiza brevilabris (F.Muell.) Dockrill *Plectorrhiza erecta (Fitzg.) Dockrill *Plectorrhiza tridentata (Lindl.) Dockrill Distribution and habitat All three species of Plectorrhiza grow in shady, humid forests. Plectorrhiza tridentata is the most widespread of the three, growing in eastern Queensland, New South Wales and the far north-eastern corner of Victoria.

Castellani opened his first shop in Rome in 1814. Geoffrey Munn He specialised in recreating the jewellery of ancient craftsmen, particularly the Etruscans. Castellani based many of his designs directly on archaeological evidence and often incorporated intaglios, cameos and micromosaics into his jewellery. His work became very fashionable throughout 19th century Europe and his shop was frequented by grand tourists and aristocracy. The Castellani dynasty spanned three generations, and, were also noted antiquarians.  Life  Castellani opened his first workshop in Rome in 1815. Initially, his designs reflected the fashions of the day and were generally based on French and English jewellery of the period. However, in the 1820s, Castellani began to develop the style for which he would become most famous. In collaboration with his friend and sponsor Michelangelo Caetani - later the Duke of Sermoneta and a noted archaeologist - Castellani began to draw inspiration from archaeological discoveries particularly those of the pre-Roman Estruscan culture. In 1836, archaeologists discovered the Regolini-Galassi tomb, a particularly important Estruscan find that yielded a large amount of beautifully preserved jewellery. Because of his expertise in the field and his connections with Caetani, Castellani was enlisted as an advisor on the excavation. Much of the jewellery excavated was decorated with granulation - tiny specks of gold applied to the surface. This technique was unknown to 19th century jewellers and Castellani was inspired by the discoveries to rediscover the lost art. In the 1850s, Castellani passed management of the family business to his two sons Alessandro (1824‚Äì83) and Augusto (1829‚Äì1914) in whose hands it continued to flourish. The family were keen collectors and in addition to their jewellery business they dealt and restored antiquities extensively. Castellani's main shop was immediately adjacent to the Trevi Fountain, one of Rome's most prestigious locations, and incorporated a museum of the family's collection.

Plants in this genus are epiphytes or lithophytes with thick, leathery leaves and a large number of small flowers with a three-lobed labellum. There are about twenty five species found from tropical and subtropical Asia to the south-west Pacific. Description Orchids in the genus Pomatocalpa are monopodial epiphytic or lithophytic herbs with long, thick roots attached to the substrate, with fibrous stems and long-lasting leaves arranged in two rows with their bases obscuring the stems. A large number of relatively small flowers are arranged on a panicle or raceme and with sepals and petals that are similar to each other and a labellum that has three lobes. Taxonomy and naming The genus Pomatocalpa was first formally described in 1829 by Breda in Genera et Species Orchidearum et Asclepiadearum. The type species is Pomatocalpa spicatum. The name Pomatocalpa is derived from the Ancient Greek words pomatos meaning \\"cover\\", \\"lid\\", \\"operculum\\" or \\"gill-cover\\" and kalpe meaning \\"vessel for drawing water\\", \\"pitcher\\" or \\"urn\\", referring to the deeply pouched labellum.

Claim edits compare different values on medical claim to a set of defined criteria to check for irregularities, often in an automated claims processing system. MUE are designed to limit fraud and/or coding errors. They represent an upper limit that unquestionably requires further documentation to support. The ideal MUE is the maximum unit of service for a code on the majority of medical claims. MUE is part of the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) to address coding methodologies. The NCCI policies are based on coding conventions by nationally recognized organizations and are updated annually or quarterly. History Medically Unlikely Edits began in January 2007 they are generally based on biological considerations, like number of limbs or organs. They adjudicate on units billed per line of service. The same code billed on different lines for the same date of service are subject to duplicate adjudication edits where CPT Modifiers like 59, 76 and 77 may impact the payment. The edits were not publicly released until 2009, with some of them remaining confidential out of concern for abuse . MUE are not intended to be utilization guidelines. Units less than listed may be inappropriate. It is difficult to establish to what extent private payers are using NCCI edits.

It contains two species which were previously included in the genus Lyperanthus, also known as beak orchids. Both species have fleshy, oval leaves and form colonies which flower profusely after bushfires. Description Orchids in the genus Pyrorchis are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and an oval-shaped tuber lacking a protective sheath. Replacement tubers are formed on the end of long, thin root-like stolons. There are between one and three broad, fleshy, egg-shaped to heart- shaped leaves at the base of the plant. The leaves are long, wide and bright green, sometimes with black markings. There are up to eight resupinate flowers on a stalk high. The stalk is often surrounded by two or three loose, leaf- like bracts up to long. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped, about long and forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are about the same length and the same size and shape as the petals. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum. The labellum is gently curved near its base where it encloses the base of the column but more strongly curved near its tip, which is deeply fringed. The column is about , straight or gently curved with the anther at its tip. Flowering occurs between August and early December, depending on species and the fruit that follows flowering is a non- fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing up to 500 seeds.P. nigricanslabelled image Taxonomy and naming Robert Brown first formally described Lyperanthus nigricans in 1810, publishing the description in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. In 1994, David Jones and Mark Clements described the genus Pyrorchis and included the species that Brown had described. The name \\"Pyrorchis\\" is derived from the Ancient Greek word pyr meaning \\"fire\\" and orchis meaning \\"orchid\\". There are two species: *Pyrorchis forrestii (F.Muell.) D.L.Jones & M.A.Clem. ‚Äì pink beaks (Western Australia) *Pyrorchis nigricans (R.Br.) D.L.Jones & M.A.Clem. ‚Äì red beaks, elephants' ears (N.S.W., Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and A.C.T.) Distribution and habitat Pyrorchis forrestii is only found in the south- west of Western Australia between Augusta and Waychinicup National Park where it grows near the margins of swamps or near creeks. Pyrorchis nigricans occurs much more widely, growing in N.S.W., Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and the A.C.T. in a range of moist habitats. In drier areas of Western Australia, it is usually found in moist places near granite outcrops. Ecology Both species of Pyrorchis produce small amounts of nectar and have a strong, sweet smell, especially in hot weather, suggesting pollination by bees although only P. forrestii has brightly coloured flowers. Both species flower profusely after fire, sometimes after other kinds of disturbance such as mowing, otherwise only one or two are seen after hot summer days. Conservation Both species of Pyrorchis are classified as \\"Not Threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Election result No party won a majority in the election with the council remaining under no overall control as it had been since the 1998 election. The only party to have more seats after the election than before was Labour after they gained Old Woking from the Liberal Democrats by 26 votes. Meanwhile, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats each gained one seat from the other, with the Conservatives taking Byfleet by 27 votes and the Liberal Democrats winning Brookwood by 7 votes. Overall turnout in the election was 33.66%. The failure by the Conservatives to gain the two seats they needed to have a majority on the council was described as disappointing by commentators, in a year when the party gained seats nationally.

This was the last stop of the Knoxville and Augusta line of the Southern Railway System, and the starting point for the Little River Railroad. The Inn was named by Mrs. Rachel Fisher, wife of the builder, Mr. A. J. Fisher who was also superintendent of the tannery. One year after completion, an inn was added to the structure to provide accommodations for additional guests and teachers.Tucker, M. \\"Welcome back: Chilhowee Inn reopens in Walland,\\" The Maryville-Alcoa Daily Times, July 10, 2008. The inn was used as a boarding house for teachers at the public school during the school year. The rent was paid for by the tannery. After the tannery shut down in the early 1930s, the inn became a nationally renowned lodge for people visiting the newly formed Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Excellent service and delicious meals prompted visitors to speak and write of their time spent at Chilhowee Inn. The inn appeared in many national publications of the time. After its heyday, Chilhowee Inn spent a brief time as a restaurant, serving the local community of Walland. It lay dormant for almost three decades until new owners began to restore it in 2005. Chilhowee Inn opened as a bed and breakfast in February 2008 which makes it the oldest actively operating inn in Blount County. The building was considered for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as part of a survey of historic properties in Blount County, but because of several remodelings after 1931, it was found ineligible.

It is an epiphytic or lithophytic orchid with usually only a single stem, many flat, raspy roots, between two and six leathery leaves and up to sixty pale orange flowers with red spots and blotches. The sepals and petals are narrow, thin and pointed. It mainly grows on rainforest trees and is found between the Atherton Tableland in Queensland and the Hunter River in New South Wales. Description Rhinerrhiza divitiflora is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb, usually with only a single stiff shoot long with broad, flat, raspy roots. There are between two and six leathery, dark green, narrow oblong leaves long and wide. Between six and sixty pale pale orange flowers with red spots and blotches, long and wide are borne on pendulous flowering stems long. The flowers open sporadically and in groups, the sepals and petals spreading widely apart from each other, the sepals long and wide. The petals are slightly shorter than the sepals. The labellum is about long and wide with three lobes. The side lobes are erect and the middle lobe is short and blunt with a short spur. Flowering occurs from August to November but the flowers only last for one or two days. Taxonomy and naming The raspy root orchid was first formally described in 1873 by George Bentham after an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Saccolabium divitiflorus and published the description in Flora Australiensis from a specimen collected by Robert D. FitzGerald near the Macleay River. In 1954, Herman Rupp changed the name to Rhinerrhiza divitiflora. The name Rhinerrhiza is derived from the Ancient Greek words rhine meaning \\"file\\", \\"rasp\\" or \\"shark\\" and rhiza meaning \\"root\\". The specific epithet is derived from the Latin words dives meaning \\"rich\\" or \\"wealthy\\" and flos meaning \\"flower\\". Distribution and habitat Rhinerrhiza divitiflora grows on trees in rainforest and other humid forests and sometimes on rocks.

Description It is an evergreen shrub growing to tall by wide. The foliage is pinnate, glossy dark green above, paler beneath, and sharply toothed. Each leaf usually has six to eight pairs of leaflets together with a single terminal leaflet. The plant produces new shoots regularly from the base, so it is clothed in foliage at all levels. The small, scented, yellow flowers are borne from autumn through winter into spring. The inflorescences are 25 cm or more long, at first arching and then pendant.

It served on the side of the United Kingdom in the Second Boer War and the First and Second World Wars and served the Republic of Rhodesia in the Rhodesian Bush War. During the First World War, an affiliation was formed between the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) and the Rhodesia Regiment, with a platoon of Rhodesians serving in the 2 KRRC. In addition to the similar cap badge with a red backing, the affiliation with the KRRC led to many similarities in uniform as a rifle regiment with private soldiers holding the title of \\"Rifleman\\". In 1947, as a result of its service in World War II the regiment was granted the title of Royal Rhodesia Regiment by King George VI, who became the regiment's first Colonel-in-Chief. When Rhodesia became a republic in 1970, the regiment's title reverted to Rhodesia Regiment with Queen Elizabeth II resigning her position as Colonel-in-Chief. Colonial history The Rhodesia Regiment was created in 1899 primarily from recruits from Matebeleland as a mounted infantry formation, with many coming from the Southern Rhodesian Volunteers. Their first commanding officer was Major later Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Charles Onslow Plumer who had previously commanded a Corps of Mounted Riflemen in the Second Matabele War. The Regiment served in the Second Boer War and was disbanded in 1900, shortly after the relief of Mafeking. Rhodesian volunteers leaving Salisbury for service in the Second Boer War, 1899 In the First World War the 1st Rhodesia Regiment was formed in October 1914 initially consisting of 20 officers and 500 soldiers. It was sent to the Cape where it took part in the South West Africa Campaign under General Louis Botha whilst a 2nd Rhodesia Regiment was formed in November and was sent to British East Africa. The 1st was disbanded in July 1915 with many men joining the 2nd Regiment that also included thirty African scouts. Frederick Selous (after whom the Selous Scouts were named) was present at Kilimanjaro and other actions in Tanganyika and reported in letters to friends that the Rhodesia Regiment acquitted itself very well at Taveta, though, as with other white regiments from the Empire, malaria and dysentery accounted for a very high number of casualties. Due to these casualties and the lack of replacements from the home country, where 40% of the adult white male population was on active service, the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment returned home in April 1917 and disbanded in October. The majority of the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers were themselves disbanded in 1920 for reasons of cost, the last companies being disbanded in 1926. Soldiers of the Rhodesia Regiment in Cape Town in 1914, during World War I The Defence Act of 1927 created a Permanent Force, (the Rhodesian Staff Corps) and a Territorial Force as well as national compulsory military training. With the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers disbanded in 1927, the Rhodesia Regiment was reformed in the same year as part of the nation's Territorial Force. The 1st Battalion was formed in Salisbury with a detached \\"B\\" company in Umtali and the 2nd Battalion in Bulawayo with a detached \\"B\\" Company in Gwelo. In 1929, King George V approved the transfer of the Colours of the 1st and 2nd Rhodesia Regiments of World War I, together with the Great War Honours, to the Rhodesia Regiment. The Colours are now safeguarded in the Anglican Cathedral in Salisbury. During the Second World War, conscription was introduced in 1939. The Regiment's members were absorbed into British (including the Long Range Desert Group and the KRRCKRRC ) and South African military units as it was feared the loss of the nation's manpower in one regiment would have disastrous effects on the nation. Though individual soldiers went to various regiments, the two battalions remained behind for Home Service. The regiment was initially mobilised for the Korean War in 1951 but never made it to that theatre. Territorial service in Rhodesia was four months active service for training followed by three years of part- time service. With territorial service extended to Northern Rhodesia the 3rd (Northern Rhodesia) Battalion, Royal Rhodesia Regiment was formed in 1955. This formation was different from the mixed-race active service Northern Rhodesia Regiment. After the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953 to 1963 all units received the prefix \\"Rhodesia and Nyasaland\\". National service was introduced in 1955 with the training depot being established at Llewellin Barracks near Bulawayo. With the Emergency in Nyasaland, a 4th Battalion (4RR) was formed in Manicaland in June 1959. In March 1960 the 5th, 6th, and 7th Battalions were formed as a reserve with an 8th Battalion formed on 13 February 1961. The 9th Battalion was formed in 1961 with the 10th Battalion created in 1964. The Depot Company was formed on 1 January 1964 to only be responsible for training, but when needed provide up to two extra rifle companies. Post U.D.I. Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965, the Royal Rhodesia Regiment (RRR), as it was called from 1947 until 1970, consisted of a number of territorial army battalions (1RR, 2RR, 4RR, 5RR, 6RR, 8RR, 9RR, 10RR) and 6 national service independent companies (1 Indep Coy RR, 2 Indep Coy RR, 3 Indep Coy RR, 4 Indep Coy RR, 5 Indep Coy RR and 6 Indep Coy, RR) as well as a training depot, DRR, which received and trained most of the Rhodesian Army national servicemen from the 1950s onwards. 3RR and 7RR were Northern Rhodesian (Zambia) battalions that became part of the Zambian military. After national service they were posted to a territorial battalion in or close to the town or city they hailed from. The regiment had drill halls in the larger towns of Rhodesia, where the citizen soldiers would report when mustered. During the counterinsurgency (COIN) war the battalions of the regiment identified with a brigade HQ, as for instance 2RR, 6RR and 9RR with 1 Brigade in Bulawayo, 1RR, 5RR, 8RR and 10RR with 2 Brigade in Salisbury and 4RR with 3 Brigade in Umtali. Along with regular battalions, they formed the infantry core of the brigade, to which various specialised infantry (e.g. Fireforce) and supporting service units (e.g. Armour, Signals, Engineers) were attached at the Brigade Main HQs established in operational areas. 4RR was quartered at Grand Reef aerodrome WSW of Umtali and was responsible for the Thrasher Sector stretching from Inyanga to Chipinga. At Grand Reef, 4RR Main occupied the centre of the camp, while its companies were established in temporary operational bases, usually deserted farms or schools along the sector, in the Honde and Burma Valleys to name two such camps. 4RR, like some other battalions, had a tracking unit camped on the ground at the 4RR Main HQ next to the wet canteen and the runway, many of the members of the 'Sparrows' being founder members of the Selous Scouts tracking school. When there was a contact or a sighting anywhere in the sector, the RR trackers were dropped on the spoor by an Alouette helicopter and did the dangerous work of follow-up. When or if they had run the enemy to ground, then the fireforce was called in to surround and eliminate them with superior numbers, firepower and air support. The Sparrows on the other hand, usually three or four, armed with FNs and an MAG, covered in green 'jungle juice', would frequently run down and then face an enemy force which usually outnumbered and out-gunned them. Many people in the Brigade HQ knew how busy they were kept with daily call-outs, and held them in very high regard. One such action which received publicity was the contact at Hill 31 on 15 November 1976. The Independent Companies were where conscripts ended up if they did not volunteer for more glamorous infantry or specialist units, consequently they tended to be the more conservative, long-suffering, persistent sloggers. An intake of some 300 men reporting to Depot RR would be whittled down to about 30 of these individuals, the remainder of the intake 'skiving off' to support or specialist units elsewhere in the army over the course of the first four and a half months. 1 and 4 Indeps were stationed at Victoria Falls or Wankie with 1 Indep moving to Beitbridge in late 1978, 2 Indep at Kariba, 3 Indep at Inyanga and 5 and 6 Indeps at Umtali. 1 Indep Coy formed the core of Rhodesia's fourth Fireforce unit called Fireforce Delta. For a brief time a unit of French volunteers formed 7 Indep Coy, who wore a French tricolour backing on their beret badge. The RR battalions and their national service counterparts, the Independent Companies, rarely received much attention in the media but covered most of the ground that was ever covered on aggressive foot patrols by the Rhodesian Forces. They ambushed and were ambushed. When there was trouble, as often as not, it was a Bedford lorry full of RR soldiers who were first on the scene of a massacre, a contact, or an attack. It was the ordinary citizens who recognised their contribution: as it was, the regiment was peopled by the citizens and the citizens knew it from the inside and the outside. The Regiment was honoured by being given the Freedom of Towns and Cities throughout the country. The Regiment was virtually destroyed in the last year and a half of the COIN war after being stocked by rapidly trained African volunteers and conscripts from 'civvie street'. At the same time the experienced European members, many of them family men, were emigrating to South Africa as the end drew near, so that by December 1979 the Regiment was barely recognisable for what it had once been, all through its long association with the colony and republic of Rhodesia. Morale was shattered and the Regiment, as happened to many others, disappeared when the British peacefully took over the executive powers of the country, Zimbabwe- Rhodesia, in that month. With the creation of Zimbabwe, the Rhodesia Regiment ceased by definition. Badge and uniform On the regimental badge, consisting of a dark grey to black Maltese Cross, battle honours are recorded in the four cross-members, as follows: *S.W. Africa, 1914‚Äì15 (top); *East Africa 1916‚Äì17, Beho Beho (right); *Great War, Kilimanjaro, 1914‚Äì18 (left) *Second World War (bottom). The lion and tusk of the British South Africa Company is featured above the centre of the cross, with a crown in the middle of the cross. When the regiment was a royal regiment (1947‚Äì1970), the royal crown was displayed at the top of the cross and the lion and tusk in the centre. The regimental badge had a cloth diamond shape backing split in half coloured black on the left side and rifle green on the right side with the first three battalions having vertical red stripes for the number of the battalion, one, two and three respectively. The 4th (Manicaland) Battalion (4 RR) wore a blue and white hackle, the colours of Umtali. In 1960 the diamond- shaped flash was changed to an all-red diamond, similar to the KRRC. The slouch hat was worn from the unit's formation to end of the 1960s where it was replaced by a rifle green beret. The khaki drill uniform, like that of most of the peace-time army, consisted of a heavily starched, short-sleeved light green drill shirt and similarly starched KD shorts (knee-long khaki drill short trousers), khaki woollen hose-tops and puttees, black ammo boots, a black webbing belt or regimental stable belt and a rifle green beret with the regimental badge underlain by a scarlet diamond-shaped flash. In war time, from about 1970 onwards, the everyday uniform was camouflage denim with a webbing belt and beret. The colours of the regiment were red, black and rifle green ‚Äì on the stable belt, black above, green below and a thin red stripe in the middle.

Stuart Galbraith IV writes that Tora-san's Love in Osaka is an \\"above-average entry in this consistently excellent series\\". He points out that some of the film's humor may be lost on western viewers since it stems from the contrast between Tokyo and Osaka culture. Director Yamada, according to Galbraith, \\"obviously favors rural, remote Japan to sprawling urban landscapes like Osaka,\\" but nevertheless, \\"the film plays as a heartfelt valentine to the city and its people.\\" The German-language site molodezhnaja gives Tora-san's Love in Osaka three and a half out of five stars.

It is a small epiphytic orchid with up to six crowded, linear leaves and up to ten cup- shaped, pale green flowers with purple marking and a mostly white labellum. It grows in rainforest and swampy heath in eastern Australia. Description Schistotylus purpuratus is a small epiphytic herb, usually with only a single growth. The stems are long with between two and six crowded, linear to narrow elliptic leaves long and wide. Between four and ten fragrant, cup-shaped, pale green flowers with purple blotches, long and wide are borne on a thin, arching flowering stem long. The sepals are about long and wide, the petals are slightly shorter and narrower. The labellum is white with yellow markings, about long and wide with three lobes. The side lobes have a beak-like front and the middle lobe is short and thickened with a spur long. Flowering occurs from August to October. Taxonomy and naming Purple sprites was first formally described in 1938 by Herman Rupp who originally gave it the name Cleisostoma gemmatum and published the description in The Victorian Naturalist. That name was, however a nomen illegitimum because it had been used for a different species, and Rupp changed in the name to Cleisostoma purpuratum in a later edition of the same journal. In 1941, Rupp changed the name again to Schistotylus purpuratus. The specific epithet (purpuratus) is derived from the Latin word purpura meaning \\"a purple dye\\", referring to \\"the striking reddish purple suffusion of the column. Distribution and habitat Schistotylus purpuratus grows on shrubs and the twigs of trees in forest, heath and scrub.

Plants in this genus are small epiphytes with thin roots, thin leafy stems with leaves in two ranks and tiny fragrant, almost tube-shaped flowers with a prominently spurred labellum. There are about twenty five species found from tropical and subtropical Asia to the Western Pacific. Schoenorchis seidenfadenii Description Orchids in the genus Schoenorchis are small epiphytic, monopodial herbs with thin roots, sometimes with branching stems and flat to almost cylindrical leaves with their bases sheathing the thin, fibrous stems. The flowers are small, fleshy, fragrant, often white or reddish purple and do not open widely. The sepals and petals overlap at the base so that the flowers often appear tube-shaped. The labellum is rigidly fixed to the column, usually longer than the petals and has three lobes with a spur at its base. The side lobes of the labellum are erect and the middle lobe is often spatula-shaped. Taxonomy and naming The genus Schoenorchis was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume from an unpublished description by Caspar Reinwardt and the description was published in Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi√´. The name Schoenorchis is derived from the Ancient Greek words schoinos meaning \\"sedge\\", \\"rush-rope\\" or \\"rope\\" and orchis meaning \\"testicle\\" or \\"orchid\\".

Endemic to the south-west of Western Australia, they are unusual in a number of respects; it grows in shallow soil on granite rock outcrops, grows and flowers in the hottest months of the year and has a unique method of using thynnid wasps as pollinators.  Description  Spiculaea ciliata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and an oval-shaped tuber lacking a protective sheath. The tuber produces a replacement tuber and daughter tubers on the end of short, root-like stolons. There is a single stalked leaf about long, wide at the base of the plant and purplish on the lower surface. The leaf is fully developed before the first flowers appear but withers before the first flowers open in late October. There are up to ten resupinate flowers on the end of a wiry stem high which is thickest near the top and which gradually withers from the base as the flowers mature. Each flower is straw-coloured, long and wide on a short stalk. The dorsal sepal curves over the top of the flower, with its side edges curved downwards. The two lateral sepals are shorter than the dorsal sepal and the two petals are narrower than both. The petals are sepals are separate from each other. As is usual in orchids, one petal is highly modified as the central labellum. The labellum is shaped like a wingless insect, and is attached to the base of the column by a flexible, hinge-like \\"claw\\". The labellum is much smaller than in other orchids and is rod-like, fleshy and has many club-shaped hairs. The sexual parts of the flower are fused to the column, which has wing-like structures on its sides. Flowering occurs from October to January and is followed by a fruit which is a non-fleshy, glabrous, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds.Labelled image Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley, his description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. In 1871 Heinrich Reichenbach assigned them to an extant genus, Drakaea, publishing the combination Drakaea ciliata. However, in a 1989 revision David Jones and Mark Clements, separated this population from Drakaea and other orchid genera and this reinstated Lindley's original name. The origin of the genus name, \\"Spiculaea\\", is from the Latin word spiculum meaning \\"a sharp point\\" or \\"a sting\\", probably referring to the appendge at the tip of the labellum. The specific epithet (\\"ciliata\\") is from the Latin word meaning \\"eyelash\\" or \\"eyelid\\", referring to the long hairs found on the sides of the labellum. Distribution and habitat Spiculaea ciliata grows in shallow, sandy soil over granite between the Darling Scarp, Paynes Find and Mount Ney in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. Ecology The flowers of elbow orchid have been described as \\"bizarre\\" and the production of flowers during the hottest months is unusual. One author described: \\"When most other plants dead or dying, this tiny orchid at its fascinating best. When everything else was brittle underfoot these are still succulent. A specimen continued to flower in my collection in the fridge after I got home, weeks later. (Nikulinsky)\\" Spiculaea ciliata is thought to be pollinated by a male thynnid wasp of the genus Thynnoturneria which is initially attracted to the labellum of the orchid by a pheromone, flying from downwind towards the flower. At rest, the labellum resembles a wingless female wasp, resting on a blade of grass. The insect picks up the dummy female and tries to fly off with it, rising into the column where the column wings hold the insect, and its abdomen comes into contact with the sexual parts of the flower. Conservation The species is classified as \\"Not Threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Daredevils was not popular; in his 2011 book Designers & Dragons, Shannon Appelcline said, \\"It was probably still too awkward and it was only supported with four supplements.\\" Description Daredevils was Charrette and Hume's third game following publication of Bushido and Aftermath! All three games feature similar game mechanics, although those of Daredevils are simpler than those of Aftermath! The game components are: * a sixty-four page rulebook that describes the characters' abilities, their careers, skills, movements, forms of combat (with an emphasis on firearms) and vehicles. There are chapters which give an overview of life in the 1930s; describe the creation of the game; and list the non-player characters. * a thirty-two page book entitled Adventures that contains four mini-scenarios. * a game master's screen. * a blank character sheet that can be photocopied * dice Character generation is a combination of a \\"point-buy\\" system and die rolls to generate the six abilities. Setting The original game and its four included scenarios are set in a historically accurate Earth of the 1930s and are meant to recall the adventures of pulp magazine characters such as Doc Savage, Sam Spade and The Shadow, as well as detective novels and film noir detective films of the 1930s and 1940s. The player takes the persona of a detective cum pulp fiction hero.Rowland M. The Name of the Game. White Dwarf July 1984 issue 55 p13.

Accessed 26 October 2012. Reception In the February 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue 70), Ken Ralston found the game \\"does an admirable job in covering rules many of the important features of adventuring in the modern era of technology.\\" But Ralston found reading the rules to be a slog, exacerbated by the lack of an index. \\"The style is dense and compressed, presumably because of the designer‚Äôs anxiety to include every bit of the detailed and clever rules created to handle combat, skills and tasks, character generation, and the trappings of technology.\\" Ralston also found the combat system \\"particularly bewildering... It slows the rhythm of the game and distracts from the charming atmosphere so painstakingly developed.\\" On the positive side, he found the character generation system to be \\"detailed but well organized\\", and the rules about electricity, locks and disease \\"entertaining and credible.\\" He also found \\"the suggestions for creating adventures and non-player characters are worth reading by players of any FRP game.\\" Ralston concluded, \\"Despite my reservations about the readability and complexity of the rules and procedures of Daredevils, it is the most comprehensive set of rules covering role-playing in the modern era, and shows great ingenuity in handling many gaming situations that are handled poorly or not at all by other systems. If the players avoid combat, the game plays smoothly and at a satisfying dramatic pace.\\" In the March 1983 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 61), John Rankin commented that \\"Daredevils is a most interesting and satisfying game. Unless you didn't like the Aftermath/Bushido game system, at all, you should find Daredevils a more than adequate RPG to propel you into '30s action and adventure.\\" In the December 1983 edition of Imagine (Issue 27), Paul Cockburn compared the game favorably to the earlier Gangbusters, and praised the realism of Daredevils in comparison to Call of Cthulhu. Cockburn also compared the game favorably to the adventures of Indiana Jones. The editors of Different Worlds made similar comments but criticised the rules for being too complex.Daredevils. Different Worlds March 1983 issue 27 p43. Chaosium. In the March 1984 edition of White Dwarf (Issue 51), Marcus Rowland found the character generation system complex, and combat \\"very complicated, using a lot of modifiers and intricate calculations to establish the result of each shot or blow.\\" He gave the game an above average overall rating of 8 out of 10, saying, \\"The rules system is slightly top-heavy, and I suspect many referees will simplify or abandon some of the more awkward areas... I'd not recommend the system to beginners, but more experienced referees won't have much trouble using it. In the pages of his 1987 book, Role-Playing Mastery, Dungeons & Dragons co-creator E. Gary Gygax mentions Daredevils and Bushido in his short list of notable role playing games.

Extending the Cure is funded in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through its Pioneer Portfolio, which supports innovative projects that may lead to breakthrough improvements in health and health care.Extending the Cure. What We Do Accessed: 01/21/2010 Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership The Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership (GARP) was started in 2009 to create a platform for developing actionable policy proposals on antibiotic resistance in low-income and middle-income countries. During the first three years, Phase 1 of GARP established national working groups in four countries: India, Kenya, South Africa and Vietnam. Those working groups‚Äîmultidisciplinary, with representatives from all sectors, dealing with both human and animal antibiotic use‚Äîhave become national resources for their expertise and linkages to the current global activities in antibiotic resistance. GARP Phase 1 culminated in the 1st Global Forum on Bacterial Infections: Balancing Treatment Access and Antibiotic Resistance on October 3‚Äì5, 2011, in New Delhi, India. Since GARP Phase 2 began in 2012, national working groups have been established in Mozambique, Nepal, Tanzania and Uganda. The GARP secretariat at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP), in Washington, DC and New Delhi, provides technical support to each working group, creates links within the GARP network and involves the working groups in global discussions and policy development. GARP is a CDDEP project, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Affordable Medicines Facility--Malaria The Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm) is an innovative financing mechanism designed to expand access to the most effective treatment for malaria, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) through the public, private and NGO sectors. It will reduce the use of drugs that no longer work because of drug resistance, and reduce the use of artemisinin by itself, as monotherapy, thereby delaying the onset of resistance to that drug and preserving its effectiveness. AMFm is being managed by the Global Fund with directed financing from UNITAID, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), and other donors. CDDEP researchers have been involved with the global subsidy idea behind AMFm since 2002, when the U.S. Institute of Medicine committee first deliberated on the questions of how to expand access to ACTs while maintaining the effectiveness of artemisinin compounds.Affordable Medicines Facility--malaria Accessed 10/20/2010 Disease Control Priorities Project A joint effort of The World Bank, the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health, and the World Health Organization, with substantial technical input from CDDEP researchers, DCPP was launched in 2001 as a four-year initiative to improve the health of people in developing countries by identifying disease control priorities based on scientific evidence and cost-effectiveness. Researchers at CDDEP were involved in carrying out the economic analysis for a number of chapters as well as in writing the cross-cutting chapter summarizing the main economic messages of the project, as well as the Lancet paper summarizing the main messages of the project. CDDEP researchers also co-led DCPP in India. That effort resulted in a book, ‚ÄúChoosing Health: An Entitlement for All Indians.‚ÄùChoosing Health: An Entitlement for All Indians May 2009 The overarching paradigm for DCPP is of quantitative evaluation of health system interventions and prioritizing interventions on the basis of cost-effectiveness. Malaria Atlas Project--Elimination A complement to the Malaria Atlas Project, this research seeks to develop an improved bio- economic model for trans-boundary malaria control financing that considers imported malaria. Research couples economic models to the stochastic spatial models largely based on malaria transmission intensity data assembled by the Malaria Atlas Project. Research includes modeling vectors and malaria transmission to develop the further spatial components. The end product of this effort will be the development of a tool for making estimates of malaria transmission intensity and burden as a function of financing strategies.Strategic Planning Tools for Spatially Progressive Malaria Elimination. Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy 01/21/2010 Golden Mustard CDDEP‚Äôs Golden Mustard project, funded by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia, examines the potential impact of biofortification of mustard in India. The Indian context presents specific challenges: widely dispersed food production systems and sporadic health center access have hampered interventions to distribute vitamin A supplements, industrially fortified foods, or biofortified seed products in the past. CDDEP‚Äôs Golden Mustard project looks at how mustard biofortification could be an advantageous addition to a portfolio of strategies to alleviate Vitamin A deficiency in this context. Multiple First-line Therapies If two drugs (in combination) are good, are three or more being used concurrently by different patients better at keeping drug resistance at bay? The question has practical consequences, as nearly every malaria-endemic country adopts a single first-line treatment (now, a combination drug) as policy. National policies are difficult to change and to implement in these relatively poor countries, and good evidence would be needed to adopt a more complex approach. CDDEP researchers began investigating MFT in 2006 using an evolutionary-epidemiological modeling framework. They compared MFT with single combination drugs and with cycling strategies where therapies are rotated, either on a fixed cycling schedule or when resistance levels or treatment failure become too high. Compared with these alternatives, the analysis predicts that MFT strategies will delay the emergence and slow the fixation of resistant strains. Notable Work The Center for Global Development describes CDDEP as a complement to \\"the CDC, WHO, and other agencies who fulfill basic surveillance and public health roles, but can‚Äôt give us much (if any) insight into the economic consequences of pandemic flu and other health disasters, nor can they use this insight to promote needed policy reform in the U.S. and globally.\\"Nugent, Rachel. A New Center on Disease Outbreaks Global Health Policy 10/01/2009 Accessed: 01/21/2010 Extending the Cure‚Äôs inaugural report Extending the Cure: Policy Responses to the Growing Threat of Antibiotic Resistance, has been widely debated at a series of consultations with representatives from the medical, insurance, pharmaceutical, government, and academic communities. It set the stage for continued research in the form of technical papers and policy briefs to prevent the impending health crisis of widespread antibiotic resistance. ETC received national media attention for its study on the costs of Hospital- Acquired Infections, including coverage by NPR, ABC, CNN, and Reuters.Extending the Cure Blog Post 2/24/2010 Published in Archives of Internal Medicine, the study demonstrated that two conditions caused by HAIs killed 48,000 people and ramped up health care costs by $8.1 billion in 2006 alone. The 2010 ETC-sponsored paper Fighting Antibiotic Resistance: Marrying New Financial Incentives to Meeting Public Health Goalswas cited by the Guardian as ‚Äúa radical plan to save antibiotics.‚Äù The study, published in Health Affairs, examined novel strategies for conserving antibiotics while also encouraging new drug development. ETC research featured in the CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases also received widespread national media coverage. The study found the community-associated strain of the deadly superbug MRSA‚Äîan infection-causing bacteria resistant to most common antibiotics‚Äîposes a far greater health threat than previously known and is making its way into hospitals. The new threat is easily picked up in fitness centers, schools, and other public places and has increased the overall burden of MRSA within hospitals. The study analyzed data from more than 300 microbiology labs serving hospitals all over the United States, found a seven-fold increase in the proportion of \\"community-associated\\" strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, in outpatient hospital units between 1999 and 2006. Former CDDEP Senior Fellow David L. Smith‚Äôs 2010 study in Nature, \\"Climate Change and the Global Malaria Recession\\", rebuked the widespread claim that climate change will be linked to increasing malaria incidence. CDDEP researchers are contributing to the Lancet Series on Malaria Elimination as well as to the 5th report in Roll Back Malaria‚Äôs Progress & Impact Series.Progress & Impact Series Roll Back Malaria Partnership Accessed 10/20/2010 CDDEP is known as a pioneer in researching Multiple First-line Therapies as a means of slowing the spread of drug resistance to antimalarials. Key Researchers Ramanan Laxminarayan is director and senior fellow at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy. He is also a visiting scholar and lecturer at Princeton University. His research deals with the integration of epidemiological models of infectious diseases and drug resistance into the economic analysis of public health problems. He has worked to improve understanding of drug resistance as a problem of managing a shared global resource. Laxminarayan has worked with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank on evaluating malaria treatment policy, vaccination strategies, the economic burden of tuberculosis, and control of non- communicable diseases. He has served on a number of advisory committees at WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the [Institute of Medicine]. In 2003-04, he served on the National Academy of Science/Institute of Medicine Committee on the Economics of Antimalarial Drugs and subsequently helped create the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm), a novel financing mechanism for antimalarials. Laxminarayan received his undergraduate degree in engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in Pilani, India, and his master's degree in public health (Epidemiology) and doctorate in economics from the University of Washington in Seattle. Hellen Gelband focuses on health policy issues in the United States and internationally. During her career, she has used the evaluation of medical evidence to inform a wide range of both American and global health policies. Her work at CDDEP explores the growing resistance to antibiotic and anti- malarial drugs, as well as access to and cost of such pharmaceuticals. She is the coordinator of the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership (GARP) ‚Äì a project that has established centers in five developing countries to foster rational policies governing the use of antibiotics. Gelband spent 15 years at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment and ten years at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. She has also worked for the World Health Organization, the University of Oxford, Doctors without Borders, and a number of foreign governments and U.S.-based consulting companies.

She was born at Castelleone near Cremona, and also later died there. Killing a cremonese courtier The anecdote for which she is best known was first described in 1590 by Conrado Flameno in his Storia di Castelleone (History of Castelleone). According to him, she was commissioned by Cabrino Fondolo, tyrant of the town of Cremona, to decorate his palace with paintings; it is the only record of a commission given to a woman in the Quattrocento.Greer, p. 172 While she was painting a fresco, which was her speciality, a young courtier was indecent towards her. She killed him with a knife and fled \\"disguised as a man\\". Flameno quotes her as saying: Life as a soldier The 1590 Storia di Castelleone goes on to say that Onorata Rodiani, while tried and pardoned by Cabrino Fondolo, entered the service of Oldrado Lampugnano, a condottiere (mercenary commander), as a cavalryman in 1423. Flameno says that she did this \\"unknown to all\\", and then lived \\"with her name and her clothing changed\\", suggesting her as an example of crossdressing during wartime. She then served with several captains, including Conrado Sforza, brother of duke Francesco Sforza. While under his command, in 1452, she supposedly came to the aid of her hometown of Castelleone, besieged by the republic of Venice. The siege was raised but she was mortally wounded, carried into the town, and there, after being \\"recognized with great amazement\\", she died. Flameno concludes this episode with another quote from Onorata : Historicity As stated before, the historicity of Onorata Rodiani is unsure. Conrado Flameno, in both quotes he attributes to Onorata, puns on her name : Onorata means \\"honoured\\" in Italian, and Onorata, in both cases, speaks about \\"living honoured\\". According to Flameno, she was buried in the parish church of Castelleone, but a new parish church was built in Castelleone in the 16th century, and no trace of her tomb was found. Her legend is nevertheless alive in Castelleone, and two unfinished wall-paintings in the palazzo Galeotti-Vertua, thought to be the palace where Gabrino Fondolo resided, are sometimes attributed to her. There are several versions regarding the works that Onorata was painting before having to flee. A 19th century version of her life states that she was painting in tempera on dry plaster, which would explain that none of her works survived to be attributed to her beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if she truly did paint affresco, it would mean a long training to master this difficult technique -- \\"a circumstance even more remarkable, in those days when women were comparatively often to be seen in command of troops, than her serving under the condotierri\\". The name of another woman, Caterina dei Vigri, who was eventually canonized, appears on a tempera painting from 1456, and it was reported by her biographer and friend that Caterina dei Vigri did indeed paint, notably miniatures. Paintings by Caterina have recently been discovered. As to Onorata's service as a soldier, the dates given by Conrado Flameno are coherent with what is known of military events in 15th century Italy. This could either mean there is some truth in Flameno's account, or that he took care to frame Onorata's myth into what he knew had happened more than a century before his own time. In popular culture The figure of Onorata appears in the novel Ash: A Secret History by Mary Gentle, in which her episode with the Cremonese courtier is suggested to be propaganda, but she does command a mercenary company in the novel, and meets with her counterpart and main character, Ash.Gentle, Mary.

The building, which stands on a corner site at the point where the town's ancient High Street meets the commercial developments of the postwar New Town, has been altered and extended several times; but at its centre is a 15th-century timber-framed open hall-house of a type common in the Crawley area in the Middle Ages. Few now survive, and the Brewery Shades has been protected as a Grade II listed building. History Crawley was granted a charter for a weekly market in 1202. Thereafter, what had been a village, on the London‚ÄìBrighton road halfway between the two places, slowly grew into a market town and a centre for agriculture and ironworking. As the area became more prosperous, several timber-framed open hall-houses were built on both sides of the High Street (the name given to the part of the London‚ÄìBrighton Road running through the town centre). These \\"Wealden hall-houses\\"‚Äîthe design of which allowed smoke from open fires to rise through the hall and disperse readily‚Äîwere common in the Weald of Kent and Sussex, and five have been documented in Crawley. One such building was the Shades (perhaps its original name), which was built in the 15th century. Estimates of the date range from \\"1450 or a little earlier\\" to 1500. After chimneys were invented, the open hall-house design fell out of favour, and many such buildings had chimneys and fireplaces inserted. This happened at the Brewery Shades in the 17th century. At the same time, another storey was added internally and the fa√ßade was given two gable ends. Further changes were made over the next two centuries, such that the external appearance of the building was completely changed. The ground floor was affected most by the alterations. Crawley was designated a New Town in the 1940s, and a new shopping area was built east of the High Street. One of the first projects was the creation of a pedestrian precinct, Broadwalk, between the main square (Queen's Square) and the High Street immediately south of the Brewery Shades. This opened in 1954, and the inn now occupied a prominent corner position. Buildings demolished to make way for this pedestrian link included Crawley's former post office and a blacksmith's forge. The inn had subterranean passages leading to the George Hotel opposite, and cells where prisoners would be kept before being hanged at the gallows which stood outside the George for several centuries. The cells and passageways were not built at the same time as the inn, but were added soon afterwards. Reputed hauntings are a common feature of Sussex inns, and a wide variety of alleged paranormal activities at the Brewery Shades have been documented: a woman and child (a boy) associated in particular with one room in which a bed was once found alight for no reason; a doorbell ringing by itself during the night; and a man haunting the ladies' toilet. Historically, the word \\"shade\\" meant \\"ghost\\"‚Äîa possible explanation for the inn's name. The Brewery Shades was designated a Grade II Listed building on 21 June 1948. Architecture Although the medieval origins are now obscured behind a modern fa√ßade, substantial parts of the timber-framed original open hall-house layout remain inside. The oldest part of the building is the north‚Äìsouth range, parallel to the High Street. This has a gigantic tie-beam holding up a king post ceiling. The king post's structure includes purlins, chamfers and decorative mouldings. This fa√ßade has three modern gable ends and a tiled upper storey. Around the corner, facing Broadwalk, there is a twin-gabled modern fa√ßade, again with a tile-hung first floor and a stucco-faced ground floor. This part is a modern extension. At the northern end, there is another original wing running west to east: it has substantial timberwork with chamfering, visible from one of the bars.

Fictional character biographies=Tiger Shark I The first Tiger Shark appeared in Military Comics #9 (May 1942), a Quality Comics publication (years before that company was purchased by DC Comics) in a Blackhawk story set in World War II. The character was more specifically called Lt. Tiger Shark, who is the skipper of the US vessel called the Phantom Clipper.Military Comics #9 Tiger Shark II The second Tiger Shark is Dr. Gaige, who first appeared in Detective Comics #147 (May 1949). He was a famed oceanographer known for many discoveries in his field. It was his boredom and greed that led him to a life of crime. Donning a striped orange diving costume complete with a helmet and tiger stripes, Gaige adopted a secret identity as the Tiger Shark. Recruiting a dockside gang of criminals to do his bidding, Tiger Shark led his gang of thugs to an undersea headquarters in a sunken ship 200 miles from shore. Tiger Shark became a brilliant criminal mastermind plotting a series of spectacular crime sprees at sea and Gotham City's waterfront. In May 1949, Batman and Robin took an interest in Tiger Shark's crime spree and used the \\"sub- batmarine\\" to help them apprehend Tiger Shark. The devices on the sub- batmarine were successful at apprehending Tiger Shark. Ironically, the \\"sub- batmarine\\" that Batman and Robin used to captured Tiger Shark had been designed especially for their use by Dr. Gaige himself, much to the surprise of both parties after Tiger Shark was unmasked by Batman and his true identity exposed.Detective Comics #147 Tiger Shark III A new Tiger Shark appears in the \\"Hungry City\\" story in Detective Comics #878 (Aug. 2011). This version, created for DC Comics by writer Scott Snyder and artist Jock, is a murderous pirate who tried to invest \\"dirty money\\" in the GGM Bank (which was owned by Tony Zucco's daughter Sonia Zucco). One day, the corpse of a killer whale was found in the lobby of the GGM Bank. When Batman meets up with Commissioner Gordon to talk with Sonia Zucco, she says that one of her tellers was found dead in the killer whale. Commissioner Gordon suspects that someone is intimidating Sonia Zucco into opening her bank to a criminal element. When Batman takes down the gun-running criminal Roadrunner and wanted to know who tipped him off, he learns from Roadrunner that the person who tipped him off was a woman who worked for Tiger Shark. When Roadrunner is brought to Gotham City Police Department, he makes a deal for a reduced sentence to District Attorney Spencer that Tiger Shark is planning to leave town with several rare animals to sell over the black market. Batman and Robin stake out and find Tiger Shark's yacht where Commissioner Gordon tells him that Roadrunner was right about Tiger Shark smuggling rare animals where it turns out that Tiger Shark had stolen some exotic birds from the Gotham City Aviary. Batman and Robin board Tiger Shark's yacht where they ended up fighting Tiger Shark's men. Tiger Shark knocks Batman into the yacht's pool which contained a crazed killer whale. Robin defeats Tiger Shark's men and makes his way to the pool where he uses Killer Whale Repellent on Batman to keep the killer whale away, but Tiger Shark had already gotten away in his submarine and had activated a bomb to detonate the yacht. The Dynamic Duo rescued the animals and released the killer whale into the ocean before the yacht exploded.Detective Comics #878 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the third version of Tiger Shark is reintroduced in Batman Vol. 2 #12 (Oct. 2012), where he fights with Batman aboard his yacht. Batman defeats Tiger Shark and demands to know how Talon got into Wayne Towers on the east side (which was Tiger Shark's domain). Tiger Shark declines answering and unleashes a tiger on him. The battle is interrupted by Harper Row who runs Tiger Shark's yacht into the shore. Batman then defeats Tiger Shark.Batman Vol. 2 #12 Powers and abilities The second Tiger Shark was a brilliant criminal mastermind able to plan spectacular crimes at sea and on Gotham's coast. He possessed an array of underwater-use weapons. Tiger Shark also almost always carried a handgun. Also, Tiger Shark and his henchmen used special jet water skis that enable them to maneuver on and under water. In other media * The second Tiger Shark appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Legends of the Dark Mite\\". He is among the Batman villains in Bat-Mite's illusions. He chases after Bat-Mite when he lands in the water. In \\"A Bat Divided\\", he was seen in a bar where the bad guys hang out upon the arrival of Firestorm and the three Batmen.

This may be done to prevent the spread of smoke from the space of fire origin to other spaces in the same building. A combination of fans and dampers can exhaust smoke from an area while pressurizing the smoke-free areas around the affected area (inhibiting smoke infiltration into additional areas). It may also be used to maintain the required concentration of a fire suppression clean agent in a space, as installed in supply air ducts to restrict the introduction of air into the space, and as installed in return or exhaust air ducts to restrict the depletion of the clean agent from the space. Smoke dampers are usually installed by sheet metal contractors. Smoke dampers can be activated by the fire alarm system, usually initiated by smoke detectors, or interlocked with a fire suppression system. Smoke dampers close by an electric or pneumatic actuator, or a spring actuator, and can be either manually reset or driven open on a reset signal to the electric or pneumatic actuator. Combination fire/smoke dampers are also available if a smoke barrier is desired at the same location as a fire barrier.

Inspection and maintenance As with any other element of a building's passive fire protection system, smoke dampers need to be maintained, inspected and repaired to ensure they are in working order. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requires the testing, maintenance and repair of smoke dampers as mandated in the Life Safety Code. NFPA 105 states [that] each damper shall be tested and inspected one year after installation. The test and inspection frequency shall then be every 4 years, except in hospitals, where the frequency shall be every 6 years. The code also states that the damper shall be actuated and cycled. The inspections must be document indicating the location of the damper, date of inspection, name of inspector, and deficiencies discovered.NFPA 105-7, 6.5 As with fire damper inspections, smoke damper inspections are required by Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ's). The International Code Council, the Joint Commission, NFPA and State Fire Marshals require these inspections as part of a Building's Life Safety Plan. Repair  NFPA 105 requires that \\"if a damper is not operable, repairs shall begin as soon as possible\\".NFPA 105-7 6.6.3 The repair of smoke dampers is more complicated as compared to fire dampers due to actuator replacement.

His brother, artist Robert Colescott, was born in 1925. Creole culture‚Äîwhich the artist described as \\"a rich tradition of cuisine and music, of skeptical judgments, of irony and humor in expression\\"Mary Weaver Chapin, The Prints of Warrington Colescott: A Catalogue Raisonn√©, 1948‚Äì2008.

Comic strips were also important to the young Colescott, especially the work of Jay \\"Ding\\" Darling; the caricatural and narrative components would greatly influence his mature work.Chapin, p. 3 As a teenager, Colescott discovered vaudeville and the burlesque at the Red Mill/Moulin Rouge theater on 8th Street in Oakland. The broad humor and slapstick, as well as the eroticism of the burlesque performances, would inform his art and humor throughout his career.Chapin, p. 4.

Madison: Elvehjem Museum of Art, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, 1989, p. 4.  Education  Colescott earned his undergraduate degree at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in the summer of 1942. At Berkeley, he majored in fine art, and was active with the university humor magazine, the Pelican, as well as the university newspaper, The Daily Californian, submitting cartoons and writing for both publications. He served in the army in World War II from 1942 to 1946, then returned to Berkeley to take a master's degree in fine arts and to earn a teaching certificate. Colescott taught art at Long Beach City College from 1947 to 1949. In September 1949, he began his career at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he taught for 37 years, retiring in 1986. During those years, Colescott continued his education in Europe, first on the GI Bill to study at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, Paris, in 1952‚Äì53 and again on several fellowships and awards: in 1956‚Äì57, he was a Fulbright Fellow at the Slade School of Fine Art, University of London, and in 1963, he returned to London on a Guggenheim Fellowship.  Mature work  Colescott had studied painting at the University of California, Berkeley, and only began to make screenprints in 1948 while he was teaching at Long Beach City College. He continued to paint, draw, and make screenprints when he moved to Madison to teach drawing and design at the University of Wisconsin. The art faculty at Madison included several members who were both painters and printmakers, including Dean Meeker, Alfred Sessler, and John Wilde.See Chapin, p. 9. Sessler introduced Colescott to etching in the mid-1950s, and Colescott furthered his education in the medium at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, studying with Anthony Gross. During that time, Colescott experimented with hard-ground etching while continuing his screenprinting; in a few instances, he combined the two media, as in Night Wings from 1957. By the early 1960s, Colescott had all but abandoned screenprinting, devoting his time, rather, to complex etchings in color. He achieved a major breakthrough in his work when he began to cut and shape the copper etching plates with mechanics' shears.See Chapin, p. 28 In addition, he started incorporating bits of letterpress (typically zinc letterpress used for newspaper printing) and recycled etching plates into his compositions.Chapin, p. 29.

At the same time, his work became less abstract and more narrative in nature, which allowed him to unleash his satirical talents in work such as In Birmingham Jail (1963), which is based on the civil rights struggles in the South, and lambastes the racism and violence of a corrupt system;Chapin, p. 29 or Christmas with Ziggy (1964), a social satire of businessmen entertaining their mistresses at a posh London restaurant.Chapin, p. 118 That same year, Colescott began an etching about the Depression-era gangster, John Dillinger, which grew into a suite of images mixing fact and fiction about the farm boy- turned-outlaw who mesmerized the public in the 1930s. \\"A storyteller who skips all the dull parts,\\" as author and curator Gene Baro has called him, Colescott had no compunction about enhancing the narratives with imagined details and anachronistic additions.Gene Baro, \\"From a Conversation: Warrington Colescott and Gene Baro\\" in A History of Printmaking: A Traveling Exhibition of the Madison Art Center, June 15 ‚Äì July 29, 1979 (Madison, Wis.: Madison Art Center, 1979), n.p. Colescott's mature style found fruition in his series Prime-Time Histories: Colescott's USA (1972‚Äì73) followed by The History of Printmaking (1975‚Äì78), perhaps Colescott's best-known work. In this suite of images, which includes twenty-one intaglio prints, two lithographs, and a handful of watercolors and drawings, Colescott imagines critical moments in the history of printmaking. In each print, Colescott starts with historical fact, and then adds his own interpretation, often borrowing from the featured artist's own style or themes.Cox, pp. 15‚Äì16 For instance, in one scene we witness Alois Senefelder, the inventor of lithography, receiving the secrets of this medium from devilish creatures in the Black Forest; in another plate, Colescott imagines Pablo Picasso at the zoo, admiring animals such as the minotaur that recurs in his work. For his riff on Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Colescott imagines the fin-de-si√®cle artist (and enthusiastic chef) in his kitchen, whipping up a lunch for his friends, characters from Lautrec's oeuvre. In 1992, he returned again to an art-historical theme in My German Trip, in which Colescott imagines encounters with the great German printmakers Albrecht D√ºrer, K√§the Kollwitz, Otto Dix, George Grosz, and members of the German Expressionists, with highly comic results.See Colescott's article about the genesis of this series, \\"Galleria: My German Trip.\\" Wisconsin Academy Review 39, no. 2 (1993): 10‚Äì13. More satires and fictional histories have followed. Since the 1970s, Colescott has continued to pursue social satire in his work. As art historian Richard Cox has written, Colescott casts his net wide: \\"Greed vanity, pride, lust, social ambition, silly fads, and fashions‚Äî[Colescott] adapted the traditional targets of artists and writers as his own. With wit and disarming humor he has drawn many entertaining and zany prints, everything from good-natured spoofs to harsh, stinging parodies. Greek gods, American presidents, newspaper tycoons, academics, gangsters, cops, cowboys and Indians, Pilgrims, accountants, scientists, generals, joggers, hunters, show girls, movie stars, the artist himself‚Äîyou name it, all have been skewered by Colescott's needle.\\"Richard Cox, \\"Warrington Colescott\\" in Warrington Colescott: Forty Years of Printmaking: A Retrospective, 1948‚Äì1988. Madison: Elvehjem Museum of Art, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, 1989, p. 3. Recurrent themes since the late 1980s show a different focus. These include burlesque, popular culture, and the afterlife (see The Last Judgement triptych, 1987‚Äì88). The artist also focuses on some of his favorite locales, such as California (his birthplace), Wisconsin (where he resides), and New Orleans, the home of his Creole ancestors, as seen in his recent series, Suite Louisiana. Colescott has turned his attention to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in prints including Imperium: Royal Lancers Attack Wog Armor‚ÄîHeartland Saved (2005) and Imperium: Down in the Green Zone (2006).  Collections  Colescott's work is in museum collections across the United States and Europe, including the Art Institute of Chicago, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, National Gallery of Art, New York Public Library, Victoria and Albert Museum, Tate, Columbus Museum of Art, and the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, among others. In his home state of Wisconsin, numerous institutions hold his work; these include the Chazen Museum of Art in Madison, the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Wisconsin Art in West Bend, the Racine Art Museum, and the Milwaukee Art Museum, which has the largest collection of his work in the world, numbering more than 250 prints, drawings, and paintings.  Exhibitions and publications  Colescott has exhibited in numerous group exhibitions and one-man shows. Among the most important are the exhibition A History of Printmaking originated by the Madison Art Center in 1979, which traveled to many subsequent venues; the retrospective at the Elvehjem Museum of Art (now known as the Chazen Museum of Art) at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1988‚Äì89, which was accompanied by the publication Warrington Colescott: Forty Years of Printmaking, A Retrospective, 1948‚Äì1988worldcat record #19887307 and a retrospective at the Milwaukee Art Museum in 1995, which published a small catalogue Warrington Colescott.worldcat record #35671261 A major retrospective of Colescott's graphic oeuvre will be presented at the Milwaukee Art Museum June 10 ‚Äì September 26, 2010. A full catalogue raisonn√© of Colescott's graphic works co-published by the Milwaukee Art Museum and the University of Wisconsin Press accompanies the exhibition. Read more about the catalogue or purchase it from the University of Wisconsin Press or the Milwaukee Art Museum Store.  Critical reception  Colescott first gained critical notice in the 1950s, when he was included in the Young American Printmakers exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1953, and in shows at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1955 and 1956.Chapin, p. 11 He exhibited frequently throughout the subsequent decades and was honored with numerous grants, fellowships, and awards (see below). Critics liken Colescott's work to his contemporaries as well as historic antecedents; as art critic Mario Naves has summarized, \\"Mr. Colescott is not a satirist, cartoonist or Red Grooms, though he resembles each. (‚Ä¶) He's a mischievous humanist with a bottomless appreciation for the absurdities of life and‚Ä¶the afterlife. He's as many-sided and unsentimental as Twain, Hogarth or Bosch.\\"Mario Naves, \\"Surely He Jests,\\" The New York Observer, March 26, 2006 This has earned him the nickname \\"the modern Hogarth.\\" Others have compared his graphic style, as well as his mixture of satire and humanism, to artists of preceding generations, such as Francisco Goya, Honor√© Daumier, Max Beckmann, and George Grosz.Cox, p. 3 \\"Imagine a lumpish amalgamation of Saul Steinberg and George Grosz, leavened with Red Grooms and peppered with Mel Brooks, and you will have some idea of the erudite slapstick Mr. Colescott engages in.\\"Mario Naves, The New York Observer, September 12, 2004.  Honors  Colescott has been recognized by several major honors and fellowships. These include a Fulbright Fellowship to England in 1957, a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in 1965, and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1979 and 1983. He is a Fellow of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters, and was named an Academician of the National Academy of Design in 1992.

This was one of the first major sabotage acts in Axis-occupied Europe, and the beginning of a permanent British involvement with the Greek Resistance.  Background  Operation Harling was conceived in late summer 1942 as an effort to stem the flow of supplies through Greece to the German forces under Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in North Africa. To this end, the Cairo office of the SOE decided to send a sabotage team to cut the railway line connecting Athens with Thessaloniki.Clogg (1986), pp. 142‚Äì143Papastratis (1984), p. 129 Three viaducts were targeted, all in the Brallos area: the Gorgopotamos, Asopos and Papadia bridges. The destruction of the Asopos viaduct was preferable, since it would take longer to rebuild, but the choice would be ultimately left to the mission's leader.McGlynn (1953), pp. 3‚Äì4 The team would be under the command of Lieutenant Colonel (later brevetted to Brigadier) E. C. W. \\"Eddie\\" Myers of the Royal Engineers, \\"the only parachute- trained professional sapper officer in the Middle East\\", according to his second-in-command, Major (later brevetted to Colonel) Chris Woodhouse. After completion of the mission, the British team would be evacuated, leaving only Woodhouse, the Greek 2nd Lieutenant Themis Marinos and two radio operators to establish a liaison with the fledgling Greek Resistance movement.Woodhouse (2002), p. xi In Greece meanwhile, the first attempts at armed resistance in Greek Macedonia were quelled in the summer of 1941 by the Germans and Bulgarians. The spring and summer of 1942 however saw the birth of the first armed guerrilla units in the mountainous interior of Central Greece and Epirus. From the beginning, the largest among them was the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), founded by the Communist-led National Liberation Front (EAM) and headed by Aris Velouchiotis. The second largest were the forces of the National Republican Greek League (EDES), headed by Colonel Napoleon Zervas.Woodhouse (2002), p. xiiClogg (1986), pp. 140‚Äì141 The Harling mission's British officers were largely ignorant of the realities on the ground in occupied Greece, or of the precise nature, let alone the strength and political affiliation of the emerging resistance groups.Clogg (1986), p. 143  The mission = Landing in Greece, contacting the Resistance  The SOE team numbered thirteen men and was divided into three groups, each including a leader, an interpreter, a sapper and a radio operator. The first group was composed of Lt. Colonel Eddie Myers, CO of the mission and group leader, Captain Denys Hamson as interpreter, Captain Tom Barnes (a New Zealander) as the sapper and Sergeants Len Willmott and Frank Hernen as wireless operators. The second group consisted of Maj. Chris Woodhouse, 2nd Lieutenant Themis Marinos (a Greek), Lieutenant Inder Gill (of mixed Scottish and Sikh descent who later became a Lieutenant General in the Indian Army) and Sergeant Doug Phillips. The third group consisted of Major John Cooke, Captain Nat Barker, Captain Arthur Edmonds (a New Zealander) and Sergeant Mike Chittis.McGlynn (1953), p. 4Howarth (1980), p. 98 The team was distributed per group to three B-24 Liberator aircraft. A first attempt to drop them over Greece on 28 September failed, as the pre-arranged signal fires had not been lit. During the next flight on 30 September, the fires were located, and the Harling team was dropped near Mount Giona in Central Greece.McGlynn (1953), pp. 4‚Äì5Howarth (1980), pp. 98‚Äì99 The third plane was unable to locate any fires, and Major Cooke's group jumped near the heavily garrisoned town of Karpenissi. One group member even landed inside the town itself, and was hidden by local Greeks. Evading the Italian troops searching for them, they made for the hills, where they came upon the guerrillas of Aris Velouchiotis.McGlynn (1953), p. 9 In the meantime, the main group was being hidden by the local Greeks and constantly moved around the area to prevent their capture by Italian searching parties, while Woodhouse set out to the town of Amfissa to establish contact with Cairo.McGlynn (1953), pp. 5‚Äì7 During this time, Myers and Hamson, led by a local Greek guide, Yiannis, undertook a reconnaissance of the three prospective targets, and chose Gorgopotamos, which afforded better prospects of success: its garrison of 80 Italians was small enough, and it offered good access, cover and a line of retreat for the attacking force.McGlynn (1953), pp. 7‚Äì8 On 2 November, Woodhouse set out to establish contact with Zervas' men in the Valtos Mountains region, while on 14 November, Major Cooke's team rejoined the main party, with information that they had made contact with Aris. Woodhouse returned on the same day, with Zervas and 45 of his men.McGlynn (1953), pp. 8‚Äì9 From the outset, Zervas was enthusiastic for the mission, but Velouchiotis less so, for the Athens-based leadership of EAM-ELAS still did not appreciate the importance and potential of armed struggle in the countryside, preferring to focus on the cities instead. In the end, Velouchiotis, on his own initiative and contrary to the instructions received from EAM, decided to participate in the operation.Woodhouse (2002), p. 33  The sabotage  Guerillas of ELAS The force available for the operation numbered 150 men: the twelve-strong British team, which would form the demolition party, 86 ELAS men and 52 EDES men, who would provide cover and neutralize the garrison. According to the plan, the attack was to take place on 23:00 on 25 November. Two teams of eight guerrillas were to cut the railway and telephone lines in both directions, as well as cover the approaches to the bridge itself, while the main force of 100 guerrillas was to neutralize the garrison. The demolition party, divided into three teams, would wait upriver until the garrison had been subdued, and then lay the charges.McGlynn (1953), pp. 10‚Äì11 Napoleon Zervas with EDES officers The attack on the garrison outposts on the two ends of the bridge began as scheduled, but went on far longer than the time originally allotted. Myers took it upon himself to send the demolition teams in while the fight was still under way.McGlynn (1953), pp. 11‚Äì12 The setting of the charges was delayed also, since the girders to be destroyed turned out to be differently shaped than had been anticipated, forcing the British sappers to cut their plastic explosive charges to pieces and then assemble new ones.Howarth (1980), p. 100 After the charges were set and the fuses were lit, the first explosion occurred on 01:30, heavily damaging the central pier and collapsing two spans. The British demolition teams then set new explosives to the second pier and the remaining span, which went off at 02:21. In the meantime, the guerrilla outposts had engaged and halted a train with Italian reinforcements heading to the scene.McGlynn (1953), p. 12 By 04:30, the entire attacking force, which had suffered only four wounded, had successfully disengaged and retreated to its assembly area.  Aftermath  The sabotage mission was a major success for SOE, being the biggest such operation carried out until then. Although its original military objective, the disruption of supplies for Rommel's troops, had been rendered obsolete by the Allied victory at El Alamein, it did display the potential for major guerrilla actions in serving Allied strategic objectives, encouraged SOE to aid the development of resistance movements, and provided a major morale boost for occupied Greece.Woodhouse (2002), p. 26 In its aftermath, the Harling mission was not withdrawn, as originally envisaged, but instructed to remain on spot and form the British Military Mission to Greece. Unfortunately for the Greeks however, it was the last time where ELAS and EDES, the country's two major guerrilla forces, would cooperate militarily; within a month, the first clashes between ELAS and EDES forces occurred, a prelude of the open conflict that would erupt between ELAS and the other resistance groups in 1943, and a herald of the Greek Civil War from 1946 to 1949. The bridge itself was repaired in 19 days by the IV Railway Engineer Battalion, of the Royal Italian Army's Railway Engineer Regiment.

Background From modest parentage, Mate was bred and raced by Albert C. Bostwick, Jr., whose grandfather was a founding partner of Standard Oil. Mate was trained by Jim Healy and had to race against very strong opponents in 1930 and 1931 when he was part of what the Chicago Tribune newspaper called the \\"big four\\" in racing which included Twenty Grand, Jamestown, and Equipoise. Racing career=United States At age two, Mate won several races including two from the most important for his age group, the Breeders' Futurity Stakes and the Champagne Stakes. The following year, in what was the first leg of the 1931 U.S. Triple Crown series, on May 9 Mate beat Twenty Grand to win Preakness Stakes while equaling the stakes record. That year's Kentucky Derby was then run on May 16 and won by Twenty Grand with Mate finishing third behind runner- up, Sweep All. He did not run in the Belmont Stakes but went on to win the prestigious American Derby in Chicago and beat Twenty Grand for the second time while winning the Arlington Classic in which he set a new Arlington Park track record of 2:02 2-5 for 1¬º miles on dirt. Racing in 1932 and 1933, at age four and five, Mate won the 1933 Thanksgiving Day Handicap at Bowie Race Track, a race he had previously won as a three-year-old. and had second and third-place finishes in some of the major racing events including the Brooklyn and Metropolitan Handicaps. England In 1934, the then six-year-old mate was sent to England with the ultimate goal of winning the Ascot Gold Cup at Ascot Racecourse. Having been accustomed to race on flat, oval dirt tracks for most of his career he now had to adapt to European turf courses. He first ran in the Newbury Spring Cup in mid April without showing well, then finished third in the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom Downs. He was second on the same racecourse in the Coronation Cup but out of the money behind Felicitation in June's Ascot Gold Cup. Mate won his first and only stakes in England on October 19, 1934, capturing the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. Stud record Retired to stud duty, from a limited number of offspring, Mate most notably sired Elkridge, a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee who was the American Champion Steeplechase Horse in 1942 and 1946.

It lies at the western end of the Wetterstein chain in the Alps on the border between the German state of Bavaria and the Austrian state of Tyrol. It is the dominant mountain in the Wetterstein, especially when viewed from Ehrwald.  Distinction from the Zugspitze  Although the Schneefernerkopf may be viewed as the 'second highest mountain in Germany' after the Zugspitze, this depends heavily on the definition of the term 'mountain'. Due to its proximity to the Zugspitze (it has a topographic isolation of 1.7 km) it is questionable whether it can be counted as an independent mountain, or merely as a sub-peak of the Zugspitze. Either way, its prominence is 176 m. If it is not reckoned as an independent peak, then the claim to the second highest mountain in Germany goes to the Hochwanner (2,746 m), which is clearly separated from the Zugspitze massif by the Rein Valley, Gatterl and Feldernj√∂chl. The third highest mountain, with a height of 2,713 m, is the Watzmann in the Berchtesgaden Alps.  Base and easiest climb  The easiest way to climb the Schneefernerkopf is from the Zugspitze ledge or Zugspitzplatt. The path runs over the rest of the Schneeferner or past it to the Schneefernerscharte. Here there is the 'wind hole (Windloch), a result of weathering, with its view looking down onto Ehrwald. To get to the peak the path crosses the northern shoulder on steps and along a steep path with the aid of steel cables, which follows the Schneefernerkopf Lift, closed in 2003 but not removed. The entire journey takes just under an hour. Sure-footedness and a head for heights are essential. From the Schneefernerkopf there is an exceptionally challenging downhill ski run, the Neue Welt, descending for almost 2,000 metres, to Ehrwald. It is very exposed, with slopes up to 45¬∞ and has an abseil section, that is rated as UIAA grade III.

Along with William Simpson and Melton Prior, Villiers was one of the most notable 'special' artists of the later 19th century. He may have been the model for the Kipling war-artist character, Dick Heldar in The Light that Failed. Biography Born in London, England on 23 April 1851, Villiers was educated in France at Gu√Ænes situated in the Pas-de-Calais. Between 1869 and 1870, he was an art student at the British Museum and in South Kensington, and in the following year at the Royal Academy Schools. In 1876 while walking down Holborn, he noticed a crowd reading a poster of an evening paper stating that Serbia had declared war on Turkey. He immediately decided to contact the paper, The Graphic, offering his services as a war artist. The paper took him up on his offer and it was the beginning of a long career covering wars and conflicts around the globe. Having reported on the Russo-Turkish War in 1877 and witnessed the events at the Battle of Plevna, he traveled to Afghanistan to cover the Second Afghan War that had broken out in 1878. Here he befriended Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari who gave the artist the pens that were used to sign the Treaty of Gandamak. A world cruise followed in which he visited British India where he dined with the Viceroy, Lord Lytton at Simla, travelling on to Sydney, Tasmania, Auckland, Honolulu and San Francisco, and in 1882 was in Egypt to cover the Anglo-Egyptian War; he was present at Battle of Tel-el-Kebir. In July 1882 he was a guest alongside rival journalist Moberly Bell on board HMS Condor when its commander Lord Charles Beresford attacked Fort Marabut during the Bombardment of Alexandria.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.300 The following year saw him in Russia to cover the coronation of Tsar Alexander III but he was soon back in North Africa, this time to provide sketches of the fighting in the Sudan during the Gordon relief expedition. He covered the Serbo-Bulgarian War in 1886, the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1887, the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì95, and the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. In 1898, he was one of the artists sent to cover the campaign in Sudan which culminated at Battle of Omdurman. Villiers brought along an early cine-camera and was filming when an explosion caused the boat to rock in the Nile River, tipping over the apparatus. His other campaigns included the Boer War where he accompanied the Kimberley Relief Column. During the Russo-Japanese War, Villiers was embedded with Japanese troops at the Battle of Port Arthur as a reporter for The Illustrated London News. Few other illustrators or cameramen were willing to approach the front lines as closely as Villiers, and many of his sketches were published in various newspapers and books during and after the war.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 409. However, during First World War, Villiers was particularly frustrated during the opening months for not being allowed to go near the front Villiers worked primarily for The Graphic but also supplied illustrations to Black and White as well as serving as a special correspondent of The Standard; he also contributed illustrations to the English Illustrated Magazine and The Idler. He counted among his friends, Archibald Forbes and John Alexander Cameron, who was killed in the Gordon Relief Expedition; he was also a friend of the Prince of Wales and was invited on at least one occasion to go hunting with the Prince in Scotland. Villiers exhibited two paintings at the Royal Academy, the first in 1882 entitled 'The road home; the return of an Imperial brigade from Afghanistan', and in the following year 'Fighting Arabi with his own weapons; an incident of the Battle of Tel el-Kebir'. He was awarded twelve medals and war decorations over his career, including awards from Russia, Romania, the Egyptian Khedive's Star, and the Serbian Order of Takova. Villiers gave frequent illustrated lectures and published several autobiographical works describing his experiences at the front. He died on 5 April 1922.

He began his second presidential term on 27 January 2018. He is the leader of the Hernandez Cartel. Hern√°ndez was the president of the National Congress of Honduras between January 2010 and June 2013, when he was given permission by the Congress to absent himself from all responsibilities in the Congress to dedicate himself to his presidential campaign. He announced that he would seek re-election in 2017, after the Supreme Court made it allowed in April 2015. On 15 December 2016, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal decided, by two votes to one, to allow Hern√°ndez to stand in the primary elections by the National Party of Honduras on 12 March 2017, despite arguments that such a decision was illegal. On 12 March 2017, he won the National Party's primary vote to allow him to represent his party during the 2017 Honduran general election on 26 November 2017. In the elections, Hern√°ndez was declared the winner by a narrow margin (0.5%), after a reelection campaign widely criticized as fraudulent, but the United States swiftly recognized Hern√°ndez as the official winner.

This union has produced three children: Juan Orlando, Ana Daniela, and Isabela. He was a coffee grower campesino in his native Gracias. He gained notoriety in Honduras when Liberal leader Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez, who represented Lempira Department since 2001, was elected head of a National Congress where the National Party had a comfortable majority, on 21 January 2010, and took office four days later.Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez, nuevo presidente del CN  Presidential campaigns  In 2012, he fought a campaign against Ricardo √Ålvarez to try to become the nationalist presidential candidate for 2013, and won the internal election of November 2012; √Ålvarez publicly denounced the result as fraudulent and demanded a \\"vote by vote\\" recount, which the Tribunal Supremo Electoral (TSE) rejected. A poll conducted in May 2013 saw him in third place with a projected 18% of the vote. He began his presidential campaign in July 2013 in Intibuc√° and La Paz with a campaign entitled El Pueblo Propone (The People Propose in English). He campaigned for the military to police the streets, and claimed that his closest rival Xiomara Castro wanted to remove the Polic√≠a Militar (English: Military Police) which were already in Honduras' two main cities. He won the election, beating Castro by 250,000 votes. Hern√°ndez said National Party accountants found that approximately L3 million lempira (about US$140,000) from companies with links to the Honduran Social Security Institute (IHSS) scandal had entered its campaign coffers. On 22 April 2015, the Supreme Court unanimously allowed presidential re-election. On 12 March 2017, Hern√°ndez became the National Party candidate by defeating his rival Roberto Castillo during the National Party primary. The Honduran Constitution allows revocation of citizenship of anyone who promotes changing the law to allow re-election, however Hern√°ndez's National Party, which also controls Congress, says a Supreme Court ruling last year allows him to stand for a new term. Opposition Liberal Party claims that the court does not have the power to make such decisions. The President was re-elected in 2018 after a vote deemed fraudulent by the opposition and international observers. The government declares a state of emergency. Some 30 demonstrators were killed and more than 800 arrested. According to the United Nations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, \\"many of them were transferred to military installations, where they were brutally beaten, insulted and sometimes tortured\\". Presidency Hern√°ndez in 2018 Corruption protests Hondurans both in and outside Honduras have protested against corruption in Honduras, allegedly by Hern√°ndez government as well as the judiciary, the military, the police and other public administration entities, demanding an end to what they say is the theft of funds and public money; for example, the embezzlement of the IHSS. In May 2015, Radio Globo discovered documents that allegedly showed that the Honduran National Party had received large amounts of cash from nonexistent companies through fraudulent contracts awarded by the IHSS when it was run by Mario Zelaya. The contracts were approved by congress when Hern√°ndez was its president and the party funding committee was headed by his sister, Hilda Hern√°ndez. Hern√°ndez has accepted that his election campaign received money from companies tied to the scandal, but denies any personal knowledge. By June 2015, Hern√°ndez had appointed a commission to investigate the cause of the corruption. In 2017, the Drug Enforcement Agency in Miami arrested Hern√°ndez's brother, Juan Antonio Hern√°ndez, for drug trafficking and for using Honduran military personnel and equipment to ship cocaine to the United States on behalf of the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel. Rosenthal family case of drug trafficking  On 7 October 2015, the United States Department of Justice released a statement saying that Jaime Rosenthal, his son Yani Rosenthal and nephew Yankel Rosenthal, as well as seven other businesses, were labeled \\"specially designated narcotics traffickers\\" under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, the first time this had been used against a bank outside the United States. As a result, the Honduran National Commission for Banks and Insurance (Comisi√≥n Nacional de Banca y Seguros, CNBS), forcibly liquidated the Banco Continental, property of the Rosenthal family, which was closed as of Monday, 12 October 2015, as well as other businesses and properties allegedly involved in money laundering. Hern√°ndez said that the financial system \\"is solid\\" and made it clear that this \\"is a problem between Banco Continental and the USA justice system\\". Appointment of sister as Minister of Communications & Government Strategy Hilda Hern√°ndez in 2016 The US Central Intelligence Agency listed Hilda Hern√°ndez as Minister of Communications & Government Strategy. When questioned by journalist Fernando del Rinc√≥n of CNN en Espa√±ol over the appointment of his sister, Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez said that his sister did not hold any position of Secretary of State (but rather, \\"Advising Minister\\") and did not manage a budget.\\" Juan Orlando en CNN con Fernando del Rinc√≥n\\", Noti Bomba As corruption enquiries continued, on 2 January 2016 Hilda Hern√°ndez left her position in the government. US drug trafficking investigation At the end of May 2019 US prosecutors unsealed some 2015 documents which revealed that Hern√°ndez was himself the subject of a major drug trafficking and money laundering investigation, alongside his sister Hilda and others.Honduras deploys security forces as doctors and teachers demand president's resignation Published by The Guardian on 5th June, 2019, consulted the same day Protests On 21 June 2018, president Hern√°ndez ordered units of the Honduran army and the military police in the streets of the capital after renewed protests. According to a :es:Hospital Escuela Universitario spokesperson, at least 17 people suffered bullet wounds as a result of violence in the protests, and two of them died at the hospital. In April 2019, new anti-privatisation and anti-corruption protests erupted, lead by Tegucigalpa Autonomous University students and by health care workers. Tear gas was used against the protesters in demonstrations that took place in the center of Tegucigalpa. Implicated in drug money conspiracy Orlando Hern√°ndez was identified as a co-conspirator in a drug trafficking and money laundering case against his brother, according to document filed in U.S. district court. Prosecutors say $1.5 million in drug proceeds was used to help elect him in 2013. Hern√°ndez responded saying he is foe of traffickers who are out for revenge against him. A document released by a U.S. district court implicates Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez in a conspiracy with his brother, Antonio \\"Tony\\" Hern√°ndez, and other high-level officials ‚Äî including former President Porfirio Lobo Sosa ‚Äî \\"to leverage drug trafficking to maintain and enhance their political power.\\" The 44-page document ‚Äì which is related to the trial of Tony Hern√°ndez in New York's Southern District on drug trafficking and other charges ‚Äì summarizes some of the key evidence collected by prosecutors against the defendant, who they accuse of being a ‚Äúviolent, multi-ton drug trafficker‚Äù who allegedly abused his political connections for personal and political gain and at least twice ‚Äúhelped arrange murders of drug trafficking rivals.‚Äù After Tony Hern√°ndez's conviction on October 18, 2019, 7,000 supporters of President Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez, including members of the official National Party of Honduras, marched in Tegucigalpa. President Hern√°ndez criticized his brother's conviction as basado en testimonios de asesinos (\\"based on testimony from killers\\") and denied that Honduras has become a narco-state. Personal life On 17 June 2020, President Orlando Hern√°ndez and his wife, Ana Garc√≠a, reported that they had been infected by COVID-19. Orlando Hern√°ndez had instituted tough measures to prevent the spread of the disease, including enforced social distancing, the use of face masks, and a curfew.

Iyengar is the S.T. Lee Professor of Business in the Management Department at Columbia Business School, widely and best known as an expert on choice. Her research focuses on the many facets of decision making, including: why people want choice, what affects how and what we choose, and how we can improve our decision making. She has presented TED talks on choice and is the author of The Art of Choosing (2010).  Early life and education  Iyengar was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Her parents were Brahmin immigrants from Delhi, India. As a child, she was diagnosed with a rare form of retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disease of retinal degeneration. By the age of nine, she could no longer read. By the age of sixteen, she was completely blind, although able to perceive light. She remains blind as an adult. Iyengar‚Äôs father died of a heart attack when she was thirteen. This change in family circumstances, and Iyengar‚Äôs loss of vision, prompted Iyengar‚Äôs mother to steer her towards higher education and self-sufficiency, saying to Iyengar: ‚ÄúI don't want to hear about men or boys, you've got to stand on your own two feet.‚Äù In 1992, she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School and a B.A. in Psychology from the College of Arts and Sciences. She then earned her Ph.D. in Social Psychology from Stanford University in 1997. For her dissertation ‚ÄúChoice and its Discontents,‚Äù Iyengar received the Best Dissertation Award for 1998 from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology.  Academic career  Iyengar's first faculty appointment was at the Sloan School of Management at MIT from July 1997 to June 1998. In 1998, Iyengar joined the faculty at the Columbia Business School, starting as an assistant professor. She has been a full professor at Columbia from July 2007 onward and, since November 2009, the inaugural S.T. Lee Professor of Business. Her principal line of research concerns the psychology of choice, and she has been studying how people perceive and respond to choice since the 1990s. She has authored or coauthored over 30 journal articles. Her research and statements have been cited often in the print media, including by Bloomberg Business Week, CityLab, Money Magazine, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. Media appearances include The Diane Rehm Show (NPR), Marketplace (APM). Iyengar was the recipient of the 2001 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for, as the NSF said, ‚Äúhelping lead to a better understanding of how cultural, individual, and situational dimensions of human decision-making can be used to improve people's lives.‚Äù In 2011, Iyengar was named a member of the Thinkers50, a global ranking of the top 50 management thinkers. In 2012, she was awarded the Dean‚Äôs Award for Outstanding Core Teaching from Columbia Business School.  Non-academic works  Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award In addition to the journal articles mentioned above, Iyengar has written non-academic articles, including for CNN and Slate, and many book chapters. She has also presented two TED talks: ‚ÄúThe Art of Choosing‚Äù (2010) and ‚ÄúHow to Make Choosing Easier‚Äù (2012). The book she is most known for, The Art of Choosing (2010), explores the mysteries of choice in everyday life. It was listed third in Amazon‚Äôs top ten books in Business & Investing of 2010 and was shortlisted for the 2010 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award.

Chloe, like series protagonist Nathan Drake, is a treasure hunter. Introduced in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, where she has a romantic history with Drake, she later appears in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, and becomes the main protagonist in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Chloe is initially depicted as a strong character who aggressively looks out for her own interests, although over the course of The Lost Legacy she evolves into a more heroic and selfless individual. She is portrayed by Claudia Black through voice and motion capture. Chloe was designed to provide a darker counterpart to Drake, while Black compared her personality to that of Indiana Jones. The character was well-received by gamers and the press, who noted her independence and sensuality while also considering her to be unique and fun; character designer Justin Richmond stated that she was one of his favorite characters in the series to create. Character design Chloe Frazer was designed to play off of the personality of Nathan Drake, the main protagonist of the Uncharted series. Through interaction, she brings out particular facets of Drake's personality. Amy Hennig, series writer, wanted Chloe to act as a foil to Drake, essentially acting as a darker version of the main character. She also contrasts to Elena Fisher, who acts as the \\"good girl\\" of Uncharted. Chloe was voiced by Claudia Black. For the series, motion capture actors acted as if performing in a movie. Motion capture was done on a soundstage, and the dialog recorded during this process was used in the game. The chemistry and interactions between Black and Nolan North, voice actor for Drake, had a hand in determining Chloe's personality. Black compared the process to a combination of stage, movie, and voice acting. Chloe is of Indian ancestry on her father's side and was brought up in Australia. She is an impulsive and reckless adventurer. She is witty, devious, and fun seeking. Chloe is also a very sexually forward character; when she and Drake have a love scene, she acts as the initiator. At first, she appears only to look out for her own interests, caring little for anything but her goal. Chloe was used heavily in promotion for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, to showcase the fact that new characters were central to the story. She was displayed so heavily that at first some thought that Fisher, the female protagonist of the first game, would not be in the second. Appearances Chloe Frazer, as she debuted in Uncharted 2 Near the beginning of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Chloe and business associate Harry Flynn convince Drake to help with a museum robbery. They have been hired by a wealthy benefactor to steal a piece of ancient Chinese pottery, which Kublai Khan had given to Marco Polo. Inside this ceramic lamp is a map and blue resin which reveal the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet. Unbeknownst to Flynn, Chloe and Drake had a previous relationship in the past, and resume their romance behind Flynn's back. Without Chloe's knowledge, Flynn betrays Drake, who ends up in a Turkish jail where he stays for three months. Chloe eventually engineers Drake's release, along with his associate Victor Sullivan. Chloe then begins traveling with Flynn, and war criminal Zoran Lazarevic. She discovers that they are after the fabled city of Shambhala and the Cintamani stone, seeking immortality. She acts as a double agent within Lazarevic's criminal organization, and seemingly betrays Drake to keep her \\"cover\\". She meets up with Drake in Nepal to assist in searching for the location of Shambhala before Flynn can find it. Later, Drake attempts to rescue her from a train controlled by Lazarevic, but she refuses to go with him, due to him bringing Elena and Jeff earlier. She appears later in the game in a monastery in the Himalayas, where she follows Drake and Lazarevic into the entrance of Shambhala, and assists in taking down Lazarevic's army, while Drake stops the leader himself. At the end of the game, seeing that Drake loves Elena, she leaves the two in the mountains. Chloe returns in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, working with Nathan, Sully and new character Charlie Cutter to infiltrate the inner circle of Katherine Marlowe, who possesses the clues about the details of Sir Francis Drake's voyage to Arabia. They discover that the final clues lie in Crusader crypts in France and Syria, and Nate sends Chloe and Cutter to Syria to uncover it. During the search, Marlowe's men ambush them and a gunfight and chase ensues. Though they manage to escape alive, Cutter breaks his leg, and Chloe subsequently backs out of the adventure to get Cutter medical aid. Chloe does not appear in the main story of Uncharted 4, however, during the beginning events of the game, it is shown that she sent a note to Nathan, saying she's available if he were to ever start treasure hunting again. She also is available to play as in the multiplayer. However, in December 2016, a DLC story was revealed called Uncharted: The Lost Legacy featuring Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross in a standalone story apart from the events of the Uncharted series, set after the events of Uncharted 4 after Nadine escapes. In the standalone expansion, Chloe's backstory is revealed. Her father was a treasure hunter who, while on the hunt for the Tusk of Ganesh, was killed by bandits when defending it. Chloe then hunts for the Tusk with Nadine's help while coming into conflict with Asav and his insurgency as well as Nadine's former army Shoreline. Later it is revealed that she initially teamed with Nathan's brother Sam, sending him to do recon for her but when he was abducted by Asav, enlisted Nadine's aid due to her history with Asav. She and Nadine then learn Asav was not seeking the tusk but actually wanted it so he could sell it for bomb which he can then use to destroy the city triggering a civil war. Chloe, Nadine and Sam then race against time and eventually stop Asav and his army, saving the day. She and Nadine then agree to partner up after the latter moves on from her initial goal of claiming Shoreline and develops a newfound interest in treasure hunting. Reception Most critics have received Chloe Frazer positively, focusing on her strength and sexuality; they often cite her as an exceptional example of an independent female video game character. Tom Cross of Gamasutra called Chloe a strong woman, and compared her to Elika from Prince of Persia. He further called her a \\"first\\" in video games - a heterosexual female who badgers the male protagonist and displays competency and guile: \\"Chloe Frazer stands head and shoulders above all video game characters, but compared to most women in games, she is truly unique.\\" He also characterizes her as one of \\"the most fun, interesting, inoffensive characters in video games.\\" Cross also cited her as a character who accurately reflects the nature of human sexual desire and frustration. GamesRadar named Chloe \\"Miss 2009\\" of the \\"Sexiest New Characters of the Decade\\", calling her exotic and flirtatious. Entertainment Weeklys Darren Franich listed her as one of \\"15 Kick-Ass Women in Videogames\\", describing her as \\"tough, funny, and prone to backstabbing.\\" Claudia Black commented that Chloe was fun to portray, and is essentially \\"Indiana Jones with nice hair\\". Uncharted 2: Among Thieves game designer Justin Richmond called Chloe his favorite character. Black was nominated at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards under the category \\"Best Voice\\" for her work as Chloe.

He was an early convert to the Quaker faith, to which many of later generations were also true. Origins Burke, in his History of the commoners,John Burke A genealogical and heraldic history of the commoners (1838) Volume 4, p.314. Available online at GoogleBooks states \\"that the numerous families of Fox at present residing in the West of England sprang from one common ancestor, a Francis Fox, who married 1646, Dorothy Kekewich.\\" Tradition represents him to have come from Wiltshire (it is said from the parish of Farley or that of Pitton), somewhere in 1645, during the commotions of the civil war. He is stated to have been descended from the same family as the celebrated Sir Stephen Fox, ancestor of the Earls of Ilchester and the Lords Holland. It is likewise handed down that he was one of seven or eight sons, and that others of the same family also came into Devonshire and Cornwall, settling at Plymouth and Looe, but left no sons who survived.Revised genealogical account of the various families descended from Francis Fox for a full citation, see Sources above. Settling down After marrying in 1646 he lived at Catchfrench, a 16th-century manor house belonging to the Kekewiches. Catchfrench is about three miles (5 km) from St Germans, where Francis was a clothier. It is about the same distance from Menheniot, where George Fox held his first Cornish meetings. George Fox brought the Quaker message to Cornwall in 1655 and it was then or a little later that Francis and his family joined the Society of Friends. His son, also Francis, married Tabitha Croker in 1686. They had three sons and four daughters. Their progeny settled and were successful in business and the professions in Wadebridge,The Wadebridge Foxes lived grandly at Gonveva.

George's descendants became prosperous merchants and were influential in the development of education, the arts and sciences in the town. Two of their number wrote fascinating journals, during the 19th century which were published in the 1970s. Joseph and many of his descendants were physicians. The Wellington Foxes=Thomas Fox, homespun Quaker The Wellington Fox family is descended from Francis Fox by way of Edward Fox of Wadebridge. He was married to Anna Were, whose family had long been established as textile manufacturers in Wellington in the county of Somerset. Their son, Thomas (17 January 1747-29 April 1821) became a partner in the firm and married Sarah Smith, the daughter of Thomas Smith, a London banker. They had 15 children, of whom seven sons and three daughters survived to adulthood. Thomas and Sarah, built in 1801, then lived in, Tone Dale House, Wellington - the house is still lived in by a Fox, five generations later, by Ben and Victoria Fox. Thomas Fox started a bank in Wellington which rapidly expanded and ran successfully, until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1927. The sons who participated in the family business were Thomas (1786-1862), Edward (1789-1845), Sylvanus (1791-1851), Samuel (1794-1874), Henry (1800-1876), Charles (1801-1860).Edward H Milligan The Biographical Dictionary of British Quakers in Commerce and Industry 1775-1920, Sessions of York (2007) . His source for this item is Hubert Fox Quaker Homespun (1958). The House and the Mill The Wellington Foxes built a large textile mill and a grand house at Tone Dale House, Wellington, Somerset (which is now part of the Big House Co). The mill is currently being converted into residential apartments. The brochure says: \\"The 12.6 acre former woollen textile mill complex is a brownfield site featuring a range of Grade II and Grade II* listed buildings. Established in 1790 by the Fox family, Tonedale Mill was the largest integrated mill in the South West, producing woollen and worsted fabrics. It became a site of national importance during the Boer War when the Tonedale dyers developed the ‚Äòkhaki‚Äô dye - given the royal seal of approval by the then Prince of Wales in 1900 ‚Äì which led to the end of British soldiers‚Äô ‚Äòredcoats‚Äô. At its peak, Tonedale Mill employed some 4,500 people and exported fabrics around the world. It also provided livelihoods for other related trades on the site, including bookbinders, basket weavers, stonemasons and metalworkers. From the 1950s, manufacturing at Britain‚Äôs mills went into decline. The deafening noise of the powerlooms housed in Tonedale‚Äôs weaving sheds was heard no more once production on the site ceased by the end of the 1990s, although the firm of Fox Brothers and Company Ltd still exists and operates in a nearby location to this day.Tonedale Mill brochure.

Rum-running in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, was a major activity in the early part of the 20th century. In 1916, the State of Michigan, in the United States, banned the sale of alcohol, three years before prohibition became the national law in 1919. From that point forward, the City of Windsor, Ontario was a major site for alcohol smuggling and gang activity.Arthur Walker Blakemore, National prohibition, the Volstead Act annotated, 2d ed., M-Bender & company inc., Albany New York, 1925. p.18 The Canadian federal government regulated the manufacturing, importation, and exportation of alcoholic beverages in all the provinces.Allison Lawlor, Rum-Running, Nimbus, Halifax N.S., c.2009 p.30 When the Wartime Resource Act, which prohibited the manufacturing, sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages expired on January 1, 1927, new legislation authorized each province to decide whether to continue the enforced bans on alcohol. Like most provinces in Canada, Ontario chose to continue to ban the production and sale of alcohol. This decision led to an upswing in organized crime activity along the Detroit-Windsor borders.  The Eighteenth Amendment, Volstead Act and near beer  On January 16, 1919, the American Government passed the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It had three sections: Congressman Andrew John Volstead was one of the main promoters of the Eighteenth Amendment.Daniel Okrent, \\"Last Call, The Rise and Fall of Prohibition\\", Scrbner, New York, 2010 The Volstead Act of 1920 defined intoxicating liquor as any liquor containing more than 0.5% alcohol. It permitted the manufacture of non-intoxicating cider and fruit juices for home use, as well as permitting households to ferment wine for private consumption; and it allowed the sale of alcoholic beverages for medicinal, sacramental, and industrial purposes. The Volstead Act allowed breweries to produce \\"near beer\\" with an alcohol content of up to 0.5%. To make the near beer, distilleries produced beer and then let it sit to allow most of its alcoholic content to evaporate. This allowed breweries to produce virtually unlimited amounts of beer.Charles Hanson Towne, The rise and fall of prohibition: the human side of what the Eighteenth amendment and the Volstead act have done to the United States, MacMillan, New York, 1923. p.55 Even though Ontario had their own prohibition, called the Ontario Temperance Act, which lasted from 1916 through 1927, it was still legal to manufacture and export alcohol. This loophole led to a great deal of alcohol smuggling via the Detroit River between Windsor and Detroit, the largest U.S. city on the Canada‚ÄìU.S. border.Gerald A. Hallowell, \\"Prohibition In Ontario, 1919-1923\\" Love Printing Service Ltd. Ottawa,1972  \\"Joe sent me\\"  Detroit police inspecting equipment found in a clandestine underground brewery during the Prohibition eraThe popular saying, \\"Joe sent me\\", was used to gain entry to speakeasies, blind pigs, clubs or joints. By 1928, there were from 16,000 to 25,000 speakeasies and clubs in the Windsor- Detroit area, located in slums as well as in some of Detroit's most prestigious neighborhoods. Popular drinks of the time varied depending on the club, distinguishing one club from another. Criminal gangs either owned the clubs or provided protection from police and other gangs. Some clubs and speakeasies offered food, at times for free with the purchase of a beverage to encourage customers during prohibition. Police were often bribed to protect against raids, however, they would intervene if a club was prone to violence or cases of food poisoning. The lure of speakeasies during prohibition is not difficult to understand. Gambling played a significant role ‚Äî slot machines, poker, blackjack and roulette were popular in higher-class blind pigs ‚Äî giving clubs a social and economic benefit. The commonly accepted attitude and minimal penalties for drinking were not much of a deterrent. The thrill of violating prohibition laws appealed to the young, who were rarely embarrassed to have their names in the paper. Blind pigs generally went unnoticed, although those near churches and schools were often targeted. Drinking on campuses were usually concentrated among sororities and fraternities. The Volstead Act allowed people to obtain liquor for \\"medicinal purposes\\" by a physician's prescription, this often was then diluted and sold for huge profits.Philip P. Mason, Rum-Running and the Roaring Twenties, Prohibition on the Michigan-Ontario Waterways, Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1927 p.89 Many Americans came to Windsor to enjoy a good time while drinking. There were several places for Americans to drink and party simply by crossing the Detroit River, including roadhouses. One of the most popular was the Island View Hotel, off the shore of the Detroit River with its own dock. Today, Island View Hotel known as Abars, is closed and the building torn down.Marty Gervais, \\"Rum Runners\\", Bilioasis, Emeryville, Canada, 2009, pg.38  Drys vs. Wets  The term \\"Drys\\" referred to those who were in favor of prohibition, who were generally well financed and organized, and included figures such as Billy Sunday, organized civic groups, some religious denominations and many leaders of the Progressive movement which also supported social causes such as women's suffrage. Supporters of prohibition argued that it helped the American family, churches, schools, workers and the American political system. The losers, in this view, were seen as criminals, drunks and corrupt politicians. The \\"Wets\\" were those who opposed prohibition, and were, for the most part, poorly organized, especially in the early years. Saloons keepers, brewers, and distillers were viewed as corrupting influences, and many people who enjoyed consuming alcohol in private were constrained from doing so, or supporting its legal use, by social, political or religious considerations in public. The entrance of the United States into World War I provided opportunities to win broader support for prohibition. Rationing was widely accepted as a necessary ingredient of the American war effort. The use of grain for alcohol production, which could otherwise have been used in the production of necessary agricultural products, was seen as wasteful.Philip P. Mason, Rum- Running and the Roaring Twenties, p.20  Methods  Rum runners found several ways to smuggle alcohol from Windsor to Detroit. One of the most significant methods was for large vessels docked in Windsor on the Detroit River to have documentation for South America, but would then simply drop off its shipments in Detroit. The only stipulation being a B-13 clearance document had to be issued from federal customs officials with the destination stamped on it.Marty Gervais, \\"Rum Runners\\", Bilioasis, Emeryville, Canada, 2009, pg 22 For example, rum runners would unload a boxcar into a boat at the docks in Windsor. The boat driver would have a permit, stamped by a bribed customs officer, allowing him to export his cargo to Venezuela. Instead of Venezuela, the driver would simply take his cargo to Detroit. A day's work could net the driver approximately $200.Janice Patton, \\"The Sinking of the I'm Alone\\", McCelland and Stewart Limited, Toronto, 1973, pg 13 Harry Low was one of the first people to take full advantage of this opportunity by purchasing large vessels to deliver alcohol to Michigan while having papers saying his shipments were to Cuban or West Indian ports.Marty Gervais, \\"Rum Runners\\", Bilioasis, Emeryville, Canada, 2009, pg 96 Rocco Perri, a bootlegger from Hamilton, Ontario, also sold trainloads of liquor into Detroit and Chicago through Niagara Falls and Windsor. In wintertime, when the Detroit River froze, rum runners drove across the river, often taking lighter cars with smaller engines. These lighter vehicles were called \\"whiskey sixes\\" by the smugglers because of the vehicle's six-cylinder engine.Janice Patton, \\"The Sinking of the I'm Alone\\", McCelland and Stewart Limited, Toronto, 1973, pg12 Criminal gangs developed sophisticated methods to signal across the border to avoid raids and arrests; timed like clock work, one group arranged the purchase of liquor on Windsor's docks while another team transported it across. A third team would transport it to a warehouse where a final team organized the distribution. Gangs with strong financial backing would often bribe federal, state and local officials. Eventually airplanes were used, after the prohibition navy became effective, and railways were also used extensively. Railways were responsible for around 800 cases of beer daily. Customs officers noticed that after the Volstead Act there was a sharp increase in the application of motorboat licenses. There were not a lot of local organized groups involved with rum running, but The Purple Gang was one, dealing with criminal activity from Grosse Pointe to Wyandotte. The Purple Gang's main rivals were the Licavoli Squad, who ran their smuggling operations on the upper Detroit River, virtually seizing control over the bigger east side businesses in the city.Marty Gervais, \\"Rum Runners\\", Bilioasis, Emeryville, Canada, 2009, pg 205 and 213 The Purple Gang became a major supplier to Al Capone and his Chicago Empire. The Purple Gang fell in 1929 after many leaders were either arrested or murdered. Italian mafiosi (Licavoli, Vitali, and Giannolo families; see more at Detroit Partnership) divided the waterways into sections and if crossed, all out warfare would follow. Gangs were financially stable and it allowed them to control state officials and police. They would hire anyone to transport alcohol: families, men, women and young teenagers.Gerlad A. Mallowell,Prohibition in Ontario, Ontario Historical Society, Toronto, 1975. p.120  Blaise Diesbourg  Blaise Diesbourg, also known as \\"King Canada,\\" was a major figure in the liquor smuggling and bootlegging business around Windsor during the American prohibition period. His success brought him in contact with Al Capone, who arranged a deal with Diesbourg to supply him with regular shipment of booze by plane. Diesbourg took the name \\"King Canada\\" at this time as an alias to hide from legal authorities.Marty Gervais, The Rumrunners: A Prohibition Scrapbook (Canada: Library and Archives Canada Cataloguing in Publication, 1980, 2009), 51. Due to the ease and proximity of smuggling across the Detroit River to the United States, it was an obvious choice for Diesbourg to expand his operations across the border. Farming or fishing wages of $35 a month could not compete with monthly rum running salaries of $400 a month for a captain. Seventy-five percent of all illegal liquor brought into the United States was transported across the Detroit River from Canada, mainly along the thirty-five mile stretch from Lake Erie to the St. Clair River. In fact, the city's two major industries during this time were the manufacturing of automobiles and the distribution of Canadian liquor.Philip P. Mason, Rumrunning and The Roaring Twenties: Prohibition on the Michigan-Ontario Waterway(Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1995), front flap. King Canada would smuggle liquor into the United States either by ship or plane, as well as using cars across the frozen Detroit River during the winter. He was one of the few bootleggers to utilize planes in his smuggling operations.Marty Gervais, The Rumrunners: A Prohibition Scrapbook (Canada: Library and Archives Canada Cataloguing in Publication, 1980, 2009), 56.  Harry Low  Harry Low was one of Windsor's most famous rum runners during the prohibition era, leaving behind one of Windsor's most treasured historic sites Devonshire Lodge. Low was a machinist by trade and worked in the industry for many years before opening up his own pool hall on Sandwich Street (Now Riverside Drive) in Windsor. As prohibition came to fruition in the 1920s, Low witnessed an opportunity to make quick money by smuggling booze from Windsor, Ontario. Low borrowed $300 from a friend to help him along with setting up a bootlegging business for his pool hall customers. Through the profits he made from this operation he was able to close his pool hall and move on to bigger bootlegging businesses, starting small by running liquor from Windsor across the Detroit River into Detroit. This proved to be so successful that soon Low had to purchase two cargo ships, most notable of which was the World War I Mine sweeper named \\"The Vedas\\", which was used mostly for the movement of alcohol from Montreal to the docks of Windsor. With all of his accomplishments there were also downfalls. In 1928, Carling Brewery, which Low was CEO of at the time, was sued by the Government of Canada for tax evasion. Low and his associates were also linked to the murder of a former employee whose body was found in south Michigan near the Ohio state line. By the end of the Great Depression most of Low's fortune had dried up in legal fees fighting charges in both Canada and the United States, as well as investing in his own promotions company, which ultimately failed. Low came full circle when he returned to Quebec to work as a tool maker in a ship yard, leaving his now failed empire behind him in Windsor. He would eventually return to Windsor, where he died in 1955 at the Hotel Dieu Hospital.  Outcome  Customs officers and police officials were overwhelmed by the smuggling; not only by the sheer number of people engaged in it, but also due to a miscalculation regarding Canada's commitment. The prohibition enforcement agencies lacked organization and smugglers often had better routes and better technology than the police. The police responded by introducing new equipment. Once the \\"prohibition navy\\" was established, rum runners began using aircraft. Canada was reluctant to close distilleries because of tax revenues and the potential loss of thousands of jobs, thus making alcohol easily available. The American government had several agencies attempting to stop smuggling from happening along the Detroit River. There was the Detroit Border Patrol, the Detroit Police, the Federal Prohibition Bureau, as well as other forces. The Detroit Border patrol was not very successful in their attempts to stop alcohol smuggling. The Federal Prohibition Bureau claimed that four-fifths of the nations supply of contraband alcohol came from Detroit.Janice Patton, \\"The Sinking of the I'm Alone\\", McCelland and Stewart Limited, Toronto, 1973, pg19 At the start of prohibition the American forces trying to stop rum running to Detroit were very impotent. But by 1922, they developed a powerful speedboat loaded with heavy weaponry, which would be the beginning of the \\"prohibition navy.\\"Marty Gervais, \\"Rum Runners\\", Bilioasis, Emeryville, Canada, 2009, pg 28 The United States was growing tired of the violence involved with smuggling; the unemployment rate was a staggering 46% in 1931. In 1933 it was argued that the legalization of liquor would reduce crime, lawlessness and gangs. The 18th amendment was repealed by the 21st amendment on December 5, 1933.Philip P.

BishopricElection and Appointment= The Krishna-Godavari Diocese of the Church of South India was formed in 1947, the very year of the formation of the Church of South India at the St. George's Cathedral, Chennai.

Early life He was the son of Frederick James Astbury JP of Hilton Park, Prestwich, near Manchester. He entered business as a calico printer, and was a director the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. During the First World War he volunteered for service in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, recruiting for the Royal Navy. Member of parliament for Salford West At the 1918 general election he was elected as Conservative member of parliament for Salford West. He was re- elected at the next election in 1922. In the following year the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, called an election on the issue of tariff reform. Astbury was regarded as having a very safe seat. However, the election saw a large electoral advance by the Labour Party, who gained all three Salford constituencies. Astbury was unseated by Labour's Alexander Haycock. Following the election, a minority Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald was formed. The administration collapsed in the following year, necessitating a further general election. Astbury regained the seat, benefitting from a large nationwide swing to the Conservatives. At the next election in 1929 the situation was reversed, there was a swing to Labour, which became the largest party in the Commons for the first time and Astbury was unseated by Haycock for a second time. By the time of the next general election in 1931 a National Government had been formed. Haycock and the majority of the Labour Party MPs refused to support the government. Astbury, running as a National Conservative highlighting a new, strengthened alliance struck with MacDonald and the National Labour Organisation in the throes of the Great Depression regained the seat. Resignation of National Government whip In May 1935 Astbury was one of five Conservative MPs who resigned the National Government whip. They felt they could no longer support the government over their failure to impose quotas or prohibitions on imports of textile goods from India and Burma, threatening the commerce of Lancashire. The group also felt that the National Government, supported in the main by Conservative members, had passed too much \\"Socialist\\" legislation, such as that creating the London Passenger Transport Board. He was summoned to a meeting of the West Salford Conservative and Unionist Association to explain his position, having first organised a meeting of his constituents which unanimously approved his actions. A decision on whether he would be adopted as the Conservative candidate at the next election was avoided when he announced he would not be seeking re-election due to poor health.

Then Province of Maryland had been a British / English colony since 1632, when Sir George Calvert, first Baron of Baltimore and Lord Baltimore (1579-1632), received a charter and grant from King Charles I of England and first created a haven for English Roman Catholics in the New World, with his son, Cecilius Calvert (1605-1675), the second Lord Baltimore equipping and sending over the first colonists to the Chesapeake Bay region in March 1634. The first signs of rebellion against the mother country occurred in 1765, when the tax collector Zachariah Hood was injured while landing at the second provincial capital of Annapolis docks, arguably the first violent resistance to British taxation in the colonies. After a decade of bitter argument and internal discord, Maryland declared itself a sovereign state in 1776. The province was one of the Thirteen Colonies of British America to declare independence from Great Britain and joined the others in signing a collective Declaration of Independence that summer in the Second Continental Congress in nearby Philadelphia. Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed on Maryland's behalf. Although no major Battles of the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) occurred in Maryland itself (although the British Royal Navy fleet passed through and up the Bay to land troops at the \\"Head of Elk\\"), to attack the colonies' capital city, this did not prevent the state's soldiers from distinguishing themselves through their service. General George Washington counted the \\"Maryland Line\\" regiment who fought in the Continental Army especially the famed \\"Maryland 400\\" during the Battle of Brooklyn in August 1776, outside New York Town as among his finest soldiers, and Maryland is still known as \\"The Old Line State\\" today. During the war itself, Baltimore Town served as the temporary capital of the colonies when the Second Continental Congress met there during December 1776 to February 1777, after Philadelphia had been threatened with occupation by the British \\"Redcoats\\". Towards the end of the struggle, from November 26, 1783, to June 3, 1784, the state's capital Annapolis, briefly served as the capital of the fledgling confederation government (1781-1789) of the United States of America, and it was in the Old Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House on State Circle in Annapolis that General George Washington famously resigned his commission as commander in chief of the Continental Army on December 23, 1783. It was also there that the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War, was ratified by the Confederation Congress on January 14, 1784. Like other states, Maryland was bitterly divided by the war; many Loyalists refused to join the Revolution, and saw their lands and estates confiscated as a consequence. The Barons Baltimore, who before the war had exercised almost feudal power in Maryland, were among the biggest losers. Almost the entire political elite of the province was overthrown, replaced by an entirely new political class, loyal to a new national political structure. Background Map of the Maryland colony, 1632‚Äì1776 The State of Maryland began as the Province of Maryland, an English settlement in North America founded in 1632 as a proprietary colony. George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1580‚Äì1632), wished to create a haven for his fellow English Catholics in the New World. After founding a colony in the Newfoundland called \\"Avalon\\", he convinced the King to grant him a second territory in more southern temperate climes. When George Calvert died in 1632 the grant was transferred to his eldest son Cecil. The ships The Ark and The Dove sent by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605‚Äì1675), landed on March 25, 1634, at Blackistone Island, thereafter known as St. Clement's Island. Here at St. Clement's Island, led by Father Andrew White, they raised a large cross, and held a mass. In April 1634, Lord Baltimore's younger brother Leonard Calvert, first colonial governor, made a settlement at what was named \\"St. Mary's City\\". Religious strife Although Maryland was an early pioneer of religious toleration in the British colonies, religious strife among Anglicans, Puritans, Roman Catholics, and Quakers was common in the early years, and in 1644 Puritan rebels briefly seized control of the province. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 saw King James II, of the dynasty of the House of Stuart, replaced with his Protestant daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange. In British North America, John Coode led a rebellion, known as the \\"Protestant Revolution\\", that expelled the Catholic Lords Baltimore from power and banned Roman Catholic worship in the Province. In 1692 King William III installed a crown-appointed governor.Events that Changed America Through the seventeenth century by John E. Findling, Frank W. Thackeray, pp. 133‚Äì34. Economy Diagram of a slave ship from the Atlantic slave trade. From an Abstract of Evidence delivered before a select committee of the House of Commons of Great Britain in 1790 and 1791. Despite early competition with the colony of Virginia to its south, the Province of Maryland developed along lines very similar to those of Virginia. Its early settlements and populations centers tended to cluster around the rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay. Like Virginia, Maryland's economy quickly became centered around the farming of tobacco for sale in Europe. The need for cheap labor to help with the growth of tobacco, and later with the mixed farming economy that developed when tobacco prices collapsed, led to a rapid expansion of indentured servitude and, later, forcible immigration and enslavement of Africans. In the later colonial period, the southern and eastern portions of the Province continued in their tobacco economy, heavily dependent on slave labor, but as the revolution approached, northern and central Maryland increasingly became centers of wheat production. This helped drive the expansion of interior farming towns like Frederick and Maryland's major port city of Baltimore. Economic tensions Among the many tensions between Maryland and the mother country were economic problems, focused around the sale of Maryland's principle cash crop, tobacco. A handful of Glasgow tobacco merchants increasingly dominated the tobacco trade between Britain and her colonies, manipulating prices and causing great distress among Maryland and Virginia planters, who by the time of the outbreak of war had accumulated debts of around ¬£1,000,000, a huge sum at the time. These debts, as much as the taxation imposed by Westminster, were among the colonists' most bitter grievances.Oliver, Neil, p. 340 Prior to 1740, Glasgow merchants were responsible for the import of less than 10% of America's tobacco crop, but by the 1750s a handful of Glasgow Tobacco Lords handled more of the trade than the rest of Britain's ports combined. Heavily capitalised, and taking great personal risks, these men made immense fortunes from the \\"Clockwork Operation\\" of fast ships coupled with ruthless dealmaking and the manipulation of credit.Oliver, p. 341 Maryland planters were offered easy credit by the Glaswegian merchants, enabling them to buy European consumer goods and other luxuries before harvest time gave them the ready cash to do so. But, when the time came to sell the crop, the indebted growers found themselves forced by the canny traders to accept low prices for their harvest simply in order to stave off bankruptcy.Oliver, p. 342 In neighbouring Virginia, tobacco planters experienced similar problems. At his Mount Vernon plantation, future President of the United States George Washington saw his liabilities swell to nearly ¬£2000 by the late 1760s.Randall, Willard Sterne. George Washington a Life. New York: Henry Holt &, 1998. Print. Thomas Jefferson, on the verge of losing his own farm, accused British merchants of unfairly depressing tobacco prices and forcing Virginia farmers to take on unsustainable debt loads. In 1786, he remarked: > A powerful engine for this [mercantile profiting] was the giving of good > prices and credit to the planter till they got him more immersed in debt > than he could pay without selling lands or slaves. They then reduced the > prices given for his tobacco so that ... they never permitted him to clear > off his debt.Breen, T. H. Tobacco Culture: the Mentality of the Great > Tidewater Planters on the Eve of Revolution. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton UP, > 1985. Print. Many Marylanders sought to use the opportunity posed by war to repudiate their debts. One of the \\"Resolves\\" later adopted by the citizens of Annapolis on May 25, 1774, would read as follows: > Resolved, that it is the opinion of the meeting, that the gentlemen of the > law of this province bring no suit for the recovery of any debt, due from > any inhabitant of this province to any inhabitant of Great Britain, until > the said act [The Stamp Act] be repealedAndrews, p. 293 After the war, few of the enormous debts owed by the colonists would ever be repaid. There were also serious tensions between the colonists and the British over land, especially after the Crown effectively confirmed Indian land rights in 1763. Washington himself was appalled by this decision to protect native property rights, writing to his future partner William Crawford in 1767 that he: > could never look upon that Proclamation in any other light ... than as a > temporary expedient to quiet the minds of the Indians. It must fall, of > course, in a few years, especially when those Indians consent to our > occupying their lands.Ferguson, p. 116 Tax protests In 1764 Britain imposed a tax on sugar, the first of many ultimately unsuccessful attempts to make her North American subjects bear a portion of the cost of the recent French and Indian war.Andrews, p. 276 The first stirrings of revolution in Maryland came in the Fall of 1765, when the speaker of the Lower House of the Maryland General Assembly received a number of letters from Massachusetts, one proposing a meeting of delegates from all the colonies, others objecting to British taxation without consent and proposing that Marylanders should be \\"free of any impositions, but such as they consent to by themselves or their representatives\\".Andrews, p. 277 Meanwhile, an Annapolis merchant by the name of Zachariah Hood, charged by the British with the task of collecting the new stamp duty, was injured at the dock on his return to Maryland by an angry crowd in what has been called the \\"first successful, forcible resistance in America to King George's authority\\".Andrews, p. 279 Shunned by his friends and fearful of his life, Hood fled Maryland for New York, and Governor Sharpe reported in September 1765 that he was \\"very apprehensive that if the stamp paper was to arrive here and be landed at this time it would not be in my power to preserve it from being burnt\\". Charles Carroll of Carrollton Maryland planter Charles Carroll of Carrollton was the only Roman Catholic to sign the Declaration of Independence. One of the early voices for independence in Maryland was the wealthy Roman Catholic planter Charles Carroll of Carrollton. In 1772 he engaged in a debate conducted through anonymous newspaper letters and maintained the right of the colonies to control their own taxation. As a Roman Catholic, he was barred from entering politics, from practicing law, and from voting. In the early 1770s, Carroll appears to have begun to embrace the idea that only violence could break the impasse with Great Britain. According to legend, Carroll and Samuel Chase (who would also later sign the Declaration of Independence on Maryland's behalf) had the following exchange: Writing in the Maryland Gazette under the pseudonym \\"First Citizen,\\" Carroll became a prominent spokesman against the governor's proclamation increasing legal fees to state officers and Protestant clergy. Carroll also served on various Committees of Correspondence, promoting independence.aoc.gov Article on Carroll at www.aoc.gov Retrieved May 7, 2010 From 1774 to 1776, Carroll was a member of the Annapolis Convention. He was commissioned with Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Chase and his cousin John Carroll in February 1774 to seek aid from Canada.Charles Carroll He was a member of Annapolis' first Committee of Safety in 1775. In early 1776, while not yet a member, the Congress sent him on a mission to Canada. When Maryland decided to support the open revolution, he was elected to the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and remained a delegate until 1778. He arrived too late to vote in favor of it, but was able to sign the Declaration of Independence. It is possible that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution - guaranteeing freedom of religion - was written in appreciation for Carroll's considerable financial support during the Revolutionary War. Carroll was the only Roman Catholic to sign the Declaration of Independence, and until his death in 1832 he was its last living signatory. Samuel Chase Samuel Chase, firebrand revolutionary and later a justice of the United States Supreme Court. Samuel Chase (1741‚Äì1811), was a \\"firebrand\\" states-righter and revolutionary, and was a signatory to the United States Declaration of Independence as a representative of Maryland. He co-founded Anne Arundel County's Sons of Liberty chapter with his close friend William Paca, and led opposition to the 1765 Stamp Act. Later he became an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Loyalist opposition Daniel Dulaney the Younger proposed \\"a legal, orderly, and prudent resentment\\" rather than war Public opinion in Maryland before the war was bitterly divided; many Marylanders either actively supported the Crown or were unwilling to countenance violence as a means of redress. In 1766, Samuel Chase became embroiled in a war of words with a number of Loyalist members of the Maryland political establishment in Annapolis. In an open letter dated July 18, 1766, Chase attacked Walter Dulany, George Steuart (1700‚Äì1784), John Brice (1705‚Äì1766), Michael MacNamara and others for publishing an article in the Maryland Gazette Extraordinary of June 19, 1766, in which Chase was accused of being: \\"a busy, reckless incendiary, a ringleader of mobs, a foul-mouthed and inflaming son of discord and faction, a common disturber of the public tranquility\\". In his response, Chase accused Steuart and the others of \\"vanity ... pride and arrogance\\", and of being brought to power by \\"proprietary influence, court favour, and the wealth and influence of the tools and favourites who infest this city.\\"Sanderson, John J, p. 67, Biography of the Signers To the Declaration of Independence, Volume 5, published by R W Pomery (1823). Retrieved Jan 21 2010 Such disputes would become increasingly bitter as war approached. One prominent Loyalist was Daniel Dulaney the Younger, Mayor of Annapolis, and an influential lawyer in the period immediately before the Revolution. Dulany was a noted opposer of the Stamp Act 1765, and wrote the noted pamphlet Considerations on the Propriety of Imposing Taxes in the British Colonies which argued against taxation without representation. The pamphlet has been described as \\"the ablest effort of this kind produced in America\\".Andrews, p. 284 In the pamphlet, Dulany summarized his position as follows: \\"There may be a time when redress may not be obtained. Till then, I shall recommend a legal, orderly, and prudent resentment\\". Eventually, as war became inevitable, Dulany (like many others) found his essentially moderate position untenable and he found himself forced to choose sides. Dulany was not able to rebel against the Crown he and his family had served so long. He believed that protest rather than force should furnish the solution to America's problems, and that legal process, logic, and the \\"prudent\\" exercise of \\"agreements\\" would eventually prevail upon the British to concede the colonists' demands. Coming of Revolution In 1774, committees of correspondence sprung up throughout the colonies, offering support to Boston, Massachusetts, after the British closed the port and increased the occupying military force. Massachusetts had asked for a general meeting or Continental Congress to consider joint action by all the colonies. To forestall any such action, the royal governor of Maryland, Sir Robert Eden prorogued the Maryland colonial assembly on April 19, 1774. This was the last session of the colonial assembly ever held in Maryland.

The event is still celebrated to this day each Memorial Day weekend with a festival and historic re-enactment known as the Chestertown Tea Party Festival.www.chestertownteaparty.com Retrieved May 9, 2010 Governor Eden returned to Maryland from England shortly after the Peggy Stewart was burned. On December 30, 1774, he wrote: > The spirit of resistance against the Tea Act, or any mode of internal > taxation, is as strong and universal here as ever.

Assembly of Freemen Thomas Johnson, Maryland's first elected governor under its 1776 Constitution. During this initial phase of the Revolutionary period, Maryland was governed by the Assembly of Freemen, an Assembly of the state's counties. The first convention lasted four days, from June 22 to June 25, 1774. All sixteen counties then existing were represented by a total of 92 members; Matthew Tilghman was elected chairman. The eighth session decided that the continuation of an ad-hoc government by the convention was not a good mechanism for all the concerns of the province. A more permanent and structured government was needed. So, on July 3, 1776, they resolved that a new convention be elected that would be responsible for drawing up their first state constitution, one that did not refer to parliament or the king, but would be a government \\"...of the people only.\\" After they set dates and prepared notices to the counties they adjourned. On August 1, all freemen with property elected delegates for the last convention. The ninth and last convention was also known as the Constitutional Convention of 1776. They drafted a constitution, and when they adjourned on November 11, they would not meet again. The Conventions were replaced by the new state government which the Maryland Constitution of 1776 had established. Thomas Johnson became the state's first elected governor. Declaration of Independence Maryland declared independence from Britain in 1776, with Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton signing the Declaration of Independence for the colony. In 1777, all Maryland voters were required to take the Oath of Fidelity and Support. This was an oath swearing allegiance to the state of Maryland and denying allegiance and obedience to Great Britain. As enacted by the Maryland General Assembly in 1777, all persons holding any office of profit or trust, including attorneys at law, and all voters were required to take the oath no later than March 1, 1778.John Thomas Scharf, History of Maryland from the Earliest Period to the Present Day. Published by J. B. Piet, 1879Carothers, Bettie S.; Maryland Oaths of Fidelity; It was signed by 3,136 residents of Montgomery and Washington counties.Daughters of the American Revolution Magazine. Daughters of the American Revolution, Published by R.R. Bowker Co., 1916 v. 50 1917 Jan‚ÄìJun On March 1, 1781, the Articles of Confederation took effect with Maryland's ratification. The articles had initially been submitted to the states on November 17, 1777, but the ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims to uncolonized land in the west. Maryland was the last hold-out; it refused to ratify until Virginia and New York agreed to rescind their claims to lands in what became the Northwest Territory. Maryland would later accept the United States Constitution more readily, ratifying it on April 28, 1788. Revolutionary War The 1st Maryland Regiment holds the line at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, March 15, 1781. Marylander John Hanson (1721‚Äì1783) was the first person to serve a full term as President of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation. Although no major Battles of the American Revolutionary War occurred in Maryland, this did not prevent the state's soldiers from distinguishing themselves through their service. General George Washington was impressed with the Maryland regulars (the \\"Maryland Line\\") who fought in the Continental Army and, according to one tradition, this led him to bestow the name \\"Old Line State\\" on Maryland.Maryland State Archive Online Today, the Old Line State is one of Maryland's two official nicknames. The state also filled other roles during the war. For instance, the Continental Congress met briefly in Baltimore from December 20, 1776, through March 4, 1777. Baltimore served as the temporary capital of the colonies when the Second Continental Congress met there during December 1776 to February 1777, (when Philadelphia was occupied by the British, meeting at the old \\"Henry Fite House\\", a substantial three-and-half story brick structure on the western edge of town (beyond the possible cannon range of any British Royal Navy ships that might try to force a passage upstream on the Patapsco River from the Chesapeake Bay to the Harbor), The building was later a tavern/hotel, then named \\"Congress Hall\\" after the sessions held there at Market Street (previously Long Street and later West Baltimore Street) and South Sharp-and later North Liberty Street. Marylander John Hanson served as President of the Continental Congress from 1781 to 1782. Hanson was the first person to serve a full term as President of the Congress under the Articles of Confederation. From November 26, 1783, to June 3, 1784, Annapolis served as the United States capital and the Confederation Congress met in the Maryland State House. (Annapolis was a candidate to become the new nation's permanent capital before Washington, D.C. was built). It was in the old senate chamber that George Washington resigned his commission as commander in chief of the Continental Army on December 23, 1783. It was also there that the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War, was ratified by Congress on January 14, 1784. Loyalists and the war Sir Robert Eden, last colonial Governor of Maryland During the war many Marylanders, such as Benedict Swingate Calvert, illegitimate son of the ruling Calvert family and a Judge of the Land Office, remained Loyal to the British Crown, and suffered the consequences. Calvert found himself on the losing side of the Revolutionary War, which would effectively end his political career. The Annapolis Convention of 1774 to 1776 would see the old Maryland elite overthrown. Men like Calvert, Governor Eden and George Steuart were all to lose their political power, and in many cases their land and wealth. On May 13, 1777 Benedict Swingate Calvert was forced to resign his position as Judge of the Land Office,Yentsch p. 269 and, as the conflict grew, he became fearful of his family's safety, writing in late 1777 that his family \\"has been made so uneasy by these frequent outrages\\" that he wished to \\"remove my family and property where I can get protection\\".Yentsch p. 272 Calvert did not leave Maryland, nor did he involve himself in the fighting, though he did on occasion supply the Continental Army with food and provisions. After the war, he had to pay triple taxes as did other Loyalists, but he was never forced to sign the loyalty oath and his lands and property remained unconfiscated.Yentsch p. 270 African Americans and the war British- American Black Loyalist foot soldiers. Slaves were promised freedom by the British in return for military service. The principal cause of the American Revolution was liberty, but only on behalf of white men, and certainly not slaves. The British, desperately short of manpower, sought to enlist African American soldiers to fight on behalf of the Crown, promising them liberty in exchange. As a result of the looming crisis in 1775 the Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, issued a proclamation that promised freedom to servants and slaves who were able to bear arms and join his Loyalist Ethiopian Regiment: About 800 men joined up; some helped rout the Virginia militia at the Battle of Kemp's Landing and fought in the Battle of Great Bridge on the Elizabeth River, wearing the motto \\"Liberty to Slaves\\", but this time they were defeated. The remains of their regiment were then involved in the evacuation of Norfolk, after which they served in the Chesapeake area. Unfortunately the camp that they had set up there suffered an outbreak of smallpox and other diseases. This took a heavy toll, putting many of them out of action for some time. The survivors joined other British units and continued to serve throughout the war. Blacks were often the first to come forward to volunteer and a total of 12,000 blacks served with the British from 1775 to 1783. This factor had the effect of forcing the rebels to also offer freedom to those who would serve in the Continental army. Such promises were often reneged upon by both sides.The Philipsburg Proclamation In general though, the war left the institution of slavery largely unaffected, and the prosperous life of Maryland planters continued. After the war The Official flag of the State of Maryland still retains the arms of the Calvert family, the Barons Baltimore. In 1783, Henry Harford, the last proprietarial governor of Maryland and the illegitimate son of Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore, attempted to recover his estates in Maryland which had been confiscated during the American Revolution, where he was a witness to George Washington's resignation of command at Annapolis. He and Governor Eden were invited to stay at the home of Dr. Upton Scott and his nephew, Francis Scott Key. However, he had no success in retrieving his land, in spite of the fact that Charles Carroll of Carrollton and Samuel Chase argued in his favor. In 1786, the case was decided by the Maryland General Assembly. Although it passed in the House, the Senate unanimously rejected it. In their reasoning for this rejection, the Senate cited Henry's absence during the war, and his father Frederick's alienation of his subjects, as major factors. Returning to Britain, he claimed compensation through the English courts and was awarded ¬£100,000. Some trace of the Calvert family's proprietarial rule in Maryland still remains. Frederick County, Maryland, is named after the last Baron Baltimore,Room, Adrian, p. 27, Dictionary of World Place Names Derived from British Names.

Windsor, Ontario was the first Canadian city with an electric street car system, which was introduced in 1886.Harry Black, Canadian Scientists and Inventors. Markham: Pembroke Publishers Limited, 1997. Other Canadian cities soon followed suit, with St. Catharines in 1887 and Toronto in 1889. By World War I, nearly 50 Canadian cities had streetcar systems in place.Kearney, Mark, and Randy Ray. Pucks, Pablum and Pingos. Canada: Dundurn Press, 2004. By the time Windsor's streetcar system was dismantled in 1937, the system's scale was extensive and it serviced all 5 of the major riverfront communities of Windsor, Ford City (East Windsor), Sandwich, Walkerville and Ojibway.  Early Beginnings  The streetcar system adopted by the city of Windsor and surrounding towns was developed by Charles J. Van Depoele.Schramm, Kenneth. Detroit's Street Railways. Chicago: Arcadia Publishing, 2006. Van Depoele had immigrated to Detroit, Michigan from Belgium in 1874 to develop his electric system. Windsor was the first city to adopt Van Depoele's system, as well as the first in Canada to have any type of electric streetcar system. Prior to the electric cars, a horse-drawn streetcar system had been in place since 1872. The new railway began development under two companies, the Windsor-Walkerville Street Railway Company and the Windsor- Sandwich Street Railway Company until the two merged in 1891 to later become the Sandwich, Windsor, and Amherstburg Street Railway (S.W. & A.R.). Van Depoele's electric streetcar first ran in Windsor on June 6, 1886, servicing the small town nestled south of the Detroit River.  Expansion  Although initially the track spanned only a small portion of Windsor along the Windsor- Detroit waterfront on Riverside Drive, the S.W.& A.R. began expanding its service southward with an extension along Ouellette Avenue in 1893.R. Markovich, \\"The Evolution of Public Transport Networks in Windsor, (Ontario), and London, (Ontario), 1872-1968.\\" MA diss., University of Windsor, 1971. The track started at the international ferry landing and went south, providing access to a popular race track, while simultaneously encouraging population growth south of the Detroit River where transportation was becoming readily available. The service began expanding from the small city of Windsor outward to the east and to the west to the towns of Sandwich, Walkerville, and East Windsor. Population was expanding in these areas largely due to the introduction of big industries in Windsor. Walkerville began expanding due to the Hiram Walker distillery and East Windsor because of the introduction of a Ford Factory in 1904.Kreipke, Robert C. Ford Motor Company: The First 100 Years. Turner Publishing Company, 2003. Subsequently, the S.W. & A.R. began expanding its track to these areas and to areas of dense population growth, creating access to much of the city and surrounding areas. People followed the track line, and the track line followed the people. Many Windsorites did not own automobiles, and found the streetcar a viable alternative to purchasing a new car. By 1921, the track had expanded to the towns of Amherstburg and Tecumseh at each end, measuring 37 miles in total. An additional track, the Windsor Essex and Lakeshore Hallway Company, operated between Leamington, Essex and Kingsville. As the automobile began rising in popularity and lowering in price, the use of the streetcars began to decline, despite the steady increase in population seen in Windsor at that time. In 1934, the company went out of business and its rails were incorporated into the system of the S.W.& A.R.  Disintegration  The electric streetcar system provided an extensive and effective mode of transportation to the citizens of Windsor until the 1930s, when the Great Depression left the world in financial turmoil. The streetcars were expensive to repair and were beginning to deteriorate, and because of costs S.W. & A.R. began to cut down some of the less-travelled and less-profitable routes on the track. The newly comprised City of Windsor, consisting of the Sandwich, Windsor, Walkerville, and East Windsor communities in 1935, was unable to bear the financial burden of the S.W. & A.R. Buses began to be considered a viable alternative to streetcars, because they were much less expensive to purchase.Plaut, Jonathon V. The Jews of Windsor, 1790-1990. Canada: Thistle Printing Limited, 2007. The S.W. & A.R. found that it would be less costly to purchase a set of buses than to repair the deteriorating rails. It was also thought by many that it was contradictory to continue using electric streetcars instead of automobiles in the automotive capital of Canada, where automobile ownership was rising and providing stiff competition to public transportation. In 1937 the City decided to abandon the streetcar system in favour of a city bus system. The last Windsor electric streetcar ran on May 7, 1939. The rails were removed from the ground and a city bus system has been in place ever since. The only remaining rails can be found at the intersection of Sandwich Street and Mill streets in Windsor. Also there is some more remaining rails that have been recently dug up at the intersection of Riverside and University street , one block west of the Ambassador bridge of the location of Huron church street, for the construction of a monument of Chief Tecumseh. Piece of track and spike and the brick laid under track Legacy The streetcar's carhouse, on University Avenue, where off-duty vehicles were stored and maintained, was to be converted into a restaurant as of 2015. One of the original vehicles, number 351, had recently been located, and the restaurant's owners agreed to pay to have the vehicle restored, if they could incorporate it into their restaurant's decor.

Delmore pointed to Grand River Transit's 2019 reinstatement of Light Rail in Kitchener-Waterloo, pointing out that at 22 million rides per year it had almost three times Transit Windsor's 8 million rides per year. He said current ridership didn't justify the expense of reinstatement.

Eight year bloom cycle and mass flowering The Strobilanthes callosa bush typically takes seven years to grow. It is only in its eighth year that it bursts into bloom. At that time the pink and white buds bear bright purple (purplish blue) flowers in a mass flowering which covers many forest areas with a colorful lavender blush of buds with a tinge of pink with its profusion of violet blooms, after this once in a lifetime mass flowering the bush finally dies out. The flowers are rich in pollen and nectar and attract a wide range of species of butterflies, birds and insects including honey bees and carpenter bees that come to feed on their nectar. Typically the lifespan of a single Strobilanthes callosa bloom lasts between 15 and 20 days and its mass blooming usually extends from mid-August to September-end. After the mass flowering, the shrub is covered with fruits which are dry by the next year. With the coming of the monsoon and the first rains in the next year, the dried fruits absorb moisture and burst open with a pop, the hillsides where Strobilanthes callosa grows are filled with these loud popping sounds of dried seed pods bursting open somewhat explosively dehiscing their seeds for dispersal and soon new plants germinate taking root in the wet forest floor. Masting Some species of Strobilanthes including this one are examples of a mass seeding phenomenon termed as masting which can be defined as \\"synchronous production of seed at long intervals by a population of plants\\",Janzen (1976) in Annul. Rev. Ecol. Syst., 7, 347-391 strict masting only occurs in species that are monocarpic (or semelparous) -- individuals of the species only reproduce once during their lifetime, then die.Strobilanthes callosus; Botany Photo of the Day ; Notes posted by Daniel Mosquin; January 13, 2009 Distribution Strobilanthes callosa which is mostly peculiar to the hills of the Western Ghats (Sahyadris) in India can be seen growing wild around Mumbai, Tansa, Khandala, Bhimashankar, Malshej Ghat, Basgadh, Anjaneri, Dhodap, Salher-Mulher (Nashik region), Mulshi, Aurangabad (common on the Kannad and Ajanta ghats), Konkan etc. in the state of Maharashtra, parts of the state of Madhya Pradesh, parts of the state of Gujarat and in large areas of and Uttara Kannada Ghats in the state of Karnataka among other places all along the Western Ghat hills on the west coast of India.

Control methods The following Western Ghats forestry report from the year 1908 of Ankola high forests in coastal Karnataka (then under Bombay Presidency), provides methods to clear and control this shrub, when required, from spreading uncontrollably into unwanted areas: Common in the hills near Mumbai The Karvi bush as it is locally known grows in abundance in the western ghat hills near the metropolis of Mumbai including throughout the Sanjay Gandhi National Park as in other parts of its natural range. In Sanjay Gandhi National Park its latest bloomings took place in 2000, then in 2008, and it is scheduled to bloom there again in 2016. Termed by nature enthusiasts as 'nature's miracle', its maximum bloom can be seen on some of the inner paths and trails that lie undisturbed in the park. It survives best on vast slopey expanses on the hillsides with Kanheri caves area of the national park being one of the best places to observe large blooming expanses. In the state of Maharashtra in the neighborhood of Mumbai the mass flowering of Karvi has been observed to occur in the same year as Mumbai in Khandala and one year earlier in Bhimashankar and Malshej, beyond Kalyan. Local conservation NGOs like the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and World Wide Fund for Nature - India (WWF-India) bring groups of city-dwelling people from Mumbai and elsewhere, sometimes in collaboration with other organizations, for regular nature walks in the nature trails of Sanjay Gandhi National ParkWet and Wild; by Nitya Kaushik; Jun 15, 2009; The Indian Express and organize special trips every eight years when the rare Karvi flowers are in full bloom. Near Mumbai, the Karvi is also found in Karnala, the Yeoor hills, Tungareshwar and some parts of Goregaon including Film City.

He played a major role in the revolt against Phocas that brought Heraclius to the throne, where he captured Egypt for his cousin. Nicetas remained governor of Egypt (or at least Alexandria) thereafter, and participated also in the Byzantine‚ÄìSassanid War of 602‚Äì628, but failed to stop the Sassanid conquest of Egypt ca. 618/619. He disappears from the sources thereafter, but possibly served as Exarch of Africa until his death.  Rebellion against Phocas and the conquest of Egypt  Nicetas was the son of the patrikios Gregoras, the brother of the Exarch of Africa Heraclius the Elder, under whom he served as magister militum in Africa. When Heraclius the Elder launched a rebellion against the usurper Phocas in 608, Nicetas and his father supported it. The Exarch's son, Heraclius the Younger, was the rebellion's candidate to replace Phocas, and with a fleet sailed directly for the imperial capital, Constantinople, which he seized on 5 October 610. At the same time, Nicetas, his forces augmented by Berber auxiliaries, undertook the overland conquest of the Cyrenaica and Egypt. The 9th-century Patriarch of Constantinople Nikephoros reports that the two cousins were involved in a \\"race\\" for Constantinople and the imperial throne, but this is clearly a legend. Nicetas' cause was aided by dissatisfied factions within Egypt itself, including the former prefect of Alexandria Theodore and his sons, probably the very wealthy and powerful Egyptian family of the Apiones, and even by prophecies and portents spread by holy men who opposed Phocas' tyranny. Cyrenaica fell easily, and Nicetas' deputy Bonakis was sent against Egypt with 3,000 Byzantines and many more Berber auxiliaries. According to the account of John of Nikiu, the prefect of the Mareotis was bribed to switch sides, and in a battle before Alexandria, Nicetas' forces defeated and killed Phocas' general. The city's populace rose up in support of Nicetas' forces, the Patriarch, governor and treasurer fled, and Nicetas had the populace proclaim his cousin as emperor. Bonakis was then dispatched to complete the conquest of the Nile Delta, but two garrisons, at Semanub and Athrib, resisted until Phocas sent a general, Bonosus, from Palestine to recover Egypt. Bonosus was initially successful, as he defeated, captured and executed Bonakis and seized Nikiu, where he executed several leading figures who had supported the rebellion. In the meantime, Alexandria was plagued by factional fighting between the Blues, who still supported Phocas, and the Greens, who supported the rebellion, but before long the Blues switched sides, and Nicetas was able to raise new troops and repel two attempts by Bonosus to capture the city. Dismayed, Bonosus retreated and eventually took ship from Pelusium to Constantinople. Following his departure, the Heraclians consolidated their control of Egypt, a process which was completed by the summer of 610.  Governorship of Egypt and the Persian war  From Egypt, Nicetas apparently marched on into Palestine to subdue the Phocas loyalists there, but soon returned to Egypt, where he was installed as governor. His exact office is unclear‚Äîhe is usually simply mentioned by his rank of patrikios, which he probably was given in 610‚Äîbut he was possibly dux et augustalis of Alexandria. As Walter Kaegi comments, in view of the mutual trust between Nicetas and Heraclius, this made eminent sense, since Egypt contributed some 30% of the praetorian prefecture of the East's annual income, and the new regime \\"would not have wished some other politically ambitious figure to stir up new unrest there as they had recently done themselves\\". At Egypt, Nicetas sponsored the election of John the Almsgiver as Patriarch of Alexandria, with whom he even became a ritual brother through the rite of adelphopoiesis. Later, in 615 or 616, he helped reconcile the Monophysite churches of Alexandria and Antioch, but it is unclear whether Nicetas remained continuously in office; at any rate, he was absent from Egypt for several extended periods. Thus in the summer of 612 he visited Constantinople, where he was received with great pomp. According to the Chronicon Paschale, he brought with him the Holy Sponge and the Holy Lance, which were the objects of special services held at the capital in autumn. Heraclius reportedly left control of the capital to Nicetas when he went to Cappadocia to meet Priscus, who was besieging the Sassanid Persians in Caesarea. During this time, according to the hagiography of Saint Theodore of Sykeon, Nicetas reputedly fell ill and was healed through the intercession of the saint. When Priscus was disgraced shortly after, on 5 December 612 Nicetas succeeded him as comes excubitorum, commander of the imperial bodyguard. In 613, Nicetas accompanied Heraclius in his campaign against the Persians, but the two cousins were defeated in the Battle of Antioch by Shahin Vahmanzadegan, a defeat which resulted in the rapid fall of Syria to the Persians. It appears, however, that Nicetas managed to win a costly victory near Emesa, possibly in 614. It is probably on this occasion that statues honouring him were erected in Constantinople. The Persian victories and the shortage of funds forced Nicetas to turn to his friend, the Patriarch John, for help, and requisition funds from the Alexandrian Church. Following the conquest of Syria and Palestine, the Persian general Shahrbaraz began the invasion of Egypt. Nicetas' role in preparing for and during the defence of the province, as well as the detailed course of the invasion, are unknown, but both he and Patriarch John fled Alexandria for Cyprus and then Rhodes, shortly before its fall to the Persians. Nicetas disappears from sources after this, but based on a later anecdote it has been suggested by Charles Diehl that he went on to govern Africa until his probable death in 628/9. Other scholars, however, including the editors of the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, consider this interpretation unlikely.  Family  Nicetas was the father of the Empress Gregoria, wife of Constantine III, and perhaps also of a patrikios Nicetas, attested in 639, and of the Exarch of Africa Gregory.  Heraclius of Edessa  His father was Gregorius, brother to Heraclius the Elder.Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, Vol. 3 Heraclius had been appointed Exarch of Africa by Maurice and lived to support the revolt of his son. But not to its conclusion. Gregorius seems to have served under the command of his brother but the extent of his role is unknown. The further ancestry of the two brothers, is uncertain. Cyril Mango in Deux √©tudes sur Byzance et la Perse Sassanide (1985) speculated they were descendants of Heraclius of Edessa, a general under Leo I and Zeno. He was appointed Comes rei militaris prior to 468. He assisted the Kingdom of Egrisi against the invasions of Peroz I of the Sassanids and Vakhtang I of Iberia but had to withdraw when his supply support proved insufficient.Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, Vol. 2 Heraclius of Edessa and Marcellinus led troops from Roman Egypt against Geiseric of the Vandals in 468. Their forces had successfully captured Sardinia and a number of cities in Tripolitania. They were marching to Carthage, the capital of the Vandals, when the main Roman force under Basiliscus was ambushed and defeated by Geiseric. One half of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and the other half followed the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily. According to Theophanes, Heraclius of Edessa sided with Leo I against his magister militum Aspar in 471. The conflict ended with the deaths of both Aspar and his son Ardabur by order of Leo. In 474, Heraclius served as magister militum per Thracias(Master of the Soldiers of Thrace) when he was captured in battle by Theodoric Strabo, a Goth chieftain formerly loyal to Aspar. He was executed by Theodoric despite the payment of a ransom for him by Zeno. Heraclius of Edessa is mentioned as son of Florus by Theophanes the Confessor. Theophanes identifies Florus as a consul but his name does not appear in consul lists. The explanation may be an honorary consulship. Another explanation suggested by Ernest Stein in Histoire du Bas-Empire (1951) was that Florus was another name for Flavius Florentius, a Roman Consul in 429.

January 27, 2006!\\"http://web2.uwindsor.ca/courses/philosophy/johnsoa/home.htm Accessed January 21st, 2010  Philosophy  As Johnson explains both in Logical Self- Defense as well as his journal article Making Sense of \\"Informal Logic,\\" that Informal Logic is the philosophical practice of understanding and evaluating natural language argumentation. Here fallacies are used in order to evaluate arguments. However, more simply the idea is to evaluate arguments based upon three essential criteria, again as explained in both Making Sense of \\"Informal Logic,\\" and more thoroughly explained in Logical Self-Defense, the premises of arguments must be relevant to the conclusion, sufficient to support it, and acceptable to the audience.2006 \\"Making Sense of 'Informal Logic,'\\" Informal Logic, Vol. 6, No. 23, pg. 237 In this approach to logic, fallacies such as the straw man, red herring etc. point to a deficiency in the premises in one of these three criteria. Johnson and Blair also place emphasis on how to identify arguments in everyday life, so that evaluators do not misinterpret the author's intention. In this way Logical Self-Defense identifies several different ways of interpreting arguments and their 'look-alikes'. For instance Johnson and Blair explain the distinctions between mere opinion, proto- argument, argument, case, and explanation as well as provide criteria for helping to identify which is which, including: context, verbal cues and logical structure.1994 Logical Self-Defense, Ralph H. Johnson and J. Anthony Blair. First U.S. Edition. New York: McGraw Hill. Pp. 5 - 28 In his article \\"Charity Begins at Home\\" in Informal Logic Johnson combines and creates unified form of the 'Principle of Charity' which he found to exist in four other forms in the following works: Thomas's Practical Reasoning in Natural Language (1973), Baum's Logic (1975) and in Scriven's Reasoning (1976). In doing so Johnson created a more developed 'Principle of Charity' which Informal Logicians could reference.1981 \\"Charity Begins at Home: Some Reflections on the Principle of Charity,\\" Informal Logic Newsletter, Vol. 3, No. 3, pp. 4‚Äì9. Accordingly, in this article Section II attempts to unify these four versions by making one the foundation, while the others work as its corollaries. Then, after creating a better account of the 'Principle of Charity' Johnson spends Section III of the article addresses some of the issues involved in the application of the 'Principle of Charity' and finally Section IV addresses a proposed restriction for the use of the 'Principle of Charity'.1981 \\"Charity Begins at Home: Some Reflections on the Principle of Charity,\\" Informal Logic Newsletter, Vol. 3, No. 3, pp. 4‚Äì9. In his article \\"The Principle of Vulnerability\\" in Informal Logic seeks to offer defence to the principle that all arguments should be considered susceptible to criticisms. As such Johnson argues that the arguer of an argument should not seek to \\"immunize\\" their argument from criticism. The article also takes considerations both in support of, and opposed to the principle into account.1995 \\"The Principle of Vulnerability,\\" Informal Logic, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 259‚Äì269 In this article one of the more notable ideas presented is the notion of 'manifest rationality' which Johnson described in this way: The practice (of arguing) is characterized by a trait I call manifest rationality. In the practice of argumentation, rationality is not merely the inner reality but also the outward appearance of the practice. The practice must not just be rational; it must also appear rational. This is why the Arguer is expected to respond to objections and criticisms from others, and not ignore them or sweep them under the carpet. It's not just that sweeping them aside would not be rational and hence not be in keeping with the spirit of the practice. It's that it would be such an obvious violation of it‚Äîand it would be seen to be such.1995 \\"The Principle of Vulnerability,\\" Informal Logic, Vol. 17, No. 2, pg. 259  References  Category:American logicians Category:Canadian philosophers Category:Living people Category:1940 births Category:Xavier University alumni Category:University of Notre Dame alumni Category:American emigrants to Canada ","title":"Ralph Johnson (philosopher)"},{"id":"25895691","text":"Karl Heinrich von Boetticher (6 January 1833 ‚Äì 6 March 1907) was a German conservative statesman.

It was formed in 2001 with the merger of the Scottish Chess Association (SCA) and the Scottish Junior Chess Association (SJCA). It is one of the oldest national chess associations in the world, the SCA having been founded in 1884. As the national organisation for chess, Chess Scotland is the affiliate to the International Chess Federation (FIDE) and appoints the Scottish delegate to FIDE's Council. Its International Director is responsible for selecting the teams which represent Scotland at the biennial Chess Olympiad. Objective and functions Its principal objective is to \\"foster and promote the game of chess throughout Scotland among players of all ages\\". Its principal functions are: *to represent the interests of Scottish chess (at FIDE and elsewhere), *to select individuals and teams to represent Scotland at international chess events, *to hold national and international chess tournaments in Scotland *to promote the game of chess in Scotland *to train and appoint officials * to operate a national grading system Chess Scotland's functions are performed by unpaid volunteers and is registered as a non-profit organisation. Its turn- over in 2009 was approximately ¬£35,000, of which a third was provided by the Scottish Government via annual grant aid. In 2013 the Government grant ceased. Membership Many people can play chess and a significant proportion of these have an active interest in the game (e.g., internet chess, parents/guardians of junior players, etc.). The number of players currently known to CS is more than 5000, of whom about half are juniors. Approximately 3000 currently-active players have played sufficient games in official events (not necessarily events organized by CS) to be assigned a national rating (grade) for their standard of play. Chess Scotland therefore serves a very wide constituency from school children to International Grandmasters. Organisation The affairs of Chess Scotland are managed by its directors and other officials who work (with other promoters, as appropriate) to fulfil the objectives of the organisation. Most of these posts are filled by election at the Annual General Meeting of Chess Scotland. Chess events are supervised by certified arbiters who must undergo written and practical competency tests administered by Chess Scotland. Chess Scotland also maintains a register of approved coaches and chaperons. All of these officials (arbiters, coaches and chaperons) are required to undergo ‚ÄúDisclosure‚Äù certification, under Scottish Child Protection legislation. Online Apart from the publicity surrounding its events, Chess Scotland's activities are communicated to the general public (including children) and to its sponsors via its internet web-pages. An on- line forum promotes discussion of chess-related topics of current interest. In addition, Chess Scotland publishes a magazine which appears six times a year. Rating system The Chess Scotland on-line rating system is important for many players, and the rating system is a source of significant revenue to Chess Scotland. Application to Chess Scotland for the recognition of an event (or player) for rating purposes brings the event (or player) within the jurisdiction of Chess Scotland.

Most of his cricket was played at Minor Counties level for Dorset between 1912 and 1939, but he also appeared in first-class cricket for Hampshire in 1919 and then occasionally for amateur sides in the 1920s. While still a schoolboy at Marlborough College, Busk made his county cricket debut for Dorset in the Minor Counties Championship against Berkshire in 1912. He played nine times for Dorset up to the 1914 match against Berkshire, which turned out to be the final match of the season for Dorset, with all the side's cricket then cancelled owing to the beginning of the First World War. After the First World War, Busk made his first-class debut for Hampshire against the touring Australian Imperial Forces cricket team in 1919. He played one County Championship match for Hampshire in the same season, against Surrey. Busk took two wickets at a bowling average of 62.50. Busk played for the Marylebone Cricket Club in two first-class matches against the British Army and Scotland in 1920 and 1922. He made his highest first-class score of 43 against the Army and with the ball Busk took eight wickets in his two MCC matches at a bowling average of 28.62, with best figures of 4-60 against Scotland. In addition, he played for a West of England side in 1927 against the touring New Zealanders. In 1920 Busk returned to playing for Dorset in the Minor Counties Championship, playing his return match against the Kent Second XI.

R. Bommai v. Union of India ([1994] 2 SCR 644 : AIR 1994 SC 1918 : (1994)3 SCC1) was a landmark judgment of the Supreme Court of India, where the Court discussed at length provisions of Article 356 of the Constitution of India and related issues. This case had huge impact on Centre-State Relations. The judgement attempted to curb blatant misuse of Article 356 of the Constitution of India, which allowed President's rule to be imposed over state governments. Background Article 356 deals with imposition of President's Rule over a State of India. When a state is under President's Rule, the elected state government (led by the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers) is dismissed and Council of ministers is suspended at legislature, and administration is conducted directly by the Governor of the state. The Governor is an appointee of the President and thus, effectively, a functionary of the Union Government (the central or federal government). Thus imposition of President's Rule negates the federal character of the Indian political system, where administration usually is shared between the Union and State governments. It also militates against the democratic doctrine of popular sovereignty, since an elected government is suspended. These reasons have made use of Article 356 controversial. Nevertheless, it was used repeatedly by central governments to suspend state governments (of opposite political parties) based on genuine reasons or trumped-up excuses. Bhimrao Ambedkar, chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of India, referred to Article 356 as a dead letter of the Constitution. In the constituent assembly debate it was suggested that Article 356 is liable to be abused for political gains. Ambedkar replied, \\"I share the sentiments that such articles will never be called into operation and they would remain a dead letter. If at all they are brought into operation, I hope the President, who is endowed with these powers, will take proper precautions before actually suspending the administration of the provinces. I hope the first thing he will do would be to issue a mere warning to a province that has erred, that things were not happening in the way in which they were intended to happen in the Constitution. If that warning fails, the second thing for him to do will be to order an election allowing the people of the province to settle matters by themselves. It is only when these two remedies fail that he would resort to this article.\\" But this was never the case and before the judgement in Bommai case, Article 356 has been repeatedly abused to dismiss the State Governments controlled by a political party opposed to ruling party at centre. Provision for suspension of elected governments has been used on more than 90 occasions and in most of the cases, it appeared to be of doubtful constitutional validity, as mentioned by B. P. Jeevan Reddy during one of his interviews in 1998. The Facts Bommai v. Union of India came before the bench of 9 judges (consisting of Kuldip Singh, P. B. Sawant, Katikithala Ramaswamy, S. C. Agarwal, Yogeshwar Dayal, B. P. Jeevan Reddy, S. R. Pandian, A. M. Ahmadi, J. S. Verma) under the following circumstances: Karnataka The Janata Party being the majority party in the Karnataka State Legislature had formed Government under the leadership of S. R. Bommai. In September 1988, the Janata Party and Lok Dal merged into a new party called Janata Dal. The Ministry was expanded with addition of 13 members. Within two days thereafter, K.R. Molakery, a legislator of Janata Dal defected from the party. He presented a letter to the Governor Pendekanti Venkatasubbaiah along with 19 letters, allegedly signed by legislators supporting the Ministry, withdrawing their support. As a result, on 19 April, the Governor sent a report to the President stating therein there were dissensions and defections in the ruling party. He further stated that in view of the withdrawal of the support by the said legislators, the chief Minister, Bommai did not command a majority in the Assembly and, hence, it was inappropriate under the Constitution, to have the State administered by an Executive consisting of Council of Ministers which did not command the majority in the state assembly. He, therefore, recommended to the President that he should exercise power under Article 356(1). However, on the next day seven out of the nineteen legislators who had allegedly written the said letters to the Governor sent letters to him complaining that their signatures were obtained on the earlier letters by misrepresentation and affirmed their support to the Ministry. The Chief Minister and his Law Minister met the Governor the same day and informed him about the decision to summon the Assembly, even by bringing forward the scheduled session, to prove the confidence of assembly in his Ministry. To the same effect, he sent a telex message to the President. The Governor however sent yet another report to the President on the same day i.e., 20-4-1989, and stated that the Chief Minister had lost the confidence of the majority in the House and repeated his earlier request for action under Article 356(1). On that very day, the President issued the Proclamation in question with the recitals already referred to above. The Proclamation was, thereafter approved by the Parliament as required by Article 356(3). A writ petition was filed on 26 April 1989 challenging the validity of the proclamation. A special bench of 3 judges of Karnataka High Court dismissed the writ petition. Meghalaya On 11 October 1991 the president issued a proclamation under Article 356(1) dismissing the government of Meghalaya and dissolving the legislative assembly. The Proclamation stated that the President was satisfied on the basis of the report from the Governor and other information received by him that the situation had arisen in which the Government of the State could not be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The Government was dismissed and the Assembly was dissolved accordingly. Nagaland On 7 August 1988, the president issued the proclamation on the basis of Governor Report and dismissed the Government of Nagaland thus dissolving the Legislative assembly. Vamuzo, leader of opposition party, challenged the validity of Proclamation in Gauhati High Court. A Division Bench comprising the Chief Justice and Hansaria, J. heard the petition. The Bench differed on the effect and operation of Article 74 (Constitution of India)(2) and hence the matter was referred to the third Judge. But before the third learned judge could hear the matter, the Union of India led by Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party moved this Court for grant of special leave which was granted and the proceedings in the High Court were stayed. Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh On account of the Babri Masjid demolition, communal riots spread out in the entire country. The Central Government under the leadership of Shri P V Narsimharao of the Congress party banned RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal. The Central Government dismissed the BJP Governments of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. As a result, on 15 December 1992, the president issued the proclamation under Article 356 dismissing the State Governments and dissolving the Legislative Assemblies of Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. The validity of these proclamations was challenged by the Writs in the appropriate High Courts. The Madhya Pradesh High Court allowed the petition, but writ petition relating to Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh were withdrawn to Supreme Court. All the above said petition contained similar question of law and therefore they were heard conjointly by the Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court. The arguments in the S.R. Bommai‚Äôs case commenced in the first week of October 1993 and were concluded in the last week of December 1993. The Contentions S. R. Bommai v. Union of India raised serious question of law relating to Proclamation of President's Rule and dissolution of Legislative assemblies according to Article 356 of the Constitution of India. The first and most important question which the Supreme Court had to determine was whether the Presidential Proclamation under Article 356 was justiciable and if so to what extent. The second contention was whether the President has unfettered powers to issue Proclamation under Article 356(1) of the Constitution. It was contended that since the Proclamation under Article 356[1] would be issued by the President on the advice of the Council of Ministers given under Article 74(1) of the Constitution and since Clause [2] of the said Article bars inquiry into the question whether any, and if so, what advice was tendered by Ministers to the President, judicial review of the reasons which led to the issuance of the Proclamation also stands barred. Whether the Legislature dissolved by the Presidents proclamation can be revived if the president proclamation is set aside. Whether the validity of the Proclamation issued under Article 356(1) can be challenged even after it has been approved by both Houses of Parliament under Article 356(3). It was also contended that whether any relief‚Äôs can be granted when the validity of proclamation is challenged and whether the court can grant an interim stay against holding the fresh election. Whether a president can dissolve the legislature without having obtained the approval of both the Houses of the Legislature. It was contended that Secularism being a basic feature of the Constitution, a State government can be dismissed if it is guilty of nonsecular acts. The Principles laid down by Supreme Court The SC laid down certain guidelines so as to prevent the misuse of Article 356 of the constitution. # The majority enjoyed by the Council of Ministers shall be tested on the floor of the House. # Centre should give a warning to the state and a time period of one week to reply. # The court cannot question the advice tendered by the CoMs to the President but it can question the material behind the satisfaction of the President. Hence, Judicial Review will involve three questions only: a. Is there any material behind the proclamation b. Is the material relevant. c. Was there any malafide use of power. # If there is improper use of Article 356 then the court will provide remedy. # Under Article 356(3) it is the limitation on the powers of the President. Hence, the president shall not take any irreversible action until the proclamation is approved by the Parliament i.e. he shall not dissolve the assembly. # Article 356 is justified only when there is a breakdown of constitutional machinery and not administrative machinery Article 356 shall be used sparingly by the center, otherwise it is likely to destroy the constitutional structure between the center and the states. Even Bhimrao Ambedkar envisaged it to remain a 'dead letter' in the constitution. Based on the report of the Sarkaria Commission on Centre‚Äìstate Relations(1988), the Supreme Court in Bommai case (1994) enlisted the situations where the exercise of power under Article 356 could be proper or improper. Imposition of President‚Äôs Rule in a state would be proper in the following situations: *Where after general elections to the assembly, no party secures a majority, that is, Hung Assembly. *Where the party having a majority in the assembly declines to form a ministry and the governor cannot find a coalition ministry commanding a majority in the assembly. *Where a ministry resigns after its defeat in the assembly and no other party is willing or able to form a ministry commanding a majority in the assembly. *Where a constitutional direction of the Central government is disregarded by the state government. *Internal subversion where, for example, a government is deliberately acting against the Constitution and the law or is fomenting a violent revolt. *Physical breakdown where the government willfully refuses to discharge its constitutional obligations endangering the security of the state. The imposition of President‚Äôs Rule in a state would be improper under the following situations: *Where a ministry resigns or is dismissed on losing majority support in the assembly and the governor recommends imposition of President‚Äôs Rule without probing the possibility of forming an alternative ministry. *Where the governor makes his own assessment of the support of a ministry in the assembly and recommends imposition of President‚Äôs Rule without allowing the ministry to prove its majority on the floor of the Assembly. *Where the ruling party enjoying majority support in the assembly has suffered a massive defeat in the general elections to the Lok Sabha such as in 1977 and 1980. *Internal disturbances not amounting to internal subversion or physical breakdown. *Maladministration in the state or allegations of corruption against the ministry or stringent financial exigencies of the state. *Where the state government is not given prior warning to rectify itself except in case of extreme urgency leading to disastrous consequences. *Where the power is used to sort out intra-party problems of the ruling party, or for a purpose extraneous or irrelevant to the one for which it has been conferred by the Constitution. Malafide exercise of Article 356 While dealing with the question as to whether the Presidential Proclamation under Article 356 was justiciable all the judges were unanimous in holding that the presidential proclamation was justiciable. The Supreme Court held that the proclamation under Article 356(1) is not immune from judicial review. The validity of the Proclamation issued by the President under Article 356(1) is judicially reviewable to the extent of examining whether it was issued on the basis of any material at all or whether the material was relevant or whether the Proclamation was issued in the malafide exercise of the power. The Supreme Court or the High court can strike down the proclamation if it is found to be malafide or based on wholly irrelevant or extraneous grounds. The deletion of Clause (5) by the 44th Amendment Act, removes the cloud on the reviewability of the action. When a prima facie case is made out in the challenge to the Proclamation, the Union of India has to produce the material on the basis of which action was taken. It cannot refuse to do so, if it seeks to defend the action. The court will not go into the correctness of the material or its adequacy. Its inquiry is limited to whether the material was relevant to the action. Even if part of the material is irrelevant, the court cannot interfere so long as there is some material which is relevant to the action taken. It is submitted that the validity of the Presidents proclamation under Article 356 is justiciable. Powers of President under Article 356 The second question which was taken into consideration by the court was that whether the President has unfettered powers to issue Proclamation under Article 356(1) of the Constitution of India. It was contended that The Supreme Court in this regard held that the power conferred by Article 356 upon the President is a conditioned power. It is not an absolute power. This satisfaction may be formed on the basis of the report of the Governor or on the basis of other information received by him or both. The existence of relevant material is a pre-condition to the formation of satisfaction. The satisfaction must be formed on relevant material. The dissolution of the Legislative Assembly should be resorted to only when it is necessary for achieving the purposes of the proclamation. The exercise of the power is made subject to approval of the both Houses of Parliament. Article 74 and Justiciability of advice of Council of Ministers to President In regard to the contention, that Article 74(2) bars the inquiry into advice which was tendered by Council of Ministers to the President, the Supreme Court at length considered the scope and effect of Article 74(2). Here it would be appropriate to mention that article 74(2) of the constitution provides that the court cannot inquire as to any, and if so what, advice was tendered by Council of Ministers to the President. In this regard Supreme Court held that although Article 74(2) bars judicial review so far as the advice given by the Ministers is concerned, it does not bar scrutiny of the material on the basis of which the advice is given. The material on the basis of which advice was tendered does not become part of the advice. The Courts are justified in probing as to whether there was any material on the basis of which the advice was given, and whether it was relevant for such advice and the President could have acted on it. Hence when the Courts undertake an inquiry into the existence of such material, the prohibition contained in Article 74(2) does not negate their right to know about the factual existence of any such material. This is not to say that the Union Government cannot raise the plea of privilege under Section 123 of the Evidence Act. As and when such privilege against disclosure is claimed, the Courts will examine such claim within the parameters of the said section on its merits. But Article 74(2) as such is no bar to the power of judicial review regarding the material on the basis of which the proclamation is issued. Invalidation of Proclamation The Supreme Court also held that the power of the court to restore the government to office in case it finds the proclamation to be unconstitutional, it is, in Courts opinion, beyond question. Even in case the proclamation is approved by the Parliament it would be open to the court to restore the State government to its office in case it strikes down the proclamation as unconstitutional. If this power were not conceded to the court, the very power of judicial review would be rendered nugatory and the entire exercise meaningless. If the court cannot grant the relief flowing from the invalidation of the proclamation, it may as well decline to entertain the challenge to the proclamation altogether. For, there is no point in the court entertaining the challenge, examining it, calling upon the Union Government to produce the material on the basis of which the requisite satisfaction was formed and yet not give the relief. Powers of Parliament Moreover, the Supreme Court firmly held that there was no reason to make a distinction between the Proclamation so approved and legislation enacted by the Parliament. If the Proclamation is invalid, it does not stand validated merely because it is approved of by the Parliament. The grounds for challenging the validity of the Proclamation may be different from those challenging the validity of legislation. However, that does not make any difference to the vulnerability of the Proclamation on the limited grounds available. And therefore the validity of the Proclamation issued under Article 356(1) can be challenged even after it has been approved by both Houses of Parliament under Article 356(3). Elections to Legislature pending final Disposal of case Another issue taken into consideration by the Supreme Court was whether any relief can be granted when the validity of proclamation is challenged and whether the court can grant an interim stay against holding the fresh election. In this regard the Court held that the Court will have power by an interim injunction, to restrain the holding of fresh elections to the Legislative Assembly pending the final disposal of the challenge to the validity of the proclamation to avoid the fait accompli and the remedy of judicial review being rendered fruitless. Secularism Supreme Court while adjudicating that a State Government cannot follow particular religion discussed at length the concept of Secularism. The Court held that Secularism is one of the basic features of the Constitution. Secularism is a positive concept of equal treatment of all religions. This attitude is described by some as one of neutrality towards religion or as one of benevolent neutrality. While freedom of religion is guaranteed to all persons in India, from the point of view of the State, the religion, faith or belief of a person is immaterial. To the state, all are equal and are entitled to be treated equally. In matters of State, religion has no place. And if the Constitution requires the State to be secular in thought and action, the same requirement attaches to political parties as well. The Constitution does not recognize, it does not permit, mixing religion and State power. Both must be kept apart. That is the constitutional injunction. None can say otherwise so long as this Constitution governs this country. Politics and religion cannot be mixed. Any State government which pursues nonsecular policies or nonsecular course of action acts contrary to the constitutional mandate and renders itself amenable to action under Article 356. Given the above position, it is clear that if any party or organization seeks to fight the elections on the basis of a plank which has the proximate effect of eroding the secular philosophy of the Constitution would certainly be guilty of following an unconstitutional course of action. Implications and Criticism This case in the history of the Indian Constitution has great implications on Centre-State Relations. It is in this case that the Supreme Court boldly marked out the paradigm and limitations within which Article 356 has to function. The Supreme Court said that Article 356 is an extreme power and is to be used as a last resort in cases where it is manifest that there is an impasse and the constitutional machinery in a State has collapsed. The views expressed by the court in this case are similar to the concern showed by the Sarkaria Commission. The principles laid down in this case put a bar on the dismissal of the state government by the centre for political gains. It was in this case that the court firmly laid down certain provision relating to Presidential proclamation issued Under Article 356. The Court held that Presidential proclamation under Article 356 is not absolute and the power conferred by Article 356 on president is conditioned power. The Supreme Court held that presidential proclamation is not immune from judicial review. Moreover, if the presidential proclamation is held unconstitutional, the legislature dissolved by the presidential proclamation can be revived. It was also contended that the Articles 74(2) bars the court from inquiring about the material on the basis of which the proclamation is issued, but the court rejected this contention. In spite of such bold and illustrious judgement delivered by the Supreme Court, people criticized that the Court took such a long time to deliver the verdict and allowed, in the cases of Karnataka and Meghalaya, the illegality to be perpetuated and ultimately deprive the citizens of those states to be governed by their chosen representative. Still, the judgement delivered by the Supreme Court put a check on arbitrary dismissal of state governments in future and strengthen the federal structure of Indian polity which had hitherto been damaged on several occasions particularly when different political parties were in power at the Centre and the State.

On 5 January 2010 he was appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary General in the Central African Republic. This appointment is in addition to the nominations in October 2009 as the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, as well as UNDP Resident Representative in the country. Since 1985 he has been working for United Nations primarily in the humanitarian field. Biography Bo Schack finished his Law Degree from the University of Copenhagen in 1982. He joined the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in August 1985 after having worked as an Associate Attorney in Copenhagen and with the Danish Ministry of Industry. In addition between 1983 and 1984 he studied International Law at the European College in Bruges, Belgium and obtained in 1998 a master's degree in Business Administration (MBA) from the Open University Business School, United Kingdom. Between 1985 and until the appointment as Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary General, Bo Schack was working for UNHCR in a number of legal and protection oriented functions starting in Senegal, (1985 to 1988), Hong Kong, (1988 to 1991), UNHCR Headquarters, Asia Bureau, (1991 to 1994), the UNHCR Special Operation in the former Yugoslavia (1994 to 1997), Sri Lanka (1997 to 2000). In 2000 he was appointed to Iran as the Deputy Representative before after a three years assignment being appointed in 2003 as Head of the Policy Unit, Europe Bureau, UNHCR Headquarters. From 2007 to 2009 he was the UNHCR Representative in Burundi. The years with UNHCR allowed Bo Schack important humanitarian and management experience from a number of regions in the world. The functions were mainly associated with negotiations involving all those affected by or involved in refugee situations, internal displacement and repatriation operations. In particular this has been related to the status and treatment of refugees and internally displaced, access for humanitarian assistance, negotiations on agreements linked to voluntary repatriation and return of displaced. The responsibilities took a turn towards more broader UN involvement in 2007 with the focus in Burundi on more development oriented reintegration programmes for Burundian refugees coming home from primarily Tanzania.Summary from Peacebuilding Commission, Burundi Configuration, Thematic Meeting on Land Issues in Burundi, 27 May 2008 This extensive experience in the many areas of the United Nations work will be important for his functions in the Central African Republic within the newly established United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA). The primary role of the United Nations in the country are linked to further initiatives for the consolidation of the peace, the support to the government in development of the country as well as coordinating the continuing humanitarian assistance being provided by UN Agencies and non- governmental organisations (NGOs). On 1 September 2015, he was appointed Director of Operations for UNRWA (The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the near east) in Gaza. He has four children.

Shortly after feminist ideology started gaining popularity in the mid-19th and early 20th century in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States, and slowly the rest of the world, the movement begun affecting changes to the social and political life of Greece. In 1952, Greek women gained the right to vote.Stamiris, Eleni. 1986 The Women's Movement in Greece. New Left Review I. 1(158): 98‚Äì112. However, other changes did not come until a few decades later, as with, for example, the introduction of sweeping changes in family law in 1983 (see below). Greece signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and ratified it in 1983. In the larger cities of Greece, such as Athens, women have a more integrated role in society and the community; however, in the rural areas of Greece there is a strong patriarchal tradition.Mills, Janine. (2003) \\"Freedom and Power: The Debate over the Position of Greek Women.\\" Women's Studies: An Inter-disciplinary Journal. 32(1): 1547‚Äì7045. One of the underlying ideas that fuel this structure is that women are \\"naturally\\" associated with the domestic area of the workforce, which carries a smaller weight than the larger workforce that men are typically involved in.Dubisch, Jill. (1983) \\"Greek Women: Sacred or Profane.\\" Journal of Modern Greek Studies. 185‚Äì202. In the home Traditionally, the domestic arena was where a Greek woman's responsibility was. Whether they were dealing with household chores or cooking for the family, Greek women efficiently carried out their duties in the home. The house was such an important factor in the life of a Greek woman, that people often compared the cleanliness of the living space to the character of the woman that inhabited it. Rural areas in particular have been very conservative on gender roles. According to Mills, the traditional perception of women in rural Greece is that a woman's time outside the house is a potential threat to the family's honor. This perception stems from a fundamental Greek belief that a man's honor relied heavily upon the purity and modesty of his wife, sister, and daughters. As for family law, in 1983, a new family law was passed, which provided for gender equality in marriage, and abolished dowry and provided for equal rights for \\"illegitimate\\" children.Marcos, Anastasios C, and Bahr, Stephen J. 2001 Hellenic (Greek) Gender Attitudes. Gender Issues. 19(3):21‚Äì40.Demos, Vasilikie. (2007) \\"The Intersection of Gender, Class and Nationality and the Agency of Kytherian Greek Women.\\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. 11 August. The new family law also provided for civil marriage and liberalized the divorce law. Adultery was also decriminalized in 1983. Law 3719/2008 further dealt with family issues, including Article 14 of the law, which reduced the separation period (necessary before a divorce in certain circumstances) from 4 years to 2 years.http://www2.ohchr.org/English/bodies/cedaw/docs/54/CEDAW-C-GRC-7.pdf In regards to reproduction, the future and size of a family has been traditionally seen as dependent on the wishes of the husband. In a countrywide study by Yannis Tauntas et al., the majority of women in Greece felt that contraception was the responsibility of the man. Placing the responsibility of family planning in the man's hands is largely due to a view of passive sexuality in which Greek women refer to themselves as \\"becoming impregnated, without taking part in the process. \\" Within the home, the woman is responsible for raising and nurturing the children while her husband is at work. This falls within the realm of her domestic duties in the home. One piece of control that women often control is the finances. Although many women do not have jobs within the formal work sector, they still budget and govern the income. Traditionally, domestic violence was considered a largely private issue, but in the past decades the views have changed. In 2006, Greece enacted Law 3500/2006 -\\"For combating domestic violence\\"- which criminalized domestic violence, including marital rape. Greece ratified in 2009 the Lanzarote Convention, the first international treaty that addresses child sexual abuse that occurs within the home or family.http://www.mzv.cz/coe.strasbourg/en/news/ceska_republika_podepsala_lanzarotskou.html Greece also ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in 2014. In the workforce Gender pay gap in average gross hourly earnings according to Eurostat 2014.European Commission. The situation in the EU. Retrieved on 12 July 2011. Greece still has one of the highest gender pay gaps in Europe. Efharis Petridou was the first female lawyer in Greece; in 1925 she joined the Athens Bar Association. In 1955, women were first allowed to become judges in Greece. According to data by UNICEF, 52% of the Greek population is made up of women. According to World Bank, the proportion of the labor force that is female increased from 36.1% in 1990 to 44.1% in 2019.http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS In 2001, Greece had the second largest gender employment gap of the European Union. Of the women that have jobs within the formal sector, most of them live in large urban cities. Within the rural areas of Greece, women have found it particularly difficult to receive jobs in any area other than farm work. The low number of women that have jobs in rural communities could partially be due to the high levels of sexual harassment that they face on the job site. Another explanation for low involvement in the workforce is that adequate laws protecting women from sexual violence were not enacted until 1984. Although the percentage of women in the workplace is lower than in many other European countries, the presumptions and attitudes towards what entails a job that are what make this statistic unsettling. As previously stated, in rural communities there are much fewer women in the workforce; however, many of these women have full-time jobs. Because a woman's time outside of the home setting is limited, many women have found that renting rooms within their house or setting up an in house hotel can generate a sufficient income. These rural community women can also earn an income as house cleaners, seamstresses, or by running tourist shops. These jobs are extensions of a woman's domestic work and can be easily balanced while carrying out the daily duties within the home. Ironically, their side occupations can earn a greater income than the money that is generated from the man's job. However, in small countryside societies like Kokkari, Greece, women's work is not considered \\"real\\" labor and thus has less symbolic value than a man's job. While this is a generalization that is widespread in smaller town societies, it is outdated in larger metropolises. In the 21st century, Greece has also addressed several other problems that women face in the workplace. For example, in response to the EU Directive 2002/73/EC, Greece enacted Law 3488/2006 against discrimination in employment and occupation, on the basis of sex or marital status, and against sexual harassment.http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:13100:0::NO::P13100_COMMENT_ID:2303814 hola In religion Religious life is considered a fundamental aspect of life for a significant portion of the Greek population. According to a 2005 poll, 81% of Greeks believed that there is a God. This percentage made Greece the third highest-ranking country in the European Union for this poll. Additionally, the Greek Orthodox faith is recognized as the dominant religion in Greek society. In both urban and rural communities, women play an active role in Greek religion and in general women are more avid churchgoers than men. The idea of women being more dedicated to their attendance at church is seen across the Mediterranean. Despite women's consistency in attending church, tradition (not the official church) restricts women due to their unique physiological processes. The tradition that a woman is not allowed to enter the church during her menstrual cycle or for forty days after she has given birth is still observed today; however, it is becoming less common among younger women. During these times, women are known to stand outside of the church and listen to the message. Traditionally, women occupied the left side of the nave of the Church and men the right side. This tradition is fast disappearing, easily noted if one attends Greek Orthodox Church services today. In politics  For many countries, including Greece, the idea of women in politics was until recently a controversial topic. The entering of women into the political arena has been very slow.Stefanidou, Xenia. (2007) \\"Greek Women in Positions of Power.\\" Paper presented at the Hellenic American Professional Society Annual Meeting. 4 November. Because of this weak representation of women in politics, Greece traditionally ranked at the bottom of the list for women's involvement in the government. Greek women's limited participation in politics suggests that the stereotype of women being better suited for a domestic environment is still widespread in both rural and urban communities. However, women have made strides within the past few years, and in the 2004 election a woman named Prof. Helen Louri was appointed as Senior Economic Advisor to the Prime Minister.Tsaoussis, Hatzis. (2004) International Association for Feminist Economics: Greece. In recent years, the proportion of women in politics has increased rapidly, and as of 2014 there were 21.0% women in parliament.

The iLane system provides any automobile access to cloud and locally stored content from the user's BlackBerry through the smartphone's digital wireless network. Using a variety of applications, iLane sends audio-only content to any Bluetooth audio device including a Bluetooth headset. The iLane platform uses the latest advances in text-to-speech (or speech synthesis) and speech recognition to let the driver control the infotainment system by voice only. Applications The iLane platform's most popular applications is email, it reads the user's email aloud through a Bluetooth audio device. It also has apps for smartphone calendar data, news, sports and weather by location, all controlled by the user's voice. Most recently IMS has added an app that lets the driver send and receive SMS text messages. Features The system is compatible with any email or web-mail account added to the BlackBerry messaging system including G-mail, Yahoo and Hotmail as well as any BIS or BES email account already registered on the BlackBerry device. The system receives online content using a secure connection to IMS servers through a mobile gateway which is downloaded from IMS to the BlackBerry device and then continues to use the secure BlackBerry wireless network. Local Bluetooth-to-smartphone security is provided by 256-bit encryption from the smartphone to the audio device but is also encrypted 512-bit on the device before it is broadcast Advanced Encryption Standard. Critical reception iLane has received industry recognition including Andrew Seybold Choice Awards for 2009 and 2010.https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS105137+10-Mar-2009+PRN200903108 and was named CTIA Hot For The Holidays in both 2009 and 2010 Award Winner for \\"Hottest Bluetooth Accessory.\\" The device has received widely positive media reviews for its operation and ease of use. David Pogue of the NY Times calls it: \\"‚Ä¶ingenious, polished and efficient.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/technology/personaltech/19pogue.html The widest criticism about iLane, has been related to discomfort interacting with a voice-controlled system and the unit‚Äôs cost with the inclusion of a monthly fee. IMS has since lowered iLane‚Äôs retail price. Distribution Hands-free legislation across North America has provided increased interest in iLane and similar in-car telematics systems offering voice control. Ford SYNC and GM OnStar and MyLink are examples of factory-installed infotainment systems also designed to mitigate distracted driving with voice-activated controls. One key difference is that iLane is an after-market solution and can go with the driver from car to car. The hardware that provides the iLane platform can be powered by any car‚Äôs cigarette lighter and is compatible with nearly any Bluetooth audio system and smartphone using Blackberry Operating System 4.1 or higher. In July 2009, IMS announced that Bell Mobility stores across Canada would carry iLane for use with smartphones on its wireless network. In the US iLane is distributed by True Wireless. Areas with hands-free laws that permit the use of a Bluetooth headset are able to use iLane legally. Following the launch of iLane across Bell Mobility stores in Canada, the 3rd largest Canadian carrier TELUS mobility also began to distribute the product in February 2010.

It covers a area and reaches depths between . History The field was discovered in October 1996 and is located in P-36 block. The operator Petrobras had been preparing for a deepwater technical challenge such as Roncador under its PROCAP (Petrobras Technological Development Program on Deep Water Production Systems) and PROCAP-2000 initiatives. The field is considered to be a major breakthrough. It involves world‚Äôs first drill pipe riser, subsea tree and early production riser (EPR) rated for .FMC Technologies. Petrobras Roncador Roncador has 53 production wells, 29 injection wells and is anticipated to peak in 2014. Oil platform accident Until 2001, the field was developed using Petrobras 36 oil production platform. In the early hours of March 15, 2001 there were two unexplained explosions in the aft starboard column. At the time there were 175 people on the platform; 11 were killed. Following the explosions, the platform developed a 16¬∞ list, sufficient to allow down- flooding from the submerged fairlead boxes. Marine salvage teams tried over the weekend to save the platform by pumping nitrogen and compressed air into the tanks to expel the water, but they abandoned the rig after bad weather. The platform sank five days after the explosions (March 20), in of water with an estimated of crude oil remaining on board. Ownership The field is fully owned and operated by Petrobras. It is estimated that Petrobras will spend nearly $2.2 billion on a project finance basis. Reservoir Roncador has 3 billion barrels of proven recoverable oil reserves. Due to its size the field was divided into four sections: Module 1 (28-31¬∞ API), Module 2 (18¬∞ API), Module 3 (22¬∞ API) and Module 4 (18¬∞ API) with subsequent division of the project into several phases. Production Field development on Roncador was divided into several phases: *The Module 1 **Module1, Early Production Phase started producing on January 1999 from a well through FPSO Seillean. This phase was set to produce early in order to create revenue for the project to cover the huge costs for development of the whole field. Production during this phase was 20,000 bbl/d.Offshore Technology. Roncador. Campos Basin, Brazil **The Module 1, Phase One consisted of several subsea wells connected to semisubmersible production facility P-36 which started producing in May 2000, which sank on March 15, 2001 due to two explosions leading to human casualties. At that time, P-36 was considered to be world's biggest semisubmersible which produced 84,000 bbl/d and 1.3 MMcm/d of gas. **Module 1A, Phase One was started after the P-36 sunk on Module 1 to get the field producing as soon as possible. Eight production wells were connected to FPSO Brasil vessel moored in of water. On December 2002, the field started producing again . **Module 1A, Phase Two included fabrication and installation of P-52 platform connected to 18 subsea production wells and 11 water injection wells.

Roncador project Overview Engineering and construction of P-52 platform which was built for a total cost of $1 billion was contracted to a consortium of Technip and Keppel FELS in December 2003. The platform became operational in November 2007 with 20,000 bbl/d peaking to 180,000 in second part of 2008. The peak gas production from this phase was 3.2 MMcm/d. *Module 2 development consists of 17 long horizontal wells 11 of which are production wells and 6 - for water injection. Considered one of the largest in the world and weighing 66,224 tonnes, the P-54 FPSO vessel was assigned for production from Module 2. P-54 was converted from VLCC Barao De Maua large carrier at a $628 million contract with Jurong Shipyard, a subsidiary of SembCorp Marine and a $25 million subcontract with Aker Solutions which provided the processing equipment for the vessel. It became operational on December 11, 2007. This phase of the project boost the overall production from the field to 460,000 bbl/d. *Module 3 development consists of 11 add-on and 7 water injection wells and includes the P-55 with production capacity of 180,000 bbl/d and gas compression capacity of 6 MMcm/d.

Despite being the second highest peak in Germany and having a north face which drops about 1500 m (one of the highest rock faces in the whole of the Northern Limestone Alps) the Hochwanner has remained a relatively unknown mountain. This is due to its relatively inaccessible location, behind the Alpspitze and hidden by the H√∂llentalspitze.

The easiest route to the summit is from the south from the Rotmoosalm (3 hours) or from Gatterl.

She won the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions in 1992 and has been a regular performer at the Met ever since. In 1995, she was the recipient of the Marian Anderson Award. In 2009, she completed her Bachelor's Degree (that she had to put on hold after going to The Met's Young Artist Program) in Music from California State University, Northridge. Prior to graduation, Michelle sang in the adult choir every Sunday at Our Lady of Lourdes in Northridge, CA, under the direction of Sterling Branton. In May 2010, the University honored her with a Doctorate in Fine Arts for her contributions to the music industry. Past recipients include Michael Eisner, and Carol Vaness. Early in her career, DeYoung sang with Glimmerglass Opera and the Wolf Trap Opera, two companies devoted to fostering the careers and talents of young opera singers. The mezzo-soprano has since performed in leading roles on the stages of many of the world's best opera houses and opera festivals, including the Metropolitan Opera-New York City, the Bayreuth Festival, the Berlin State Opera, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Houston Grand Opera, the New National Theatre Tokyo, the Op√©ra National de Paris, the Salzburg Festival, the Seattle Opera, and the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet. She has enjoyed particular success in portraying Wagnerian roles like Fricka, Sieglinde and Waltraute in The Ring Cycle, Brang√§ne in Tristan und Isolde, Kundry in Parsifal, and Venus in Tannh√§user. Some of her other stage roles include Gertrude in Hamlet, Jocaste in Oedipus Rex, Judith in Bluebeard's Castle, Marguerite in La Damnation de Faust, and the title role in The Rape of Lucretia. Outside the Wagner roles she has become the premiere Judith in Bluebeard's Castle. She has performed this role with conductor James Levine at Tanglewood, and conductor/composer Pierre Boulez at the Barbican in London, and also with The Cleveland Orchestra. She also performed the role in Salzburg. The role of Judith is one of the most taxing for a mezzo as it goes all the way up to a high C. Michelle DeYoung's range as a singer is three octaves. She also portrayed the role of the Shaman in the world premiere of Tan Dun's The First Emperor at the Metropolitan Opera on December 21, 2006. Ms. DeYoung is also a favorite singer for newer composers like John Adams and Elliot Carter, having premiered several pieces. In 2008, DeYoung made her debut at La Scala as Brang√§ne, a performance which was recorded live for release on DVD. She also sang the role of Didon in the 2-time Grammy Award winning recording of Hector Berlioz's Les Troyens under the baton of Sir Colin Davis in 2001. She also recorded a solo album, Songs, which was released on the EMI label in 1999. Her discography also includes a number of works from the concert repertoire, including Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 3 with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Mahler's Kindertotenlieder and Mahler's Symphony No. 3 with the San Francisco Symphony, Leonard Bernstein's first two symphonies with Leonard Slatkin and the BBC Orchestra, and the Grammy Award winning recording of John Corigliano's Symphony Number 1 with Slatkin and the National Symphony Orchestra among others. The 2003 Mahler Symphony No.3 recording with Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony won Michelle her third Grammy award in the Best Classical Album Award.

It is actually in extent. Etymology The name is believed to derive from the graveyard's being a site for boxing matches, or perhaps from \\"baily\\" (bailiff), a nickname for the officials of the priory at Kilmainham.http://www.thejournal.ie/hidden- ireland-the-capitals-oldest-graveyard-609289-Sep2012/ History There was a graveyard on this spot for over a thousand years. The graveyard is believed to hold the graves of some of those killed at the Battle of Clontarf, including a son and grandson of Brian Boru. Over time it became more famous as a pauper‚Äôs cemetery, as the land was believed to be common ground, and no charges were required for burials. But not only paupers were buried here, as many respectable Catholic citizens made use of the land, as after the Reformation there was no official Catholic graveyard in the city.Irish Times On feast-days the cemetery was used for socialising which sometimes got out of hand, resulting in rowdyism and fighting. The largest of these was the \\"pattern\\" on the feast of St. John (24 June), when thousands trooped through the cemetery to St. John's Well, located across the road from the cemetery. Attempts were made by the Roman Catholic clergy on one hand, and the Government on the other, to have these gatherings suppressed, but without success until the 1830s, in the wake of a cholera epidemic.D'Alton: History of the County Dublin, 1837. p. 632 About the year 1760 General Dilkes, Commander of the Forces, attempted to turn the cemetery into a botanic garden for the Royal Hospital and he caused the graves to be levelled, spread a thick covering of lime over the entire surface, and enclosed the place with a high wall. The local men of the Liberties, however, annoyed at the offence to their ancestors and relatives interred there, collected in a body one night, and fought a pitched battle against the soldiers of the Royal Hospital. Eventually the wall was levelled and the place was restored to its original purpose.Weston St. John Joyce: The Neighbourhood of Dublin (1920) The cemetery fell into decay towards the end of the 18th century. It was also a favourite target of body snatchers, as it was not surrounded by a particularly high wall or railings (though it did have watch-men). John Cheyne, an eminent surgeon working in Dublin, wrote to his colleague Edward Percival describing the body-snatching techniques in vogue about 1818: \\"The bodies used in most of the dissecting rooms are derived from the great cemetery for the poor called Hospital Fields - vulgo Bullys' Acre.\\"John Fleetwood, The Irish Body Snatchers, Tomar Publishing, Dublin, 1988. p. 38 Peter Harkan, a well-known Dublin surgeon from Sir Philip Crampton's school, and hitherto a very successful resurrectionist, fell victim in this cemetery while hunting for corpses. A party of watch-men spotted him and rushed towards him. He succeeded in getting his assistants over the cemetery wall, but when crossing himself, his legs were seized by the watch-men, while his pupils pulled against their opponents with such effect that he eventually died from the effects.William J. Fitzpatrick: History of the Dublin Catholic Cemeteries. Dublin, 1900. Chapter III Information sign at the entrance to Bully's Acre. During the cholera epidemic of 1832 large numbers were buried here, which worsened the already congested state of things - the writer D'Alton stated that during the six months that the cholera raged in Dublin, 3,200 burials were made.D'Alton: History of the County Dublin. Dublin, 1838 p. 631 Shortly afterwards the cemetery was closed by order of the government. By this time Goldenbridge and Glasnevin cemeteries were available for Catholics. It is estimated that several hundred thousand persons were buried in the cemetery. Burials Dan Donnelly (1788‚Äì1820), the famous Irish boxer, was buried here in an unmarked grave when he died in 1820. His body was taken by the body snatchers and sold to a Dublin surgeon, who demanded that it be returned, but he first removed the right arm. In 1953 the arm ended up on display in the Hideout, a public house in Kilcullen, County Kildare, for many years.Abel, Allen. \\"Donnelly's Arm,\\" Sports Illustrated, February 20, 1995.
