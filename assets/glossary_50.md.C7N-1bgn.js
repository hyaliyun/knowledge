The species was described from a number of Early Miocene fossils found in what is now Croatia.  History and classification  The original group of fossils that the type species, and three other species, were described from are preserved as compression fossils in sedimentary rock from the Radoboj area of what is now Croatia. The deposits are the result of sedimentation in an inland sea basin, possibly a shallow lagoon environment, during the Burdigalian of the Early Miocene. Along with L. imhoffii a diverse assemblage of several hundred species of insects have been preserved in the sediments, along with fish and algae. The fossil impressions are preserved in micrite limestones, resulting in low quality preservation of fine details. The insect fossils were first studied by Oswald Heer, then a professor with the University of Z√ºrich, who placed the fossils in four new ant species in two different genera, \\"Formica imhoffii\\", \\"Formica schmidtii\\", \\"Ponera fuliginosa radobojana\\", and \\"Ponera affinis\\". Based on the petiole structure and wing venation, Heer subsequently moved the four species to the new genus \\"Poneropsis\\" in 1867 as \\"Poneropsis affinis\\", \\"P. fuliginosa\\", \\"P. imhoffii\\", and \\"P. schmidtii\\". He also described three new species, \\"P. livida\\", \\"P. lugubris\\", and \\"P. morio\\". In the same year, entomologist Gustav Mayr of Vienna examined a number of fossils from Radoboj, some being the type specimens, others being identified by Heer but not types. Later in 1907 Anton Handlirsch revisited the work of Mayr and Heer in a monograph of fossil ants. In 2014 a series of 21 specimens, many of the type specimens plus additional fossils, were reexamined and redescribed by paleoentomologists Gennady Dlussky and Tatyana Putyatina. Mayr examined eight of the Radoboj specimens belonging to the species \\"F. imhoffi\\" and \\"F. schmidtii\\", noting the similarity between the males of the two species, and that they likely belonged to the genus Liometopum. Following on Mayr's suggestion Handlirsch formally synonymized the two species, giving \\"P. imhoffii\\" seniority over \\"P. schmidtii\\", and moved the species to Liometopum. Heer based the species \\"P. fuliginosa\\" on fossils from both Radoboj and √ñhningen, Germany. When Mayr examined several of the specimens, he interpreted them to show a two segmented petiole, and moved both \\"P. fuliginosa\\" and \\"P. livida\\" to the genus Aphaenogaster. In contrast, Heer in 1867 moved the two species to his new genus \\"Poneropsis\\", a move that was followed by William Morton Wheeler in 1911 when he designated \\"P. fuliginosa\\" the type species of the genus. The single type specimen of \\"P. affinis\\" was preserved with a distorted head and wing proportions, from which Heer differentiated the species from \\"P. fuliginosa\\". Neither Mayr or Handlirsch were able to study the fossil, so they did not comment on the species status. However Dlussky and Putyatina concluded that the specimen did not differ from \\"P. fuliginosa\\" when the distortion of the fossil was accounted for, and included it as a junior synonym of L. imhoffii. Following the research of Mayr and Handlirsch, Dlussky and Putyatina agreed with the placement in Liometopum. Based on examination of one of the \\"P. fuliginosa\\" type queens, and on Heer's illustrations, they also concluded \\"P. fuliginosa\\" was a junior synonym of L. imhoffii. Of all the species named, Dlussky and Putyatina were not able to examine the type specimens for \\"F. livida\\" and \\"P. morio\\", only other specimens looked at and identified by Heer. In both species, the examined fossils do not match the descriptions published by Heer, and either belong to other species, or are not well enough preserved to identify at all. Based on Heer's 1867 descriptions and illustrations Dlussky and Putyatina concluded that both are synonyms of Liometopum imhoffii. Heer named L. imhoffii for his friend Ludwig Imhoff of Basel, Switzerland. Description The queens of L. imhoffi range between in length with rectangular heads that are slightly wider than long. The sides of the head are convex in outline, while the rear margin curves inwards near the middle. The mesosoma is wider than the maximum width of the head and thick in construction, while the fore section of the mesonotum is large and the legs are robust and short. The petiole has a wide scale on the node and connects to an oval gaster. The males are smaller than the queens, ranging between in length and having a much smaller head. The legs are longer and thinner than those of the queen, while the mesosoma is wider than the head, as in the queens. The males have a petiole that is low and triangular in outline, the node being only 1.5 times as high as long. Unlike the oval gaster of the queens the males have a more elongated egg shaped gaster.

The inspirations for his artistic-architectural projects include contemporary ecology, genetics, physics, astronomy and ancient cosmological concepts which relate microcosm with macrocosm. Identifying an analogy between the human body and the natural world, Kozakiewicz questions the anthropometrical character of Vitruvian man as the traditional paradigm of architecture. Instead, he proposes an organic paradigm, a \`geometry of the inside¬¥.  Biography  Kozakiewicz was born in Bialystok (Eastern Poland) in 1961. He studied at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts (Sculpture Department) and the Cooper Union for Advancement of Science and Art in New York, in the class of Nicky Logis and Hans Haacke. Originally trained as a sculptor he turned his attention to architecture, urbanism and science in the mid-nineties. In 2006 Kozakiewicz represented Poland at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. Some of his projects have received prices in architectural competitions. He received an honourable mention, for instance, in a competition for the design of the Centre of Contemporary Art in Toru≈Ñ (2004) and in 2005, his entry won in international competition for the Park of Reconciliation near the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum. In 2005 Kozakiewicz‚Äôs Project Mars, a massive redesign of the landscape of a former lignite-mining area near Lake Baerwalde in Germany, won an open competition and was completed in 2007.  Work  Initially, Kozakiewicz's search took place in the field of traditional sculpture, but at the end of the 90. his interests started to focus increasingly on the social, ecological and symbolic dimensions of the public space, especially urban architecture. His quest has led him to utopian and critical architectural and environmental art projects. Jaros≈Çaw Kozakiewicz's projects constitute an attempt to solving the problem of reintegrating the human being within his surroundings - the natural environment. They often use symbolic forms, quite frequently referring to the human body. This approach brings to mind, above all, the eighteenth-century architecture parlante, but at the same time, they constitute an aspect of contemporary ecological thought. Kozakiewicz searches for geometrical equivalents of the ways the human bodily presence manifests itself in the world, that is the sphere of physical contact and communication between bodies. Using the language of architecture, he strives to express proximity, distance, bodily experience of the other, and contact with non-human bodies. This search is best evident in his design for Tower of Love (2004) ‚Äì a challenge to civilizational processes that eliminate the body from social life. Kozakiewicz's organic buildings catch the eye. Behind his utopian architecture, for which nature carves out the structural parameters, is more than a desire to improve quality of life in the city; it also takes into account a possible urbanistic context. Examples might be Tower of Love (2004), the Oxygen Towers (2005) shaped like human lungs or Transfer (2006), presented at the 11. Architecture Biennale in Venice. Some of the artist's designs are practically ecological manifestos.  Selected public space projects  = Project Mars, earth sculpture, 18 x 350 x 250 m, Boxberg, Germany = 1st prize in the international open competition In 2003 an international competition was held to seek proposals for the Baerwalder Lake Landscape Park, a section of an immense cultural and recreation area situated on the largest in a chain of 27 artificial lakes created from the abandoned coal pits. The open-ended challenge was to fashion an artistic project physically powerful enough to stand up to the power plant still operating just behind it. Artist Jaros≈Çaw Kozakiewicz‚Äôs sculptural design containing an amphitheater, the Project Mars, won for its success on those terms and as an agent of rejuvenation. Constructed of 142,170 cubic yards of earth and other recycled detritus left over from the mines, the 1,150-by-820-foot ear enclosing the open-air theater constitutes undulating hills for people to wander on the lakeshore. Mars serves as a place of relaxation, excursions, and various cultural activities, such as summer cinema or small-scale concerts. The grass- covered giant auricle is blending in almost perfectly with the surroundings. The monumental scale makes it possible to challenge the traditional relationship between the work of art and the viewer. Mars isn‚Äôt an object that we can take in with a single view and admire from a distance, but rather a place that we experience ‚Äúfrom the inside,‚Äù such as by participating in the activities it offers. Project Mars is also subordinated to the rhythm of nature, in the same way the natural landscape features are, and its appearance depend on the changing seasons. Thus the artificial and man-made is integrally connected to the natural. = Park of Reconciliation of the Nations = 1st prize in the international open competition‚Äì under realization In 2005, Kozakiewicz‚Äôs design of the Park of Reconciliation of Nations won the first award in an open competition to revitalise an area on the right bank of the river So≈Ça, near the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. The design proposed by the artist (with irregular paths inspired by the veins of poplar leaves, a popular tree in this area) meant a radical move away from the geometry of straight lines; it was a symbolic gesture aiming to negate the horribly clear geometric layout of the former death camp. According to the plan‚Äôs requirements Kozakiewicz‚Äôs design sought to create a park that would be available not only to the visitors of the Auschwitz museum but also to the local population. The result was a public park, located in the direct vicinity of a place charged with historical memory, which would not only integrate itself with the existing ecosystem but also address the needs of the residents of the town O≈õwiƒôcim. The artist faced a particurarly daunting task, that of reviving the space of a park located near a former death camp. The pedestrian- only Bridge of Ghosts, one of the symbolic elements of the Park, is an extension of a street called Kamieniec which runs alongside the camp site. The 200 metre-long wooden bridge over the So≈Ça connects the Museum with the park. Its form has been derived from a plane corresponding in width with Kamieniec Street, twisted 180 degrees around its own axis; it is a sort of stretched Moebius strip. In the bridges lower part a corridor has been gouged out that changes into a tunnel. Looking at the bridge from the South, we will see the pedestrians disappearing in the tunnel. They will re-emerge a moment later. The Bridge of Ghosts is a reference to the archetypal rites of passage, from death to life, from life to death. = Aquaporin (fountain, Copernicus Science Centre, Warsaw, 2015) = Kozakiewicz‚Äôs work looks for analogies between the functions of the human body and the world of nature ‚Äì he sees the human body as a closed ecosystem on a small scale. He has returned on these fields of interest in Aquaporin, a combined water sculpture installation and fountain which is a metaphor for life. The Artist stresses that his intention in placing the fountain next to the Copernicus Science Centre was to remind visitors and pedestrians that science gives us hope of maintaining life on this planet. The fountain is 4,5 meter high and made of nine ribbons twisted in various fashions made of a carbon/epoxy composite. The ribbons are 10‚Äì40 cm wide and the water is sprayed through three nozzels, which symbolize the construction of a water particle.  Selected books and articles  * Jaros≈Çaw Kozakiewicz.

The first African-American geologist to earn a PhD in the US was Marguerite Williams, who earned her degree in 1942. Dr. Gipson's career spanned decades in the petroleum industry as well as decades in academia.  Biography  Gipson was born in Trenton, South Carolina, on September 15, 1931 and grew up on his grandmother's farm. He persuaded his grandmother to move to Augusta, Georgia, so that he could complete high school. Gipson became interested in science when he studied geology in junior high school and read The Earth and Life Upon It. He studied science and mathematics at nearby Paine College, financed initially by his mother, who borrowed money to get him started. Gipson also worked part-time while in college and received his bachelor of science degree in 1953. Mack was drafted into the U.S. Army in June, 1954, and served as a radio technician during his service from 1954 to 1956. During this time, he began to consider a career as a geologist because \\"working outdoors as a field geologist interested him more than being confined to classroom or laboratory\\". He went on to attend the University of Chicago and received his Master of Science degree in 1961. He then began his Ph.D. research on the deep sedimentary rocks near the central Illinois coal fields. Gipson received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in Geology in 1963. Throughout his career Gipson worked in a number of different jobs. For example, he served as the director of a special program for high school scientists, a project of the National Science Foundation. He also worked for several oil corporations such as Exxon, ERCO Industries, the Aminoil Company, and Phillips Petroleum. Gipson started the geology department at Virginia State College (now called Virginia State University). After a decade of working in industry, Gibson returned to teaching in 1986 and joined the faculty of the University of South Carolina as a professor of geology. Gipson was the founding advisor of the National Association of Black Geologists and Geophysicists (NABGG). in 1980, Gipson hosted a successful Ice Breaker/ Planning Session at his home for geologists of the Houston region looking for a network with other minority professionals in geoscience. The room was full of geoscience professionals with enthusiasm and energy. This excitement led to a series of meetings and the establishment of the NABGG in 1981. Through the years, the NABGG has supported minorities in geosciences and been locally active in schools and professional meetings. The organization‚Äôs name was changed to the National Association of Black Geoscientists (NABG) in 2014.  Research  Gipson‚Äôs early research was focused on shale deposits‚Äîwith specific interest in clay mineralogy and its relationship to shale porosity and burial depths, as well as the development of improved methods for studying clay mineralogy. He was the first to identify large-scale faceted peaks in the equatorial region of Mars from images returned by the Mariner 9. His later research was focused mostly on collaborations studying potential petroleum reservoirs.  Honors and awards  Gipson served as a member of the National Academy of Sciences Science Study Group on Geological Training and Research in the Republic of Zaire in 1972. In the mid 1990s, U. S. Secretary of Energy Hazel B. O'Leary appointed Gipson to the National Petroleum Council (US). Gipson received many honors during his career. Among other awards, he was honored by Paine College with the Alumni Achievement Award, the President's Award, and the Presidential Citation. A teacher for many years, he was recognized as a member of the Outstanding Educators of America. The School of the Earth, Ocean and Environment of the University of South Carolina offers the Mack Gipson scholarship to students from groups traditionally under- represented in the Geosciences in honor of for Gipson. The academic advising center at Paine College is named the Mack Gipson Jr., Tutorial and Enrichment Center.  Personal life  Gipson married Alma Gadison in1956 after being discharged from the army.

It is one of the parents of the widely cultivated plant Pelargonium √ó hortorum, often called \\"geranium\\", \\"zonal geranium\\" or \\"zonal pelargonium\\". Etymology The genus name Pelargonium, in scientific Latin, derives from the Greek pelarg√≥s (œÄŒµŒªŒ±œÅŒ≥œåœÇ), designating the stork, the shape of the fruit evoking the beak of the bird. The specific epithet zonale is the neutral inflected form of the Latin zonalis \\"relative to the zone\\", with reference to the brown zone on the leaf. Pelargonium zonale was collected by Henrik Bernard Oldenland in 1689 at Meiringspoort Pas. The species was described by the Dutch botanist Jan Commelijn (1629‚Äì1692) and illustrated with a watercolor by Maria Moninckx. Description Pelargonium zonale is an upright or scrambling shrub, normally growing to about in height. Its stems are succulent, hairy when young and becoming woody with age. The leaves often have a narrow, dark, zigzag \\"zone\\" of pigmentation, giving rise to both the scientific and common names. The flowers are borne in an umbel; individual flowers are markedly zygomorphic. The petals are narrow and a bright, deep pink, with reddish lines along the petals' length. Leaves are reniform and petiolate with an average diameter of 5 to 8 cm. Cultivation In the 16th century, Pelargonium seeds were transported from Africa to Leiden in the Netherlands, where the plant was grown in the botanical garden there. Within a few years, it reached the British Isles, France, Italy and Spain and became popular. It gradually reached the islands of the Caribbean, and in the 17th century it was already known in North America. Today it is naturalized in many subtropical and tropical countries and in colder areas must be grown indoors. Plants can be obtained from seeds or vegetatively. The hard-coated seeds germinate within 14 days at about 20¬∞ C. once the seed coat is compromised. Micropropagation has been used commercially since the 20th century. In temperate climate zones, plants are set out in gardens in the spring, then can be dug prior to the first freeze and brought indoors to overwinter; they can be re-planted in the spring. Hybridization This species, when hybidized with closely related species, has yielded a group of hybrid plants referred to as Pelargonium x hortorum. These hybrids are usually referred to by the common name \\"zonal geranium\\".

Early life He was a younger son of Robert Thomson of Watton, Hertfordshire, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of John Harsflet or Halfehead of the same place; Maurice Thomson (1601/4-1676) the Virginia settler was an older brother, and Thomson was there as a significant figure from 1623, before returning to London as a merchant trading with Virginia and the Caribbean. The youngest brother Robert Thomson, also a merchant, was in New England for a period. The family were Parliamentarians, and early in 1643 Thomson held the commission of captain of a troop of horse under William Russell, 5th Earl of Bedford. In the following year he served under Sir William Waller in his western campaign, and at this period attained the rank of colonel. Losing a leg in action, he retired from military service. Political career Thomson was returned to parliament for , probably in August 1645, and on 18 February 1651 was appointed a member of the English Council of State. On 8 April that year he became a commissioner of customs, and in 1652 he was sent to the fleet as a commissioner to consult with Robert Blake and report the condition of affairs to the Council. On 2 December 1652 he was appointed to the committee for the admiralty, the committee for the Ordnance, and the committee for trades, plantations, and foreign affairs. In April 1653 differences between Oliver Cromwell and the Long Parliament came to a head, and the parliament was dissolved. On 18 May Thomson was dismissed from his posts of commissioner of the customs and of the army and navy, as well as from his other offices. He then concentrated on the views of the Fifth- monarchy men. Thomson returned to Westminster on 7 May 1659 with the remainder of the Long Parliament. On 16 May he was again appointed a member of the Council of State, and on 8 July he was added to the committee for intelligence. On 18 August he was appointed colonel of a regiment of volunteers to be raised in London. After the Restoration of 1660, Thomson went to ground at the residence of his brother Maurice at Lee, Kent, and occupied himself with anti-Royalist intrigues. On 31 October 1661 a warrant was issued for his arrest. After some time in obscurity, Thomson around the beginning of 1668 was nominated to the commission of accounts, and returned to public life. Personal life Thomson married Elizabeth, daughter of James Brickland of Thorncliff in Cheshire.

Participating bands and audience members came from several countries. Riot police stormed the concert, arresting about 250 people, several suspected of hate speech. Foreign participants‚Äîfor example, from the United States‚Äîstated during the trial they were unaware the nazi salute was considered hate speech in Sweden. The concert and subsequent trials was widely publicised by the domestic press. Among the bands playing at the concert, major attention was given to, among others, Max Resist and Vit Aggression. The latter was performing just as the police rushed the premises. On their 2002 album Keep Fighting, Max Resist also recorded the song Battle of Brottby, referencing the event.

Golden Globe Awards (January 15) After the cancellation of the 2008 event due to the 2007-08 writer's strike, plus the risk that a threatened actor's strike would imperil the Oscars, and a star-studded presidential inauguration scheduled 5 days after, the 66th Golden Globe Awards were more glamorous than usual, with many stars choosing unique couture gowns that might normally have been reserved for the Oscars. InStyle ranked Eva Mendes's strapless white Dior dress as the 4th best dress of the decade. This dress was very widely praised at the time, and continued to be remembered through the early 2010s as a particularly notable design which foreshadowed trends for winter white by several years. In 2015, Mendes's 2009 appearance was still being held up as one of the great Golden Globe red carpet looks. In 2013, whilst Hello! noted other dresses from this event (such as Cameron Diaz's pink satin Chanel and Kate Winslet's black Yves Saint Laurent gown) as among the 20 best ever Golden Globes dresses, Mendes was prominently placed on the list. Academy Awards (February 22) For the 81st Academy Awards neutral-coloured dresses in asymmetrical and either full-skirted or mermaid styles were widely worn. The New York Times commented that despite the safeness of Oscar fashions, the 2009 looks seemed \\"less branded,\\" with more focus on statement jewelry (such as Amy Adams's necklace) than on designer labels. Vogue observed that alongside strapless dresses, one of the season's big trends for one-shouldered designs was reflected on the red carpet in gowns worn by Freida Pinto, Marisa Tomei, and that year's Best Actress winner, Kate Winslet, whose violet-grey satin and black lace Yves Saint Laurent gown was placed at number 8 in the InStyle list of 100 best dresses of the decade. Anne Hathaway's jewelled mermaid dress by Armani Priv√© led to Cosmopolitan declaring that she would make \\"headlines as ‚ÄúBest Dressed‚Äù\\", and was compared to a \\"burst of light underneath her\\" by InStyle, who placed it 2nd in their list of the 100 best dresses of the decade. Styled by Rachel Zoe, the Armani dress has been called one of Hathaway's style 'highs.' Vogue also noted that despite the popularity of nude tones, a number of women wore jewel tones in reds, purples and blues, although other commentators focused on the neutral-tone dresses. =Gallery= File:AmyAdamsOscarsFeb09.jpgAmy Adams in a ruby red gown and bold necklace File:MarisaTomeiAAFeb09.jpgMarisa Tomei in a one-shouldered neutral gown File:AnneHathawayAAFeb09.jpgAnne Hathaway in strapless Armani Priv√© gown Emmys (September 20) Jennie Garth in bright orange The red carpet looks at the 2008 Emmys were particularly colourful, with bright tones such as red, blue and yellow proving popular. Colour was also worn by some of the male attendees, with Terry O'Quinn, whose yellow necktie matched his wife's dress, commenting \\"Black and white is pretty boring. I think we're evolving sartorially.\\" Hal Rubenstein of InStyle noted upswept hairstyles and sleek designs in bright colours, appropriate for the hot day, and a relative lack of over-indulgence and excess extravagance, while Lawrence Zarian of TV Guide Network commented on the popularity of outsize jewelry and sparkling embellishment. Other events The tenth best dress of the decade according to InStyle was a jewelled peach tulle \\"femme fatale\\" Alberta Ferretti dress worn by Drew Barrymore to the Grey Gardens film premiere on 20 April 2009.

It lies about from the city of Tirunelveli and about from Sankarnagar, a suburb of Tirunelveli which lies on the way to Madurai on National Highway 44. Etymology Even though the village is now widely known as Thenkalam, official records show that it was once called Tenkulam. Tenkulam must be the anglicized form of Thenkulam. Assuming this, Thenkulam can be broken into two words: Then & Kulam. 'Then' in Tamil refers to 'South' while 'Kulam' may refer to two things: Pond(‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ≥‡ÆÆ‡Øç) or a group of related people(‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ≤‡ÆÆ‡Øç). So, Thenkulam can be translated into English as 'Pond in the south' or 'People of the south'. There is a large pond to the southeast of the village, Thalaiyuthu Kulam. Men fishing in the village pond, Thalaiyuthu Kulam Geography Thenkalam is located in a hillocky region being surrounded by two large hillocks: one to the east and the other one to the south. The eastern hillock is called Keezhamalai which is a mere translation (Keezha-East; Malai-Hillock). The southern hillock is similarly called Therkkumalai. The neighborhood of Therkkumalai Colony is located here. The village pond, Thalaiyuthu Kulam, is built by connecting the two hillocks with an embankment. It is a rain fed farm pond which acts as a direct source of irrigation for lands in the Keelapathu and also indirectly helps agriculture by increasing the water table which rises water levels in surrounding wells.

Park conjectured that he came from Suffolk on the ground that \\"he addressed verses to 'Mr. P. W.' who visited Ipswich and wrote an epitaph on Mrs. Pooley of Badley.‚Äô Mrs. Pooley was \\"sister to my lady Wentworth\\", who may have been one of the wives of Thomas, second baron Wentworth, though there were many knights in the Wentworth family. Most of them, however, belonged to Suffolk, and it is possible that \\"Mr. P. W.\\" may have been Peter or Paul Wentworth. Yates has also been associated with Warwickshire on the grounds that he dedicates his work to one Henry Reynolds, who is assumed to be identical with Henry Reynolds, and that Drayton, who was a Warwickshire man, also dedicated his epistle \\"Of Poets and Poesie\\" to Reynolds. Upon this flimsy evidence is also based the theory that the \\"verses written at the departure of his friend W. S. when he went to dwell in London\\" included in Yates's volume refer to Shakespeare. It is more probable that Yates's patron was the Henry Reynolds of Belstead who married Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Withipol of Ipswich, and that \\"Mr. P. W.\\" was Edmund's brother, Paul Withipol (Davy, Suffolk Collections, vol. xciii. f. 341). All Yates's poems are included in one volume, which was entered on the \\"Stationers' Register\\" on 7 June 1582 (Arber, Stationers' Reg. ii. 412), and published at London in the same year (black letter, 4to) \\"by John Wolfe, dwellinge in Distaffe lane, neere the signe of the Castle.\\" The title is given by Corser as \\"The Castell of Courtesie. Whereunto is adioyned the Holde of Humilitie; with the Chariot of Chastitie thereunto annexed. Also a Dialogue between Age and Youth, and other matters herein conteined.\\" In Collier's \\"Extracts from the Register of the Stationers' Company\\" (ii. 166) and in the Gentleman's Magazine (1840, i. 385) the order of the first two titles is reversed, and Collier states that the \\"Castell of Courtesie\\" is a \\"separate publication of which we have no copy nor any other record.\\" This is apparently an error, for, though each of the three parts has a separate title-page, all three titles are given in the entry in the \\"Stationers' Register\\" of 7 June 1582. The volume is chiefly interesting by reason of its rarity; George Steevens possessed an imperfect copy which he believed to be unique, and refused on that account to lend to Park. This copy was eventually bought for 9l. by Heber, who secured another imperfect copy and from the two made up a complete copy, which is now at Britwell. Corser also possessed two imperfect copies, and these were bought at the sale of his books in 1871 by Mr. W. C. Hazlitt, who, however, was unable to make up a complete copy from them. No other copies are known to be extant. The poems included in the volume are distinguished more by their religious and moral tone than by any poetic excellence. Besides the extracts printed by Collier and in the Gentleman's Magazine (1840, i. 385‚Äì7), others are given in the \\"Shakespearean Repository\\" (ed. James Hamilton Fennell, January 1823), in \\"Select Poetry\\" (Parker Soc. ii. 450‚Äì1), and in Corser's \\"Collectanea Anglo-Poetica\\" (xi. 432‚Äì5).

Biography He was born in Orahovac, near Prizren. He graduated from a teacher's college at the Orthodox seminary in Prizren. He was a teacher in Prizren and Kiƒçevo. He wrote a report with data about the Islamization of Christian women and girls in the Kiƒçevo region. Ever since 1902, he has been an advocate for the creation of a Serbian Chetnik Organization that would protect the Serb population of Poreƒç from being attacked by a VMRO company and Muslim looting gangs. After the Ilinden uprising, he took up the job of organizing the first Serbian troops and revolutionary committees. The money for the first company was given to him by the painter Nade≈æda Petroviƒá, who in 1903 visited the devastated areas carrying humanitarian aid. On that occasion, Kujund≈æiƒá met with Savatije Milo≈°eviƒá and Vojislav Tankosiƒá. He participated in the Fight on ƒåelopek when the Chetniks destroyed the Turkish forces. After the fight, he did not want to flee into Serbia but continued to operate in Ottoman-occupied Old Serbia with commanders Savatije Milo≈°eviƒá and ≈Ωivojin Milovanoviƒá. On the Feast of the Ascension, his band appeared in Velika Hoƒça. They were received by Albanian Lanja Ukin who had given them his word (besa) that nothing would happen to them in his house, however, he immediately alarmed the Turks in Orahovac who surrounded them. They set the house on fire. The Chetniks shot back and sung Chetnik songs. The Turks brought Lazar's mother to recognize him for them, but she did not, in order to save her village and family. During the Interwar period, he was hailed as a great hero. In Serbian Literature The heroic deaths of Kujund≈æiƒá and Milo≈°eviƒá inspired Milan Rakiƒá to write a poem \\"At Gazi Mestan\\", https://books.google.ca/books?id=_H9pAAAAMAAJ&dq;=Lazar+Kujundzic&focus;=searchwithinvolume&q;=Rakic%27s+poem+ and the stoic comportment of Lazar's mother moved Serbian Catholic Ivo Vojnoviƒá to write a play called \\"The Resurrection of Lazar\\" (Lazarevo Vaskrsenje) in 1913.

The oldest extant archives is the collection of legal documents of the Office (Chancellery) of the Grand Duke of Lithuania (further on referred to as GDL), also known as Lithuanian Metrica: it has documents from the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1795, this collection was transferred from Vilnius to Russia as a war trophy, and now it is preserved in Moscow. The archives which existed in Vilnius and other towns of Lithuania (Archives of the Supreme Tribunal of GDL, archives of land courts and castle courts of Vilnius Region (Pavietas) of GDL, etc.) up to the middle of the 19th century were basically institutional archives.  History  The privilege by which Jesuit academy in Vilnius was turned into University signed by King of Poland and Grand duke of Lithuania Stephen B√°thory in 1579 April the 1st. Document from Lithuanian State Historical Archives. The oldest Lithuanian archive building in Panevƒó≈æys was built in 1614. Photo taken in 2014. The emergence of the Central Archives of the Old Record Books in Vilnius marks a totally new period in the history of Lithuanian archives. Vilnius Central Archives of the Old Record Books (later on referred to as the Archives) were established on 2 April 1852 (O.S.) on the grounds of the imperial decree of Nicholas I, Emperor of Russia. The Tsar Administration was willing to store documents in one place, to safeguard them against forgery or destruction in order to meet the needs of state institutions as well as private persons, especially the nobility. In 1853, by choice of the authorities, the closed Vilnius University building was fitted to accommodate the Archives. The direct supervision of the Archives was assigned to the Educational Board of Vilnius District. However, the activities of the Archives were also under control of Vilnius military governor (Governor-General), i.e. the actual governor of the state. The prayer for Poland in its struggle for independence by pope Pius IX. Inscriptions in Italian and polish Languages. Document from Lithuanian State Historical Archives. According to the above-mentioned decree of 1852, old record books dating back to ancient times and up to 1799 were to be transferred from various offices in Vilnius, Minsk, Grodno, and Kaunas governorates (guberniyas) to the Vilnius Central Archives of the Old Record Books. Essentially, the Archives were completed as late as 1862 ‚Äì at that time, the old record books kept there totalled 17,388. They were mainly documents produced by various institutions of GDL. In fact, the accumulation of documents continued: in 1887, documents of the liquidated Lublin Old Record Books Archives were transferred to the Vilnius Archives; documents of the cancelled Vitebsk Central Archives of the Old Record Books were also transferred to the Vilnius Archives in 1903. The activities of the Archives did not restrict to the document accumulation. The old record books were managed (described, numbered, assigned to fonds) and bound up. There were also inventories of the old record books, as well as place-name indexes arranged. The stock of the accumulated documents served as a base to provide offices and private persons with archival certificates or legal document extracts. Some historical sources have been published. As a matter of fact, the selection of such documents for publication was rather slanted as they mainly served the purpose of leaving no doubt about the ‚ÄúNorth-western Krai‚Äù as an inherent part of Russia. Scientists and other outsiders were rarely admitted to the research of the historical sources ‚Äì it was possible only with the permission of the highest or local authorities. After the World War I broke out, nearly half of the documents ‚Äì the oldest and the most valuable ones kept in the Archives ‚Äì were exported to Russia. During the times of the occupation of Lithuania by German Empire in 1915‚Äì18, the Archives evaded any serious harm. After the German army retreated, in 1919‚Äì20, the administration and supervision of the Archives was under Lithuanian governance which was replaced by Polish governance and, later on, by Bolshevik rule. During a very difficult period of military actions in 1919‚Äì20, the Vilnius State Archives subordinate to the Polish authorities emerged. It took over the documents not only from the former Vilnius Central Archives of the Old Record Books, but also M. Muravjov museum, former General Archives of Vilnius Offices, and other archives. For quite a long time the fonds of the Archives were kept in separate buildings in Vilnius, until the Archives moved into a new building situated in 8 Slovackio Street (now 8 Mindaugo Street). However, regular activities of the Archives were terminated by the World War II. After the Soviet army occupied Vilnius, during the period of 14‚Äì22 October 1939, approximately 14‚Äì18 railway vans loaded with archival documents left for Minsk. The damage that the Archives suffered was immense as it lost its most valuable and most significant sets of documents including approximately 20 thousand old record books and packages. After Lithuania regained Vilnius, the Archives were transferred under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. Juozapas Stakauskas was appointed Head of the Archives. After the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in June 1940, the Archives were transferred under the jurisdiction the Commissariat of the Interior on 26 August 1940. At the beginning of 1941, after the numerous reorganisations, the Archives started functioning as the Central State Archives of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. The teacher of Tel≈°iai gymnasium Domas Andriulis states that nor he nor his wife has Jew relatives. Inscription in German and Lithuanian languages. Document from Tel≈°iai county archive. When the World War II broke out and Lithuania was invaded by the German army in the summer of 1941, the remaining archival documents were in great danger again. Nevertheless, thanks to the incredible luck, J. Stakauskas, Head of the Archives, managed not only to secure the Archives but also to recover the bulk of the documents that were taken to Minsk in 1939: over 20 railway vans of files were brought back to Vilnius in 1942‚Äì43. During Nazi occupation in 1941‚Äì44, the Lithuanian Archives were made subordinate to the Reichcommissariat Ostland Adviser for Archival Affairs, so it was mainly Germans who could make use of the archives. Besides, special permits were required to get access to the archives. It is even more amazing that J. Stakauskas, Head of the Archives, and several of his colleagues were sheltering 12 Jewish people in the premises of the Archives for nearly a year at the risk of their lives ‚Äì and saved life to these people. Christmas postcard of Lithuanian partisans. Confiscated by Soviet authorities from partisan supporter in 1950. Lithuanian Special Archives. In 1944, when the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania again, both the former name and the former subordination were returned to the Archives in Vilnius. The newly appointed authorities were mainly focused on the selection of the loyal employees, handling inquiries of ‚Äúoperational bodies‚Äù about private persons, restricting access to historical sources for the public, and absolutely irresponsibly destroyed a certain amount of documents ‚Äúof little value‚Äù; besides, they exported some archival fonds to Belarus without any justification whatsoever. The idea of establishing separate, independent historical archives was first generated in 1949. The documents compiled in the years before 15 December 1918 were to form the base for the Archives. In 1951, the Division of the Historical Documents Fonds was established in the Archives. The Central State Historical Archives of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic as a separate institution were established on 1 January 1957. After the former subordination of the Archives was abolished in 1960, they became more open to the society, Lithuanian and foreign scientists. During this period, a fair amount of the microfilms of historical sources dating back to the 13th to 19th centuries and of great significance to Lithuania (including the Lithuanian Metrica) were added to the fonds of the Archives. They were previously kept in Latvia, Poland, Russia, Belarus, and the Ukraine. A growing number of documents were being published and presented to the public. After the former secret fonds were declassified and starting with 1989, all documents were made accessible to researchers.  Present day  Independence declaration of Lithuania.

In 1966 he moved to MIT Sloan School of Management, where he was appointed Assistant professor and became associate Professor in 1970. From 1962 to 1966 he was Professor at the European Institute of Advanced Studies in Management, Brussels. From 1974 to 1978 he was Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and from 1986 to 1995 Professor of Clinical Management at the USC Marshall School of Business and Senior Research Scientist at its Center for Effective Organizations. In Lausanne, Switzerland he was Professor at the International Institute for Management Development from 1995 to 2000, where he became Professor Emeritus in 2000. Back in the United States, he rejoined the USC Center for Effective Organizations as Senior Research Scientist. In 1978 Galbraith had started his own consultancy firm Jay R. Galbraith Management Consultants Ltd. He had been awarded the McKinsey Foundation Doctoral Thesis Award - First Prize in 1967, and the Crystal Apple Award by the Association for the Management of Organization Design in 1994. His book Organization Design was elected \\"Outstanding Book on Organization in 1976 - 1977\\" by the Organization Development Council in 1977, and his Organizing for the Future, was second in the Industry Week's top ten books of the year 1993.  Work  = Organizational architecture = Galbraith's Star Model of organizational design Organization design can be defined narrowly, as the process of reshaping organization structure and roles, or it can more effectively be defined as the alignment of structure, process, rewards, metrics and talent with the strategy of the business. Jay Galbraith and Amy Kates have made the case persuasively (building on years of work by Galbraith) that attention to all of these organizational elements is necessary to create new capabilities to compete in a given market. This systemic view, often referred to as the \\"star model\\" approach, is more likely to lead to better performance. Organization design may involve strategic decisions, but is properly viewed as a path to effective strategy execution. The design process nearly always entails making trade-offs of one set of structural benefits against another. Many companies fall into the trap of making repeated changes in organization structure, with little benefit to the business. This often occurs because changes in structure are relatively easy to execute while creating the impression that something substantial is happening. This often leads to cynicism and confusion within the organization. More powerful change happens when there are clear design objectives driven by a new business strategy or forces in the market that require a different approach to organizing resources.

Total excavations were hewn out of rock cut and carved deep inside the hill. The caves include sculptures of Hindu deities like Shiva, Saptamatrukas and Ganesha.

The Shivleni Caves have also been an Archaeological Survey of India Heritage Site. Description Shivleni Caves are situated hardly half a kilometer to the north-west of Yogeshvari Temple, along the banks of the Jayvanti river. The caves are square in shape and are carved deep inside the hill. The entrance is on the southern side of the hill. Inside Mandap (pavilion) has an 8.36 sq m. court-yard in front and the roof of Mandap is supported by four pillars. Interiors In the centre of the courtyard there is an elegantly carved Nandi Mandap measuring 9.14 √ó 9.14 meters. In the center of this Mandap there is an image of Nandi. The inside of the cave is impressive; one hall is supported by thirty-two pillars and adorned with sculptures of Shiva and Ganesha. An account of this structure can be found in the book The Cave Temples of India by James Fergusson and James Burgess (1880).

This inscription has been relocated to the Tahsildar's office at Ambajogai for safe custody and preservation. Local beliefs A local story claims that the monument is the wedding court of the jogaidevi, whose temple is situated nearby. It is said that the wedding was planned to take place in this mandap but could not take place for supernatural reasons, and the elephants and everything inside it turned to stone, hence the name 'Jogai Mandap'. There is also a local belief that there is a tunnel in this Hattikhana leading to Parli Vaijanath, around 25 km away, that was closed by the authorities.

Built in 1881 and enlarged in 1894, it is an architecturally eclectic combination of elements from the Shingle, Queen Anne, and Colonial Revival styles. It is now Cleftstone Manor, a hotel with seventeen guest rooms. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history Cleftstone is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, set on the west side of Eden Street across from the campus of the College of the Atlantic. It is roughly a long, rectangular building, set parallel to the road. Its busy roofline is pierced by a number of cross gables and gabled dormers, with a project section ath the northwest and a large entrance portico roughly in the center of the main (west-facing) facade. A low polygonal tower is located at the northeast corner of the building. The east facade, screened from the road by trees, is relatively undistinguished. The interior in part reflects the various periods of construction of the building. The downstairs public spaces are elegantly appointed, with Colonial Revival woodwork from its latest period of alteration predominating in the living area and dining room. Remnants of older styles are found elsewhere in the house, including a Queen Anne fireplace mantel in a second-floor bedroom. The oldest portion of the building was built c. 1880 for the How family, which included Bar Harbor's major real estate developer of the period, Charles How. Design of this structure is attributed to Pennsylvania architect Bruce Price, known for his designs of summer properties. John How sold Cleftstone in 1894 to the Ellis family of Cincinnati, who expanded and altered the property in 1894 and again in 1903. Laura Ellis apparently retained ownership when the couple divorced in 1912. Her heirs sold Cleftstone to Joseph McCaffrey in 1947, shortly before a fire swept through the area, destroying all of the other summer houses in the immediate vicinity. McCaffrey opened the Cleftstone Manor Inn in 1948. Facilities The inn has seventeen guest rooms, a formal dining room, breakfast room, and lounge areas. The property has a swimming pool overlooking Frenchman Bay.

History The church arose adjacent to the oratory of Sant Croce or Sala del Redentore. Documents from 1181 state a chapel at the site, adjacent to a leprosarium, was dedicated to the Holy Cross. The church became a parish in 1308. In 1606, the parish came under the rule of the Somaschi Fathers, who established a school at this site. The commission to build the present Rococo style church was given to a lay brother of the order, Francesco Vecelli (1695‚Äì1759). Construction began in 1737 and was completed in 1749. Under Napoleonic rule, the Somaschi were expelled and the church came under control of secular clergy. The belltower was built in 1907. Architecture and Decoration The fa√ßade was designed to be a monument at the end of the Borgo Santa Croce, running from the Prato della Valle to the outer wall. It has a pediment supported by pilasters and half-columns of Corinthian order. Two circular turrets lighten the architecture. The main door has a curved tympanum under the inscription that commemorates the consecration of the church. The late-Baroque and early Neoclassical design was by the architect Girolamo Frigimelica of Padua. The bell tower on the side of the twentieth-century church is built on the area of the cemetery. The well-lit nave features a rich decoration on which is placed a series of openings in fenestrated fake balcony, probably as choirs. The presbytery with semicircular apse is decorated with impressive semi-columns. The ceiling of the church is decorated with coffers, stucco and gilding. The frescoes have been attributed to Gualtieri, Girolamo dal Santo, Domenico Campagnola, and Stefano Dall' Arzere.Padovando, entry on oratory and church. The main altar has two angels sculpted by Antonio Bonazza (1698‚Äì1763) surmounted by a canopy. The apse has a wooden choir. The church has four altarpieces by Giovanni Battista Mariotti (1690‚Äì1748), including depicting the founder of the Somaschi order San Girolamo Miani praying in a grotto. Another fresco depicting the Holy Heart of Jesus was painted by Giovanni Dandolo. Through a door on the right, one can enter the Cappella della Madonna della Neve (Chapel of the Madonna of the Snows) and the Sala del Redentore or Oratory of the Confraternity of the Redeemer. The oratory dates to the 15th-century and was the home of the former Confraternity of the Corpo di Cristo di Santa Croce established at the end of the 15th century. The confraternity was involved in tending to the poor and burying the impoverished. The frescoes of the oratory have been restored.Santa Croce. Cleric Somascan entrusted the large ceiling fresco, depicting the Exaltation of the Cross, and the oval dome of the presbytery to the Venetian Nicolo Baldassini. The paintings at side altars and walls of the apse were commissioned Giambattista Mariotti. The location of the paintings was altered with the arrival of the early 800 Salus Populi Patavini, venerated seventeenth-century wooden statue of Our Lady of Health, coming from the oratory and linked to the plague that struck the city in the seventeenth century. On the first altar to the right from the entrance is a painting of the Mariotti with St. John Nepomuk, St. Francis of Paola and Antonio.

This assessment helps to detect any impairment of the nervous system, being used both as a screening and an investigative tool. The examination findings when combined with a detailed history of a patient, can help a doctor reach a specific or differential diagnosis. This would enable the doctor to commence treatment if a specific diagnosis has been made, or order further investigations if there are differential diagnoses. Structure of examination The examination is performed in sequence: # General inspection # Muscle tone # Power # Reflexes # Coordination # Sensation =General inspection= The upper body is exposed and a general observation is made from the end of the bed. Signs of neurological disease include: * Wasting: May suggest motor neuron disease or a lower motor neuron lesion. It could also indicate local infiltration of nerves such as the brachial plexus, in apical lung tumours, causing wasting of the small muscles of the hand. * Fasciculation: These are small contractions of muscles seen as movements under the skin. They occur in lower motor neuron lesions. * Involuntary movements: Different types exists, all of which are distressing to the patient and cause of embarrassment in public. They are classified into tremor, chorea, athetosis, hemiballismus, dystonia, myoclonus, and tics. = Muscle tone = The hand is grasped like a handshake and the arm is moved in various directions to determine the tone. The tone is the baseline contractions of the muscles at rest. The tone may be normal or abnormal which would indicate an underlying pathology. The tone could be lower than normal (floppy) or it could be higher (stiff or rigid). = Power = The strength of the muscles are tested in different positions against resistance. = Reflexes = There are 3 reflexes in the upper arm that are tested. These are the biceps, triceps and supinator reflex. The reflexes may be abnormally brisk or absent. In the latter, the reflex could be elicited through reinforcement by asking the patient to clench their jaw. = Coordination = Three separate aspects of coordination are tested:  Finger-nose test  This maneuver tests for dysmetria. Examiner holds his hand in front of the patient, who is then asked to repeatedly touch their index finger to their nose and examiners finger. The distance between the examiner's hand and patient's nose should be larger than the forearm length of patient, so that the patient need to move both his shoulder joint and elbow joint during the test instead of just moving the elbow joint. Healthy individual could touch accurately on the nose and examiner's hand with ease, while dysmetria patient will constantly miss the nose and the hand.  Rapid pronation-supination  This maneuver tests for dysdiadochokinesia. The patient is asked to tap the palm of one hand with the fingers of the other, then rapidly turn over the fingers and tap the palm with the back of them, repeatedly. The patient is asked to perform the clapping as quickly as he could. Dydiadochokinesia patient will be impaired in the rate of alternation, the completeness of the sequence, and in the variation in amplitude involving both motor coordination and sequencing.  Pronator drift  The arms are outstretched and patient is instructed to close their eyes. If the hands do not move, it is normal. = Sensation = The five aspects of sensation are tested: # Light touch - tested using cotton wool # Pain - tested with a neurological pin # Proprioception (sense of joint position) - tested by moving the thumb while the patients eyes are closed. Patient is then asked whether the thumb is moved up or down. # Vibration - tested with a 128 Hz tuning fork placed at the first joint of the thumb # Temperature - tested with hot and cold test tubes. Alternatively the cold tuning fork used for vibration sense, could be used.

These signals are passed to a controller to enable appropriate behavior. Sensors in robots are based on the functions of human sensory organs. Robots require extensive information about their environment in order to function effectively.  Classification  Sensors provide analogs to human senses and can monitor other phenomena for which humans lack explicit sensors. * Simple Touch: Sensing an object's presence or absence. * Complex Touch: Sensing an object's size, shape and/or hardness. * Simple Force: Measuring force along a single axis. * Complex Force: Measuring force along multiple axes. * Simple Vision: Detecting edges, holes and corners. * Complex Vision: Recognizing objects. * Proximity: Non- contact detection of an object. Sensors can measure physical properties, such as the distance between objects, the presence of light and the frequency of sound. They can measure: * Object Proximity: The presence/absence of an object, bearing, color, distance between objects. * Physical orientation. The co-ordinates of object in space. * Heat: The wavelength of infrared or ultra violet rays, temperature, magnitude, direction. * Chemicals: The presence, identity, and concentration of chemicals or reactants. * Light: The presence, color, and intensity of light. * Sound: The presence, frequency, and intensity of sound. Motion controllers, potentiometers, tacho-generators and encoder are used as joint sensors, whereas strain-gauge based sensing is used at the end- effector location for contact force control. Internal sensor* It is the part of the robot. Internal sensors measure the robot's internal state. They are used to measure position, velocity and acceleration of the robot joint or end effectors. = Position sensor = Position sensors measure the position of a joint (the degree to which the joint is extended). They include: * Encoder: a digital optical device that converts motion into a sequence of digital pulses. * Potentiometer: a variable resistance device that expresses linear or angular displacements in terms of voltage. * Linear variable differential transformer: a displacement transducer that provides high accuracy. It generates an AC signal whose magnitude is a function of the displacement of a moving core. * Synchros and Resolvers = Velocity Sensor = A velocity or speed sensor measures consecutive position measurements at known intervals and computes the time rate of change in the position values.  Applications  In a parts feeder, a vision sensor can eliminate the need for an alignment pallet. Vision-enabled insertion robots can precisely perform fitting and insertion operations of machine parts.

Unlike other ants in the area like red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta), this species is not aggressive towards humans. The workers have a foul smelling coconut odor when crushed. Dorymyrmex bureni hunt living insects, even other winged ants. They also search for sap-sucking insects from which they collect honeydew. On the head of these ants are curved hairs, used for transporting beads of damp sand. Colonies are small. Nests usually have a single entrance with a mound of sand shaped like a crater. Dorymyrmex bureni prefer sandy soil. This species of ant is not an indoor pest, and pesticides should not be used. They are found throughout Florida.

Biography Born on October 20, 1876, in Wheeling, West Virginia, Wheat entered the film industry in 1921 with a supporting role in the film, The Land of Hope, which starred Jason Robards Sr. During his 27-year career he would appear in over 70 films, in small and supporting roles, many of which were unbilled. Some of the more notable films in which Wheat appeared include: Peck's Bad Boy (1934), starring Jackie Cooper; Frank Capra's Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), starring Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur; 1936's The Great Ziegfeld, starring William Powell and Myrna Loy; arguably one of the greatest films ever made, Citizen Kane (1941), directed, starring and co-written by Orson Welles; the classic film noir, Murder, My Sweet (1944), directed by Edward Dmytryk, and starring Dick Powell, Claire Trevor, and Anne Shirley; and 1946's The Spiral Staircase, with Dorothy McGuire, George Brent, and Ethel Barrymore. Wheat's final film role would be in a small unbilled role in the 1947 film, Killer McCoy, starring Mickey Rooney, Brian Donlevy and Ann Blyth. Wheat died on August 7, 1963 in Los Angeles, California, and was buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

Between 1973 and 1989 he served as a junior member of the country's Council of Ministers, being one of the (at times more than fifteen) government ministers responsible for an industrial sector deemed important enough to justify having its own minister: he was the \\"Minister for the Production of Tooling and Processing Machinery\\".\\"...f√ºr Werkzeug- u. Verarbeitungsmaschinenbau\\" Life Georgi was born into a working-class family on Christmas Day 1927 in a small industrial town in the heart of Saxony's rich mining region, some 20 km (12 miles) north- west of the German frontier with Bohemia. He attended schools in nearby Aue before undertaking a clerical apprenticeship at the cutlery factory there. Before his eighteenth birthday the war ended and Saxony now found itself in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany. During the next few years the entire zone would be politically reorganised under Soviet military administration, becoming a stand-alone Soviet sponsored state, the German Democratic Republic, which would formally be founded in 1949. Well before that, in 1946, the basis was prepared for a return to one-party government, with the forced merger across the zone of the old Communist Party (KPD) and the moderate left Social Democratic Party (SPD) to give birth to what would be East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), for most purposes a Soviet style Communist party by another name. Directly following the war Georgi signaled his interest in politics when he joined the SPD, but following the party merger in April 1946 he was one of the many SPD members who quickly accepted the invitation to sign their memberships across to the SED. The merger of the KPD and SPD had been presented as a merger of equals, but within a few years there were very few former SPD members left in positions of influence within the merged SED. However, in 1946 Georgi had also joined the Free German Youth (FDJ / Freie Deutsche Jugend) which traditionally had been the youth wing of the Communist Party in Germany. Silver was mined locally and between 1950 and 1962 Georgi worked in the local Cutlery and Silverware factory, operated by the VEB Cutlery and Silverware Aue operation. Between 1951 and 1955 he was employed as a Production Manager, and from 1955 till 1962 he was the Works Director. Between 1957 and 1961 he successfully studied for an Economics degree through a correspondence course with the Karl Marx University (as it was then called) in Leipzig. Georgi then moved on, and in 1963 he became General Director with VVB Eisen-, Bleche- und Metallwaren (VVB EBM), an iron and steel products producer in Chemnitz.Chemnitz was known as Karl-Marx-Stadt between 1953 and 1990, which is reflected in sources. In April 1966 he received his doctorate, again from Karl Marx University in Leipzig. His doctoral dissertation, reflecting his job, was entitled \\"Problems of the further development of product-group work at VVB EBM to ensure needs- focused production in the entire industry branch\\". Dr.Georgi's transfer into government came in 1963 when he was appointed Minister for the Construction of Industrial Machinery and Vehicles.Minister f√ºr Verarbeitungsmaschinen- und Fahrzeugbau The country's constitution by now asserted the leading role of The Party, so that in some ways it was the primary task of government ministers simply to carry out party policy, though at the higher levels the same individuals were generally in positions of power and influence in both institutions, making the distinction relatively unimportant. By 1963 there were approximately fifteen government ministers covering departments with areas of responsibility not dissimilar from their western equivalents. Additionally, however, by the time of the New Economic System of Planning and Direction (Neues √ñkonomisches System der Planung und Leitung) established (formally) in 1961, there were a further (approximately) fifteen ministers with responsibility for individual industry sectors. From the perspective of western observers, the industry sector-specific ministers came into focus when they appeared on East German stands at international trade fairs. In 1976, following a reconfiguration of industry ministry areas of responsibility, Georgi became the \\"Minister for the Production of Tooling and Processing Machinery\\". The construction of heavy plant and equipment was a traditional strength of the German economy which by now the Comecon planners were keep to promote, and Georgi was evidently good at his job, since unusually among his industry minister colleagues in 1976, he was still in post in 1989. Within the party his progress was slower. It was usual for candidates for membership of the Party Central Committee to remain on the list for several years, but Rudi Georgi was a candidate for Central Committee membership for nine years, between 1967 and 1976, which represented an unusually long wait. Between 1976 and 1989 he was one of the approximately 125 members of the Party Central Committee, however. With his colleagues he resigned his party and government offices in November/December 1989/1990.

The region has large natural supplies of clay. Nijmegen had used tiles from Zevenaar since 1583. Brickmakers expanded beyond the borders of the town. De Panoven was set up in 1860; continuing the tradition. It started with a single shaft kiln then expanded embracing new technology. In 1901 De Panoven began supplying the first machine-made roof tiles and bricks and 20 years later the first drying sheds were built. The last innovation was the zigzag kiln erected in 1926. This basically operated like a ring kiln, but could be continually fired, saving on fuel. This kiln is the sole remaining intact model in Western Europe. The business was closed in 1982.

It was built for Irish navvies working on railways in London, but gained prominence as a venue in the late 1970s after the band Madness established a live reputation there. Subsequently, it was an important venue in the early stages of several bands' careers and contributed to the Britpop musical genre. Amy Winehouse was a regular visitor to the pub. History The pub was built to serve workmen on the nearby railway, as part of a newly constructed group of buildings. It catered for Irish immigrants to London, in order to segregate them away from other nationalities and avoid racial-related assaults. Music was originally restricted to occasional traditional Irish sessions. The emergence of other venues around Camden Town, including the Roundhouse, Dingwalls and the Electric Ballroom brought an increased interest in live music to the area, including the Dublin Castle. The pub can now accommodate an audience up to 200 people. Madness first attempted to secure a gig at the venue in late 1978, when they were still known as the Camden Invaders. They first performed at the venue on 16 January 1979. According to singer Suggs, the group had to pretend they were a jazz band to get a booking. Landlord Alo Conlon invited the group back for a residency at the venue, and helped to establish their reputation. Conlon hand picked bands to play in the pub that he thought would attract an audience, and word of mouth spread so that A&R; scouts would visit the pub to see what up and coming acts were available. The pub was an important venue for Britpop acts in the 1990s, as it was often the first major London gig for bands that later found commercial success, including Blur. Amy Winehouse performed regularly at the venue and occasionally helped to serve drinks to customers. In 2008, Conlon received a lifetime achievement award for his services to the pub industry in Camden. He died in January 2009 aged 73. A street party was held on Parkway, with Suggs in attendance. Events The Dublin Castle regularly hosts live music events from Wednesday to Sunday every week. It has also long hosted a popular open jam on Tuesday nights, which has included appearances from major bands such as The Libertines. After a hiatus, the open jam has been restarted as Redrock Jam as of November 2016.http://www.richardgregory.org.uk/music/openmic/dublin- castle.htm Redrock Jam is hosted by local band Redwire, who also hosted Redrock Festival at the same venue in October 2016 and again in September 2017.

As the war progressed, the round became obsolete against all but lightly armored vehicles. History The 13.2 mm TuF made its first appearance in 1917 along with the Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr due to the new British Mark IV tank first appearing on the battlefield which by then the 7.92 mm K bullet, was no longer effective against. All German weaponry development came to a sudden halt after the defeat of the German Empire in 1918, and no further development took place due to the limitations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. Development resumed in the late 1930s when the Panzerb√ºchse 38 came around after the need to provide infantry with a man-portable anti tank weapon. The 7.92√ó94 mm round was then developed by Gustloff Werke for use as ammunition in the Panzerb√ºchse 39. As the war progressed, the round became ineffective against all but lightly armored vehicles. The round ended production in August 1942, and the Panzerb√ºchse 39 was phased out in 1944, effectively ending the service life of the round. Details of the round The round originally had a steel core and a tiny capsule of tear gas. The round was to penetrate the armor of the tank and the tear gas to force out the occupants of the vehicle. The idea was impractical due to the core penetrating the armor and leaving the capsule outside. Later bullets used tungsten cores due to its better penetrating power. The round also had a metal jacket. The official designation of the round was Patrone 318 SmK-Rs-L'spur or Patrone 318 SmKH-Rs-L'spur. SmK means \\"Spitzgeschoss mit Kern\\", which translates to \\"pointed bullet with core\\". (H) indicates the bullet has a tungsten-carbide core, (Rs) stands for \\"Reizstoff\\", which means tear gas, because the projectile contains a small capsule of tear gas. \\"L'spur\\" stands for \\"Leuchtspur\\", which translates to tracer, indicating the bullet has a small tracer in its rear.

Hare, then US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, argued in a letter to US Foreign Service dated 25 November 1951 that the murder was very similar to a scene in an American movie that Prince Mishari, Cyril Ousman and his wife had watched together only a few days before the incident.

He died in Paris in 1906. This is a listing of his main works. Main works These are listed below. Paris' H√¥tel de ville In 1881, Lebourg executed an allegory of Nantes as part of the town hall's decoration. \\"Travail\\" Lebourg executed the bronze statue \\"Travail\\" for the √âcole Diderot. It was shown at the 1885 Paris Salon and the Paris Exposition Universelle (1889). Bust of Richard Wallace, Fourth Marquess of Hertford and Lady Wallace Bust of Lady Wallace In 1872 Lebourg completed a posthumous bust in white marble based on a photograph of the Wallaces by √âtienne Corjat of 1855. His white marble bust of Lady Wallace shown here was exhibited at the Paris salon in May 1872. \\"Berger lisant\\" Marble statue \\"Berger lisant\\" by Charles-Auguste Lebourg (French sculptor, 1829-1906), in a niche of the wing of the \\"Galerie des Cerfs\\", Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau This Lebourg sculpture depicting a shepherd reading stands in the grounds of the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau. The Louvre Lebourg has three of his sculptures decorating parts of the outside of the Louvre. The Mollien Pavilion and the Ailes Mollien (an \\"aile\\" is a wing) is part of the cour Napol√©on and is named after a Treasury minister at the time of the French Empire (Nicolas Fran√ßois, Count Mollien) and Lebourg's \\"La Chasse\\" is one of the group of children decorating what is known as the \\"aile en retour Mollien\\". The second of Lebourg's sculptures can be seen in the Richelieu pavilion where the tympanum of the arcade of the passage leading to the rue de Rivoli is decorated with Lebourg's bas relief \\"V√©rite et Histoire\\". The third sculpture, again part of the cour Napol√©on, decorates the Apollon rotunda and is entitled \\"La Force\\". The Mus√©e d'Orsay hold the plaster model of \\"La Chasse\\". Wallace Fountains Lebourg is arguably best known for his caryatids for the famous cast-iron Wallace fountain, a public drinking fountain seen all over France and in many parts of the world. They are named after the Englishman Richard Wallace, who financed their construction. A great aesthetic success, they are recognized worldwide as one of the symbols of Paris. A Wallace Fountain can be seen outside the Wallace Collection in London, the gallery that houses the works of art collected by Sir Richard Wallace and the first four Marquesses of Hertford. The caryatids depict \\"La Simplicit√©\\", \\"La Bont√©\\", \\"La Sobri√©t√©\\" and \\"La Charite\\" as shown below. Bust of Jean-Marie √âcorchard This bust is in Nantes' Jardin des plantes.

The aerodrome is located on the artificial peninsula of Kristiansholm. It is currently serving seaplanes and helicopters operated by Fonnafly aimed at air taxi services at cruise ship tourists. The airport is owned by Bergen Municipality through Bergen Port Authority and is part of the Bergen Port. Operations are carried out by Fonnafly. The airport opened in 1935, although it was not connected to land until 1938. Services were first carried out by Norwegian Air Lines on a coastal route to Oslo. From 1936 also a north-bound service was introduced. Sandviken was taken over by Luftwaffe during the World War II, but little used. Norwegian Air Lines resumed services in 1946 and the following year West Norway Airlines was established with their base at Sandviken. The airlines moved their scheduled flights to Bergen Airport, Hjellestad from 1948 to 1951. West Norway Airlines resumed scheduled flights from Sandviken in 1952, until they ceased operations in 1957. Bergen Airport, Flesland opened in 1955, thus removing most of the traffic from Sandviken. History The first air route in Norway was established in 1920 by Det Norske Luftfartsrederi. Using a Supermarine Channel, it received state subsidies to operate a route from Bergen via Haugesund to Stavanger. The service lasted from 16 August to 15 September.Nerdrum (1986): 29‚Äì30 In Bergen the airline used a water airport in Sandviken.√òsterb√∏: 21 Norwegian Air Lines announced the establishment of a seaplane route from Oslo and around the coast to Bergen ahead of the 1935 season. The city selected Breiviken as its preferred location, situated further out than the ultimate location. However, this site would require much work and a temporary location was needed. For this Kristiansholm was selected. A molo had been built there in 1920; this created difficulties for ship traffic in the area, but was a suitable location to anchor up a seaplane. The location was also suitable due to the vicinity of the city. Funding was granted from Bergen Municipality and a burned down lot at Sandvikstorget was selected.Haaland: 165 The route commenced on 11 June 1935, using a Junkers Ju 52. Flights were only flown during summer and they relied on visual flight rules and could not fly in the dark or in poor weather.Nerdrum: 75‚Äì80 Bergen was the terminus during the first season, but from 1936 a second leg was introduced, extending services northwards to Troms√∏.Nerdrum: 87‚Äì90 The airport's location was popular due to its central location and the municipality therefore decided to make it permanent. Holmsundet, a shallow sound, was covered with a molo, making the airport fixed to land. This hindered ship traffic in the area and caused several docks and companies to have to relocate to still handle sea traffic.Haaland: 166 The airport at Sandviken was taken over by Luftwaffe, the German air force, during the German occupation of Norway between 9 April 1940 and 8 May 1945. They were primarily interested in using Herdla Airport which they constructed on Ask√∏y, and Sandviken was little used. In 1942 and 1944 it saw use by a few detachments of Arado Ar 196 reconnaissance aircraft.Hafsten: 319 After the war, air services commenced in 1946. The first year it consisted of a route to Oslo and to Stavanger, operated by Norwegian Air Lines using Junkers Ju 52.Nerdrum: 152‚Äì156 Herdla Airport became the site of the air traffic control for the Bergen after the war.Aarsand: 38 West Norway Airlines was established at Sandviken in 1947. Operating a fleet dominated by the Republic RC-3 Seabee, they operated mostly air taxi and air ambulance services.√òsterb√∏: 22 From 1948 Norwegian Air Lines introduced the 37-seat Short Sandringham on their Oslo routes. This required a much long runway, which was not possible without interfering with ship traffic in the port. Bergen Municipality therefore started looking for a suitable site further away from town. Both Herdla and Flat√∏y were discarded due to distances and the need for ferry transport, and Hjellestad was found the most suitable site. Bergen Airport, Hjellestad therefore served as Bergen's main airport from 23 August 1948 to the end of the 1951 season. By then Norway Air Lines' successor Scandinavian Airlines had dropped the direct route to Oslo and the sole airline serving Bergen was West Norway Airlines operating its Short Sealands.Aarsand: 41 From the 1952 season it operated two routes out of Bergen. One was southwards to Haugesund and Stavanger,Reitan: 15 and one northwards, to √Ölesund, Molde, Kristiansund and Trondheim.Vik: 105 The 1955 opening of Bergen Airport, Flesland caused the airline to terminate its Stavanger route.Hagby: 59 However, flights to Haugesund continued until 29 September 1956. Northward the route lasted until the end of the 1957 summer season. The need for a coastal seaplane route fell away the following year with the opening of √Ölesund Airport, Vigra.Hjelle: 14 During a storm in October 2003 one of the piers at the airport sank. It took with it two aircraft, which were subject to severe damages, but remaired. The damage amounted to NOK 2 million. A debate arose in 2006 concerning the construction of a helipad at Sandviken. Belma AS, which owns two of Fonnafly's aircraft, intended to anchor a barge and use it as a helipad. The proposal was met by opposition from neighbors, who wished to keep down noise pollution the mixed commercial and residential area of Sandviken. Belma stated that vicinity to cruise ships was necessary to conduct their business. The helipad was however given permission to operate. In the last half of the 2000s there was a political discussion about converting the Kristiansholm to either a cruise ship terminal, or a recreational area. The latter position was argued due to it being the only site in the part of Sandviken which could grant seaside access to the public. However, nothing came of the plans. Facilities The airport and molo The airport is located on Kristiansholm in the Sandviken neighborhood of Bergen, situated X km from the city center. Legally the site consists of two aerodromes, a water airport and a heliport. Both are owned by Bergen Municipality through Bergen Port Authority, although the airport is operated by Fonnafly. Kristiansholm is a peninsula sticking into Byfjorden. The water airport has two runways, aligned 03/21 and 14/32, respectively. Operations are mostly targeted at cruise ship tourists visiting Bergen. The proximity to the cruise ship port is an advantage for Fonnafly. However, the airport is located in a mixed commercial and residential area and there is a high degree of noise pollution impact due to this. Fonnafly operates about 250 annual aircraft movements at the water airport and 450 for the heliport. However, the concession permits 900 and 800, respectively.

It features Greg and Newsbeat presenter Chris Smith, known on the show as \\"Chris Smith With the News\\". History It was originally announced that Greg James was to get a podcast in 2009, whilst he was presenting the Early Breakfast Show. However, this never materialized. It was again announced on 11 September 2013 that the Greg James Drivetime Show was to get a podcast. This was discussed at length on air, and Greg invited listeners to text in suggestions for the name. Ultimately, \\"That's What He Said\\" was decided on. The first episode was then released on Friday 24 October 2013, almost two months later. About The first episode of the podcast was released on 24 October 2013 and since then episodes have been released once a week on Friday afternoons, excluding breaks over Christmas and/or when Greg has been away. Loyal listeners of the podcast are referred to as 'Podcastards' and are able to get in touch with Greg and Chris via the podcastard email address. The emails are then read out during the podcast. Both Greg and Chris tweet from the That's What He Said Twitter account, with the first tweet being sent on 20 November 2013. The podcast has received mostly positive reviews on iTunes. Format The podcast begins with an introduction from the two presenters, often referencing and parodying other radio shows or presenters including BBC London 94.9 and Brian Cox or, more recently, by playing generic Radio 1 warnings for explicit or offensive content. Greg and Chris then discuss what happened in the show over the past week, as well as reading listeners' emails. The podcast includes the features from the Greg James radio show including \\"The Mayor Of Where?\\", \\"Wrong Uns\\", \\"Rage Against The Answer Machine\\", \\"Pun Pong\\" and other sections of the weekday radio show including celebrity interviews and other general chat. Each episode, lasting from 40 minutes to over an hour, contains mostly radio content with podcast exclusive chat between segments. This chat is often rambly and goes off on strange tangents, taking advantage of the relative freedom of a podcast as opposed to a live radio show, where there is a music quota. Emails are read out every week by Chris Smith and follow a loose format. \\"Julia from Germany\\" acts as the show clerk and provides an itinerary and often reminds the presenters of discussion topics they may have mentioned in previous weeks. She keeps score for any games played, and from December 2016 has hosted the feature \\"Julia's Word of the Week\\" where she sends a clip of one German word. This has a theme tune, sung in German and English by Julia. Listeners email in when it is their birthday and Greg then sings their names over the Jurassic Park theme tune - there is a running issue where Greg refuses to take the list from Chris Smith and insists on writing the names out for himself. The list is written in a different typeface every week which is also suggested by a listener. Finally, listeners look out for aubergine themed products and items and send in images for 'Aubergine Corner'. The original catchphrase for the podcast was decided on 2 May 2014 to be \\"keep smiling\\", however later Greg began to sign off the podcast with the line \\"and that (as they say in the business) is the end of the podcast\\", which was unofficially adopted as the primary catchphrase. Recently, Greg's sign off has been 'Goodbye forever!'. On occasion, producer Pippa has accompanied Greg while Chris was away and on one occasion, Chris co- hosted the podcast remotely, whilst away taking part in a video journalism course. On another occasion, another 'Chris Smith' from Peterborough (Chris Smith Without the News) took Chris Smith With The News's place on the podcast after standing in for Chris on the previous Wednesday. Whilst Chris was on holiday in the summer of 2016, Ali Plumb (Radio 1's film reviewer) sat in for Chris Smith for three weeks. After the first week, a Twitter poll was created on the Podcastard Twitter account to determine whether Plumb would be allowed to return the following week. In this poll, \\"Yes indeed he's brilliant\\" won with 81% of the votes on a turnout of 580, whilst \\"You're joking aren't you\\" got only 19%.https://twitter.com/Podcastard/status/759033743264784388 The following week, when asked \\"One more week for Plumb?\\", \\"Oh go on then\\" won with 87%, to only 13% for \\"not a chance in hell\\" on a turnout of 663.https://twitter.com/Podcastard/status/761204282721001472 =Games= Most of the games featured on the podcast are from the radio show, but in addition, there are some podcast exclusive games that Greg and Chris play. * Mug on a Dog - Most episodes after 25 April 2014, when the idea originally intended for the radio show was first suggested by Chris, contain the game 'Mug on a Dog'. This involves Greg and Chris attempting to throw coins into a mug taped to a pink moving poodle named Travis. Terminology has been created to describe events in the game - a rimshot is when the coin bounces along the rim of the mug, whereas 'bounce out' is when a coin dives into the mug before bouncing back out. The games can get very tense, with the loser (usually Greg) often getting particularly angry at the loss. A guide explaining how to create a 'Mug on a Dog' was posted on the Podcastard Twitter. The game sadly had to be postponed during the episode on 20 February 2015 due to Chris Smith without the news dramatically shattering the mug, before being ordered to leave by Greg. It returned briefly in late 2016. * Hat on a Cat - After the final game of Mug on a Dog was played on the podcast on 13 March 2015, a new game was born. 'Hat on a Cat' had been discussed on a few occasions as an appropriate successor to the popular coin throwing game, and so on 20 March 2015, it debuted on the podcast. The game is essentially 'Mug on a Dog' but with a different toy animal and jingle. Greg and Chris take it in turns to throw coins into a felt hat, stitched onto the back of a cat. The first person to make a successful throw into the hat is that week's winner. Hat on a Cat was the first video broadcast through Greg's personal Periscope on 2 April 2015. In May 2015 Hat on a cat was replaced by BALL HEAD. * Guess the Emoji - The game involves either Greg or Chris closing their eyes while the other impersonates an emoji, such as winky-smiley, then whoever has their eyes closed must guess the emoji. Greg's preferred emoji to act out is the aubergine. * Ball Head ‚Äì Greg and Chris take it in turns to throw a ball at each other's head, with the winner being the person with the most hits. During December, this is replaced with Bauble Head, where the balls are exchanged for Christmas baubles. * Cheese Ball ‚Äì A Babybel cheese is thrown onto a court made of cheese slices. =Discussion topics= * Greg and Chris have discussed the possibility of creating podcast merchandise, with some Podcastards sending in T-shirt designs and other merchandise ideas, some of which were posted on the Podcastard Twitter account. Ideas for merchandise include a T-shirt with a picture of the Ghost Owl on it or the slogan \\"I can't work off a survey if it's not in the right place, Simon!\\" * On 25 July 2014, the idea was first suggested that they would organise a meet up at a pub in Meriden, West Midlands, however after several weeks of putting back the day of the meetup, Greg said it wasn't going to happen. The potential for a podcast cheese and wine evening is still discussed. * On 29 August 2014, Greg asked where the cut-off point is for pilots going from Canada to Australia where they go the other way around the Earth. His question was later answered by a Podcastard. =Characters= The podcast features several recurring comedy characters, involving Greg and Chris speaking through the voice changer to make their voices very high or very low. These recurring characters include: * CERN Workers - One of the CERN workers is a receptionist at the Large Hadron Collider and the other makes deliveries, meaning the two often converse with each other on topics including what happens when hadrons are collided. In one discussion, one of the workers asks the other if they have received the delivery of sub-atomic particles, but is disappointed when it emerges there were no such particles in stock. They first featured on 7 March 2014, when chatting about how an orange represents the Earth. * Tiny Ken and Tiny Terry - The two tiny Radio 2 DJ's Ken Bruce and Terry Wogan are the tiny relatives of the normal sized Radio 2 DJ's of the same names. They often appear in links on the podcast and answer birthday requests from the listeners. Terry's catchphrase is \\"more power to your elbow\\". It emerged on the 5 September 2014 podcast that Tiny Ken Bruce's middle name was 'The' and his parents were Morag and Terrance. Tiny Terry said he had 6 children who were all called Terry. This has been retired since the death of Terry Wogan. * Ghost Owl - The Ghost Owl was a once living pet of the podcast, who hooted to signal that Chris and Greg had to move on with the podcast. It died because it wasn't fed and has haunted the show ever since with the occasional scary hooting. The Ghost Owl has also made appearances on the radio show as a secret greeting to the Podcastards, who then reply on Twitter with the hashtag #WhatAHoot. * Butter Monster - The Butter Monster is the monster in all butter and loves dirty butter, where the butter is covered in crumbs, Nutella, Marmite and other bits of food that typically make their way onto the surface of butter. He first appeared on the podcast on 28 November 2014 and still tries to find out, if the light goes off when the fridge door is closed or not. His relative the Brandy Butter Monster made a brief appearance on the 19 December 2014 podcast, where he talked about how he enjoys the attention he gets around Christmas. * Tiny Celebrities - Despite Ken and Terry being the main tiny celebrities, there have been several other miniature celebrity appearances on the podcast and Greg and Chris often listen in to tiny celebrity parties where a variety of celebrities feature. Tiny Brian Cox featured on 16 Jan 2015 when he introduced his 'Mooncast', however, he died shortly after when Greg sat on him. Tiny Kanye West, a self-obsessed, angry tiny celebrity, and Tiny Kevin Pietersen, who often accuses people of bullying him, also appear on the podcast. * Fog Horn - Occasionally a barge passes through, with the fog horn sounding, each time slightly louder. * The Love Gremlin - A character with a very similar voice to the Butter Monster but more posh and not from the north. He is in love with love and therefore has an obsession with the podcastard Elizabeth and enjoys tinkling on his ivories for her. * Ant the Snail - The editor of the show. Has his own theme tune whenever he comes on, Greg refuses to post a picture of Ant to any social media sites because he wants the listeners to believe that Ant is actually a snail. Ant also has his own section of the podcastard, called \\"Ant Danbury's Science Fact\\". Similar to Doctor Tiny's science fact, apart from Ant's science fact is made up. However, he has said that at some point he will throw a real science fact into the mix and podcastards have got to find out when this is. =Songs and theme tunes= Both Greg and Chris have created songs for the podcast with varied levels of success. * Mug on a Dog - This song was written as a theme for the game of the same name by Chris who created the music for the song on Garageband. The song begins with \\"mug, mug, mug-mug-a-mug on, dog, dog, dog-dog-a-dogeey\\", followed by the chorus which repeats the title of the song. The lyrics differ slightly before and after the game - before the game, the lyric is 'it's time for a game of mug on a dog' whereas after it changes to 'that was a game of mug on a dog'. * Hat on a Cat - Following the revamp of the Mug on a Dog game to Hat on a Cat, a new jingle had to be created. The lyrics have been changed slightly to fit the new game as every \\"mug\\" from the original song has been replaced with \\"hat\\" and every \\"dog\\" replaced with \\"cat\\". * The Ghost Owl - Also written and created by Chris, The Ghost Owl is written about the dead owl and features some spooky backing vocals from Chris, while Chris sings on top about having an encounter with the owl. He sings \\"if you hear a spectral hooting as you listen to the free download, it's the ghost owl\\". It debuted on the podcasts first birthday, on 24 October 2014. The chorus of the song is \\"it's the ghost owl (the phantom of the podcast), the ghost owl (toowit, toowooh)\\". It can be listened to on Chris Smith's Soundcloud. * Poddy-Podcast Song - This was a song Greg made as the soundtrack for the podcast. Greg sings a cappella the words \\"poddy, poddy, pod, pod, pod, pod, podcast, poddy, poddy, pod, podcast\\" repeated four times. * Ball Head - This song was written by George, a listener of the podcast after Greg James stated he wanted a theme tune made for it. Played every week at the start and end of Ball Head. The lyrics are \\"Let's play a game with Chris Smith with the news and Greg James. But don't lose your head 'cause it's time for another game of Ball Head!\\" * A Song Just For You, Nick - After several weeks of the Ball Head theme being used a listener called Nick emailed in a said he didn't like the theme tune. In the week that followed, George had written and recorded a heated response song for Nick. He sings \\"You don't like my song, well I hate your face. You have no musical taste\\" as well as \\"I don't like you, or your theme song. WAIT what theme song?\\". * Julia from Germany theme tune - Greg decided that show clerk Julia has earned a theme tune. She picked the backing music with great care as it seems, which is from a German children's TV series called L√∂wenzahn and Chris made up the lyrics. The lyrics are: \\"Das sch√∂ne Fr√§ulein aus Deutschland, sie liebt Eulen und Schokolade. Julia aus Deutschland, Guten Tag.\\" =Recurring references= Several features from other radio and TV shows have featured on the podcast. * What Day is Father's Day? - Taken from a New Zealand radio station, where a radio host asks a caller as part of a quiz what the question would be when given the answer, which was the day of Father's Day. The host then attempted to hint to the caller that she needs to word her answer in the form of a question as she repeatedly gets it wrong. Occasionally Greg plays some lines from the conversation such as \\"I don't know!\\" * Fitness Video - An audio clip in which Eileen Fowler, a fitness instructor, creates an exercise routine with Helen on piano, Roy at the organ and Ray on drums. For a few episodes, the podcast ended with Eileen saying a goodbye from herself and the others. * Chris Needs - During the brainteaser section on the Chris Needs show, a caller asks the brainteaser \\"what goes up a drainpipe down but not down a drainpipe up?\\", he then keeps corrects himself, each time asking slightly different question including \\"what can go up a drainpipe and cannot go down but cannot go down a drainpipe and can go up?\\". After several attempts, Needs gives up and puts the brainteaser to the listeners. * I Can't Work Off A Survey - during the radio feature Rage Against the Answer Machine, a caller phoned in with the rage \\"I can't work off a survey if it's not in the right place Simon!\\" This catchphrase is now repeated often. * Delia Smith - A clip of Delia at a Norwich City football match features her yelling \\"where are you?\\" and \\"let's be having' you!\\" to the crowd. * Get On the Beer Son - On the radio show feature 'Ask the Nation', one caller phoned up to give advice and in doing so said \\"get on the beer son\\". This clip is regularly used at the end of the podcasts. * Peace and love ‚Äì Based on Ringo Starr's video in which he requested people stop sending fan mail and items to be signed, because he's \\"got too much to do\\". Podcast listeners remixed the audio of this video. =Notable podcastards= Several Podcastards have contacted Greg and Chris using the podcasts very own email, some of whom have appeared multiple times on the podcast. * Julia From Germany - Julia Dusold first featured on the podcast after emailing in to say she was standing in front of a post office whilst listening to Chris talk about a post office on the podcast in German. On 26 September 2014, Julia was appointed by Greg as the official show clerk and since then sends an email every week with the podcast agenda to remind Greg and Chris of what to do. She co-hosted the Podcast when she visited the Greg James Show at Radio 1's Academy in Norwich on 13 May 2015. Greg and Julia recorded the Podcast, whilst Chris was absent, in a Pub. On 10 June 2016, Julia joined Chris and Greg to record the podcast at the Radio 1 studios, as well as helping Greg with the Birthday Song and playing Cheeseball.https://twitter.com/Podcastard/status/740908517087940609 Since December 2016, Julia is hosting the feature \\"Julia's Word of the Week\\" where she sends a clip of one single German word each week. This has a theme tune, sung in German and English by Julia. * Elisabeth is the Love Gremlins interest and Greg is using special music when her emails are read out. * Ronni Stefano became Arts Correspondent for the podcast on the episode that aired 29 July 2016 after responding to a tweet that Greg posted asking a podcastard to call up the show whilst he was recording. Ronni is 19 and \\"doesn't do that much\\" apart from sit indoors and occasionally go out with her mates. She is going to university in September 2016. * Natalia the Friendly Foreigner from Poland. A moderately new feature to the podcastard, where Greg and Chris phone a listener of the podcastard who lives abroad. Natalia is the only friendly foreigner who has been on twice and on two consecutive weeks so far, due to her phone not working properly the first time that they tried ringing her. Greg made a big deal about this, and played a clip of Natalia just saying \\"hello\\" over and over again on his drive time show on BBC Radio 1, the Monday after the podcast was released on Friday as part of a plug for his podcast. Natalia then appeared the following week and got to chat to Greg, but Chris was away so she left a message for him to listen to when he got back. * Silva the friendly foreigner - Silva was a friendly foreigner on the podcast that was released on 19/5/2017. She told Greg and Chris that she was pregnant, and this was the first time that something like this had happened on the podcast. Silva's baby will also be the official podcastard baby (I think). Also a notable episode, as Greg decided that he was the Mum on the podcastard, and Chris was the Dad. #CommunalBaby also occurred.

The genus includes more than 80 species, which are all parasitic on the gills of marine fish, especially groupers. Since groupers are mostly abundant in warm waters, species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are found in warm parts of the oceans, especially in coral reefs, but species have also been found in deep- sea groupers. Several species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are pathogens of maricultured groupers.  Morphology P. caledonicus A species of Pseudorhabdosynochus with captions for main parts and organs All species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are small animals, ranging 0.3‚Äì1 mm in length. As most monogeneans, they are flat, with an anterior head bearing four oculi and head glands, a main elongate body and a posterior haptor. The digestive system includes an anterior muscular pharynx, and two lateral intestinal branches (or caeca); as in all Platyhelminthes, there is no anus. The haptor, in the posterior part of the body, is a specialized organ used to attach to the host. The haptor includes sclerotized elements, namely a ventral bar, two lateral (dorsal) bars, two ventral hooks and two dorsal hooks, and fourteen hooklets. As in most diplectanids, the haptor bears special, characteristic, structures called squamodiscs. The squamodiscs (one ventral and one dorsal) of species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are made up of numerous rodlets aligned as concentric rows. All species of the genus have two squamodiscs except Pseudorhabdosynochus sinediscus Neifar & Euzet, 2007 in which these organs are completely lacking. Adults are hermaphroditic. The reproductive organ include a single ovary and a single testis. As in all diplectanids, the ovary (or germarium) is anterior to the testis and loops around the right intestinal caecum. Species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are characterized by a sclerotized male copulatory organ, or \\"quadriloculate organ\\", which has the shape of a bean with four internal chambers. The vagina includes a sclerotized part, which is a complex structure with several chambers and canals, generally used for the diagnosis and differentiation of species. Etymology and nomenclatural case A drawing of the type-species, Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli The origin of the name Pseudorhabdosynochus merits an explanation. ‚ÄòPseudo-‚Äô (from Greek œàŒµœÖŒ¥ŒÆœÇ, pseudes, \\"lying, false\\") is a prefix commonly used in creating a new scientific name for a taxon that superficially appears to be a taxon, but actually is another. The famous Japanese parasitologist Satyu Yamaguti described a ‚Äòmembranous plaque‚Äô on the posterior region of Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli and created the generic name Pseudorhabdosynochus in reference to the diplectanid genus Rhabdosynochus which, in his interpretation, also had lateral plaques. It has been shown later that ‚Äòplaques‚Äô in P. epinepheli was an erroneous interpretation of damaged specimens. Moreover, the diagnosis of Rhabdosynochus was later modified and it is now considered that species of this genus do not have plaques.Kritsky, D. C., Boeger, W. A. & Robaldo, R. B. 2001: Neotropical Monogenoidea. 38. Revision of Rhabdosynochus Mizelle and Blatz, 1941 (Polyonchoinea: Dactylogyridea: Diplectanidae), with descriptions of two new species from Brazil. Comparative Parasitology, 68, 66-75. Therefore, the genus name Pseudorhabdosynochus is the result of both an erroneous observation and an erroneous comparison by Satyu Yamaguti. However, it is valid according to the ICZN. Pseudorhabdosynochus is also an interesting nomenclatural case. Yamaguti described the same species twice, the first time in 1938 (as Diplectanum epinepheli Yamaguti, 1938) and the second time in 1958 Yamaguti, S. 1958: Studies on the helminth fauna of Japan. Part 53. Trematodes of fishes, XII. Publications of the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory, 7, 53-88. Article PDF (as Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli Yamaguti, 1958). In both papers, the species was described from parasites collected from the same fish species, the grouper Epinephelus akaara off Japan. Kritsky & Beverley-Burton (1986) solved this case with reference to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. The type-species of the genus is the name Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli Yamaguti, 1958. Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli Yamaguti, 1958 is a junior synonym of Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli (Yamaguti, 1938) Kritsky & Beverley-Burton, 1986 and Pseudorhabdosynochus epinepheli (Yamaguti, 1938) Kritsky & Beverley-Burton, 1986 is the modern valid combination for Diplectanum epinepheli Yamaguti, 1938. The latter species (a taxon) and the type-species of the genus (a name) are considered to correspond to the same biological taxon but have different, although valid, names. Recent re-examination of type-specimens have confirmed this interpretation. Hosts Grouper, such as the Blacktip Grouper here, harbour Pseudorhabdosynochus species on their gills Species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are parasitic exclusively on the gill filaments of marine fish. Most of these fish belong to the family Serranidae and are commonly known as groupers, such as many species of the genus Epinephelus, and also species of Cephalopholis, Mycteroperca and Variola. A few species have also been described from fish of the genera Alphestes, Paranthias and Paralabrax. As most diplectanids,Oliver, G. (1987). Les Diplectanidae Bychowsky, 1957 (Monogenea, Monopisthocotylea, Dactylogyridea). Syst√©matique. Biologie. Ontog√©nie. √âcologie. Essai de phylogen√®se. Th√®se d'√âtat, Acad√©mie de Montpellier, Universit√© des Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc, France. species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are generally strictly species-specific, i.e. a species is found on a single species of host and no others. However, several exceptions have been reported. Some species of groupers harbour a wide biodiversity of Pseudorhabdosynochus species (and sometimes other monogeneans as well). Examples are Epinephelus maculatus which has 8 distinct Pseudorhabdosynochus species, and Epinephelus malabaricus which has 7 species. Life cycle Adult Pseudorhabdosynochus lantauensis (arrows) on the gill filament of a grouper. Scanning electron microscopy. The life cycle of Pseudorhabdosynochus species is similar to that of other diplectanid monogeneans. It is monoxenous, i.e. there is a single host, the fish. The life-cycle includes a parasitic phase, the adult worm, and two stages which are free in the environment, the egg and the larva. The adult hermaphroditic worm, which lives on the gills of fish, lays eggs in the water. The egg has an operculum. A larva develops in the egg and hatches through the operculum; the swimming larva is ciliated and called an oncomiracidium. The larva finds its host by swimming to it, first attaches to the skin and migrates to the gills, and eventually transforms itself into a young monogenean which is attached to the gill filament by its haptor. During transformation from larva to adult, the monogenean loses its cilia and produces a new tegument, a phenomenon which is considered a general characteristic of the parasitic Platyhelminthes or Neodermata.Ehlers, U. (1985). Das Phylogenetische System der Plathelminthes. Stuttgart: G. Fischer. Information is available for the life-cycle of Pseudorhabdosynochus lantauensis, a parasite of the orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides, at a temperature of 30 ¬∞C. The adult lays 10-22 eggs/day. The eggs hatch within 2‚Äì4 days. The oncomiracidium is viable for 4-8 h and should find a host within this delay. After attachment, the oncomiracidium transforms into an adult in 4‚Äì7 days. The parasite produces eggs after 7 days. The life-cycle is thus complete in 13‚Äì20 days (at 30 ¬∞C). Certain species of Pseudorhabdosynochus parasitize groupers which show spawning aggregations, i.e. the adult fish gather annually at a precise location and meet other fish of their own species only once per year. It has been suggested that transmission of Pseudorhabdosynochus species occurs preferentially during these spawning aggregations, from older infected fish to younger, uninfected, fish. Pathology and control in mariculture Species of Pseudorhabdosynochus are attached to the gills of groupers. No information is available on the pathogen effect of these parasites in wild groupers. Since the life-cycle is monoxenous and thus can be completed with a high rate of success in mariculture condition, species of Pseudorhabdosynochus can proliferate on gills of cultured groupers and become dangerous for the fish, inducing mortality. Parasite infections are often measured by two variables, prevalence (the proportion of infected hosts) and intensity (the number of parasites per host). Prevalences as high as 100% (i.e. all fish are infected) have been reported for Pseudorhabdosynochus sp. in cage-cultured Epinephelus malabaricus in Thailand,Ruangpan, L. & Tubkaew, R. (1993). Parasites of the cage cultured grouper Epinephelus malabaricus in Thailand. Paper presented at the Proceedings of Grouper Culture, Kaoseng, Songkhla, Thailand. for Pseudorhabdosynochus sp. on Epinephelus fuscoguttatus and Epinephelus coioides maricultured in Indonesia, and for P. beverleyburtonae on Epinephelus marginatus, wild or maricultured, in Brazil. Intensities are as high as up to 1,006 individual Pseudorhabdosynochus sp. per fish (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) in Indonesia, up to 294 P. coioidesis per fish (Epinephelus coioides) in South China, 327 P. yucatanensis per fish on Epinephelus morio in Mexico, and 500 P. epinepheli per 100 grams of gill filaments of Epinephelus akaara in Japan. Eradication of gill parasitic monogeneans is a problem because various chemical treatments can be harmful for the fish. Treatments used against Pseudorhabdosynochus species include freshwater, diluted formalin, and diluted hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Diluted hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) seems the preferred treatment for P. epinepheli on Epinephelus akaara and P. lantauensis on Epinephelus coioides.

History New York executive John Cobb bought 3660 acres for a hunting preserve he called Sedgefield for sedge broom found there. After he died in 1923, Southern Real Estate Co. bought the land and planned a community there. A.W. McAlister, a major investor in the company, built a headquarters for his insurance company Pilot Life. Southern Real Estate built the first 18-hole golf course and Tudor style inn at Sedgefield Country Club in 1929, intending it to be like Pinehurst Resort. Valley Brook course was designed by Donald Ross, also a designer of Pinehurst. The Great Depression interfered with further plans, however, and a second Ross-designed course and business district never happened. Still, the community became a town, though not an incorporated one, with its own sewage service, water system, and sheriff's deputies acting as its police force. Even the approach of Greensboro and High Point, with the threat of annexation by those cities, did not result in incorporation. Sedgefield was the first home to the Greater Greensboro Open golf tournament when it started in 1938, alternating with Starmount Country Club until 1961, and hosting every year until 1976. The tournament returned to Sedgefield in 2008 with the name Wyndham Championship.

Assuming that all participants have not been annihilated, there may arise a scenario unique to military strategy and theory, one in which all or some of the parties involved strive to continue fighting until the other side is completely defeated.  Origin of the phrase  Broken-backed war theory was first formally elaborated on in the 1952 British Defence White Paper, to describe what would presumably happen after a major nuclear exchange. The American \\"New Look Strategy of 1953/54\\" utterly rejected the notion of broken-backed war. They dropped the term from the 1955 white paper, and the phrase has since faded from common usage.  Commentary  Klaus Knorr purported, that in a broken-backed war scenario, only military weapons and vehicles on hand prior to the sustained hostilities would be of use, as the economic potential of both sides would be, at least in theory, utterly shattered. Herman Kahn in his tome On Thermonuclear War, posited that a broken-backed war is implausible, because one side would likely absorb vastly more damage than its opposition. As he was writing in the late 1950s, when the nuclear arsenals of the Soviet Union and the United States numbered in the tens of thousands, the validity of this statement in the modern war can be called into question. The nuclear strategist Bernard Brodie argued that this form of conflict may be impractical simply because it is almost impossible to plan for. His writings on the subject came before the advent of counter-force doctrine, and during a time of nuclear plenty, when it was safe to assume that a nuclear exchange would render a nation's industry useless.Bernard Brodie, Strategy in the Missile AgeIMPLICATIONS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN TOTAL WAR; Bernard Brodie, 1957Nuclear Weapons and Changing Strategic Outlooks; Bernard Brodie, 1956 During the Cold War, Colonel Virgil Ney hypothesized that a nuclear exchange alone would not be enough to defeat the Soviet Union, and he argued for a modest construction of underground facilities and infrastructure. In popular culture In the novel, Final Blackout by L. Ron Hubbard, the conflict between the survivors of London and the United States has been characterized as a broken-backed war by some critics. The table-top role-playing game Twilight 2000 released by Game Designers' Workshop in 1984 entails a broken-backed war; in the aftermath of a nuclear exchange in 1997, by 2000, Warsaw Pact and NATO forces are still fighting for a decisive victory in Europe and elsewhere with dwindling conventional arms and munitions.

Karishma is a childhood friend of Balasaheb and has a crush on him, but he is unaware of that. He gets nightmares of his marriage which was broken right before they took vows because of a power tussle between Annasaheb's and bride's father. He consults a few doctors, but they tell him that he is perfectly normal. On returning from Pune city after consulting a doctor, they visit a theatre academy because his friend is fond of theatre and wants to check for any courses there. They find that there is a play in session and decides to attend it. The play is on social stigma associated with lesbian love written and directed by Urmi. After the play Urmi explains her views & inspiration behind the play & Balasaheb is smitten by her. His father aspire that he would continue his lineage by becoming candidate for his party in the next election, but Balasaheb seems to have lost purpose in his life after his broken marriage. His mother is very fond of him & tries to provide him emotional support. He spends time drinking, women & he keeps on drifting aimlessly. However after the watching the play he is feels that he has found some purpose. Later he has an argument with father & Balasaheb berates him of his corrupt practices & how his lust of power resulted in his broken marriage. His father challenges him to get just two followers on his own without money or his influence aandonly then he would come to terms with harsh realities of power and money. He tries calling all his friends & he realises that everyone is avoiding him except 2 of his close friends Jeevan & Vicky. He gives a stash of cash to Jeevan to pursue the course at the theatre academy. All three of them attend the course and post session they have a casual chat with the Urmi who is one of the instructors at the course. She bluntly questions Balasaheb what has he has achieved in life to deserve title of sir. Balasaheb doesn't have any answer & is embarrassed. She then takes a promise from him that he would use his political clout to help his friend become a scriptwriter (in turn giving voice to free speech). He resolves to fulfill the promise & when he returns to his village he assembles his friends for the play written by Jeevan which they would present in a competition. Balasaheb again has argument with Annasaheb who wants him to wrap up his play & focus on forthcoming elections. Balasaheb enraged leaves his home, but his mother keeps in touch with his friends to keep a tab on his well-being. As the cast starts practising it seems that none of them have any talent for acting. Balasaheb plays a character of poet, however his pitch & actions are that of rich landlord. Here Annasaheb puts making hurdles in his play to get him ready for forthcoming elections, but Balasaheb remains firm on his resolve & overcomes each of them. He receives support from his mother, later from each member of the play & finally from his entire village. With emotional turmoil and unable to get his pitch of that of a helpless commoner it takes a toll on his emotional state. Later the when the play is staged at the competition, everything goes well till the entry of Balasaheb. When he enters he is unable to enact his role & breaks down in front of the audience. He then narrates to them how his team assembled the play despite their tough living conditions.

It is usually isolated or rises above other surrounding foothills, and is often, but not always, of volcanic origin. Conical hills or mountains occur in different shapes and are not necessarily geometrically-shaped cones; some are more tower-shaped or have an asymmetric curve on one side. Typically, however, they have a circular base and smooth sides with a gradient of up to 30¬∞. Such conical mountains are found in all volcanically-formed areas of the world such as the Bohemian Central Uplands in the Czech Republic, the Rh√∂n in Germany or the Massif Central in France.  Term  The conical hill as a geomorphological term first appeared in the German language, as Kegelberg, coined by Goethe and geologists of his era. From their natural appearance these were mostly basaltic or phonolitic landforms in the shape of a mathematical cone, hence why the term came to be used in the early geological literature. The first systematic geological mapping of the Kingdom of Saxony, proposed and started by Abraham Gottlob Werner, describes, in his later works, numerous mountains and hills of volcanic or subvolcanic origin as Kegel (\\"cone\\") or Kegelberg (\\"conical hill/mountain\\"). The term was introduced more definitively by Carl Friedrich Naumann in Notes to Section VII of the Geognostic Charter of the Kingdom of Saxony and its Adjacent Territories (Erl√§uterungen zu Section VII der geognostischen Charte des K√∂nigreiches Sachsen und der angr√§nzenden L√§nderabtheilungen) thus: \\"The ordinary form of basalt and phonolitic hills is generally so wonderfully uniform that you can often recognize them even from a distance. They are cones. Of course, this typical form has many variations; the [normally] round base may be elongated, the peak may take the form of a rocky crest or ridge, ... but most forms can be reduced at least to a conical or a cone-segment shape. ... Flat ridges are then arranged in rows, out of which rise only a very isolated basalt or phonolite cones.\\"Naumann: Section VII, pp. 61-62 In this work, which was published by Naumann and later revised by Bernhard Cotta, the most important hills are described in the relevant map sheets, for example: 33. The Mittenberg, a conical hill in the centre between Tollenstein, Sch√∂nfeld and Neuh√ºtte; rock, coarse splinters, with grey feldspar crystals.Naumann: Section VII, p. 94 Today the descriptors \\"cone\\", \\"conical hill\\" or \\"conical mountain\\" are mainly used as morphological terms in geography for a steep-sided, isolated hill or mountain, because they are not always seen or described in connexion with volcanic processes.Hartmut Leser (ed.): Diercke W√∂rterbuch Allgemeine Geographie. Munich, (dtv) 2005, p. 421 .  Formation  Mount Damavand, Iran = Volcanic cone = Mount Fuji, Japan All stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes have a tendency to form a cone at the surface. However, stratovolcanoes are able to form steeper sides whilst shield volcanoes only form very flat cones. The reason for this is that stratovolcanoes are composed largely of solid, eruptive material, whereas shield volcanoes are built up mainly by fluid lava flows. Over the course of time, after several eruptions, a cone of debris forms from the eruptive material. The natural conical shape so formed is simply a result of the fact that the amount of ejected material decreases with the radially distance from the crater. The layer of debris deposited is greater near the volcano than further away, so the volcano grows more rapidly close to the crater itself. The slope gradient of the resulting volcano is dependent both on the angle of repose as well as the speed at which the volcano is weathered. The angle of repose is, in turn, dependent on the composition of the lava, its viscosity and rate of solidification, and also the amount of ejected loose rock. Many volcanoes tend to produce subsidiary craters or adventive cones. These are new openings formed on the sides of the volcano through which new material is ejected sometimes only on one side. As a result, these mountains lose their ideal conical shape. The formation of an almost perfect conical mountain or hill is only possible where there is a stable, central crater. Many volcanoes are therefore only conical from one direction of view; from other angles they appear to have an irregular shape or bulges. = Karst cones = Chocolate Hills, Philippines Conical hills may form in tropical karst regions, such terrain being known as kegelkarst. A typical example of non-volcanic conical hills are the Chocolate Hills in Bohol on the Philippines. = Erosion-formed cones = In almost all mountain regions of the world, conical peaks may be formed by erosion processes, but they are not usually isolated landforms. Often they arise through the formation of ordinary riverine meanders. But they can also result from the action of an entrenched river that has cut deeply into a plateau. The resulting cutoff meander spur may be cone-shaped. = Artificial cone hills = Former conical tips at the Wismut mining company works in Thuringia The artificially created hills or mounds associated, for example, with mining also tend to be cone-shaped. These artificial hills are also free-standing and, once tipping has finished, they may become conical hills overgrown with vegetation. However, as artificial features they are classed as spoil tips rather than natural hills.

The 34th Infantry Division Band continued to move with the division throughout the Italian Campaign both performing concerts and assuming their combat duties when required. Notable events during this time include performing for a massive review of British and US 5th Army forces by Prime Minister Winston Churchill and a concert featuring NBC Orchestra conductor Andre Kostelanetz and renowned singer Lily Pons for audience of over 8,000.

In 2006 the city of Appleton, Minnesota approached the 34th Infantry Division Band to request the performance of a new song in honor of their substantial veteran community. In spring of 2006 the unit premiered the Daniel Kallman composition Streets of Honor in the city of Appleton, paying tribute to World War II era Red Bull soldiers. Later that year the 34th Infantry Division Band recorded its first full-length album featuring Streets of Honor, John Philip Sousa's Minnesota March and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy in the style of Minnesota's own Andrews Sisters. In early 2007 the 34th Infantry Division Band was awarded the Colonel George S. Howard Citation of Musical Excellence for Military Concert Bands.COL George S.

In May 2009 the 34th Infantry Division Band recorded the Iraqi national anthem Mawtini in Arabic in an unused dining facility at COB Basra, Iraq. The unit is the first, and possibly only coalition military band to perform Mawtini in Iraq's predominate language. At a transfer of authority ceremony on 20 May 2009 a short recording of Mawtini was broadcast by Iraqi media throughout the country and later made into a highly successful ring tone. The unit's recording of Mawtini was later set to photos and distributed by US Psychological Operations and the US State Department in civil efforts and as a token of friendship between coalition personnel and Iraqi nationals.34th Infantry Division Band \\"Mawtini\\" Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQHW5rJOjuM Additionally, the 34th Infantry Division recorded a full-length album of traditional Iraqi folk songs. In recognition of Independence Day the 34th Infantry Division Band joined the 1st Cavalry Division Band, 25th Infantry Division Band and 56th Army Band for a combined tour of the Iraqi theater.

An elevated settlement on a tidal plain, a Dutch outpost was set up in Agats in 1938 and the town became notable for the cultural practices of the Asmat people. Following the formation of Asmat Regency in 2002, the town became its administrative seat. Administrative villages Agats District consists of 12 villages (kampung), namely: # Asuwetsy # Bis Agats (the town) # Bisman # Bou # Briten (Biriten/Beriten) # Kaye # Mbait # Per # Saw # Suwru # Uwus # Yamoth (Yomoth) History Though Agats had been populated by the Asmat people for some time, as a largely waterfront settlement, the first non-native settlement originated in the late 1930s when a Catholic mission was established in the area, and later in 1938 the Dutch East Indies government established an outpost there. Due to the Second World War, however, the Dutch abandoned the Agats post in 1942 due to the Japanese presence. In 1953, the Catholic mission was made permanent and the following year the Dutch government of Netherlands New Guinea established a permanent post in Agats, banning headhunting practices. During this period, Asmat woodcarving became popular, with collectors, museum representatives, ethnographers and scientists visiting the area. One such person, Michael Rockefeller, disappeared after departing Agats for Southern Asmat in 1961, and was presumed dead. On 29 May 1969, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Agats was established, with American Alphonse Sowada becoming its first bishop. The Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress (Museum Kebudayaan dan Kemajuan Asmat) was opened in Agats in 1973. The Asmat Cultural Festival, held annually in the town, began in 1981. After Asmat became its own regency in 2002, Agats ‚Äì being its administrative seat ‚Äì saw a boost in building due to a need for government facilities and an increase of migrants, largely Bugis and Moluccans, with the annual population growth of Agats being as high as 22 percent between 2005 and 2011 compared to 3 percent for Asmat Regency. In recent years, the wooden roads in Agats have begun to be replaced by concrete ones by the regency's government. Following a major famine which struck Asmat Regency, in 2018 Indonesian President Joko Widodo offered to relocate residents of more remote areas to Agats, though the relocation faced significant resistance.  Geography  Agats is located on the delta of the Asewets River, in a tidal lowland area. Due to this, during high tides the water may rise up to above sea level, resulting in the unique construction of the town in which all buildings and roads are elevated with wooden, and more recently concrete, structures. Administratively, the urban settlement is located within the kampung of Bis Agats, which had a population of 8,998 in 2016. =Climate= Agats has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with very heavy rainfall year-round. Transport and facilities Agats is served by pioneer, government-subsidized flights from Merauke and Mimika through the nearby Ewer Airport , in addition to passenger boats to Timika and Merauke. Both the airport and the river port are planned for upgrades in 2019, allowing the airport to take larger ATR aircraft and the river port to take larger \\"\\" ships. Recently introduced electric motorcycles are used for transport in the city, with electrical charging stations run by PLN. A public hospital is present in Agats. As the water of the Asewetz next to the town is brackish and polluted, the town largely depends on rainwater and bottled water, in addition to pumped water from another river nearby.

An influential figure in the Safavid state, Pari Khan Khanum was well educated and knowledgeable in traditional Islamic sciences such as jurisprudence, and was an accomplished poet. She played a crucial role in securing the succession of her brother Ismail II (r. 1576‚Äì1577) to the Safavid throne. During Ismail's brief reign, her influence lessened, but then increased during the reign of Ismail's successor, Mohammad Khodabanda (r. 1578‚Äì1587), even becoming the de facto ruler of the Safavid state for a short period. She was strangled to death on 12February 1578 at Qazvin because her influence and power were perceived as dangerous by the Qizilbash. Biography =Youth= Pari Khan Khanum was born as the second daughter of the Safavid shah TahmaspI by his Circassian wife Sultan-Agha Khanum in August 1548 at Ahar. When his brother Bahram Mirza Safavi died in 1549, Tahmasp took care of his children, even proclaiming prince Badi-al Zaman Mirza Safavi his own son. He appointed him as the governor of Sistan in 1557, and offered him Pari Khan Khanum (who was at that time 10 years old) as a wife, which he accepted. However, since she was Tahmasp's favored daughter, she was not allowed to go alongside her husband to Sistan. Historians including Shoreh Gholsorki, author of a 1995 study of Pari Khan Khanum, believe that she was only engaged to Badi al-Zaman and that no marriage took place, since Pari Khan Khanum chose a bureaucratic life in the capital alongside her father over married life in Sistan. =Succession disputes= Chehel Sotun palace in Qazvin, where Pari Khan Khanum resided Pari Khan Khanum's participation in the affairs of the Safavid state started during the last years of Tahmasp's reign. Disenchanted with the bureaucratic life, her father granted her the authority and legal status that provided the basis for her later rise to power. On 18 October 1574 Tahmasp became ill and twice came close to dying without having chosen a successor. Pari Khan Khanum took care of him during his illness, bringing them even closer. Simultaneously, the main chieftains of the Qizilbash arranged a meeting to discuss who should be the successor. The Ustalju clan and the Shaykhavand clan (which was related to the Safavid family) favored Tahmasp's son Haydar Mirza Safavi. The Georgians also supported him since his mother was Georgian. The Rumlu, Afshar, and the Qajar clan favored Ismail Mirza Safavi, Haydar's older brother, who was jailed in the Qahqaheh Castle. Pari Khan Khanum also favored Ismail Mirza, and she had the support of the Circassians. During Tahmasp's illness, supporters of Haydar Mirza sent a message to the Khalifa Ansar Qaradghlu, castellan of Qahqaheh Castle, and requested that he have Ismail Mirza killed. However, Pari Khan Khanum uncovered the plot and told Tahmasp about it. Tahmasp, who still had some feelings for Ismail Mirza due to the latter's courage during the encounters with the Ottoman Empire, sent a group of Afshar musketeers to the Qahqaheh Castle to safeguard him. Two months later, Tahmasp recovered from his illness; he died two years later, on 14May 1576, in Qazvin. Haydar Mirza was the only son who was with Tahmasp when he died. The following day, he announced himself as the new shah. Normally, some Qizilbash men would guard the royal palace and take turns serving guard with other others. Unfortunately for Haydar Mirza, on that day all the Qizilbash guards were from the Rumlu, Afshar, Qajar, Bayat, or the Dorsaq tribesall loyal supporters of Ismail Mirza. When Haydar Mirza realized the danger of his unprotected position, he took Pari Khan Khanum (who was also in the palace) as a hostage. Pari Khan Khanum then \\"threw herself at her brother's feet in the presence of Haydar Mirza's mother\\", and tried to urge him to let her leave the palace, stating that she was the first to acknowledge his rule by prostrating herself before him: she vowed that she would attempt to persuade Ismail Mirza's supporters (including her full brother Suleiman Mirza and her Circassian uncle Shamkhal Sultan) to change their mind. Haydar Mirza accepted her request, and gave her permission to leave the palace, but she broke her oath and gave Shamkhal Sultan the keys to the palace gate. Haydar Mirza's supporters hurried to his palace to save him, but the palace guards, who disliked Haydar Mirza even after he had tried to win them to his side by declaring several assurances, closed the gates, while Ismail Mirza's supporters entered the palace and went to its inner part. Haydar Mirza's supporters managed to break through the gate, but did not reach there in timeIsmail Mirza's supporters discovered Haydar Mirza, dressed as a woman in the royal harem, and beheaded him. His bloody head was then thrown down to Haydar Mirza's supporters, who gave in and thus allowed Ismail Mirza to ascend the throne as IsmailII. =De facto ruler of the Safavid realm= Under Ismail II Shah Ismail II holding court During the dynastic struggle between Haydar Mirza and Ismail Mirza, Pari Khan Khanum became the de facto ruler of the state; it was she who ordered all the princes and top-ranking members of the realm to gather at Qazvin's main mosque on 23May 1576, where cleric Mir Makhdum Sharifi Shirazi read the khotbeh in the name of Ismail Mirza, confirming him as the new shah of the Safavid dynasty. Ismail Mirza, who was still in the Qahqaheh Castle, was soon escorted out of the place with thousands of Qizilbash warriors, reaching the outskirts of Qazvin on 4June 1576. In the course of the 31 days following the death of Tahmasp, the henchmen and chieftains of the Qizilbash clans had visited the palace of Pari Khan Khanum every day and, according to Iskandar Beg Munshi, \\"informed her of the urgent business of the realm be it fiscal or financial or to do with politics of the day and nobody had any inclination or dared to disobey her command\\". After entering Qazvin, Ismail Mirza did not advance to the regal palace directly since the astrologists had stated that the time was ominous. He thus stayed for 14 days at the house of Husaynquli Khulafa, the leader of the Rumlu clan and the Khalifat al-Khulafa (administrator of Sufi affairs). Although Ismail Mirza held the title of shah, the majority of the Qizilbash officers and high-ranking statesmen continued to visit Pari Khan Khanum's palace. At the same time, Pari Khan Khanum had managed to organize a remarkable court for herself \\"where her attendants and ladies-in-waiting acted as if they were serving at a proper royal court\\". Ismail Mirza ascended to the crown under the dynastic name of IsmailII on 22August 1576. His 19 years of imprisonment in the Qahqaheh castle had greatly affected him, and he was not inclined to allow displays of authority by any other individual. He announced that it was prohibited for Qizilbash chieftains, officers, and high-ranking officials to enter Pari Khan Khanum's palace. He dissolved the duties of her wardens and her court servants and seized an extensive collection of properties belonging to her. Moreover, he displayed a cold and non- approachable behaviour towards her when he allowed her an audience. Ismail II's lack of gratitude toward Pari Khan Khanum, who had fought so hard to make him shah of the Safavid dynasty, made her feel hostile towards him, and motivated her to exact vengeance. On 25November 1577 IsmailII died abruptly and without any initial signs of bad health. The court doctors, who checked the corpse, surmised that he may have died from poison. The general agreement was that Pari Khan Khanum had resolved to have him poisoned with the help of the mistresses of the inner harem in retaliation for his bad behaviour towards her. With IsmailII out of the way, Pari Khan Khanum regained her authority and control. State grandees, clan chieftains, officers, and officials carried out the orders delivered by her deputies and served according to her word. Alarmed that the announcement of IsmailII's death would start discontent in the capital, the aristocracy kept the doors of the palace locked until a decision was reached regarding the succession. According to some accounts, after IsmailII's death a group of statesmen asked Pari Khan Khanum to succeed her brother, which offer she apparently declined. In order to clear up the succession crisis, the Qizilbash chieftains agreed to appoint the future shah after consulting with each other and then notifying Pari Khan Khanum of their choice. At first they discussed the resolution that Shoja al-Din Mohammad Safavi, the eight-month-old infant son of IsmailII, should be crowned as shah while in reality state affairs would be taken care of by Pari Khan Khanum. This suggestion, however, did not obtain the approval of most of the assembly since it would have swayed the balance of power among many Qizilbash clans. Ultimately the assembly agreed to appoint Mohammad Khodabanda, the elder brother of IsmailII, as shah. Under Mohammad Khodabanda Coin minted during the reign of Mohammad Khodabanda The appointment of Mohammad Khodabanda was supported and approved by Pari Khan Khanum, due to him being a pleasure- seeking, nearly blind man of old age. Since he was the approved successor, Pari Khan Khanum could take advantage of his weakness and rule herself. She made an agreement with the Qizilbash chieftains that Mohammad Khodabanda would remain shah in name, while she and her envoys would continue directing the interests of the state. When Mohammad Khodabanda was crowned shah, the Safavid aristocracy, officers, and provincial governors wanted approval from Pari Khan Khanum to give him a congratulating visit. Pari Khan Khanum's sphere of influence and authority was so enormous that no one had the courage to visit Shiraz without her unambiguous approval. From the day Mohammad Khobanda was appointed shah, his wife Khayr al-Nisa Begum, who was better known by her title of Mahd-e Olya, took control of his affairs. She was aware of her husband's deficiencies, and to make up for his lack of uprightness and quality she resolved to try to become the practical ruler of the Safavid state. Mohammad Khodabanda and Mahd-e Olya entered the environs of Qazvin on 12February 1578. This brought an end to the indisputable rule that Pari Khan Khanum had enjoyed for two months and 20 days. Although she was still the practical ruler of the state, she would now meet opposition from Mahd-e Olya and her allies. When they reached the city, Pari Khan Khanum gladly received them with great grandeur and a parade, sitting in a golden-spun litter, while being guarded by 4,000‚Äì5,000 private guards, inner-harem personal assistants, and court attendants. =Death= Mahd-e Olya was informed by the welcoming social gatherings in Qazvin of the great influence and power held by Pari Khan Khanum, thus confirming what she had already been told by Mirza Salman Jaberi, the former grand vizier of IsmailII. She then realized that as long as Pari Khan Khanum was alive, she would not be able to dominate the interests of the Safavid state and become the de facto ruler of the country. She thus began planning to have her killed. The order was executed in 12 February 1578, when Khalil Khan Afshar, who had served as Pari Khan Khanum's tutor during the reign of Tahmasp. While Pari Khan Khanum was enroute to her home with her servants, Khalil Khan Afshar appeared with his men and a fight ensued. Pari Khan Khanum was eventually seized and taken to his home, where he had her strangled to death. Her uncle, Shamkhal Sultan, was executed shortly afterward, and IsmailII's son Shoja al-Din Mohammad Safavi was murdered.

It existed between 1973 and 1978. The magazine was based in London. History and profile The first issue appeared in 1973: it was a collection of poems by Barry, Edwards, Hampson and Jim Stewart with graphic work by John Simpson, Robert Snell and Sibani Raychaudhuri. The work was printed on different colours and sizes of paper - and contained in a plastic bag.jacket2org/interviews/transatlantic- axis-alembic It was sold at the Edinburgh Festival of 1973, where Hampson was working with the Liverpool-based multimedia group Zoom Cortex. (See Adrian Henri, Events and Happenings, Thames and Hudson, for Zoom Cortex.)The second issue maintained the same format (a collection of loose pages in a plastic bag) but with an increased number of poets. Richard Kostelanetz's assemblages have been described by the editors as their model for this mode of publication.Robert Hampson, 'Exploring Different Forms and Formats' in Wolfgang Gortschacher's Contemporary Views on Little Magazines, Poetry Salzburg, 2000. With the third issue, the magazine adopted the standard little-magazine format of the time: A4 pages, card cover, stapled. Alembic 3, 4 and 5 also marked a more self-conscious engagement with contemporary London- based experimental poetry.jacket2.org/interviews/transatlantic-axis-alembic Alembic 3 (Spring 1975) announced the intention to engage with 'one area of contemporary creative practice' in each issue in order to represent the range of poetry being written in the UK.Alembic 3 This issue focused on contemporary work that had its roots in surrealism. It included Lee Harwood's essay 'Surrealist Poetry Today', which had been a talk given at the Poetry Society, and it included work by Harwood, Paul Matthews, Jeff Nuttall, Heathcote Williams and others. Alembic 4 was edited solely by Hampson and was dedicated to open field poetry and the idea of place. Allen Fisher was the featured poet: in addition to work by him, there was also an interview with him conducted by Barry and Edwards. This issue also included work by Roy Fisher, Eric Mottram, and a small number of American poets, including Alan Davies, who was to be associated with LANGUAGE poetry.jacket2.org/interviews/transatlantic-axis-alembic Alembic 5 (Autumn 1976)was edited solely by Edwards and focused on experimental prose, including work by Paul Buck, Opal Nations, Jeff Nuttall, Maxim Jakubowski, David Miller, the Canadian writer Greg Hollingshead and James Sherry, who was also associated with LANGUAGE poetry. This issue was also the first to be offset. (Like Alembic 4. it had a wrap around cover rather than card.) Alembic 6 (Summer 1977)was again solely edited by Hampson. It included further work by contributors to earlier issues. The featured poet was the Australian poet David Miller: as well as poems and essays by Miller, there was also poetry by Robert Lax and a reprint of work by Charles Madge, on both of whom Miller had written. In addition, there was also work by Rosmarie Waldrop, Tom Leonard, Elaine Randell and Barry MacSweeney.Alembic 6 Alembic 7 (Spring 1978), edited by Edwards and Hampson out of Lower Green Farm, was the 'Assemblage Issue', assembled by inviting a range of poets and visual artists to provide the contents. It included work by Jeremy Adler, Paul Buck, Herbert Burke, Paula Claire, cris cheek, Bob Cobbing, Glenda George, Robert Sheppard, E. E. Vonna- Michel, Lawrence Upton and others. A particular feature of this issue was that every cover was different: they were hand-printed by Vonna-Michel with a rubber-stamp used for the title.Alembic\\" 8 Alembic 9 (to be edited by Hampson) was promised, but never appeared: Edwards had begun to publish Reality Studios as a slimmer, faster and more frequent publication. This eventually metamorphosed (through an amalgamation with Wendy Mulford's Street Editions) into Reality Street, which has been a major publisher of experimental poetry and prose since the 1980s. An interview with Hampson and Edwards by Sophie Seita, originally published in mimeo, is included in Jacket2 as 'the transatlantic axis of alembic'.

It is commonly referred to as Fort Cambridge (), although it was never classified as a fort while in use. It originally contained an Armstrong 100-ton gun. History 100 Ton Armstrong Gun like the one formerly located at Cambridge Battery Cambridge Battery was built by the British between 1878 and 1886 above the shore west of the mouth of Grand Harbour, between Sliema Point Battery and Fort Tign√©. Construction started on 28 August 1878, and the gate was built in 1880. The battery was completed on 27 November 1886, and construction had cost some ¬£18,819. The main entrance with the bridge The battery was built to contain a single Armstrong 100-ton gun: a 450 mm rifled muzzle-loading (RML) gun made by Elswick Ordnance Company, the armaments division of the British manufacturing company Armstrong Whitworth. The battery was paired with Rinella Battery near Kalkara, east of Grand Harbour. The British installed a second pair of 100-ton guns to defend Gibraltar, mounting one each in Victoria Battery (1879) and Napier of Magdala Battery (1883), which did not have Cambridge or Rinella's self-defence capabilities. The gun at Cambridge was eventually scrapped, and today only two 100-ton guns survive, at Rinella and Napier of Magdala. The British felt the need for such large guns as a response to the Italians having, in 1873, built the ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 22 inches of steel armour and four 100-ton Armstrong guns per vessel. By arming both Gibraltar and Malta, the British were seeking to ensure the vital route to India through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, which had opened to traffic in 1869. The battery itself is modest in size as it was designed to operate and protect the single large gun, with its associated gun crew, magazines, bunkers, support machinery and the detachment of troops stationed within the fort to defend the installation. The battery could also be supported from gun fire from the nearby Fort Manoel and Fort Tign√©. The gun was mounted en barbette on a wrought-iron sliding carriage and gun fired over the top of the parapet of the emplacement. This enabled the gun-crew to handle and fire the gun without exposing themselves to enemy fire. The battery was designed to engage enemy warships at ranges up to 7,000 yards. The low profile of the battery and the deeply buried machinery rooms and magazines were intended to enable it to survive counterfire from capital warships. The dilapidated ditch of the battery The battery has no secondary armament; its fortifications - simply ditches, caponiers, a counter-scarp gallery and firing points - were intended mostly for small arms fire and grenades. Originally the inner faces of the emplacement were revetted with masonry. Subsequent review of the battery's defences after its completion identified this as a weakness, and the stone revetting was removed from most of the emplacement and replaced with plain earthworks, presumably to better absorb the energy of incoming shellfire. The revetting was retained around the loading casemates. Cambridge's 100-ton gun arrived on 16 September 1882, and was mounted and ready for use on 20 February 1884. The work to make the machines serviceable was so great that until 1885 there were no firing tests. The first ammunition load comprised all the models available, included 50 AP and 50 HE. Shrapnel, once fired, was not replaced, being considered less effective. Between 1887 and 1888 activity stopped due to the need to rework hydraulic systems, but nevertheless these guns were considered quite reliable. Because a single shell cost as much as the daily wage of 2600 soldiers, practice firing was limited to one shot every 3 months. In 1889, Garden Battery was built close by to cover the area between Cambridge Battery and Fort Tign√©. The 100-ton gun was in active service for 20 years, and was last fired in 1903 or 1904, before being withdrawn from active service by 1906, without ever firing a shot in anger. The gun remained at Cambridge Battery for many years. In 1956, it was cut up and sold for scrap, as part of a programme to scrap all unnecessary ordnance in Malta's fortifications (in which hundreds of guns, both ancient and modern, were destroyed). Eventually, the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza Hotel came to occupy part the site of the battery. A restaurant was built, and this was later gutted to make space for outdoor and indoor pools and other hotel facilities. Although these developments damaged the battery, a significant amount of its original structures remained. Present day Fort Cambridge apartments with the battery below In the 2000s, the area around the battery began to be developed by GAP Developments plc, as seafront apartments known as Fort Cambridge were built close to the battery. In 2007, the developers were given 10 years to restore the battery and turn it into a tourist attraction. Despite this, the only restoration work done to date has been the demolition of the hotel structures built on the battery, and the removal of vegetation. GAP Developments plc has stated that it is committed to the restoration of the battery, despite the slow pace of the works.

The Tolleys quit the running of the business in July 2015, in order to concentrate on their Taylor St Baristas chain. In April 2015, Ethical Consumer ranked Harris + Hoole the lowest in an assessment of the social and environmental impacts of coffee shops. According to Ethical Consumer the company did not provide information on any ethical, environmental or supply chain policies, and used a direct trade model of sourcing from farmers which did not give the same kind of price support as Fairtrade. In response Harris + Hoole stated that their direct trade supplier sourced high quality coffee and aimed to create sustainable livelihoods for small scale farmers.

On May 19, 1937, he took part in first of the two most emotional moments of his political career: Don Javier swearing at the Guernica oak to conform to and protect the traditional Basque fueros.Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 852; the oath was taken by capelan of the Requet√©s and the pason of Ezquiroz, Ferm√≠n Erice, Martorell P√©rez 2014, p. 229, see also video homage at 02:52 The pledge soon suffered a major setback when, following the conquest of Biscay, Franco scrapped the provincial concierto economico in June 1937.Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 853; other sources claim it was in July 37, see Teixedor 1990, p. 88 Standoff between the military and Carlism continued as Don Javier re-entered Spain in November; Arr√∫e was appointed his personal secretary,Martorell P√©rez 2014, p. 229 touring the frontlines and making 4,000 km across Vascongadas, Castile, Extremadura and Andalusia.Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 853 In December 1937 the adventure came to an abrupt end when in Granada Arr√∫e was reached by the military detention order; only thanks to intervention of collaborationist Carlists he was allowed to make it to the Burgos prison himself instead of having been escorted in handcuffs by Guardia Civil.Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 853-4; Don Javier was expulsed from Spain soon afterwards, Manuel Martorell P√©rez, La continuidad ideol√≥gica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 154 It is not clear how much time he spent behind bars; released, he returned to Asteasu to lead Carlist opposition to falangisation of the province.Gobernacion civil was already fully controlled by FET, though Carlism remained in control of Diputaci√≥n Provincial, see Teixedor 1990, p. 88; key front-office Carlists in Gipuzkoa were at that time Julio Mu√±oz Aguilar (jefe of provincial FET), Fidel Azurza (president of Diputaci√≥n, jefe provincial de FET), Juan Jos√© Pradera (director of La Voz de Espana). El√≠as Querejeta (jefe of provincial FET), Lus Ruiz de Prada (president of Diputaci√≥n) and Fernando Aramburu (president of Diputaci√≥n), Teixedor 1990; another author describes them as ‚Äúpoco representativos‚Äù, see Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada Tiffe, La reorganizaci√≥n del carlismo vasco en los sesenta: entre la pasividad y el \\"separatismo\\", [in:] Vasconia.

In 1940 he was appointed the representative of Gipuzkoa in a 4-member interregional vasco-navarrese junta;Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 855, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 194 the same year the Carlist political leader Manuel Fal Conde suggested he joins executive board of Editorial Navarra, the Carlist publishing house disguised as a commercial enterprise.Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 855 In August 1942 as head of the Gipuzkoan junta he signed a manifesto prior to planned official celebrations commemorating the siege of Tolosa;also Fernando Aramburu as president of Diputaci√≥n protested against the Francoist treatment of Gipuzkoa; he was forced out of office in October 1942, Teixedor 1990, p. 91 the document urged loyalty to Don Javier and Fal, claiming that the future of Spain lies only with Carlism.Arr√∫e urged to ‚Äúdefender con todo su entusiasmo la bandera de la legitimidad, hoy en alto mantenida por nuestro Regente Don Francisco Javier de Borb√≥n-Parma y su Delegado y √∫nico jefe de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista Sr.D.

He was with those judging that the regency aroused little enthusiasm amongst the rank-and-file and merely encouraged damaging dynastical competition; hence, he preferred that Don Javier announces his personal claim to the throne, which indeed took place in 1952.Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 857 Arr√∫e maintained very good relations with the Carlist political leader; he shared Fal's intransigence on dynastical and anti- Francoist issues, while Fal shared and supported Arr√∫e's drive to promote the Basque identity.Martorell P√©rez 2011, pp. 858-9, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 344 Though in 1953 the Gipuzkoan junta was reconstituted under Ignacio Ruz de Prada and with Pablo Iturria as its secretary, it was in fact Arr√∫e remaining the provincial leader.Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 858, Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 343-4; the Gipuzkoan junta was not assembled for long periods, all powers resting with Arr√∫e, V√°zquez de Prada 2012, p. 1124 One scholar suggests that Arr√∫e conspired against Fal, considering him too conventional in his anti- Francoist bid;Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 392; the same author in his other work claims that Arr√∫e has been loyal to Fal, see Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 850 if this is the case indeed, the ensuing deposition of Fal and collaborationist turn of mid-1950s caught Arr√∫e bitterly disappointed; he was leaning to a Sivattista dissidence.he was present during the talks between Don Javier and the Sivattistas in Perpignan; the meeting ended with Don Javier signing a document pledging faith to Traditionalist principles and ruling out a dynastical agreement with the Alfonsists. The paper was supposed to be private, but Sivatte made it public. A number of signatories were later expulsed from the Comunion; Arrue was spared due to his recent appointment to the provincial jefatura, Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada, El final de una ilusi√≥n.

His opponents considered Arr√∫e a power-hungry Carlist version of Aguirre, keen to build his Vascongadas fiefdom,V√°zquez de Prada 2012, pp. 1132-5 and as there were no suitable counter-candidates, the idea of Junta Foral was eventually abandoned.V√°zquez de Prada 2012, p. 1136 In 1962 Jos√© Aramburu was formally appointed jefe provincial.V√°zquez de Prada 2012, p. 1125 Sidetracking of Arr√∫e was acknowledged by the regime, always keen to exploit differences within various political groupings, by awarding him Orden del M√©rito Civil in 1964.Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 849, San Martin 1976, p. 16 In mid-1960s Arr√∫e, from 1957 supporting Carlist prince Carlos Hugo,In 1957 Arr√∫e supported the idea of Carlos Hugo making a surprise entry at Montejurra, see Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 415, Martorell P√©rez 2014, p 84; he was also in the first line during the ceremony itself, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 416, Martorell P√©rez 2014, p 85. It is not clear why Arr√∫e supported the prince; maybe he considered Carlos Hugo and the Huguistas a counter-weight to Valiente, maybe he hoped that a young prince would provide more dynamics while Don Javier was already aging, maybe he viewed prince‚Äôs entry as a means of strengthening the dynasty against the Juanistas, especially that Arr√∫e has already pressed Don Javier on descendancy issues, V√°zquez de Prada 2009, p. 198 neared the group of his young entourage.

XVIII Basque: theorist and practitioner Egan, 1967 Arr√∫e, an amateur with no professional background either in linguistics or ethnography, was in the second row of those scientifically contributing to the Basque culture. His works ‚Äì articles published in Basque- and Spanish-language periodicals, mostly in Egan ‚Äì are loosely scattered across many disciplines: history of Basque literature,e.g. Juan Bautista Agirre (1954) history of Basque linguistics,e.g. Itzaurre-bidez (1956) grammar of Basque language,e.g. Gerriko (1956) Basque dialectology,e.g. Euskareran batasuna (1956) history of Basque social movement,e.g. Palankariak (1958) Basque anthropology,e.g. Euskal umoreaz (1961) theory of contemporary Basque poetry,e.g. Cuatro poetas vascos actuales (1963) Basque history,e.g. San Sebasti√°n y la Real Compa√±a Guipuzcoana de Caracas (1963) Basque cuisinee.g. Gastronom√≠a vasca (1967) and foreign literature;e.g. Turoczi (1958) it was only the question of Basque political ambitions that he avoided ‚Äì at least in the Francoist Spain ‚Äì and usually approached only as part of the Carlist history.E.g. Zumalakarregi (1960) Arr√∫e's role in theoretical development of the Basque language and culture is perhaps dwarfed by his practical contribution. Since the 1930s he has been hailed by media, colleagues and Vasc√≥filos as a great speechmaker,invited and wanted also abroad, see Zavala 2008, p. XVIII who has not only transplanted spoken Basque from barns to congress halls, but also brought it to unprecedented rhetorical mastery. Considered one of the best Basque orators of his time,Bernardo Estorn√©s Lasa, Antonio Arr√∫e Zarauz he was acknowledged not for highly emotional inflammatory style, but rather for smoothness, sense of humor, vivacity and fluidity.Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 861, Zavala 2008, p. XVIII His practical contribution to written Basque, apart from scientific articles, covers also short poems, usually humorous light pieces like a praise of the Jerez sherry, occasionally winning prizes during local contests.La Vanguardia 24.08.72, available here Euskaltzaindia site Basque: reception and legacy Arr√∫e remained a rather forgotten figure until a compilation of his works was released in 2008 and triggered some follow up both in media and in historiography.Martorell P√©rez 2011, p. 849; Arr√∫e‚Äôs friends and colleagues from Euskaltzaindia arranged for his works to be issued as a book in 2008; for a sample of press acknowledgements see Diario Vasco 03.05.09, available here; brief historiographical debate ensued in Euskera of 2011 and 2012 According to the recently published works his contribution to the Basque cause is highly controversial. It remains beyond any doubt that he opposed independent Basque political ambitions, defended integrity of Spain and has always considered the Basques part of the Spanish political nation; different views pertain to his intentions and to his impact on Basque culture and Basque national development. In some studies Arr√∫e is presented as ‚Äúone of us‚Äù, a Basque who trapped in political maze of his time did his best to promote Basque culture against the hostile background of Francoist regime. He is credited mostly for his support as organizer, lawyer and politician, a person who delivered an umbrella sheltering Basque institutions and enabling cultural development, shaped and directed by the others.see apologetic article by Manuel Martorell P√©rez 2011 or the homage paid by Antonio Zavala 2008; Luis Villasante 1979 calls him friend and colleague and wishes ‚Äúmay he help for us from heaven‚Äù Euskalerria 2014 In some studies Arr√∫e is presented as ‚Äúa vasc√≥filo within the regime‚Äù, a person who tried to accommodate Basque cultural ambitions within the Francoist system. In this perspective, Arr√∫e appears to be either someone whose contribution was merely a byproduct of his Carlist political leaning, someone who unintentionally promoted the cause, or someone who was used by the Basques to pursue their cultural and national goals.see biographical note edited by Joxemiel Bidador 2000 or Arrue Zarautz, Antonio entry at Lur hiztegi entziklopedikoa available here In some studies Arr√∫e is presented as a badly reputed \\"Asteasu beltza\\".very loosely translatable as ‚ÄúDarth Vader from Asteasu‚Äù; this approach is presented by Pako Sudupe, Antonio Arrue: Euskaltzaindiaren eta Francoren erregimenaren laguntzaile, [in:] Euskera 57 (2012), pp. 823-838, based on own research and evidence provided by Nemesio Agapito Ech√°niz Arambarri and Andima Ibi√±agabeitia Idoyaga Adherent to a backward ideology, he censored the Basque literature,enforcing also self- censorship upon the authors, Sudupe 2012, p. 829 forced pro-Francoist distortions,in re-issued edition of Peru Abarca the original prologue is replaced by the one written by Arrue, Sudupe 2012, p. 829 promoted clericalism,Sudupe 2012, p. 831; the same author claims that Arr√∫e, in the best Soviet style, manipulated the clergy, see p. 836 sponsored Spanish lexical intrusions into Basque,Sudupe 2012, p. 831 obstructed disliked people and publicationsSudupe 2012, p. 835 and manipulated bertsolari contests in terms of their winnersSudupe 2012, pp. 834-5 and in terms of their public reception.Sudupe 2012, p. 834 quotes Nemesio Ech√°niz speaking allegedly on Arr√∫e: ‚ÄúEn todas las fiestas populares eusk√©ricas, un se√±or que ya desde anta√±o ten√≠a dadas buenas muestras de su fobia hacia todos los que no se allanaran a sus estrechas ideas pol√≠ticas, se arroga el derecho de soltar una soflama eusk√©rica con latiguillos f√°ciles de un pretendido entusiasmo vasquista‚Äù.

Construction began on his station in 1983 when Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n was President of Argentina but works were interrupted and finally cancelled until they were resumed in 2014 and the station was finished and opened to public on December 19. Station's facilities and services include railway platforms, bus garages, accessible toilets and a coffeehouse. Therefore, Chascom√∫s original station (inaugurated in 1865) fell into disuse and was closed. History Station hall. Location of the new station, at the west from the old one. Chascom√∫s was one of the main stations of the Constituci√≥n - Mar del Plata railway service. The BAGSR (then \\"Ferrocarril del Sud\\") operated the line until the Railway nationalization of 1948 when the Argentine state purchased all the British and French-owned railway companies. Since then, Ferrocarriles Argentinos ran all the services to Mar del Plata until 1993 when the Province of Buenos Aires took over the services through its company Ferrobaires and has been running services to date. Nevertheless, the original route to Mar del Plata used tracks that crossed downtown Chascom√∫s, with more than 17 level crossings existing. That also meant trains had to run at very low speed when crossing Chascom√∫s in order to prevent accidents, generating significant delays in the time of journey. To put an end to this, a new building that operated as both railroad and bus terminus, was projected during the Presidency of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n. The original project included construction of a new route for the tracks, moving them to a suburban area of the city to prevent accidents. The successive economic crisis in Argentina halted construction, until the station was indefinitely abandoned without being finished. Almost 20 years later, the project was put into discussion again by the Argentine state, with only two level crossings projected. Finally, four level crossings were allowed to be opened. Works to move tracks were committed to Spanish company COMSA EMTE in 2013. The company built a new line of 20 km length to avoid the big amount of level crossings of the old route. When the new railway/bus terminus was inaugurated on December 19, 2014, the old station was closed. In December 2014, brand new trains acquired by the Government of Argentina from the Chinese company CSR, started to run luxury services from Constituci√≥n to Mar del Plata, operated by the national state-owned company SOFSE. Standard service continued to be operated by now defunct company Ferrobaires. Nevertheless, in 2015 long-distance services from Constituci√≥n to Mar del Plata were suspended due to the bad conditions to run trains.

A separate Armenian Orthodox seat was instituted in 1934 and separate Protestant and Armenian Catholic seats were created in 1951.

Although it is owned and supported by the German Association of the Holy Land, it is currently in the care of the international convent of the Sisters of the Congregation of Jesus. Lessons are taught in German and the spoken language outside of class is English. The teaching staff is composed of both Arab and German teachers.  History  In 1886 a school for Arab girls was established in the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, then part of the Ottoman Empire, in the newly built Old Hospice near the Jaffa Gate next to a pilgrims‚Äô hospice and a medical station. The school and the medical station were under the care of a convent of the Catholic sisters of St. Carl Borromaeus. In 1890, the German Lazarist Father Friedrich Wilhelm Schmidt took on the administrative role of the school. The pupils‚Äô numbers grew from 36 in 1890 to approximately 120 in 1914 and to 138 in 1915. The syllabus followed the learning plans of German state schools. During Kaiser Wilhelm II's journey through Palestine, he also paid a visit to the Schmidt's Girls College. At a meeting with him, Wilhelm Schmidt suggested building a new bigger and more suitable accommodation for pilgrims. The Kaiser had already supported the construction of the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in Jerusalem and the establishing of the Abbey of the Dormition on Mount Zion. With his support, the German Association of the Holy Land acquired two parcels directly opposite the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem where they built the Paulus-Haus. After Schmidt died in 1907, the administrative role was passed on to Father Ernst Schmitz who continued building the library and expanded the natural sciences collections. The pilgrims‚Äô hospice moved into the new building in 1908 where a teachers‚Äô seminar was also established. As a result, more teaching space became available in the old hospice. At the start of the First World War the school was initially closed, like all other international institutions, but it resumed activity at the start of 1915 due to the good relations between Germany and the Ottoman Empire. The only requirement was to include Turkish as a teaching language. After the capture of Jerusalem by the British forces in 1918 the college closed down for three years. When it reopened, under the British Mandate of Palestine, English replaced German as the main teaching language. However, German was later used again. By adopting Palestinian learning plans, the pupils could receive Palestinian certificates of secondary education alongside their German ones, as well as take a teaching exam. Initially, the college taught 27 pupils split between two classes and a kindergarten group. Because of the small number of female pupils, boys were also accepted until 1930. By 1936 the student body had increased to 370. German became an obligatory foreign language from the sixth grade onwards in the 1930s. A German division was composed of two classes of German students taught according to German syllabuses. At the start of the Second World War the German teachers were deported, including the head of the school, Sister Maria Kramm, who was replaced by the Arab Sister Elia. The German teaching staff returned in 1943 and the school remained active until May 1948. The old hospice in Hillel Street, used as a school building, lay in the western Israeli part of Jerusalem after the ceasefire agreement of 1949. However, the students mainly lived in East Jerusalem, then under Jordanian administration. As a result, the school was moved into the Paulus-Haus on 1 October 1950. The headmaster, Father Sonnen, was able to achieve the move quickly through the support of the Israeli authorities, enlisting the help over 60 vans for the transportation purposes. Three years later the school had approximately 400 students. In the 1950s several new buildings were constructed and in 1962 the construction of a new school site began on the land next to the Paulus-Haus. Although it was completed on 14 May 1967, the Six-Day War began only a few days later, during which the new building suffered heavy external damage. Academic overview The twelve-year school period finishes with the Palestinian Tawjihi certificate and the (DIAP, \\"German International Abitur Program\\"). The abitur is recognized by the Palestinian education authorities and enables applying for higher education in Germany, Palestine and worldwide. Almost 100% of Schmidt's College students continue onto university. The Schmidt's Girls College is considered a prestigious institution and graduates are in demand by employers. The college is under the care of the convent of the Sisters of the Congregation of Jesus, amongst other organisations. The college is a Catholic school following the Corpus Iuris Canonici (lit. \\"Body of Canon Law\\") and highlights the requirements of the Gravissimum educationis. It still follows German traditions and has a close connection to the German educational environment. At the same time it is a school in a predominantly Muslim region. This is reflected in the student body composition of 80% Muslim and 20% Christian students, which is the opposite of the teaching staff composition.

Italian naval strategists quickly discarded the concept and returned to more traditional strategies centered on a fleet of battleships. As a result, later cruisers returned to medium-caliber batteries. The first several designs were intended to fill a variety of roles, including fleet scouts and colonial cruisers, but beginning with , which was solely intended for colonial duties, the Regia Marina began to build more specialized vessels. , , and were designed as fast scouts for the main fleet, and the last design, the , were slower vessels for use in the colonies. One vessel, , was an exception to Italian design preferences. The ship had been ordered by the Ottoman Navy, but the Ottomans failed to pay for the ship, so she remained incomplete until the Italo-Turkish War in 1911, when she was seized by Italy and completed for the Regia Marina. Italian protected cruisers served in many roles across the globe. Many were deployed to Italy's colonies in Africa, or to foreign stations in the Americas and Asia to show the flag. They were also assigned to the main fleet in the Mediterranean, where they served as scouts. As the vessels aged, many were converted for secondary duties, becoming training ships, depot ships, and headquarters ships. Many of the early vessels saw action during the Italo-Turkish War, bombarding Ottoman positions in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and blockading ports in the Red Sea. During World War I, most of the vessels saw little action, owing to the cautious strategy adopted by both Italy and Austria-Hungary, but Quarto battled an Austro-Hungarian cruiser in 1915 and Marsala took part in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in May 1917. After the war, most of the remaining vessels were scrapped or reduced to secondary roles, having been supplanted by ex- German and Austro-Hungarian vessels taken as war prizes and newer light cruisers built in the 1920s. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armament  The number and type of the primary armament - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armor  The thickness of the deck armor - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Displacement  Ship displacement at full combat load - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Propulsion  Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed/horsepower generated - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Service  The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Laid down  The date the keel began to be assembled - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Commissioned  The date the ship was commissioned } Giovanni Bausan Giovanni Bausan, probably in the United States in 1893 Giovanni Bausan was the first protected cruiser built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy). The ship was designed by George Rendel at the Armstrong Whitworth shipyard in Britain; the design was based on the Chilean .Marshall, p. 268 Equipped with a pair of guns, Giovanni Bausan was intended as a \\"battleship destroyer\\", since these weapons would be able to defeat the heavy armor of the much larger‚Äîand much more expensive‚Äîbattleships in foreign navies. She nevertheless proved to be unsatisfactory for this role, since the guns fired too slowly and she was too unstable to be a good gunnery platform. Construction of the ship‚Äîalong with the subsequent Etna class, for which Giovanni Bausan provided the basis‚Äîrepresented the Regia Marinas brief experimentation with the Jeune √âcole doctrine.Sondhaus (2001), p. 148 Giovanni Bausan frequently served abroad. She participated in the conquest of Eritrea in 1887‚Äì1888 as the flagship of the Italian squadron during the campaign. She took part in the Venezuelan crisis of 1902‚Äì1903 alongside several other Italian, British, and German warships.Robinson, pp. 420‚Äì421 The ship was withdrawn from front-line service by 1905 and was employed as a training ship. During the Italo-Turkish War of 1911‚Äì1912, she provided gunfire support to Italian troops ashore in North Africa. By the outbreak of World War I, Giovanni Bausan had been relegated to secondary duties, first as a distilling ship, and later as a depot ship for seaplanes. The ship was disarmed during the conflict and ultimately was sold to ship-breakers in March 1920. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Giovanni Bausan class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó gunsBrook (2003), p. 96    2 shafts, 2 compound- expansion steam engines, ,  21 August 1882  9 May 1885Brook (2003), p. 97  Sold for scrap, 1920Gardiner, p. 348 } Etna class Etna, probably during her visit to the United States with Giovanni Bausan The Etna class was an improved version of the preceding Giovanni Bausan, being slightly larger but carrying the same armament and armor protection. License-built variants of the earlier ship, they were partially designed by George Rendel, who had also designed Giovanni Bausan. As such, they suffered from the same limitations as the earlier vessel that were imposed by their slow-firing 10-inch guns and poor stability.Brook (2003), pp. 97, 99 The four cruisers nevertheless had long service lives, which included periods with the main Italian fleet as well as on foreign stations. Etna served on the North American Station from 1893 to 1895, and in 1899, Ettore Fieramosca, Vesuvio, and Stromboli participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China. Etna was rebuilt into a training ship in 1905‚Äì1907, and in 1909 she took part in the Hudson‚ÄìFulton Celebration.Kunz, pp. 317‚Äì318 Ettore Fieramosca was the first member of the class to be decommissioned, and she was sold for scrap in 1909. Stromboli followed in 1911 and Vesuvio was discarded in 1915. Etna remained in service longer than her sisters; she saw action during the Italo-Turkish War,Beehler, pp. 47, 50, 65, 91, 94 and during World War I, she served as the headquarters ship in Taranto.Halpern (2004), p. 70 She was ultimately discarded in 1921. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Etna class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"4\\"  2 √ó 10 in guns  rowspan=\\"4\\"  1.5 in  rowspan=\\"4\\"   rowspan=\\"4\\"  2 shafts, 2 horizontal compound-expansion steam engines, ,  19 January 1884  2 December 1887  Sold for scrap, 1921 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   31 August 1884  20 March 1888  Sold for scrap, 1911 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   10 July 1884  16 March 1888  Sold for scrap, 1915 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   31 December 1885Brook (2003), p. 99  16 November 1889  Sold for scrap, July 1909 } Dogali Dogali in the 1890s Dogali was originally designed by William Henry White of Armstrong Whitworth for the Greek Navy. She was initially named Salamis, but the Greek Navy put the ship up for sale while she was still under construction. Italy purchased the vessel and renamed her Angelo Emo and then Dogali before she entered service. Her career was uneventful, with her early years spent with the main fleet conducting training exercises. In 1893 she represented Italy at the World's Columbian Exposition,Neal, pp. 99‚Äì100 and was present in Brazil during the Revolta da Armada (Revolt of the Fleet), where she protected Italian interests from the unrest.Marley, p. 592 In 1908, Italy sold Dogali to Uruguay, and she was renamed 25 de Agosto. In 1911, she became Montevideo, and she was decommissioned in 1914.

Originally intended to carry a pair of guns and four guns, the Italian Navy instead requested a uniform battery of six 6-inch guns.Brook (1999), pp. 14, 68; Brook (2003), p. 103 She proved to be a revolutionary vessel, as she was the first major warship to be armed entirely with quick-firing, medium-caliber guns; these became the standard for all cruisers from the 1890s onward.Sondhaus (2001), pp. 156‚Äì157 The ship had an eventful career. She was briefly assigned to the main fleet, but by the early 1890s, she was serving abroad in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.Brook 2003, p. 108 In 1896 she was sent to Brazil to protect Italian nationals in the country after unrest in the country targeted Europeans.Huntington, p. 83 By 1901, Piemonte was assigned to the East Asia Station.Reeve, p. 67 By the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, the ship was again stationed in the Red Sea. She led a pair of destroyers in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay, where she sank or destroyed seven Ottoman gunboats, destroying Ottoman naval strength in the area.Beehler, p. 51 For the rest of the war, she blockaded and bombarded Ottoman ports.Beehler, pp. 51, 70, 90 During World War I, she was assigned to the Second Fleet, based in Brindisi, but she did not see action.Sondhaus (1994), pp. 273‚Äì274 Piemonte was sold for scrap in 1920. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Piemonte class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   6 √ó guns    2 shafts, 2 vertical triple-expansion steam engines, ,  1887  8 August 1889  Scrapped, 1920 } Regioni class Etruria in the United States in 1909 The six Regioni-class cruisers‚Äîso named as all vessels save Elba were named for regions of Italy‚Äîwere the first protected cruisers designed by Italian naval architects. They were built by four different shipyards, and so varied slightly in size, speed, and armament. They proved to be a disappointment in service, owing to their slow speed and weak armor protection.Gardiner, pp. 348‚Äì349 They served in a variety of capacities throughout their careers, including scouts for the main fleet, colonial cruisers, and representatives of Italy at major foreign events. While on the China Station, Elba observed the Russo-Japanese War, including the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in 1904, where she picked up Russian survivors.May, pp. 142‚Äì146 Lombardia was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 1906. Elba and Liguria were equipped with observation balloons in 1907‚Äì1908.Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 61 In 1910, Umbria was sold to Haiti and renamed Consul Gostr√ºck, though she quickly sank under the care of her inexperienced crew.Gardiner & Gray, p. 416 The remaining ships, except for Lombardia, took part in the Italo-Turkish War.Beehler, pp. 9‚Äì10, 27‚Äì29, 81, 84 They were relegated to secondary roles during World War I, except for Puglia, which battled the Austro-Hungarian cruiser and later covered the evacuation of the Serbian Army from Durazzo.Halpern (1995), p. 158Klein, p. 389 Etruria was deliberately blown up by Italy as a deception operation against Austria-Hungary.O'Hara, Dickson, & Worth, p. 187 The remaining ships were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s, though the bow section of Puglia is preserved at the Vittoriale degli italiani, a museum in Lombardy.Domenico, p. 54 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Regioni class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"6\\"  4 √ó 6 in guns 6 √ó guns  rowspan=\\"5\\"  2 in  rowspan=\\"6\\"   rowspan=\\"6\\"  2 shafts, 2 vertical triple-expansion steam engines, ,  1 August 1888  16 February 1894  Sold to Haiti, 1910 Foundered, 1911Gardiner, pp. 349, 416 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   19 November 1889  16 February 1893  Sold for scrap, 4 July 1920 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1 April 1889  11 July 1894  Sunk, 13 August 1918 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1 July 1889  1 December 1894  Sold for scrap, 15 May 1921 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   22 September 1890  27 February 1896  Sold for scrap, 5 January 1920 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  1 in  October 1893  26 May 1901  Sold for scrap, 22 March 1923, partially preserved as a memorial } Calabria Calabria, probably during her visit to Australia in 1905 Calabria was designed for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc to protect it from fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery. The ship's career spanned the globe, and ranged from a deployment to China to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion in 1899‚Äì1901,Journal of the RUSI, p. 624 to tours in the Americas throughout the 1900s,Annual Report of the Navy Department, p. 4 and a trip to Australia in 1905.Cresciani, p. 52 During the Italo-Turkish War, she was transferred to the Red Sea, where she bombarded Ottoman troops and ports and helped to enforce a blockade before returning to Italy in April 1912 for a refit.Beehler, pp. 48, 51, 70 The ship continued to serve in the Red Sea during World War I and as a result, did not see action.Koburger, p. 14 She was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and then a training ship in early 1924,Gardiner & Gray, p. 257 before being sold for scrap in November 1924. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Calabria class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   4 √ó 6 in guns 4 √ó 4.7 in gunsGardiner, p. 350  2 in   2 shafts, 2 vertical triple- expansion steam engines, ,  February 1892  12 July 1897  Sold for scrap, 13 November 1924 } Libia Libia at anchor Libia marked a major advancement over earlier designs, owing in large part due to the fact that the ship was originally ordered by the Ottoman Navy. Based on the British-built , the ship was to have been named Drama, but the Ottoman government failed to make payments so construction stopped, and she was seized after the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War and completed for the Regia Marina. She was significantly larger, faster, and more heavily armored than the other Italian protected cruisers, but she carried a weaker main battery.Gardiner, pp. 348‚Äì350 As a scout for the main fleet, Libia spent much of World War I in port, acting as a fleet in being to deter the Austro-Hungarian Navy from attempting any major operations.Halpern (1995), pp. 141‚Äì142 In 1921 the ship went on a world tour under the command of Admiral Ernesto Burzagli. During the cruise, she stopped in San Francisco, United States in November, where she stayed for a month. While there, she was filmed for a short documentary by the then-unknown film director Frank Capra on 6 and 7 November‚Äîthough it did not generate much attention, it was Capra's first publicly screened film.McBride, p. 133 She was deployed to China in 1925, where she was stationed until the early 1930s.Marinelli & Andornino, p. 54 After returning to Italy and being laid up in 1935,Willmott, p. 60 Libia was eventually sold for scrap in March 1937. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Libia class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó 6 in guns 8 √ó 4.7 in gunsGardiner & Gray, p. 262  4 in (100 mm)   2 shafts, 2 vertical triple-expansion steam engines, ,  1907  25 March 1913  Sold for scrap, 1937 } Quarto Illustration of Quarto Quarto represented another major shift in Italian cruiser designs; unlike earlier designs that attempted to fill multiple roles, Quarto was optimized for use as a fleet scout. She also incorporated advances like steam turbines and mixed oil and coal-fired boilers, which produced a much higher top speed. Intended to engage only hostile scouts, her armament was significantly weaker than earlier cruisers, mounting a battery of only 4.7-inch guns. She was also fitted with equipment to handle 200 naval mines to allow her to serve as a fast minelayer. Unlike many of her fellow cruisers, Quarto was quite active during World War I, as she was stationed at Brindisi to support the Otranto barrage.O'Hara, Dickson, & Worth, pp. 183‚Äì184 While on patrols throughout the war, she encountered Austro-Hungarian and German U-boats, though they frequently misjudged her speed, causing them to miss with their torpedoes. She engaged in a long gunnery duel with the Austro-Hungarian cruiser in December 1915, but neither vessel was seriously damaged.Halpern (1995), pp. 156‚Äì157 Quarto supported Italian forces during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935‚Äì1936,Marinelli & Andornino, pp. 54‚Äì55 before serving as the flagship of Italian forces participating in the non-intervention patrols in 1936 and 1937 during the Spanish Civil War.Greene & Massignani, p. 18 Stricken from the naval register in January 1939, she was thereafter allocated for weapons testing. The commando unit Decima Flottiglia MAS tested new SLC human torpedoes and MT explosive motorboats on Quarto in 1940, the latter causing extensive damage and sinking the ship in November.Greene & Massignani, p. 38 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Quarto class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   6 √ó 4.7 in gunsGardiner & Gray, p. 263  1.5 in   4 shafts, 4 steam turbines, ,  14 November 1909  31 March 1913  Sunk in weapons tests, November 1940Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 315 } Nino Bixio class Illustration of Marsala The Regia Marina decided to follow Quarto with two more similar ships, which became the Nino Bixio class. These two ships carried an identical armament and the same scale of armor protection. They were significantly heavier and had one fewer turbine, though, and this resulted in poor performance. Nino Bixio and Marsala proved to be a disappointment in service, owing to their unreliable engines and their failure to meet their design speed of . During World War I, the two ships were based at Brindisi with Quarto, where they patrolled the southern end of the Adriatic Sea, though Nino Bixio did not see action in the conflict. Marsala was the only Italian cruiser at Brindisi to have steam in her boilers when an Austro-Hungarian cruiser flotilla attacked the Otranto barrage in May 1917;Halpern (2004), p. 50 she briefly engaged the hostile vessels in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto before the Austro-Hungarians withdrew.Halpern (1995), p. 165 Both ships were discarded in the late 1920s. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Nino Bixio class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  6 √ó 4.7 in guns  rowspan=\\"2\\"  1.5 in  rowspan=\\"2\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  3 shafts, 3 steam turbines, ,  15 February 1911  5 May 1914  Sold for scrap, 1929 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   15 February 1911  4 August 1914  Sold for scrap, 1927 } Campania class The last pair of protected cruisers built by the Italian Navy were intended for colonial service, and were based on experience from Calabria. They were given a relatively heavy main battery for their small size and a long cruising range, at the expense of armor protection and speed. The ships were so small that they could be built on the same slipway and launched the same day. Since they had been launched less than a week before hostilities broke out at the end of July 1914, fitting-out work was delayed by a steel shortage, particularly after Italy entered the war.Marshall, p. 33 Campania and Basilicata initially served in Libya; neither had eventful careers. The latter vessel was destroyed by a boiler explosion in Tewfik on 13 August 1919. Campania was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and became a training ship in 1932. She ultimately was sold for scrap in 1937. During the war, Italy stopped building cruisers, since destroyers, submarines, and smaller patrol vessels were more useful in operations against the Austro- Hungarians.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 253‚Äì254 After the war, the anemic Italian economy could not support significant naval construction programs.Zabecki, p. 859 Additionally, Italy had received several modern light cruisers from the defeated Germans and Austro-Hungarians, and these ships formed the backbone of the Italian cruiser force. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align: center;\\" + Summary of the Campania class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  6 √ó 6 in guns  rowspan=\\"2\\"  1 in  rowspan=\\"2\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 shafts, 2 vertical triple-expansion steam engines, ,  9 August 1913  18 April 1917  Sold for scrap, 1937 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   9 August 1913  1 August 1917  Sunk by boiler explosion, 13 August 1919 } See also * List of heavy cruisers of Italy * List of torpedo cruisers of Italy Notes References           * Italy Category:Cruisers of Italy Cruisers ","title":"List of protected cruisers of Italy"},{"id":"45187104","text":"Greek European Citizens () was a short-time Greek political party, founded by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis.

Up to 5,000 workers hand cut the clay, many of whom were internal migrants from the Lippe region in North-Rhine Westphalia and later from Silesia. They were housed in brick makers‚Äô garrisons. There were 57 ring kilns and an annual production of 625,000,000 building bricks. Later the clay was cut by chain-and-bucket excavators. Museum The 58 ha park has two working brickworks from the GDR (East Germany) period, ring kilns, railways and engine workshops- a stationary steam engine and the flooded clay pits that provide an interesting environment for wildlife: including beavers and great bitterns.

Plot  Scary Antics, a struggling reality show about pranking people, finds its next \\"chump\\" in the form of Jacob (Norbert Velez), an awkward young man who is convinced that the abandoned chemical plant where his father died is haunted. Jacob was brought to the attention of the show by his friend Adam, who believes that pranking Jacob might scare him enough to make him move past his father's death, and his obsession with the plant. Adam (Reggie Peters), his girlfriend Carla (Daniela Larez), and her friend Melanie (Gema Calero) are to take Jacob to the plant, and explore it with him as Gary (Giordan Diaz) the host of Scary Antics, and three members of the show's crew - David (Todd Bruno), Steven (Tom Stedham), and Brenda (Aniela McGuinness) - watch them through cameras while situated in a sealed office. Jacob finds and puts on an incomplete hazmat suit before an actor named Tim (Mario Nalini), who is wearing a full hazmat suit, jumps out to frighten him. Panicking, Jacob kills him with an old fire axe, and seemingly has a psychotic break due to realizing what he has done, and that he is the butt of an elaborate joke. Jacob dons Ed's mask, murders Adam, Kills Carla and chases Melanie to the office, which he is unable to break into. Melanie and the others are trapped without sustenance, no way to contact help, and with no one knowing where they are due to the host going ahead with filming without informing the network, which required permits and documents that he could not afford. After Jacob kills technician Ed (Dennis Spain) when he stops by, Gary and Steven use their only map to locate the back exit, which Jacob locks after catching and murdering Steven axing his head, then chases Gary. After a brief hide and seek Gary almost exits the building when Jacob pulls him in and decapitates him. Brenda goes out and reclaims the map, but is followed back to the office by Jacob, who forces his way in before the door can be resealed. Jacob axes David while Melanie and Brenda make a run for it, trying to use the map to find another way out. Jacob finds the two, kills Melanie, and fights Brenda. During the struggle, Brenda pulls off Jacob's mask to reveal that his face and head have become disfigured and corpse-like, implying that he is possessed, and that the plant really is haunted. Brenda incapacitates Jacob, and reaches the other exit she and Melanie were looking for, but before she can escape the recovered Jacob pulls her back inside, and hacks her to pieces.

Corey Danna of Horror News gave HazMat a 3¬Ω out of 5, having deemed the climax underwhelming, but the rest of the film commendable, and ultimately concluding, \\"As a whole, HazMat, is the perfect film to watch with a group of friends\\". The same score was awarded by Jorge Larrea of 305 Magazine, who stated, \\"If you're a fan of old school horror movies like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, any of the Alfred Hitchcock films to name a few then you have to agree that horror films nowadays are not in the same league. Horror films lack that... cult feel to them, at least 90% of the ones released. That's where HazMat takes a step back into the cult realm. It has that feel. It's not the most frightening movie there is but you do feel the suspense and want to start screaming at the characters on the screen\\". The characterization, acting, and plot were called awkward by Michael Allen of 28 Days Later Analysis, who also said the conclusion was unsurprising, but nonetheless Allen admitted, \\"Overall, events onscreen are never boring, nor slowly paced. HazMat is an exciting film spent with a few interesting characters and a few grisly sights\\".

It was settled by the John T. Brittain Family in 1832.(A house built by the family ca. 1874 still stands on Brittain Road). Brittain was located at the crossroads of roads from Tallmadge (north), Mogadore (east), North Springfield (south) and Middlebury (west). It is 1,066 feet above sea level. The Little Cuyahoga River ran through Brittain and was joined by Springfield lake Outlet Creek on its outskirts. Brittain was possibly a settlement area for indigenous Americans. Among other early settlers was Benjamin Hilbish, who farmed wheat from 1849, raised a family and built a home in 1869. The village was locally referred to as the ‚Äòwhite grocery' owing to several grocers and clean streets. Sheriff Alanson Lane in 1892 described Brittain: \\"Brittain (formerly for many years known as \\"White Grocery\\"), one mile east of the city limits, on the Mogadore road, has had a hotel or two, store, post office, school house, wagon shop, blacksmith shop, clay-mill, etc., with private residences to correspond.\\" Brittain had a one-room school house, a post office, a Methodist church, hotels, clay mill, blacksmith, and a grist mill. The Roegers family had a carriage manufacturing workshop. A sawmill at Oak Hill was situated on the Little Cuyahoga River. As Akron absorbed Middlebury to the west, and then spread into Brittain, several parts were lost to urban sprawl. After World War II the interstate highway project constructed a highway over most of what was left of Brittain. Brittain Road in Akron is named after the village. Most of what was once the Village of Brittain is at the current intersections of East Market and Mogadore Road in Akron, in the Ellet school cluster.

It is the clinical journal of the European Society of Endocrinology. The editor-in-chief is Wiebke Arlt (University of Birmingham). According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2019 impact factor of 5.308. The journal has been published by Bioscientifica since 1999.  History  The European Journal of Endocrinology was established in 1948 as Acta Endocrinologica by a group of Scandinavian endocrinologists. The founding editor-in-chief was Axel Westman. The journal was originally sponsored by the national endocrine societies of Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Over its first four years the journal increased its publication frequency from four issues per year to nine issues, and has been published monthly since 1952. The editors-in-chief between 1948 and 1994 were Professor Axel Westman, Dr Christian Hamburger, Dr J√∂rgen Starup and Dr Christian Binder. Albert G Burger was the first editor-in-chief under the new name. Due to the growing international reputation of Acta Endocrinologica, in 1993 the journal was named as an official journal of the European Federation of Endocrine Societies (now European Society of Endocrinology). This change represented a will to broaden the horizons of the publication to the rest of Europe and further afield. As part of this shift, the journal changed its name to the European Journal of Endocrinology in 1994 and began selecting editorial board members from outside Scandinavia. Having had a broad scope covering both basic and clinical endocrine research since its foundation in 1948, in 2008 the European Journal of Endocrinology‚Äôs editorial board announced that it would no longer publish basic research but focus on translational and clinical endocrinology. This decision was made to establish the European Journal of Endocrinology as the clinical and translational journal of the European Society of Endocrinology, complementing the Society‚Äôs other official journals (Journal of Endocrinology, Journal of Molecular Endocrinology and Endocrine-Related Cancer).  Online access  The European Journal of Endocrinology was first published online in July 1997 in PDF format. From January 2005, the online offering was extended to include the HTML full text version of articles and separate figures. All peer-reviewed editorial and review content is free to access from publication. Research articles are under access control for the first 12 months before being made available to the public. During the first 12 months the content is accessible for those at subscribing institutions and members of the European Society of Endocrinology. The journal automatically deposits articles to PubMed Central on behalf of authors who are funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for release 12 months from publication, enabling authors to comply with the NIH Public Access Policy. The European Journal of Endocrinology is a hybrid open access journal, offering a ‚Äògold‚Äô open access option whereby authors can pay an article publishing charge upon acceptance to have their article made freely available online immediately upon publication. These articles are automatically deposited into PubMed Central.

History The original band members were Suzanne Thomas, Rick Good, and Dave Edmundson. Their interest in the country music of the 1920s and 1930s, boosted by the success of the New Lost City Ramblers, inspired them to study the recordings of pre-World War II artists such as the Carter Family, Uncle Dave Macon, Jimmie Rodgers, the Delmore Brothers, and the Skillet Lickers. They were regular performers at string music festivals in the 1970s, playing hundreds of dates with an entertaining stage show and an unusual \\"mix of old time and bluegrass influences.\\" Between 1974 and 1978, the Hotmuds recorded four LPs for Vetco Records in Cincinnati.

At some point between 1631 and 1641, he became organist and master of the choristers of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. Documents at the University of Oxford for the year 1657‚Äì58 record him as holding the position of university organist. He deputised for John Wilson as Heather Professor of Music, succeeding him in 1661; he also became an organist of the Chapel Royal soon afterwards. At Oxford, he increased the university's collection of music by purchases and by receiving gifts. He retained his various positions until his death on 11 July 1682. He was married twice: to Alice Peyton from 1633 until her death in 1649 (with whom he had nine children); and from about 1654 to Mary (with whom he had at least two children). He was buried in the cathedral, close to the grave of his first wife. Compositions and writings In 1661, after the restoration of the monarchy, Lowe wrote a collection of simple settings of music for church and cathedral services, for the use of choirs newly reestablished after the end of the Commonwealth. He composed various pieces for Oxford occasions, including \\"Nunc est canendum\\" (possibly to mark the opening in 1669 of the Sheldonian Theatre), and for Christ Church; some vocal compositions and one work for keyboard also survive.

The collection is located at the University of Victoria Libraries, Special Collections and University Archives (Mearns Centre for Learning), in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and is co- ordinated by founder and academic director Aaron H. Devor and managed by director of Special Collections and university archivist Lara Wilson. All holdings of the Transgender Archives are accessible to the public, free of charge, for personal research, investigation, and exploration. History While there are numerous lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, or LGBT, archival collections in North America, only a few exclusively feature trans, non- binary, and Two-Spirit material. The genesis of the Transgender Archives occurred in 2005 with a conversation between the founder of the archives, Aaron Devor, and Rikki Swin, a one-time Chicago manufacturer of plastic injection moulding and founder of the Rikki Swin Institute who moved to Victoria in 2007. The discussion led Swin to donate her institute's entire material holdings to the University of Victoria Libraries' Archives and Special Collections. Swin's founding donation is one of three major donations held in the archives. The second major donation of material occurred when the daughter of Reed Erickson donated her father's extensive papers to the archives. Reed Erickson, founder of the Erickson Educational Foundation, died in 1992. The third major donation occurred when Professor Richard Ekins donated the entire University of Ulster (Northern Ireland, United Kingdom) Trans-Gender Archive. Officially opening in 2011, the Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria has gathered other smaller donations and has grown to be \\"exceptional in its focus, size, and scope\\" due to its unique position as being one of the only archives in the world that institutionally houses material exclusively reflecting trans, non-binary, and Two-Spirit experiences. Libraries and the LGBTQ community lists the Transgender Archives in their List of LGBTQ Archives/Libraries/Special Collections as one of the only archival institutions that exclusively houses trans material. Collection The Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria contains archival material from both large and small trans organizations and focuses on the contributions of activists and researchers working for the betterment of trans, non-binary, and Two-Spirit people. While the archive currently emphasizes collections from North America and Europe, the materials go back over 120 years, and are in 15 languages from 23 countries on six continents; if the materials were all lined up along one long shelf, the collection would stretch the length of one-and-a- half football fields. Holdings include: approximately 2,000 books, including many rare and first editions; large collection of informational pamphlets and booklets produced by advocacy organizations for educational purposes; historical and organizational records for several significant trans activist groups including personal papers from some leaders; international newsletters from trans communities; multimedia collection representing and recording trans experience; and a large collection of ephemera. At approximately of books, periodicals, and archival materials, the collection is the \\"largest trans- focused archival collection in the world\\". Approximately 25 per cent of the collection is cataloged, with 60 per cent of the collection reflecting male- to-female experiences. While the archives is accessible to the public, free of charge, key documents are slowly being made available online (see external links).

Moving Trans History Forward conferences Moving Trans History Forward conferences are a series of international conferences, founded and led by the chair in Transgender Studies and the academic director of the Transgender Archives, which draw community activists, researchers, educators, artists, service providers, and allies of all ages from around the world. Conferences consider the history of trans activism and research, and the issues which impact trans, non-binary, and two-spirit people today locally, nationally, and globally. The first conference, held at the University of Victoria, March 21‚Äì23, 2014, was entitled \\"Moving Trans* History Forward.\\" Researchers and activists gathered to retrieve and preserve the stories and records of transgender pioneers of the early 1960s onwards. The second conference, entitled \\"Moving Trans History Forward: Building Communities ‚Äì Sharing Connections,\\" took place at the University of Victoria, March 17‚Äì20, 2016. It has been hailed as the largest transgender conference in Canadian history. Trans and gender non-conforming (GNC) community-based scholars and activists, academics, archivists, librarians, family members, and allies of trans and GNC people explored preserving and recounting the history of trans and GNC people and communities in all eras and regions of the world. Events included: keynote speakers Jamison Green and Martine Rothblatt, oral presentations, posters, art exhibits, feature-length trans-themed film Two4One, panel discussion with founders of trans activism and research. The third conference, entitled \\"Moving Trans History Forward: From Generation to Generation,\\" took place at the University of Victoria March 22‚Äì25, 2018. The conference registered 300 people from 11 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East, and drew 600 people to the largest event. Kent Monkman, a Canadian Cree Two- Spirit artist, delivered one of the keynote addresses, with Andrea Jenkins, the first openly transgender black woman elected to public office in the U.S., presenting the second keynote address. The fourth iteration of the Moving Trans History Forward conference will take place in Victoria, British Columbia, from April 2 to 5, 2020, at the Victoria Conference Centre.

Life Charles Aristide Desplanques was born on 6 February 1877 in Ivry-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris. He was a barber by profession. He was arrested in 1903 for a sortie against a placement office. He became a member of the Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail (CGT: General Confederation of Labor) and in 1908 became its Assistant Secretary. He was one of the contributors to the Temps Nouveaux (New Times) of Jean Grave, for which he reported on developments in revolutionary syndicalism. In 1906 Desplanques was imprisoned for a year for signing a poster of the Association internationale antimilitariste (AIA: International Anti-militarist Association). The affiche rouge, as it came to be called, was plastered all over Paris on the night of 6-7 October 1905 on the eve of the annual arrival of military conscripts at the caserne. It appealed to the conscripts to give their alleigance to the working class rather than the bourgeoisie. It then went on to say: \\"when you are commanded to fire your guns at your destitute brothers [during a strike]‚Äîlike what happened at Chalon, Martinique and Limoges‚Äîworkers, soldiers of tomorrow, you will not hesitate; you will obey. You will shoot, but not at your Comrades. You will fire on the decorated ruffian who dares give you such orders...\\" It is possible that Desplanques had not in fact signed the poster, but that Miguel Almereyda and Georges Yvetot had written in his name for him. After his release Desplanques was placed in charge of the CGT newspaper La Voix du Peuple in place of Pouget, who had been imprisoned. He was then, with Georges Yvetot, secretary of the F√©d√©ration des Bourses de travail (Federation of Labor Exchanges). He was drafted as a medical aid during World War I (1914‚Äì18). He moved away from unionism, but continued to contribute to the anarchist press, notably for the review Plus Loin of Dr Pierrot. By 1929 Desplanques was a middle-aged professional advocate of worker's rights. In the Gallia in 1929 he discussed the problem of lunch breaks for coiffeurs. He was against the repas collectif where all employees took lunch at the same time, and in favor of each salon working out its own system of breaks. Charles Desplanques died on 17 July 1951 in Paris at the age of 74.

Biography  His family was involved in several businesses enterprises. When he was five, they sold some of their interests and relocated to Barcelona. In 1855, he was enrolled at the new Collegi Maristes Valldemia in Matar√≥, a private Catholic school.Brief biography at the Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana. While there, he began to scribble drawings in his notebooks and became convinced that he should be an artist. His parents, naturally, wanted him to continue with the family business. Lecture in the Garden (1883) After seeing him in his father's office, drawing pictures on the ledgers and paperwork, they relented and, in 1862, found him a place in the studios of Ramon Mart√≠ Alsina, where he studied for several years. He soon displayed an interest in figure painting, as opposed to his teacher's favored landscapes. =Years in Paris= Lady with a Parasol When he turned eighteen, he received parental permission (and financial support) to study in Paris, where he would remain until 1893, with occasional visits home. During his first years there, he copied masterworks at the Louvre and may have worked briefly with Alexandre Cabanel. He eventually had several small studios in Montmartre and on the Rue Laffitte. He exhibited regularly at the Salon and the Sala Par√©s, back home in Barcelona. He also became a client of the well-known art dealership Goupil & Cie, attracting wealthy buyers throughout Europe and America. This was a relief to his family, who had initially been concerned that they might have to support him indefinitely. Their ability to do so had been compromised as they had lost much of their fortune in the Panic of 1866 and were losing more of it as they paid off their debts. In fact, they eventually moved to Paris so he could help support them. =Return to Barcelona= Street Scene on a Rainy Day (c.1891) He suffered from chronic bronchitis so, after his parents had died (within a year of each other), he decided to return to Barcelona, seeking a milder climate. His sister Carmen had already returned there years before, after her marriage, so he had no relatives left in Paris. Rumors, however, suggested that his real reason for leaving was that his paintings were going out of style. Whatever the reason, he arrived in Barcelona in 1893 and his home soon became a gathering place for the creative community. He continued to exhibit at the Salon in Paris, but never repeated his earlier successes. To help him re-establish himself, his brother-in-law, (a wealthy manufacturer and philanthropist), obtained a commission for him to decorate the ceiling of a new private concert hall at the Liceu. He had never truly gotten over the loss of his mother. By 1898, Carmen had become seriously concerned about his increasing isolation and worsening health. Salvador agreed that something should be done, so he persuaded Miralles to live in \\"The Towers\\", a small house next to theirs where he would have more company, but his health continued to decline. One day, they came to visit and found him lying in front of his easel, dead from an apparent heart attack.

In 2018, Kristine W added her seventeenth number one in the January 27 issue with ‚ÄúStars.‚Äù It also meant that up until this point, 16 of her 18 entries on the chart had reached number-one, the exception being the aforementioned \\"I'll Be Your Light\\".  Eighth: Donna Summer (16)  Summer in December 2009 American singer and songwriter Donna Summer achieved 14 number-one songs on the U.S. Billboard Dance Club Songs chart between 1976 and 2010 before dying in May 2012, and ranked sixth among the top 100 Dance Club Songs artists overall. Summer gained her sixteenth number-one posthumously in 2018 with \\"Hot Stuff 2018\\". Summer's first two chart-toppers (\\"Love to Love You Baby\\" and \\"Try Me, I Know We Can Make It\\") occurred in 1975‚Äì1976, when Billboard published multiple dance charts that were city-specific. During this time, Billboard rival publication Record World compiled a nationwide dance chart. Noted Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn has since \\"adopted\\" Record Worlds chart data from the weeks between March 29, 1975 and August 21, 1976 into Billboards club play history. Billboard columnists, however, only credit Summer with 16 number-ones. Summer, known widely as the \\"Queen of Disco\\", charted several full-length albums on the dance chart, as Billboard policy at the time allowed this (a common practice in the disco era was to segue together several cuts on a side of a vinyl album to replicate a night at a discoth√®que). In 1977, Summer hit number one with three different albums: Four Seasons of Love, I Remember Yesterday and Once Upon a Time. Her eighth dance chart number-one was \\"Hot Stuff\\"/\\"Bad Girls\\", two songs that were joined together on her album Bad Girls. These two songs were released separately as singles and both were also number-ones on the Billboard Hot 100. Summer has also hit number one twice with \\"MacArthur Park\\" ‚Äî once in 1978 and again with a remix in 2013; her last number one before her passing was in 2010 with \\"To Paris with Love.\\" She has had at least one number-one dance hit during the 1970s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s.  Ninth: Lady Gaga (15)  Gaga performing at her residency show, Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom, in April 2014 American singer-songwriter Lady Gaga has achieved fifteen number-one songs, and ranked 16th among the top 100 Dance Club Songs artists in this category. Her first was the second single from her debut album The Fame (2008), \\"Poker Face\\", in February 2009. She topped the chart three more times in 2009, with \\"LoveGame\\" in July, \\"Paparazzi\\" in November, and \\"Bad Romance\\" in December. \\"Bad Romance\\" reached number-one in just four weeks following its debut and spent two consecutive weeks atop the chart. At the time, Gaga was one of only three acts to have achieved four number-one songs in a single calendar year, along with Beyonc√© (who also achieved four in 2009) and Rihanna. Throughout 2010, Gaga collected three more number-one songs. Two similarly titled tracks, \\"Telephone\\" (featuring Beyonc√©) and the remix of \\"Video Phone\\" (Beyonc√© featuring Lady Gaga) became her fifth and sixth chart toppers in February and May, respectively. \\"Telephone\\" topped the chart in its fifth week, becoming Gaga's second fastest ascent to the peak after \\"Bad Romance\\" which did so in four weeks. In July, \\"Alejandro\\" became her seventh number-one out of only eight appearances; her 2008 debut single \\"Just Dance\\" reached a peak of number two. In 2011, Gaga scored four number- one songs in a calendar year for a second time. \\"Born This Way\\" and \\"Judas\\" became her eighth and ninth chart-toppers in April and June, respectively. \\"The Edge of Glory\\" became Gaga's tenth number-one on August 13; with this chart entry, Gaga broke the record for logging 10 chart toppers in the shortest time span in just two years, five months and three weeks, and became the twelfth artist in the history of the chart to log at least 10. The record was previously held by Rihanna, who had achieved ten number-ones between 2005 and 2009 in four years and five months. It also meant that Gaga had tallied the most number-ones since \\"Poker Face\\" had done so; Beyonc√© and Katy Perry had both achieved seven in the same time frame. It was followed up by her eleventh with \\"Yo√º and I\\" in October. In January 2012, \\"Marry the Night\\" became Gaga's twelfth number-one. The song became the fifth from Gaga's second studio album Born This Way (2011) to top the Dance Club Songs chart and also matched \\"Telephone\\" for her second-quickest ascent to the peak following its debut at five weeks. It once again meant that Gaga had logged the most number- one songs on the chart since \\"Poker Face\\" did so, although Beyonc√© had since increased her tally from seven to nine. \\"Applause\\", the lead single from her third studio album Artpop (2013), became her thirteenth to top the chart in October 2013. Gaga's fourteenth number-one was \\"Til It Happens to You\\" in January 2016. A ballad about sexual assault and rape on college campuses in its original form, it was commissioned with nearly 30 remixes from various remixers and producers including Dave Aud√©, Tracy Young and Dirty Pop, transforming it into a club track. With her 2018 single \\"Shallow\\" reaching number one, Gaga moved up to number eight on the ranking, amassing a total of 15 chart toppers.  Joint Tenth (14)  =Dave Aud√©= American musician, remixer, songwriter, and producer Dave Aud√© has amassed 14 number ones on the Dance Club Songs chart, making him the only producer on this list to achieve this feat, as well as the only non-singing artist on this list, although if his side project JX Riders is factored in, he actually would have 15 due to having topped the chart with his cover of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" during the week of September 10, 2016.\\"Lindsey Stirling Scores Third No. 1 on Top Dance/Electronic Albums Chart\\" from Billboard (September 1, 2016) He joined this threshold during the week of February 25, 2017, when his updated version of the 2006 Bodyrox single \\"Yeah Yeah,\\" with the song's original vocalist Luciana, reached the top spot. Among his number ones at Dance Club Songs: \\"Make It Last\\" (2007), \\"Grass Is Greener\\" (with Sisely Treasure) (2009), \\"Figure It Out\\" (with Isha Coco) (2010), \\"Never Forget\\" (featuring Lena Katina) (2012), \\"Something For The Weekend\\" (with Luciana) (2012), Hold Me (with Yoko Ono) (2012), \\"Electricity & Drums (Bad Boy)\\" (with Akon & Luciana) (2013), \\"Take Me Away\\" (with Rokelle) (2014), \\"Aftermath (Here We Go)\\" (with Erasure singer Andy Bell) (2014), \\"Hustlin'\\" (with Vassy and Crazibiza) (2014), \\"Im Gonna Get You\\" (featuring Jessica Sutta) (2015), \\"You Have to Believe\\" (featuring Olivia Newton-John and Chloe Lattanzi) (2015), and \\"True Original,\\" (featuring Andy Bell) (2016)\\"'Star Wars' Is a Dance Chart Force, Dave Aude Hits Milestone\\" from Billboard (March 4, 2016) In an interview with Billboard, Aud√© quoted, \\"I'm thrilled to have hit No. 1 for the 14th time (with \\"Yeah Yeah 2017\\"). I'm honored that my original songwriting and production have resonated as strongly as my remixes and am grateful to all of the DJs and music fans who have supported me throughout the years.\\"\\"Luciana & Dave Aude Say 'Yeah' to Topping Dance Club Songs Chart\\" from Billboard (February 16, 2017) =Enrique Iglesias= Euphoria World Tour in August 2011 With a total of 14 chart toppers, Enrique Iglesias, who is 14th among the top 100 Dance Club Songs Artist overall, is the only male artist with the most number-one songs on the Dance Club Play chart so far, although Dave Aud√© would tie him in February 2017. His first entry on this chart was also his first Hot 100 number-one: \\"Bailamos\\" in 1999 from his Enrique album. The following year \\"Be With You\\" was the second song from that album to hit the top of the chart. In December 2001 \\"Hero\\" from his album Insomniac hit number one. \\"Escape\\" topped the chart in 2002, followed by \\"Not In Love\\", featuring Kelis, in 2004. Five years later he hit number one with \\"Away\\" (featuring Sean Garrett). During 2010 he hit number one with \\"I Like It\\" (featuring Pitbull). In 2011 both \\"Tonight (I'm Fuckin' You)\\" (featuring Ludacris and DJ Frank E) and \\"I Like How It Feels\\" (featuring Pitbull and The WAV.s) hit number one. During 2013 \\"Turn The Night Up\\" extended his record. \\"Bailando\\", featuring Descemer Bueno and Gente de Zona, became his thirteenth number one in 2014. On the week ending September 17, 2016, Iglesias broke out of a three way tie among male artists with the most number ones at Dance Club songs with his second Spanish-language track \\"Duele el Coraz√≥n\\" featuring Wisin. One of the several \\"Duele el Corazon\\" remixes that was played in clubs was also remixed by Aud√©. When Billboard asked Iglesias about making history on this chart, the Spanish-born singer/songwriter came up with this explanation: \\"No. 1 on the Dance Chart... And I don't dance. Quite amazing, if you ask me!\\"\\"Enrique Iglesias Celebrates 14th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart -- The Most Among Men\\" from Billboard (September 7, 2016) =Pitbull= Pitbull on Enrique Iglesias' Euphoria Tour in 2011. American rapper/singer/producer/songwriter Pitbull became the first rap/hip-hop artist to accumulate the most number ones on the Dance Club Songs chart, having reached the top spot fourteen times in his career, although out the 14 songs, eleven had him as a featured artist: five with Jennifer Lopez (including her alias Lola, and as one of two artists along with Iggy Azalea who share separate collaborations on \\"Booty\\"), three with Enrique Iglesias, one with Ricky Martin, and one with Livvi Franc (as his collaboration as a featured artists on her 2009 single \\"Now I'm That Bitch,\\" for which he also co-wrote, was his first number-one on this chart). He achieved this feat during the week of June 10, 2017, when his featured collaboration with Austin Mahone on the remake of Modjo's \\"Lady\\" took the top spot.\\"Austin Mahone Earns First No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart\\" from Billboard (May 31, 2017) =Kylie Minogue= Minogue performing at The Queen's Birthday Party in 2018. Australian singer-songwriter and actress Kylie Minogue has achieved 14 number-one songs on the U.S. Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, the most of any artist from Australia to date. Although her US chart run began in 1988 with her debut single \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" (which peaked at number 10), it would not be until 2001 when she landed her first number one on the Dance Club Songs chart with \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head,\\" which also peaked at number 7 on the Hot 100, resulting in her first gold single in the United States. Her nine other number one singles on the Dance Club Songs chart (as a solo artist) included \\"Love at First Sight\\" in 2002, \\"Slow\\" in 2003, \\"All the Lovers\\" and \\"Get Outta My Way\\" in 2010, \\"Better than Today\\" and \\"Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)\\" in 2011, \\"Timebomb\\" and \\"Skirt\\" in 2013, and \\"Into the Blue\\" in 2014.

Personnel =Host/narrator= As an anthology series, Death Valley Days had no continuing cast of characters other than The Old Ranger, who introduced and narrated each episode. Over the years, The Old Ranger was played by Jack MacBryde, Tim Daniel Frawley, George Rand, and Harry Humphreys. In the later versions (Death Valley Sheriff and The Sheriff) Sheriff Mark Chase was portrayed by Robert Haag, Donald Briggs, and Bob Warren. Announcers were George Hicks, Dresser Dahlstead, and John Reed King. =Creator/writer= Ruth Cornwall Woodman was a writer for McCann Erickson when that advertising agency's executives decided to launch Death Valley Days. As one of the few agency employees who wrote for radio, Woodman was assigned to write the scripts for Death Valley Days. \\"The program's sponsor, Pacific Coast Borax Company, stipulated that the writer should have a first-hand knowledge of the Death Valley region,\\" so for 14 years Woodman went to Death Valley each summer to gather information that she could use in her scripts. Each summer's trip provided enough material for Woodman to write scripts for the next season of the program. She continued to write for the program after its radio broadcasts ended and the televised version began. A 1962 newspaper article noted, \\"Mrs. Woodman has written every one of the Death Valley Days scripts for 31 years -- which amounts to more than 1,000 stories.\\" Sponsors For most of its time on the air, Death Valley Days was sponsored by the Pacific Borax Company, manufacturer of 20 Mule Team Borax. Dunning wrote: \\"The show immediately established its ties to the sponsor.\\" The third episode dealt with finding borax at Furnace Creek, and several episodes dealt with 20-mule teams. Procter & Gamble and American Chicle Company became sponsors of The Sheriff in 1951.

A son of Lope de Vega he is owned in partnership by Prince A. A. Faisal and Godolphin Racing and trained in Nemarket by Roger Varian. In 2014 he won two of his first four races including the Washington Singer Stakes before recording an upset victory in the Dewhurst Stakes. He was rated the best two-year-old to race in Europe that year. He failed to win as a three- year-old in 2015 but returned to winning form on his first start of 2016 with victory in the Listed Doncaster Mile Stakes and went on to take the Lockinge Stakes. Background Belardo is a bay horse with a white blaze bred in Ireland by the County Kilkenny-based Ballylinch Stud. He is from the first crop of foals sired by the Prix du Jockey Club winner Lope de Vega: other foals from Lope de Vega's first crop included the winners of the Gran Criterium, Sirenia Stakes and Cornwallis Stakes. Belardo's dam Danakaya won only one minor race but was placed in both the Lowther Stakes and the Cheveley Park Stakes. As a descendant of the outstanding racemare Midget, she was distantly related to the 1000 Guineas winner Ma Biche. In August 2013, the yearling was sent to the Arqana Sale at Deauville where he was bought for ‚Ç¨100,000 by Voute Sales Ltd on behalf of the Saudi Prince A. A. Faisal. He was sent into training with Roger Varian at the Kremiln House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= In his first season, Belardo was ridden in all of his races by Andrea Atzeni who said at the end of the year \\"I've always liked him. When I first sat on him I said to Roger that he was one of the best two-year-olds I have ever sat on. When I sat on Kingston Hill, he never gave me this sort of feel.\\" The colt made his racecourse debut at Great Yarmouth Racecourse on 26 June when he started 8/13 favourite for a maiden race over six furlongs. He raced close behind the leaders before moving forward to take the advantage inside the final furlong and went clear in the closing stages to win \\"readily\\" by two and a quarter lengths from Heartbreak Hero and six others. Two weeks leader, the colt was moved up sharply in class to contest the Group Two July Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. Starting the 5/1 second favorite in a field of twelve, he was close behind the leaders for most of the way but was unable to make progress in the final furlong and finished fourth behind Ivawood, Jungle Cat and Muhaarar. Belardo was dropped back to Listed class for the Washington Singer Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 16 August. Racing on softer ground, he started 5/4 favourite and won by three and three quarter lengths from Hawkesbury, after accelerating clear of his opponents in the final furlong. On 13 September at Doncaster Racecourse, Belardo contested the Group Two Champagne Stakes over seven furlongs on good ground and started 3/1 second favourite behind Estidhkaar, a Richard Hannon Jr.-trained colt who had won the Superlative Stakes. He raced in second place but failed to quicken in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Estidhkaar, War Envoy and Aces. Varian later said \\"He was too fresh... He raced too keen. He raced free for three furlongs and then it turned into a sprint... Andrea was very disappointed\\". On his final appearance of the season the colt was one of six colts to contest Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the seven furlong Dewhurst Stakes, run on soft ground at Newmarket on 17 October. Wearing a hood for the first time he was the 10/1 outsider of the field behind Estidhkaar, Smugglers Cove (Star Appeal Stakes), Maftool (Somerville Tattersall Stakes), Kodi Bear (Winfield Stakes) and Secret Brief (Tattersalls Millions 2-y-o Trophy). Atzeni restrained the colt at the rear of the field as Secret Brief made the running from Kodi Bear. When he moved forward in the final quarter mile he looked unlikely to obtain a clear run, but was then switched right and overtook Kodi Bear a furlong out. Belardo accelerated clear in the closing stages and won by two lengths from Kodi Bear with Smugglers Cove taking third ahead of Estidhkaar. After the race, Varian said \\"This horse will have confidence going into the winter now. We will now have to dream about the 2000 Guineas. It's a lovely way to end the season... I don't think soft ground is essential but he obviously handles it and he has a very sharp turn of foot, which he showed. He had to be brave and had to squeeze through a gap as well.\\" Less than two weeks later, Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin Racing bought a majority share in Belardo. Sheikh Mohammed's bloodstock advisor John Ferguson called him \\"a lovely horse, full of quality\\". =2015: three-year-old season= On 18 April, Belardo made his first appearance as a three-year-old in the Greenham Stakes over seven furlongs on fast ground at Newbury. Ridden by James Doyle he started the 7/1 third choice in the betting but never looked likely to win and finished eighth of the nine runners behind Muhaarar. On softer ground in the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh Racecourse on 23 May the colt produced a much better effort to finish fourth of the eleven runners behind Gleneagles, beaten less than two lengths by the winner. In this he was re-equipped with the hood which he had not worn at Newbury. His next three runs were disappointing as he finished unplaced in the Sussex Stakes, the Prix Jacques Le Marois and the Haydock Sprint Cup. He was dropped to Group Two class for the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket on 7 October and finished third, beaten a neck and half a length by Cable Bay and Breton Rock. Ten days later he started a 33/1 outsider for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Ridden by Doyle, he produced his best performance of the season, coming from well off the pace to take second place, three quarters of a length behind Solow, with Gleneagles, Kodi Bear, Integral and Elm Park among the beaten horses. Varian commented \\"I'm delighted the horse has reminded us what a talent he was this time last year. He has turned up and put up a high-level performance again. The horse has made a case for staying in training.\\". =2016: four-year-old season= Belardo began his third season with a win in the Listed Doncaster Mile on 2 April but then finished only fourth behind Toormore when favourite for the Bet365 Mile at Sandown on 22 April. On 14 May Belardo was one of twelve horses to contest the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury Racecourse in which his opponents included Toormore, Euro Charline (Beverly D. Stakes), Limato (Park Stakes), Kodi Bear (Celebration Mile), Dutch Connection (Jersey Stakes) and Gabrial (Lincoln Handicap). Starting at odds of 8/1 he produced a strong late run up the centre of the course to win by a length from Euro Charline with the Irish challenger Endless Drama a neck away in third. At Royal Ascot Belardo started 9/2 joint-favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes. He proved the best of the European-trained runners but was beaten half a length into second place by the American mare Tepin. Assessment and honours In the International Classification for 2014, Belardo was rated the best two-year-old to have raced in Europe that season with a rating of 119, one pound ahead of the Middle Park Stakes winner Charming Thought and two ahead of the Racing Post Trophy winner Elm Park and the leading fillies Tiggy Wiggy and Found. The Cartier Award winner Gleneagles was a further pound back on 116. Pedigree *Through his sire, Lope de Vega, Belardo is inbred 4 √ó 4 to Machiavellian, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. *Belardo currently serves mares in New Zealand for Haunui Farm and has his first crop of New Zealand born foals arriving in the 2018 season.

It was formerly recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, a status that was removed in 2019 amid controversy over the use of anti-Semitic stereotypes during the carnival and in its promotional materials. The carnival is celebrated in the days preceding Ash Wednesday. It is mainly a street happening; the celebrants dance on the city squares and visit caf√© after caf√©.  History  The Aalst carnival has its origin in the Middle Ages. Cavalcades were held since 1851, yet without organisation by the city council. Only the events starting from 1923 are counted as official editions, as that was when Aalst city council began to organize the parade. In 2010 the Aalst carnaval was awarded the status of UNESCO intangible World Heritage. In December 2019, the mayor of Aalst, Christoph D'Haese (N-VA), applied to UNESCO to have his city's carnival removed from the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, pre-empting its expected removal for ongoing use of anti-Semitic stereotypes. On 13 December 2019, UNESCO withdrew its recognition of Aalst Carnival as part of the cultural heritage of humanity.  Course of events The carnival starts on Sunday and ends on Shrove Tuesday. On the Saturday evening before the start of the carnival, in the De Werf cultural centre, a humorous city council session takes place, in which Prince Carnival receives the city key and local politicians are mocked. The session is held in the local dialect (Oilsjters) and is done by experienced carnival members rather than the actual city council. On Sunday the great carnival parade crosses the streets, a spectacle involving tens of thousands of visitors every year. Over 100 floats are included, and since 1970 the carnival groups are only from Aalst itself. Apart from these large groups smaller 'loose groups' participate; they lay their focus more on mockery and satire than the decorative aspect. These 'small' groups can count as many as 100 members. The Monday parade has a different atmosphere than the Sunday one; the floats don't follow the strict Sunday order of appearance. In the evening, prizes are awarded based on points given on Sunday. In addition, a yearly Broom Dance by the Gilles of Aalst takes place, followed by the \\"onion throw\\". Prince Carnival and party committee members throw onion-sized candies from the balcony of the city hall; some of them include numbers matching prizes and one special prize: a golden onion, uniquely designed for that year's Carnival. In the evening, just as on Monday, many town squares are the centre of celebration. On Tuesday the Stoet van de Voil Jeanetten (Aalst dialect for \\"Parade of the Dirty Sissies\\") goes through the streets. In this parade, men walk around in women's clothes and props such as a bird cage, a herring, fake breasts, corsets, a fur coat, a worn out umbrella and a stroller. This tradition originates from the history of Aalst, when the lower class was too poor to buy or make a beautiful carnival costume. Instead, the men put on the old and worn clothes of their wives. In the evening, a traditional effigy burning takes place to end the carnival event. To extend the time until the burning of the giant puppet, the participants whistle and shout aloud, but once the puppet catches fire the carnival comes to its emotional end with a third evening of celebrations. Since 1953, each year a Prince Carnival is elected; he can reign the city during the entire three-day event. Also Emperor Carnival plays an important role. To become Emperor, one needs to be Prince in three prior events.  Controversies  In 2005 the Saudi ambassador to Belgium conveyed a protest from the Arab League at the hurtful depiction of Muslims in the carnival parade after one group had dressed as terrorists in burqas. The mayor of Aalst expressed displeasure at the Belgian government's apology, on the grounds that the carnival had done nothing to apologise for. In 2013, a group had members who dressed up in SS-uniforms and paraded with cans marked Zyklon B, which led to a protest by UNESCO. In 2019, the carnival group De Vismooil'n entered a float that depicted two Orthodox Jews with hook noses and beards, wearing shtreimels (the fur hats worn by some Hassidic Jews), standing amid bags of cash and guarding a safe, one with a rat on his shoulder. The title of the float was \\"Sabbatical Year\\", in reference to the carnival group's decision to save money by recycling elements of previous displays, with a pun on \\"sabbath\\" and the anti-Semitic trope of Jewish miserliness. The same figures had been used the year before, then representing crusaders, and one hook-nosed head had originally been created as a caricature of a local far-right politician. Unia, the Belgian independent arbitrator for matters concerning discrimination, found that no laws had been broken given the specific context of carnivalesque parody and lack of malicious intent on behalf of the carnival group. The incident led to widespread condemnation from multiple organizations, including the European Commission. In response to the 2019 controversy, Aalst Carnival organizers decided to print advance materials for the 2020 Carnival reproducing caricatures of Orthodox Jews. In anticipation of UNESCO's expected reaction, the mayor of Aalst pre-emptively applied to have his city's carnival removed from the World Heritage list. Israel called for the 2020 carnival to be canceled because of anti-Semitism, but the parade continued as scheduled.Israel calls on Belgium to scrap parade over anti-Semitism AP, 20 Feb 2020 Under international media scrutiny, the 2020 carnival parade featured two different groups costumed as Jews, one carting along a structure labelled \\"Wailing Wall\\" and the other punning on \\"Youth for Climate\\" as \\"Jew for Climate\\", with participants insisting that their intent was satirical rather than anti-semitic.

The magazine includes information, resources and support for both young people and adults involved with The Scout Association and Scouting.

The magazine originated in July 1909 as the Headquarters Gazette, merged with other periodical publications and had several changes of title, content, format and distribution method. Previous and other publications =The Scout (1908‚Äì1966)= The Scout, a weekly magazine for boys, was first published by Cyril Arthur Pearson on 14 April 1908, only weeks after Scouting for Boys, the book which Robert Baden-Powell and Pearson had used to promote the Scout Movement. The editor's office of The Scout initially provided a focus for both adults and boys seeking assistance with starting and running a Scout Troop. The advice given was sometimes at variance with Baden-Powell's wishes and he was horrified at Pearson's allocation of places at \\"the first official Scout camp\\" at Humshaugh, which effectively went to the Scouts who had bought the most copies of the magazine.Jeal, Tim Baden-Powell: Founder of the Boy Scouts, Hutchinson, (pp. 398-399) In 1939, Newnes and Pearson decided that it was not profitable to continue its publication of The Scout, so publication was taken over by The Boy Scouts Association. Eventually, falling sales led The Boy Scouts Association's Committee of the Council to order the closure of the magazine and it ceased publication with the last issue on 3 September 1966. Some regular features from The Scout transferred to The Scouter.Gordon and Brooks p. 58 =The Wolf Cub (1916‚Äì?) and The Trail (1918‚Äì1923)= Other, less successful magazines were also introduced by The Boy Scout Association.

She was born in Dublin, the daughter of Ella Flora Mayne (18281907) and Maurice Keatinge (18161896). Maurice was the Principal Registrar at the Irish Court of Probate; his wife from a long established Wiltshire family with an estate at Teffont Avias. The family moved to London when she was young.1881 England Census On 30 June 1886, at St James's Church, Paddington, Alys married Alexander Pelham Trotter (18571947). He was the son of banker Alexander Trotter (18041865), by his second wife, Isabella Strange (18161878), daughter of Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange. From 1896 to 1899, Alexander was the Electrical advisor to the Cape Colony government in southern Africa. Whilst living there Alys and Alexander explored the Cape and Alys wrote and illustrated \\"Old cape Colony: a chronicle of her men and houses from 1652 to 1806\\". Some of Trotter's drawings are now in the William Fehr Collections in South Africa. See, for example, Head of a Labourer, Pressing Grapes, Old House at Stellenbosch. When they returned to England they lived at Teffont Evias. Trotter wrote poetry and was published in periodicals including Punch and the Cornhill Magazine. Alys and Alexander had a son Alexander Nigel, known as Nigel, born in 1894 and a daughter Gundred Eleanor born in 1889. Nigel was killed in action on 12 October 1914 at La Fosse, near Vielle Chapelle, Bethune: > The ground over which the British had to advance was intersected by small > irrigation canals crossed by plank bridges, on which the officers and men > offered a good target. Lieut. Trotter is believed to have been first hit > while crossing one of these bridges, and after advancing three-quarters of a > mile fell with two more wounds.

Originally proposed as a Kickstarter project seeking US$10,000 in crowdfunding, it exceeded the goal in eight minutes and on January 27, 2015, seven days after opening, it passed 103,000 backers setting the record for the most backers in Kickstarter history. At completion on February 19, 2015, it had US$8,782,571 in pledges by 219,382 backers. The campaign ended as the fourth most funded campaign on the crowdfunding site. The first play test of Exploding Kittens was recorded on YouTube by Smosh Games, who had the first deck.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhsgYhUDA_M The backers started receiving delivery in late July 2015; all backers received the game by September 2015.Exploding Kittens is described as a ‚Äústrategic card game about cats and destruction‚Äù.  Game rules  All cards are put into a deck, save for the Defuse and Exploding Kitten cards. The deck is shuffled and each player draws 7 cards and takes a Defuse card. The Exploding Kitten cards are then shuffled back into the deck so that the number of Exploding Kitten cards in the deck is one less than the number of players. The remaining Defuse cards are then also put back in the deck. A turn order is decided upon. Each player may then play as many cards from their hand as they like on their turn (including none) before drawing a card. Players are not to tell any other player what cards are in their hand. Played cards are put into a discard pile. The first expansion pack, Imploding Kittens, increases the number of players from 5 to 6 and requires a copy of Exploding Kittens to play. There are 20 new cards. The second expansion pack, Streaking Kittens, requires a copy of Exploding Kittens to play. There are 15 new cards.https://shop.explodingkittens.com/collections/all/products/streaking- kittens-expansion-of-exploding-kittens The third expansion pack, Barking Kittens, requires a copy of Exploding Kittens to play.

The creators of the game were initially trying to raise just US$10,000, but ended up getting 219,382 backers on the crowdfunding website. = Achievements = On February 3, 2015, achievements were announced in lieu of stretch goals because the game designers did not want to delay production or distribution of the game to backers. As of February 16, 2015, 30 achievements had been unlocked and the second stretch goal (Unlock 20 Achievements) and third stretch goal (Unlock 30 Achievements) were completed. With the first stretch goal accomplished, the company expanded the NSFW deck to a full stand-alone game. The second stretch goal gave an upgraded storage box which holds two full decks of cards to all backers of the campaign, and the third and final stretch goal includes a Kickstarter-exclusive surprise in the box.  Status  On April 11, 2015, Elite Team Kitten play tested the new game during the International Tabletop Day. Exploding Kittens began shipping to Kickstarter backers in late July 2015. In October 2016, the first expansion Imploding Kittens was released. It introduced the cards/mechanics of Alter the Future, Draw from the Bottom, and Reverse from the mobile game, and the new Imploding Kitten card/mechanic. On July 30, 2017, the Exploding Kittens Party Pack was released in addition to the Cards Against Humanity Hidden Compartment Pack at Target. The party pack is an update to the original game that allows for up to 10 players. It removes the Attack card/mechanic and replaces it with the Slap mechanic from the mobile game. The mechanics introduced in the Imploding Kittens expansion are also included. The Hidden Compartment Pack contains 5 cards of the new mechanic, Blind as a Bat, and 15 new white CAH cards. The card package is hidden in a secret shelf in the Exploding Kittens display at the store.

First described by James Ellsworth De Kay in 1842, it is widespread in the western North Atlantic. Like all sand lances, it has a long, thin body with a pointed snout; mature fish typically range from in length, though some may reach . Its back is greenish-brown, while its sides and abdomen are silvery. It has a long, low dorsal fin (described as \\"very delicate\\") which extends along most of its back, folding into a groove at the fin's base when not in use. Its anal fin is roughly the same height as the dorsal fin, and extends over the posterior third of the fish's body. Its pectoral fins are small, and its caudal fin is forked. Its mouth is large and toothless, with a lower jaw that extends well beyond the upper. It typically travels in large schools, spending most of its time relatively near the water surface. It feeds primarily on plankton, though it is known to take small clams and snails from the sea floor, presumably when plankton is scarce. Towards dusk, schools of A. americanus bury themselves in sand, typically from below the sand's surface close to the water's edge; they avoid rocky areas. They do this to avoid being detected by night-hunting species such as bluefish and stripers. Ammodytes americanus is an important prey item for many species of fish, whales and birds. Breeding roseate terns, a federally endangered species in the United States, feed their chicks almost exclusively on the species.

The episode was written by Akela Cooper, and was directed by Holly Dale. The episode was broadcast on NBC as a Halloween special. In this episode Nick and Hank investigate a case that holds a striking resemblance to a Hispanic legend: La Llorona. With the help of a New Mexico detective, Nick and Hank are faced with a chain of supernatural kidnappings. Elsewhere Monroe is driven by his love of Halloween.  Plot  Opening Quote: \\"On many a dark night people would see her walking along the riverbank and crying for her children.\\" On the eve of Halloween in Portland, Luis Alvarez is spending time with his son Rafael, but Luis is distracted when he tries to help a mysterious crying woman in white who plunges into a river, apparently trying to kill herself. Luis follows, but he can't find the woman. He then turns to helplessly watch as she walks away with Rafael. A desperate Luis enlists the help of the police, but his inability to speak English only delays the case. When Nick and Hank are called to investigate the case, Nick calls Juliette to help translate, given that she can speak Spanish fluently. Thanks to the translation of Juliette, Nick and Hank come to the home of Luis where they look for evidence of any possible suspect. Luis' neighbor Pilar talks with Juliette, claiming that she knows who is the kidnapper, and proceeds to explain that it is \\"La Llorona\\", (The Weeping Woman) a woman who according to several Hispanic legends, is a ghost who takes children to drown them in a river. Shortly after the police leave, Pilar approaches Juliette and warns her that her cat scratch is a sign that someone cursed her. In Albuquerque, a jaguar-like Wesen is alerted by her computer of a new kidnapping and decides to immediately go to the city where it happened: Portland, Oregon. Back in Portland, in the city precinct, the same Wesen, who is revealed to be an Alburquerque detective named Valentina Espinoza. Valentina, who has extensive experience in this case, warns Captain Renard that the woman is a serial killer, and that shortly there will be a second and third child abduction. Shortly afterwards in another river of Portland, a girl is kidnapped by La Llorona, who takes her to her lair with Rafael. Upon learning of the second kidnapping, Nick and Hank begin to trust Valentina, but Captain Renard appears and orders them to place Valentina in custody, given that she was fired from her job for her obsession with the Woman. Nick prevents Valentina from attacking the captain, knowing that she is a wesen, and later the detectives interrogate her to find out if she is involved, but Valentina warns them that there will be a third abduction and claims she is after the woman because she was responsible for the death of her nephew, refusing to believe that the criminal is a ghost. Nick is interested in checking the authenticity of the kidnapper, but when he investigates in Aunt Marie's trailer with Hank, they discover that none of Nick's ancestors were able to determine who La Llorona was. Given the inability to prove that Valentina is right, without really knowing what they are facing and preceded the appearance of the third kidnapping. Nick and Hank free Valentina and with her Spanish translations, all three determine La Llorona drowns the taken children at a point where the rivers connect called \\"abrazo del r√≠o\\" (river's embrace). In the nearby rivers of La Llorona's lair, she prepares to drown the children, in order to bring her own children back from the dead. The process is interrupted by the appearance of Nick, Hank and Valentina. Nick and La Llorona fight on the river where she disappears right before his eyes. Back in the precinct, Nick reunites the children with their parents, and despite the discontent of Captain Renard with the actions of their detectives, he forgives them. Elsewhere in Portland, an excited Monroe celebrates Halloween with much enthusiasm, as he decorates his house. During the course of the day, Monroe prevents some bullies from stealing candy from a little girl. This infuriates the children, and they get even with Monroe by breaking his window with a decoration, built with Nick's medieval weapon. Monroe tricks them, frightening them with his . Reception =Ratings= The episode received a 2.06 18‚Äì49 ratings share and was watched by 6.11 million viewers, a marked increase from the previous episode. The episode premiered after the now cancelled show, Mockingbird Lane. =Critical reception= The episode was met with mixed to positive reviews. Emily Rome of Entertainment Weekly gave it a mixed review since she was surprised by the elements in the episode: \\"Well, lo and behold, Grimm delivered a compelling case-of-the-week in tonight's episode, though it may have not been compelling for the reasons we were hoping for (more on that later).\\" Kevin McnFarland of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B+, stating, \\"This is an example of how to use a popular folktale well; this is the model for episodic storytelling in a supernatural setting. A ‚ÄúVery Special Episode‚Äù of Grimm around Halloween is basically a must because of the show‚Äôs premise. It features streamlined and functional investigation from Nick and Hank, an intriguing guest star in Valentina, the bluish cat Wesen and disgraced detective obsessed with the La Llorona abductions, and even blends in a useful and compelling Juliette storyline to boot.\\" References External links  \\"La Llorona\\" at TV Guide.com Category:Grimm (season 2) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes Category:La Llorona ","title":"La Llorona (Grimm)"},{"id":"45187922","text":"Deutsche Schule Genua () is a German international school in Genoa, Italy.\\"Home.\\" Deutsche Schule Genua.

It is situated about east of Seattle. Located just below the Snoqualmie Falls, the power plant consists of two power houses, Plant 1 and Plant 2. Plant 1 was completed in 1899 and is located underground. It is the first completely underground hydroelectric power plant ever built in the world. Plant 2 was built in 1910 and is located along the right bank of the Snoqualmie River. Both plants receive water from a small reservoir created by a weir atop the falls. Plant 1 has an installed capacity of 13.7 MW and Plant 2 a capacity of 40.2 MW for a total installed capacity of 53.9 MW, enough to power 40,000 homes. Plant 1 was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Snoqualmie Falls Cavity Generating Station on April 23, 1976. In 1981, Plant 1 was also designated as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The power plant is owned by Puget Sound Energy. In 1992, Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places. With History Snoqualmie Falls The power plant was envisioned by Charles H. Baker in the 1890s. Baker was an engineer for the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway and would pass the Snoqualmie Falls routinely during his work. Similar to the Schoellkopf Power Station on Niagara Falls in New York, Baker wanted to exploit the drop in elevation of Snoqualmie Falls for hydroelectric power. After the Panic of 1893 he became unemployed and sought to build the power plant. With funding from his family, to include his father, wealthy businessman William T. Baker, he formed the Snoqualmie Falls Power Company and bought the falls and surrounding land in 1897. Construction on the plant began in 1898. First, a cofferdam was constructed to seal the river from the water intake on the left bank of the Snoqualmie Falls. Steam-powered pneumatic drills were then used to excavate a vertical shaft from the intake to the cavern for Plant 1. A horizontal tunnel was dug as well, which met the vertical shaft at the cavern for Plant 1. A weir was constructed downstream of the intake and just above the falls, to help raise the river above the intake so water could be delivered to the plant. Four Pelton turbines with 1.5 MW Westinghouse generators were initially installed. The first operational generator was online and began to transmit power to Seattle on July 31, 1899. The remainder were commissioned and delivering power to Tacoma as well on November 1, 1899. In 1903 Seattle Electric Company acquired Snoqualmie Falls Power Company. The death of William Baker and financial difficulties that same year ended Charles Baker's stake in the plant. A fifth turbine-generator, horizontal Francis-type, originally rated at 5 MW, was added to Plant 1 in 1905. In 1908 Seattle-Tacoma Power Company, a forerunner to Puget Sound Energy, purchased Seattle Electric Company. A second penstock was added to Plant 2 in 1957. Penstock was supplied and installed by Chicago Bridge &a; Iron Co. Soon after the fifth generator was added to Plant 1, plans for Plant 2 began. Engineer W.A. Brackenridge studied and designed the plant. It would include a tunnel from the weir connected to a forebay would supply water to the future Plant 2, located just downstream from the falls. Plant 2 was commissioned in 1910 with a single 9 MW Francis turbine-generator. To make future expansion possible, the tunnel and penstock were built large enough to supply up to three generators. Plant 2 underwent an expansion beginning in 1956. A second Francis turbine-generator was installed and commissioned in 1957. A larger second penstock was also installed as the new generator was much larger than earlier planned. At this time, the entire power plant had an installed capacity of 44.4 MW. The second turbine for Plant 2 was replaced in 1991 due to end-of-life and it was once again replaced in 2004 as it was damaged by sediment. In 2004, Puget Sound Energy was granted a new 40 year license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which required that the plant maintain a consistent discharge equal to or greater than . =Rehabilitation and upgrade= In April 2010, Puget Sound Energy began a US$200 million project to rehabilitate and upgrade the power plant. The project included retrofitting the first four of the generators in Plant 1 and replacing the fifth. A turbine-generator would be replaced in Plant 2 as well. The weir was lowered to in height, lengthened by and the water-intake structure was replaced. Lowering the weir will help reduce flood waters upstream of the falls. The penstocks, which feed the power plants with water, were to be upgraded as well. Finally, automatic shut-off and bypass valves were installed for Plant 2. The shut-off valves will better prepare the plant for emergencies and the bypass valves will allow water to flow downstream in the case that Plant 2 is offline. To promote tourism, recreation and culture, several upgrades to include new visitor centers, hiking trails, a boardwalk and improved landscaping were implemented. Renovations on Plant 2 were completed in April 2013. The new 6.5 MW Francis turbine generator in Plant 1 and the entire project was finished in mid-2014. The project raised the installed capacity of the power plant from 44.4 MW to 53.9 MW. Design To supply water to Plant 1 and 2, a weir with a height ranging creates a small reservoir. The intake for Plant 1 is located just above the left abutment of the weir. Water from the intake enters a long and diameter vertical penstock which supplies water to the plant. Plant 1 is located in a cavern below and about behind the falls. The cavern is long, wide and high. It houses four 1.8 MW Pelton turbine-generators and one 6.5 MW Francis turbine-generator. Water discharged from Plant 1, at a rate of up to , is returned to the river below the falls via a long tailrace tunnel. The intake for Plant 2 is located near the right abutment of the weir. Water first enters a tunnel along a ridge which parallels the river downstream of the falls. It reaches a forebay which temporarily stores water before it is sent to the plant. From the forebay, a gatehouse releases water into two penstocks, each roughly with the larger having a diameter of . The penstocks connect to Plant 2 which is located on the right bank of the Snoqualmie River. It houses a 13.7 MW and a 26.5 MW Francis turbine-generator. Water discharged from Plant 2, at a rate of up , immediately enters the river.

History The building was constructed in 1950. It was named for Donald M. Erb.Erb Memorial Union HistoryPast Presidents -- Donald Milton Erb Two subsequent additions were built in 1962 and 1973 respectively. Facilities The EMU dining facility known as \\"The Fishbowl\\" was the site of the famous food-fight scene in National Lampoon's Animal House.Fishbowl Renovations The EMU Ballroom is a notable concert venue and has hosted shows by acts such as Grateful Dead, R.E.M., and Bob Dylan.Grateful Dead: January 30, 1968R.E.M.: October 2, 1986Bob Dylan: June 14, 1999 The EMU was the site of Eugene's University Station post office. Management and governance The Erb Memorial Union board of directors is responsible for making general policy decisions and long-range plans for the operation of the EMU. The board allocates the EMU's multimillion-dollar budget, assigns space for student groups and advises staff in the management of the EMU. The sixteen-member board consists of twelve students (seven elected in a campus-wide election and five direct appointments from either EMU programs or the Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO), three faculty members appointed by the University of Oregon president and one EMU staff member elected by their peers. Every fiscal year, the EMU Board prepares a benchmark increase to the ASUO Senate for approval. After the benchmark process, the EMU presents its final budget to the senate, requesting a decrease, increase, or no change in incidental fees to be allocated to the EMU. If the budget request is approved, the budget must be signed by the ASUO President and then the UO President. Unlike the budget process, any general policy decisions by the EMU Board do not require senate oversight or approval. Renovation University of Oregon officials have considered a number of projects modernize the aging building. In the early 2000s there was a push for the building to undergo a significant deferred maintenance project. However, that was proposal was scrapped, after it was determined that the building's layout and size were not adequate for current enrollment numbers. Additionally, the much-criticized layout resulted in student access concerns. Ultimately, it has decided that the building would undergo a massive renovation and expansion project. The $95 million project will renovate and modernize the 1950s wing and build a new structure on the site of the 1970s addition. Controversy The initial renovation project called for the inclusion of a 1,200-seat concert hall. The concert hall was to be partly funded by private donations. According to a UO official, the Beall Concert Hall, which is the only concert hall on campus, is not an adequate building because it lacks the size to accommodate large shows and there are some noted concerns relating to sound efficiency. However, student groups did not support this addition. The ASUO president criticized the commercial driven nature of the project.

He was on the books of Middlesbrough and Millwall, without playing for either in the League, and played non-league football for clubs including Halifax Town, Stalybridge Celtic, Spennymoor United, Gateshead, Guisborough Town and Billingham Synthonia. Life and career Sunley was born in Guisborough, Yorkshire, where he attended Laurence Jackson School. As a youngster, he played for Hartburn Juniors in Stockton, from where he joined Middlesbrough's youth system. On leaving school he was taken on the club's YTS scheme and then given a professional contract by manager Bruce Rioch. He played for the club in the 1990 FA Youth Cup final, a 3‚Äì2 defeat over two legs to Tottenham Hotspur, but never broke through to the first team. When Colin Todd took over as Middlesbrough manager, Sunley followed Rioch to Millwall in 1991, but again never played first-team football. He finally made his Football League debut with Third Division club Darlington in the 1991‚Äì92 season, and went on to make 35 league appearances over three seasons. In the 1994‚Äì95 season, he played eight times for Halifax Town in the Conference, twice for Stalybridge Celtic also in the Conference, and twice in the Third Division (fourth tier) for Hartlepool United, and then joined Northern Premier League club Spennymoor United. Sunley made five substitute appearances for Gateshead in the Northern Premier League in 2000‚Äì01, and played rather more frequently in the following season. and In August 2002, he was told he was free to leave, and signed for hometown club Guisborough of the Northern League.

Geeks OUT has left a \\"solid impact on geek culture.\\" Geeks OUT is host to the world's largest LGBTQ queer comic con, Flame Con. The organization also came to international attention when it started a Skip Ender's Game movement in 2013. The movement, often promoted with the #SkipEndersGame hashtag, called for a boycott of the film Ender's Game, based on the novel Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. Purpose Geeks OUT is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to rallying, empowering and promoting the queer geek community. Founded in 2010 with the goal of bringing a positive queer presence to local comic conventions, Geeks OUT now hosts events in five major cities, attends conventions across the nation and produces the world's largest LGBTQ comic convention - Flame Con. Geeks OUT is also the publisher behind Power! An Anthology of Queer Creators and the forthcoming Serving Pride: The Queer History Dinner Party Handbook. Board Members Geeks OUT was originally founded by Josh Siegel and Joey Stern. In 2018, Geeks OUT announced their new Board Members, including the organization's first female president, Nicole Gitau. 2018 Board Members: * Nicole Gitau - President * Steve Gianaca - Vice President * Zobel Belisario - Board Member * Kevin Gilligan - Board Member * Rachel Greeman - Board Member * John Jennison - Board Member * Mary Martinez - Board Member * Kyle-Steven Porter - Board Member * Jon Shutt - Board Member * Joey Stern - Board Member Events Geeks OUT holds events across the country in large cities including: New York City, Seattle, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and more. Geeks OUT is often present at comic conventions, sometimes called \\"comic cons\\", either tabling, hosting discussion panels, or having a booth. In 2013, they partnered with the New York Times for a discussion panel called New York Times OUT and Geeks Out present LGBT and Allies in Comics, which was held at the New York Comic Con. The panel included Dan Parent, Marjorie Liu, Greg Pak, Jude Biersdorf, Dan Ketchum, and Rich Bernatovech, among others. In November 2014, the group started a fundraising campaign to start New York City's first queer comic convention. Called Flame Con, the convention fundraiser met its $15,000 goal on December 4, 2014. The project eventually received close to $20,000 in fundraising support on Kickstarter. The fundraising was endorsed by OUT Magazine, BUST Magazine, NewNowNext, and others. Another event included 'McKellen Me Softly', a celebration of Ian McKellen with all original artwork featuring the actor for sale. The proceeds from the event went to fund the nonprofit. Jono Jarrett, a founding member of Geeks OUT, stated, \\"Geeks OUT could not be more proud to honor the unparalleled creative achievements and beloved personality of Sir Ian McKellen as this year's queer geek icon. We're inspired by his courage, his talent, and his fabulous joie de vivre -- whether he's leading a band of Hobbits across Middle Earth, or Sir Patrick Stewart across the Brooklyn Bridge. By tragedy or trial we grow stronger, but our community must never neglect to celebrate our success stories. Sir Ian McKellen is the happy hero we need.\\"  Skip Enders Game  The Skip Enders Game movement raised Geeks OUT's profile and brought attention to Orson Scott Card's views on homosexuality. Geeks OUT posited that since Card was a board member of the National Organization for Marriage and holds anti-gay views, people should not financially support his projects. Their message: \\"Skip Ender‚Äôs Game is a call to action. Do NOT see this movie! Do not buy a ticket at the theater, do not purchase the DVD, do not watch it on-demand. Ignore all merchandise and toys. However much you may have admired his books, keep your money out of Orson Scott Card‚Äôs pockets.\\" Geeks OUT members were interviewed by Michelangelo Signorile on his radio XM show to talk about the boycott. The movement received coverage from Towleroad, Mother Jones, The Huffington Post, and other mainstream media with discussions about artistic works and if the artist's personal beliefs affect them. In response, Card issued a statement saying, \\"Ender‚Äôs Game is set more than a century in the future and has nothing to do with political issues that did not exist when the book was written in 1984. With the recent Supreme Court ruling, the gay marriage issue becomes moot. The Full Faith and Credit clause of the Constitution will, sooner or later, give legal force in every state to any marriage contract recognized by any other state.\\" The movement also received criticism, including criticism from Diane Anderson-Minshall, editor-at-large of The Advocate. She stated, \\"In a world where ethical consumerism is sometimes the best way to get our point across, art is a murky zone... Our mouths say boycott, but our TV remotes don‚Äôt always back that up.\\" References Category:2010 establishments in New York City Category:LGBT history in New York City Category:LGBT political advocacy groups in New York (state) Category:LGBT-related websites Category:Organizations established in 2010 ","title":"Geeks OUT"},{"id":"45188143","text":"Liver regeneration is the process by which the liver is able to replace lost liver tissue from growth from the remaining tissue. The liver is the only visceral organ that possesses the capacity to regenerate. The liver can regenerate after either surgical removal or after chemical injury. It is known that as little as 51% of the original liver mass can regenerate back to its full size. The process of regeneration in mammals is mainly compensatory growth because only the mass of the liver is replaced, not the shape. However, in lower species such as fish, both liver size and shape can be replaced.  Mechanism  There are two events in which the liver has the capability to regenerate, one being a partial hepatectomy and the other being damage to the liver by toxins or infection (1). The processes described below deal with the pathways triggered after a partial hepatectomy. Following the event of partial hepatectomy, there are three phases for the process of regeneration. The first phase is the priming phase and during this portion, hundreds of genes are activated and prepare the liver for regeneration. This priming phase occurs within 0-5 hours after the hepatectomy and deals mainly with events prior to entering the cell cycle and ensuring that hepatocytes can maintain their homeostatic functions. The second phase deals with the activation of various growth factors such as EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and c-Met. These two factors are major components of liver regeneration. The final phase deals with termination of proliferation by TGF-Œ≤ (transforming growth factor beta). Immediately after a hepatectomy, there is an activation of numerous signaling pathways that start the process of regeneration. The first being an increase in urokinase activity. Urokinase is known to activate matrix remodeling. This remodeling causes the release of HGF (hepatic growth factor) and from this release now c-Met can also be activated. EGFR is also activated in the same way as c-Met, and these two growth factors play a major role in the regeneration process. These processes occur outside of the hepatocyte and prime the liver for regeneration. Once these processes are complete, hepatocytes are able to enter the liver to start the process of proliferation. This is because there is a communication between Œ≤-catenin (inside the hepatocyte) and the growth factors of EGFR and c-Met (outside the hepatocyte). This communication can occur because of Œ≤-catenin and Notch-1 move to the nucleus of the hepatocyte approximately 15-30 minutes after the hepatectomy. The presence of these two proteins increases the regenerative response and the HGF and EGFR act as direct mitogens and can produce a strong mitogenic response for the hepatocytes to proliferate. After the regeneration process has completed, TGF-Œ≤ puts an end to the proliferation by inducing apoptosis. TGFŒ≤1 inhibits the proliferation of hepatocytes by repressing HGF. As mentioned above, urokinase activated the release of HGF; therefore, TGFŒ≤1 also represses the urokinase activity. This process is able to bring the hepatocytes back into their quiescent state. Sometimes, hepatocytes do not have the ability to proliferate and an alternative form of regeneration is able to take place to rebuild the liver. This can happen with the help of biliary epithelial cells having the capability of turning into hepatocytes when the original hepatocytes have problems proliferating. This is due to the fact that biliary cells have two functions, one being the normal transport of bile and the other becoming stem cells for hepatocytes. The same also occurs vice versa, with hepatocytes being able to turn into biliary cells when they cannot proliferate. Both of these kinds of cells are facultative stem cells for each other. Facultative stem cells originally have one fate but upon injury of another type of cell, can function as a stem cell. These two types of cells can repair liver tissue even when the normal mechanism of liver regeneration fails.  Function  The ability for the liver to regenerate is central to liver homeostasis. Because the liver is the main site of drug detoxification, it is exposed to many chemicals in the body which may potentially induce cell death and injury. The liver can regenerate damaged tissue, rapidly thereby preventing its own failure. However, a predictor of the true speed of liver regeneration depends on whether Interleukin 6 has overexpression. Liver regeneration is also critical for patients of liver diseases where the partial removal of the liver due to fibrosis or tumor is a common therapy that utilizes the ability of the remaining liver to generate back.  Experimental models  Two main types of models are used to study liver regeneration, including surgical removal, also referred to as partial hepatectomy (PHX), and chemical-induced liver damage. Whereas the mechanisms and kinetics of liver regeneration in these two models are different, many of the same signaling pathways stimulate liver regeneration in both pathways. In myth The Torture of Prometheus, Salvator Rosa, 1646-1648. In Greek mythology, Prometheus and Tityos are trespassers against the gods whose punishments involve their livers being eaten by birds of prey by day and regenerated by night.

Ezra, was a Baghdadi Jewish publisher and Zionist based in Shanghai. He founded the Shanghai Zionist Association in 1903 and its official newspaper, Israel's Messenger, one of China's oldest and most sophisticated Jewish periodicals. He served as editor-in-chief of the newspaper for more than 30 years until his death in 1936. Influenced by Ezra, his nephews started the newspaper Jewish Tribune in Bombay, India. Biography First issue of Israel's Messenger, 22 April 1904 Silver jubilee issue of Israel's Messenger, 5 April 1929 Nissim Elias Benjamin Ezra was a Baghdadi Jew born in Lahore, British India (now Pakistan), and settled in Shanghai, China. An ardent Zionist, he established the Shanghai Zionist Association (SZA) in 1903 and its official newspaper, Israel's Messenger, in 1904. The newspaper was one of China's oldest Jewish periodicals, and became one of the most sophisticated under Ezra's leadership. He served as Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper for more than 30 years until his death in 1936. It was also circulated in the United States, where it successfully positioned itself as the most authoritative Jewish voice in East Asia. Ezra also served as the main leader of the Shanghai Zionist Association, which had about 100 members in March 1905, for many years. A major financial supporter of the movement was the tycoon Elly Kadoorie, who became chairman of the SZA in 1915. Despite their efforts, Zionism did not become a major cause of the wealthy Baghdadi Jews of Shanghai, who were organized as the Shanghai Jewish Community Association. On the other hand, Ezra received support from Sun Yat-sen, leader of China's nationalist revolution. In a letter to Ezra dated 24 April 1920, Sun wrote that \\"all lovers of Democracy cannot help but support wholeheartedly and welcome with enthusiasm the movement to restore your wonderful and historic nation, which has contributed so much to the civilization of the world and which rightfully deserves an honorable place in the family of nations.\\" On 5 December 1936, Ezra died of heart disease in Shanghai. Views N.E.B. Ezra held a pessimistic view of the West, at a time when Europe was dominated by the regimes in Germany and Russia, which were responsible for widespread human rights abuses. He saw the East a refuge of humanity, and pleaded for a new Buddha, who, like Moses, Confucius, Jesus, and Mohammed, would save the world from the threat of tyranny. That view made him controversial among the Sephardi Jewish community. Ezra extolled the contributions made by the Jews to the development and modernization of China, and thought following the teachings of Confucius would save China and move the world: \\"Confucius pleaded for justice and righteousness; he made morality and good government synonymous. If the country is willing to follow him and adopt his teachings then China will be able to 'move the world' in the real sense of the word.\\" The view was seen as overly idealistic for the time, when China was faced with grave threats from Japanese imperialism. On 15 September 1933, Ezra wrote a letter to Mamoru Shigemitsu and proposed to resettle the European Jews persecuted by Nazi Germany in Manchukuo. He also wrote to Israel Cohen, secretary of the World Zionist Organization in London, for support. Cohen opposed his plan, noting that it would be inappropriate to settle the refugees in Japanese-occupied Manchukuo, and the potential instability that might result from the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union in Manchuria. Legacy Ezra's nephews, the Sargon brothers (Benjamin, Joseph, and David) of Bombay, grew up reading Israel's Messenger. Greatly influenced by Ezra's journalistic concepts, the brothers edited the Jewish Advocate (later renamed the Jewish Tribune) in the 1930s, bringing it to a much higher level of professionalism than the older Jewish newspapers of Bombay.

The State Guard is recognized as a military force separate from the South Dakota National Guard. Unlike the National Guard, the State Guard is a purely state-level military force under the command of the Governor of South Dakota, and cannot be federalized or deployed outside the borders of the state. The South Dakota State Guard was active during World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War and provided military protection to the state of South Dakota while the National Guard was in federal service. History =Predecessor units= Prior to the creation of the modern National Guard of the United States, the United States maintained a relatively small professional military and relied on state militias to augment the federal military in times of war. In 1901, the South Dakota Legislature designated the South Dakota State Guard as the organized militia of South Dakota, and required that the state maintain a certain minimum strength of cavalry, artillery, and infantry units. After the passage of the Militia Act of 1903, state militia units were reorganized into National Guard units and operated as a reserve component of the federal military. =World War I= The South Dakota National Guard was federalized in 1917. By 1917, Home Guard units were organizing in various counties and townships. In 1918, the South Dakota Legislature passed legislation allowing for the creation of a Home Guard. South Dakota‚Äôs Home Guard, which was particularly active in protecting property from fire, reached a strength of 100 companies consisting of approximately 7,000 men by the end of the war. The State Guard was disbanded later in 1918. =World War II= Following the federalization of the South Dakota National Guard during World War II, South Dakota raised four companies of militia using the existing state legislation authorizing the National Guard, but did not request or receive federal recognition for these state units. The State Guard of World War II was organized into four companies, based in Aberdeen, Watertown, Pierre, and Sioux Falls. By 1944, the State Guard mustered a strength of 195 men. South Dakota also created a state unit under the authority of the State Adjutant General in 1942 called the Fire Protection Force (FPF), consisting of two line companies and one headquarters company, in the Black Hills region to control fires in the region. The federal government was responsible for most of the region and supplied the FPF with its equipment. The State Guard was disbanded in 1948. =Korean War= The South Dakota State Guard was reactivated during the Korean War from the years 1954 to 1956. Legal status The authority of each state to maintain a state defense force is recognized by the federal government under Title 32, Section 109 of the United States Code. Under this legislation, twenty-three other states and the territory of Puerto Rico currently maintain state defense forces. The South Dakota State Guard Act grants the Governor of South Dakota the authority to organize the South Dakota State Guard at his or her discretion, making reactivation possible either through an act of legislature or by executive order.

The account is based on its American counterpart, Rich Kids of Instagram. The account was shut down in October 2014, but resurfaced shortly after. The account has shown people drinking alcohol and young women not wearing hijabs, both of which are illegal in Iran. On 9 January 2020, the account published videos and images which appeared to show the moment Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by a missile exploding in mid-air. Footage released by the group included a Tor-M1 missile colliding with the Boeing 737-800 involved in the crash, and an extract of CCTV camera footage showing the moment of impact. History In 2014, BBC reported that an Instagram account which shows Tehran's wealthy young elite living like their counterparts in the West had become a sensation in Iran. The article said, \\"If it wasn't for the Farsi number plates, you'd be forgiven for thinking the account belonged to a rich American living in sun- drenched Los Angeles.\\" In October 8, 2014, New York Post reported that the Instagram account of Rich Kids of Tehran had raised eyebrows for many, primarily for its inclusions of alcohol and women without hijabs (the traditional headscarf). Some women appear in short skirts, crop tops and even bikinis. Per Iranian law, women must cover their hair with a headscarf and dress modestly in public, though it‚Äôs unclear if these photos are taken in public or on private property. Alcohol is also forbidden in Iran; however, many elites drink in their own homes. In a post that has since been deleted, the account's creators defended their photos and the idea behind them. According to New York Post, the Rich Kids of Tehran's Instagram account came just months after the Iranian government cracked down on social media use. In May 2014, eight Iranians received a combined 123 years in jail after insulting President Hassan Rouhani on Facebook. In July 2014, another eight Facebook users were sentenced to a combined 127 years in prison for posting propaganda and insults against Islam and further seven Iranian youths were sentenced to jail time and 91 lashes apiece for posting a video of themselves dancing to Pharrell‚Äôs ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù. In an article published by Business Insider in May 2014, it was reported that Instagram's 'Rich Kids Of Tehran' showed the children of Iran's elite flouting sanctions. The article reported that the exhibitions of wealth and sexuality displayed on the page came as a surprise to many both inside and outside Iran, which is subject to strict international sanctions blocking the import of certain luxury goods as well as Islamic laws that prohibit alcohol and immodest dressing. In November 2014, CNN reported that despite the ban, Rich Kids of Tehran continued. CNN called the page a social media phenomenon that has attracted worldwide attention for offering a startling glimpse at the decadent lifestyle of wealthy young Iranians in one of the world's most socially conservative countries. In October 2013, The Independent reported young Iranians who flaunt their luxury lifestyles on social media have started a new account to defend their actions after they were made to shut the original down amid government pressure. Authorities in Iran blocked the ‚ÄúRich Kids of Tehran‚Äù Instagram account on Thursday after flashy images of parties, alcohol and girls wearing bikinis and revealing clothing were featured. In October 2014, HuffPost published an article stating about the page. The article suggested that the subjects of images on the page appeared to have been photographed in private homes and gardens where such rules cannot be enforced. In October 2014, The Times published a reported stating a new Instagram account showcasing the lifestyles of wealthy young Iranians has provoked both amusement and anger in Tehran, lifting the lid on a rarely seen side of the Islamic Republic. In June 2015, Vice News reported that the page had been blocked in Iran such that a VPN was needed to access the page from within Iran. =2018 Iran protests= In 2018, Rich Kids of Tehran was blamed for fueling a series of protests in Iran, which erupted in country-wide demonstrations which brought out crowds both condemning and supporting Iran's government. The demonstrators mobilized against issues including the country's economic woes. Gradually, anti-government protesters across the country turned to the same target: a wealthy elite that has reaped the benefits of a top-down theocratic regime. =Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752= On 9 January 2020, the account was the first source to publish videos and images on their Instagram account which appeared to show the moment Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by a missile exploding in mid-air. Footage released by the group included a Tor-M1 missile colliding with the Boeing 737-800 involved in the crash, and an extract of CCTV camera footage showing the moment of impact. On 14 January 2020, the account published a new video which showed two missiles were being fired by Iran's IRGC. The CCTV footage was verified by The New York Times as showing two missiles fired 30 seconds apart. On January 14, 2020, CNN reported that according to Tasnim News Agency and Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency, Iranian authorities were also attempting to find the people responsible for the distribution of the videos which appeared to show the moment the aircraft was shot down.

It was created under Henry VIII and was expanded and improved under his successors, but lost its royal patronage after the Palace of Whitehall was almost totally destroyed by fire in 1698. From the start of the 18th century onwards, the garden went through major changes as it fell into neglect. It was painted in 1747 by Canaletto during a period of transition, as Westminster was being transformed by the construction of new buildings and roads. By the start of the 19th century it had been redeveloped as the site for a row of townhouses, some of which were occupied by prime ministers seeking homes near the government buildings nearby. The last remnants of the Privy Garden were destroyed in 1938 during the construction of government offices which now house the Ministry of Defence's headquarters building. Origins and layout The Privy Garden originated in the 16th century as part of the estate of York Place; Cardinal Wolsey's London residence. The estate already had a privy, or private, garden that was located behind what is now the Banqueting House. An orchard, which was part of the estate, adjoined it to the south. When Henry VIII seized York Place, he bought more land to the south of the orchard to expand the estate. The old privy garden was cobbled over and later became known as the Pebble Court, while the orchard was converted into a new and much larger Privy Garden, known at first as the \\"great garden\\". At the time, Westminster was not heavily built up as it is now, and York Place ‚Äì later renamed Whitehall Palace ‚Äì lay within a suburban area dominated by parks and gardens. St. James's Park, across the other side of Whitehall, was a royal hunting ground. Henry's garden was very ornately decorated, as 16th-century visitors noted. The Spanish Duke of N√°jera wrote of a visit in 1544 in which he saw \\"a very pleasant garden with great walks and avenues in all directions, containing many sculptures of men and women, children and birds and monsters, and other strange figures in low and high relief.\\" Von Wedel recorded in 1584 that in the garden were \\"thirty-four high columns, covered with various fine paintings; also different animals carved in wood, with their horns gilt, are set on the top of the columns, together with flags bearing the queen's arms. In the middle of the garden is a nice fountain with a remarkable sun-dial, showing the time in thirty different ways. Between the spaces that are planted in the garden there are fine walks grown with grass, and the spaces are planted very artistically, surrounded by plants in the shape of seats.\\"Survey of London vol. XIII, p. 95 Map of the Palace of Whitehall, showing the Privy Garden, dating from 1680 The earliest surviving depiction of the garden, from 1670, shows a very different layout. By this time the garden had been redesigned in a grid pattern with sixteen squares of grass separated by paths. The relentless expansion of the Palace of Whitehall, which was by now a sprawling jumble of structures, had hemmed in the Privy Garden behind walls and buildings on all sides. A high wall to the west separated it from The Street, the main thoroughfare at the south end of Whitehall that bisected the palace in a north-south direction. To the north, a range of buildings occupied by high-ranking courtiers separated it from the Pebble Court that lay behind the Banqueting House, while to the east the Stone Gallery and state apartments, used by the king's closest courtiers, blocked it off from the River Thames. The royal apartments were off the Stone Gallery and had a view of the Privy Garden, with a screen in place to prevent passers-by from seeing the naked king in his bathtub. A row of trees on the south side screened it from the Bowling Green, which had been an orchard in Henry VIII's time but was converted for leisure use after the Restoration. A terrace also separated the Privy Garden from the Bowling Green, but this was removed in 1673‚Äì4 and part of the Bowling Green was added to the garden. The Privy Garden was originally created as a private royal pleasure garden and continued to serve a similar purpose during the Interregnum (1649‚Äì1660), when the English Council of State put considerable effort and money into repairing and improving the garden. They appear to have reserved it exclusively for their own use, with their own individual keys for access. By Samuel Pepys' time, after the Restoration of the monarchy, it had become \\"a through-passage, and common.\\" The wall that enclosed the garden was often used by ballad-sellers to display their wares to passers-by, and courtiers used it to air their laundry. Pepys recorded his titillation at the sight of the underwear of Charles II's mistress, Lady Castlemaine, hanging out to dry in the Privy Garden. A century later, James Boswell wrote in his diary that he had taken a prostitute into the garden and \\"indulged sensuality\\", but he was shocked to find when he got home that she had stolen his handkerchief. Sculptures and other features statue of King James II sculpted by Peter Van Dievoet and Laurence Vandermeulen when it still stood of the grounds of the Whitehall Privy Garden. It now stands in front of the National Galery. For a time, each of the grass squares in the garden had a statue in its centre, standing on its own pedestal. They were probably moved there from St James's Palace in the 1650s but became the target of Puritan zealotry during the Interregnum, due to the perception that they were biblically prohibited \\"graven images\\".Survey of London vol. XIII, p. 90 A woman named Mary Netherway wrote to Oliver Cromwell to demand that they be taken down, demanding that he \\"demolish those monsters which are set up as ornaments in [the] privy garden, for whilst they stand, though you see no evil in them, yet there is much evil in it, for whilst the crosses and altars of the idols remained untaken away in Jerusalem, the wrath of God continued against Israel.\\" One man took more direct action; it was recorded in 1659 that \\"about this time there was a cook that lived by the Palace Gate, Westminster, that in Sermon time went into Whitehall Garden, and with him carried a smith's great hammer; he broke there those goodly statue of brass and marble, which report said they were the neatest made and the best workmanship in Europe, in half an hour's time [he] did above ¬£500 worth of hurt.\\" The statues were eventually taken down when Charles II came to the throne and were either repaired or replaced.

It now occupies a spot in Trafalgar Square outside the National Gallery. Charles II's sundial, installed in the Privy Garden in 1669 A large sundial, set up on the orders of James I, stood in the middle of the garden from 1624. The dial was designed by Edmund Gunter, professor of astronomy at Gresham College. It consisted of a large stone pedestal with four dials at the four corners and \\"the great horizontal concave\\" in the centre, with east, west, north and south dials at the sides. It was subsequently vandalised, allegedly by an intoxicated courtier, and fell into ruin in Charles II's reign. Andrew Marvell lamented that > This place for a dial was too insecure Since a guard and a garden could not > it defend; For so near to the Court they will never endure Any witness to > show how their time they misspend. In 1669 a new King's Sun Dial was erected for Charles II, designed by Father Francis Hall, a Jesuit priest. It was an extremely elaborate construction that Hall detailed in a book, Explication of the Diall, that he published in 1673 to explain how it operated. It stood high and was constructed of stone, brass and wood, with gilded ironwork and painted glass panels to accompany its 270 component dials. It resembled \\"a fountain of glass spheres, or a giant candelabrum with tiered, branching arms ending in crystal globes\\", which showed not only the hours of the day but \\"many things also belonging to geography, astrology, and astronomy, by the sun's shadow made visible to the eye.\\" The King was fascinated by astronomy; his personal association with the science was illustrated by the fact that the sundial was not only his personal pride and joy but was also designed to serve as a symbol of the Stuart family. It had glass portraits mounted on it, depicting Charles, Queen Catherine, the Duke of York, the Queen Mother and Prince Rupert. A watchman was posted to guard it against the kind of vandalism that had wrecked the earlier sundial, but in June 1675 it was severely damaged when it was attacked by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, much to the king's fury. The fate of the ruined dial is unknown; it was last recorded standing at Buckingham House (later Buckingham Palace) in 1710. From Privy Garden to Whitehall Gardens The Privy Garden depicted in 1741 by J. Maurier, looking south from the Banqueting House (visible on the right) After the destruction by fire of the Palace of Whitehall in 1698, the surroundings of the Privy Garden changed dramatically. Most of the palace buildings had been burned down in the 1698 fire; others were torn down as the last vestiges of the old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With the demise of the Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House. The garden remained in Crown ownership but it became neglected and filthy with the departure of the monarchy from Whitehall. In 1733 the Duke of Richmond and other residents of the surviving properties adjoining the garden petitioned that they be allowed to lease the \\"void ground\\" of the garden. The Crown agreed, and in 1734 most of the garden was leased to the Dukes of Richmond and Montagu, the Earl of Loudon and Sir Conyers D'Arcy.Survey of London vol. XIII, p. 96 Canaletto's Whitehall and the Privy Garden from Richmond House, 1747. View looking north towards the Banqueting House When Canaletto painted a view of the garden looking north from the Duke of Richmond's dining room in Richmond House in 1747, it was a last view of a prospect that was soon to disappear with the demolition of the old palace's Holbein Gate adjoining the garden. Parliament Street was driven through the western side of the garden in 1750 to connect Whitehall to the Palace of Westminster. At the start of the 19th century the garden's \\"decayed wall, long fringed by pamphlets, ballads, and ragged advertisements\\" was removed and replaced by an iron railing and newly planted trees. Its north side remained \\"most confused and unpleasant\\", terminating in a maze of \\"fifty narrow passages, formed by sheds, blank walls, the residences of the nobility, and the workshops of the tradesmen.\\" A house in Privy Gardens was occupied by Margaret, Dowager Duchess of Portland. She died on 17th February 1785. Upon her death the contents of the Portland Museum were sold off starting on 24th April 1786 and continued over a 37 day period. This museum is NOT the same as the current Portland Museum (in Portland), this one was in Bulstrode Park and featured the art collection of the Duke and Duchess. The auction was conducted by Mr Skinner and Co, of Aldersgate Street. Lot number 4155 was The Portland Vase. The area was ripe for redevelopment by the landholding elite, who wished to have suitably grand townhouses to occupy while attending Parliament and the court. The vestiges of the Privy Garden became the site of a new street. In 1808 a row of houses called Whitehall Gardens was constructed on the site. Behind each house, long grassy gardens planted with rows of trees led directly down to the river, until they were cut off by the construction of the Victoria Embankment along the river bank between 1865 and 1870. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli lived in one of the houses between 1873 and 1875, while Sir Robert Peel lived in another (and died there in 1850 after falling from his horse on Constitution Hill). The trees outside the front entrance to Whitehall Gardens were the last survivors of the original Privy Garden, and stood until as recently as the late 1930s. Among the houses in Whitehall Gardens were Montagu House and Pembroke House, a Palladian riverside villa with elaborate interiors. The houses were demolished along with the rest of Whitehall Gardens in 1938, in what the architectural historian John Harris described as \\"a monstrous act of vandalism\\", to make way for the construction of the new offices of the Board of Trade and Air Ministry. The interior decorations of four of Pembroke House's rooms were saved after its demolition and were reinstalled in the new government offices, now the Ministry of Defence's Main Building.

They moved to Waymouth Street and by 1877 they had premises at 1‚Äì3 Franklin Street \\"Cawthorne Chambers\\", adjacent to the G.P.O.. In March 1882 the shop started carrying sheet music and violin strings. and a year later materials for amateur dramatics. In 1884 they opened in the new Y.M.C.A. building at Gawler Place, and by 1885 Cawthorne & Co. was acting as a booking agent for concerts. They retained the Franklin Street shop as a branch office until the Cyclorama Building (later West's picture theatre, 91 Hindley Street) opened, and the second shop moved there. Later the Gawler place premises were enlarged considerably and the Hindley street business closed. In 1911 Cawthorne's moved to 17 Rundle Street, but in 1924 those premises were demolished and an up-to-date music warehouse was built. Around this time, three of Charles's four sons ‚Äì Gus, Cyril and Frank ‚Äì became involved in the company. In 1924 a new company, \\"Cawthorne's Limited\\" was formed, with ¬£20,000 capital, to take over the business and assets of Cawthorne & Co. Its first directors were Charles Witto-witto Cawthorne, Augustus Eckersley Cawthorne, Cyril Cawthorne, Frank Roy Cawthorne and William Miller. Family members =William Anderson Cawthorne= William Anderson Cawthorne (25 September 1825 ‚Äì 25 September 1897), often referred to as W.A. Cawthorne, was an artist and teacher. He arrived in South Australia with his mother on the Amelia , which sailed from Liverpool via Cape Town, in 1841. His father, lighthouse keeper Captain William Cook Cawthorne, arrived on 22 April 1845 aboard the Victoria, from Western Australia. By 1851 W. A. Cawthorne had with his mother founded a school on Morphett Street, but the following year was appointed headmaster of Pulteney Street Central Schools, then Victoria Square School in November 1856. He was interested in Australian Aboriginal culture and made useful observations of Kaurna language and the people's customs. His interest is reflected in the middle names he gave some of his children. He wrote The Islanders (1854), a fictional account based on the early history of settlement on Kangaroo Island; Kupirri; or, the Red Kangaroo (1858), a reader for children; and a biography of Johann Menge (1859). He was a frequent visitor to the mission, school and camp at Piltawodli, was a close friend of Kadlitpina (\\"Captain Jack\\"), loved the Kaurna Palti \\"corroboree\\" and their material culture, and was responsible for recording many names of artefacts. His Rough Notes on the Manners and Customs of the Natives, written in 1844, was published in the 1925-26 Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia (SA Branch). He was founding secretary of the Schoolmasters' Association. He was member of the Volunteer Military Force until 1863 when, as Captain of the West Adelaide Rifle Company, he resigned in protest at the Government's refusal to allow evening parades. In 1865 he stood for City councillor, Grey ward but was defeated. He was later successful and served from 1871 to 1873. He was secretary of the National Building Society from 1863 to 1892. The \\"Victoria Square Academy Est. 1841\\" closed in December 1864. He then advertised himself as a telegraphic agent, and began stocking the Illustrated Melbourne Post, later the Australian Journal and other interstate and overseas magazines at business premises in Morphett Street. William Cawthorne published the Illustrated Adelaide News from 1867 until the end of 1874, and published an Adelaide edition of the Australasian Sketcher from 1875 until 1885. =Charles Cawthorne= Charles Witto-witto Cawthorne (1 July 1854 ‚Äì 26 June 1925) was with his father W. A. Cawthorne, founder of Cawthorne & Co. as a business involved in every aspect of music-making, and chairman of directors when the company became Cawthorne's Pty Ltd. =Gus Cawthorne= Augustus Eckersley \\"Gus\\" Cawthorne (29 April 1887 ‚Äì 15 July 1937) was the eldest son of Charles Cawthorne, born in Adelaide. He was, with brothers Cyril and Frank, on the board of Cawthorne and Co., serving as managing director. Like his father, he was a prominent supporter of amateur theatre and music performance. He was a keen supporter of the brass band movement, and held office in several bands, and was also a vice-president of the Unley Orchestra. He and A. J. Chapman (of Allan's Ltd., Cawthorne's chief competitor) founded the Dame Nellie Melba Memorial Fund, and Gus served as house manager for S. Talbot Smith's Repertory Theatre. =Genealogy= Captain William Cook Cawthorne (1799 ‚Äì 28 September 1875) married Georgina Sarah (1802 ‚Äì 14 June 1860). He was not on the same ship as his wife and son, Amelia, which arrived at Adelaide 1841, but in 1845 was recorded as arriving from the Swan River aboard Victoria. He was from 1851 to 1861 the (first) Head Keeper of the \\"Sturt\\" lighthouse on Cape Willoughby on Kangaroo Island. This reference has his name \\"N. C. Cawthorne\\", and puts his death as 27 September 1897. He married again, to Margaret Grant in 1862. They lived at Brighton.

Note: this is an enlargement of the previous image of Burton Crater from the table. Burton is an impact crater in the Memnonia quadrangle of Mars, located at 13.9¬∞S latitude and 156.3¬∞W longitude. It is 123.0 km in diameter and was named after British astronomer Charles E. Burton; the name was approved in 1973. It has a central peak. Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/ The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Dark Slope Streaks  Many places on Mars show dark streaks on steep slopes like crater walls. It seems that the youngest streaks are dark; they become lighter with age. Often they begin as a small narrow spot then widen and extend downhill for hundreds of meters. They have been seen to travel around obstacles, like boulders.http://www.space.com/image_of_day_080730.html Several ideas have been advanced to explain the streaks. Some involve water or even the growth of organisms.http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/streaks_mars_streaks_030328.htmlhttp://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars_http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/streaks_mars_021200.html It is most generally accepted that they represent avalanches of dust. The streaks appear in areas covered with dust. When a thin layer of dust is removed, the underlying surface is dark. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust. Fine dust settles out of the atmosphere covering everything. A topographic map showing the central peak. Dark streaks can be seen in the image to the right of Burton Crater that was taken by CTX.
