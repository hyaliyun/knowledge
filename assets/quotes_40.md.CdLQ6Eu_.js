It was created in 2000, mostly from the former security buffer surrounding the Hanford Nuclear Reservation (Hanford Site). The area has been untouched by development or agriculture since 1943. Because of that it is considered an involuntary park. The monument is named after the Hanford Reach, the last non-tidal, free-flowing section of the Columbia River in the United States, and is one of eight National Monuments administered by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service; part of the monument within the Hanford Site is also managed by the Department of Energy. President Bill Clinton established the monument by presidential decree in 2000. In May 2017, the Interior Department announced that Hanford Reach was one of 27 National Monuments under review for possible rescinding of their designation.Dept. of Interior press release Ancestors of the Wanapum People, Yakama Nation, Confederated Tribes of the Colville, Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation and the Nez Perce used the land for hunting and resource collecting. Geographically, the area is part of the Columbia River Plateau, formed by basalt lava flows and water erosion. The shrub-steppe landscape is harsh and dry, receiving between 5 and of rain per year. The sagebrush- bitterbrush-bunchgrass lands are home to a wide variety of plants and animals, and the Hanford Reach provides one of the Northwest's best salmon spawning grounds. Forty-eight rare, threatened, or endangered animal species have found refuge on the monument, as well as several insect species found nowhere else in the world. Fish and wildlife There are two main habitats in the Hanford Reach National Monument: desert and river. Islands, riffles, gravel bars, oxbow ponds and backwater sloughs provide support to forty-three species of fish. Large numbers of fall Chinook salmon spawn in the Hanford reach. Federally threatened species such as the Upper Columbia River Spring Chinook, the Middle Columbia River Steelhead and the Upper Columbia River Steelhead use the reach for migration purposes. The refuge is famous for the elk located on the Arid Lands Ecology Area. Herd numbers vary by time of year with 150 seen during the spring/summer and 350 to 375 during the fall. The elk population reaches its peak in the winter with an average of 670. Archaeologists believed the elk had been in the region for the last 10,000 years. During the mid-19th century, first hand accounts mentioned the disappearance of the species. Rocky Mountain elk were reintroduced into the region during the 1930s, as well as a natural recolonization event from the nearby cascade mountains during the difficult 1978 winter. The dry, desert region is home to forty-two mammal species. Mice are the most abundant and include the deer mouse, western harvest mouse, northern grasshopper mouse. Mammals that inhabit this refuge include coyotes, skunks, beavers, mule deer, bobcats, river otters, minks, cougars and badgers. Hanford Nuclear Reservation Hanford Reach is home to nine nuclear reactors of which B Reactor is the most famous; constructed in 13 months during World War II, it was the world‚Äôs first full scale reactor. Plutonium from the reactor was used in the first nuclear explosion at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range in New Mexico (July 16, 1945) and in the Fat Man atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan (August 9, 1945). The reactor‚Äôs significance has led to many distinctions including a place on the National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark, National Register of Historic Places, Nuclear Historic Landmark, National Civil Engineering Landmark and National Historic Landmark.

The Rattlesnake Mountain Public Access Act () is a bill that has been introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress which would change some of the access to this site. The bill would require the United States Secretary of the Interior to provide public access to the summit of Rattlesnake Mountain in the Hanford Reach National Monument in the state of Washington. The bill is supposed to help with tourism and scientific undertakings. It passed the House on June 11, 2013 and was sent to the Senate. Several sites in the adjacent Hanford Site including the B Reactor are part of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park and are accessible on public tours.

It was founded in 1905 and is the oldest private school in Iceland. The school is located in Reykjav√≠k and has more than 900 students. The gymnasium serves the whole of Iceland and has a student population of just below one thousand. It is organised on the basis of a form system, all students in the same form having the same timetable. Students are in school full-time from 8:15 ‚Äì 15:40, Monday - Friday. The school year consists of two semesters, fall and spring. Each semester students take a full-time load of courses worth two or three credits each. Over three years, they take a total of 140+ credits and matriculate with an Icelandic st√∫dentspr√≥f which is the standard prerequisite for university admission in Iceland. This qualification is also accepted for admission to universities around the world. In their first year all students follow a common curriculum. They then opt to specialise in one of four streams: business, science, social science or languages. However, in all streams during the first two years there is a strong focus on practical business courses like accounting, economics and computer studies. These courses qualify students for the Commercial Diploma (‚ÄòVerzlunarpr√≥f') at the end of their second year. In terms of the students' age and academic standard, the Commercial Diploma corresponds roughly to A-levels in the United Kingdom and the High School Diploma in the United States. During the remaining two years of their three-year programme, students complete their st√∫dentspr√≥f. These two years could be considered comparable to two years of study at an academic college, for example equivalent to two years of university- level foundation courses in an American junior college. History Verzl√≥ was founded in 1905 by the Store and Office Workers' Union and the Retailers' Association in Reykjavik. Since 1922 it has operated under the aegis of the Iceland Chamber of Commerce. The original objective was to give young people the opportunity of a basic commercial education. The school has steadily grown and developed since its inception. In 1996 the course offering was revised, leading to a reorganisation of the streaming system and an increase in the number of courses offered. The revised streaming system was implemented in the fall of 1997. Verzl√≥ is a non-profit organisation operating under Charter No. 272/ 15 June 1993. According to this charter the main objectives of the college are to promote the competitiveness of Icelandic industry, both internally and internationally, by providing and furthering education in general and business education at secondary and tertiary levels in particular. Events One day in October each year, the students of Verzl√≥ and its rival school, Menntask√≥linn √≠ Reykjav√≠k meet in the Hlj√≥msk√°lagar√∞ur park in down- town Reykjav√≠k, where various games and competitions are held. These include: sprinting, soccer, rowing, giant-chess (later replaced with ordinary chess), screaming, tug-o-war, competitive eating, arm wrestling, car stuffing and Mexican-run. The night of that day, a debating competition between the two schools is held.

As a cyclist, he competed in the first two R√°s Tailteann races, and represented Ireland internationally. In 1954 he was imprisoned after an IRA raid on a British Army barracks in Northern Ireland, and the following year he was elected to the British parliament as the Sinn F√©in MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone; as he was imprisoned, his election was overturned on petition. He was released from prison in 1958, after which he broke his ties with the IRA. In later life, he worked for the Irish Management Institute and as an independent business consultant Early life Clarke was born in Long Island, New York, and moved with his family to Dublin in 1936. He joined the Irish civil service in 1950, and joined the Irish Republican Army shortly afterwards. In October 1954, he was arrested and imprisoned after an attempted IRA raid on a British Army barracks in Omagh, County Tyrone. He was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Sporting career Clarke was a member of the James' Gate Cycling Club, a Dublin club affiliated to the nationalist- leaning National Cycling Association. (At the time, Irish cycling was split between the NCA, which asserted its right to represent all of Ireland, and the Cumann Rothaiochta na h√âireann, which limited its scope to the Republic of Ireland.) He represented Ireland internationally, though due to the lack of international recognition of the NCA, his opportunities here were limited.\\"Phil Clarke - An Appreciation\\". Fermanagh Herald, 23 August 1995 He competed in the R√°s Tailteann races in 1953 and 1954. During his imprisonment, in 1955‚Äì58, he was acknowledged as competitor #1 \\"who will not be riding\\". In 1953, he and his friend Colm Christle had cycled through France and Switzerland to Italy to watch the UCI Road World Championship, and in later years he visited Europe every year to see the Tour de France or another major race. Political career In the 1955 UK General Election, Clarke was elected MP for the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, winning 30,529 votes, and becoming the youngest MP at the time. As Clarke was in prison at the time of his election, serving ten years for a treason felony, his opponent, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Grosvenor, lodged a petition to have him unseated.\\"Move to unseat M.P.\\", The Times, 7 June 1955, p. 3.

On 2 September, the court ruled that Clarke was ineligible for election and his Unionist opponent was declared duly elected.\\"Imprisoned Man Not An M.P.\\", The Times, 3 September 1955, p. 4. Subsequent life When the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland issued an explicit condemnation of IRA violence in January 1956, Clarke severed his connections with the IRA. He petitioned for remission of his sentence in 1958, and was released from jail on 18 December 1958 after the Governor of Northern Ireland Lord Wakehurst exercised his prerogative of mercy.\\"Barracks Raid Men Freed\\", The Times, 19 December 1958, p. 5. He had been suggested by Sinn F√©in as a candidate for Dublin South West in the 1957 Irish general election, but resisted due to disagreement with party policy. He rejoined the Civil Service, and later took up a post as a lecturer at the Irish Management Institute. He married in April 1960. At the Irish Management Institute, he rose to become an executive director, but fell out with the Institute after a change of policy in the 1970s.

Its area became the south-west of the London Borough of Hillingdon. Establishment and expansion The Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District evolved from the Yiewsley Urban District which had been established on 14 April 1911 by an Order of the Middlesex County Council granting the Civil Parish of Yiewsley urban powers. Historically Yiewsley had been a district in the Parish of Hillingdon and became part of the Parish of Hillingdon East when the Hillingdon Parish was divided under the Local Government Act of 1894, also becoming part of the new Uxbridge Rural District. Yiewsley became a Civil Parish in 1896, remaining in the Uxbridge Rural District until becoming an Urban District in 1911. On 7 December 1928 Middlesex County Council issued an Order for the Uxbridge Rural District to be amalgamated into the Uxbridge Urban District, with the exception of the Parish of Northolt and the Parish of West Drayton. The Parish of West Drayton was to be transferred to the Urban District of Yiewsley with the Urban District being renamed Yiewsley and West Drayton. The Urban District Council was to increase in size to have 15 members, 9 representing the Yiewsley Ward and 6 representing the West Drayton Ward. The Order was to come into force on 31 March 1929. Elections for the Council took place on Saturday 23 March 1929 and the first meeting of the new Council members was held on Wednesday 3 April 1929. Key House, Town Hall of the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District between 1930 and 1952 On 31 March 1930 an Order of the Middlesex County Council dissolved the Staines Rural District with the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District amalgamating the Parish of Harmondsworth which included the villages of Longford, Sipson and Heathrow. The composition of the Urban Council was changed with the number of Ward members increased to 22. Yiewsley Ward members were increased to 12, West Drayton Ward members reduced to 5 and Harmondsworth Ward members having also 5 (In line with the estimated population of each Ward: Yiewsley 6,134 - West Drayton 2,499 - Harmondsworth 2,600). Urban District elections took place on Saturday 22 March 1930 with the new Ward members attending their first meeting of the Urban District Council on Tuesday 1 April 1930. On Friday 23 May 1930 the Urban District's new Town Hall in Yiewsley was officially opened by Mr. F. E. Dominey, J.P., the Chairman of the Council. After the Second World War the Town Hall became too small to meet the needs of the Urban District. Drayton Hall in West Drayton was purchased with the official opening taking place on 5 April 1952. The building was extended in 1955. Drayton Hall, Town Hall of the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District between 1952 and 1965 Abolition The Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District, with the whole County of Middlesex, formed part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. Its report published in 1960, proposed 52 Greater London Boroughs with one being formed from the Municipal Borough of Uxbridge, the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District and the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District. The UK Government produced a White paper on 29 November 1961 which proposed fewer, larger boroughs. With the introduction of legislation in 1962 the number of boroughs had been reduced to 32 with the Hayes and Harlington Urban District joining the three other administrative areas in forming a new borough. The London Government Act 1963 created the London Borough of Hillingdon in the new county of Greater London on 1 April 1965. Civic history=Coat of arms The coat of arms of Yiewsley and West Drayton, which included Heathrow Airport, was granted in 1953 shortly before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It was: The coat of arms of the London Borough of Hillingdon replicated in its logo re-uses splayed eagle wings, the Tudor rose and the main feature of its crest above is a red demi-lion with silver/white wings whose undersides (one visible as the lion is side-on) have the red cross of St George.

It was designed and programmed by Pete Cooke. It was groundbreaking at the time for its extensive use of 3D graphics, shadow effects and its large gameworld set on a small planet, Tau Ceti III, orbiting the titular star. The planet also has a realistic day and night cycle (much shorter than our own). An enhanced version (known as Tau Ceti - The Special Edition) was released for the 128K Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in 1987 featuring extra graphics and a large amount of accessible library data about the gameworld and the game. A sequel, Academy, was released in 1986. Origins and development The origins of Tau Ceti and its game engine came from Cooke attempting to work out how the spheres in the game Gyron, released by Firebird Software for the ZX Spectrum in 1985, had been created: Having created the basics of a game engine, Cooke had to decide on a scenario for his new game: Cooke was also inspired when writing Tau Ceti by the works of the science-fiction writer Larry Niven and the space-simulator Elite. Plot Humanity has spread out and colonised nearby star systems but a plague in 2150 led to the colonies being abandoned and left to their automated robotic maintenance systems. While several of these colonies have been successfully re-inhabited, the colony on the planet Tau Ceti III (orbiting the star Tau Ceti) has been uncontactable since a meteor smashed into the planet. A mission sent to Tau Ceti III in 2164 landed on the planet but broadcast a mayday message followed by silence. Experts decided that the planet's robots were running amok as a result of the meteorite impact. The only chance, it was decided, of successfully stopping the defence systems without destroying the cities already there is to send a single pilot in an armoured Gal-Corp skimmer to the planet's surface with the task of shutting down the central reactor in Tau Ceti III's capital, Centralis. Gameplay Typical gameplay in Tau Ceti, taken from the Atari ST version. The planet Tau Ceti III consists of several cities which themselves consist of clusters of buildings with their defensive laser towers and patrolling robot Hunter ships. The player's skimmer can dock with some of these buildings and find parts needed to help shut down the central reactor as well as refuel and find vital information. The cities themselves can be travelled to by means of a \\"jump pad\\" which makes the long trips between them much quicker. When taking the long trip between cities, a bug in the Amstrad CPC version meant players stayed in the same city when next using a jump pad. This can be used as an advantageous way of returning quickly to the center of the map, without traveling back through every city. This also allowed the player to jump to non-existent cities off the map. The gameworld is displayed in a 3D view from the skimmer. As well as displaying these 3D graphics, Cooke's game engine renders them with simple shadows in order to simulate the day and night cycle of Tau Ceti III. These days are much shorter than Earth's consisting of one spin of the planet per hour with sixteen \\"spins\\" to a Centaurian day. The cities of Tau Ceti III are extremely hostile places as they are full of robot defences. These consist of laser towers, Fortresses (which are essentially better-armoured Towers), Hunter ships (of which there are three types: Mark I, Mark II and Mark III), and slowly moving mines. To defend itself against these, the skimmer is armed with lasers, missiles, and AMMs (to destroy missiles fired by robot Hunters). The skimmer also has a shield although its power is limited and if the shield is badly depleted or exhausted, the skimmer will take damage and some of its systems will fail. They can be repaired at any supply centre. Any static defences (e.g. buildings) which are destroyed are permanently destroyed. Any mobile defences (Hunters, droids, etc.) are renewed when the player leaves a city; so cities are never fully cleared. Cities vary greatly in their defences; a few cities are almost undefended (just minefields), a few cities are very very intensely defended (e.g. Centralis, where the main reactor is). The skimmer is also fitted with a scanner in order to detect buildings or Hunters not in its forward view or at a distance, and a compass to aid navigation. To cope with Tau Ceti III's frequent hours of darkness, the skimmer has an infra-red display mode and also carries a limited number of short-lived flares. Although Tau Ceti is primarily an action game, it has some text-input sections when the skimmer docks or lands on the planet's surface. When this happens, the player can communicate with the skimmer using simple commands such as \\"HELP\\", \\"STATUS\\" or \\"SCORE\\" to get access to game information. If docked with a building, \\"LOOK\\" will display a picture of the inside of the building and \\"EQUIP\\" will allow access to anything useful in that building. As with some other Cooke games, the game also has an inbuilt note-taking system (accessed via the command \\"PAD\\") to take notes without using pen and paper. Reactor rods In order to shut down the central reactor, the main objective of the game, the player must first locate the forty pieces of the reactor cooling rods and assemble them into twenty complete rods which can then be inserted into the reactor to shut it down. The assembly of the rods is achieved by using the command \\"RODS\\" which displays a screen showing found rod-pieces which can then be assembled in a manner similar to a simple jigsaw puzzle. Critical response Response from the gaming media was very positive. CRASH, a Spectrum gaming magazine, summed Tau Ceti up in 1985 as \\"an excellent game, combining several elements with stunning graphics\\" and gave it an overall rating of 94%. Another Spectrum magazine, Sinclair User, gave it a 5 star rating and declared \\"It's hard to imagine a better space game, unless one's talking about Elite, with its intergalactic scope and strategic depth. Viewed as a shoot 'em up with a purpose to the carnage, Tau Ceti has to be one of the all-time greats.\\" Commodore User magazine provoked controversy in their tips page for the Commodore 64 version of the game, when they announced that the final two reactor parts necessary could never be made to fit, and that it was impossible to complete the game Tau Ceti \\"Play to Win\\", Commodore User issue 35, page 73 which is contradicted on the C64-Wiki Tau Ceti page Tau Ceti - C64-Wiki - Tips.

The transformation mapping method is applied to exhibit distinct boundaries between incoming and outgoing data. The data flow diagrams allocate control input, processing and output along three separate modules. #The interface design describes internal and external program interfaces, as well as the design of the human interface. Internal and external interface designs are based on the information obtained from the analysis model. #The procedural design describes structured programming concepts using graphical, tabular and textual notations. These design mediums enable the designer to represent procedural detail, that facilitates translation to code. This blueprint for implementation forms the basis for all subsequent software engineering work.  IEEE 1016  IEEE 1016-2009, titled IEEE Standard for Information Technology‚ÄîSystems Design‚ÄîSoftware Design Descriptions, is an IEEE standard that specifies \\"the required information content and organization\\" for an SDD.IEEE 1016, Abstract. IEEE 1016 does not specify the medium of an SDD; it is \\"applicable to automated databases and design description languages but can be used for paper documents and other means of descriptions.\\"IEEE 1016, Abstract. The 2009 edition was a major revision to IEEE 1016-1998, elevating it from recommended practice to full standard. This revision was modeled after IEEE Std 1471-2000, Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software-intensive Systems, extending the concepts of view, viewpoint, stakeholder, and concern from architecture description to support documentation of high-level and detailed design and construction of software. [IEEE 1016, Introduction] Following the IEEE 1016 conceptual model, an SDD is organized into one or more design views. Each design view follows the conventions of its design viewpoint. IEEE 1016 defines the following design viewpoints for use:IEEE 1016, Clause 5. *Context viewpoint *Composition viewpoint *Logical viewpoint *Dependency viewpoint *Information viewpoint *Patterns use viewpoint *Interface viewpoint *Structure viewpoint *Interaction viewpoint *State dynamics viewpoint *Algorithm viewpoint *Resource viewpoint In addition, users of the standard are not limited to these viewpoints but may define their own.IEEE 1016, sub-clause 4.5.

At that election, Sinn F√©in candidate Tom Mitchell took the seat. In the by-election, Mitchell managed to retain the seat with an increase in the number of votes. In the aftermath of the election, the defeated Unionist candidate successfully lodged a petition to have Mitchell, a convicted felon, removed as Member of Parliament (MP). The seat was subsequently given to Charles Beattie. However, as Beattie was at the time of his appointment a member of an appeals tribunal, considered \\"offices of profit under the Crown\\", the British House of Commons ruled that this disqualified him from the office of MP.

Evans is the co-founder of both The Oaktree Foundation and Global Citizen, a Global Poverty Project. He has received domestic and international accolades for his work in promoting youth advocacy and volunteerism in order to reduce extreme poverty in developing countries. Background Evans grew up in Kew, in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne and was educated at Carey Baptist Grammar School where, aged 12 years, he participated in World Vision's 40-hour famine out of a concern for poverty in developing countries. The following year, Evans subsequently won a World Vision-sponsored contest to visit development programs in The Philippines and was moved by his encounters in the slums of Manila. Evans went on exchange to Woodstock School in the Himalayas in India two years later. Recalling his experience from notes in his memoir at the time of his return: > The greatest injustice I witnessed this year happened, not when comparing > the poor of India to the rich of India, but upon arriving home. I couldn't > understand why we as Australians are so determined, even to the point of > complaining, to get the latest mobile phone ‚Ä¶ then comparing this to walking > through the market of India and seeing a man with no legs, simply a piece of > rubber tied to his waist to stop the skin on his pelvis from scraping away ‚Ä¶ > all he asks for is the equivalent of 20 cents. A further trip to the rural valley communities of the KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa, where he volunteered as a youth ambassador with World Vision, saw him return to Melbourne in 2003 moved to bring about social change. In 2008, Evans graduated with law and science degrees at Monash University. Youth advocacy=Oaktree Foundation In 2003 Evans, together with Nicolas Mackay established The Oaktree Foundation, an Australian-based non- government organisation that provides aid and development to countries in need across the Asia Pacific and African regions. Oaktree is run by young people aged 16 to 26, overseen by an advisory board, and has since grown into an effective vehicle for youth advocacy in Australia providing for education in developing countries. Evans was the inaugural chief executive officer, standing down in 2008, and continues with The Oaktree Foundation in an advisory capacity. Evans' early inspiration and support of The Oaktree Foundation was provided by St Hilary's, a large evangelical Anglican parish in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The Global Poverty Project Inspired by Al Gore's successful film An Inconvenient Truth, Evans and Simon Moss established the Global Poverty Project, a community education group that aims to increase awareness of, and action towards fighting extreme poverty. The Global Poverty Project was started in 2008 with a 60,000 grant from the United Nations and an A$350,000 grant from AusAID. Included in Evans' activism for the Global Poverty Project is the Make Poverty History campaign and concerts in Australia. Awards and other leadership roles In 2001, Evans was one of sixteen Australian representatives to participate in The Hague International Model United Nations (THIMUN) held in The Hague, Netherlands; and in 2003, he was awarded the Young Victorian of the Year. The following year, Evans was named as the Young Australian of the Year for his contribution in promoting youth advocacy through the founding of The Oaktree Foundation. In 2004 Evans was also awarded the title of an Outstanding Young Persons of the World, one of ten young people recognised annually by the Junior Chamber International. Evans award for humanitarianism and/or voluntary leadership in that year was shared with Queen Rania of Jordan and Ch'ng Joo Beng of Malaysia. In 2008, Evans, together with the federal Minister for Youth, Kate Ellis MP, served as co-chair of the 2020 Youth Summit, a precursor to the 2020 Summit.

Development=Under Sikorsky Helicopter N6962R \\"Olga\\" lifting part of the CN Tower antenna in Toronto, March 1975 Skycrane \\"Olga\\" lifting a CN Tower antenna segment The Sikorsky S-64 was designed as an enlarged version of the prototype flying crane helicopter, the Sikorsky S-60. The S-64 had a six-blade main rotor and was powered by two Pratt & Whitney JFTD12A turboshaft engines. The prototype S-64 first flew on 9 May 1962 and was followed by two further examples for evaluation by the German armed forces. The Germans did not place an order, but the United States Army placed an initial order for six S-64A helicopters (with the designation YCH-54A Tarhe). Seven S-64E variants were built by Sikorsky for the civil market. In March 1975, a Skycrane was used to lift sections of the uppermost antenna structure of the CN Tower in Toronto, Canada. Under Erickson Originally a Sikorsky Aircraft product, the type certificate and manufacturing rights were purchased from them by Erickson Air- Crane in 1992. Since that time, Erickson Air-Crane has become the manufacturer and world's largest operator of S-64 Aircranes and has made over 1,350 changes to the airframe, instrumentation, and payload capabilities of the helicopter. The Aircrane can be fitted with a fixed retardant tank to assist in the control of bush fires, and it has proven itself admirably in this role. The helicopter is capable of refilling its entire tank of water in 45 seconds from a water slide thick. S-64 Aircranes have been sold to the Italian and Korean Forest Services for fire suppression and emergency response duties. Those in the Erickson Air-Crane fleet are leased worldwide to organizations, companies, and Federal Government agencies for either short-term or longer term use in fire suppression, civil protection, heavy lift construction, and timber harvesting. Erickson is manufacturing new S-64s, as well as remanufacturing existing CH-54s. Erickson gives each of its S-64s an individual name, the best-known being \\"Elvis\\", used in fighting fires in Australia alongside \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" and \\"Isabelle\\". Other operators, such as Siller Brothers, have followed with their Sikorsky S-64E, Andy's Pride.

Several of his books and short stories have been turned into movies and TV series in Brazil. Ribeiro was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, being elected in 1994. At the time of his death many considered him to be Brazil's greatest contemporary novelist. Biography Ribeiro was the first of three children of Manoel Ribeiro and Maria Felipa Os√≥rio Pimental. When Ribeiro was two months old, the family moved to Aracaju, in the northeastern state of Sergipe. Early on, he showed an interest in literature. In 1955, he began attending the Col√©gio da Bahia, along with Glauber Rocha, with whom he became friends in 1956. In 1957, Ribeiro began working for local newspapers as a journalist. The following year, he entered the Federal University of Bahia to study law. During this time, he published several magazines and journals with Rocha. In 1959, his anthology of stories from Bahia, Lugar e circunstancia (Place and Circumstance), was published. He married his first wife, Maria Beatriz Moreira Caldas, a fellow student, in 1960. They divorced nine years later. In 1963, he wrote his first novel, Setembro n√£o faz sentido. In 1964, Ribeiro left the country for political reasons and went to the United States to study economics, returning the following year to lecture in political science at the Universidade Federal da Bahia. After six years, he was back on his academic career and returned to journalism. In 1969, he married the historian Monica Maria Roters, with whom he had two daughters: Emilia (born 1970) and Manuela (born 1972). In 1971, his breakthrough novel Sargento Get√∫lio was published, followed three years later by Vencecavalo e o outro povo. In 1980, Ribeiro had his third marriage with Berenice Batella, with whom he had two children, Bento (born 1981) and Francisca (born 1983). In 1981, he took his family to Lisbon so he could write for the magazine Caretta. From his return to Brazil until his death, he lived in Rio de Janeiro. Riberiro lived in Berlin between 1990/91 as a participant of the Berlin Artists Program of the German Academic Exchange Service (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, or DAAD). He wrote several newspaper articles, some of which recounted his experiences in the city and which later formed the basis of his book Um brasileiro em Berlim (A Brazilian in Berlin). In 1994, Ribeiro was inducted to the Academia Brasileira de Letras (Brazilian Academy of Letters), occupying seat 34.

Life A caricature of Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, who is depicted between a boy and Dr. Semana (Dr. Week), the mascot of Semana Illustrada (Illustrated Week) magazine Joaquim Manuel de Macedo was born in the city of Itabora√≠, in 1820, to Severino de Macedo Carvalho and Benigna Catarina da Concei√ß√£o. He graduated in Medicine in 1844, and started to practice it in the inlands of Rio. In the same year, he published his romance A Moreninha. In 1849, he founded the magazine Guanabara, along with Manuel de Ara√∫jo Porto-Alegre and Gon√ßalves Dias. In this magazine, many parts of his lengthy poem A Nebulosa were published. Returning to Rio, he abandoned Medicine and became a teacher of History and Geography at the Col√©gio Pedro II. He was very linked to the Brazilian Imperial Family, even becoming a tutor for Princess Isabel's children. He was also a provincial deputy and a general deputy, and a member of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute. During his last years of life, he suffered mental disturbances.

The player is tasked with using two colored arrows, Libble and Rabble, to wrap them around pegs and surround small creatures known as Mushlins to \\"harvest\\" them under a time limit. The player can also uncover treasure chests that will have the player searching the stage for items in order to access a special bonus stage. It ran on the Namco Libble Rabble hardware, one of the only games to do so. Described by Namco as a \\"bashishi game\\", it was designed by Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani and composed by Nobuyuki Ohnogi. Iwatani came up with the idea for the game after an experience at a crowded disco hall, where he envisoned himself tying up people with ropes and throwing them out of the way. It was also inspired by a game he played during his childhood, where the objective was to tie ropes to short metal poles on the ground. The game was known as Potato in early development as Namco considered making the game a tie-in with a potato chip manufacturer in Japan, however these plans later fell through. Iwatani soon passed off development to Makoto Sato due to being overwhelmed with other projects, who added additional ideas such as treasure chests as he felt the game was too simplistic. A North American release was planned by Midway Games but later cancelled. In Japan, Libble Rabble was praised for its unique gameplay and colorful visuals. Retrospectively, it has been praised for its bizarre yet interesting premise and addictiveness, some labeling it as one of the most underappreciated games in Namco's arcade catalog. A Super Famicom version was released in 1994, followed by home ports for both the FM Towns Marty and Sharp X68000 ‚Äî the Super Famicom release included a special cover slip for the d-pad to recreate the original game's twin-stick gameplay. It was digitally re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2009. Gameplay Arcade screenshot At first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two \\"arrows\\", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a \\"season\\" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins. Along the way, various enemies will appear and try to stop the player. The most common are four little hooded critters (Hobblins), which start each season in the corners. If the player catches them in a loop, they will be sent to the top of the screen for a short period of time. Other critters such as fireballs (Killers), sparks (Changers), and Demons will also appear. These can be killed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies (Shears) appear, and if they cross the player's line, they cut it. If the player's line is ever cut by Shears or Demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows. Every so often when the player closes a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area he or she has closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, the player must surround a small enough area which covers just the chest, and no other possible hiding places. The game guides the player along that step, first by challenging him or her to uncover a chest at the start of the game (and then by revealing the locations of the chests for the first two seasons). When the player actually uncovers a chest, six bonus creatures (Topcups) will pop out, then make for the edges. The player must corral them with his or her line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If the player manages to complete a bonus word, the season is automatically cleared out and the player moves to a bonus stage where he or she must try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, the player needs to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit. The player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or she runs out of time (the border is the player's timer, and he or she can boost the time by looping Mushlins and plants), and the player gains an extra life at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points by default. After the 100th season, the season counter will stop at 99, similar to how Galaxian and King & Balloons round indicators would stop after 48 rounds. Development Libble Rabble was designed by Toru Iwatani, best known for creating the arcade game Pac-Man. Iwatani conceptualized the game based on an experience he had in a crowded disco hall in the early 1980s, where he envisioned himself using ropes to tie people up and throwing them out of the way. It was also inspired by a game that he played during his childhood, which involved tying ropes around short metal poles stuck in the ground. Early versions of the game were known as Potato due to Namco considering the game be a tie-in with a Japanese potato chip manufacturer, however these plans fell short as the company was unable to get the license. Due to the game's size and graphical effects, a new arcade board named the Namco Libble Rabble was created to fulfill these conditions, designed by hardware engineer Toru Ogawa. Midway through development, Iwatani soon grew overwhelmed with other projects, passing duties off to designer Makoto Sato. After seeing the prototype build, Sato found the game to be too simplistic and decided to incorporate new ideas to try and add a layer of strategy to it. One of these was the concept for treasure chests and uncovering them, an idea influenced by the Apple II role-playing game Wizardry. Music was composed by Nobuyuki Ohnogi. Namco designer Kazuo Kurosu, known for his work on Rally-X and Bosconian, showed disappointment towards Sato's ideas and found them to make the game less appealing, however time constraints forced the game to be released in its initial state. Libble Rabble was officially released in Japan in October 1983. It was described by Namco as a \\"bashihi\\" game, a word derived from the player's arrows surrounding an object. Namco presented the game to North American distributor Midway Games for a possible release in the United States, however executives were lukewarm towards it and declined. A home conversion was released for the Sharp X68000 in 1993, nearly twelve years after its original arcade release. It was then followed by versions for the Super Famicom and FM Towns Marty in 1994 ‚Äî the former of which includes a special D-Pad cover that can be placed over the buttons to recreate the game's twin-stick control layout. A PC version, developed by Japanese company MediaKite, was released in 1997 and later included in the 1998 arcade game compilation Namco Collection Vol. 2. It was digitally re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2009. The soundtrack was released for iTunes in 2011, released under the Namco Sounds label. Reception Libble Rabble was a successful game in Japan. Game Machine listed the game on their January 15, 1984 issue as being the second most-successful new table arcade unit of the year. Japanese publication Amusement Life applauded its unique twin-stick controls and interesting gameplay, saying that it made it stick out from other games in arcades at the time. Reviewing the Super Famicom home conversion, Video Games magazine referred to it as a \\"politically-correct Super Bomberman\\", noting of its unique yet strange premise. In a retrospective review, Retro Gamer magazine stated it was a \\"true, underappreciated classic\\" of the puzzle game genre, favorably comparing it to Taito's Qix. Ports Over a decade after its initial release in the arcades, Libble Rabble was ported to the Sharp X68000, the FM Towns Marty, and the Super Famicom in 16-bit form. Legacy In Battle City, also by Namco, one of the maps resembles a Hobblin. The game's theme was used in one of the levels of the Pac-Man Vs. port to the Nintendo DS (as part of Namco Museum DS). The game's theme was also used as Shion Uzuki's cell phone ringtone in Xenosaga, a game by Namco for the Sony PlayStation 2. Libble Rabble was ported to the Wii Virtual Console. A medley of the songs in Libble Rabble is also included in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, where it plays in the Pac-Land stage on the Wii U version of the game.

Although primarily \\"New Market\\" referred to the original enclosed market, today in local parlance, the entire shopping area is often known as \\"New Market\\". History Sir Stuart Hogg Market, c. 1905 New Market circa 1945 Some of the earliest English quarters of Calcutta were in an area known then as Dalhousie Square. Terretti and Lalbazar nearby were the customary shopping haunts of the British. Later settlements arose in Kashaitola, Dharmatala and Chowringhee. By the 1850s, British colonists held sway in Calcutta and displayed increasing contempt for the \\"natives\\" and an aversion to brushing shoulders with them at the bazaars. In 1871, moved by a well orchestrated outcry from English residents, a committee of the Calcutta Corporation began to contemplate a market which would be the preserve of Calcutta's British residents. Spurred by the committee's deliberations, the Corporation purchased Lindsay Street, made plans to raze the old Fenwick's Bazar located there, and commissioned Richard Roskell Bayne, an architect of the East Indian Railway Company, to design the Victorian Gothic market complex which would take its place. It began to take shape in 1873, and Bayne was honoured for his achievement with a Rs. 1,000 rupee award, a large sum in the 1870s. Mackintosh Burn was the builder. The giant shopping arcade was thrown open to the English populace with some fanfare on 1 January 1874. News of Calcutta's first municipal market spread rapidly. Affluent colonials from all over India shopped at exclusive retailers like Ranken and Company (dressmakers), Cuthbertson and Harper (shoe-merchants) and R.W. Newman or Thacker Spink, the famous stationers and book-dealers. Sir Stuart Hogg, then the Chairman of Calcutta Corporation, had shown tenacious support for the plans to build the New Market. So, 28 years later, on 2 December 1903, the market was officially named Sir Stuart Hogg Market and later shortened to Hogg Market. Bengali society, in the British era, called it Hogg Shaheber Bajaar, a name that is still in use, just as a painting of Sir Stuart Hogg still hangs in Calcutta Corporation's portrait gallery. But the earliest provisional nickname, New Market, which remained in use throughout, proved to have the most sticking power. New Market's growth kept pace with the city until World War II. The northern portion of the market came up in 1909 at an expense of 6 lakh rupees. Despite the gathering storm of World War II, an extension was engineered on the south flank, and the historic clock tower on the southern end of the market was shipped over from Huddersfield and installed in the 1930s. Florists were located near the front entrance, and stalls selling fresh and preserved foods were placed towards the rear of the market. Beyond the vegetable stalls, fishmongers and slaughterhouse butchers plied their trade, and, until the mid-1970s, at the very back of the market, exotic animals from all over the British Empire could be bought as pets.  Description  Bata Shoe Store in Linsday Street, near the market Despite the appearance of new air-conditioned, American-style, shopping malls all over Kolkata, New Market, which has survived two devastating fires and regular flooding, remains at the core of the shopping experience in the city. Over 2000 stalls under its roof sell everything from clothing to wheeled luggage to electronics to a special cheese found nowhere else. Under its apparent chaos lie extraordinary finds as well as remarkable bargains. Newmarket is a place to shop for garments & accessories, flowers, different food items including raw meat, fish, vegetables and fruits and even spices. There are crockeries and utensil stores. It also has a florist section dealing with exotic flowers. It is situated on Lindsay Street, Kolkata (Calcutta), just off Chowringhee Road, the market is open 10 a.m. until 8 p.m. Monday to Friday, until 7 p.m. on Saturdays, and closed on Sundays. Food stores Bandel Cheese, Plain (White) & Brown (Smoked) There are several renowned confectioners in New Market: Nahoum & Sons (estd. 1902) is truly historic, with its original mahogany cabinetry and marble counters. For over a century, millions of customers have sworn by Nahoum's Rich Fruit Cake, its brownies, marzipan, macaroons and much more. Imperial Confectioners and D Gama compete for a close second and third place. Kalimpong Cheese and Bandel Cheese are local cheese available only in New Market. Kalimpong Cheese comes from the North Bengal tourist spot of Kalimpong, it can be crumbled into salad or eaten raw. Bandel Cheese is an Asian cheese originated in an erstwhile Portuguese colony, Bandel located in eastern India. It is an indigenous unripened, salted soft variety of cheese made in perforated pots. It is similar to Surti paneer but made from cow's milk. Available in two varieties, plain (white) and smoked (brown). Bandel cheese is well salted and can be stored.

Wedgwood pieces, c. 1930, c. 1950, 1885 Wedgwood is a fine china, porcelain, and luxury accessories manufacturer that was founded on 1 May 1759 by the English potter and entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood and was first incorporated in 1895 as Josiah Wedgwood and Sons LtdHistory of Josiah Wedgwood & Sons Ltd. It was rapidly successful and was soon one of the largest manufacturers of Staffordshire pottery, \\"a firm that has done more to spread the knowledge and enhance the reputation of British ceramic art than any other manufacturer\\",Godden (1992), 337 exporting across Europe as far as Russia, and to the Americas. It was especially successful at producing fine earthenware and stonewares that were accepted as equivalent in quality to porcelain (which Wedgwood only made later) but were considerably cheaper.Gooden (1992), 337-338; Dawson, 202-203; Hughes, 308-311 Wedgwood is especially associated with the \\"dry-bodied\\" (unglazed) stoneware Jasperware in contrasting colours, and in particular that in \\"Wedgwood blue\\" and white, always much the most popular colours, though there are several others. Jasperware has been made continuously by the firm since 1775, and also much imitated. In the 18th century, however, it was table china in the refined earthenware creamware that represented most of the sales and profits.Godden (1992), 337-339 In the later 19th century it returned to being a leader in design and technical innovation, as well as continuing to make many of the older styles. Despite increasing local competition in its export markets, the business continued to flourish in the 19th and early 20th centuries, remaining in the hands of the Wedgwood family, but after World War II it began to contract, along with the rest of the English pottery industry. After buying a number of other Staffordshire ceramics companies, in 1987 Wedgwood merged with Waterford Crystal to create Waterford Wedgwood plc, an Ireland-based luxury brands group. After a 2009 purchase by KPS Capital Partners, a New York-based private equity firm, the group became known as WWRD Holdings Limited, an acronym for \\"Waterford Wedgwood Royal Doulton\\". This was acquired in July 2015 by Fiskars, a Finnish consumer goods company. Early history A transfer printed creamware Wedgwood tea and coffee service. c. 1775, Victoria & Albert Museum, in the \\"Liverpool Birds\\" pattern. Fashionable but relatively cheap wares like this were the backbone of Wedgwood's early success. Josiah Wedgwood (1730‚Äì95), came from an established family of potters, and trained with his elder brother.Dawson, 200; Hughes, 308 He was in partnership with the leading potter Thomas Whieldon from 1754 until 1759, when a new green ceramic glaze he had developed encouraged him to start a new business on his own. Relatives leased him the Ivy House in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent,Godden (1992), 337; Hughes, 310 and his marriage to Sarah Wedgwood, a distant cousin with a sizable dowry, helped him launch his new venture. Wedgwood led \\"an extensive and systematic programme of experiment\\",Dawson, 202 and in 1765 created a new variety of creamware, a fine glazed earthenware, which was the main body used for his tablewares thereafter. After he supplied her with a teaset for twelve the same year, Queen Charlotte gave official permission to call it \\"Queen's Ware\\" (from 1767).Dolan, 158-164, 168-169 This new form, perfected as white pearlware (from 1780), sold extremely well across Europe, and to America.Dawson, 202-203; Godden (1992), 337, 340 It had the additional advantage of being relatively light, saving on transport costs and import tariffs in foreign markets.Godden (1992), 337 It caused considerable disruption to the makers of European faience and delftware, then the main European tableware bodies; some went out of business and others adopted English-style bodies themselves.Godden (1992), 337-338 The Pont-aux-Choux factory near Paris was one of the first to do so; in France creamware was known as faience fine, in Italy terraglia. Wedgwood developed a number of further industrial innovations for his company, notably a way of measuring kiln temperatures accurately, and several new ceramic bodies including the \\"dry-body\\" stonewares, \\"black basalt\\" (by 1769), caneware and jasperware (1770s), all designed to be sold unglazed, like \\"biscuit porcelain\\".Dawson, 202-203 Four creamware plates, transfer printed with stories from Aesop's Fables, the other decoration hand-painted. 1770s. In 1766, Wedgwood bought a large Staffordshire estate, which he renamed Etruria, as both a home and factory site; the factory was producing from 1769, initially making ornamental wares, while the \\"useful\\" tablewares were still made in Burslem.Godden (1992), 337 In 1769 Wedgwood established a partnership with Thomas Bentley, who soon moved to London and ran the operations there. Only the \\"ornamental\\" wares such as vases are marked \\"Wedgwood & Bentley\\" and those so marked are at an extra level of quality. The extensive correspondence between Wedgwood and Bentley, who was from a landowning background, show Wedgwood often relied on his advice on artistic questions. Wedgwood felt the loss keenly when Bentley died in 1780.Godden (1992), 338; Young, 12-13 - it is Wedgwood's letters that survive essentially complete, with few of Bentley's. Wedgwood's slightly younger friend, William Greatbatch, had followed a similar career path, training with Whieldon and then starting his own firm around 1762. He was a fine modeller, especially of moulds for tablewares, and probably did most of Wedgwood's earlier moulds as an outside contractor. After some twenty years, Greatbatch's firm went under in 1782, and by 1786 he was a Wedgwood employee, continuing for over twenty years until he retired in 1807, on generous terms specified in Wedgwood's will. In the early period he seems also to have acted as agent for Wedgwood on trips to London,Dolan, 82-83, 101, 129 and after Wedgwood's retirement he may have in effect managed the Etruria works. Transfer printing and enamel painting Serving-plate from the Frog Service with Ditchley Park, Oxfordshire, c. 1774. Unusually, this is creamware with the elaborate view hand-painted. Wedgwood was an early adopter of the English invention of transfer printing, which allowed printed designs, for long only in a single colour, that were far cheaper than hand-painting. Hand- painting was still used, the two techniques often being combined, with painted borders surrounding a printed figure scene. From 1761 wares were shipped to Liverpool for the specialist firm of Sadler and Green to print;Hughes, 296 later this was done in-house at Stoke. From 1769 Wedgwood maintained a workshop for overglaze enamel painting by hand in Little Cheyne Row in Chelsea, London,Dawson, 204 where skilled painters were easier to find. The pieces received a light second firing to fix the enamels in a small muffle kiln; this work was also later moved to Stoke. There was also a showroom and shop in Portland House, 12 Greek Street, Soho, London. Painting included border patterns or bands and relatively straightforward floral motifs on tableware. Complicated figure scenes and landscapes in painted enamels were generally reserved for the most expensive \\"ornaments\\" like vases, but transfer printed items had these. The Frog Service is a large dinner and dessert service made by Wedgwood for Empress Catherine the Great of Russia, and completed in 1774. The service had fifty settings, and 944 pieces were ordered, 680 for the dinner service and 264 for the dessert. Although Wedgwood was already transfer printing many tablewares, this was entirely hand-painted in Chelsea in monochrome, with English views copied from prints and drawings; the final appearance was not dissimilar to transfer printing, but each image was unique. Also at Catherine's request, each piece carries a green frog. Although Wedgwood was paid just over ¬£2,700 he barely made a profit, but milked the prestige of the commission, exhibiting the service in his London showroom before delivery.\\"Plate\\", Curator's comments, British Museum; \\"Wedgwood, frogs and a hedgehog‚Ä¶\\", The Gardens Trust, 2014; Dawson, 204 Wedgwood Portland Vase, black jasperware, c. 1790, copying the Roman cameo glass original. Jasperware Wedgwood's best known product is Jasperware, created to look like ancient Roman cameo glass, itself imitating cameo gems. The most popular jasperware colour has always been \\"Wedgwood blue\\" (a darker shade is sometimes called \\"Portland Blue\\"), an innovation that required experiments with more than 3,000 samples. In recognition of the importance of his pyrometric beads (pyrometer), Josiah Wedgwood was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1783. In recent years, the Wedgwood Prestige collection continued to sell replicas of the original designs, as well as modern neo- classical style jasperware. The main Wedgwood motifs in jasperware, and the other dry-bodied stonewares, were decorative designs that were highly influenced by the ancient cultures being studied and rediscovered at that time, especially as Great Britain was expanding its empire. Many motifs were taken from ancient mythologies: Roman, Greek and Egyptian. Meanwhile, archaeological fever caught the imagination of many artists. Nothing could have been more suitable to satisfy this huge business demand than to produce replicas of ancient artefacts. From 1787 to 1794 Wedgwood even ran a studio in Rome, where young Neoclassical artists were in abundance, producing wax models for reliefs, often to designs sent from England. The most famous design is Wedgwood's copy of the Portland Vase, a famous Roman vase now in the British Museum, which was lent to Wedgwood to copy. Other dry-bodied stonewares Wedgwood developed other dry-bodied stonewares, meaning that they were sold unglazed. The first of these was what he called \\"basaltes\\", now more often \\"black basalt ware\\" or just basalt ware, perfected by 1769. This was a tough body in solid black, much used for classical revival styles.Godden (1992), xix Wedgwood developed an attractive reddish stoneware he called rosso antico (\\"ancient red\\") This was often combined with black basalt.Hughes, 54-55 This was followed by caneware or bamboo ware, the same colour as bamboo and often modelled to look as though objects were made of the plant; first introduced in 1770, but mostly used between 1785 and 1810.Godden (1992), xxi File:DAR pot - IMG 8624.JPGCauliflower coffee-pot, with Wedgwood's green lead glaze, c. 1760, Thomas Whieldon and Josiah Wedgwood File:Tea Caddy with Lid LACMA M.82.206.6a-b (2 of 2).jpgTea caddy, c. 1770, transfer printed by Sadler and Green.

These imitated rather successfully the porcelain figures pioneered by Meissen porcelain, a style which by about 1770 was being produced by the majority of porcelain factories, on the continent and in Britain. Though Staffordshire figures fell precipitously in price and quality after about 1820, in the 18th century many were still well-modelled and carefully painted. Instead Wedgwood concentrated on more sculptural figures, and produced many busts or small relief portrait plaques of celebrities, both types of high quality. The subjects were generally notably serious: politicians and royalty, famous scientists and writers. Many were small, with the oval shape usual in the painted portrait miniature; others were larger. They were probably generally intended for framing; many examples still retain their frames. Many subjects reflected Wedgwood's religious and political views, Unitarian and somewhat Radical respectively,Though the term \\"Radical\\" seems to post-date his death. in particular what is probably the best-known Wedgwood relief, the abolitionist design Am I Not a Man and a Brother?, the basic design of which is usually credited to Wedgwood, although others drew and sculpted the final versions. This appeared in many formats in print and pottery from about 1786, and was very widely distributed, often given away. In addition plaques of varying sizes, most in jasperware, caught the fashion for Neoclassicism, with a great variety of classical subjects, but mostly avoiding nudity. The smaller ones were intended to be set in jewellery, sometimes in steel by Matthew Boulton's factory, and larger sizes might be framed for hanging, or inset in architectural features like fireplace mantels, mouldings and furniture. Smallest of all were many button designs.

File:Wedgwood-Kabinett 2.jpgWedgwood Room with jasperware plaques, in Palais Erzherzog Albrecht in Vienna After Josiah Teapot, 1805-1815, Rosso Antico ware, Egyptian Revival style The firm lost some momentum after the deaths of Bentley in 1780 and the retirement of Josiah Wedgwood in 1790 (he died in 1795). By 1800 it had about 300 employees in Staffordshire. The Napoleonic Wars made exporting to Europe impossible for long periods, and left export markets in disarray. Thomas Byerley, Josiah's nephew, became a partner and was mainly in charge for some years, as Josiah's sons John, known as Jack, and Josiah II (\\"Joss\\"), who joined the firm only on Josiah I's retirement, had developed other interests, in particular horticulture. After Waterloo in 1815, there was a dramatic drop in the vital exports to America. Byerley's death in 1810 forced the brothers to confront the reality of the financial situation, as they needed to buy out his widow. Between the partners and other debtors, the firm was owed some ¬£67,000, a huge sum. Joss bought Jack out, and continued as sole owner.Dolan, 385-389 Wedgwood continued to grow under Jack and his son Francis Wedgwood, and by 1859 the factory had 445 employees. As well as updated versions of wares from the previous century, bathroom ceramics such as sinks and lavatories had been important in recent decades, and Wedgwood's reputation for technical and design innovation had sunk considerably. However, they did introduce porcelain (see below), lustre ware by 1810, a form of Parian ware they called \\"Carrara\\" in 1848, and a \\"Stone China\\" from about 1827, the last of which was not especially successful. Neoclassicism was now less fashionable, and one response was to add floral enamels to black basalt wares from around 1805. Godfrey Wedgwood, Josiah I's great-grandson became a partner in 1859, and had considerable success reviving the firm in both these areas,Dolan, 389-390; Godden (1992), 339-340 in what was generally a successful period for British pottery. Porcelain Wedgwood & Byerley in St James's Square; the London showroom in 1809 Wedgwood's first decades of success came from producing wares that looked very like porcelain, and had broadly the same qualities, though not quite as tough, nor as translucent. During Josiah's lifetime and some time afterwards Wedgwood did not make porcelain itself. European factories had increasing success with porcelain, both soft-paste in England and France, and hard-paste mostly in Germany, which were still competing with Japanese and Chinese export porcelain, which were very popular, though expensive, in Europe. Towards the end of the 18th century other Staffordshire manufacturers introduced bone china as an alternative to translucent and delicate Chinese porcelain.Dolan, 275-276, 387 By 1811 Byerley, as manager of the London shop, wrote back to Stoke that \\"Every day we are asked for China Tea Ware‚Äîour sales of it would be immense if we had any‚ÄîEarthenware Teaware is quite out of fashion...\\", and in response in 1812 Wedgwood first produced their own bone china, with hand- painting.Godden (1992), 339The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts, ed. Campbell, OUP 2006, Volume 2, p547 However West End taste did not perhaps represent all of Wedgwood's markets, and it was not the huge commercial success promised, and after thinking of doing so in 1814, the firm finally stopped making it in 1822. But when revived in 1878 it eventually became an important part of production.Godden (1992), 339-340; Hughes, 310-311; Dolan, 275-276, 387 ;19th century File:Tripod Vase - Wedgwood, c. 1805 - Brooklyn Museum - DSC09038.JPGEmpire Style jasperware tripod vase, c. 1805 File:BLW Teapot with Chinese Flowers.jpgBlack basalt teapot with Chinese Flowers, c. 1820 File:Teapot (AM 1979.85-2) (cropped).jpgSilver lustreware teapot, early 19th century File:Teapot, Josiah Wedgwood and Sons, c. 1840, blue jasperware - Chazen Museum of Art - DSC01980.JPG\\"Portland blue\\" jasperware, c. 1840 File:Dish And Cover (England), ca. 1880 (CH 18806101) (cropped).jpgVictorian majolica dish and cover (for cheese?), c. 1880 Artists who worked with Wedgwood George Stubbs, Reapers, enamels on an earthenware plaque, 1795. From very early on Josiah Wedgwood was determined to maintain high artistic standards, which was an important part of his efforts to appeal to the top end of the market with pottery rather than porcelain wares. He relied considerably on Bentley in London in this, as is clear from their correspondence. As with other potteries, the designs of prints were very often copied. *William Hackwood worked for Wedgwood from 1769 until 1832, starting at around 13, but after some years becoming the main modeller in the factory, finishing and making the moulds for the designs of others, and sculpting his own.Wedgwood Museum: Hackwood's legacy *John Flaxman (Junior), then 19 years old but already a trained sculptor exhibiting at the Royal Academy, was employed as a modeller and designer from 1775, mainly of reliefs in both cases. He worked for the next 12 years mostly for Wedgwood, staying in London and sending modellos in wax on pieces of slate or glass to Stoke. The \\"Dancing Hours\\" may be his most well known design. His father, John Flaxman Senior, made and sold plaster casts in a shop in London, and was supplying Wedgwood with some by 1770.\\"John Flaxman snr (1726-95)\\", Wedgwood Museum *Aristocratic ladies who produced designs, many in a softer \\"Romantic\\" version of Neoclassical style, were Lady Elizabeth Templetown, Emma Crewe and Lady Diana Beauclerk; these were also mostly for jasperware reliefs.Young, 32, 41, 55 *Henry Webber, a trained sculptor, was employed at Etruria in 1782, after being recommended by Sir William Chambers and Sir Joshua Reynolds, becoming chief sculptor in 1785, a position he held until 1806. He worked on the replica Portland Vase, and with Flaxman and \\"Jack\\" (Josiah II) was sent to Italy on a Grand Tour for the young man, and also to look at establishing a modelling studio in Rome, which was set up by Webber in 1788. Flaxman, remaining in Rome as an independent artist, agreed to supervise it part-time.Dolan, 352-353; Young, 55 *George Stubbs was not employed by Wedgwood, but late in his career developed an interest in painting in enamels, and persuaded Wedgwood to make new, large plaques for him to use. His paintings on these were not successful at the time, but are now very highly regarded.

His speciality was enamel paintings, mostly landscapes, on plaques, which fetched very high prices. He and his family did not like living in Staffordshire, and in 1867 he returned to France, but Wedgwood continued to use him, sending blanks to be returned for firing, until his death in 1876. Two of his granddaughters, Therese Lessore and Louise Powell, later painted for the firm.Godden (1992), 340-341 *Daisy Makeig-Jones joined Wedgwood as an apprentice painter in 1909, and in 1915 her \\"Fairyland Lustre\\" range launched. This was very popular on both sides of the Atlantic until the Great Depression; it is now keenly collected.Godden (1992), 341 *In the 1930s Keith Murray designed in a broadly Art Deco style. *Eric Ravilious designed a number of popular pieces such as mugs from 1936 until World War II (during which he died). *Jasper Conran, who first designed for Wedgwood in 2001, was one of two Artistic Directors in 2019.

Many of his descendants were closely involved in the management of the company down to the time of the merger with the Waterford Company: *John Wedgwood, eldest son of Josiah I, was a partner in the firm from 1790 to 1793 and again from 1800 to 1812. *Josiah Wedgwood II or \\"Jack\\" (1769‚Äì1843), second son of Josiah I, succeeded his father as proprietor in 1795 and introduced the production by the Wedgwood company of bone china. *Josiah Wedgwood III (1795‚Äì1880), son of Josiah II, was a partner in the firm from 1825 until he retired in 1842. *Francis Wedgwood, son of Josiah II, was a partner in the firm from 1827 and sole proprietor following his father's death until joined by his own sons. Financial difficulties caused him to offer for sale soon after taking over the firm its factory at Etruria and the family home Etruria Hall, but only the hall was sold. He continued as senior partner until his retirement to Barlaston Hall in 1876. Thomas Carlyle earthenware memorial jug, 1881.

He and his brothers were responsible for the reintroduction of bone china in 1878. *Clement Wedgwood (1840‚Äì1889), son of Francis Wedgwood, was a partner. *Laurence Wedgwood (1844‚Äì1913), son of Francis Wedgwood, was a partner. *Major Cecil Wedgwood DSO (1863‚Äì1916), son of Godfrey Wedgwood, partner from 1884, first Mayor of the federated County Borough of Stoke-on- Trent (1910‚Äì1911), was chairman and managing director of Wedgwood until his death in battle in 1916. *Kennard Laurence Wedgwood (1873‚Äì1949), son of Laurence Wedgwood, was a partner. In 1906 he went to the United States and set up the firm's New York office, which became Josiah Wedgwood and Sons USA, an incorporated subsidiary, in 1919. *Francis Hamilton Wedgwood (1867‚Äì1930), eldest son of Clement Wedgwood, was chairman and managing director from 1916 until his sudden death in 1930. *Josiah Wedgwood V (1899‚Äì1968), grandson of Clement Wedgwood and son of Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood, was managing director of the firm from 1930 until 1968 and credited with turning the company's fortunes around. He was responsible for the enlightened decision to move production to a modern purpose built factory in a rural setting at Barlaston. It was designed by Keith Murray in 1936 and built between 1938 and 1940. He was succeeded as managing director by Arthur Bryan (later Sir Arthur), who was the first non-member of the Wedgwood family to run the firm. ;Other \\"Wedgwood\\" pottery Ralph Wedgwood, presumably a cousin, made high quality wares in Burslem from c. 1790 until probably 1796, marked \\"Wedgwood & Co\\", a name never used by the main firm. He then joined William Tomlinson & Co., a firm in Yorkshire, who promptly dropped their own name, using \\"Wedgwood & Co\\" until he left in 1801. That name was revived by Enoch Wedgwood (1813‚Äì1879), a distant cousin of the first Josiah, who used Wedgwood & Co, starting in 1860.Godden (1992), 334 It was taken over by Josiah Wedgwood & Sons in 1980. Other potters used blatantly misleading marks: \\"Wedgewood\\", \\"Vedgwood\\", \\"J Wedg Wood\\", all on inferior wares.Godden (1992), 334 1960s and 1970s consolidation In 1968, Wedgwood purchased many other Staffordshire potteries including Mason's Ironstone, Johnson Brothers, Royal Tuscan, William Adams & Sons, J. & G. Meakin and Crown Staffordshire. In 1979, Waterford Wedgwood purchased the Franciscan Ceramics division of Interpace in the United States. The Los Angeles plant closed in 1984 and production of the Franciscan brand was moved to Johnson Brothers in Britain. In 1986, Waterford Glass Group plc purchased Wedgwood plc, forming the company Waterford Wedgwood plc. Waterford Wedgwood Wedgwood teawares in a Japanese department store, 2011 In 1986, Waterford Glass Group plc purchased Wedgwood plc for US$360 million, with Wedgwood delivering a US$38.7 million profit in 1998 (while Waterford itself lost $28.9 million), after which the group was renamed Waterford Wedgwood plc. From early 1987 to early 1989, the CEO was Patrick Byrne, previously of Ford, who then became CEO of the whole group. During this time, he sold off non-core businesses and reduced the range of Wedgwood patterns from over 400 to around 240. In the late 1990s, the CEO was Brian Patterson. From 1January 2001, the Deputy CEO was Tony O'Reilly, Junior, who was appointed CEO in November of the same year and resigned in September 2005. He was succeeded by the then-president of Wedgwood USA, Moira Gavin, up until the company went into administration in 2009. In 2001, Wedgwood launched a collaboration with designer Jasper Conran, which started with a white fine bone china collection then expanded to include seven patterns. In March 2009, KPS Capital Partners acquired the Waterford Wedgwood group assets. Assets including Wedgwood, Waterford and Royal Doulton were placed into WWRD Holdings Limited. WWRD Holdings Limited On 5January 2009, following years of financial problems at group level, and after a share placement failed during the global financial crisis of 2008, Waterford Wedgwood was placed into administration on a \\"going concern\\" basis, with 1,800 employees remaining. On 27February 2009, Waterford Wedgwood's receiver Deloitte announced that the New York-based private equity firm KPS Capital Partners had purchased certain Irish and UK assets of Waterford Wedgwood, and the assets of its Irish and UK subsidiaries. KPS Capital Partners placed Wedgwood into a group of companies known as WWRD, an abbreviation for \\"Waterford Wedgwood Royal Doulton\\". In May 2015, Fiskars, a Finnish maker of home products, agreed to buy 100% of the holdings of WWRD. On 2 July 2015, the acquisition of WWRD by Fiskars was completed, including the brands Waterford, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Royal Albert and Roga≈°ka. The acquisition was approved by the US antitrust authorities. In 2015 there were complaints of misleading labelling, in that products made in the company's Indonesian factory were sold labelled \\"Wedgwood England\\".John Murray Brown, \\"UK ceramics industry in battle over heritage\\", Financial Times, 17 May 2015 Wedgwood Museums and the Museum Trust Jasper trial pieces, with numbers keyed to Wedgwood's Experiment Book, 1773-1776, Wedgwood Museum, Barlaston. Wedgwood's founder wrote as early as 1774 that he wished he had preserved samples of all the company's works, and he began to do so. The first formal museum was opened in May 1906, with a curator named Isaac Cook, at the main (Etruria) works. The contents of the museum were stored for the duration of the Second World War and relaunched in a gallery at the new Barlaston factory in 1952. A new purpose-built visitor centre and museum was built in 1975 and remodelled in 1985, with pieces displayed near items from the old factory works in cabinets of similar period. A video theatre was added and a new gift shop, as well as an expanded demonstration area, where visitors could watch pottery being made. A further renovation costing ¬£4.5 million was carried out in 2000, including access to the main factory itself. Adjacent to the museum and visitor centre are a restaurant and tea room, serving on Wedgwood ware. The museum, managed by a dedicated trust, closed in 2000 and on 24 October 2008, it reopened in a new multimillion-pound building. In June 2009, the Wedgwood Museum won a UK Art Fund Prize for Museums and Art Galleries for its displays of Wedgwood pottery, skills, designs and artefacts. In May 2011, the archive of the museum was inscribed in UNESCO's UK Memory of the World Register.\\"2011 UK Memory of the World Register\\", United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO, 2011.

The collection with 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being sold off to help satisfy pension debts inherited when Waterford Wedgwood plc went into receivership in 2009. The Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund, various trusts and businesses contributed donations to purchase the collection. On December 1 2014, the collection was purchased and donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The collection will continue to be on display at the Wedgwood Museum on loan from the Victoria and Albert Museum. Minton Archive The Minton Archive comprises papers and drawings of the designs, manufacture and production of the defunct pottery company Mintons. It was acquired by Waterford Wedgwood in 2005 along with other assets of the Royal Doulton group. At one time it seemed the Archive would become part of the Wedgwood collection. In the event, the Archive was presented by the Art Fund to the City of Stoke-on-Trent, but it was envisaged that some material would be displayed at Barlaston as well as the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery. Wedgwood station Wedgwood railway station was opened in 1940 to serve the Wedgwood complex in Barlaston.

Howell played with City-South from 1953 to 1957. He was a member of that club's 1954 and 1956 NTFA premiership teams and in 1957 won City's best and fairest award. Howell made his VFL debut with the St Kilda Football Club in 1958 after being signed from Tasmania in 1953. He initially played on the half forward line, then later as a half back before playing with the Saints as a full back, where he won the 1959 Brownlow Medal, tying with Bob Skilton. (The medal was awarded retrospectively in 1989 after the countback rule was removed in 1980.) Later in his career he spent some time in the forward line, once kicking nine goals against Hawthorn. He was vice captain to Darrel Baldock for several seasons. In one game against North Melbourne during the 1965 season, coach Allan Jeans played Howell at one end of the ground for the whole game - fullback when St Kilda kicked against the wind and full-forward when they kicked with it. After his retirement as a player, Howell was appointed Assistant Coach to Tom Hafey at Richmond for three years, taking the reserve team to two grand finals ‚Äì winning one. Afterwards he transferred to Western Australia, coaching Claremont for three years and taking them to one losing Grand Final. Howell then returned to Tasmania for a stint in administration with the Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA in the mid 1970s). He then coached Launceston Football Club for a further two years.

Early life There are several legends and myths connected with Bhumia's early childhood. The story goes that once as a kid, when he was sleeping in his cradle, a cobra came and sat over his chest with his hood spread wide-apart. Mother Rajo was stunned at the scene but as she dared to approach the cradle, the cobra disappeared slowly with no harm to the sleeping kid. Another myth relates to the revival of the dead sparrows; and yet another one deals with restoring to health the lost crops of a poor farmer......so forth and so on. These were taken to be miracles and the peoples from far and wide started to crowd at Bhumia house to have his darshan. Bhumia went for his schooling at the age of seven. He was very sharp and intelligent student and imbibed the essentials of Hinduism, Sikhism and Islam at a very young age. Besides attending to his religious lessons, Bhumia also performed the worldly chores like grazing cows in the company of other boys of his village. He would take his cows to the forest where he would also carry plenty of food and Jal (water) to run a free-kitchen (Langar) for the passers-by including the ascetics, saints, the poor and the orphans. Little later, the family would move from Behlolpur to Deepalpur. Initiation By the age of fifteen, Bhumia had developed a strong aspiration to become a monk. With the permission of his parents he approached Baba Pritam Das of Pakpattan, the prominent Saint of Udasin Panth who initiated him into a Guru-mantra. On being formally initiated and baptized by Baba Pritam Dass, Bhumia himself became Baba Bhumman Shah. Soon afterwards, he started to preach the religious messages which were always accompanied by Kirtan and free- kitchen (Langar). It is stated that Chaudhury Lakha Wattu, a Muslim Rajput landlord of village Kutub Kot had been arrested for some reasons and was put behind the bars at Lahore by the orders of the Governor of Punjab. Bibi Bakhtawar, Lakha's mother, was a staunch devotee of the Baba. She solicited Baba's blessings for the release of her son and it so happened that Chaudhury Lakha was released from the jail within couple of days. As a result, Lakha and his numerous Muslim relatives from the Wattu tribe also became devoted followers of the Baba. In addition, the tribe also surrendered a village named Kutub-Kot to the Baba which the latter made the centre of his religious activities. Life work Baba Bhumman Shah travelled from village to village to preach his message of love, peaceful coexistence, universal brotherhood, religious-tolerance and equality. He had followers from many denominations including Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims. Baba also visited the Dargah of Sufi Saint Baba Farid, Golden Temple at Amritsar, and numerous other Sikh and Hindu shrines during his religious itineraries. At village Kutub-Kot, which later became renowned as Dera Baba Bhumman Shah, Baba permanently established the maryada of Kirtan and free kitchen (Langar). Baba was also a very dedicated Sikh of Guru Gobind Singh. It is told that once, Dashmesh Guru and his Sikh followers were going to Nili Bar when they visited Baba Bhumman Shah and took Langar at the Dera; pleased with Shah's noble mission, Gobind Singh blessed him that his Langar would continue to grow with no shortage of any kind.Kosh, Mahan. Encyclopaedia of Sikh Literature (1999), p. 920 Legacy After carrying out his religious mission for well over 50 years, Baba died in 1762 CE. He was succeeded by Mahant Nirmal Chand who continued his work. During the times of sixth Mahant Baba Darshan Dass, a British Divisional Commissioner visited the Dera. Impressed by Mahant's personality as well as the Dera- complex and the free-kitchen service (Langar), the Commissioner attached 3000 acres (12 km¬≤) of agricultural land as fief to the shrine (Baba Bhuman Shah by Sant Chandra Swami). Total landed property in the name of Shrine grew well over 18,000 acres (73 km¬≤) of agricultural land (cf: 18700 acres (76 km¬≤) in the name of Gurudwara Sri Nankana Sahib in Sheikhupura). Besides landed property, there was other moveable/immoveable property in the name of the Dera. Post-Partition scenario After partition, due to compulsions of politics, Mahant Girdhari Dass, the Mukh Sewadar of the Dera, shifted his religious headquarters from Pakistan to India. A new Shrine and Dera was established in Sangar Sadan in Sirsa District in Haryana. The total land transferred to the Dera from Pakistan was a meagre 1600 acres (6.5 km¬≤) compared to over 18000 acres (73 km¬≤) in Montgomery. After Mahant Girdhari Dass's death, Baba Mahant Amar Nath Bawa was the mahant of the shrine in Sangar Sadan. At present Baba Braham Dass is the mahant (Gaddinasheen). Mahant Baba Braham Dass Ji is the 12th Mahant of Dera Baba Bhuman Shah Ji Sangar Sarista (Sirsa). Besides Sangar Sadan, the Hindu devotees of the Baba have also built several temples in his memory in a number of states of northern India as well, where daily worship unto Babaji is offered with faith and love (Baba Bhuman Shah by Sant Chandra Swami). In Pakistan, this Dera was considered the richest with huge property attached to it in pre-partition times. The spiritual and pragmatic teachings of Baba Bhuman Shah have been presented in the form of aphorisms in a booklet by his ardent devotee, Sage Chandra Swami, with a focus on true goal of life as well as the right means for its achievement. These teachings are in complete concordance with Baba's own divine life.

His poetry was initially composed in Alexandrine form, but he later became a modernist. Biography He was born in Uni√£o dos Palmares, the son of a wealthy merchant. When he was nine, he moved with his mother and siblings to Macei√≥. In 1909, when only sixteen, he moved to Salvador where he began his medical studies. He completed his studies in Rio de Janeiro in 1914, but he decided that he wanted to make his name as a poet. That same year he published his first book of poems, Alexandrians XIV. He returned to Macei√≥ in 1915 where he devoted himself to medicine, literature and politics. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alagoas from 1918 to 1922. The Revolution of 1930 inspired him to move to Rio de Janeiro where he set up an office near Cinel√¢ndia. In time, this office also served as an art studio and a meeting place for intellectuals. There he made the acquaintance of writers such as Murilo Mendes, Graciliano Ramos and Jos√© Lins do Rego. During this period he published ten books, including five collections of poetry. In 1935 Jorge de Lima converted to the Roman Catholicism and many of his poems reflected his religiosity. In 1939 he decided to dedicate more time to the visual arts as well, participating in some exhibitions. In 1952 he published his most important book, the epic Invention of Orpheus. In 1953, only months before he died, he recorded poems for the Archives of the Spoken Word at the Library of Congress.Library of Congress catalog listing He died in Rio de Janeiro, aged 60. Commentary Between 1937 and 1945, his candidacy for the Brazilian Academy of Letters was rejected six times. According to Ivan Junqueira, who served as the Academy's President for the year 2004-2005, the Academy committed an injustice to the author whose literary work was so well received by critics and the public. Referring to Invention of Orpheus, he says, \\"... even today, more than 50 years after its publication, there is no Brazilian poet who does not remember him. \\" The writings of Jorge de Lima may be read in many ways: The uneasy coexistence between tradition and the new; the vulgar and the sublime; the regional and universal. His work touches on social injustices that have changed little since the beginning of civilization \\"... of human misery, the attempt to overcome our moorings and our limitations\\", according to poet and journalist Claufe Rodrigues. √çtalo Moriconi, poet and professor of Brazilian literature at Rio de Janeiro State University, in analyzing the work of Jorge de Lima, does not believe in the hypothesis that religious issues have hampered Lima's career: \\"As a religious poet Jorge de Lima never produced anything with the quality of a Murilo Mendes in \\"Freedom Poetry\\".

It is an updated version of Xevious (1983), created as a response to the overwhelming success of the original in Japan. Like the original game, the player controls a starship known as the \\"Solvalou\\", equipped with two weapons: an \\"air zapper\\" to defeat flying enemies, and a \\"blaster bomb\\" to destroy ground-based enemies. It runs on the Namco Galaga arcade board. New enemy types include metallic Galaxian flagships. Some of these revert the player's score to zero if destroyed. It has been ported to the Sharp X68000 and PlayStation, alongside inclusion in several Namco collections. Gameplay Arcade version Super Xevious is a vertical-scrolling shooter, and an updated version of Xevious. Its gameplay is largely identical; the player assumes control of a starship, the Solvalou, in its mission to destroy a supercomputer named GAMP and its Xevious forces. In each of these areas, the player must destroy constantly-moving waves of enemies and avoiding collision with them or their projectiles. The Solvalou has two weapons at its disposal: a forward-moving shot that destroys flying enemies, and an air-to- surface bomb that destroys ground-stationed targets. On occasion, the player will face off against a boss named the Andor Genesis, which can be defeated by destroying its center core or four blaster receptacles. Some areas contain hidden towers known as \\"Sol Citadels\\", which are found by bombing specific parts of an area. Yellow \\"Special Flags\\" from Rally-X can also be uncovered, which reward the player with an extra life. Super Xevious poses multiple additions and changes to the original. The gameplay overall is harder than its predecessor in difficulty, featuring more aggressive enemies and faster-moving projectiles. Several new enemy types were introduced, including fighter jets, tanks, helicopters, and silver-plated Galaxian flagships, which are found in specific areas of the game. Some of these enemies reset the player's score to zero upon destruction; however, bonus points are awarded for flying over the tank. The placement of the Sol Citadels and Special Flags have also been changed. Reception and legacy Its inclusion in Xevious 3D/G+ drew mixed responses from critics. Graeme Nicholson, a writer for Play UK, believed that while Super was still fun to play and posed enough challenge, its differences from the original Xevious were few and far between and \\"[spoiled] the idea of the collection slightly.\\" A writer for the Spanish magazine PSX Magazine agreed, describing it as a \\"decaffinated\\" variation of its predecessor with little in the way of new content. However, they liked the slightly-refined visuals and overall increase in speed. Retrospectively in 1998, AllGames Earl Green noted of Supers high level of difficulty and new enemy types, writing that its enhanced challenge and differences in gameplay made it a superior update to Xevious. Retro Gamer writer Stuart Campbell showed appreciation towards its new additions to the game, namely the silver Galaxian bosses. Former Happy End and Yellow Magic Orchestra member Haruomi Hosono recorded an arranged dance/synthpop version of the game's theme tune, which was released in Japan by Alfa Records' Yen label as a 12\\" single on August 29, 1984. The single was also released in Europe by Pick Up Records that same year.

It is an elegant building of British era and is a famous building in Kolkata. The hotel is owned by Oberoi chain of hotels. History Grand Hotel (Calcutta) in 1903s The site where the hotel now stands was first developed at No. 13 Chowringhee Road as the private residence of a Colonel Grand in the early nineteenth century. The house was converted into a boarding house by Mrs. Annie Monk who later expanded her business to include Numbers 14, 15 and 17. 16 Chowringhee was occupied by a theatre owned and managed by Arathoon Stephen, an Armenian from Isfahan. When, in 1911, the theatre burned down, Stephen bought out Mrs. Monk and, over time, redeveloped the site into what now makes up the modern hotel. Built in an extravagant neoclassical style, the hotel soon became a popular spot amongst the English population of Calcutta. It was known, in particular, for its annual New Year party that, along with iced champagne and expensive gifts, involved the release of twelve piglets in the ballroom. Anyone who caught a piglet, could keep it. Old Chowringhee Road in front of Grand Hotel (Calcutta) Old Advertisement In the 1930s, sometime after the death of Stephen, a typhoid epidemic in Calcutta resulted in the death of six people at the hotel. The drainage system at the hotel was suspected and it was closed in 1937. The property was leased by Mohan Singh Oberoi who reopened the hotel in 1939 and was able to buy the property outright in 1943. The hotel got a major lift during World War II when about 4000 soldiers were billeted there, and would party regularly. Events like the U.S. Marines' Ball at the hotel remind visitors of such times. Features The hotel features a large white building covering an entire block, colonnaded verandahs and balconies on the upper floors, projecting portico for the entire length of the block supported on paired columns with Ionic capitals, and stucco ornamentation in the facade.

The company owned a large brewery on Broadway in Sydney from 1835 until 1985, known as the Kent Brewery. It was historically one of Australia's oldest companies, having been established as a partnership in 1835 and listed on the then Sydney Stock Exchange in July 1961. The brand has undergone a revival in 2015. Invicta, the flag of the English county of Kent Trademark of Tooth & Co., embedded in the wall of one of the buildings at the abandoned Mittagong Maltings History John Tooth emigrated to Australia in the early 1830s, traded for a time as a general merchant, and then in 1835, with his brother-in-law, John Newnham, opened a brewery in Sydney. He named the brewery Kent Brewery. Brewing Tooth and Reschs Beer; (Tooth & Co., July 1973); (Unpublished) It was incorporated as a company in 1888. The Tooth family had interests in banking, agriculture and real estate and could afford to support their brewing operations through the turbulent times of the late 19th century, enabling the brewer to become the dominant maker of beer into the 20th century. Tooth's major asset was Kent Brewery, although Tooth had numerous other assets; it owned Blue Bow Cordials (which later produced Blue Bow Lemonade), it acquired the Maltings at Mittagong in 1905,The Sydney Morning Herald, \\"Mittagong\\", 8 February 2004. Maltings at Carlton Street, Sydney, Resch's Limited and their Waverley Brewery in 1929,Guide to Australian Business records, Tooth and Co. Accessed 5 November 2007. numerous hotels and considerable land. Tooth owned the New South Wales franchise of Hungry Jack's, although it failed to exploit the franchise. It also owned the d'Albora Marina. For a short period from 1978 it also owned the Courage Brewery in Victoria, and a brewery at Tuncester, near Lismore. For a period it owned Penfolds Wines, and Penfolds' subsidiary, the Koala Motel Chain. The Tooth family is also famous for building the Swifts mansion at Darling Point in Sydney.The Swifts, Darling Point. Aussie Heritage, Accessed 8 November 2007. Kent Brewery was built on Blackwattle Creek in 1835. The original Tooth and Co produced many beers, of which only two remain on the market ‚Äì KB Lager and Kent Old Brown. Kent brewery was substantially damaged by a fire in about 1900. In 1913 Tooth and Co acquired the Maitland Brewing Company. In 1921, Tooth and Co took over Reschs and their \\"Waverley\\" brewery on South Dowling Street in Redfern. Acquisition was conditional that Tooth would not change the original recipe for Reschs Beer. In 1921 Tooth also acquired a Newcastle brewery, the Castlemaine Brewery and Wood Brothers Company. Tooth later made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire the Millers Brewery (Owned by trucking magnate RW Miller), located at Taverner's Hill in Sydney. In 1967, Millers Brewery was sold to rivals, Tooheys.Summary of RW Miller Co. Newcastle Regional Museum, accessed 8 November 2007. Tooth was losing business to the takeaway packaged beer market, and established Bottle- Mart, whose original spokesman was the comedian Spike Milligan. In 1978, Tooth constructed a brewery at Lismore. Expansion into Victoria Tooth relied primarily on the pub industry; however, clubs were becoming increasingly important as a liquor outlet. The clubs were supplied by Courage Brewery in Victoria, which meant that Tooth was losing ground. In 1978, Tooth acquired the Courage Brewery in Victoria, signifying a major move into the Victorian market.Altered States. Sydney Morning Herald, 1 October 2005. Logo The logo and trademark of Tooth and Co was based on the battle standard of two Saxon chiefs, Hengist (stallion) and Horsa (horse) who invaded Britain more than 1,400 years ago, landing at Ebbsfleet in 449 AD. On the crowning of Hengist's son, Eric, as the first King of Kent, their standard, a white horse known as Invicta, became the emblem of Kent. It was adopted in more modern times as the ensign of Kentish Units in the British Army. Kent has always been the principal hop growing area of the UK, and John Tooth was born in Kent. He made the white horse rampant his company's trademark. In the early 1970s, in an apparent attempt to modernise the image of the company, the symbol was secretly gelded. The more observant staff of the company noticed the change, and saw it as a portent of things to come. Subsequently, the trademark was changed, with some fanfare, to a stylised horse head, as shown on the label shown above. A more recent annual report (1995) showed both the gelding and a knight, located on the corner of a chess board. Staff facilities and benefits Tooth offered numerous staff benefits. The company offered a ¬£10 marriage bonus to those employees getting married while in the company's service. Leave was four weeks per year, with 50% loading. Although there was no formal superannuation available, employees retiring from the company \\"would be provided for\\" on confidential terms. There was a staff social club coordinated by Kent Brewery. Following restructuring circa 1975, Tooth had a gymnasium (at Kent Brewery), \\"Wet\\" canteen (Kent and Waverley breweries) and a (non-technical) reading room/library. The social club also purchased an old fishing boat, sponsored by the company. The social club published a magazine called Tooth Topics. Employees had a generous ration of beer at morning tea (called the beer break), lunch, afternoon tea and when they clocked off. Some of the trade supervisors were able to float between bars during the day. The brewery had several bars, in addition to which plant operators could tap a leaking cask for their own enjoyment; such a cask was called the honeypot. Tooth unsuccessfully sought a ruling from the Industrial Relations Commission that the honeypot would be banned. The ruling was that a precedent had been set. Subsequently, an inebriated operator, while travelling home, was hit by a train. Tooth successfully appealed the IRC decision. The honeypot was banned and instead Tooth would issue plastic tokens allowing employees to take home one carton of beer per week for their private enjoyment. That arrangement ended with CUB. In an apparent contradiction, Tooth would not tolerate drunkenness among its staff. Depending on perceived value to the company, alcoholism could lead either to summary dismissal, or to a drying out period at a clinic. Decline Prior to 1974, Tooth relied on a handshake agreement with its interstate rivals that they would not intrude in each other's territories, while Tooth's hotels were 'tied', meaning licensees were bound to market Tooth Beers. Both of these practices would be outlawed under the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act in 1974. Tooth appointed McKinsey and Company, a management consultant firm, to review its procedures, which was headed by Fred Hilmer, a strong advocate of free competition. Following the review, Tooth made a number of structural changes; McKinsey generally followed the Harvard school of thought that the company should use external consultants for its non-core activities. Between 1975 and 1980, Tooth made numerous acquisitions, two of which were Wright-Heaton Pty Ltd (a catering firm), and Budge Refrigeration. In 1975, Tooth reconstructed the brewing facilities at Irving Street, Sydney, which was funded from cash flow. Between 1976 and 1982, Tooth and Co owned Penfolds winery. As indication of the conservative financial status of Tooth, the acquisition was funded by tightening credit terms with the hoteliers from 90 days down to 30 days. (Penfolds was later acquired by Southcorp Wines, which was subsequently acquired by the Foster's Group.) Tooth saw the weakness in its financial position, and took some action to avert being a takeover target. It attempted a reverse takeover of LJ Hooker Ltd, so as to acquire Hooker's expertise in managing the land holdings; the takeover failed. In 1981, a controlling interest in Tooth and Co was acquired by David Jones (Properties) Pty Ltd, then a division of the Adelaide Steamship Company, known as AdSteam, a corporate raider and asset stripper. Subsequently, AdSteam in 1983 sold the brewing interests to Carlton & United Breweries.Inside Business, marketing at Fosters. HSC Business studies, accessed 8 November 2007. Subsequently, Victoria Bitter, Fosters, Cascade Light and Stirling Light were then brewed at Kent Brewery. AdSteam's acquisitions were funded by huge borrowings, and the group had high debt levels (gearing). With the onset of the recession of the early 1990s, interest rates rose. Under the pressure of its debt, AdSteam was forced to liquidate all tangible assets, although its bankers had agreed to an orderly sale. The disposal started in 1991, and concluded on 24 December 1999 when AdSteam, under its new name of Residual Assco Group Limited, was delisted. With the disposal of assets, various member companies of the AdSteam group were renamed. David Jones was renamed DJL Ltd prior to the relisting of the department stores as David Jones in 1995. The Adelaide Steamship Company was renamed Residual Assco prior to the listing of AdSteam Marine in 1997. The owners of Dextran, and hence IEL, were now called Residual Assco, DJL and Tooth, and still share the tax liability. Pending the outcome of the taxation ruling, the three companies remain in limbo. The matter continued to grind on in the courts, as in December 2007 IEL were given leave to appeal the Australian Taxation Office rulingSexton, Elisabeth (2007). Fresh twist in IEL's monster tax case Brisbane Times 28 December 2007, with the matters being completed by 2010. Tooth, as a listed company, had to publish an annual report. Each year the three companies (Residual Assco, DJL, and Tooth) went through the formality of an Annual General Meeting.See, for example, AGM 8 November 2006. The meeting in regard to the three worthless companies takes about twenty minutes; on the basis of a comparison with three witches huddled over a cauldron, analysts and the press have named the three companies the three ugly sisters.The Australian Financial Review, 24 December 1999 Tooth and Co was delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange in 2010, declared a loss in 2012/13 and was deregistered in 2013. Today The abandoned Mittagong Maltings Kent Brewery In early 2005, CUB closed the massive Kent Brewery, with all CUB beers in NSW now sourced from Queensland and Victoria. The brewery site was demolished and is undergoing redevelopment into housing, with the exception of a heritage chimney and a gate. The gate still bears the trademark of Invicta, the rampant stallion. Hahn Staff from the Kent and Waverley breweries founded several small boutique breweries: Dr Charles \\"Chuck\\" Hahn, who was production manager at Tooth, founded the Hahn Brewery in Pyrmont Bridge Road, Pyrmont. A syndicate of brewers founded the Pumphouse Brewery in Darling Harbour. The two fledgling breweries were physically close and shared technology. A third brewery was established at Old Sydney Town near Gosford. Hahn was subsequently acquired by Lion Nathan,Our History. Lion Nathan . Accessed 5 November 2007. and the Pumphouse brewery site has been redeveloped. Maltings The Maltings at Carlton Street, Sydney, and at Mittagong were managed by three brothers Ernest, Clarrie and Arthur Jones. Their father William was also the original manager of the Maltings from 1905 until his death in 1928. The Jones family had a combined service to Tooth and Co of well over 150 years. Mittagong Maltings had a considerable land holding, although much of the land was sold for a peppercorn to an adjacent girls school. Mittagong Maltings had three separate buildings, one destroyed by a fire in 1965. The other two are now abandoned, having closed in 1981.Australian Heritage, Mittagong. Accessed 5 November 2007. The Mittagong Maltings is in a state of disrepair and has been considerably vandalised. Waverley Brewery and the Blue Bow site have been redeveloped as housing. The Lismore Brewery did commence production, and was intended to cover distribution of regions north of Tooheys' Grafton brewery. But as soon as production commenced, Tooheys acquired Castlemaine XXXX brewery, so the distribution potential for a brewery at Lismore became locked in. Tooheys and Castlemaine are now part of the Lion Nathan Brewing group. Museum Tooth established and maintained a comprehensive brewing museum at its Kent Brewery. The contents of the museum have since been donated to the Powerhouse Museum, located in Harris Street, Ultimo, where some are now on permanent display. Beers Longneck of Reschs DA * KB Lager ‚Äì named after the Kent Brewery, once one of the most popular beers in NSW, was produced in small amounts by Carlton & United (CUB) but has since been discontinued. It has recently been popularised amongst the younger demographic by the fictional beer-swilling Rugby League Legend Reg Reagan as his beer of choice. * Kent Old Brown ‚Äì a brown ale, different in style from the darker and sweeter Old Black Ale brewed by Tooheys. Kent Old Brown is only available on tap. It is most common on tap in Newcastle. * Resch's Pilsner ‚Äì originally brewed by Reschs brewery until it was taken over by Tooth and Co in 1929. It was once a very popular NSW beer, but has never been advertised by Carlton United. It has maintained a level of popularity and is still available in most bottle shops in NSW. Old advertisements depicting Rugby League players from the 1930s to the 1960s, with the tagline \\"Reschs Refreshes\\", are now considered collectors items. With the current fashion of being \\"retro\\" in Australia, Reschs Pilsner has managed to maintain a market share in the younger demographic, and is available throughout Sydney, and other major centres of NSW (e.g. Newcastle, Wollongong). While being brewed in Queensland by CUB, it is sold only in New South Wales. Critics claim that these 'retro' beers from CUB differ only by their labels, and are not true to the original recipes. * Reschs Draught, the draught version of Reschs Pilsener is readily available on tap in New South Wales (outside the Riverina district). * Reschs Dinner Ale (DA) ‚Äì available in 'longneck' bottles only. The brew was often called 'Dirty Annie'. Its supporters considered to be the finest of Edmond Resch's creations. In 2012, a 1962 bottle of DA was discovered hidden inside a piano, but the owner has yet to open it. Pub paintings A feature of Tooth and Co was the sponsorship of large pub paintings in the 1930s and 1940s in NSW. Walter Jardine (1884-1970), an internationally known commercial artist of the era, was contracted to do a series of ink and water color posters for Tooths. These pub posters sought to advertise beer by associating it with sport, health and cultural sophistication. Tooth and Co owned hundreds of pubs throughout NSW at the time and sought to decorate many with these paintings. Many have now disappeared from the pub walls; they are now highly valued as souvenirs of the era.

In 1997 it was named in the National Register of Historic Places, under the name of \\"City Hall and Opera House\\". The current building built during 1909‚Äì1910 cost the city just over $33,000 and was financed by a 5% bond system. It was designed by Mansfield architect Vernon Redding.https://www.heritageohio.org/loudonville/ The building was multi- functional when it opened its doors in 1911 at the time housing the Ohio village offices, its fire department and its jail on the first floor. On the second floor was the council chambers, police department, and a public library. Finally at the rear of the building stood the Opera House with its 700 seats. That Opera House was used for civic gatherings, cultural events and various forms of live entertainment. 1909 to 1980s The building was erected in 1909 and operated as a fire station before it was converted into a theater in 1910 and being renamed \\"The Opera House.\\" On its opening day of December 27, 1910, the Opera House featured a special scenic and electrical show titled, The Flaming Arrow which had been preceded by a street parade as well as a free concert featuring the town band. In 1916, Neptune's Daughter was the first motion picture to be shown at the Opera House. In 1931, under new management, it was renamed the Ohio Theater. In the 1940s the theater provided a few hours of entertainment during World War II. 1990s to present In 1991, the Mohican Area League of Arts had hundreds of volunteers paint, clean, and refurnished the theater, and re-opened with the premiere of Dick Tracy. Then, in 1997 the National Register of Historic Places announced that the Ohio Theater would be preserved for all time. The same year, the city lost Merilliat Industries, a company whose loss cost the city $30,000 in tax revenue. The Loudonville Board of Recreation took over the theater in 1997 as well. But due to the loss of revenue and the drop in attendance, the last film was stated to be Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. However, three local freshman girls raised $4,000 in a local talent show to get new balcony seats and electrical work. And the next year, LTAC (Loudonville Theater Arts Committee), which was headed by Kerry MacQueen, raised over $5,000 in a day- long event of performances, tours and a showing of The Wizard of Oz, and later in the evening they showed the same film with the soundtrack The Dark Side of the Moon. Ten years later, the theater is still going strong, providing multiple entertainment opportunities including the Loudonville High School Drama Club musicals.

The plan was drafted by Israeli Minister Yigal Allon shortly after the Six-Day War in June 1967. The Allon Plan The broad aim of the plan was to annex most of the Jordan Valley from the river to the eastern slopes of the West Bank hill ridge, East Jerusalem, and the Etzion bloc, to Israel. The remaining parts of the West Bank, containing most of the Palestinian population, were to become Palestinian autonomous territory, or would return to Jordan, including a corridor to Jordan through Jericho. The Jordanian King Hussein rejected the plan. Allon died in 1980, and the following year the Israeli government passed the Golan Heights Law, effectively annexing most of the governorate.  The plan  The Allon Plan was based on the doctrine that Israeli sovereignty over a large part of the Israeli-occupied territories was necessary for Israel's defense.Yigal Allon (Peikowitz) (1918 ‚Äì 1980). Knesset website. Accessed May 2014What was the 1967 Allon Plan. ProCon. Accessed May 2014 On the other hand, Allon wanted Israel to return populated territories, and most of the Sinai Peninsula as well, to Arab control, in order to progress towards a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The plan was designed to include as few Arabs as possible in the areas claimed for Israel. Israeli leaders ruled out the possibility of incorporating the West Bank Palestinian population into a greater Israel because it would have dramatically changed the state's Jewish demographic orientation. Yigal Allon presented the plan when he served as Minister of Labor under Mapai Prime Minister Levi Eshkol. According to the Allon Plan, Israel would annex most of the Jordan Valley, from the river to the eastern slopes of the West Bank hill ridge, East Jerusalem, and the Etzion bloc. At the same time, the heavily populated areas of the West Bank hill country, together with a corridor that included Jericho, would be offered to Jordan.Ian S.

Haaretz, 1 June 2008  Jordanian versus Palestinian option  After the Six-Day War, Israeli leaders considered two possibilities to end the occupation: either the \\"Jordanian option\\", holding the transfer of control for most of the territory of the West Bank to the Jordanian monarch, or alternatively the \\"Palestinian option\\", under which the Palestinians would get autonomy or an independent state.Reuven Pedatzur, The 'Jordanian option,' the plan that refuses to die. Haaretz, 25 July 2007 The majority of the Government, including Yigal Allon, favored the Palestinian option. In June 1967, according to journalist Reuven Pedatzur, writing in 2007 in an article in Haaretz, Allon expressed caution over the Jordanian option and declared that \\"The last thing we must do is to return one inch of the West Bank. We must not view Hussein as existing forever ‚Äì today it is Hussein, but tomorrow it is Nabulsi, and the day after that some Syrian will take hold of them and following that they will make a defense pact with the Soviet Union and China and we'll find ourselves in a much more difficult position. We are talking about a matter that is not forever, and we are placing it on a phenomenon that is flesh and blood, and perhaps will remain for a maximum of 60 years, if he does not get shot before that.\\". Allon said that he was \\"taking the maximum possibility. Not a canton, not an autonomous region, but an independent Arab state agreed on between us and them in an enclave surrounded by Israeli territory ‚Äì independent even in its foreign policy.\\" In July 1967, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol stated that there was no choice in order to ensure Israel's security needs but to continue to control the entire area as far as the Jordan River, militarily. But in order to avoid turning Israel into a bi-national state, the Arab citizens of the West Bank should be granted a special status. A quasi-independent autonomous region was the first option.  Presentation of the plan  On 27 July 1967, Allon presented the first version of his plan based on the Palestinian option, which included Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank. The autonomous region consisted of two large enclaves, separated by the Greater Jerusalem area, from Israel in the west to the Jordan Valley in the east. A vast majority of the ministers rejected the plan when it was brought before the plenary session of the government on 30 July. At the beginning of 1968, Allon abandoned the Palestinian option and instead adopted the Jordanian option. He adapted the Allon Plan by adding a corridor between the West Bank and Jordan through the Jericho area, proposing that the Jordan Valley remain in Israeli hands along with Gush Etzion, part of the Hebron foothills and East Jerusalem. All the remainder would be handed over to King Hussein. Most of the members of the Government then backed the Allon Plan as the basis of the policy.  Diplomatic efforts  From February to September 1968, Eshkol held secret talks with Palestinian leaders in the Occupied Territories without result. Parallel to the talks, secret conversations with Jordan started in London in May 1968, ending in November that year. Although the Allon Plan was never officially endorsed by the successive Israeli Cabinets, the peace plan Israel offered to King Hussein in September 1968 was based on it. The conditions included demilitarization of the West Bank, deployment of Israeli troops in the Jordan Valley, and Israeli annexation of a 10 to 15 kilometers-wide strip of land along the Jordan River (the border with Jordan), most of the Judean desert along the Dead Sea, and East Jerusalem. The arrangements were to be valid for generations to come. Hussein, however, rejected the plan. He stuck to UN Resolution 242, including the statement that territories cannot be acquired by force. While Israel would remain military control over all of the West Bank and annex about one-third of the territory, Jordan would get political control over the remaining two-thirds. Eventually King Hussein broke off the talks.Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964‚Äì1968, Volume XX, Arab-Israeli Dispute, 1967‚Äì68. Volume Summary, par. The Search for Other Peace Prospects.

Accessed May 2014 ‚Ä≥Gush Emunim was active first in attempts to establish Jewish settlements in areas outside the zones discussed in the \\"Allon Plan\\" (see Yigal Allon), from which the settlement policy of Yitzhak Rabin‚Äôs first government was derived.‚Ä≥ As the Plan propagated a security doctrine, the Jordan River marked the strategic border of Israel, serving as a buffer zone between Israel and the \\"Eastern Front\\". Settlements built in the Jordan Valley were designed as permanent advance-position lookouts in the 15 kilometers-wide strip along the Jordan Valley and Judean Desert to be annexed by Israel.Dispossession and Exploitation: Israel's Policy in the Jordan Valley and Northern Dead Sea, pp. 5-6. B'Tselem, May 2011. On Settlements in the Jordan Valley, which are typically agricultural settlements, are primarily located along two major north-south bypass roads: the Allon Road in the western and Route 90 in the eastern Jordan Valley. The Palestinians see the Jordan Valley, the most fertile part of the West Bank with important water resources, as the breadbasket for the future Palestinian State.Israeli annexation policies in the Jordan Valley . PLO-NAD, September 2013 In June 1967, Israel de facto annexed East Jerusalem and surrounding parts of the West Bank by incorporating the areas into the Jerusalem Municipality, although it carefully avoided using the term annexation.Jerusalem Syndrome‚ÄîThe Palestinian‚ÄìIsraeli Battle for the Holy City, pp. 53-54. Mosheh  ªAmirav, Sussex University Press, 2009 On 10 July 1967, Foreign Minister Abba Eban explained to the UN Secretary General: ‚Ä≥The term 'annexation' which was used by supporters of the vote is not accurate. The steps that were taken [by Israel] relate to the integration of Jerusalem in administrative and municipal areas, and served as a legal basis for the protection of the holy places of Jerusalem.‚Ä≥ In the following years, extensive construction of settlements took place in the Greater Jerusalem area, resulting in a ring of Israeli settlements that separates Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank. During and after the failed 2013-14 Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, renewed discussions appeared in the press about ideas from Israeli politicians to annex Area C.In wake of talks' collapse, Bennett to present PM with proposal to annex Area C. Herb Keinon, Jerusalem Post, 15 May 2014 Area C includes the Jordan Valley, but encloses a much larger area.  Hebron  While Hebron was predestined in the Allon Plan to be part of the Palestinian autonomous region, in 1968 Israel made it clear to Jordan that apart from the annexation of the Jordan Valley, it also wanted a strip of territory running to the Hebron area. Two years later, the Labor Government approved the building of the Kiryat Arba settlement, just outside the eastern municipality border. Kiryat Arba both marked the western border of the Israeli-claimed territory in the Allon Plan and blocked the Palestinian build-up area of Hebron in the east. In the following years Jewish settlements were established at the southern outskirts of the Old City. In 1994, Israel closed the Palestinian shops in Al-Shuhada Street and prohibited Palestinian access. In the years from 2002, the Worshippers Way from Kiryat Arba to the Cave of the Patriarchs was built. With the creation of a Palestinian-free route between Kiryat Arba and the Shuhada region, the planned strip from the Jordan Valley to Hebron was finished.  Defense Minister Dayan's views in May 1973  On 18 May 1973, the American Embassy in Israel sent a diplomatic cable to the Secretary of State in Washington DC on the subject of then-Defence Minister \\"Dayan's Thinking on Possible Peace Arrangements with Jordan and Egypt\\". The cable contained accounts of discussions with Dayan's close political ally, Deputy Transportation Minister Gad Yaacobi, that Dayan was preparing to expand the autonomy of Arab municipalities in the former West Bank of Jordan, which Israel had captured from Jordan in the Six-Day War.Cables of 18 May 1973: Dayan's Thinking on Possible Peace Arrangements with Jordan & Egypt According to Yaacobi, Dayan was \\"preparing\\" for a greater \\"degree of autonomy for West Bank municipalities\\", while Dayan envisaged the \\"rest of the West Bank population though living under Israeli sovereignty as being fullfledged Jordanian citizens\\", with the exception of Ramallah's and Bethlehem's inhabitants, \\"who would become Israeli citizens.\\"May 1973 cable, Summary Yaacobi further stated that the media had misrepresented Dayan as being prepared to return most, if not all, of the West Bank to Jordan; he was not. Dayan felt it was important for Israelis to settle outside the lines of the Allon Plan, though not within Arab municipalities. The Greater Jerusalem area should be expanded to include Ramallah and Bethlehem, with Israeli citizenship granted its Arab inhabitants. Dayan envisaged a metropolitan Nablus-Jenin complex under the sovereignty of \\"the Arab nation east of the Jordan\\", an enclave smaller than the one outlined in the Allon Plan, and, unlike the provisions of the Allon Plan, internal security responsibilities would fall on the Israeli military in cooperation with Arab police.May 1973 cable, paragraphs 2, 3c, 4a  Gaza  In the initial version of the Allon Plan, he envisioned the Gaza Strip being annexed to Israel. In a subsequent revision of the plan, however, Allon conceived of Gaza as part of a Jordanian-Palestinian state.The Palestinian People: A History, p. 287. Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S.

Strack. Hermann Leberecht Strack (6 May 1848 ‚Äì 5 October 1922) was a German Protestant theologian and orientalist; born in Berlin.  Biography  Since 1877 he was assistant professor of Old Testament exegesis and Semitic languages at the University of Berlin. He was the foremost Christian authority in Germany on Talmudic and rabbinic literature, and studied rabbinics under Steinschneider. Since the reappearance of anti-Semitism in Germany, Strack had been the champion of the Jews against the attacks of such men as Hofprediger Adolf Stoecker, Professor August Rohling, and others. In 1885 Strack became the editor of Nathanael. Zeitschrift f√ºr die Arbeit der Evangelischen Kirche an Israel, published at Berlin; and in 1883 he founded the Institutum Judaicum, which aimed at the conversion of Jews to Christianity. In the beginning of his career the Prussian government sent Strack to St. Petersburg to examine the Bible manuscripts there; on this occasion he examined also the antiquities of the Firkovich collection, which he declared to be forgeries. This claim was found to be untrue: the Firkovich collection is closely related to Cairo Geniza material found by Solomon Schechter.

It is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., and licensed as Clear Channel Broadcasting Licenses. The studios and offices are in the 50 Penn Place Building on the northwest side of Oklahoma City. KTOK is powered at 5,800 watts, using a directional antenna at all times. Because AM 1000 is a clear channel frequency reserved for Class A WMVP Chicago, KOMO Seattle and XEOY Mexico City, KTOK's nighttime signal must protect those stations. The transmitter is located in Moore, Oklahoma, off NE 25th Street. KTOK programming is also heard on co-owned 96.1 KXXY's HD radio secondary channel and on the iHeartRadio app. Programming KTOK has two local talk shows each weekday, both hosted by Lee Matthews, 6 to 8 a.m. and 5 to 7 p.m. The rest of the weekday schedule is made up of nationally syndicated conservative talk shows, mostly from co-owned Premiere Networks. They include Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, \\"Coast to Coast AM with George Noory\\" and \\"This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal.\\" Weekends feature programs on money, health, home repair, real estate and guns.

It signed on the air on January 27, 1927, owned by the Full Gospel Church in Oklahoma City.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 31, 1927, page 3. By the 1930s, the station was owned by the Oklahoma Broadcasting Company. It broadcast on 1370 kilocycles and was powered at 100 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 50 KGFG's studios were housed in the Cotton Exchange Building. The call letters were changed to KTOK on February 17, 1937.FCC History Cards With WKY as an NBC Red Network station and KOMA carrying the CBS Radio Network, KTOK first became a network affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System. But by the 1940s, it had switched to the NBC Blue Network (later ABC). 1940s and 50s In 1941, with the enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), KTOK moved to 1400 kHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1942 page 168 The power increased to 250 watts. But management wanted to make KTOK's signal competitive with 930 WKY (5,000 watts) and 1520 KOMA (50,000 watts). In the late 1940s, KTOK got permission from the Federal Communications Commission to move to 1000 kHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 246 The power increased to 5,000 watts by day, 1,000 watts at night. The station also added an FM companion. KTOK-FM signed on in 1946 at 104.3 MHz, powered at 43,000 watts. It mostly simulcast the AM station. But management saw little hope in making KTOK-FM profitable and gave it up after several years. By the 1950s, as network programming was moving from radio to television, KTOK switched to a full service, middle of the road (MOR) format of popular adult music, news and sports. As WKY and KOMA became youth-oriented Top 40 stations, KTOK began carrying sports from their former networks, NBC and CBS, including the World Series, championship fights and auto racing. An advertisement in the 1960 edition of the Broadcasting Yearbook said KTOK plays \\"toe-tapping music (no rock and roll) and all of the announcers are adults,\\" to contrast KTOK with the youthful Top 40 disc jockeys on WKY and KOMA.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-211 1960s - 1980s In the 1960s, the nighttime power increased to match the daytime power, 5,000 watts. But it had to use a complicated directional antenna system to make the higher nighttime power work, while still protecting other stations on AM 1000. In 1978, KTOK was acquired by the Insilco Broadcasting Group, which also bought an FM station at 102.7, KZUE, which aired an adult contemporary music format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-184 (102.7 today is Top 40 - CHR KJYO.) KTOK became an affiliate of the ABC Information Radio Network. KTOK gradually increased the talk programming and cut the MOR music programming. By the 1980s, it had become a talk station. 1990s - Today KTOK and its FM station were acquired in 1992 by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications (the forerunner to current owner iHeartMedia).Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-361 At one time, the news staff numbered 12. iHeart moved its Oklahoma City operations to 50 Penn Place off Northwest Expressway and Interstate 44. In the 2010s, the station got a slight power increase, going from 5,000 watts to 5,800 watts, day and night. It also got a simulcast on an HD Radio subchannel of co-owned 96.1 KXXY-FM.

Performed in front of an audience of 70,000 people, Live in Cuba is considered an historic event as it marks one of the few times that American musicians were permitted to play in Cuba. Despite the bureaucratic obstacles resulting from the ongoing United States embargo against Cuba, Audioslave received permission to perform in Havana and altered their tour schedule to play a free concert on May 6, 2005. With special approval by U.S. President George W. Bush and Cuban President Fidel Castro, the concert was organized through joint authorization of the United States Department of Treasury and the Cuban Institute of Music. At the time, guitarist Tom Morello declared that Audioslave was the first American rock and roll band to play a concert in Cuba. However, other American musical artists played in Cuba prior to 2005. At the Havana Jam in March 1979, Billy Joel, Stephen Stills, Weather Report, and several other American pop and jazz artists performed at Havana's Karl Marx Theatre. The Fabulous Titans, an American reggae/ska band, performed in Cuba in 1981. The DVD consists of footage from the concert performed at Havana's Plaza Anti Imperialista, plus a 37-minute documentary based on Audioslave's experiences in Cuba. The documentary focuses on the band's interactions with the Cuban people and highlights their appreciation of the island's arts and culture. The concert setlist consists mostly of Audioslave songs from the band's first two albums, Audioslave and Out of Exile. However, the band also performs several \\"Audioslave-ized\\" versions of songs from Soundgarden (\\"Spoonman\\" and \\"Outshined\\") and Rage Against the Machine (\\"Bulls on Parade\\" and \\"Sleep Now in the Fire\\"). After a triumphant concert that included moshing and crowd surfing, Tom Morello stated that Audioslave had \\"single-handedly demolished the rock and roll blockade against Cuba.\\" Although the Live in Cuba DVD was released five months after Audioslave's second studio album, Out of Exile, the DVD footage was recorded shortly before the album's May 23, 2005 release date. Because of this timing, the Live in Cuba DVD documents the debut of the track \\"Heaven's Dead.\\" Two versions of the DVD were released on October 11, 2005, a standard edition and a special edition.

It grows in coasts, natural forest, riparian zones, wetlands, moist and wet forests, bog margins, from sea level up to 2400 m elevation.Hosaka and Thistle, 1954 in Langeland and Burks, 1999 Description Rhodomyrtus tomentosa is an evergreen shrub growing up to 4 m (12 feet) tall. The leaves are opposite, leathery, 5‚Äì7 cm long and 2-3.5 cm broad, three-veined from the base, oval, obtuse to sharp pointed at the tip, glossy green above, densely grey or rarely yellowish-hairy beneath, with a wide petiole and an entire margin. The flowers are solitary or in clusters of two or three, 2.5‚Äì3 cm diameter, with five petals which are tinged white on the outside with purplish-pink or all pink. The fruit is edible, 10‚Äì15 mm long, purple, round, three or four-celled, capped with persistent calyx lobes, soft, with 40-45 seeds in a double row in each cell; seed dispersal is by frugivorous birds and mammals. Seed production and germination rates are high.Flora of Taiwan 6: 890, plate 443Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening 4: 79. Macmillan.Center for Natural Resources, 2003 Synonyms include Myrtus canescens Lour., Myrtus tomentosa Aiton, Rhodomyrtus parviflora Alston, and Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Wight. Common names include Ceylon hill gooseberry (English), Downy myrtle (English-Florida), Downy rose myrtle (English-Florida), Feijoa (French), Hill gooseberry (English), Hill guava (English), Isenberg bush (English-Hawaii), Myrte- groseille (French), Kemunting (Malaysia), Gangrenzi (China) and Rose myrtle (English-Florida). Cultivation and uses It has shown promise as a fire retardant species for use in fire breaks in the Himalayas.Ministry of Environment & Forests, 2003 It is a popular ornamental plant in gardens in tropical and subtropical areas, grown for its abundant flowers and sweet, edible fruit. The fruit can be made into pies and jams, or used in salads. In Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc, Vietnam, the fruits are used to produce a wine called r∆∞·ª£u sim, and are also made into jellies, or freshly canned with syrup for export. Management It has become an invasive species in some countries, spreading to form large, monospecific thickets that displace native flora and fauna. Areas especially affected include Florida, Hawaii, and French Polynesia. It is able to invade a range of habitats, from pine flatwoods to mangrove marshes. It grows in a wide range of soil types, including salty coastal soil, but is sensitive to heavy salt spray.Menninger, 1964 in Langeland and Burks, 1999 It is fire-adapted, meaning it is able to resprout prolifically after fire.Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants, 2001 This species invades the understory of native pinelands in Florida, forming dense monoculture thickets that displace native flora and fauna through overcrowding and competition. Has the potential to alter the natural fire regimes of invaded areas. A risk assessment of Rhodomyrtus tomentosa for Hawaii and other Pacific islands was prepared by the Kaulunani Urban Forestry Program and US Forest Service. The alien plant screening system is derived from Pheloung et al. (1999) with minor modifications for use in Pacific islands.Daehler et al. 2004 The result is a score of 8 and a recommendation of \\"Likely to cause significant ecological or economic harm in Hawaii and on other Pacific Islands as determined by a high WRA score, which is based on published sources describing species biology and behavior in Hawaii and/or other parts of the world.\\" In integrated management, seedlings can be removed manually. Mature shrubs may be felled using a chainsaw or brush cutter, and the stumps treated with a commercial herbicide.Stocker and Possley 2001 It was introduced to Florida and Hawaii in about 1920 (Degener, 1963 in Langeland and Burks, 1999). In Florida it has now spread to 17 counties (Center for Natural Resources, 2003). On Hawaii it was forming impenetrable thickets on Kauai and Hilo by the 1950s (Hosaka and Thistle, 1954 in Langeland and Burks, 1999). It is currently on the State of Hawaii noxious weed list (Meyer, 1998 in PIER, 2003).Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (PIER species info) Research was conducted at the University of Florida 1998-2000 to describe the ecology and determine effective control methods for this species. It is also a serious problem on Raiatea, French Polynesia (Meyer, 1998 in PIER, 2003).

History right right right The road was the first step in implementing the Allon Plan, one of the earliest Israeli initiatives to deal with the territory west of Jordan that was occupied in the 1967 Six-Day War. The plan called for the Israeli annexation of the narrow corridor of land along the west of the Jordan River up to the eastern slopes of the Samarian mountains in order to assure minimal strategical depth while relinquishing the rest of the West Bank to Arab-Jordanian control. The next step was to establish residential and agricultural settlements as well as military outposts along this strip of land in order to assure a minimal buffer zone that would hold up in the event of a Jordanian attack until Israeli Army reserve units could mobilize to the area. Between 1967 and 1977, the Israeli Labor Party governments created 21 settlements, mostly agricultural cooperatives in this area. The effects of this plan can be easily seen from the fact that almost all the settlements on the Allon Road (E.g.: Alon, Rimonim, Gitit) are on the east side.

Her husband was a guard of a watchtower in the rocky fort of Chitradurga. In the state of Karnataka, she is celebrated along with Abbakka Rani, Keladi Chennamma and Kittur Chennamma, as the foremost women warriors and patriots. She belonged to the Holayas (Chalavadi) community. Heroics of Obavva During the reign of Madakari Nayaka, the city of Chitradurga was besieged by the troops of Hyder Ali (1754-1779). A chance sighting of a man entering the Chitradurga fort through a hole in the rocks led to a plan by Hyder Ali to send his soldiers through that hole. The Guard (Kahale Mudda Hanuma, who was on duty near that hole) had gone home to have his lunch. During his meal he needed some water to drink, so his wife Obavva went to collect water in a pot from a pond which was near the hole in the rocks, halfway up the hill. She noticed the army trying to enter the fort through the hole. She used the Onake or pestle (a wooden long club meant for pounding paddy grains) to kill the soldiers one by one by hitting them on the head and then quietly moving the dead without raising the suspicions of the rest of the troops. Mudda Hanuma, Obavva's husband, returned from lunch, was shocked to see Obavva standing with a blood stained Onake and several of the enemies' dead bodies around her. Later, the same day, she was found dead either due to shock or having been killed by the enemy soldiers. Though her brave attempt saved the fort this time, Madakari could not resist the attack by Hyder Ali during 1779, when the fort of Chitradurga was lost to Hyder Ali.  Legacy  She is considered to be the epitome of Kannada female pride. The hole through which Hyder Ali's soldiers sneaked is called Onake Obavvana Kindi (kindi=hole) or Onake kindi. Her heroic effort is depicted in a famous song-sequence in Nagarahavu picture directed by Puttanna Kanagal. The sports stadium in Chitradurga - Veera Vanithe Onake Obavva Stadium, is named after her, and she is commemorated with a statue sculpted by Ashok Gudigar, erected in front of the District Commissioner‚Äôs office in Chittradurga  In popular culture  The 2019 Kannada language historical drama film Chitradurgada Onake Obavva, starring Kannada actress Tara as Onake Obavva.

He is the head talent scout at Br√∏ndby IF. His 17-year professional career was mainly associated with Br√∏ndby, for which he played in 470 official games ‚Äì being the club's top scorer in history ‚Äì and won ten major titles. Vilfort played for more than one decade with Denmark, and earned 77 caps. He was an essential figure in the nation's Euro 1992 conquest, and represented the country in three European Championships. Club career Born in the Copenhagen-quarter of Valby, Vilfort started playing football as a boy in Skovlunde IF, usually as a striker. He moved to Boldklubben Frem in 1981, appearing in four top division seasons with the club. After spending the 1985‚Äì86 campaign in France with Lille OSC ‚Äì only one Ligue 1 goal, club finished in tenth position ‚Äì Vilfort returned to his country and signed for defending champions Br√∏ndby IF, where he would play out the rest of his career as an attacking midfielder; in the 1986‚Äì87 European Cup, the first-ever European competition participation for the team, he scored two goals to help them reach the third round. 1991 was an outstanding year for Vilfort: he helped Br√∏ndby reach the semi-final in the UEFA Cup, appeared in 55 league games in the 1991 Danish Superliga and the 1991‚Äì92 Danish Superliga combined ‚Äì the latter had been recently created ‚Äì and scored nine times, going on to be named both Br√∏ndby's Player of the Year and Danish Player of the Year. From 1996 to 1998, veteran Vilfort won a further two Danish championships with Br√∏ndby. His contract expired on 1 June 1998 after the last game of the 1997‚Äì98 campaign, where he scored the winning goal (a flying header) in a 1‚Äì0 win against Odense BK; at the time, only Bjarne Jensen had played more games than him for the club (556), and he would only be overtaken by Per Nielsen more than one decade later. His 78 league goals were second only to Bent Christensen, but he ranked first in overall goals scored for the organization, at 110. Following his retirement at nearly 36, Vilfort became the head of Br√∏ndby's youth system, where his sons Mikkel and Kasper would also play. The club's home ground, Br√∏ndby Stadium, was nicknamed by its fans Vilfort Park. International career Vilfort made his debut for Denmark on 5 October 1983, in a 0‚Äì1 defeat against Poland for the 1984 Summer Olympics qualification. He played twice for the national team at UEFA Euro 1988, in an eventual group stage exit. In the Euro 1992 tournament in Sweden, Vilfort was a nuclear unit for the Danes, being one of the few offensive players in the team's otherwise defensive strategy. He played four of five matches in the competition, having to leave training camp to visit his leukemia-stricken 7-year-old daughter whose condition was deteriorating, thus missing the group stage decider against France (2‚Äì1 win).

The species is also known as Blackwood, hickory, mudgerabah, Tasmanian blackwood, or blackwood acacia. Acacia melanoxylon R. Br. ex Ait. f. foliage and seeds with elaiosomes Acacia melanoxylon R. Br. ex Ait. f. seeds Timber Acacia melanoxylon is valued for its decorative timber which may be used in cabinets, musical instruments and in boatbuilding. Appearance Sapwood may range in colour from straw to grey-white with clear demarcation from the heartwood. The heartwood is golden to dark brown with chocolate growth rings. The timber is generally straight grained but may be wavy or interlocked. Quartersawn surfaces may produce an attractive fiddleback figure. The wood is lustrous and possesses a fine to medium texture. The name of the wood may refer to dark stains on the hands of woodworkers, caused by the high levels of tannin in the timber. Properties Acacia melanoxylon timber has a density of approximately 660 kg/m3 and is strong in compression, resistant to impact and is moderately stiff. It is moderately blunting to work with tools and bends well. It may be nailed or screwed with ease, but gluing may produce variable results. The wood is easily stained and produces a high-quality finish. Australian blackwood seasons easily with some possible cupping when boards are inadequately restrained. The timber produces little movement once seasoned. The timber may be attacked by furniture beetles, termites and powder-post beetles (sapwood). It is resistant to effective preservative treatments. Acacia melanoxylon older bark  Invasive species  It has been introduced to many countries for forestry plantings and as an ornamental tree. It now is present in Africa, Asia, Europe, Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, South America and the United States. It is a declared noxious weed species in South Africa and is a pest in Portugal's Azores Islands. It was also recently listed by the California Invasive Plant Council (Cal-IPC) as an invasive weed that may cause limited impact (Knapp 2003). Its use as a street tree is being phased out in some locales because of the damage it often causes to pavements and underground plumbing. In some regions of Tasmania, blackwood is now considered a pest.  Uses  Indigenous Australians derive an analgesic from the tree.Analgesic Plants Australian New Crops Newsletter It was also used to make spear-throwers and shields. The wood has many uses including wood panels, furniture, fine cabinetry, tools, boats, inlayed boxes and wooden kegs. It is approximately the same quality as walnut, and is well-suited for shaping with steam. The bark has a tannin content of about 20%.Google Books Select Extra-tropical Plants Readily Eligible for Industrial Culture Or Naturalization By Ferdinand von Mueller It may also be used for producing decorative veneers. The tree's twigs and bark are used to poison fish as a way of fishing. This tree can also be used as a fire barrier plant, amongst other plants, in rural situations. Plain and figured Australian blackwood is used in musical instrument making (in particular guitars, drums, Hawaiian ukuleles, violin bows and organ pipes), and in recent years has become increasingly valued as a substitute for koa wood.

Semiochemical communication can be divided into two broad classes: communication between individuals of the same species (intraspecific) or communication between different species (interspecific). It is usually used in the field of chemical ecology to encompass pheromones, allomones, kairomones, attractants and repellents. Many insects, including parasitic insects, use semiochemicals. Pheromones are intraspecific signals that aid in finding mates, food and habitat resources, warning of enemies, and avoiding competition. Interspecific signals known as allomones and kairomones have similar functions. In nature= Pheromone  A pheromone (from Greek phero \\"to bear\\" + hormone from Greek ‚Äì \\"impetus\\") is a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers a social response in members of the same species. Pheromones are chemicals capable of acting outside the body of the secreting individual to impact the behavior of the receiving individual. There are alarm pheromones, food trail pheromones, sex pheromones, and many others that affect behavior or physiology. Their use among insects has been particularly well documented. In addition, some vertebrates and plants communicate by using pheromones. A notable example of pheromone usage to indicate sexual receptivity in insects can be seen in the female Dawson's burrowing bee, which uses a particular mixture of cuticular hydrocarbons to signal sexual receptivity to mating, and then another mixture to indicate sexual disinterest. These hydrocarbons, in association with other chemical signals produced in the Dufour's gland, have been implicated in male repulsion signaling as well. The term \\"pheromone\\" was introduced by Peter Karlson and Martin L√ºscher in 1959, based on the Greek word pherein (to transport) and hormone (to stimulate). They are also sometimes classified as ecto-hormones. German Biochemist Adolf Butenandt characterized the first such chemical, Bombykol (a chemically well-characterized pheromone released by the female silkworm to attract mates).  Allomone  An allomone is any chemical substance released by an individual of one species that affects the behavior of a member of another species to the benefit of the originator but not the receiver. Production of allomones is a common form of defense, such as by plant species against insect herbivores or prey species against predators. Sometimes species produce the sex pheromones of the organisms they exploit as prey or pollinators (such as bolas spiders and some orchids). The term \\"Allomone\\" was proposed by Brown, Eisner, and Whittaker to denote those substances which confer an advantage upon the emitter.  Kairomone  A kairomone is a semiochemical, emitted by an organism, which mediates interspecific interactions in a way that benefits an individual of another species which receives it, without benefitting the emitter. Two main ecological cues are provided by kairomones; they generally either indicate a food source for the receiver, or give warning of the presence of a predator. Often a pheromone may be utilized as a kairomone by a predator or parasitoid to locate the emitting organism.  Synomone  A synomone is an interspecific semiochemical that is beneficial to both interacting organisms, the emitter and receiver, e.g. floral synomone of certain Bulbophyllum species (Orchidaceae) attracts fruit fly males (Tephritidae: Diptera) as pollinators. In this true mutualistic inter-relationship, both organisms gain benefits in their respective sexual reproductive systems ‚Äì i.e. orchid flowers are pollinated and the Dacini fruit fly males are rewarded with a sex pheromone precursor or booster. The floral synomone, also acts as a reward to pollinators, is either in the form of a phenylpropanoid (e.g. methyl eugenol) or a phenylbutanoid (e.g. raspberry ketone and zingerone). Human use The goals of using semiochemicals in pest control are # to monitor pest populations to determine if control is warranted and # to alter the behavior of the pest or its enemies to the detriment of the pest. In general, the advantages of using semiochemicals are ## they have adverse effects only on target pests, ## they are relatively nontoxic and required in low amounts, ## they are nonpersistent and environmentally safe ## they appear difficult for insects to develop resistance against. Monitoring of pest populations with pheromones is often integrated in management programs.

He was born in Duns Castle, Berwickshire. During his service in the Royal Navy he visited Alexandria, Egypt, in 1818. In 1824 he met Joseph Bonomi in Rome, whom he hired as an artist and who accompanied Hay to Egypt. They stayed in Egypt from November 1824 until 1828, and 1829 to 1834, recording monuments and inscriptions, and making a large number of architectural plans. His manuscripts are now primarily in the British Library, and many of his plaster casts in the British Museum. In May 1828 Hay visited Malta, where he married Kalitza Psaraki, the daughter of the chief magistrate of Apodhulo, Crete; Hay had earlier rescued her from the slave market in Alexandria. After his death in East Lothian, Scotland, in 1863, Hay's collection of Egyptian antiquities was sold to the British Museum, though some objects were purchased by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1872.

Countless visitors from all over the world have taken part, or have been spectators of the \\"Landshuter Hochzeit 1475\\", a pageant held in Landshut, Bavaria (Germany). More than 2,000 participants in medieval costumes bring the festival to life to recreate the Late Middle Ages. It commemorates the wedding between Hedwig (also known as Jadvyga Jogailaitƒó in Lithuanian), the Polish King's and Lithuanian duke daughter, and George, the son of the Duke of Bavaria at Landshut. The original medieval wedding is re-enacted every four years, and everyone gets carried away with medieval jousting, pageantry, feasting and wedding processions for a short period in the summer. Hedwig Jagiellon, possibly by Mair von Landshut  History  George the Rich, painted well after his death. The Cathedral of Landshut The festival is held in memory of the wedding between George of Bavaria, the son of the Bavarian duke, and Hedwig Jagiellon, daughter of King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland, in 1475. The wedding was negotiated in 1474 in Krak√≥w through legations. The marriage was important because it was seen as a strong alliance against the Ottoman Turks. At the time, most royal marriages were not entered into because of love, but because of political motivations. It took the bride two months to travel to Landshut, where she was received by princes and bishops. The bridal pair were married in St. Martin's Church, and the service was officiated by Salzburg's Archbishop Bernhard von Rohr. Afterwards the bridal procession proceeded through the Old Town to the Town Hall. Ten thousand people are said to have attended the affair and they were provided food and drink by the young duke's father. Livestock eaten at the original festival: * 320 bullocks * 1,500 sheep * 1,300 lambs * 500 calves * 40,000 chickens The historic event is notable for its detailed records that yield a complete chronicle of the wedding days and which allows the re- enactment to have a touch of realism. The exact recordings can be explained from the historical context with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 which led into a longer period of growth of the Ottoman Empire. The marriage of the Polish princess with George \\"the Rich\\" was very profitable for the Polish king - the 32,000 Guilder bride wealth he received would be worth about 6.5 million euros in modern currency.  Recreation  The original motivation for the festival dates back to the foundation of the German Reich in 1871 which furthered German national pride. In the years 1876 to 1880 the Landshut town hall was renovated and in the years 1880 to 1882 the celebration room in the town hall was given paintings depicting the Landshut Wedding of 1475, as this very room was used as the dance hall for the festivities at that time. From these images the idea arose among citizens to recreate the event and finally the restaurant owner Georg Trippel and the factory owner Joseph Linnbrunner founded a society \\"Die F√∂rderer\\" in 1902. The first Landshut Wedding recreation took place in 1903, only one year after the creation of the society, and largely took the form of a public play performed by 145 citizens taking on a role. The Landshut Wedding play was subsequently presented annually from 1903 to 1914 (paused during World War I) and 1922 to 1938 (paused during World War II). During this time the number of actors involved increased to 2000. The Landshut Wedding became a triennial event from 1950 to 1968 and from 1975 to 1981. Since 1985 the Landshut Wedding has taken place every four years. The number of members of \\"Die F√∂rderer\\" society rose from 855 to 7146 during the years 1973 to 2013.https://www.landshuter- hochzeit.de/growth-of-the-members.html The renewed interest in medieval history made the event a major success in terms of tourism. Today the 60,000 or so inhabitants of Landshut welcome 600,000 to 700,000 visitors during the three weeks of the festivities, with some 120,000 visitors watching the bridal procession. The sponsors are able to collect money in the range of 3.5 million euros to allow for the event to take place. However, the real heroes of the \\"Landshuter Hochzeit\\" are the local citizens who act variously as bishops, aristocrats, bride and bridegroom. Without these people, the festival could not take place. The actors are chosen from a commission of the \\"Die F√∂rderer\\". Every person who wants to become a member of this association and who wants to take part in this big event has to live near Landshut. However, it is not only the actors who delve into the medieval times. It is customary among Landshut males to let the hair grow longer in the months before the event to match the medieval fashion better. Every citizen of Landshut will dress in medieval garments during festival days (even wrist watches are frowned upon) and the city‚Äôs decoration is retrofitted to a great extent. This of course means that the city becomes a pedestrian-only zone; visitors approaching by car are informed of this at a 50 km perimeter around the town. Due to the great pains that the festival organisers and local participants take in ensuring the authenticity of historical clothing and other personal items (such as weapons and armour), visitors are not permitted to wear medieval-themed outfits, but are invited to join in the celebrations dressed in contemporary \\"civvies\\". Along with the growing fascination for the Middle Ages in the late 20th century the Landshut Wedding has become a well-known medieval festival with great impact on the region‚Äôs economics as well as its cultural traditions and aspects of living history. The next procession is scheduled for 2021.

She was the daughter of Siddappa Shettar, a native merchantamar chitra katha vol 793 of Sagara, Karnataka. Keladi Kingdom (also known as Bednur and Ikkeri), was formed after the fall of Vijayanagara Empire. Chennamma married King Somashekara Nayaka in 1667 CE. After Somashekhara Nayaka's death in 1677, Chennamma efficiently handled the administration of the Keladi Nayaka dynasty. During her reign of 25 years, she repelled the advance of the Mughal Army led by Aurangzeb from her military base in the kingdom of Keladi located in Sagara, Karnataka, India. She adopted Basavappa Nayaka, one of her close relatives who succeeded as Hiriya Basappa Nayaka. She also rendered a trade agreement with the Portuguese involving commodities like pepper and rice. She was given the epithet \\"the Pepper Queen\\" or \\"Raina da Pimenta\\" by the Portuguese. She also permitted Portuguese to establish churches at Mirjan, Honnavara, Chandravara and Kalyanpura. In the state of Karnataka, she is celebrated along with Abbakka Rani, Kittur Chennamma, Belawadi Mallamma and Onake Obavva, as the foremost women warriors and patriots.  Attack by Aurangazeb  She provided shelter to Rajaram Chhatrapati, son of Shivaji who was fleeing from the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a meeting with her cabinet and treated Rajaram with respect, but Aurangazeb attacked Keladi. Keladi Chennamma fought the war without defeat and battle with Mughals ended in a treaty. A subordinate of Keladi Kingdom, Sadasiva of Swadi also helped Rajaram through a loan. Keladi kingdom was probably the last to lose autonomy to Mysore rulers and subsequently to British. Her cabinet was headed by Timmanna Naik, who was the descendant of a commander of Vijayanagra.

Early life A Milroy, Minnesota native, Rawlings graduated with an economics degree from Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He became a flying cadet in February 1929. Almost 25 years to the day later, he became one of the USAF's youngest generals, confirmed for a fourth star at 49. He had also by then earned an MBA from Harvard University. Air comptroller pioneer In November 1946, Symington named Rawlings as air comptroller, helping to organize the office. The position was so successful and struck such a note, the United States adopted the idea of a comptroller for all three services. In 1951, Rawlings became commander of Air Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, leading USAF's procurement and logistics efforts for seven years. Air Force Chief of Staff Thomas D. White credited him with spectacular increases in the effectiveness of the Air Force logistics, accomplished through new management methods, concepts, and philosophy, and thus the Air Force has been able to match the tempo of the jet, missile, and space era. Rawlings was a command pilot and combat and aircraft observer, whose decorations included the Distinguished Service Medal and Distinguished Flying Cross, which he received in 1930 for his role in the rescue of an aircrew downed in the Pacific. He also received the Soldier's Medal in 1954 for rescuing his pilot who was lying underneath a B-17 Flying Fortress that caught fire after landing at Wright-Patterson. Later life After retiring from USAF in 1959, he went on to a career with General Mills, rising to become president and board chairman. During his second career, General Rawlings introduced corporate social responsibility and adapted the Delphi method for corporate strategic planning. In 1997, Rawlings died in Auburn, Washington at age 93. Legacy In 1981 the Air Force Association (AFA) and AEF in 1981 established the Gen.. Edwin W. Rawlings Award initially to recognize energy conservation achievements within USAF. Now the award recognizes and outstanding technician or manager in environmental matters. The AFA's Gen. E. W. Rawlings Chapter was chartered in Saint Paul in August 1982. Eugene M. Zuckert, Secretary of the Air Force from 1961 to 1965, credits Rawlings with building a \\"mature, business-like\\" image for the newly established Air Force. Zuckert said Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington asked him in 1945 why he had to \\"send out a search party\\" whenever he needed Army Air Forces statistics, Zuckert remembered a Rawlings memo suggesting the creation of a comptroller position and passed the idea on to Symington. According to Zuckert, the methods developed by Rawlings constituted \\"a very important step in the development of a postwar Air Force.\\" External links *Air Force Association USAF Mentorship Artist profile *American Airpower Biography: A Survey of the Field Category:1904 births Category:1997 deaths Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:General Mills Category:Hamline University alumni Category:Harvard Business School alumni Category:People from Redwood County, Minnesota Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Soldier's Medal Category:Systems thinking Category:United States Air Force generals ","title":"Edwin W.

Implementing TE gives priority to mandatory access control (MAC) over discretionary access control (DAC). Access clearance is first given to a subject (e.g. process) accessing objects (e.g. files, records, messages) based on rules defined in an attached security context. A security context in a domain is defined by a domain security policy. In the Linux security module (LSM) in SELinux, the security context is an extended attribute. Type enforcement implementation is a prerequisite for MAC, and a first step before multilevel security (MLS) or its replacement multi categories security (MCS). It is a complement of role-based access control (RBAC). Control Type enforcement implies fine-grained control over the operating system, not only to have control over process execution, but also over domain transition or authorization scheme. This is why it is best implemented as a kernel module, as is the case with SELinux. Using type enforcement is a way to implement the FLASK architecture. Access Using type enforcement, users may (as in Microsoft Active Directory) or may not (as in SELinux) be associated with a Kerberos realm, although the original type enforcement model implies so. It is always necessary to define a TE access matrix containing rules about clearance granted to a given security context, or subject's rights over objects according to an authorization scheme. Security Practically, type enforcement evaluates a set of rules from the source security context of a subject, against a set of rules from the target security context of the object. A clearance decision occurs depending on the TE access description (matrix). Then, DAC or other access control mechanisms (MLS / MCS, ‚Ä¶) apply. History Type enforcement was introduced in the Secure Ada Target architecture in the late 1980s with a full implementation developed in the Logical Coprocessing Kernel (LOCK) system.See Earl Boebert Oral history interview 28 April 2015, Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota>Richard Y. Kain Oral history interview, 27 May 2015, Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota The Sidewinder Internet Firewall was implemented on a custom version of Unix that incorporated type enforcement. A variant called domain type enforcement was developed in the Trusted MACH system. The original type enforcement model stated that labels should be attached to subject and object: a ‚Äúdomain label‚Äù for a subject and a ‚Äútype label‚Äù for an object. This implementation mechanism was improved by the FLASK architecture, substituting complex structures and implicit relationship. Also, the original TE access matrix was extended to other structures: lattice-based, history-based, environment-based, policy logic‚Ä¶ This is a matter of implementation of TE by the various operating systems. In SELinux, TE implementation does not internally distinguish TE-domain from TE-types. It should be considered a weakness of TE original model to specify detailed implementation aspects such as labels and matrix, especially using the terms ‚Äúdomain‚Äù and ‚Äútypes‚Äù which have other, more generic, widely accepted meanings.

The lake and wetlands of Ichkeul National Park are an important stopping-over point for hundreds of thousands of migrating birds each year. Among the lake's visitors are ducks, geese, storks, and pink flamingoes. Dam construction on the lake's feeder rivers has produced major changes to the ecological balance of the lake and wetlands. History Lake Ichkeul Because dams have sharply reduced the freshwater inflow to the lakes and marshes, the reedbeds, sedges, and other fresh-water plant species have been replaced with salt-loving plants. These changes have produced a sharp reduction in the migratory bird populations, which depend on the mix of plants that used to exist. According to the UNESCO Website, the Tunisian government has undertaken some steps to retain freshwater and reduce salinity, and the lake was removed from UNESCO's list of World heritage in danger in 2006. However some reports from the World Conservation Union suggest that the salinity has already become excessively high and the possibility for rehabilitation may be rapidly disappearing. Ichkeul National Park Ichkeul National Park is a World Heritage Site located in the north of Tunisia, 25 km southwest of Bizerte and 15 km north of Mateur. The park has been on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 1980, and between 1996 and 2006 the park has also been on the group's list of World Heritage in Danger.

Grids of this type appear on graph paper and may be used in finite element analysis, finite volume methods, finite difference methods, and in general for discretization of parameter spaces. Since the derivatives of field variables can be conveniently expressed as finite differences, structured grids mainly appear in finite difference methods. Unstructured grids offer more flexibility than structured grids and hence are very useful in finite element and finite volume methods. Each cell in the grid can be addressed by index (i, j) in two dimensions or (i, j, k) in three dimensions, and each vertex has coordinates (i\\\\cdot dx, j\\\\cdot dy) in 2D or (i\\\\cdot dx, j\\\\cdot dy, k\\\\cdot dz) in 3D for some real numbers dx, dy, and dz representing the grid spacing. Related grids A Cartesian grid is a special case where the elements are unit squares or unit cubes, and the vertices are points on the integer lattice. A rectilinear grid is a tessellation by rectangles or rectangular cuboids (also known as rectangular parallelepipeds) that are not, in general, all congruent to each other. The cells may still be indexed by integers as above, but the mapping from indexes to vertex coordinates is less uniform than in a regular grid. An example of a rectilinear grid that is not regular appears on logarithmic scale graph paper. A skewed grid is a tessellation of parallelograms or parallelepipeds. (If the unit lengths are all equal, it is a tessellation of rhombi or rhombohedra.)

OED Online. September 2012. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/241005?redirectedFrom=kairomone (accessed 3 October 2012).) is a semiochemical, emitted by an organism, which mediates interspecific interactions in a way that benefits an individual of another species which receives it and harms the emitter. This \\"eavesdropping\\" is often disadvantageous to the producer (though other benefits of producing the substance may outweigh this cost, hence its persistence over evolutionary time). The kairomone improves the fitness of the recipient and in this respect differs from an allomone (which is the opposite: it benefits the producer and harms the receiver) and a synomone (which benefits both parties). The term is mostly used in the field of entomology (the study of insects). Two main ecological cues are provided by kairomones; they generally either indicate a food source for the receiver, or the presence of a predator, the latter of which is less common or at least less studied. Predators use them to find prey An example of this can be found in the Ponderosa Pine tree (Pinus ponderosa), which produces a terpene called myrcene when it is damaged by the Western pine beetle. Instead of deterring the insect, it acts synergistically with aggregation pheromones which in turn act to lure more beetles to the tree. Specialist predatory beetles find bark beetles (their prey) using the pheromones the bark beetles produce. In this case the chemical substance produced is both a pheromone (communication between bark beetles) and a kairomone (eavesdropping). This was discovered accidentally when the predatory beetles and other enemies were attracted to insect traps baited with bark beetle pheromones. Pheromones of different kinds may be exploited as kairomones by receivers. The German wasp, Vespula germanica, is attracted to a pheromone produced by male Mediterranean fruit flies (Ceratitis capitata) when the males gather for a mating display, causing the death of some. In contrast, it is the alarm pheromone (used to communicate the presence of a threat) of an ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus) that a spider predator is attracted to. Prey use them to adjust to predators Some prey make use of chemicals originating from predators, using these cues as an indicator of the level of predation risk and changing their morphology if need be. Changes in morphology caused by predator presence is known as predator-induced polyphenism, and occurs across a variety of animals. For example, Daphnia cucullata show formation of \\"helmets\\" when exposed to predators or the water they have lived in. Their predators include cladocerans (such as Leptodora kindtii) and larvae of Chaoborus flavicans, a midge. They respond to these kairomones by doubling the size of their helmets, a protective structure. These changes in morphology make them safer from predators. Mice are instinctively afraid of the smell of their natural predators, including cats and rats. This occurs even in laboratory mice that have been isolated from predators for hundreds of generations. When the chemical cues responsible for the fear response were purified from cat saliva and rat urine, two homologous protein signals were identified: Fel d 4 (Felis domesticus allergen 4), the product of the cat Mup gene, and Rat n 1 (Rattus norvegicus allergen 1), the product of the rat Mup13 gene. Mice are fearful of these major urinary proteins (Mups) even when they are made in bacteria, but mutant animals that are unable to detect the Mups show no fear of rats, demonstrating their importance in initiating fearful behaviour. It is not known exactly how Mups from different species initiate disparate behaviours, but mouse Mups and predator Mups have been shown to activate unique patterns of sensory neurons in the nose of recipient mice. This implies the mouse perceives them differently, via distinct neural circuits. The pheromone receptors responsible for Mup detection are also unknown, though they are thought be members of the V2R receptor class. Applications Like pheromones (communication chemicals used within a species), kairomones can be utilized as an 'attracticide' to lure a pest species to a location containing pesticide. However, they might also be used to lure desired species. Kairomones produced by the hosts of parasitic wasps have been used in an attempt to attract them and keep them around in crops where they reduce herbivory, but this could instead result in fewer attacks on the herbivous pest if the applied kairomone distracts them from finding real hosts. For example, studies have shown that kairomones are effective in attracting female African sugarcane borers to deposit eggs on dead leaf material.Leslie, G.W. (June 1990). \\"THE INFLUENCE OF DEAD LEAF MATERIAL ON THE OVIPOSITION BEHAVIOUR OF ELDANA SACCHARINA (LEPIDOPTERA: PYRALIDAE) IN SUGARCANE\\" (PDF).

Greek East and Latin West are terms used to distinguish between the two parts of the Greco-Roman world, specifically the eastern regions where Greek was the lingua franca (Anatolia, Greece, the Balkans, the Levant and Egypt) and the western parts where Latin filled this role (The Maghreb, Central Europe, Gaul, Iberia, Italy and the British Isles). During the Roman Empire a divide had persisted between Latin- and Greek-speaking areas; this divide was encouraged by administrative changes in the empire's structure between the 3rd and 5th centuries, which led ultimately to the establishment of separate administrations for the Eastern and Western halves of the Empire. The Roman Empire in 330 AD. After the fall of the Western Part, pars occidentalis, of the Empire, the terms Greek East and Latin West are applied to areas that were formerly part of the Eastern or Western Parts of the Empire, and also to areas that fell under the Greek or Latin cultural sphere but that had never been part of the Roman Empire. This has given rise to two modern dichotomies. The first is the split of Chalcedonian Christianity that developed in Europe between Western Christianity (the forerunner of Roman Catholicism which Protestantism split from in 1517) and Eastern Orthodoxy. Second, Europeans have traditionally viewed the Greco Roman Mediterranean (extending from Spain to Syria) as having an East/West cultural split. Cultures associated with the historical Romance, Germanic, Scandinavian, Hungarians, Finns, Balts, Celts, West Slavs and the historical Western Churches (Central and Western Europe) have traditionally been considered Western; these cultures adopted Latin as their lingua franca in the Middle Ages. Cultures associated with the Eastern Roman Empire and Russian Empire (Greeks, Orthodox Slavs, Romanians, Georgians and to a lesser extent Thracian and Anatolian Turks, Albanians and Bosniaks) have traditionally been considered Eastern; these cultures all used Greek or Old Church Slavonic as a lingua franca during the early Middle Ages.  Use with regard to the Roman Empire  In the classical context, Greek East refers to the provinces and client states of the Roman Empire in which the lingua franca was primarily Greek. This region included the whole Greek peninsula with some other northern parts in the Balkans, the provinces around the Black Sea, those of the Bosphorus, all of Asia Minor (in the loosest possible sense, to include Cappadocia and extending to Armenia Minor), Magna Graecia (southern part of the Italian peninsula and Sicily), and the other provinces along the eastern rim of the Mediterranean Sea (Judea, Syria, Cyrenaica and Egypt). These Roman provinces had been Greek colonies or Greek-ruled states during the Hellenistic period, i.e. until the Roman conquests. At the start of late antiquity, beginning with the reorganization of the empire's provincial divisions during the reign of Diocletian (ruled 284‚Äì305), the expression \\"Greek East\\" evolved to stand in contradistinction to Latin West. Thereafter, Greek East refers to the Greek-speaking provinces mentioned above (after 395 mostly in the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire) in contradistinction to the provinces in Western Europe, Italia (excluding the Catepanate of Italy, where they still spoke Greek) and Northwest Africa (after 395 in the Latin-speaking Western Roman Empire).Cf. Fishwick, Duncan. The imperial cult in the Latin West: studies in the ruler cult of the Western provinces of the Roman Empire. BRILL, 2002.  Use with regard to Christianity  Greek East and Latin West are terms used also to divide Chalcedonian Christianity into the Greek- speaking, Orthodox peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, centered on the Byzantine Empire, and the Latin-speaking Catholic peoples of Western Europe.Sherrard, Philip. The Greek East and the Latin West: a study in the Christian tradition. London: Oxford University Press, 1959; reprinted Limni [Greece]: Denise Harvey & Company, 1992 .Andrew Louth, Greek East and Latin West: The Church AD 691‚Äì1071 (St Vladimir's Seminary Press ) Here, Latin West applies to regions that were formerly part of the Western Roman Empire, specifically Italia, Gallia (Gaul), Hispania, Northwest Africa, and Britannia, but also to areas that had never been part of the Empire but which later came under the culture sphere of the Latin West, such as Magna Germania, Hibernia (Ireland), Caledonia (Scotland). In this sense, the term Latin came to refer to the liturgical and scholarly language of Western Europe, since many of these countries did not actually speak Latin. The term Greek varies in how it is applied. In the most narrow sense, after the rise of the Roman Empire it is only applied to the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Depending on the author it may also be applied to * Areas where the Greek language was the common scholarly and religious language during classical Roman times and the early Middle Ages, including Syria, Egypt, Palestine, etc. * Areas that have historically been in communion with the (formerly Byzantine) Eastern Orthodox Church, which includes Russia and much of Eastern Europe, but largely excludes Egypt, Syria, Armenia, etc. which largely opposed the influence of Constantinople having formed what are now called the Church of the East and Oriental Orthodoxy. The Romanians spoke a Romance language but followed the Byzantine Church. * Areas that were heavily culturally influenced by the Byzantine Empire, directly or indirectly, during the Middle Ages, including Eastern Europe and the Islamic Empires ** note: among Muslim historians, \\"Greek\\" and \\"Roman\\" are often categories specifically associated with Christians. Though the Sultanate of Rome and, later, the Ottoman Empire would adopt Byzantine titles and describe themselves as rulers of \\"Rome,\\" this was a geographic designation, much in the same way that the Ghaznavids or Delhi Sultans would be known as rulers of \\"Hindustan.\\" The term Latin has survived much longer as a unifying term for the West because the Latin language survived until very recently as a scholarly and liturgical language despite the fragmentation and religious changes in Western Europe. The Greek language, by contrast, died out somewhat quickly in the Arab lands, and the Slavic nations never fully embraced the language despite their long religious affiliation with the Eastern Romans/Byzantines.

It is among a cluster of stations in the market owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.. KGHM carries the syndicated Fox Sports Radio Network and also airs local high school and college sports. KGHM's transmitter is located blocks from the Oklahoma State Capitol. It broadcasts at 1,000 watts around the clock using a non-directional antenna. The studios and offices are located at the 50 Penn Place building on the Northwest side. History=KGCB/KOCY The station first signed on the air in 1922, making it among the first radio stations in Oklahoma City.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 246 It started as KGCB, a church-owned station. It was purchased in the late 1930s by Matthew Bonebrake - a former OPUBCO and WKY radio sales manager - who changed the call letters to KOCY. KOCY was a Mutual Broadcasting System network affiliate during the 1940s and early 1950s. It became Oklahoma City's first full-time Top 40 station in the mid-1950s. It was also the first radio station in the country to offer \\"News Every Hour - On the Hour\\". After 930 WKY and 1520 KOMA also switched to Top 40, with more powerful transmitters, KOCY management realized the station couldn't compete with the two new Top 40 outlets. KOCY had a \\"funeral\\" for its Top 40 sound, by giving away records in a coffin. It then switched to a middle of the road (MOR) format of popular adult music. Urban Music In the mid-1990s KGHM aired an Urban Contemporary format in the evenings and overnights as \\"The Groove 1340\\". In 2000, Clear Channel Communications went into an agreement with Perry Broadcasting to broadcast KVSP/1140 and its Urban format (See KRMP) on 1340 KEBC from 7 pm‚àí7 am as \\"The Power Jammin' Network\\" after AM 1140 signed off at sunset. Between 7am-7pm KGHM aired Regional Mexican programming directed at Oklahoma City's Mexican-American community. The agreement between Clear Channel and Perry Broadcasting discontinued when Perry purchased KRPT/103.5 in Anadarko, Oklahoma (See KVSP) and upgraded the station to target Oklahoma City, then moved KVSP's Urban format to the FM dial. The Regional Mexican format was ended as the station switched to a Talk radio format. \\"Keeping Everybody Country\\" KEBC's call letters were previously used for 94.7 KEBC, later a property also owned by Clear Channel. The station's slogan, \\"Keeping Everybody Country.\\" Ironically, KEBC's competitor at the time, KXXY-FM, simulcast their FM signal at 1340 AM. The call letters KEBC stood for Electronic Broadcasting Company which was the original ownership of 94.7 KEBC. KEBC originally had its offices and transmitter at the \\"Rambling Ranchstyle studios\\" in SE OKC before moving to 31st and Western to studio space owned by Ralph Tyler. Mounting debt to Tyler for rent and other financial obligation created a situation where Tyler became controlling owner of KEBC radio. After Ralph Tyler's controlling ownership of KEBC, the slogan Keep Everybody Country was formed on a suggestion from a friend of Ralph's. Sports Radio As a talk station in the early 2000s, KGHM simulcast some programming of sister station AM 1000 KTOK along with some original shows. In January 2007, Clear Channel flipped the station to \\"Fox Sports Radio 1340.\\" It later became \\"1340 The Game,\\" making it the fourth all- sports station in Oklahoma City. Former Dallas Cowboys play-by-play broadcaster David Garrett was KGHM's sports director. Garrett had worked as sports director for co-owned KTOK in the late 1980s. Garrett also hosted an afternoon sports talk show on KGHM from January 2007 to early 2008 and returned to hosting in late spring/early summer of 2008. Garrett was also did play-by-play for some on the Oklahoma City High School Football games that aired on KGHM as well. In the Spring 2013, KGHM & KTOK's sports director job went to Randy Renner, a former reporter for Oklahoma City CBS affiliate KWTV- TV. In mid March 2003, it was announced that then KEBC would carry the Oklahoma City Blazers hockey games for the remainder of the 2002-2003 Central Hockey League season and playoffs. KEBC also aired the Blazers radio talk show \\"Strictly Hockey Blazers Style\\", a weekly show that aired live every Monday night through out the Blazers season from the location of an Oklahoma City restaurant. It featured interviews with players, coach's, trainers and team staff. KEBC carried the Blazers again for the 2003‚Äì2004 season. In 2006, the Blazers returned to 1340 AM along with the Oklahoma City RedHawks baseball team after WKY 930 flipped from News/Talk to Spanish. The Blazers stayed on 1340 AM until the team folded in the Summer of 2009 after 17 seasons. KGHM carried selected games of the Oklahoma City Barons Hockey team from 2010-2011 thru the 2014‚Äì2015 seasons, when the team was discontinued. Whenever there were scheduling or programming conflicts with sister station and primary radio home of the Barons KXXY-FM. KOCY was also the station that carried the games of the original Oklahoma City Blazers Hockey Franchise in the original Central Hockey League from the late 1960s and through the late 1970s. For a time, local sports talk shows were simulcast with KREF 1400, also a Fox Sports Radio affiliate, in Norman, Oklahoma. For several years KGHM also carried University of Central Oklahoma Broncos Football and Men's & Women's Basketball games. KGHM also airs select Oklahoma State University Cowboys football games with local Oklahoma high school football games on Friday and Saturday nights. Some Oklahoma high school basketball games also aired. Friday Night Finals, a weekly two hour show of statewide high school football scores and highlights, aired on Friday nights. Game Day Saturday, a look at collage football games, specifically University of Oklahoma & Oklahoma State football was on the weekend schedule. Since 2003, and again from 2006-present, KGHM has carried the games of the Oklahoma City Dodgers Minor League Triple-A baseball team, the Pacific Coast League affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Starting with the 2015 Major League Baseball season, the station began carrying some games as part of the Los Angeles Dodgers radio network. In late 2018, KGHM's affiliation with the Los Angeles Dodgers radio network was not renewed, ending sixteen years of professional baseball airing on both stations.

It is located on the Karachi Harbour, between Kiamari, Manora, and Kakapir, and close to Karachi's main business district and several industrial areas. The geographic position of the port places it in close proximity to major shipping routes such as the Strait of Hormuz. The administration of the port is carried out by the Karachi Port Trust, which was established in 1857. History Karachi Port in 1906 - Farewell arch erected by the Karachi Port for the Royal visit of King George V The history of the port is intertwined with that of the city of Karachi. Several ancient ports have been attributed in the area including \\"Krokola\\", \\"Morontobara\\" (Woman's Harbour) (mentioned by Nearchus), Barbarikon (the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, and Debal (a city captured by the Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim in 712 CE). There is a reference to the early existence of the port of Karachi in the \\"Umdah\\", by the Arab navigator Sulaiman al Mahri (AD 1511), who mentions \\"Ras al Karazi\\" and \\"Ras Karashi\\" while describing a route along the coast from Pasni to Ras Karashi. Karachi is also mentioned in the sixteenth century Turkish treatise Mir'√¢t √ºl Mem√¢lik by the Ottoman captain Seydi Ali Reis, who warns sailors about whirlpools and advises them to seek safety in \\"Kaurashi\\" harbour if they found themselves drifting dangerously. In 1728 heavy rains silted up the harbour at Kharak, forcing merchants to relocate to the area of modern Karachi. In 1729, they built a new fortified town called Kolachi (also known as Kalachi-jo-Kun and Kolachi-jo- Goth) on high ground north of Karachi bay, surrounded by a high mud and timber-reinforced wall with gun-mounted turrets and two gates. The gate facing the sea was called \\"Kharadar\\" (salt gate), and the gate facing the Lyari River5 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Lyari (info about Lyari River) hamaralyari.com website, Retrieved 5 January 2018 was called \\"Mithadar\\" (sweet gate). From 1729 to 1783 the strategic location of Kolachi saw the town change hands several times between the Khans of Kalat and the rulers of Sind. In 1783, after two prolonged sieges the town fell to the Talpur Mirs of Sind, who constructed Manora Fort mounted with cannons on Manora island at the harbour entrance. alt= The British were concerned about Russian expansion towards the Arabian Sea, so in 1839 they occupied Karachi and later the whole of the Sindh. The port served as a landing point for troops during the First Afghan War. A number of British companies opened offices and warehouses in Karachi and the population increased rapidly. By 1852, Karachi was an established city with a population of 14,000 and a prosperous overseas trade. The modern port began to take shape in 1854, when the main navigation channel was dredged and a mole or causeway was constructed to link the main harbour with the rest of the city. This was followed by construction of Manora breakwater, Keamari Groyne, the Napier Mole Bridge and the Native Jetty Bridge. The construction of the wharves started in 1882, and by 1914 the East Wharf and the Napier Mole Boat Wharf were complete while 1927 and 1944, the West Wharf, the lighterage berths and the ship-repair berths were constructed between 1927 and 1944. By 1899 Karachi was the largest wheat and cotton exporting port in South Asia. The period between 1856 and 1872 saw a marked increase in trade, especially during the American Civil War when cotton from Sindh replaced American cotton as a raw material in the British textile industry and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Karachi was an important military base during the First World War (1914‚Äì18) because it was the first British Raj port of call for ships coming through the Suez Canal and was the gateway to Afghanistan and the Russian Empire. Karachi was again a military base and port for supplies to the Russian front during the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945). Facilities Image of the port facilities The port comprises a deep natural harbour with an 11 kilometre long approach channel which provides safe navigation for vessels up to . The main areas of port activity are two wharves; East Wharf with seventeen vessel berths and West Wharf with thirteen vessel berths. The maximum depth alongside the berths is currently 11.3 metres. The two wharves extend in opposite directions along the upper harbour ‚Äì the East Wharf northeast from Kiamari Island and the West Wharf southwest from Saddar town. The two wharves each include a container terminal: *Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT) opened in 1996 at West Wharf berths 28-30. It has a handling capacity of 300,000 TEUs per annum and handles container ships up to 11-metre draught. The total quay length is 600 metres divided into two container berths. The terminal is equipped with three Panamax cranes and one post-Panamax crane. *Pakistan International Bulk Terminal (PIBT) in 2002 at East Wharf berths 6-9. It has a handling capacity of 350,000 TEUs per annum and handles container ships up to 11.5-metre draught. The total quay length is 600 metres divided into two container berths. The terminal is equipped with two Panamax cranes. *KICT and PICT have a nearby competitor in the privately operated Al-Hamd International Container Terminal (AICT), which opened in 2001 at a site west of the Layari river. AICT is situated next to the Sindh Industrial Trading Estate, the new truck stand at Hawkes Bay Road and close to the RCD Highway, Super Highway and the future Layari Bypass. There are also three liquid cargo-handling berths (oil piers), two ship repair jetties and a shipyard and engineering facility. The shipyard carries out shipbuilding and repair for both commercial and military customers on a 29-hectare (70 acres) site at the West Wharf. The facilities include a large shipbuilding hall, three shipbuilding berths, two dry-docks and three foundries. Expansion The flow of cargo to and from the port is hampered by severe congestion in the harbour with several other maritime facilities located close to the port. Adjacent to the West Wharf is the Karachi Fishing Harbour, which is administered separately from the port and is the base for a fleet of several thousand fishing vessels. The West Wharf also hosts a ship repair facility and shipyard and a naval dockyard at the tip of the wharf, while to the south of the port are the Karachi Naval Base and the Kiamari Boat Club. The Port of Karachi also faces competition from a new private terminal located 5 kilometres to the west. In recent years the federal government has attempted to alleviate the increased congestion by constructing a second port in Karachi thirty kilometres to the east at Port Qasim and a third major port at Gwadar, about 650 kilometres west of Karachi. The Karachi Fishing Harbour has been upgraded recently, and a second fishing harbour has been built 18 kilometres away at Korangi. The transfer of some naval vessels to the new naval base at Ormara has brought about further reductions in congestion. Further deepening of the port has been planned by the Karachi Port Trust in order to enhance facilities. The channel is being dredged initially to 13.5 metres deep to cater for 12-metre draught vessels at all tides. At Kiamari Groyne, located at the outer tip of the harbour, dredging will be to 16.5 metres to enable vessels up to 300 metres long to dock. Other projects to expand the port include: *An increase the handling capacity of KICT from 300,000 TEUs to 400,000 TEUs per annum *Two new berths at KICT with 14 metres depth alongside and an additional 100,000 m¬≤ terminal/stacking area *Installation of modern facilities at PICT (completed in April 2004) *A new bulk cargo terminal at East Wharf *Reconstruction of the oldest oil pier to allow tankers of to berth *A new cargo village to cater for containers and general and bulk cargo *Reconstruction of the 100-year-old NMB Wharf to enhance the berthing of passenger vessels *The purchase of a new dredger, two hopper barges, two harbour tugs, two water barges, an anchor hoist vessel, two pilot boats, and a dredger tender *A new desalination plant to address the city's water shortage problem *A high Port Tower for commercial and recreational use including a revolving restaurant *The construction of a 500-acre (2 km¬≤) Port Town with 13,000 homes for port workers at nearby Hawkes Bay *A new Port Club at Chinna Creek adjacent to the East Wharf On 9 November 2007, the Karachi Port Trust signed a US$1 billion agreement with Hutchison Port Holdings to construct a new terminal called the \\"Pakistan Deep Water Container Port\\", which would begin operations by 2010, and would have ten berths capable of handling Super Post Panamax container ships. Environmental concerns The area around the harbour includes several mangrove forests which are constantly under threat from human activities. To the east of the port lies Chinna Creek, which covers about 6 km¬≤ and is dotted with mangrove islands. To the southwest of the port is another much larger mangrove forest in the bay formed by several islands and Manora breakwater; the river Layari flows into this bay, bringing waste from upstream suburbs. The beach immediately east of the harbour was the scene of a significant oil spillage when the Greek-registered Tasman Spirit ran aground on 28 July 2003. The environmental impact included large numbers of dead fish and turtles and damage to a key mangrove forest, as well as dozens of people suffering nausea. Labour relations The Karachi Dock Labour Board (KDLB) is responsible for labour relations between employees and the Karachi Port Trust. In October 2006, the Pakistan government decided to close down Karachi Dock Labour Board by the end of the year as part of its port strategy and under the National Trade Corridor (NTC) programme. The closure of KDLB would cost around Rs 4.2 billion ($70 million) to the national exchequer.

Life and career Nadel was born in Vienna, Austria the son of a lawyer. He started his education in music, entering the Musik Akademie and the Musikhistorisches Institut in Vienna in 1920. He also developed interests in philosophy and psychology. He went on to study the latter with Karl B√ºhler at the Psychologisches Institut at the University of Vienna, and the former with Moritz Schlick. On 11 November 1925 graduated with a doctorate, his thesis being \\"Zur Psychologie des Konsonanzerlebens\\". His career was at first in music. He served as an assistant conductor of the D√ºsseldorf Opera House and, in 1927, organized and conducted an opera company that toured Czechoslovakia performing Verdi and Puccini. On his return to Vienna he continued a career as a musician and began publishing on the topic as well. In 1930 published a book on musical typology entitled Der Duale Sinn der Music. and in 1931 he produced a biography of the Italian composer Ferruccio Benvenuto Busoni entitled simple Ferruccio Busoni, 1866-1924. Throughout this period Nadel served as an assistant at the Psychologisches Institut and grew more and more interested in ethnomusicology. He produced radio programs for Radio Vienna on music which included discussions of non-Western music, and in 1930 wrote a piece on the marimba. This transformed into an interest in the anthropology of Africa, which was encouraged by Diedrich Westermann, with whom Nadel studied the musicology of 'primitive peoples' at the Phonogrammarchiv in Berlin, and African languages at the University of Berlin. In 1932 Nadel was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship, allowing him to do post-graduate training in anthropological African field research. Nadel studied at the London School of Economics, supervised by Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski and C.G. Seligman. Nadel was one of three students‚Äîthe other being Meyer Fortes and Sjoerd Hofstra‚Äîto receive this fellowship, and they became known as 'The Mandarins', one of the first cohort of students to study with Malinowski. A closely knit group, all them planned on studying West Africa, and even traveled in the same ship from England to Africa. Nadel began his fieldwork in Nigeria in 1933 with the Nupe people of modern-day Nigeria. His Ph.D., completed in 1935, was entitled Political and Religious Structure of Nupe Society. After earning his Ph.D. Nadel grew increasingly involved in British colonial administration. He continued to conduct fieldwork in Nigeria and lectured at the Summer School on Colonial Administration at the University of Oxford. In 1938 he became the Government Anthropologist of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and conducted fieldwork with the Nuba. During a brief fieldbreak in Al-Ubayyid Nadel wrote Black Byzantium on the Nupe (which would not be published until 1942) and The Nuba: An Anthropological Study of the Hill Tribes in Kordofan (which would not appear in print until 1947). In 1941, as World War II broke out, Nadel enlisted in the Sudan Defence Force, transferring later that year to the British Army's East African Command. By this time Nadel had served on the Eritrean-Ethiopean border and was appointed, as a Major, Secretary of native Affairs in the British Military Administration of Eritrea. In 1944 he returned to England produced academic work on the Nuba and Eritrea, including Land Tenure on the Eritrean Pleateau. In 1945 he was transferred to the Home Establishment, promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, and made Secretary of Native Affairs and Deputy Chief Secretary of the British Military Administration in Tripolitania. Nadel left government service in 1946 and quickly rose through the ranks of British anthropology. He served as a lecturer at the London School of Economics and then in 1948 became the head of the anthropology department at the University of Durham. In 1950 he was appointed to the inaugural chair in anthropology at the Australian National University. Originally, Raymond Firth had served as Advisor and Acting Director of the Research School of Pacific Studies while the ANU was initially formed. IN 1952, when Firth returned to England, Nadel was appointed dean. After his arrival in Canberra he also became Dean of the Research School of Pacific Studies. During the early 1950s Nadel published two more books, Foundations of Social Anthropology (1951) and Nupe Religion (1954). He died unexpectedly at the age of 53 of a coronary thrombosis. His Theory of Social Structure appeared posthumously in 1957. The life and work of Nadel is commemorated in the Nadel Essay Prize.

On occasions other sports would be included. It also included music in its first years. However, from Mellor onwards, the show became established as a more mainstream phone-in, mainly focusing on Premier League teams. Between 2007 and 2009 the programme was hosted by DJ Spoony and Gabriele Marcotti. From the 2009‚Äì2010 season Alan Green presented on Saturdays, as he typically commentated on an evening match before presenting the Saturday show. Tim Lovejoy joined to present on Wednesdays while Danny Baker continued to present on Tuesdays from 10-11pm. Recent history After TalkSport took the rights to Saturday evening Premier League matches from the 2010‚Äì11 season, the Saturday edition returned again to 6:06pm. The hosts became Mark Chapman and Robbie Savage, in his final season as a professional footballer. Savage won the Rising Star in radio Sony Radio Award for his plain speaking. Sunday's show was hosted by Alan Green. The Tuesday and Wednesday shows were dropped, only appearing on international nights. In 2011‚Äì12, as Savage was taking part in Strictly Come Dancing, he was replaced on Saturdays by Jason Roberts. Savage instead joined Green on Sunday. In 2012‚Äì13, Savage returned to the Saturday evening program, alongside either Darren Fletcher or Mark Chapman. Green again hosts Sunday on his own. From the 2013‚Äì14 season, there were two teams hosting between the two nights. Darren Fletcher and Robbie Savage hosted on Saturdays while Kelly Cates and former footballer Ian Wright hosted on Sundays. From the 2016‚Äì17 season, the Saturday team changed, with Jason Mohammad joining Savage, due to Fletcher's BT Sport commentary commitments. Cates and Wright continued to host on a Sunday. From the 2018‚Äì19 season, the Saturday show was hosted by Jason Mohammad with Robbie Savage and the Sunday show saw Alistair Bruce-Ball and Chris Sutton take over from Cates and Wright. From the 2019‚Äì20 season, Alistair Bruce-Ball and Chris Sutton moved to the Saturday evening show with Sam Quek and Emma Jones alternating each week to present the Sunday evening show alongside Robbie Savage. From the 2020‚Äì2021 season, Robbie Savage transitioned to the presenter role for both the Saturday and Sunday shows, alongside Chris Sutton. Programme features Season 2009/10 saw the launch of the 606 Soapbox outside grounds. Fans can drop into the Soapbox and speak live to presenters Spoony and Gabriele Marcotti in the 5 Live studios. Every three weeks the Soapbox visits a league football ground in various locations around the country. Sunday's 606 also has a weekly celebrity fan, reporting on the game they have been to that day. Celebrity fans so far have included Ray Winstone (West Ham United), Alan Davies (Arsenal), Beverley Knight (Wolves), Norman Jay (Spurs), Trevor Nelson (Chelsea), Tony Jeffries (Sunderland) and James and Oliver Phelps aka Fred and George Weasley from the Harry Potter films (Birmingham City and Aston Villa). When Alistair Bruce-Ball and Chris Sutton started presenting, they introduced a game called \\"Sutton Death\\" in which both take it in turns to give answers to a certain category each week, in a given a time (usually around 15‚Äì20 seconds). Other features on their show included, \\"ABB\\" in which both Bruce-Ball and Sutton share what has \\"Amused\\", \\"Bugged\\" and \\"Baffled\\" them during the week, and, \\"The Simulation Game\\" in which they play a clip of the song ‚ÄúFree Fallin'‚Äù by Tom Petty and also play the commentary from the times during the week when players have been caught diving. Since Robbie Savage took over as presenter, features include, giving 6 callers, 6 seconds to state their name, the team they support and their point, as well as \\"Gone in 60 Suttons\\" 6-0-6 online forum In addition to the phone-in programme, there was also an online version of 6-0-6 in the form of an Internet message board, although in June 2006 the site was forced to temporarily close due to the large amount of web traffic and forum threads. Football, cricket, rugby union, rugby league, snooker, motorsport and several other sports had message boards embedded into 606. On 24 January 2011, it was announced the 6-0-6 forum would close at the end of the 2010-11 football season. The forum finally closed on 31 May 2011. 6-0-6 also has an active Facebook group, for fans to chat, and view behind the scenes pictures of the show. Listeners can follow 606 @bbc606 on Twitter. Spin-offs Other sports occasionally get the 6-0-6 treatment. These include Tennis, where the show became 6 Love 6 presented by John McEnroe, Cricket's 6-Duck-6 presented by former England captain Michael Vaughan and Formula 1's Slicks-0-6, where Murray Walker presents. Since the 6-0-6 website disabled the ability to add comments and is no longer maintained, there have been a number of websites set up to continue providing this service including Just Another 606, New 606 Sport Forum and 606v2.

Though born in the territory of the Republic of Venice, he spent his mature career at the other end of Italy, moving between Naples and Sicily, and Urbino, and finally in southern France, where he died. He was one of the more significant and complex sculptors of the 15th century ‚Äì complex because of his activities within varying cultural circles and his exposure to differing influences. His best works evolved in the workshop tradition in collaboration with other artists. His portrait busts reveal a creative individuality that was seen as particularly fascinating in the late 19th century. Though it is impossible to chart his stylistic development, his later work made in France shows some assimilation of northern realism, which is absent from the work executed in Italy. Life and works Enthroned Madonna with Child, Naples Laurana was born in Vrana, near Zadar, in Dalmatia. Under Venetian rule Vrana was named La Vrana, from romance de Vrana, giving the surname used by Francesco Laurana: LA VRANA -> LAVRANA which is read like LAURANA because the letter U is written as V in inscriptions in Latin. After an apprenticeship under a sculptor, he began his solo career at Naples, where he was one of the team of sculptors finishing the triumphal arch of Castel Nuovo for Alfonso V of Aragon.Laurana was first documented in 1453, as Francesco Adzara (Francesco da Zara). After the death of Alfonso (1458) he was called to Aix-en-Provence to the court of Ren√© d'Anjou, the former and still titular King of Naples, who commissioned him to do a series of bronze portrait medals of personages at the court. From 1466 to 1471 Laurana was in Sicily. Works of this period include the Mastrantonio Chapel and the tomb of Pietro Speciale in the church of S. Francesco in Palermo, the side door of the church of St. Marguerite in Sciacca, Madonna and Child sculptures in the cathedrals of Palermo (1471)Signed and dated. and Noto, and a bust allegedly portraying Eleanor of Aragon, now in the Palazzo Abatellis in Palermo, Sicily. In 1471 he traveled to Naples where he executed the sculpture of the Virgin in the Sta. Barbara Chapel. From 1474 to 1477 Laura spent three years in Urbino, where his relative Luciano Laurana worked. He then went to Marseille, where he built a small chapel in the Cathedral of S. Marie Majeure (1475‚Äì1481), the first structure in France designed entirely in the Renaissance style.Nikolaus Pevsner. An Outline of European Architecture, 7th ed. 1963:289. His workshop in Marseille created the St. Lazarus marble altar as well as the retable of the Calvary in St. Didier d'Avignon, and the tombs of Giovanni Cossa at Sainte-Marthe de Tarascon and Charles, comte du Maine, in Le Mans.Illustration.

She was found on 12 May 1897 and was reputedly uncannily well- preserved when discovered (especially her hair), but by the time the body was turned over to the authorities two weeks later it had been severely damaged and deteriorated. Most of her teeth had been pulled from the skull by villagers as well as a large amount of hair. The peat cutting tools had also been reported to have severely damaged the body. Examination The Yde Girl's body Carbon-14 tests have indicated that Yde Girl died between 54 BC and 128 AD at an approximate age of 16 years. She had long reddish blond hair, but one side of her head was initially thought to have been shaved before she died. Recent studies of Windeby I, however, have suggested that the shaved hair phenomenon in some bog bodies may simply attest to one side of the head being exposed to oxygen slightly longer than the other. Scans have shown that she suffered from scoliosis. She stood at , which is comparatively small for a sixteen-year-old. The body was found clad in a woolen cape and with a woolen band, made in a braiding technique known as sprang, wrapped around the neck, suggesting she was executed or sacrificed. There was also a stab wound in the area of her collarbone, but that was not determined as the cause of death. It is thought that she may have died while unconscious, as defensive wounds were absent on the hand that was recovered from the body, unlike a similar case in Germany, the Kayhausen Boy, who had a cut on his left hand from an apparent defense attempt. As with most bog bodies, the skin and features are still preserved because of the tannic acid in the marsh water. When Yde Girl was excavated, the diggers accidentally caused a wound to the skull. Only the torso of the girl, the head, the right hand and the feet remain intact today. The rest of her body was not preserved or had been damaged by peat cutting tools. Exhibit 1992 facial reconstruction by artist Richard Neave The Yde Girl was put on display and further study was not carried out on the remains until 1992. Richard Neave, of University of Manchester, took a CT scan of the skull of Yde Girl and determined her age, both anatomically and historically. The Yde Girl became internationally known when Neave made a reconstruction of her head, using techniques from plastic surgery and criminal pathology. Due to the state of the body, the work on the reconstruction included some guesswork, for example, the nose and some other facial features. Yde Girl and her modern reconstruction are displayed at the Drents Museum in Assen. Yde Girl, along with Roter Franz and the Weerdinge Men, were transported across the world for a museum tour in both the early and mid 2000s. Due to the intensity of the girl's death, protests in Canada prevented the tour from traveling through several locations in the country.

It was the home of the Wittelsbach dynasty, and it served as their ducal residence for Lower Bavaria from 1255-1503, and later as the seat of the hereditary rulers of the whole of Bavaria. The castle was founded in 1204 by Duke Ludwig I. Castle features=Knights' Hall The Knights' Hall of Castle Trausnitz belongs to the main buildings of the 13th century and there were already around 1260/70. The room is 245 m¬≤ and is separated in two naves, to four \\"Jochen\\" a nave. The constructions that were used belong to the time period of the so-called \\"Zisterziensergotik\\". Today the Knights' Hall is used for festival banquets or for short exhibitions. Trausnitz by Michael Wening (1645‚Äì1718). Tower Terrace (S√∂ller) The \\"Loggia\\", already called so since 1493, was finished in the 16th century. The Tower Terrace sports a great view of the city through the round arcs. On the east side there is a stair tower. The wooden ceiling with shaped rosettes is descended from the time of Wilhelm V. There is a stone walled music platform on the south side of the room. The \\"S√∂ller\\" is today used for many different functions, and it holds a maximum of 99 people. White Hall  The White Hall is on the first floor of the D√ºrnitz tract and is directly above the Knights' Hall. The White Hall has probably existed since the 15th century and was probably planned as a big ballroom. It appears that the hall was never finished, because there are no traces of paintings as usual for the castle at this time. The about 240 m¬≤ tall room, which is two floors large, is today used for banquets, greetings, concerts and lectures. The visitors can enjoy the great view over the ancient city of Landshut. Chamber of art and curiosities A phenomenon in the Renaissance that proliferated Europe throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, the cabinet of curiosities was in essence a personal collection of rare, unknown and marvelous objects. Popular, visual and encyclopedic in their approach, these cabinets, or Wunderkammern, included a diversity of specimens from both known and newly discovered worlds. These collections of curious objects that are seemingly not human in nature require the idea or application of human characteristics and traits to describe their inhuman state. The Trausnitz Chamber of Art and Curiosities which was arranged by Prince Wilhelm in 1579 and then taken to Munich is a collection of 750 exhibits including works of art, treasures from the Orient and curiosities typical of the collections owned by rulers in the Renaissance era. It was reopened in September 2004 as one part of the Bavarian National Museum. The chamber is divided into four different themes. ARTIFICIALA--wondrous legerdemains--contains sumptuous bronze and painting but also midget carving of plum stones. NATURALIA--the wonder of nature--gets shown stuffed animals, extraordinary horns, mussels and minerals. The hall of EXOTICA--marvellousness from foreign countries--contains craft of corals, ivory and nacre whereas SCIENTIFICA--scientific arranges the world--shows scientific instruments of rational acquisition of the world in year 1600.  History  Entrance Trausnitz Castle is situated atop a hill above Landshut. Before the 16th century, it had the same name as the town, Landshut, which translates into \\"protector of the land\\". Previously, the castle guarded over the city and the surrounding land. The size of the castle has remained almost the same since Louis I of Bavaria in 1204. The castle was completed by the time of Emperor Frederick II's visit in 1235. During the first half of the 13th century, Trausnitz represented not only the centre of imperial politics but also of Staufer culture. Landshut was visited by famous minstrel singers, including Walter von der Vogelweide and Tannh√§user, during this period. The patronage of art by the Dukes of Bavaria was so high that they sent for a sculptor from Strasbourg who created jewellery for a sculpture that now stands in the Castle's \\"Burgkapelle\\". Trausnitz Castle courtyard The wealthy Duke of Landshut repeatedly renovated and expanded the buildings in Burg Trausnitz during the 15th century. The D√ºrnitz was built during this time. The outer defensive ring of walls were heightened and extended for the defensive towers. Duke Louis X of Bavaria furnished the castle in 1516 in the south German Renaissance style, though few examples remain today. The arcades of the courtyard were created 1568‚Äì1578 by Friedrich Sustris for Crown Prince William. Many paintings in the Florentine style were added at this time, but most were lost due to fires over the years. Later, Prince Ferdinand Maria (1675‚Äì1679) undertook restoration of the burned paintings and decorated other rooms with other paintings. During the 18th century, the castle was used a barracks and a prison for noble prisoners. At the beginning of the 19th century it was used as a hospital. King Ludwig II of Bavaria (who was the creator of Neuschwanstein Castle in F√ºssen) ordered the decoration of a new splendid private apartment in the second floor of the prince's wing (1869-1873). In 1961, a fire destroyed much of the interior decoration, including the king's rooms.

In past centuries, the upper reaches of the river have been affected by lead and silver mining and the quality of the river has suffered as a result. There is some organic pollution from diffuse agricultural inputs and from the discharge of treated sewage from the Bow Street sewage treatment works. The river discharges into the sea over the beach at Clarach Bay thus limiting the population of migratory fish able to access the river.

On August 16, 1965, at approximately 21:21 EST, the Boeing 727 crashed into Lake Michigan east of Fort Sheridan, near Lake Forest, while descending from 35,000 feet mean sea level (MSL). There was no indication of any unusual problem prior to impact. A definitive cause was not determined by National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators. However, it was believed that the crash was most likely the result of the pilots misreading their three-pointer (3p) altimeters by 10,000 feet. At the time of the accident, United Airlines had 39 other 727s in its fleet (of the 247 Boeing 727s ordered), all of which were 727-100 (727-22). The accident was both the first hull-loss and first fatal accident of a Boeing 727. Aircraft alt=refer to caption The aircraft involved was a United Airlines Boeing 727-100 (727-22), registration With serial number 18328, and line number 146, the aircraft had its maiden flight on May 18, 1965 with delivery to United Airlines on June 3, 1965 meaning it had been in passenger service for two and a half months before it crashed. The aircraft had completed 138 cycles (take offs and landings) before the accident, was equipped with three Pratt & Whitney JT8D-1 engines for propulsion and had no major mechanical problems reported in the time leading up to the accident. Before the crash Boeing 727s had been operating commercially for approximately two years and N7036U was the first 727 to be written off. It was also one of two United Airlines 727s to crash that year, the other later that year being United Airlines Flight 227, a fatal crash landing attributed to poor decision made by the captain. Accident sequence The flight was cleared to an altitude of 6,000 feet MSL by air traffic control (ATC), but the plane never leveled off at 6,000 feet. Instead, it continued its descent, at an uninterrupted rate of approximately 2,000 feet per minute, until it hit the waters of Lake Michigan, which is 577 feet MSL. The control tower at O'Hare lost radio contact with the plane as it approached the western shore of Lake Michigan. A tower crewman at O'Hare said the pilot had just received landing instructions and had replied \\"Roger\\" when communication with the plane failed. Wallace Whigam, a lifeguard for the Chicago Park District, reported from the North Avenue Beach House that he had seen an orange flash on the horizon. Three seconds later, he reported, there was a \\"thundering roar.\\" Other reports of the crash flooded police and Coast Guard from the North Side and North Shore. The Coast Guard reported that skin divers had assembled at the North Shore Yacht Club in Highland Park, which was used as an informal search base. After a search of several hours there were no signs of survivors, though the area was kept ready in case any were found. Hours after the crash, members of the Civil Aeronautics Board (the predecessor to the NTSB) were on scene to begin investigating the accident. The most likely explanation is the pilots thought they were descending through 16,000 feet MSL when they were actually descending through only 6,000 feet MSL. Time and radar-image analyses indicated the plane was already down to an altitude of between 1,000 and 2,500 feet MSL when it was again given the clearance limit. That final clearance was acknowledged by the captain, and was the last communication with ATC prior to impact with the water. The captain of a 707 which was behind the accident flight stated their descent was in instrument conditions until they broke out of the cloud layer at about 8,000 to 10,000 feet and approximately east of the shoreline. The night visibility was \\"fuzzy and unclear\\", and lights on the shoreline were the only ones visible. Altimeter study Diagram showing the face of the three-pointer altimeter design cited in the crash. Altitude displayed here is 10,180 feet. A study by the Naval Research Laboratory published in January 1965 found that, of four different designs of pilot altimeters, the 3p design was the one most prone to misreading by pilots. The study revealed that the 3p design was misread almost eight times more often than the best-designed of the four altimeters tested. It was also noted that it took the pilots considerably longer to decipher the correct reading of the 3p than with the other altimeters.NRL Report 6242, \\"Altimeter Display Evaluation, Final Report,\\" January 26, 1965 Investigation The NTSB estimated the plane was traveling at a speed of approximately when it impacted the water. The investigation was hampered by the fact that the flight data recorder (FDR) was not recovered from the wreckage, which was in muddy water deep. The FDR casing was recovered, but the device internals including recording media was never found. Probable cause \\"The Board is unable to determine the reason for the aircraft not being leveled off at its assigned altitude of 6,000 feet.\\" The first proven case of a crash caused by a pilot misreading the altimeter by 10,000 feet was of a BEA Vickers Viscount outside Ayr, Scotland, on April 28, 1958.ICAO Accident Digest Circular 59-AN/54 (129-132) The second proven case was the 1958 Bristol Britannia 312 crash near Christchurch, Dorset, in the south of England, on December 24, 1958.ICAO Accident Digest Circular 62-AN/57 (44-47) While the former carried only a flight crew, all seven passengers and two of the crew members perished in the latter accident, and surviving crew members helped to pinpoint the cause.

More generally, it is a differential form with values in some vector bundle E over M. Ordinary differential forms can be viewed as R-valued differential forms. An important case of vector-valued differential forms are Lie algebra-valued forms. (A connection form is an example of such a form.) Definition Let M be a smooth manifold and E ‚Üí M be a smooth vector bundle over M. We denote the space of smooth sections of a bundle E by Œì(E). An E-valued differential form of degree p is a smooth section of the tensor product bundle of E with Œõp(T ‚àóM), the p-th exterior power of the cotangent bundle of M. The space of such forms is denoted by :\\\\Omega^p(M,E) = \\\\Gamma(E\\\\otimes\\\\Lambda^pT^*M). Because Œì is a strong monoidal functor, this can also be interpreted as :\\\\Gamma(E\\\\otimes\\\\Lambda^pT^*M) = \\\\Gamma(E) \\\\otimes_{\\\\Omega^0(M)} \\\\Gamma(\\\\Lambda^pT^*M) = \\\\Gamma(E) \\\\otimes_{\\\\Omega^0(M)} \\\\Omega^p(M), where the latter two tensor products are the tensor product of modules over the ring Œ©0(M) of smooth R-valued functions on M (see the seventh example here). By convention, an E-valued 0-form is just a section of the bundle E. That is, :\\\\Omega^0(M,E) = \\\\Gamma(E).\\\\, Equivalently, an E-valued differential form can be defined as a bundle morphism :TM\\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes TM \\\\to E which is totally skew-symmetric. Let V be a fixed vector space. A V-valued differential form of degree p is a differential form of degree p with values in the trivial bundle M √ó V. The space of such forms is denoted Œ©p(M, V). When V = R one recovers the definition of an ordinary differential form. If V is finite- dimensional, then one can show that the natural homomorphism :\\\\Omega^p(M) \\\\otimes_\\\\mathbb{R} V \\\\to \\\\Omega^p(M,V), where the first tensor product is of vector spaces over R, is an isomorphism.Proof: One can verify this for p=0 by turning a basis for V into a set of constant functions to V, which allows the construction of an inverse to the above homomorphism. The general case can be proved by noting that :\\\\Omega^p(M, V) = \\\\Omega^0(M, V) \\\\otimes_{\\\\Omega^0(M)} \\\\Omega^p(M), and that because \\\\mathbb{R} is a sub-ring of Œ©0(M) via the constant functions, :\\\\Omega^0(M, V) \\\\otimes_{\\\\Omega^0(M)} \\\\Omega^p(M) = (V \\\\otimes_\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\Omega^0(M)) \\\\otimes_{\\\\Omega^0(M)} \\\\Omega^p(M) = V \\\\otimes_\\\\mathbb{R} (\\\\Omega^0(M) \\\\otimes_{\\\\Omega^0(M)} \\\\Omega^p(M)) = V \\\\otimes_\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\Omega^p(M). Operations on vector-valued forms=Pullback One can define the pullback of vector-valued forms by smooth maps just as for ordinary forms. The pullback of an E-valued form on N by a smooth map œÜ : M ‚Üí N is an (œÜ*E)-valued form on M, where œÜ*E is the pullback bundle of E by œÜ. The formula is given just as in the ordinary case. For any E-valued p-form œâ on N the pullback œÜ*œâ is given by : (\\\\varphi^*\\\\omega)_x(v_1,\\\\cdots, v_p) = \\\\omega_{\\\\varphi(x)}(\\\\mathrm d\\\\varphi_x(v_1),\\\\cdots,\\\\mathrm d\\\\varphi_x(v_p)). Wedge product Just as for ordinary differential forms, one can define a wedge product of vector- valued forms. The wedge product of an E1-valued p-form with an E2-valued q-form is naturally an (E1‚äóE2)-valued (p+q)-form: :\\\\wedge : \\\\Omega^p(M,E_1) \\\\times \\\\Omega^q(M,E_2) \\\\to \\\\Omega^{p+q}(M,E_1\\\\otimes E_2). The definition is just as for ordinary forms with the exception that real multiplication is replaced with the tensor product: :(\\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\eta)(v_1,\\\\cdots,v_{p+q}) = \\\\frac{1}{p! q!}\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma\\\\in S_{p+q}}\\\\sgn(\\\\sigma)\\\\omega(v_{\\\\sigma(1)},\\\\cdots,v_{\\\\sigma(p)})\\\\otimes \\\\eta(v_{\\\\sigma(p+1)},\\\\cdots,v_{\\\\sigma(p+q)}). In particular, the wedge product of an ordinary (R-valued) p-form with an E-valued q-form is naturally an E-valued (p+q)-form (since the tensor product of E with the trivial bundle M √ó R is naturally isomorphic to E). For œâ ‚àà Œ©p(M) and Œ∑ ‚àà Œ©q(M, E) one has the usual commutativity relation: :\\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\eta = (-1)^{pq}\\\\eta\\\\wedge\\\\omega. In general, the wedge product of two E-valued forms is not another E-valued form, but rather an (E‚äóE)-valued form. However, if E is an algebra bundle (i.e. a bundle of algebras rather than just vector spaces) one can compose with multiplication in E to obtain an E-valued form. If E is a bundle of commutative, associative algebras then, with this modified wedge product, the set of all E-valued differential forms :\\\\Omega(M,E) = \\\\bigoplus_{p=0}^{\\\\dim M}\\\\Omega^p(M,E) becomes a graded-commutative associative algebra. If the fibers of E are not commutative then Œ©(M,E) will not be graded-commutative. Exterior derivative For any vector space V there is a natural exterior derivative on the space of V-valued forms. This is just the ordinary exterior derivative acting component-wise relative to any basis of V. Explicitly, if {eŒ±} is a basis for V then the differential of a V-valued p-form œâ = œâŒ±eŒ± is given by :d\\\\omega = (d\\\\omega^\\\\alpha)e_\\\\alpha.\\\\, The exterior derivative on V-valued forms is completely characterized by the usual relations: :\\\\begin{align} &d;(\\\\omega+\\\\eta) = d\\\\omega + d\\\\eta\\\\ &d;(\\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\eta) = d\\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\eta + (-1)^p\\\\,\\\\omega\\\\wedge d\\\\eta\\\\qquad(p=\\\\deg\\\\omega)\\\\ &d;(d\\\\omega) = 0. \\\\end{align} More generally, the above remarks apply to E-valued forms where E is any flat vector bundle over M (i.e. a vector bundle whose transition functions are constant). The exterior derivative is defined as above on any local trivialization of E. If E is not flat then there is no natural notion of an exterior derivative acting on E-valued forms. What is needed is a choice of connection on E. A connection on E is a linear differential operator taking sections of E to E-valued one forms: : abla : \\\\Omega^0(M,E) \\\\to \\\\Omega^1(M,E). If E is equipped with a connection ‚àá then there is a unique covariant exterior derivative :d_ abla: \\\\Omega^p(M,E) \\\\to \\\\Omega^{p+1}(M,E) extending ‚àá. The covariant exterior derivative is characterized by linearity and the equation :d_ abla(\\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\eta) = d_ abla\\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\eta + (-1)^p\\\\,\\\\omega\\\\wedge d\\\\eta where œâ is a E-valued p-form and Œ∑ is an ordinary q-form. In general, one need not have d‚àá2 = 0. In fact, this happens if and only if the connection ‚àá is flat (i.e. has vanishing curvature). Basic or tensorial forms on principal bundles Let E ‚Üí M be a smooth vector bundle of rank k over M and let œÄ : F(E) ‚Üí M be the (associated) frame bundle of E, which is a principal GLk(R) bundle over M. The pullback of E by œÄ is canonically isomorphic to F(E) √óœÅ Rk via the inverse of [u, v] ‚Üíu(v), where œÅ is the standard representation. Therefore, the pullback by œÄ of an E-valued form on M determines an Rk-valued form on F(E). It is not hard to check that this pulled back form is right-equivariant with respect to the natural action of GLk(R) on F(E) √ó Rk and vanishes on vertical vectors (tangent vectors to F(E) which lie in the kernel of dœÄ). Such vector-valued forms on F(E) are important enough to warrant special terminology: they are called basic or tensorial forms on F(E). Let œÄ : P ‚Üí M be a (smooth) principal G-bundle and let V be a fixed vector space together with a representation œÅ : G ‚Üí GL(V). A basic or tensorial form on P of type œÅ is a V-valued form œâ on P which is equivariant and horizontal in the sense that #(R_g)^*\\\\omega = \\\\rho(g^{-1})\\\\omega\\\\, for all g ‚àà G, and #\\\\omega(v_1, \\\\ldots, v_p) = 0 whenever at least one of the vi are vertical (i.e., dœÄ(vi) = 0). Here Rg denotes the right action of G on P for some g ‚àà G. Note that for 0-forms the second condition is vacuously true. *Example: If œÅ is the adjoint representation of G on the Lie algebra, then the connection form œâ satisfies the first condition (but not the second). The associated curvature form Œ© satisfies both; hence Œ© is a tensorial form of adjoint type. The \\"difference\\" of two connection forms is a tensorial form. Given P and œÅ as above one can construct the associated vector bundle E = P √óœÅ V. Tensorial q-forms on P are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with E-valued q-forms on M. As in the case of the principal bundle F(E) above, given a q-form \\\\overline{\\\\phi} on M with values in E, define œÜ on P fiberwise by, say at u, :\\\\phi = u^{-1}\\\\pi^*\\\\overline{\\\\phi} where u is viewed as a linear isomorphism V \\\\overset{\\\\simeq}\\\\to E_{\\\\pi(u)} = (\\\\pi^*E)_u, v \\\\mapsto [u, v]. œÜ is then a tensorial form of type œÅ. Conversely, given a tensorial form œÜ of type œÅ, the same formula defines an E-valued form \\\\overline{\\\\phi} on M (cf. the Chern‚ÄìWeil homomorphism.) In particular, there is a natural isomorphism of vector spaces :\\\\Gamma(M, E) \\\\simeq { f: P \\\\to V  f(ug) = \\\\rho(g)^{-1}f(u) }, \\\\, \\\\overline{f} \\\\leftrightarrow f. *Example: Let E be the tangent bundle of M. Then identity bundle map idE: E ‚ÜíE is an E-valued one form on M. The tautological one-form is a unique one-form on the frame bundle of E that corresponds to idE. Denoted by Œ∏, it is a tensorial form of standard type. Now, suppose there is a connection on P so that there is an exterior covariant differentiation D on (various) vector-valued forms on P. Through the above correspondence, D also acts on E-valued forms: define ‚àá by : abla \\\\overline{\\\\phi} = \\\\overline{D \\\\phi}. In particular for zero-forms, : abla: \\\\Gamma(M, E) \\\\to \\\\Gamma(M, T^*M \\\\otimes E). This is exactly the covariant derivative for the connection on the vector bundle E.Proof: D (f\\\\phi) = Df \\\\otimes \\\\phi + f D\\\\phi for any scalar- valued tensorial zero-form f and any tensorial zero-form œÜ of type œÅ, and Df = df since f descends to a function on M; cf. this Lemma 2. Examples Siegel modular forms arise as vector-valued differential forms on Siegel modular varieties.

The name means literally Southern drama, and the form originated in the area around Wenzhou in southeastern China. Nanxi started as combinations of Song plays and local folk songs and ballads, using colloquial language and large numbers of scenes. As with western operetta, spoken passages alternated with verses (qu Êõ≤) set to popular music. Professional companies of actors performed nanxi in theatres that could hold thousands of spectators. Nanxi developed into the later and more complex dramatic form known as chuanqi, and later still into kunqu. Nanxi had seven role types, many of which were seen in later Chinese opera forms. Sheng were heroic male characters and dan heroines. Mo (Êú´), jing, chou, wai (Â§ñ), and hou (Âêé, also called tie Ë≤º) were less defined roles, and actors in these role types portrayed a variety of characters in the same play. The role types of later forms of Chinese opera were made more strict, but can be seen to have their roots in nanxi. Due to its coarse language, rough prosody, and unsophisticated literary style, nanxi was not mentioned in contemporary historiography and had been almost forgotten by scholars after the mid-16th century. Of the large numbers of nanxi originally written, only 283 titles and 20 play texts survive. Some of the missing plays such as Liu Wenlong and the Water Chestnut Mirror have been preserved in other languages. NotesSources *Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2006.

The King Edward VII statue in Fitzalan Square with the old Post Office building in the background now sold. Fitzalan Square is a municipal square situated in the city centre of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England. The present day square is one of the busiest areas of the city centre, with traffic and pedestrians continually moving through the area. It has a Sheffield Supertram stop and a taxi rank. This area of the city had been the market quarter since the medieval era and the modern square takes its name from the Fitzalan Market Hall, which stood near the site from 1786 to 1930. The Fitzalans were a lesser branch of the Howard family, Dukes of Norfolk and the major local landowners at that time. In 2017, Sheffield City Council announced plans to renovate the square. Location The square is located in the city centre at ; to the south of the eastern end of High Street. It is rectangular in shape, formed by the staggered intersections of Flat Street and Haymarket with High Street from the south and north respectively. Commercial Street and Bakers Hill leave the square to the east. Norfolk Street used to intersect with Flat Street at the south-western corner of the square, but it was cut off from the square when Arundel Gate was constructed in 1968. Fitzalan Square, in 2006 the Marples building is on the far right of the picture. History Fitzalan Square was created in 1881 when Market Street and its buildings were demolished; the early square had a substantial cab stand and clock. However, this was demolished in 1913 to make way for a bronze statue of King Edward VII by Alfred Drury (1857‚Äì1944). This was unveiled by the Duke of Norfolk on 27 October 1913, and stands to this day. Sheffield's Head Post Office operated in the square for almost ninety years. Built in 1910 as an addition to the 1897 post office building on Flat Street, it closed in 1999, with the main post office moving to new premises within the Co-op store on Angel Street. The Grade II listed Post Office building was up for sale for a considerable time before finally being sold for development in early 2006. On the west side of the square is the Grade II listed White Building. Built in 1908 by Gibbs and Flockton, it is faced in faience with carvings of the Sheffield metal trades by Alfred and William Tory, the faience was intended to resist the soot that blackened many of Sheffield's buildings at the time.Harman, R. & Minnis, J. (2004) Pevsner City Guides: Sheffield, p17 & pp150-151\\\\. New Haven & London: Yale University Press. The early square also had the Electra Palace Cinema, which opened February 1911. It became the News Theatre in 1945 and the Classic Cinema in 1962. It closed in 1982, and the building was destroyed by a fire in 1984. The site is now occupied by an amusement arcade. Next door to the cinema was the Bell Hotel public house, which is now a gift shop. Another public house, the Elephant Inn, stood on the corner where Norfolk Street entered the square. This closed in the late 1960s; it later became a branch of Halfords and then a charity shop. The well known Sheffield company of Wigfalls also had a shop in the square for many years, this is now a betting shop. However, the best-known structure in Fitzalan Square is the ‚ÄúMarples‚Äù building. The Marples tragedy The building at the corner of the square as it joins High Street was first occupied by a hotel in 1870; John Marples became the proprietor in 1886 and named the establishment the London Mart however it was always known locally as ‚ÄúThe Marples‚Äù. On the night of Thursday 12 December 1940, 280 German bombers attacked Sheffield in what has become known as the Sheffield Blitz. Their target was the steel works producing armaments in the east end of the city, however a mistake in navigation caused the city centre to become the main target. Fire bombs caused widespread panic, and many people took shelter in the Marples‚Äô extensive cellars, believing they were safe under the robust seven-storey building. At 11:44 p.m. the Marples building took a direct hit from a bomb which plunged through the building and detonated just above the cellars, killing approximately 70 people and reducing the building to a pile of rubble. The next day seven men were dug out of the rubble still alive, as a small section of cellar roof had, amazingly, withstood the impact.http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A5559573 The Marples site stood derelict until 1959 when the brewing company John Smith opened a new public house on the site, this time officially called ‚ÄúThe Marples‚Äù. The pub closed in 2002 and was occupied by the Hein Gericke motorcycle clothing and accessory outlet until 2008. The building then stood empty for a few years but since 2012 the Marples building has been occupied by Cash Shop, a fair money lending and pawn broking company.www.chrishobbs.com. Information on Marples tragedy from this site. Present day Fitzalan Square received a facelift during the summer of 2003.Sheffield City Council website. Details of 2003 facelift. The Edward VII statue was cleaned and protected from pigeons, and lights were added to illuminate it at night. New sandstone paving and steel benches were installed, the trees were pruned and the street lighting was improved. In addition to a fair money lending and pawn broking company, amusement arcade and gift shop, the square contains three betting shops from national chains Betfred, Coral and Ladbrokes, a few insurance companies and a small newsagents. In the inner part of the square there is also a fast food hut named @Marples and a small police cabin. In January 2016, the Sheffield Institute of Arts (the art and design department within Sheffield Hallam University) moved into a fully refurbished Head Post Office, at the start of an initial 20-year lease, housing graphic design, fine art, fashion and product design. It is believed the Council will be further updating and improving the central area/island within the Square, possibly closing off one side to traffic. Sheffield Supertram stop Fitzalan Square/Ponds Forge is a central station on the Supertram tramway in Sheffield, serving the Ponds Forge International Sports Centre. It is one of only three stations served by all four of the system‚Äôs lines.

They are intended to protect an engine by restricting its maximum rotational speed, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). Rev limiters are pre-set by the engine manufacturer. There are also aftermarket units where a separate controller is installed using a custom RPM setting. A limiter prevents a vehicle's engine from being pushed beyond the manufacturer's limit known as the redline (literally the red line marked on the tachometer). At some point beyond the redline, engine damage may occur.  Operation  The typical layout of a manual transmission shifter Limiters usually work by shutting off a component necessary for the combustion processes to occur. compression-ignition engines use mechanical governors or limiters to shut off electronic fuel injectors. A spark-ignition engine may also shut off fuel or stop the spark ignition and some just reduce the engine's power by changing the spark timing. In the case of an automatic transmission in \\"drive\\" mode, the engine RPM stays safely within the range that the transmission chooses. Only when over revving the engine in \\"park\\", \\"neutral\\" or \\"manual\\" modes is there any need for a rev limiter. These vehicles often do not include a tachometer. Without this gauge, the redline cannot be seen but there is so little risk of excessive engine speed with fully automatic transmissions that engine RPM is not a concern. However, with a manual transmission engine RPM can redline in \\"neutral\\", or by shifting to a higher gear too late, or by shifting to a lower gear too early. In the case of \\"neutral\\" or shifting up too late, a rev limiter can easily keep engine RPM below the redline. If a manual transmission is shifted down too early, the speed of the vehicle will drive the engine over the redline. In this case, a rev limiter will cut engine power but it cannot prevent the engine's RPM from going beyond the redline. Perhaps the worst situation occurs when a shift is \\"missed\\". In the diagram shown, it is possible to be at high RPM and \\"miss\\" shifting from 2nd to 3rd and get 1st gear instead. This will result in exceeding the redline and there is nothing to prevent an engine from being severely damaged in this way. Using the clutch as quickly as possible may avoid engine damage.https://jalopnik.com/5977720/auto-journalist-sued- for-174000-for-blowing-a-porsche-engine Types of control  Fuel control = Fuel-cutting rev limiters are the most common because they wear less on exhaust components. These systems usually lean out the engine's overspeed by shutting off the fuel injectors. This is less popular in high performance engines due to high temperatures in lean operation. = Spark control = Ignition control rev limiting systems work by shutting off the spark plugs once the engine overspeeds. This is less common in production vehicles because the system still injects fuel into the cylinder and consequently releases unburned fuel which may ignite at a turbo charger or in the exhaust pipe. This can affect the temperatures in the exhaust, causing premature wear on the catalytic converter.  Hard-cut vs. soft-cut limiters  Hard-cut limiters = Hard-cut limiters completely cut fuel or spark to the engine. These types of limiters activate at the set RPM and \\"bounce\\" off of it if throttle is applied. The \\"bouncing\\" occurs because the limiter will cut off fuel or spark at the set RPM, which causes the RPM to drop. If the engine is in a state of open throttle when the RPM drops, the RPM will then raise back to the limit. This causes the engine to cycle its power on and off. = Soft-cut limiters = Soft-cut limiters are a type of rev limiter that partially cuts off fuel to the engine. These limiters may also retard the ignition timing. If using a soft-cut rev limiter, the engine will start to cut fuel or retard ignition timing before the set RPM until it slowly reaches it and remains there.  Physical limiters  The maximum RPM of an engine is limited to the airflow through the engine, the displacement of the engine, the mass and balance of the rotating parts, along with the bore and stroke of the pistons. Formula One engines can rev up to 15,000 rpm as per Formula One rules because of their smaller displacement, low mass, and short stroke. Engines with hydraulic tappets (such as the Buick/Rover V8) often have in effect a rev limiter by virtue of their design. The tappet clearances are maintained by the flow of the engine's lubricating oil. At high engine speeds, the oil pressure rises to such an extent that the tappets 'pump up', causing valve float. This sharply reduces engine power, causing speed to drop.  Racing uses  The RPM level that results with the spark timing being arrested can be a constant level, or, with the proper ignition control modules, variable. Variable rate ignition modules can be adjusted quickly and easily to achieve the appropriate RPM limit for different situations, such as street racing, drag racing, road course racing and highway driving. Multiple stage ignition modules offer greater RPM limit control. The first stage can be used to limit RPM levels when launching a vehicle from a stationary position, providing maximum power and traction. The second stage is activated after launch to set a higher RPM limit for wide-open-throttle acceleration. Engine damage beyond the redline x300px There is considerable variation between manufactures on where to have the redline for their engines: from 3,000 to 10,000 RPM. If an engine goes overspeed, commonly called \\"over-revving\\", damage to the piston and valvetrain may occur when a valve stays open longer than usual. Valve float can possibly result in loss of compression, misfire, or a valve and piston colliding with each other. It's also possible the engine will throw a connecting rod between the crankshaft and piston. The engine will then need to be repaired or replaced entirely.

This could then be used for either of two currently proposed applications: 3-D film projection from two images each occupying 3 perforations (thus attaining a 1.85 aspect ratio already in common use), or making anamorphically squeezed prints of 1.85 ratio films, which would use a greater amount of image area. The system is named Cine 160 because the six-perf frame uses 1.60 times the area of a conventional print. This system has not yet received any mainstream application, however, and it is unknown how receptive theater owners will be to the prospect, which will require significant expenses to re-fit projectors to the format. Claimed benefits * Larger frame area can facilitate better and brighter 3D projection, or offer a low cost means to approach 70 mm film image brightness and clarity using 35 mm film and an anamorphic lens. * Allows more brightness and detail to reach the screen than conventional 35mm prints, much greater detail in camera image. * Permits better brightness when divided into above and below split frames for 3D, or if used non-stereo with anamorphic lens. * Very easy conversion of projector, and can be set up for \\"quick-change\\" in theaters. * Will look much better, brighter, than 2K digital at 1/10 of the conversion cost. Full 1.60 better than even anamorphic 35. * Will permit running of 35mm IMAX reduction prints in small theaters in remote locations. * Allows most existing cameras to be modified to shoot in the format, or projectors to be easily modified. * Can act as a \\"value added\\" marketing attraction, due to promotion of trade name, like 70mm did in the past. * There is no waste when fitting image onto an existing 1.85 theater screen, just more brightness, gamma range, and detail. * Digital conversion will be a hard sell in the poorer parts of world.

The novel had a rather long and difficult period of gestation. Pirandello began writing it in 1909. In an autobiographical letter, published in 1924, the author refers to this work as the \\"...bitterest of all, profoundly humoristic, about the decomposition of life: Moscarda one, no one and one hundred thousand.\\" The pages of the unfinished novel remained on Pirandello's desk for years and he would occasionally take out extracts and insert them into other works only to return, later, to the novel in a sort of uninterrupted compositive circle. Finally finished, Uno, Nessuno e Centomila came out in episodes between December 1925 and June 1926 in the magazine Fiera Letteraria. Plot Vitangelo Moscarda discovers by way of a completely irrelevant question that his wife poses to him that everyone he knows, everyone he has ever met, has constructed a Vitangelo persona in their own imagination and that none of these personas corresponds to the image of Vitangelo that he himself has constructed and believes himself to be. The reader is immediately immersed in a cruel game of falsifying projections, mirroring the reality of social existence itself, which imperiously dictate their rules. As a result, the first, ironic \\"awareness\\" of Vitangelo consists in the knowledge of that which he definitely is not; the preliminary operation must therefore consist in the spiteful destruction of all of these fictitious masks. Only after this radical step toward madness and folly in the eyes of the world can Vitangelo finally begin to follow the path toward his true self. He discovers, though, that if his body can be one, his spirit certainly is not. And this Faustian duplicity gradually develops into a disconcerting and extremely complex multiplicity. How can one come to know the true foundation, the substate of the self? Vitangelo seeks to catch it by surprise as it shows itself in a brief flash on the surface of consciousness. But this attempt at revealing the secret self, chasing after it as if it were an enemy that must be forced to surrender, does not give the desired results. Just as soon as it appears, the unknown self evaporates and recomposes itself into the familiar attitudes of the superficial self. In this extremely modern Secretum where there is no Saint Augustine to indicate, with the profound voice of conscience, the absolute truth to desire, where desperation is entrusted to a bitter humour, corrosive and healing at the same time, the unity of the self disintegrates into diverse stratifications. Vitangelo is one of those \\"...particularly intelligent souls ...who break through the illusion of the unity of the self and feel themselves to be multiform, a league of many Is...\\" as Hermann Hesse notes in the Dissertation chapter of Steppenwolf. Vitangelo's extremely lucid reflections seek out the possible objections, confine them into an increasingly restricted space and, finally, kill them with the weapons of rigorous and stringent argumentation. The imaginary interlocutors, (\\"Dear sirs, excuse me\\"...\\"Be honest now\\"...\\"You are shocked? Oh my God, you are turning pale\\"...), which incarnate these objections rather than opening up Vitangelo's monologue into a dialogue fracture it into two levels: one external and falsely reassuring, the other internal and disquieting, but surely more true. The plural you (\\"voi\\") which punctuates like a returning counterpoint all of the initial part of the novel is much different from the \\"tu\\" of Eugenio Montale, which is almost always charged with desperate expectations or improbable alternatives to existence; it represents, rather, the barrier of the conformist conceptions which the lengthy ratiocinations of Vitangelo nullify with the overwhelming evidence of implacable reflections. Vitangelo's \\"thinking out loud\\", definitely intentional and rigorous, is, however, paradoxically projected toward a completely different epilogue in which the spiral of reasoning gives way to a liberating irrationalism. Liberation for Vitangelo cannot happen through instinct or Eros, as happens in the case of Harry Haller, the steppenwolf, who realises his metamorphosis through an encounter with the transgressively vital Hermine. Vitangelo's liberation must follow other avenues; he must realise his salvation and the salvation of his reason precisely through an excess of reason. He seems to say to us: \\"Even reason, dear sirs, if it is alleviated of its role as a faculty of good sense which counsels adaptation to historical, social and existential \\"reality\\", can become a precious instrument of liberation.\\" This is not true because reason, when pushed to its ultimate limits, can open up to new metaphysical prospects, but because, having reached its limits, deliriously wandering around in cerebral labyrinths and in an atmosphere saturated with venom, it dies by its own hand. The total detachment of Vitangelo from false certainties is fully realised during a period of convalescence from illness. Sickness, in Pirandello as in many other great writers, is experienced as a situation in which all automatic behaviour is suspended and the perceptive faculties, outside of the normal rules, seem to expand and see \\"with other eyes.\\" In this moment the ineptitude that Vitangelo shares with Mattia Pascal and other literary characters of the beginning of the 20th century demonstrates its positive potential and becomes a conscious rejection of any role, of any function, of any perspective based on a utilitarian vision. The episode of the woollen blanket signals the unbridgeable distance which now separates Vitangelo from the rules of reality in which the judge who has come to interrogate him appears to be completely enmeshed. While the scrupulous functionary, completely absorbed in his role, collects the useful elements for his sentencing, Vitangelo contemplates with \\"ineffable delight\\" the woollen blanket covering his legs: \\"I saw the countryside: as if it were all an endless carpet of wheat; and, hugging it, I was beatified, feeling myself truly, in the midst of all that wheat, with a sense of immemorial distance that almost cause me anguish, a sweet anguish. Ah, to lose oneself there, lay down and abandon oneself, just like that among the grass, in the silence of the skies: to fill one's soul with all that useless blue, sinking into it every thought, every memory!\\" Once cured of his illness, Vitangelo has a completely new perspective, completely \\"foreign\\". He no longer desires anything and seeks to follow moment by moment the evolution of life in him and the things that surround him. He no longer has any history or past, he is no longer in himself but in everything around and outside of him.

Early life Elwes (pronounced \\"El-wez\\") was born on 24 August 1931 at Billing Hall, Northamptonshire, to English portrait painter, Simon Elwes (RA, KM), and the Hon. Gloria Rodd, daughter of the 1st Baron Rennell, PC, GCB, GCMG, GCVO, sometime British Ambassador to Rome, and Conservative M.P. for St. Marylebone (1928‚Äì1932). Elwes is descended from the Roman Catholic Cary-Elwes (sometimes known simply as Elwes) family which includes such noted British prelates, priests and monks as Abbott Columba Cary-Elwes, Bishop Dudley Cary-Elwes, and Father Luke Cary-Elwes. He was the grandson of Gervase Cary Elwes (1866‚Äì1921), a diplomat and professional classical tenor, and Lady Winifride Mary Elizabeth Feilding, daughter of the 8th Earl of Denbigh. He was a nephew of the English novelist, biographer and journalist Nancy Mitford, and a godson of Evelyn Waugh. One of his cousins was Tremayne Rodd, 3rd Baron Rennell. For his early education, Elwes spent much of his childhood during the Second World War in the United States, after which he returned to England to attend Downside School in Somerset. Elopement At age 26, Elwes met and wished to marry 19-year-old shipping heiress Tessa Kennedy, daughter of Geoffrey Ferrar Kennedy and Da≈°ka Ivanoviƒá. Kennedy's parents, however, disapproved of the relationship and instituted wardship proceedings. On 27 November 1957, Geoffrey Kennedy obtained a restraining order against Elwes from Justice Sir Ronald Roxburgh, barring the couple from marrying.San Antonio Light (11 December 1957, p. 9)Gossip: a history of high society, 1920‚Äì1970, p. 198, by Andrew Barrow The High Court Tipstaff was not authorised, however, to apprehend Elwes anywhere outside England or Wales. After initially attempting to marry in Scotland while being pursued by the press, Elwes and Kennedy eloped to Havana, Cuba, where they married in a civil ceremony on 27 January 1958 as guests of infamous American mobster Meyer Lansky, who provided accommodation for them at his hotel, the Habana Riviera. When Fidel Castro's revolution threatened the stability of the country the newlyweds fled aboard a raft with two National Geographic explorers who were sailing to Miami. From there they flew to New York City where they took out a marriage licence on 31 March.The New York Times (1 April 1958, p. 2) On 1 April, the couple repeated the ceremony to ensure they were legally married in Manhattan's Supreme Court officiated by Justice Henry Clay Greenberg.The New York Times, 2 April 1958, p. 63. On 15 July, the two set sail for England aboard the liner SS Libert√© docking at Southampton. The following day, accompanied by his wife and an attorney, Elwes turned himself over to authorities and was transferred to Brixton Prison where he remained for two weeks while awaiting trial for contempt of court for defying the judge's order to return Miss Kennedy to her parents. At trial the judge accepted that Elwes did love his bride but commented that every parent knows that love was not \\"readily convertible into bread and butter\\" for the support of a wife. In his ruling he directed that Elwes be released from custody but also ordered that Kennedy remain a ward of court. Elwes and Kennedy were married until the union was dissolved in London in January 1969. Elwes never remarried. He and Kennedy had three children, film producer Cassian Elwes, artist Damian Elwes, and actor Cary Elwes. Career In January 1960 Elwes became the assistant editor of Lilliput Magazine until its closure in July of that same year. From 1960‚Äì62, he was the Company Director of Dome Press where he began the newsweekly Topic Magazine as editorial director, along with William Rees-Davies and Maurice Macmillan. In 1963, together with Nicholas Luard, he published and subsequently became the director of Design Yearbook, which developed into the book-packaging firm November Books. The company's clients included Thames & Hudson, a publisher of books on art, architecture, design and visual culture. In 1964, he co-wrote a book with Luard, Refer to Drawer: Being a Penetrating Survey of a Shameful National Practice ‚Äì Hustling, which included illustrations by cartoonist John Glashan. Elwes subsequently became a member of the National Union of Journalists. Following in his father's footsteps Elwes then became a portrait painter, painting many of London's Clermont Set. Around 1967 he moved to Andalucia, Spain, where, with the aid of architect Philip Jebb, he designed a Mediterranean-style apartment complex, completed in 1970. Clients included Luard and the actor Hugh Millais. Elwes became part owner of a hair salon, Figurehead, on Pont Street, Knightsbridge. One of Elwes' portraits was of John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan, who disappeared in November 1974 after the murder of his children's nanny. Death Elwes committed suicide at 1 Stewart's Grove Chelsea with an overdose of barbiturates in 1975, about a month after the death of his father, and about a month before the death of his mother. His body was found by his girlfriend Melissa Wyndham.

Col. Simon Edmund Vincent Paul Elwes, (29 June 1902 ‚Äì 6 August 1975) was a British war artist and society portrait painter whose patrons included presidents, kings, queens, statesmen, sportsmen, prominent social figures and many members of the British Royal Family. He was a favorite of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Biography Elwes (pronounced \\"El-wiz‚Äù) was born on 29 June 1902 at Hothorpe Hall in Northamptonshire (also near Theddingworth, Leicestershire), the sixth and youngest son (two daughters were born later) of famed tenor Gervase Cary Elwes (1866‚Äì1921), and his wife, Lady Winifride Mary Elizabeth Feilding, daughter of The 8th Earl of Denbigh. He was the scion of the recusant Cary-Elwes family, of which many branches are known simply as \\"Elwes\\", which includes noted British monks and bishops, such as Abbott Columba Cary-Elwes, Archbishop Dudley Cary-Elwes and Father Luke Cary-Elwes. His niece, Polly Elwes, was a famous television personality in Britain. His grandson is the prominent English actor Cary Elwes. Elwes' mother was so determined to have a painter in the family she studied art and herself started painting while pregnant. For his education Elwes first attended two Catholic schools, Ladycross School in Seaford, and The Oratory School in Edgbaston. In 1918, at the age of sixteen, he was taken out of the Oratory and installed in the Slade School of Fine Art where Henry Tonks and Philip Wilson Steer taught. After the Slade Elwes spent eight years in Paris, first at the Acad√©mie Del√©cluse and then at the Academie des Beaux Arts. While there he met a Belgian refugee, Mme. La Forge, who aroused his latent interest in painting. Mme. La Forge gave him the run of her studio and encouraged him to start again where he had left off. In 1920, Elwes began studying in ernest at Andre Lhote's Academy in Montparnasse, Paris. Fellow students included Henri Cartier-Bresson, Conrad O'Brien-ffrench and Elena Mumm Thornton Wilson. While in Paris Elwes did a black and white drawing of the Irish tenor and recording artist, John McCormack. McCormack would say to his wife of Elwes: \\"This lad has remarkable talent and will do big things, mark my words.\\" From France Elwes visited art galleries in Germany, the Netherlands and Italy. In 1922, Elwes sailed to New York, having borrowed the fare. He repaid the loan by doing charcoal drawings at $5 to $20 apiece. During this visit he managed to draw President Harding from life. In 1926, he returned to England and on 25 November married the Hon. Gloria Elinor Rodd (born 1901), the daughter of the diplomat and scholar, Rennell Rodd, 1st Baron Rennell. Career After his return from New York a period of undistinguished hard work followed until his portrait of Mrs. James Montgomery Beck, Jr. (n√©e Mary Ridgely Carter) was hung at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1930. A flood of orders followed the next day and continued to do so. The following year Elwes showed another portrait at the Academy of Lady Lettice Lygon, the first of many aristocratic sitters that would include many of Britain's royal family. Thereafter, his portraits hung in the summer exhibition of the Royal Academy every year. From London's Mayfair to Manhattan's Park Avenue Elwes soon began to establish himself as a stylish, sought-after portraitist. In 1929, Elwes was created a Knight of Malta and four years later was elected a member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. In 1930, Elwes was invited to paint Robert Baden-Powell founder of the Scout movement. When asked by the artist in a letter how he would like to pose for this, Baden-Powell replied:E.E. Reynolds, B-P: The Story of His Life, London, Oxford University Press, 1943. Ch. XIII. Coming-of- Age That same year he painted a portrait of The Hon. Lady Aitken. A year later his portrait of the Hon. Mrs. Roger Chetwode was one of nine portraits chosen to be exhibited at The Royal Society of Portrait Painters 45th Annual Show. In 1936, Elwes was commissioned to paint the then Duke of York, in uniform as colonel-in-chief of the 11th Hussars. That December he was commissioned by the new King to paint himself and the Queen, of whom Elwes said, \\"No couple ever was more popular in England, even before this happened\\". Two years later he was commissioned to paint another royal portrait of Queen Mary. In December 1938, an exhibition of his work was held at the M. Knoedler & Co. Gallery at 14 East 57th Street in Manhattan which included that portrait. Second World War Lieutenant General R G W H Stone CB, DSO, MC, FRGS (1942) by Simon Elwes At the outbreak of the Second World War, Elwes initially joined the Welsh Guards. He was later transferred to the 10th Royal Hussars and was stationed in North Africa and Egypt serving as a lieutenant colonel. After fighting in the battles of Benghazi, Mersa Matruh and Knightsbridge, he was made an official war artist by the local Army command. His role as a war artist was recognized when the War Artists' Advisory Committee purchased several of his works. Whilst stationed in Cairo in 1942 he painted portraits of King Farouk, his wife Queen Farida, their daughter Princess Ferial, and General (later Field Marshal) Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, General Officer Commanding (GOC) British Troops in Egypt. In South Africa, he painted the portraits of Paul I of the Hellenes, his wife Frederica of Hanover as well as Prime Minister J. C. Smuts and his wife. He painted two other Field Marshals: Sir Claude Auchinleck and in India, Viceroy Archibald Wavell. While there he did portraits of the Maharaja of Patiala, Lord Mountbatten, and various Indian Army soldiers who had won the Victoria Cross, namely Naik Nand Singh, 11th Sikh Regiment; Havildar Gaje Ghale, 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles; Company Havildar Major Chellu Ram, 4/6 Rajputana Rifles; Major Premindra Singh Bhagat, 21st Bombay Sappers and Havildar Parkash Singh, 8th Punjab Regiment. In Delhi, Elwes also gave art lessons sponsored by Lady Wavell (wife of the Viceroy) at the Viceregal Palace. Other instructors included American war artist Millard Sheets. Stroke and Fountains Abbey In 1945, Elwes suffered a near-fatal stroke which paralyzed the right half of his face and body, including his painting hand. He was diagnosed with hemiplegia. Believing that he was about to die, Elwes received the last sacraments. He spent two years in hospital recuperating and, after receiving treatment from renowned physiotherapist Berta Bobath, was soon able to stand with the aid of a cane. During his recovery, Elwes stated that he repeatedly dreamed of the ruins of Fountains Abbey which he had visited in 1933. In the dream he saw the abbey restored and himself talking with one of the monks who kept saying: \\"It was built for God; it must be returned to God.\\" Elwes became convinced that God had ruined him physically because he had wasted his talent and that he had been chosen to restore the abbey and rededicate it as a monastery. Although he never accomplished his dream, Elwes enlisted the aid of the Duke of Norfolk, Cardinal Spellman; the Marchioness of Lothian; novelist Evelyn Waugh; Lord Lovat and many of Britain's leading Roman Catholic laymen. Later years He never regained the use of his right hand, but taught himself to paint with his left surmounting his disability enough to become president of the Guild of Catholic Artists, and vice-president of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters from 1953 to 1957. In 1947, he visited Hollywood and painted a number of movie stars including Gloria Swanson and Bert Lahr. He had become enough of a celebrity himself that in 1949, whilst bedridden in the South of France after suffering a stroke, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill told Lord Beaverbrook: In 1953, Elwes was commissioned by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, to paint the 1948 investiture of her daughter, then Princess Elizabeth with the Order of the Garter by her father King George VI. The next year he would paint a full-length portrait of the Queen, which remains part of the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. In 1956, Elwes was appointed an associate of the Royal Academy. Besides the Queen he painted King George VI, Princess Margaret and the Duchess of Kent and by 1960, had painted every member of the Royal Family except the Duke of Windsor. Elwes also received a large commission by Viscount Camrose to do a conversation piece of leading members of White's club, of which he was a member. The sitters were Lord Birkenhead, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., David Stirling, Evelyn Waugh and the Duke of Devonshire set in the coffee room of the club. In 1960, Elwes joined an exhibition of other portraitists at the Portraits, Inc. gallery on West 51st St. in Manhattan. In 1963, he held an exhibition of his work at the Palm Beach Galleries which included portraits of The Hon. John Hay Whitney, (a former Ambassador to the Court of St. James's), Eleanor Robson Belmont, Madame Alain Bertrand, Mr. & Mrs. John S. Borden, Mrs. Henry Pomeroy Davison, William Cox Wright and Randolph Churchill. In 1967, Elwes was made a full member of the Royal Academy. One observer, who witnessed him there in his later years, recalls him as being: \\"Handsome, fresh of complexion, finely dressed, with a scarlet flower in his buttonhole, he enriched the proceedings with his smile, no less than with his air of being a visitor from a world more carefree and elegant than the one in which deficits and disappointments were certain to be discussed.\\" Many of Elwes' paintings can be found in museums, palaces and academies around the world. Some of his early sketches form part of Mark Birley's private collection at Annabel's nightclub in Berkeley Square. In the last months of his life, he had to be pushed about in a wheelchair, hardly able to speak. Even though his face had grown thinner and paler, had a look of the greatest nobility. Elwes died on 6 August 1975, in Amberley, West Sussex. He and his wife Gloria had four sons, Peter, father of Painter Luke Elwes, Giles, who died in infancy, Tim and Dominick, who died one month after his father. His wife died in October of that year.

The name of the movement is derived from the Tagalog word \\"Sakdal\\", which means \\"to accuse\\" and a nod to the J'Accuse‚Ä¶! editorial of the French novelist Emile Zola. The movement‚Äôs platform was centered upon immediate independence, estate redistribution, taxation reductions, and greater governmental transparency. The movement lasted until 1935, when the Sakdalista leaders organized an active uprising that quickly failed, causing the party to dissolve. The movement is estimated to have had 20,000 formal members that influenced hundreds of thousands of Filipinos in the early 1930s. Identity of the movement The central goal of the Sakdalistas was simple: they wanted complete and immediate independence from the United States of America, which they believed would be the most effective means towards the alleviation of crippling taxation. The movement was born out of frustrations with corruption and inequality. Benigno Ramos described these sentiments in a December 1930 editorial: \\"In Manila we see our so-called leaders growing fat and rich on money amassed from taxing the poor. They have fine automobiles and fine homes for themselves, but for us they have only fine and empty words. They have learned to promise as much as the Americans and to deliver as little.\\" People joined the Sakdalista movement for a variety of reasons. The party fearlessly exposed the wrongdoings of politicians, was truly compassionate about the poor and oppressed, was uncompromising in its stand on independence, and possessed integrity in terms of living up to its record of not being after the people‚Äôs money. Its members perceived the movement as being very honest, as it was founded by a small group of modest middle-class citizens. The party had a truly hopeful vision of the future. The Sakdalistas believed that, if independence were gained, the government would be able to right all of its past wrongs by giving land back to the landless, looking after the workers' welfare, nationalizing industries, providing youths with truly Filipino educations, setting up a pro-people judiciary, and keeping a close watch on the performance of politicians. The consensus was that this would all result in citizens not committing crimes because of a new independent standard of life where everybody would be rich, happy, and comfortable.  Benigno Ramos  Benigno Ramos (1893‚Äì1946) spent his youth and formative years working as a poet, schoolmaster, government clerk, and newspaper editor before he was hired by Manuel Quezon to become a full-time translator for the Senate in 1917. He spent thirteen years as an influential speechwriter and orator, and in the process he amassed a small but solid following of political admirers by speaking for Quezon at party functions in Manila and Bulacan. A falling out with Quezon in June 1930 caused Ramos to resign from his government positions at the request of the Senate President. Ramos began publishing the Sakdal newspaper, thus founding the Sakdalista movement. After managing the paper for four years, Ramos made the strategic shift towards actively campaigning for Sakdalistas to get seats in government positions rather than simply pushing critical writings through the newspaper. The Sakdalistas had several unexpected electoral victories throughout the 1934 general election, making Benigno more famous than ever. Ramos observed the massive failure of the May 1935 uprising from Tokyo. He refused to acknowledge the loss, and countered, \\"we know the American Government in the Islands is so strong that revolt against it means suicide. But what else can we do?\\" Ramos‚Äô response to the uprising cut his power, and public opinion quickly shifted against him. He permanently moved to Japan in order to continue his work on Filipino independence by forming the Ganap political party. He spent the years 1939 to 1942 in jail for illegal solicitation of money, and after his release he helped found the Kalibapi and Makapili political organizations. He possibly died in a plane crash in 1946, but the details of his death remain unknown.  History of the movement = Origins  In February 1930, an American teacher working in the Philippines, Mabel Brummitt, made racist insults toward several high school students, referring to them as \\"a bunch of sweet potato eaters\\" and \\"monkeys\\". In retaliation to the teacher's racist comments, the students staged high-profile walkout protests. Benigno Ramos found that he was sympathetic to the students' cause, so he decided to participate in the protests. Ramos was an eloquent high-level government employee, and his vocal dissent was at odds with the beliefs of future Filipino president Manuel Quezon. Quezon was a senator at the time, and also served as Ramos' employer and mentor. He insisted that Ramos resign from his government positions upon hearing about his participation in the protest, and on June 18, Ramos acquiesced. Angered by the government's response to the protest, Ramos decided to establish a newspaper that would serve as a pulpit to air his criticisms of the current Filipino regime. Using personal funds as well as donations from friends and admirers, the first issue of his fortnightly newspaper, Sakdal, was published on October 13, 1930. The distribution of this first issue signaled the formal beginning of the Sakdalista movement.  1931‚Äì32  The paper consisted of defenses of weak, impoverished, and exploited citizens in the Philippines. Any critic of the current regime was able to contribute editorials to the paper, and circulation grew to 18,494 subscribers by the end of 1931. The paper depended upon government-sanctioned mailing privileges, and so thus the writers were sometimes forced to avoid sensitive topics at certain tense moments at the risk of having their voices silenced completely. In addition to regularly printing criticism of officials, Sakdalistas collected donations for exiled sympathizers, boycotted foreign goods, and gave speeches at the request of various organizations in locations ranging from Pampanga to Zambales to Marinduque. In 1932, the organization raised enough funds through donations in order to buy their own printing press, which streamlined the publication process. Near the end of the year, Sakdal subscribers raised several thousand pesos to send Benigno Ramos on a diplomatic trip to the United States of America in order to protest the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act in front of Congress. Ramos would bring copies of Sakdal with him to disperse along the way in order to rally foreign sympathizers to his cause. = The Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act = This law originated with rural American farmer political action committees. The American PACs believed that Filipino imports posed great dangers to their economic welfare during the Great Depression. The act would subject Filipinos to official United States tariffs and commence a ten-year transition towards independence. The Sakdalistas believed that ten years was an excessively long waiting period, and thus vehemently disapproved of the bill. The Filipino Nacionalista Party was in favor of the act, which was eventually approved by the United States Congress in early 1933 after a veto from President Herbert Hoover was overturned.  1933  Ramos left for the United States of America on April 10, and Sakdal editor Celerino Tiongco became the acting manager of the newspaper in his absence. Ramos toured through California, Utah, and Denver over several months, finally arriving in Washington D.C. in July. To the Sakdalistas' dismay, Ramos was unable to stop the passage of the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act because of his leisurely pace through the west. He had arrived to the capital too late to act. Ramos‚Äô ineffective tour caused a great sense of frustration within the Sakdalista party. The management concluded that their standard methods of political demonstration and critical press were not going to be effective in advancing towards independence. Furthermore, the incumbent legislators in the Philippines were certainly not going to change their minds on the subject. Considering the fact that the country‚Äôs general election was set to occur the next year, they decided that the only way forward was to form their own political party and gain official seats in congress. Thus, the official Sakdalista political party was formed in mid-October, 1933.  1934  Chapters of the movement were established all across the Philippines in preparation for the June Senate and House elections. The Sakdalistas made a credible showing, winning all three seats that they ran for in the House of Representatives. A Sakdalista became governor of the Marinduque province. Additionally, \\"[i]n Laguna, Bulacan, Rizal, and Cavite, the party's candidates for municipal offices made remarkable showings and won more than a score of important posts.\\" These numerous victories were certainly not strong enough to truly challenge the Nacionalista‚Äôs support of the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act (a successor to the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act), but they were enough to move the Sakdalista movement into the limelight and illustrate the extent of rural discontent in the Philippines. The Nacionalista party quickly realized the true power of the Sakdalista movement. They immediately resolved petty intra- party differences in order to close ranks and politically exclude the Sakdalistas. To counter this political obstacle, Ramos traveled to Japan in November in an attempt to gain foreign support after his failed tour through the United States. = The Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act = This act, enacted March 24, 1934, was the direct successor of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act from the year before. It, like the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act, also promised independence after 10 years, to which Ramos responded \\"[h]ow many ‚ÄòTen Years‚Äô does the U.S. Government need to kill our independence, and‚Ä¶ confiscate all the lands of the Filipinos?\\" (Sturtevant Book, 231). The act was one of the central motivating factors behind the continued frustrations of the Sakdalista party, and it inspired Ramos to embrace the idea of more drastic methods of protestation.  1935  The Sakdalistas in power promised their constituents that the Philippines would have complete and absolute independence by December 31, 1935 if they had their way in congress. Aside from continuing the usual inflammatory diatribe, Ramos laid out seven new objectives: #Investigation of religious lands #Formation of a 500,000-man Philippine Army #Teaching of native dialects in the public schools #Retention of lawyers to defend poor clients #Reduction of official salaries #Pay increases for teachers, policemen, and laborers. #Adoption of voting machines to prevent election frauds With the party officially recognized in Congress, the Sakdalistas were more hopeful than ever. However, the newfound hope was quickly extinguished by the political exclusion perpetrated by the Nacionalista party. Thus, the Sakdalistas instituted a drastic shift in strategy. = The May 2 Uprising = The Sakdalista party had grown quickly over a short period of time, and by early April, their activities in the provinces surrounding Manila were causing concern in government circles. The Filipino government, anticipating escalating acts of public unrest, stifled the Sakdal newspaper by revoking its mailing rights and by ordering that public meetings could only be held with government-sponsored permits. These measures proved unsuccessful, however, because Ramos had succeeded in printing and smuggling thousands of copies of a Japanese-sponsored pamphlet entitled \\"Free Filipinos\\" while on his tour of Japan. The pamphlet offered the illusion of popular Japanese support for the Sakdal cause. The false Japanese approval combined with the numerous frustrations of the Sakdalistas, and a popular uprising was planned. Late on May 1, 1935, Sakdalista activists spread the word that the endeavor to achieve independence would begin within twenty-four hours. Hesitant party members were told that, in the event of retaliatory American military action, Japan would intervene with support on the side of the Sakdalistas. Additionally, many were told that the police and constabularymen had become sympathetic to the Sakdalista cause, and would assist in the uprising by throwing down their weapons. During the evening of May 2, it is estimated that as many as 68,000 Sakdalistas convened at prearranged locations in order to march on several municipalities. They expected the police to throw down their weapons as allies, but were instead greeted with intentional rifle fire. The Washington Post reported that there had been 69 deaths by noon on May 3, and more than 1,000 protesters had been arrested. The rebellion had been immediately crushed, and the organizers of the protest went into hiding. The scale of the demonstration had been impressive, but was not nearly large enough to overthrow a nation of twelve million people, especially one backed firmly by the might of the United States.  Aftermath and legacy of the movement  The Sakdalistas had been decisively defeated in their attempted uprising, and the public opinion of Benigno Ramos quickly sank to an all-time low. However, the party‚Äôs efforts were not completely in vain. Congress assumed a more empathetic stance towards the Sakdalista mentality, and thus granted three concessions. # Initiation of a program of land redistribution via various estate purchases. # Formation of the National Rice and Corn Corporation to provide storage facilities for small farmers. # Allocation of funds to pay public defenders in legal trials of the nations poorest citizens. Despite these parliamentary successes, dissidents became progressively more dispersed in the absence of Ramos‚Äô guiding charisma. He rarely returned to the Philippines, and Sakdal ceased to be published. It was impressive that such a diverse body of citizens had been brought under one banner by a middle-class leader, but the formal movement had come to an end, and little progress had been made for the poorest Filipino citizens.

It advocated the use of small, heavily armed vessels to combat larger battleships, and the use of commerce raiders to cripple the trade of the rival nation. The idea was developed among French naval theorists: the French government had the second largest navy of the time, and the theorists desired to counteract the strength of the larger British Royal Navy. Small units against battleships One of the first proponents of the Jeune √âcole was the artillery general Henri-Joseph Paixhans, who invented explosive shell guns for warships during the 1820s. He advocated the use of these powerful guns on numerous small steam warships that could destroy much larger battleships. The 1900 French submarine Narval Later, the French Navy developed the concept more elaborately as it experimented with torpedoes and torpedo boats. The French Navy became one of the strongest proponents of this combat system by the end of the 19th century. The naval successes of the French Navy against China during the Sino-French War of 1883‚Äì85 also tended to validate the potential of torpedo boats against conventional navies. France was also very active in the development of a submarine fleet, again trying to rely on technical development to compensate for British numerical superiority of battleships. By the beginning of the 20th century, France was \\"undoubtedly the first navy to have an effective submarine force\\". Counter measures against the Jeune √âcole system consisted largely of destroyers, designed to deter and destroy small torpedo units (in French, \\"destroyer\\" is contre-torpilleur, and in English, \\"destroyer\\" is a contraction of \\"torpedo boat destroyer\\"), the first of which was the Destructor. Commerce raiders Dupuy de L√¥me, an early armored cruiser. The other constitutive part of the Jeune √âcole concept consisted of planning to raid the commercial ships of the enemy so as to curtail its trade and economy, again a tactic designed especially against Great Britain. Raiding ships, such as the Dupuy de L√¥me were designed for this role. Dupuy de L√¥me, an armored cruiser, laid down during 1888, was capable of 23 knots, and designed to raid enemy commerce ships during extended forays afloat. Influences The Jeune √âcole system was particularly influential on the development of smaller navies, including the Imperial Japanese Navy during the 19th century, which tried to compensate for weaknesses in battleships. British admiral John \\"Jackie\\" Fisher, who would later become the First Sea Lord in 1904, was especially impressed by the ideas of Jeune √âcole and felt that the threats of fast raiders and swarms of torpedo boats made the traditional battleship too unwieldy. He argued that the future lay with fast ships with light armor and big guns, which would become known as the battlecruiser, and actively promoted both its development and large scale deployment in the first decade of the 20th century.

On January 18, 1969 at approximately 18:21 PST it crashed into Santa Monica Bay, Pacific Ocean, about 11.5 miles west of Los Angeles International Airport, four minutes after takeoff. Rescuers (at the time) speculated that an explosion occurred aboard the plane, a Boeing 727. Three and a half hours after the crash three bodies had been found in the ocean along with parts of fuselage and a United States mail bag carrying letters with that day's postmark. Hope was dim for survivors because the aircraft was configured for domestic flights and did not carry liferafts or lifejackets. A Coast Guard spokesman said it looked \\"very doubtful that there could be anybody alive.\\" Up until 2013, United used \\"Flight 266\\" designation on its San Francisco-Chicago (O'Hare) route.  Flight crew  The crew of Flight 266 was Captain Leonard Leverson, 49, a veteran pilot who had been with United Airlines for 22 years and had almost 13,700 flying hours to his credit. His first officer was Walter Schlemmer, 33, who had approximately 7,500 hours, and the flight engineer was Keith Ostrander, 29, who had 634 hours. Between them the crew had more than 4,300 hours of flight time on the Boeing 727.  Accident  The Boeing 727-22C aircraft, registration was almost new and had been delivered to United Airlines only four months earlier. It had less than 1100 hours of operating time. The aircraft had had a nonfunctional #3 generator for the past several days leading up to the accident. Per standard procedure, the crew placed masking tape over the switches and warning lights for the generator. Approximately two minutes after takeoff, the crew reported a fire warning on engine #1 and shut it off. The crew radioed to departure control that they only had one functioning generator and needed to come back to the airport, but it turned out to be their last communication, with subsequent attempts to contact Flight 266 proving unsuccessful. Shortly after engine #1 shut down, the #2 generator also ceased operating for reasons unknown. The NTSB was unable to determine why the #2 generator had failed after it had become the plane's sole power source, nor why the \\"standby electrical system either was not activated or failed to function.\\" Several witnesses saw Flight 266 take off and reported seeing sparks emanating from either engine #1 or the rear of the fuselage, while others claimed an engine was on fire. Salvage operations were conducted to recover the wreckage of the aircraft, but not much useful information was gleaned as the cockpit instruments were not recovered. The wreckage was in approximately 930 feet (280 meters) of water and had been severely fragmented, however the relatively small area in which it was spread indicated an extremely steep, nose-down angle at impact. There was little in the way of identifiable human remains at the wreckage site, only two passengers were identified and only one intact body was found. The #2 and #3 engines suffered severe rotational damage from high RPM speeds at impact, but the #1 engine had almost no damage because it had been powered off. No evidence of any fire or heat damage was found on the engines, thus disproving the witnesses' claims. The small portion of the electrical system that was recovered did not provide any relevant information. The CVR took four weeks to locate and recover. NTSB investigators could not explain the sparking seen by witnesses on the ground and theorized that it might have been caused by debris being sucked into the engine, a transient compressor stall or an electrical system problem that led to the eventual power failure. They also were unable to explain the engine #1 fire warning in the absence of a fire, but this may have resulted from electrical system problems or a cracked duct that allowed hot engine air to set off the temperature sensors. The sensors from the #1 and #2 engines were recovered and exhibited no signs of malfunction. Some tests indicated that it was indeed possible for the #2 generator to fail from an overload condition as a result of the operating load being suddenly shifted onto it following the #1 generator's shutdown, and this was maintained as a possible cause of the failure. N7434U had recently been fitted with a generator control panel that had been passed around several different UAL aircraft because of several malfunctions. After being installed in N7434U the month prior to the ill-fated flight, generator #3 once again caused operating problems was swapped with a different unit. Since that generator was subsequently tested and found to have no mechanical issues, the control panel was identified as the problem after it caused further malfunctions with the replacement generator. Busy operating schedules and limited aircraft availability meant that repair work on N7434U was put on hold, with nothing that could be done in the meantime except to disable the #3 generator. The NTSB investigators believed that the inoperative #3 generator probably was not responsible for the #2 generator's in-flight failure since it was assumed to be isolated from the rest of the electrical system. With the loss of all power to the lights and flight attitude instruments, flying at night in instrument conditions, the pilots quickly became spatially disorientated and unable to know which inputs to the flight controls were necessary to keep the plane flying normally. Consequently, the crew lost control of the aircraft and crashed into the ocean in a steep nose- down angle, killing everyone on board. The flight control system would not have been affected by the loss of electrical power, since it relied on hydraulic and mechanical lines, so it was concluded that loss of control was the result of the crew's inability to see around the cockpit. It was theorized that the backup electrical system had not been activated because the crew could not locate the switch for it in darkness. The CVR and FDR both lost power just after the crew informed ATC of the fire warning on engine #1. At an unknown later point, both resumed operation for a short period of time. The FDR came back online for 15 seconds, the CVR nine seconds during which time it recorded the crew discussing their inability to see where the plane was. No sounds of the plane impacting the water could be heard when this second portion of the recording ceased. At the time, a battery-powered backup source for critical flight instruments was not required on commercial aircraft. The accident prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to require all transport-category aircraft to carry backup instrumentation, powered by a source independent of the generators.

In 1561 he was given two years' leave from his duties as Vicar of Dewsbury (1554-1570) and Rector of Thornhill (1558-1570/78) to travel the country with the objective of mapping England. Although he does not appear to have completed this objective, it was completed by his apprentice, Christopher Saxton. Saxton was employed by Rudd as a servant and it seems likely that he accompanied him on these trips, and learned draughting and surveying skills from his master. As well as various benefices, Rudd held a prebend at Durham. He and his wife Isabel (whom he had to renounce during Mary's reign) had at least three daughters and three sons, of whom John (1568-1640) followed his father in ministry. After becoming embroiled in controversy at Cambridge, leading to an appearance before the High Commission, the younger John settled down as Vicar of Shephall (near Stevenage) in Hertfordshire, where his memorial takes the form of a map cartouche, with a depiction of him as the Good Shepherd, brandishing a very episcopal-looking crook!

Part of the Tweed Valley Forest Park along with Traquair Forest in Innerleithen, it is the home of a mountain biking centre which is one of the 7stanes mountain bike trails operated throughout southern Scotland by Forestry and Land Scotland. There are currently 5 mountain bike waymarked routes and a freeride park in Glentress Forest. The historic cycle trails, aimed at children and families, provide an interesting way to explore the forest and its history. The blue, red, and black mountain bike routes provide a challenge for all abilities. The red route is noted for a high-speed section with many bermed corners known as Spooky Woods. The green trail is a \\"skills loop\\", and is designed for those new to mountain biking, although there are some challenges for those wishing to practice rocky sections or raised wooden trails too. History During the 1930s, unemployed men were set to work in Glentress Forest, breaking ground, building tracks, and undertaking other heavy labour. The men lived in a work camp at Eshiels, which was one of a number of so-called Instructional Centres run by the Ministry of Labour in order to 'harden' young men who had been out of work for some time. By 1938, the Ministry was operating 35 Instructional Centres across Britain, with a total capacity of over 6,000 places. By 1939, unemployment was declining in the face of impending war, and the Ministry closed down its work camps. The forest itself was planted in the 1920s in response to the national shortage of timber brought about by the First World War. Some of the original stands of Douglas Fir still remain to this day. There are remains of an Iron Age hill fort at the top of Janet's Brae which offers a spectacular vista over the town of Peebles. A short walk will lead to the site where a reconstruction of a timber round house from the same Iron Age period used to stand until it was burnt down in 2010.

Its name comes from its former function as the location for the King Edward VII College of Medicine, the first school of medicine in the Straits Settlements. History The Straits and Federated Malay States Government Medical School was established in 1905 in a former women's mental asylum at Sepoy Lines as Singapore's first medical training institution. It was subsequently renamed the King Edward VII College of Medicine in 1921. To help accommodate the expanding medical school, the College of Medicine Building was built in 1926. The medical college would go on to occupy this building even while it later became the Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya and its successor institutions the University of Singapore and National University of Singapore. In 1982, the Faculty of Medicine moved into new buildings and a new National University Hospital erected at the new Kent Ridge campus of the National University of Singapore. The College of Medicine Building was preserved as the seat of the Academy of Medicine, whose members are largely alumni of the medical school. From 1985 to 1987, the building underwent restoration. The College of Medicine Building was gazetted as a national monument on 2 December 2002. Architecture The College of Medicine Building was built in reinforced concrete with a massive, floral Neo-Classical fa√ßade of Doric columns. This grand colonnade, designed by Italian sculptor Cavaliere Rudolfo Nolli, dominates the building's fa√ßade, with bas reliefs depicting the Allegory of Healing on the walls on either side. Behind this colonnade are a row of eleven enormous doors. A sculptured Roman spread-eagle, encircled by a wreath, emblazons above the central doorway. At one time, there was a long, elliptical pool of water in front of the building, which helped to reflect and soften its massive image, but this pool has long since vanished. During the building's restoration in the 1980s, a grand staircase in the main lobby, which was in the original plan but never built, was installed as originally intended.

SOVA differs from the classical Viterbi algorithm in that it uses a modified path metric which takes into account the a priori probabilities of the input symbols, and produces a soft output indicating the reliability of the decision. The first step in the SOVA is the selection of the survivor path, passing through one unique node at each time instant, t. Since each node has 2 branches converging at it (with one branch being chosen to form the Survivor Path, and the other being discarded), the difference in the branch metrics (or cost) between the chosen and discarded branches indicate the amount of error in the choice. This cost is accumulated over the entire sliding window (usually equals at least five constraint lengths), to indicate the soft output measure of reliability of the hard bit decision of the Viterbi algorithm.

History By the late 1970s, the Chaosium staff realized that Steve Perrin's RuneQuest system had the potential to become a \\"house system\\", where one set of game mechanics could be used for multiple games; Greg Stafford and Lynn Willis proved that theory by boiling down the RuneQuest rules into the thin 16-page Basic Role-Playing (1980). Hero Games used their Champions rules as the basis for their Hero System. The Pacesetter house system centered on a universal \\"action table\\" that used one chart to resolve all game actions. Steve Jackson became interested in publishing a new roleplaying system, designed by himself, with three goals: that it be detailed and realistic; logical and well-organized; and adaptable to any setting and any level of play; this system was eventually released as GURPS (1986). The D&D-derived; Palladium house system ultimately encompassed all of the Palladium Books titles. Mekton II (1987) by R. Talsorian Games revealed for the first time the full-fledged Interlock System. In 1990, Game Designers' Workshop released the Twilight: 2000 second edition game system, and decided to turn it into their house system, an umbrella under which all future games would be designed. TSR's Amazing Engine was a universal game system, a simple beginner's system. In 1996, Hero Games partnered with R. Talsorian and decided to create a new, simpler rules system to attract new players, merging it with the Interlock game system and calling it Fuzion. Dragonlance: Fifth Age (1996) was built on TSR's new SAGA storytelling game system, which centered on resource management (through cards) rather than die rolls. TSR published Alternity (1997), another universal system, this one directed only toward science-fiction games. West End Games' MasterBook system had failed to catch on as a house system, so they decided to publish another, the D6 System, based on their most well-known and well-tested game system, Star Wars RPG. Development While early role- playing games relied heavily on either group consensus or the judgement of a single player (the \\"Dungeon Master\\" or Game Master) or on randomizers such as dice, later generations of narrativist games allow role-playing to influence the creative input and output of the players, so both acting out roles and employing rules take part in shaping the outcome of the game. An RPG system also affects the game environment, which can take any of several forms. Generic role-playing game systems, such as Basic Role-Playing, GURPS, and Fate, are not tied to a specific storytelling genre or campaign setting and can be used as a framework to play many different types of RPG. Others, such as Dungeons & Dragons, are designed to depict a specific genre or style of play, and still others, such as Paranoia, are not only genre-specific but come bundled with a specific campaign setting to which the game mechanics are inseparably tied. In fact, in more psychological games such as Call of Cthulhu, King Arthur Pendragon, Unknown Armies, and Don't Rest Your Head, aspects of the game system are designed to reinforce psychological or emotional dynamics that evoke a game world's specific atmosphere. Many role- playing game systems involve the generation of random numbers by which success or failure of an action is determined. This can be done using dice (probably the most common method) or cards (as in Castle Falkenstein), but other methods may be used depending on the system. The random result is added to an attribute which is then compared to a difficulty rating, although many variations on this game mechanic exist among systems. Some (such as the Storyteller/Storytelling System and the One-Roll Engine) use dice pools instead of individual dice to generate a series of random numbers, some of which may be discarded or used to determine the magnitude of the result. However, some games (such as the Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game and Nobilis) use no random factor at all. These instead use direct comparison of character ability scores to difficulty values, often supplemented with points from a finite but renewable pool. These \\"resource points\\" represent a character's additional effort or luck, and can be used strategically by the player to influence the success of an action.

They are ectoparasites of a wide range of birds including chickens, which makes them important to understand for veterinary science and for human health. However, Menoponidae are not exclusive to poultry and are common parasites for migratory birds, with more and more species being discovered every year. Biology Genera and species within the Family Menoponidae are identified by their short antennae, concealed in grooves behind the eyes. To the untrained eye, it may appear as though they have no antennae. Most lice also further specialize to specific regions on their hosts such as the fluff at the base of the tail, the head, and the shaft. In fact, if a species that is better suited to tail feathers is presented with the opportunity to infest a different type of feather, they will make an attempt to eat those feathers but will fail to reproduce and soon die. As a group within the order Amblycera, lice within the family Menoponidae are still partially dependent on blood as a source of food and are therefore better able to be generalists. The lice will scratch and nibble at the base of the feather in order to obtain this blood and modified mouth organs, such as the hypopharynx, is used to collect the blood. Due to their ability to utilize blood as a source of food, families in the Sub-Order Amblycera, such as Menoponidae, often do not specialize to specific locations on the host and will lay their eggs most anywhere on the host. This lack of specialization often makes it more difficult to distinguish one species from another in Menoponidae, without the use of microscopic techniques. As with all lice, those in the family Menoponidae have the capability of reproducing quickly and causing large-scale outbreaks. Due to the close contact of poultry in large-scale productions, this capability is often acutely realized. Ecology Lice in the family Menoponidae, due to their ability to feed on blood, are often the first parasites found on birds, especially birds with nidifugous young. Nidifugous young are born with feathers and therefore are particularly susceptible to lice in the family Menoponidae. Menoponidae lice frequently have a wider range of distribution among species. In a study of 25 heavily infested birds in India, lice in the family Menoponidae were the most- common parasites.

The first five prototypes were completed by August 1945. It was powered by a 6-litre, 8-cylinder engine producing and giving a top speed of over . It was made in both sedan and convertible versions. The ZIS was rumored to use machinery from the Packard 180 assembly line which was sent to the USSR after American production ended. However, according to The Fall of the Packard Motor Car Company, Ward, James A. The Fall of the Packard Motor Car Company, 1995, Page 46 there is no evidence whatsoever in the Packard archives of such a transfer. Moreover, as one of the main results of the collection of information and material of Bert Hein, there can be many current opinions within the car literature disproved.Ward, James A.

Therefore more likely that the top commissars, including Joseph Stalin, owned several Packards and wanted their first effort at a luxury car to be based on what is arguably one of the top cars of the 1940s. These cars were often given away as gifts to foreign communist leaders such as Chinese leader Mao Zedong and North Korean premier Kim Il-sung. After Stalin, the ZIL 110 c cabriolet was used as a parade car for Nikita Khrushchev and this model was also gifted to Enver Hoxha, the lifelong president of Albania.

It is presently a subsidiary of British aero engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Holdings. It was established in 1989 as a joint venture between Spanish engineering conglomerate SENER and Rolls-Royce Plc. By 2015, it had grown to become as the ninth largest aircraft engine and components manufacturing company in the world in terms of revenue; the firm is also ranked among the top one hundred companies in the aerospace industry. ITP Aero includes among its activities the design, research and development, manufacturing and casting, assembly and testing of aeronautical engines. It also provides MRO services for a wide range of engines for regional airlines, business aviation, helicopters, industrial and defence applications. The company has a global network of production facilities in Spain, United Kingdom, Mexico, United States, Malta and India with over 3,500 employees. ITP Aero's headquarters are located in Zamudio, close to the city of Bilbao in Spain. History During 1989, Industria de Turbo Propulsores SA (ITP) was established. It was originally structured as a joint venture between Spanish engineering conglomerate SENER and British aero engine manufacturer Rolls- Royce Holdings. Its formation was closely associated with the creation of EuroJet Turbo GmbH, a multinational engine consortium to develop and produce the EJ200 turbojet engine to power the Eurofighter Typhoon. In 1990, ITP acquired an engine maintenance plant located in Ajalvir, Madrid, from Spanish aircraft manufacturer Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA (CASA). During the following year, it launched engine component manufacturing activity at its plant in Zamudio, Bizkaia. In 1992, the company secured its first contract with Rolls-Royce, performing work on the Rolls-Royce Trent turbofan engine for civilian airliners such as the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 767. During 1998, ITP began developing an international presence via its acquisition of a majority stake in Mexican engine specialist Turborreactores. In 2001, it created a new business unit dedicated to the Castings sector. By 2008, ITP had opened new overseas facilities in the United Kingdom, Malta and the United States. Over time, ITP has participated in various international aero engine programmes in both the military and civil sectors. Accordingly, it has collaborated with companies such as Rolls-Royce, General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, SNECMA and Honeywell on such endeavours. The company has specialised in the manufacture and development of gas turbine components and modules. It also offers in-house support services, such as maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) activities and high value-added services on behalf of other engine manufacturers. During the 2000s, ITP became involved in the production of the Europrop TP400, the largest turboprop engine developed in Europe, to power the Airbus A400M Atlas, a military transport plane. By this time, the firm was also engaged in multiple such collaborative defense aero engine programmes, such as EuroJet Turbo GmbH for the EJ200, and MTU Turbomeca Rolls- Royce for the MTR390. By the mid-2010s, ITP had become the ninth largest aero engine and components manufacturing company in the world in terms of revenue, employing roughly 3,000 people around the globe. It has been closely involved with Rolls-Royce on the latter's Trent engine family, having acted as a key risk and revenue sharing partner on the programme in addition to applying various turbine-related technologies. On 11 July 2016, Rolls-Royce Holdings announced that it was in the process of purchasing the outstanding 53.1% shareholding in the IPT joint venture in exchange for ‚Ç¨720m. The deal was promoted as increasing Rolls-Royce's long-term aftermarket revenues, along with its stake in various defense-related manufacturing and services programmes, such as the EuroProp consortium that produce the TP400 engine. During December 2017, final approval from Spanish authorities was received for the takeover. Presently, ITP Aero is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rolls-Royce. During June 2019, it was reported that Spanish technology group Indra Sistemas was engaging in discussions to purchase a minority stake in the company. During October 2019, there was some political tensions over a decision by ITP Engines UK to refuse to issue a quote or trial version of its ESATAN-TMS CAD software to a researcher from Istanbul Technical University; this refusal was stated by the company to be in-line with recent sanctions that had been enacted upon Turkey by the UK government.

Brown has been described as \\"the best-known prostitute in antebellum America\\". Brown was known for playing the piano in her brothel and for being a guest at functions hosted by the best families in New York. She also had season ticket to two theaters, paid for pews in various churches and contributed generously to local bible societies. She became a popular subject of tourist guidebooks, and her name appears often in diaries from the period. Brothel-keeping In the 1830s, Brown entered a brothel run by Rosina Townsend, and later a house owned by Adeline Miller, a well-known New York madam, in Miller Street, eventually becoming the manager of the house. She did not stay long, however; soon Brown was running a brothel of her own at 133 Reade Street. After a complaint from a neighbor, she was charged with common bawdy house. She pleaded guilty and shut the Reade Street premises, but continued to run brothels on Chapel, Church and Leonard Streets. Brown popularized the brothel ball, which were a risqu√© masked parties attended by some of New York's elite. These balls were well reported in the press. The Dixon's Polyanthos, a weekly with a circulation of around 10,000, carried a story on \\"Princess Julia's Palace of Love\\" in June 1941. The Leonard Street brothel was partially destroyed when the neighboring National Theater burnt down in 1841, and the rear wall of the theater collapsed on the brothel. A young woman, Margaret Yahgar, was killed by the fire that spread into the Brothel. Yahgar had left her parents home in Philadelphia a few days before to \\"board\\" with Brown. Brown allegedly sent her employees to save furniture and decor from the burning building. These were used to furnish her new ‚Äútwo thousand dollar parlor house\\" at another property in Leonard Street. The new brothel in Leonard Street became one of the most famous brothel in New York City, Fanny White, a.k.a. Jane Augusta Blankman once worked there. Vigilantes frequently violently targeted brothels in the area. Brown's brothel in Chapel Street was attacked in 1834, and following another attack in 1840, two men were found guilty of assaulting Brown and her prostitutes. As the Lower West Side pushed north, Brown moved with it. By the 1860s, Brown was running a stylish brothel at the corner of University Place and 12th Street. Her neighbours included James Lenox, William H. Aspinwall, the socialite Mrs Peter A. Schemerhorn and New York Public Library. The brothel was tolerated because the house and her customers caused no disruption. Social acceptance Despite her illicit occupation, Brown was a darling of the New York upper class. She received invitations to social galas across New York City, and her admirers nicknamed her Princess Julia. She sometimes threw balls of her own in the winter as a way to attract new patrons. Charles Dickens reportedly visited her on a trip through America. The penny press also followed her exploits; the major criticism levied against her was that the cut she took from her girls' earnings was too large. She was reputed to be worth $11,500.

Nicknamed Folkets Teater (en: \\"The People's Theater\\") by Jack Johnson, it has been the home ground of Odense Boldklub since the 1940s and has previously hosted select matches for FC Fyn (2011‚Äì2012), Boldklubben 1909, Boldklubben 1913 and Odense Boldklub Kvinde Elite (until 2016) during their tenures in the higher ranking leagues. With a current capacity of 15,790 (13,990 seatings; 13,573 seatings for international matches), it is the fifth largest football stadium of any football team in Denmark. It is part of the sports complex, known as Odense Sports Park (Danish: Odense Idr√¶tspark), that is owned by Odense Municipality and run by the company of Odense Idr√¶tspark (a department of \\"By- og Kulturforvaltningen, Fritid og biblioteker\\" under the municipality). The venue was inaugurated in August 1941 as Odense Stadium with major renovations made in the 1990s and 2000s. In recent years, it has been known under several names due to sponsorship arrangements; Fionia Park (2005‚Äì2010), TRE-FOR Park (2010‚Äì2016), EWII Park (2016‚Äì2018), and in June 2018 it was renamed Nature Energy Park, when the naming rights for Odense Boldklub's football matches and events was acquired by Nature Energy, an energy company. In FIFA and UEFA matches, it is known under its original name, Odense Stadium, due to sponsorship restrictions. The 1990‚Äì91 Danish Cup Finals were played at the stadium, which has also hosted 7 Danish Women's Cup Finals (1997/98‚Äì2002/03 and 2013/14) and several home matches for the both the Denmark national football team (since 1962) and the Denmark women's national football team (since 1984). Other uses have included hosting concerts with a capacity of 22,000 concertgoers, Fagenes Fest in 1948 and the DGI's Landsst√¶vnet in 1985.  History and development = Background and inauguration  Compared to other major Danish cities, it took a long time before a stadium was constructed in the city of Odense. The sports facilities in Odense after World War I have been described as being overall bad even though sports facilities exited in Kr√¶mmermarken and Odense Boldklub had its own sports facility. In the beginning of the 1920s, Aarhus and Aalborg inaugurated their own stadiums, which increased the local discussions regarding building a stadium in Odense, but a decision could not made in the first couple of years, partly due to the huge concerns by the dominating political party in the city council, Conservative People's Party. The stadium plans were finally approved by the then-mayor of Odense, Hans Christian Petersen (Conservative People's Party), and Odense Idr√¶tspark was founded on 27 December 1927, with the expectation that the municipality built the stadium, and the local sports clubs would run it. The building site for the city's first stadium was placed at Kildemosen, in an area located in the western section of the workshops for Sydfyenske Railways (SFJ) and 'Sukkerkogeriet Odense'. On 16 August 1931, the first edition of Odense Idr√¶tspark, was inaugurated with an association football match marked by pouring rain ‚Äì on the exhibition pitch without any grandstands ‚Äì between a selected Odense-team and the runners-up in the 1930‚Äì31 Austrian football championship, SK Admira Vienna, with the visitors securing a 9‚Äì2 win. At the beginning, the construction of the site went according to schedule, with a football field and fences being ready, but the sports clubs only managed to finish constructing half of the remaining part of the sports facility and the municipality refused to give any assistance. Due to the hard economic situation in the 1930s, the funding of the plans for improving the stadium's austere conditions could not be found. The stadium eventually never turned out to be the sports facility, it was intended to be for the local sports community, and in 1936, the administration of the stadium declared bankruptcy. Due to the lack of maintenance, the football pitch went into so much oblivion, that the Odense clubs decided they would rather play tournament matches on their own facilities. A memorial stone with no inscription, raised during the construction of the old stadium area, today marks the site, which has since been loaned out to KFUM's Boldklub Odense and Boldklubben Frem. The bankruptcy quickly triggered a new discussion about the construction of a new and much more comptemporary sports facility located at an alternative site, with either Kr√¶mmerparken, Fruens B√∏ge, Bolbro or Kildemosevej being suggested by the politicians. At the beginning of 1937, a vote by the politicians at Odense City Hall decided, that the new location of the second edition of Odense Idr√¶tspark and a contemporary stadium was to be placed at Bolbro, further west of the city center than the location of the old stadium. The vote took place only a few months before the next city council elections, where the Conservative People's Party and the Social Democrats fought fiercely for the power of the city council. The construction of the site broke ground in the spring of 1937 and was intended as a relief work for the unemployed, which meant that the contractor could not use major excavators ‚Äì the work had to be done by hand. The original design of the stadium was made by the Danish architect professor Edvard Thomsen (1884‚Äì1980) in cooperation with architect Vagn O. Kyed (1903‚Äì19??), and built in the period 1939‚Äì1941 with Odense Municipality as the developer. The original stadium design consisted of only one grandstand with a capacity of approximately 1,000 covered seats, while the rest of the stadium were standing areas, consisting of terraces on each side of the grandstand (southwest side), a long terrace on the opposite northeast side, a high terrace behind the goal in the southeast side, while there was no terrace behind the goal in the northwest side, that was on level with the playing field. In connection with stadium, a stadium tower, a stadium clock and a kiosk were located at the south entrance, which was the only official entrance in the fenced area, and with flagpoles placed in the south sections of the stadium. The construction cost of the entire sports facility, comprising five fields (an association football stadium with a total capacity of approximately 12,000 spectators, an athletics stadium, a cricket ground, a hockey pitch and a throwing lane), was DKK 1,314,266.26 kr. (1941), which corresponded to the yearly wage of approximately 350 unskilled workers, and was entirely funded by the municipality of Odense. The second edition of Odense Idr√¶tspark was officially inaugurated on 17 August 1941, when the Danish athletics championships were organized at the athletics stadium and speeches were held in the presence of the mayor of Odense, Ignatius Vilhelm Werner (Social Democrats), the chairman of National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark, Holten Castenschiold, 7,000 spectators and transmitted to the radio by Gunnar \\"Nu\\" Hansen. The first association football match at the stadium was an exhibition game played three weeks later, on 7 September 1941, a team representing the city of Odense ‚Äì featuring select players from the three highest ranking local clubs of the 1940‚Äì41 season, Boldklubben 1913, Boldklubben 1909 and Odense Boldklub playing in white shirts and black shorts/socks ‚Äì meet the reigning Danish champions, Boldklubben Frem, playing in white shorts and blue/red shirts and socks. Before the match, the mayor of Odense gave an inauguration speech, and the national anthem Der er et yndigt land was sung, following by giving up the ball to officially start the game, that ended with the Copenhagen team winning the match 6‚Äì2 after a quick initial 1‚Äì0 lead from the home team. The first goal was scored by left winger Edvard Thorsen from Boldklubben 1913, representing the selected Odense team, against the then-national team goalkeeper, Egon S√∏rensen.  Expansions and conversion to all-seater  Only minor changes was made to the original buildings at Odense Stadium between 1941 and the fall of 1996. The first significant change to the buildings were made in 1965 with the establishment of a lighting installation with a light intensity of 400 lux and a minor renovation to the grandstand. In the first couple of decades after the inauguration, there was a recurrent need to expand the capacity of the stadium to accommodate the increasing number of spectators to the football matches for Boldklubben 1909, Boldklubben 1913 and Odense Boldklub. During the 1950s and 1960s the three clubs played interchangeably in the highest and second highest Danish football leagues, drawing large crowds to the Odense derbies between each other, with all three clubs playing in the 1960 and 1968 Danish 1st Division respectively at the same time. During the summer break in 1959, an expansion of north-east stand was made to hold an additional 1,360 standing spectators, which was done by adding 17 new steps each 80 meters in length. The north-east stand would later become a covered stand with no seatings. In the 1990s, a decision was made by Odense Municipality to do an extensive renovation of the entire stadium at a total construction cost of DKK 60 million. The renovations, made in the years 1996‚Äì1997, consisted of expanding the stadium with four new seating grandstands that included a small number of standing areas in the corners. The last couple of renovations were not finished until 1998. It was considered among the most modern stadiums in Denmark after the renovation in the 1990s. In 2004, under-soil heating was installed on the football field together with other minor improvements, financed by Odense Municipality through the sale of condos and building-rights to Odense Boldklub A/S, at a construction cost of DKK 10 million. The following year, reconstruction of the VIP-facilities/sponsor lounge including expansion of the main grandstand were made by Odense Boldklub A/S, so that Odense stadium would be in full compliance with the requirements of UEFA to host international matches. The VIP building was designed by the Danish architect S√∏ren Vestergaard, one of the then two main shareholders of Torkild Kristensens Tegnestue A/S (TKT) and the investment of DKK 40 million was done by Odense Boldklub A/S. Unlike the rest of the stadium, that is owned by Odense Municipality and run by Odense Idr√¶tspark (a department of \\"By- og Kulturforvaltningen, Fritid og biblioteker\\" at the municipality), the VIP building was originally owned by Odense Boldklub A/S (OB), but the ownership was transferred to Odense Sport & Event A/S (OSE), when the limited company merged with Odense Congress Center A/S (OCC) on 1 May 2006, almost a year after the renovations was made. The yearly rental agreement by OCC, for the use of the stadium, gives the club the rights to use the stadium for 20 matches at a cost of DKK 2.1 million (2013) up from DKK 1,7 million in 2007, while more matches cost an additional DKK 101,000 per match, and includes the sale of advertisements, catering, stadium naming rights and priority access to their own matches being held on the stadium.  Records  The stadium's record attendance was recorded on 1 September 1963, when reportally 30,924 spectators watched the 1963 Danish 1st Division match between the 1962 season's runners-up Boldklubben 1913 and the reigning Danish champions Esbjerg fB. The game was won 3‚Äì2 by Esbjerg fB during which the youngest spectators had to be placed closest to the sidelines of the football field to make room for everybody. With Odense Boldklub as the home team, the local derby match against Boldklubben 1909 in the 1973 Danish 2nd Division drew 26,877 spectators, which became the record attendance number for an Odense Boldklub home match, while also becoming a record for a match in the second highest level in Denmark ‚Äì the game ended in a tie, 2-2. By finishing on top of the league in the first half of the 1961 Danish 1st Division, Boldklubben 1913 qualified to play in the 1961‚Äì62 European Cup, where the second round home match against Real Madrid CF on 18 October 1961 drew 27,584 spectators, which remains the largest crowd present at an international club match on Odense Stadium. Approximately 40,000 spectators were present at the opening ceremony of DGI's Landsst√¶vnet on 27 June 1985, the highest number in the history of Denmark's largest sports festival. The record attendance after the stadium's total renovation in 1997 is 15,486 spectators, which was recorded during the 2008‚Äì09 Danish Superliga season, when the home team Odense Boldklub played against FC Copenhagen on 13 May 2009, winning the match 3‚Äì2.  Name, sponsorships and logos  The VIP building (the Carlsberg stand) at the stadium shown here in 2014 during the TRE-FOR Park era, where the sponsored stadium logo was installed on the facade. The late Danish footballer and manager, Jack Johnson, referred to the stadium as Folkets Teater (en: \\"The People's Theater\\"), which is a nickname that has stuck with the stadium throughout the years. Being the largest stadium located in the largest city on the isle of Funen, Odense Stadium is unofficially referred to as Fyns national-stadion (en: \\"the national stadium of Funen\\"). As part of the rental agreement with Odense Idr√¶tspark of the home ground, Odense Boldklub (through Odense Sport & Event A/S) has the possibility to sell the naming rights of the stadium. The stadium changed its official name to Fionia Park (1 July 2005 ‚Äì 20 June 2010), when the naming rights were bought by the regional bank Fionia Bank A/S for a five-year period becoming only the second large stadium in Denmark to change its name by selling its naming rights to a sponsor. Afterwards TRE-FOR Park (1 July 2010 ‚Äì 22 October 2016) became the official name for the stadium, when the energy group TRE-FOR acquired the naming rights for the stadium as part of a five-year sponsorship deal, which was extended in February 2015 for an additional three years. Four years later a new name, EWII Park, was officially introduced on 23 October 2016 on the day that the Superliga match between Odense Boldklub and FC K√∏benhavn was played, because the stadium sponsor decided to change its own company name to EWII. On 7 June 2018, the stadium's current name was introduced as Nature Energy Park, when the energy company, Nature Energy, became the stadium sponsor. The rental agreement does not force other teams or events, such as the Denmark national football team or Boldklubben 1909, that rent the stadium for a single event or match, to use the sponsor name used by Odense Boldklub for their matches. The sponsor name for the stadium cannot be used when hosting FIFA and UEFA events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners. In UEFA national team and club matches, it is known under its original name Odense Stadium.

It dates back to the 13th century, and at is the largest medieval town square in Europe. The Project for Public Spaces (PPS) lists the square as the best public space in Europe due to its lively street life, and it was a major factor in the inclusion of Krak√≥w as one of the top off-the-beaten-path destinations in the world in 2016. The main square is a square space surrounded by historic townhouses (kamienice) and churches. The center of the square is dominated by the Cloth Hall (Sukiennice), rebuilt in 1555 in the Renaissance style, topped by a beautiful attic or Polish parapet decorated with carved masks. On one side of the cloth hall is the Town Hall Tower (Wie≈ºa ratuszowa), on the other the 11th century Church of St. Adalbert and 1898 Adam Mickiewicz Monument. Rising above the square are the Gothic towers of St. Mary's Basilica (Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç Mariacki). Krak√≥w Main Square does not have a town hall, because it has not survived to the present day.  History  Prussian Homage at the Main Square in Krak√≥w painted by Jan Matejko, now at the Sukiennice Museum The main function of the Market Square was commerce. After the city was destroyed by the Mongol invasion in 1241, the Main Square was rebuilt in 1257 and its commercial role expanded with the Magdeburg rights location of the city by the prince of Krak√≥w, Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste. The Main Square was designed in its current state with each side repeating a pattern of three, evenly spaced streets set at right angles to the square. The exception is Grodzka Street which is much older and connects the Main Square with the Wawel Castle. Originally the square was filled with low market stalls and administrative buildings and had a ring road running around it. It was King Casimir III the Great who built the original Gothic Cloth Hall and the town hall that filled nearly a quarter of the square. Krak√≥w was the capital of the Kingdom of Poland and a member of the Hanseatic League and the city flourished as an important European metropolis. Ko≈õciuszko taking the oath at the Rynek. 1797 painting by Franciszek Smuglewicz In addition to its original merchant functions the Main Square witnessed many historical events, and it was used to stage public executions of prisoners held in the city's Town Hall. It was a place of regal ceremonies as part of the Royal Road (Droga Kr√≥lewska), frequented by diplomats and dignitaries traveling to Wawel Castle. In 1364 King Casimir held the Pan-European Congress of Krak√≥w there. On 10 April 1525, Albert I, Duke of Prussia paid the Prussian Homage to Sigismund I the Old, king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, accepting Polish kings' suzerainty, (pictured). In 1514 Lithuanian duke Konstanty Ostrogski held a victory parade over the Muscovy and in 1531 nobleman Jan Tarnowski celebrated another victory in the Muscovite wars. Jan III Sobieski, a King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, celebrated there his victory over the Turkish Empire in the 1683 Battle of Vienna. In 1596 King Sigismund III, of the Swedish House of Vasa, moved the capital of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from Krak√≥w to Warszawa (Warsaw). Krak√≥w remained the place of coronations and royal funerals. On 24 March 1794, at the Main Square Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko announced the general uprising (pictured) and assumed the powers of the Commander in Chief of Polish armed forces, beginning the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising. In 1848, in the Spring of Nations, civilians clashed with the Austrian army and it was where, next to Ratusz, Austrian eagles were piled up as a symbol of regained independence in 1918. The market square in the 1930s Jews traded on the square as early as the 15th century. During the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany, the square was renamed Adolf Hitler-Platz and the Adam Mickiewicz monument was destroyed along with historical commemorative plaques taken from buildings at the square. After the war, the monument was reconstructed. In 1978 UNESCO placed the Main Square as part of the Old Town Krak√≥w on the list of World Heritage Sites. On 21 March 1980, in a time of political tension and the run- up to the declaration of Martial Law in Poland, Walenty Badylak, a retired baker and a veteran of Poland's wartime underground Home Army, set himself alight chained to a well in the Main Square. Badylak was protesting the communist government's refusal to acknowledge the Katyn war crime. Also, the Main Square was central in staging mass demonstrations of the Solidarity movement. In 2013 Lonely Planet travel guides rated Krak√≥w's Main Market Square as the most beautiful in the world.  Location  The Main Square (in red) Antoni Hawe≈Çka's Pod PalmƒÖ caf√© at Krzysztofory Palace The Main Square is located on the Royal Road once traversed during the Royal Coronations at Wawel Cathedral, between the Krak√≥w barbican to the north, and the Wawel Castle to the south. Ever since its creation the square has been considered the center of the city. The Main Square is surrounded by old brick buildings (kamienica) and palaces, almost all of them several centuries old. Most buildings have acquired a neoclassical look over time, but the basic structures are older and can be seen in their doorways, architectural details and interiors. Vast medieval cellars of the buildings are used as pubs, restaurants and cabarets. The square is lined with many restaurants and cafes. One of the most renowned, Pod PalmƒÖ (Under the Palm) at Krzysztofory Palace, was opened in 1876 by Antoni Hawe≈Çka, a purveyor to the imperial court in Vienna. It is the location of the Historical Museum of Krak√≥w, above. Among the many tourism-oriented venues there is also the International Centre of Culture. Probably the most famous of the oldest establishments is the Wierzynek's restaurant, remembered for the great feast of 1364 which, according to the legend, lasted for twenty one days and helped to reach a consensus between the monarchs of Europe. Among the square's landmarks is the cloth hall, which was originally designed in the 14th century as a center for cloth trade. It was gutted by fire in 1555 and rebuilt in the Renaissance style by Giovani il Mosca from Padua. The arcades were added in the 19th century. The ground floor is continually used for commerce with its many souvenir shops and caf√©s; upstairs houses the Gallery of the National Museum. Another landmark is St. Mary's Basilica with its Altar by Wit Stwosz, a Brick Gothic church built in the 14th century on the ruins of an earlier church destroyed by the Tartar raids of 1241. In the vicinity of the Market Square one can listen to the heynal, which is played each hour from the highest tower of St. Mary's Basilica. Other landmarks include the Church of St. Adalbert, Town Hall Tower and the Adam Mickiewicz Monument. Originally the market square consisted of more structures that were crucial to the economy and political life of the city and thus created a microcosm of the city. The Krak√≥w Town Hall existed since the medieval era and was destroyed in the 19th century. Also standing next to the Cloth Hall was the Great Weigh House and the Small Weigh House, which both existed until the 19th century. The foundations of the weigh houses were excavated in the early 21st century and incorporated into an underground museum. Since its creation, the level of the Market Square has raised, in some places by over . Underneath there are large basements, the most famous of which is the Piwnica pod Baranami. Many cellars are now transformed into pubs and restaurants; other include the Theater Maszkaron and a small archeological museum in the basement of the St. Adalbert's church. There are passages linking some of the basements, such as the one linking the Town Hall Tower with the Cloth Hall. The Hall itself has a little-known underground trading hall, 100 meters wide (328 ft) and 5 meters high (16.4 ft). Near Sienna Street there is another underground hall (Kramy Bogate), with of trading area.  Events  Main Market square, north frontage In December 2005 the Project for Public Spaces selected Krak√≥w's Rynek G≈Ç√≥wny as the World's Best Square. It is the focal point of many public events and festivities, such as the annual Krak√≥w szopka Festival, Lajkonik celebrations, Festival of Military Bands, Juwenalia Student Festival, Gala Concert of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity and the largest New Year's Eve party in Poland. Every year on Christmas Eve, the Adam Mickiewicz Monument (Mickiewicz' saint's name day) is decorated with flowers by the florists of Krak√≥w. The culture of Krak√≥w is deeply rooted in colorful traditions with the Main Square remaining most lively and crowded year-round. Like other notable old-town squares, Main Market Square in Krak√≥w is also known for its large population of rock pigeons, florist stalls, gift-shops, beer-gardens and horse-drawn carriages. Fiacres first appeared in the 1830s as rented carriages. Now, they offer tours around the Old Town and to the Wawel Royal Castle.

Between 1916 and 1918, he shot down 44 enemy planes‚Äî16 of them while flying one-handed. Berthold's perseverance, bravery, and willingness to return to combat while still wounded made him one of the most famous German pilots of World War I. Berthold joined the German Imperial Army in 1909, and paid for his own piloting lessons, qualifying in September 1913. He was one of the pioneer aviators of World War I, flying crucial reconnaissance missions during his nation's 1914 invasion of France. His reported observations affected the German troop dispositions at the First Battle of the Aisne. During 1915, he became one of the first flying aces. He rose to command one of the first dedicated fighter units in August 1916; he scored five victories before suffering severe injuries in a crash and being dosed with narcotics while hospitalized for four months. Decamping from hospital, he returned to duty while still unwell to successively command two of Germany's original fighter squadrons. By 24 April 1917, when he was wounded again, he had brought his tally to 12 and won Germany's greatest honor, the Pour le Merite. On 18 August, he once again bolted from medical care to return to battle. Over the next few weeks, he scored 16 more victories before being crippled by a British bullet on 10 October 1917. With an arm at hazard of amputation, Berthold was rescued by his sister Franziska, who had the medical connections to place him under the care of a specialist. Bedridden until February 1918, Berthold returned to duty to command one of the world's first fighter wings. On 28 May, he began once again to fly combat, though flying one-handed and under the influence of narcotics; he shot down 14 more enemy airplanes by 8 August 1918. On 10 August, he shot down his final two victims on his final flight before being downed himself. After two days in the hospital, he once again fled treatment and return to combat. Only a direct order from Kaiser Wilhelm II returned him to medical care for the rest of the war. In postwar Germany, Rudolf Berthold organized a Freikorps and fought the Bolsheviks in Latvia. He died of gunshot wounds during political street fighting in Hamburg on 15 March 1920. Early life and entry into military Oskar Gustav Rudolf Berthold was born on 24 March 1891, in Ditterswind, Kingdom of Bavaria in the German Empire. He was the sixth child of Oberf√∂rster (Head Forester) Oskar Berthold. The young child, familiarly known as Rudolf, was the first born to Helene Stief Berthold, Oskar's second wife. Oskar's first wife, Ida Anne Hoffmann Berthold, died in childbirth, leaving as survivors a daughter and three sons. Rudolf was followed by three younger brothers, two of whom survived to adulthood. Rudolf's father was employed by a local nobleman, Oskar Freiherr von Deuster; Rudolf grew up roving the baron's great estate. Early in September 1897, Rudolf began his education. By the time he had completed his studies at the Humanistische Neue Gymnasium (New Secondary School for the Humanities) in nearby Bamberg at age 14, he had adopted a personal motto from Horace: \\"It is sweet and fitting to die for one's Fatherland.\\" Rudolf moved to Schweinfurt's K√∂nigliches Humanistische Gymnasium (Royal Secondary School for Humanities) for sixth level classes. In late 1909, he transferred to the Altes Gymnasium (Old Secondary School) in Bamberg to better fit himself for military service. He graduated on 14 July 1910, with a reputation for being fearless, cheerful, and studious. Berthold's military career began when he joined the 3rd Brandenberg Infantry Regiment in Wittenberg. He served a year and a half's training as a F√§hnrich (Officer Candidate) before being accepted by its officers for commissioning as a leutnant. Der Fliegertruppe (The Flying Troop) became an official part of the German Imperial Army on 1 October 1912. Berthold learned to fly at his own expense in 1913, qualifying as a pilot in September. He trained at the Halberst√§dter Flugzeugwerke (Halberstadt Aircraft Factory) on dual-control Bristol types; one of his fellow students was Oswald Boelcke. After informing his family he had a \\"special assignment\\" to a flying school, Berthold underwent military flight training during July 1914. World War I=1914 The outbreak of World War I disrupted the young aviator's progress. On 1 July, Berthold was recalled from his schooling to rejoin his infantry regiment. After a fortnight's refresher course in soldierly skills, he was returned to flying training. On 17 July 1914, he was officially transferred out of the 3rd Brandenbergers to aerial service. His infantry refresher course had aborted his pilot training, and he had to settle for duty as an aerial observer. On 1 August, he entrained for the Royal Saxon Air Base at Grossenhain. By 7 August, Berthold was assigned to Feldflieger-Abteilung 23 (Field Flier Detachment 23, FFA 23), supporting the German 2nd Army. By 9 August, FFA 23 was encamped at Monschau near the Belgian border. On 15 August, Berthold was chosen for the unit's first reconnaissance mission. Two days later, his pilot strayed off-course; Bertholdt and his pilot landed, lost. They evaded French cavalry, to direct retrieval of their DFW biplane. In his diary, Berthold noted his decision to complete pilot's training. A First Class Iron Cross from 1914 Berthold was also the observer on flights on 1 and 3 September. He saw panicked French troops retreating across the Marne River. Later in the month, he discovered the French counter-thrust between the German 1st and 2nd Armies. German staff officers' disbelief led to Berthold personally briefing Generaloberst Karl von B√ºlow on the situation. B√ºlow moved his troops to higher ground; the First Battle of the Aisne began. General B√ºlow had received the initial Second Class Iron Cross for the 2nd Army; he personally awarded the second one to Berthold on 13 September. On 4 October, Berthold was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class by General B√ºlow. Again, Berthold received his award second only to B√ºlow. As November's winter weather limited combat flying, Berthold arranged to continue his pilot's training at a nearby flight park. He became friends with a fellow student, Hans Joachim Buddecke. 1915 Rudolf Berthold finally qualified as a military pilot on 18 January 1915. He arranged Buddecke's transfer into FFA 223. Berthold was assigned an observer, Leutnant Josef Gr√ºner, for flying reconnaissance sorties; they quickly became friends. In June, they were finally supplied with machine guns for their aircraft; Berthold could cease futile assaults on the enemy with his pistol. At about the same time, Berthold was laid up for a fortnight with dysentery. FFA 223 was re-equipped with AEG G.II bombers in August. The twin-engine giant was armed with two swiveling machine guns and manned by a pilot and two gunners. The unit also received its first single- seat fighter with a synchronized gun, a Fokker Eindekker. Berthold fought his first aerial combats in an AEG G.II bomber such as this. Berthold knew he could cross the lines searching for opponents in the AEG G.II, while the Eindekker was restricted to patrolling behind German lines. Berthold took command of the big bomber, and left the Eindekker to Buddecke. This decision sped Buddecke on his way to being a member of the first wave of German aces that included Oswald Boelcke, Max Immelmann, and Kurt Wintgens. Meanwhile, Berthold damaged his original G.II in a landing accident on 15 September, and had to return to piloting an old two-seater. Shortly thereafter, he returned to Germany to pick up a replacement G.II. By 1 October, he was using it as a gunship for air defense missions, as well as for bombing. On 6 November, one of those missions turned deadly; a British Vickers F.B.5 gunner mortally wounded Gr√ºner. Berthold was depressed by his friend's death, and sent on home leave. In early December, Buddecke was seconded to the Turkish Air Force and Berthold fell heir to his Eindekker. He accompanied Ernst Freiherr von Althaus when the latter shot down enemy planes on both 5 and 28 December 1915. 1916 As the Germans pioneered use of aircraft with synchronized guns, they began to group the new aerial weapons into ad hoc units to protect reconnaissance and bombing aircraft. These new units were dubbed Kampfseinsitzer Kommando (Single-seater fighter detachment). On 11 January, Kampfseinsitzer Kommando Vaux formed near FFA 223; Berthold was placed in charge. Even as the pioneering fighter units formed, on 14 January Royal Flying Corps (RFC) Headquarters directed that any reconnaissance craft crossing into German-held territory be escorted by at least three protective aircraft. On 2 February, Berthold and Althaus shot down a French Voisin LA apiece. It was Berthold's first aerial victory. He scored another three days later. Then, on 10 February, Berthold was himself downed, with a punctured fuel tank and a slightly wounded left hand. He was rewarded with one of the 12 Military Merit Orders awarded to aviators during the war. Berthold continued flying a bomber on missions as well as to patrol in his fighter. After he scored another victory, he was again honored by his native Kingdom of Bavaria, this time with the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Saint Henry on 15 April. On 25 April, Berthold made an emergency landing after enemy bullets crippled his Fokker's engine. He took off again in a Pfalz E.IV. He reawakened two days later in Kriegslazarett 7 (Military Hospital 7) in Saint Quentin. Besides a badly broken left leg, Berthold had suffered a broken nose and upper jaw, with attendant damage to his optic nerves. He was prescribed narcotic painkillers for chronic pain. At that time, German military doctors used three narcotics as remedies--opium, morphine, and codeine. Doctors prescribed cocaine to counteract the somnolence of these three depressant drugs. Berthold's exact prescription is unknown. Eventually, although Berthold's eyesight returned, he was unable to fly for four months, but nevertheless remained in command of KEK Vaux. Between the message traffic brought to him, and the accounts of his visiting subordinates, he learned of ongoing casualties. His brother Wolfram had been killed in action as an infantryman on 29 April. Max Immelmann perished in battle on 18 June. After Immelmann's death, Germany's highest scoring ace, Oswald Boelcke, was grounded for fear that his loss would be disastrous to morale. In the meantime, Berthold was scheduled to be evacuated back to Germany. Instead, in late July, he commandeered a car and returned to his unit. Unable to fly, he could still command. He made his orderly help him bend his knee and flex strength back into his withered leg. Blue Max on 12 October 1916. On 24 August, Berthold scored his sixth victory, although he had to be helped into his fighter. The next day, KEK Vaux became Jagdstaffel 4 (Fighter Squadron 4) under Berthold's command; the new unit started with a starred roster‚ÄîWilhelm Frankl, Walter H√∂hndorf, and Ernst Freiherr von Althaus were early members--all fated to become prominent aces. On 27 August, Berthold received the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. Berthold was very near attaining the Prussian Pour le Merite for eight victories. After disallowed claims on two occasions, on 26 September, Berthold was finally credited with his eighth victory. He received his Blue Max, considered Imperial Germany's supreme award for valor, on 12 October 1916. His was only the tenth award for aviators. Five of the other living recipients attended the 16 October celebration of the award, including Buddecke, Althaus, Frankl, H√∂hndorf, and Kurt Wintgens. The following day, Berthold's was assigned as Staffelf√ºhrer (Squadron Commander) of Jagdstaffel 14 (Fighter Squadron 14). Jagdstaffel 14 was newly formed when Berthold took command at Sarrebourg, France. Its motley assortment of fighters included two Fokker E.IIIs, a Halberstadt D.II, and seven Fokker D.IIs. It had had no success when it was still the ad hoc Fokker Kampstaffel Falkenhausen. Berthold took advantage of being in a quiet sector, and trained his troops hard. He brought in new Albatros D.I and Albatros D.II replacement fighter aircraft, and renovated the officers' mess. In mid-December, following the unit's first victory, they were inspected by Kaiser Wilhelm II and Crown Prince Wilhelm. 1917 In January Berthold and his squadron were subordinated to Armee- Abteilung A (Army Division A). Anticipating the future need for air protection, Berthold made an unheeded plea for amassing air power into larger units, and supported his proposal with detailed professional analysis. In February, Jagdstaffel 14 scored only two victories. However, it was slated to move to more active duty in Laon, and began to rearm with Albatros D.III fighters. Berthold flew to Laon to find there were no quarters for his men. He was adamant that he would not move his squadron until quarters were furnished. In mid-March, a convoy of trucks hauled the squadron to Marchais, France. They began operations on 17 March. Berthold had an Albatros D.III prepared as his assigned aircraft. Its guns were test-fired to check its synchronization gear. It was painted with his personal insignia of a white-winged sword of vengeance on either side of the fuselage. By September, his entire squadron had adopted his basic scheme of royal blue fuselages and scarlet cowlings, plus additional personal insignia. On 24 March, Berthold resumed his successful air assaults and was credited with four more victories by mid-April. On 24 April he engaged a French Caudron R.9 until driven back to base by a bullet through his right shin. This wound added more chronic pain to his misery, and caused him to convalesce at home from 23 May to 15 June. By now, his narcotics addiction was an open secret to his pilots. From reports, Berthold determined that his squadron's performance declined, and believed this was due to the lack of in- air leadership. In early August, he returned to his old training facility in Grossenhain and wrangled a medical clearance from its doctor. Berthold returned to his unit to await the paperwork, to discover that he was being transferred to command Jagdstaffel 18 (Fighter Squadron 18) in Harelbeke, Belgium, on 12 August. On 18 August, Berthold was finally certified to resume flying. Before Berthold's arrival, Jagdstaffel 18 had had little success; their new commander promptly emphasized training even as they flew combat missions. Shortly after assuming command, Berthold again pitched his idea of using fighters en masse; 4th Armee headquarters responded by grouping Jagdstaffelen 18, 24, 31, and 36 into the ad hoc Jagdgruppe 7 with Berthold in command. He shot down a SPAD on 21 August, raising his tally to 13. It was the beginning of a string of 16 aerial victories. During September he scored 14 more victories, bringing his tally to 27. On 2 October he scored his 28th victory, his final one of the year. Berthold's Fokker D.VII would have been painted with scarlet cowling and a royal blue fuselage bearing a winged sword emblem. During a dogfight on 10 October, a British bullet ricocheted within the cockpit of Berthold's aircraft and entered his arm at an angle that pulverized his right humerus. Berthold overcame the handicap of half-severed ailerons and remained conscious long enough to make a smooth one-handed landing at the Jagdstaffel 18 home airfield. He passed out after his safe arrival. His unconscious body was lifted from his Fokker and rushed to the field hospital in Courtrai. The Coutrai hospital lacked the facilities to heal such a complex injury; however, it sufficed to keep him alive. It was three weeks before the wounded ace was stable enough to be transferred. On 31 October, he was shipped back to Germany. His pilots alerted his elder sister, Franziska, who was a nursing supervisor in Viktoria-Lazarett (Victoria Hospital), Berlin. She arranged for her brother's diversion to the Berlin clinic of one of Germany's pre-eminent surgeons, Doctor August Bier, pioneer of cocaine usage in spinal anesthesia. Berthold entered the clinic on 2 November 1917. He was there for four months and Doctor Bier labored to save the mangled arm from amputation. Meantime, counter to Berthold's wishes, Oberleutnant Ernst Wilhelm Turck assumed Berthold's dual commands of Jagdstaffel 18 and Jagdgruppe 7. Berthold spent his convalescent leave learning to write with his left hand. He believed, \\"If I can write, I can fly.\\" Meantime, his right arm remained paralyzed as it slowly healed and he remained dependent on narcotics. 1918Return to duty= By February, Berthold could get out of bed. In mid-month, he volunteered to return to command of Jagdgruppe 7. On 1 March, he reported to the medical office of Flieger-Ersatz-Abteilung 5 (Replacement Detachment 5) in Hannover. He was returned to command of Jagstaffel 18, but denied permission to fly. On 6 March, with his arm in a sling, he rejoined his old squadron at its new duty station. Within two days, on 8 March, Berthold had arranged for Hans-Joachim Buddecke's transfer into the unit to lead it in the air. Two days later, Buddecke was killed in action. On 16 March, Rudolf Berthold was transferred to command Jagdgeschwader II (Fighter Wing 2) to replace Hauptmann Adolf Ritter von Tutschek, killed in action the previous day. The new wing had been copied from the pioneering Jagdgeschwader II; it was crucial to the German Spring Offensive that was to be launched on 21 March. Berthold was in a tenuous and stressful situation. He had suffered the loss of his best friend, left his familiar old squadron, was taking command of an unfamiliar and newly-formed larger unit, and was not on flight status. His solution to his dilemma was to take advantage of a loophole. Customarily, a Luftstreitkr√§fte commander being transferred swapped a small cadre of his unit into his new assignment. Berthold designated Jagdstaffel 15 (Fighter Squadron 15) the wing's Stab Staffel (command squadron). Then he effected a wholesale exchange of Jagdstaffel 18 people and aircraft into Jagdstaffel 15. In turn, Jagdstaffel 15 personnel and airplanes moved to Jagdstaffel 18, completing the trade. Berthold then departed for Buddecke's funeral in Berlin on 22 March. He returned to his new assignment two days into the new German offensive, to find that the infantry divisions his wing was supposed to support were complaining about their lack of air cover. Jagdgeschwader II's performance improved under its grounded commander's guidance, as the Germans advanced in eight days. The avidly awaited but disappointing Siemens-Schuckert D.III On 6 April, nine Siemens-Schuckert D.III fighters began to arrive. Despite high expectations for the craft because of its superior performance, it suffered engine failures after only seven to ten hours usage. The type was rapidly withdrawn from the wing. Meanwhile, Berthold had his men begin repainting the wing's aircraft with a common background marking. The wing's craft had standard dark blue paint applied to the fuselage, a la Jagdstaffel 15. However, instead of also copying a scarlet nose from them, the other squadrons each sported their own hue on the cowlings. Jagdstaffel 12 had white cowlings; Jagdstaffel 13 had dark green ones; Jagdstaffel 19 settled on yellow. To these markings, pilots added their own personal insignia. On the night of 12 April, French artillery directed by a reconnaissance aircraft began shelling the Jagdgeschwader 2 airfield. By the following morning the airfield and its equipment had been hit over 200 times by shellbursts. Though no one was killed, damage was such that the wing was essentially out of action for the next three weeks, as it changed airfields and re-equipped. In the meantime, Berthold fretted, He kept his sister apprised of his medical condition. On 25 April, he wrote, Franziska Berthold wrote of her brother, During this inactive stretch, Berthold outlined his intended use of the wing in a memorandum to headquarters. He outlined an air defense warning net posted forward to alert his wing, and he pleaded for a transport column to maintain the unit's mobility. Aside from this memo, he planned personnel changes in his new wing. He felt that the squadron commanders were plotting to have him replaced. By 18 May, the last of them had been replaced. The wing's score improved for that month, totaling 19 victories. =Return to aerial combat= Berthold had often flown a Pfalz D.III in preference to the Albatros D.V. In May 1918, the new Fokker D.VII entered service. Berthold borrowed one of the new machines from Jagdgeschwader 1 (Fighter Wing 1) for a surreptitious test flight. He liked its lightness on the controls, remarking hopefully that he could even fly it with his damaged right arm. On the morning of 28 May, he mounted a brand-new Fokker D.VII and for the first time, led his air wing into combat. Although it was a ground- support mission, he took the opportunity to score his 29th victory. The following day, he downed two more enemy aircraft, despite a malfunctioning gun synchronizer that nearly shot away his own propeller and caused a crash- landing. Berthold's drug addiction did not handicap him in the air. Georg von Hantelmann, one of his pilots, noted that despite his undiminished martial skills, his morphine addiction made him temperamentally erratic. Nevertheless, his subordinates remained loyal to him. Berthold's victory tally increased by half a dozen victories during June. Meantime, on 18 June, Berthold again advised his sister of his ongoing medical problems. He took a break until 28 June, when he scored his 37th victory. That night, he wrote his sister, His festering wound was not his only stressor. As summer's heat came on, the engines of the Fokker Triplanes of Jagdstaffel 12 began overheating, aggravated by the lack of genuine castor oil for lubrication. Occasionally, the lack of replacement Triplanes grounded the squadron, and hampered its sister squadron, Jagdstaffel 13. New Fokker D.VIIs arrived in the wing, but only sufficed to re-equip Jagdstaffel 15. By mid-June, the triplanes of Jagdstaffel 12 were deemed unserviceable. Jagdstaffel 19 had only partially rearmed with new Fokker D.VIIs. The understrength wing also suffered fuel shortages. To remain operational, fuel and lubricants were channeled to the most useful craft, the D.VIIs. On 19 June, Jagdstaffel 12 and Jagdstaffel 19 had no usable aircraft, and the wing was reduced to half strength or below. The bereft squadrons would slowly restock with D.VIIs after the triplanes were removed from the wing. Relief finally came on 28 June, when a shipment of 14 Fokker D.VIIs arrived and were divided between Jagdstaffel 12 and Jagdstaffel 19. Berthold fought on, scoring two more victories in July. However, now that he had re-equipped his fighter wing, influenza grounded all but three pilots from Jagdstaffel 19 by 6 July. Berthold scored three more victories in early August, raising his tally to 42. On 10 August, he led 12 of his pilots into battle against a vastly superior force of British aircraft. He shot down a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a fighter for his 43rd victory and an Airco DH.9 bomber for his 44th. When he tried to pull away from the DH.9 at altitude, his controls came loose in his hand. His attempt to use a parachute failed because it required the use of both hands. His Fokker crashed into a house in Ablaincourt with such force that its engine fell into the cellar. German infantrymen plucked him from the rubble and rushed him to hospital. His right arm was rebroken at its previous fracture. Rudolf Berthold would never fly again. On 12 August, Berthold once again checked himself out of a hospital. He arrived at the Jagdstaffel 15 officers' mess coincidentally with the newly appointed wing commander. Berthold stared down Rittmeister Heinz Freiherr von Brederlow, who was senior to him, and announced, \\"Here I am the boss.\\" Once Brederlow departed, Berthold took to bed, stating he would run the fighter wing from there. On the 14th, Kaiser Wilhelm II personally ordered the ace to take sick leave, and appointed Berthold's deputy commander, Leutnant Josef Veltjens, to take command of the wing. On 16 August, Berthold returned to Doctor Bier's clinic, being treated there through early October. Once his pains were alleviated, he went home to recuperate. The war ended while he was convalescing. Post-war In early 1919, Berthold was medically cleared to return to duty. On 24 February, he assumed the command of D√∂beritz Airfield in Berlin. He soon had the airfield functioning smoothly when it was shut down. Berthold then put out a call for volunteers to form a Freikorps militia to stave off communist insurrectionists. His renown attracted 1,200 men, mostly from his native Franconia. He founded the Fr√§nkische Bauern-Detachment Eiserne Schar Berthold (Franconian Farmer's Detachment: Iron Troop Berthold) in April 1919. They were trained by late May. His troopers were bound to him solely by personal loyalty. In August, Berthold's Freikorps moved to the Baltic states to fight Bolsheviks. In September, the Freikorps became part of the Iron Division in Lithuania. They engaged leftist forces in Latvia at Klaipƒóda and Riga, and fought on into a bitter winter. The last three weeks of 1919 were spent encamped on the German-Lithuanian border before their return to Germany. On 1 January 1920, Berthold and his troops entrained at Memel for Stade. They arrived with 800 men with 300 rifles and a handful of machine guns. They were scheduled to disarm on 15 March 1920. However, on 13 March, the military attempted the Kapp Putsch. Wolfgang Kapp and General Walther von L√ºttwitz called on all Freikorps and Reichswehr (Army) units to maintain public order. Chancellor Friedrich Ebert countered by calling a general strike. The Freikorps voted to join the putsch, so Berthold's men commandeered a train and crew from striking rail workers and moved to join the coup. Slowed by doused signals along the rail line, they got as far as Harburg, Hamburg on the evening of 14 March; there they bivouacked in Heimfelder Middle School. Commemorative plaque at the school Woellmerstrasse in Hamburg Heimfeld. Translation: On 15 March 1920 the school in the Woellmer street was the scene of the only armed conflict which occurred in the course of the Kapp Putsch of 13 March 1920 in the Hamburg area. The fight in Harburg was targeted against an armed Freicorps, which participated under the leadership of the rebel Rudolf Berthold in an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic in Berlin. A spontaneously formed alliance of members of the military population Harburg, Harburg pioneers and a large number of armed workers successfully turned against the rebels. During the course of the battle a total of 25 people died and more than 50 people were wounded, some seriously. The Independent Socialist government of Harburg anticipated the Freikorps imminent arrival by arresting the commander of local Pionier-Bataillon 9 (Pioneer Battalion 9), leaving its 900 trained soldiers leaderless. On the morning of 15 March 1920, trade union leaders tried to talk the pioneers into disarming the Freikorps, to no avail. Union workers were then armed to face the Freikorps, and converged on the middle school. Meanwhile, Burgomaster (Mayor) Heinrich Denicke offered safe passage out of town to the Freikorps if they would disarm. Berthold refused it. Past noon, when the workers had gathered, a machine gun fired over their heads to clear an exit passage out of the school. Instead of fleeing in panic, the union men shot back. In the ensuing firefight, 13 workers and three Freikorps combatants were killed. An additional eight Freikorps fighters were summarily executed after being captured. The school grounds were encircled. The Freikorps was besieged. By late afternoon, Freikorps ammunition was running low. Calling truce, Berthold negotiated a safe passage for those of his men who would disarm. At about 18:00 hours, the Freikorps filed out of the schoolhouse to disarm. A crowd of onlookers that had not been part of the negotiations were outraged by the civilian casualties, and they mobbed the Freikorps. There is a widespread myth that Rudolf Berthold was strangled with the ribbon of his Pour le Merite. The truth is more prosaic and more brutal. Berthold doubled back through the school when the mob attacked. As he exited the back door, someone spotted his Pour le Merite and yelled the alarm. A mob overpowered Berthold. His handgun was taken from him and used to shoot him twice in the head and four times in the body as the mob mauled him. Hans Wittmann, who retrieved Berthold's body, described it thus: Berthold's remains were taken to the Wandsbeke hospital, in a Hamburg suburb. Two of his old fliers who lived in Hamburg rushed to the hospital. They stayed with Berthold's body until Franziska arrived from Berlin. Berthold's Pour le Merite, Iron Cross First Class, and Pilot's Badge were retrieved from a garbage dump in Harburg before she arrived. Funeral and aftermath Rudolf Berthold was buried on 30 March 1920. Although pallbearers were customarily of the same rank as the deceased, his family requested that sergeants from his Freikorps do the honors. On Berthold's first gravestone, since destroyed, was allegedly the memorial: \\"Honored by his enemies, killed by his German brethren\\". However, a literal translation of the inscription is \\"slain in the brother fight for the freedom of the German lands\\". After receiving complaints about lynch law justice, the Stade police investigated Berthold's murder. In February 1921, two men were tried and acquitted of the killing. Legacy The new grave stone on the Invalids' Cemetery. When the Nazis rose to power, they exploited Berthold's name for propaganda purposes. They ignored his monarchist beliefs, and trumpeted his nationalist fervor. City streets were named for him in Bamberg and Wittenberg, among others. However, when the Nazis lost World War II, the streets lost the Berthold name. The Invalidenfriedhof lay near the dividing line between East Berlin and West Berlin. Tombstones were removed from many graves in 1960, including Berthold's, so that communist border guards preventing escapes from East Berlin had a better view of the boundary. Berthold's stone disappeared. However, after Germany's reunification, private donors raised the funds for a simple marker to be placed on his grave in 2003.

Early life and career Davis was born in Warner, New Hampshire. He lived in York, Pennsylvania from 1809 to 1833, where he gained a national reputation as a jeweler, watchmaker and clockmaker. With his partner Jonathan Jessop, Davis invested in an iron foundry in York. This facility constructed the Codorus, the first iron steamboat made in America. The Codorus, designed by John Elgar, was launched at present-day Accomac ( north of Wrights Ferry, now Wrightsville) on the Susquehanna River on November 22, 1825. Locomotive development On August 28, 1830, New York inventor Peter Cooper had publicly demonstrated his diminutive locomotive, later known as Tom Thumb. It successfully hauled at , and without a load reached speeds in excess of . The fledgling Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) was impressed with Cooper's early success, but instead of immediately offering him their business for locomotives, the company planned an open competition with a prize of $4,000. Five prototype locomotives were entered into the contest in early 1831, although Cooper did not participate. Phineas Davis's design, York, was chosen as the winner. It was a four-wheeled, vertical boiler locomotive that was somewhat similar to Cooper's design, but featured two vertical cylinders that drove vertical main rods. These in turn connected to horizontal side rods that powered the wheels. The first locomotive to burn coal, York was also the first with coupled wheels and a double instead of a single pair of drivers. It weighed and attained velocity by gearing, using a spur wheel and pinion on one of the axles of the wheels. Davis' upright \\"cheese boiler\\" consisted of a water jacket surrounding a central furnace, and a shallow drum suspended above the grates. The drum, when viewed through the fire door, was thought to resemble a cheese, thus giving the entire assembly its name. Baltimore & Ohio \\"Grasshopper\\" type locomotive, Atlantic In September 1831, Cooper proposed building six locomotives based upon his own design for the B&O.; The railroad agreed to his proposal, but when he failed to deliver on schedule, Cooper sold his patent to the B&O.; Davis soon incorporated some of Cooper's ideas into an improvement on his York design. Aided by Ross Winans, Davis in 1832 constructed a second locomotive that proved to be far more commercially successful than his first. This was the Atlantic, which employed Cooper's vertical firetube boiler. Built at a cost of $4,500, Atlantic weighed and had two vertical cylinders. Ox teams were used to convey the engine to Baltimore, where it made a successful inaugural trip to Ellicott's Mills, Maryland, a distance of thirteen miles. Nicknamed Grasshopper for its distinctive vertical pushrods, the locomotive carried 50 pounds of steam (3.45 bar) and burned a ton of anthracite coal on a trip from Baltimore. Davis's 0-4-0 design proved reasonably successful, and 20 such locomotives were constructed at the B&O;'s Mount Clare Shops. Some operated for more than 60 years, and were finally retired in the 1890s. One was prominently exhibited at the New York World's Fair in 1939. Death and legacy Phineas Davis was killed on September 27, 1835 while riding with his staff on B&O;'s recently completed Washington Branch. The Grasshopper derailed on the new line, due to defective track. Numerous urban legends have spawned from Davis' demise. Phineas Davis sightings were frequently reported in the regional media of the time period. The last recorded sighting was recorded in an evening edition of the Hanford Post-Gazette in October 1912. Phineas was reportedly spotted at a market buying several loaves of warm bread. Phineas' partner, Ross Winans, went on to develop several lines of locomotives incorporating both Davis' and Cooper's designs. Members of the Engineering Society of York sponsored a pair of memorials to Davis in 1924. An elementary school in York is named for the inventor. In 1949 a commemorative tablet was installed at the site of Davis's early shop at the northwest corner of King and Newberry streets in York.ExplorePAhistory.com (2011). \\"Phineas Davis Historical Marker.\\" References * * Wilde Genealogy \\"Phineas Davis.\\" Accessed 2013-09-22. * Files of the York County Heritage Trust, York, Pennsylvania.

It is considered to be the topmost medical faculty in the country which requires the highest qualification in GCE Advanced Level examination to be entered. History In 1839, the Governor of Ceylon J. A. Stewart Mackenzie started sending Ceylonese students to Calcutta for medical studies to the oldest medical school in South Asia - The Bengal Medical College. In the 1860s the Colonial Surgeon, Dr. James Loos was requested to report on the large depopulation of the Wanni. He recommended that medical facilities should be available throughout the island and to this end a medical school should be opened. The Colombo Medical School was thus opened in 1870 by the then Governor Sir Hercule Robinson. Dr James Loos was its first principal. Dr. E.L.Koch was the second principal in whose memory the Koch Memorial Clock Tower, which still stands, was built in 1881. The beginnings of the medical school were modest. It was situated in the General Hospital Colombo, and had three teachers and 25 students. It offered a course of three years duration until in 1873 the course was extended to four years. Its progress was rapid. In 1880 the medical school was raised to the status of a college (renamed Ceylon Medical College) and in 1884 the course was extended to 5 years. In 1875 Mudaliyar Samson Rajapakse gifted three and a half acres of land on which the present Faculty is located. Sir Charles Henry de Soysa, Mudaliyar Susew de Soysa, Muhandiram A.Simon Fernando Wijegooneratne and Mudaliyar Vimala Gunawardana donated the buildings. These buildings are no more and the Anatomy block, built in 1913, is the oldest building now. In 1887, the Diploma of Licentiate of Medicine and Surgery (LMS) granted by the College became registrable with the General Medical Council (GMC) of the United Kingdom. The Ceylon Medical College and the Ceylon University College, which had been established in 1921, formed the nucleus of the University of Ceylon, which came into being in 1942. The status of the Ceylon Medical College was elevated to the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Ceylon and the diploma of L.M.S. was replaced by the degree of MBBS Until it became the Faculty of Medicine, the Medical College was administered by the Civil Medical Department and its successor the Department of Medical and Sanitary Services. Dr. W.R. Kynsey served as Principal Civil Medical Officer (PCMO) between 1875 and 1897 and contributed much towards the college in its early years. Kynsey Road, which runs between the National Hospital and the Faculty, is named after him. In 1942 the Faculty of Medicine had six Departments - Physiology, Anatomy, Pathology, Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Surgery. Departments of Public Health (Community Medicine) and Forensic Medicine were added in 1949 and 1951 respectively. At present there are 14 Departments. The Departments of Biochemistry and Pharmacology branched off from the Department of Physiology, Parasitology and Microbiology from the Department of Pathology, and Paediatrics and Psychological Medicine from the Department of Medicine. There are 5 Units in addition to these departments - the Malaria Research Unit, the Human Genetics Unit, the Molecular Biology Unit, the Medical Education Development and Research Centre (MEDARC), and the Audio-Visual Unit. From 25 students in 1870, the student number increased to about 500 in the '60s and 1533 at present. The staff strength too has increased considerably.  Current Status  The Faculty at present provides for the education and training of undergraduates in allied health sciences. The course in Pharmacy is a well established one at the faculty while that for Physiotherapy is now three years old. In addition courses ranging from medico-legal sciences to those in medical education are regularly conducted. There is also a strong ethics review committee for processing of research projects and training of staff in ethical practices. These have provided for an innovative and vibrant academic environment within the faculty. In the future the faculty is gearing itself for the rapid changes in the health and medical educational needs of the country. It has taken the steps towards using advanced technologies by forward thinking. In doing so it is our (whose?) intention to establish and strengthen Inter departmental, inter faculty, inter ‚Äì university and international links. The Faculty has close links with several hospitals for teaching, training, clinical services and research.

The Brotherhood (as it is colloquially known) has its headquarters in Melbourne but provides services and programs across Australia. It undertakes research, delivers services and advocates for anyone who faces, or is at risk of, disadvantage and poverty. The Brotherhood pursues systemic change and finds new ways to address disadvantage so that people can fully participate in economic, social and civic life, and create and share prosperity with dignity and respect.  Programs and Services  The Brotherhood‚Äôs five-year strategy for 2019-2023 aims to directly build the capability of over 150,000 people who experience disadvantage, through community programs, disability and aged care services so that community members can find sustainable pathways out of poverty. The Strategy has five goals: # Economic security for all # Wellbeing, social inclusion, empowerment and dignity for all # Inclusive services and communities # A trusted voice nationally on poverty and disadvantage # An inclusive, effective, efficient and agile organisation The Brotherhood's broad portfolio of programs and services create lasting change in the community. Initiatives support disadvantaged people of all ages to build better lives for themselves. It develops innovative place-based services that are often then scaled up and adopted by other community organisations and local, state and federal governments. Programs and services focus on *children and families - in the early years, both at home and in school *young people - moving through secondary school and into work or further education *adults - seeking employment and training *older people - facing the challenges of retirement and ageing. *people living with disability Within this broad framework, the Brotherhood pays particular attention to issues relating to refugees and settlement, financial inclusion and social inclusion. History and beginnings It was founded on 8 December 1930 in the Anglican parish church of St Stephen in Adamstown, Newcastle in New South Wales. Its founder, Father Gerard Kennedy Tucker, dreamed of building a dedicated group of like-minded people who would serve the church and the community. The Brotherhood was established as a religious order of the Anglican Church, with members including priests and lay brothers. In 1933, the Brotherhood of St Laurence accepted the invitation of Canon Maynard of St Peter's Church, Eastern Hill, Melbourne (with the approval of the Archbishop of Melbourne) and moved to St Mary's Mission in Fitzroy to help people living in poverty in that neighbourhood. Young men who wished to serve others in the name of Christ came together as a community at St Mary's and attended lectures at St Peter's. They lived simply, studied, prayed and helped with social welfare activities. At the height of the Great Depression, when some 30% of the workforce was jobless, the Brotherhood became more actively involved in helping unemployed people and their families. After the 1939‚Äì45 War, there was little interest in expanding the Brotherhood as a religious order. However, the welfare work of the Brotherhood continued and expanded under Father Tucker's leadership. He believed that the role of the organisation was to provide a ‚Äòfence at the top of the cliff rather than ambulances at the bottom,‚Äô and he deployed a range of clever tactics to achieve social change including producing films, public campaigns, letters to newspapers and other advocacy. The Brotherhood‚Äôs tradition of exploring new ways to address disadvantage through innovation, research, partnerships and advocacy continues to this day. Research and policy The Brotherhood has a strong reputation for its research expertise and influence and its Research and Policy Centre (RPC) is the largest and oldest social policy research centre in a non-government welfare organisation in Australia. The team conducts timely research on the causes, consequences and measurement of poverty, inequality and socioeconomic disadvantage. The Brotherhood‚Äôs research standing is strengthened through a longstanding partnership with the University of Melbourne. They also house a library and collaborate with other researchers, government agencies and community organisations. Research areas include * inclusive education * work and economic security * inclusive ageing * energy, equity and climate change * housing and communities * poverty and social exclusion  National Disability Insurance Scheme Local Area Coordination  The Brotherhood provides Local Area Coordination in North East Metropolitan Melbourne, Hume Moreland, Bayside Peninsula, Western Melbourne and Brimbank Melton areas. This includes supporting people with disability to access community and mainstream services and resources and supporting people who meet the NDIS access requirements to navigate and engage effectively with the NDIS.  Social enterprises  The Brotherhood has 22 community stores (also known as op-shops) across greater Melbourne and Geelong where it sells donated furniture, clothing and other household items. As well as selling low-cost goods to families and bargain hunters, the organisation offers volunteer opportunities and a place for community connection. Among the Brotherhood's community stores, are three Hunter Gatherer shops specialise in selling hand-picked vintage clothing, accessories and bric-a-brac. Brotherhood Books is Australia's only online charity second-hand bookstore stocking a wide range of popular books, rare and collectable titles and children's books.  Staff and Volunteers  The Brotherhood employs 1400 staff and has 1200 volunteers across the organisation  Governance  The Brotherhood of St Laurence is incorporated under the Brotherhood of St Laurence (Incorporation) Act 1971, number 8188 of the Victorian Parliament, and is domiciled in Australia. The registered office is at 67 Brunswick Street, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065. The Brotherhood is an income tax-exempt charity, has deductible gift recipient status and is registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. Lady Southey AC is Patron of the Brotherhood. The President of the Brotherhood is the Most Revd Dr Philip L Freier, Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne and the Anglican Primate of Australia. The 13-member Board of Directors meets monthly.  Partnerships and Corporate support  The Brotherhood provides corporate volunteering and donation opportunities and has a range of partnerships with businesses including a major partnership with ANZ bank.

It was introduced by , in studying the rational points of modular curves. An Eisenstein prime is a prime in the support of the Eisenstein ideal (this has nothing to do with primes in the Eisenstein integers). Definition Let N be a rational prime, and define :J0(N) = J as the Jacobian variety of the modular curve :X0(N) = X. There are endomorphisms Tl of J for each prime number l not dividing N. These come from the Hecke operator, considered first as an algebraic correspondence on X, and from there as acting on divisor classes, which gives the action on J. There is also a Fricke involution w (and Atkin‚ÄìLehner involutions if N is composite). The Eisenstein ideal, in the (unital) subring of End(J) generated as a ring by the Tl, is generated as an ideal by the elements : Tl ‚àí l - 1 for all l not dividing N, and by :w + 1. Geometric definition Suppose that T* is the ring generated by the Hecke operators acting on all modular forms for Œì0(N) (not just the cusp forms). The ring T of Hecke operators on the cusp forms is a quotient of T*, so Spec(T) can be viewed as a subscheme of Spec(T*). Similarly Spec(T*) contains a line (called the Eisenstein line) isomorphic to Spec(Z) coming from the action of Hecke operators on the Eisenstein series. The Eisenstein ideal is the ideal defining the intersection of the Eisenstein line with Spec(T) in Spec(T*). Example *The Eisenstein ideal can also be defined for higher weight modular forms. Suppose that T is the full Hecke algebra generated by Hecke operators Tn acting on the 2-dimensional space of modular forms of level 1 and weight 12.This space is 2 dimensional, spanned by the Eigenforms given by the Eisenstein series E12 and the modular discriminant Œî. The map taking a Hecke operator Tn to its eigenvalues (œÉ11(n),œÑ(n)) gives a homomorphism from T into the ring Z√óZ (where œÑ is the Ramanujan tau function and œÉ11(n) is the sum of the 11th powers of the divisors of n). The image is the set of pairs (c,d) with c and d congruent mod 691 because of Ramanujan's congruence œÉ11(n) ‚â° œÑ(n) mod 691. The Hecke algebra of Hecke operators acting on the cusp form Œî is just isomorphic to Z. If we identify it with Z then the Eisenstein ideal is (691).

The praxis originates from the Lettrist technique of hypergraphics which was applied to architecture by the Lettrist International (LI). The UU critique of urbanism was further developed in the 1950s by the LI, and consists of a range of practices that include, but are not limited to: * The situation * The d√©rive (drift) * Psychogeography * D√©tournement * industrial painting * Revolution The critical practice continued to be developed by the Situationists and others. It was largely abandoned for the Debordian theory of the spectacle after the Second Situationist International and Situationist Antinational were formed. One of the few groups openly practicing unitary urbanism today is evoL PsychogeogrAphix in London. Unitary urbanism was announced as a very specific praxis at the Alba platform between the Lettrist International and the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus. In his Address to the Alba Conference in September 1956, the Lettrist International Delegate Gil J Wolman said: \\"A unitary urbanism‚Äîthe synthesis of art and technology that we call for‚Äîmust be constructed according to certain new values of life, values which now need to be distinguished and disseminated.\\" This mode of urban practice was also called for in a tract distributed during a demonstration by Lettrists in Turin, Italy in December 1956. Constant Nieuwenhuys and Guy Debord disagreed about the praxis: Nieuwenhus focused on structure, while Debord on content. Together, they issued the designation \\"the complex, ongoing activity which consciously recreates man's environment according to the most advanced conceptions in every domain\\". The disagreement led to Nieuwenhuy's split from the SI in 1960. Unitary urbanism, one of the major early Situationist concerns, stands on two tenets: * The rejection of the Euclidean, overly functional, urban architectural design, and * The rejection of the detachment of art from its surroundings. In the UU ideal, structural and artistic elements of humanity's metropolitan surroundings are blended into such grey area that one cannot identify where function ends and play begins. The resulting society, while it caters to fundamental needs, does so in an atmosphere of continual exploration, leisure, and stimulating ambience.

Located in the South Durban basin and roughly bordered by the Umhlatuzana River in the North and Umlaas River in the south, the township is undergoing a rapid integration of blacks and Indians. History In the 1940s, the Pegging Acts and the Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act, 1946 were passed. These acts gave the government the right to remove and destroy shacks and small self-made shelters, with the putative intention of improving sanitary conditions. This led to the Group Areas Act of June 1950 being enforced directly by the Government, in which certain residential areas were designated for Whites, Indians, Coloureds, and Africans only. Indians were removed from areas such as Mayville, Cato Manor, Clairwood, Magazine Barracks, Bluff, Riverside, Prospect Hall, Duikerfontein, and Sea Cow Lake. They were forcibly moved into the two townships of Phoenix, which are situated North of Durban, and Chatsworth in the South. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, there were advertisements in papers for an exclusively Indian town, Umhlatuzana. This progressed into the greater Chatsworth District in the early 1960s when planning commenced and official movements took place in 1964 to the eleven units: Unit 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and Unit 11. Modern day Chatsworth is spread over seven municipal wards which all fall roughly in the South Central municipal area. The intentional buffer design of Chatsworth creates today an interesting melting pot of people frequenting Chatsworth's business district which comprises a bustling center, The Chatsworth Center.

As a result of resistance, the Indian population has excelled academically and have produced many academics who are former inhabitants of Chatsworth. Most secondary schools in Chatsworth boast pass rates above 90 per cent for the Matric Examinations despite lacking resources and facilities.

This saw the construction of the entire town from the ground up. Major infrastructure includes all the roads, and railways. The M1 Hans Dettman Highway runs through the town from Mobeni in the East to Mariannhill in the West. It serves as the artery of Chatsworth linking all 11 Units and surrounding areas. Alongside the highway is a railroad operated by PRASA, linking some units of Chatsworth directly to Isipingo, Durban South and the greater Durban CBD. The most recent private development is the construction of the Ridge Shopping mall, in Shallcross.  Nelson Mandela Community Youth Centre  The development of the Chatsworth Youth Center was initialized by former president, Nelson Mandela, following the death of several teenagers at the Throb Nightclub. It serves as a multi purpose facility for youth to engage on societal issues. Current situation Indian people in Chatsworth are from various religious groups. Many masjids, temples, and churches are present. One of many famous masjids is Habibia Manzil in Shallcross. As a consequence of its history, Chatsworth still has a predominantly Indian population. It is a center of Indian culture, and holds the Temple of Understanding‚Äîa Hindu temple. Many Indians from Hindi, Tamil and Telugu backgrounds are present. Such Indian languages are still spoken at home in many instances, with learning classes set up to aid in their development.

A graduate of the Athenian club's youth system, Giannou was loaned to Olympiakos Volou in summer 2000 until the end of the year, and spent the rest the campaign at Halkidona FC. Promoted to the senior Olympiacos squad on his return, he made his top-flight debut on 4 January 2002, but was mainly a reserve. However, although by the start of 2003/04 he was still fourth-choice, a combination of Theofanis Katergiannakis's injury, Dimitrios Eleftheropoulos's departure and Juraj Bucek's loss of form saw Giannou promoted to play in the final 12 games of the league season. Olympiacos, however, were pipped to the title by Panathinaikos FC. The arrival of Antonios Nikopolidis from Panathinaikos relegated Giannou back to the bench. He played in just one league match, when Nikopolidis was suspended, and three Greek Cup encounters as his club completed the domestic double. In 2005/06, understudy to Nikopolidis, he played in one league encounter and made his UEFA Champions League debut against Olympique Lyonnais. He won approximately ‚Ç¨1m in the Greek national lottery in 2002. On 29 August 2007 Olympiacos decided to release Giannou from his contract after he refused to be loaned out again.

Mountaineer In 1988, Venables became the first Briton to ascend the summit of Mount Everest without bottled oxygen. His ascent, as far as the South Col, was by a new route up the Kangshung Face from Tibet, with just three other climbers, Americans Robert Anderson and Ed Webster, and Canadian Paul Teare. All four reached the South Col but Teare decided to descend from here, concerned about incipient altitude sickness. The other three continued up the final section of the normal 1953 route, but Anderson and Webster were forced to turn back at the South Summit. Meanwhile, Venables reached the summit alone, at 3.40 pm. Descending late in the day, he decided to bivouac in the open at about 8,600 metres, rather than risk a fall by continuing in the dark. Anderson and Webster spent the night slightly lower in an abandoned Japanese tent. In the morning all three were reunited and continued down to their own tents on the South Col. It took them a further three days to complete an epic retreat down the Kangshung Face. All three climbers suffered some frostbite, with Webster affected worst. Venables's other Himalayan first ascents include new routes in the Hindu Kush (1977), Kishtwar Shivling (1983), Solu Tower (1987), the south-west ridge of Kusum Kanguru (1991) and Panch Chuli V (1992). During the descent from Panch Chuli V Venables broke both his legs in a fall, when an abseil anchor failed; thanks to his Indian and British teammates and the Indian Air Force, he was rescued. This expedition was recorded in his book A Slender Thread and in Victor Saunders's No Place to Fall. He has also made first ascents in Peru, Bolivia, Patagonia and South Georgia. He has appeared in several BBC television documentaries and the IMAX film Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure. He is currently president of the South Georgia Association and is a past President of the Alpine Club. Personal life Venables is the father of the only known child in the UK to be diagnosed with both autism and leukaemia. His son, Ollie (born June 1991), was diagnosed with autism aged two and leukaemia aged four. After several cancer-free years, he developed a brain tumour and died, aged twelve years old.

It is required to have several properties which assist in the formulation of the large deviation principle. In some sense, the large deviation principle is an analogue of weak convergence of probability measures, but one which takes account of how well the rare events behave. A rate function is also called a Cram√©r function, after the Swedish probabilist Harald Cram√©r. Definitions Rate function An extended real-valued function I : X ‚Üí [0, +‚àû] defined on a Hausdorff topological space X is said to be a rate function if it is not identically +‚àû and is lower semi-continuous, i.e. all the sub-level sets :{ x \\\\in X \\\\mid I(x) \\\\leq c } \\\\mbox{ for } c \\\\geq 0 are closed in X. If, furthermore, they are compact, then I is said to be a good rate function. A family of probability measures (ŒºŒ¥)Œ¥ > 0 on X is said to satisfy the large deviation principle with rate function I : X ‚Üí [0, +‚àû) (and rate 1 ‚ÅÑ Œ¥) if, for every closed set F ‚äÜ X and every open set G ‚äÜ X, :\\\\limsup_{\\\\delta \\\\downarrow 0} \\\\delta \\\\log \\\\mu_{\\\\delta} (F) \\\\leq - \\\\inf_{x \\\\in F} I(x), \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(U)} :\\\\liminf_{\\\\delta \\\\downarrow 0} \\\\delta \\\\log \\\\mu_{\\\\delta} (G) \\\\geq - \\\\inf_{x \\\\in G} I(x). \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(L)} If the upper bound (U) holds only for compact (instead of closed) sets F, then (ŒºŒ¥)Œ¥>0 is said to satisfy the weak large deviations principle (with rate 1 ‚ÅÑ Œ¥ and weak rate function I). Remarks The role of the open and closed sets in the large deviation principle is similar to their role in the weak convergence of probability measures: recall that (ŒºŒ¥)Œ¥ > 0 is said to converge weakly to Œº if, for every closed set F ‚äÜ X and every open set G ‚äÜ X, :\\\\limsup_{\\\\delta \\\\downarrow 0} \\\\mu_\\\\delta (F) \\\\leq \\\\mu(F), :\\\\liminf_{\\\\delta \\\\downarrow 0} \\\\mu_\\\\delta (G) \\\\geq \\\\mu(G). There is some variation in the nomenclature used in the literature: for example, den Hollander (2000) uses simply \\"rate function\\" where this article -- following Dembo & Zeitouni (1998) -- uses \\"good rate function\\", and \\"weak rate function\\". Regardless of the nomenclature used for rate functions, examination of whether the upper bound inequality (U) is supposed to hold for closed or compact sets tells one whether the large deviation principle in use is strong or weak. Properties=Uniqueness A natural question to ask, given the somewhat abstract setting of the general framework above, is whether the rate function is unique. This turns out to be the case: given a sequence of probability measures (ŒºŒ¥)Œ¥>0 on X satisfying the large deviation principle for two rate functions I and J, it follows that I(x) = J(x) for all x ‚àà X. Exponential tightness It is possible to convert a weak large deviation principle into a strong one if the measures converge sufficiently quickly. If the upper bound holds for compact sets F and the sequence of measures (ŒºŒ¥)Œ¥>0 is exponentially tight, then the upper bound also holds for closed sets F. In other words, exponential tightness enables one to convert a weak large deviation principle into a strong one. Continuity Na√Øvely, one might try to replace the two inequalities (U) and (L) by the single requirement that, for all Borel sets S ‚äÜ X, :\\\\lim_{\\\\delta \\\\downarrow 0} \\\\delta \\\\log \\\\mu_{\\\\delta} (S) = - \\\\inf_{x \\\\in S} I(x). \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(E)} The equality (E) is far too restrictive, since many interesting examples satisfy (U) and (L) but not (E). For example, the measure ŒºŒ¥ might be non-atomic for all Œ¥, so the equality (E) could hold for S = {x} only if I were identically +‚àû, which is not permitted in the definition. However, the inequalities (U) and (L) do imply the equality (E) for so-called I-continuous sets S ‚äÜ X, those for which :I \\\\big( \\\\stackrel{\\\\circ}{S} \\\\big) = I \\\\big( \\\\bar{S} \\\\big), where \\\\stackrel{\\\\circ}{S} and \\\\bar{S} denote the interior and closure of S in X respectively. In many examples, many sets/events of interest are I-continuous. For example, if I is a continuous function, then all sets S such that :S \\\\subseteq \\\\bar{\\\\stackrel{\\\\circ}{S}} are I-continuous; all open sets, for example, satisfy this containment. Transformation of large deviation principles Given a large deviation principle on one space, it is often of interest to be able to construct a large deviation principle on another space. There are several results in this area: * the contraction principle tells one how a large deviation principle on one space \\"pushes forward\\" (via the pushforward of a probability measure) to a large deviation principle on another space via a continuous function; * the Dawson-G√§rtner theorem tells one how a sequence of large deviation principles on a sequence of spaces passes to the projective limit. * the tilted large deviation principle gives a large deviation principle for integrals of exponential functionals. * exponentially equivalent measures have the same large deviation principles. History and basic development The notion of a rate function emerged in the 1930s with the Swedish mathematician Harald Cram√©r's study of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables (Zi)i‚àà‚Ñï. Namely, among some considerations of scaling, Cram√©r studied the behavior of the distribution of the average X_n=\\\\frac 1 n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i as n‚Üí‚àû. He found that the tails of the distribution of Xn decay exponentially as e‚àínŒª(x) where the factor Œª(x) in the exponent is the Legendre‚ÄìFenchel transform (a.k.a. the convex conjugate) of the cumulant- generating function \\\\Psi_Z(t)=\\\\log \\\\operatorname E e^{tZ}. For this reason this particular function Œª(x) is sometimes called the Cram√©r function. The rate function defined above in this article is a broad generalization of this notion of Cram√©r's, defined more abstractly on a probability space, rather than the state space of a random variable.

It is 3,350 metres (11,000 ft) from its base on the Kangshung Glacier to the summit.Mount Everest, 1:50,000 map, 1:25,000 map, and route guide. Prepared under the direction of Bradford Washburn for the National Geographic Society, the Boston Museum of Science, and the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, 1991. It is a broad face, topped on the right (when seen from below) by the upper Northeast Ridge, and on the left by the Southeast Ridge and the South Col. Most of the upper part of the face is composed of hanging glaciers, while the lower part consists of steep rock buttresses with couloirs between them. It is considered to be a dangerous route of ascent, compared to the standard North Col and South Col routes, and it is the most remote face of the mountain, with a longer approach. History The eastern side of the mountain was relatively unknown to the outside world until the 20th century, owing to the complex and isolated terrain and climate of Tibet, and Buddhist reverence for the mountains prohibiting their ascent. In 1921, George Mallory and Guy Bullock were the first Westerners to witness and survey the Kangshung Face, as a part of the initial 1921 British reconnaissance expedition which had gained permission for the first-time ever from the Dalai Lama of Tibet to attempt ascents of Everest. Mallory and Bullock were led by local yak herders to the east side the mountain, passing through the high Langma La and the rhododendron forests of Kama Chu. At that time of the year in August, there were meadows of flowers and rich vegetation in the valleys and beside the Kangshung Glacier. In 1980, a young American climber, Andy Harvard, undertook a modern reconnaissance of the East Face. Today, there are numerous trekking companies that guide clients to the Kangshung Glacier where they can view Everest. It takes six or seven days to reach the Kangshung Glacier from the nearest road at Yeuba (near Kharta.) Climbing history Various climbing routes A 1981 American attempt led by Richard Blum and Louis Reichardt, including Edmund Hillary, George Lowe, John Roskelley, David Breashears, and Kim Momb made progress on the steep rock buttresses, but aborted at around 7000 meters due to high avalanche danger. The first successful ascent of the Kangshung Face was made in 1983 by an American expedition led by James D. Morrissey. After five and a half weeks of effort, Kim Momb, Carlos Buhler, and Louis Reichardt summited on 8 October 1983. George Lowe, Dan Reid and Jay Cassell summited the next day. In 1988, an American/British expedition climbed a new route up the South Buttress on the face to reach the South Col, with a finish to the summit via the standard Southeast Ridge. Stephen Venables, became the first Briton to summit without the use of bottled oxygen. Ed Webster (USA) and Robert Anderson (USA) made it to the South Summit but did not reach the summit. Paul Teare (Canada) made it to the South Col, but descended because he was feeling unwell. In support were: Miriam Zieman (USA), doctor; Joseph Blackburn (USA), photographer; Pasang Norbu (Nepal), cook and Kasang Tsering (Tibet), cookboy. In 1992 a Chilean expedition successfully climbed this route being the second expedition to do it. The climbers who reached the summit were Rodrigo Jordan, Cristian Garcia-Huidobro and Juan Sebastian Montes. Kangshung face is where Lincoln Hall was found alive after he was left for dead on his 2006 expedition to summit Mount Everest. Ascending the Kangshung Face To the right is the top of the east Kangshung face. To the left is the top of the South-West face and the Hillary Step in between along the ridge-line To climb the face, the 3 kilometer (2 mi) wide base of the wall must be surpassed by climbing up either the deep gashes of avalanche-swept gullies or the vertical, overhanging rock buttresses, full of deadly ice towers and unsteady snow. Since the crux of the route is near the bottom, retreat is more difficult, making the climb more committing; the relative isolation of the face and probable lack of other climbers also add to the commitment factor. The hanging glaciers and snow slopes pose a large risk of avalanches, especially in the case of a storm, adding to the objective danger of the route. Taking into account these challenges, George Mallory noted in his expedition book: \\"Other men, less wise, might attempt this way if they would, but, emphatically, it was not for us.\\"Stephen Venables, Everest: Alone at the Summit, p. 8.

Plot Based on a children's book written by ≈Ωivko ƒåingo in the 1970s, the movie is about the difficult transition in Macedonia after World War II. The film begins in the present as old Lem (Meto Jovanovski), Macedonian politician who is experiencing a heart attack and while he is being wheeled into a hospital and examined and wired, he has memory flashbacks to his childhood in 1945. He is brought to the 'orphanage' where orphans are children of the enemies of the new regime. There he learns how to adjust to the role of obedient brainwashing. He becomes mesmerized by a new kid, Isak, a beautiful and charismatic boy. The struggles quietly underplaying all of the camp surface activity are many: the dichotomy of a Communist ideology removing the Church from existence with a people dependent upon the spiritual values of religion, the Stalin/Tito issue, the adjustments to the policies of Communist regime in a country where fierce national pride had ruled, and the depersonalization of children into political pawns despite the need for role models and the luxury of growing up with friends and confidants.

According to her contemporary George Templeton Strong, Miller was active in New York City prostitution from the late 1810s. By 1821, she was running a brothel on Church Street, where she had accumulated personal effects worth at least $500. Over Miller's 30-year career, she became quite wealthy. At one point or another, Miller ran houses on Duane, Elm, Orange and Reade streets. She owned, but did not manage, another brothel on Cross Street. Rumors suggested that, in the 1840s, she charged her girls $14 a week to stay in her brothels. By 1855, she had many personal residences; the one on Church Street alone contained effects valued at $5,000. Miller was a celebrity as well. Her name appeared in tourist guidebooks and in the diaries of rich New Yorkers. The Libertine opined that she and Phoebe Doty, another madam, should rent New York's Park Theatre and talk about their exploits. The paper predicted that \\"the house would be crammed if the entrance was five dollars a head. The bigger the harlot now-a-days the more money is made.\\" By the 1840s, the aging Miller had become the subject of negative press, particularly from the Whip.

Early life  Dinerchtein started playing go in 1986, when he was just 6 years old. He was born and raised in Kazan, Russia where he grew up around strong Russian Go players, such as Ivan Detkov and Valeryi Solovyev. He first learned Go from his father. He was both a chess and Go player, but by the age of 10 he stopped playing chess and went deeper into Go with his new teacher Valery Shikshin.  Move to Korea  In 1996, ten years after he started learning Go, he was invited by Cheon Poong-jo of the Hanguk Kiwon to study Go in Seoul. Dinerchtein moved to Korea in 1997 and started to live in one of the biggest Go schools. He studied Go with several young Korean players that have since risen to fame, including Pak Yeong-hun --whom he beat once in 1998--, Park Chi-eun, Lee Chang-ung and Ko Geuntae.  Becoming professional  In 2002 Alexandre made history by becoming the first Russian Go player to be promoted to professional status, alongside Svetlana Shikshina. Both players were promoted by special recommendation, a feat achieved by very few non-Asian players. He has since started a career in teaching Go to western players.

Myrtle Square Mall was the first enclosed shopping mall in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States, located in the heart of the city. It bordered the Myrtle Beach Convention Center, Kings Highway, Oak Street, and it was in very close proximity to residential neighborhoods and many oceanfront hotels. Its size, for the time, was quite large with a total area around set on of land. The parking lot contained more than 2,800 spaces. Former Anchors *Belk *Sears *Peebles *Collins Department Store (later Peebles)  Design and construction  Beginning in the early 1970s, Myrtle Beach Farms Company, owner of the mall and many buildings around the Myrtle Beach area, had considered building a mall in the area. A study taken by Wilbur Smith and Associates that indicated that a shopping center was needed for the Myrtle Beach area. These results greatly added to the decision to create the Myrtle Square Mall. The mall was designed by Nelson Benzing Design Associates. Construction of the mall began in December 1973. Besides being recognized as the first mall in the area, the mall was to be home to the reportedly world's largest clock. The clock was the mall's focal point and was the subject of many photographs from residents and tourists alike. The clock was the idea of Ezra Whittner, a member of Nelson Benzing Design Associates, based in Raleigh. The idea was different due to the beach area's unique expectations for the mall. Initially, the mall's design was based around a beach theme with waves, sand, and dunes. Since this was commonplace, a new concept was devised by Whittner with the idea of a large clock. According to a Sun News article written in April 1975, the mall was \\"expected to change the shopping habits of local residents and tourists.\\" The article went on to state that the residents of the Strand will not have to travel to Charleston, Columbia, Florence, or Wilmington. Estimates put that the mall would make $20 million in its first year. This money, which would have normally been spent in other locations, would stay in Myrtle Beach. The new mall in Myrtle Beach was not without criticism, however. There was concern that merchants from Conway, North Myrtle Beach, Georgetown, and downtown Myrtle Beach might suffer from the cut of volume that would go to the new mall.  Early operation  The mall opened to the public on April 16, 1975 with full news coverage from The Sun News. The mall's leasing manager was the Caine Company, based out of Greenville, South Carolina. It was hailed as \\"one of the largest and most modern shopping facilities in the Southeast\\" for its time with an architectural style that was quite noticeable throughout the mall. The opening began with 30 diversified retail outlets. Some of the major tenants included Belk, Collins Department Store (later to be Peebles), Eckerd Drugs, and Morrison's Cafeteria. Initially, many of the stores in the mall were local stores instead of national chains that can be commonly found in many malls. In addition to those mentioned above, the first stores that opened with the mall included Paperback Booksmith, Playhouse Toys, Record Bar, Coker's, Candlewood, Singer's, Suzanne's, Baskin-Robbins, Bottoms Up, Curious Cargo Gifts, Kinney Shoes, Magic Cavern, Der Dog Haus, Friedman's, Gingham Peddler, Lowery Organs, Lynn's, Hallmark, Hickory Farms, Karmelkorn, La Marick, Leaf 'n Match, Merle Norman, Nelson's Men's Shop, Endicott-Johnson, and Orange Bowl. Most of these stores changed within the time span of Myrtle Square's thirty-year history, although some remained loyal and remained in the same location. In 1976, the first Chick-Fil-A in the Myrtle Beach area was opened in the mall by John Shaw, a sales manager from Greer SC. At the time, there were less than 50 of these restaurants nationwide, all in shopping malls. John served as the president of the Myrtle Square Merchants Association for most of his time there. In order to open the mall more rapidly, half of the mall was delayed in opening until the next year as a \\"Phase II\\". Many new stores, including Sears, opened that year. It included a mail-ordering delivery destination for many of Myrtle Beach's residents when they ordered from the Sears catalog. Myrtle Beach's first attempt at an enclosed mall had been a success. In addition, several outparcels were built around the mall. Big Star Supermarket opened on the southwest area of the complex, as well as Citizens Bank.  Renovation  Over ten years had passed before any updates to the mall would take place. In those ten years, Myrtle Beach had grown extensively, and Briarcliffe Mall had opened in the Briarcliffe Acres area. To compete with shopping in the area, Myrtle Square Mall underwent a renovation. In the spring of 1985, Burroughs and Chapin began a renovation process that would take two months, beginning in February and ending in April. Some of the changes made included four additional kiosks. New stores appeared, including P-Nut Shak, Incredible Chocolate Chip Cookie Company, Things Remembered, and Nautical but Nice. In addition, all trees were replaced, and new flooring was installed. Several stores also received extensive renovations. The large clock remained in the mall following the renovations. It, too, was updated. According to Burroughs and Chapin officials, the clock had received a large amount of use and attention that was not originally planned. Burroughs and Chapin also updated the original clock design to better accommodate shoppers.  Later operation  The later 1980s and 1990s became a quiet time for Myrtle Square Mall. What was once the Coker's Department Store became the Carousel Court area by 1991. Carousel Court included a carousel area and an entertainment area. A food court was also added, replacing a landscaped entrance court located next to Sears. The food court won an International Council of Shopping Centers award in 1988 soon after it opened.  Coastal Grand Mall  Burroughs and Chapin began planning a new mall in the Myrtle Beach area named Mall of South Carolina, later to be changed to Coastal Grand Mall. This mall was going to be located at the intersection of US 17 and US 501 north of Myrtle Beach International Airport. Construction work began in 2003 and the mall opened in March 2004.  Closure  To some, the opening of Coastal Grand Mall meant the beginning of the end. To others, it meant that Myrtle Beach would start to come into the 21st century. The mall had not been updated for about twenty years, leaving the mall in a minor condition of disrepair. Since the mall was owned by the same owner as the new mall, Burroughs and Chapin had the power to close Myrtle Square, which would eventually happen. Most of the stores in Myrtle Square moved to the new mall in early 2004, so the mall became mostly vacant within a few weeks. Coastal Carolina University had several of its offices in Myrtle Square, as well as the Republican Party headquarters for Horry County. Additionally, during the mall's last year in operation, the Carousel Court area served as the temporary offices for the Department of Motor Vehicles while that agency's offices underwent renovation.Department of Motor Vehicles moves to mall, Phil Watson, The Sun News, August 20, 2004 Peebles also remained inside of the mall until Labor Day of 2005. It had a liquidation sale before the store closed. The other tenants remaining also closed up shop shortly after, and the mall sat vacant for three months.  Demolition  Demolition began with the removal of the blue tiles on the exterior of the former Belk building. On December 22, 2005, a request for the demolition had been filed with the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management and was subject to public comment until January 2, 2006. The work required a stormwater permit in which Burroughs and Chapin showed that debris from the demolition would not enter any waterways via stormwater. The demolition of the mall was completed by Vereen Construction Company. A second demolition permit filed in the city of Myrtle Beach was approved on December 30, 2005. The Charleston-based company LS3P was charged with coming up with a plan on what to do with the property after the building had been demolished. City water lines and power lines were disconnected soon thereafter, and structural demolition began. An uprooted tree outside of the former Sears building at Myrtle Square Mall in January 2006. As of January 2006, almost all of the former Sears building had been demolished, as well as some of Phase II and the northern stores. Demolition had halted at about the center of the mall until mid-2006; the mall has since been demolished fully. Until a plan has been determined for future use of the property, the land will remain vacant.

Early life and education Chang was born in Taiwan and moved to the United States as a young child. She was raised in Salt Lake City, Utah and received an MD from the University of Utah College of Medicine. Chang trained in neuropathology at Stanford University under the noted clinical neuropathologist, Dikran Horoupian, publishing studies on eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. During this period she contributed to studies led by her friend, Julie Parsonnet, showing that Helicobacter pylori is a cause for gastric cancer.  Career  Chang moved to Columbia University to pursue her first academic appointment as a clinician-scientist. Although initially interested in using representational difference analysis to study the genetic origins of brain tumors, she applied this technique to Kaposi's sarcoma resulting in the discovery of this new human tumor virus. In 1994, she co-discovered KSHV,THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; Going Off the Beaten Path to Track Down Clues About AIDS also called human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), working with her husband Patrick S. Moore at Columbia University. Chang, Moore and collaborators subsequently showed that this virus was the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma, while others showed it to be the cause of some forms of multicentric Castleman's disease. From two small DNA fragments representing less than 1% of the viral genome, she cloned the entire KSHV 165 kbase genome and fully sequenced the virus genome within two years after its initial discovery. This led to blood tests to detect infection for this virus, discovery of viral proteins likely to cause cancer and elucidation of the role of immune evasion in carcinogenesis caused by virus infection. Dr. Chang is now the American Cancer Society Professor in the Department of Pathology at the University of Pittsburgh. She has received a number of awards for her work, including the Meyenburg Foundation Award for Cancer Research, the Robert Koch Prize, The Sloan-Kettering Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research, the New York City Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science & Technology, the General Motors Charles S.

While some basic ideas of the theory can be traced to Laplace, the formalization started with insurance mathematics, namely ruin theory with Cram√©r and Lundberg. A unified formalization of large deviation theory was developed in 1966, in a paper by Varadhan.S.R.S. Varadhan, Asymptotic probability and differential equations, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 19 (1966),261-286. Large deviations theory formalizes the heuristic ideas of concentration of measures and widely generalizes the notion of convergence of probability measures. Roughly speaking, large deviations theory concerns itself with the exponential decline of the probability measures of certain kinds of extreme or tail events. Introductory examples= An elementary example  Consider a sequence of independent tosses of a fair coin. The possible outcomes could be heads or tails. Let us denote the possible outcome of the i-th trial by X_i, where we encode head as 1 and tail as 0. Now let M_N denote the mean value after N trials, namely :M_N = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i. Then M_N lies between 0 and 1. From the law of large numbers it follows that as N grows, the distribution of M_N converges to 0.5 = \\\\operatorname{E}[X] (the expected value of a single coin toss). Moreover, by the central limit theorem, it follows that M_N is approximately normally distributed for large N. The central limit theorem can provide more detailed information about the behavior of M_N than the law of large numbers. For example, we can approximately find a tail probability of M_N, P(M_N > x), that M_N is greater than x, for a fixed value of N. However, the approximation by the central limit theorem may not be accurate if x is far from \\\\operatorname{E}[X_i] unless N is sufficiently large. Also, it does not provide information about the convergence of the tail probabilities as N \\\\to \\\\infty. However, the large deviation theory can provide answers for such problems. Let us make this statement more precise. For a given value 0.5, let us compute the tail probability P(M_N > x). Define :I(x) = x\\\\ln{x} + (1-x) \\\\ln(1-x) + \\\\ln{2}. Note that the function I(x) is a convex, nonnegative function that is zero at x = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} and increases as x approaches 1. It is the negative of the Bernoulli entropy with p = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}; that it's appropriate for coin tosses follows from the asymptotic equipartition property applied to a Bernoulli trial. Then by Chernoff's inequality, it can be shown that P(M_N > x) < \\\\exp(-NI(x)).\\"Large deviations for performance analysis: queues, communications, and computing\\", Shwartz, Adam, 1953- TN: 1228486 This bound is rather sharp, in the sense that I(x) cannot be replaced with a larger number which would yield a strict inequality for all positive N.Varadhan, S.R.S.,The Annals of Probability 2008, Vol. 36, No. 2, 397‚Äì419, (However, the exponential bound can still be reduced by a subexponential factor on the order of 1/\\\\sqrt N; this follows from the Stirling approximation applied to the binomial coefficient appearing in the Bernoulli distribution.) Hence, we obtain the following result: :P(M_N > x) \\\\approx \\\\exp(-NI(x)) . The probability P(M_N > x) decays exponentially as N \\\\to \\\\infty at a rate depending on x. This formula approximates any tail probability of the sample mean of i.i.d. variables and gives its convergence as the number of samples increases.  Large deviations for sums of independent random variables  In the above example of coin-tossing we explicitly assumed that each toss is an independent trial, and the probability of getting head or tail is always the same. Let X,X_1,X_2, \\\\ldots be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables whose common distribution satisfies a certain growth condition. Then the following limit exists: :\\\\lim_{N\\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\ln P(M_N > x) = - I(x) . Here :M_N = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i, as before. Function I(\\\\cdot) is called the \\"rate function\\" or \\"Cram√©r function\\" or sometimes the \\"entropy function\\". The above-mentioned limit means that for large N, :P(M_N >x) \\\\approx \\\\exp[-NI(x) ], which is the basic result of large deviations theory.http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/varadhan/Spring2012/Chapters1-2.pdfS.R.S. Varadhan, Large Deviations and Applications (SIAM, Philadelphia, 1984) If we know the probability distribution of X, an explicit expression for the rate function can be obtained. This is given by a Legendre‚ÄìFenchel transformation, :I(x) = \\\\sup_{\\\\theta > 0} [\\\\theta x - \\\\lambda(\\\\theta)], where :\\\\lambda(\\\\theta) = \\\\ln \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\exp(\\\\theta X)] is called the cumulant generating function (CGF) and \\\\operatorname{E} denotes the mathematical expectation. If X follows a normal distribution, the rate function becomes a parabola with its apex at the mean of the normal distribution. If {X_i} is a Markov chain, the variant of the basic large deviations result stated above may hold. Formal definition Given a Polish space \\\\mathcal{X} let {\\\\mathbb{P}_N} be a sequence of Borel probability measures on \\\\mathcal{X}, let {a_N} be a sequence of positive real numbers such that \\\\lim_N a_N=\\\\infty, and finally let I:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\to [0, \\\\infty] be a lower semicontinuous functional on \\\\mathcal{X}. The sequence {\\\\mathbb{P}_N} is said to satisfy a large deviation principle with speed {a_n} and rate I if, and only if, for each Borel measurable set E \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{X}, :-\\\\inf_{x \\\\in E^\\\\circ} I(x) \\\\le \\\\varliminf_N a_N^{-1} \\\\log(\\\\mathbb{P}_N(E)) \\\\le \\\\varlimsup_N a_N^{-1} \\\\log(\\\\mathbb{P}_N(E)) \\\\le -\\\\inf_{x \\\\in \\\\overline{E}} I(x), where \\\\overline{E} and E^\\\\circ denote respectively the closure and interior of E.  Brief history  The first rigorous results concerning large deviations are due to the Swedish mathematician Harald Cram√©r, who applied them to model the insurance business.Cram√©r, H. (1944). On a new limit theorem of the theory of probability. Uspekhi Matematicheskikh Nauk, (10), 166-178. From the point of view of an insurance company, the earning is at a constant rate per month (the monthly premium) but the claims come randomly. For the company to be successful over a certain period of time (preferably many months), the total earning should exceed the total claim. Thus to estimate the premium you have to ask the following question: \\"What should we choose as the premium q such that over N months the total claim C = \\\\Sigma X_i should be less than Nq?\\" This is clearly the same question asked by the large deviations theory. Cram√©r gave a solution to this question for i.i.d. random variables, where the rate function is expressed as a power series. A very incomplete list of mathematicians who have made important advances would include Petrov,Petrov V.V. (1954) Generalization of Cram√©r's limit theorem. Uspehi Matem. Nauk, v. 9, No 4(62), 195--202.(Russian) Sanov,Sanov I.N. (1957) On the probability of large deviations of random magnitudes. Matem. Sbornik, v. 42 (84), 11--44. S.R.S. Varadhan (who has won the Abel prize for his contribution to the theory), D. Ruelle, O.E. Lanford, Amir Dembo, and Ofer Zeitouni.Dembo, A., & Zeitouni, O. (2009). Large deviations techniques and applications (Vol. 38). Springer Science & Business Media Applications Principles of large deviations may be effectively applied to gather information out of a probabilistic model. Thus, theory of large deviations finds its applications in information theory and risk management. In physics, the best known application of large deviations theory arise in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics (in connection with relating entropy with rate function).  Large deviations and entropy  The rate function is related to the entropy in statistical mechanics. This can be heuristically seen in the following way. In statistical mechanics the entropy of a particular macro-state is related to the number of micro-states which corresponds to this macro-state. In our coin tossing example the mean value M_N could designate a particular macro-state. And the particular sequence of heads and tails which gives rise to a particular value of M_N constitutes a particular micro-state. Loosely speaking a macro-state having a higher number of micro-states giving rise to it, has higher entropy. And a state with higher entropy has a higher chance of being realised in actual experiments. The macro-state with mean value of 1/2 (as many heads as tails) has the highest number of micro-states giving rise to it and it is indeed the state with the highest entropy. And in most practical situations we shall indeed obtain this macro-state for large numbers of trials. The \\"rate function\\" on the other hand measures the probability of appearance of a particular macro-state. The smaller the rate function the higher is the chance of a macro-state appearing. In our coin-tossing the value of the \\"rate function\\" for mean value equal to 1/2 is zero. In this way one can see the \\"rate function\\" as the negative of the \\"entropy\\". There is a relation between the \\"rate function\\" in large deviations theory and the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence, the connection is established by Sanov's theorem (see Sanov and Novak,Novak S.Y. (2011) Extreme value methods with applications to finance. Chapman & Hall/CRC Press. . ch. 14.5). In a special case, large deviations are closely related to the concept of Gromov‚ÄìHausdorff limits.Kotani M., Sunada T. Large deviation and the tangent cone at infinity of a crystal lattice, Math. Z. 254, (2006), 837-870.

After Raystown Lake, it is the second largest lake contained entirely in Pennsylvania. It measures 52 miles of shoreline, 13 miles in length, 60 feet deep at points, and has a surface area in excess of 5,700 acres (23 km2). It was created in 1926 by the Pennsylvania Power & Light Company (PP&L;) for hydroelectric purposes as well as flood control; however, it is best known as one of several major recreational destinations in the Pocono Mountains. It is located near the Borough of Hawley, and forms part of the boundary between Pike and Wayne counties. See map.  History  The Lenape Indians named the area \\"Wallenpaupack\\" which means \\"The Stream of Swift and Slow Water.\\" William Penn later owned the land and then deeded it to his son Thomas Penn. Upon his death it went to the Penn estate, which sold approximately 12,000 acres in 1793 to James Wilson, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.Smith, Charles Page. James Wilson Founding Father 1742‚Äì1798. Chapel Hill: North Carolina UP, 1956. Print. In order to create the lake, PP&L; constructed a dam on Wallenpaupack Creek at Wilsonville and a levee named the Tafton Dike. The project took 2,700 men from 1924 to 1926 to complete and seven months for the reservoir to fill after the dam was closed off. Land to be flooded was purchased by PP&L; from about 100 owners at about $20 an acre and most of the property was razed or moved. Some house foundations remained, and as the valley was flooded the water was so clear that one could see the foundations under the water. Trees were cut but stumps were not removed. In all, of roads and utility poles were rerouted, and Purdytown cemetery had to be relocated. The former town of Wilsonville, which had been named after James Wilson, now lies under the water near the dam. Water travels 3.5 miles in a 13-foot diameter steel pipe (originally wood) to power two turbines which combined can generate 44 megawatts of power. Discharge is into the Lakawaxen River, which flows into the Delaware River. PP&L; managed the 3,300 acres of land around the lake until June 2015. While homeowners have access rights, they must apply for permits for installing landscaping or exterior lights and cannot cut down vegetation to improve their view of lake without a permit ‚Äî a provision to keep the man-made lake's shore natural looking when viewed from the water and to minimize erosion. Climate According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Lake Wallenpaupack has a Temperate Continental climate (Dc) with warm summers (b), cold winters (o) and year-around precipitation (Dcbo). Dcbo climates are characterized by at least one month having an average mean temperature ‚â§ , four to seven months with an average mean temperature ‚â• , all months with an average mean temperature < and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. Although most summer days are comfortably humid at Lake Wallenpaupack, episodes of heat and high humidity can occur with heat index values > . Since 1981, the highest air temperature was on 08/06/2001, and the highest daily average mean dew point was on 08/01/2006. July is the peak month for thunderstorm activity which correlates with the average warmest month of the year. Since 1981, the wettest calendar day was on 09/17/2004. During the winter months, the plant hardiness zone is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of . Since 1981, the coldest air temperature was on 01/21/1994. Episodes of extreme cold and wind can occur with wind chill values < . The average snowiest month is January which correlates with the average coldest month of the year. Ice storms and large snowstorms depositing ‚â• of snow occur nearly every year, particularly during nor‚Äôeasters from December through March. Hydrology The lakes' surface area is approximately 5,700 acres. It was created by the construction of a 70 foot tall dam and the Tafton Dike at the east end. The largest inflow into Lake Wallenpaupack is Wallenpaupack Creek, at the west end of the lake. The dividing line between the lake and the creek is the Ledgedale Road bridge. East Wallenpaupack Creek extends south through Newfoundland and into the northern edge of Monroe County. West Wallenpaupack Creek extends to Mt Cobb and Lake Henry. Streams directly entering the lake include Waynewood, Goose Pond, Purdy, Strohs, Lyons and Beach House creeks, and Stony, Spring Hill, Seeleys and Mill brooks. Because the lake exists to generate hydroelectric power, every spring the water level is allowed to rise to a target elevation of 1,187 feet for June 1, then during the summer and early fall, progressively lower until it reaches 1,179 feet. Late fall and into early spring the water level is maintained at 1181‚Äì82 feet. Snowpack melt is used to raise the water level during April and May. People with waterfront property move their private docks out as the water recedes (see photos). Docks and buoys must be removed from the lake to above the high water line by December 1 and not placed back in the lake until after ice is gone. Homeowners along the lake have access rights but not privacy rights - anyone can walk along the shoreline below the high water line. Fences or other barriers are not allowed. Ownership changes In June 2014 PP&L; announced it would be divesting its electrical generation facilities. Plans called for a spin-off to a newly created company Talen Energy formed from the generation assets of PP&L; and Riverstone Holdings. On June 1, 2015 Talen Energy became the official owner of Wallenpaupack Hydroelectric Project generation plant and therefore control, under the FERC license, of Lake Wallenpaupack. In order to comply with a FERC regulation, on October 8, 2015 Talen Energy announced plans to sell the Lake Wallenpaupack hydroelectric project to Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P of Toronto, Canada. The sale was completed on April 1, 2016. Brookfield maintains website information about its management of Lake Wallenpaupack.  Recreation  An integral part of the Lake Region of the Pocono Mountains, Lake Wallenpaupack is a recreation attraction in the tri- state area (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York), particularly in the summertime. The lake provides boating, swimming, and fishing access in the summer, as well as snowmobiling, ice skating and ice fishing in the winter. A free boat launch facility for trailered boats is located at Mangan Cove, located off of State Route 590. There are launch-for-fee access areas at Caffrey, Ironwood Point, Ledgedale and Wilsonville. The lake has no boat horsepower limit. Boat speeds are limited to 25 miles per hour between sunset and sunrise. Summer weekends, daytime boat speeds are limited to 45 miles per hour. The lake's wooded shoreline provides opportunities for hiking and viewing wildlife, including whitetail deer and black bear. Shuman Point has parking and a three-mile trail of moderate difficulty. Lake fish include smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, rock bass, bluegill, walleye, muskellunge, northern pike, pickerel, rainbow trout, brown trout, catfish and yellow perch. Walleye, striped bass and hybrid striped bass have been stocked in the lake.Pennsylvania Fish & Boat Commission Pike County, PA The lake is long, has of shoreline, and is about deep at its maximum depth. There are four islands, all open to the public for daytime visits but no overnight camping. From east to west: Epply, Kipp, Burns and Cairns.Boating Guide Map Pennsylvania Power & Light Kipp may be closed to the public until August because bald eagles have established a nest site on the island and return to it most years. The last weekend of August hosts Wally Lake Fest, a three-day weekend of events scattered on and around the lake and in the neighboring town of Hawley, including the live music Wallypalooza held on docks floating in front of the Tafton Dike.Wally Lake Fest Wally Lake Fest Committee A notable activity during the winter months on Lake Wallenpaupack is its annual \\"Ice Tee Golf Tournament\\", which takes place on the frozen lake.

EDUCATION AND OUTREACH The Lake Wallenpaupack Watershed Management District (LWWMD) is a nonprofit organization started in 1979 and dedicated to improving the water quality of the lake. Land ecology According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Lake Wallenpaupack would have a transient dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (104) and Northern Hardwood (106) with a transient vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest and Northern hardwood forest. Groves of Eastern hemlock ( T. canadensis) trees are dying because of infestation with the sap-sucking insect Adelges tsugae (hemlock woolly adelgid).United States Forest Service: Hemlock Woolly Adelgid website The peak spring bloom typically occurs in early-May and peak fall color usually occurs in early-October. The plant hardiness zone is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of . The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania established Wildlife Management Units (WMUs) in 2003. Lake Wallenpaupack, which is on the dividing line of Wayne and Pike counties, is in WMU 3D. Statewide, deer over-population had had a negative impact on plant ecology due to over-browsing of ground cover and young trees. As of 2018, the deer population is estimated at 1,500,000 which equates to 30 per square mile. Traditional hunting practices had allowed shooting of only antlered male deer. This fostered a large sex-ratio imbalance and fast population growth. Pennsylvania instituted antlerless hunting to manage the over-population problem. In 2003, 465,000 deer were shot during hunting season, and the female to male ratio was 2.25:1. In 2018, 375,000 deer were shot and the ratio had decreased to 1.5:1. The harvest in the WMU 3D area around Lake Wallenpaupack is 8,000 to 10,000 deer per year. In popular culture *Lake Wallenpaupack was featured as a retreat location in the popular TV show The Office in the eleventh episode of the second season, titled Booze Cruise. However, the episode was not filmed on Lake Wallenpaupack (which would have been frozen, as the event was described as taking place in January).

She was the oldest of six children born to Sarah Tappan (n√©e Hoadley) Dodge (1832‚Äì1909) and William Earl Dodge Jr. (1832‚Äì1903), a merchant devoted to religious and philanthropic works known as the \\"Christian Merchant\\". Her younger siblings included William Earl Dodge III; Cleveland Hoadley Dodge; Mary Melissa Hoadley Dodge; Alice Clinton Hoadley Dodge (who married William Church Osborn); and Morris Jesup Dodge, who died young; She was the granddaughter of U.S. Representative from New York William E. Dodge and the great-granddaughter of David Low Dodge. Her grandfather William and her great- grandfather (William's his father-in-law), Anson Greene Phelps, formed the import firm of Phelps Dodge, which was one of the largest copper mining corporations in the United States, and created the family's vast wealth. Her maternal grandfather was David Hoadley, the president of the Panama Railroad, and her great-grandfather was prominent architect David Hoadley. Grace was mostly educated at home by private tutors, but also spent two years at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut between 1872 and 1874. As a young woman, she taught Sunday school at the Madison Square Chapel and, later, at industrial schools for the Children's Aid Society. Philanthropy Throughout her life, and in death, Grace donated millions of dollars and years of service to philanthropic work. She was instrumental in forming the Kitchen Garden Association, which became the Industrial Education Association. She was the main source of funds, and first treasurer, for the New York College for the Training of Teachers, which became Teachers College, and subsequently a school of Columbia University. Committed to helping working girls, Dodge organized the first Working Girls Society among a group of silk workers in 1884. According to Dodge, the specific objectives of the Society were to \\"furnish pleasant rooms where its members can pass the evening; to organize classes for mutual enjoyment and improvement; to collect a circulating library for use of members; and to develop co-operative measures which shall be for the benefit of the members.\\" On February 16, 1885, eleven of the clubs in New York City united to form the Association of Working Girls' Societies, with Dodge as founder and driving force. She negotiated the merger of two opposing young women's groups into the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of the United States. She also organized the Travelers Aid Society of New York in 1907 to protect female travelers from falling victim to vice, especially the so-called \\"white slave traffic\\" (the coercion of white women into prostitution). She had called for the creation of a National Travelers' Aid Society, but died before this could be accomplished.

It is in South Chotanagpur division and one of the 24 districts the Indian state of Jharkhand. The district of Khunti was carved out of Ranchi district on 12 September 2007. It is historically known as the centre of activity of the Birsa movement. As of 2011, it is the second least populous district of Jharkhand (out of 24), after Lohardaga. The district is a part of the Red Corridor. Climate The climate is tropical rain forest. Maximum rainfall takes place during the months from July to September that accounts for more than 90% of total rainfall in the state. Demographics India census, Khunti had a population of 29,271. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Khunti has an average literacy rate of 69%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 75%, and female literacy is 61%. In Khunti, 15% of the population is under 6 years of age.  Utility services  There is a lack of utility services of water supply due to which people dug open wells in every house or the use of hand pumps for water procurement. Postal services have proved to be much efficient. Healthcare There is a civil hospital at Khunti with facilities for providing medical facilities to the public. Transport= By Air  Birsa Munda Airport in Ranchi is the nearest airport. It is around 33 km from Khunti.  By Rail  There is no railway station in Khunti. The nearest station to Khunti is Hatia railway station. Most people use bus or taxi services to reach Hatia Railway Station or Ranchi Railway Station.  Tourist attractions  Panchghagh Falls : Panchghagh Falls is located around 15 km from Khunti in a place on way to Khunti-Chaibasa. These five falls originate from high altitudes and the foot of the falls is picnic spot, to have the experience of bath under the gushing water. Deer Park : The park has a number of gardens, pathways and playing parks for children. The main attraction here is the park safari. Angrabadi Temple : Angrabadi is a temple complex near Khunti. The temple was renamed as Amreshwar Dham by the Sage Shankaracharya Swami Swarupananda Saraswathi. The temples enclose the Hindu Gods such as Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesh, Rama-Sita and Hanuman. Perwaghag : One of the waterfalls in Jharkhand, located in the forest near Torpa block. In rainy season it is inaccessible. But, in winter around Christmas and New Year it is a common picnic spot. St. Michael's Church, Khunti One of the oldest church in Khunti St. Michael's Church (, colloquially called Michel, ) is one of Khunti's five Lutheran main churches (Hauptkirchen) and the most famous church in the city. St. Michaelis is a landmark of the city and it is considered to be one of the finest Hanseatic Protestant baroque churches. The church was purposely built Protestant unlike many other Hamburg churches which were originally built by Roman Catholics and were converted to Protestantism during the Reformation. It is dedicated to the Archangel Michael. A large bronze statue, standing above the portal of the church shows the archangel conquering the devil. The 132-meter high Baroque spire totally covered with copper is a prominent feature of Hamburg's skyline and has always been a landfall mark for ships sailing up the river Elbe. St. Michael's Church, Khunti Festival and dances Khunti is home to people of many castes, creeds and sects. Festivals are celebrated with pomp, glory and in harmony specially local festivals like Faghun, Sarhul, Dasain, Tusu, Karam etc. Jadur Susun, Karam Susun (dance) Basically people are known Adiwasi dance but actually its name are Jadur Susun (Dance), Karam Susun (Dance) etc. these dances are dancing occasionally. Adiwasi dance Economy Majority of the population is tribal in the Khunti sub-division and they are dependent on agriculture and forests for their livelihood. Lack of food security from the land has compelled many tribal families to migrate out of their own villages. This is despite the fact that the existing landholdings can provide stable livelihoods to the tribal families. Lack of land development, irrigation, credit, know-how for improved agriculture, access to market etc. act as serious constraints leading to a large number of impoverished tribal families. The area however is endowed with good rainfall - in most blocks the annual rainfall exceeds 1100 mm. There are numerous small rivers, rivulets and streams, which carry water up to the month of February or March. In spite of that, most cultivated lands do not have assurance of water for crops even during the monsoon. Inadequacy of water harvesting infrastructures and water use systems have allowed the rain water to run off through the streams to downstream areas beyond the State, leaving the lands here dry. It has been long argued that ensuring water assurance to crops and improving land husbandry practices could go a long way in improving the livelihoods of poor families and impacting the local economy in rural areas. However, it has also been the experience that timely credit in adequate amount and know-how for improved agriculture are also essential along with water assurance to crops. For water assurance, the large irrigation schemes have not been successful in the district and other parts of Jharkhand. The area is known for the Lac cultivation. A large part of the India's total lac production comes from this area. Lac, a natural polymer (resin) is produced by a tiny insect, Kerria lacca (Kerr), which is purposely cultured on shoots of several species of trees, mainly palas, kusum and ber. This agricultural profession of lac cultivation is a subsidiary source of income for a large number of families in the area. A number of development agencies are active in the area, prominent among which is a national level development organization called PRADAN, with an office in Torpa road. Others are missionary organizations such as, NBJK, and SGVS.

To the south west of the city is the site of ancient Phoenice, which was declared an Archaeological Park in 2005.Finiq - Albanian Tourism - Official Website There is little local employment apart from that provided by the State, and Delvin√´ benefits little from the tourist boom in Saranda. The town has a mixed population of Albanians and Greeks. According to the Human Rights Watch, Greeks constituted 50% of the town's population in 1989, but this fell to 25% in 1999. History In antiquity the region was inhabited by the Greek tribe of the Chaonians. In the Middle Ages, Delvin√´ was part of the Despotate of Epirus. After defeat of Slavic tribes in 616 when they unsuccessfully besieged Thessaloniki, one of the tribes (Vajunites) migrated to Epirus. Until the 14th century this region in Epirus was referred to as Vanegetia, from the name of this Slavic tribe. Similar toponyms like Viyanite or Viyantije survived until the 16th century when they were replaced with the name Delvin√´. Delvin√´ under Ottoman Turkish control Orthodox church in Delvin√´ The separate Sanjak of Delvina was established in the middle of 16th century, due to the need to secure Ottoman control in the region towards potential Venetian infiltration from nearby Butrinto and to control the rebellious zone of Himara. The county town was Delvin√´, yet during the 18th century the local Pasha moved the seat of the sanjak from Delvin√´ to Gjirokast√´r. The official name did not change however, as it was also referred to as the Sanjak of Gjirokast√´r. In an ecclesiastical entry of 1635, the Codex of the church of Delvin√´ written in the Greek language noted that Muslims had increased and dwelt in quarters inhabited by Orthodox Christians, had confiscated their churches and converted them into mosques, thereby forcing the non-Islamized Christians to move to other quarters of the town. The Turkish traveler Evliya √áelebi visited Delvin√´ around 1670 and gave some information about the city in his travel book. He reported that in the Middle Ages Delvin√´ was in the hands of the Spanish and later the Venetians.Dankoff, Robert, & Robert Elsie (2000). Evliya √áelebi in Albania and Adjacent Regions: Kossovo, Montenegro, Ohrid. Brill. p. 59. In his own time, Ajaz Mehmet Pasha - a native Albanian - governed the Sanjak-bey of Delvin√´.Dankoff & Elsie. Evliya √áelebi in Albania and Adjacent Regions. 2000. p. 59. The sanjak covered 24 zeamets and 155 timars. There was a Turkish garrison, whose command on the castle was from Delvin√´. According to the description of √áelebi, the small fortress had a good cisterne, an ammunition depot and a small mosque. In the city there were about 100 brick-built houses.Dankoff & Elsie. Evliya √áelebi in Albania and Adjacent Regions. 2000. p. 61. These stood relatively far apart and nearly every house had a tower. He noted that a town wall was missing. There was several mosques, three Medreses and about 80 stores, as well as an open market place.Dankoff & Elsie. Evliya √áelebi in Albania and Adjacent Regions. 2000. p. 59, 61. √áelebi also observed that during this time, all the inhabitants of Delvin√´ spoke the Albanian language while having no knowledge of the Greek language.Dankoff & Elsie. Evliya √áelebi in Albania and Adjacent Regions. 2000. p. 61. \\"The inhabitants all speak Albanian and do not know Greek.\\" In an ecclesiastical entry of 1730, the Codex of the church of Delvin√´ noted that some of the Christian Greek clergy had linguistic difficulties in administrating to their congregation, as there were Christian villagers living within the region of Delvin√´ who were Albanian speaking.Xhufi, P√´llumb (2006).

Thus, in two instances in 1713 and 1749, Spyros Stratis and Spyridon Rizos respectively, notable members of the local diaspora in Venice, financially supported the expansion of the local Greek education system, as well as donating vast sums of money to local Orthodox monasteries and churches.Koltsida, Athina Antonios (2007).

In the early 20th century a √ßet√´ (armed band) consisting of 200 activists of the Albanian National Awakening was formed in Delvin√´. During the Balkan Wars and the subsequent Ottoman defeat, the Greek Army entered the city at March 3, 1913. In June 1914 the town hosted the constituent assembly of the representatives of Northern Epirus that discussed and finally approved the Protocol of Corfu, on July 26, 1914.Kondis Basil.

Jewish community Until the Second World War, a small Jewish community existed in Delvin√´. It consisted of Jews from Spain who had come to Delvin√´ when under Ottoman rule and had close connections to the large Jewish community in Ioannina. After the war, nearly all the Jews emigrated to Israel.

A year after her birth, her family moved to 214 Rosslyn Avenue, Hamilton, Ontario. Her father worked for the Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) as a streetcar conductor She was suspected of and arrested for murder after five local children in Hamilton, Ontario found the torso of her missing estranged Russian husband, known as John Dick. His head and limbs had been sawn from his body and ‚Äî as later evidence revealed ‚Äî were disposed of in the furnace of her home at 32 Carrick Avenue. She was defended in her first murder trial in 1946 by J.J. Sullivan, convicted and sentenced to hang, but her lawyer J.J. Robinette appealed her case and won an eventual acquittal. In the meantime, however, a partly mummified body of a male infant was found in her attic, encased in cement in an old suitcase. The infant was identified as her son Peter David White. She was retried for murder in 1947 and sentenced to life in prison, but was paroled in 1958 after serving only eleven years in Kingston's Prison for Women, with a new identity and job and disappeared from public view and her file was permanently sealed after her 1985 pardon.

A 2002 television film, Torso: The Evelyn Dick Story, suggests Dick protected her parents, who were also viable suspects in the murder of her baby and husband, and that she was sexually abused by her father and exploited by both parents (especially by her mother) to provide them a higher standing and income. The movie was originally scheduled to be aired on September 11, 2001, but was delayed until March 18, 2002 due to the terrorist attacks on the original air date.

Among other things, he is particularly known as a photographer whose work immortalised Jewish life in Poland in the 1920s and 1930s. Biography=Early life and education Alter-Sholem Kacyzne was born on 31 May 1885 to a poor working-class family in Vilna in Imperial Russia (now Vilnius in Lithuania), within the Pale of Settlement (the mandatory territory allowed as residence for Jews).Niborski, Yitskhok (17 August 2010). \\"Kacyzne, Alter- Sholem.\\" YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe. yivoencyclopedia.org. Retrieved 20 June 2018. His father worked as a bricklayer and his mother worked as a seamstress. Kacyzne spoke Yiddish at home and was educated in a cheder and in a Russian-Jewish school. An avid reader, he taught himself Hebrew, Russian, Polish, German and French. Following the death of his father in 1899, when Kacyzne was fourteen, he went to work as an apprentice in his uncle's professional photography studio in Ekaterinoslav, New Russia (now Dnipro, Ukraine). While engaged in self-education, he began to write short stories in Russian. He also wrote poems and sent some of these to the Yiddish author S. Ansky. Adult life and career Alter Kacyzne with his wife Khana and daughter Sulamita in Warsaw, Poland ca. 1930. Around this time he married Khana Khachnov. In 1910, greatly attracted by the Yiddish works of I. L. Peretz, he moved to Warsaw, where he developed a close relationship with Peretz, who became his literary mentor. In Warsaw he opened a photographic studio. In the 1920s, he worked as a photojournalist for the New York City- based newspaper Forverts (Forward). He travelled as a photographer to Poland, Romania, Italy, Spain, Palestine and Morocco. In the years 1927‚Äì1928 Kacyzne's photographs, accompanied by his travel essays, were published in the Warsaw magazine Our Express. His work as a photographer was combined with his literary work. As a critic and essayist, he published articles on literary and social issues in Warsaw and Vilna. He was co-editor of several journals. In the early 1920s he founded the literary series The Ark (Di Teyve, 1920, together with David Einhorn), the short-lived magazines Bells (Glokn, 1921) and The Links (Ringen, 1921‚Äì1922, in cooperation with Michal Veiherte ). In 1924 he became co-founder of the magazine Literary Pages (Literarishe Bleter, 1924‚Äì1939; together with Israel Joshua Singer, Peretz Markish, Melehom Ravichem and Nachman Mayzilem). In 1930 he participated in newspapers with a communist orientation: Literary Tribune (Literarishe Tribune; 1930‚Äì1933), Tribune (1934), Comrade (Der Fraynd, 1934‚Äì1935, Yiddish: ◊ì◊¢◊® ◊§÷ø◊®◊ô◊ô÷∑◊†◊ì), Literature (Literatur; 1935) In 1937‚Äì1938, he issued the fortnightly magazine, My film speaks (), the contents of which were critical articles, translations and satires. War and death In 1939, after the Nazi occupation of Poland, he fled with his family to Soviet-occupied Lvov (today Lviv, Ukraine). He was put in charge of the literary section of the Lvov State Jewish Theatre. When Germany went on to attack the Soviets in 1941, Kacyzne tried to escape the Nazis and moved farther east to the also Soviet-occupied city of Tarnopol (today Ternopil, Ukraine). By the time he arrived, the Nazis had already occupied Tarnopol. Kacyzne was beaten to death by Ukrainian collaborators during a pogrom directed against the town's Jewish population on 7 July, 1941. His wife Khana was murdered in the Belzec extermination camp, while his daughter Sulamita survived by hiding in Poland as a non-Jew.Gilbert, Martin (2001). The Jews in the Twentieth Century. New York: Schocken Books. p. 117. Photography Arriving in Warsaw in 1910, Kacyzne opened his own photography studio. Originally it was located on D≈Çuga street; the address changed several times. Kacyzne worked at portraits, shooting memorable events (weddings, bar mitzvahs), and soon became a well-known photographer. The turning point in his professional career as a photographer began in 1921, when he was commissioned by the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), a charitable organisation based in the United States of America, to make a series of images dedicated to the life of Jews in Polish cities and towns, including the eastern lands that were part of the territory of Poland ‚Äì Galicia and Volhynia. As a result, Kacyzne travelled to more than 120 Polish settlements.

Biography Born in Narva, present-day Estonia, Shakhmatov was brought up by his uncle near Saratov. He went to a public school in Moscow and developed interest for Old Russian language and literature at an early age. At the age of 16, his articles started to appear in the most authoritative journal of Slavic studies of that time, the Archive of Slavic Philology (). Shakhmatov furthered his education at the Moscow University (1883‚Äì1887), later delivering lectures in the same institution. His first monograph, published in 1886, examined the language of ancient Novgorod charters. In 1891 he became so enthusiastic about zemstvo that he gave up his scholarly pursuits for three years and held a minor administrative office in his native village. In 1894, Shakhmatov returned to Moscow and won great acclaim for his Ph.D. dissertation, entitled Studies in the Sphere of Russian Phonetics. Five years later, he was admitted to the Russian Academy of Sciences, and over the following years became one of the most reputable academicians. He revived the Academy's linguistic periodicals, edited the academic dictionary of Russian language and was elected to represent the Academy at the State Council of Imperial Russia and Imperial State Duma. In 1909, Shakhmatov moved to work at Saint Petersburg University as a professor. By that time, he had been elected doctor honoris causa by the Charles University, Berlin University, Polish Academy of Sciences, and many other scholarly societies. 1917 Revolution Shakhmatov's grave in Volkovo Cemetery, Saint Petersburg Shakhmatov participated in the Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia set up in February 1917. He also helped prepare sweeping reforms of Russian orthography, which would be implemented by the Bolsheviks in 1918, and his orthography is still used to this day. Shakhmatov refused to leave Petrograd for the West, a fatal decision that led to his premature death from malnutrition and exhaustion in 1920. The Academy subsequently cherished his memory and instituted a special Shakhmatov Prize, to be awarded \\"for the best works in source science, textology and linguistics\\". Works Shakhmatov is an author of several works in phonetics, dialectology, lexicography, syntax, history of East Slavic languages, modern Russian literary language, history of East Slavic people, history of Old Russian literature, Slavic accentology. In his monographies \\"Research in a field of the Russian phonetics\\" (–ò—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤ –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π —Ñ–æ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∏, 1894), \\"To the history of sounds in the Russian language\\" (–ö –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –∑–≤—É–∫–æ–≤ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —è–∑—ã–∫–∞, 1903), and others, Shakhmatov set a goal to restore the All- Russian pronunciation in all of its phonetical details by way of juxtaposition of old and modern eastern Slavic dialects with involving of data from other Slavic languages. Shakhmatov is best remembered for having pioneered textological research of early Russian chronicles, notably the Primary Chronicle. He established with a great degree of precision the stages of evolution of that key document, even attempting to reconstruct the postulated proto-version of Nestor's chronicle. His research proved seminal for subsequent generations of historians. Shakhmatov was also responsible for publication and pioneering studies of minor or derelict Slavic languages. His studies of Slavic etymology revolved around the idea of close contacts and influences between the ancient Slavs and Celts, a hypothesis that was subsequently discarded. In particular, Shakhmatov was convinced that Prekmurje Slovene, spoken in Prekmurje and the Slovene March, contains Celtic elements due to its front rounded vowels √º and √∂. In fact, Prekmurje Slovene is simply dialect of Slovene, and the sounds √º and √∂ are common in other dialects of Slovene, such as in Prlekija and some parts of Carinthia.

It is usually housed at the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas. The piece depicts a scene of \\"raining men\\", nearly identical to each other dressed in dark overcoats and bowler hats, who seem to be either falling down like rain drops, floating up like helium balloons, or just stationed in mid-air as no movement or motion is implied. The backdrop features red-roofed buildings and a mostly blue partly cloudy sky, lending credence to the theory that the men are not raining. The men are equally spaced in a lattice, facing the viewpoint and receding back in rhombic grid layers. Magritte lived in a similar suburban environment, and dressed in a similar fashion. The bowler hat was a common feature of much of his work, and appears in paintings such as The Son of Man. Charly Herscovici, who was bequeathed copyright on the artist's works, commented on Golconda: One interpretation is that Magritte is demonstrating the line between individuality and group association, and how it is blurred. All of these men are dressed the same, have the same bodily features and are all floating/falling. This leaves us to look at the men as a group. Whereas if we look at each person, we can predict that they may be completely different from another figure. As was often the case with Magritte's works, the title Golconda was found by his poet friend Louis Scutenaire. Golkonda is a ruined city in the state of Telangana, India, near Hyderabad, which from the mid-14th century until the end of the 17th was the capital of two successive kingdoms; the fame it acquired through being the center of the region's legendary diamond industry was such that its name remains, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, \\"a synonym for 'mine of wealth'.\\" Magritte included a likeness of Scutenaire in the painting ‚Äì his face is used for the large man by the chimney of the house on the right of the picture.

He served as mayor of Danville, Virginia (1855-1861), as its delegate to the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 and later for one term in the Virginia House of Delegates (1871-1873) Sutherlin's plantation home became the temporary residence for President of the Confederate States of America Jefferson Davis and his Cabinet from April 3 - April 10, 1865, the week before Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Courthouse. Early and family life Born in 1822 to George Sanders Sutherlin (1796-1856) and his wife, the former Polly Starlings Norman (1794-1860). His grandfather bought a large tract north of Danville in 1798. The Sutherlin family included at least three additional boys and two girls: John M. Sutherlin, George Haskins Sutherlin (1826-1861), Paulina Lane Sutherlin (b.1824) and Narcissa Adeline Sutherlin Hodnett (1820-1888). His youngest brother, Nathaniel Green Sutherlin (1836-1843), never reached adulthood.https://rdricketts.com/blog/2008/07/27/maj-william-t-sutherlins- family-buried-in-north-danville-1843/ William T. Sutherlin married Jeanie Erwin Patrick (1827-1911) in October 1849 in Greensboro, North Carolina. She would survive him by more than a decade, as would their daughter Janine Career A planter and industrialist, William T. Sutherlin used enslaved black labor, owning nine boys 10-16 years old and 25 adult males between 18 and 50 years old in 1850.1850 U.S. Federal Census for Danville, Pittsylvania County, Virginia, Slave Schedules pp. An entrepreneur and industrialist, Sutherlin developed ways to improve the process of preparing the region's bright leaf tobacco for market, as there was great demand for this commodity. Before the Civil War, Sutherlin was the first Virginian to apply steam power to hydraulic tobacco presses; he owned and operated the second-largest tobacco factory in the state. Sutherlin also founded and served as the first president of the Bank of Danville. In 1855, Sutherlin was elected as Danville's mayor and served for 6 years. He resigned the office after being as one of its two delegates to the Virginia Convention of 1861. Sutherlin opposed secession on the initial vote, but changed his vote after Fort Sumter was fired upon on April 12, 1861. American Civil War In his 40s and with worse health than his brother George H. Sutherland (who volunteered, became a lieutenant in the 38th Virginia Infantry and died in Richmond in December 1861), William Sutherlin could not serve in the active military. Appointed instead as Quartermaster of Danville, a primary Confederate supply depot and arsenal. Sutherlin rose to the rank of major, and his duties included oversight of food, medicine, and arms supply. Major Sutherlin also allowed his tobacco factory to be used as a prison for captured Union soldiers. William T. Sutherlin Mansion, Danville, Virginia. Built for Sutherlin in 1859, the home became famous as the temporary residence of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America As Union troops were on the verge of capturing the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia, on April 3, 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet fled south on the Richmond and Danville Railroad for Danville. Sutherlin opened his home to the beleaguered executive and his cabinet as a temporary residence until April 10. Here Davis wrote and signed his last official proclamation as President of the Confederacy, dissolving the government, before continuing south to Greensboro, North Carolina.Dodd (1907), pp. 353‚Äì357. Postwar After the war, Sutherlin continued to cultivate his plantation and pursue business ventures. He became a member of the Committee of Nine which opposed provisions in the new proposed state constitution from the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868. In 1871 Danville and Pittsylvania County voters elected him as one of their two (part time) representatives in the Virginia General Assembly, where he served a single two year term. Death and legacy Sutherlin died in 1893, survived by his widow and daughter. He is buried in the family plot in what became Green Hill Cemetery.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14306470 His papers are held by the University of North Carolina Special Collections library.https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/03327/ The William T Sutherlin Mansion has been adapted for use as the Danville Museum of Fine Arts and History.

A native of Lucca, he became regarded as one of the most distinguished researchers on Friedrich Nietzsche, and harshly criticized the edition of The Will to Power, which he regarded as a forgery, in his book The will to power does not exist. After the end of fascism in Italy, Montinari became an active member of the Italian Communist Party, with which he was occupied with the translation of German writings. During 1953, when he visited East Germany for research, he witnessed the Uprising of 1953. Later, after the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, he drifted away from orthodox Marxism and his career in party organizations. He did however keep his membership in the Italian Communist Party and stayed true to the aims of socialism. At the end of the 1950s, with Giorgio Colli, who was his teacher in the 1940s, Montinari began to prepare an Italian translation of Nietzsche's works. After reviewing the contemporary collection of Nietzsche's works and the manuscripts in Weimar, Colli and Montinari decided to begin a new, critical edition. This edition became the scholarly standard, and was published in Italian by Adelphi in Milan, in French by √âditions Gallimard in Paris, in German by Walter de Gruyter and in Dutch by Sun (translated by Michel van Nieuwstadt). Of particular help for this project was Montinari's ability to decipher Nietzsche's nearly unreadable handwriting, which before had only been transcribed by Peter Gast (born Heinrich K√∂selitz). In 1972, Montinari and others founded the international journal Nietzsche-Studien, to which Montinari would remain a significant contributor until his death. Through his translations and commentary on Nietzsche, Montinari demonstrated a method of interpretation based on philological research that would forgo hasty speculations. He saw value in placing Nietzsche in the context of his time, and to this end, Colli and he began a critical collection of Nietzsche's correspondence. Montinari died in Florence in 1986.

The Younger Futhark are given after the Hebrew alphabet on the preceding page, and the Anglo-Saxon futhorc on the same page. The text of the rune poem was unfortunately destroyed in the 19th century by chemicals intended for its preservation. It survives in an 1828 drawing by Wilhelm Grimm. Under a heading ABECEDARIUM NORD, the manuscript presents the Younger Futhark in three lines. Linguistically, the text is a mixture of Old Norse, Old Saxon and Old High German. It is probably based on a Danish original, maybe imported from Haithabu to Lower Germany, and adapted to the idiom of its recipients. The background of the Carolingian notation of Norse runes is that of intensified contacts between the Frankish Empire and Denmark which necessitated interpreters for economic and political exchanges. The following is a transcription of Grimm's drawing (the oblique stroke indicates words written below the line): : feu forman /  ur after  thuris thrit[c]en / stabu  os ist [he]mo / oboro  rat end/os uuritan : cha[on] thanne / cliuot hagal ·öæ nau[t] hab&  is ar endi so[l] : [] brica endi man / midi  lagu the leohto  yr al bihab[et] The Abecedarium Nordmanicum is on the same page as the Abecedarium Anguliscum (the Anglo-Saxon runes). There are interlineal glosses for some of the runes specific to the Younger Futhark, giving their Anglo-Saxon phonetic equivalents: hagal is glossed with haegl, ar with ac, man with man, and yr with yr. The content of the poem are the names of the runes, connected by a few additional alliterating words as mnemonical aids. For the r, m and l runes, the Anglo-Saxon names are given rather than the Scandinavian ones, as rat, man and lagu for reidh, madr and logr, respectively. The Anglo- Saxon runes (wreat) written underneath the feu forman of the first line. It is not clear whether they should be considered part of the poem's text. There are slight differences as to how the poem has been read. Gall√©e (1894) reads the text as follows:Johan Hendrik Gall√©e Altsaechsische Sprachdenkmaeler (1894), p. 266 : Feu forman, Ur after, Thuris thritten stabu, Os ist imo oboro, Rat endost uuritan. :Chaon thanne cliuet Hagal Naut habet Is, Ar endi Sol. :Tiu, Brica, endi Man midi, Lagu the leohto, Yr al bihabet. The imo in the first line is the reading of von Arx (); it is also read as (uninterpretable) hiemo or heno or keno. The name tiu is an emendation for a gap in the text. Dickins (1916) gave the following (cursive letters marking emendations):Bruce Dickins, Runic and heroic poems of the old Teutonic peoples, 1915, p. 34. : Feu forman / Ur after / Thuris thritten stabu, / Os is himo oboro / Rat endost ritan : Chaon thanne cliu√¥t. / Hagal, Naut habet / Is, Ar endi Sol :Tiu, Brica endi Man midi / Lagu the leohto / Yr al bihabet. The text is interpreted as a simple mnemonic list of rune names, translating to something like: :\\"Feu [write] first, Ur after, Thuris the third letter, Os is following it, Rat write at the end.\\" :\\"Chaon then follows (\\"cleaves\\"), Hagal, Naut has (\\"holds\\") Is, Ar and Sol.\\" :\\"[Tiu], Brica and Man in the middle, Lago the bright, Yr concludes (\\"contains\\") the whole.\\" The text does not appear to associate any meaning with the letter names, merely describing their sequence in the futhark row. A possible exception to this is lagu which is glossed as \\"the bright\\" (lioht being an Old High German adjective meaning \\"bright, light, clear\\", or as a noun liohta \\"lamp, beacon\\").

Values close to zero (-0.1 to 0.1) generally correspond to barren areas of rock, sand, or snow. Lastly, low, positive values represent shrub and grassland (approximately 0.2 to 0.4), while high values indicate temperate and tropical rainforests (values approaching 1). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyze remote sensing measurements, often from a space platform, assessing whether or not the target being observed contains live green vegetation.

The exploration of outer space started in earnest with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. This was the first man-made satellite orbiting the Earth. Subsequent successful launches, both in the Soviet Union (e.g., the Sputnik and Cosmos programs), and in the U.S. (e.g., the Explorer program), quickly led to the design and operation of dedicated meteorological satellites. These are orbiting platforms embarking instruments specially designed to observe the Earth's atmosphere and surface with a view to improve weather forecasting. Starting in 1960, the TIROS series of satellites embarked television cameras and radiometers. This was later (1964 onwards) followed by the Nimbus satellites and the family of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instruments on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) platforms. The latter measures the reflectance of the planet in red and near-infrared bands, as well as in the thermal infrared. In parallel, NASA developed the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS), which became the precursor to the Landsat program. These early sensors had minimal spectral resolution, but tended to include bands in the red and near- infrared, which are useful to distinguish vegetation and clouds, amongst other targets. With the launch of the first ERTS satellite ‚Äì which was soon to be renamed Landsat 1 ‚Äì on July 23, 1972 with its MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS) NASA funded a number of investigations to determine its capabilities for Earth remote sensing. One of those early studies was directed toward examining the spring vegetation green-up and subsequent summer and fall dry-down (the so- called ‚Äúvernal advancement and retrogradation‚Äù) throughout the north to south expanse of the Great Plains region of the central U.S. This region covered a wide range of latitudes from the southern tip of Texas to the U.S.-Canada border, which resulted in a wide range of solar zenith angles at the time of the satellite observations. The researchers for this Great Plains study (PhD student Donald Deering and his advisor Dr. Robert Hass) found that their ability to correlate, or quantify, the biophysical characteristics of the rangeland vegetation of this region from the satellite spectral signals was confounded by these differences in solar zenith angle across this strong latitudinal gradient. With the assistance of a resident mathematician (Dr. John Schell), they studied solutions to this dilemma and subsequently developed the ratio of the difference of the red and infrared radiances over their sum as a means to adjust for or ‚Äúnormalize‚Äù the effects of the solar zenith angle. Originally, they called this ratio the ‚ÄúVegetation Index‚Äù (and another variant, the square-root transformation of the difference-sum ratio, the ‚ÄúTransformed Vegetation Index‚Äù); but as several other remote sensing researchers were identifying the simple red/infrared ratio and other spectral ratios as the ‚Äúvegetation index,‚Äù they eventually began to identify the difference/sum ratio formulation as the normalized difference vegetation index. The earliest reported use of NDVI in the Great Plains study was in 1973 by Rouse et al.Rouse, J.W, Haas, R.H., Scheel, J.A., and Deering, D.W. (1974) 'Monitoring Vegetation Systems in the Great Plains with ERTS.' Proceedings, 3rd Earth Resource Technology Satellite (ERTS) Symposium, vol. 1, p. 48-62. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740022592.pdf (Dr. John Rouse was the Director of the Remote Sensing Center of Texas A&M; University where the Great Plains study was conducted). However, they were preceded in formulating a normalized difference spectral index by Kriegler et al. in 1969.Kriegler, F.J., Malila, W.A., Nalepka, R.F., and Richardson, W. (1969) 'Preprocessing transformations and their effects on multispectral recognition.' Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment, p. 97-131. Soon after the launch of ERTS-1 (Landsat-1), Compton Tucker of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center produced a series of early scientific journal articles describing uses of the NDVI. Thus, NDVI was one of the most successful of many attempts to simply and quickly identify vegetated areas and their \\"condition,\\" and it remains the most well- known and used index to detect live green plant canopies in multispectral remote sensing data. Once the feasibility to detect vegetation had been demonstrated, users tended to also use the NDVI to quantify the photosynthetic capacity of plant canopies. This, however, can be a rather more complex undertaking if not done properly, as is discussed below. Rationale Typical PAR action spectrum, shown beside absorption spectra for chlorophyll-A, chlorophyll-B, and carotenoids Live green plants absorb solar radiation in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectral region, which they use as a source of energy in the process of photosynthesis. Leaf cells have also evolved to re-emit solar radiation in the near-infrared spectral region (which carries approximately half of the total incoming solar energy), because the photon energy at wavelengths longer than about 700 nanometers is too small to synthesize organic molecules. A strong absorption at these wavelengths would only result in overheating the plant and possibly damaging the tissues. Hence, live green plants appear relatively dark in the PAR and relatively bright in the near-infrared.Gates, David M. (1980) Biophysical Ecology, Springer-Verlag, New York, 611 p. By contrast, clouds and snow tend to be rather bright in the red (as well as other visible wavelengths) and quite dark in the near- infrared. The pigment in plant leaves, chlorophyll, strongly absorbs visible light (from 0.4 to 0.7 ¬µm) for use in photosynthesis. The cell structure of the leaves, on the other hand, strongly reflects near-infrared light (from 0.7 to 1.1 ¬µm). The more leaves a plant has, the more these wavelengths of light are affected, respectively. Since early instruments of Earth Observation, such as NASA's ERTS and NOAA's AVHRR, acquired data in visible and near-infrared, it was natural to exploit the strong differences in plant reflectance to determine their spatial distribution in these satellite images. The NDVI is calculated from these individual measurements as follows: :\\\\mbox{NDVI}=\\\\frac{(\\\\mbox{NIR}-\\\\mbox{Red})}{(\\\\mbox{NIR}+\\\\mbox{Red})} where Red and NIR stand for the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the red (visible) and near-infrared regions, respectively. These spectral reflectances are themselves ratios of the reflected over the incoming radiation in each spectral band individually, hence they take on values between 0.0 and 1.0. By design, the NDVI itself thus varies between -1.0 and +1.0. NDVI is functionally, but not linearly, equivalent to the simple infrared/red ratio (NIR/VIS). The advantage of NDVI over a simple infrared/red ratio is therefore generally limited to any possible linearity of its functional relationship with vegetation properties (e.g. biomass). The simple ratio (unlike NDVI) is always positive, which may have practical advantages, but it also has a mathematically infinite range (0 to infinity), which can be a practical disadvantage as compared to NDVI. Also in this regard, note that the VIS term in the numerator of NDVI only scales the result, thereby creating negative values. NDVI is functionally and linearly equivalent to the ratio NIR / (NIR+VIS), which ranges from 0 to 1 and is thus never negative nor limitless in range.Crippen, R.E. (1990) 'Calculating the vegetation index faster,' Remote Sensing of Environment, 34, 71-73. But the most important concept in the understanding of the NDVI algebraic formula is that, despite its name, it is a transformation of a spectral ratio (NIR/VIS), and it has no functional relationship to a spectral difference (NIR-VIS). In general, if there is much more reflected radiation in near-infrared wavelengths than in visible wavelengths, then the vegetation in that pixel is likely to be dense and may contain some type of forest. Subsequent work has shown that the NDVI is directly related to the photosynthetic capacity and hence energy absorption of plant canopies.Sellers, P. J. (1985) 'Canopy reflectance, photosynthesis, and transpiration', International Journal of Remote Sensing, 6, 1335-1372.Myneni, R. B., F. G. Hall, P.J. Sellers, and A.L. Marshak (1995) 'The interpretation of spectral vegetation indexes', IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 33, 481-486. Although the index admits to go from -1 to 1, even in more densely populated urban areas the value of normal NDVI is positive, although closer to zero. Negative values are more likely to be disturbed in the atmosphere and some specific materials. Performance and limitations The surrounding fields and water bodies like the dam to the northeast help to mask with high values in Ponta Grossa, southern Brazil It can be seen from its mathematical definition that the NDVI of an area containing a dense vegetation canopy will tend to positive values (say 0.3 to 0.8) while clouds and snow fields will be characterized by negative values of this index. Other targets on Earth visible from space include: * free standing water (e.g., oceans, seas, lakes and rivers) which have a rather low reflectance in both spectral bands (at least away from shores) and thus result in very low positive or even slightly negative NDVI values, * soils which generally exhibit a near-infrared spectral reflectance somewhat larger than the red, and thus tend to also generate rather small positive NDVI values (say 0.1 to 0.2). In addition to the simplicity of the algorithm and its capacity to broadly distinguish vegetated areas from other surface types, the NDVI also has the advantage of compressing the size of the data to be manipulated by a factor 2 (or more), since it replaces the two spectral bands by a single new field (eventually coded on 8 bits instead of the 10 or more bits of the original data). The NDVI has been widely used in applications for which it was not originally designed. Using the NDVI for quantitative assessments (as opposed to qualitative surveys as indicated above) raises a number of issues that may seriously limit the actual usefulness of this index if they are not properly addressed. The following subsections review some of these issues. * Mathematically, the sum and the difference of the two spectral channels contain the same information as the original data, but the difference alone (or the normalized difference) carries only part of the initial information. Whether the missing information is relevant or valuable is for the user to judge, but it is important to understand that an NDVI product carries only a fraction of the information available in the original spectral reflectance data. *Generated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the satellite imagesUsers of NDVI have tended to estimate a large number of vegetation properties from the value of this index. Typical examples include the Leaf Area Index, biomass, chlorophyll concentration in leaves, plant productivity, fractional vegetation cover, accumulated rainfall, etc. Such relations are often derived by correlating space-derived NDVI values with ground-measured values of these variables. This approach raises further issues related to the spatial scale associated with the measurements, as satellite sensors always measure radiation quantities for areas substantially larger than those sampled by field instruments. Furthermore, it is of course illogical to claim that all these relations hold at once, because that would imply that all of these environmental properties would be directly and unequivocally related between themselves. * The reflectance measurements should be relative to the same area and be acquired simultaneously. This may not be easy to achieve with instruments that acquire different spectral channels through different cameras or focal planes. Mis- registration of the spectral images may lead to substantial errors and unusable results. Also, the calculation of the NDVI value turns out to be sensitive to a number of perturbing factors including * Atmospheric effects: The actual composition of the atmosphere (in particular with respect to water vapor and aerosols) can significantly affect the measurements made in space. Hence, the latter may be misinterpreted if these effects are not properly taken into account (as is the case when the NDVI is calculated directly on the basis of raw measurements). * Clouds: Deep (optically thick) clouds may be quite noticeable in satellite imagery and yield characteristic NDVI values that ease their screening. However, thin clouds (such as the ubiquitous cirrus), or small clouds with typical linear dimensions smaller than the diameter of the area actually sampled by the sensors, can significantly contaminate the measurements. Similarly, cloud shadows in areas that appear clear can affect NDVI values and lead to misinterpretations. These considerations are minimized by forming composite images from daily or near- daily images.Holben, B. N. (1986)'Characteristics of Maximum-Value Composite Images from Temporal AVHRR Data', International Journal of Remote Sensing, 7(11), 1417-1434. Composite NDVI images have led to a large number of new vegetation applications where the NDVI or photosynthetic capacity varies over time. * Soil effects: Soils tend to darken when wet, so that their reflectance is a direct function of water content. If the spectral response to moistening is not exactly the same in the two spectral bands, the NDVI of an area can appear to change as a result of soil moisture changes (precipitation or evaporation) and not because of vegetation changes. * Anisotropic effects: All surfaces (whether natural or man-made) reflect light differently in different directions, and this form of anisotropy is generally spectrally dependent, even if the general tendency may be similar in these two spectral bands. As a result, the value of NDVI may depend on the particular anisotropy of the target and on the angular geometry of illumination and observation at the time of the measurements, and hence on the position of the target of interest within the swath of the instrument or the time of passage of the satellite over the site. This is particularly crucial in analyzing AVHRR data since the orbit of the NOAA platforms tended to drift in time. At the same time, the use of composite NDVI images minimizes these considerations and has led to global time series NDVI data sets spanning more than 25 years. * Spectral effects: Since each sensor has its own characteristics and performances, in particular with respect to the position, width and shape of the spectral bands, a single formula like NDVI yields different results when applied to the measurements acquired by different instruments. *Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP): NDVI is ubiquitous as an index of vegetation. Since mapping and monitoring of vegetation takes place via ‚Äòbig data‚Äô image processing systems. These systems may use pixel- or object-based algorithms to assess vegetation health, evapotranspiration, and other ecosystem functions. When a category of vegetation consists of multiple pixels, the calculation of a ‚Äòmean‚Äô can be a mean of NDVI values for each pixel (pixel-based), or a mean of the Red values and a mean of the NIR values for all the pixels in which the mean NDVI is the ratio of these (object-based). NDVI can suffer from the intractable problems that are associated with MAUP. However, A recent study demonstrated that pure vegetation pixels in an urban environment are not significantly impacted by MAUP. A number of derivatives and alternatives to NDVI have been proposed in the scientific literature to address these limitations, including the Perpendicular Vegetation Index,Richardson, A. J. and C. L. Wiegand (1977) 'Distinguishing vegetation from soil background information', Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 43, 1541-1552. the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index,Huete, A. R. (1988)'A soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)', Remote Sensing of Environment, 25, 53-70. the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation IndexKaufman, Y. J. and D. Tanre (1992) 'Atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) for EOS-MODIS', in 'Proc. IEEE Int. Geosci. and Remote Sensing Symp. '92, IEEE, New York, 261-270. and the Global Environment Monitoring Index. Each of these attempted to include intrinsic correction(s) for one or more perturbing factors. It is not until the mid-1990s, however, that a new generation of algorithms were proposed to estimate directly the biogeophysical variables of interest (e.g., the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation or FAPAR), taking advantage of the enhanced performance and characteristics of modern sensors (in particular their multispectral and multiangular capabilities) to take all the perturbing factors into account. In spite of many possible perturbing factors upon the NDVI, it remains a valuable quantitative vegetation monitoring tool when the photosynthetic capacity of the land surface needs to be studied at the appropriate spatial scale for various phenomena. Agriculture Applications Within precision agriculture, NDVI data provides a measurement of crop health. Today, this often involves agriculture drones, which are paired with NDVI to compare data and recognize crop health issues. One example of this is agriculture drones from PrecisionHawk and Sentera, which allow agriculturalists to capture and process NDVI data within one day, a change from the traditional NDVI uses and their long lag times. Many of the research done currently has proved that the NDVI images can even be obtained using the normal digital RGB cameras by some modifications in order to obtain the results similar to those obtained from the multispectral cameras and can be implemented effectively in the crop health monitoring systems.

A 44, Sol (The Sun), from the E-series The Mantegna Tarocchi, also known as the Tarocchi Cards, Tarocchi in the style of Mantegna, Baldini Cards, are two different sets each of fifty 15th-century Italian old master prints in engraving, by two different unknown artists. The sets are known as the E-series Tarocchi Cards and the S-series Tarocchi Cards (or E series, e-series etc.), and their artists are known as the ‚ÄúMaster of the E-series Tarocchi‚Äù and the ‚ÄúMaster of the S-series Tarocchi‚Äù. There are also a number of copies and later versions. Despite their name, they are educational visual aids, showing personifications of social classes or abstractions. Name a misnomer The name appears to be a mistaken confusion by later writers with the contemporary card-game of Tarocco, which includes many extra picture- cards. These are neither playing cards nor Tarot cards for fortune-telling, but were presumably educational tools for upper-class children, although no documentation of their use survives. Some sets bound up in book form at early dates survive (e.g. BNF, Paris, and Pavia), and all examples are printed on single sheets of thin paper.JA Levinson (ed), Early Italian Engravings from the National Gallery of Art, National Gallery of Art (Catalogue), 1973, LOC 7379624 Examples in Cincinnati and New York have traces of hand-colouring in gold, which is very rare in prints.M Zucker in KL Spangeberg (ed.), Six Centuries of Master Prints, Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993, no. 5, Art historians no longer believe Andrea Mantegna was the engraver of any of them, as was thought until the nineteenth century, but the name is still used, mostly as ‚Äúthe so-called Mantegna Tarocchi‚Äù. Baccio Baldini was a Florentine engraver who was also brought into consideration as a possible author in the past, hence the name also used in the past of Baldini Cards or Tarocchi. E and S series They remain important examples of Italian engraving, and are mostly owned by museums as part of their collections of old master prints. The original two sets are called the E-series and the S-series, of which the E-series is generally considered the older (since AM Hind made the case). It is on the whole the better engraved, and usually the better printed of the two. Differences between the two show the E-series Master was more aware of the literary sources for his images. Most images are reversed between the series (i.e. mirror-images). Their place and dates of creation are still debated, but Ferrara about 1465 (E-series) and 1470-5 (S-series) are considered most likely. Some of the images are copied in a manuscript dated 1467, which is believed to give a terminus ante quem for the E-series. The titles of some cards are written in a Ferraran or Venetian dialect ‚Äî ‚ÄúDoxe‚Äù for Doge or Duke, and ‚ÄúArtixan‚Äù for artisan. Some subjects were copied from playing-cards, and some from other sources in contemporary art. Other designs had to be invented. Two prints on quite different subjects have been generally attributed to the unknown ‚ÄúMaster of the E-series Tarocchi‚Äù, and one to the ‚ÄúMaster of the S-series Tarocchi‚Äù.

There is the name and number of the card in Roman numerals at the bottom, and the group capital letter and number in arabic numerals in squares in the bottom corners. All have simple decorative borders. The subjects are grouped in five sequences numbered: 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40 and 41-50, each group consisting of ten engravings: *E/S (1-10): Conditions of Man ‚Äî Hierarchy of persons, from beggar to emperor and pope: ::1 Beggar (Misero) ::2 Servant (Fameio) ::3 Craftsman (Artixan) ::4 Merchant (Merchadante) ::5 Gentleman (Zintilomo) ::6 Knight (Chavalier) ::7 Doge (Doxe) ::8 King (Re) ::9 Emperor (Imperator) ::10 Pope (Papa) *D (11-20): The nine Muses and Apollo *C (21-30): The seven Liberal arts and three other fields of study of the time: Philosophy, Poetry and Theology *B (31-40): 3 Genia of light: Genius of the Sun (Iliaco), Genius of Time (Chronico) and Genius of the world (Cosmico), and the Seven virtues *A (41-50): The seven Spheres of the Sun, Moon and five traditional planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn), the eighth sphere (Octava Spera) of the fixed stars, the Primum Mobile and Prima Causa (First Cause, God) The complete set is a humanistic model of the Renaissance cosmos.

She was the first ship named after Thomas Boyle, a privateer and naval officer during the War of 1812. Boyle was launched 15 June 1942 by Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts, sponsored by Mrs. Margaret A. Glascock, great-granddaughter of Sailing Master Boyle, and commissioned 15 August 1942, Lieutenant Commander E. S. Karpe in command. Service history Boyle joined the Atlantic Fleet and sailed from Norfolk, Virginia 25 October 1942 as part of Task Force 34 (TF 34), bound for the invasion of North Africa. She took part in the landings at Fedhala, French Morocco (8‚Äì11 November), and the skirmish with French corvettes off Casablanca (10 November). Returning to the United States 30 November she patrolled off the east coast and in the Caribbean until February 1943. Between then and 4 April 1944 Boyle made six convoy runs to North Africa and three to Ireland. On 7 February 1943, Boyle served as an escort for Convoy UGS-5 to North Africa.

The monotony of convoy duty was broken by participation in the Sicilian invasion, where she served as a guide ship for the Scoglitti landings (9‚Äì15 July 1943). After serving with a hunter-killer group off New York in April 1944, she returned to the Mediterranean Sea. She patrolled in the Gulf of Naples, Italy, during May and June, taking part in the bombardment of Formia and Anzio (13‚Äì18 May). Between 15 August and 1 September, she took part in the Invasion of southern France. Boyle returned to New York 14 September. Following a yard period at Boston, Massachusetts, she returned to the Mediterranean 21 December 1944 and remained there on fire support and escort duty until 22 April 1945. Returning to the east coast 1 May, she sailed for the Pacific Ocean 23 May, and arrived at San Diego, California, 12 June. After cruising between San Diego and Pearl Harbor (25 June‚Äì17 July 1945) she steamed to the western Pacific, arriving at Saipan 5 August. En route, Boyle took part in the bombardment of Wake Island (1 August 1945). The destroyer reached Okinawa 12 August and patrolled there until 1 September when she departed for Tokyo, Japan. She arrived off Tokyo 11 September and served in Japanese, Okinawan, and Chinese waters until departing Okinawa 1 November. She arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, 8 December 1945, and remained there until being placed out of commission in reserve 29 March 1946. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1971. She was sunk as a target on 3 May 1973 off Florida. Awards Boyle received four battle stars for her World War II service.

The River Ewe, one of the shortest in Scotland, joins the sea less than from Inverewe Garden, renowned for its subtropical plants. The village is surrounded by mountains and the sea. The village has an indoor heated swimming pool, a coffee shop, a hotel and a shop. Most of the arts events in the area take place in the village hall, as do the village markets. Origin of the name Literally the name means \\"the pool on the Ewe river\\". However, William J. Watson, in his 1904 Place Names of Ross and Cromarty, states that the village was called by the natives in his time \\"Abhainn I√π, Ewe River\\". Watson also says that he had taken \\"Ewe\\" (Gaelic iu), with hesitation, to be from Irish eo, \\"yew tree\\", though concedes that it may be a Pictish name. Climate Poolewe has a relatively warm climate for its latitude, thanks to the Gulf Stream, which creates an almost sub-tropical climate. While the winter in Poolewe is generally cold and wet, the maritime location means that it receives only a few days of snow a year. The Northern Lights are visible on occasion, depending on the weather and time of year; most often in winter. The Met Office operates a weather station at Poolewe for which 30-year averages are available. As with the rest of the British Isles and Scotland, Poolewe experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. Its low-lying situation on the west coast tends to afford it some shelter from the harshness that can afflict the adjacent Highlands during the winter months. Notable residents In August 2015, the BBC genealogy documentary series Who Do You Think You Are? revealed that Donald Mackenzie, great-great-great- grandfather of celebrity chef Paul Hollywood, had been a crofter in Poolewe.

The Dodge Charger (L-body) was a subcompact 3-door hatchback/fastback built by Dodge from 1983 to 1987, and based on Chrysler's front-wheel drive L platform. A companion model, the Plymouth Turismo, was also marketed. History For 1979, Chrysler brought out sporty versions of the L-body Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon called the Dodge Omni 024 and the Plymouth Horizon TC3. The cars shared a 1.7 L Volkswagen I4 as the only engine under the 024/TC3 name. In 1981, the Charger nameplate returned as a performance package on the Omni 024. Called the Charger 2.2, it cost $399 extra and came with a hood scoop, quarter-window appliques, special gearing, rear spoiler, and \\"Charger 2.2\\" tape graphics, as well as the new 2.2 L I4 engine that was designed and built by Chrysler. A total of 7,306 were built. In 1982, the Dodge Charger returned for a second year as the performance option for the 024. Nothing was changed from 1981 except for a Pentastar emblem on its hood and the addition of a resonator to the exhaust, since the previous model had no muffler, utilizing the catalytic converter as the sole method of engine noise reduction. Production increased to 15,000. In 1983, the Volkswagen engine went out of production, so a joint Chrysler/Peugeot 1.6 L engine was used instead. The Omni 024 was renamed the Charger. The Plymouth Turismo was introduced as a companion entry for 1983, with the TC3 designation now discontinued.1983 Car Buyer's Guide, Harris Publications Inc., page 90 Carroll Shelby developed a sporty version of the Charger later in the year, the Dodge Shelby Charger. The transformation continued in 1984, with quad headlights now differentiating the Charger from its Omni origins, however the Shelby models continued to use the previous years front nose cap/bumper assembly. The Plymouth Turismo would share the same front end. Apart from the badging, both cars were identical. For 1985, the Shelby (with its unique front end) and Charger names were shuffled to reflect the addition of a turbocharged engine. One new color was added for 1985 ‚Äî black with silver stripes. Plymouth also got a version of the old Shelby Charger, reviving the Duster name as the Plymouth Turismo Duster. However, Plymouth would never get a turbocharged version of the Shelby Charger. Two turbocharged Turismos, using the Shelby front end, were seen at Chrysler headquarters with a 'Cuda Plymouth badge, but they were not put into production. The previous high-compression Shelby Charger engine was now an option on regular Dodge Chargers. For 1986, the mandated center high-mounted stop light was added, and the 2.2 L engine made its way down to the base models. 1987 was the last year for the Omni/Horizon-derived Charger and Turismo. A total of 2,011 Chargers with the hotter Turbo II engine were now badged the Shelby Charger Turbo (not \\"Dodge\\"). For 1987, they were replaced by the Dodge Shadow/Plymouth Sundance, and the Belvidere plant was retooled to build the Dodge Dynasty, which succeeded the preceding 600 at the time. Carroll Shelby bought 1,000 of the last Chargers and equipped them with the Omni GLH's engine and suspension to be sold under this name. The Duster name was revived for a model in the Plymouth Sundance line midyear in 1992. File:'85 Dodge Charger (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg1985 Dodge Charger File:PlymouthTurismo.jpg1986/87 Plymouth Turismo Dodge Shelby Charger 1987 Charger Shelby Edition For 1983, Carroll Shelby modified the Dodge Charger, to be sold at Dodge dealers as the Dodge Shelby Charger. Rather than focusing on speed, Shelby modified the suspension and styling. The engine compression was raised for , and the manual transmission had revised ratios. Shorter springs, special wheels, and tires complemented stronger brakes and a quicker, 14:1, power steering rack. Outside, a new nose and racing stripes accented the performance image. The car received a free-flowing exhaust system, making for a more aggressive sound. The body kits, among other parts, were often shipped to dealerships along with the car to be put on after delivery. The reasoning behind this varied, but was said to speed delivery and compensate for ground clearance issues that the cars faced on many car carriers. Production was 8,251 for that first year. Rear view of the 1982 Dodge Shelby Charger prototype, mostly indistinguishable from production cars For 1984, the Shelby Charger could be ordered with an optional automatic transmission. There were 7,552 Shelby Chargers sold this model year. The high- output engine (now up to ) was also available in baseline Chargers and Turismos. These vehicles came in \\"Charger 2.2\\" and \\"Turismo 2.2\\" schemes, which included Shelby Charger side ground effects, an additional, skinnier, front ground effect (different from the Shelby Charger's due to the quad- headlight fascia), \\"2.2\\" decals, and an optional hood scoop. The MPFI/Turbocharged Turbo I engine, commonly known as a 'T1' was added for Dodge's 1985 Shelby Charger. This engine produced and was changed from its first appearance in the Dodge Daytona Turbo during the previous year. A Garrett AiResearch T3 turbocharger and Chrysler/Bosch multiple-point fuel injection enabled the 2.2 L engine to produce the additional horsepower.Dodge Charger (four-cylinder), Turismo, Plymouth Horizon TC3, and Dodge Omni O24 A total of 7,709 Shelby Chargers were made for the 1985 model year, and 7,669 in 1986. 1987 was the final year, with just 1,011 produced, plus 1,000 more Shelby Chargers that were sent to Shelby's Whittier Plant in CA, at which time they were modified as the 1987 Shelby GLHS. Dodge Shelby Chargers were available in four different color combinations: Black w/silver skunk stripe (1985‚Äì87), Santa Fe Blue w/silver skunk stripe (1983‚Äì86), Silver w/Santa Fe Blue skunk stripe (1983‚Äì86), and Garnett Red w/silver skunk stripe (1984‚Äì87). Charger GLHS 1987 Shelby GLHS Carroll Shelby purchased 1,000 of the last Dodge Shelby Chargers and converted them into GLHSs in his facility at Whittier, California. Every vehicle was built and optioned the same way. All were finished in black and had special badging that marked them as Shelby, not as a Dodge. This was a continuation of the Omni GLHS from the previous year. Shelby used the Turbo I engine updated with the intercooler and plumbing of the Turbo II engine, but without the stronger forged crank, full-floating pin pistons and other durability enhancements of that engine. It has a blow- through long runner two-piece intake and a modified turbocharger, reclocked with a different compressor cover. They were rated at and of torque from 2400 to 4800 rpm. The Turbo II also received a stronger Getrag A555 five-speed manual transmission in place of the rod linkage A525, which was still fitted to the GLHS models. The suspension was upgraded with Koni adjustable struts/shocks and uprated Goodyear Eagle GT Z-rated tires. The Centurion 2 wheels were of Shelby's own manufacture. A special sticker on the speedometer upped the readout to . A special numbered Shelby Automotive badge went in place of the normal Charger badge. The modifications prompted the federal government to declare the car a Shelby model. A Dodge badge appears nowhere on the car, unlike its five-door L-body sibling, the GLH Omni, which does have the Dodge nameplate.

Up to two players control a starship that must destroy the alien race \\"Doom\\" before they destroy the planet Gradius; player one controls the Vic Viper from Gradius, while player two controls a new ship named the Super Cobra, named after an older Konami arcade game of the same name. Gameplay involves shooting down incoming enemies in each stage while avoiding collision with either them, their projectiles, or the level terrain. There are six stages total; four of them are side-scrolling, while two are vertical-scrolling from an overhead view. Some enemies drop power-up items when collected, which will grant either player with unique weapons and abilities; these include a forcefield, a circling \\"ripple laser\\", missiles, and small orbs known as \\"Options\\" that follow the player and fight alongside them. New to this game are \\"Option Seeds\\", miniature Options that circle the player and provide additional firepower. Players can also launch their Options towards enemies to create powerful, homing beam-like shots. After completing the game, it will repeat, or \\"loop\\", itself indefinitely, gradually becoming harder. Development and release Salamander 2 was released in Japan by Konami in January 1996. It is part of Konami's Salamander series, which itself is a spin-off of their Gradius series. The game was developed for the Konami GX Type 2 arcade system, which also powered games such as TwinBee Yahho! and Sexy Parodius. Mariko Tokida worked on the game's character designs and artwork, and was mostly in charge of its graphics; she recalled having difficulty with handling complex animations and the large color palette, namely with the Brain Golem boss and the asteroids in the fifth stage. She also had issues with designing smaller enemies within a 16x16 size limit. The music for Salamander 2 was composed by Naoki Maeda, known for his work on the Dance Dance Revolution series. In 1997, Salamander 2 was ported to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in Japan as part of Salamander Deluxe Pack Plus, alongside ports of the original Salamander and Life Force. In 2007, it was compiled into the Japan-exclusive PlayStation Portable compilation Salamander Portable, being bundled with the original Salamander, Life Force, Xexex, and a remake of the MSX game Gradius 2, which features updated graphics and improved scrolling. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Salamander 2 on their March 1, 1996 issue as being the sixth most-successful arcade game of the year. The game was often criticized for its inferiority to the original, with fans feeling it lacked the \\"impressiveness\\" as Konami's other arcade and console shooters of the time. Japanese video game publication Game Criticism was mostly mixed towards the game, finding it to be largely inferior to its predecessor. They criticized the game for its lack of innovation, uninteresting weapon selection and off-putting graphics, specifically for their discoloration and dark tone in contrast to the bright colors the original Salamander used. By contrast, Edge believed that Salamander 2 would help mark the return of more \\"hardcore\\" shoot'em up players into arcades with its challenge and graphical style. Home releases of Salamander 2 received a noticeably better reception. In his review of Salamander Deluxe Pack Plus, Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine praised Salamander 2 for its gameplay and visuals. They also applauded the game's callbacks to the original Salamander and Life Force games and its weapons for being useful and fun to use. Authors for GameFan magazine applauded the game for its graphics, gameplay and soundtrack; one said that the game \\"hearkens back to the glory days\\" of the company, and found it refreshing compared to the wave of TwinBee and Parodius games that Konami had been releasing prior. Edge greatly praised its \\"lavishly detailed\\" visuals, but criticized the game for its high-difficulty and short length, writing that it was \\"a game which fails to offer the finely tuned balance between success and failure on which the gaming experience depends.\\" In a 2010 retrospective review, Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 felt that the game lacked the innovation that Konami's other shoot'em up games at the time possessed, but said that the combination of pre-rendered and hand-drawn graphics helped give it a unique look. Kalata praised the \\"spectacular\\" soundtrack, declaring it \\"the only noteworthy aspect of the game\\". Retro Gamer writer Mike Bevan said that the numerous tweaks to the core gameplay made Salamander 2 gameplay fresh, and praised the game's challenge and anime-like aesthetic with its graphics.

Origin 1965 Dodge Charger II Show Car During the early-1960s, automakers were exploring new ideas in the personal luxury and specialty car segments. Chrysler, fast to enter the specialty car market, selected their Dodge Division to enter the marketplace with a mid-size B-bodied sporty car to fit between the \\"pony car\\" Ford Mustang and \\"personal luxury\\" Ford Thunderbird. The intention was to create a fastback look while sharing as much existing company hardware as possible. The Coronet-based Charger that resulted\\" was introduced in mid- season of the 1966 model year \\"in retaliation to the Rambler Marlin, Ford Mustang, and Plymouth Barracuda\\". Style-wise it was \\"a complete departure from the Dodge's mainstream cars.\\" The 1965 Marlin, along with the Charger that arrived during the 1966 model year, were \\"the two cars set the standard for radical fastback design in American mid-size automobiles.\\" According to Richard M. Langworth, \\"because it was an intermediate like the Rambler Marlin, the Charger could have been an aesthetic disaster, but long side windows prevented its sweeping roof from looking too heavy.\\" Burt Bouwkamp, Chief Engineer for Dodge during the 1960s and one of the men behind the Dodge Charger, related his experience during a speech in July 2004. > Lynn Townsend was at odds with the Dodge Dealers and wanted to do something > to please them. So in 1965 he asked me to come to his office - for the > second time. He noted that one of the Dodge Dealer Council requests was for > a Barracuda type vehicle. The overall dealer product recommendation theme > was the same - we want what Plymouth has. The specific request for a Mustang > type vehicle was not as controversial to Lynn. His direction to me was to > give them a specialty car but he said 'for God's sake don't make it a > derivative of the Barracuda': i.e. don't make it a Barracuda competitor. So > the 1966 Charger was born. \\"We built a Charger 'idea' car which we displayed > at auto shows in 1965 to stimulate market interest in the concept. It was > the approved design but we told the press and auto show attendees that it > was just an \\"idea\\" and that we would build it if they liked it. It was pre- > ordained that they would like it.\\" First generation=1966 The Charger made its debut in mid-1966. Sharing its chassis and front-end sheet-metal with the mid-sized Coronet, the Charger \\"still looked a lot like a Coronet or AMC‚Äôs conceptually similar Rambler Marlin ... [and] substantially more expensive than either. The Charger with a $3,100 base price \\"was immediately paired up in the automotive press with American Motors' year-old Marlin, another fastback specialty machine that came in at around $2,850\\" and some called the Charger \\"a good-looking Marlin.\\" The Charger's interior was different from all other cars with its pseudo- bucket back seats folded down to interior space accessible via the rear hatch. \\"The Charger didn't begin with the performance/ muscle car image, though you could get a Hemi with it.\\" The Charger evolved into possibly the top Chrysler- made muscle car. On January 1, 1966, viewers of the Rose Bowl were first introduced to the new \\"Leader of the Dodge Rebellion\\", the 1966 Charger. The Charger's debut also followed by a half model year the introduction of a new street version of the Chrysler Hemi engine. With the Charger, Dodge had a new model to build a performance image to go along with this engine. Designed by Carl \\"CAM\\" Cameron, the Charger introduced a fastback roofline and pot-metal \\"electric shaver\\" grille, complete with fully rotating headlights, a feature not seen on a Chrysler product since the 1942 DeSoto. In the rear the fastback design ended over a full-width six-lamp taillight with chromed \\"CHARGER\\" lettering. 1966 Charger instrument panel Inside, the standard Charger featured a simulated wood-grain steering wheel, four individual bucket seats with a full length console from front to rear. The rear seats and rear center armrest pad also folded forward while the trunk divider dropped back, which allowed for generous cargo room. Numerous interior features were exclusive to the Charger including door panels, courtesy lights, as well as premium trim and vinyl upholstery. The instrument panel did not use regular bulbs to light the gauges, but rather electroluminescence lit the four chrome-ringed circular dash pods, needles, radio, shifter-position indicator in the console, as well as clock and air conditioning controls if equipped. The dash housed a 0 to 6000 rpm tachometer, a 0 to speedometer, as well as alternator, fuel, and temperature gauges as standard equipment. Engine selections consisted of only V8s. 1966 transmissions included a three-speed steering-column mounted manual with the base engine, a console mounted four-speed manual, or three-speed automatic. In 1966, four engines were offered: the base-model 2-barrel, the 2-barrel, the 4-barrel, and the new 426 Street Hemi. Only 468 Chargers were built with the 426. Total production in 1966 came to 37,344 units for the mid- model year introduction. 1967 Charger NASCAR Spoiler In 1966, Dodge took the Charger into NASCAR in hopes that the fastback would make their car a winner on the high-banks. However the car proved difficult to handle on the faster tracks because its body generated lift. Drivers would later claim that \\"it was like driving on ice.\\" To solve this problem Dodge installed a small lip spoiler on the trunk lid that improved traction at speeds above . This was made a dealer-installed option in late-1966 and in 1967 because of NASCAR rules, making the '66 Charger the first U.S. production vehicle to offer a spoiler. (Small quarter panel extensions were added in 1967.) The addition of the spoiler helped David Pearson, driving the #6 Cotton Owens-prepared Dodge cars, to win the NASCAR Grand National championship in 1966 with 15 first- place finishes, though only one, the Capital City 300 in Richmond, VA, was achieved using the Chargerhttps://www.racing-reference.info/season- stats/1966/W/ 1967 1967 Dodge Charger The 1967 model year Charger received minor changes. Outside, new fender-mounted turn signals were introduced and this would serve as the main external identifier between a 1966 and 1967 Charger. A vinyl roof became available. Inside, the full length console was eliminated to satisfy customer complaints about the difficulty for entry and exit from the back seats. It was replaced with a regular sized console. Bucket seats were standard, but a folding armrest/seat and column shifter was an option allowing three people to sit up front. The 440 \\"Magnum\\" was added and the V8 was replaced by a engine. The 440 was rated at with a single 4-barrel carburetor. The 318 two-barrel \\"LA\\" Chrysler LA engine was now the base engine with wedge-shaped combustion chambers, unlike the previous 1966 polyspherical (or \\"poly\\") design, it was rated at . The 383 4-barrel rated at and the 426 Street Hemi rated at remained as options. A mere 118 Chargers were built with the 426 engines in 1967, 58 cars were built with a four speed transmission and 59 cars were built with the automatic transmission. Sales of the 1967 Chargers dropped to half of the previous introductory half-year with a total of 15,788 units. According to automotive historian Patrick Foster, both the AMC Marlin and the very similar looking first generation Dodge Charger \\"flopped on the market as sporty car buyers were showing their preference for compact pony cars.\\" Second generation=1968 1968 black Dodge Charger The entire B-body lineup for the 1968 model year was redesigned and the Charger was further differentiated from the Dodge Coronet models. The first generation's efforts to look somewhat posh were abandoned in favor of designer Richard Sias' double-diamond coke bottle profile, with curves around the front fenders and rear quarter panels. Front and rear end sheet metal was designed by Harvey J. Winn. The rear end featured a \\"kick up\\" spoiler appearance, inspired by Group 7 racing vehicles. The fastback roof was gone, in favor of a \\"flying buttress\\" similar to that of the 1966-67 Pontiac GTO. The Charger retained its full-width hidden headlight grille, but a vacuum operated cover replaced the electric motor rotating headlights. The previous full-width taillights were replaced with dual circular units at the direction of Styling Vice President, Elwood P. Engel. Dual scallops were added to the doors and hood. Inside, numerous \\"downscalings\\" were evident. A conventional fixed rear bench seat replaced the folding bucket seat design. The conventional trunk area included a vinyl mat, rather than the previous model's carpeted cargo area. The center console in the front remained, but there was no center armrest. The tachometer was now optional instead of standard and the electroluminescent gauges disappeared in favor of a conventional design. Even the model's engine options ended up reduced midyear, when the standard 2-bbl V8, was replaced with Chrysler's basic slant-six. The 383-2 and 383-4 remained unchanged. ;R/T 1968 Dodge Charger R/T A new high-performance package was added, the R/T (\\"Road/Track\\", with no 'and' between the two, as in the then highly influential, muscle car promoting Road & Track magazine). The R/T came standard with the previous year's 440 \\"Magnum\\", with the 426 Hemi optional. In 1968, Chrysler Corporation began an ad campaign featuring a cartoon bee with an engine on its back promoting models called the \\"Scat Pack\\". The Coronet R/T, Super Bee, Dart GTS, and Charger R/T received bumble-bee stripes (of two thin stripes framing two thick ones). The stripes were standard on the R/Ts and came in red, white, or black, but could be deleted at no extra cost. The 1968 film Bullitt helped popularize the Charger R/T for its notable car chase sequence alongside the titular character's 1968 Ford Mustang GT through the streets of San Francisco, which has been regarded as one of the most influential car chase scenes in movie history. In the film, a black Dodge Charger R/T 440 is chased by Steve McQueen's Ford Mustang GT, jumping on the San Francisco slopes. The 1968 model year Charger sales increased to 96,100, including over 17,000 Charger R/Ts. 1969 1969 Dodge Charger The 1969 model year brought few modifications. Exterior changes included a new grille with a center divider and new longitudinal taillights, both designed by Harvey J. Winn. A new trim line called the Special Edition (SE) was added. This could be available by itself or together with the R/T, thus making an R/T-SE. The SE added leather inserts to the front seats only, chrome rocker moldings, a wood grain steering wheel, and wood grain inserts on the instrument panel. A sunroof was added to the option list, but was ordered on only 260 Chargers. The bumble bee stripes returned as well, but were changed slightly. Instead of four stripes, it now consisted of a wide stripe framed by two smaller stripes. In the middle of the stripe, an R/T cutout was placed. If the stripe was deleted, a metal R/T emblem was placed where the R/T cutout was. Total production was around 89,199 units. There were two different 383 engines available for the 1969 model year: 2-barrel and 4-barrel. The 2-barrel was rated at 290 hp. The four barrel engine was rated at 330 hp and was identified on the air cleaner as \\"383 / FOUR BARREL\\". The 330-hp engine was unique to the Charger model in 1969. While this engine was available with an un-silenced air cleaner option, it differed internally from the 335-hp 383 \\"Magnum\\". Differences between the 330-hp 383 4-barrel and 335-hp 383 magnum were mostly internal. Both versions used the Carter AVS carb and the larger exhaust manifolds from the 440 Magnum engines, but the Magnum had a windage tray in the oil pan, a different camshaft profile, and different valve springs. In 1969 the B-series engines were all painted Chrysler Engine Turquoise with the exception of the 4-barrel 383 four speed and 440 Magnum engines which were painted Chrysler \\"High-Performance Orange\\". As usual, the 426 Hemi was painted \\"Street Hemi Orange\\". The 383 Magnum motor was used in Road Runners and Super Bees, but did not appear in a Charger body until 1971. Bo & Luke Duke popularized the 1969 Dodge Charger in The Dukes of Hazzard The television series The Dukes of Hazzard (1979‚Äì1985) featured an orange 1969 Dodge Charger that was named The General Lee. \\"The General\\" sported the Confederate battle flag painted on the roof and the words \\"GENERAL LEE\\" over each door. The windows were always open, as the doors were supposedly welded shut for racing, and the actors would do a window slide to get in and out. The number \\"01\\" is painted on both doors. Also, when the horn button was pressed, it played the first 12 notes from the de facto Confederate States anthem \\"Dixie\\". The car performed spectacular jumps in almost every episode, and the show's popularity produced consumer interest in the car. =Charger 500= Dodge Charger 500 In 1968, the NASCAR inspired Charger R/T failed to beat the Ford cars (the Ford Torino Talladega and the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II) on the high-banks oval-tracks. Wind tunnel tests showed the tunneled rear window caused lift and the gaping mouth induced drag. As a result, Dodge made the rear window flush with the rest of the roof and put a 1968 Coronet grille in the front. The original Charger 500 prototype was a 1968 Charger R/T with a 426 Hemi and automatic transmission. The prototype was painted in B5 Blue with a white stripe, as well as a white interior. The Charger 500 was one of three models introduced in September 1968. Standard engine was the 440 Magnum, but factory literature claims the 426 Hemi was standard. The Charger 500 had the Torqueflite standard and the same equipment standard as the R/T. A total of 392 Charger 500s were made, of which only 67 had the 426 Hemi engine; 27 with a 4-speed and 40 with an automatic transmission. =Charger Daytona= Dodge Charger Daytona Dodge was not satisfied with the results of the Charger 500. The car was not enough to beat the other aerocars on the NASCAR circuit. After months of research and development, including at the aftermarket shop, Creative Industries, the Dodge Charger Daytona was introduced on April 13, 1969. It quickly received over 1,000 orders. Chrysler made many attempts at improving the aerodynamics of the 500 by adding noses rumored to be up to long. The Charger Daytona finally received an nose. The full size Charger Daytona was tested with an nose at the Lockheed-Martin Georgia facility. The test was a success and the project was greenlighted. The nose piece was only part of the innovation. The Charger Daytona also received a tall wing in rear. This wing was bolted through the rear quarter panels and into the rear subframe. Although proven to be less effective than shorter wing designs, the engineer responsible for the development of the wing, John Pointer, chose the tall design so the wing would be in \\"clean air\\" to help increase the car's overall speed. That the tall wing prevents interference with operation of the trunk lid can be considered a fortunate coincidence. The tall wing also helped out in another unintended way, by giving the car directional stability due to its deeply splinted sides. The Charger Daytona engineering model was tested on the Chelsea, Michigan Chrysler Proving Grounds on July 20, 1969. Driven by Charlie Glotzbach and Buddy Baker, it was clocked at with a small 4-bbl. carb. The Charger Daytona's nose made 1,200 pounds of downforce and the wing made 600 pounds of downforce. The Dodge styling department wanted to make changes to the Charger Daytona as soon as they saw it, but was told by Bob McCurry to back off; he wanted function over finesse. The Charger Daytona introduced to the public had a fiberglass nose without real headlamps and a wing without streamlined fairings. The media and public loved the car, but were mystified by the reverse scoops on the front fenders. The PR representatives claimed it was for tire clearance. Actually, they reduced drag 3%. The Charger Daytona came standard with the 440 Magnum Engine with and of torque, A727 Torqueflite Automatic Transmission, and a 3.23 489 Case 8 3/4 Chrysler Differential. Optional was the 426 Hemi with and . The 426 Hemi was also available with the no cost option of the A833 4-Speed Manual. Only 503 Charger Daytona's were produced as U.S. cars. (An additional 40 were for Canada), Of the 503 U.S. cars produced, 433 were 440 Magnum, 139 4-Speed and 294 Torqueflite; 70 were 426 Hemi power, 22 4-Speed and 48 Torqueflite. In the end, the Daytona was brought down by the decision to make the 1970 Plymouth Superbird the only Chrysler winged car for the model year. While Daytonas were raced through the 1970 season, only one Daytona was raced until 1971 (in the 1971 Daytona 500) when NASCAR decreed that engine displacement of wing cars would be limited to . That particular car, driven by Dick Brooks, finished in seventh place. The very first 1969 Charger Daytona was a hand build by the Chrysler engineers and was on display at the 1969 World fair in New York. After the fair ended the car went via a Dodge dealer lottery to a Dodge dealer in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. This is documented by Chrysler. 1970 1970 Dodge Charger The Charger was changed slightly for the 1970 model year. This was the last year of the 2nd generation Charger and featured a large wraparound chrome bumper and the grille was no longer divided in the middle. New electric headlight doors replaced the old vacuum style. The taillights were similar to those used in 69, but 500 and R/T models came with a new more attractive taillight panel. On the R/T, new rear-facing scoops with the R/T logo were mounted on the front doors, over the door scallops. A new 440 or HEMI hood cutout made the option list for this year only. Dodge painted the hood scallop inserts black and put the silver engine callouts on top. New \\"High Impact\\" colors were given names, such as Top Banana, Panther Pink, Interior changes included new high-back bucket seats, the door panels were also revised and the map pockets were now optional instead of standard. The ignition was moved from the dash to the steering column (as with all Chrysler products this year), and the glove box was now hinged at the bottom instead of the top as in 1968-69. The SE \\"Special Edition\\" trim option added luxury features and was available in as the 500 SE and R/T SE models. The all new pistol grip shifter was introduced, along with a bench front seat, a first for the Charger since its debut. A new engine option made the Charger's list for the first time, the 440 Six Pack. With three two-barrel carburetors and a rating of , it was one of the most exotic setups since the cross-ram Max Wedge engines of the early 1960s. The Six Pack was previously used on the mid-year 1969 Dodge Super Bee and Plymouth Road Runner. Despite this new engine, production slipped again to 46,576 mainly due to the new E-body Dodge Challenger pony car, as well as rapidly increasing automobile insurance rates. In the 1970 NASCAR season, the 1970 Charger had ten wins, more than any other car, including the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytonas and Plymouth Superbirds, thus giving Bobby Isaac the Grand National Championship. Buddy Baker, driving the blue #88 Engineering Daytona, was the first and only legal car to run over 200 mph in 1970. That record lasted for over 13 years. Third generation=1971 1971 Dodge Charger Super Bee The 1971 model year introduced the third generation Charger, characterized by a new split grille and more rounded \\"fuselage\\" bodystyle. The interiors were like those of the E-body and were now shared by the Plymouth B-body, the Plymouth Satellite Sebring and Road Runner. The hidden headlights were now optional. A rear spoiler and a \\"Ramcharger\\" hood were new options. This hood featured a pop-up scoop mounted above the air cleaner controlled by a vacuum switch under the dash. On Plymouth Road Runners it was called the \\"Air Grabber\\" hood, and it was previously used on the Coronet R/T and Super Bee. Dodge also merged its Coronet and Charger lines. From 1971, all four-door B-bodies were badged as Coronets and all two-door B-bodies as Chargers. Thus for one year only, the Super Bee became part of the Charger lineup, after which it was discontinued. From 1971 to 1974, Charger models used the Coronet's VIN prefix of \\"W\\". Several other models were carried over from 1970, including the 500, R/T, and SE. Sales of the R/T declined due in part to higher insurance costs and gasoline prices. A total of 63 Hemi RTs were built that year, marking its last appearance in any production car, and 2,659 with other engines. The 1971 model year was also the last for the 440 Six-Pack engine, which could still be mated to a Hurst 4-speed transmission, as well as the automatic. In the Super Bee's final year, the 340 became a $44 option over the standard, low-compression 383 . The \\"Hi-Impact\\" colors were discontinued after the 1971 model year; with a 1971-only \\"Citron Yella\\". 1972 1972 Dodge ChargerThe 1972 Charger introduced a new \\"Rallye\\" option to replace the R/T version. The SE was differentiated from other 1972 Chargers by a unique formal roof treatment and hidden headlights. The 383 engine was replaced with a lower compression 4-barrel 400, while the 440 engine was still available, with lowered compression and downrated to net instead of the previous gross. The ratings went down as the net horsepower measure was more realistic. Also beginning in 1972, all engines featured hardened valve seats to permit the use of regular leaded or unleaded gasoline rather than leaded premium fuel as in past years due to tighter emissions regulations. Though the 440+6 (designating a triple 2-barrel carb setup and was listed in the early 1972 sales literature, it was found in the August 1971 testing that this engine would not meet the new and more stringent 1972 emissions laws, although some early Dodge literature (August 1971 press) stated that this engine was available for 1972, and a few (six is the accepted number) factory installed six-pack Chargers were built, the engine was dropped out of production by September 1971. The optional Pistol-Grip 4-speed Hurst manual shifter could be coupled to the 340, 400, and 440 Magnum engines. The Ramcharger hood scoop was discontinued, as well as optional lower geared performance rear axle ratios and extra heavy duty suspensions. It was also the final year for the Dana 60 differential, and was available only in combination with the 440/4 speed, heavy duty suspension, and the 3.54:1 rear axle ratio. The only remaining \\"Hi-Impact\\" color choices were \\"Hemi Orange\\" (EV2) and \\"Top Banana\\" (FY1), the latter was available under different names through 1974. 1973 1973 Dodge Charger Rallye 400 Unusual triple quarter window on 1973 Dodge Charger SE For the 1973 model year, Chargers received new sheet metal (though at first glance only the rear roof \\"C-Pillars\\" looked different) and were in fact longer, wider, and slightly taller than the 1971-72 cars. Also new were vertically slatted taillights and new grilles. Hidden headlights were dropped, even as an option. The 318 was still standard, with the 340 (available only on the Rallye), 360 (2-barrel only), 400 (low power 2-barrel/single exhaust and high performance 4-barrel/dual exhaust) and 440 remaining as options. The SE models had a new roof treatment that had a \\"triple opera window\\" surrounded by a canopy-style vinyl roof. All other models had a new quarter window treatment, discontinuing its AMC Gremlin-style window in favor of a more conventional design. Total sales this year were around 108,000 units, the highest ever for the 1971-74 Charger generation, though more than 60 percent of the cars had the non-high performance engines. The 1973 Chargers, and all Chrysler products, were equipped with 5 mph bumpers, front and rear. 1974 1974 Dodge Charger The 1974 model year saw only minor changes that included new color choices, a softer grain pattern on interior surfaces, and a slight increase in the size of the rubber bumper tips. The 340 option was replaced with a 360 4-bbl as the small block performance engine. All other engine options remained the same, including the 360 2-bbl designated by a K in the fifth symbol in the vehicle identification number. Several performance rear end ratios, including a 3.23 \\"Sure Grip\\" rear end were still available. A four speed transmission was still an option except with the 440 engine. In spite of the Charger no longer being perceived as a performance model sales rose as it veered towards being a personal luxury car. The muscle car era came to a close, with 1974 as the final year for performance options. NASCAR The 1971-74 Charger based cars were campaigned in NASCAR, with Buddy Baker, Bobby Isaac, Dave Marcis, and Richard Petty scoring several wins. Richard Petty won 35 races with this body style between 1972 and 1977 as NASCAR allowed the Chargers to run a few years longer than normal, as Chrysler did not have anything else to replace it. A 1974 bodied Charger driven by Neil Bonnett scored Dodge's last NASCAR victory (until 2001) at the December 1977 Los Angeles Times 500. Richard Petty has proclaimed this body style as his favorite car that he ran during his career because it was balanced. Fourth generation=1975 Dodge Charger The 1975 model year had the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba share the same new body based on the B platform. The Chrysler Cordoba had replaced the Plymouth Satellite Sebring. The Charger SE (Special Edition) was the only model offered. It came with a wide variety engines from the \\"LA\\" series small block V8 to three versions of big block V8. The standard engine was the 2-bbl small block, along with the code E58 4-bbl and dual exhaust high performance version (225 hp) being available as an option. Sales in 1975 amounted to 30,812. Because of the extreme squareness of the bodystyle, NASCAR teams were forced to rely on the previous years (1974) sheet metal for race-spec cars. In order for Dodge to be represented, NASCAR allowed the 1974 sheet metal to be used until January 1978, when the new Dodge Magnum was ready for race use. In 1976 a Dodge Charger was one of two NASCAR stock cars to compete in the 24hrs at LeMans, having been modified with head-lamps, tail-lamps and windshield wipers. It was driven by Herschel and Doug McGriff and sponsored by Olympia Beer, earning the nickname \\"Oly Express\\" 1976 The 1976 model year Charger range was expanded to four models; base, Charger Sport (formerly the Dodge Coronet 2-door model, which appeared for just the previous model year only), Charger SE and the Charger Daytona. The base and Sport models used a different body than the SE and Daytona, and were essentially a re-badging of what had been the 1975 Dodge Coronet 2-door models ‚Äî and available with a Slant Six, which was not offered on the SE and Daytona. The Charger Daytona was introduced as an appearance package with either the 360 or 400 engine. Sales increased slightly to 65,900 units in 1976. 1977 In 1977, the Charger Sport (which dated back to the former Coronet 2-door, which had appeared for just the 1975 model year only) and the base Charger were dropped as this body style became part of the newly named B-body Monaco line, and only the Charger SE and Charger Daytona were offered. Estimated production was 30,367 units. 1978 In 1978, its final year as a B-Body, only 2,735 Chargers were produced. The Magnum replaced the Charger as Dodge's B-body personal luxury car this year, and the small number of Chargers produced were likely an effort to use up leftover 1977 bodies and parts.

It was also propounded by the chemist Wilhelm Ostwald.Simon Blackburn. Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Third Ed. (2016). Energeticism is largely rejected today, in part due to its Aristotelian and metaphysical leanings and its rejection of the existence of a micro-world (such as the one that chemists or physicists have discovered).

Study in Japan Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ went in secret to Japan at the end of 1905, leaving a pregnant wife and two young sons in Indochina. He attended a military academy in the Kanda district of Tokyo, followed by Waseda University, where he learned to speak perfect, accentless Japanese. He also married a Japanese woman. While in Japan, he supported and became the figurehead for the Phong Trao Dong Du (\\"On the Way to the East\\" movement), led by the revolutionary Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u in support of Indochinese independence from France. The organization was encouraged by the victory of Japan over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, and received financial support from Sun Yat-sen, Liang Qichao as well as Inukai Tsuyoshi and Kashiwabara Buntaro. Between 1905 and 1910, it sponsored some 200 Vietnamese to study in Japan. However, after the Franco-Japanese Treaty of 1907, French colonial authorities applied diplomatic pressure against Japan to suppress the organization and many of its members were deported by 1910. Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ made a trip to Siam from November 1908-March 1909, returning to Japan in May 1909. However, his presence in Japan was reported by the French government to the Japanese, who issued a warrant for his arrest. He hid until September, at one point escaping out a hotel window in Kobe as the police came in through the door. However, he was finally deported to Shanghai at the end of October. Interwar period Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ then went to Beijing, where the Chinese warlord Duan Qirui offered financial support if he would start an uprising against the French in Indochina as leader of the 1911 Vietnam Restoration Organisation (Vi·ªát Nam Quang Ph·ª•c H·ªôi). He traveled to Hong Kong and then to Bangkok in 1911, but was apprehended by Siamese authorities and deported back to China. He then traveled via Singapore to Europe, visiting Berlin and London. However, in 1913, he was sentenced to death in absentia as the French started to suppress pro-independence agitation more harshly. Returning to Japan, Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ found help from the Pan- Asian movement, including T≈çyama Mitsuru and was given a monthly allowance by his old friend Inukai Tsuyoshi. However, he was devastated by the news of the arrest of Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u in Shanghai in 1925, followed by the assassination of Inukai in 1932. Prince C∆∞·ªùng founded the Phuc Quoc (Vi·ªát Nam Ph·ª•c qu·ªëc ƒê·ªìng minh H·ªôi, \\"League for the Restoration of Vietnam\\") in 1938, which also had an armed wing, as a monarchist alternative to the Viet Minh (Vi·ªát Nam ƒê·ªôc l·∫≠p ƒê·ªìng minh H·ªôi, \\"League for the Independence of Vietnam\\") movement created by Ho Chi Minh. He approached the Japanese military, hoping to be restored to the throne in Vietnam as Puyi had been restored to the throne in Manchukuo. Under Japanese rule Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ lived in Taiwan from 1939 to May 1940, where he produced a daily four-hour radio show. Later that year, the Japanese invasion of French Indochina occurred, but left the Vichy French colonial administration intact in order to maintain stable conditions to obtain essential war materials. However, Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ remained loyal to the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and made contact with leaders of the Cao ƒê√†i movement who were interested in a monarchy led by Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ. Following the collapse of the Vichy French government, the Japanese staged a coup de main, creating the independent Empire of Vietnam. Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ brought forth a five-member provisional government, which was sponsored by the IJA 38th Army; however, Tokyo made the surprising decision to retain Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i as nominal head of state, and Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ's efforts to return as ruler of Vietnam were frustrated. Final years Following the end of World War II, Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ became a Japanese citizen, taking the name of Masao Ando. He gave a press conference in August 1949, vowing to return to Vietnam to oppose B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, should B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i sign agreements granting France colonial rights in Vietnam again. However, as a Japanese subject, he was not permitted a Vietnamese passport. His attempts to return to Vietnam via Thailand and via Hong Kong disguised as a Chinese with a fake passport were foiled in 1950. Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ died of cancer in 1951 at the Nippon Medical School Hospital in Tokyo.

Laid down by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, 20 December 1889, she was launched 28 April 1891, sponsored by Miss Kate C. Gunn. She was commissioned 13 February 1893, with Captain Lewis Kempff in command. Assigned to the Pacific Squadron for harbor defense, the Monterey operated out of Mare Island Navy Yard, making numerous voyages to ports on the West Coast on maneuvers and target practice during her first 5 years of naval service. Each spring the monitor would make a voyage down the California coast or a trip to Washington for target practice. From April to August 1895, she made an extended voyage down the South American coast to Callao, Peru, via Acapulco, Mazatl√°n, and Panama. The USS Monterey at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, circa 1896. The USS is visible in the background.With the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and Commodore George Dewey's great victory in Manila Bay 1 May 1898, the Monterey was ordered to sail for the Philippines to provide the Asiatic Squadron with big gun support against a possible attack by the Spanish 2nd Squadron, which included the battleship Pelayo and the large armored cruiser Emperador Carlos V. Though not designed for extended ocean cruising, the big monitor departed San Diego, California, 11 June in company with the collier Brutus for Manila. Sailing via Honolulu and Apra, Guam, the ships made the 8,000‚Äëmile voyage without mishap, arriving Cavite 13 August, and the Monterey remained in the Philippines, supporting the occupation of Luzon into 1899. On 18 September she commenced 5 days of operations in Subic Bay with the gunboats and and the supply ship Zafiro, helping to destroy a large gun at the head of the bay on the 25th. She remained in the Philippines until 6 April 1900, then sailing for China, where she received new boilers at Hong Kong. The Monterey operating from July 1900 to September 1901 as station ship at Shanghai, voyaging upriver to Nanking from 25 to 31 July 1902 with Special Commissioner T. S. Sharretts on board for a diplomatic mission. The Monterey continued her operations along the coast of China from Chefoo to Hong Kong, and also served as station ship at Shanghai for short periods. She returned to Cavite in the spring of 1903 for repairs, and was decommissioned 15 December 1904. The Monterey recommissioned in reserve at Olongapo Naval Station on 28 September 1907, but 8 1/2 months later was placed in ordinary on 7 May 1908. She remained at Olongapo, recommissioning in reserve through November 1911, and making brief voyages to Cavite, Manila, and Subic Bay for repairs and target practice. She was placed in full commission 9 November 1911 and two days later sailed for Amoy, China. The Monterey operated off the China coast to protect American interests at Foochow, Swatow, and Shanghai until, returning by Hong Kong to Cavite 16 November 1913. The Monterey returned to reserve at Olongapo 11 February 1913, and when World War I broke out in Europe moved to Cavite 11 August 1914. She returned to Olongapo in May 1915 and on 24 December sailed to cruise the Philippines, operating in the Manila‚ÄëCavite area on drills, recruiting, and making an island patrol as far south as Zamboanga, Mindanao, returning to Cavite 29 June 1916. The old monitor departed Cavite 13 November 1917, and was taken in tow by collier on the 15th. She proceeded by way of Guam to Pearl Harbor, arriving 19 December. Assigned as the station ship for Pearl Harbor Naval Station, the Monterey remained in service at the submarine base until she was decommissioned 27 August 1921. She was sold to A. Bercovich Co., Oakland, California in February, 1922, and towed across the Pacific to be scrapped.

Ota moved to Mexico in 1972, currently living in Mexico City. He came to the country to study art and learn about Mexico and decided to stay.  Artistry  He originally wanted to be a painter, but in Mexico his interest turned to sculpture, working in lead, stone, iron and wood. For many years he sculpted directly into stone and wood. His more recent work has emphasized the interior of his sculptures, creating hollow spaces, often by joining pieces of wood in intricate ways. He believes the interior of these words guard the pieces‚Äô energy. The exhibition 3 Casas Extraordinarias invites the onlooker to examine the interiors of three model houses. The three are made to be inhospitable, rather than comforting, such as the one that ‚Äúrains‚Äù on the inside. He is inclined toward primitive figures, generally circles and sphere, with a minimalist view. He contrasts his work with the abundance of things and technology today, believing it is necessary to look at simple and ‚Äúreal‚Äù things.

Ideally a shift lamp will illuminate at the engine speed beyond that which delivers the maximum BHP such that the BHP before and after shifting is the same. Accelerating the engine beyond this point is not conducive to rapid acceleration. In use a shift light allows the driver to judge the exact point that a gear change should be carried out without having to glance down at the tachometer. This also increases safety for the driver by keeping his focus on the track at all times. Beginning in the early 1980s, many United States- market vehicles equipped with a manual transmission began to have shift lights as standard equipment; these would usually signal for an upshift at an engine speed that provided maximum fuel efficiency, lower than the ideal engine speed for maximum BHP. The reason for this was, for a time EPA fuel economy testing rules stipulated that shift lights would be followed on vehicles so equipped- thus, they were calibrated for optimum fuel mileage on the EPA test cycle. Some in the 1980s even had buzzers to alert the driver it was at a certain rpm.

The towers collapsed following a major landslide that is said to be the cause of the tragedy. The Highland Towers consisted of three 13 story buildings or \\"blocks\\". The collapse of the Highland Towers' Block 1 resulted in 48 deaths. Residents and citizens occupying neighboring establishments, as far as two blocks away, were evacuated due to safety concerns. The Highland Towers complex was built in phases between 1974 and 1982. They were constructed at the western base of a steeply sloped hill, terraced extensively in the early 1980s. Block 1 was the southernmost building, Block 2 was built north-northwest of Block 1, and Block 3 was built west of Block 2. These towers were home to affluent middle-class families; a sizable percentage of the residents were expatriates. Causes In 1991, the constructions of the Bukit Antarabangsa Development Project began on the hilltop behind Highland Towers. Due to the clearing of trees and land- covering plants on the hill, the soil was exposed to land erosion. Soil erosion and landslides led to the eventual destabilization of Block 1's foundations. It started before the construction of Highland Towers when the water was diverted from a local stream called East Creek to bypass the building site. The piping, however, was not strong enough to withhold this extra water in addition to mineral debris, sand, and silt from both the creek and the building site. This caused the pipe to burst at several locations, and resulting in Block 1 absorbing the excess water. In December 1993, the area experienced a prolonged period of heavy rainfall. This caused the soil to become muddy, and shortly after, water was observed flowing down the slope of the hill. After a prolonged period of heavy rainfall, a landslide was created, due to the uphill development, which destroyed the retaining wall behind the first block's car park. The mass contained an estimated 100,000 square meters of mud, which is equivalent in weight to 200 Boeing 747 jets. The soil gradually pushed the foundation of Block 1 forward. Because of the building pressure, the foundations of Block 1 fracture. Some residents left the building when they saw cracks in the walls and the pavement around the towers. Despite the worsening signs of damage, no remedies were implemented before the collapse. Collapse Block 1 collapsed at 1:30 PM on December 11, 1993, burying the building's occupants under tons of debris. Two Indonesian people and one Japanese woman were the first three survivors rescued, though the woman would later die due to internal bleeding from head injuries sustained in the collapse. A student who lived near Highland Towers witnessed the collapse and reported it to the media. On December 13, the 24 members of the Japanese Disaster Relief Team and French Securite, a French civil defense team, arrived at the disaster site to assist in rescue operations. According to Datuk Ghazali Yaacob, Police Internal Security and Public Order director, rescuers became aware of survivors from the third and fourth floors after two trained German Shepherds detected them inside the building. On December 15, the rescue team began entering the collapsed building via the elevator shaft instead of the destroyed stairways to rescue the remaining survivors, resulting in another two women being rescued from the scene. Despite discovering a message tied to a wire, purportedly from survivors on the fourth floor, no bodies were found. On December 16, the French rescue team detected knocking sounds within the rubble of the collapsed building. However, as they were unable to find any additional survivors amidst the rubble, the rescue team pulled out from the sixth floor and above. Meanwhile, residents and owners of homes at Highlands Tower registered names of victims and set up a committee to represent them. The French Securite deployed heavy machinery and trained dogs into the collapsed building as a final attempt to rescue potential survivors. The rescue team dug the building up from the ground to the fifth floor on 19 December 1993 and found 29 decomposed bodies near the staircase of the third through fifth floors. Ten additional bodies were later recovered from the scene. Meanwhile, the army staff began preparing for demolition of the unaffected and evacuated Block 2, having found it unsafe for further occupation. The rescue team ended its mission on 22 December 1993, finding only two survivors and recovering the deceased remains of 48 people. Reaction After the collapse, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim urged that all skyscrapers and condominiums must perform stringent inspections to ensure that buildings are safe for occupation. Additionally, he encouraged the training of local rescue personnel should a disaster occur again in the future. Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang of the DAP called upon the government to set up a Royal Commission of Inquiry to investigate the collapse. Lawsuits On 15 October 1994, six residents filed a lawsuit against the developers of Highland Tower and eight other related parties, including AmBank and Ampang Jaya Municipal Council, for alleged negligence. The lawsuit sought more than RM 1.5 million for loss of property, property damage, rental fees, and funeral expenses. The developers and architectural team were sued for constructing the building without regard for safety. The plaintiffs argued that the architectural plans were designed without qualification in mind and were approved by the engineers without knowledge of who designed the plan. Additionally, the construction company was found to have used substandard materials and improper welding procedures during construction. On 2 June 2004, AmBank agreed to compensate RM 52 million to 139 residents of the Highland Towers complex. While some residents were happy with the compensation, Dr. Benjamin George, the chairperson of the Highland Towers Owners and Residents Committee, stated that the claims against the other parties involved were still ongoing. On 18 February 2006, the Federal Court ruled that the Ampang Jaya Municipal Council was not liable for the Highland Towers before, during, or after the incident. Additionally, the court ruled that the Council was protected by parliamentary immunity from claims regarding incidents before the collapse of the building.  Aftermath  As all residents evacuated both Block 2 and Block 3 on 12 December 1993, the complex succumbed to urban decay. On June 11, 1994, the first memorial ceremony to remember the tragedy was held at the site, and a memorial plaque was erected in honor of those who died. On December 11, 2004, in conjunction with the eleventh anniversary of the tragedy, all former residents and victims of the Highland Towers gathered at the site as a final farewell. The final farewell gathering was also attended by Tun Dr. Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali, former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad's wife. On December 11, 2010, AETN's History Channel showed an hour-long documentary of the tragedy, featuring accounts from the victims, their families, and former residents of the Highland Towers. On December 3, 2013, it was reported that AmBank planned to sell Highland Towers and its nearby bungalow lots through tender exercise, although no reason was given as to why the company would do so. As the land was not sold in 2013, AmBank prepared to sell the land for the second time on January 5, 2017. On March 29, 2016, the firefighter responsible for rescuing the two survivors reconnected with them on a TV9 televised interview in Bandar Utama. The abandoned remains of Block 2 and Block 3 were restricted from public access, and the area decayed due to both vandalism and element exposure. As reported by nearby residents, the remaining buildings became a haven for criminals, drug addicts, and mat rempits who used them as temporary shelters. On 12 April 2016, police near the buildings fatally shot three criminals. While attempts were made to cordon off the compound, no perimeter fencing was installed, and the gate was eventually tampered with to allow access. Prolonged use of the site as a criminal hideout caused residents of Taman Hillview and the neighboring Taman Sri Ukay to call for the demolition of the surviving towers. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government, who suggested that the buildings should be demolished and houses for the B40 group be built on the site, made an initial proposal on 28 June 2018. Former residents of the Highland Towers, who hoped to instead convert the area into a park, opposed the proposal. The original proposal was later changed on 19 August 2018, when the land was found to be unsuitable for housing and any buildings because of the collapse. As a result, the proposal was changed to create a recreational park instead. On September 14, 2018, the demolition of Highland Towers was scheduled to take place in October 2018. However, the demolition was delayed on December 11, 2018, pending an analysis of the structural integrity of the buildings. After lengthy delays, the Highland Towers were scheduled to be demolished by June 2019. Urban legends Because of the multiple deaths that occurred in the area, some residents alleged that the area was haunted. The assertions caused many paranormal enthusiasts to visit the ruins and attempt to capture paranormal activity. Others visited the site to pray to win the lottery. In 2015, when a YouTuber visited the area to shoot footage, the team found no evidence that the area was haunted. Local residents deny claims of paranormal activity and attribute assertions of such activity to hallucinations.  Subsequent landslides in the vicinity  Landslides continued to occur during mid-to-late year monsoon seasons on both sides of the hill where the Highland Towers were built and at nearby hills in Ulu Klang, with some leading to fatalities: * On May 15, 1999, a major landslip occurred downhill from the Wangsa Heights condominium at Bukit Antarabangsa (1.1 kilometers northeast of the Highland Towers), cutting off the western access road up to Bukit Antarabangsa. No reported fatalities occurred. * On November 20, 2002, a landslide occurred at the tip of Taman Hillview immediately south of the tower, destroying a bungalow belonging to retired Affin Bank chairperson general Tan Sri Ismail Omar and killing eight. * On May 31, 2006, a landslide occurred between the nearby village of Kampung Pasir and the Taman Zooville housing estate (3 kilometers north of the Highland Towers), destroying a Kampung Pasir longhouse and killing four. * On December 6, 2008, five days short of the 15th anniversary of the Highland Towers collapsed, a landslide occurred on the eastern side of Bukit Antarabangsa, 1.5 kilometers northeast of the Highland Towers. The landslide severely damaged 14 upscale bungalows, killing four and injuring fifteen.

They were best known for their appearances in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as Gymini. History=Independent circuit (1998‚Äì2005) After being trained at the Malenko School of Wrestling in Tampa, Florida, The Shane Twins debuted in the Florida based IPW Hardcore Wrestling. They were originally known as \\"Biff Wentworth\\" (Mike) and \\"Chaz Wentworth\\" (Todd), collectively known as \\"The Wentworth Twins\\" or as \\"Phi De Kappa U\\". The Shane Twins held the IPW Tag Team Championship five times between 1998 and 2003. Their fifth reign began when they defeated The Road Warriors in Hokkaid≈ç, Japan on a World Japan show. They also took on the Warriors, as well as feuded with The Nasty Boys, in the short-lived X Wrestling Federation in November 2001. As Phi Dekappa U, they wrestled The Pitbulls in the main event of the Break the Barrier supershow at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 15, 1999. Also in 1999, the Shane Brothers traveled to New Jersey to work with Tommy Fierro's ISPW in matches with the Misfits and The Stormtroopers. In 2000, they worked in Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) with the Haas Brothers. On January 13, 2001 Mike defeated The Dog to become the first IPW Hardcore Wrestling TV Champion. Todd, meanwhile, was out with an injury. On July 10, 2001 the Shane Twins won the vacant NWA Florida Tag Team Championship to become the Florida Unified Tag Team Champions (IPW Hardcore/NWA Florida) beating The New Heavenly Bodies and The Market Crashers in a Triple Threat match. On May 3, 2002, the Shane Twins won the JAPW Tag Team Championship after defeating Da Hit Squad at IPW WrestlePlex. They were stripped of the title on July 13. On June 8, 2002 The Shane Twins won the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Chris Nelson and Vito DeNucci in Lima, Peru. The twins appeared on the first Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) pay-per-view on June 19 under the ring names \\"Richard \\"Dick\\" Johnson\\" (Mike) and \\"Rod Johnson\\" (Todd), known collectively as \\"The Johnsons\\". The Johnsons were managed by Mortimer Plumtree until they left TNA after several weeks. The Shane Twins were then stripped of the NWA Tag Team Championships, as TNA had gained exclusive rights to that title on June 28, 2002. On March 20, 2004 Todd defeated Steve Madison for the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship, which he lost back to Madison on September 4, 2004. They then began working for NWA Florida, where they formed a stable with Steve Madison and Rod Steel known as \\"911 Incorporated.\\" They won the NWA Florida Tag Team Championships on four occasions. In July 2008, The Shane Twins returned to the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico for promoter Carlos Colon. World Wrestling Entertainment (2005‚Äì2007) In January 2005 the Shane Twins were signed to three year developmental contracts by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). On February 7, 2005 they were sent to developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW).They were later transferred to Deep South Wrestling (DSW), where they debuted under the name of \\"The Regulators\\". They immediately began a rivalry against High Impact (Tony Santorelli and Mike Taylor), as well as Ryan Reeves. On January 6, 2006, The Regulators debuted on SmackDown! as the proteges of Simon Dean, under a new team name of \\"Gymini\\". (The name was a play on both Simon Dean's gimmick - that of a nutrition supplement pitchman - and the mythological Gemini twins.) They were introduced to destroy Paul London and Brian Kendrick to the delight of Dean, and soon they became his henchmen under the pretext of being satisfied consumers of his nutrition system. Gymini also frequently wrestled on WWE web show, Velocity, usually against jobbers. During the April 14, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, their full ring names were revealed as \\"Jake\\" (Mike) and \\"Jesse\\" (Todd). Under the management of Dean, Gymini continued to dominate SmackDown!'s other tag teams before Jesse became injured. After Todd recovered, Gymini made appearances in the WWE developmental promotion DSW. They entered a feud with commentator Bill DeMott after attacking him and smashing a computer over his head. DeMott allied himself with Freakin' Deacon to get revenge on Gymini, but they defeated them in a no-DQ match when Deacon abandoned DeMott. In May, Gymini challenged for the DSW Tag Team Championship, but they lost to High Impact. At the end of October 2006, although the team appeared in various dark matches before SmackDown! events. Gymini feuded with The Major Brothers for the DSW Tag Team Championship and introduced their new valet Angel Williams. However, when Urban Assault (Sonny Siaki, Eric Perez and G-Rilla) captured the titles, Gymini began to feud with them. On December 14, 2006, Gymini captured the DSW Tag Team titles when Bill DeMott, burying his enmity with them, intervened in their match to attack G-Rilla, distracting Urban Assault enough to be defeated. DeMott became their manager and eventually replaced Williams. They wrestled a rematch against Urban Assault, who had turned on G-Rilla due to their loss and replaced him with Afa Jr., but Gymini won again when the former Urban Assault member attacked them. On January 18, 2007, WWE announced that they had released the twins.

It was released in 1986 by Silicon Beach Software and had already been used for creating Enchanted Scepters in 1984. In 1994, World Builder along with Course Builder, SuperCard, and HyperDA was cited as the reason Appleton was \\"something of a legend\\". On August 7, 1995 developer William C. Appleton released World Builder as freeware. Functionality The games World Builder created used different layers of code to manipulate the images the game contained: object code, scene code, and finally world code. The World Template included with the program contained default world code with default failure responses to standard text commands like north, south, up, down, and so on. Other than actions with characters (which were always combat oriented) and clicking on objects to pick them up everything had to set up through code and dialog boxes. The map is organized in compass directions and up/down as was common in earlier interactive fiction. Characters can be defined to move around independently and interacted with. There is also a special provision for weapons, which have a stochastic impact just as the dice of role-playing games. The game system includes QuickDraw vector graphics, a scripting language and digitized sound. A large number of games were made and released in circulation, many after the application was made freeware in 1995. The software does not support 32 bit addressing and hence games created with it are not compatible with System 7 or later. A ResEdit hack was provided to allow the program (and its games) to run on System 7 to 9 but sounds would not play on Power PC Macs. Ray Dunakin, author of numerous titles using the game development system, contributed various documentation and supporting files for the World Builder 1.2 release. Reception The program was reviewed in 1987 in Dragon #118 by Hartley and Patricia Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers stated that \\"The variety of worlds, scenes, and characters you can create and motivate seems endless... We are really impressed with World Builder.\\" In a subsequent column, the reviewers gave the program 3¬Ω out of 5 stars.

Their realm included Greater Armenia, Sophene and intermittently Lesser Armenia and parts of Mesopotamia. Their main enemies were the Romans, the Seleucids and the Parthians, against whom the Armenians had to conduct multiple wars. Historical background Dynasty of Artaxiad According to the geographer Strabo, Artaxias and Zariadres were two satraps of the Seleucid Empire, who ruled over the provinces of Greater Armenia and Sophene respectively. After the Seleucid defeat at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, a coup by the Armenian noble family of Artashes toppled the Yervanduni dynasty and declared their independence, with Artaxias becoming the first king of the Artaxiad dynasty of Armenia in 188. Scholars believe that Artaxias and Zariadres were not foreign generals but local figures related to the previous Orontid dynasty, as their Irano-Armenian (and not Greek) names would indicate.Hovannisian pp.47-48 According to Nina Garsoian / Encyclopaedia Iranica, the Artaxiads were a branch of the earlier Orontid (Eruandid) dynasty of Iranian origin attested as ruling in Armenia from at least the 5th century BCE. Consolidation of Armenian lands under Artaxias Artaxias is regarded as one of the most important kings in Armenian history. He presented himself as a legitimate descendant of Orontids, although it is unknown if he was in fact related to that dynasty. In the beginning of his rule, parts of the Armenian Highlands with Armenian speaking populations remained under the rule of neighbouring states. Artaxias made the reunification of those lands under his domain a priority. Greek geographer and historian Strabo recounts the conquests of Artaxias towards West, East, North and South as well as stating that the population of those territories was Armenian speaking. Strabo, Geography, book 11, chapter 14: :\\"According to report, Armenia, though a small country in earlier times, was enlarged by Artaxias and Zariadris, who formerly were generals of Antiochus the Great, but later, after his defeat, reigned as kings (the former as king of Sophene, Acisene, Odomantis, and certain other countries, and the latter as king of the country round Artaxata), and jointly enlarged their kingdoms by cutting off for themselves parts of the surrounding nations,--I mean by cutting off Caspiane and Phaunitis and Basoropeda from the country of the Medes; and the country along the side of Mt. Paryadres and Chorsene and Gogarene, which last is on the far side of the Cyrus River, from that of the Iberians; and Carenitis and Xerxene, which border on Lesser Armenia or else are parts of it, from that of the Chalybians and the Mosynoeci; and Acilisene and the country round the Antitaurus from that of the Cataonians; and Taronitis from that of the Syrians; and therefore they all speak the same language.\\" According to Strabo and Plutarch, Artaxias also founded the Armenian capital Artaxata with the aid of the Carthaginian general Hannibal who was being sheltered from the Romans within Artaxias' court. The population of the previous Orontid capital of Ervandashat was transferred to Artaxata. Over a dozen stone boundary markers have been discovered on the territory of modern Armenia from the time of the reign of Artaxias with Aramaic inscriptions; before their discovery, the existence of these stones was attested by Moses of Khorene. In these inscriptions Artaxias claims descent from the Orontid Dynasty: King Artaxias, the son of Orontid Zariadres. Hellenistic influences Though Greater Armenia had only been superficially affected by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the country began to be influenced by the Hellenistic world under the Orontids in the 3rd century and this process reached its peak under the Artaxiads, particularly King Tigranes the Great. During this time, the Armenian rulers incorporated many Greek elements. This is shown by the contemporary Armenian coins (which had first appeared under the Orontids). They followed Greek models and have inscriptions in the Greek language. Some coins describe the Armenian kings as \\"Philhellenes\\" (\\"lovers of Greek culture\\"). Knowledge of Greek in Armenia is also evidenced by surviving parchments and rock inscriptions. Cleopatra, the wife of Tigranes the Great, invited Greeks such as the rhetor Amphicrates and the historian Metrodorus of Scepsis to the Armenian court, and - according to Plutarch - when the Roman general Lucullus seized the Armenian capital Tigranocerta, he found a troupe of Greek actors who had arrived to perform plays for Tigranes.Grousset pp.90-91 Tigranes' successor Artavasdes II even composed Greek tragedies himself. Nevertheless, Armenian culture still retained a strong Iranian element, particularly in religious matters.This section: Hovannisian pp.50-52 Religion As Prof. James R. Russell states; \\"It was only natural that the Artaxiad monarchs should declare themselves philhellenes, yet it must not be thought that their religious beliefs ceased to be what they had been of old: staunchly Zoroastrian.\\" Prof. David Marshall Lang adds that the Hellenistic religion and the pantheon of the Classical divinities had undoubtedly become popular amongst the upper classes in the later Artaxiad period. Armenian Empire The Armenian empire under Tigranes the Great During the reign of Tigranes the Great (95‚Äì55 BC), the kingdom of Armenia was at the zenith of its power and briefly became the most powerful state to the Roman east. Artaxias and his followers had already constructed the base upon which Tigranes built his empire. Despite this fact, the territory of Armenia, being a mountainous one, was governed by nakharars who were largely autonomous from the central authority. Tigranes unified them in order to create internal security in the kingdom. The borders of Armenia stretched from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. At that time, the Armenians had become so expansive, that the Romans and Parthians had to join forces in order to beat them. Tigranes found a more central capital within his domain and named it Tigranocerta. Large territories were taken from Parthians, who were forced to sign a treaty of friendship with Tigranes. Iberia, Albania, and Atropatene also lost territories and the remainder of their Kingdoms became vassal states. The Greeks within the Seleucid Empire offered Tigranes the Seleucid crown in 83, after which the Armenian empire reached as far south as modern Acre, Israel resulting in a conflict with Hasmoneans. Decline Roman involvement in Asia Minor brought Tigranes' empire to an end. Tigranes had allied himself with Rome's great enemy Mithridates the Great, King of Pontus, and during the Third Mithridatic War, in 69 BC, a Roman army led by Lucullus invaded the Armenian empire and routed Tigranes outside Tigranocerta. In 66, Lucullus' successor Pompey finally forced Tigranes to surrender. Pompey reduced Armenia to its former borders but allowed Tigranes to retain the throne as an ally of Rome. From now on, Armenia would become a buffer state between the two competing empires of the Romans and the Parthians. Tigranes' heir Artavasdes II maintained the alliance with Rome, giving helpful advice to the Roman general Marcus Licinius Crassus on his campaign against the Parthians ‚Äì advice which went unheeded and led to Crassus' disastrous defeat at the Battle of Carrhae. When Mark Antony became ruler of Rome's eastern provinces, he began to suspect the loyalty of Artavasdes, who had married his sister to the heir to the Parthian throne. In 35, Antony invaded Armenia and sent Artavasdes into captivity in Egypt, where he was later executed. Antony installed his own six- year-old son by Cleopatra, Alexander Helios, on the throne of Armenia. Artavasdes' son Artaxias II gained help from the Parthians, seized the throne back and massacred the Roman garrisons in Armenia, but after a reign of ten years he was murdered. The kingdom broke down into a civil war between pro- Roman and pro-Parthian parties until it decisively became a Roman protectorate under the emperor Augustus. The Artaxiad dynasty petered out in chaos and it was a considerable time before the Arsacid dynasty emerged as their undisputed successors.This section: Hovannisian pp.58-62 Artaxiad Kings of Armenia (Note: Some dates are approximate or doubtful).Dates from Hovanissian page 62 * Artaxias I (190‚Äì159 BC) * Tigranes I (159‚Äì123 BC) * Artavasdes I (123‚Äì95 BC) * Tigranes the Great (Tigranes II, 95‚Äì55 BC) * Artavasdes II (55‚Äì34 BC) * Artaxias II (33 BC‚Äì20 AD) * Tigranes III (20 BC‚Äì10 AD) * Tigranes IV with Erato (10‚Äì2 BC) * Ariobarzanes (2 BC‚Äì4 AD) * Artavasdes III (4‚Äì6 AD) * Tigranes V then ruled with Erato (6‚Äì12 AD)  Genealogy of the Artaxiads  See also  * Artaxiad dynasty of Iberia NotesBibliography=Primary sources *Lucius Ampelius, Liber Memoralis *Appian, Roman History, \\"Syrian War\\" and \\"Mithridatic War\\" *Cassius Dio, Roman History *Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians *Movses Khorenatsi, History of the Armenians *Plutarch, Parallel Lives, \\"Antoninus Pius\\", \\"Crassus\\" and \\"Lucullus\\" *Strabo, Geography *Tacitus, Annals Secondary sources  Category:189 BC Category:180s BC establishments Category:Armenian kingdoms ","title":"Artaxiad dynasty"},{"id":"3773555","title":"Martin ≈†trb√°k"},{"id":"3773569","text":"Seaxburh, also Saint Sexburga of Ely (died about 699) was a Queen as well as an abbess, and is a saint of the Christian Church. She was married to King Eorcenberht of Kent. After her husband's death in 664, Seaxburh remained in Kent to bring up her children. She acted as regent until her young son Ecgberht came of age. Seaxburh founded the abbeys at Milton Regis and Minster- in-Sheppey where her daughter Ermenilda was also a nun. She moved to the double monastery at Ely where her sister √Üthelthryth was abbess and succeeded her when √Üthelthryth died in 679. According to Bede, in 695, Seaxburh organised the movement (or translation) of √Üthelthryth's remains to a marble sarcophagus, after they had lain for sixteen years in a common grave. On opening the grave, it was discovered that her body was miraculously preserved. The legend is described in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, which celebrates the saintly virtues of √Üthelthryth, but speaks less highly of Seaxburh, referring only to her marriage, succession as abbess and translation of her sister's relics. The date of Seaxburh's death at Ely is not known. The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge, compiled after 1106, describe her early life, marriage to Eorcenberht, retirement from secular life and her final years as a nun and abbess at Ely. Family Seaxburh was a daughter of Anna, King of East Anglia, the son of Eni, who ruled the East Angles from the early 640s and was slain together with his son Jurmin at the Battle of Bulcamp in 653 or 654.Earle, Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel, p. 27. Seaxburh married Eorcenberht of Kent, and was the mother of kings Ecgberht (d. 673), Hlothhere (d. 685), and of Saints Eormenhild and Ercengota. Her marriage to Eorcenberht produced two sons, both of whom ruled, and two daughters. Seaxburh's sisters were √Üthelburg of Faremoutiers, Saethryth, √Üthelthryth and possibly Withburga. She was the sister of √Üthelburg and Saethryth, who were both abbesses of Faremoutiers Abbey in Brie, and also the sister of √Üthelthryth, who married firstly Tonberht an ealderman of the South Gyrwe in the Fens, and secondly Ecgfrith of Northumbria. Withburga, who died in 743, may also have been her sister.Fryde et al, British Chronology, p. 8. The historian Barbara Yorke mentions the possibility that Seaxburh and her namesake Seaxburh of Wessex were the same person, but also notes that the accounts of Seaxburh's religious life at Ely contradict this suggestion.Yorke, Nunneries, p. 43. Seaxburh was buried at Ely with her sisters √Üthelthryth Wihtburh, and with her daughter Eormenhild. Marriage and widowhood Anglo- Saxon kingdoms in the 7th century Seaxburh was connected with the royal family of the Magons√¶tan by her marriage to Eorcenberht, who was king of Kent from 640 to 664. Eorcenberht was the great-uncle of Mildburh and her sisters, the daughters of King Merewalh of the Magons√¶tan.Sims-Williams, Religion and Literature, p. 101. Their sons Ecgberht and Hlothhere both became kings of Kent. Their daughter Ercongota was a nun at Faremoutiers, who was eventually canonised.Fryde et al, British Chronology, p. 13. Eorcenberht is mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle within the annal for 640: \\"Then his son Eorcenberht succeeded to the kingdom; he overthrew all devil-worship in his kingdom, and was the first of the English kings to establish the Easter festival\\". In the same passage is the Chronicle's single reference to Seaxburh and Eorcengota, \\"...√æaes dohter w√¶s ge haten Erchongata halifemne. and wundorlic man. th√¶re modor w√¶s Sexburh Annan dohter East Engla ciningas\\" ‚Äì '...his daughter was called Eorcengota, a holy and a remarkable person, whose mother was Seaxburh, daughter of Anna, king of the East Anglians'.Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 27.Earle, Saxon Chronicles Parallel, p. 27. Seaxburh and Eorcenberht had a second daughter, Ermenilda, who married Wulfhere of Mercia and after his death became a nun and was later canonised. According to Barbara Yorke, Seaxburh's marriage was itself of seminal importance in the establishment of monastic life for women during the Anglo-Saxon period, as she became an example of an ex-queen who made retreating to an nunnery a desirable royal vocation.Yorke, Nunneries, p. 27. Eorcenberht died on 14 July 664,Bede, Ecclesiastical History, iv, 1. in an outbreak of plague that occurred that year. After her husband's death, Seaxburh remained in Kent to bring up her children. She played an important political and religious influence in the kingdom: she acted as regent for her son Ecgberht, ruling Kent until her young son came of age, and was the founder of Kent's first abbey for women at Milton.Yorke, Nunneries, p. 26. Thereafter, Seaxburh became a nun and founded the abbey of Minster-in-Sheppey. According to the Liber Eliensis, a 12th-century chronicle and history written at Ely, an English source related that Seaxburh received \\"the veil of holiness\\" from Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in her church on the Isle of Sheppey and that her daughter Eormenhild also became a nun there.Fairweather, Liber Eliensis, p. 69. Seaxburh is said by her hagiographer to have sought refuge as a nun after living a secular role that she had found hard to tolerate: having reluctantly submitted to marriage, she hastened from queenhood to \\"a timely widowhood and a hasty withdrawal to the religious life\\", according to Susan Ridyard.Ridyard, Royal Saints, p. 90. :For a family tree of the ancestors of Seaxburh, see Wuffingas. Religious life at Ely A stained glass window depicting St. Seaxburh, from the Refectory of Chester Cathedral. Shortly afterwards Seaxburh moved to the double monastery at Ely, which was the precursor to Ely Cathedral, and where her sister √Üthelthryth was abbess. According to Yorke, Seaxburh's retirement to Ely is an example an Anglo-Saxon custom represented in a law: whereby a married woman remained the responsibility of the paternal side of her family, perhaps to spend the rest of her days as a nun or an abbess.Yorke, Nunneries, p. 31. Described by the Liber Eliensis as a \\"pretiosa virago\\" (precious lady- warrior)Fairweather, Liber Eliensis, p. 376. she succeeded as abbess when √Üthelthryth died, probably of plague, in 679.Williams et al, Dark Age Britain, p. 30. Seaxburh's previous political experience in East Anglia and Kent would have been useful in preparing her for the role of abbess at the double monastery at Ely.Dockray-Miller, Motherhood and Mothering in Anglo-Saxon England, p. 13. In 695 Seaxburh decided to translate the remains of her sister √Üthelthryth (who had been dead for sixteen years) from a common grave to the new church at Ely in a vivid demonstration of the dynastic value of the cult of royal saints in Anglo-Saxon England,Ridyard, Royal Saints, p. 53. Professor Patrick Sims-Williams has identified Seaxburh as \\"the chief mover behind the translation of her body and the promulagation of her cult\\".Sims-Williams, Religion and Literature, pp. 100-101. The Liber Eliensis describes these events in detail.Fairweather, Liber Eliensis, pp. 56-61. When her grave was opened, √Üthelthryth's body was discovered to be uncorrupted and her coffin and clothes proved to possess miraculous powers. A sarcophagus made of white marble was taken from the Roman ruins at Grantchester, which was found to be the right fit for √Üthelthryth. The architectural historian John Crook questions how such miraculous coincidences feature in hagiographies (the studies of the lives of saints), when he observes that \\"the miraculous discovery of a suitable coffin is, however, a hagiographic commonplace\\".Crook, Cult of Saints, p. 78. Seaxburh's supervised the preparation of her sister's body, which was washed and wrapped in new robes before being reburied.Ridyard, The Royal Saints, p. 179. She apparently oversaw the translation of her sister's remains without the supervision of her bishop, using her knowledge of procedures gained from her family's links with the abbey at Faremoutiers as a basis for the ceremony.Yorke, Nunneries, p. 50. The fourth book of the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, completed by the Northumbrian monk Bede in 731, celebrates the monastery at Ely and focuses on √Üthelthryth's piety and the translation of her relics. Bede does not mention the matrilinear succession established at Ely by √Üthelthryth, where power passed in turn to Seaxburh before subsequently transferring to Seaxburh's daughter Eormenhild and to her granddaughter, Werburh.Dockray-Miller, Motherhood and Mothering in Anglo-Saxon England, p. xiii-xiv. He praises the virtues of √Üthelthryth, a princess who was married twice but still preserved her virginity. Seaxburh receives little praise from Bede, as she had borne children before becoming a nun.Yorke, Nunneries, p. 154. He only mentions Seaxburh's marriage to Eorcenberht, succession as abbess and translation of her sister's relics.Ridyard, Royal Saints, p. 56. Death and veneration The date of Seaxburh's death is not known, but when she died at Ely, she was at \\"a good, late age\\", according to the Liber Eliensis, which also related that 'Richard, Bishop of Ely' translated the remains of Seaxburh and of \\"all the saintly women reposing in that place\\".Fairweather, Liber Eliensis, p. 278. Her feast day is 6 July.Butler, Lives of the Saints: February, p. 132. Seaxburh is mentioned in a written account of Kent's earliest Christian kings and their canonised relatives, known as the Kentish Royal Legend (Old English: √û√° h√°lgan). These kings, queens and princesses were unified by their holiness and royal connections. Pauline Stafford notes that the Legend \\"may have been a Christian alternative to pagan genealogy\\" to the rulers of 10th- and 11th- century mediaeval England, as it described an earlier period of sustained Christian piety within the royal dynasty of Kent. Being both a queen and a saint, Seaxburh was held in high regard within the Legend:Stafford, Queen Emma and Queen Edith, pp. 168-169. within it her role as queen and the founder of the minster at Sheppey was highlighted. The 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia lists several separate accounts of the saint's deeds and miracles, or Lives. The Life (or Vita) printed in John Capgrave's Nova, Legenda and used by the Bollandists, was perhaps copied from a Cotton manuscript in the British Museum. There is another Vita in Latin in the same collection, but it was so damaged by fire that it is useless. The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge were compiled after 1106 (the year the relics of Seaxburh were translated) and are copies from an earlier manuscript, now lost. The Vita describes Seaxburh's early life, marriage to Eorcenberht, withdrawal to Milton and then Minster-in-Sheppey, and her final years as a nun and the abbess at Ely. The section relating to her life at Sheppey is similar to another fragment, dating between the 9th and 11th centuries, and currently kept at Lambeth Palace. It has been suggested that part of the Vita Sexburge was derived from this manuscript, or that both parts originated from an earlier version of Seaxburh's Life.Ridyard, Royal Saints, pp. 57-58.

Production started in 1958 and lasted until the company ceased production in 1964. The car was based on an elongated chassis from the Facel Vega FV Coup√©. It was the only four-door model the company ever made. Production ended after only 156 cars had been built. The low production figure is a direct result of the car's exorbitant purchase price. When new, it cost about as much as four Citro√´n DS saloons, which themselves were hardly to be considered cheap cars. The towering price could still be boosted by ordering optional equipment, which gradually became available over the car's production run, such as power steering, power brakes, electric windows, wire-spoke wheels, and air conditioning. Design The Excellence features some styling elements usually found on American cars of the era, like tailfins, the wraparound windshield, and the \\"hardtop\\" roof without B-pillars. But the overall design is distinctively European, with its stacked quad-headlights and rakishly low profile. Its low beltline and comparatively high greenhouse predicted the automotive architecture that became mainstream in the late Fifties, and lasted throughout the Sixties. The Facel-Vega Excellence also incorporates a pillarless four-door mechanism, allowing the car to be designed with rear-hinged \\"suicide\\" styled rear doors for easier access and egress. This layout could also be found on the limited production Cadillac Eldorado Brougham, which was unveiled later in 1956, and on the mass-produced 1961-1969 Lincoln Continental. Inside, the car has a lavish interior with seats covered in aromatic leather, a fake walnut dashboard with full instrumentation, and a make up kit located in the back of the centre armrest, consisting of a chrome- handled brush and comb, and two perfume bottles, the latter albeit being supplied empty by the factory. Still, the interior is not nearly as roomy as one would expect from a car with a wheelbase exceeding three metres. The Excellence was a top performer and could hold its own among the best GTs Europe had to offer. Some high-performance American cars, most notably Chrysler's 300 'letter series' models, could probably outrun an Excellence in straight-line performance, but they were neither as refined, well built, nor had they the 'panache' of a Facel-Vega. Although the Excellence could match the wheelbase of most full-sized American cars of the time, it was considerably shorter, narrower, and most of all, lower. Its comparatively compact measurements gave it the edge in the handling department, which came in handy, especially under European road conditions. In an article for the November 1985 edition of Collectible Automobile Magazine, noted automotive historian Richard Langworth stated his opinion that \\"The Excellence is a large vehicle...better suited as a car of State rather than a daily driver.\\" How he came to this conclusion despite the unanimously positive reviews regarding the roadability of the Excellence from the contemporary motoring press as well as its owners, has been a matter of debate ever since. Chrysler connection Powered by contemporary Chrysler V8 engines, like other Facel-Vega cars, the initial Excellences were fitted with the famed Hemi, which Chrysler discontinued for the 1958 model year. Facel-Vega continued to use those engines until their stocks were used up in late 1958. From then on, the V8 powered Facel-Vegas were powered by the Chrysler B-series \\"Wedge\\" big-block engines. All Chrysler powered Facel-Vegas could be had with either the Pont-√†- Mousson built four-speed manual, or the Chrysler built Torqueflite three-speed automatic. Whereas the American automatic transmission was optional for the Facel-Vegas, the French manual gearbox conversely became optionally available in selected Chrysler high-performance models. 1958 (Model 'EX') While the Paris Show Car of 1956 was fitted with a 331 CID (5.4 Litre) unit, the initial batch of production Excellences was equipped with the monster 392 CID (6.4 Litre) version of the Chrysler Hemi V8. This engine, producing , was shared - among others - with the Facel Vega HK500 and Chrysler's own Imperial. Facels could either be ordered with the Pont-√†-Mousson built four-speed manual, or the Chrysler built Torqueflite three-speed automatic. Contemporary road tests showed, that they performed equally well with either gearbox. Arguably the most powerful Excellences to ever hit the roads, these were genuine 140 mph cars. Allegedly a mere eleven 'EX'-series cars were built, seven of which are known to survive. The Hemi-engined Excellences can be easily recognized by their inclusion of a hood scoop not seen on later models. 1958‚Äì1961 (Model 'EX1') For model year 1958, Chrysler discontinued the Hemi engines, and after stocks had dried up, Facel-Vega started using the 361 CID (5.9 Litre) Chrysler 'Wedge' head V8 engines. Why Facel-Vega didn't go for the top-of-the- line 413 CID (6.9 Litre) engines remains a mystery, but the French road tax system, which is based on engine displacement, is often cited as an explanation. Be it as it may, a 361-powered Excellence was anything but a slouch. It had the same nominal horsepower output as the Hemi it replaced, namely . The more faint at heart may be pleased to learn, that from late 1959 onwards, an Excellence could be stopped via optional power disc brakes up front. The 1958 to 1961 Excellences were the most numerous of the bunch with 137 examples being built. Late models incorporate nearly all of the advancements generally considered to be part of the EX2 update, including the non-panoramic windshield, chassis and steering upgrades, as well as the lesser fins. 1961‚Äì1964 (Model 'EX2') The Excellence received its only significant facelift in 1961. It now came with a bigger 383 CID (6.3 Litre) engine, rated at , a mindboggling figure back then, especially for a saloon car. However, no significant gain in performance could be noted in contemporary road tests, and the initial Hemi-powered cars remain the fastest Excellences ever built. Rear view of restyled Excellence EX2, showing the more muted tailfin design. The 'EX2' lost its wraparound windshield and the tailfins were severely clipped, which resulted in a considerably less flamboyant appearance. Despite these measures, the Excellence did not gain significantly more modern looks in general. It rather lost some of its previous elegance. But a complete re- styling of the car would have been prohibitively expensive, especially given its low production figures. More importantly, the chassis was updated, incorporating advancements introduced on the HK500, meaning that the EX2 flexed considerably less than earlier models. The door handles were also changed to better latching turn-down units. The domestic market price quoted for the car at the EX2's first Paris Motor Show, in October 1961, was 72,500 new francs for a car with automatic transmission. The same money could at that time buy more than twelve Renault Dauphines. Of these \\"EX2\\" models, only eight were completed, when production finally ceased for good. Discussions with Studebaker-Packard Following the proposition of a New York based conglomerate wanting to revive the luxurious Packard brand in 1959, Facel-Vega boss Jean Daninos entered into negotiations with Studebaker-Packard Corporation president Harold Churchill. The idea was to badge-engineer the Excellence with Packard nameplates and the trademark Packard \\"Ox-Yoke\\" grille, using Packard's new for 1956 and powerful V8's, and market it through the more \\"exclusive\\" Studebaker-Packard dealers in North America. However, Daimler- Benz, which already had a marketing partnership with Studebaker-Packard, using Studebaker's dealership network to sell its Mercedes-Benz brand of cars in the United States, objected to the plan. Mercedes never got used to the idea of selling their brand next to a working man's car, Studebaker, but also did not want floor competition for its luxury Type 300 model. Churchill realized that he could never get the same cash stream from Facel-Vega that he did from Daimler-Benz, and the whole project was abandoned. The Facel-Vega Excellence- cum-Packard did make it to the planning stage, but contrary to popular belief, not a single actual prototype was built. However, a number of Excellences were imported to the USA by private owners. In popular culture A Facel-Vega Excellence appeared in the 1959 movie Count Your Blessings starring Deborah Kerr and Maurice Chevalier. Other Excellences make brief appearances in the 1961 movie Goodbye Again, the 1963 movies Le temps des copains and Love Is a Ball, the 1972 movie Slaughter, and the 1990 movie Dancing Machine. None of them were the EX2 versions. At about the 40 minute mark of the S1 E8 episode of the TV series \\"Blood & Treasure\\" a blue Facel-Vega Excellence is seen on a street in Havana.

Starting out as a hardcore punk band ‚Äï and later an alternative metal band with some punk elements ‚Äï after its first two albums Not Obtain+1 and Play Dolls the band's music shifted to a more radio-friendly sound which could be described as a mix of pop and hard rock. After guitarist Suga left, the band slowly drifted back to heavier terrain. The band's current style could be described as heavy metal with alternative and progressive rock influences. History Official 12012 logo In 2007, the band performed the ending theme, \\"Cyclone\\", to the Gonzo anime television series Romeo x Juliet, its single being released by Universal Music Japan on June 13, 2007. The group has also toured Japan on many occasions as well as performing at concerts in numerous international locations. In September 2007, vocalist Miyawaki Wataru was arrested for assault on a woman. After a night of heavy drinking, it was reported he had tried to strangle a female acquaintance. It was resolved out of court, and the charges were later dropped. On October 17, 2007, Wataru posted an apology in his blog. It was announced on their official website that guitarist Y≈´suke Suga would be leaving the band on December 12, 2010, after the final concert of their \\"The Fangs of Killer„ÄåSeven„ÄçSadness\\" tour. The band continued with the four remaining members. In 2013, former support guitarist Shinichirou Saitou officially joined the band, and the year saw the release of two mini-albums: Deicida of Silence and The Swan. On February 10, 2014, the band announced an indefinite hiatus which would take place the same year on December 12.

In algebra, the average proficiency was 3.1 out of five, the same as the average in the state. In English, the average proficiency was 2.9 out of five, while the state's average proficiency was 3.0. Science and Mathematics Academy The Science and Mathematics Academy (SMA) is a magnet program located at Aberdeen High School in Aberdeen, Maryland available to Harford County residents entering high school. It was founded in 2004 by its first coordinator Donna Clem and in association with Dennis Kirkwood. The school is an active member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology and part of Harford County Public Schools. School information \\"The program provides students with opportunities to experience coursework in science, mathematics, and technology while emphasizing research applications. Regular communication with practicing scientists and mathematicians is a cornerstone of the program and seniors complete capstone projects. Throughout these projects they perform research under mentors who are professionals in their fields.\\" Classes and programs Within the SMA schedule, many honors classes are integrated. AP classes are also strongly encouraged. Electives in the SMA add to the program's uniqueness. Electives are based on interest and may not be available every year. The SMA has a unique class called Science Research and Technology (SRT) that SMA students are required to take each of four years at the SMA. The first three years of the SRT curriculum teach students about various academic fields and prepare them for their fourth and final year of SRT, in which they complete capstone projects. Students are paired with professionals in their fields of choice to mentor them for their projects. Seniors have two one-and-a-half-hour-long periods every other school day to complete their projects, which they present at the end of the year. They make posters to present their projects to the students, teachers, family, and professionals that come to the gallery walk that is held near the end of the school year. Throughout the process they have to perform research, write papers, and present their projects multiple times. All qualified Aberdeen High students can take part in the SMA Electives listed in the previous paragraph, but only SMA students can take SRT.

He was an All-American in college football and an outstanding professional football player in the Canadian Football League at the running back, quarterback, defensive back, and kicker positions. He is primarily known for his play with the Edmonton Eskimos. Later in his career, he played for the Toronto Argonauts and the BC Lions, and coached the Eskimos and Lions after his playing career ended. Parker was named a member of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1976, and the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1976. In November, 2006, Parker was voted one of the CFL's Top 50 players (No. 3) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. Early life Parker was born on January 1, 1932, in Knoxville, Tennessee and given the name John Dickerson Flanagan. When his mother remarried, he took on the last name of her new husband, Carroll Parker. He suffered through two childhood health scares. The first was when he almost died of a ruptured appendix,Sec Football 75 Years of Pride and Passion and the second was when he suffered a flesh-eating disease that almost cost him his entire leg. Doctors wanted to amputate but Parker's mother would not allow it.Greatest Grey Cups: The Best of Canadian Football Parker attended Young City High School in Knoxville, and despite playing only one year of football he was named an All-City tailback. While attending high school he met and married Peggy Jo, with whom he had three children, Jackie Jr., Peggy Mae and Jerri-Jo.Davis, Harrison, Parker to be inducted in JCJC Sports Hall of Fame Jackie Parker Obituary  College career =Jones County Junior College When he first was graduated from high school Parker found that his college playing choices were limited because he was married, so he elected to play his first two years of college sports for Jones County Junior College in Ellisville, Mississippi, from 1950 to 1951. In 1951, he led the Bobcat football team to a 9‚Äì0‚Äì1 record and a state title. He was also a standout baseball player helping JCJC to a South Division title and state runner-up finish in 1951 and a state championship in 1952. He was eventually inducted into both the JCJC Sports Hall of Fame and the National Junior College Athletic Association Hall of Fame.Davis, Harrison, Parker to be inducted in JCJC Sports Hall of Fame He then transferred to Mississippi State University where he spent two seasons as a member of the Bulldogs. Mississippi State When Parker first got to Mississippi State he once again found that his married status was a limiting factor as head football coach Murray Warmath had a policy against married players. Mississippi State baseball coach, R.P. \\"Doc\\" Patty had no such policy so Parker got a baseball scholarship and joined the team, where he was an outstanding shortstop and received an offer to play for the Cincinnati Reds. In 1952 the football coaches were in dire need of someone to run their new spit-T offense and gave Parker a chance. Early on coaches were not impressed with Parker, but then in the final scrimmage before the opening game he tossed seven touchdowns. Nicknamed \\"The Fast Freight from Mississippi State\\", he was named to the 1952 and 1953 All‚ÄìSoutheastern Conference teams and the 1953 College Football All-America Team. In 1952, he led all NCAA Division I players in points scored, with 120. Parker's 120 points were an SEC record that stood until 1992, when it was broken by Georgia running back Garrison Hearst. Parker won numerous other honors during his college career including being named the Nashville Banner SEC MVP in 1952 and 53, the Birmingham QB Club MVP in 1953 (an award he shared with teammate Hal Easterwood, who was a lineman), and being named the Atlanta Touchdown Club Back of the Year in 1953. Parker rewrote the record books at MSU and still holds several school records. * Most points scored by a non-kicker in a single season with 120 in 1952 (tied by Vick Ballard in 2010). * Most total points responsible for in a single season with 168 in 1952. * Highest career yards per pass attempt at 8.518. * Most rushing touchdowns in a single (modern) game with 4 vs Arkansas State in 1952 (record shared with 4 others). * Most points scored in a single (modern) game with 29 vs Arkansas State in 1952. * Most points responsible for in a single game with 6 TDs & 6 PATs vs Auburn in 1952. In addition to the records he currently holds, Parker set several records that have since been broken and remains on the top ten list in several categories at MSU. * 2nd most touchdowns responsible for rushing and passing in a single game with 6 vs Auburn in 1952 (broken by Dak Prescott in 2015). * 2nd in single season rushing TDs with 16 in 1952 behind Vick Ballard with 19 in 2010. * 3rd in career passing efficiency at 135.11 behind Tyler Russell's 137.3.Tyler Russell stats @ sports-reference and Dak Prescott's 146.0Dak Prescott stats @ sports-reference * 3rd in single season total TDs responsible for rushing and passing with 24 in 1953 behind Prescott's 41 in 2014 and Russell's 26 in 2012. * Tied with J.J Johnson and John Bond for 5th in career rushing TDs with 24 behind Michael Davis, Vick Ballard, Dak Prescott, and Anthony Dixon. * 7th on the all-time scoring list. * 10th in single season total TDs responsible for rushing and passing with 15 in 1952 On top of his exploits as the Bulldog QB, Parker was also the team's leading punt returner in 1953, the leading kick returner in 1952 and 1953, and led the team in passes intercepted in 1953 with 4.2013 Mississippi State University Football Media Guide 2015 Mississippi State University Football Media Guide To go along with his athletic awards, he was named to the 1953 Cosida All- Academic team. In 1976, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.  Professional playing career  Once his college playing days were over Parker was drafted by both the New York Giants of the NFL and the Edmonton Eskimos of the Western Interprovincial Football Union (which became part of the Canadian Football League in 1958).1954 NFL Draft Despite being offered more money by the Giants, Parker chose to sign with the Eskimos in part because his former quarterbacks coach at Mississippi State, Darrell Royal, had become the Eskimos' head coach. Royal never actually coached Parker in Canada as he returned to Mississippi State as the head coach for the 1954 season.Darrell Royal‚Äôs CFL Coaching History At the end of his first season Giants owner Wellington Mara personally came calling with a contract worth almost twice what Parker was making with the Eskimos but Parker chose to not to go to New York in part because Peggy said she liked Edmonton better. Nicknamed \\"Ol' Spaghetti Legs\\", Parker became one of the most important parts of the Eskimos dynasty of the mid-1950s. While Parker played both defence and offence, a not uncommon practice in his day, his main strength was offense, where he was both a strong runner and an excellent quarterback. This is shown by his Western All-Star selections; as a running back in 1954, 1957 and 1959, and as a quarterback in 1955, 1956, 1958, 1960 and 1961. Parker won six consecutive Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophies as the West's most outstanding player from 1956 to 1961, and seven in total. He was awarded the Schenley Award as Canadian football's most outstanding player in 1957, 1958 and 1960 and was the runner-up in 1956 and 1961. During the first three years of his career (1954‚Äì1957), the Eskimos won consecutive Grey Cups. In the 1954 Grey Cup, Parker made one of the most famous plays in Grey Cup history when, in the fourth quarter, Ted Tully hit Montreal Alouettes running back Chuck Hunsinger forcing a fumble. Parker recovered the ball and returned it 90 yards for a touchdown, giving the Eskimos, who were a large underdog in the game, a surprise victory. Parker's 90-yard fumble return remained a Grey Cup record until Cassius Vaughn's 109 yard fumble return in the 105th Grey Cup. Following the 1962 season, the Eskimos traded Parker to the Toronto Argonauts for five players and $15,000. Parker played in Toronto from 1963 to 1965. Parker finished his playing career with the BC Lions in 1968 when, as an assistant coach, he helped the team out of a difficult mid-season situation by donning the pads for one last go round as quarterback. At the time of his retirement, Parker, who also kicked extra points and field goals, had scored a then CFL record 750 points.  Coaching and post-football career  After his playing days ended, Parker moved into coaching. Parker coached the BC Lions for part of the 1969 season and all of 1970, before moving on to the front office as general manager the next year. He stayed as general manager until being fired in 1975. Parker coached the Eskimos from 1983, taking over at mid-season after a 4‚Äì4 start led to the firing of Pete Kettela until resigning for health reasons two games into the 1987 season, with Joe Faragalli replacing him as Eskimos coach; the team went on to win the Grey Cup that season after losing to Hamilton the previous year. After leaving football, Parker was an executive with the Interprovincial Steel & Pipe Corporation, Ltd. On November 7, 2006, Parker died in the early morning hours at a local Edmonton hospital at age 74 due to throat cancer. Parker's awards and honours Parker's jersey No. 91 currently hangs on the Wall of Honour at the Eskimos' Commonwealth Stadium. \\"Jackie Parker Park\\" in Edmonton, Alberta, was named in his honour. The Jackie Parker Trophy, awarded annually to the Most Outstanding Rookie in the West Division, is named after him. Jackie Parker was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the Mississippi State University Hall of Fame and the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in 1972, the College Football Hall of Fame in 1976, and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1987.

Since 1427 the landowners of ≈†aca were the Semsey family, who built a castle here in the 15th century. It was demolished later in the same century, on the order of the King Matthias Corvinus. Later members of the family built a rococo manor house in ≈†aca in the late 18th century, which stands to this day. Water mills were operated in ≈†aca since the Middle Ages, until 1950.

In January 1960 construction started on more than 8 square kilometres of land. In 1965 the first blast furnace was fired up and production in the hot rolling mill and coke plant was started. In four decades the Ko≈°ice mill has developed into a steel-producing plant that has managed to reach the markets and achieve a position among the significant steel producers. It has been accepted as a member of prestigious international organizations associating iron and steel producers and has become a partner of renowned foreign firms in joint ventures.

The programme was first aired by the First Soviet Channel on November 8, 1961.¬´–° —á–µ–≥–æ –≤—Å—ë –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞–ª–æ—Å—å¬ª –Ω–∞ AMIK.RU Eleven years later, in 1972, when few programmes were being broadcast live, Soviet censors found the students' impromptu jokes offensive and anti-Soviet and banned KVN. The show was revived fourteen years later during the Perestroika era in 1986, with Alexander Maslyakov as its host. It is one of the longest-running TV programmes on Russian Television. It also has its own holiday on November 8, the birthday of the game, which KVN players celebrate every year since it was announced and widely celebrated for the first time in 2001. During the Perestroika era, KVN spread to Russian expatriate communities around the world. In 1992 the Israel team tested the waters playing against the CIS team. The game was an unquestionable success and more international games on a highest level followed: the CIS team visited Israel, Germany and the United States. The culmination was in 1994 with the First KVN World Festival in Israel with 4 teams (the United States, Israel, CIS and Germany). KVN as a competition Groups of KVN teams are organized into several Leagues, where they compete annually for the League Champion title. To organize the movement, the KVN Union created a structure of regional and multi-regional arrangements of Leagues. The Major League and the Premier- League are regularly broadcast on Russian Channel One. Other Leagues are broadcast on local channels. The winner of the Major League (Vysshaya Liga ) is declared the Champion of the Club. There are other KVN competitions outside the Leagues: the KVN Festival (KiViN) is held in Sochi every January and attracts hundreds of teams from around the world, this is where teams are arranged into Leagues for the Season, the Musical Festival which is called \\"Singing KiViN\\" (Golosyaschiy KiViN, ) is held every July in J≈´rmala, Latvia (from 2015 in Svetlogorsk, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia) where teams are competing to win KiViNs, which are also very prestigious prizes, the Summer Cup or Supercup is played usually in August every year in a different place, usually in Sochi, and only Major League Champions are allowed to compete (with some exceptions, when in 2003 a unique team of famous KVN players competed (and also won) and 2007, 2008 and 2010 when Finalists were invited), another game is held every year in November to celebrate KVN's birthday and is called the Specproject (pronounced \\"Spetsproyekt\\"). Many places in the CIS have Leagues independent from the KVN Union and conduct their own competitions. The same is true of KVN competitions outside the CIS which have no connection to KVN Union. KVN as a game Alexander Maslyakov hosts the Major League on April 1, 2013 KVN is a task-based team competition in front of a live audience and judged by a panel of judges. Typically, each team is asked to complete in four‚Äìfive thematically connected assignments, such as: * Mandatory **Greeting (Privetstviye, ): witty introduction of the team, humorous greeting to the jury and spectators. **Warm-up (Razminka, ) (usually the second contest): rapid exchange of funny questions and improvised answers, sometimes played against the audience, jury and/or the host. **Musical Competition (Muzykalnyy Konkurs, ): a competition in which the competing teams show musical sketches and acts involving singing, playing musical instruments and dancing. Sometimes an alternate shorter version called One Song-Contest (Konkurs Odnoy Pesni, ) is played. In this competition the players must use only one melody throughout the competition. * Optional **STEM (\\"students' variety miniature theater\\") (): a contest in which only three performers from a team are allowed to be on stage simultaneously (the rule didn't apply at the 2008‚Äì2009 seasons). **Captains' contest (Kapitanskiy Konkurs, ): individual competition between the team captains. **Homework (Domashneye Zadaniye, ): comedy theatre sketches on a given topic, sometimes a Musical Homework is played when there is no Musical Competition. **BRIZ (Bureau of Rationalization and Invention) (): In this contest the teams need to present something such as an invention, a brief historical survey, movies, photo-albums or any type of new idea. It is also called a literature contest because it mainly consists of textual jokes. **News Contest (Konkurs Novostey, ): similar to the BRIZ, but focuses on strange and funny \\"news\\". **Biathlon (): a contest in which a representative of each team \\"shoots\\" one joke or more at the audience. The jury decides who leaves the \\"shooting range\\" until only two contestants remain and the jury picks one winner who gets 1 point. In case of a draw the finalists receive 0.9 points each. **Freestyle (): a more modern and free version of the Greeting in which the teams have no restrictions of genre. **Cinema Contest (Kinokonkurs, ): a contest which involves making a movie, making a clip to a song, making a clip consisting of different video and audio pieces or dubbing a well-known movie. Rarely, other activities are assigned. A panel of judges, usually well- known celebrities, actors, and writers, evaluates performances on wit, humour, production values, and spectators reaction and declares a winner by awarding points to the teams. In the Premier-League the jury consists usually of famous KVN players. KVN as a social phenomenon Vladimir Putin attends the taping of the 50th anniversary episode of the KVN comedy show and congratulates KVN members, November 13, 2011 KVN's reach is impressive. According to the official site of KVN Union: *over 5 million live spectators annually watch now *more than 40,000 participants organized into *more than 3,000 regularly competing teams from *more than 100 cities play game of KVN. For more than 20 years TV broadcasts of KVN games receive the highest ratings in Russia. The popularity of the game is so high that even politicians use it as an opportunity to gain extra points, Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev attended games played before the elections. The game of KVN helps in interstate relationships. The CIS‚ÄìIsrael game broadcast on September 19, 1992 helped in warming up relationships between the two countries (mostly on Russia's side). KVN became part of the culture, illustrated by the fact that it became a game of choice in Russian-speaking communities around the globe. Also, the president of the club, Alexander Maslyakov, received one of the highest (if not the highest) award from Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, for hosting the game for so many decades. This happened at the end of the game dedicated to KVN's 45th anniversary in November 2006. KVN around the world Since Perestroika opened former-Soviet borders for emigrants, KVN has reached Israel, Germany, Australia, Portugal, France, The United Kingdom, Vietnam and the United States. Many countries created their own teams, leagues and competitions. In 1992 the Israel team tested the waters playing against the CIS team. The game was an unquestionable success and more international games on a highest level followed: the CIS team visited Israel, Germany and the United States. The culmination was in 1994 with the First KVN World Festival in Israel with 4 teams (the United States, Israel, CIS and Germany). This event attracted a new generation of players to KVN. Currently, the American League includes more than 30 teams from different universities, including such prominent ones as Harvard, Berkeley and New York University (NYU) (the very first League Champion). KVN Israel comprises two Leagues with about 30 teams from different towns. The U.K. also has a prominent KVN community, with teams from a number of universities.

Miller upon his retirement after 28 years as superintendent of the school district.\\"John L. Miller, 93, School Superintendent\\", The New York Times, January 5, 1998. The new name was John L.

Miller‚ÄìGreat Neck North High School. Also called \\"North\\". As of 1988, Great Neck North has an \\"open campus\\" policy. Students in grades 9 through 12 may go in and out of campus. Rona Telsey, a spokesperson for the district, said in 1988 that \\"open campus\\" had not been a controversy for the school.

Alexander Filippovich Kokorinov () (July 10, 1726 ‚Äì March 21, 1772) was a Russian architect and educator of Siberian origin, one of the founders, the first builder, director (1761) and rector (1769) of the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Peterburg. Kokorinov has been house architect of the Razumovsky family and Ivan Shuvalov, the first President of the Academy. Kokorinov's surviving architectural legacy, once believed to be substantial,Shuisky, p.41 has been reduced by recent research to only two buildings, the Imperial Academy of Arts and Kirill Razumovsky palace in Saint Petersburg.Shuisky, p. 41 The Academy was designed by Jean- Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe based on an earlier proposal by Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel, while Kokorinov managed the construction in its early phases (1764‚Äì1772). Biography= Early Years and Family  Alexander Kokorinov was born in Tobolsk in the family of a government clerk. His grandfather was a priest. At the age of 14 Alexander began training with Johann Blank (father of Karl Blank), a self-proclaimed architect exiled from Saint Petersburg for his involvement in the alleged conspiracy of Artemy Volynsky (1740). With the ascension of Elisabeth in 1741 survivors of the Volynsky affair were amnestied and the Blanks returned to Moscow, taking Kokorinov with them.  Education  After the death of Johann Blank, in 1745 Alexander Kokorinov and Karl Blank studied arts and architecture in Moscow under Dmitry Ukhtomsky, then the leading Moscow architect of Elisabethan Baroque and dean of an architectural school based in Moscow Kremlin. Soon Kokorinov was invited into the group of Ivan Korobov, where the young architect gave such a good account of himself that was promoted by the master and in 1749 was awarded the title of apprentice. This title allowed Kokorinov to build and take private orders by himself. In this post Kokorinov also was in charge of reconstruction and restoration of the Moscow Kremlin towers and walls. Soon the architect's reputation was that good that even hetman Kirill Razumovski hired him to work on his Petrovskoe estate. He received the degree of Master of Mathematics from Moscow UniversityLisovsky, p. 23 and in 1754 Kokorinov passed professional examination as a junior architect, joined the staff of Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli and relocated to Saint Petersburg where he made contact with count Ivan Shuvalov, founder of Moscow State University (1755) and the Imperial Academy of Arts (1757). Kokorinov joined the staff of the Academy since its first days.  Career  Shuvalov initially proposed to set up the Academy in Moscow and commissioned Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel to design the new campus there.Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 232 Empress Elisabeth insisted that the Academy must be based in Saint Petersburg, and the task of adapting Blondel's plans was awarded to Kokorinov, who has already designed Shuvalov's own house in Saint Petersburg. Kokorinov, firmly trained only in Baroque styling, struggled with Blondel's French neoclassical design and in 1759 Shuvalov hired another Frenchman to assist Kokorinov. Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe, Blondel's cousin and a recent graduate of the Royal Academy of Architecture, became Kokorinov's peer on the Academy project and soon surpassed him. Design of the building is traditionally credited by Kokorinov and de la Mothe, but recent research in French archives indicate that it was de la Mothe's own work, while no drafts by Kokorinov were ever found.Shuisky, p. 43 The Academy, a complex structure measuring 140 by 125 meters, bears traces of Blondel's style yet, according to Dmitry Shvidkovsky, \\"is more up to date ... especially noticeable in plan. Where Blondel specified a corinthian order, the stricter Roman Doric was actually used. The cupola too is more laconic than as designed by Blondel. The complete building turned out even more austere than it appears in de la Mothe's drawings.\\"Shvidkovsky 2007, pp. 232-233 In 1761 Kokorinov was appointed director of the Academy (subordinate to its President), but it was not until 1765 when he became its professor. He taught elementary architectural theory and history of architecture, while de la Mothe taught advanced architectural subjects. While the architects finalized their proposal, Russia was shaken by a brief reign (5 January 1762 ‚Äì 9 July 1762) and murder of emperor Peter III, succeeded by Catherine II. The new empress sent Shuvalov to a de facto exile in his country estate and installed Ivan Betskoy as the new President of the Academy. March 18, 1764, she authorized financing for construction in earnest and set up construction board, headed by Kokorinov.Shuisky, p. 45 De la Mothe, who always shied away from practical construction, was not actively involved on site; for the first time in Russian history, architectural profession was split into architectural design and construction management. During Russian-Turkish war of 1768‚Äì1774 financing of the project virtually stopped, while Betskoy initiated a criminal case against alleged fraud on the site. Kokorinov, blamed with cost overruns, died in 1772; unofficial opinion held it that he committed suicide.Shuisky, p. 46 De la Mothe left Russia in 1775, the building was completed by Yury Felten in 1788.

Earl James Winchester (February 26, 1752 ‚Äì July 26, 1826) was an officer in the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783) and a brigadier general during the War of 1812 (1812‚Äì1815). He commanded the American forces at the Battle of Frenchtown, which led to the Massacre of the River Raisin. Early life Son of William Winchester and Lydia Richards, he was born February 26, 1752 in Carroll County, Maryland. Winchester enlisted in the Maryland militia during the American Revolution. He served Gen. Hugh Mercer's Flying Camp battalion during the early months of the war. He was captured by British forces during Gen. John Sullivan's failed attempt to take Staten Island on August 22, 1777. Winchester was released in a prisoner exchange, and in May 1778 he was commissioned a lieutenant in the 3rd Maryland Regiment. He was taken prisoner a second time at the surrender of Charlestown, South Carolina on May 12, 1780. Exchanged in December, he was promoted to captain and served the remainder of the war under Gen. Nathanael Greene. Life in Tennessee In 1785, Winchester moved to what is now central Tennessee, then a frontier district of North Carolina. He became an officer in the militia and eventually was promoted to brigadier general. Following Tennessee's admission to the union in 1796, Winchester was elected to its first Tennessee General Assembly serving in the Tennessee State Senate.Early Members of the Tennessee General Assembly In 1802, he completed the construction of his plantation home, Cragfont. War of 1812 In March 1812, three months before the war with Britain began, Winchester was commissioned a brigadier general in the United States Army. When the hostilities started, he was placed in command of the Army of the Northwest, composed of several regiments then camped near Cincinnati. However, a conflict over command resulted in Gen. William Henry Harrison taking charge of Winchester's forces in an expedition against Fort Wayne, by virtue of Harrison's militia commission from Kentucky. Winchester's seniority was confirmed in September, but he was forced to relinquish command several days later when Harrison was commissioned a major general in the regular army. Later that month, Winchester commanded one wing of Harrison's advance to Fort Defiance. After engaging in several skirmishes with British and Native American forces, he camped at the Maumee Rapids (present day Toledo, Ohio) in December 1812. River Raisin Massacre Early in 1813, Winchester took part in an attempt to recapture Frenchtown (present day Monroe, Michigan). On January 18, his men drove off a smaller Canadian and Indian force and recaptured the American town. However, his men were attacked four days later by a combined British/Indian/Canadian force under Col. Henry Procter in the Battle of Frenchtown. Winchester himself was captured by Roundhead while trying to reach his men. Following the loss of hundreds of his soldiers in the initial assault, he agreed to order a conditional surrender of the remainder of his troops in exchange for \\"a pledge of protection\\". Despite Procter's pledge, Indians accompanying the British slaughtered 68 seriously wounded American soldiers in the Massacre of the River Raisin. Winchester was imprisoned in Canada for more than a year. He was released in a prisoner exchange and assigned to command the District of Mobile. After the war's end, he resigned his regular commission in March 1815 and returned home to Tennessee. Post war years In 1819, Winchester served on the state commission to regulate the Tennessee-Missouri boundary. Along with Andrew Jackson and John Overton, he founded the city of Memphis, Tennessee on May 22, 1819. Death and legacy Winchester died in Gallatin, Tennessee at the age of 74 on July 26, 1826. He is buried in Winchester Cemetery at Gallatin. The city of Winchester, Tennessee, is named in his honor. See also William Atherton (soldier) References *McHenry, Robert.

At other times she was known as \\"Mrs Behrens\\" and \\"Mrs Baillie\\", even though she is not thought to have married. Her classical beauty was matched by her skill as a horsewoman, for which she was almost equally renowned. In the 1860s the fascinating sight of Catherine riding on Rotten Row in Hyde Park drew huge crowds of sightseers.

A grave bearing the initials C.W.B and the date of death 4 August 1920 is at the Friary Church of St Francis and St Anthony, Crawley, West Sussex. During her life as a courtesan, her discretion and loyalty to her benefactors became the focal point of her career. There were many rumours about her being involved with certain wealthy men of the time, but she never confirmed or denied these rumours. This gave her great weight in the courtesan lifestyle, and made her a sought-after companion. It also gave long life to her career, and helped her to retire a wealthy woman of society around 1890. Her estate was worth a very considerable ¬£2,764 19s. 6d at her death.Theo Aronson, 'Walters, Catherine (1839‚Äì1920)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 200 As well as her home in Mayfair, which according to DNB she had from 1872, she seems to have had other addresses, judging from a court case in which she was sued for non-payment of a tailoring bill. The other addresses may have been properties she owned. Two were hotels, one in France. Catherine Walters died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 5 August 1920 at her home at 15 South Street, Mayfair, and was buried in the graveyard of the Franciscan Monastery in Crawley, West Sussex. Cultural references In 1864 a London publisher, George Vickers, brought out three fictionalised biographies: Anonyma: or, Fair but Frail; Skittles: the Biography of a Fascinating Woman; and Skittles in Paris. The author was possibly William Stephens Hayward, or Bracebridge Hemyng. The open sale (and commercial success) of the biographies caused expressions of moral concern in contemporary newspapers and magazines. In 1861, Alfred Austin, a future Poet Laureate, referred to 'Skittles' by name in The Season: a Satire, his poem satirising mid-Victorian social mores. He described her dramatic appearance in Rotten Row, and the covert and jealous interest society ladies felt for her. He also suggested that Skittles and other celebrity prostitutes were attractive not merely because they offered sex, but because they were more natural, less repressed and less boring than the well-bred girls who came to London for the marriage 'season'.\\"Go, girls! to Church! believing all you hear/Think that their lack of virtue makes them dear;/Unheeding me, who say that ban and bar/ Make you the stupid, stunted things you are;\\" Wilfrid Scawen Blunt's poetic sequence The Love Sonnets of Proteus and his later work Esther are thought to be based on his early affair and later friendship with Walters.Going, William T:Wilfred Scawen Blunt, Victorian Sonneteer VP II, (Spring 1964), 67‚Äì85 The painter Edwin Henry Landseer submitted a picture called The Shrew Tamed for the Royal Academy exhibition of 1861. It showed a beautiful girl in riding habit reclining against the neck of a horse which is on its knees among the straw. It was ostensibly not a portrait of Walters, but the alleged model, the noted horsewoman Annie Gilbert, resembles her, and the juxtaposition of horse, beautiful woman and prevailing mood of languor troubled contemporary critics;The Times :\\"‚ÄúThe Shrew Tamed;‚Äù Sir E. Landseer. ‚Äì ...The lady reclines against his glossy side, smiling in the consciousness of female supremacy, and playfully patting the jaw that could tear her into tatters, with the back of her small hand. For horses read husbands, and the picture is a provocation to rebellion addressed to the whole sex...‚Äù The Times, Saturday, 4 May 1861; pg. 12; Issue 23924; col A some clearly assumed Walters herself had been the subject.Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine Vol. 90 (550) Aug 1861 Page 211:'\\"The Shrew Tamed\\" ‚Äì a high-bred horse of soft silken coat, dappled with play of light and shade as on velvet, subdued by a \\"pretty horsebreaker\\", is certainly unfortunate as a subject. This picture has been made the more notorious by \\"The Belgravian Lament\\", which took the well-known rider as a text whereon to point a moral. We hope it will now be felt by Sir Edwin Landseer and his friends that the intrusion of \\"pretty horsebreakers\\" on the walls of the Academy is not less to be regretted than their presence in Rotten Row.' The picture gained the alternative title of The Pretty Horsebreaker. In Charles Reade's novel A Terrible Temptation (1871) the character of the courtesan Rhoda Somerset is partly based on Walters.

Of the total 2,619 burials, the cemetery contains 2,338 Canadian soldiers. It was built to a design by Commission architect Philip Hepworth. History The cemetery is unique in that many of the dead were brought here from nearby Germany. It is one of the few cases where bodies were moved across international frontiers. It is believed that all fallen Canadian soldiers of the Rhineland battles, who were buried in German battlefields, were re-interred here (except for one who is buried in Reichswald Forest War Cemetery).see Commonwealth War Graves Commission General Crerar, who commanded Canadian land forces in Europe, ordered that Canadian dead were not to be buried in German soil. The cemetery also has a Cross of Sacrifice within it. Thousands of Dutch children tend the graves of the soldiers buried here as they do throughout the Netherlands. Commemoration Within the cemetery stands the Groesbeek Memorial, which commemorates members of the Commonwealth land forces who died during the campaign in north-west Europe between the time of crossing the Seine River at the end of August 1944 and the end of the war in Europe. There are 1,016 names on the memorial; although since the date of completion of the name-panels, graves have been found for four men commemorated by it.

In almost all respects, the ZIL-114 improved on the 111, 111A and 111G models. The engine, a ZIL-built pushrod V8, was increased in capacity from to , resulting in an increase of power by 30 percent (to 300 hp SAE Gross at 4400 rpm and at 2750 rpm) and of maximum speed from approximately to . Transmission was two-speed automatic, with hydraulic torque converter. A three-speed gearbox was offered beginning in April 1975. Front suspension was by torsion bars. Although the rigid rear axle with leaf springs was retained, the ZIL-114 saw the replacement of drums by power-assisted disc brakes (with no fewer than three circuits) on all four wheels to cope with the more powerful engine. It was the first Soviet car with four-wheel disk brakes. It also had a pedal- operated handbrake. There were more luxury appointments than found on previous ZIL models, with such features as air conditioning added to the furnishings of the ZIL-111. Power windows, power door locks, and a remote-control driver's mirror were standard. Measuring long and weighing , it was also equipped with power steering. The styling was updated somewhat in 1971; with the front end looking similar to that of such cars as the 1966 Imperial but having different shapes and details. Small numbers of the 114K, with a cutaway roof to allow occupants to stand, were built. Two copies of an ambulance variant, the 114EA, with a sedan delivery body and higher roof, were also built. The ZiL-114N was reskinned with the body panels of its successor, the ZiL-4104. The 114 continued in limited production until the late 1970s when it was replaced by the even larger and heavier ZIL-4104. About 150 ZiL-114s were produced. The ZIL-117 was a short-chassis sedan version with only five seats and a much shorter wheelbase. It was also available as an unusual four-door convertible (like the ZIL-111V). The ZIL-114 was an official state car and transported only members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the top leaders of the country, whereas the shorter ZIL-117 was used by secretaries of the Central Committee, as well as escort vehicles in the motorcade of heads of state, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the head of the Council of Ministers. In October 1971, the 114 was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the widest car in production, then from October 1974 to 1976 as the heaviest.Maurice A. Kelly.

Since their inception, circuit breakers have been modified to prevent both speculative gains and dramatic losses within a small time frame. When triggered, circuit breakers either stop trading for a small amount of time or close trading early in order to allow accurate information to flow among market makers and for institutional traders to assess their positions and make rational decisions. United States= Description  On the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), one type of trading curb is referred to as a \\"circuit breaker\\". These limits were put in place after Black Monday in 1987 in order to reduce market volatility and massive panic sell-offs, giving traders time to reconsider their transactions. The regulatory filing that makes circuit breakers mandatory on United States stock exchanges is Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 80B.NYSE Market Guide. Trading Halts Due to Extraordinary Market Volatility. Rule 80B. Chicago, IL: Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, 2012. It is there that the specifics of circuit breakers are elaborated and the various price limits are outlined for investors to see. The most recently updated amendment of rule 80B went into effect on April 8, 2013, and has three tiers of thresholds that have different protocols for halting trading and closing the markets. At the start of each day, the NYSE sets three circuit breaker levels at levels of 7% (Level 1), 13% (Level 2) and 20% (Level 3). These thresholds are the percentage drops in value that the S&P; 500 Index would have to suffer in order for a trading halt to occur. Base price levels for which these thresholds will be applied are calculated daily based on the preceding trading day's closing value of the S&P; 500\\\\. Depending on the point drop that happens and the time of day when it happens, different actions occur automatically: Level 1 and Level 2 declines result in a 15-minute trading halt unless they occur after 3:25pm, when no trading halts apply. A Level 3 decline results in trading being suspended for the remainder of the day. Circuit breakers are also in effect on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and all subsidiary exchanges where the same thresholds that the NYSE has are applied to equity index futures trading. However, there is a CME specific price limit that prevents 5% increases and decreases in price during after hours trading. Base prices for which the percentage thresholds are applied are derived from the weighted average price on the future during the preceding trading day's last thirty seconds of trading. Price limits for equity index and foreign exchange futures are posted on the CME website at the close of each trading session. There is a security specific circuit breaker system, similar to the market wide system, that is known as the \\"Limit Up - Limit Down Plan\\" (LULD). This LULD system succeeds the previous system that only prevented dramatic losses, but not speculative gains, in a short amount of time. This rule is in place to combat security specific volatility as opposed to market wide volatility. The thresholds for a trading halt on an individual security are as follows. Each percentage change in value has to occur within a 5-minute window in order for a trading halt to be enacted: * 10% change in value of any security that is included in the S&P; 500 index, the Russell 1000 index, and the Invesco PowerShares QQQ ETF. * 30% change in value of any security that has a price equal to or greater than $1 * 50% change in value of any security that has a price less than $1 The previous trading day's closing price is used to determine which price range a specific security falls into.NYSE Market Guide. Limit Up - Limit Down Plan and Trading Pauses in Individual Securities Due to Extraordinary Market Volatility. Rule 80C. Chicago, IL: Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, 2013.  Founding  Following the stock market crash on October 19, 1987, the United States President Ronald Reagan assembled a Task Force on Market Mechanisms, known as the Brady Commission, to investigate the causes of the crash. The Brady Commission's report had four main findings, one of which stated that whatever regulatory agency was chosen to monitor equity markets should be responsible for designing and implementing price limit systems known as circuit breakers. The original intent of circuit breakers was not to prevent dramatic but fair price swings, rather to allow time for sufficient communication between traders and specialists. In the days leading up to the crash, price swings were dramatic but not crisis-like. However, on Black Monday the crash was caused by lack of information flow through the markets among other discrepancies such as lack of uniform margin trading rules across different markets.Greenwald, Bruce, and Jeremy Stein. \\"The Task Force Report: The Reasoning Behind the Recommendations\\". The Journal of Economic Perspectives 2.3 (1988): 3‚Äì23. Web...  Instances of use  On October 27, 1997, under the trading curb rules then in effect, trading at the New York Stock Exchange was halted early after the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 550 points. This was the first time US stock markets had closed early due to trading curbs. Since then, circuit breakers have evolved from a Dow Jones Industrial Average points-based system into a percentage change system that tracks the S&P; 500\\\\. Then SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. believes this use was unnecessary, and that market price levels had increased so much since circuit breakers were implemented that the point based system triggered a halt for a decline that was not considered a crisis. Some, like Robert R. Glauber, suggested in the aftermath of the circuit breaker tripping that trigger points be increased, and automatically reset by formula on an annual basis. On March 9, 2020, the Dow Jones fell by 7.79% (2,013 points) on fears of the COVID-19 coronavirus and falling oil prices, and the S&P; 500 triggered a market shutdown for 15 minutes just moments after opening. Three days later on March 12 and again on March 16 early trading again tripped the level-1 circuit breaker when the markets dropped over 7%. On March 18 the breaker was triggered again at one in the afternoon, several hours after trading opened. Program trading curbs The NYSE formerly implemented a curb on program trading under certain conditions. A program trade is defined by the NYSE as a basket of stocks from the S&P; 500 where there are at least 15 stocks or where the value of the basket is at least $1 million. Such trades are generally automated. When activated, the curbs restricted program trades to sell on upticks and buy only on downticks. The trading curbs would become activated whenever the NYSE Composite Index moved 190 points or the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 2% from its previous close. They remained in place for the rest of the trading day or until the NYSE Composite Index moved to within 90 points or the Dow moved within 1% of the previous close. Since over 50% of all trades on the NYSE are program trades, this curb was supposed to limit volatility by mitigating the ability of automated trades to drive stock prices down via positive feedback. This curb was fairly common, and financial television networks such as CNBC often referred to it with the term \\"curbs in\\". On November 7, 2007, the NYSE confirmed that the exchange has scrapped this rule from November 2, 2007. The reason given for the rule's elimination was its ineffectiveness in its purpose of curbing market volatility since it was enacted in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash under the belief that it may help prevent another catastrophic market crash. Japan In Japan, stock trading will be halted in cases where the criteria for the circuit breaker trigger are met. The trading halt time is 10 minutes. China A \\"circuit- breaker\\" mechanism began a test run on January 1, 2016. If the CSI 300 Index rises or falls by 5% before 14:45 (15 minutes before normal closing), stock trading will halt for 15 minutes. If it happens after 14:45 or the Index change reaches 7% at any time, trading will close immediately for the day. \\"Full breaking\\" was triggered on January 4 and 7, 2016. From January 8, use of the circuit-breaker was suspended. Philippines The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) adopted a circuit breaker mechanism in September 2008. Under the mechanism stock trading could be halted for 15 minutes if the (PSE) falls at least 10% based on the previous day's closing index value. Trading could only be halted once per market session and the minimum 10% decline should not occur 30 minutes prior to noon or the trade closing. Trading has only be halted twice; the first being October 27, 2008 during a global financial crisis which saw the PSE index falling 10.33% and March 12, 2020 as a result of the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  Effectiveness  Though the purpose behind circuit breakers is to stop trading so that traders can take time to think and digest new information, there are a lot of tested theories that show trading volume actually increases as price levels approach a circuit breaker threshold, and trading after a halt completes lays the groundwork for even more volatile market conditions.  Magnet effect  The Journal of Financial Markets has published work specific to the use of circuit breakers and their effects on market activity. Researchers have developed what is known as the \\"magnet effect\\". This theory claims that the closer market levels come to a circuit breaker threshold, the more exacerbated the situation will become as traders will increase volume by unloading shares out of fear that they will be stuck in their positions if markets do stop trading.Michael A. Goldstein, Kenneth A. Kavajecz, \\"Trading Strategies During Circuit Breakers and Extreme Market Movements\\", Journal of Financial Markets, volume 7, issue 3, June 2004, pages 301-333 It is believed there was an institutional bias to circuit breakers, as all of the large banks, hedge funds, and even some pension funds had designated floor traders on the floor of the NYSE who can continue trading while the markets are closed to the average investor. This argument is becoming less relevant over time as the use of floor traders diminishes and the majority of trading is done by computer generated algorithms.  Price discovery  Price discovery as it relates to equities is the process in which a security's market value is determined by way of buyers and sellers agreeing on a price suitable enough for a transaction to take place.Robert A. Schwartz, Reto Francioni, Equity Markets in Action: The Fundamentals of Liquidity, Market Structure & Trading, John Wiley and Sons, 2004 On the New York Stock Exchange alone, it is not uncommon for over $1.5 trillion of stocks to be traded in a single day. Due to the large amount of transactions that take place every day, experienced traders, and computer using algorithmic trading make trades based on the slightest up-ticks and down-ticks in price, and subtle changes in the bid‚Äìask spread.Lee, Charles M. C., Mark J. Ready, and Paul J. Seguin. \\"Volume, Volatility, And New York Stock Exchange Trading Halts\\". Journal of Finance 49.1 (1994): 183-214. When trading halts for any amount of time, the flow of information is reduced due to a lack of market activity, adversely causing larger than normal bid-ask spreads that slows down the price discovery process. When stock specific trading halts occur in order for press releases to be announced, the market has to then make a very quick assessment of how the new information affects the value of the underlying asset leading to abnormal trading volume and volatility.

The mascot, King Russet, is a Russet Burbank potato (the variety most commonly grown in the area) with a scepter and crown. The approximately 600 students, called Russets, receive two weeks of break in late September because some of them work in the local potato harvest. The school has done well academically. For example, the 10th grade student body surpassed the state averages on the 2011 Idaho Standards Achievement Test in language, reading, and math. The class sizes (about 20 students per teacher) are a little above the state average of 18. Shelley Senior High School has many sports teams including Basketball, Softball, Baseball, Football, Wrestling, Track, Golf, Cheer, and Soccer. Despite its small size, the high school has won several state football championships in its division, including the 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2013 championships. The school also has many clubs including FFA, Key Club, Drama, BPA, Speech & Debate, and Art Club.

(1 July 1789 - 2 February 1875), was a distinguished French maker of pianos and harps in the early 19th century. Pape was born in Sarstedt, Germany, in 1789. He arrived in Paris in 1811 and secured employment with Pleyel, whose piano workshops he directed for several years. In 1815, he established his own manufacture of pianos, and almost annually for nearly forty years improved them with new inventions. His first grand pianos followed the English system of Broadwood and Tomkinson, though endowed with mechanical genius it was not long before he modified, then completely changed their principles of construction. Pape concentrated on defects in square and grand pianos caused by the structural gap between the sounding board and wrest plank allowing the hammers to strike the strings; the solution of placing actions above the strings had been imagined by Marius, then Hildebrand and finally Streicher in Vienna, but instead of levers and counterweights Pape's arrangement used a coil spring to raise the hammers quickly and with almost no effect on touch. This system was very successful in squares but lacked some lightness and delicacy in grand pianos. The variations he introduced in the forms and actions of upright pianos gave his instruments remarkable power. The work of this skilled maker was rewarded by favourable reports of his instruments from the Soci√©t√© d‚Äôencouragement pour l‚Äôindustrie nationale on 19 September 1832 and from l'Acad√©mie des beaux-arts de l'institut de France in 1833, and he earned a gold medal at the French Industrial Exposition of 1834, as well as a medal of the Legion of Honor in 1839. Skilled in every aspect of mechanics, Pape invented a machine used to saw wood or ivory in spirals, and exhibited its results in 1827. One of his pianos was veneered with sheets of ivory nine feet long and two feet wide. A small pamphlet commemorated his contributions to the instrument (Notice sur les inventions et perfectionnements apportes par H. Pape dans la fabrication des pianos, Paris: Loquin: 11 pages with three lithographic plates). Piano hammers Pape could not cope with the increasing industrialisation in the production of pianos. When he died in 1875 in the Paris suburb of Asni√®res-sur-Seine, where he had continued research into the construction of the instrument, he was impoverished.Catherine Michaud- Pradeilles: \\"Pape, Johann Heinrich\\", in: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), biographical part, vol. 13 (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 2005), cc. 91‚Äì92.

The manga was serialized in Ribon Magazine from January 1995 to June 1996, and subsequently collected into four bound volumes published by Shueisha. The story follows Ririka Moriya, an elementary school student who receives the power to transform into the legendary guardian, Nurse Angel. As Nurse Angel, she is the only person capable of protecting the Earth from world-destroying invaders. NAS and TV Tokyo produced a 35-episode anime television series based on the manga. The animation for the series was handled by Studio Gallop. The show aired on TV Tokyo affiliates from July 1995 to March 1996. Additional media produced include novelizations and a theatrical musical that aired in digest form in the show's time slot after its conclusion. Plot Ririka Moriya is a bubbly, clumsy 4th grader who has a crush on Nozomu Kano, a transfer student from England. On her 10th birthday, Nozomu gives her a magical nurse cap, which allows Ririka to transform into the heavenly guardian, Nurse Angel. Nozomu later tells her that his real name is Kanon, and he comes from the planet Queen Earth, which has been overrun by the evil Dark Joker Organization, who has tarnished Nozomu's world through mass pollution. He was sent to find the legendary Nurse Angel, who would save both Earth and Queen Earth from destruction by finding the Flower of Life (ÂëΩ„ÅÆËä± Inochi no Hana). With help from Nozomu and her friend and neighbor Seiya Uzaki, Ririka learns to fight as Nurse Angel to protect her friends. Characters=Main charactersRirika Moriya= * (Japanese), Giusy Di Martino (Italian), Kathryn Bernardo (Tagalog) : is a cheerful, outgoing girl who wants to be a nurse when she grows up. She is a 4th grade student at White Dove Academy (ÁôΩÈ≥©Â≠¶Âúí), a school of some repute. Ririka lives in a household of five, including her parents, grandmother, and her little brother. In the course of the series a dog, Herb, joins the family. She loves Kano-senpai. However, love to her of Seiya is not noticed at all. : Ririka uses the magical phrase, \\"Holy Power, Holy Prayer, be here!\\" to transform into Nurse Angel. In the manga she both says this line and places the nurse cap on her head, while in the anime the cap simply appears. Ririka seems to become somewhat older after she transforms. Her hair is longer, and she has a more serious demeanor. Nurse Angel's primary weapon is a baton, and she can perform a wide variety of energy attacks. Her source of power for these attacks is a powerful healing agent called Green Vaccine, which is made from the Flower of Life. In the anime, she has a finite supply of Green Vaccine, and once it is gone there is very little she can do as Nurse Angel. =Seiya Uzaki= * (Japanese), Patrizio Prata (Italian), Joshua Dionisio (Tagalog) : is Ririka's next-door neighbor and her childhood friend, is the son of a doctor, and aspires to follow in his father's footsteps. He is about the same age as Ririka, and in the same 4th grade class. Though he is not good at study and is the mood maker of the class, the turn of the head is fast. He is very much the mischievous young boy - he likes video games, playing sports, and teasing Ririka. On the other hand, he is honest with himself about his affection for Ririka, and will go to any length to protect her. While in the beginning of the series Ririka and Kan≈ç-senpai hide their secret war from Seiya, he eventually finds out and is entrusted with power and a mission by Kanon and succeeds him and becomes Nurse Angel's number one supporter and grows up manlily. He uses Psionics and, his clothes do not change into a Battle costume. He uses a boomerang in the manga, has put on clothes of the Queen Earth only once. Seiya is the source of most of the show's one-liners and cool quotes. =Kanon= * (Japanese), Simone D'Andrea (Italian) : is an emissary from Queen Earth who was sent by Princess Helena to search for the Flower of Life and the legendary Nurse Angel. He a uses sword and Psionics. In his earthly disguise, , he is a 6th grader at White Dove Academy. Kanon becomes Ririka's mentor after she accepts her duty as Nurse Angel, but he doubts whether she is capable of managing that task without him. In the anime he is a serious, duty-bound character - he rarely smiles, and mostly only at Ririka. Kanon was undermined in Black Vaccine and knows that one's life is short and One's Psionics is given to Seiya in hopes to defend Ririka and he suffers a fatal injury by Keto and refuses treatment of Green Vaccine and dies. He is later resurrected by Dark Joker and fights Nurse Angel, but she turns him back and he returns to Queen Earth and Princess Helena. Secondary CharactersPrincess Helena= * : is the Queen Earth royal who sent Kanon to Earth in search of Nurse Angel, and occasionally supports Ririka by using telepathy. The state of Queen Earth is reflected in Helena, and thus she is gravely ill. Kanon is a childhood friend and her lover.

Karin has made it her purpose in life to visit popular eateries that are staffed by \\"cool guys.\\" =Anna Kazami= * (Japanese), Renata Bertolas (Italian) : is Ririka's other close friend and classmate. She is in many ways the opposite of Karin; always speaking in a very polite fashion even to her friends. Together with Karin, she gives Ririka (and sometimes Seiya) relationship advice. =Miyuki Kuwano= * (Japanese), Emanuela Pacotto (Italian) : is a 4th grader at White Dove Academy and the daughter of the head of Kuwano General Hospital. Though she often boasts of that, however, she feels lonely that her father can rarely care of her because of his job. She has a strong dislike of dogs. : She also has formed a shin'eitai (Ë¶™Ë°õÈöä - fan club/official guard) for Kan≈ç with a couple of her flunkies. Because Senpai and Ririka are intimate with each other, she is ignored. She approach Senpai single-mindedly. Making atmosphere of the sacred school into pride, she often turn on Ririka and Seiya spoiling the atmosphere and she calls Ririka a \\"barbarian\\". However, she likes Ririka on some pretext or other. She is a girl with whom power overflows who never kicks rivals down by using unfair means. =Mimina= * : is Princess Helena's younger sister, who decides to come to Earth posing as Kan≈ç's little sister in order to chastise Ririka for not doing a good enough job. Mimina develops a crush on Seiya much to his (and Ririka's) dismay . In the anime Mimina is accompanied by Maruru, who serves as her advisor/servant. =Maruru= * : is a creature from Queen Earth that resembles a stuffed animal. =Dewey= * (Japanese), Davide Garbolino (Italian) : is a former member of Dark Joker who was betrayed by Bross. Dewey is a skilled swordsman who seemed to be about the same age as Kanon, and thinks of the battle for Earth in the terms of a game. He prefers simple contests of might over elaborate schemes, and is a bitter rival with Keto. After being betrayed, he is saved by Ririka with one of her few remaining Green Vaccines, and he subsequently returns the favor by destroying the container containing Black Vaccine in Bross' Castle, and returning it to Ririka. He gradually warms up to Ririka and Seiya, and the people surrounding him, becoming a reassuring companion who fights with Ririka and Seiya against the Dark Joker. =\\"Inch≈ç\\" Akasegawa= * (Japanese), Antonio Paiola (Italy) : is a comical anime-only inpatient at Uzaki Hospital. He has been hospitalized for so long he has the nickname Inch≈ç, or Inpatient Chief. Despite this, he seems to be in very good health. =\\"Shijin\\" Nishitokorozawa= * : is an anime-only hospital inpatient. He earned his nickname because he tends to wax poetic...or more often than not, melodramatic. Long-haired and a bit too thin, he is the very image of a starving artist. =\\"Great\\" Yamazaki= * is the third member of the anime- exclusive inpatient trio. He is a beefy fellow who is often seen with a barbell in one hand and an IV stand in the other. His nickname seems to be inspired by his tough-guy talk, but he's in actual fact a coward. Dark JokerBross= * (Japanese), Marco Balzarotti (Italian) : is the leader of Dark Joker. He is remorseless and an imposing being who dwells in a strange, amorphous palace in Earth's orbit. Buros' goal is to eliminate all life in the universe. =Keto= * (Japanese), Claudio Moneta (Italian) : is one of Buros' lackeys. He is a plotter, often employing disguises and taking advantage of innocents in order to catch his enemies off-guard. He is often accompanied by a black cat, and is dedicated to winning Buros' favor by outdoing Dewey. =Legi= : is a manga-only character who is Buros' younger brother. He is handsome, and a bit of a casanova. Musical For three weeks after the anime completed, footage of the Nurse Angel Ririka SOS musical was shown in its timeslot.

It serves the Canton, Ohio radio market. WDJQ is owned by the family company of Don Peterson, the former publisher of the Alliance Review newspaper, and is co-owned with AM station WDPN. History The station originally signed on as WFAH at 101.7 MHz in 1947. One of the oldest established FM stations in the entire region, it served as the FM complement to WFAH (established 1953), now known as WDPN; the call sign was modified to WFAH-FM with the launch of the AM station. Both stations were founded by Arthur Hoiles, with the callsign being a tribute to his father, Frank Austin Hoiles (FAH). WFAH-FM moved to 92.5 in 1968 upon the establishment of WJER-FM Dover, Ohio on 101.7. (92.5 had been WAND-FM Canton from 1948-early 1950s) WFAH-FM switched to a Top 40 (CHR) format as WDJQ on January 1, 1980; the calls selected because the names of the station owners began with the letters D and J (Don and Josephine (Hoiles) Peterson) as did their children (Don Jr. and Jill). The \\"Q\\" rhymed with the dial position 92, hence the \\"Q92\\" moniker. In the late 1980s, the station was involved in a ratings controversy where Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania based WLTJ sued Arbitron claiming that listeners to 92.5 were credited to WDJQ incorrectly due to overlap in the markets as defined by Arbitron. WDJQ became WZKL on March 13, 1992. Under the WZKL call letters, the station played oldies as \\"Kool 92\\" and later \\"Oldies 92.5\\", then a hot adult contemporary format as \\"Z-92.5 - Today's Music For All People\\" in January 2000. It once again became Top 40 (CHR) as \\"Q92\\" in September 2002, although there was no \\"Q\\" in the station's call letters. Previous attempts to reclaim the WDJQ call letters were unsuccessful, but on February 29, 2008, it was announced that the radio station had successfully obtained the WDJQ call sign, which took effect March 7, 2008.

Jostein Pedersen (born 11 August 1959 in D√∏nna) is a Norwegian musical journalist and reporter, television commentator and \\"music intelligencia\\". He was the Norwegian commentator to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1994, and from 1996 to 2006. Since then he has covered the Song Contest on VGs web TV channel. He lives in London, England. Career=Early career Pedersen began his career in the music industry already in his late teens. He initially worked as a regular vendor at the local record shop, but slowly moved up in the system, eventually becoming a successful music journalist. From journalism, he advanced to become a disc jockey at local radio stations, before joining a new record company, Non Stop Music, where he sold records for new and more experienced artists, including popular rock icon √Öge Aleksandersen and the woman who later became the best selling female artist of Norway, Sissel Kyrkjeb√∏. Pedersen had first real breakthrough when Norway's only national radio broadcaster at that time, NRK, approached him about a new project which at that time was completely new in Norway; radioshows at night hours. Soon he was head-hunted once again and started working in one of Norwegian radio history's most popular radio programmes ‚ÄîNitimen. He was the youngest member of the cast and he would later express that during these years he was in a constant state of happiness; it was a dream come true. Eurovision commentator After several years in radio he moved to television broadcasting in 1994, where he was responsible for the shows on TV during the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer during February 1994. Not long after the Olympics finished, Pedersen was hired as the new commentator for the Eurovision Song Contest, representing the Norwegian broadcaster, NRK, and it was for this role he would become famous in the following decade. While his British counterpart, radio legend Terry Wogan, was known to be biased against all the nations' entries, except the British ones, Pedersen became known for his \\"mean-spirited\\" comments on the Swedish entries and entrants, and kept up the long tradition of rivalry and sarcastic comments and jokes between Norway and Sweden. In 1995, he did not return to the contest, but he rejoined the following year, and ever since 1996, he has been a permanent ingredient in the popular, annual show, and has raised the level of entertainment several degrees since the old, bygone days. Beside his juicy and sometimes controversial remarks, he is also known for his dark and masculine, yet pleasant and tranquilizing voice, which has aided his rise in popularity. In 2004 and 05, he also joined as side commentator in the Melodi Grand Prix, the Norwegian Eurovision nationals. In 2006, NRK announced that it would not renew his contract for another year, and thus he would not be commenting the Eurovision. No reason for his departure was given, and it was announced that Per Sundnes would follow Pedersen as the new commentator. He would however not retire from the Contest completely, covering the finals live on his blog. In 2007, he joined national newspaper VGs new Eurovision broadcast, where he comments on the songs and artists, and he remains here today. Journalism In addition to his work with TV and radio, Pedersen has published four books: three non-fiction and one novel called \\"Stort\\" (Great) (1996). It caused a sensation in Norway and was dubbed \\"the Norwegian American Psycho\\" as it described the sex, drugs and rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll lifestyle of the 80s. It became an instant cult classic as soon after publishing it went out of print owing to the publisher‚Äôs bankruptcy. In later interviews Pedersen has refused to comment on the book, despite the fact it is hailed as ‚Äúa classic‚Äù and it figures in numerous dissertations. Currently it is a sought after item in second hand shops and antique dealers. His travelogue about English customs and ways of life called A Norwegian in London (En nordmann i London) (2005) was a success in his native Norway. He has written extensively about pop, rock and classical music since the early ‚Äò80s and is regarded as one of Norway‚Äôs leading authorities in either field. His website has an archive of more than 300 articles where there are also posted articles originally written for the gay and punk underground press. To the general public he is well known as a champion of Norwegian pop, rock and classical music both in radio, television and print. Alongside his Eurovision fame, he has produced and presented radio and TV profiles on both domestic and international stars. His programs never fail to gain good reviews and ratings and he has produced groundbreaking documentaries on major stars like Norwegians Wenche Myhre and Jahn Teigen and international stars like The Bee Gees and Julio Iglesias. Pedersen presented a weekly column London Calling for Norway‚Äôs most popular radio breakfast show Nitimen between 1997 and 2007. In the summers of 2007 and 2008 he was a runaway hit as the breakfast host in the NRK‚Äôs regional programs in the county of Nordland where he was born.

Together they formed a successful team for many years, with Wooldridge concentrating on investment and general business aspects while Ramo led research, development and engineering efforts. By 1948, Hughes had created its Aerospace Group to work with the newly created U.S. Air Force. The Air Force became concerned with developing management issues at Hughes, and Ramo and Wooldridge were particularly concerned when Howard Hughes avoided their attempts to discuss the problem. In September 1953, they jointly resigned, and within a week they formed the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation on September 16, 1953. In 1958, Ramo- Wooldridge merged with Thompson Products to form TRW, which carried on the success of its predecessor. It handled system engineering and technical direction for numerous Air Force projects. Wooldridge served as president of TRW until he retired in 1962. He returned to Caltech as a research associate and published several books about the physical processes underlying biology and intelligence, winning the AAAS-Westinghouse award for science writing in 1963. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He died of pneumonia on September 20, 2006 in Santa Barbara, California.

Penguin/Viking) The Map that Changed the World is a 2001 book by Simon Winchester about English geologist William Smith and his great achievement, the first geological map of England, Wales and southern Scotland. Smith's was the first national-scale geological map, and by far the most accurate of its time. His pivotal insights were that each local sequence of rock strata was a subsequence of a single universal sequence of strata and that these rock strata could be distinguished and traced for great distances by means of embedded fossilized organisms. Winchester's book narrates the intellectual context of the time, the development of Smith's ideas and how they contributed to the theory of evolution and more generally to a dawning realisation of the true age of the earth. The book describes the social, economic or industrial context for Smith's insights and work, such as the importance of coal mining and the transport of coal by means of canals, both of which were a stimulus to the study of geology and the means whereby Smith supported his research. Land owners wished to know if coal might be found on their holdings. Canal planning and construction depended on understanding the rock and soil along its route. Related topics, such as the founding of the Geological Society of London, are included. Smith's map was published by John Cary, a leading map publisher. Winchester describes the practice of publishing at the time as well as the system of debtor's prisons through his account of the sojourn of Smith in the King's Bench Prison. Book format details The Map that Changed the World was published in 2001 by Harper Collins, while Winchester retains the copyright. The first edition is illustrated by Soun Vannithone. It includes an extensive index, glossary of geological terms, recommended reading and (lengthy) acknowledgements, as well as many stippled images (of consistent style). The last numbered page is page 329. There are 16 chapters, and single clay paper sheet in the middle containing colour plates of Smith's famous map and a modern geological map for comparison. (Smith's map is less complete, but essentially in agreement with the modern map). An image of Smith's first table of strata, and first (circular) geological map are also included. Just after the contents section, there is a 5-page section giving extensive details on the illustrations (such as the names of the chapter heading fossils). Each chapter begins with an inset image of a fossil, and a large first Capital. The dust-cover of the book can be removed and unfolded to reveal a larger print of the map in question. The contents One: Escape on the Northbound Stage Two: A Land Awakening from Sleep Three: The Mystery of the Chedworth Bun Four: The Duke and the Baronet's Widow Five: A Light in the Underworld Six: The Slicing of Somerset Seven: The View from York Minster Eight: Notes from the Swan Nine: The Dictator in the Drawing Room Ten: The Great Map Conceived Eleven: A Jurassic Interlude Twelve: The Map That Changed the World Thirteen: An Ungentlemanly Act Fourteen: The Sale of the Century Fifteen: The Wrath of Leviathan Sixteen: The Lost and Found Man Seventeen: All Honor to the Doctor. Escape on a Northbound Stage A plausible but whimsical description of the day on which William Smith was let out of debtor's prison. It inducts the reader into the interpretation of the time and place to be held consistently throughout the book. Smith is described physically, as heavy-set balding and plain-looking, and emotionally as quitting London in disgust. He is leaving London with nothing other than his wife, nephew, and such possessions as they can carry. It is implied that these circumstances are the result of unjustified discrimination from the scientific elite. The chapter ends with a brief note that 12 years later the injustice was in some measure redressed. A Land Awakening from Sleep A description of the social circumstances of the time of the birth of Smith. It begins by emphasising that the date of 4004 BC, for the beginning of the world, computed from the genealogy tables of the Bible, was firmly accepted by most; the idea that the world was any older was considered implausible. Explanations based on Noah's flood were acceptable in scientific circles. But, in the year 1769, as Smith was born, James Watt was patenting a steam engine, cloth manufacture was improving, the postal service was viable. New technology and information was rapidly becoming available or even common-place. \\"William Smith appeared on the stage at a profoundly interesting moment: he was about to make it more so.\\" These claims by Winchester are inaccurate. Geologists had begun to recognize that the earth was old in the late 1600s. Archbishop Ussher's 4004 BC date for the Creation of the earth, along with similar estimates by Isaac Newton and other academics of the 17th century, was merely a historical footnote in academia by Smith's lifetime. In 1787, Scottish geologist James Hutton argued that the earth's age was immeasurable. Smith was in no way challenging the church or risking jail ‚Äì American paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould refuted such claims in his review of The Map That Changed the World. In fact, Smith's single-minded focus on recognizing layers made him rather late to realize that the earth was old. Additionally, Smith's focus on recognizing layers based on the fossils in them was not unique. Though he was especially thorough, similar work (especially on the mainland of Europe) around the same time independently cemented the principle that fossils change over time and can be reliably used to identify layers. Martin Rudwick's Earth's Deep History: How It Was Discovered and Why It Matters is perhaps the most accessible account of the development of geology in this time interval.

The human p110Œ± protein is encoded by the PIK3CA gene. Its role was uncovered by molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE).  Function  Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (also called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)) is composed of an 85 kDa regulatory subunit and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit. The protein encoded by this gene represents the catalytic subunit, which uses ATP to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns), PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. The involvement of p110Œ± in human cancer has been hypothesized since 1995. Support for this hypothesis came from genetic and functional studies, including the discovery of common activating PIK3CA missense mutations in common human tumors. It has been found to be oncogenic and is implicated in cervical cancers. PIK3CA mutations are present in over one-third of breast cancers, with enrichment in the luminal and in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive subtypes (HER2 +). The three hotspot mutation positions (GLU542, GLU545, and HIS1047) have been widely reported till date. While substantial preclinical data show an association with robust activation of the pathway and resistance to common therapies, clinical data do not indicate that such mutations are associated with high levels of pathway activation or with a poor prognosis. It is unknown whether the mutation predicts increased sensitivity to agents targeting the P3K pathway. PIK3CA participates in a complex interaction within the tumor microenvironment in this phenomenon.  Clinical characteristics  Due to the association between p110Œ± and cancer, it may be an appropriate drug target. Pharmaceutical companies are designing and characterizing potential p110Œ± isoform specific inhibitors. The presence of [a] PIK3CA mutation may predict response to aspirin therapy for colorectal cancer. Somatic activating mutations in PIK3CA are found in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and venous malformation. PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes brain disorders such as macrocephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and hemimegalencephaly. It is also associated with congenital, lipomatous overgrowth of vascular malformations, epidermal nevi and skeletal/spinal anomalies (CLOVES syndrome) and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH). The conditions are caused by heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) mutations.  Inhibition  All PI 3-kinases are inhibited by the drugs wortmannin and LY294002 but wortmannin shows better efficiency than LY294002 on the hotspot mutation positions.  Pharmacology  In September 2017 Copanlisib, inhibiting predominantly p110Œ± and p110Œ¥, got FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.

In 1931, Ben Badis founded the Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, which was a national grouping of many Islamic scholars in Algeria from many different and sometimes opposing perspectives and viewpoints. The Association would have later a great influence on Algerian Muslim politics up to the Algerian War of Independence. In the same period, it set up many institutions where thousands of Algerian children of Muslim parents were educated. The Association also published a monthly journal, the Al-Chihab and souheil Ben Badis contributed regularly to it between 1925 and his death in 1940. The journal informed its readers about the Association's ideas and thoughts on religious reform and spoke on other religious and political issues.  Early life  Abdelhamid Ben Badis was born in Constantine in 1889. His family were a prestigious family of ulama and notables that descended from the Berber Zirid dynasty, rulers of Ifriqiya. Ben Badis' grandfather Si Makki ben Badis (d. 1889), was a qadi. His father, Mu·∏•ammad Mustafa (b. 1868), was an adjunct judge and member the , the colonial parliament. Ben Badis grew up in a scholarly and religious household and as a result memorized the Quran at the age of thirteen. He was still very young when he was placed under the tutorship of Hamdan Lounissi. Lounissi had a significant influence on the youth of Ben Badis. Ben Badis never forgot Lounissi's counsel. Lounissi remarked to him \\"learn knowledge for the sake of knowledge, not for the office.\\" Lounissi was a stalwart defender of the rights of the Muslim inhabitants of Constantine. Lounissi extracted from young Ben Badis a promise to never enter into the service of France (the Colonial power in Algeria).  Pilgrimages and study  Abdelhamid Ben Badis (on the left)  At the Zeitouna University  In 1908, Ben Badis, decided to begin his first trip in order to advance his learning. He traveled to Tunis and enrolled at the Zeitouna University, which was, at the time, a great center of learning and knowledge, particularly in the Islamic fields of studies. At the Zeitouna University, Ben Badis horizons widened. He learned a great deal of the Islamic Sciences and Arabic Language. He met many scholars who left an indelible mark on his personality and his knowledge of Islam. The teachings of Sheik Mohammed Al-Nakhli convinced him on the need to purge Muslim communities of deviant or incorrect religious practices such as the cult of saints. Sheik Muhammed Al- Taher Ben Achour influenced Ben Badis in finding his appreciation of the splendor of the Arabic language. With Sheik Al-Bachir Safer, Ben Badis developed an interest in contemporary and past problems of Muslim communities, including finding a response to Western colonialism and dealing with its socioeconomic after-effects. In 1912, he was awarded a degree. He spent another year at the Zeituna University as a teacher.  Return to Algeria  In 1913, Ben Badis returned to Algeria and settled in Constantine. In the same city, he started teaching at al-jƒÅmi ø al-akh·∏çar (The Green mosque) in early 1914. In 1936, Ben Badis played a role in the founding of the \\"Algerian Muslim Congress\\" (CMA). This congress was disbanded the following year in the summer of 1937 and shortly after Ben Badis established and led another organization: the Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema. In addition to working against deviations in the correct practice of Islam, Ben Badis and his fellow members of the Association strove to save the Algerian culture from being eclipsed by French values and morals.Islamism in Algeria: A struggle between hope and agony - Council on Foreign Relations at https://www.cfr.org/ Ben Badis and other Islamic scholars resisted the suppression of Algerian patriots; working as a journalist during those years he regularly denounced fascist propaganda and anti-Semitic intrigues of the French occupiers. Ben Badis was one of the most prominent Algerian Islamic scholars. With the aid of his contemporaries and associates he criticized Maraboutic practices and had a great influence in the creation of an Islamic conservative subsection of Algerian society. On 16 April 1940, Ben badis died after a long struggle with diabetes. He was buried in the presence of 8000 people, including 1000 women.

It was significant as the site of Japan's first major pollution disaster in the 1880s and the scene of the 1907 miners riots. The pollution disaster led to the birth of the Japanese environmental movement and the 1897 Third Mine Pollution Prevention Order. The pollution incident also triggered changes in the mine's operations that played a role in the 1907 riots, which became part of a string of mining disputes in 1907. During World War Two the mine was worked by POW forced labour. History Copper deposits are recorded as having been discovered in the area around the year 1550, but exploitation did not begin until two local households received an official permit in 1610 to establish a mine. In 1611, copper from the site was presented to officials of the shogunate, and shortly thereafter, Ashio was officially listed as a copper mine belonging to the Tokugawa shogunate. Copper, including that produced at the Ashio mine, played an important role in the solidification of Tokugawa rule in the early part of the 1600s and later became Japan's chief metal export after 1685. Copper from the mine was used in the minting of Kan'ei Ts≈´h≈ç copper coins and was used in the roofing for the Shoganate's temple of Z≈çj≈ç-ji in Edo. At its peak, the mine produced about 1,200 tons annually, however, Japan's mining industry began to decline during the latter part of the Edo period and the Ashio mine was almost closed at the time of the Meiji restoration. It became privately owned in 1871 following the industrialization initiated by the Meiji restoration, by which time production had dropped to less than 150 tons per year. In 1877, however, it became the property of Furukawa Ichibei, who then used the financial backing of Shibusawa Eiichi and the finding of new veins of copper to modernized and expand the mine with modern technology and foreign mining engineering expertise. By the 1880s production had increased dramatically, reaching 2286 tons by 1884, which accounted for 26 percent of Japan's copper production. A year later, the mine was producing over nine million tons, and by the end of the century, it accounted for 40 percent of Japan's copper production. During the Meiji period, Arsenic trioxide became a major secondary product of the mine, and large amounts of sulfuric acid was also used for minerals extraction. In the aftermath of the Ashio Copper Mine Incident and the Mining Pollution Prevention Ordinance of 1897, the mine owners replaced their previous expansion-focused policy with a policy of stabilization and retrenchment. Over three days in February 1907, miners at the mine rioted over low wages and poor working conditions. Damage from the riot totaled over 283,000 yen. The Ashio mine's Excavation Department was closed in 1973, after centuries of mining and the introduction of foreign copper ore into the Japanese market.By this time, the total length of its tunnels and shaft had reached 1234 kilometers. Smelting business continued at the mine using imported ore until 1989. Afterwards, the site was used for the recycling industrial waste. In 1980, the \\"Ashio Copper Mine Sightseeing\\", a tourist attraction to convey the history the copper mine, and also the Furukawa Ashio History Museum were opened. In 2008, the Ashio Copper Mine received protection as a National Historic Site. Ashio Copper Mine Incident The is the name given to the environmental disaster that occurred as a result of the Ashio mining operations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The incident was Japan's first major pollution disaster, and has also been credited by historians as leading to the birth of the Japanese environmental movement.  The Incident  As the Ashio Copper Mine's production boomed in the 1870s and 1880s, people living downstream from the mine, along the Watarase and Tone rivers, began to notice changes in the area around them. Colonies of silkworms were eating mulberry leaves from near the mine and dying, and farmers had noticed changes in the color of the Watarase River as early as the 1870s--just as the copper mine was expanding. In addition, the river's fish population was plummeting, which put around 3000 fishermen in the area out of work. In addition, shoring up mine shafts, fueling steam engines and copper smelters, and building other facilities for the expanding mine required trees. This need for wood led to large-scale deforestation in the area, and meant that the towns downstream of the mines lost their flood protection. The first major flood came in 1890, and brought with it a new set of consequences not experienced from previous events. Instead of bringing a layer of silt that would help the next harvest, the 1890 flood brought silt contaminated by slag from the Ashio Copper Mine. This contaminated floodwater and silt destroyed all the vegetation it touched, rendered fields sterile, and caused workers in those fields to develop sores on their hands and feet. In 1896, a larger flood followed, causing still further environmental damage. In addition to the environmental damage, residents of the surrounding area also suffered multiple health issues, including sores where they came into contact with contaminated water or soil, chronic arsenic exposure, higher premature death rates, lower birth rates, and in the case of many women, trouble producing milk.  The Cause  At the same time as the environmental damage was occurring in the Watarase River valley, the Ashio Copper Mine was in the process of expanding and modernizing. The expansion in the 1880s and 1890s had brought electrification, which had brought telephones, all matter of mechanized technology, several kinds of separators and smelters--including a massive Bessemer smelter, a railway, and steam engines to haul the copper. In addition to technological developments, the mine also shifted from Tokugawa era processing methods to a process of mass extraction. Emissions from the new smelters included sulfur dioxide, which caused lung damage in people and created acid rain that poisoned land and animals; and arsenic, which caused all manner of health problems when ingested. The new processing methods caused additional problems: Mass extraction produced piles of slag, which rainwater ran through and absorbed chemicals from. This rainwater found its way into nearby rivers, and from there, into fields of crops which were then poisoned and suffocated.  The Initial Response  By the early 1890s, farmers and local politicians in the area surrounding the Ashio Copper Mine were becoming increasingly concerned with the pollution resulting from the mine. One of these local politicians was Shozo Tanaka, who had been elected to the National Diet in 1890. In 1891, after the disastrous 1890 flood, he gave a speech on the floor of the Diet calling on the government to close the mine because of the pollution. The government did not respond. In 1892, Tanaka challenged the government again, and the government responded that there were plans in place at the mine to minimize further pollution and declared the issued to be closed. In the meantime, the engineers at the mine responded to local concerns by using dynamite to blast the piles of slag that were the byproducts of the mine's mass extraction. Regardless of what they meant to do, the blasting resulted in even more toxic chemicals entering the environment.  Problems Continue and the Government Responds  In spite of promised plans to minimize pollution at the mine, environmental conditions in the vicinity of the Ashio Copper Mine continued to deteriorate. After additional severe flooding, local farmers petitioned minister of agriculture and commerce Enomoto Takeaki, as well as Japan's finance minister, for relief, but were dismissed. In February 1897, Tanaka delivered a speech questioning Enomoto's behavior, which gained him support from several notable figures. Then, in March, dissatisfied farmers marched on Tokyo twice, with the second march comprising 4,000 participants. The government was still slow to act, but it did act. After visiting the area surrounding the mine and seeing the damage for himself, Enomoto eventually created a Pollution Investigation Committee. He then resigned on December 28, 1897. The result of almost a decade of protest was the 1897 Third Mine Pollution Prevention Order, which ordered the Furukawa Corporation, the mine's owner, to take action to prevent further toxins from leaking into the Watarase River. In addition, the government, headed by ≈åkuma Shigenobu, put plans for reforestation of the area surrounding the Ashio Copper Mine.  The Aftermath  After the 1897 Third Mine Pollution Prevention Order, the response from the company caused miners at Ashio to fear that the order was threatening their jobs. Within four years of the passage of the 1897 order, Tanaka was complaining about the order as well. Having observed that the environmental damage in the area surrounding the mine had continued to increase in spite of the order, he continued to call for the mine to be closed. Through the beginning of 1901, Tanaka questioned the government's response to the incident several times in the Diet. Then, in a speech in March 1901, he called the government treasonous over its treatment of the mine incident. After resigning from the Diet, Tanaka attempted to deliver a letter of appeal directly to Emperor Meiji himself. While Tanaka was prevented from handing out the letter, its contents were published by national newspapers, helping to publicise the plight of residents, which prompted the government to act. However the problem did not immediately go away, and protests continued for some years. In 1902, another major flood occurred, but because of the Order, the floodwaters spread much less pollution than they had previously. In December of the same year, the creation of a basin to prevent further flood damage was discussed by the Japanese government's Pollution Prevention Committee. The location of this basin involved the destruction of the villages of Kawabe, Toshima, and Yanaka. While the villages fought the proposition for two years, it was put into place in 1904. The government began buying out farmers in Yanaka in early 1906 and the destruction process began in 1907 and was completed over the course of a few weeks. The basin that was created became 'Watarase Yusuichi Pond', which became a UNESCO Ramsar site in 2012. In 1911, the government passed the Factory Law which was Japan's first law to address industrial pollution.  The 1907 Ashio Riot  The 1907 Ashio Riot occurred February 4-6, 1907, involved pit miners who had been demanding higher wages, and targeted mostly infrastructure and low-level mining officials. The riot itself did result in higher wages and also triggered other strikes and riots in similar industries.  Background  Organization of the mine = The department with direct supervision over the pit miners was the Pits Department. The Pits Department was divided into four sections, three for the pits at Honzan, Ts≈´d≈ç, and Kodaki, and one for a survey office responsible for gathering statistics on the other three sections. Each mine pit was divided into three sections: extraction, dressing, and general affairs, each with its own supervisor. Within the pits themselves, they were divided into 7-8 districts, with one guard post for every one or two districts.  The Riot  February 4, 1907 = The riot began within the mine itself early on February 4, when a group of miners destroyed the foreman's cabin for sections 3 and 4 in the Ts≈´d≈ç mine pits. From there, more miners joined in and destroyed infrastructure in sections 1 and 2. Then, the miners began to leave the mine pits in groups and assembled in front of cabin at the entrance. Other miners who were still underground began to come above ground later in the afternoon, when they gathered in front of the Ts≈´d≈ç office and threw rocks at the windows through the evening, at which point the rioting ended for the day. Meanwhile, the local police asked the prefect-level police for help with the riot and ordered the miners' bosses to control their men. The police resorted to negotiating with the miners at a distance, and the bosses only watched the goings-on out of fear they would be attacked too. = February 5, 1907 = Early the next day, miners attacked the cabins at the Sunokobashi mine pits, threatened the staff there, and cut telephone lines. Meanwhile, a large group of miners also gathered at the Honzan Ariki mine pits, where the electric trucks in the mine were stopped and some officials in one of the underground section cabins were injured. The extent of the damage from the first two days of the riot included several cabins and barns, eight trucks, a few drills, and the injured officials. = February 6, 1907 = At the Honzan Ariki mine pits, miners destroyed the underground foremen's cabins early in the morning before moving aboveground in two groups. They targeted the offices at the mine pits, and then moved to the company store and two departments at the center of the Ashio Copper Mine, where they looted the store and broke windows and doors at the departments. When Mine Director Minami Teiz≈ç arrived later that morning, the miners attacked him. He managed to escape and hide while rioting miners attacked his house, but was attacked again when he tried to flee. He was then taken to the hospital and the miners left. At the same time, miners began to target company officials. The riot also spread to include bystanders who were more interested in the looting than the officials. By the late afternoon, the fuel warehouse was set on fire. Meanwhile, the local and prefecture-level police were unable to come up with a plan to respond to the riot, more police had been ordered to the area, and the prefecture's governor had requested military assistance in responding to the riot. The troops left for Ashio late on the 6th, and arrived in the afternoon the next day.  The Aftermath  February 7, 1907 = Three companies of troops arrived at Ashio after the riot had ended. Once they arrived, the local police began conducting searches through the miners' shacks in Hozan, which had been the center of the riots. Over the course of February 7 through February 9, authorities arrested 628 individuals, 182 of whom were prosecuted. = February 10, 1907 = On the afternoon of February 10, the pit managers at Hozan and Ts≈´d≈ç informed the miners' representatives that the company would be firing all miners at both pits and requiring them to submit requests for rehiring by the next day. After debate, the majority of the miners accepted the company's demand and submitted the requests. On the afternoon of February 12, the company announced who they were and were not rehiring. The majority of the miners were rehired. = Wage Increases = In the days after the mine resumed operations on February 13, miners at Kodaki, the only pits where rioting did not occur, became increasingly uneasy. They wanted to know why they were being affected by the riot's consequences if they had not participated. On February 26 the new mine director, Kond≈ç Rikusabur≈ç, informed the miners at Kodaki that they would be receiving bonuses for their non- involvement in the riot. On February 27 and 28, Kond≈ç Rikusabur≈ç visited the Hozan and Ts≈´d≈ç mine pits to inform the miners that wage increases were coming and bonuses would be paid to the miners who were not involved in the riot. The wage increases were officially announced on March 1 and involved an average raise of 19.4 percent for the miners and improved financial provisions for absences related to injury or illness. = Other Mining Disputes = The riot at the Ashio Copper Mine triggered a series of riots and strikes at other mines, including at the Horonai mine in May 1907, the Besshi mine in June 1907, and at others through July.

Background Brass plate commemorating the dedication of St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne on 24 April 1241 by Hugh de Pateshull, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. The church is named after Oswald of Northumbria. A brass plaque in the chapel on the south side of the church commemorates its dedication on 24 April 1241 by Hugh de Pateshull, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Architecturally, it dominates the small town with its 212-foot spire which was referred to by George Eliot as the \\"finest single spire in England\\". It is said to have been started in 1240A new and comprehensive gazetteer of England and Wales. James Bell. 1836 by Bishop Hugh de Pateshull. Construction probably lasted until the early 14th century. It replaced an earlier Saxon church, and possibly a second Norman one. (A Norman crypt was discovered during excavations in 1913.) From 1837 to 1840, it was restored by Lewis Nockalls Cottingham, and then in the 1870s by George Gilbert Scott, who added the battlements to the chancel. Until Ashbourne Hall was partially demolished, it and St Oswald's were the town's major monuments, standing at either end of the main street. The entrance to the hall's grounds continued the main street through high gates. What remains of the hall houses the local lending library and some unrelated offices. As they were before the 18th century when the Boothby's rebuilt and refurbished their home, St Oswald's and its tower are once again the major landmark, and the church is the town's main attraction. The church is a Grade I listed building. Stained glass There is much stained glass in the church and these include a Christopher Whall window dated 1905. It was given to the church by Mr and Mrs Peveril Turnbull of Sandybrook Hall and it commemorates their daughters who died in a local fire. The window consists of three lights and contains representations of the Martyr Saints, St Cecilia, St Monica and St Dorothea. St Cecilia is seen falling asleep to the sounds of celestial music; an exquisite symbol of death. Girls play the organ dressed in medieval clothes with flowers and crowns in their hair and the celestial city is visible in one panel, viewed through a thicket of thorns. Whall's signature on this stained glass was his own thumbprint.

In the north transept, the Cockaynes, and the Boothbys (who bought their home Ashbourne Hall in the early 18th century). In the south transept is the Bradbourne's chapel. These chapels contain funerary monuments which have contributed greatly to the church's renown. One in particular stands out; the Boothby monument to Penelope Boothby, daughter of Sir Brooke Boothby, 6th Baronet. It is an exquisite and highly realistic sculpture made from Carrara marble (Italian) in the form of a sleeping child. It is considered to be the masterpiece of the artist Thomas Banks, and was commissioned by Penelope's father. There is an inscription on the tomb from Dante, one in French, one in Latin. That in English reads \\"She was in form and intellect most exquisite. The unfortunate Parents ventured their all on this frail Bark. And the wreck was total.\\" Other monuments and inscriptions in the church recall the generations of Boothbys buried there. Sir Brooke Boothby was a minor poet, now known mainly for the sonnets which he wrote after his daughter's death ‚Äì \\"Sorrows Sacred to the Memory of Penelope\\", which was illustrated with engravings of pictures by Fuseli and Glover. During his life he published several times on the church's inscriptions. It was said that he never recovered from the loss of his daughter and he died in poverty in Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1824.

The common and scientific names of this large bird both commemorate the ornithologist Samuel Cabot III. Other common names include the Chinese tragopan and the yellow-bellied tragopan. The population is divided into two subspecies, of which the nominate race is found in the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, and T. c. guangxiensis is confined to northeastern Guangxi and southern Hunan. The IUCN has assessed it as being a \\"vulnerable species\\". Description Cabot's tragopan (male) Tragopan caboti - MHNT Cabot's tragopan is a plump ground-dwelling bird with relatively short legs. The male grows to a length of about and a weight of around while the female is about shorter and weighs around . The head of the male is black with reddish-orange streaks on either side and on the neck and similar-coloured bare skin on the cheeks and around the eye. Below the beak dangle blue and orange decorative, inflatable wattles and there are a pair of fleshy blue \\"horns\\" over the eyes. The upper parts of the body are reddish-brown, with large buff markings and the underparts are straw-coloured. The female is altogether a less-colourful bird. The head and upper parts are reddish-brown spotted with black and marked with triangular-shaped white patches and the underparts are greyish-brown with white markings. Distribution and habitat Cabot's tragopan is endemic to mountain ranges in southeastern China where it is present in the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi and Zhejiang. Its typical habitat is subtropical evergreen forest and other forests with a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees. Its altitudinal range is and it is also present above the treeline. Populations are fragmented as it has limited ability to disperse and seems not to move across gaps in forest cover of over . Behaviour Cabot's tragopan Cabot's tragopan feeds mostly on the ground, foraging for roots, shoots, buds, flowers, fruits and seeds. A favourite food is the fruit and leaves of Daphniphyllum macropodum, a small tree which is also used for roosting at night. Small invertebrates are also sometimes eaten. Breeding takes place in the spring and Cabot's tragopan has an elaborate courtship ritual. The nest is usually built off the ground in a fork in a tree and is made of grasses, mosses, feathers and leaves, but sometimes an empty nest of another bird species is used. A clutch of two to six eggs is laid and incubation is performed solely by the female. The eggs hatch in about twenty eight days and the female broods the young for two or three days after that. They then all leave the nest together, the chicks being able to fly soon after they hatch, and remain together for the winter, possibly joining with another family in a small group. Conservation status Cabot's tragopan is assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being a \\"vulnerable species\\". This is because it is estimated that there are fewer than ten thousand individuals and that the number of birds is decreasing. The main threat it faces are loss of habitat as natural forest is converted to agricultural land or plantations of conifers and bamboo. This reduces the availability of suitable nesting sites in the forks of trees, but it is hoped that the provision of artificial nesting platforms may help. The bird is present in some protected areas but these are mostly small. Illegal hunting still takes place in some areas.

They are currently members of the and play at Walmer Road. History The original Kirkley Football Club was established in 1886, and the first recorded game was a match against East Suffolk on 4 December at Crown Meadow.History Kirkley & Pakefield F.C. The club played several more matches before merging with East Suffolk to form Lowestoft Town the following year. However, following a trial for players in late 1889, a second Kirkley club was formed just over a year later in 1890, playing their first match on 15 November against Clifford House School. They originally played on a pitch at St Aubin's College, forming strong links with the college, whose headmaster employed several former Cambridge Blues as teachers. With several teachers playing for the club, they won the Suffolk Junior Cup in 1894. For a brief time the club became the dominant side in Lowestoft, reaching the semi-finals of the FA Amateur Cup in 1896‚Äì97. At the time Kirkley were playing in the North Suffolk League, and were champions in 1894‚Äì95 and 1896‚Äì97. In 1897 they were founder members of the Norfolk & Suffolk League, although they continued to play in the North Suffolk League as well. Despite finishing second-from-bottom of the Norfolk & Suffolk League in its inaugural season, they were runners-up in 1898‚Äì99.Norfolk & Suffolk League Non-League Matters After four consecutive losing appearances in the Suffolk Senior Cup final, the club won the trophy for the first time in 1900‚Äì01 and retained it the following year, a season in which they also won the North Suffolk League. They were runners-up in the Norfolk & Suffolk League again in 1903‚Äì04 and won the North Suffolk League title in 1905‚Äì06 and 1907‚Äì08. Plans to merge with Lowestoft at the end of the 1907‚Äì08 season due to financial difficulties were abandoned after the \\"Good Friday Fiasco\\", in which Lowestoft used reserve players in a league match against Kirkley in order to rest first team players for the cup matches between the two clubs. The following season saw the club retain the North Suffolk League title. In 1909 they also began playing in the East Anglian League. However, the club finished bottom of the table in 1911‚Äì12 and again in 1912‚Äì13.East Anglian League 1908‚Äì1964 Non-League Matters Their financial difficulties had continued, leading to the club disbanding at the end of the 1913‚Äì14 season, at a time when Stanley Rous was playing for the club. A third Kirkley was established during the 1919‚Äì20 season. They rejoined the East Anglian League in 1921 and were runners-up in 1922‚Äì23 before winning the league in 1923‚Äì24. They then returned to the Norfolk & Suffolk League for the 1924‚Äì25 season, in which they also won the Suffolk Senior Cup; the club's place in the East Anglan League was taken by the reserves. After merging with Waveney Athletic in 1929, the club became known as Kirkley & Waveney, although they reverted to the name Kirkley in 1932. In 1935 they merged with Lowestoft Town and ceased to exist again.History Lowestoft Town FC The modern Kirkley came into being in 1975 when Anglian Combination club Brooke Marine, who were linked to the Brooke Marine shipbuilders and playing at the Kirkley Recreation Ground on Walmer Road, applied to change their name to Kirkley Football Club. As the name was owned by Lowestoft Town, the club had to take the name Kirkley United in 1978. Under the new name they were Division Two champions in 1978‚Äì79, earning promotion to Division One. The following season the club won Division One and were promoted to the Premier Division.Anglian Combination 1964‚Äì2003 Non-League Matters However, after finishing second-from-bottom of the Premier Division in 1983‚Äì84 they were relegated back to Division One. After winning the Division One title in 1988‚Äì89 the club returned to the Premier Division. Kirkley were Premier Division champions in 1999‚Äì2000 and won the Suffolk Senior Cup the following season. In 2001‚Äì02 they claimed a treble, winning the Premier Division title, the league's Senior Knock-out Cup, and the Suffolk Senior Cup again, beating Haverhill Rovers 4‚Äì3 after extra time. In 2002‚Äì03 they won the Premier Division title for a third time in four years, and were promoted to Division One of the Eastern Counties League. The club were promoted to the Premier Division after finishing third in Division One in 2004‚Äì05. In 2007 they merged with Pakefield Football Club, adopting their current name. Ground After initially playing at St Aubin's College, the second Kirkley moved to the Kirkley Recreation Ground on Walmer Road in 1896 after the site was bought by several local businessmen for the club for ¬£746 17s 6d. The new ground was opened on 5 September 1896. Financial difficulties led to the club selling the ground to the Lowestoft Corporation for ¬£1,600 in the late 1900s, after which they moved to a ground on Carlton Road known as the Run. When the third version of Kirkley were established, they continued to play at the Run, before returning to the Kirkley Recreation Ground in the early 1920s. The modern Kirkley also played at the Recreation Ground, now more commonly known as Walmer Road. On 26 December 2005 the club played its first league match against Lowestoft Town since the 1934‚Äì35 season, attracting a record crowd of 1,125. The ground currently has a capacity of 2,000, of which 150 is seated and covered.

She was shot dead by the British Army in Gibraltar on 6 March 1988.Pg 300, T√≠rghr√°, National Commemoration Centre, 2002. PB) Early life Farrell was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland to a middle-class family with no link to militant Irish republicanism other than a grandfather who had been interned during the Irish War for Independence. She was educated at Rathmore Convent School, Belfast. Families at War: Voices from the Troubles, Peter Taylor, BBC Books, 1989, page 33 At the age of 14 she was recruited into the Provisional IRA by Bobby Storey. After leaving school at the age of 18, she was hired as a clerical worker for an insurance broker's office. First term of IRA activity, 1975‚Äì1976 On 1 March 1976, the British government revoked Special Category Status for prisoners convicted from this date under anti-terrorism legislation. In response, the IRA instigated a wave of bombings and shootings across Northern Ireland; younger members such as Farrell were asked to participate. On 5 April 1976, along with Kieran Doherty and Sean McDermott, she attempted to plant a bomb at the Conway Hotel in Dunmurry, as that hotel had often been used by British soldiers on temporary duty to Northern Ireland. She was arrested by Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers within an hour of planting the bomb. Her boyfriend, Sean McDermott, was shot dead by an RUC reservist at a nearby housing estate. McDermott and two other members of the IRA active service unit had broken into a home, not realising it was the private residence of a policeman. The RUC officer shot McDermott dead; Doherty and another man escaped.Lost Lives pp637-638 At her trial, she refused to recognise the court as it was an institution of the British state. She was sentenced to fourteen years in prison for explosives offences, firearms offences, and belonging to an illegal organisation. Imprisonment, 1976‚Äì1986 At Armagh prison, Farrell was the official Officer Commanding of the female IRA prisoners. When she arrived in Armagh, Farrell refused to wear a prison uniform in protest at the designation of republican prisoners as criminals. She was the first woman to do so, and the second person after Kieran Nugent, a prisoner in the H-Blocks of HMP Maze. Farrell instigated a dirty protest in February 1980. This meant that prisoners refused to slop-out and would smear excrement and menstrual material on the walls of their cells instead of risking being attacked by the guards while slopping out.\\"A very serious situation arose in Armagh Prison on 7 February 1980. There were serious allegations from the women that they were beaten by male officers. They then escalated their 'no work' protest to follow the example of the men in the H-Blocks, Long Kesh, in the 'No wash' 'No slop-out' protest. They were then locked up 23 hours a day in their cells. The soiled cells were left dirty for the first six months.\\" Hard Times, Armagh Gaol 1971‚Äì1986, Raymond Murray, Mercier Press, Dublin, 1998, After 13 months, Farrell, along with Mary Doyle and Mairead Nugent, began a hunger strike in Armagh prison to coincide with the one already taking place in Long Kesh. It ended on 19 December, a day after the men's strike. The dirty protest ended in March 1981 as the prisoners' rights campaign was focused on the hunger strike being undertaken by Bobby Sands, leader of IRA prisoners in the H-Blocks. She was one of the H-Block/Armagh prisoners to stand for election in the Republic of Ireland in the 1981 General Election, standing in Cork North Central and polling 2,751 votes (6.05%). Second phase of IRA activity and subsequent death Upon her release from prison in October 1986, Farrell enrolled at Queen's University, Belfast for a course in Political Science and Economics. However, she dropped out of university to re-engage in IRA activity. The IRA sent her with Sean Savage and Daniel McCann to the British overseas territory of Gibraltar to plant a car bomb in a heavily populated town area. The target was the band and guard of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment during a weekly ceremonial changing of the guard in front of Governors' residence, on 8 March 1988. According to interrogated IRA members, Gibraltar had been selected as a target because it was a British possession that was in dispute, and that it was an area with lighter security measures than at that time had become endemic at British military installations elsewhere due to the IRA's campaign. The British Government's domestic intelligence service MI5 had become aware of their plan, and a detachment from the British Army was specifically deployed to Gibraltar to intercept the IRA team and prevent the attack. Farrell, Savage and McCann were confronted by plainclothes soldiers from the Special Air Service Regiment whilst they were engaged in a reconnaissance in Gibraltar pending the delivery of the car bomb. Farrell was shot three times in the back and once in the face, her two accomplices were also killed in an operation code-named Operation Flavius by the British Government. Some witnesses to the shooting stated that Farrell and McCann had been shot while attempting to surrender, and while lying wounded on the ground. The three IRA members were all found afterwards to be unarmed. Keys to a hire car found in Farrell's handbag led the Spanish Police, who had closely worked with the British security services in Operation Flavius, to the discovery across the border in Spain of five packages totalling 84 kg of Semtex explosive in a car which the IRA team had intended to subsequently drive into Gibraltar for the attack. These packages had four separate detonators attached. Around this was packed 200 rounds of ammunition as shrapnel. There were two timers, marked 10 hrs 45 mins and 11 hrs 15 mins respectively, but they were not primed or connected. Gibraltar inquest At the inquest into the deaths held in Gibraltar the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing by a 9‚Äì2 majority. The coroner, in summing up the evidence to the jury, told them to avoid an open verdict. The 9‚Äì2 verdict is the smallest majority allowed. Paddy McGrory, lawyer for Amnesty International, believed that it had been a \\"perverse verdict,\\" and that it had gone against the weight of the evidence.State Violence: Northern Ireland 1969‚Äì1997, Raymond Murray, Mercier Press, Dublin, 1998, , pg. 203 Ms Proetta, an independent witness, told Thames Television, 'They [the security forces] didn't do anything ... they just went and shot these people. That's all. They didn't say anything, they didn't scream, they didn't shout, they didn't do anything. These people were turning their heads back to see what was happening and when they saw these men had guns in their hands they put their hands up. It looked like the man was protecting the girl because he stood in front of her, but there was no chance. I mean they went to the floor immediately, they dropped.'State Violence: Northern Ireland 1969‚Äì1997, Raymond Murray, Mercier Press, Dublin, 1998, , pg. 193 Stephen Bullock, a lawyer by profession, who was 150 metres from the shooting, and another independent witness saw Dan McCann falling backwards with his hands at shoulder height. At the inquest into the killings Bullock stated, 'I think with one step he could have actually touched the person he was shooting'.

The Windlesham/Rampton Report on Death on the Rock, p.92, par 85, Faber & Faber, London 1989. The scientific evidence provided by pathologist Professor Alan Watson also corroborated the evidence of Proetta, Bullock and a third witness, Josie Celecia. Five independent civil liberty organisations have criticised many aspects of the proceedings during the inquest, and have called for further inquiries into the killings in Gibraltar. They are the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Inquest the National Council for Civil Liberties (London), the International League for Human Rights (New York) and Amnesty International.State Violence: Northern Ireland 1969‚Äì1997, Raymond Murray, Mercier Press, Dublin, 1998, , pg. 201 The report by Amnesty International stated that the inquest had failed to answer 'the fundamental issue... whether the fatal shootings were caused by what happened in the street, or whether the authorities planned in advance for the three to be shot dead.'United Kingdom: Investigating Lethal Shootings: The Gibraltar Inquest: Summary, p. iii. Amnesty International, April 1989. European Court of Human Rights The relatives of McCann, Savage and Farrell were dissatisfied with the response to their case in the British legal system,State Violence: Northern Ireland 1969‚Äì1997, Raymond Murray, Mercier Press, Dublin, 1998, , pg. 191 so they took their case to the European Court of Human Rights in 1995. The court found that the three had been unlawfully killed. By a 10‚Äì9 majority it ruled that the human rights of the 'Gibraltar Three' had been infringed in breach of Article 2 ‚Äì right to life, of the European Convention on Human Rights and criticised the authorities for lack of appropriate care in the control and organisation of the arrest operation. > In sum, having regard to the decision not to prevent the suspects from > travelling into Gibraltar, to the failure of the authorities to make > sufficient allowances for the possibility that their intelligence > assessments might, in some respects at least, be erroneous and to the > automatic recourse to lethal force when the soldiers opened fire, the Court > is not persuaded that the killing of the three terrorists constituted the > use of force which was no more than absolutely necessary in defence of > persons from unlawful violence within the meaning of Article 2(2)(a) of the > Convention In the Judgement the court said that the actions of the authorities lacked 'the degree of caution in the use of firearms to be expected from law enforcement personnel in a democratic society.'European Court of Human Rights, Judgement, paragraph 212, Strasbourg, France, 27 September 1995State Violence: Northern Ireland 1969‚Äì1997, Raymond Murray, Mercier Press, Dublin, 1998, , pg. 204 Some newspapers reported the decision as a finding that the three had been unlawfully killed. The ECtHR also ruled that the three had been engaged in an act of terrorism, and consequently dismissed unanimously the applicants' claims for damages, for costs and expenses incurred in the Gibraltar Inquest and the remainder of the claims for just satisfaction. The Court is not empowered to overrule national decisions or annul national laws. Related events In the aftermath of the shooting on Gibraltar, violence escalated in the Belfast area and resulted in at least six further deaths. The three bodies were returned to Belfast on 14 March. That evening an IRA sniper, Kevin McCracken, was shot dead in Norglen Crescent, Turf Lodge, Belfast while preparing to attack British soldiers.Adams G (2003). Hope and History: Making Peace in Ireland Those attending the return of the bodies said that the security services were harassing themAn article In Republican News about the funerals and that he was attacking the security services to deflect their attention. According to witnesses, McCracken was beaten while lying wounded by members of the security services.Belfast Murals At the funeral of the 'Gibraltar Three' on 16 March, three mourners were killed in a gun and grenade attack by loyalist paramilitary Michael Stone in the Milltown Cemetery attack. At the funeral of IRA member Caoimh√≠n Mac Br√°daigh on 19 March ‚Äì one of the three men killed three days earlier by Michael Stone ‚Äì two British Army corporals, Derek Wood and David Howes, drove into the funeral cort√®ge, apparently by accident but mourners evidently feared an attack similar to Stone's was taking place. Scenes relayed on television showed the two corporals being cornered by black taxis and dragged from their car before being taken away to be beaten, stripped, and then executed. \\"Judges free man jailed over IRA funeral murders\\" The Daily Telegraph On 10 September 1990, the IRA attempted to kill Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Terry at his Staffordshire home. Terry had been a prime target since his days as Governor of Gibraltar, where he signed the documents allowing the SAS to pursue IRA members. The attack took place at 9 pm at the Main Road house. The gunman opened fire through a window hitting Sir Peter at least nine times and injuring his wife near one of her eyes. The couple's daughter was found to be suffering from shock. Terry's face had to be rebuilt as the shots shattered his face and two high-velocity bullets were within millimetres of his brain. A few months before she was killed, Farrell had been interviewed for the documentary Mother Ireland, directed by Anne Crilly, which was subsequently deemed untransmittable due to the 1988 broadcasting restrictions. Channel 4 eventually screened the documentary on 11 April 1991, with Farrell's voice having been de-dubbed to comply with the restrictions.TV Times, 6‚Äì12 April 1991, page 83 In 2008 Sinn F√©in asked to hold an International Women's Day event in the Long Gallery at Stormont commemorating Farrell. The Assembly Commission, which runs the Stormont estate, ruled that it could not go ahead. Media comment The New York Times, reviewing a Frontline documentary examining the circumstances of Farrell's death, stated: 'Mairead Farrell might be dismissed as some wild-eyed fanatic except that part of her life has been preserved in several home movies and a television interview taped shortly before her death. What emerges is a portrait of a soft-spoken, attractive woman determined to end what she perceived as the injustices surrounding her everyday life.... The program leaves us pondering the obvious conclusion: \\"To the people of Falls Road she was a patriot. To the British she was a terrorist. To her family she was a victim of Irish history.\\"' See also * Death on the Rock; a documentary about the shootings NotesFurther reading *Death of a Terrorist ‚Äì Frontline documentary. *Death on the Rock ‚Äì documentary about the shootings. *Murder on the Rock ‚Äì book about the shootings. *Relatives for Justice Site *Summary and full judgement by the ECtHR *Adams, G, Hope and History: Making Peace in Ireland, Brandon Books, 2003. *New York Times (June 13, 1989) review of the Frontline documentary, Death of a Terrorist Category:1957 births Category:1988 deaths Category:20th- century women from Northern Ireland Category:Deaths by firearm in Gibraltar Category:Irish republicans imprisoned on charges of terrorism Category:People educated at Rathmore Grammar School Category:People killed by security forces during The Troubles (Northern Ireland) Category:Provisional Irish Republican Army members Category:Women in 20th-century warfare Category:Women in European warfare ","title":"Mair√©ad Farrell"},{"id":"3774083","text":"Renco is a village in Masvingo Province, Zimbabwe and is located from Masvingo.

Her image inspired the paintings by Joshua Reynolds, Henry Fuseli, John Everett Millais, a sculpture by Thomas Banks, photographs of Lewis Carroll, sonnet of Brooke Boothby. According to art historians and historians, in the art of the 19th-20th centuries Penelope Boothby became a classic child of the Romantic era, the keeper of heavenly innocence, a symbol of ‚Äúwhat we have lost and what we are afraid to lose‚Äù. The image of Penelope was actively exploited by popular culture throughout the 20th century.  Biography  Joseph Wright (1734‚Äî1797). Sir Brooke Boothby, 1781 Thomas Banks. Tombstone of Penelope Boothby, 1793 Daughter of Sir Brooke Boothby (1744-1824), linguist, translator and poet. In the picture of Joseph Wright, he appears at the same time as a noble and extremely natural person: for a while laying aside the book he is reading and sitting down for reading right on the grass in the forest, he looks intently at the viewer (Boothby highly appreciated the ideas of Jean- Jacques Rousseau and was the translator of his works). Penelope's father inherited the title in 1789, was also an amateur botanist, and collaborated in his research with Erasmus Darwin. He was well acquainted with several activists of the Blue Stockings Society. and was known as a connoisseur of fine arts and philanthropist. Penelope was the only child and heiress of Sir Brooke Boothby and his wife, Susanna Bristoe (1755-1822). At the age of three (in July 1788) she became a model for the outstanding British artist Joshua Reynolds in his London studio (for the painting ‚ÄúPortrait of Penelope Boothby,‚Äù or ‚ÄúCap‚Äù, London National Gallery). Shortly after completing the portrait, Boothby and his daughter returned to Derbyshire, where his family estate Ashbourne was located. Penelope probably spent the rest of her short life at Ashbourne Hall. Penelope was a quiet girl who preferred playing with dolls in solitude to any noisy fuss, although she had a cheerful disposition. She loved her father very much and waited at the gates of his return home, and in the evenings sat on his lap. On Sundays in the morning, she accompanied her mother to the old Ashbourne church and knelt beside her during the service. All this and much more can be learned from the book ‚ÄúSorrows Sacred to the Memory of Penelope‚Äù, written by her father. The book includes 24 sonnets. She died in 1791 a month before her sixth birthday, after an illness that lasted about a month. She was unsuccessfully treated by Erasmus Darwin.

She was a wife of the Ukrainian academician of history and statesman Mykola Vasylenko. Life and career Polonska-Vasylenko studied history under Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapol'skiy at Kiev University and from 1912 was a member of the Kiev-based Historical Society of Nestor the Chronicler. From 1916, she was a lecturer at Kiev University and Director of its archeological museum. During the 1920s, the most liberal years of Soviet rule, she was a professor at the Kiev Institutes of Geography, Archeology, and Art, and a Research Associate at the All- Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (VUAN). She witnessed, but survived the Joseph Stalin purges of the 1930s and was a member of the reorganized and Sovietized academy from 1937 to 1941. In 1940, she received her doctorate and became a professor at Kiev University. During the German occupation, she directed the Kiev Central Archive of Old Documents and worked in Kiev City Administration, was responsible for renaming of streets and consulted Kiev Archive Museum of Transitional Period (dedicated to achievements of German occupation and crimes of Communists). As the tide of the war turned against the Germans, she fled west, first to Lviv, then to Prague, and finally to Bavaria. She was a Professor at the Ukrainian Free University in Prague (1944‚Äì45), and moved together with this institution to Munich where she continued to teach until her death in 1973. In the 1960s, she took an active part in the establishment of the American-Based Ukrainian Historical Association and was its Vice- president from 1965. Writings Polonska-Vasylenko was a specialist in Ukrainian archeology, the history of Kievan Rus', the later history of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, and the history of her own times. She also wrote extensively on modern Ukrainian historiography. Before the First World War, she participated in the compilation and writing of a large Russian cultural history atlas which was published in three volumes between 1913 and 1914. During the 1920s, she published extensively in the various periodicals of the Ukrainian Academy on the Zaporozhian Cossacks and the transformation and absorption of southern Ukraine into the Russian Empire during the reigns of Catherine the Great and her predecessors. During the Cold War, deprived of the use of the archives of her native land, Polonska-Vasylenko collected and reprinted many of her earlier studies on Zaporozhia (1965‚Äì67), wrote several memoirs of intellectual life in revolutionary and Soviet Ukraine including a history of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (2 vols. 1955-58), published a book on the Stalin repressions of Ukrainian historians (1962), and turned increasingly toward synthesis, at the end of her career, publishing a volume on Ukrainian historiography (1971) and a two volume general history of Ukraine (1973‚Äì1976). In her general approach to Ukrainian history, Polonska-Vasylenko followed the lead of her distinguished emigre predecessor, Dmytro Doroshenko, and wrote in a conservative vain, stressing the importance of the Cossack officer class and the Ukrainian gentry into which they were later transformed. She saw the strivings of this class for national unity and independence, or, at least autonomy, as one of the main currents of Ukrainian history, and she characterized the nineteenth century as a time of Russian and Austrian occupation. She ended her general history with the advent of Soviet rule. Legacy Through her teaching at the Ukrainian Free University and her many publications, Polonska-Vasylenko influenced several younger Ukrainian historians in the west, especially the founder of the Ukrainian Historical Association, Lubomyr Wynar. After the proclamation of Ukrainian independence in 1991 and the subsequent growth of intellectual freedom, her major works, including her history of the Ukrainian Academy and her general history of Ukraine were reprinted in her homeland where she finally became widely known.

Commissioned late in the war, she was initially assigned to transport duties and consequently did not participate in combat operations. Geneva was named after a county in Alabama. She was launched under Maritime Commission contract 31 January 1945 by Consolidated Steel at Wilmington, California; acquired by the Navy 21 March 1945 and commissioned the following day, Comdr. Peter J. Neimo in command. Operational history=World War II Following shakedown out of San Diego, Geneva departed that port 19 May 1945 with over 500 marines and sailors for Pearl Harbor and Majuro atoll, Marshall Islands, where she arrived 7 June. After embarking marines and Japanese prisoners of war, she picked up additional passengers at Kwajalein for passage to Pearl Harbor. At Pearl Harbor, she picked up veterans whom she landed at San Francisco 27 June. Proceeding to Seattle, she embarked nearly a thousand soldiers for the garrison forces on Okinawa, debarking them at Buckner Bay 12 August. After hostilities Geneva sailed from Okinawa 5 September for Korea and landed Army units at Inchon 8 September. She returned to Okinawa 15 September, weathered a typhoon, and embarked the 11th Artillery Regiment of the 4th Marine Battalion and their cargo for passage to Taku, China, where she arrived 5 October. There she received 21 European repatriates on board, embarked 302 others at Tsingtao (now Qingdao) 7 October, and carried her passengers to Hong Kong on the 13th. These 302 passengers were also European repatriates, mostly British, who had spent between three and four years in various Japanese concentration camps. They had been rescued from the Weihsien Civil Assembly Centre at what is now Weifang city, Shandong Province, on 17 August 1945 by 7 US paratroopers of the Duck Mission, only two days after VJ Day. In Hong Kong the passengers were handed over to the British forces, and repatriated to their home countries in the next few months by RAPWI. On this passage, when the Geneva had to skirt the outside of the Island of Taiwan, then Formosa, because the Formosa Straights had not yet been swept for mines, she struck an even worse typhoon on 9 October 1945, which virtually destroyed the US base at Okinawa. She had a destroyer escort ahead of her, but the waves meant they only caught sight each other every five or ten minutes. By the grace of God both survived. At Hong Kong, she received Chinese troops and equipment, transported them to Chinwangtao 30 October, and returned to Hong Kong to embark more Chinese troops for passage to Tsingtao, arriving 14 November. Geneva departed Tsingtao on 23 November, embarked over a thousand homeward- bound veterans at Luzon, Philippines, and reached San Francisco 19 December. On 11 January 1946, she began a troop-transport voyage from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor and returned to San Diego 7 February. Operation Crossroads The attack transport returned to Pearl Harbor 2 March for training in the Hawaiian area until she departed 17 May to serve in Operation Crossroads, a joint atomic bomb experiment of the Army and Navy in the Marshall Islands at Bikini Atoll. More than 200 ships, 150 aircraft, and some 42,000 men were involved in this vast experiment directed by Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy. Seventy-five target ships - American, German, and Japanese - were moored in the target area. Geneva arrived off Bikini on 30 May 1946 and rode at anchor for a month. Her crew then transferred to since Geneva was to be one of the target ships in \\"Test Able\\" on the morning of 1 July 1946 when the fourth atomic bomb to be exploded and the first ever detonated over water was to be dropped from a B-29. The attack transport survived the explosion and the huge column of water and steam that rose to and formed a mushroom-shaped cloud. Geneva was declared free of radioactivity the following day. She also survived \`'Test Baker\\" 25 July. That morning at 0835 an atomic bomb suspended below LSM-60 was exploded - the first to be detonated under water. Geneva was in normal operation 4 days after that explosion, steaming to Kwajalein 25 August, then proceeding via Hawaii to San Francisco, where she arrived 5 November. Decommission Geneva departed San Francisco on 4 December, touched San Diego and transited the Panama Canal for Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on the 27th. She was decommissioned at Norfolk 23 January 1947, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 25 February. She was returned to the Maritime Commission on 2 April and joined the National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia. Geneva was transferred to Wilmington, North Carolina, in July 1955 and sold for scrap by the Maritime Administration on 2 November 1966.

The Kinkaid Act of 1904 (ch. 1801, , Apr. 28, 1904, ) is a U.S. statute that amended the 1862 Homestead Act so that one section (1 mi2, 2.6 km2, 640 acres) of public domain land could be acquired free of charge, apart from a modest filing fee. It applied specifically to 37 counties in northwest Nebraska, in the general area of the Nebraska Sandhills. The act was introduced by Moses Kinkaid, Nebraska's 6th congressional district representative, was signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt on April 28, 1904 and went into effect on June 28 of that year. Provisions The legal provisions of the Kinkaid Act were very similar to those of the Homestead Act. A claimant had to be at least 21 years of age (or 18 if the head of a household), and a current U.S. citizen or in the process of becoming a citizen. Five years of residency was required to gain title to a claim, with exceptions made to account for years of military service. In 1912 the residency requirement was shortened to three years, in order to attract more settlers. A claimant also had to prove that improvements equivalent to $1.25 per acre had been made to the property. Only non-irrigable lands were eligible to be claimed under the provisions of the Kinkaid Act; those that were deemed to be practicably irrigable by the Secretary of the Interior were excluded. A 640-acre claim was required to be as compact as possible, and less than two miles in length. A homesteader who already held land in the area at the time of enactment could accumulate additional surrounding available territory in order to acquire a total homestead unit of 640 acres. Commutation (paying cash instead of occupying a claim for the full five years, which had been permitted under the 1862 Homestead Act) was not allowed under the Kinkaid Act.\\"U.S. Government Land Laws in Nebraska, 1854-1904\\". Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 2012-11-26. Claimants of land under the provisions of the Kinkaid Act were generally referred to as \\"Kinkaiders.\\" The Kinkaid Act was repealed on October 21, 1976 (Pub. L. 94‚Äì579, title VII, ¬ß 702, Oct. 21, 1976, 90 Stat. 2787). The final patent was issued in 1941 on of land.  Background  Spade Ranch brand The economy of the Nebraska Sandhills region in the late 19th century was dominated by the cattle ranching industry. Large ranches dotted the landscape, utilizing largely-unclaimed lands in the public domain. Ranchers would file claims on lands with water access, and use the surrounding public pastures for grazing. Large stockmen sometimes used fraudulent homestead filings from employees and other individuals in order to gain title to surrounding land. A shack would be erected on these fraudulent claims and the claimant would stay there once every six months in order to claim residency. A common tactic was to gain title to a thin strip of land surrounding a large pasture in the public domain; the pasture would then be used for grazing purposes. This prevented anyone else from grazing their cattle in the enclosed area and discouraged homesteaders from claiming the land. Bartlett Richards and William Comstock, who formed the Spade Ranch, were famous for tactics such as these. Due to the immense land holdings required for large cattle operations, the population of the Sandhills region decreased by 10% between 1890 and 1900, and millions of acres remained in the public domain. To address this issue, William Neville, a populist congressman from North Platte, Nebraska, introduced legislation in 1902 that would amend the Homestead Law to allow an individual to take a homestead of 1,280 acres in the arid and nonirrigable lands west of the 100th meridian. The bill never made it to the floor for debate. In his 1902 address to congress, President Theodore Roosevelt made it a priority to settle the \\"public land problem.\\" He appointed a Public Lands Commission in 1903 to look into the issue and recommend solutions. The commission concluded that current land laws had been framed to accommodate humid regions, while the remaining public lands were arid in character. New land laws would be needed to settle the arid lands west of the 100th meridian.  Passage of the Kinkaid Act  Moses Kinkaid Moses Kinkaid, a congressman from the sixth district of Nebraska, introduced a bill \\"to amend the homestead laws as to certain unappropriated and unreserved lands in Nebraska\\" on April 6, 1904. The original bill provided for 1,280 acre homesteads, but the Committee on the Public Lands limited the size to 640 acres. The committee felt that 640 acres would be a good initial experiment size for dry-land farming, and the act could be amended in the future if more land were needed. Kinkaid stated that the bill had three primary purposes: to get the lands into the hands of individuals and thus make the land taxable; to end the fencing and claim fraud controversies over the land; and to build up the communities in the region. It was a bill meant for \\"the disposition of sandy and arid lands in western Nebraska,\\" which were too difficult to irrigate. It specifically applied to the Sandhills region of Nebraska, which is approximately the northwestern two- thirds of the state. All of the land was west of the 98th meridian. Only non- irrigable lands were open for entry; those that were deemed irrigable were not eligible. The bill passed on April 28, 1904. Approximately of land was made available within the area of the Kinkaid Act. An additional of land was withdrawn due to potential irrigability.  Mixed results in the Sandhills region  An immediate land rush followed the passage of the act. One of the land offices in the region was at Alliance, in Box Butte County. The first day to claim an entry was June 28, 1904. There were reportedly 400 people in line at the Alliance office on the initial day, and the original line was not completely processed until 3:00 pm on June 30. In April 1905, the Western Nebraska Observer of Kimball reported that there was a construction boom in Kimball County, which was within the territory of the Kinkaid Act. The North Platte Telegraph reported in 1906 that merchants had been having their most profitable months ever due to the influx of new residents. In her book Old Jules, a memoir about living in the Sandhills region at the turn of the century, Mari Sandoz describes the scene as land was initially opened for settlement: > Two weeks before opening, covered wagons, horsebackers, men afoot, toiled > into Alliance, got information at the land office, and vanished eastward > over the level prairie. Many turned back at the first soft yellow chophills, > pockmarked by blowouts and warted with soapweeds. Others kept on, through > this protective border, into the broad valley region, with high hills > reaching towards the whitish sky. Nebraska Sandhills in October Population rapidly increased in the 37 counties where the law was applicable: *1890: 124,508 *1900: 107,434 *1904: Passage of Kinkaid Act *1910: 162,217 Nearly all of the public lands in the region were claimed by 1912. All that remained were extremely isolated or undesirable sections. Between November 1910 and 1917, a total of 18,919 land patents were issued for of land. Some observers question the success of the Kinkaid Act in bringing new settlers into the region. There were widespread reports by 1914 that 90% of Kinkaid patents had been taken over by large stockmen (ranchers). Some argued that it was impossible to maintain a successful ranching operation in the region with only 640 acres of land. But, many of these statements were made by established cattle ranchers and industry representatives who were originally opposed to the Kinkaid Act. In congressional testimony from 1914, Moses Kinkaid reported that the sentiment of settlers in the region was that most of the claims remained in the hands of individual families. He reported that the region's communities held many small festivals each year, where Kinkaid homesteaders would meet and display their agricultural products. He described the average Kinkaid homesteader as a small family farmer: He estimated that the average Kinkaid homesteader had 15 to 40 head of cattle on 640 acres. Kinkaid's observations were supported by a 1915 report compiled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Nebraska. It found that only were remaining in the public domain within the boundaries of the Kinkaid Act, and no sites that had 640 contiguous acres available. A 1917 report from the Department of Interior reviewed the results from the first ten years after the Kinkaid Act, from 1904 to 1914. It found the following results: *Areas in the hands of small holders: *Areas in the hands of large holders: *Areas in the hands of original entrymen: *Total area proved up: The report showed that a majority of the land was in the hands of small holders, and approximately half the acreage was still owned by the original claimants. The report also showed evidence of a general increase of economic activity for the region: *Increase in value of cattle: 34 percent *Increase in acres planted to rye: 92 percent *Increase in acres planted to oats: 80 percent *Increase in acres planted to corn: 102 percent *Increase in acres planted to wheat: 142 percent *Increase in voting population: 55 percent *Total property valuations increased by 108 percent between 1904 and 1914, compared with 17 percent from 1892 to 1904 While the Kinkaid Act stimulated an immediate burst in economic activity for the region, this was mostly temporary. Because of the difficulties in dry-land farming on such small plots, many Kinkaid homesteaders eventually failed in their attempts to raise crops, and usually sold out to large ranchers. For example, there were 377 farms in Holt County in 1913, but only 144 in 1914. This pattern repeated itself throughout the region. The Kinkaid Act did convert land to private ownership from the public domain, but its goal of populating the region with small family farms had mixed results. Government officials were apparently pleased with the outcome of the Kinkaid Act, as it served as the blueprint for multiple other western land acts, most notably the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909 and the Stock- Raising Homestead Act of 1916. Since that time, increasingly only large-scale industrial ranching and farming has been successful on the Great Plains. The area has become depopulated with the decline of small farms, and some towns have become defunct.

It is part of Saltfjellet-Svartisen National Park, located in the Saltfjell mountain range. The glaciers are located in the municipalities of Beiarn, Mel√∏y, Rana, and R√∏d√∏y. Svartisen consists of two separate glaciers that are separated by the long Vesterdalen valley. The two glaciers are: * Vestisen or Vestre Svartisen (\\"western Svartisen\\") has an area of which makes it the second largest glacier on the Norwegian mainland after the Jostedalsbreen glacier. (There are larger glaciers on Svalbard.) * √òstisen or √òstre Svartisen (\\"eastern Svartisen\\") has an area of which makes it the country's fourth largest glacier. There are also a number of minor glaciers in the area surrounding Svartisen, such as Glombreen in the northern part of Mel√∏y, and Simlebreen in Beiarn. One of the outlet glaciers of Svartisen, Engabreen ends at the lowest point of any glacier on the European mainland, at above sea level (in 2007). The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate has monitored the glacier mass balance of the glacier since 1970 and operates a sub-glacial laboratory beneath Engabreen. Water from the glacier is collected and used for hydropower production via runoff into the streams and lakes and through intakes bored beneath Engabreen. Name The first element is svart which means 'swart' or 'black' and the last element is the finite form of is meaning 'ice' or 'glacier'. The old ice of the glacier is considerably darker than fresh ice and newfallen snow. Western Svartisen The western Svartisen ice cap is a glacier occupying of the coastal area of central Norway, just inside the Arctic Circle. Most of the glacier is around 1000 metres above sea level on a high plateau. The ice cap owes its existence to the high snowfall rates in the region, rather than the cold temperatures, similar to other glaciers close by such as the Jostedalsbreen glacier. The surface on the top of the plateau feeds many outlet glaciers, including the Engabreen glacier. The status of the glacier is unknown, although some of the outlet glaciers are advancing and gaining ice mass.

It is a survival manual dealing with the fictional potentiality of a zombie attack. It contains detailed plans for the average citizen to survive zombie uprisings of varying intensity and reach, and describes \\"cases\\" of zombie outbreaks in history, including an interpretation of Roanoke Colony. The Zombie Survival Guide was also featured on The New York Times Best Seller's list.\\"Best Sellers.\\". The New York Times, 21 March 2010. Brooks' inspiration for The Zombie Survival Guide was his childhood interest in zombies, sparked by the first zombie movie he ever saw, circa age 10: Revenge of the Zombies (1943). Contents The book is divided into six separate chapters, followed by a list of fictional attacks throughout history and an appendix. The first chapter, \\"The Undead: Myths and Realities\\", outlines Solanum, a fictional and incurable virus that creates a zombie, along with details on how it is spread (such as through an open wound, or contact with infected blood or saliva), and treatment of the infected (such as suicide or amputation of the injured limb, though the latter rarely works). The middle of this chapter explains the abilities and behavioral patterns of the undead, and the differences between \\"voodoo\\" zombies, movie zombies, and zombies created by Solanum. In subsequent chapters, the book describes weapons and combat techniques, places of safety, and how to survive a zombie-infested world. In the section describing weapons, Brooks writes about the human body: \\"If cared for and trained properly, is the greatest weapon on earth\\". The guide concludes with a fictional list of documented zombie encounters throughout history. The oldest entry is 60,000 BC, in Katanda, Central Africa, although the author expresses doubt about its validity. Instead, he presents evidence from 3,000 BC in Ancient Egypt as the first verifiable instance of a zombie outbreak. The most recent entry is 2002, in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Some of these encounters make reference to historical events, such as Roanoke Island. Appendix This is a sample \\"outbreak journal\\": the author notes covered-up zombie outbreaks seen on the local news as well as the preparations he recommends in the event that the outbreak worsens.

Business career Aldersgate Street, London Reed began the business side of his career in 1836 as an apprentice to a firm of woolen manufacturers at Leeds. In 1839, with his friend Thomas Edward Plint, he started and edited a magazine called The Leeds Repository, and on returning to London he co-founded the firm of Tyler & Reed, printers and typefounders in 1842. Reed changed business partners several times, becoming a partner in the famous Fann Street Foundry in Fann Street off Aldersgate Street in 1866 (which thereby became 'Reed & Fox'). The Fann Street business formed the basis for his own type-founding business Sir Charles Reed & Sons, whose office at 33 Aldersgate Street is illustrated.ODNB: Retrieved 13 December 2010.

The 'Reed' company name continued into the twentieth century long after Charles Reed's death, though under the proprietorship of Stephenson Blake & Co. who had bought Reed's business interests. At one time Reed's had been the larger of the two firms but it had difficulties in financing a modernisation programme as typography changed, and its once valuable equipment became out of date. Indeed, Stephenson Blake's acquisition was thought at the time to be very generous as it looked to be buying little other than the Reed's name and reputation. Not long after, however, thorough cataloguing of Reed's typefaces proved to be a treasure trove. Designs such as the Clarendon typeface, which Charles Reed had originally acquired from Robert Besley & Sons of the Fann Street foundry, became very marketable once re-cast using new technology. Several of Reed's typefaces are now available for use in font collections on our computers, such as Clarendon, which is now owned by a German company (as a trademark of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG licensed through Linotype Library GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG).. The City, in particular Fleet Street, is no longer the centre of book or newspaper printing, but public interest in the history of type-founding is fostered there by St Bride Printing Library. Charles' son Talbot Baines Reed (1852‚Äì1893), an author of books for boys, wrote the standard reference work on the history of typefounders in England, which went through may editions. It was said to be the most complete historical study in existence in any country before its editions were supplemented by new research in the 1950s.ODNB: Retrieved 16 December 2010.

Founded in 1867, the Fund was originally established to help support seamen who risked their own lives to save others off the coast near Broadstairs. The following account is attributed by R. M. Ballantyne to Sir Charles Reed himself: \\"Eight boatmen of Broadstairs [and their lugger‚Äîthe Dreadnought] had for years done good service on the Goodwins. One night they went off in a tremendous sea to save a French barque; but though they secured the crew, a steam-tug claimed the prize and towed her into Ramsgate Harbour. The Broadstairs men instituted proceedings to secure the salvage, but they were beaten in a London law court, where they were overpowered by the advocacy of a powerful company. In the meantime they lost their lugger off the coast of Normandy, and in this emergency the lawyers they had employed demanded their costs. The poor men had no means, and not being able to pay they were taken from their homes and lodged in Maidstone Gaol. He (Sir Charles) was then staying in Broadstairs, and an appeal being made to him, he wrote to The Times, and in one week received nearly twice the amount required. The bill was paid, the men were liberated and brought home to their families, and the considerable balance... of the amount was invested, the interest to be applied to rewarding boatmen who, by personal bravery, had... saved life on the coast.\\"R.

The London School Board was the first directly elected body covering the whole of London, and a pioneer for its time in other respects too - women were entitled to vote for its board members and also to stand for election as politicians.

Hackney's first MP Two parliamentary seats were allotted to Hackney by the Representation of the People Act, 1867 and Charles Reed became, in 1868, the first MP to be elected to represent Hackney, along with John Holms. As a member of Britain's first Liberal government, he faced a vigorous opponent at the next election in April 1874, when Gladstone was defeated. Lieutenant William Gill stood against him for the Conservatives with support from the Independent newspaper, which dubbed the constituency notorious hitherto as a hotbed of Radicalism. The vigorous Conservative campaign increased its poll share from 10 per cent to 31 per cent, but Gill still came bottom of the poll. However, the ballot was called into question on procedural grounds, with the result that a new election had to be called three months later. Charles Reed's place was taken by Professor Fawcett for the Liberals. He chose Holms again as his running mate in the two-seat constituency and this time Gill lost by only a small margin. However, Liberals were always returned until the constituencies of North, Central, and South Hackney were created in 1885.ODNB: Retrieved 13 December 2010. Subscription required. Abney Park Cemetery Abney Park Cemetery Company Annual Report for the year ending 5 April 1875 Reed had an interest in London's open spaces and their educational benefits, and became a subscriber to the Abney Park Cemetery, a joint stock company in whose trust lay parkland once owned by Lady Mary Abney, in which Dr Isaac Watts had written hymns. The associated members sought to maintain the site for its religious associations and for its value as open space. It was the only surviving example of a landscape designed by the nurseryman George Loddiges and boasted an arboretum of 2500 trees and shrubs. As the only New World cemetery design in Europe it had commissioned an entrance in an Egyptian revival style, to reflect its non-denominational character. The originality of the design and the motive force for acquiring and preserving the site had been George Collison, its first secretary, whose father had tutored Reed's father. Reed, with a firm understanding of the historical importance of the landscape and its educational value, won election as a director of the company for 16 years between 1866 and 1881 and became a principal influence during its last decades as a joint stock company. Reed himself is buried there. Soon after Reed died, the cemetery was made over on 11 April 1882 to a new company run on commercial lines. This laid out a new cemetery, Chingford Mount Cemetery in 1883‚Äì1884. Others at Hendon Park and Greenford followed. Bunhill Fields List of members of the Bunhill Fields Preservation Committee The Bunhill Fields burial ground is an ancient open space. Until its closure in the mid‚Äì19th century, many historically important people (particularly those whose religious beliefs dissented from the Established Church), chose this as their place of quiet interment on the edge of the City. The poet Robert Southey gave Bunhill Fields the memorable appellation the Campo Santo of the Dissenters; a phrase that also came to be applied to its \\"daughter\\" cemetery at Abney Park. This was a reference to its historical importance as a burial place for religious figures such as John Bunyan and Dr Isaac Watts. Monument to John Bunyan paid for by public subscription on the preservation of Bunhill Fields Burial Ground as a public park In a move to prevent the land from being built upon on expiry of a longstanding lease, the Corporation of the City of London formed a special Bunhill Fields Burial Ground Committee in 1865, which became formally known as the Bunhill Fields Preservation Committee. The committee, appointed by the Corporation, consisted of twelve advisors under Reed's chairmanship. Following the work of the committee, the City of London Corporation obtained an Act of Parliament in 1867 for the Preservation of Bunhill Fields Burial Ground as a public open space with seating, gardens, and for the restoration of some of its worthiest monuments, including one to Daniel Defoe funded by The Christian World and unveiled by Reed. The new park was opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 October 1869.C. B. E. Reed: Memoir of Sir Charles Reed (London: Macmillan, 1883), p. 122 ff. Other public activity Reed was widely involved in other philanthropic circles. He was an associate of George Peabody, for whom Reed moved the motion of 10 July 1862 granting Freedom of the City of London. He also developed the Guildhall Library of the City of London, while he was a councillor. His longstanding interest in social and educational improvement in The City of London was also reflected in membership of the Court of Common Council and in membership of the board of the City of London School.C.

The movement derived its name from that of its founder. Jean de Labadie‚Äôs life Jean de Labadie Jean de Labadie (1610‚Äì1674) came from an area near Bordeaux. In his early life he was a Roman Catholic and a Jesuit. However, at that time the Jesuits were wary of overt spiritual manifestations, so Labadie, who himself experienced frequent visions and inner enlightenment, found himself dissatisfied and left the order in 1639. He had fleeting links with the Oratoire, then Jansenism (on occasions staying with the solitaries of Port-Royal, who received him at the time but later sought to dissociate themselves from him). He was a parish priest and evangelist in the southern French dioceses of Toulouse and Bazas, preaching social righteousness, new birth, and separation from worldliness. His promotion of inner piety and personal spiritual experiences brought opposition and threats from the religious establishment. Eventually, frustrated with Roman Catholicism, Labadie became a Calvinist at Montauban in 1650. In that city, and then in the principality of Orange, he championed the rights of the Protestant minority in the face of increasing legislation against them by Louis XIV (which would culminate in 1685 with the Edict of Fontainebleau). Labadie then moved to Geneva, where he was hailed as \\"a second Calvin\\". Here he began to doubt the lasting validity of established Christianity. He held house groups for Bible-study and fellowship, for which he was censured. In 1666, Labadie and several disciples moved to the Netherlands, to the French-speaking Walloon congregation of Middelburg. Here his pattern continued: seeking to promote active church renewal through practical discipleship, study of the Bible, house meetings, and much else that was novel for the Reformed Church at that time. Here too he made contact with leading figures of the spiritual and reformatory circles of the day, such as Jan Amos Comenius, and Antoinette Bourignon. With a broad-mindedness, unusual for the period, Labadie was gracious and cautiously welcoming towards the move of repentance and new zeal among many Jews in a Messianic movement around Sabbatai Zevi in 1667.'Openaccess' website article (pdf retrieved 5.11.08) At length, in 1669, at 59 years of age, Labadie broke away from all established denominations and began a Christian community at Amsterdam. In three adjoining houses lived a core of some sixty adherents to Labadie's teaching. They shared possessions after the pattern of the Church as described in the New Testament book of Acts.Acts 2:44, 4:32 Persecution forced them to leave after a year, and they moved to Herford in Germany. Here the community became more firmly established until war forced them to move to Altona (then in Denmark, now a suburb of Hamburg), where Labadie died in 1674. Labadie's most influential writing was La R√©formation de l'Eglise par le Pastorat (1667). The Labadist community Anna Maria van Schurman, 1649 by Jan Lievens, in National Gallery, LondonIn the Labadist community there were craftsmen, who generated income, although as many men as possible were sent on outreach to neighbouring towns. Children were tutored communally. The women had traditional roles as homemakers. A printing press was set up, disseminating many writings by Labadie and his colleagues. The best known of Labadist writings was not Labadie's but Anna van Schurman's, who wrote a justification of her renunciation of fame and reputation to live in Christian community.Eukleria, seu melioris partis electio (‚ÄòOn choosing the better part‚Äô), (1673) Van Schurman was noted in her day as \\"The Star of Utrecht\\" and admired for her talents: she spoke and wrote five languages, produced an Ethiopic dictionary, played several instruments, engraved glass, painted, embroidered, and wrote poetry. At the age of 62 she gave up everything and joined the Labadists.Una Birch, Anna van Schurman, Artist, Scholar, Saint (1909) After Labadie's death, his followers returned to the Netherlands, where they set up a community in a stately home ‚Äì Walta Castle ‚Äì at Wieuwerd in Friesland, which belonged to three sisters Van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck, who were his adherents. Here printing and many other occupations continued, including farming and milling. One member, Hendrik van Deventer, skilled in chemistry and medicine, set up a laboratory at the house and treated many people, including Christian V, the King of Denmark. He is remembered as one of the Netherlands' pioneering obstetricians. Several noted visitors have left their accounts of visits to the Labadist community. One was Sophia of Hanover, mother of King George I of Great Britain; another was William Penn, the Quaker pioneer, who gave his name to the US state of Pennsylvania; a third was the English philosopher John Locke. Several Reformed pastors left their parishes to live in community at Wieuwerd. At its peak, the community numbered around 600 with many more adherents further afield. Visitors came from England, Italy, Poland and elsewhere, but not all approved of the strict discipline. Those of arrogant disposition were given the most menial of jobs. Fussiness in matters of food was overcome since all were expected to eat what was put in front of them. Daughter communities were set up in the New World. La Providence, a daughter colony on the Commewijne River in Surinam, proved unsuccessful. The Labadists were unable to cope with jungle diseases, and supplies from the Netherlands were often intercepted by pirates.Labadisten in Suriname, West-Indische Gids, 8 (1827), 193-218 Entomological artist Maria Sybilla Merian, who had lived in the Labadist colony in Friesland for some years, went to Surinam in 1700 and drew several plates for her classic Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium on the Labadist plantation of La Providence.Maria Sybilla Merian, Artist, Naturalist, Magazine Antiques, (August 2000) Bohemia Manor The mother colony in Friesland sent two envoys, Jasper Danckaerts and Peter Schl√ºter (or Sluyter), to purchase land for a colony. Danckaerts, an experienced seafarer, kept a journal which has survived and has been published. It is a valuable early account of life in colonial New Netherland (later New York), on the Chesapeake and the Delaware in 1679‚Äì80 and includes several hand drawings and maps. Danckaerts and Schl√ºter met the son of Augustine Herman, a successful Maryland businessman, in New York and he introduced them to his father in 1679. Herman was impressed with the men and their group. Initially Herman did not want to grant land to them, only permit Labadist settlement, but in 1683, he conveyed a tract of 3,750 acres (15 km¬≤) on his land Bohemia Manor in Cecil County, Maryland, to them because of legal issues. The group established a colony which grew rapidly to between 100-200 members. In the 1690s a gradual decline set in and finally the practice of communal sharing was suspended. From that moment on the Labadists dwindled, both in Maryland, which ceased to exist after 1720, and in Friesland they had died out by 1730. Key beliefs of the Labadists The Labadists held to the beliefs and traditions of their founder, Labadie. Chiefly these were: * The true Church of Jesus Christ is composed solely of those \\"born again\\" or \\"elect\\"; habitual churchgoing while not knowing God personally is of no value for salvation. * Absolute equality between the sexes. * The true Church is also \\"not of this world\\"; this affects all of life, including clothing (Labadists had their own dress for women, known in Dutch as a \\"bosrok\\", after the local nickname for their tree-ringed house). * Even so, the Church is always in need of reform, and this should start at the top, with the priests or pastors. * Knowing God is not through set religious laws but through personal prayer and mystical devotion; the heart should be warmed through contact with divine love. * All members are priests and can bring words of edification in church gatherings, which Labadie equated with New Testament \\"prophetic ministry\\". To facilitate this, home groups are the best forum. * The Holy Communion is only for the truly committed (in Labadist parlance the \\"elect\\"). * Self-denial, in particular fasting, is good for the soul. * Worldly vanities are to be eschewed and personal wealth shared in the community brotherhood. * An Augustinian (specifically Jansenist) belief in predestination. * Marriage must be \\"in the Lord\\"; a believer can justifiably separate from an unconverted partner in order to follow God's call to his work (in Labadist jargon, \\"the Lord‚Äôs work\\" meant their own community lifestyle). Legacy, influence and parallels William Penn records in his journal a meeting with the Labadists in 1677, which gives an insight into the reasons why these people chose to live a communal lifestyle. Labadie's widow, Lucia, testified to Penn about her younger days in which she had mourned the insipid state of the Christianity which she saw around her: > If God would make known to me his way, I would trample upon all the pride > and glory of the world. ...O the pride, O the lusts, O the vain pleasures in > which Christians live! Can this be the way to Heaven? ...Are these the > followers of Christ? O God, where is Thy little flock? Where is Thy little > family, that will live entirely to Thee, that will follow Thee? Make me one > of that number. Hearing Labadie's teachings, she was convinced of her need to be joined in community living with her fellow believers. Labadie's approach to Christian spirituality, but not his communitarian approach with its separation from mainstream churches, was paralleled in the Pietist movement in Germany. Many of its leaders, such as Philipp Jakob Spener, approved Labadie's stance but preferred for their own part to trust in the established structures. Some Pietist community enterprises did, however, arise. August Francke, professor at Halle University, founded there an orphanage (the Waisenhaus) in 1696, to be run along Christian communitarian lines, with equality and sharing of goods. This caused a stir and was famed abroad. Its example inspired in George Whitefield, the English preacher and revivalist, a yearning for a similar foundation which eventually came to being in America.

The principality's name is derived from the fortress of Karvuna (present-day Balchik, not to be confused with Karnava/Kavarna), mentioned in Bulgarian and Byzantine documents and Italian portolans of the 14th century as its first capital, and located between Varna and Cape Kaliakra. History The principality was spun off from the Second Bulgarian Empire (followed by other frontier regions of Bulgaria such as Vidin and Velbuzhd) around 1340 under Balik (member of the Bulgarian-Cuman dynasty of Terter according to some authors–ì. –ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤, –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ, –¢–æ–º 1, 2003, —Å. 457) and placed itself ecclesiastically under the Patriarchate of Constantinople. A \\"Metropolitan of Varna and Carbona\\" was mentioned in 1325. Under Balik's son Dobrotitsa (1347‚Äì1386; ruling with the title of \\"despot\\" after 1357) the principality came to its greatest power and extension and the capital was moved to Kaliakra. In 1346 or 1347, the principality was plagued by the Black Death, transmitted by Genoese boats from Caffa before they finally brought it to Sicily, Genoa and the whole of Western Europe. The principality had its own navy, which also engaged in piracy forcing the Genoese to complain, and possibly took part in an operation off Trebizond. In 1453, the Ottoman navy at the siege of Constantinople was initially led by one admiral Baltoglu, a Bulgarian convert from the former principality. The Principality of Karvuna at its greatest territorial extent, during the reign of Dobrotitsa In 1366, Ivan Alexander refused to give conduct to the John V Palaiologos who was returning home from Hungary. In order to force the Bulgarians to comply, John V ordered his relative Count Amadeus VI of Savoy to attack the Bulgarian coastal towns. In the fall of the same year, Amadeus' navy took Pomorie, Nessebar, Emona, and Kozyak, and on 25 October besieged the strong fortress of Varna, where it was repulsed. As a result, Ivan Alexander gave the Byzantines safe conduct across Bulgaria and they kept the conquered Nessebar;Fine, Late Medieval Balkans, p. 367 Varna Emona, and Kozyak was ceded to Dobrotitsa for his help against Amadeus. As a traditional breadbasket, Dobruja supplied wheat to Constantinople mostly via the major ports of Varna and Kaliakra frequented by the Genoese and Venetian fleets. The republics held their consulates at Varna and kept trading colonies at Castritsi and Galata outside that city. Between 1370 and 1375, allied with Venice, Dobrotitsa challenged Genoese power in the Black Sea. In 1373, he tried to impose his son-in law, Michael, as Emperor of Trebizond, but achieved no success. Dobrotitsa supported John V Palaiologos against his son Andronikos IV Palaiologos. In 1379, the Bulgarian fleet participated in the blockade of Constantinople, fighting with the Genoese fleet. Venetian sources from the late 14th century refer to Dobrotitsa as a \\"despot of the Bulgarians\\" (DESPOTUM BULGARORUM DOBROTICAM) and to his realm as \\"parts of Zagora (Bulgaria) subordinate to Dobrotitsa\\" (PARTES ZAGORAE (BULGARIAE) SUBDITAS DOBROTICAE). In 1386, Dobrotitsa died and was succeeded by Ivanko, who in the same year made peace with Murad I, moved his capital from Kaliakra to Varna, and in 1387 signed a commercial treaty with Genoa at Pera. This same year, Ivan Shishman attacked him, defeating and killing his former vassal Dan I of Wallachia, an ally of Ivanko's, but didn't manage to bring Dobruja back under his rule. Varna fell to the Ottomans in 1389, Ivanko himself dying in battle in 1388. In 1406 to 1411, most of Dobruja, with Drastar citadel (modern Silistra), was put under the rule of Mircea cel BƒÉtr√¢n of Wallachia.ƒ∞nalcƒ±k, Halil. (1998). \\"Dobrudja\\". Encyclopaedia of Islam II. Leiden: E. J. Brill. 611 a-b In 1411, the Ottoman Turks invaded and incorporated Dobruja into the Ottoman Empire. In 1413, Varna was turned over to Manuel II Palaiologos. In 1414, the area was devastated by Tatars. In 1444 Ottomans secured it after the Battle of Varna. In the very end of the 14th century, German traveller Johann Schiltberger described the lands of the former Bulgarian Empire (as follows: Rulers of the Despotate of Dobruja Notes: * Daughter of Alexios Apokaukos, Byzantine military commander ** Son of Michael Palaiologos, Despot of Zagora See also *History of Bulgaria *Medieval Bulgarian Navy *Varna *Balchik *Cape Kaliakra NotesReferencesFurther reading *–í–∞—Å–∏–ª –ù. –ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏, –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –¥—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–∑ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–µ, –ß–∞—Å—Ç I, II –∏–∑–¥., –ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –∏–∑–∫—É—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1970.

This method of skydiving training is called \\"accelerated\\" because the progression is the fastest way to experience solo freefall, normally from 10,000 to 15,000 feet above ground level (AGL). In static line progression, more jumps are required to experience freefall, but the jumps are less expensive for the student as one instructor can dispatch multiple students per load and students are initially dispatched from lower altitudes. Under accelerated freefall, one or sometimes two instructors are dedicated just to one student. Training technique In most AFF programs, two instructors jump with the student during their first three AFF jumps, although some programs may use only one instructor. On the initial levels, the instructor(s) hold on to the student until the student deploys their own parachute. Hence, this method is classified as harness hold training. The AFF instructors have no physical connection to the student other than their grip on the student, so once the student's parachute is deployed the instructors fly away and deploy their own canopies. Deployment of the main canopy for students in an AFF program is generally 6000 ft AGL (one mile or 1600 m), down to 5000ft AGL on later levels. If the student experiences trouble in the deployment of their parachute, the instructors first use hand signals to remind the student to pull. If the student still experiences trouble, the instructors will assist their student by physically putting the student's hand on the pilot chute, but if the student still has trouble, the instructor will deploy for the student. The instructor may pull the student's main canopy at any time the student appears to be in danger. Extra pull handles are usually installed on student gear, giving additional access for instructors. Once the student has proven they can deploy their own parachute on the first few jumps, the student will be released on subsequent levels and will have the opportunity to prove to their instructors that they have the basic flying skills required to maneuver in freefall without assistance. Each AFF level including and after level three is called a \\"release dive\\". This means that the student is briefed by the instructor that at a certain point in the freefall, the student will be released, although the instructor aims to remain nearby to assist in safety and teaching. On release skydives there is a possibility the instructor may not be able to dock and assist at pull time, so it is important that the student has already learned the skills required to activate their parachute at the safe altitude and in the right way. For this reason, students may not progress to the next level of AFF until they have completed all the targeted learning objectives of the previous level. Instructors on all AFF levels have a hard deck where they must pull their own parachute and save their own life. If they have not been able to assist their student by this altitude, the student's rig is equipped with an automatic activation device (AAD) that will fire the reserve parachute if the student passes the activation altitude at freefall speeds. While it is extremely rare that a student will have an AAD activation, this final level of protection protects the student as much as possible from the consequences of being out of control or not being able to deploy their own parachute. As the instructors freefall with the student, they are able to correct the student's body position and other problems during freefall by communicating with the student with hand signals in freefall and debriefing the student and conducting corrective training after the jump. Later levels only require one instructor and involve the student learning to perform aerial maneuvers such as turns, forward movement, flips, and fall rate control. The purpose of the maneuvers is to prove to the student and instructor that the student can perform a disorienting maneuver causing intentional instability followed by regaining control. The instructor(s) determine when the student has passed the requirements for each level. During the AFF jumps, the student may have radio contact with ground personnel who direct the student's maneuvers under their parachute, however the student must have the skills for a solo landing in case the radio fails. Licensing organizations and protocols In the United States, there are no official government required training procedures. As long as a jumper wears equipment that meets certain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements in design and maintenance, anyone can intentionally exit an airborne aircraft legally. However, the United States Parachute Association (USPA), a non-profit organization that represents skydivers and drop zone owners, has written protocols and basic safety requirements that guide USPA-rated instructors on how to teach students to earn their USPA licences. While a licence is not required to jump legally, the USPA licence will allow the skydiver to travel to other USPA dropzones and use their licence to prove they have the skills required to jump. The USPA protocol for training students is called the \\"Integrated Student Program\\" (ISP). The ISP is separated into categories, each with targeted learning objectives that must be met before the student progresses to the next level. Static Line, AFF, and Tandem Progression all follow the same categories, but use different methods to train within each category. Many drop zones classify their AFF levels by numbers, such as \\"AFF 6\\", but the USPA classification is by category letter. Categories A through E are the instructional jumps where the student must be accompanied with an appropriately rated instructor. Since most AFF programs have seven jumps, but there are only 5 letters between A and E, some categories require more than one jump to complete. After Category E, students are cleared to self supervise. Categories F, G and H are completed as solo skydives or with the assistance of a rated coach or instructor. The student must also complete two \\"hop n pops\\" in two different altitudes which are lower than the normal altitude. \\"Hop n pops\\" means the jumper must deploys the parachute immediately after exiting the aircraft, the purpose of \\"hop n pops\\" is to practice the exit procedure if under the situation of aircraft malfunctions. All jumps must completely match the requirement of BSR (Basic Safety Requirement). Once the student has completed 25 skydives, and has their A licence requirements signed off by an instructor or coach, they are eligible for their A licence and are no longer a student. In the UK, there are 8 levels. The 8th level in the UK is what is known as a \\"hop and pop\\". The 8th level is part of the British Parachute Association requirements. In Finland, a 15-second freefall with low opening is required as the 8th level to complete the initial training before the \\"hop and pops\\".

Although it is not an invariant of knots or links (as it is not invariant under type I Reidemeister moves), a suitably \\"normalized\\" version yields the famous knot invariant called the Jones polynomial. The bracket polynomial plays an important role in unifying the Jones polynomial with other quantum invariants. In particular, Kauffman's interpretation of the Jones polynomial allows generalization to invariants of 3-manifolds. The bracket polynomial was discovered by Louis Kauffman in 1987. Definition The bracket polynomial of any (unoriented) link diagram L, denoted \\\\langle L \\\\rangle , is a polynomial in the variable A, characterized by the three rules: * \\\\langle O \\\\rangle = 1 , where O is the standard diagram of the unknot * 275px * \\\\langle O \\\\cup L \\\\rangle = (-A^2 - A^{-2}) \\\\langle L \\\\rangle The pictures in the second rule represent brackets of the link diagrams which differ inside a disc as shown but are identical outside.

Early life Lovro von Mataƒçiƒá was born in Su≈°ak to a family that was granted a noble title in the early 17th century. Growing up, he was always surrounded by music and art: his father had a career as an opera singer, and his mother as an actress. After his parents‚Äô divorce, the family moved to Vienna, where Lovro joined the Vienna Boys Choir of the Royal Court Chapel at the age of eight. The Choir‚Äôs repertoire must have influenced his later affinities, but most of all through the music of Anton Bruckner. In the Piarists‚Äô Gymnasium in Vienna he received training in piano, organ and music theory. His music education continued under distinguished teachers at the Vienna Hochschule f√ºr Musik, which he never attended formally, and from which he did not obtain any degrees. After Vienna Mataƒçiƒá proved his talent in practice when in 1916 he started volunteering as an accompanist at the Cologne Opera. When the war broke out, however, he volunteered for the army and also became an active revolutionary: in 1918 he joined the circle of left-oriented intellectuals in Vienna who recognized his artistic talent. He already had several works ready; he recited the poem Vigilia to his colleagues, and he was sixteen when the Tonk√ºnstlerorchester of the Vienna Musikverein conducted by Bernhard Paumgartner premiered his Fantasy for the Orchestra. Not many of Mataƒçiƒá‚Äôs compositions have been completely preserved, although he did include some of them in his programs after becoming a distinguished conductor ‚Äì such as the Confrontation Symphony or the Konjuh planina Cantata. After the war, he made a living mostly by playing in caf√©s, writing reviews, and by short-term conducting engagements in Osijek, Zagreb and Novi Sad, where he served the required military service as a military musician. Even then, his performances were marked with opera pieces and a vocal repertoire, but he did not find a permanent position until 1922 when he was employed by the Ljubljana Opera. In the meantime, he married Karla Dubska, a Czech singer who introduced him to the golden era of Czech music. His first success in Ljubljana was the performance of Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's opera Jen≈Øfa, which would subsequently become one of the most often performed operas of Mataƒçiƒá‚Äôs repertoire. Career as conductor After Ljubljana, his engagements and successes lined up: with the Belgrade Opera and the Obiliƒá Academic Choir, his first appearance in front of the Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra (1927) and the Vienna Symphonic Orchestra at the Konzerthaus (1928), the Letonic State Opera in Riga, and the more permanent move to Zagreb in 1932 where he spread his activities to opera, symphony, and choir repertoire. In 1936, Mataƒçiƒá conducted the Berlin Philharmonic and became the orchestra‚Äôs regular guest. In 1938 he left the position of the permanent conductor at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb to become the director of the Belgrade Opera and the chief conductor of the Belgrade Philharmonic. World War II and aftermath During World War II, Mataƒçiƒá spent most of the time in Zagreb as an army officer, but also continued conducting: he appeared in Zagreb with all major local orchestras, as well as in Vienna and Berlin. He was the Inspector of Croatian Army‚Äôs music ensembles and was in charge of the entire corpus of military music in Croatia. His last concert before he was arrested was two weeks prior to the capitulation of Germany ‚Äì on 23 April 1945 he appeared with the State Radio Orchestra. He always declined to comment in detail on his status during and after the war. In more than a year spent in prison, he was once again given a chance to work in music ‚Äì he led the prison orchestra and choir. After his second wife Elizabeta Lilly Levenson, whom he married in 1933, managed to obtain a pardon for him, he relocated to Skopje in 1948. Career after the war Until 1954, when he managed to get an approval from Tito to be issued a passport, his activities in the former country were limited to Rijeka and Ljubljana, but soon his career gained full international momentum. The recording in 1954 of highlights from Richard Strauss‚Äôs Arabella (with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf) in London for the Columbia label marked a new beginning in the conductor's life. He replaced Herbert von Karajan for that recording and afterwards signed a five-year contract with the record company. The following year he replaced Karl B√∂hm at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich for a triumphal performance of Strauss's Ariadne on Naxos. Appearances in Berlin, Stuttgart, Augsburg, Salzburg, Graz and elsewhere followed, where he conducted concert programs, operas, and often even directed the productions. He was invited to the Dresden State Chapel, State Opera of East Berlin, and to tours around Europe, including Ljubljana, Split, and Dubrovnik. After leaving Dresden in 1958, Mataƒçiƒá strengthened his ties to Vienna, debuted at the Bayreuth Festival where he also started a long-term collaboration with opera director and Richard Wagner's grandson, Wieland Wagner. He finally travelled to the United States, where he performed at the Chicago Opera. Mataƒçiƒá won over the Italian audience, too - in 1961 at the Rome Opera he performed Wagner's The Ring of the Nibelung. In 1961 in Frankfurt he became the chief conductor of the municipal opera and the prestigious series of Museum Concerts. He continued working in multiple fields: he recorded for RAI in Turin, and simultaneously managed the Dubrovnik Summer Festival. He was named Honorary Life-Time Conductor of the NHK Symphony Orchestra in Japan, conducted orchestras such as Philharmonie, the Czech, Berlin, and Munich philharmonic orchestras. He appeared at the Bavarian State Opera, Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires, the State and Volksopera of Vienna. At the Musikverein he regularly conducted the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, sat on the jury for Karajan's conducting competition and in 1974 became the chief conductor of the National Opera Orchestra of Monte Carlo. The list goes on with his appointment as the chief conductor of the Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra in 1970 with which he realized a number of ambitious plans, including support for young conductors through a special series ‚Äì Presenting Young Conductors. He died in Zagreb in 1985. Collaborations The musicians he collaborated with include Sviatoslav Richter, Arthur Rubinstein, Christian Ferras, Rudolf Buchbinder, Marijana Radev, Ru≈æa Pospi≈° Baldani, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Christa Ludwig, Renata Tebaldi, Birgit Nilsson, Leontyne Price, Nicolai Gedda, and Dietrich Fischer- Dieskau. He recorded for labels such as Columbia and Supraphon, covering a vast repertoire. Although Anton Bruckner was at the top of the list for his symphony and concert repertoire and Richard Wagner, along with his favorite Orpheus by Ch. W. Gluck and Jan√°ƒçek‚Äôs Jen≈Øfa at the top of his opera repertoire, Lovro von Mataƒçiƒá‚Äôs interest covered a huge span from Palestrina, Monteverdi and Henry Purcell, through Handel, Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven to Mussorgsky, Mahler, Jan√°ƒçek, Smetana, R. Strauss, Wagner, Verdi and others. He was especially dedicated to performing the work of Croatian composers. His first appearances with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1936 already included a suite from Kre≈°imir Baranoviƒá‚Äôs ballet Gingerbread Heart and Jakov Gotovac‚Äôs Symphonic Kolo. The programs of his subsequent international and Croatian performances also included the works of Josip Hatze, Blagoje Bersa, Bo≈æidar ≈†irola, Bo≈æidar Kunc, Boris Papandopulo, Antun Dobroniƒá and Josip ≈†tolcer-Slavenski, Bruno Bjelinski. Mataƒçiƒá once said: ‚ÄúOne day, when they draw a line, it will not matter what I did for international composers, but how I contributed to Croatian music. His numerous efforts in that respect should definitely include his last will and testimony by which he established the Lovro & Lilly Mataƒçiƒá Foundation. Awards and acknowledgements For his anthological interpretations (especially of works by Bruckner and Wagner and of major works of the Slavic repertoire) he was awarded the Bruckner Medal of the International Bruckner Society, Bruckner Ring of the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, Jan√°ƒçek and Smetana Medals of the Czechoslovak Government, Cross of the 1st Order for Arts and Sciences of the President of the Republic of Austria, Hans von B√ºlow Medal of the Berlin Philharmonic as well as many other awards. Composer Mataƒçiƒá was also active as a composer. His most significant composition is his Symphony of Confrontations (‚ÄûSymphonie der Konfrontationen‚Äú, 1979, revised 1984), an hour-long work in four movements for two pianos, large string orchestra and enormous percussion sections. It deals with the threat of destruction by nuclear weapons in a harsh musical language that includes quotes from the \\"Dies Irae\\" Theme from Hector Berlioz' Symphonie Fantastique.

She was built in 1985 by W√§rtsil√§ at the Helsinki New Shipyard in Helsinki, Finland for Johnson Line as MS Svea for use in Silja Line traffic. Between 1992 and 1994 she sailed for Silja Line as MS Silja Karneval, and between 1994 and 2008 for Color Line as MS Color Festival. History=Silja Line service As M/S Svea MS Svea and her sister MS Wellamo were modeled after Silja Line's highly successful Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm service ferries MS Finlandia and MS Silvia Regina. The main difference to the older pair of ships was outer appearance of the new sisters: where Finlandia and her sister had had a very box-like exterior, the new sisters for the Turku‚ÄìStockholm route had more attractive rounded looks. In 1989 there were plans to rebuild Svea with rails on the cardeck so that she could also carry railroad carriages on board, but these were shelved. Until 1990 her funnel displayed the colours of Johnson Line, but at that time Silja Line's owners Johnson Line and Effoa merged into one company, EffJohn, and Silja Line's seal logo was moved from the ship's hulls into their funnels. In 1992 Svea and her sister underwent a large-scale reconstruction at Lloyd Werft in Bremerhaven, Germany where most of the ships' interiors were rebuilt, a new skybar added on deck 9, a new more blue-dominated colour scheme replaced the traditional Silja stripes and the ship was renamed Silja Karneval in accordance with Silja's new name policy. In fact the funds used to rebuild Svea and Wellamo were originally meant for rebuilding of the GTS Finnjet, but her planned rebuilding would have been too expensive and EffJohn opted to spend what money they had on Svea and Wellamo instead. Color Line service MS Color Festival at the Oslofjord. Silja Karnevals service on Silja proved to be short. In early 1994 EffJohn decided to sell her sister Silja Festival to Norway-based Color Line. However, when time came to deliver the ship to Color Line, EffJohn for some reason decided to sell them Silja Karneval instead (the two ships being structurally identical). Problematically for Color Line, they had already printed material advertising their new ship as the Color Festival. As result Silja Karneval became M/S Color Festival, not Color Karneval as would have been logical. After reconstruction at Cityvarvet, Gothenburg, Color Festival was initially placed on the Oslo‚ÄìHirtshals route. In 2002 she damaged one of her rudders in Hirsthals and had to be docked in Hamburg because of it. In April 2006 she started operating on the Oslo‚ÄìFredrikshavn route in direct competition with her old Silja Line fleetmate MS Stena Saga. On 21 November 2007 Color Line sold Color Festival to Corsica Ferries for ‚Ç¨49 million (400 million Norwegian krone), in preparation for the delivery of the new Color Superspeed vessels in mid-2008. Corsica Sardinia Ferries service The Color Festival was delivered to Corsica Sardinia Ferries in early January 2008, subsequently renamed Mega Smeralda and re-flagged in Italy with Genoa as her homeport. Reportedly she will be placed on Civitavecchia ‚Äì Golfo Aranci or Livorno ‚Äì Golfo Aranci service. In 2011, the ferry operates between Tolone, Ajaccio, Bastia, Nice, etc... 2013 Tour de France In June 2013, the Tour de France visited Corsica for the first time. To accommodate the Tour entourage, the organisers chartered the Mega Smeralda to house members of the organisation, media and others who worked on the Tour and to host press conferences, although the riders stayed in hotels in Porto-Vecchio.

He appeared extensively in Shakespeare and other classics and musicals in Britain, and was also in several Broadway productions. He was an artistic director of the Chichester Festival Theatre in the 1970s and later had a recurring role on Murder, She Wrote. He was also known for illustrating a collection of Jeremy Lloyd's poems Captain Beaky, and singing the title song from the associated album. Early life Michell was born in Adelaide, and brought up in Warnertown, near Port Pirie. His parents were Joseph, a cabinet-maker, and Alice (n√©e Aslat). Educated at Port Pirie High School, Adelaide Teachers' College and Adelaide University, he began his career as an art teacher and made his professional acting debut in 1947 in the comedy Lover‚Äôs Leap, by Bill Daily, at Adelaide's Playbox Theatre. He then worked in radio for ABC in Adelaide. In 1949, he moved to Britain to study at the Old Vic Theatre School. Career Michell joined the Young Vic theatre company and made his first appearance in London by 1951. An early role there was Bassanio in The Merchant of Venice. His first London musical was And So to Bed, playing King Charles II. With the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in 1952‚Äì1953, he toured in Australia. Then, at Stratford-upon-Avon, he appeared in a series of Shakespeare plays: The Taming of the Shrew, A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream, Troilus and Cressida, and Romeo and Juliet. In 1956, on television, he played Henry Higgins in Pygmalion by Bernard Shaw and, the same year, at the Royal Court Theatre, he starred in the title role in Ronald Duncan's Don Juan and in several Old Vic Company productions as Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing, Proteus in The Two Gentlemen of Verona, Antony in Antony and Cleopatra and Aaron in Titus Andronicus. Michell at Chichester Festival Theatre in 1962 In 1958, he played Nestor-Le-Fripe in the musical Irma La Douce, also starring in the role with the National Theatre in Washington, DC, and on Broadway in 1960‚Äì1961.

It was discovered in 1940 in Spirit Cave, eastApprox. , of Fallon, Nevada by the husband-and-wife archaeological team of Sydney and Georgia Wheeler. He was said to be forty years old when he died. Discovery The Wheelers, working for the Nevada State Parks Commission, were surveying possible archaeological sites to prevent their loss due to guano mining. Upon entering Spirit Cave they discovered the remains of two people wrapped in tule matting. One set of remains, buried deeper than the other, had been partially mummified (the head and right shoulder). The Wheelers, with the assistance of local residents, recovered a total of sixty-seven artifacts from the cave. These artifacts were examined at the Nevada State Museum where they were initially estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 years old. They were deposited at the Nevada State Museum‚Äôs storage facility in Carson City where they remained for the next fifty-four years. Spirit Cave Spirit Cave is at an elevation of 4,154 feet in the foothills of the Stillwater Mountains;The Men from Spirit Cave and Wizard's Beach. Mammoth Trumpet, 1997 the Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge is now established in this area. The location is to the northeast of Fallon, Nevada.map of the area Dating In 1996 University of California, Riverside anthropologist R. Ervi Taylor examined seventeen of the Spirit Cave artifacts using mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the mummy was approximately 9,400 years old (uncalibrated RCYBP); ~11.5 Kya calibrated) ‚Äî older than any previously known North American mummy. Researchers estimate the death of this person to have occurred about 7420 B.C. The findings were published in the Nevada Historical Quarterly in 1997 and drew immediate national attention. Repatriation and DNA Analysis In March 1997, the Paiute-Shoshone Tribe of the Fallon Reservation and Colony made a Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) claim of cultural affiliation with the artifacts. In 2000, further study was unable to establish a definitive affiliation of the remains. In September, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada ruled on a lawsuit by the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe and said that the Bureau of Land Management made an error in dismissing evidence without a full explanation. The court order remanded the matter back to the BLM for reconsideration of the evidence. In October 2015, Eske Willerslev collected bone and tooth samples from the remains with the permission of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe. DNA analysis indicated that the remains were similar to North and South American indigenous groups. On November 22, 2016, the remains were repatriated to the tribe. Willerslev attended the 2018 burial of the remains by the tribe. In November 2018, researchers reported that the DNA sequencing of the remains were used in research about Paleoamericans (Y-haplogroup Q1b1a1a1-M848, mt-haplogroup D1). Wizards Beach Man Wizards Beach Man's remains were also in the collection of the Nevada State Museum, and were radiocarbon dated at the same time.

The building was designed by architects J. Campbell and G. E. Gosling, for the Scott McClelland and Company, at a cost of Rs. 125,000. David Sassoon donated Rs. 60,000, while the rest of the cost was borne by the Government of Bombay Presidency.TIFR Mumbai pages sourced from article by Kaumudi Marathe of Times of India, 12 November 1995. The library is located on Rampart Row, looking across the Kala Ghoda. The building, completed in 1870, is built using yellow Malad stone, much like the abutting Elphinstone College, Army and Navy Buildings and Watson's Hotel. Above the entrance portico is a white stone bust of David Sassoon. This marble bust was Thomas Woolner's working model for the statue of Sassoon standing at the front of the stairs of the David Sassoon Library. This standing marble statue, completed in 1865, was commissioned by Sir Bartle Frere, Governor of Bombay and personal friend of the sculptor, Woolner. Subscriptions came from the Jewish community, a myriad of traders, and friends in England. The building also houses the Lund and Blockley opticians.

The group is usually depicted within the pages of The X-Men. It was led by the Mutant Master, who was secretly an alien from a race of beings from Sirius that resemble octopuses. It used various mind control methods to capture and train new agents, though some merely joined for profit. The Factor Three saga, as the storyline has become unofficially known in the years since, was one of the earliest multipart storylines in the team's history. Publication history Factor Three was first mentioned in The X-Men #28 (January 1967), and was created by Roy Thomas and Werner Roth. The team continued to be mentioned or appear throughout the following issues, from #29-39 (February‚ÄìDecember 1967), until the team disbanded. Fictional team biography Factor Three first appeared through two of its agents, Banshee and the Ogre.The X-Men #28 Oddly enough, though the organization's credo involved the prosperity of the mutant race by becoming the third World Power (after the US and then-Soviet USSR), The Ogre was not a mutant at all, but was merely a paid mercenary who relied on technology. Banshee, forced to submit to the Mutant Master's commands via a headpiece rigged to explode should he refuse, teamed up with The Ogre to kidnap Professor Charles Xavier. His fledgling X-Men thwarted their attempts, captured the Ogre, and freed Banshee. Later, Factor Three freed the supervillain Juggernaut, serving to distract the X-Men while a second attempt was made to kidnap Professor X; this time they succeeded. With the help of Banshee, the X-Men were able to locate Factor Three's hidden base within the Alps, but were captured during the rescue attempt. Finally meeting the Mutant Master himself, along with his full array of henchmen, their plan was unveiled. They intended to cause nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union, which would wipe out the human race. The X-Men were able to escape the mountain base just before Mutant Master blew it up, and again thwarted their plans. Factor Three relocated to an alternate base, where Changeling, Mutant Master's second in command, discovered his plans to destroy mutantkind as well as humankind. Changeling freed Professor X and Banshee, who inadvertently destroyed the Mutant Master's cloaking device, revealing his alien appearance. The X-Men and the remainder of Factor Three joined forces in attacking Mutant Master, who committed suicide to avoid capture.

Cornwell is also author of several other series of historical fiction such as the \\"Richard Sharpe\\" novels of the British campaigns in the Peninsular War in Spain during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th Century.  Life before the books  Starbuck is born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of radical abolitionist minister Reverend Dr. Elial Starbuck. He lives a relatively pious childhood, and is regularly beaten by his father, which leaves him unprepared for the outside world. Starbuck goes to the Yale Seminary, in New Haven, Connecticut, as his father hopes he will follow him into the ministry. Here Starbuck meets several notable figures, including the well-known Oliver Wendell Holmes, (1809-1894), [physician, poet, professor, author] and his equally famous son Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., (1841-1935), (Union Army officer and future U.S. Supreme Court justice). He also meets his close friend Adam Faulconer, who is also studying at Yale seminary.  Major events in the first book  After becoming enamored with an actress, Starbuck drops out of school to run away with her. Unfortunately, the actress scams both Starbuck and her boyfriend/director. With all of his money gone, Starbuck goes to Virginia to seek aid from Faulconer. However, before he can get to Faulconer's house, news of the attack on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor in South Carolina in April 1861 causes a riot to break out in the streets. The crowd grabs Starbuck and another man, who turns out to be a dentist from the North. The crowd then proceeds to tar and feather the dentist, and are planning to do the same to Starbuck when Adam Faulconer's father, Washington Faulconer, rides in and saves him. The two return to the Faulconer estate and Starbuck is eventually persuaded to join the \\"Faulconer Legion,\\" a (fictional) regiment that Faulconer is raising at his own expense in order to aid the new Confederacy should war with the North become unavoidable. He is commissioned a second lieutenant and charged with helping Faulconer equip the regiment. Although Faulconer is generous to Starbuck, people - most notable Thaddeus Bird and Belvedere Delaney - continuously warn him that Faulconer's generosity will remain only as long as Starbuck reveres him. They say that Faulconer is in reality a spiteful and weak man who craves admiration and glory and receives it only by his wealth. Starbuck however continuously defends his savior and despite the growing number of people, who give the same damning opinion of Faulconer, refuses to believe that the man who saved his life and treats him so well could be a bad man. The truth of Faulconer's character and in what people say about him is confirmed on the Legion's first mission to destroy a rail bridge and major supply route of the Union. Faulconer overestimates the importance of the bridge as it can be re-erected in a matter of days, plans the entire operation badly, mainly by not bringing adequate waterproofing and allowing the equipment and supplies to become damp. This dampness prevents the gunpowder from igniting at the crucial moment. Frustrated with the failure and unable to admit responsibility Faulconer blames a delay which he believes to have been caused by Starbuck. When it transpires that the delay is not Starbuck's fault but instead that of Sergeant Thomas Truslow, whom Faulconer fears, it is too late to back away from blaming the delay and rather than blame Truslow he insists that the fault lies on Starbuck, an easier target. Faulconer is eventually successful in having his regiment posted to Confederate General Pierre G.T. Beauregard's army near Manassas Junction in northern Virginia, just southwest of the national capital of Washington, D.C. in July 1861, though his organisation of the move is, true to form, desperately poor. Immediately prior to the Battle of Manassas (aka Bull Run), Faulconer attempts to dispose of Starbuck by packing him off to his family in the north. Then convinced that the battle will be fought on the Confederate right, he abandons the legion in an attempt to secure orders to move his regiment from the left wing, decreeing that any orders to the contrary should be ignored. In his absence, Starbuck returns, having spotted the real Northern attack heading toward the Confederate left wing. After some difficulty, he convinces Colonel Nathan Evans, senior officer on the Confederate left, that an attack is imminent. Upon his return to the Faulconer legion, Starbuck also convinces Thaddeus Bird, now a Major and the regiment's second in command, and Adam Faulconer (now a Captain) that the legion must attempt to save the Confederacy by supporting Evans' troops. But it is Sergeant Truslow who actually persuades the troops to advance after their divided loyalties to Faulconer - and their efforts to obey his parting order - cause a near collapse of authority. In the ensuing battle, Starbuck sustains a thrashing from Faulconer, who blames him for the damage the legion takes while protecting the Confederate flank. But Faulconer receives a bullet in the arm from a union soldier, which ends Starbuck's beating; Adam Faulconer is also wounded. Starbuck then murders his enemy, Faulconer's future son in law, Ethan Ridley - whose corpse is instantly and fortuitously mangled by a shell, hiding the evidence. Faulconer and Truslow both see Starbuck fire the fatal shots, though Truslow defends Starbuck when Faulconer accuses him of the murder after the battle. In actuality, Starbuck's information and Bird's decision to join the desperate rearguard action saved the whole confederate army, but Faulconer is left with a burning hatred of Starbuck and a malicious intent to make his life as difficult - and short - as possible. Despite his complete absence from the actual engagement, and his insistence that the legion should not support Nathan Evans, due to the heroism of his troops, Washington Faulconer ends the book as a hero in Confederate eyes, and several newspapers insist he should be given a brigade. With several officers killed in the battle, and Faulconer an invalid due to his wounds, Major Bird takes over command of the regiment. Starbuck ends the book promoted to Captain of K company (the regiment's company of skirmishers) with Truslow as his sergeant.

Slovak National Hockey League once, the IIHF Continental Cup once, the Tatra Cup ten times, and the Rona Cup four times. The club is nicknamed \\"Oceliari\\", which means \\"Steelers\\" in English. History Logo of HC Ko≈°ice from 1962 to 1998 The club was established in Ko≈°ice in 1962 as an army hockey club called TJ Dukla Ko≈°ice. At that time, there were two weak regional ice hockey clubs in the city. The new club was much stronger and joined the Czechoslovak Hockey League within two years. In 1966, Dukla changed its name to TJ VS≈Ω Ko≈°ice. In 1986, the club became the Ice Hockey Champions of Czechoslovakia for the first time, beating HC Dukla Jihlava in the finals.

The mall, which is anchored by Belk, JCPenney, and Dillard's, has GLA. History Anderson Mall opened in March 1972 with 43 stores. The mall was anchored by department stores: JCPenney, Meyers Arnold, and G.C. Murphy. In 1984 both Belk (then known as Gallant Belk) and Sears closed their Downtown Anderson stores and moved to the newly expanded and renovated mall. This expansion was first announced in 1982. Meyers Arnold was later purchased by Uptons, and after that chain closed, that spot became a Belk Men's & Home store. In 2007, the Belk Men's & Home store closed, with the Men's store moving into the existing Women's & Kids store. The Home Store relocated to an adjacent mall space next to the main Belk. These moves were to make way for a new store, Dillard's, which opened in late 2008. The entire mall and numerous other stores were also remodeled around that time. On May 28, 2014, Simon Property Group announced that its 98 shopping centers including Anderson Mall would be spun off to a new company called Washington Prime Group. On May 31, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 72 stores nationwide.

She is known for designs with clean modernist elements such as shiny surfaces, squares and cubes. Along with and Ryue Nishizawa, she has worked on several projects in Germany, Switzerland, France, England, the Netherlands, United States, and Spain. Many of their designs like the Rolex Learning Center at EPFL the New Museum in the Bowery District in New York City as well as the Glass Pavilion for the Toledo Museum of Art involve large windows and public open space to interact with the world around the architecture. In 2010, Sejima was the second woman to receive the Pritzker Prize, which was awarded jointly with Nishizawa. Early life and education Sejima was born on 29 October 1956 at Mito, Ibaraki, Japan. She graduated from Japan Women's University in 1979. She then went on to complete the Master's Degree course in architecture in 1981. In the same year, she began working with the architecture firm Toyo Ito and Associates until 1987. Career After apprenticing with Toyo Ito, Sejima established Kazuyo Sejima & Associates in 1987. One of her first hires was Ryue Nishizawa, a student who had worked with Sejima at Toyo Ito and Associates. After working for Sejima for several years, Sejima asked him to form a partnership. In 1995, the two founded the Tokyo-based firm SANAA (Sejima and Nishizawa and Associates). In 2010, Sejima was appointed director of architecture sector for the Venice Biennale, which she curated for the 12th Annual International Architecture Exhibition. She was the first woman ever selected for this position. In 2010, she was awarded the Pritzker Prize, together with Ryue Nishizawa.Pritzker Prize 2010 Media Kit , retrieved 29 March 2010  Approach  Sejima's work tends to incorporate materials such as glass or slick surfaces such as marble. Her buildings mainly display an arrange of curves within the architecture of the building as well as on the surface. Kazuyo successfully combines the building with the surrounding areas. The use of a lot of sheer glasses and clear glass is used, allowing natural light to enter a space and create a fluid transition between interior and exterior. It lets a person to look at the outdoors, while also looking at themselves and the reflections the outside world creates on the inside of the building. Sejima intentionally overturns outmoded stereotypical housing models as they are based on assumptions instead of reality. These assumptions include housing models that illustrate the proper living condition for a nuclear family, etc. Her idea is not to initiate a complete rejection to tradition, but rather to challenge the conventional process of design. Instead of unconsciously applying assumptions to a design, she tries to confront them consciously as best as she can. She thinks it is impossible to let a building completely based on a fictional idea or theory of what something should be.Sejima, Kazuyo. Kazuyo Sejima, 1988-1996. Ed. C. Levene and Fernando Marquez Cecilia. Barcelona: El Croquis, 1996. Print. Sejima redefines the \\"design process\\" as \\"process designs\\". Processes are documented, accumulation of design operations are taken into account rather than gradually refine a single design idea towards the final stage. During the design process of Hokusai Museum in Sumida Ward (Tokyo), sequence of 1:200 scale models were produced for the schematic design phase and photographed. Two periods of proposal production (21 days), materials used, elaboration dates, and the date when meeting were held were all in the record as part of the justification of the design process.

Van Fleet State Trail is a rail trail in Florida, named after General James A. Van Fleet, who was a distinguished combat commander in both World Wars and the Korean War. It is protected as a Florida State Park and occupies a abandoned portion of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad's Miami Subdivision through Central Florida's Green Swamp area. It extends from Polk City in the south to Mabel in the north. It passes through Bay Lake and crosses Lake, Polk and Sumter counties. The entire length of the trail is paved approximately wide and is mostly straight, containing only one slight curve toward the southern end of the trail just north of the Polk City trailhead. Fauna Among the wildlife that can be seen along the trail are egrets, herons and various raptors. Also sighted are white-tailed deer, Florida gopher tortoises, American alligators, raccoons and nine-banded armadillos. Recreational activities Activities include walking, running, inline skating, hiking, horseback riding, biking, and viewing wildlife. Hours and fees Florida state parks are open between 8 a.m. and sundown every day of the year (including holidays). There is no admission necessary to use the park. Accessibility The trail has four trailheads with parking areas specifically for the trail, each spaced approximately apart. These are located in Polk City at the intersection of State Road 33 and County Road 665; Green Pond, FL at the intersection of Green Pond Road and the trail itself; Bay Lake at the intersection of Bay Lake Road (County Road 565) and the trail itself; and finally in Mabel where the trail intersects with State Road 50. The right of way for the former railroad line continues north on its way to Coleman. This line carried the Silver Meteor between Coleman and Auburndale until 1988, and had a bridge under SR 50 until the early-2010s. Amenities Amenities include a picnic pavilion, several picnic tables, restrooms, and drinking fountains. Parking, restrooms, and drinking fountains are available at all four trailheads.

It is the second oldest business still in operation in the city, founded in 1911 as the Zephyrhills Colonist. It publishes every Thursday. The newspaper is owned by Linville Enterprises LLC, the publisher is Danny Linville, and the editor is Jan Linville. Its marketing campaign says it is the \\"local source since 1911.\\" Daily papers in the market include the Pasco Tribune published by the Tampa Tribune, and the Pasco Times published by the St. Petersburg Times. History The birth of the newspaper can be attributed to the efforts of Civil War Capt. H.B. Jeffries, who started the Colony Co. to help create a retirement community in Florida for retiring former Union soldiers. After finding land in Pasco County, Jeffries named the rolling land \\"Zephyrhills\\" and began to sell parcels. Needing an avenue to advertise real estate, Jeffries looked to a soldier who once saved his life, G.H. Gibson, to start a newspaper. Gibson, who was the publisher of a newspaper in Loup City, Nebraska called The Standard Gauge, accepted what was considered a \\"lucrative\\" offer from Jeffries to move to the new Zephyrhills and start the Zephyrhills Colonist a year later. Gibson had his entire plant shipped by rail to Zephyrhills, but the equipment arrived before the press plant itself was completed. So, for the first several months of its existence, the Colonist was written, composed and printed outside. The equipment would be covered each night while staff members would stand guard until the roof and walls were completed. A decade later, Sam Lovett would take over the paper and rename it the Zephyrhills News. He, in turn, sold the paper to a group of Zephyrhills businessmen in 1930 led by Dr. Bernard A. Thomas, a dentist. Following Thomas' death, the paper was purchased by Walter Gall who sold the newspaper to Howard Berg in 1948. In 1950, the paper was sold again, this time to George Johnson, who owned newspapers in Kentucky, Tennessee and Florida. However, Johnson himself died soon after the purchase was complete, and his widow sold the publication back to the Gibson family, with Floyd Gibson‚ÄîG.H.'s son‚Äîtaking over. After Floyd became mayor of Zephyrhills, he sold the paper to a Rock Island, Ill. journalist named George Wickstrom in 1955. His son, Bernie Wickstrom, would become editor-in-chief. The younger Wickstrom remained its editor until his death on Sept. 10, 1987. George Wickstrom sold the paper to The New York Times Company on Dec. 15, 1978. In the 1980s, the paper would change hands twice, first to Asterisk Publishing Company in 1984 and later Republic Newspapers in 1988. The paper's current owners, Danny and Jan Linville, purchased the paper from Scripps Zephyrhills News LLC on June 4, 2009. Office locations The offices of the paper were once located on Fifth Avenue where the current First Baptist Church of Zephyrhills now stands. In 1947, the paper moved to Sixth Street. Eight years later, it had moved back to Fifth Avenue where a consignment shop currently sits. It would move into its current facility at 38333 Fifth Avenue on Feb. 22, 1959. Community impact * Alice Hall, a reporter for the paper during the Bernie Wickstrom era, has a recreation center named after her in the city. * Editor Bernie Wickstrom has a bandstand named after him near the Alice Hall center on the shores of Lake Zephyr. * In the late 1970s, when the city's police chief, Bill Eiland, was fired, intensive coverage from the paper led a community outcry that ended with Florida's first successful recall election. Two city council members were removed, and their replacements rehired Eiland. The city has since named a gazebo after him while Pasco County officials have named a boulevard in his memory. * Floyd Gibson, a former publisher of the paper and son of the newspaper's founder, was elected mayor in the 1950s but, ran into some trouble when he didn't like what his former newspaper was printing about the city's administration. According to stories of that time period, Gibson‚Äîwho as mayor ran the police department‚Äîhad a reporter for the paper arrested and jailed without food or water for three days. The jailing came apparently after the reporter punched Gibson in the face. Editors * G.H.

They are fronted by vocalist/keyboardist/guitarist Bill Champlin, who later joined rock band Chicago, from 1981‚Äì2009, placing Sons of Champlin on hiatus from 1981‚Äì1996. They brought to the late 60's music scene in the Bay Area a soulful sound built around a horn section, sophisticated arrangements, philosophical themes, Bill Champlin's songwriting and blue-eyed soul singing, and Terry Haggerty's jazz-based guitar. They are one of the 1960s San Francisco bands, along with Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead and Moby Grape. Early years Champlin started his musical career in high school (Tamalpais in Mill Valley) as a member of a local band, The Opposite Six. One of his teachers encouraged Champlin to drop out of school and pursue music full-time. In 1965 the draft claimed the drummer and bass player of the Opposite Six, and Champlin joined forces with guitarist Terry Haggerty, sax player Tim Cain, bassist John Prosser and drummer Jim Meyers in the band that became the Sons of Champlin. By late 1967 the lineup had changed to include keyboardist/saxman Geoff Palmer, trumpeter Jim Beem, bassist Al Strong, and drummer Bill Bowen, creating a Hammond B3-and-horns sound that was distinctive from the rest of the Bay Area's psychedelic guitar bands. The Sons recorded their first album, Fat City in 1967 for Trident Records, owned by Kingston Trio manager Frank Werber. They released a single, \\"Sing Me a Rainbow,\\" (B-side \\"Fat City\\") which got airplay in the Bay Area but did not crack the national charts. The plan was to follow this release with another song from the album, a Barry Mann/Cynthia Weil composition called \\"Shades of Grey\\", but the Monkees released their version before this could happen. The album was not released and the Sons left Trident Records. In February 1999, this collection was released on a British CD under the title Fat City. During the late 1960s, The Sons of Champlin performed regularly at the San Francisco venues, the Avalon Ballroom and the Fillmore West and the (former) Chateau Libert√© venue in the mountains above San Jose. They shared billing with, among many others, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Country Joe and the Fish, and The Youngbloods. They were also the opening act at The Band's first concert at which they used the name \\"The Band,\\" along with The Ace of Cups. History (1968-1977) In 1968, the Sons of Champlin signed with Capitol Records, releasing their double-album debut Loosen Up Naturally in April 1969. The group followed up with The Sons released that fall. To promote this album The Sons set out on a two-month national tour, culminating with an engagement at the Fillmore East. However, this tour strained relations between the members and in February 1970, The Sons broke up. Bill Champlin moved to Santa Cruz, where he joined Moby Grape guitarist Jerry Miller in a short-lived project called The Rhythm Dukes. The Sons reformed in late 1970 as a five- piece band without Cain to record Follow Your Heart, their final Capitol LP. However, The Sons broke up once more following the album's release in April, 1971. When the group reformed again in the summer it featured a new rhythm section, with drummer Bill Vitt and bassist David Schallock (from Big Brother and the Holding Company) replacing Bowen and Strong, respectively. Briefly, the group went by the name Yogi Phlegm, as which they played one of the last concerts at Bill Graham‚Äôs Fillmore West on July 3, 1971. In 1972, James Preston replaced Bill Vitt on drums, and the band once again went by the name Sons of Champlin. After recording their 1973 Columbia album, Welcome to the Dance, as a five piece, The Sons once again added a horn section, which included Mark Isham, now a film scorer and composer, on trumpet and synthesizer. In 1975, The Sons recorded The Sons of Champlin in their own studio, and released it on their own label, Goldmine Records. This was purchased and re-released by Ariola America. The next two albums, Circle Filled With Love and Loving is Why, were also released on Ariola. On August 6, 1977, the Sons of Champlin played what many assumed to be their last gig at the Kirkwood Meadows ski resort opening for Elvin Bishop and Dave Mason. After this performance, Champlin left the group to pursue work as a session vocalist in Los Angeles. The Sons released seven albums between 1969 and 1977, including Loosen Up Naturally, Welcome to the Dance, and Circle Filled With Love. The albums were generally well-reviewed, but were low sellers. In 1977, Champlin went solo, recording Single (1978) and Runaway (1981), before joining Chicago in 1981. Later years After Bill Champlin departed, The Sons did continue briefly, through 1978, with former Pablo Cruise singer Bud Cockrell in place of Champlin. On November 25, 1985, the Sons reunited for the first time in a surprise appearance at the Fillmore in San Francisco on a bill with Huey Lewis and the News, KBC Band and a reunited Country Joe and the Fish. The reunion comprised Champlin, Terry Haggerty, Geoffrey Palmer, Tim Cain, David Schallock and James Preston with Huey Lewis and the News drummer Bill Gibson sitting in as well as the Freaky Executives Horn Section, who provided the brass. The 1985 show proved to be a one-off as Champlin returned to his regular gig with Chicago. But in 1997, the Sons got together again for a series of reunion gigs, then recorded and released their first live CD in 1998. Beginning in 2002, The Sons put out several CDs, Hip L'il Dreams and Secret (both produced by Gary Platt, Bill Champlin & Tom Saviano ), among them, and have also remastered much of their back catalog. The Sons of Champlin appeared with original members Champlin, Palmer, Schallock, Preston and Cain. Haggerty was replaced by Tal Morris then Carmen Grillo. Tom Saviano and Marc Russo of the Doobie Brothers were saxophone players during Cain's absence from the band. Tower of Power alumnus Mic Gillette handled trumpet, trombone, and tuba parts until his death in January 2016. After James Preston's death in 2014 Alan Hertz joined the band as its drummer with Jeff Lewis on trumpet. Bobby Vega was part of the band on bass upon the departure of Schallock, followed by Richard Mithun. Tamara Champlin was added as a vocalist and Douglas Rowan as the saxophone player. Solo artist, finalist on the Voice (TV series), Will Champlin, has guested with the Sons as a player and vocalist.

He was signed by the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent in 2006. He played college football at Southern California. He is the cousin of NFL Punter Robert Malone. Malone has also been a member of the New England Patriots, New York Sentinels, Seattle Seahawks, Sacramento Mountain Lions, and St. Louis Rams. Early years Malone went to Temescal Canyon High School. After beginning his football career at wide receiver he became a punter after discovering that he could kick the ball far better.Chris Huston, \\"Introducing Tom Malone, USC's New Punter\\", USC Athletics, Sept. 24, 2002, Accessed Apr. 21, 2006 After looking at USC, Stanford and Washington, he chose USC. Tom Malone - Profile, rivals.com, Accessed Apr. 21, 2006 He graduated a semester early and enrolled at USC in the spring of 2002. College career Malone entered the 2002 season as USC's first true freshman starting punter in ten years, playing all 13 games and averaging 42.1 yards on his 62 punts. He made the All-Freshman Team in several publications. In the 2003 season, the sophomore again appeared in all 13 games, averaging 49.0 yards (breaking the previous USC record) on his 42 punts. Malone earned first-team All-American honors from ESPN.com, SI.com and Collegefootballnews.com, becoming USC's first-ever All-American punter. Malone was a lead contender for the national punting title, but because of USC's very efficient offense that year he was five punts shy of having the NCAA-required minimum 3.6 punts per game to be listed‚Äîhis 49.0 average was 1.0 yards above the national leader. Going into his junior season, Malone had become a fan favorite due to the novelty of having an All-American punter at a school that dominated offensively. A USC fan began a humorous and well-meaning \\"Malone4Heisman\\" campaign that received attention from both his teammates (including that year's actual Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart) and major sports media outlets. It was this campaign that dubbed Malone \\"the Bomb\\".Jack Carey and Malcolm Moran, Kickers, punters hoping to get foot in door, USA TODAY, January 4, 2006, Accessed December 3, 2008.Paul Gutierrez, He Should Get a Big Kick Out of This, Los Angeles Times, July 25, 2004, Accessed December 3, 2008. During the 2004 season, Malone again appeared in all 13 games, he averaging 43.8 yards on 49 punts. He ranked ninth nationally in punting (43.8, first in Pac-10) and was a semifinalist for the 2004 Ray Guy Award. His performance at the 2005 FedEx Orange Bowl earned him a place on CBS Sportsline.com's All-Bowl Team. In the summer before his senior season, Malone injured his right hip during workouts which limited his ability to practice during the season.Dan Weber, Ex-USC standout Malone making comeback in NFL Europa, The Press-Enterprise, June 2, 2007. During his final season, the USC offense performed better than it had in his previous seasons: averaged 50 points a game and only allowing Malone 30 punts in 12 games, lower than any previous season. USC did not punt during his final home game, a 66-19 offensive explosion against rival-UCLA. Despite the step backwards, Malone took things well saying, \\"From a team standpoint, this could not have gone better. It's the most fun you could ever imagine. From a personal standpoint, it's been a little frustrating.\\"Gary Klein, The punter who rarely punts still eyes NFL, Los Angeles Times, C-8, Dec. 25, 2005, Accessed Apr. 21, 2006 He graduated from USC in 2006 with a degree in political science.

New England Patriots The New England Patriots signed Malone to their practice squad on December 20, 2006. When former USC teammate Mario Danelo died in January 2007, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick gave him a week off and paid to send him to the funeral. He was re-signed to a future contract on January 23, 2007, but was waived on August 22, 2007.

He founded the Afro-American Life Insurance Company in Jacksonville, Florida, and became the state's first African-American millionaire. He also founded the National Register-listed community of American Beach, founded as a prestigious vacation spot for blacks during the period of racial segregation. BiographyBusiness legacy Along with seven other business associates, Lewis founded the Afro-American Insurance Association in 1901. The company headquarters burned down in the Great Fire of 1901, but Lewis and the others relocated the business to Lewis' home and renamed it the Afro-American Life Insurance Company. During this time Lewis served as treasurer, and he became the president of Afro-American Life in 1919. Eventually the company acquired Chathorn Mutual Life Insurance Company and expanded into Georgia. Lewis helped to found both the Negro Business League and the National Negro Insurance Association. He was a heavy contributor to black colleges such as Jacksonville's Edward Waters College as well as Bethune-Cookman College. Due to the Jim Crow laws of the day, blacks were not allowed to enjoy many basic recreational amenities. A.L. Lewis realized the need for African Americans to have recreational activities for their families, so he founded the Lincoln Golf and Country Club, which featured a clubhouse and facilities. In 1935, Lewis purchased of Nassau County beachfront land along the Atlantic Ocean. Blacks were not permitted on most beaches in Jacksonville, and it was Lewis' dream to create a community where African Americans could visit and own reasonably-priced homes along the ocean. This community, which he named American Beach, was a thriving vacation spot throughout the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. Summers at American Beach were known for being jammed with families, churches and children. The beach included hotels, restaurants and nightclubs as well as homes and other businesses. A.L. Lewis died in 1947 and was interred in the family crypt in a historic black Jacksonville cemetery. The grave is along the road with a plaque marker placed by the city inscribed with his biography. There is a street as well as a youth center named in his honor. Lewis married Mary Kingsley Sammis, the great granddaughter of Zephaniah Kingsley, a slaveowner and trader, and his wife and former slave Anna Magjigine Jai, whose homestead on Fort George Island is preserved as Kingsley Plantation.Jackson, Antoinette; Burns, Allan (January 2006). Ethnohistorical Study of the Kingsley Plantation Community , National Park Service, p. 24. All three of his great-grandchildren are achievers: MaVynee Betsch was known for educating the public on their family history and her efforts to preserve American Beach. Dr. Johnnetta B. Cole became the first woman to serve as president of two major universities, Spelman College and Bennett College. John Betsch is an internationally acclaimed jazz drummer.

They are currently members of the and play at Woodmarsh on the southern edge of the town. History A Trowbridge Town team was originally formed in 1880 and became one of the founding members of the Bristol & District League in 1892, finishing as runners-up in the league's first season. They stayed in the Bristol league for three seasons and then joined the Western League where they stayed until 1958 apart from two occasions; firstly between 1898 and 1901 when they resigned from the league, secondly 1907‚Äì1913 when they joined the Wiltshire County League. After success in the Western League, in 1958 they won promotion to the Southern League. In 1981, Trowbridge won promotion to the Football Conference (then known as the Alliance Premier League) where they played for three seasons before being relegated back to the Southern League where they remained until folding in 1998. A new team was quickly formed and the Club joined the Wiltshire County League for the 1999‚Äì2000 season, where they won the County Intermediate League in their debut season and then joined the County Senior League following improvements to the Woodmarsh Ground. After achieving the Wiltshire League Championship and Wilts Senior Cup double in the 2003‚Äì04 season, and conducting further ground improvements, they gained promotion to the Hellenic Football League. At the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season the club was relegated from the Hellenic league to the Wiltshire League, as despite finishing bottom of the league, the relegation was voluntary as so that the club could comply with an agreement with the FA and Hellenic League Feeder leagues to relegate a bottom placed club if the facilities did not comply with the grade required. Ground Trowbridge Town play their home games at Axe and Cleaver Ln, Woodmarsh, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, BA14 0SB. Previously they played at Timbrell Street, the Flower Show Field, the Bythesea Road ground from (1923 - 1934) and Frome Road (1934 - 1998).

Biography  Ellen Dougherty was born at Cutters Bay, Port Underwood, New Zealand. Ellen was inspired to be a nurse after learning about Florence Nightingale. It is believed that before nurse training, she worked with Charles Barraud in his Wellington pharmacy. She trained at Wellington Hospital from 1885 and completed a certificate in nursing in 1887. In 1893 she accepted the post of matron ofthe newly-opened Palmerston North Hospital. In 1899 she was formally registered as a pharmacist. In 1901, New Zealand became the first country to pass legislation, the Nurses Registration Act, on the registration of nurses. Dougherty was then the first to be registered on 10 January 1902. She retired in 1908. Dougherty is buried at Clareville Cemetery, Carterton, New Zealand. Her medal is at the Nurses Chapel at Wellington Hospital.

The Fire Scout is designed to provide reconnaissance, situational awareness, aerial fire support and precision targeting support for ground, air and sea forces. The initial RQ-8A version was based on the Schweizer 330, while the enhanced MQ-8B was derived from the Schweizer 333. The larger MQ-8C Fire Scout variant is based on the Bell 407. As of February 2018, 23 MQ-8B variants were in service with the U.S. Navy.Navy Evaluates Man-Machine Pairing with New Fire Scout . National Defense Magazine. 27 February 2018. Design and development=RQ-8A As the US Navy was withdrawing its RQ-2 Pioneers from service, it began to seek a second generation UAV. The Navy requirement specified a vertical takeoff & landing (VTOL) aircraft, with a payload capacity of 90 kg (200 lb), a range of 125 miles (200 km), an endurance on station of three hours at an altitude of , and the ability to land on a ship in a 46 km/h (29 mph) wind. The UAV was to fly 190 hours before planned maintenance. There were three finalists in the competition, which was designated \\"VTOL-UAV\\" or \\"VTUAV\\". Bell, Sikorsky, and a collaboration of Teledyne Ryan and Schweizer Aircraft submitted designs. The Ryan-Schweizer UAV was selected as the winner in the spring of 2000. The RQ-8A Fire Scout, as it was named, was a derivative of the Schweizer three-passenger, turbine powered 330SP helicopter, with a new fuselage, new fuel system, and UAV electronics and sensors. The initial prototype of the Fire Scout was piloted in initial tests, flying autonomously for the first time in January 2000. The Rolls-Royce 250-C20 turbine engine ran on JP-8 and JP-5 jet fuel (the latter of which has a higher flashpoint and is considered safe for shipboard storage and use). The Fire Scout was to be fitted with a sensor ball turret that carries electro- optic and infrared cameras, and a laser range finder. It was to be controlled over a data link derived from the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV, operating over a line of sight to a distance of 172 miles (280 km). The control system was to be fitted onto a ship, or could be carried on a Humvee light vehicle for US Marine service. MQ-8B An MQ-8B Fire Scout displayed at the Royal International Air Tattoo, RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, England, July 2007 Although progress on the project had been regarded as satisfactory, the Navy decided the Fire Scout didn't meet their needs after all, and cut funding for production in December 2001. However, the development program continued, and Northrop Grumman pitched a range of improved configurations to anyone who was interested. As it turned out, the U.S. Army was very interested, awarding a contract for seven improved RQ-8B evaluation machines in late 2003. In 2006, it was redesignated MQ-8B. The MQ-8B features a four- blade main rotor, in contrast to the larger-diameter three-blade rotor of the RQ-8A, to reduce noise and improve lift capacity and performance. The four- blade rotor had already been evaluated on Fire Scout prototypes. They increase gross takeoff weight by , to with payloads of up to for short-range missions. The MQ-8B is long, wide, and tall. The MQ-8B is fitted with stub wings which serve both an aerodynamic purpose as well as an armament carriage location. Weapons to be carried include Hellfire missiles, Viper Strike laser-guided glide weapons, and, in particular, pods carrying the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS), a laser-guided 70 mm (2.75 in) folding-fin rocket, which the Army saw as ideal for the modern battlefield. The Army was also interested in using the Fire Scout to carry up to of emergency supplies to troops in the field. The MQ-8B is being modified to permit rapid swap out of payload configurations. The current sensor configuration of a day/night turret with a laser target designator will remain an option. Alternate sensor payloads in consideration include a TSAR with Moving Target Indicator (MTI) capability, a multispectral sensor, a SIGINT module, the Target Acquisition Minefield Detection System (ASTAMIDS), and the Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL). The Army wanted the Fire Scout to operate as an element of an integrated ground sensor network as well. In April 2006, production on the flight test airframes was initiated at Northrop Grumman's Unmanned Systems production plant in Moss Point, Mississippi. The first flight of the MQ-8B took place on 18 December 2006 at Naval Air Station Patuxent River. The Army interest revived Navy interest in the program, with the Navy ordering eight Sea Scout MQ-8B derivatives for evaluation. In January 2010, the Army terminated its involvement with the Fire Scout, contending that the RQ-7 Shadow UAV could meet the Army's needs.Army to end robotic vehicle, aircraft efforts TheHill.com In 2009, the Navy approved low-rate initial production. The MQ-8B complements the manned aviation detachments onboard Air Capable ships and is deployed along with a MH-60R HSM detachment or a MH-60S HSC detachment. With the planned addition of radar, AIS, and weapons, the MQ-8B shall have many capabilities of the manned MH-60R. It will give air detachments greater flexibility in meeting mission demands, and will free manned aircraft.

In the domain of private law his most notable research was on family structure and the unique Montenegrin civil code of 1888. He is considered to be a pioneer in the sociology of law and sociological jurisprudence. He was also a follower of the German Historical School of law, and may be considered as a transitional figure between the Historical School and sociological approaches to law.Stephan Meder. Valtazar Bogi≈°iƒá und die Historische Schule. Rechtssoziologische und rechtsethnologische Folgerungen aus Savignys Rechtsquellenlehre, in: Ged√§chtnisschrift f√ºr Valtazar Bogisic, vol. 1. Page 517-537 In 1902 Bogisic was elected president of the International Institute of Sociology in Paris. Valtazar Bogi≈°iƒá by Vlaho Bukovac, 1892 Early life Bogi≈°iƒá's family were prominent merchants in Cavtat, a small coastal town near Dubrovnik. His grandfather moved to Cavtat from nearby inland, from a village called Mrcine in Konavle where the Bogi≈°iƒá clan had lived for centuries after converting from Eastern Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism in the 15th century.Spomenica Valtazara Bogi≈°iƒáa, Dubrovnik 1938/1940, p. 35 Bogi≈°iƒá was born in Cavtat on 20 December 1834. His mother died giving birth to his sister Marija, his only sibling, two years later. His father wanted him to continue his family business and thought that prolonged schooling would interfere with that. When he was four years old he was sent to a private girls' school, the only private school in town, because only six- year-olds could enter a public school. He later entered state accredited school which he left before graduating. Subsequently, when he was 11 he finished a two-year nautical school. He was four to five years younger than all other graduates. The most significant person in his childhood was his grandfather Valtazar Bogi≈°iƒá Senior. At the time he was already blind and told him a lot of folk stories as well as about his adventures on the sea, traveling, meeting important people like Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, and authorized his grandson to run his errands and even simple court cases. In his last will his grandfather left Bogi≈°iƒá half of his estate. With no proper formal education, Bogi≈°iƒá was buying a lot of books. When his father didn't give him money he would get it from his grandfather. Among his favorites were the ones by Serbian reformer Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá. Inspired by Vuk, his lifelong model, he started searching for and writing down Serbian folk poems.Spomenica Valtazara Bogi≈°iƒáa, Dubrovnik 1938/1940, p. 69 After a lot of persuasion and a sea accident, his father allowed him to enter 4-year grammar school (Progymnasium) on condition that he not take his final exams as a guarantee that he wouldn't obtain the necessary documents for further schooling. At that time, Bogi≈°iƒá started learning German on his own. He already spoke Italian as it was, lingua franca of the region, at the time. In that time Bogi≈°iƒá was acquainted with Dubrovnik's count Niko Puciƒá (Pozza) the Great. This lifelong friend convinced him to take final exams despite his father's will and helped him prepare for them. Count Niko Puciƒá and his brother Medo Puciƒá (Orsato) were the most prominent people in Dubrovnik at the time. They gathered the intellectual elite which formed a Serb Catholic movement in Dubrovnik that would disappear in the beginning of the 20th century. A turning point in Bogi≈°iƒá's life was the death of his father, in 1856. Intrigues about the inheritance and family business followed but after two years Bogi≈°iƒá managed to get the papers in order and recuperate what the cousins had taken. In 1858 he entered the Ginnasio Liceale di S.Caterina di Padua and later entered the prestigious Liceo Foscarini, the oldest highschool in Venice, where he majored in Italian language and literature and got closer to the spirit of Italian national movement. Academic education After graduating in Venice, thanks to friends, Bogi≈°iƒá got an Austrian scholarship which he refused because it had a condition that he could only study at Austrian universities. During his studies he was involved with patriotic and pan-Slavic circles. He studied philology, philosophy (including history) and law, and the studies also included some modern courses such as political economy. He was reading in Vienna, Berlin, Munich and Paris with many notable professors like Franz Bopp, the founder of comparative linguistics, Prussian historian Johann Gustav Droysen, Franz Miklosich, one of the most famous Slavic philologists, the founder of sociology Lorenz von Stein and many famous lawyers such as Theodor Mommsen, Rudolf von Jhering and few notable members of German Historical School of Law. He obtained a Phd in Philosophy in Giessen in 1862, defending the thesis entitled \\"On Causes of Defeat of the Prussian Army in Hussite War\\". There he strongly referred to the research of historian Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω. He obtained a law degree Rigorosum, the oral part of the doctoral examination in 1865, in Vienna, since at the time he was already employed and had been practicing. When he was appointed professor in Odessa he was also awarded the Juris Doctor Honoris Causa. Professional life and public activities=Vienna Thanks to the certificate issued by Miklosich stating that \\"besides being a native speaker of Serbian and Italian (Bogi≈°iƒá) speaks all other Slavic languages\\",Kidriƒç, Dr. Balthasar Anton Bogi≈°iƒá in der kk. Hofbibliothek Wien, ASPh 31 (1910), 305‚Äì312 after obtaining a PhD in Giessen, in 1862/63 Bogi≈°iƒá was hired as an administrator of the Slavia Department at the Viennese court library. There however he also administered the legal department as well as publications from the French Revolution. As an administrator of the Slavia Department, he had the opportunity not only to read important books by Slavic writers but also to meet many of their authors. In Vienna of the day different organizations were founded gathering members of different peoples from the Empire. Bogi≈°iƒá participated in the foundation of the club named Slovanska beseda which was, at first, a gathering all Slavs from around the Empire and was later reorganized into a Czech-club. Upon Bogi≈°iƒá's initiative, a special Slavic library was formed in the club (Slovanska biblioteka) and Bogi≈°iƒá was its first president. At this time, Bogi≈°iƒá supported United Serbian Youth (Ujedinjena omladina srpska), and remained their supporter for the rest of his life. The organization pleaded for the real unification of Serbs and Croats into a single Yugoslav nation and not only their formal common political actions, which was the idea of Yugoslavia for many Croatian intellectuals. After the founding of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, Bogi≈°iƒá was one of its most significant writers. The Academy was established in Zagreb as a common scientific institution of south Slavic peoples. The first president was a Croat Franjo Raƒçki, and the first secretary a Serb ƒêuro Daniƒçiƒá. During his stay in Vienna, he was collecting documents about Dubrovnik's 17th century diplomat ‚Äì Stjepan Gradiƒá. He continued collecting Serbian epic poetry, which he had started in his youth, and in 1863 he spent the holidays in Mostar, listening to the epic poets gathered around the newly built orthodox church. As early as 1866, he conducted in all the regions of the Balkans a sociological inquiry with many questions concerning the forms of landed property in the country, the social structure of the village, customs, institutions and family community, etc. Using this data, he particularly worked out in detail the problem of direct observation, the comparative methods, the volume of use of statistics and the analysis of documents. In 1867 he issued a book \\"Pravni obiƒçaji kod Slovena\\" (Legal customs of the Slavs). He mainly based his work on written sources, but he already started questioning his friends about the legal reasoning of the people in their regions. In 1872 he published a book \\"Pisani zakoni na Slovenskom Jugu\\" (Legal Status in the Slavic South). The idea was for this book to be an introduction to the serial, which was supposed to grasp written antique legal sources from the Slavic South. Since his youth, Bogi≈°iƒá was very fond of museums. He believed that establishing a Slavic museum (Slovenski Muzeum) would contribute to the presentation of Slavic heritage, and rising consciousness about it, among the Slavs and others. In his publication \\"Slovenski Muzeum\\", he responded to the \\"Slavofobs\\" of the day, who argued that Slavic peoples had to develop on their own, like the Germanic or Romanic nations had previously. Here he showed himself to be a panslavist. This, among all Slavs, was a very popular 19th-century movement, originating from Poland and Bohemia, and is today a surpassed form of a collective idealization and identification. In 1867/68, after the years spent at the Court Library, Bogi≈°iƒá entered the Austro-Hungarian Ministry of Defence, and was named Councilor for Education in the Austrian Military Frontier based in Temesvar in the Banat. The population there was already used to a high degree of self- governance which is why several attempts to improve the school system failed. Regardless, Austria intended to introduce a stronger school system. Odessa After refusing offers from the Universities in Kiev and Warsaw, he accepted a professorship at the newly established Russian University in Odessa. After becoming a Russian citizen and a public servant in 1869, he gave his introductory lecture in Odessa in 1870. His most notable success in Odessa was the foundation of the Slavic Library, while as a professor, he didn't have much success because already in 1871 he caused (as it later turned out ‚Äì orchestrated) mass student protests. The Austrian press wrote that Bogi≈°iƒá \\"being a Serb was called to Odessa only due to panslavic respect\\"Zimmermann, 1962, p. 142 and in reality he was not welcomed in Russia. He continued teaching but without the previous enthusiasm. When his request for early retirement was denied, he tried to spend as much time on study trips so he even studied, on sight, legal customs at the Caucasus. He officially remained a professor of the Odessa University but already in 1873, following the orders of the czar, as a Russian subject, he left for Montenegro with a task to codify private law. Montenegro and France In Montenegro, the newspapers wrote that the new Civil Code had already been written before Bogi≈°iƒá even got there. Bogi≈°iƒá, however, persuaded Montenegro's sovereign Nicholas I to wait and explained that work on the code would take years. Earlier, Bogi≈°iƒá had prepared and published questionnaires for collecting legal customs. These were translated into several languages and established Bogi≈°iƒá as a pioneer of ethnological and sociological legal research. Based on the questionnaires, he published a Collection of legal customs of the south Slavs (Zbornik sada≈°njih pravnih obiƒçaja u ju≈ænih Slovena I, Graƒëa u odgovorima iz razliƒçnih krajeva slovneskoga juga), in 1874. Bogi≈°iƒá was not satisfied with the questionnaires because they only had around 300 questions about public and private law including matters of international public law. For the purpose of writing a civil code, he prepared a new questionnaire, which had 2000 questions, all of which were from the domain of private law. He was assisted by Gavro Vukoviƒá, one of the few trained jurists in Montenegro at the time. Bogi≈°iƒá's civil code for Montenegro, The General Property Code (better known in Serbian as Op≈°ti imovinski zakonik), was not proclaimed until 1888. During that time, Bogi≈°iƒá, who was still a Russian professor, established his residence in Paris and engaged in other assignments such as writing a constitution for the Serbian revolutionaries in Herzegovina and establishing state and legal order in Bulgaria which had just gained independence from the Ottoman Empire. In 1878 he published his famous collection of folk poems (Narodne pjesme iz starijih, najƒçe≈°ƒáe primorskih zapisa I). He also continued his research on sociological and historical aspects of the family. In legal matters he insisted on the separate codification of family and inheritance law, arguing that family law is not civil law stricto sensu and that inheritance is a family law institution. That is why he refused to incorporate family and inheritance law into the Montenegrin civil code that he wrote, consequently naming it ‚Äì The General Property Code. His draft constitution for Herzegovina from 1875, favors basic rights especially the ones pertaining to equality, and is written in the best Republican and liberal tradition thus reflecting the spirit of the local people as well as Bogi≈°iƒá's convictions from his youth. The Constitution is paradigmatic for Bogi≈°iƒá's nomotechnics. With a good eye for the social condition and needs, he managed to transform political ideals into a legal text acceptable for a common man. Such a method would mark The General Property Code for the Principality of Montenegro which contains a strong idealization of people's legal reasoning. If he had to choose between what is rightful/just and what's in the people's reasoning and legal customs, he always chose the rightful solution. During his work on the General Property Code, besides legal customs Bogi≈°iƒá considered well-established institutions of Roman Law. That is how Bogi≈°iƒá's Property Code is, at the same time, based on the notion of just, reception of Roman law and people's mind. Bogi≈°iƒá was especially thoughtful about the language of the code, so the actual code is written in a more polished manner than his other works. Such legal style served as an example for the 19th-century legislation in the Kingdom of Serbia. Even in the second half of the 20th century, the Belgrade legal school referred to Bogi≈°iƒá's code as its role-model and starting point. In that context, Bogi≈°iƒá's code was written at just the right time, when laws in the kingdom of Serbia were written in pure vernacular as was the case with Bogi≈°iƒá's Code. Most Yugoslav laws, given that they were written in Belgrade in the institutional frameworks previously established in the Kingdom of Serbia, belong to this legal-language tradition. Paris and Final years After finalizing his work on the Code, Bogi≈°iƒá was for some time the Minister of Justice in the Principality of Montenegro. Afterward, in 1899, the second and last improved version of the General Property Code was published. He then continued to live in Paris as a retired Russian professor. He was active in many Parisian scientific societies. In 1902 he was elected President of International Institute of Sociology. He lived as prominent citizen in Paris and was often visited by law students from different countries. Especially in those years he often came back to ideas of the United Serbian Youth and prepared a study on Serbo-Croatian controversy. When he left his hometown and Dubrovnik, as a young man, the cultural elite there saw the Dubrovnik heritage as a part of a rising modern Serbian culture. However, at turn of the century, there was great conflict between Serbs and Croats about Dubrovnik's legacy. Considering himself a Serb, Bogi≈°iƒá in those days published his autobiography in the Serbian Annual \\"Dubrovnik\\" as well as several articles in the Serbian patriotic paper from Dubrovnik ‚Äì \\"Srƒë\\". Bogi≈°iƒá died in Fiume (Rijeka), on the way to his hometown Cavtat in 1908. Legacy and name controversy According to the testimonies of Bogi≈°iƒá's Parisian friends, Bogi≈°iƒá seriously considered establishing a foundation in Belgrade which would, after his death, take care of his legacy especially the scientific library and archive, and give scholarships to prosperous young lawyers for studying abroad. Bogi≈°iƒá chose the Serbian capital Belgrade, fearing that his rich scientific collection might otherwise end up in Austrian hands, who had a hostile attitude toward Slavic culture back in the days before the First World War.Viktor Novak, Testamentarni planovi Valtazara Bogi≈°iƒáa, Zbornik Filozofsko fakulteta, 1964, 653 At that time, his hometown Cavtat was a part of Austro-Hungary. Since he eventually died with no last will, his sister Marija, who lived in Cavtat, inherited the whole estate including his scientific library and archive. 18,000 books including many rare antiques; 10,000 letters; various notes; ethnological and numismatic collections were kept in Cavtat in inadequate conditions for years. After World War II, the scientific library and archive was incorporated into the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. It was then officially named the Baltazar Bogi≈°iƒá Collection ('). Bogi≈°iƒá Monument at his birthplace Cavtat Since Italian was an official language in the area of his birth, Bogi≈°iƒá's birth certificate is written in Italian and the Latin language. Bearing his grandfather's name, Bogi≈°iƒá signed all of his works, in all languages, as Valtazar Bogi≈°iƒá and it was the name by which he was recognized by his contemporaries. Since his autobiography was first published in the local paper called \\"Dubrovnik\\", the editor noted that the usual nickname for Baldassaro (Italian for Valtazar) in Dubrovnik is Baldo, and consequently referred to him as such with affection. After his death Croatian authors started occasionally calling him Baltazar Bogi≈°iƒá, taking it for the Croatian version of his name. That is why his archive-memorial in his birthplace Cavtat, in today's Croatia, has Baltazar in its name, although that is not how he ever referred to himself. He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.

History rightThe Boston Park League (BPL) was founded in 1929 by Bob Cusick, program director for the Boston Parks and Recreation Department. Cusick envisioned a high quality, yet highly participatory, amateur baseball league with teams based in, and featuring residents of, the various neighborhoods of Boston. Charlestown, East Boston, South Boston, Hyde Park, Brighton, West Roxbury, Roslindale, Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, Mattapan, South End, and Dorchester all have had teams at some period of time. The league was rabidly popular among local area baseball fans, and in the 1930s and 1940s many games would draw as many as 5,000 attendees. Once the playoffs got underway, that number was known to swell to as many as 12,000 fans per game. Attendance remained high throughout the 1950s and 1960s, often in the range of 5,000 to 6,000 fans per game. Such popularity made the league among the best compilations of amateur talent in the nation, featuring top quality players from local and regional high schools and universities. At its peak, the BPL comprised a sizeable population of former professional players, many of whom still had hopes of garnering enough attention to get another shot at a professional position. The league has always been considered an amateur league, although for a brief period in the 1960s the league actually did pay a few select players, often higher profile ex-pros, in hopes of raising the league's profile and quality of play. Former Red Sox relief pitcher Mike Fornieles is a prime example, playing a number of years for the league's Supreme Saints. In recent decades, the league's presence has diminished somewhat, becoming less of a regional draw. However, the quality of play and passion among its players remain high. Attendance is also lower, with most games at present drawing a more modest number of fans, often less than 100 for mid-week, regular-season matchups, although some weekend and playoff games can still draw 500 or more attendees. The league is still considered to be the gold standard of amateur baseball in the Boston metropolitan area and, aside from the extremely competitive Cape Cod League, remains arguably the best amateur baseball league in New England. In 1982, the City of Boston decided to pass on the administrative duties to a small group of former players and coaches. The league named Bill Mahoney its first President, Harvey Soolman Secretary Treasurer, and Walt Mortimer Umpire in Chief. With the need for more funding, the Budweiser Brewing Co. of Medford, Ma., distributors of Bud Light, sponsored the league for four years. The Yawkey Foundation came on board in 1986, and has continuously sponsored the Boston Park League for the last 27 years. During the baseball strike of the mid-1990s, many Boston Park League players were granted spring training invitations by Major League teams, including 1993 BPL League Most Valuable Player Mike Carista, who was offered an invitation to spring training by the Boston Red Sox. Carista was a former Red Sox draft pick, but had left professional baseball years earlier. Under the guidance of veteran manager Jim Cody, All Dorchester Sports League (ADSL) has won the Boston Park League the past two seasons.

They are named after the physicist Louis Michel. Sometimes instead of \\\\delta, the product \\\\xi\\\\delta is quoted.

Muon decay Consider the decay of the positive muon: :\\\\mu^+\\\\to e^+ + u_e + \\\\bar u_\\\\mu. In the muon rest frame, energy and angular distributions of the positrons emitted in the decay of a polarised muon expressed in terms of Michel parameters are the following, neglecting electron and neutrino masses and the radiative corrections: :\\\\frac{d^2\\\\Gamma}{x^2dxd\\\\cos\\\\theta} \\\\sim (3-3x) + \\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\rho (4x-3) + P_{\\\\mu}\\\\xi\\\\cos\\\\theta [(1-x)+\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\delta(4x-3)], where P_{\\\\mu} is muon polarisation, x=E_e/E_e^{max}, and \\\\theta is the angle between muon spin direction and positron momentum direction.

Integration of this expression over electron energy gives the angular distribution of the daughter positrons: :\\\\frac{d\\\\Gamma}{d\\\\cos\\\\theta} \\\\sim 1 + \\\\frac{1}{3}P_{\\\\mu}\\\\cos\\\\theta.

It also has off-campus sites throughout the district, including Scott Air Force Base and the East St. Louis Community College Center.  History  The college was founded in 1946 as Belleville Junior College, operating under the jurisdiction of Belleville Township High School District 201. More than 60 percent of the 169 students enrolled for its first semester were World War II veterans who had just returned from service. In 1965, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Illinois Junior College Act, which created community college districts throughout the state. The following year, area residents voted to establish the Class I Belleville Junior College District 522. Belleville Junior College became Belleville Area College July 1, 1967. Construction of the Belleville Campus on Carlyle Avenue was completed in 1971. In 1983, the college opened the Granite City Center, followed by the Red Bud Center two years later. Both sites received approval for campus status from the Illinois Community College Board in July 1985. In 1999, a vote to change the name of Belleville Area College was passed. On January 1, 2000, the college name changed to Southwestern Illinois College.  Campuses  The college has three campuses, on Carlyle Avenue in Belleville, in Granite City and in Red Bud.  Organization and administration  The college president is Mr. Nick Mance.  Academics  The college offers associate degrees and certificates. SWIC also serves the community through Community Education, Programs and Services for Older Persons (PSOP), and Selsius‚Ñ¢ Corporate and Career Training.  Student life  There are no dorms on campus. Southwestern Illinois College has many clubs on all three campuses, including College Democrats and Phi Theta Kappa, as well as other college activities. Every year the students elect someone to represent them on the Board of Trustees of Southwestern Illinois College.  Sports  College athletics teams are called the Blue Storm.  Arts  The William and Florence Schmidt Art Center is located on the Belleville campus of the College.

The concession was originally made by the Matabele King to Sir John Swinburne. It was administered from the Bechuanaland Protectorate after 1893, but after 1911 was formally annexed to it, finally becoming a statutory creature by its first piece of legislation, the Proclamation Number 2 of 1911 by the High Commissioner of Bechuanaland. It was locally administered by a Justice of the Peace. The chief town of this region is Francistown, now one of Botswana's major settlements. The latest act governing and regulating this Concession is that of the \\"Tati Concessions Land Act of 1970\\". The most controversial provision in this act can be found in Section 6, which states that The right to all minerals and precious stones under the land in the Tati District is reserved to the Tati Concessions, Limited, and also the right of prospecting for and working the same, ... The effect of this section is that mineral rights are bestowed unto this body, which is unlike other mineral rights in Botswana which are governed by Section 3 of the \\"Mines and Minerals Act of 1999\\" to the effect that all minerals within Botswana, with the exception of Tati Concessions, are the property of the Republic of Botswana.

The Tati Concessions Limited ran into financial difficulties in 1914 and sold much of its land. The successor company, Tati Company, is registered in the United Kingdom. After independence, a deal was reached in February 1970 with the Government of Botswana under Seretse Khama. While many of its lands were donated or sold, it gained extensive mineral rights.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1977 to 2011. In 1994, Ahern was elected the sixth Leader of Fianna F√°il. Under Ahern's leadership, Fianna F√°il led three coalition governments. Ahern is the second-longest serving Taoiseach, after √âamon de Valera. Ahern resigned as Taoiseach on 6 May 2008, in the wake of revelations made in Mahon Tribunal, and was succeeded by Minister for Finance Brian Cowen. The Mahon Tribunal in 2012, found that Ahern, while not judged corrupt, had received money from developers and the Tribunal disbelieved his explanations of those payments. Fianna F√°il proposed to expel politicians censured by the tribunal, but Ahern resigned from the party prior to the expulsion motion being moved. In November 2016, it was announced that a decision had been made by Fianna F√°il to give Ahern the option of rejoining the party. Early life Ahern was born in Drumcondra, Dublin, the youngest of five children of Con and Julia (n√©e Hourihane) Ahern, both natives of County Cork, who married in October 1937. They settled at Church Avenue, Drumcondra, where they resided for the rest of their lives. The other four children are Maurice, Kathleen, Noel and Eileen. In Dublin, Ahern's father worked as a farm manager at All Hallows College, Drumcondra. Ahern's brother Noel is also involved in politics and represented Dublin North-West in D√°il √âireann. Ahern's father Con was born into a farming family near Ballyfeard, which is located near Kinsale, County Cork, in 1904. His mother also came from a farming background and was from near Castledonovan, west County Cork. Ahern's father, Con, initially left County Cork and went to Dublin in the early 1930s to train for the priesthood, but did not complete his studies with the Vincentian order. He had fought in the Irish Civil War. He was a supporter of √âamon de Valera and the Anti-Treaty IRA. He was a member of the 3rd Cork Brigade of the IRA. He remained a militant Irish Republican for decades after the War of Independence. Con Ahern died in 1990. Ahern's mother, Julia, died in 1998, aged 87 years. Ahern was educated at St. Patrick's National School, Drumcondra and at St. Aidan's Christian Brothers, Whitehall. He received his third level education at the College of Commerce, Rathmines, part of the Dublin Institute of Technology. Ahern has claimed or it has been claimed by others in circulated biographies that he was educated at University College Dublin and the London School of Economics, but neither university has any records that show Ahern was ever one of their students. He subsequently worked in the Accounts Department of the Mater Hospital, Dublin. Ahern is an enthusiastic and vocal fan of sport. He is a supporter of Dublin GAA and attends Dublin matches in Croke Park. He also supports Manchester United F.C. and attends matches at Old Trafford and rugby matches at Lansdowne Road. He appeared as a pundit on RT√â Two's The Premiership programme in 2001. Early political career Ahern first became involved in a Fianna F√°il by-election campaign in 1965, climbing lamp posts to hang election posters in Drumcondra.BBC Profile of Bertie Ahern 12 October 2008 During the campaign, Ahern met his political mentor and future Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. Ahern became a member of Fianna F√°il at the age of 17, and in the 1969 general election he assisted with the election campaign in his constituency. Ahern's first ran for office during the landslide 1977 general election, when Fianna F√°il formed the last single-party majority government with a 20-seat D√°il majority, the largest ever. Ahern received 4,000 first preference votes in the newly created Dublin Finglas constituency and was elected with transfers from other candidates. He was elected to Dublin Corporation at the 1979 local elections for the Cabra East-Finglas West Local electoral area (LEA). He later switched to the North Inner City LEA before standing down before the 1991 local elections. In subsequent elections Ahern became one of the highest vote-getters in the country. In his Dublin Central constituency Ahern was described as: During his first years as a Teachta D√°la (TD), Ahern was an anonymous backbencher, but did display ambition. In 1979, when Charles Haughey and George Colley, both constituency colleagues, fought a divisive battle for the position of party leader and Taoiseach, Ahern is believed to have backed Haughey. Ahern had served on a health committee with Haughey in the mid-1970s. Following Haughey's victory, Ahern was appointed Assistant-Government Chief Whip. In 1980, due to the illness of the actual Chief Whip, Se√°n Moore, he was effectively running the office. Ahern increased his personal vote in all three general elections of 1981 and 1982, even out- polling his running mate, George Colley, previously a candidate for Taoiseach. In the short-lived Fianna F√°il government of 1982, Ahern served as Government Chief Whip. Fianna F√°il were then consigned to the opposition benches for five years. During this period Ahern became Fianna F√°il Spokesperson on Labour. In 1986, he became Lord Mayor of Dublin. During his tenure he organised the Dublin Millennium festival. Cabinet career=Minister for Labour In 1987, Fianna F√°il returned to power as a minority government.Fianna F√°il website Profile of Bertie Ahern on the Fianna F√°il website 12 October 2008 Ahern became Minister for Labour, which was not considered an important portfolio. In the following years, the department was important in stimulating Ireland's ailing economy.Michael Taft \\"The Recession Diaries: Farewell, PDs ‚Äì We Wish We Hardly Knew Ye\\", Irishelection.com, 20 September 2008 On behalf of the government Bertie Ahern negotiated the first national wage agreement between unions and employers The Programme for National Recovery. This and the subsequent national wage agreement came to be known as the 'Irish model' and have been adopted by a number of European countriesSenan Molony \\"The 'unbaptised child' in the family of wage agreements\\", Irish independent, 18 September 2008 In 1989, Haughey called an early general election. Fianna F√°il lost seats and was forced into coalition government with the Progressive Democrats.Today Tonight RT√â, 12 July 1989 Ahern retained his position as Minister for Labour in the government of the 26th D√°il. In 1990, Ahern negotiated the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. In 1990, Ahern was campaign manager for the presidential bid of his cabinet colleague, Brian Lenihan.Brian Lenihan, Jnr Profile Brian Lenihan, Minister for Finance ‚Äì Political life of Brian starts now , The Sunday Tribune, 5 October 2008 It proved to be Ahern's least successful campaign as the apparently unbeatable Lenihan lost to Labour Party candidate Mary Robinson. Ahern was damaged in the short term by being seen as the first Fianna F√°il presidential election campaign manager to lose a presidential election. In 1991, the Fianna F√°il‚ÄìProgressive Democrats programme for government was reviewed. Ahern was a key player in these talks yet again. His involvement prompted Haughey to remark of Ahern: Minister for Finance In November 1991, Reynolds, then Minister for Finance, launched a leadership challenge to Haughey. Ahern publicly backed Haughey.Haughey was forced to resign in 1992 by revelations, of his complicity in phone tappings of journalists made by Se√°n Doherty. The challenge failed and Reynolds and his supporters were dismissed from the cabinet. In the reshuffle that followed, Ahern became Minister for Finance. According to statements given by Ahern while serving as Minister for Finance, he did not hold a personal bank account. Reynolds succeeds In early 1992, Charles Haughey resigned as Taoiseach. Ahern was encouraged by Haughey and others to bid for the position. He was apprehensive, and remained out of the contest, allowing Reynolds to become party leader and Taoiseach. It is believed that Reynolds and Ahern struck a deal in which Ahern would withdraw and thus remain in the cabinet, to succeed subsequently. Ahern and Michael Woods were the only two senior members to remain in the new Reynolds cabinet, with Ahern retaining his Finance portfolio. Following the 1992 general election, Fianna F√°il formed a coalition government with the Labour Party. This lasted until 1994, when the Labour Party withdrew from government, due to unhappiness with Reynolds's proposed candidate for President of the High Court. Ahern briefly succeeded Labour leader Dick Spring as T√°naiste. However, the government fell after a motion of no confidence, proposed by Fine Gael and Leader of the Opposition John Bruton, seconded by Fianna F√°il's former coalition partners the Labour Party. Reynolds resigned as Taoiseach and Fianna F√°il leader. During 1993, while he was Finance Minister, Ahern accepted payments of IR ¬£39,000 from various businessmen: see below for details. These payments did not become public knowledge until 2006. In 1993, Ahern said in an interview, that tax cheaters would be jailed. He is also under scrutiny from the Mahon Tribunal for this cash payment and subsequent revelations in May 2007, of cash received from businessman Miche√°l Wall. Leader of Fianna F√°il Ahern succeeded Reynolds as leader; the first unopposed candidate since Se√°n Lemass in 1959.Former Justice Minister M√°ire Geoghegan-Quinn briefly sought candidature, but did not launch a campaign. Ahern was elected as the sixth leader of Fianna F√°il on 19 November 1994. Negotiations for a resumption of government with the Labour Party began immediately. It was expected that the coalition would continue and that Ahern would become Taoiseach. However, due to new revelations, Labour withdrew from coalition, opting instead to go into coalition with Fine Gael. Ahern found himself as Leader of the Opposition. In the 1997 general election Fianna F√°il's campaign centred on Ahern's personal popularity. At the election, while Fianna F√°il picked up seats, its preferred coalition partner, the Progressive Democrats, lost more than half their seats. However, Labour suffered even heavier losses, leaving Fine Gael short of the support it needed to stay in office. Ahern quickly formed a coalition government with the Progressive Democrats, with the support of four Independent TDs. On 26 June 1997, aged 45, Ahern became the youngest ever Taoiseach. Taoiseach (1997‚Äì2002)=Early issues Ahern's first government saw some teething problems during its first six months. Firstly, Ahern tried to nominate David Andrews as Minister for Defence and as a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. This was unconstitutional as one Minister cannot be subordinate to another. Secondly, in July, Charles Haughey gave evidence to the McCracken Tribunal on corruption confirming that he had received IR¬£1.3 million (‚Ç¨1.7 million) in gifts from businessman Ben Dunne, which he had previously denied. This damaged Haughey's reputation more than the Government's. Thirdly, earlier allegations resurfaced about Ahern's Foreign Minister, Ray Burke. Burke eventually admitted to receiving IR¬£30,000 (‚Ç¨38,000) in a corrupt payment and chose to resign. Arising from those two matters, the government established the Moriarty Tribunal and the Flood Tribunal.The culture of potentially corrupt payments to politicians has continued from that era. In September 2006, details of financial support provided to Ahern by businessmen in 1993 and 1994, both in Ireland and Britain, emerged leading to strains in the coalition Government. Taoiseach details payments of IR¬£39,000 One of the high points of the first six months was the renewal of the Provisional IRA ceasefire, which paved the way for resumed negotiations in Northern Ireland. Peace process A significant achievement of Ahern's first term was his part in the negotiation of the Belfast Agreement, commonly called the Good Friday Agreement, in which the British and Irish Governments and most Northern Irish political parties established an \\"exclusively peaceful and democratic\\" framework for power- sharing in Northern Ireland. The agreement was signed on 10 April 1998. It was seen as something special, because not only was it endorsed by the political parties, it was endorsed also by the British and Irish governments and the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The agreement, the ceasefires and political structures it created have encouraged peace. The negotiations also led to his friendship with the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. On 26 November 1998, Blair became the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to address the Oireachtas. On 24 September 2003, Ahern and Blair were jointly awarded the Thomas J. Dodd Prize in International Justice and Human Rights for their work on the Good Friday Agreement to promote peace between Britain and Northern Ireland.Dodd Prize website, http://doddprize.uconn.edu/2003.htm On 22 May 2008, Ahern and Blair were both awarded honorary doctorates by Queen's University Belfast in recognition of their roles in the peace process. University Chancellor George Mitchell praised Mr Ahern as \\"a man of peace and a builder of bridges\\". Speaking at the 1916 Easter Rising commemoration at Arbour Hill in Dublin, in 1998, Ahern said Economy Ahern's first term in office, had been a period of high economic growth in Ireland, known as the Celtic Tiger. This was followed by a property boom which led to the economic crisis of 2008‚Äì2010 and culminated in the state requiring an IMF and EU bailout in 2010. In the first term increased prosperity and a better standard of living were the main results of the Celtic Tiger economy. There were significant deficits in the provision of infrastructure in the health and transport sectors. The good economic conditions allowed Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy, to deliver several generous budgets. The 1998 and 1999 Finance Acts included special tax incentives targeted at the area covered by the pilot Rural Renewal Scheme for the Upper Shannon Area. This scheme was later subject to criticism by the Heritage Council for being introduced without a ‚ÄòBaseline Audit‚Äô to inform the level and scale of development to be supported through the scheme, not identifying priority areas suitable for development, not providing any strategic protection for designated areas including the corridor of the River Shannon, nor promoting the use of sustainable design and building materials in any new build or refurbishment project supported by the scheme. This growth changed in 2008, with a difficult budget for 2008, brought forward by 2 months, as Ireland entered recession, with unemployment expected to rise 5.6% in 2008 and the construction industry in decline. Economic growth in 2008, had also slowed to its lowest levels in over a decade. In 2009, Ahern said his decision in 2001, to create the Financial Regulator was one of the main reasons for the collapse of the Irish banking sector and \\"if I had a chance again I wouldn't do it\\". 2002 general election The 28th D√°il served its full term, becoming the second longest D√°il to complete a full term. The coalition of Fianna F√°il and Progressive Democrats was re-elected with an increased majority in the 2002 general election on 17 May of that year. Fianna F√°il had hoped for a majority, but ultimately came up three seats short of the 84 required. Fine Gael was decimated, losing much of its front bench. The coalition Government returned to power, comprising Fianna F√°il and the eight Progressive Democrats TDs. It was the first time a Government had been re-elected since Jack Lynch's in 1969. Taoiseach (2002‚Äì2007) US President George W. Bush, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Ahern at Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland on 8 April 2003. Controversy arose when it was announced shortly afterwards that financial cutbacks were needed due to the drop in the international and Irish economies. This contradicted Fianna F√°il's promise during the election campaign when Finance Minister McCreevy was quoted several times saying that \\"no cutbacks, secret or otherwise, were planned\\". The government was accused of lying to the public, particularly concerning the war in Iraq (see below). The Government's rating fell badly in opinion polls and Ahern's popularity dropped to its minimum. Another issue in the government's agenda for 2002, was the upcoming 2002 Referendum nicknamed \\"Nice 2\\", this was a second attempt to pass the Treaty of Nice. During 2003, the government was subject to more controversy when it became public that US military aircraft, carrying large numbers of troops, were refuelling at Shannon Airport, despite widespread opposition to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Ireland's policy since the foundation of the State has been to be a neutral party in any conflict. The Government had maintained that troops had not used Shannon but when this was disproved, it then claimed that such permission had been available for 50 years. The drop in opinion poll ratings for Ahern and his government after the 2002 election, was followed in 2004, by Fianna F√°il's worst local election results in 80 years. Despite speculation, no leadership challenge occurred and Ahern recovered in the polls. His reputation for inaction in changing cabinet Ministers ended with his long-heralded 2004 Cabinet reshuffle in which he failed to sack S√©amus Brennan from the cabinet. The reshuffle was not as extensive as some had hoped as only three new members entered government. The unpopular phase seemed short-lived as the government rearranged its priorities and the economy grew. A notable law enacted by this government was the ban on smoking in workplaces and enclosed areas in March 2004. Improvements had been made in the transport infrastructure with the launch of the Luas light rail system in Dublin, many new motorways being built and the break-up of Aer Rianta, the state-owned Airport Management company. President George W. Bush accepts a bowl of shamrock from Taoiseach Bertie Ahern during a ceremony celebrating St. Patrick's Day in 2005. In November 2004, Ahern celebrated ten years as leader of Fianna F√°il. In April 2006, he became the second longest serving Taoiseach, after √âamon de Valera. One of Ahern's achievements in 2004, was his Presidency of the European Council, during which EU leaders agreed a European Constitution, there was recovery in EU-US relations, the EU formally admitted 10 new members, and selected Jos√© Manuel Barroso as President of the European Commission. Briefly, it appeared as if Ahern himself might become President of the European Commission, however, he declined in favour of domestic politics. The treaty was subsequently defeated in referendums in the Netherlands and France. Ahern's government spent ‚Ç¨52 million on the Nedap Electronic Voting system. This was challenged as being insecure and could have been tampered with to change results.It was later withdrawn and a Commission on Electronic Voting was appointed to examine its design and implementation and operation. This commission in July 2006, said that it could not approve the proposed vote counting software. His coalition partners in government, the Progressive Democrats, said that he had questions to answer as details of an ¬£8,000 (‚Ç¨11,800) payment for speaking engagements, in Manchester in 1994, emerged. The continued appearance of details of his appearances in Manchester and the names of those who were present at functions threatened to destabilise his coalition government, especially so when it transpired that one of the businessmen Miche√°l Wall subsequently sold a house to Ahern. The strains in the coalition eased after Ahern apologised for a second time in the D√°il and agreed to tighten up on ethics legislation. The Moriarty Tribunal reporting in December 2006, criticised Ahern for having signed blank cheques for the then party leader Charles Haughey, who misappropriated taxpayers' funds for personal use. The disbursement of funds to Fianna F√°il and their investigation by the tribunal have raised questions of the involvement of Ahern in the administration of these funds. In May 2007, he became the first Irish leader to address a joint session of the UK Parliament. 2007 general election Ahern hoped to win a third general election in 2007. While opinion polls, in April 2007, suggested that this was improbable.FF/PDs to fall short by 10 seats, FG gains ‚Äì Sunday Independent, 22 April 2007. Polls in April 2007, showed his coalition of Fianna F√°il and the Progressive Democrats at 35% and 3% respectively against the Fine Gael‚ÄìLabour Party alternative government figure of 38%. A further poll published 27 April 2007, shows Fianna F√°il and Progressive Democrats at 34% and 3% respectively compared to Fine Gael and Labour at 31% and 10%. A promise by the Labour Party, at their February 2007 party conference of a cut in the basic rate of income tax, paid by 80% of workers, from 20% to 18% created some excitement in political and media circles. Income tax cuts by the Fianna F√°il‚ÄìProgressive Democrats government had concentrated on the top rate of tax and Labour were able to portray their proposal as progressive to the discomfiture of Fianna F√°il. Ahern received staunch support during the campaign from Eoghan Harris, writing in the Sunday Independent. Harris declared that the anti-Ahern campaign was the most sinister manipulation of the Irish media that he had seen in his lifetime, and that Sinn F√©in would be the main beneficiaries of a fall in support for Ahern and Fianna F√°il.Knocking Bertie brings Provos closer to power ‚Äì Sunday Independent, 6 May 2007. Harris was nominated to Seanad √âireann as a Senator on 3 August 2007 by Ahern. Ahern dissolved the D√°il in April 2007 and called an election for 24 May 2007. Unusually, Ahern dissolved the D√°il on a Sunday morning, claiming that President McAleese's foreign trip that week made it necessary despite the trip having been long-planned. There was speculation that the timing was instead motivated by the commencement of the Mahon Tribunal's Quarryvale module scheduled for that week, particularly Tom Gilmartin's evidence - the hearing thus had to be postponed until after the election was over. Ahern's party received 78 seats a loss of three seats from the 2002 election result. This was regarded as a Fianna F√°il 'victory', as questions about Ahern's finances overshadowed the early part of the election campaign, which threatened to cause huge losses for Ahern's party. His partners in the government, the Progressive Democrats suffered a reduction in representation from 8 to 2 seats including the loss of their leader. Taoiseach (2007‚Äì2008) Ahern at the World Economic Forum in Davos, January 2004. Following the general election of 2007 Ahern was elected to a third term as Taoiseach, leading a rainbow coalition of Fianna F√°il, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats, and also supported by several Independent TDs. This was the first Rainbow coalition comprising Fianna F√°il, with all their previous coalitions comprising just one partner. Requiring 83 seats to return the government, Ahern's options were to attempt to govern with the Progressive Democrats plus two \\"gene-pool\\"Fianna F√°il expelled members or consistent nominally Independent members, who had supported Fianna F√°il continuously in the past. Independents (Jackie Healy-Rae and Beverley Flynn; both former Fianna F√°il members) and one or more of the other three Independents, Michael Lowry, Finian McGrath or Tony Gregory (both left wing Independents). The other options were an alliance with the Green Party or the Labour Party. In the event, Fianna F√°il negotiated a programme for government with the Green Party, and formed a new rainbow coalition with the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats, supported by Healy-Rae, Flynn, Lowry and McGrath. Ahern's reputation was damaged by the accusation of cash gifts received that have transmuted to loans from businessmen. His reputation as the Teflon Taoiseach (no allegation of unethical behaviour had stuck to him until September 2006) was damaged. He was criticised in the foreign press as well as in the Irish media. 'Implausible' evidence takes toll on the Teflon Taoiseach ‚Äì London Independent, 26 September 2007 To the surprise of many observers, polls taken during and after the payments' crisis indicated a sharp rise in support for the Ahern government and a corresponding fall in support for the Opposition parties. While 55‚Äì64% of the public believed that he was wrong to accept the payments, support for his party rose to 39‚Äì42%, while support for the main Opposition parties Fine Gael and the Labour Party fell to 20‚Äì26% and 10‚Äì11%. Two-thirds believed he should not have resigned.

The Irish Times commented they were a \\"poor reflection of ourselves\\". Ahern stated in an interview in the Village on 22 May 2007, that he intended to retire from politics when he turned 60 years of age. He stated this would mean standing down as Taoiseach before the end of the D√°il term, which would have ended in 2012 at the latest.Village Interview with Bertie Ahern ‚Äì Village, 22 May 2007. On 4 July 2007, Ahern stated at a conference in Donegal, that he did not understand why people sitting on the sidelines, \\"cribbing and moaning\\" about the economy, did not commit suicide.Ahern sorry over suicide remarks ‚Äì BBC News website article, 4 July 2007.Ahern apologises for suicide remark RT√â News website article, 4 July 2007. These comments came at a time when Ireland's economy was beginning to falter, and with property prices falling by up to 10% as part of the Irish property bubble. Ahern later accepted responsibility for the overheating of the property sector but took no responsibility for the failings of the Central Bank of Ireland. In an opinion poll taken in September 2007, subsequent to Ahern's initial two-day appearance at the Mahon Tribunal, fewer than one-third of voters believed Ahern's accounts of his finances. Opposition parties had previously been muted in their reaction but in September 2007, Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore, called for Ahern to resign in light of his appearance at the Mahon Tribunal and on 23 September 2007, Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny was heavily critical of the \\"rambling, incoherent\\" answers offered by Ahern to the Mahon tribunal in September 2007. Kenny said there was now a situation whereby a witness before a tribunal, testifying under oath, \\"is continually changing his story\\". It \\"create[s] a credibility problem and that's the issue the Taoiseach has got to deal with\\". On resumption of the D√°il on 26 September a motion of no confidence in Ahern's government was moved by Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny and seconded by the Labour Party, based on Ahern's statements to the Mahon Tribunal. The Green Party, PDs and Independent TDs who supported the government voted for Ahern in the motion of no confidence. In a stormy three-hour D√°il debate, Ahern was accused of telling \\"lies\\" and was called upon to resign. The no-confidence motion was defeated by 81 votes to 76, with all six Green Party TDs, two PDs and four Independents, Finian McGrath, Beverly Flynn, Michael Lowry and Jackie Healy-Rae voting with the Government. In an opinion poll published in November 2007, some three- quarters of voters indicated that they did not believe that Ahern had given a full disclosure about his personal finances to the Mahon Tribunal. The opinion poll also showed more than half of the electorate believing that the whole episode was by then a serious political issue for Ahern. A later opinion poll taken on 22 January 2008, on the issue of Mr Ahern's personal finances and tax liabilities, found that \\"78% of people do not believe he has given the full picture (up 6%) while just 14% believe he has given the full picture (down 3%).\\" The Minister for the Environment and leader of the Green Party, John Gormley said on 22 February 2008, that revelations concerning the Taoiseach at the Mahon Tribunal were distracting from the work of government. Opposition parties on 22 February 2008, branded the Taoiseach's financial affairs as a \\"national embarrassment\\", which should prompt his immediate resignation. Grainne Carruth's acceptance as a matter of civil probability that she had lodged sterling sums to Ahern's account at the Drumcondra branch of the Irish Permanent Building Society in the 1990s had reportedly sent shock waves through the ranks of Fianna F√°il. On 27 March 2008, the unease at Ahern's declarations at the Mahon Tribunal, as contradicted by his former secretary at the tribunal, were highlighted when Progressive Democrat coalition partner leader Mary Harney, traditionally a stern supporter of her former colleague, called on Ahern to make a statement. The disquiet within the coalition was further emphasised when Green Party leader John Gormley, said that Ahern should clarify the contradiction between his evidence and that of his former secretary Grainne Carruth. An opinion poll published on 25 November 2007, showed that support for Fianna F√°il had dropped by seven percent, \\"following the announcement of large pay increases for the government and senior public servants against a backdrop of continuing economic uncertainty and high- profile failures in the health service.\\" On 2 April 2008, Ahern announced his intention to resign as Taoiseach and as leader of Fianna F√°il on 6 May 2008. On 30 April 2008, in Washington D.C., Ahern became the sixth Irish leader to address the United States Congress.The six Irish political leaders who have addressed joint sessions of the U.S. Congress are Se√°n T. O'Kelly (18 March 1959), √âamon de Valera (28 May 1964), Liam Cosgrave (17 March 1976), Garret FitzGerald (15 March 1984), John Bruton (11 September 1996), and Bertie Ahern (30 April 2008). He is also the sixth person who has addressed both the UK Parliament and the United States Congress. On 6 May 2008, he performed his last official duty as Taoiseach in opening the Battle of the Boyne visitors centre with then First Minister of Northern Ireland Ian Paisley. Controversies In a November 2009, interview with VIP magazine, Ahern spoke of how critics who blame the government for the economic crisis should \\"dig the garden or grow bluebells or do something useful\\". He continued, saying that the Irish property bubble was not the fault of his government and that \\"cynics and knockers, people who always see the glass as half empty. I can't understand people who are always bitching, saying 'It's the Government's fault, it's the doctor's fault, it's the cat's fault.' It's everybody's fault except their own.\\" He said in 2009, that since he resigned as Taoiseach the previous year, \\"life is not as controlled as it was. I'm busy doing different things, some quite important, but it's just not the same. If I want to go to a match, I go to a match; if I want to see some friends tomorrow night, I can do that, so it's a big change.\\" Commenting on the economic difficulties facing his successor, he said: \\"Brian has had it rough because of the huge international slowdown. The big trick for him is how we can get out of it quickly.\\" In January 2010, Ahern has said he would have no difficulties giving evidence to the investigation into banking, nor having his testimony heard in public. Saying he would appear if asked, Ahern defended his record while in government, attributing the crisis in banking to international factors and the banks' over-exposure to borrowing on international markets. \\"By and large we all know what happened. The banks borrowed money on the open market in the short-term. And as soon as things went, they had to pay that money up but they hadn't got it to pay,\\" he said. \\"That's what happened. I don't think it will take too long [for an inquiry] to write up what the position is.\\" He continued, saying, \\"The greater issue was the protection and the regulation of the bank rather than consumers' interests.\\" Mr Ahern also said that people were \\"jumping over developers\\" but also \\"needed to remember\\" they employed 200,000 people. He said that one of the first things that Brian Cowen had done when he became Minister for Finance was to abolish many of the property tax incentives. He also presided over many of the incentives that benefited property developers. \\"When they were brought in, the place was in a disastrous way. Look at the quays in Dublin. There were reports around for 40 years that said the quays needed something done about them and nothing happened until we brought in the urban renewal status and gave the tax incentives.\\" Explanation for not reacting to property bubble In May 2010, Ahern said of the property-based tax incentives which aggravated the Irish economic collapse that \\"We probably should have closed those down a good bit earlier but there were always fierce pressures, there was endless pressures to keep them. There was endless pressures to extend them.\\" He stated that the pressure to retain such incentives had come from developers, owners of sites, areas that did not have the developments, community councils, politicians and civic society. Ahern said that his decision in 2001, to create a new financial regulator was one of the main reasons for the collapse of the Irish banking sector, saying that \\"if I had a chance again I wouldn't do it.\\" \\"The banks were irresponsible,\\" he admitted. \\"But the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator seemed happy. They were never into us saying ‚Äì ever ‚Äì 'Listen, we must put legislation and control on the banks.' That never happened.\\" Payments Ahern was investigated by the Mahon Tribunal, following an allegation by Tom Gilmartin, that Ahern had been paid money by Owen O'Callaghan in return for favours. The Tribunal found that Ahern's explanations for lodgements to his various accounts could not be true, and thus Gilmartin's allegation could not be disproved. One lodgement of IR¬£30,000, in 1994, took place in the weeks following the circumstances Gilmartin described, with contemporaneous AIB notes confirming Gilmartin's account of Ahern assuring Owen O'Callaghan that a rival development at Blanchardstown would not get tax designation, and on the same day as a meeting with Owen O'Callaghan's bag-man, Frank Dunlop. The Tribunal were, however, unable to conclusively prove that the lodgement was not merely coincidental. The Tribunal also discovered that Ahern, when Taoiseach, had visited Dunlop in the weeks immediately subsequent to Dunlop's admission of corrupt payments on behalf of Owen O'Callaghan, prior to Dunlop resuming the witness stand to elaborate further on his activities. =Admission of undeclared payments= Ahern was criticised by the Moriarty Tribunal for signing blank cheques for the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey, without asking what those cheques were for. Ahern told the tribunal that a policy of signing blank cheques was used on the Fianna F√°il party leader's account for reasons of \\"administrative convenience\\".Ahern rapped over blank cheques ‚Äì Sunday Independent newspaper article, 20 August 2006. In September 2006 The Irish Times printed claims allegedly leakedThe Irish Times said its sources are independent of the tribunal. from The Mahon Tribunal that Ahern had received money from a millionaire businessman while Minister for Finance in 1993. The editor of The Irish Times defended the publication as being in the public interest at a hearing of the tribunal, saying that it was not a party to the Supreme Court case which restrained the Sunday Business Post from publishing leaked documents. This order was directed against the Sunday Business Post but its interim order purported to restrain all media outlets from publishing confidential material from the inquiry. Ahern has admitted that he did receive money but said on being interviewed that: > What I got personally in my life, to be frank with you is none of your > business. If I got something from somebody as a present or something like > that I can use it. What Ahern said in 1996, while in opposition: > The public are entitled to have an absolute guarantee of the financial > probity and integrity of their elected representatives, their officials and > above all of Ministers. They need to know that they are under financial > obligations to nobody. (D√°il √âireann transcript, December 1996) This contradiction has been criticised in editorials in both the Irish Independent and The Irish Times Six days after the payments were publicised, Ahern admitted in a television interview that he had received two payments totalling IR¬£39,000 (‚Ç¨50,000) in 1993 and 1994. Ahern regarded the money as a loan, but he conceded that no repayments had at that time (September 2006) been made and no interest has been paid. He said that he had attempted to repay it, but that his friends would not accept repayment. He claimed that he had \\"broken no codes ‚Äì ethical, tax, legal or otherwise\\". On 28 November 2007, former NCB managing director Padraic O'Connor at the Mahon Tribunal, \\"directly contradicted Mr Ahern's claims that long-standing friends gave him a loan just after Christmas 1993.\\"Top broker says Ahern not telling the truth on 'dig-out' ‚Äì Irish Independent, 29 November 2007. In the same interview, he also claimed that he received a payment of ¬£8,000 from a group of 25 businessmen in Manchester on one occasion. He stated that this money was again unsolicited, that it was a gift and therefore not subject to tax as it had been received when abroad, and that it was paid to him after he gave an after-dinner speech at an ad hoc function. He claimed that the money was given to him as a private citizen, not to him in his then role as Minister for Finance, and that no other payments were received by him after speaking at other similar functions. The Irish Times reported on 30 September 2006, that part of this payment was actually a cheque drawn on NCB Stockbrokers, a large Irish company. In its final report, the Mahon tribunal found that, contrary to his sworn evidence, no 'dig-outs' in 1993 and 1994 were arranged to give money to Mr Ahern and that large dollar and sterling cash lodgements were made to his bank accounts in the mid-1990s. A number of his benefactors have received appointments as directors of State boards.Connolly Frank, Gilmartin, Page 196, Gill & Macmillan, Dublin 12, 2014, Insisting that no favours had been offered or received, Ahern said: > I might have appointed somebody but I appointed them because they were > friends, not because of anything they had given me. Under the Standards in Public Office Commission's rules, > State appointments should be made on the basis of merit, taking into account > the skills, qualifications and experience of the person to be appointed. Members of D√°il √âireann must conduct themselves > in accordance with the provisions and spirit of the Code of Conduct and > ensure that their conduct does not bring the integrity of their office or > the D√°il into serious disrepute. In the face of negative publicity, Ahern has repaid the monies advanced to him, with 5% interest, totalling ‚Ç¨90,000. On 3 October 2006, Ahern made a 15-minute statement in D√°il √âireann defending his actions in taking loans totalling IR¬£39,000 (‚Ç¨50,000) from friends in Ireland and ¬£8,000 (‚Ç¨11,800) as a gift from businessmen in Manchester in 1993 and 1994. In his statement he apologised for the distress his actions had brought saying: > The bewilderment caused to the public about recent revelations has been > deeply upsetting for me and others near and dear to me. To them, to the > Irish people and to this house, I offer my apologies. =Confirmation of sterling cash lodgements= On 20 March 2008, at the Mahon Tribunal the disclosure, of lodgements of ¬£15,500 sterling into building society accounts of Ahern and his daughters was accepted as a matter of probability by Ahern's former secretary Grainne Carruth. Previously in her evidence, Carruth, on 19 March 2008 had said, that she had not lodged sterling for Ahern, while she accepted (as a matter of probability), a day later, that she must have lodged sterling on Ahern's behalf based on the paperwork available although her recollection is that she never had sighting of sterling at any time. Ahern had told the tribunal during his evidence in February 2008, that the lodgements to his and his daughters' accounts had come from his salary as a politician. =\\"No bank account\\"= Further questions were raised about IR¬£50,000 (‚Ç¨63,300) which he had lodged to his bank account in 1994. He claimed this was money he had saved over a substantial period of time (1987‚Äì1994) when he had had no active bank account. During this period he was Minister for Labour and subsequently Minister for Finance. He was asked by Labour leader Pat Rabbitte whether, in the absence of a bank account, he had kept the money in a \\"sock in the hot-press\\" and Socialist Party leader Joe Higgins asked if he had kept the money \\"in a shoe-box\\". Ahern replied that he had kept the money \\"in his own possession\\". =Payment in relation to house= On 5 October 2006, further information emerged in the D√°il that Ahern had bought his house in Dublin, from Manchester-based Irish businessman, Miche√°l Wall, who was at an event in Manchester in 1994, where the Taoiseach received a payment of GBP¬£8,000 (‚Ç¨11,800). This caused further tensions within the government coalition parties. On 10 October 2006, the Taoiseach again told the D√°il that it was an \\"error of judgement\\" for him to have accepted loans and gifts for personal purposes in the early 1990s. Ahern expanded on his apology to the D√°il of the previous week, which he described as unqualified. Ahern said there would now be a change in the ethics law requiring office holders offered a gift from friends to consult the Standards in Public Office Commission and to accept their ruling. =Money from developer= Allegations had been made that he had taken IR¬£50,000 (‚Ç¨63,300) from a property developer, Owen O'Callaghan, in return for favours at this time. Ahern won a libel action against a Cork businessman, Denis \\"Starry\\" O'Brien, defending himself against this allegation. However, broadcaster Eamon Dunphy, has testified in the Mahon Tribunal that he was told by developer Owen O'Callaghan, that Ahern was \\"taken care of\\" to support a shopping centre development in the 1990s. This followed the initial allegations, denied by Ahern and O'Callaghan, by retired developer Tom Gilmartin, that O'Callaghan told him that he had given Ahern a payment of ¬£50,000 in 1989, and a payment of ¬£30,000 in 1993, in connection with a development of lands at Quarryvale, west Dublin. Gilmartin further alleged being told that O'Callaghan had paid Ahern in excess of ¬£20,000 in relation to tax designation of a site in which O'Callaghan had an interest in Athlone, the designation having been Ahern's last act as Finance Minister, before the Fianna F√°il-led Government fell in December 1994. Ahern was responsible for placing disgraced former Dublin West TD Liam Lawlor, as head of the D√°il Ethics Committee, despite having been told by Tom Gilmartin many years beforehand that Lawlor had corruptly demanded money and had thwarted Gilmartin's plans when Gilmartin refused to comply. In March 2007, one of Ahern's Manchester benefactors, Paddy \\"The Plasterer\\" Reilly, was appointed as the Fianna F√°il director of elections, for Ahern's Dublin Central constituency. In April 2007, it was allegedAhern denies air trip with a case of cash ‚Äì Sunday Independent newspaper article, 15 April 2007, Free registration required in a statement by his former official driver, that Ahern in 1994, while Minister for Finance, took a briefcase full of cash to Manchester. This has been denied by Ahern. While the payment details initially seemed to damage Ahern's standing, the result of the 2007 general election, indicated that the damage was minor. In April 2007, an opinion poll found that nearly half of voters believed Ahern still had questions to answer over the payments controversy.Payments to Ahern: the questions remain ‚Äì Irish Independent newspaper article, 23 April 2007, Free registration required =Money given to Celia Larkin= On 2 February 2008, it emerged at the Mahon Tribunal that a house was bought by Ahern's former partner Celia Larkin in 1993, with money donated to Ahern's constituency organisation in Drumcondra. There was no documentation to back up this loan to Larkin or to prove around IR¬£30,000 in other expenditure from this account. Dublin businessman Tim Collins, has denied that Ahern was joint holder of the so- called BT account from which Larkin was loaned IR¬£30,000 without documentation to describe the loan agreement. Tim Collins denied that the BT account referred to Bertie and Tim, even though he operated a joint account with Des Richardson known as the DT account. =Appearance at the Mahon Tribunal= On 13 September 2007, Ahern commenced four days of testimony under oath at the Mahon Tribunal. On 13 September, Ahern admitted that he had not cooperated with the Mahon planning tribunal.Planning Tribunal transcript, page 107 , 13 September 2007Ahern accepts he failed to give complete information ‚Äì The Irish Times, 14 September 2007. On 14 September 2007, inconsistencies in Ahern's statements to the Tribunal emerged, after he changed his story on the infamous IR¬£25,000 dig-outs.Cracks begin to show in Ahern‚Äôs testimony ‚Äì Irish Independent, 15 September 2007. On 21 September 2007, Ahern again changed his story and said he could not remember key events at the centre of the controversy.Ahern cash trail: judges home in on the 'gaps' ‚Äì Irish Independent, 21 September 2007. Tribunal Chair, Judge Alan Mahon, said there were \\"significant gaps\\" in the money trail provided by Mr Ahern which \\"would have made it impossible for the tribunal to follow the trail\\". Judge Gerald Keyes accused Ahern of having no recollection of buying ¬£30,000 of luxury items in the early 1990s. Judge Mary Faherty, accused Ahern of giving \\"polar opposite\\" accounts of why he withdrew IR¬£50,000 from AIB in January 1995. On 24 September 2007, there were further discrepancies, memory lapses and contradictions to his testimony under oathTaoiseach agrees bank records clash with his version ‚Äì The Irish Times newspaper, 25 September 2007. with Ahern agreeing with the assertions of the tribunal that there are inconsistencies and contradictions in his statements compared to bank records and the testimony of Larkin.Planning Tribunal transcript, page 75 , 24 September 200717 hours in witness box ‚Äì still no answers ‚Äì Irish Independent, 25 September 2007. Journalist Vincent Browne, has asserted that \\"Ahern's numbers game just doesn't add up\\".Ahern‚Äôs numbers game just doesn‚Äôt add up ‚Äì The Sunday Business Post, 16 September 2007. Again on 20 and 21 December 2007, Ahern spent two further days under questioning by the Mahon tribunal about his finances in the 1990s. In January 2008, it was revealed that Ahern was in discussion with the Revenue Commissioners about his liability for tax on the sums received in Manchester and on his tax clearance status as declared in 2002, before details of the Manchester payments were revealed. The then opposition leader Enda Kenny said it was not acceptable to have a Taoiseach who could not declare compliance with the tax codes. On 12 February 2008, it emerged Newstalk106 podcast that the Mahon tribunal did not have all of the information provided to it, contrary to Ahern's assertion in the D√°il that he had provided all information to the tribunal. Ahern has taken a High Court action to prevent the tribunal from questioning him on the information that he released in the D√°il in 2006. The total value of lodgements and other transactions involving Ahern was said to exceed ¬£452,800. The lodgements and transactions occurred between 1988 and 1997, although the vast bulk of the money was lodged in the period to 1995. On 4 June 2008, Ahern admitted that he knew about sterling deposits before his secretary's testimony, but said to laughter at his Tribunal appearance on that day that those deposits were winnings from horse racing. =Tax Clearance Certificate= The Standards in Public Office Commission was asked to investigate the Ahern's declaration of tax compliance after the 2002 general election. In mid-January 2008, it emerged in the press, reportedly as leaks from parties to the Mahon tribunal, that Ahern would not be in a position to present a Tax Clearance Certificate to the D√°il, as required under ethics legislation. This certificate is issued by the Revenue Commissioners to persons who have shown themselves to be tax compliant. To meet legal requirements, this certificate should have been presented to a D√°il committee by 31 January 2008, by all those elected to the D√°il. A caveat allowed that in the absence of this, a certificate stating that the D√°il member was in negotiation with the Revenue Commissioners would suffice. An inability to declare tax compliance by a prominent individual such as Ahern would prove highly embarrassing, and could potentially have had more serious repercussions. The Standards in Public Office Act (2001) determines the tax clearance requirements for persons elected to the Oireachtas, and others. The making of a false declaration would also be an offence.Statement to D√°il √âireann on Code of Conduct for Members ‚Äì Department of Finance ‚Äì Government of Ireland Ahern's inability to furnish a tax clearance certificate led to further calls for his resignation. He was, at the time, the only member of the Oireachtas not to have a tax clearance certificate On 14 January 2008, while on a visit to South Africa, Ahern accused Enda Kenny, Leader of the Opposition of telling a \\"bare-faced lie\\" about Ahern's tax situation. Ahern and Fianna F√°il's response has not addressed the issue, but has attacked the leaking of Ahern's tax affairs so as to attempt to enable the non-compliance issue to be ignored. Ahern admitted to the Mahon Tribunal on 21 February 2008, for the first time, that he did not pay tax on substantial payments that he received when Minister for Finance in the 1990s. =Mahon Tribunal Final Report= On 4 July 2011, it was reported in the Irish Daily Mail that the Mahon Tribunal report was \\"virtually complete\\" with a volume dedicated solely to Ahern. The article further stated that it would leave Ahern's reputation \\"in tatters\\". The Mahon Tribunal reportTribunal Final Report was made public on 22 March 2012. It found that \\"much of the explanations provided by Ahern, as to the source of the substantial funds available to him, were deemed by the Tribunal to be 'untrue'\\". While the report did not accuse Ahern of corruption, it stated that it totally rejected his evidence and that of related witnesses about the sources of monies in his own and related bank accounts, and that Ahern failed to truthfully account for a total of IR¬£165,214.25 passing through accounts connected with him. In 1993, the then Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and Ahern, who was then Minister for Finance, wrote to developer Owen O'Callaghan seeking a substantial donation. At the time O'Callaghan was heavily involved in lobbying for state support for a stadium project at Neilstown, County Dublin. According to the report, O'Callaghan felt compelled to donate a sum of IR¬£80,000 to Fianna F√°il to get funding for the stadium. The Mahon Tribunal said it did not find the payment to be corrupt. However, the report said pressurising a businessman to donate money when he was seeking support for a commercial project was \\"entirely inappropriate, and was an abuse of political power and government authority\\". Pay-rises On 25 October 2007, Ahern was criticised after the government accepted a recommendation from the Review Body on Higher Remuneration that senior civil servants and ministers receive pay increases. The pay-rise for his position (up ‚Ç¨38,000 to ‚Ç¨310,000 per annum), would have made it higher paying than that of the US President and made him the highest paid Head of government in the European Union. Criticism from opposition parties concentrated on the timing of the announcement (following highly publicised budgetary concerns at the Health Service Executive) and the fact that Ahern's increase alone would amount to about four times the basic social welfare payment. On 12 December 2007, it was announced that the first part of the pay-rises would be deferred by a year, with the remainder paid in 2009 and 2010. Attempt to take credit for the Gregory deal Independent TD Maureen O'Sullivan, accused Ahern of attempting in his autobiography to take credit for the Gregory deal by claiming he was present in negotiations between Charles Haughey and Tony Gregory and that he had provided Haughey with estimates from Dublin City Council. The Gregory deal was an agreement negotiated between the Independent Socialist TD Tony Gregory and Fianna F√°il leader Charles Haughey in the aftermath of the February 1982 general election, which resulted in a hung D√°il. In return for supporting Haughey, Gregory was promised a deal worth 100 million pounds at the time, which was to be used to redevelop North Inner City Dublin and to provide a greater number of houses and employment in an area which was considered Ireland's poorest and most disadvantaged. Ahern had gone with Haughey to the negotiations with Gregory; he was immediately asked to leave by Gregory and was forced to wait publicly in his car outside for three and a half hours. Although both had been elected to the same constituency, they were fierce rivals and the relationship between them was often sour. O'Sullivan was Tony Gregory's director of elections and successor as a TD. Public image Ahern's presentational style has been described as Bertiespeak. > \\"It is not correct, and if I said so, I was not correct ‚Äì I cannot recall if > I said it, but I did not say, or if I did, I did not mean to say it ‚Äì that > these issues could not be dealt with until the end of the Mahon Tribunal.\\" In 2004, Joe Higgins described Ahern's response to questions as \\"like playing handball against a hay stack. You hear a dull thud but the ball never comes back to you.\\" Ahern features as one of the main characters portrayed in spoof radio comic strips Gift Grub and Nob Nation. The fortnightly magazine The Phoenix featured \\"De Diary of a Nortsoide Taoiseach\\", a satirical column written from Ahern's point of view in a phonetic transliteration of his broad north Dublin accent.The Phoenix , 8 September 2006 and passim. (subscription required) His idiosyncratic delivery made Ahern a doyen of satirists and impersonators, from Dermot Morgan (in the 90's) to Mario Rosenstock (RT√â 2 TV, 2012). Ahern was satirised in a spoof publication Bertie's little book of ethics. In October 2010, he and some other News of the World columnists appeared in a TV advertisement for the newspaper where they were seen sitting inside kitchen fittings. In his section of the advertisement he was seen sitting inside a kitchen cupboard, with tea and gingernut biscuits. Opposition parties described the skit as \\"terrible\\" for the country. Miriam Lord of The Irish Times described him in this incarnation as \\"looking and sounding like Drumcondra's answer to Rodney Dangerfield\\", while Lise Hand of the Irish Independent commented that he was \\"surrounded by vegetables, ginger nuts and the disintegrated remnants of the dignity of his former office\\". When asked for an explanation by the Sunday World, Ahern replied that it was \\"just a bit of craic\\" and that \\"you [journalists] get paid more [than columnists]\\". In September 2011, Ahern said he believed that he would have \\"done all right\\" in the presidential election but for the decline in the popularity of Fianna F√°il. Ahern confirmed he considered running in the election. \\"I still would have done all right. I mean they have done some figures and I would probably sit in around 30 per cent, which you haven‚Äôt a hope with as the party is on 20 per cent.\\" He added that \\"the party popularity is the thing that snookers it, because if your party isn't winnable...\\" Ahern said: \\"If there was no downturn and if it wasn't all the hassle of the tribunals and everything else, then you could have had a good run at it.\\" He predicted that \\"nobody is going to win it outright ‚Äì like Mary McAleese had it won on the first count\\". Asked about a possible future candidacy in the following presidential election, he said: \\"Normally what happens in this country, if a president does a good job they stay on, so that's 14 years, so that ends any chance that I'll have.\\" He also rejected suggestions that the Mahon tribunal would reject the evidence he gave on his personal finances. \\"The only thing that is important to me is the central allegations. And what the tribunal says about the other trash is irrelevant.\\" Miche√°l Martin said the former taoiseach was \\"out of touch with reality\\" if he believed he could have won the presidency for Fianna F√°il. Martin also said expenses paid to Ahern in his capacity as a former Taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Ahern had claimed ‚Ç¨265,000 for \\"secretarial services\\" and ‚Ç¨7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008. Under the current expenses regime, a former Taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for up to five years after leaving office and one indefinitely after that. In September 2011, Ahern was criticised by his party, Fianna F√°il, with a senior party figure saying \\"Every public utterance he makes digs it deeper every time. From the day he left the Dail, it's been one thing after another. The party members are very pissed off. It's coming up right across the country.\\" A biography of Ahern was published in 2011, Bertie: Power & Money, by Colm Keena,Bertie: Power & Money, by Colm Keena, Gill & Macmillan, Retirement from politics On 30 December 2010, in a speech to his party cumann in the Dublin Central constituency, he announced that he would not be contesting the 2011 general election. Ahern said he had made it clear as far back as 2002, that it was always his plan to step down as a TD before he was 60. Asked if he had any regrets, he said: \\"If I had seen the banking crisis coming. Nobody advised me, no economist, all those people now writing books saying 'I told you so' ‚Äì none of them.\\" On Anglo Irish Bank, he said: \\"I can honestly say that not once did anyone or any delegation that came in to see me ever say, 'Watch out for Anglo' ... I wish they had have.\\" Referring to the \\"great economic storm\\" currently under way in Ireland, he warned against excessive pessimism: \\"Some gains have been lost, but in truth many remain. I dearly wish there was no crisis. I realise that it would have been better if some things had been done differently, but I will not denigrate the good that has been done.\\" However an independent review of the operation of the Department of Finance during Ahern's tenure in government and its performance over the course of a decade, by Canadian expert Rob Wright, revealed how repeated warnings to the government of the dangers of the budgetary policies pursued during the boom years were repeatedly ignored. Ahern declined to comment on the report. Shortly after announcing his retirement from politics, Ahern attacked his successor Brian Cowen, over Cowen's failure to communicate with the public and criticised the government's handling of the EU/IMF bailout. This attack broke the convention that former Taoisigh should not publicly criticise their successors. Ahern said in January 2011, there was no hope of Fianna F√°il retaining two seats in his Dublin Central constituency. None of his party candidates were subsequently elected in his former constituency. He receives annual pension payments of ‚Ç¨152,331. Ahern said in April 2018 that he is considering running for President in 2025 as an independent candidate. In April 2018, he walked out of an interview with DW News after being questioned on the findings of the Mahon Tribunal. In October 2018, Ahern was appointed to chair the Bougainville Referendum Commission, which is responsible for preparing an independence referendum in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, which took place in December 2019. Legacy Historian John A. Murphy said: > \\"Did Ahern, in his 11 years of power, make the most of this unprecedented > prosperity for the public benefit? The answer can hardly be positive, given > the present state of health, education and infrastructure, generally.\\" Historian Diarmaid Ferriter said: > \\"There'll be broad consensus around what Bertie did in Northern Ireland, the > social partnership and the unity he brought to his own party.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary noted in a radio interview that > \\"Bertie squandered the wealth of a generation and I think in time it will be > proven he was a useless wastrel.\\" In November 2009, Ahern was again > criticised by O'Leary, being described as a \\"feckless ditherer\\". A documentary series ‚Äì Bertie ‚Äì on RT√â television in November 2008 examined the life and career of Ahern. Colm Keena in a biography of Ahern described how \\"his desire for power and an almost complete absence of political conviction, left him open to the influence of those with strong opinions, whose interests precipitated his mismanagement of the Irish economy.\\" Ahern is also the subject of a Rubberbandits single released in August 2020. Post-political activities Bertie Ahern, 2011 While still a TD but having resigned as Taoiseach, Ahern was appointed to an international advisory group on conflict resolution on 14 July 2008. In addition Ahern serves as a board member of the peace and reconciliation charity Co-operation Ireland. Ahern was appointed to an advisory board of an Irish company Parker Green International. He was appointed Chairman of the International Forestry Fund on 1 January 2010. He wrote a sports column in the now-closed Rupert Murdoch-owned Sunday newspaper News of the World. In 2009, he earned around ‚Ç¨467,200, from his speaking arrangements alone. He is registered with the Washington Speakers Bureau which charged $40,000 (‚Ç¨29,200) per speech‚Äîand he gave 16 speeches in 2009. He also enjoyed in that period, a ‚Ç¨92,672 TD's salary and expenses. Between his resignation in 2008 and May 2010, he ran up a ‚Ç¨5,682 bill for VIP airport facilities and a mobile phone bill of ‚Ç¨8,331. This amount claimed by Ahern, was the largest of any former Taoiseach. In February 2012, he reversed his decision to give part of his pension back to the State. Since resigning as Taoiseach in 2008, Ahern has been a regular visitor to China. In November 2014, he gave a lecture on cyberspace security at the three-day World Internet Conference in Wuzhen. His handshake with Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang while there got pictured on the front page of the South China Morning Post above a story about \\"internet big hitters\\". In February 2015, Ahern received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland. In a December 2015 interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ahern said low pay workers had brought country to its knees because they got \\"cocky\\" and insisted on \\"second, third and even fourth homes\\". The former Taoiseach said that the availability of cheap credit through Ireland's involvement in the eurozone created \\"a huge problem\\". \\"Anyone could walk into any institution and seem to get any amount of money and this is where the cocky bit came in. ‚ÄúUnfortunately‚Ä¶ Joe Soap and Mary Soap, who never had a lot, got the loans for the second house and leveraged the third house off the second house and the fourth on the third, and you know, what are you having yourself.\\" This drew criticism on radio and on social media for being exaggerated and for blaming the financial crisis on low-income families. In December 2019 Ahern acted as Chairman of the referendum commission for the Autonomous Region of Bougainville in a non-binding vote with regards to independence from Papua New Guinea. Personal life=Family By 1972, Ahern had met his future wife, Miriam Kelly, a bank official who lived near the Aherns family home. They married in St. Columba's Church, Iona Road in 1975.Bertie Ahern:The Autobiography, by Bertie Ahern, with Richard Aldous, Arrow Books, . Ahern has two daughters from his marriage: Georgina and Cecelia. Georgina is the wife of Westlife member Nicky Byrne. Cecelia is a best-selling author. Ahern and his wife separated in 1992. Until 2003, Ahern maintained a relationship with Celia Larkin. Ahern was the first, and is the only, Taoiseach to have a legal separation from his wife.Ahern had a relationship with Cecilia Larkin for several years. A previous Fianna F√°il Taoiseach Charles Haughey had a mistress, Terry Keane ‚Äì A very public affair. Larkin was appointed to the board of the National Consumer Agency in July 2005, on the recommendation of the Department of the Taoiseach. Ahern is an enthusiastic and vocal fan of sport. He is a supporter of Dublin GAA and attends inter-county matches in Croke Park. He also supports English soccer outfit Manchester United Football Club and attends matches at Old Trafford, as well as Scottish soccer outfit Celtic Football Club and rugby matches at the Aviva Stadium. He appeared as a pundit on RT√â Two's The Premiership programme in 2001. Religious faith Ahern is a practising Roman Catholic. He attends Mass every Saturday evening in St Mary's Pro-Cathedral in Dublin. However, he was publicly criticised by Cardinal Desmond Connell, then Archbishop of Dublin, for his public relationship with Larkin. Ahern has said that he lives by the Ten Commandments, the Beatitudes and his own conscience, and hopes to get to heaven when he dies. Speaking to Gay Byrne in RT√â's The Meaning of Life series, Ahern described himself as a regular Mass-goer, but said he had not been to Confession for 40 years. In a lengthy interview, Ahern said that he and the former DUP leader Ian Paisley, bonded over their shared faith when they had their first formal meeting together. The meeting took place in January 2004, at the Irish Embassy in London. He recalled how Paisley began a prayer in the Irish Embassy and he joined in with him. He said the prayer was \\"like our Confiteor\\" and officials had wondered why they had spent so much time alone. The pair started discussing their values and the rules by which they lived. His government came under severe criticism for the deal they made with the religious orders, capping their contribution to the redress board at ‚Ç¨128 million while taxpayers will have to pay out ‚Ç¨1 billion. As a Catholic, Ahern said he wanted the church \\"to do well\\" but that it could not retreat behind canon law. \\"There was one time when the church tried to put up the defence of canon law and my colleagues just looked up to the sky and thought they were joking. Unfortunately, they weren't joking, they made bad decisions.\\" Ahern said he was convinced that life \\"did not end at the graveyard\\" and he often prayed to dead relatives for guidance. He used Mass as an opportunity to pray for people in trouble and stayed off alcohol in November and at Lent. He rationalised inexplicable events, such as the death of a young person, by stating that God \\"cannot influence every single thing\\". He said he received a \\"fair amount of hate mail\\" about \\"living in sin\\", but it upset other people more than it did him and he admitted that he had not lived up to his parents' \\"stereotype\\" of married life.

The primary implication of the reference is one in which things that are essentially the same are seen as different, due to mislabeling or the user's misunderstanding of the underlying operating principles. A secondary reference may be anything being exploited to its utmost limits, or apparently exceeding them. In 2002 the phrase entered the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary with the definition \\"up to maximum volume\\". Original scene from This Is Spinal Tap The phrase was coined in a scene from the 1984 mockumentary/rockumentary This Is Spinal Tap by the character Nigel Tufnel, played by Christopher Guest. In this scene Nigel gives the rockumentary's director, Marty DiBergi, played by Rob Reiner, a tour of his stage equipment. While Nigel is showing Marty his Marshall guitar amplifiers, he points out a selection whose control knobs all have a highest setting of eleven, unlike standard amplifiers whose volume settings are typically numbered from 0 to 10. Believing that this numbering increases the highest volume of the amp, he explains \\"It's one louder, isn't it?\\" When Marty asks why the ten setting is not simply set to be louder, Nigel hesitates before responding blankly again \\"These go to eleven.\\"  Other instances = Prior examples  C&O;'s 500 first went \\"up to 11\\" in 1947. The use of \\"11\\" as a maximum pre-dates This Is Spinal Tap by almost forty years. In 1947, the Baldwin Locomotive Works and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway introduced the Chesapeake and Ohio class M-1 steam turbine locomotive. The locomotive's throttle included eleven settings, ranging from one (idling) to eleven (full speed). The locomotive's cruising speed was , at which point the throttle was on \\"seven\\". During a trial run with a reporter from Popular Mechanics aboard, a C&O; engineer expressed his dissatisfaction with a local speed limit of , noting that he would \\"Sure like to be able to pull it back to eleven!\\" In quality equipment multipole switches are sometimes used for volume controls, usually with 23 detents, wired with a resistor chain. These give 23 positions with the first being silent, so were numbered 0-11 (0-22 is impractical). Potentiometers give a much more finely adjustable volume, but the same numbering was used. This is how Marshall amplifiers came to have controls numbered 0-11. Gibson Les Paul guitars with low-impedance pickups were outfitted with special controls designed by Les Paul himself. Controls included a \\"Decade Switch\\" that went up to 11.  Formula 1 All teams in racing have various modes and settings that they switch to depending on the necessary strategy of the race. From time to time teams will use special phrases or keywords to describe the modes. The Red Bull Racing team in Formula 1 refers its drivers over the radio to \\"Mode 11\\", which is an engine mode that unlocks the full power of the engine, encouraging the driver to challenge the cars ahead.  Cultural examples As a consequence of the film, real bands and musicians started buying equipment whose knobs went up to 11, or even higher, with Eddie Van Halen reputedly being the first to do so. Marshall, the company that provided amplifiers for the film that the custom-marked knobs were applied to, now sells amplifiers such as its JCM900 (first sold in 1990) whose knobs are marked from 0 to 20. The QSC 3500 and 3800 amplifiers made for the professional sound company Sound Image in the 1990s went to 11, as do amps from Soldano and Friedman. Other controls with a maximum of 11 include SSL mixing consoles, Amazon Alexa, the BBC's iPlayer on demand video player, the headphone volume control on the PreSonus AudioBox 1818VSL, the volume control on the Apogee Mini-DAC, the IRIX audio panel (when invoked with the undocumented -spinaltap option), and the Tesla Model S's volume control. The tachometer on a Singer Vehicle Design modified Porsche 911 goes up to 11, representing 11,000 RPM.Top Gear Series 20 Episode 5 On its primary page for This Is Spinal Tap, the IMDb displays the user rating for the film out of 11 stars (e.g. 8.0/11) instead of the standard scale of one to ten. However, only 10 rating stars are actually shown on the page, and user ratings can only be submitted up to 10 stars. Other IMDb pages display the rating out of 10. The influence of the phrase \\"up to eleven\\" is such that it has been used outside of music; in 2016, for example, astronomer Krzysztof Stanek described the brightest-known object in the universe as being \\"as if nature took everything we know about magnetars and turned it up to 11.\\" See also *Loudest band in the world *Loudness war *Red line (phrase), \\"a limit past which safety can no longer be guaranteed\\" References Category:English-language idioms Category:Quotations from film Category:Comedy catchphrases Category:Spinal Tap (band) Category:Words and phrases introduced in 1984 ","title":"Up to eleven"},{"id":"3774816","text":"Twenty Twenty Sound is the debut album by English band Dark Star, released in 1999 via Harvest Records.

The Kalin Twins, who were known affectionately as \\"Hal and Herbie\\", are best known for their 1958 hit \\"When\\". Career The twins were born in Port Jervis, New York, United States, but the family later moved to Washington, D.C. Originally discovered by Clint Ballard, Jr., the writer of many hit records such as \\"Good Timin'\\" for Jimmy Jones, and \\"I'm Alive\\" for The Hollies, the sibling duo had a couple of early recording flops. However, in 1958, after searching through piles of writers' demo tapes, their management discovered the song called \\"When\\", written by Paul Evans and Jack Reardon. It topped the UK Singles Chart on 13 September 1958, got to Number 5 in their U.S. homeland, and sold over two million copies in the process. The track remained in the UK listings for eighteen weeks, five of which were at Number One. They had no further UK chart entries. The Kalins were the first set of twins to reach number one in the UK as a duo, followed years later by The Proclaimers. They were supported by Cliff Richard on their only UK tour. Their second single, \\"Forget Me Not,\\" reached Number 12 in the US Billboard chart later in 1958. After two further low-ranking entries in 1959, they never reached the charts again. Family Herbert Kalin was married and had four children, Suzan Lynn, Kelly Lee, Buddy Ladd, and Jonathan Ray. Post-music career Eventually, disillusioned with diminishing returns, the brothers returned to their day jobs, with each pursuing college degrees. They did not perform again until 1977, when a mutual friend booked them to appear at his new nightclub. Sometimes they performed with their younger sibling, Jack, and thus appeared as the Kalin Brothers. They disappeared again as a performing act, until 1989. Then, their one-time support act, Cliff Richard, invited them to play at his Wembley Stadium 'The Event' concerts, as part of a sequence paying homage to the 1950s television pop show, Oh Boy! Deaths Harold \\"Hal\\" Kalin died on August 24, 2005, as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, aged 71. Herbert \\"Herbie\\" Kalin died July 21, 2006 from a heart attack, aged 72.

Location  The location of Reric was long disputed. Older theories suggested Oldenburg, L√ºbeck,S. Brather Rerik // Johannes Hoops Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde 2nd edition, Walter de Gruyter, 2003, pp.514,515, Mecklenburg Castle, p. 113 and Alt-Gaarz, renamed Rerik in 1938. Since the 1990s, Reric is thought to be identical with an archaeological site near Gro√ü Str√∂mkendorf, located on the eastern shore of the Bay of Wismar. This version is based on results presented by the University of Kiel and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's State Department for Archaeology, who partially excavated about 20 hectares of the site between 1995 and 1999.University of Kiel article  Archaeology  There is a certain amount of circumstantial evidence for Gro√ü Str√∂mkendorf being Reric such as identical foundation and destruction dates. Gro√ü Str√∂mkendorf was a deep water port with a planned layout. Initially north of the present site, the earlier settlement was moved south and the original area turned into a cemetery. The new site contained buildings similar to the sunken floor buildings of West Stow in England. Pottery included, among others, tatting ware and shelly ware. The primary type of pottery found so far was the Sukow type, associated used by the West Slavs during the 8th century. Pottery of the succeeding Feldberg type was also found, though in considerably lower number. Imported pottery from western countries was only scarcely represented. Hoards of Norwegian schist whetstones were found, also evidence of textile, iron and bronze working, but no major industrial evidence, indicating that production was likely for local use only. Unfinished products and garbage pieces point at the production of items made of glass, metals including iron, amber, and horn. The settlement stretched 500 meters along the coast. Within a 10 kilometer range around the settlement, remains of Slavic open settlements have been found. The nearby fortified strongholds of Mecklenburg and Ilow were, like Reric, founded in the late 7th or early 8th century, thus constituting some of the earliest Slavic settlements near the Baltic coast.  Decline  As reported by the Annales regni Francorum of 808 Ain D, Danish king Gudfred (also Godofrid, G√∏ttrik) had received plenty of tribute from Reric in the years before, but in 808 \\"destroyed\\" the emporium and took with him \\"the merchants hereof\\". Gudfred resettled them in Hedeby (also Haithabu, Sliasthorp), a contemporary emporium closer to Denmark. This event was part of ongoing warfare between Denmark and Charlemagne's Frankish Empire, in the course of which the Franks had allied with the Obodrites. The destruction of the site may not have been total, since an Obodrite duke, Drazko, is reported murdered at Reric the following year. \\"Reregi\\", an alternative name of the Obodrites used by the medieval chroniclers Adam of Bremen and Helmold of Bosau, is probably a rendering of \\"Reric\\".

Their home ground is based in Parc Taf Bargoed in the neighbouring village, Trelewis. History The original Treharris club was formed in 1889 as one of the earliest association football clubs based in south Wales and founding members of the South Wales League - a predecessor of the Welsh Football League - in 1890. The Treharris club were one of the foremost association football sides in south Wales in the two decades before the First World War, winning the inaugural South Wales League title in 1891, adding further triumphs in 1905 and 1906. They were also winners of the South Wales Senior Cup in 1904, 1906, 1907 and 1911. Treharris were also founding members of the Rhymney Valley League in 1904, which was renamed as the Welsh Football League in 1913. They were Rhymney Valley League champions in 1910. They joined the Western Football League Division Two in 1906 and were the Western League champions in 1910. Treharris joined the Southern Football League in 1910 and competed in division two for four seasons before the outbreak of the Great War. After organised football resumed in 1919, the club was resumed as Treharris Athletic but did not join the English football pyramid, instead opting to play only in the Welsh Football League, where they generally played in the second tier during the 1920s and 1930s until the Second World War put an end to organised football for six years. When the Welsh League resumed in 1945, Treharris Athletic joined and have enjoyed uninterrupted membership since. In 2009, Treharris Athletic incorporated Western Hotel FC into the club and were re-named Treharris Athletic Western. The home of football in Treharris since 1900 had been The Athletic Ground. However, the ground was condemned in 2016 and for two seasons Treharris were forced to play at different grounds including the Centre for Sporting Excellence in Ystrad Mynach and the Welfare Ground in Fochriw. At the start of the 2018/19 season, Treharris moved into their new permanent home on the former ground of the now defunct Trelewis Welfare Football Club in Parc Taf Bargoed on the site of the former Deep Navigation Colliery. The football ground at Parc Taf Bargoed has been redeveloped and now boasts a covered stand with 100 seats, floodlights and a modern changing room facility which includes a communal space for serving hot food and drinks on matchdays.

Near The Burg (an 18th-century home) lies the Romney Spring which flows from a PVC pipe at the foot of the gap which is visited daily by its patrons along the side of U.S. Route 50. Mechanicsburg Gap is also home to the now closed limestone rock quarry which has cut a massive hole into the gap's northern wall. Adjacent to the quarry is the former Evelyn's Restaurant, which was long a popular steakhouse and truck stop. The site is now home to Good 'n Gooder, a store with a variety of used items.

French Neo- Classicism transmuted into Biedermeier style. The Danish Golden Age () covers a period of exceptional creative production in Denmark, especially during the first half of the 19th century.Kulturnet Danmark, Guide to the Danish Golden Age Although Copenhagen had suffered from fires, bombardment and national bankruptcy, the arts took on a new period of creativity catalysed by Romanticism from Germany. The period is probably most commonly associated with the Golden Age of Danish Painting from 1800 to around 1850 which encompasses the work of Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg and his students, including Wilhelm Bendz, Christen K√∏bke, Martinus R√∏rbye, Constantin Hansen and Wilhelm Marstrand, as well as the sculpture of Bertel Thorvaldsen. It also saw the development of Danish architecture in the Neoclassical style. Copenhagen, in particular, acquired a new look, with buildings designed by Christian Frederik Hansen and Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll. In relation to music, the Golden Age covers figures inspired by Danish romantic nationalism including J. P. E. Hartmann, Hans Christian Lumbye, Niels W. Gade and the ballet master August Bournonville. Literature centred on Romantic thinking, introduced in 1802 by the Norwegian-German philosopher Henrik Steffens. Key contributors were Adam Oehlenschl√§ger, Bernhard Severin Ingemann, N. F. S. Grundtvig and, last but not least, Hans Christian Andersen, the proponent of the modern fairytale. S√∏ren Kierkegaard furthered philosophy while Hans Christian √òrsted achieved fundamental progress in science. The Golden Age thus had a profound effect not only on life in Denmark but, with time, on the international front too. Background and context C.W. Eckersberg (1807) The origins of the Golden Age can be traced back to around the beginning of the 19th century, which was a very rough period for Denmark. Copenhagen, the centre of the country's intellectual life, first experienced huge fires in 1794 and 1795 which destroyed both Christiansborg Palace and large areas of the inner city. In 1801, as a result of the country's involvement in the League of Armed Neutrality, the British fleet inflicted serious damage on the city during the Battle of Copenhagen. In 1807, on rumours that the French might force Denmark to close the Baltic to their shipping, the British once again bombarded Copenhagen, this time specifically targeting the city and its civilian population. Then in 1813, as a result of the country's inability to support the costs of war, Denmark declared a State bankruptcy.\\"Pengereformen, der blev kendt som statsbankerotten\\", Nationalbanken.

To make matters worse, Norway ceased to be part of the Danish realm when it was ceded to Sweden the following year.\\"Historical overview\\", Guide to the Danish Golden Age . Retrieved 30 August 2010. Copenhagen's devastation nevertheless provided new opportunities. Architects and planners widened the streets, constructing beautifully designed Neoclassical buildings offering a brighter yet intimate look. At the time, with a population of only 100,000, the city was still quite small, built within the confines of the old ramparts. As a result, the leading figures of the day met frequently, sharing their ideas, bringing the arts and the sciences together. Henrik Steffens was perhaps the most effective proponent of the Romantic idea. In a series of lectures in Copenhagen, he successfully conveyed the ideas behind German romanticism to the Danes. Influential thinkers, such as Oehlenschl√§ger and Grundtvig were quick to take up his views. It was not long before Danes from all branches of the arts and sciences were involved in a new era of Romantic nationalism, later known as the Danish Golden Age. Henrik Steffens (1773‚Äì1845) who lectured on German romanticism Especially in the field of painting, change became apparent. While art had previously served to uphold the monarchy and the establishment, Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg and his students realized that, with the arrival of industrialization, the middle classes were increasingly gaining power and influence. Grand historical art gave way to more widely appealing but less pretentious genre paintings and landscapes.\\"Danish art before 1900\\" , Aarhus Kunstmuseum. Retrieved 30 August 2010. The Golden Age is generally believed to have lasted until about 1850. Around that time, Danish culture suffered from the outbreak of the First Schleswig War (1848‚Äì1851). In addition, political reforms involving the end of the absolute monarchy in 1848 and the adoption of the Danish constitution the following year signalled the beginning of a new era. Finally, the extension of Copenhagen beyond the old ramparts during the 1850s opened up new horizons for urban expansion. It was not until 1890 that the Danish philosopher Valdemar Vedel first used the term Guldalderen or Golden Age to describe the period. In 1896, author Vilhelm Andersen saw the Golden Age initiated by Henrich Steffens as the richest period in the cultural history of Denmark.Arkiv for Dansk Litteratur ‚Äì Henrich Steffens ‚Äì Forfatterportr√¶t , .

Painting Around the beginning of the 19th century, the Golden Age of Danish Painting emerged to form a distinct national style for the first time since the Middle Ages; the period lasted until the middle of the century. It has a style drawing on Dutch Golden Age painting, especially its landscape painting,Dutch paintings, and landscapes, dominated in the 18th century Danish collections that we have records of. North, 308-9 and depicting northern light that is soft but allows strong contrasts of colour. The treatment of scenes is typically an idealized version of reality, but unpretentiously so, appearing more realist than is actually the case. Interior scenes, often small portrait groups, are also common, with a similar treatment of humble domestic objects and furniture, often of the artist's circle of friends. Little Danish art was seen outside the country (indeed it mostly remains there to this day) although the Danish- trained leader of German Romantic painting Caspar David Friedrich was important in spreading its influence in Germany. A crucial figure was Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, who had studied in Paris with Jacques-Louis David and was further influenced towards Neo-Classicism by the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Eckersberg taught at the Academy from 1818 to 1853, becoming director from 1827 to 1828, and was an important influence on the following generation, in which landscape painting came to the fore.Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg.

An investigation of drawings, underdrawings, oil sketches and finished paintings by Eckersberg and his pupils Christen K√∏bke and Constantin Hansen, using their Italian views as examples, points to a number of important aspects which shed light on the creative process in Danish Golden Age painting in the first half of the 19th century. The preliminary drawings ‚Äì preferably composition drawings ‚Äì which were done in front of the motif were meticulously constructed and reproduced many details. Architecture received the painters‚Äô greatest attention, whereas vegetation, rocks and stones as well as figures in the landscape received a lower priority. The drawing done directly from the motif was squared up in several instances with a view to its transference to the painting, which was often no larger than the drawing. Some elements could be altered during the process, but by and large the artist retained the original dispositions quite precisely. In some cases the architecture was consciously altered so as to strengthen the forms and create harmony in the picture. In this way, we can prove that although the Italian motifs appear realistic at first sight, they were nonetheless adjusted or even manipulated by the artists.J. Wadum, M. Scharff, K. Monrad, \\"Hidden Drawings from the Danish Golden Age. Drawing and underdrawing in Danish Golden Age views from Italy\\" in SMK Art Journal 2006, ed. Peter N√∏rgaard Larsen.

Among other artists, C.A. Jensen (1792‚Äì1870) specialized almost exclusively in portraits. At the end of the period painting style, especially in landscape art, became caught up in the political issue of the Schleswig-Holstein Question, a vital matter for Danes, but notoriously impenetrable for most others in Europe. But it was not until the 1870s when a number of young artists defied the Academy and studied in Paris that a new style embracing Realism and Impressionism began to emerge.Lise Svanholm, \\"Malerne p√• Skagen\\", , Gyldendal 2001, pp 30‚Äì43, .

His mother, Angela, was the last descendant of the ancient and noble Onesti family. His first name is the Italian version of the Athenian general Themistocles. Calzecchi demonstrated in experiments in 1884 through 1886 that iron filings contained in an insulating tube will conduct an electric current under the action of an electromagnetic wave. This discovery was the operating principle behind an early radio wave detector device called the coherer, developed about 6‚Äì10 years later by Oliver Lodge, Edouard Branly, and Guglielmo Marconi, which was influential in the development of radio. Life and work Monterubbiano was his home, where he spent his youth, studied, and spent other periods of his life, and died. Calzecchi graduated from the University of Pisa after studying the physical sciences and mathematics, then devoted himself to teaching in high schools and then scientific research. On 6 December 1879 he was appointed Professor of Physics at the Istituto tecnico at L'Aquila. In 1883 he transferred to the Liceo Classico \\"A. Caro\\" in Fermo. In 1884 he began his studies of electrical resistance and conductivity of metal filings. In 1886, he founded a Physics Laboratory at the High School, including a meteorological observatory, at the expense of the City of Fermo and the Central Office of Meteorology and Geodynamics, organizing a weather information service for the region. In 1888 he moved to the Beccaria school in Milan as a teacher of physics. In 1889 Calzecchi assisted the famous physicist Galileo Ferraris, testing the installation of electric lighting in Fermo. Meanwhile, the great physics discoveries of Heinrich Hertz, Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen, Nicola Tesla and Augusto Righi were made, including the transmission of telegraph signals without wires. Since 1884 Calzecchi had been researching the properties of metal powders, finding high electrical conductivity due to various excitations such as extra current, lightning, electrostatic induction, etc. Calzecchi's experiments with tubes of metal filings led to the development of the first radio wave detector, the coherer, in 1890 by Edouard Branly. This unit consists of a glass tube containing powder and nickel silver with traces of mercury, placed between two steel electrodes in vacuum. When it is hit by electromagnetic fields, the high resistance of the powder becomes relatively low until it is \\"percussed\\"‚Äîthat is, hit, to break the welded bonds between the particles. These studies by Calzecchi predate by nearly six years those of the French physicist Edouard Branly and Oliver Lodge in England, although they are largely credited with the discovery. At the time, Calzecchi saw this as an invention for detecting lightning and as a seismic detector, but a lively debate followed when Branly, Lodge and Marconi used the coherer for radio.

Universalization places the client‚Äôs experience in the context of other individuals who are experiencing the same, or similar challenges, and seeks to help the client grasp that their feelings and experiences are not uncommon given the circumstances. The therapist or social worker using this supportive intervention intends to \\"normalize\\" the client's experience of his/her emotions and reactions to the presenting challenge. By normalising the client‚Äôs experience the therapist is attempting to help avert the client's natural feelings of being alone or not understood. For example, a therapist working with a 21-year-old client who is experiencing rejection from her family and friends after admitting that she is a lesbian will use universalization. The therapist will explain that many other young adults who have revealed their sexual orientation undergo the same rejection and scrutiny from peers and parents. The therapist will follow this up by telling her that her emotional response to the rejection is likewise normal and not at all uncommon given the circumstances. Universalization (cultural studies) Lorna Jean Edmonds and WE (Ted) Hewitt introduced a definition of universalization as an incipient concept describing the next phase of human development, marking the transition from trans-national to interplanetary relations and much more aggressive exploitation of opportunities that lie beyond the confines of Earth. As both a process and an end state, universalization implies an increasingly pervasive, abiding and singular human focus not only on global issues per se but on social, technological, economic and cultural challenges and opportunities extending into our solar system, our galaxy, and well beyond, where cooperation supersedes conflict negotiation.Edmonds, Lorna Jean and WE (Ted) Hewitt, \\"The 21st Century and the Advent of Universalization\\" in Ram Jakhu, Kuan-Wei Chen & Yaw Nyampong, ads, Monograph Series III: Global Space Governance (Montreal: McGill Centre for Research in Air and Space Law, 2015) 119 Its origins are associated with the incipient expansion of social, economic, and political relationships that have emerged in the wake of globalization and that increasingly define the planet, its place within the broader universe and the sustainability of humanity and our diversity. For many, the concept was inspired by Kwame Anthony Appiah's work on cosmopolitanism, and particularly his emphasis on the need to develop a transcendent, collaborative model of human interaction that looks beyond the limited confines of current human relationships. Underlying principles and activities associated with universalization have also been discussed in a number of works dealing with prospective human exploitation of natural resources in space. Evidence of the transition from globalisation to the century of \\"universalization\\" is provided by the exponential growth in outer space activity across all sectors of human endeavour, including exploration (global investments by national governments and consortia of $65 billion annually), governance (the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, the International Association for Space Safety), commerce (aerospace industries such as Boeing, Teledyne, MDA), resource exploitation (Moon Express), Tourism (Virgin Galactic, XCOR), communications (satellites, probes, inter-planetary internet), education (the International Space University, Singularity University, International Institute of Space Commerce), research (observatories at Hawaii, Chile, the Square Kilometer Array, Hubble), and settlement (Mars One). Another reading of \\"universalization\\" has been suggested by Gregory Paul Meyjes. Questioning the various processes (economic, political, cultural) by which globalization or globalisation has favored expeditious Anglo-cultural dominance at the expense of a more broadly-based, gradually-emerging world civilization, Meyjes argues for cultural policies that support \\"ecological\\" relations between local ethnocultural traditions, to protect cultural specificity in the short term and thus to allow as great a variety of groups as possible to voluntarily and organically contribute to the global whole. Meyjes thus proposes universalization as a process of (largely) unfettered yet non-threatening exchange (such as with the aid of an International Auxiliary Language) between and among the world's state-level and sub-state-level groups and \\"nations\\" ‚Äì i.e. a participatory transnational process that informs the gradual emergence of an optimally-inclusive world civilization.

History  Signpost showing directions to the secret bunker. The first military use of the area was in World War II, when a Starfish site was established at Hack Green. Its purpose was to confuse Luftwaffe bombers looking for the vital railway junction at Crewe. A Ground-controlled interception (GCI) radar station was added. In the 1950s, the site was modernised as part of the ROTOR project. This included the provision of a substantial semi-sunk reinforced concrete bunker or blockhouse (type R6). The station, officially designated RAF Hack Green, was also known as Mersey Radar. It provided an air traffic control service to military aircraft crossing civil airspace. The site was abandoned and remained derelict for many years, until taken over by the Home Office. The R6 bunker was then rebuilt as a Regional Government Headquarters (RGHQs) - one of a network of 17 such sites throughout the UK - designed to enable government to continue in the aftermath of a major nuclear attack on the UK. In about 1992, following the end of the Cold War, the Home Office abandoned its network of RGHQs and sold many of the sites. The Hack Green Bunker was purchased by a private company and subsequently opened to the public in 1998 as a museum with a Cold War theme.  Current status  Exhibits include the nose section of an F-4 Phantom jet The bunker is open to the public most of the year. It has a substantial collection of military and Cold War memorabilia, including one of the largest collections of decommissioned nuclear weapons in the world. It also houses Ballistic Missile Early Warning System equipment originally from RAF High Wycombe.Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker: BMEWS The museum includes information about the function of the bunker during the Cold War. There is a simulator designed to simulate conditions in the bunker during a nuclear attack. Visitors can watch the BBC film The War Game, produced to inform the public of what would be likely to happen in a nuclear attack on Britain. Younger visitors to the museum can navigate the rooms in a game to find the \\"Cold War Spy Mice\\" (a large number of toy mice positioned in numerous rooms), the objective being to locate as many mice as possible and return their report to the desk for a prize; this avoids the more disturbing aspects of the bunker, such as the medical room, where a mannequin is depicted with symptoms of burns and radiation poisoning. On television Hack Green was featured in the British television series Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders episode two in which the team investigates the murder of a soldier. It featured once again in Series 11.

Background Her real name was Martadinata Haryono, however, she was better known by her nickname, Ita. At the age of 18 and while a senior year student in her high school, Ita was found dead on October 9, 1998 in her bedroom in Central Jakarta. Her stomach, chest, and right arm were stabbed ten times, while her neck was slashed. The murder occurred just three days after a Jakarta press conference held by the human rights organizations Ita had been involved with. The groups claimed that several of their members had received death threats in an attempt to stop them calling for an international investigation into the gang-rapes, murder, and burning of Indonesian Chinese girls and women during the May 1998 riot; a riot which ultimately forced Suharto to step down from the presidency. Police concluded that Ita's death was an ordinary crime, committed by a drug addict who had entered Ita's home to rob it. According to the police statement, he was caught in the act by Ita and therefore decided to kill her. However, others question this statement because Ita and her mother, Wiwin Haryono, were due to leave in a few days for the United States together with four victims of the May 1998 riot to present their testimony before the U.S. Congress. Ita and her mother had been deeply involved in giving help and counseling to the victims of the riot. The group Ita and her mother had worked most closely with, an organization called Tim Relawan (the Volunteer Team for Humanity), concluded that Ita's murder was a warning to them and others who were involved in this humanitarian effort, to discontinue their activities.

R√∏ll debuted in the top-flight Danish Superliga championship in May 1996,\\"Vejen til den umulige dr√∏m\\", B.T., 18 May 1996 and was a part of the Silkeborg team which won the international 1996 UEFA Intertoto Cup competition, beating Croatian team HNK Segesta in the final games. R√∏ll quickly established himself in the first team, and played 29 of 33 league games during the 1996-97 Superliga season. He played six seasons for Silkeborg IF, and eventually settled as the playmaker of the team. In his position of deep-lying forward, he especially experienced a successful striking partnership with Henrik Pedersen.

He had a hard time re-entering the FCK starting line- up, and was loaned out to his former club Silkeborg IF in February 2005. He played the second half of the 2004-05 Superliga season for Silkeborg, helping the club avoid relegation. Back in FCK, R√∏ll injured his ankle in July 2005, and was soon out of the FCK starting line-up. Last years With his FCK contract expiring in the summer 2006, he moved to league rivals FC Midtjylland (FCM) on a free transfer. R√∏ll suffered another injury before playing any games for FCM, and underwent rehabilitation until January 2007. He played 18 Superliga games for FCM, before moving on loan to Danish 1st Division team Vejle BK. He made his Vejle debut in March 2008, and helped the club win promotion for the Superliga.

The images of deep snow drifts and produce on display in the markets are brilliantly festive, yet Finch still manages to create a sense of terror that holds true to the Victorian spirit of the Christmas ghost story.

He is known for his service to the British South Africa Company and to the British Army in colonial Africa, and for teaching woodcraft to Robert Baden-Powell in Rhodesia. He helped inspire the founding of the international Scouting Movement. Burnham was born on a Dakota Sioux Indian reservation in Minnesota where he learned the ways of American Indians as a boy. By the age of 14, he was supporting himself in California, while also learning scouting from some of the last of the cowboys and frontiersmen of the American Southwest. Burnham had little formal education, never finishing high school. After moving to the Arizona Territory in the early 1880s, he was drawn into the Pleasant Valley War, a feud between families of ranchers and sheepherders. He escaped and later worked as a civilian tracker for the United States Army in the Apache Wars. Feeling the need for new adventures, Burnham took his family to southern Africa in 1893, seeing Cecil Rhodes's Cape to Cairo Railway project as the next undeveloped frontier. Burnham distinguished himself in several battles in Rhodesia and South Africa and became Chief of Scouts. Despite his U.S. citizenship, his military title was British and his rank of major was formally given to him by King Edward VII. In special recognition of Burnham's heroism, the King invested him into the Companions of the Distinguished Service Order, giving Burnham the highest military honors earned by any American in the Second Boer War. He had become friends with Baden-Powell during the Second Matabele War in Rhodesia, teaching him outdoor skills and inspiring what would later become known as Scouting. Burnham returned to the United States, where he became involved in national defense efforts, business, oil, conservation, and the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). During World War I, Burnham was selected as an officer and recruited volunteers for a U.S. Army division similar to the Rough Riders, which Theodore Roosevelt intended to lead into France. For political reasons, the unit was disbanded without seeing action. After the war, Burnham and his business partner John Hays Hammond formed the Burnham Exploration Company; they became wealthy from oil discovered in California. Burnham joined several new wilderness conservation organizations, including the California State Parks Commission. In the 1930s, he worked with the BSA to save the big horn sheep from extinction. This effort led to the creation of the Kofa and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona. He earned the BSA's highest honor, the Silver Buffalo Award, in 1936, and remained active in the organization at both the regional and national level until his death in 1947. To symbolise the friendship between Burnham and Baden-Powell, the mountain beside Mount Baden-Powell in California was formally named Mount Burnham in 1951. Early life alt=Burnham portrait photograph taken in Arizona Territory in 1881 Burnham was born on May 11, 1861, on a Dakota Sioux Indian reservation in Minnesota, to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32 km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; he was born in Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep in the basket with the corn husks. The young Burnham attended schools in Iowa. There he met Blanche Blick, whom he later married. The Burnham family moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles, California in 1870, in search of easier living conditions soon after Edwin was seriously injured in an accident while rebuilding the family homestead. Two years later, Edwin died, leaving the family destitute. Burnham's mother and three-year-old younger brother Howard returned to Iowa to live with her parents; the 12-year-old Burnham remained in California alone to repay his family's debts and ultimately make his own way. For the next few years, Burnham worked as a mounted messenger for the Western Union Telegraph Company in California and Arizona Territory. On one occasion his horse was stolen from him by Tiburcio V√°squez, a famous Californio bandit. At 14, he began his life as a scout and Indian tracker in the Apache Wars, during which he took part in the United States Army expedition to find and capture or kill the Apache chief Geronimo. In Prescott, Arizona, he met an old scout named Lee who served under General George Crook. Lee taught Burnham how to track Apache by detecting the odor of burning mescal, a species of aloe they often cooked and ate. With careful study of the local air currents and canyons, trackers could follow the odor to Apache hiding places from as far away as 6 miles (9.7 km). During the Apache uprisings, the young Burnham also learned much from Al Sieber, the Chief of Scouts, and his assistant Archie McIntosh, who had been Chief of Scouts in Crook's last two campaigns. Burnham learned much about scouting from these Indian trackers, who were advanced in age and fading from the frontier, including the vital lesson that \\"it is imperative that a scout should know the history, tradition, religion, social customs, and superstitions of whatever country or people he is called on to work in or among.\\" But the scout who was to have perhaps the greatest influence on Burnham during his formative years was a man named Holmes. alt=Caption reads: Burnham's sidearm in the Tonto Basin, the Geronimo Campaign, Rhodesia, East Africa, and Mexico was this Remington Model 1875, serial no. 11, in .44‚Äì40 caliber. Holster and Rhodesian bandoleer are original; the .44‚Äì40 cartridge box bears the stamp of the Rhodesian government. Pistol grips are hippo ivory. Holmes had served under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, but he was old and physically impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart his knowledge of the frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years. In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly joined the losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only narrowly escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, he felt he had to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him on the wrong side of the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies. During this time he met \\"a fine, hard riding young Kansan, who I had met on an Indian raid and whose nerve I greatly admired.\\" The young Kansan, who had been swindled by an unscrupulous superintendent of mines, had a plan to rustle cattle and horses from the superintendent and sell them to Curly Bill (William Brocius), an outlaw with whom he had indirectly been in contact. Both men were broke at the time, and the job sounded easy. But Burnham had always rejected the life of a thief and even as a wanted man, he did not view himself as a criminal. Burnham began to see that even though he joined the feud to help his friends, he had been in the wrong, that \\"avenging only led to more vengeance and to even greater injustice than that suffered through the often unjustly administered laws of the land.\\" Burnham decided to reject the offer of the young Kansan (who followed through with the plan and was later killed), and that he needed to leave the Tonto Basin. Judge Aaron Hackney, editor of the local Arizona Silver Belt newspaper and a friend, helped him escape to Tombstone, Arizona with the assistance of Neil McLeod. He was a well-known prizefighter in Tombstone and one of the most successful smugglers along the Arizona‚ÄìMexico frontier. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral had occurred only a few months earlier, but as Tombstone was a boomtown attracting new silver miners from all parts, it was an ideal location to hide out. Burnham assumed several aliases and occasionally he delivered messages for McLeod and his smuggler partners in Sonora, Mexico. From McLeod, he learned many valuable tricks for avoiding detection, passing coded messages, and throwing off pursuers. Burnham eventually went back to California to attend high school, but he never graduated. He returned to Arizona and was appointed Deputy Sheriff of Pinal County, but he soon went back to herding cattle and prospecting. After he went to Prescott, Iowa to visit his childhood sweetheart Blanche, the two were married on February 6, 1884. He was 23 years old. He and Blanche settled down soon after in Pasadena, California, to tend to an orange grove but soon Burnham returned to prospecting and scouting. Active as a Freemason, he rose to become a Thirty-Second Degree Mason of the Scottish Rite. During the 1880s, sections of the American press popularized the notion that the West had been won and there was nothing left to conquer in the United States. The time when great scouts like Kit Carson, Daniel Boone, and Davy Crockett could explore and master the wild and uncharted Western territories was coming to a close. Contemporary scouts such as Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, and Texas Jack Omohundro, were leaving the old West to become entertainers, and they battled great Native American chiefs like Sitting Bull, Chief Joseph, and Geronimo only in Wild West shows. In 1890 the United States Census Bureau formally closed the American frontier, ending the system under which land in the Western territories had been sold cheaply to pioneers. As a \\"soldier of fortune\\", as Richard Harding Davis later called him, Burnham began to look elsewhere for the next undeveloped frontier, feeling that the American West was becoming tame and unchallenging. When he heard of the work of Cecil Rhodes and his pioneers in southern Africa, who were working to build a railway across Africa from Cape to Cairo, Burnham sold what little he owned. In 1893 with his wife and young son, he set sail for Durban in South Africa, intending to join Rhodes's pioneers in Matabeleland and Mashonaland. Military career=First Matabele War Bob Bain; Burnham (middle) during the alt=Photo taken in 1893 of three Bulawayo field scouts kneeling in front of their horses. Bob Bain on the left, Burnham in the middle, Maurice Gifford and his dog on the right. Burnham is dressed in his Arizona clothes and is holding his Winchester model 1873 .44WCF rifle Burnham, along with his wife and son, was trekking the 1,000 miles (1,609 km) north from Durban to Matabeleland with an American buckboard and six donkeys when war broke out between Rhodes's British South Africa Company and the Matabele (or Ndebele) King Lobengula in late 1893. He signed up to scout for the company immediately on reaching Matabeleland, and joined the fighting. Leander Starr Jameson, the company's Chief Magistrate in Mashonaland, hoped to defeat the Matabele quickly by capturing Lobengula at his royal town of Bulawayo, and so sent Burnham and a small group of scouts ahead to report on the situation there. While on the outskirts of town they watched as the Matabele burned down and destroyed everything in sight. By the time the company troops had arrived in force, Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo. The company then moved into the remains of Bulawayo, established a base, and sent out patrols to find Lobengula. The most famous of these patrols was the Shangani Patrol, led by Major Allan Wilson and the man he chose as his Chief of Scouts, Fred Burnham. =Shangani Patrol= alt=A black-and-white sketch depicting a southern African battle fought amidst long grass in a thick wood. The image focuses on two figures in the foreground: a white soldier on horseback (on the left) and a black warrior on foot (on the right). The white man has apparently just fired his rifle at the warrior, who is thrown back in his stride by the shot, his spear falling from his right hand. More soldiers and warriors can be seen in the background. Jameson sent a column of soldiers under Major Patrick Forbes to locate and capture Lobengula. The column camped on the south bank of the Shangani River about north-east of the village of Lupane on the evening of December 3, 1893. The next day, late in the afternoon, a dozen men under the command of Major Wilson were sent across the river to patrol the area. The Wilson Patrol came across a group of Matabele women and children who claimed to know Lobengula's whereabouts. Burnham, who served as the lead scout of the Wilson Patrol, sensed a trap and advised Wilson to withdraw, but Wilson ordered his patrol to advance. Soon afterwards, the patrol found the king and Wilson sent a message back to the laager requesting reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, under the command of Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson's patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning; however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson's patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other men, Pearl \\"Pete\\" Ingram (a Montana cowboy) and William Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, \\"I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party.\\" Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed. Colonial-era histories called this the Shangani Patrol, and hailed Wilson and Borrow as national heroes. Their last stand together became a kind of national myth, as Lewis Gann writes, \\"a glorious memory, [Rhodesia's] own equivalent of the bloody Alamo massacre and Custer's Last Stand in the American West\\". The version of events recorded by history is based on the accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes' column. While all of the direct evidence given by eyewitnesses supports the findings of the Court of Inquiry, some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham, Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help, and suggest that they might have simply deserted when the battle got rough. The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is long after the event in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan to a friend, John Carruthers, that \\"a very reliable man informed me that Wools-Sampson told him\\" that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord. This double hearsay confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which instead recounts the events as generally recorded. Several well-known writers have used the Coghlan letter, as shaky as it is, as clearance to create hypothetical evidence in an attempt to challenge and revise the historical record. All of the officers and troopers of Forbes' column had high praise for Burnham's actions, and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later. One member of the column, Trooper M E Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald in 1944 that once Commandant Piet Raaff took over command from the disgraced Major Forbes it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: \\"I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion.\\" For his service in the war, Burnham was presented the British South Africa Company Medal, a gold watch, and a share of a 300-acre (120 ha) tract of land in Matabeleland. It was here that Burnham uncovered many artifacts in the huge granite ruins of the ancient civilization of Great Zimbabwe. Matabeleland became part of the Company domain, which was formally named Rhodesia, after Rhodes, in 1895. Matabeleland and Mashonaland became collectively called Southern Rhodesia. Northern Rhodesia exploration In 1895, Burnham oversaw and led the Northern Territories British South Africa Exploration Company expedition that first established for the British South Africa Company that major copper deposits existed north of the Zambezi in North-Eastern Rhodesia. Along the Kafue River, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the United States, and he encountered native peoples wearing copper bracelets. After this expedition he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Later, the British South Africa Company built the mining towns of the Copperbelt and a railroad to transport the ore through Portuguese Mozambique. Second Matabele War In March 1896, the Matabele again rose up against the British South Africa Company administration in what became called the Second Matabele War or the First Chimurenga (liberation war). Mlimo, the Matabele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. The colonists' defenses in Matabeleland were undermanned due to the ill-fated Jameson Raid into the South African Republic (or Transvaal), and in the first few months of the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Selous. The Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the Matopos Hills near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting between Matabele warriors and settler patrols. It was also during this war that two scouts of very different backgrounds, Burnham and Baden-Powell, would first meet and discuss ideas for training youth that would eventually become the plan for the program and the code of honor for the Boy Scouts. =Assassination of Mlimo= alt=Drawing of Burnham and Bonar Armstrong soon after the shooting of the Mlimo priest in the Matopos Hills. The two men are on their horses, holding their rifles, and fleeing from the scene. Burnham looks back and sees many angry Matabele warriors running behind him in hot pursuit. The turning point in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a sanctuary then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him. Burnham and Armstrong leapt over the dead Mlimo and ran down a trail toward their horses. The warriors in the village nearby picked up their arms and searched for the attackers; to distract them, Burnham set fire to some of their huts. The two men escaped and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and made peace with the rebels, ending the Second Matabele War. Klondike Gold Rush With the Matabele wars over, Burnham decided it was time to leave Africa and move on to other adventures. The family returned to California. Soon after, Fred traveled to Alaska and the Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, taking with him his eldest son Roderick, who was then 12 years old. On hearing of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but the war had ended before he could get to the fighting. Burnham returned to the Klondike having played no part in the war. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book. Second Boer War alt=Photo of Burnham taken in 1901 in London after his investiture with the cross of the Distinguished Service Order by King Edward VII. He is dressed in British Army uniform and standing at attention, facing right. On his left arm is a black armband worn in mourning for the recent death of Queen Victoria. He is wearing his stetson hat and a sword on his left side. He sports a large handlebar mustache. The Second Boer War (October 1899 ‚Äì May 1902) was fought between the British and two independent Boer republics, the South African Republic and the Orange Free State, partly the result of long-simmering strife between them. It was directly caused by each side's desire to control the lucrative Witwatersrand gold mines in the Transvaal. Field Marshal Frederick Roberts, one of the British Army's most successful commanders of the 19th century, was appointed to take overall command of British forces, relieving General Redvers Buller, following a number of Boer successes in the early weeks of the war, including the Siege of Mafeking, in which Baden-Powell, his small regiment of men, and the townspeople had been besieged by thousands of Boer troops since the conflict began. Roberts asked General Frederick Carrington, who had commanded the British forces in Matabeleland three years earlier, whom he should appoint as his Chief of Scouts in South Africa. Carrington had selected Burnham for this role and advised Roberts to do the same, describing Burnham as \\"the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa.\\" Roberts sent for Burnham soon after arriving in South Africa on the RMS Dunottar Castle. The American scout was prospecting near Skagway, Alaska, when he received the following telegram in January 1900: \\"Lord Roberts appoints you on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. If you accept, come at once the quickest way possible.\\" Cape Town is at the opposite end of the globe from the Klondike, so Burnham left immediately departing on the very same boat that had brought him the telegram. In an unusual step for a foreigner, Burnham received a command post from Roberts and the British Army rank of captain. Burnham reached the front just before the Battle of Paardeberg (February 1900). During the war, Burnham spent much time behind the Boer lines gathering information and blowing up railway bridges and tracks. He was captured twice (escaping both times), and also temporarily disabled at one point by near-fatal wounds. Burnham was first captured during the fighting at Sanna's Post in the Orange Free State. He gave himself up in order to obtain information on the enemy, which he did, and then he escaped from his guards and succeed in reaching British occupied Bloemfontein safely after two days and nights on the run. The second time he was captured was while trying to warn a British column approaching Thaba' Nchu. He came upon a group of Boers hiding on the banks of the river, toward which the British were even then advancing. Cut off from his own side, Burnham chose to signal the approaching soldiers even though it would expose him to capture. With a red kerchief, Burnham signaled the soldiers to turn back, but the column paid no attention and plodded steadily on into the ambush, while Burnham was at once taken prisoner. In the fight that followed, Burnham pretended to receive a wound in the knee, limping heavily and groaning with pain. He was placed in a wagon with the officers who really were wounded and who, in consequence, were not closely guarded. Later that evening, Burnham slipped over the driver's seat, dropped between the two wheels of the wagon, lowered himself, and fell between the legs of the oxen on his back in the road. In an instant, the wagon had passed over him safely, and while the dust still hung above the trail he rolled rapidly over into the ditch at the side of the road and lay motionless. It was four days before he was able to re-enter the British lines, during which time he had been lying in the open veld. He had subsisted on one biscuit and two handfuls of \\"mielies\\" (i.e., maize). On June 2, 1900, during the British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He was on a mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and supplies to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria‚ÄìDelagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept on his hands and knees to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days. Burnham's injuries were so serious that he was ordered to England by Lord Roberts. Two days before leaving for London, he was promoted to the rank of major, having received letters of commendation or congratulations from Baden-Powell, Rhodes, and Field Marshal Roberts. On his arrival in England, Burnham was commanded to dine with Queen Victoria and to spend the night at Osborne House. A few months later, after the Queen's death, King Edward VII personally presented Burnham with the Queen's South Africa Medal with four bars for the battles at Driefontein (March 10, 1900), Johannesburg (May 31, 1900), Paardeberg (February 17‚Äì26, 1900), and Cape Colony (October 11, 1899 ‚Äì May 31, 1902), in addition to the cross of the Distinguished Service Order, the second highest decoration in the British Army, for his heroism during the \\"victorious\\" march to Pretoria (June 2‚Äì5, 1900). The King also made his British Army appointment and rank permanent, in spite of his U.S. citizenship. Burnham received the highest awards of any American who served in the Second Boer War. Following his investiture, the British press hailed him as: \\"The King of Army Scouts\\". Burnham's most accomplished soldiers during the Second Boer War were the Lovat Scouts, a Scottish Highland regiment he commanded, whom he described as \\"half wolf and half jackrabbit.\\" Formed by Lord Lovat in 1899, this yeomanry unit was the first to wear Ghillie suits, a type of camouflage clothing developed to resemble heavy foliage. These scouts were well practiced in the arts of marksmanship, field craft, and tactics. After the war, the Lovat Scouts went on to become the British army's first sniper unit. \\"Father of Scouting\\" alt=Photograph of three men at a Boy Scout event circa 1910. The man seated on the left is unidentified, Burnham is in the middle, standing, and Baden-Powell is on the right, seated. There is a table in front of the men. Baden-Powell is wearing his stetson hat, Burnham has no hat, and man on the left has a modest hat. Behind Burnham and to his right is a flag partially opened. Burnham was already a celebrated scout when he first befriended Baden-Powell during the Second Matabele War, but the backgrounds of these two scouts was as strange a contrast as it is possible to imagine. From his youth on the open plains, Burnham's earliest playmates were Sioux Indian boys and their ambitions pointed to excelling in the lore and arts of the trail and together they dreamed of some day becoming great scouts. When Burnham was a teenager he supported himself by hunting game and making long rides for Western Union through the California deserts, his early mentors were wise old scouts of the American West, and by 19 he was a seasoned scout chasing and being chased by Apache. The British scout he would later befriend and serve with in Matabeleland, Baden-Powell, was born in London and had graduated from Charterhouse, one of England's most famous public schools. Baden-Powell developed an ambition to become a scout at an early age. He passed an exam that gave him an immediate commission into the British Army when he was 19, but it would take several years before he was engaged in any active service. When the two men met in 1896, Baden-Powell was an army intelligence officer and a brilliant outdoorsman who had organized a small scouting section in his regiment, written a book called Reconnaissance and Scouting (1884) and served in India, Afghanistan, Natal and Ashanti. Burnham, meanwhile, was General Carrington's Chief of Scouts. During the siege of Bulawayo, these two men rode many times into the Matopos Hills on patrol, and it was in these hills that Burnham first introduced Baden-Powell to the ways and methods of the Native Americans, and taught him \\"woodcraft\\" (better known today as Scoutcraft). Baden-Powell had written at length about reconnaissance and tracking, but from Burnham he learned many new dimensions such as how to travel in wild country without either a compass or map, how to discover nearby dangers by observing animals, and the many techniques for finding potable water. So impressed was Baden-Powell by Burnham's Scouting spirit that he closely listened to all he had to tell. It was also here that Baden-Powell began to wear his signature Stetson campaign hat and neckerchief, like those worn by Burnham, for the first time. Both men recognized that wars were changing markedly and that the British Army needed to adapt. During their joint scouting missions, Baden- Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training program in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self- reliance. In Africa, no scout embodied these traits more than Burnham. In his first scouting handbook, Aids to Scouting (1899), Baden-Powell published many of the lessons he learned from Burnham and this book was later used by boys' groups as a guide to outdoor fun. At the urging of several youth leaders, Baden-Powell decided to adapt his scouting handbook specifically to training boys. While Baden-Powell went on to refine the concept of Scouting, publish Scouting for Boys (1908), and become the founder of the international Scouting movement, Burnham has been called the movement's father. James E. West, Chief Scout Executive for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), summarized Burnham's historical relevance to Scouting: \\"There is an especial significance for those of us in Scouting in this man's list, for he was engaged for this work by Lord Baden Powell, who was then connected with the British Army in Africa, and who had unbounded admiration for the scouting methods of Frederick Burnham. So these two pioneers, each of whom was to have such immeasurable influence in restoring the old traditions of American youth, met in Africa, years before the Scouting movement was ever thought of.\\" U.S. Geological Survey topographical map of the Boy Scout park service trail in California that connects alt=A map. See description Burnham later became close friends with others involved in the Scouting movement in the United States, such as Theodore Roosevelt, the Chief Scout Citizen, and Gifford Pinchot, the Chief Scout Forester, and E. B. DeGroot, BSA Scout Executive of Los Angeles. DeGroot said of Burnham: \\"Here is the sufficient and heroic figure, model and living example, who inspired and gave Baden-Powell the plan for the program and the code of honor of Scouting for Boys.\\" With assistance from Baden-Powell, the BSA published his biography: He-who-sees-in-the-dark; the Boys' Story of Frederick Burnham, the American Scout. The BSA made Burnham an Honorary Scout in 1927, and for his noteworthy and extraordinary service to the Scouting movement, Burnham was bestowed the highest commendation given by the BSA, the Silver Buffalo Award, in 1936. Throughout his life he remained active in Scouting at both the regional and the national level in the United States and he corresponded regularly with Baden-Powell on Scouting topics. Burnham and Baden-Powell remained close friends for their long lives. Burnham called Baden-Powell a \\"wonderfully able scout\\", and nicknamed him \\"Sherlock Holmes.\\" Baden-Powell considered Burnham to be \\"the greatest scout alive.\\" The seal on the Burnham‚ÄìBaden-Powell letters at Yale and Stanford expired in 2000 and the true depth of their friendship and love of Scouting has again been revealed. In 1931, Burnham read the speech dedicating Mount Baden-Powell, California, to his old Scouting friend. Their friendship, and equal status in the world of Scouting and conservation, was honored in 1951 with the dedication of the adjoining peak as Mount Burnham. Burnham's descendants followed in his footsteps and are active in Scouting and in the military. His son Roderick enlisted in the U.S. Army and he fought in France in World War I. His grandson, Frederick Russell Burnham II, was a leader in the BSA and a Vietnam War veteran. His great-grandson, Russell Adam Burnham, is an Eagle Scout and was the United States Army's Soldier of the Year in 2003. Later life=Post war The mysterious alt=Photo taken in 1910 in Mexico of the very large Esperanza Stone, with Burnham standing to the right of the stone. The many inscriptions on the stone are sort of circular and have been filled in with white flour so they can be easily photographed. In the background is a desert landscape. After convalescing, Burnham became the London office manager for the Wa Syndicate, a commercial body with interests in the Gold Coast and neighboring territories in West Africa. He led the Wa Syndicate's 1901 expedition through the Gold Coast and the Upper Volta, looking for minerals and ways to improve river navigation. Between 1902 and 1904 he was employed by the East Africa Syndicate, for which he led a vast mineral prospecting expedition in the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya). Traveling extensively in the area around Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana), he discovered a huge soda lake. Mexico Burnham returned to North America and for the next few years became associated with the Yaqui River irrigation project in Mexico. While investigating the Yaqui valley for mineral and agricultural resources, Burnham reasoned that a dam could provide year-round water to rich alluvial soil in the valley; turning the region into one of the garden spots of the world and generate much needed electricity. He purchased water rights and some of land in this region and contacted an old friend from his time in Africa, John Hays Hammond, who conducted his own studies and then purchased an additional of this land‚Äîan area the size of Rhode Island. Burnham together with Charles Frederick Holder made important archaeological discoveries of Mayan civilization in this region, including the Esperanza Stone. In 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D√≠az planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico, an historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Burnham was put in charge of a private security detail, 250 men hired by Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. vice- presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D√≠az. After the Taft-D√≠az summit, Burnham led a team of 500 men in guarding mining properties owned by Hammond, J. P. Morgan, and the Guggenheims in the Mexican state of Sonora. Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, a long series of Mexican revolutions began. The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to the Mexican government. World War I During this period, Burnham was one of the 18 officers selected by former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt to raise a volunteer infantry division for service in France in 1917 shortly after the United States entered the war. A plan to raise volunteer soldiers from the Western U.S. came out of a meeting of the New York-based Rocky Mountain Club and Burnham was put in charge of both the general organization and recruitment. Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise up to four divisions similar to the Rough Riders of 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and to the British Army 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers; however, as Commander-in-chief, President Woodrow Wilson refused to make use of Roosevelt's volunteers. Roosevelt had been an outspoken critic of Wilson's neutrality policies, so even though Roosevelt had made several attempts to come to an agreement with Wilson, the President was unwilling to accept any compromise. In an astute political maneuver, Wilson announced to the press that he would not send Roosevelt and his volunteers to France, but instead would send an American Expeditionary Force under the command of General John Pershing. Roosevelt was left with no option except to disband the volunteers. He never forgave Wilson, and quickly published The Foes Of Our Own Household, a harsh indictment of the sitting president. These relentless attacks helped the Republicans win control of Congress in 1918. Roosevelt might have been a serious candidate for president in 1920 had he not died in 1919. During World War I, Burnham was living in California and was active in counterespionage for Britain. Much of it involved a famous Boer spy, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne, who became a German spy in both World Wars and claimed to have killed Field Marshal Kitchener while en route to meet with the Russians. During the Second Boer War, Burnham and Duquesne were each under orders to assassinate the other, but it was not until 1910 that the two men first met while both were in Washington, D.C., separately lobbying Congress to pass a bill in favor of the importation of African game animals into the United States (H.R. 23621). Duquesne was twice arrested by the FBI and in 1942 he and 32 other Nazi agents (the Duquesne Spy Ring) were jailed for espionage in the largest spy ring conviction in U.S. history. Oil wealth alt=Photograph taken circa 1930 of Burnham with his son Roderick. Frederick Burnham is on the left, and Roderick Burnham is on the right. Both men are wearing suits and ties and they seated at a table with many papers in front of them. Although Burnham had lived all over the world, he never had a great deal of wealth to show for his efforts. It was not until he returned to California, the place of his youth, that he found great affluence. In November 1923, he struck oil in Dominguez Hills, near Carson, California. In a field that covered just two square miles, over 150 wells from Union Oil were soon producing 37,000 barrels a day, with 10,000 barrels a day going to the Burnham Exploration Company, a syndicate formed in 1919 between Frederick Burnham, his son Roderick, John Hayes Hammond, and his son Harris Hammond. In the first 10 years of operation, the Burnham Exploration Company paid out $10.2 million in dividends. The spot where Burnham found oil was land where \\"as a small boy he used to graze cattle, and shoot game which he sold to the neighboring mining districts to support his widowed mother and infant brother.\\" Many years after the oil was depleted, the land near the Dominguez field was re-developed and became the site of the California State University, Dominguez Hills. In 2010, Occidental Petroleum Corporation expressed interest in redeveloping the former Dominguez oil field using modern extraction technologies. Conservation Celebrating his 80th birthday with Boy Scouts, alt=Photograph of Burnham in 1941 celebrating his 80th birthday with several Boy Scouts. All of them are posing in Carlsbad caverns. The boys are dressed in their Boy Scout uniforms. Burnham is dressed in a full suit and tie and wearing a white hat. An avid conservationist and hunter, Burnham supported the early conservation programs of his friends Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot. He and his associate John Hayes Hammond led novel game expeditions to Africa with the goal of finding large animals such as Giant Eland, hippopotamus, zebra, and various bird species that might be bred in the United States and become game for future American sportsmen. Burnham, Hammond, and Duquesne appeared several times before the House Committee on Agriculture to ask for help in importing large African animals. In 1914, he helped establish the Wild Life Protective League of America, Department of Southern California, and served as its first Secretary. In his later years, Burnham filled various public offices and also served as a member of the Boone and Crockett Club of New York, and as a founding member of the American Committee for International Wildlife Protection (now a committee of the World Conservation Union). He was one of the original members of the first California State Parks Commission (serving from 1927 to 1934), a founding member of the Save the Redwoods League, president of the Southwest Museum of Los Angeles from 1938 until 1940, and he served as both the Honorary President of the Arizona Boy Scouts and as a regional executive for the BSA throughout the 1940s until his death in 1947. In 1936, Burnham enlisted the Arizona Boy Scouts in a campaign to save the Desert Bighorn Sheep from probable extinction. Several other prominent Arizonans and environmental groups joined the movement and a \\"save the bighorns\\" poster contest was started in schools throughout the state. Burnham provided prizes and appeared in store windows from one end of Arizona to the other. The contest-winning bighorn emblem was made into neckerchief slides for the 10,000 Boy Scouts, and talks and dramatizations were given at school assemblies and on radio. On January 18, 1939, over 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2) were set aside in Arizona to establish the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, and Burnham gave the dedication speech. Personal life At 5 ft 4 in (1.62 m), Burnham was short, but he was also muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish appearance which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains. Burnham would not smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of his sense of smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when scouting or traveling where there was no water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures. Burnham died of heart failure at the age of 86, on September 1, 1947, at his home in Santa Barbara, California. He was buried at a private ceremony at Three Rivers, California, near his old cattle ranch, La Cuesta. His memorial stone was designed by his only surviving child, Roderick. Also buried at Three Rivers cemetery are his first wife, Blanche, several members of the Blick family who had also pioneered 1890s Rhodesia with Burnham, Roderick, his granddaughter Martha Burnham Burleigh, and \\"Pete\\" Ingram, the Montana cowboy who had survived the Shangani Patrol massacre along with Burnham. Family alt=Photo of Blanche Blick Burnham taken in 1896 in Bulawayo, Rhodesia. She is seated at a table and her head is leaning on her right arm. She is wearing a flowing dress. Burnham's wife of 55 years, Blanche (February 25, 1862 ‚Äì December 22, 1939) of Nevada, Iowa, accompanied him in very primitive conditions through many travels in both the Southwest United States and southern Africa. Together they had three children, all of whom spent their early youth in Africa. In the early years, she watched over the children and the pack animals, and she always kept a rifle nearby. In the dark of night, she used her rifle many times against lions and hyena and, during the Siege of Bulawayo, against Matabele warriors. Several members of the Blick family joined the Burnhams in Rhodesia, moved with them to England, and returned to the United States with the Burnhams to live near Three Rivers, California. When Burnham Exploration Company struck it rich in 1923, the Burnhams moved to a mansion built by Pasadena architect Joseph Blick, his brother-in-law, in a new housing development then known as Hollywoodland (a name later shortened to \\"Hollywood\\") and took many trips around the world in high style. In 1939, Blanche suffered a stroke. She died a month later and was buried in the Three Rivers Cemetery. alt=Photograph of Roderick Burnham seated in a biplane, looking backwards toward the camera, and wearing a period pilot's cap and goggles. Burnham's first son, Roderick (August 22, 1886 ‚Äì July 2, 1976), was born in Pasadena, California, but accompanied the family to Africa and learned the Matabele language, Sindebele. He went to boarding school in France in 1895, and then to a military school in England the following year. In 1898, he went to Skagway, Alaska with his father, and returned to Pasadena the next year. In 1904, he attended the University of California, Berkeley, joined the football team, but left Berkeley after a dispute with his coach. In 1905‚Äì08, he went to the University of Arizona, joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, played the position of running back, and became the captain of the football team. He attended the Michigan School of Mines (now Michigan Technological University) in 1910, became a geologist, and worked for Union Oil as Manager of Lands and Foreign Exploration helping to develop the first wells in Mexico and Venezuela. He took time off from his job to serve in the U.S. Army in World War I and fought in France. He and his father became minority owners of the Burnham Exploration Company, incorporated in 1919 by Harris Hays Hammond (the son of John Hays Hammond, Sr). In 1930, he and Paramount Pictures founder W. W. Hodkinson started the Central American Aviation Corporation, the first airline in Guatemala. Nada (May 1894 ‚Äì May 19, 1896), Burnham's daughter, was the first white child born in Bulawayo; she died of fever and starvation during the town's siege. She was buried three days later in the town's Pioneer Cemetery, plot No. 144\\\\. Nada is the Zulu word for lily and she was named after the heroine in Sir H. Rider Haggard's Zulu tale, Nada the Lily (1892). Three of Haggard's books are dedicated to Burnham's daughter, Nada: The Wizard (1896), Elissa: The Doom of Zimbabwe (1899), and Black Heart and White Heart: A Zulu Idyll (1900). Burnham's youngest son, Bruce B. Burnham (1897 ‚Äì October 3, 1905), was staying with his parents in London when he accidentally drowned in the River Thames. His brother, Roderick, was in California the night Bruce died, yet claimed to know from a dream exactly what had happened. Roderick awoke screaming and rushed to tell his grandmother about his nightmare. The next morning, a cable arrived with the news of Bruce's death. alt=Photo of Burnham's brother Mather Howard Burnham. Howard is wearing a suit and tie and standing with his right hand in his pocket. His brother Howard Burnham (1870‚Äì1918), born shortly before the family moved to Los Angeles, lost one leg at the age of 14 and suffered from tuberculosis. During his teenage years he lived with Fred in California and learned from his brother the art of Scoutcraft, how to shoot, and how to ride the range, all in spite of his wooden leg. Howard moved to Africa, became a mining engineer in the Johannesburg gold mines, and later wrote a text book on Modern Mine Valuation. He traveled the world and for a time teamed up with Fred on Yaqui River irrigation project in Mexico. During World War I, Howard worked as a spy for the French government, operating behind enemy lines in southwest Germany. Throughout the war he used his wooden leg to conceal tools he needed for spying. From his death bed, Howard returned to France via Switzerland and shared his vital data and secrets with the French government: the Germans were not opening a new front in the Alps and there was no need to move allied troops away from the Western Front. Howard was buried at Cannes, France, leaving behind his wife and four children. He had been named after his second cousin, Lieutenant Howard Mather Burnham who was killed in action in the American Civil War. Burnham's first cousin Charles Edward Russell (1860‚Äì1941) was a journalist and politician and also a founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The author of a number of books of biography and social commentary Russell won a Pulitzer Prize in 1928 for his biography: The American Orchestra and Theodore Thomas. In 1943, at 83 years of age, Burnham married his much younger typist, Ilo K. Willits Burnham (June 20, 1894 ‚Äì August 28, 1982). The couple sold their mansion and moved to Santa Barbara in 1946. Burnham was a descendant of Thomas Burnham (1617‚Äì1688) of Hartford, Connecticut, the first American ancestor of a large number of Burnhams. The descendants of Thomas Burnham have been noted in every American war, including the French and Indian War. Film and stage accounts In 1899, Frank E. Fillis brought his circus and stage show \\"Savage South Africa\\", featuring a number of Zulu performers, to the Empress Theatre at Earls Court in London as part of the \\"Greater Britain Exhibition\\". The actors dramatically played out famous battles from the Matabele wars twice a day. The program featured \\"Wilson's Heroic Stand at the Shangani River\\", a re-enactment of the battle of the Shangani Patrol. Fillis himself played Major Wilson, Peter Lobengula played the Matabele King Lobengula, and Burnham was played by the adopted son of Texas Jack Omohundro, \\"Texas Jack\\" Jr., who later ran a Wild West show in South Africa featuring the American cowboy and entertainer Will Rogers. The Shangani segment of the show was filmed in September 1899, and subsequently sold to movie houses around the world as Major Wilson's Last Stand. Years later, a feature-length Shangani Patrol (film) (1970) was released. The picture was shot on location in and around Bulawayo by RPM Film Studios and directed by David Millin. Burnham was portrayed by the American cowboy actor Will Hutchins of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series Sugarfoot, and the part of Major Wilson was played by the South African actor Brian O'Shaughnessy. In late 1958, Ernest Hemingway acquired the rights to produce a film version of Burnham's memoirs, Scouting on Two Continents. CBS immediately contracted Hemingway to produce the film for television, with Gary Cooper expressing considerable interest in playing the part of Burnham. Hemingway was already behind schedule with other commitments, however, and no work had been done on the movie when he committed suicide in July 1961. Another epic film, On My Honor, was conceived and begun by Cecil B. DeMille. It was to document the founding of the Scouting movement but was left unfinished after DeMille died in January 1959. The screenplay, by Jesse Lasky, Jr., focused on Baden-Powell, Burnham and other pioneers who were to have a major influence on Scouting. After DeMille's death, associate producer Henry Wilcoxon continued to work on the film until 1962, hiring Sydney Box to assist with the script. Starting in 2001, producers Jerry Molen and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille's project, using an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky and Box. In June 2014, RatPac Entertainment and Class 5 Films acquired the non-fiction article American Hippopotamus, by Jon Mooallem, about the meat shortage in the U.S. in 1910 and the attempts made by Burnham, Duquesne and Congressman Robert Broussard to import hippopotamuses into the Louisiana bayous and to convince Americans to eat them. The movie will highlight the Burnham‚ÄìDuquesne rivalry. Edward Norton, William Migliore and Brett Ratner will produce this feature film. Tributes Sir H. Rider Haggard, inventor of the lost world literary genre, was heavily influenced by the larger than life adventures of his friend Burnham as he penned his fictional hero Allan Quatermain. There are many similarities between these two African explorers: both sought and discovered ancient treasures and civilizations, both battled large wild animals and native peoples, both were renowned for their ability to track, even at night, and both had similar nicknames: Quatermain was dubbed \\"Watcher-by-Night\\", while Burnham was called \\"He-who-sees-in-the-dark\\". To commemorate 100 years of Scouting, the BSA issued 100 bronze coins in 2007 featuring Burnham and Baden-Powell. One side shows the bust of Burnham and is inscribed: \\"Major Frederick Russell Burnham\\", \\"Father of Scouting\\". Other side shows the bust of Baden-Powell and is inscribed: \\"Col. Robert Baden-Powell\\", \\"Founder of Scouting\\". The coins were distributed by the White Eagle District. Years earlier, the BSA helped create the Major Burnham Bowling Trophy, an annual bowling event sponsored by Union Oil and held in California. Serbelodon burnhami, an extinct gomphothere (Shovel-Tusker elephant) from California, was named after Burnham. It was discovered by John C. Blick, the brother of Burnham's first wife.

Interviewed by historians, he was able to supply information about well-known historical events such as the Battle of Cartagena, fought in 1815, as well as about Indian conflicts and a terrible famine that had taken place years before. Asked about the secret of his longevity, Pereira said that one must chew cocoa beans, drink plenty of coffee, smoke a big cigar now and then, and not worry. Pereira was flown to New York City to be checked by teams of modern doctors. He was four feet four inches tall and weighed seventy-five pounds. He had no teeth but his hair was still brown. He had the blood pressure and arterial health of a young man, could easily stand on one leg and pirouette, and walk several blocks and up a couple of flights of stairs without losing his breath. One doctor said he had the appearance of a man \\"more than 150 years old.\\" Four feet, four inches tall and weighing 82 pounds, Pereira had five wives, all of whom he outlived; Pereira even outlived all his children and even his grandchildren.

It is also known as the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation Building, or BMC building for short. As the name suggests, the ‚ÄòV‚Äô shaped building houses the civic body that governs the city of Mumbai, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. It is said to be the largest civic organization in India as well as in Asia covering an area of . History Winged allegorical figure representing the 'urbs prima in Indis' and the Coat of Arms of MCGM below The main tower of the building The MCGM was created in 1865 and Arthur Crawford was its first Municipal Commissioner. The Municipality was initially housed in a modest building at the terminus of Girgaum Road. In 1870, it was shifted to a building on the Esplanade, located between Watson Hotel and the Sassoon Mechanics Institute where the present Army & Navy building is situated. On 9 December 1884, the foundation stone for the new building of the Bombay Municipal Corporation was laid opposite to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, by the Viceroy of the time, Lord Ripon. Two designs were considered for the building; one of the Gothic designs done by Frederick William Stevens and the other in the Indo-Saracenic design presented by Robert Fellowes Chisholm. In the end, a blend of Venetian Gothic and Indo-Saracenic was settled upon. The building was completed in 1893. Heritage status and restoration Winged Lion, Griffin like sculpture or Gargoyle on the building Sir Pherosha Mehta Statue in front of MCGM watching over the roads, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj terminus and traffic. The Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee of the Municipal Corporation of Mumbai has categorized the heritage buildings of Mumbai under the guidelines prepared for the purpose. According to these guidelines, the Municipal Corporation Building, Bombay has been categorized by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation as Grade II A. The list of heritage buildings, as categorized on 24 April 2005, under Grade I, Grade II, Grade IIA, Grade III and Precincts are 591.

The restoration plan for the 125-year-old MCGM Gothic structure envisages a) restoration of interiors and the exterior - from the roof tiles to the exquisite Minton tiles inside and to stained glass work and b) strengthening several wooden beams. In the first phase the structure would be restored to its original glory involving replacement of broken tiles, repair of statues, and removal of plants and moss. The subsequent phases of restoration would involve a) reorganization of office space within the building to improve the operational efficiency of staff members, b) 'Citizens Facilitation Centre' and party offices in the ground floor and c) Corporation Hall to be modified for a larger seating arrangement by including outer corridors and opening the wooden doors to increase its seating capacity from 200 to 300. Estimated to cost Rs 80 crore (US$16 million, at current exchange rate), approved by the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee and the civic administration, it is the largest and most comprehensive conservation concept undertaken in the city, without disturbing the routine work of the civic affairs and administration of the MCGM. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), as the primary agency responsible for urban governance, has also signed an MOU with NGO Council to work closely with NGOs in the fields of education, public health, creation of urban amenities, art and culture and heritage conservation. Architecture and Design Before construction, two designs were considered for the building; one of the Gothic designs done by Frederick William Stevens and the other in the Indo-Saracenic design presented by Robert Fellowes Chisholm. The Gothic design was finally selected. The building is known for its tall tower. The chief architectural feature is the central dome that rises to a height of . The gable has a huge winged allegorical figure representing the 'urbs prima in Indis', the first city of India as it was to be known then. The richly molded and paneled Council Chamber has a ceiling of unpolished teak. Records also support that at these environs Phansi Talao or Gallows Tank, where public hangings took place, was located. In the period from 1100 to 1500 AD, the architecture of churches constructed with ornamental arches, with ribs supported by buttresses resulted, in the subsequent idea of the framed structural design with grandeur and monumentality during the renaissance period of 1500-1700 AD, as the distinct style; the Mumbai Municipal Corporation building, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, the Rajabai tower and the University of Mumbai are some examples of this style. The old style of dome construction was also revived and became popular; 1750 onwards was considered to be the period of modern architecture. The Gothic architecture with controlled composition custom-made to the climatic extremes of the city has cusped window arches and elaborately domed corner towers. At the entrance to the MCGM stands a bronze statue of Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, a prominent Indian lawyer.

The Eidoloscope was demonstrated for members of the press on April 21, 1895, and opened to the paying public on Broadway on May 20. History Originally called the Pantoptikon (also spelled 'Panoptikon'), it is perhaps the first widescreen film format, with an aspect ratio of 1.85. It had a film gauge of 51 mm and an aperture of 37 mm by 20 mm. It was instrumental in the history of film in that it created what became known as the \\"Latham loop\\", which are two loops of film, one on each side of the intermittent movement, which act as a buffer between continuously moving sprockets and the jerky motion of the intermittent movement. This relieved strain on the filmstrip and so enabled the shooting and projection of much longer motion pictures than had previously been possible. Early beginnings novella starring Rosabel Morrison. The production was probably the first stage-and-screen hybrid in the US. Woodville Latham, one of the creators of the Eidoloscope, was originally a chemistry professor.Musser, C., \\"Projecting Motion Pictures: Invention\\", Vol. 1. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1990 Woodville's sons were in the business of showing boxing matches and would frequently hear complaints from patrons about how someone should make a machine that projects film on a screen. That way, more people could view the film at the same time, unlike the kinetoscope. It was a much more efficient method of exhibition that would reduce start-up costs, since each parlor would need only one machine instead of six. W.K.L Dickson, an employee of Edison's at the same time, joined the Latham's and their project to help raise finances and the knowledge of how to move forward in the business.Musser, C., \\"Projecting Motion Pictures: Invention\\", Vol. 1. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1990 The Eidoloscope was engineered mainly by Lauste, who also assisted with the design of the Latham loop.

The medallion inaccurately portrays him wearing the garb of a Native American chieftain of the western plains, even though he has been consistently described as a Miami. Kokomo, whose name is also sometimes given as Koh-Koh- Mah, Co-come-wah, Ma-Ko-Ko-Mo, or Kokomoko, was a Native American man of the Miami tribe who lived in northern Indiana at some point probably in the early nineteenth century. The city of Kokomo, Indiana is named after him. David Foster, the founder of the city of Kokomo, is widely quoted as having said, \\"It was the orneriest town on earth, so I named it after the orneriest Indian on earth‚Äîcalled it Kokomo,\\" but this anecdote may be apocryphal and it is unclear whether Foster was the one who proposed the name for the city at all. The etymology of Kokomo's name is unknown and none of the numerous explanation that have been put forward are viable. According to one sets of legends, Kokomo was the \\"lasting of the fighting chiefs\\" of Miami, a seven-foot-tall man of immense physical strength and great cunning under whose leadership his tribe flourished. Another set of legends, however, portrays him as not a chief at all, but an ordinary, lazy, dishonest, wife-beating drunkard of such despicable reputation that the Miami disowned him. His putative remains are buried in Pioneer Cemetery, where a monument stands in his honor. Name The name Koh Koh Maw appears in the June 27, 1838, entry of the ledger for Francis Godfroy's trading post in Mississinewa, Indiana. The man bearing the name was charged twelve dollars for a barrel of flour. There are only two pieces of documentary evidence of Miami men with names resembling the name Kokomo. The earliest attestation of the name comes from the Treaty at the Forks of the Wabash from 1834, on which a Miami man by the name of \\"Co-come-wah\\" is listed as a signatory. This individual has been traditionally identified by the Miami people as Kokomo himself. The only other piece of documentary evidence of Kokomo as a real Miami name is a single entry from the ledger of Francis Godfroy's Mississinewa River trading post dated to June 27, 1838 recording that an individual named \\"Koh Koh maw\\", accompanied by his unnamed wife, paid twelve dollars for a barrel of flour on that date. The meaning of the name Kokomo is unknown. Kiilhsoohkwa (lived 1810 ‚Äì 1915), the granddaughter of the Miami chief Little Turtle and a monolingual speaker of the Miami language, stated that she was familiar with the name K≈ç-k√°hm-ah, but that she did not know what the name meant. During an interview with Jacob Dunn, an amateur linguist, Gabriel Godfroy (lived 1830 ‚Äì 1910), the youngest son of Francis Godfroy, related the name Kokomo to the Miami verb meaning \\"to dive\\", but the words are not, in fact, linguistically related. Traditionally, the name has been said to be the Miami word for \\"black walnut\\", but this is not the case. It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning \\"he-bear\\" or \\"she-bear\\" in Miami, but it does not actually resemble any of the known Miami words for \\"bear\\" in the slightest. Another popular interpretation has claimed that it is the Miami word for \\"old woman\\" or \\"grandmother\\", but it is not either of these and it would make no sense for a man to have a name with either of these meanings. George Ironstrack, a citizen of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma and the assistant director and program director of the Education and Outreach Office of the Myaamia Center at Miami University in Ohio, has warned against attempts to deduce the etymology of the name Kokomo, stating that while Kokomo was a historical figure, \\"The origin of the name 'Kokomo' is fuzzier and supported only by bad history.\\" Dr. Francis Costa, a researcher at the Language Research Office at the Myaamia Center, states, \\"The fact that a fluent Miami speaker like Kiilhsoohkwa knew the person 'Kokomo' but had no idea what the name meant may well indicate that it's not even a Miami word.\\" Legends=Early settlers' tales Portrait of David Foster, the founder of Kokomo, who is associated with many of the early stories of Kokomo The city of Kokomo, Indiana is named after Kokomo, but it is unknown who actually proposed \\"Kokomo\\" as the name of the town or why. According to a popular legend, David Foster, the founder of the city of Kokomo, once stated, \\"It was the orneriest town on earth, so I named it after the orneriest Indian on earth‚Äîcalled it Kokomo.\\" This legend is probably apocryphal. Traditionally, it has been said that Kokomo was a great Miami chieftain in north-central Indiana of enormous physical size, who was able to use his superior strength and cunning to secure the interests of his people and win them a vast hunting territory. This version of the story holds that Kokomo was \\"last of the fighting chiefs\\". Another, darker version of the story attested among the early settlers, however, maintains that Kokomo was not a chief at all, but rather a lazy, dishonest, wife-beating drunkard. According to this version of the story, Kokomo was such a horrible, despicable character that the Miami refused to accept him as a member of their tribe. A story from the Peru Miami holds that Kokomo was once a member of their tribe, but that he was a disreputable rabble-rouser who was always causing havoc. This story holds that, finally, Kokomo gathered together a portion of the tribe, mostly women, and took them to the Wildcat Creek, where he founded his own village. According to a legend recorded in a history of Howard and Tipton Counties from 1883, Chief Ma-Ko-Ko- Mo had three brothers, who were also Miami chiefs. The names of his three brothers were Shock-O-Mo (which means \\"poplar tree\\"), Me-Shin-Go-Me-Sia (which means \\"burr oak\\"), and Shap-Pan-Do-Si-A (which means \\"sugar tree\\"). It is unknown what exact measure of authority each of the four brothers may have actually possessed.Blanchard, Charles. History of Howard and Tipton Counties, Indiana. F.A. Battey & Co., 1883, Chicago. (Page 84) Chief Ma-Ko-Ko-Mo owned a log cabin in the Center Township of Howard County, which was later taken possession of by David Foster in fall of 1842. David Foster built a trading post at the location. During the time following the establishment of his trading post, David Foster had many dealings with the native peoples residing in the area.Blanchard, Charles. History of Howard and Tipton Counties, Indiana. F. A. Battey & Co., 1883, Chicago. (Page 324) Stewart interview In the early 1920s, a Kokomo resident named Harrison Stewart, who had come to Kokomo at the age of ten in 1846 and who had known David Foster while he was alive, gave an interview for an article in a Kokomo newspaper in which he gave a great of information about Kokomo and David Foster. Stewart stated in the interview that Kokomo had been a Miami chieftain of enormous size and immense physical strength who had lived just west of Muncie and who had \\"brought riches and happiness to the Miami tribe by gaining great grounds on which they could hunt.\\" According to Stewart in the interview, Foster had not actually known Kokomo personally, but had only heard about him in stories from the Miami who visited his trading post. According to Stewart, Foster himself had believed the name Kokomo to have meant \\"he-bear\\" in the Miami language. Stewart stated that, towards the end of his life, Kokomo had led hunting and fishing expeditions into the territory north of the Wildcat Creek, in the same area where the city of Kokomo was eventually established, and that he eventually died on one of these expeditions. Steward also stated that David Foster had told him in a conversation shortly before Foster's death in 1877 that a Native American burial, including a set of bones and collection of grave goods, had been uncovered at one point during the construction of a sawmill. The physician who examined the bones‚ÄîKokomo's first doctor, Corydon Richmond‚Äîconcluded that they had belonged to a \\"giant more than seven feet tall and of great power\\" and the grave had contained brass kettles and stone tools, which Foster interpreted as evidence that the burial was ancient. According to Stewart, David Foster, after arriving on the scene and hearing this news, immediately began exciting shouting, \\"Chief Kokomo! Chief Kokomo!\\" The remains that had been identified as those of Kokomo were eventually transferred to Kokomo's Pioneer Cemetery, located on Purdum Street just south of Superior Street, where a monument marks the alleged site of his remains.

It designed and developed systems for homeland security; systems and radar sensors for air defence, battlefield management, naval warfare, coastal and maritime surveillance; air traffic control; and turn-key airport solutions. The company had around 4,500 employees. On 1 January 2013, it merged with its sister companies SELEX Galileo and SELEX Elsag to form Selex ES.  History  In 1951, Finmeccanica and the United States-based company Raytheon formed Microlambda, a joint venture based in Fusaro near Naples, operating in the field of applied electronics and producing radar systems under licence for land and naval applications. In 1956, a new company, SINDEL, was established with capital provided by Edison (hydroelectric and gas distribution). Several engineers and technicians from Microlambda moved to the company which was specialised in professional electronics. In 1960, an international agreement led to the creation of Selenia ‚Äì Associated Electronics Industries, a joint venture focused on civil and military surveillance systems whose shareholders were Finmeccanica (40%), Raytheon (40%) and Edison (20%). In 1990, Selenia merged with Aeritalia, an Italian aerospace company, forming Alenia, which had more than 30,000 employees, dealing with aeronautics, radars, naval systems, missiles, space applications, aircraft engines, as well as systems for environmental protection. In the late 1990s Alenia was split into two companies in order to focus on its core activities more effectively: Alenia Aerospazio specialising in the design and production of aircraft and space systems, and Alenia Difesa dealing with radars, missiles, naval systems, avionics, together with the company Otobreda. In the mid-1990s, the management of Alenia Difesa decided to form an international alliance. The chosen partner was the British firm GEC-Marconi, and Alenia Marconi Systems (later AMS) came into being in 1998 with shareholding divided equally between Finmeccanica and GEC-Marconi. A few months later, Marconi merged with British Aerospace, forming BAE Systems. In 2005 Finmeccanica acquired BAE Systems' interests in the Italian operations of Alenia Marconi Systems, together with BAE Systems' UK-based Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) (former Air Traffic Management and Airport Systems Division) and the USA (former ASI Inc.), and SELEX Sistemi Integrati was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of Finmeccanica. On 1 July 2010 the Defence, Logistics and Environment operations of Elsag Datamat were transferred to SELEX Sistemi Integrati, together with Elsag's subsidiary Space Software Italia and the activities related to the PAR (Precision Approach Radar) radar systems for surface, land and naval applications, formerly owned by SELEX Galileo. Operations= Facilities  In Italy SELEX Sistemi Integrati had facilities in Rome, Fusaro (Naples), Giugliano (Naples), Nerviano (Milan), Genoa, La Spezia and Taranto. Outside of Italy it had operations in the United Kingdom (SELEX Systems Integration Ltd and VEGA Consulting Services - focused on defence and security), Germany (SELEX Systems Integration GmbH - focused on weather radar systems), and the United States (SELEX Systems Integration Inc - focused on air navigation aids). Sectors SELEX Sistemi Integrati's activities were organised into three main sectors: Large Systems (homeland security and territory protection), Civil Systems (airport and air traffic management, coastal and maritime surveillance), and Defence Systems (land, naval and air applications). = Large Systems = Within the Finmeccanica Group SELEX Sistemi Integrati was the Design Authority and Prime Contractor for the design, development, manufacture and sale of Large Systems for Homeland Protection, which includes solutions for homeland security and defence. Solutions for Homeland Security comprised protection of territory and environment, borders, people, institutions and national and critical infrastructures. In this sector the company also realised systems for major events and crisis management. Solutions for Homeland Defence are related to the design and realisation of net-centric architectures able to operate into an inter-force and interoperable context to reach the superiority of information. = Civil Systems = The domain of technologies and critical capabilities in the field of Large Systems allowed the company to offer global solutions for Air Traffic Management, including turn key airport systems. From meteorological systems to ATC (Air Traffic Control) sensors, from ground stations to airspace traffic management, the company offered wide range solutions. The company also offered solutions for maritime and coastal surveillance with its Vessel Traffic Management System. = Defence Systems = SELEX Sistemi Integrati was active in the design, development and sale of integrated combat naval systems, combat management systems, command and control systems, fire control systems, radar and electro-optical sensors, simulation and training systems. SELEX Sistemi Integrati also offered support mission systems including planning and mission systems, information management systems for the logistic process support and test and validation integrated systems. With the fixed (FADR) and deployable (DADR) version of RAT31DL, SELEX Sistemi Integrati was the main European supplier of 3D long-range radar into the NATO area.  Radar Museum  On April 2, 2009 SELEX Sistemi Integrati opened the Radar Museum,Museo del Radar the first created by a company in Europe. The Radar Museum is founded on the principles of reclaiming, reorganizing and keeping alive the history of radar manufacturing, which, in Italy, began about 60 years ago in the Fusaro site (Naples). The Radar Museum covers an area of about 750 square metres divided into four zones: exhibition area, documents archive, simulation area and conference room. The exhibition also includes an external area featuring some of the most significant radar antennas developed and built by SELEX Sistemi Integrati in the past.

Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde (Swedish for Cape Waldemar), is a museum located on Djurg√•rden in central Stockholm. The name is composed of Waldemar, an Old German noble male name, and udde, meaning cape. It is derived from a historical name of the island Djurg√•rden, Valmunds√∂ (see History of Djurg√•rden.) It was the former home of the Swedish Prince Eugen, who discovered the place in 1892, when he rented a house there for a few days. Seven years later he bought the premises and had a new house designed by the architect Ferdinand Boberg, who also designed Rosenbad (the Prime Minister's Office and the Government Chancellery), and erected 1903‚Äì1904. Prince Eugen had been educated as a painter in Paris and after his death the house was converted to a museum of his own and others paintings. The prince died in 1947 and is buried by the beach close to the house. The complex consists of a castle-like main building‚Äîthe Mansion‚Äîcompleted in 1905, and the Gallery Building, added in 1913. The estate also includes the original manor-house building, known as the Old House and an old linseed mill, both dating back to the 1780s. The estate is set in parkland which features centuries-old oak trees and reflects the prince's interest for gardening and flower arrangement.

The 1980s During the 1980s, he was the singer, lyricist and occasionally drummer for The Apostles, a group that was founded in 1979 by four North London Public schoolboys, William 'Bill' Corbett, Julian Portinari, Dan Macintyre and Pete Byng-Hall and played a prominent part in the anarcho-punk scene in London. Some of the band's recordings appeared on the record label Mortarhate run by the group Conflict; other recordings, many on cassette, were released by The Apostles themselves. Members of the group published their own zine called Scum, and the Anarchist Precautions essentialles pour la bonne. During this period Martin and various associates, including at times members of the band Crass, helped run several different anarchist venues in London for performances, films and meetings, including \\"The Autonomy Centre\\" and \\"The Zig-Zag Club\\". During the time he was with The Apostles, Martin began to express his views about his own homosexuality and the topic in general in his lyrics for the band, emerging as a forerunner for the nascent Queercore scene. The Apostles, as well as Martin's next band, Academy 23, were both on the J.D.s Top Ten Tape, the first queercore compilation, issued by J.D.s zine in 1990, and were interviewed in Homocore zine. During the 1980s Martin and fellow Apostle Dave Fanning had sought to go far beyond the typical manner of releasing records. Each of their releases came with booklets or pamphlets written by Martin and artwork and comics by Fanning. Eventually they ceased to perform live in order to concentrate on this aspect of the band. Disillusioned with the punk scene, their interests in art and in other forms of music such as folk and industrial began to surface. The 1990s In 1990, The Apostles changed their name to Academy 23, and at the same time changed directions musically and philosophically. The band became more involved in cassette culture and collaborated with Industrial band The Grey Wolves on a couple of recordings. Moving away from their earlier punk sound, they successfully merged folk and industrial elements, and in the process became one of the early creators of the genre that would come to be called neo-folk. Frequently recording in other languages such as German, they became popular in continental Europe. Also in 1990, Martin began a collaboration with Peter Williams, who later joined Academy 23, in a band they named Time To Think, releasing several cassettes and a 7\\" EP on Williams' label Thinking Time. From 1992 till 2001, Martin wrote for and edited 26 issues of the non-commercial art magazine SMILE, an internationally edited publication first launched by Stewart Home in February 1984. 2000s At the end of the nineties, Academy 23 changed names once again, this time to Unit, for which Martin continues to perform and write. His constant collaborator through all three bands has been Dave Fanning.

Following a technique which he alleged was approved by his superiors, Welshofer placed Iraqi Major General Abed Hamed Mowhoush headfirst into a sleeping bag, wrapped the bag tightly with electrical cords, then sat on his chest and held his mouth closed. General Mowhoush had eight broken ribs from an earlier beating, allegedly carried out by CIA contractors under Welshofer's direction. American forces believed Mowhoush, a former high-level officer in Saddam Hussein's regime, was one of the leaders of the Iraqi insurgency. He had voluntarily surrendered to the Americans in hopes of helping free his sons, who were being held by the Americans. In his defense, Welshofer had stressed that the General was refusing to acknowledge leading the insurgency, and that his superiors were insisting that Army interrogators \\"take the gloves off\\" when dealing with Iraqi prisoners. At his court martial, a CIA official who observed Welshofer's interrogation techniques, wrote a memo because he was alarmed when Welshofer told him that he violated interrogation rules every day. On January 17, 2006, military judge Mark Toole rejected the request from attorney Frank Spinner, to dismiss the charges. CWO Jefferson L. Williams and Spc Jerry L.

As one of the country's National Collections, it was responsible for recording, interpreting and collecting information about the built and historic environment. This information, which relates to buildings, sites, and ancient monuments of archaeological, architectural and historical interest (including maritime sites and underwater constructions), as well as historical aspects of the landscape, was then made available to the public, mainly at no cost. It was established (shortly ahead of parallel commissions for Wales and England) by a Royal Warrant of 1908, which was revised in 1992. The RCAHMS merged with government agency Historic Scotland to form Historic Environment Scotland, a new executive non-departmental public body on 1 October 2015. History The Royal Commission was established in 1908, twenty-six years after the passage of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882, which provided the first state protection for ancient monuments in the United Kingdom, and eight years after the passage of the wider-ranging Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900. Critics ‚Äì including David Murray in his Archaeological Survey of the United Kingdom (1896) and Gerard Baldwin Brown in his Care of Ancient Monuments (1905) ‚Äì had argued that, for the legislation to be effective, detailed lists of significant monuments needed to be compiled; and had also made unfavourable comparisons between the policies of Britain and its European neighbours. Brown, Professor of Fine Art at the University of Edinburgh, explicitly proposed that the issues should be addressed by a Royal Commission, comparable to the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. His suggestion was favourably received by Sir John Sinclair, Secretary for Scotland, and, following a brief period of consultation, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland was established on 14 February 1908, with Brown as one of its first Commissioners. The equivalent Royal Commission for Wales was established in August 1908; and that for England in October 1908. Activities The Commission was based in Edinburgh where it had a huge selection of photographs and drawings for consultation. It also published a range of books and documents on Scottish architecture and archaeology. Study was also increasingly conducted of previously neglected industrial and agricultural constructions, as well as 20th-century buildings, including high-rise tower blocks. RCAHMS maintained a database/archive of the sites, monuments and buildings of Scotland's past, known as the National Monuments Record of Scotland (NMRS). A growing proportion of RCAHMS's own survey material and material deposited in the archive by others was made available through online databases such as Canmore. Since 1976, RCAHMS conducted intensive aerial survey of archaeological sites, buildings, landscapes and natural features. In addition to its holdings of its own (mainly oblique) aerial photographs, it held the National Collection of Aerial Photography, one of the largest and most important aerial imagery collections in the world, containing over 1.8 million aerial photographs of Scotland including large numbers of Royal Air Force oblique and vertical aerial photographs taken of Scotland during and in the years after the Second World War, as well as post-war Ordnance Survey, local and national government, commercial vertical aerial photographs, and over 10 million images of international sites as part of The Aerial Reconnaissance Archives (TARA). The RCAHMS in conjunction with Historic Scotland hosted a map-based GIS portal called PASTMAP. This allowed Historic Scotland,Scheduled Ancient Monuments data. NMRS,National Monuments Record of Scotland data. Scottish Natural HeritageData on Listed Buildings and Designed Landscapes and Gardens. and some Local Authority Sites and MonumentsKnown as SMRs (Sites and Monuments Records). data sets to be viewed together. Other online resources managed by RCAHMS included Scran, a UK charity with a learning image service of over 367,000 images, clip art, movies and sounds from museums, galleries, archives and the media; and Scotland's Places, a partnership website giving searchable access to the collections of RCAHMS, the National Records of Scotland and the National Library of Scotland. RCAHMS was one of the first national collections in Scotland to embed social media into its online services, enabling user generated images and information to be added to the national database Canmore. An outreach programme included publications, exhibitions, induction and training sessions for students and other groups, and a series of free lunchtime lectures, as well as daily Facebook and Twitter feeds. From 2011, the RCAHMS maintained the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland on behalf of Historic Scotland. The register was formerly maintained by the Scottish Civic Trust. Under the terms of a Bill of the Scottish Parliament published on 3 March 2014 RCAHMS would be dissolved and its responsibilities including the management of collections undertaken by a new executive Non-departmental public body to be called Historic Environment Scotland, which would also take over the property management responsibilities of Historic Scotland. This occurred on 1 October 2015. Area Inventories Coverage of Inventory volumes with date ranges (Orkney and Shetland not shown) Initially, RCAHMS recorded all buildings and monuments of note until the year 1707. This was later updated to 1805. The findings were published in a series of inventories. Changes in what constitutes a construction \\"of note\\", plus developments in how the public could access this information, led to the abandonment of the inventories after publication of the last Argyll volume in 1992. Consequently, only approximately one-half of Scotland was covered by this method. Although the volumes are now all out-of-print, they are available online on the Scotland's Places website, through most large public libraries, or via Historic Environment Scotland. * First Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in the County of Berwick (HMSO, 1909) * Second Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in the County of Sutherland (HMSO, 1911) * Third Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in the County of Caithness (HMSO, 1911) * Fourth Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in Galloway, Volume I, County of Wigtown (HMSO, 1912) * Fifth Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in Galloway, Volume II, County of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright (HMSO, 1914) * Sixth Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in the County of Berwick (revised issue, HMSO, 1915) * Seventh Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in the County of Dumfries (HMSO, 1920) * Eighth Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in the County of East Lothian (HMSO, 1924) * Ninth Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in the Outer Hebrides, Skye and the Small Isles (HMSO, 1928) * Tenth Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in the Counties of Midlothian and West Lothian (HMSO, 1929) * Eleventh Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in the Counties of Fife, Kinross and Clackmannan (HMSO, 1933) * Twelfth Report with an Inventory of the Ancient Monuments of Orkney and Shetland (HMSO, 1946) ** Volume I, Report and Introduction ** Volume II, Inventory of Orkney ** Volume III, Inventory of Shetland * An Inventory of the Ancient and Historical Monuments of the City of Edinburgh (with the Thirteenth Report of the Commission, HMSO, 1951) * An Inventory of the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Roxburghshire (with the Fourteenth Report of the Commission, 2 volumes, HMSO, 1956) * An Inventory of the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Selkirkshire (with the Fifteenth Report of the Commission, HMSO, 1957) * Stirlingshire.

An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments, Volume 7, Mid Argyll and Cowal: Medieval and Later Monuments (HMSO, 1992) A supplementary work entitled Late Medieval Monumental Sculpture in the West Highlands was published in 1977, augmenting the content of not only the contemporaneous Argyll volumes but the much earlier Outer Hebrides volume of 1928. Three further publications, North East Perth: An Archaeological Landscape (1990), South East Perth: An Archaeological Landscape (1994) and Eastern Dumfriesshire: An Archaeological Landscape (1997) were appended to the series. As the titles suggest these were concerned with archaeological remains rather than significant above-ground structures. Unlike all earlier volumes, these publications used the boundaries of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Hence 'Perth' refers to an area within Perth and Kinross District rather than historic Perthshire. The Dumfriesshire volume related to both the eastern end of the historic county and the post-1973 district as the areas were identical. To date the Dumfriesshire volume is the only area to be revisited as part of a completely new inventory. RCAHMS also published a series of lists covering archaeological sites and monuments which simply enumerated and identified, rather than interpreted, historic structures. As before, this series did not see completion. The series of 29 lists was begun in 1978 with the districts of Clackmannan and Falkirk within Central Region and concluded with the Easter Ross area of Ross and Cromarty District of Highland Region in 1989. Commissioners and staff As originally established, the RCAHMS was operated by a group of Commissioners, including a chairman and a Secretary. The Secretary was originally the person who wrote the Commission's report and undertook the required fieldwork, but later adopted a role similar to that of a chief executive. The chairperson always had a key role in the operation of the Commission, and, at one time or another, undertook the writing and editing of Commission publications. Commissioners were appointed by the Queen, advised by the First Minister of Scotland, with all appointments regulated by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland.

Guests, left to right at table: Noel Clarke, Nicholas Briggs, Rob Shearman, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat. The long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who has developed a very large, loyal and devoted fan base over the years. Doctor Who fans are sometimes referred to as Whovians, or simply as the Doctor Who fandom. The usage of \\"Whovian\\" was restricted to fans in the United States during the 1980s, when the Doctor Who Fan Club of America (pronounced by members as Dwifca ‚Äì now defunct) published the Whovian Times as its newsletter. An early use of 'Whovian', outside of the 'Whovian Times', is from Flaming Carrot Comics issue number 19 (circa 1988), when Flaming Carrot leads a combined group of Trekkies into rebellion. Fan organisations Doctor Who fans in Britain have had a formally recognised organisation ‚Äì the Doctor Who Appreciation Society (or DWAS) ‚Äì since the late 70s. It has thousands of members and enjoyed an ongoing relationship with the classic series and later with BBC Worldwide. The Oceanian Doctor Who Fan Club was founded soon after DWAS, in 1976, to galvanise resistance to the responsibilies and decisions of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to cease broadcasting the Doctor Who series (and was ultimately successful in having the decision overturned). The club president also edited Zerinza the club fanzine, until 1986. In the 1990s the club was renamed several times, today being the Doctor Who Club of Australia (or DWCA) which publishes a newsletter, \\"Data Extract\\". In the 1980s, some US fans staged \\"Save Doctor Who\\" publicity campaigns, trying to urge their local television stations to keep airing the show. The North American Doctor Who Appreciation Society was founded in the 1980s and served as an umbrella organisation for dozens of local fan groups throughout the continent. Its demise in the early 1980s led to the foundation of the Doctor Who Fan Club of America, and later the Friends of Doctor Who. FDW ended unceremoniously in the mid-1990s, and since then, American Doctor Who fandom has been served mostly through local fan clubs. The Doctor Who Information Network (DWIN) was founded in Canada in 1980 and continues to serve fans in North America. It was one of the first Doctor Who clubs in North America, and is the longest running Doctor Who club on the continent. DWIN supports the monthly Toronto Tavern fan gatherings. DWIN also sponsored several local chapters throughout Canada. Also in Canada is the Doctor Who Society of Canada (DWSC), a social network for Whovians of all ages whose community focuses on social interaction, intelligent exchange and commonality. The DWSC launched in 2011 and provides monthly social gatherings, online community forums and have been featured prominently at Toronto area Fan Conventions including Fan Expo, as well as Montreal & Ottawa Comic Con. The DWSC has launched its own Doctor Who Festival on 17 November 2012 ‚Äì REGENERATION ‚Äì and is branching out into local chapters across the country including Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax and Kitchener/Waterloo. The New Zealand Doctor Who Fan Club (NZDWFC) was founded by Scott Walker and Andrew Poulson in 1988 and remains the country's major fan support group. They continued to run the club until 1991. The club puts out a fanzine, Time Space Visualiser (TSV), twice-yearly. In 2012, The Doctor Who Fan Groups Google Map project was set up with the aim of making it easier for UK-based Doctor Who fans to find a local fan group and, in turn, to help local fan groups to find new members. Conventions At Doctor Who conventions, some fans cosplay as their favourite Doctor Who characters. Here, a fan at the 2006 Gallifrey One convention cosplays as the Fourth Doctor. Many Doctor Who conventions are held worldwide. The very first in 1977 was organised by The Doctor Who Appreciation Society and that event continues in the United Kingdom as the long-running (though occasional) PANOPTICON; usually held to great fanfare, including marking the series' fortieth anniversary. After many years in hiatus, Panopticon has returned! Other popular conventions of the past include the Manchester-based Manopticon, now back again and holding events in London and the Swindon-based Leisure Hives and Honeycomb. More recently, the company 10th Planet has held conventions such as Bad Wolf, Dimensions and Invasion. Wales-based Regenerations has had great success of late, as have other signing events held on the Strand by London-based Scificollector. The Doctor Who Appreciation Society has re-established itself as an event organiser too, and whilst Panopticon, a name still associated with the Society, has not been held since 2003, other brands, namely 'Time' and 'Doctor Who Unleashed' are well known in the market. In Australia a variety of events (half day \\"parties,\\" or full-scale conventions) have been organised, many \\"Whoventions\\" being held in Sydney by the Doctor Who Club of Australia, and by some other clubs in various states. The high cost of travel and small population base makes it hard to pay for many of the stars, so many events have been organised at short notice during any visits by a star, or other person linked to the show, such as Jon Pertwee (1980), Peter Davison and Janet Fielding (both 1983). North America's first events were based in Los Angeles in 1979 and 1980 with Who One (featuring Tom Baker). Soon followed an enormous convention heyday during the 1980s in the Chicago area with the Spirit of Light events, which attracted many thousands of fans due to the show's popularity on public television, and Creation Conventions held in various cities (and including other science fiction shows' merchandise and programming as well). In the late 1980s other events such as Omnicon and Megacon showcased the classic series. The 1990s saw a decline in major events, though Chicago featured the relatively large-sized Visions events throughout the decade, and the popular Gallifrey One convention began in Los Angeles. As of 2015, Gallifrey One and the Chicago TARDIS convention (Visions' successor) continue, with the addition of Georgia's WHOlanta (formerly TimeGate) in Atlanta (begun 2005), Florida's Hurricane Who (begun 2009), Alabama's Con Kasterborous (begun 2012), New York's L. I. Who (begun 2013), and the annual Sci Fi Sea Cruise featuring Doctor Who guests departing from different ports each year. Startup events exist in the form of CONsole Room in Minnesota, (Re)Generation Who in Maryland, Time Eddy in Kansas, and WhoFest in Texas. Fanzines Perhaps the first form of organised fan activity was around fanzines ‚Äì unofficial, homemade magazines celebrating the series. Generally these were typed, with hand-drawn illustrations, with the occasional photograph, and were usually photocopied or duplicated in small quantities. In the 1970s there were some early fan activities in Britain, with associated fanzines. One of the first such \\"'zines\\" was published by Keith Miller in Edinburgh, at first it was roughly produced, but by the mid-1970s was improved by the switch to photocopying. By about 1975 new staff at the BBC office reduced such help, and Miller's 'zine and associated club were to fade away quite quickly. Perhaps the \\"second generation\\" of such fanzines could be said to be formed around 1975‚Äì76, such as TARDIS, around which the DWAS was organised. In Australia, the national Doctor Who Club was similarly established around the 'zine Zerinza in 1976 (to 1986). A quarterly magazine called The Whostorian was published in Newfoundland in conjunction with the As Yet Unnamed Doctor Who Fan Club of Newfoundland (AYUDWFCON). Other zines from the first decade of fandom included Gallifrey, Oracle, Skaro, Shada and Frontier Worlds. Some information on a few of these can be viewed at fan website Nith Circle of Hell. When the publication of the novelisations was in its infancy (only three being available until the mid-70s, and reference books were either awful or out-of-print, much of the content of the first fanzines was devoted to documenting plots and characters, some interviews, news, book reviews (once Target started a regular schedule), letters, fan fiction and art. The growth of the merchandise range lead to Marvel's Doctor Who Weekly (later Doctor Who Magazine ‚Äì DWM). Initially the reference materials were largely reissues of the work done by Jeremy Bentham for DWAS (itself usually reliant on BBC plot outlines). The Weekly was not always very good, and with so many pages being dominated by poor quality US-style comics (few having any of the \\"flavour\\" of the British series), meant it was less of a rival to fanzines than at first appeared. But the switch to a monthly format saw it become an increasingly professional rival with better production values than the fanzines could afford. Also the DWM was to be a better source of reference, regular interviews, news from the studio, and with more time being spent preparing each issue. The large array of Target novels, reference books, and start of home video-recording on a big scale by the late 1970s, meant that fanzines shifted focus somewhat. Change was also be to the leading fans growing older, leaving school or university, and so having (sometimes) more money for printing, and higher expectations. As a result, editors began to concentrate more on opinion ‚Äì fan reviews of stories, debate, and letters. Many of the writers were now graduates, some in media studies, or even working in the BBC itself. In these pre-internet times, most fanzines had active letters pages, which were the main conduit for debate around Doctor Who, especially with a wide geographical spread of so many fans. The need to find new, original content meant that fanzines began to look closer at the series, subjecting stories and characters to ever-deeper analysis, providing detail and discussion unavailable through more \\"official\\" channels. As technology developed, so did fanzines. A move from photocopying to offset litho printing in the early 1980s allowed the bigger selling fanzines to improve print quality, although lower-circulation titles continued to use photocopying for many years after this. Bath-based Skaro was one of the first fanzines to be professionally typeset, but that was virtually the exception as this was such an expensive process. The 1970s‚Äì80s fanzines were all produced well before modern, affordable, home computers with crisp laser printers made the revolution that was desktop publishing. Most were produced under difficult conditions, and early editors had to do everything by hand, all their own typing, with no spell check, meaning correcting mistakes was a nightmare, and final lay out could take days, if not weeks. The mid-1980s has been described by some fans as \\"the golden age of A5 fanzines\\", as this period saw an explosion of activity, particularly in the UK. Although the enthusiasm of some editors could not be matched by their resources and many fanzines failed to see a second issue, some of the most popular zines appeared then, including Queen Bat, Chronicle, Star Begotten, Paradise Lost, Spectrox, Black and White Guardian, Cygnus Alpha, Five Hundred Eyes, Eye Of Horus (in print between 1983‚Äì85 and online since 2004) and Purple Haze (edited by Steve O'Brien, later of SFX Magazine). Format seemed to play a disproportionate role in how a fanzine was perceived, with divisions appearing between the cheaper-looking A5 fanzines and the glossier, more professional A4 \\"pro-zines\\" such as The Frame and Private Who. The news-zine Doctor Who Bulletin (DWB) later named Dreamwatch Bulletin) managed to straddle this divide, sometimes controversially, combining a professional A4 magazine format with some of the anarchism and disrespect for authority of the underground. The BBC's discontinuation of the series, and ratings decline, meant that many titles faded out unless backed by a large club. To a large extent, today fanzines have been replaced by websites, podcasts and discussion boards, but a few do still exist. Many of them are published by fan clubs including the DWAS zine Celestial Toyroom, (which was launched in 1976 and has been published continuously since then, making it the oldest surviving Doctor Who fanzine in the world,) the New Zealand Doctor Who Fan Club zine Time-Space Visualiser (TSV) which has been in existence since 1987, the DWIN fanzine Enlightenment which has been published six times a year since 1983, and Data Extract launched by the Doctor Who Club of Australia in 1980. Other individuals and groups still produce fanzines. Black Scrolls was the first prozine to offer a multimedia CDROM on its cover in 2005, featuring interviews with actors, Who- related art, a back issue archive and an alternative voice-over commentary for one of the episodes and the distinction of being professionally printed and entirely in colour which was a modest success that ran for eight issues between 1993 and 2005. Doctor Who Fanzines FANWNAK and Vworp! Vworp! are among the full colour A4, printed fanzines available today, as well as others such as Panic Moon, The Finished Product which are smaller sizes and black and white. Many fanzines still take the time-honoured route of printing and distributing their zine by mail, but many now distribute their fanzine as downloadable and printable PDFs such as Planet of the Ming Mongs and \\"The Terrible Zodin\\", finally removing what was often the main cause for a fanzine's closure, the cost of printing and distribution ‚Äì but in so doing also losing the appeal of a unique hardcopy publication, and therefore the only true identifier of a 'fanzine'. It's likely that as this trend increases new terminology will replace the term fanzine, which is already archaic and out-of-place in online contexts. Many professional Doctor Who writers, for both the current TV series and the books, began their careers writing for fanzines, including Paul Cornell, Rob Shearman, Matt Jones, Marc Platt, Gareth Roberts, Clayton Hickman, David Howe and Stephen James Walker. Fan productions Like other shows which have developed a large following, Doctor Who also has groups of fans developing their own productions based on the show, the most notable is the uncompleted 1996 Devious for having the last acting appearance of Jon Pertwee and featured as a special feature on The War Games DVD. One of the most significant fan groups producing dramatised stories were Audio Visuals, who distributed their works on audio cassettes during the 1980s. Many involved in this group would later form the commercial company Big Finish Productions and be licensed by the BBC to produce official Doctor Who stories for a retail market on audio CD. Several of these productions were later broadcast by BBC Radio. Another fan group, The Doctor Who Audio Dramas, has produced their own version of the show since 1982 and has been running for over 38 years uninterrupted. (Longer than the uninterrupted BBC version of Doctor Who.) A number of their writers and actors have been professionals or gone on to professional work. Celebrity fans The series has a devoted global following of people from a range of backgrounds. Some fans have ended up working creatively on the television series. One of the most prominent examples is the creator of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the late Douglas Adams, who wrote or co-wrote several television scripts (The Pirate Planet, City of Death and Shada) and was script editor of the original series' seventeenth season. Adams had been a fan since the first season, and made two attempts to pitch a script for Doctor Who in the early 1970s before his first serial was commissioned. Queer as Folk creator Russell T Davies, Coupling creator Steven Moffat, and Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall were all lifelong fans of the series, and all in turn became head writer, or showrunner, of the revived series in 2005, 2010, and 2018 respectively. Chibnall's fandom extended to an appearance, as a representative of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society, on a 1986 episode of the BBC feedback show Open Air, in which he was critical of the ending to The Trial of a Time Lord, the 23rd season of Doctor Who. Other celebrity fans have donated to the show in alternative ways. For example, the Panini publication The Complete Seventh Doctor (p47) lists singer Bob Dylan as a \\"great fan\\", such that he permitted his music to be used in the opening moments of season twenty-five without royalty. (Although Dylan's music was not in the event used). William Rees- Mogg, editor of The Times newspaper from 1967 until 1981, publicly declared his enjoyment of Doctor Who on an edition of the BBC's current affairs series Panorama in 1980. Prompted by this, the actor and dramatist Emlyn Williams admitted in the pages of The Times that he too was a keen follower of the series.

Twelfth Doctor Peter Capaldi is a fan and has been since he was a teenager. Music inspired by Doctor Who Since the show's debut, various musical groups and artists have been inspired to write music either about or relating to Doctor Who. The first known example was the song \\"I'm Gonna Spend My Christmas With a Dalek\\", the first and only single released by British band The Go-Go's. The song was released in December 1964 and distributed through Oriole Records, but did not make the UK Singles Chart. The first single about the show to make the UK Singles Chart was \\"Dr. Who\\" by Mankind. The track was based on the Doctor Who theme music in a disco style and was Mankind's first and only charting single(follow up 'Chain Reaction'was a flop). Released by Pinnacle in 1978, the song peaked at Number 25 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1985, charity ensemble Who Cares? released a single protesting at the BBC's decision to place Doctor Who on hiatus for 18 months, entitled \\"Doctor in Distress\\". The single was released in aid of Cancer Research, and featured various Doctor Who cast members (such as Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant and Anthony Ainley), as well as contemporary musicians (Bucks Fizz, The Moody Blues and Ultravox). As with \\"I'm Gonna Spend My Christmas With a Dalek\\", the single did not make the UK Singles Chart. The most famous example of Doctor Who-inspired music is \\"Doctorin' the Tardis\\" by The Timelords (a pseudonym for the ambient house and situationish act The KLF), which reached Number One on the UK Singles Chart in 1988. The song's lyrics referenced the Daleks and the TARDIS, and its melody was based largely around the show's opening theme. As well as both Mankind and The Timelords, many other acts have incorporated the Doctor Who theme music into their own compositions. British rock band Pink Floyd briefly used the theme during their 1971 single \\"One of These Days\\", which featured a Doctor Who-related music video. The theme music has also been covered by several other acts, such as Orbital, while other bands such as Coldcut have featured samples of the theme. Comedian and singer Mitch Benn's 2002 album Radio Face features a song entitled \\"Doctor Who Girl\\". The song talks about how the singer would like to find a girlfriend who is like the female companions of Doctor Who. Since the series' renewal on BBC, a genre has developed under the name 'Trock' (a term created by YouTuber and (at the time) unsigned musician Alex Day, aka Nerimon), meaning Time Lord Rock. Propagated mainly via the internet on sites such as YouTube, Trock songs include references to the show's theme tune, as well as characters and plots from the show. The band Chameleon Circuit produces music exclusively relating to Doctor Who, and in addition to general fandom songs, has episode-specific songs like 'Kiss the Girl' and 'The Big Bang 2'. They have a fast-growing online following, and as of 2011 have released two albums: Chameleon Circuit in 2009, and Still Got Legs in July 2011, both on DFTBA records. Still Got Legs charted on the Billboard Heatseekers chart at #23. The industrial/EBM band Rotersand also features themes related to Doctor Who. Mainly the song \\"Exterminate, Annihilate, Destroy\\" using Dalek soundclips. Hard rock band Anno Mundi's 2011 album Cloister graveyard in the snow features a suite entitled Gallyfreyan's Suite, divided into three sections: Journey to the 4th Dimension, Tardis and Time lord. In 2013 the musical group Legs Nose Robinson became a varied all in house musical style Trock band, recording albums, touring fan conventions. Their all self made videos have gained over 375,000 views on YouTube. TV series \\"Whovians\\" is an Australian comedy panel, chat show hosted by Rove McManus, who engages with a team of four Whovians or superfans of Doctor Who to analyse, critique and unravel the mysteries of the show. The first show screened on Sunday 16 April 2017 at 8.30pm AEST on ABC2, as a companion piece to the first episode of Season 10 of Doctor Who which had just screened on the ABC.

Milagro, which means \\"miracle\\" in Spanish, was dedicated to the lives of Miles Davis and Bill Graham, and was Santana's first album on the Polydor label after twenty-two years with Columbia Records. The album reached 102 in the Billboard 200. As of 2010, this is the band Santana's only studio album not owned by Sony Music Entertainment, the successor to Sony BMG, a company formed by the merger of Columbia's parent (the original) Sony Music Entertainment and BMG, the parent of Santana's current label Arista Records. The album is owned by Universal Music Group, which purchased Polydor's parent PolyGram in 1998. Given the poor commercial performance of the album as well, this is probably the main reason no songs from this album was featured on the 2002 career- spanning compilation The Essential Santana.

As it runs across the Gusii Land part of it becomes the Mogonga River, known for its deadly effects when it floods. Mogonga and Gucha are almost equal in size and they meet just 1 mile before flowing through the Ogembo Town center. The Gucha- Migori river changed its course near its mouth in 2001-2002, moving north to its present location. About 45 km from Migori, the Gogo Falls dam was completed in 1956 with a hydropower capacity of 2MW, connected to the Kenyan national grid. The dam is operated by Kenya Electricity Generating Company (Kengen). In 2014, Kenyan government announced an upgrade to the dam, to increase capacity to 12MW, regulate flow to prevent flooding, and allow irrigation of approximately 25,000ha. As of February 2016, the Orango irrigation intake and canals have been built downstream of the dam for the use of Okenge and Owiro farmers in Migori County, but construction of distributary channels have been delayed. The Gogo Falls archaeological site is located near the dam.

The series compiles footage filmed on cameras mounted in police cars and helicopters, with occasional material from road-side or hand-held cameras, with each episode focusing on a different type of road related crime, such as speeding, driving without due care and attention or dangerous overtaking, or in more extreme cases, hazards relating to weather conditions or car chases involving wanted criminals. Seven episodes were released straight to VHS before a deal was struck with BSkyB to broadcast the series on Sky One, with a new episode to be broadcast each year from 1996 onwards. A total of fourteen episodes were filmed, with the final episode, a special focusing on policing in the United States, airing in 2001. Prior to the broadcast of Police Stop! 5, Sky also broadcast the first four episodes previously released exclusively to VHS. The series also broadcast in the United States on Syndication, which notably resulted in several episodes being cut to remove footage for which clearance rights were unavailable. The series also spawned an international spin-off, which began broadcasting in New Zealand in 1996. The series aired on TV3, and was fronted by former Australian race car driver Peter Brock. The series' format was similar to the British versions, using footage from both the United Kingdom and United States, with additional content from the New Zealand police. Later series were retitled Police Stop ‚Äì Caught in the Act, which in addition to car chase footage, also featured footage from security cameras, often from shops or public places. Footage also extended to Brock himself working alongside the New Zealand police, giving an insight into general lines of police work. Although the series concluded in 1998, a special episode was screened in 2006 as a tribute to Brock, a week after he died in a Motorsport accident. Broadcast The first episode of Police Stop! was released on video in 1993, and was widely successful, partly due to a campaign ran by The Sun, which offered readers a discount when ordered directly from the manufacturer. As such, a second video followed swiftly in April 1994. The second video is the only episode not to be presented by Graham Cole, instead fronted by Inspector David Rowland, a traffic division inspector from the Metropolitan Police. Cole returned to present two episodes focusing on policing in the United States, the first aptly titled Police Stop! America and the second Police Stop! Or We'll Shoot, which predominantly focuses on the work of the Texas Rangers. Police Stop! 3 and Police Stop! 4 both followed in 1995, before a compilation video, entitled Worst of Police Stop!, followed in 1996. Police Stop! and Police Stop! 2 were produced with the co-operation of several British police forces, who contributed most of the material. Aside from the two American specials, Police Stop! 3 and Police Stop! 4 also included material primarily from the United States and mainland Europe. Notably, all seven videos were exempt from classification. From Police Stop! 5 onwards, the series transferred to Sky One, where a new episode was broadcast yearly until 2001. From this point onwards, the series continued to use more clips from non-British sources. Police Stop! was regularly repeated on Men and Motors and ITV4 during the late 2000s, although the repeats resulted in some confusion for viewers when both channels erroneously listed the series as being presented by Alastair Stewart, confusing it with the former ITV series Police Camera Action!, which Stewart fronted. Notably, only ten of the fourteen episodes were repeated on both channels, with Police Stop! America, Police Stop! Or We'll Shoot, Worst of Police Stop! and Police Stop! 11 remaining unrepeated. Labyrinth Media, who produced the series, also produced two further direct-to-video releases featuring a similar format. Riot Police, released in 1994, features graphic footage of riots, including the riot of March 31, 1990 in Trafalgar Square, London. Real Life Rescues, presented by Alastair Stewart and also released in 1994, features camera footage of real-life rescues involving the emergency services.
